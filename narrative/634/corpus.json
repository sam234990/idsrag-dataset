{"ori_id":"96546ceb80de8303f5057f1f2f4cb9fa5d0a2b20","title":"He Knew He Was Right","context":"He Knew He Was Right\n A wealthy young English gentleman, Louis Trevelyan, visits the fictional Mandarin Islands, a distant British possession, and becomes smitten with Emily Rowley, the eldest daughter of the governor, Sir Marmaduke Rowley. The Rowleys accompany Trevelyan to London, where he marries Emily. When the rest of the family goes home, Emily's sister Nora remains behind, under Trevelyan's protection.\nThe marriage is initially a happy one and the couple have a baby boy. Then a seemingly minor matter undermines their marriage. Colonel Osborne, an old friend of Sir Marmaduke's, visits Emily much too frequently for her husband's taste. Though nothing improper occurs, Trevelyan orders his wife to avoid the man in future. Emily resents his lack of trust and makes no attempt to hide it. Their relationship deteriorates to the point that they separate.\nMeanwhile, Nora attracts two admirers, the wealthy Charles Glascock, the eldest son and heir of Lord Peterborough, and Hugh Stanbury, a close friend of Trevelyan's from their days at Oxford University. Stanbury ekes out a precarious living writing newspaper articles. Glascock proposes to Nora, but despite the fact that Stanbury has given no indication of his feelings for her, she rejects the future nobleman, not without a great deal of struggle and much to the dismay of her friends.\nAnother subplot involves Jemima Stanbury, the capricious, formidable spinster aunt of Hugh. In her youth, she had been engaged to the eldest son of a leading banker. They had had a falling out and parted company, but upon his demise, he had left everything to her, making her very wealthy. Aware of the poverty of Hugh's branch of the family, she had generously paid for his education and helped him get a start in life. However, when he chose to work for what she considered to be a radical publication, the staunch Tory withdrew her support. She then offers to accept one of Hugh's sisters as a companion. After some debate, timid, unassertive Dorothy Stanbury is sent.\nTrevelyan arranges to have Emily and Nora live with Hugh's mother and her other daughter, Priscilla. However, Emily obstinately receives a visit from Colonel Osborne, against all advice to the contrary. Trevelyan finds out and becomes further maddened.\nIn the meantime, Aunt Stanbury tries to promote a marriage between her niece Dorothy and a favoured clergyman, Mr Gibson. This causes much resentment with Arabella and Camilla French, two sisters who had considered him a future husband for one of them (though which was still a matter of much debate). However, this plan is derailed.\nAunt Stanbury had always intended to bequeath her wealth back to the Burgess family, rather than to her Stanbury relations. She had chosen as her heir Brooke Burgess, the nephew of her former fianc\u0102\u0160. When he visits her for the first time as an adult, everyone is charmed by his warm, lively personality, especially Dorothy. When Gibson finally proposes to her, she cannot avoid unfavourably comparing him to Brooke and declines. Her aunt is at first much put out by Dorothy's obstinacy. Eventually however, she places the blame on the clergyman, which results in a serious breach between them.\nThe feud with his former patron leaves Gibson so distracted that he finds himself engaged to a domineering Camilla French. After a while, he comes to regret his choice. Finally, finding Camilla's overpowering personality unbearable, he extricates himself by agreeing to marry the milder Arabella instead. Camilla is driven to extravagant threats and is finally sent to stay with her stern uncle in the period leading up to the wedding.\nThen Aunt Stanbury becomes very ill, resulting in Dorothy and Brooke spending a good deal of time in each other's company. Brooke takes the opportunity to propose to an unsuspecting Dorothy. She however is reluctant to accept, fearing that her aunt will disinherit Brooke. Instead, the old woman blames her niece. They quarrel and Dorothy returns to her mother.\nAunt Stanbury misses Dorothy greatly and makes it known that she would welcome her back, though she still vehemently opposes her marriage to Brooke. Dorothy does come back, and even tries to break off her engagement, but Brooke will not stand for it. In the end, Aunt Stanbury's love for her niece is stronger than her desires and she gives her blessing to their wedding.\nMeanwhile, Trevelyan departs England to escape the shame he feels. During his aimless wanderings, he meets Mr Glascock, who is on his way to Italy to visit his father. They encounter two attractive young American ladies, Caroline and Olivia Spalding. Glascock's father is in such poor health that the son is obliged to remain in the country to await his probable demise. While waiting, he courts and wins Caroline's hand in marriage, despite her misgivings about her reception in English society.\nTrevelyan receives word that Colonel Osborne has dared to visit Emily once again. While Osborne had not been permitted to see Emily, Trevelyan does not believe it and has the boy taken away from his mother by deception; he takes his son back to Italy, where he descends further into madness. Eventually, he is tracked down by his wife and friends. Emily persuades him first to give her their son, then to return with her to England; he dies, however, shortly after their return. In his dying moments, Emily begs Louis to kiss her hand to signify that he does not believe she did anything wrong. Whether or not he does is unclear, but Emily believes \"the verdict of the dying man had been given in her favour.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, He Knew He Was Right, by Anthony Trollope,\nIllustrated by Marcus Stone\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Sir Marmaduke Rowley,\nat this period of his life, was a respectable middle-aged public\nservant, in good repute, who had, however, as yet achieved for\nhimself neither an exalted position nor a large fortune. He had been\ngovernor of many islands, and had never lacked employment; and now,\nat the age of fifty, found himself at the Mandarins, with a salary\nof \u00c2\u00a33,000 a year, living in a temperature at which 80\u00c2\u00b0 in the shade\nis considered to be cool, with eight daughters, and not a shilling\nsaved. A governor at the Mandarins who is social by nature and\nhospitable on principle, cannot save money in the islands even on\n\u00c2\u00a33,000 a year when he has eight daughters. And at the Mandarins,\nthough hospitality is a duty, the gentlemen who ate Sir Rowley's\ndinners were not exactly the men whom he or Lady Rowley desired to\nwelcome to their bosoms as sons-in-law. Nor when Mr. Trevelyan came\nthat way, desirous of seeing everything in the somewhat indefinite\ncourse of his travels, had Emily Rowley, the eldest of the flock,\nthen twenty years of age, seen as yet any Mandariner who exactly came\nup to her fancy. And, as Louis Trevelyan was a remarkably handsome\nyoung man, who was well connected, who had been ninth wrangler at\nCambridge, who had already published a volume of poems, and who\npossessed \u00c2\u00a33,000 a year of his own, arising from various perfectly\nsecure investments, he was not forced to sigh long in vain. Indeed,\nthe Rowleys, one and all, felt that providence had been very good to\nthem in sending young Trevelyan on his travels in that direction, for\nhe seemed to be a very pearl among men. Both Sir Marmaduke and Lady\nRowley felt that there might be objections to such a marriage as that\nproposed to them, raised by the Trevelyan family. Lady Rowley would\nnot have liked her daughter to go to England, to be received with\ncold looks by strangers. But it soon appeared that there was no one\nto make objections. Louis, the lover, had no living relative nearer\nthan cousins. His father, a barrister of repute, had died a widower,\nand had left the money which he had made to an only child. The head\nof the family was a first cousin who lived in Cornwall on a moderate\nproperty,--a very good sort of stupid fellow, as Louis said, who\nwould be quite indifferent as to any marriage that his cousin might\nmake. No man could be more independent or more clearly justified in\npleasing himself than was this lover. And then he himself proposed\nthat the second daughter, Nora, should come and live with them in\nLondon. What a lover to fall suddenly from the heavens into such a\ndovecote!\n\n\"I haven't a penny-piece to give to either of them,\" said Sir Rowley.\n\n\"It is my idea that girls should not have fortunes,\" said Trevelyan.\n\"At any rate, I am quite sure that men should never look for money.\nA man must be more comfortable, and, I think, is likely to be more\naffectionate, when the money has belonged to himself.\"\n\nSir Rowley was a high-minded gentleman, who would have liked to have\nhanded over a few thousand pounds on giving up his daughters; but,\nhaving no thousands of pounds to hand over, he could not but admire\nthe principles of his proposed son-in-law. As it was about time for\nhim to have his leave of absence, he and sundry of the girls went to\nEngland with Mr. Trevelyan, and the wedding was celebrated in London\nby the Rev. Oliphant Outhouse, of Saint Diddulph-in-the-East, who\nhad married Sir Rowley's sister. Then a small house was taken and\nfurnished in Curzon Street, Mayfair, and the Rowleys went back to the\nseat of their government, leaving Nora, the second girl, in charge of\nher elder sister.\n\nThe Rowleys had found, on reaching London, that they had lighted upon\na pearl indeed. Louis Trevelyan was a man of whom all people said\nall good things. He might have been a fellow of his college had he\nnot been a man of fortune. He might already,--so Sir Rowley was\ntold,--have been in Parliament, had he not thought it to be wiser to\nwait awhile. Indeed, he was very wise in many things. He had gone\nout on his travels thus young,--not in search of excitement, to kill\nbeasts, or to encounter he knew not what novelty and amusement,--but\nthat he might see men and know the world. He had been on his travels\nfor more than a year when the winds blew him to the Mandarins. Oh,\nhow blessed were the winds! And, moreover, Sir Rowley found that his\nson-in-law was well spoken of at the clubs by those who had known him\nduring his university career, as a man popular as well as wise, not\na book-worm, or a dry philosopher, or a prig. He could talk on all\nsubjects, was very generous, a man sure to be honoured and respected;\nand then such a handsome, manly fellow, with short brown hair, a nose\ndivinely chiselled, an Apollo's mouth, six feet high, with shoulders\nand legs and arms in proportion,--a pearl of pearls! Only, as Lady\nRowley was the first to find out, he liked to have his own way.\n\n\"But his way is such a good way,\" said Sir Marmaduke. \"He will be\nsuch a good guide for the girls!\"\n\n\"But Emily likes her way too,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\nSir Marmaduke argued the matter no further, but thought, no doubt,\nthat such a husband as Louis Trevelyan was entitled to have his own\nway. He probably had not observed his daughter's temper so accurately\nas his wife had done. With eight of them coming up around him, how\nshould he have observed their tempers? At any rate, if there were\nanything amiss with Emily's temper, it would be well that she should\nfind her master in such a husband as Louis Trevelyan.\n\nFor nearly two years the little household in Curzon Street went on\nwell, or if anything was the matter no one outside of the little\nhousehold was aware of it. And there was a baby, a boy, a young\nLouis, and a baby in such a household is apt to make things go\nsweetly.\n\nThe marriage had taken place in July, and after the wedding tour\nthere had been a winter and a spring in London; and then they passed\na month or two at the sea-side, after which the baby had been born.\nAnd then there came another winter and another spring. Nora Rowley\nwas with them in London, and by this time Mr. Trevelyan had begun to\nthink that he should like to have his own way completely. His baby\nwas very nice, and his wife was clever, pretty, and attractive. Nora\nwas all that an unmarried sister should be. But,--but there had come\nto be trouble and bitter words. Lady Rowley had been right when she\nsaid that her daughter Emily also liked to have her own way.\n\n\"If I am suspected,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan to her sister one morning,\nas they sat together in the little back drawing-room, \"life will not\nbe worth having.\"\n\n\"How can you talk of being suspected, Emily?\"\n\n\"What does he mean then by saying that he would rather not have\nColonel Osborne here? A man older than my own father, who has known\nme since I was a baby!\"\n\n\"He didn't mean anything of that kind, Emily. You know he did not,\nand you should not say so. It would be too horrible to think of.\"\n\n\"It was a great deal too horrible to be spoken, I know. If he does\nnot beg my pardon, I shall,--I shall continue to live with him, of\ncourse, as a sort of upper servant, because of baby. But he shall\nknow what I think and feel.\"\n\n\"If I were you I would forget it.\"\n\n\"How can I forget it? Nothing that I can do pleases him. He is civil\nand kind to you because he is not your master; but you don't know\nwhat things he says to me. Am I to tell Colonel Osborne not to come?\nHeavens and earth! How should I ever hold up my head again if I were\ndriven to do that? He will be here to-day I have no doubt; and Louis\nwill sit there below in the library, and hear his step, and will not\ncome up.\"\n\n\"Tell Richard to say you are not at home.\"\n\n\"Yes; and everybody will understand why. And for what am I to deny\nmyself in that way to the best and oldest friend I have? If any such\norders are to be given, let him give them and then see what will come\nof it.\"\n\nMrs. Trevelyan had described Colonel Osborne truly as far as words\nwent, in saying that he had known her since she was a baby, and that\nhe was an older man than her father. Colonel Osborne's age exceeded\nher father's by about a month, and as he was now past fifty, he might\nbe considered perhaps, in that respect, to be a safe friend for a\nyoung married woman. But he was in every respect a man very different\nfrom Sir Marmaduke. Sir Marmaduke, blessed and at the same time\nburdened as he was with a wife and eight daughters, and condemned as\nhe had been to pass a large portion of his life within the tropics,\nhad become at fifty what many people call quite a middle-aged man.\nThat is to say, he was one from whom the effervescence and elasticity\nand salt of youth had altogether passed away. He was fat and slow,\nthinking much of his wife and eight daughters, thinking much also of\nhis dinner. Now Colonel Osborne was a bachelor, with no burdens but\nthose imposed upon him by his position as a member of Parliament,--a\nman of fortune to whom the world had been very easy. It was not\ntherefore said so decidedly of him as of Sir Marmaduke, that he\nwas a middle-aged man, although he had probably already lived more\nthan two-thirds of his life. And he was a good-looking man of his\nage, bald indeed at the top of his head, and with a considerable\nsprinkling of grey hair through his bushy beard; but upright in his\ncarriage, active, and quick in his step, who dressed well, and was\nclearly determined to make the most he could of what remained to him\nof the advantages of youth. Colonel Osborne was always so dressed\nthat no one ever observed the nature of his garments, being no doubt\nwell aware that no man after twenty-five can afford to call special\nattention to his coat, his hat, his cravat, or his trousers; but\nnevertheless the matter was one to which he paid much attention, and\nhe was by no means lax in ascertaining what his tailor did for him.\nHe always rode a pretty horse, and mounted his groom on one at any\nrate as pretty. He was known to have an excellent stud down in the\nshires, and had the reputation of going well with hounds. Poor Sir\nMarmaduke could not have ridden a hunt to save either his government\nor his credit. When, therefore, Mrs. Trevelyan declared to her sister\nthat Colonel Osborne was a man whom she was entitled to regard with\nsemi-parental feelings of veneration because he was older than her\nfather, she made a comparison which was more true in the letter than\nin the spirit. And when she asserted that Colonel Osborne had known\nher since she was a baby, she fell again into the same mistake.\nColonel Osborne had indeed known her when she was a baby, and had in\nold days been the very intimate friend of her father; but of herself\nhe had seen little or nothing since those baby days, till he had met\nher just as she was about to become Mrs. Trevelyan; and though it was\nnatural that so old a friend should come to her and congratulate her\nand renew his friendship, nevertheless it was not true that he made\nhis appearance in her husband's house in the guise of the useful old\nfamily friend, who gives silver cups to the children and kisses the\nlittle girls for the sake of the old affection which he has borne for\nthe parents. We all know the appearance of that old gentleman, how\npleasant and dear a fellow he is, how welcome is his face within the\ngate, how free he makes with our wine, generally abusing it, how he\ntells our eldest daughter to light his candle for him, how he gave\nsilver cups when the girls were born, and now bestows tea-services as\nthey get married,--a most useful, safe, and charming fellow, not a\nyear younger-looking or more nimble than ourselves, without whom life\nwould be very blank. We all know that man; but such a man was not\nColonel Osborne in the house of Mr. Trevelyan's young bride.\n\nEmily Rowley, when she was brought home from the Mandarin Islands\nto be the wife of Louis Trevelyan, was a very handsome young woman,\ntall, with a bust rather full for her age, with dark eyes--eyes that\nlooked to be dark because her eye-brows and eye-lashes were nearly\nblack, but which were in truth so varying in colour, that you could\nnot tell their hue. Her brown hair was very dark and very soft; and\nthe tint of her complexion was brown also, though the colour of her\ncheeks was often so bright as to induce her enemies to say falsely of\nher that she painted them. And she was very strong, as are some girls\nwho come from the tropics, and whom a tropical climate has suited.\nShe could sit on her horse the whole day long, and would never be\nweary with dancing at the Government House balls. When Colonel\nOsborne was introduced to her as the baby whom he had known, he\nthought it would be very pleasant to be intimate with so pleasant a\nfriend,--meaning no harm indeed, as but few men do mean harm on such\noccasions,--but still, not regarding the beautiful young woman whom\nhe had seen as one of a generation succeeding to that of his own, to\nwhom it would be his duty to make himself useful on account of the\nold friendship which he bore to her father.\n\nIt was, moreover, well known in London,--though not known at all\nto Mrs. Trevelyan,--that this ancient Lothario had before this\nmade himself troublesome in more than one family. He was fond of\nintimacies with married ladies, and perhaps was not averse to the\nexcitement of marital hostility. It must be remembered, however, that\nthe hostility to which allusion is here made was not the hostility\nof the pistol or the horsewhip,--nor, indeed, was it generally the\nhostility of a word of spoken anger. A young husband may dislike\nthe too-friendly bearing of a friend, and may yet abstain from that\noutrage on his own dignity and on his wife, which is conveyed by a\nword of suspicion. Louis Trevelyan having taken a strong dislike to\nColonel Osborne, and having failed to make his wife understand that\nthis dislike should have induced her to throw cold water upon the\nColonel's friendship, had allowed himself to speak a word which\nprobably he would have willingly recalled as soon as spoken. But\nwords spoken cannot be recalled, and many a man and many a woman who\nhas spoken a word at once regretted, are far too proud to express\nthat regret. So it was with Louis Trevelyan when he told his wife\nthat he did not wish Colonel Osborne to come so often to his house.\nHe had said it with a flashing eye and an angry tone; and though she\nhad seen the eye flash before, and was familiar with the angry tone,\nshe had never before felt herself to be insulted by her husband. As\nsoon as the word had been spoken Trevelyan had left the room, and had\ngone down among his books. But when he was alone, he knew that he\nhad insulted his wife. He was quite aware that he should have spoken\nto her gently, and have explained to her, with his arm round her\nwaist, that it would be better for both of them that this friend's\nfriendship should be limited. There is so much in a turn of the eye\nand in the tone given to a word when such things have to be said,--so\nmuch more of importance than in the words themselves. As Trevelyan\nthought of this, and remembered what his manner had been, how much\nanger he had expressed, how far he had been from having his arm round\nhis wife's waist as he spoke to her, he almost made up his mind to\ngo up-stairs and to apologise. But he was one to whose nature the\ngiving of any apology was repulsive. He could not bear to have to own\nhimself to have been wrong. And then his wife had been most provoking\nin her manner to him. When he had endeavoured to make her understand\nhis wishes by certain disparaging hints which he had thrown out as to\nColonel Osborne, saying that he was a dangerous man, one who did not\nshow his true character, a snake in the grass, a man without settled\nprinciples, and such like, his wife had taken up the cudgels for her\nfriend, and had openly declared that she did not believe a word of\nthe things that were alleged against him. \"But still, for all that,\nit is true,\" the husband had said. \"I have no doubt that you think\nso,\" the wife had replied. \"Men do believe evil of one another, very\noften. But you must excuse me if I say that I think you are mistaken.\nI have known Colonel Osborne much longer than you have done, Louis,\nand papa has always had the highest opinion of him.\" Then Mr.\nTrevelyan had become very angry, and had spoken those words which\nhe could not recall. As he walked to and fro among his books\ndown-stairs, he almost felt that he ought to beg his wife's pardon.\nHe knew his wife well enough to be sure that she would not forgive\nhim unless he did so. He would do so, he thought, but not exactly\nnow. A moment would come in which it might be easier than at present.\nHe would be able to assure her when he went up to dress for dinner,\nthat he had meant no harm. They were going out to dine at the house\nof a lady of rank, the Countess Dowager of Milborough, a lady\nstanding high in the world's esteem, of whom his wife stood a little\nin awe; and he calculated that this feeling, if it did not make his\ntask easy would yet take from it some of its difficulty. Emily would\nbe, not exactly cowed, by the prospect of Lady Milborough's dinner,\nbut perhaps a little reduced from her usual self-assertion. He would\nsay a word to her when he was dressing, assuring her that he had not\nintended to animadvert in the slightest degree upon her own conduct.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Shewing how wrath began.]\n\n\nLuncheon was served, and the two ladies went down into the\ndining-room. Mr. Trevelyan did not appear. There was nothing in\nitself singular in that, as he was accustomed to declare that\nluncheon was a meal too much in the day, and that a man should eat\nnothing beyond a biscuit between breakfast and dinner. But he would\nsometimes come in and eat his biscuit standing on the hearth-rug,\nand drink what he would call half a quarter of a glass of sherry. It\nwould probably have been well that he should have done so now; but\nhe remained in his library behind the dining-room, and when his wife\nand his sister-in-law had gone up-stairs, he became anxious to learn\nwhether Colonel Osborne would come on that day, and, if so, whether\nhe would be admitted. He had been told that Nora Rowley was to be\ncalled for by another lady, a Mrs. Fairfax, to go out and look at\npictures. His wife had declined to join Mrs. Fairfax's party, having\ndeclared that, as she was going to dine out, she would not leave\nher baby all the afternoon. Louis Trevelyan, though he strove to\napply his mind to an article which he was writing for a scientific\nquarterly review, could not keep himself from anxiety as to this\nexpected visit from Colonel Osborne. He was not in the least jealous.\nHe swore to himself fifty times over that any such feeling on his\npart would be a monstrous injury to his wife. Nevertheless he knew\nthat he would be gratified if on that special day Colonel Osborne\nshould be informed that his wife was not at home. Whether the man\nwere admitted or not, he would beg his wife's pardon; but he could,\nhe thought, do so with more thorough efficacy and affection if she\nshould have shown a disposition to comply with his wishes on this\nday.\n\n\"Do say a word to Richard,\" said Nora to her sister in a whisper as\nthey were going up-stairs after luncheon.\n\n\"I will not,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"May I do it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Nora. I should feel that I were demeaning myself were\nI to allow what was said to me in such a manner to have any effect\nupon me.\"\n\n\"I think you are so wrong, Emily. I do indeed.\"\n\n\"You must allow me to be the best judge what to do in my own house,\nand with my own husband.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; certainly.\"\n\n\"If he gives me any command I will obey it. Or if he had expressed\nhis wish in any other words I would have complied. But to be told\nthat he would rather not have Colonel Osborne here! If you had seen\nhis manner and heard his words, you would not have been surprised\nthat I should feel it as I do. It was a gross insult,--and it was not\nthe first.\"\n\nAs she spoke the fire flashed from her eye, and the bright red colour\nof her cheek told a tale of her anger which her sister well knew how\nto read. Then there was a knock at the door, and they both knew that\nColonel Osborne was there. Louis Trevelyan, sitting in his library,\nalso knew of whose coming that knock gave notice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCOLONEL OSBORNE.\n\n\nIt has been already said that Colonel Osborne was a bachelor, a man\nof fortune, a member of Parliament, and one who carried his half\ncentury of years lightly on his shoulders. It will only be necessary\nto say further of him that he was a man popular with those among\nwhom he lived, as a politician, as a sportsman, and as a member\nof society. He could speak well in the House, though he spoke but\nseldom, and it was generally thought of him that he might have been\nsomething considerable, had it not suited him better to be nothing at\nall. He was supposed to be a Conservative, and generally voted with\nthe Conservative party; but he could boast that he was altogether\nindependent, and on an occasion would take the trouble of proving\nhimself to be so. He was in possession of excellent health; had all\nthat the world could give; was fond of books, pictures, architecture,\nand china; had various tastes, and the means of indulging them, and\nwas one of those few men on whom it seems that every pleasant thing\nhas been lavished. There was that little slur on his good name to\nwhich allusion has been made; but those who knew Colonel Osborne best\nwere generally willing to declare that no harm was intended, and\nthat the evils which arose were always to be attributed to mistaken\njealousy. He had, his friends said, a free and pleasant way with\nwomen which women like,--a pleasant way of free friendship; that\nthere was no more, and that the harm which had come had always\ncome from false suspicion. But there were certain ladies about the\ntown,--good, motherly, discreet women,--who hated the name of Colonel\nOsborne, who would not admit him within their doors, who would not\nbow to him in other people's houses, who would always speak of him as\na serpent, a hyena, a kite, or a shark. Old Lady Milborough was one\nof these, a daughter of a friend of hers having once admitted the\nserpent to her intimacy.\n\n\"Augustus Poole was wise enough to take his wife abroad,\" said old\nLady Milborough, discussing about this time with a gossip of hers\nthe danger of Mrs. Trevelyan's position, \"or there would have been a\nbreak-up there; and yet there never was a better girl in the world\nthan Jane Marriott.\"\n\nThe reader may be quite certain that Colonel Osborne had no\npremeditated evil intention when he allowed himself to become the\nintimate friend of his old friend's daughter. There was nothing\nfiendish in his nature. He was not a man who boasted of his\nconquests. He was not a ravening wolf going about seeking whom he\nmight devour, and determined to devour whatever might come in his\nway; but he liked that which was pleasant; and of all pleasant things\nthe company of a pretty clever woman was to him the pleasantest. At\nthis exact period of his life no woman was so pleasantly pretty to\nhim, and so agreeably clever, as Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nWhen Louis Trevelyan heard on the stairs the step of the dangerous\nman, he got up from his chair as though he too would have gone into\nthe drawing-room, and it would perhaps have been well had he done so.\nCould he have done this, and kept his temper with the man, he would\nhave paved the way for an easy reconciliation with his wife. But when\nhe reached the door of his room, and had placed his hand upon the\nlock, he withdrew again. He told himself he withdrew because he would\nnot allow himself to be jealous; but in truth he did so because he\nknew he could not have brought himself to be civil to the man he\nhated. So he sat down, and took up his pen, and began to cudgel\nhis brain about the scientific article. He was intent on raising a\ndispute with some learned pundit about the waves of sound,--but he\ncould think of no other sound than that of the light steps of Colonel\nOsborne as he had gone up-stairs. He put down his pen, and clenched\nhis fist, and allowed a black frown to settle upon his brow. What\nright had the man to come there, unasked by him, and disturb his\nhappiness? And then this poor wife of his, who knew so little of\nEnglish life, who had lived in the Mandarin Islands almost since she\nhad been a child, who had lived in one colony or another almost since\nshe had been born, who had had so few of those advantages for which\nhe should have looked in marrying a wife, how was the poor girl to\nconduct herself properly when subjected to the arts and practised\nvillanies of this viper? And yet the poor girl was so stiff in her\ntemper, had picked up such a trick of obstinacy in those tropical\nregions, that Louis Trevelyan felt that he did not know how to manage\nher. He too had heard how Jane Marriott had been carried off to\nNaples after she had become Mrs. Poole. Must he too carry off his\nwife to Naples in order to place her out of the reach of this hyena?\nIt was terrible to him to think that he must pack up everything and\nrun away from such a one as Colonel Osborne. And even were he to\nconsent to do this, how could he explain it all to that very wife for\nwhose sake he would do it? If she got a hint of the reason she would,\nhe did not doubt, refuse to go. As he thought of it, and as that\nvisit up-stairs prolonged itself, he almost thought it would be best\nfor him to be round with her! We all know what a husband means when\nhe resolves to be round with his wife. He began to think that he\nwould not apologise at all for the words he had spoken,--but would\nspeak them again somewhat more sharply than before. She would be\nvery wrathful with him; there would be a silent enduring indignation,\nwhich, as he understood well, would be infinitely worse than any\ntorrent of words. But was he, a man, to abstain from doing that which\nhe believed to be his duty because he was afraid of his wife's anger?\nShould he be deterred from saying that which he conceived it would\nbe right that he should say, because she was stiff-necked? No. He\nwould not apologise, but would tell her again that it was necessary,\nboth for his happiness and for hers, that all intimacy with Colonel\nOsborne should be discontinued.\n\nHe was brought to this strongly marital resolution by the length of\nthe man's present visit; by that and by the fact that, during the\nlatter portion of it, his wife was alone with Colonel Osborne. Nora\nhad been there when the man came, but Mrs. Fairfax had called, not\ngetting out of her carriage, and Nora had been constrained to go down\nto her. She had hesitated a moment, and Colonel Osborne had observed\nand partly understood the hesitation. When he saw it, had he been\nperfectly well-minded in the matter, he would have gone too. But he\nprobably told himself that Nora Rowley was a fool, and that in such\nmatters it was quite enough for a man to know that he did not intend\nany harm.\n\n\"You had better go down, Nora,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan; \"Mrs. Fairfax\nwill be ever so angry if you keep her waiting.\"\n\nThen Nora had gone and the two were alone together. Nora had gone,\nand Trevelyan had heard her as she was going and knew that Colonel\nOsborne was alone with his wife.\n\n\"If you can manage that it will be so nice,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan,\ncontinuing the conversation.\n\n\"My dear Emily,\" he said, \"you must not talk of my managing it, or\nyou will spoil it all.\"\n\nHe had called them both Emily and Nora when Sir Marmaduke and Lady\nRowley were with them before the marriage, and, taking the liberty of\na very old family friend, had continued the practice. Mrs. Trevelyan\nwas quite aware that she had been so called by him in the presence of\nher husband,--and that her husband had not objected. But that was now\nsome months ago, before baby was born; and she was aware also that\nhe had not called her so latterly in presence of her husband. She\nthoroughly wished that she knew how to ask him not to do so again;\nbut the matter was very difficult, as she could not make such a\nrequest without betraying some fear on her husband's part. The\nsubject which they were now discussing was too important to her\nto allow her to dwell upon this trouble at the moment, and so she\npermitted him to go on with his speech.\n\n\"If I were to manage it, as you call it,--which I can't do at\nall,--it would be a gross job.\"\n\n\"That's all nonsense to us, Colonel Osborne. Ladies always like\npolitical jobs, and think that they,--and they only,--make politics\nbearable. But this would not be a job at all. Papa could do it better\nthan anybody else. Think how long he has been at it!\"\n\nThe matter in discussion was the chance of an order being sent out to\nSir Marmaduke to come home from his islands at the public expense,\nto give evidence, respecting colonial government in general, to a\ncommittee of the House of Commons which was about to sit on the\nsubject. The committee had been voted, and two governors were to be\nbrought home for the purpose of giving evidence. What arrangement\ncould be so pleasant to a governor living in the Mandarin Islands,\nwho had had a holiday lately, and who could but ill afford to\ntake any holidays at his own expense? Colonel Osborne was on this\ncommittee, and, moreover, was on good terms at the Colonial Office.\nThere were men in office who would be glad to do Colonel Osborne a\nservice, and then if this were a job, it would be so very little of\na job! Perhaps Sir Marmaduke might not be the very best man for the\npurpose. Perhaps the government of the Mandarins did not afford the\nbest specimen of that colonial lore which it was the business of the\ncommittee to master. But then two governors were to come, and it\nmight be as well to have one of the best sort, and one of the second\nbest. No one supposed that excellent old Sir Marmaduke was a paragon\nof a governor, but then he had an infinity of experience! For over\ntwenty years he had been from island to island, and had at least\nsteered clear of great scrapes.\n\n\"We'll try it, at any rate,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"Do, Colonel Osborne. Mamma would come with him, of course?\"\n\n\"We should leave him to manage all that. It's not very likely that he\nwould leave Lady Rowley behind.\"\n\n\"He never has. I know he thinks more of mamma than he ever does of\nhimself. Fancy having them here in the autumn! I suppose if he came\nfor the end of the session, they wouldn't send him back quite at\nonce?\"\n\n\"I rather fancy that our foreign and colonial servants know how to\nstretch a point when they find themselves in England.\"\n\n\"Of course they do, Colonel Osborne; and why shouldn't they? Think of\nall that they have to endure out in those horrible places. How would\nyou like to live in the Mandarins?\"\n\n\"I should prefer London, certainly.\"\n\n\"Of course you would; and you mustn't begrudge papa a month or two\nwhen he comes. I never cared about your being in Parliament before,\nbut I shall think so much of you now if you can manage to get papa\nhome.\"\n\nThere could be nothing more innocent than this,--nothing more\ninnocent at any rate as regarded any offence against Mr. Trevelyan.\nBut just then there came a word which a little startled Mrs.\nTrevelyan, and made her feel afraid that she was doing wrong.\n\n\"I must make one stipulation with you, Emily,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"You must not tell your husband.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! and why not?\"\n\n\"I am sure you are sharp enough to see why you should not. A word of\nthis repeated at any club would put an end at once to your project,\nand would be very damaging to me. And, beyond that, I wouldn't wish\nhim to know that I had meddled with it at all. I am very chary of\nhaving my name connected with anything of the kind; and, upon my\nword, I wouldn't do it for any living human being but yourself.\nYou'll promise me, Emily?\"\n\nShe gave the promise, but there were two things in the matter, as it\nstood at present, which she did not at all like. She was very averse\nto having any secret from her husband with Colonel Osborne; and she\nwas not at all pleased at being told that he was doing for her a\nfavour that he would not have done for any other living human being.\nHad he said so to her yesterday, before those offensive words had\nbeen spoken by her husband, she would not have thought much about it.\nShe would have connected the man's friendship for herself with his\nvery old friendship for her father, and she would have regarded the\nassurance as made to the Rowleys in general, and not to herself in\nparticular. But now, after what had occurred, it pained her to be\ntold by Colonel Osborne that he would make, specially on her behalf,\na sacrifice of his political pride which he would make for no other\nperson living. And then, as he had called her by her Christian name,\nas he had exacted the promise, there had been a tone of affection in\nhis voice that she had almost felt to be too warm. But she gave the\npromise; and when he pressed her hand at parting, she pressed his\nagain, in token of gratitude for the kindness to be done to her\nfather and mother.\n\nImmediately afterwards Colonel Osborne went away, and Mrs. Trevelyan\nwas left alone in her drawing-room. She knew that her husband was\nstill down-stairs, and listened for a moment to hear whether he would\nnow come up to her. And he, too, had heard the Colonel's step as he\nwent, and for a few moments had doubted whether or no he would at\nonce go to his wife. Though he believed himself to be a man very firm\nof purpose, his mind had oscillated backwards and forwards within the\nlast quarter of an hour between those two purposes of being round\nwith his wife, and of begging her pardon for the words which he\nhad already spoken. He believed that he would best do his duty by\nthat plan of being round with her; but then it would be so much\npleasanter--at any rate, so much easier, to beg her pardon. But of\none thing he was quite certain, he must by some means exclude Colonel\nOsborne from his house. He could not live and continue to endure the\nfeelings which he had suffered while sitting down-stairs at his desk,\nwith the knowledge that Colonel Osborne was closeted with his wife\nup-stairs. It might be that there was nothing in it. That his wife\nwas innocent he was quite sure. But nevertheless, he was himself so\nmuch affected by some feeling which pervaded him in reference to this\nman, that all his energy was destroyed, and his powers of mind and\nbody were paralysed. He could not, and would not, stand it. Rather\nthan that he would follow Mr. Poole, and take his wife to Naples. So\nresolving, he put his hat on his head and walked out of the house. He\nwould have the advantage of the afternoon's consideration before he\ntook either the one step or the other.\n\nAs soon as he was gone Emily Trevelyan went up-stairs to her baby.\nShe would not stir as long as there had been a chance of his coming\nto her. She very much wished that he would come, and had made up her\nmind, in spite of the fierceness of her assertion to her sister, to\naccept any slightest hint at an apology which her husband might offer\nto her. To this state of mind she was brought by the consciousness of\nhaving a secret from him, and by a sense not of impropriety on her\nown part, but of conduct which some people might have called improper\nin her mode of parting from the man against whom her husband had\nwarned her. The warmth of that hand-pressing, and the affectionate\ntone in which her name had been pronounced, and the promise made to\nher, softened her heart towards her husband. Had he gone to her now\nand said a word to her in gentleness all might have been made right.\nBut he did not go to her.\n\n\"If he chooses to be cross and sulky, he may be cross and sulky,\"\nsaid Mrs. Trevelyan to herself as she went up to her baby.\n\n\"Has Louis been with you?\" Nora asked, as soon as Mrs. Fairfax had\nbrought her home.\n\n\"I have not seen him since you left me,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"I suppose he went out before Colonel Osborne?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. He waited till Colonel Osborne had gone, and then he\nwent himself; but he did not come near me. It is for him to judge of\nhis own conduct, but I must say that I think he is very foolish.\"\n\nThis the young wife said in a tone which clearly indicated that she\nhad judged her husband's conduct, and had found it to be very foolish\nindeed.\n\n\"Do you think that papa and mamma will really come?\" said Nora,\nchanging the subject of conversation.\n\n\"How can I tell? How am I to know? After all that has passed I am\nafraid to say a word lest I should be accused of doing wrong. But\nremember this, Nora, you are not to speak of it to any one.\"\n\n\"You will tell Louis?\"\n\n\"No; I will tell no one.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear Emily; pray do not keep anything secret from him.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by secret? There isn't any secret. Only in such\nmatters as that,--about politics,--no gentleman likes to have his\nname talked about!\"\n\nA look of great distress came upon Nora's face as she heard this. To\nher it seemed to be very bad that there should be a secret between\nher sister and Colonel Osborne to be kept from her brother-in-law.\n\n\"I suppose you will suspect me next?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, angrily.\n\n\"Emily, how can you say anything so cruel?\"\n\n\"You look as if you did.\"\n\n\"I only mean that I think it would be wiser to tell all this to\nLouis.\"\n\n\"How can I tell him Colonel Osborne's private business, when Colonel\nOsborne has desired me not to do so. For whose sake is Colonel\nOsborne doing this? For papa's and mamma's! I suppose Louis won't\nbe--jealous, because I want to have papa and mamma home. It would not\nbe a bit less unreasonable than the other.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nLADY MILBOROUGH'S DINNER PARTY.\n\n\nLouis Trevelyan went down to his club in Pall Mall, the Acrobats, and\nthere heard a rumour that added to his anger against Colonel Osborne.\nThe Acrobats was a very distinguished club, into which it was now\ndifficult for a young man to find his way, and almost impossible\nfor a man who was no longer young, and therefore known to many. It\nhad been founded some twenty years since with the idea of promoting\nmuscular exercise and gymnastic amusements; but the promoters had\nbecome fat and lethargic, and the Acrobats spent their time mostly in\nplaying whist, and in ordering and eating their dinners. There were\nsupposed to be, in some out-of-the-way part of the building, certain\npoles and sticks and parallel bars with which feats of activity might\nbe practised, but no one ever asked for them now-a-days, and a man,\nwhen he became an Acrobat, did so with a view either to the whist or\nthe cook, or possibly to the social excellences of the club. Louis\nTrevelyan was an Acrobat;--as was also Colonel Osborne.\n\n\"So old Rowley is coming home,\" said one distinguished Acrobat to\nanother in Trevelyan's hearing.\n\n\"How the deuce is he managing that? He was here a year ago?\"\n\n\"Osborne is getting it done. He is to come as a witness for this\ncommittee. It must be no end of a lounge for him. It doesn't count as\nleave, and he has every shilling paid for him, down to his cab-fares\nwhen he goes out to dinner. There's nothing like having a friend at\nCourt.\"\n\nSuch was the secrecy of Colonel Osborne's secret! He had been so\nchary of having his name mentioned in connection with a political\njob, that he had found it necessary to impose on his young friend\nthe burden of a secret from her husband, and yet the husband heard\nthe whole story told openly at his club on the same day! There was\nnothing in the story to anger Trevelyan had he not immediately felt\nthat there must be some plan in the matter between his wife and\nColonel Osborne, of which he had been kept ignorant. Hitherto,\nindeed, his wife, as the reader knows, could not have told him. He\nhad not seen her since the matter had been discussed between her and\nher friend. But he was angry because he first learned at his club\nthat which he thought he ought to have learned at home.\n\nAs soon as he reached his house he went at once to his wife's room,\nbut her maid was with her, and nothing could be said at that moment.\nHe then dressed himself, intending to go to Emily as soon as the girl\nhad left her; but the girl remained,--was, as he believed, kept in\nthe room purposely by his wife, so that he should have no moment of\nprivate conversation. He went down-stairs, therefore, and found Nora\nstanding by the drawing-room fire.\n\n\"So you are dressed first to-day?\" he said. \"I thought your turn\nalways came last.\"\n\n\"Emily sent Jenny to me first to-day because she thought you would be\nhome, and she didn't go up to dress till the last minute.\"\n\nThis was intended well by Nora, but it did not have the desired\neffect. Trevelyan, who had no command over his own features, frowned,\nand showed that he was displeased. He hesitated a moment, thinking\nwhether he would ask Nora any question as to this report about her\nfather and mother; but, before he had spoken, his wife was in the\nroom.\n\n\"We are all late, I fear,\" said Emily.\n\n\"You, at any rate, are the last,\" said her husband.\n\n\"About half a minute,\" said the wife.\n\nThen they got into the hired brougham which was standing at the door.\n\nTrevelyan, in the sweet days of his early confidence with his wife,\nhad offered to keep a carriage for her, explaining to her that the\nluxury, though costly, would not be beyond his reach. But she had\npersuaded him against the carriage, and there had come to be an\nagreement that instead of the carriage there should always be an\nautumn tour. \"One learns something from going about; but one learns\nnothing from keeping a carriage,\" Emily had said. Those had been\nhappy days, in which it had been intended that everything should\nalways be rose-coloured. Now he was meditating whether, in lieu of\nthat autumn tour, it would not be necessary to take his wife away to\nNaples altogether, so that she might be removed from the influence\nof--of--of--; no, not even to himself would he think of Colonel\nOsborne as his wife's lover. The idea was too horrible! And yet, how\ndreadful was it that he should have, for any reason, to withdraw her\nfrom the influence of any man!\n\nLady Milborough lived ever so far away, in Eccleston Square, but\nTrevelyan did not say a single word to either of his companions\nduring the journey. He was cross and vexed, and was conscious that\nthey knew that he was cross and vexed. Mrs. Trevelyan and her sister\ntalked to each other the whole way, but they did so in that tone\nwhich clearly indicates that the conversation is made up, not for any\ninterest attached to the questions asked or the answers given, but\nbecause it is expedient that there should not be silence. Nora said\nsomething about Marshall and Snellgrove, and tried to make believe\nthat she was very anxious for her sister's answer. And Emily said\nsomething about the opera at Covent Garden, which was intended\nto show that her mind was quite at ease. But both of them failed\naltogether, and knew that they failed. Once or twice Trevelyan\nthought that he would say a word in token, as it were, of repentance.\nLike the naughty child who knew that he was naughty, he was trying to\nbe good. But he could not do it. The fiend was too strong within him.\nShe must have known that there was a proposition for her father's\nreturn through Colonel Osborne's influence. As that man at the club\nhad heard it, how could she not have known it? When they got out at\nLady Milborough's door he had spoken to neither of them.\n\nThere was a large dull party, made up mostly of old people. Lady\nMilborough and Trevelyan's mother had been bosom friends, and\nLady Milborough had on this account taken upon herself to be much\ninterested in Trevelyan's wife. But Louis Trevelyan himself, in\ndiscussing Lady Milborough with Emily, had rather turned his mother's\nold friend into ridicule, and Emily had, of course, followed her\nhusband's mode of thinking. Lady Milborough had once or twice given\nher some advice on small matters, telling her that this or that air\nwould be good for her baby, and explaining that a mother during a\ncertain interesting portion of her life, should refresh herself\nwith a certain kind of malt liquor. Of all counsel on such domestic\nsubjects Mrs. Trevelyan was impatient,--as indeed it was her nature\nto be in all matters, and consequently, authorized as she had been\nby her husband's manner of speaking of his mother's friend, she\nhad taken a habit of quizzing Lady Milborough behind her back,\nand almost of continuing the practice before the old lady's face.\nLady Milborough, who was the most affectionate old soul alive,\nand good-tempered with her friends to a fault, had never resented\nthis, but had come to fear that Mrs. Trevelyan was perhaps a little\nflighty. She had never as yet allowed herself to say anything worse\nof her young friend's wife than that. And she would always add that\nthat kind of thing would cure itself as the nursery became full. It\nmust be understood therefore that Mrs. Trevelyan was not anticipating\nmuch pleasure from Lady Milborough's party, and that she had accepted\nthe invitation as a matter of duty.\n\nThere was present among the guests a certain Honourable Charles\nGlascock, the eldest son of Lord Peterborough, who made the\naffair more interesting to Nora than it was to her sister. It had\nbeen whispered into Nora's ears, by more than one person,--and\namong others by Lady Milborough, whose own daughters were all\nmarried,--that she might, if she thought fit, become the Honourable\nMrs. Charles Glascock. Now, whether she might think fit, or\nwhether she might not, the presence of the gentleman under such\ncircumstances, as far as she was concerned, gave an interest to the\nevening. And as Lady Milborough took care that Mr. Glascock should\ntake Nora down to dinner, the interest was very great. Mr. Glascock\nwas a good-looking man, just under forty, in Parliament, heir to\na peerage, and known to be well off in respect to income. Lady\nMilborough and Mrs. Trevelyan had told Nora Rowley that should\nencouragement in that direction come in her way, she ought to allow\nherself to fall in love with Mr. Glascock. A certain amount of\nencouragement had come in her way, but she had not as yet allowed\nherself to fall in love with Mr. Glascock. It seemed to her that Mr.\nGlascock was quite conscious of the advantages of his own position,\nand that his powers of talking about other matters than those with\nwhich he was immediately connected were limited. She did believe that\nhe had in truth paid her the compliment of falling in love with her,\nand this is a compliment to which few girls are indifferent. Nora\nmight perhaps have tried to fall in love with Mr. Glascock, had she\nnot been forced to make comparisons between him and another. This\nother one had not fallen in love with her, as she well knew; and she\ncertainly had not fallen in love with him. But still, the comparison\nwas forced upon her, and it did not result in favour of Mr. Glascock.\nOn the present occasion Mr. Glascock as he sat next to her almost\nproposed to her.\n\n\"You have never seen Monkhams?\" he said. Monkhams was his father's\nseat, a very grand place in Worcestershire. Of course he knew very\nwell that she had never seen Monkhams. How should she have seen it?\n\n\"I have never been in that part of England at all,\" she replied.\n\n\"I should so like to show you Monkhams. The oaks there are the finest\nin the kingdom. Do you like oaks?\"\n\n\"Who does not like oaks? But we have none in the islands, and nobody\nhas ever seen so few as I have.\"\n\n\"I'll show you Monkhams some day. Shall I? Indeed, I hope that some\nday I may really show you Monkhams.\"\n\nNow when an unmarried man talks to a young lady of really showing her\nthe house in which it will be his destiny to live, he can hardly mean\nother than to invite her to live there with him. It must at least be\nhis purpose to signify that, if duly encouraged, he will so invite\nher. But Nora Rowley did not give Mr. Glascock much encouragement on\nthis occasion.\n\n\"I'm afraid it is not likely that anything will ever take me into\nthat part of the country,\" she said. There was something perhaps in\nher tone which checked Mr. Glascock, so that he did not then press\nthe invitation.\n\nWhen the ladies were up-stairs in the drawing-room, Lady Milborough\ncontrived to seat herself on a couch intended for two persons only,\nclose to Mrs. Trevelyan. Emily, thinking that she might perhaps hear\nsome advice about Guinness's stout, prepared herself to be saucy. But\nthe matter in hand was graver than that. Lady Milborough's mind was\nuneasy about Colonel Osborne.\n\n\"My dear,\" said she, \"was not your father very intimate with that\nColonel Osborne?\"\n\n\"He is very intimate with him, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; I thought I had heard so. That makes it of course natural\nthat you should know him.\"\n\n\"We have known him all our lives,\" said Emily, forgetting probably\nthat out of the twenty-three years and some months which she had\nhitherto lived, there had been a consecutive period of more than\ntwenty years in which she had never seen this man whom she had known\nall her life.\n\n\"That makes a difference, of course; and I don't mean to say anything\nagainst him.\"\n\n\"I hope not, Lady Milborough, because we are all especially fond of\nhim.\" This was said with so much of purpose, that poor, dear old Lady\nMilborough was stopped in her good work. She knew well the terrible\nstrait to which Augustus Poole had been brought with his wife,\nalthough nobody supposed that Poole's wife had ever entertained a\nwrong thought in her pretty little heart. Nevertheless he had been\ncompelled to break up his establishment, and take his wife to Naples,\nbecause this horrid Colonel would make himself at home in Mrs.\nPoole's drawing-room in Knightsbridge. Augustus Poole, with courage\nenough to take any man by the beard, had taking by the beard been\npossible, had found it impossible to dislodge the Colonel. He could\nnot do so without making a row which would have been disgraceful to\nhimself and injurious to his wife; and therefore he had taken Mrs.\nPoole to Naples. Lady Milborough knew the whole story, and thought\nthat she foresaw that the same thing was about to happen in the\ndrawing-room in Curzon Street. When she attempted to say a word to\nthe wife, she found herself stopped. She could not go on in that\nquarter after the reception with which the beginning of her word had\nbeen met. But perhaps she might succeed better with the husband.\nAfter all, her friendship was with the Trevelyan side, and not with\nthe Rowleys.\n\n\"My dear Louis,\" she said, \"I want to speak a word to you. Come\nhere.\" And then she led him into a distant corner, Mrs. Trevelyan\nwatching her all the while, and guessing why her husband was thus\ncarried away. \"I just want to give you a little hint, which I am sure\nI believe is quite unnecessary,\" continued Lady Milborough. Then she\npaused, but Trevelyan would not speak. She looked into his face, and\nsaw that it was black. But the man was the only child of her dearest\nfriend, and she persevered. \"Do you know I don't quite like that\nColonel Osborne coming so much to your house.\" The face before her\nbecame still blacker, but still the man said nothing. \"I dare say it\nis a prejudice on my part, but I have always disliked him. I think he\nis a dangerous friend;--what I call a snake in the grass. And though\nEmily's high good sense, and love for you, and general feelings on\nsuch a subject, are just what a husband must desire--Indeed, I am\nquite sure that the possibility of anything wrong has never entered\ninto her head. But it is the very purity of her innocence which makes\nthe danger. He is a bad man, and I would just say a word to her, if I\nwere you, to make her understand that his coming to her of a morning\nis not desirable. Upon my word, I believe there is nothing he likes\nso much as going about and making mischief between men and their\nwives.\"\n\nThus she delivered herself; and Louis Trevelyan, though he was sore\nand angry, could not but feel that she had taken the part of a\nfriend. All that she had said had been true; all that she had said\nto him he had said to himself more than once. He too hated the man.\nHe believed him to be a snake in the grass. But it was intolerably\nbitter to him that he should be warned about his wife's conduct by\nany living human being; that he, to whom the world had been so full\nof good fortune,--that he, who had in truth taught himself to think\nthat he deserved so much good fortune, should be made the subject of\ncare on behalf of his friend, because of danger between himself and\nhis wife! On the spur of the moment he did not know what answer to\nmake. \"He is not a man whom I like myself,\" he said.\n\n\"Just be careful, Louis, that is all,\" said Lady Milborough, and then\nshe was gone.\n\nTo be cautioned about his wife's conduct cannot be pleasant to any\nman, and it was very unpleasant to Louis Trevelyan. He, too, had been\nasked a question about Sir Marmaduke's expected visit to England\nafter the ladies had left the room. All the town had heard of it\nexcept himself. He hardly spoke another word that evening till the\nbrougham was announced; and his wife had observed his silence. When\nthey were seated in the carriage, he together with his wife and Nora\nRowley, he immediately asked a question about Sir Marmaduke. \"Emily,\"\nhe said, \"is there any truth in a report I hear that your father is\ncoming home?\" No answer was made, and for a moment or two there was\nsilence. \"You must have heard of it, then,\" he said. \"Perhaps you can\ntell me, Nora, as Emily will not reply. Have you heard anything of\nyour father's coming?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have heard of it,\" said Nora slowly.\n\n\"And why have I not been told?\"\n\n\"It was to be kept a secret,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan boldly.\n\n\"A secret from me; and everybody else knows it! And why was it to be\na secret?\"\n\n\"Colonel Osborne did not wish that it should be known,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan.\n\n\"And what has Colonel Osborne to do between you and your father in\nany matter with which I may not be made acquainted? I will have\nnothing more between you and Colonel Osborne. You shall not see\nColonel Osborne. Do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I hear you, Louis.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to obey me? By G----, you shall obey me. Remember\nthis, that I lay my positive order upon you, that you shall not see\nColonel Osborne again. You do not know it, perhaps, but you are\nalready forfeiting your reputation as an honest woman, and bringing\ndisgrace upon me by your familiarity with Colonel Osborne.\"\n\n\"Oh, Louis, do not say that!\" said Nora.\n\n\"You had better let him speak it all at once,\" said Emily.\n\n\"I have said what I have got to say. It is now only necessary that\nyou should give me your solemn assurance that you will obey me.\"\n\n\"If you have said all that you have to say, perhaps you will listen\nto me,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I will listen to nothing till you have given me your promise.\"\n\n\"Then I certainly shall not give it you.\"\n\n\"Dear Emily, pray, pray do what he tells you,\" said Nora.\n\n\"She has yet to learn that it is her duty to do as I tell her,\" said\nTrevelyan. \"And because she is obstinate, and will not learn from\nthose who know better than herself what a woman may do, and what she\nmay not, she will ruin herself, and destroy my happiness.\"\n\n\"I know that you have destroyed my happiness by your unreasonable\njealousy,\" said the wife. \"Have you considered what I must feel in\nhaving such words addressed to me by my husband? If I am fit to be\ntold that I must promise not to see any man living, I cannot be fit\nto be any man's wife.\" Then she burst out into an hysterical fit of\ntears, and in this condition she got out of the carriage, entered her\nhouse, and hurried up to her own room.\n\n\"Indeed, she has not been to blame,\" said Nora to Trevelyan on the\nstaircase.\n\n\"Why has there been a secret kept from me between her and this man;\nand that too, after I had cautioned her against being intimate with\nhim? I am sorry that she should suffer; but it is better that she\nshould suffer a little now, than that we should both suffer much\nby-and-by.\"\n\nNora endeavoured to explain to him the truth about the committee, and\nColonel Osborne's promised influence, and the reason why there was to\nbe a secret. But she was too much in a hurry to get to her sister to\nmake the matter plain, and he was too much angered to listen to her.\nHe shook his head when she spoke of Colonel Osborne's dislike to have\nhis name mentioned in connection with the matter. \"All the world\nknows it,\" he said with scornful laughter.\n\nIt was in vain that Nora endeavoured to explain to him that though\nall the world might know it, Emily herself had only heard of the\nproposition as a thing quite unsettled, as to which nothing at\npresent should be spoken openly. It was in vain to endeavour to make\npeace on that night. Nora hurried up to her sister, and found that\nthe hysterical tears had again given place to anger. She would not\nsee her husband, unless he would beg her pardon; and he would not see\nher unless she would give the promise he demanded. And the husband\nand wife did not see each other again on that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nHUGH STANBURY.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nIt has been already stated that Nora Rowley was not quite so well\ndisposed as perhaps she ought to have been, to fall in love with the\nHonourable Charles Glascock, there having come upon her the habit of\ncomparing him with another gentleman whenever this duty of falling in\nlove with Mr. Glascock was exacted from her. That other gentleman was\none with whom she knew that it was quite out of the question that she\nshould fall in love, because he had not a shilling in the world; and\nthe other gentleman was equally aware that it was not open to him to\nfall in love with Nora Rowley--for the same reason. In regard to such\nmatters Nora Rowley had been properly brought up, having been made\nto understand by the best and most cautious of mothers, that in that\nmatter of falling in love it was absolutely necessary that bread and\ncheese should be considered. \"Romance is a very pretty thing,\" Lady\nRowley had been wont to say to her daughters, \"and I don't think life\nwould be worth having without a little of it. I should be very sorry\nto think that either of my girls would marry a man only because he\nhad money. But you can't even be romantic without something to eat\nand drink.\" Nora thoroughly understood all this, and being well aware\nthat her fortune in the world, if it ever was to be made at all,\ncould only be made by marriage, had laid down for herself certain\nhard lines,--lines intended to be as fast as they were hard. Let\nwhat might come to her in the way of likings and dislikings, let the\ntemptation to her be ever so strong, she would never allow her heart\nto rest on a man who, if he should ask her to be his wife, would not\nhave the means of supporting her. There were many, she knew, who\nwould condemn such a resolution as cold, selfish, and heartless. She\nheard people saying so daily. She read in books that it ought to be\nso regarded. But she declared to herself that she would respect the\njudgment neither of the people nor of the books. To be poor alone, to\nhave to live without a husband, to look forward to a life in which\nthere would be nothing of a career, almost nothing to do, to await\nthe vacuity of an existence in which she would be useful to no one,\nwas a destiny which she could teach herself to endure, because it\nmight probably be forced upon her by necessity. Were her father to\ndie there would hardly be bread for that female flock to eat. As it\nwas, she was eating the bread of a man in whose house she was no more\nthan a visitor. The lot of a woman, as she often told herself, was\nwretched, unfortunate, almost degrading. For a woman such as herself\nthere was no path open to her energy, other than that of getting a\nhusband. Nora Rowley thought of all this till she was almost sick of\nthe prospect of her life,--especially sick of it when she was told\nwith much authority by the Lady Milboroughs of her acquaintance that\nit was her bounden duty to fall in love with Mr. Glascock. As to\nfalling in love with Mr. Glascock, she had not as yet quite made up\nher mind. There was so much to be said on that side of the question,\nif such falling in love could only be made possible. But she had\nquite made up her mind that she would never fall in love with a poor\nman. In spite, however, of all that, she felt herself compelled to\nmake comparisons between Mr. Glascock and one Mr. Hugh Stanbury, a\ngentleman who had not a shilling.\n\nMr. Hugh Stanbury had been at college the most intimate friend of\nLouis Trevelyan, and at Oxford had been, in spite of Trevelyan's\nsuccesses, a bigger man than his friend. Stanbury had not taken so\nhigh a degree as Trevelyan,--indeed had not gone out in honours at\nall. He had done little for the credit of his college, and had never\nput himself in the way of wrapping himself up for life in the scanty\nlambswool of a fellowship. But he had won for himself reputation as\na clever speaker, as a man who had learned much that college tutors\ndo not profess to teach, as a hard-headed, ready-witted fellow, who,\nhaving the world as an oyster before him, which it was necessary that\nhe should open, would certainly find either a knife or a sword with\nwhich to open it.\n\nImmediately on leaving college he had come to town, and had entered\nhimself at Lincoln's Inn. Now, at the time of our story, he was a\nbarrister of four years' standing, but had never yet made a guinea.\nHe had never made a guinea by his work as a barrister, and was\nbeginning to doubt of himself whether he ever would do so. Not, as he\nknew well, that guineas are generally made with ease by barristers\nof four years' standing, but because, as he said to his friends, he\ndid not see his way to the knack of it. He did not know an attorney\nin the world, and could not conceive how any attorney should ever\nbe induced to apply to him for legal aid. He had done his work of\nlearning his trade about as well as other young men, but had had no\nmeans of distinguishing himself within his reach. He went the Western\nCircuit because his aunt, old Miss Stanbury, lived at Exeter, but, as\nhe declared of himself, had he had another aunt living at York, he\nwould have had nothing whatsoever to guide him in his choice. He sat\nidle in the courts, and hated himself for so sitting. So it had been\nwith him for two years without any consolation or additional burden\nfrom other employment than that of his profession. After that, by\nsome chance, he had become acquainted with the editor of the Daily\nRecord, and by degrees had taken to the writing of articles. He had\nbeen told by all his friends, and especially by Trevelyan, that if\nhe did this, he might as well sell his gown and wig. He declared,\nin reply, that he had no objection to sell his gown and wig. He did\nnot see how he should ever make more money out of them than he would\ndo by such sale. But for the articles which he wrote, he received\ninstant payment, a process which he found to be most consolatory,\nmost comfortable, and, as he said to Trevelyan, as warm to him as a\nblanket in winter.\n\nTrevelyan, who was a year younger than Stanbury, had taken upon\nhimself to be very angry. He professed that he did not think much of\nthe trade of a journalist, and told Stanbury that he was sinking from\nthe highest to almost the lowest business by which an educated man\nand a gentleman could earn his bread. Stanbury had simply replied\nthat he saw some bread on the one side, but none on the other; and\nthat bread from some side was indispensable to him. Then there had\ncome to be that famous war between Great Britain and the republic\nof Patagonia, and Hugh Stanbury had been sent out as a special\ncorrespondent by the editor and proprietor of the Daily Record.\nHis letters had been much read, and had called up a great deal of\nnewspaper pugnacity. He had made important statements which had been\nflatly denied, and found to be utterly false; which again had been\nwarmly reasserted and proved to be most remarkably true to the\nletter. In this way the correspondence, and he as its author, became\nso much talked about that, on his return to England, he did actually\nsell his gown and wig and declare to his friends,--and to Trevelyan\namong the number,--that he intended to look to journalism for his\nfuture career.\n\nHe had been often at the house in Curzon Street in the earliest\nhappy days of his friend's marriage, and had thus become\nacquainted,--intimately acquainted,--with Nora Rowley. And now again,\nsince his return from Patagonia, that acquaintance had been renewed.\nQuite lately, since the actual sale of that wig and gown had been\neffected, he had not been there so frequently as before, because\nTrevelyan had expressed his indignation almost too openly.\n\n\"That such a man as you should be so faint-hearted,\" Trevelyan had\nsaid, \"is a thing that I can not understand.\"\n\n\"Is a man faint-hearted when he finds it improbable that he shall be\nable to leap his horse over a house?\"\n\n\"What you had to do had been done by hundreds before you.\"\n\n\"What I had to do has never yet been done by any man,\" replied\nStanbury. \"I had to live upon nothing till the lucky hour should\nstrike.\"\n\n\"I think you have been cowardly,\" said Trevelyan.\n\nEven this had made no quarrel between the two men; but Stanbury had\nexpressed himself annoyed by his friend's language, and partly on\nthat account, and partly perhaps on another, had stayed away from\nCurzon Street. As Nora Rowley had made comparisons about him, so had\nhe made comparisons about her. He had owned to himself that had it\nbeen possible that he should marry, he would willingly entrust his\nhappiness to Miss Rowley. And he had thought once or twice that\nTrevelyan had wished that such an arrangement might be made at some\nfuture day. Trevelyan had always been much more sanguine in expecting\nsuccess for his friend at the Bar, than Stanbury had been for\nhimself. It might well be that such a man as Trevelyan might think\nthat a clever rising barrister would be an excellent husband for his\nsister-in-law, but that a man earning a precarious living as a writer\nfor a penny paper would be by no means so desirable a connection.\nStanbury, as he thought of this, declared to himself that he would\nnot care two straws for Trevelyan in the matter, if he could see his\nway without other impediments. But the other impediments were there\nin such strength and numbers as to make him feel that it could not\nhave been intended by Fate that he should take to himself a wife.\nAlthough those letters of his to the Daily Record had been so\npre-eminently successful, he had never yet been able to earn by\nwriting above twenty-five or thirty pounds a month. If that might be\ncontinued to him he could live upon it himself; but, even with his\nmoderate views, it would not suffice for himself and family.\n\nHe had told Trevelyan that while living as an expectant barrister he\nhad no means of subsistence. In this, as Trevelyan knew, he was not\nstrictly correct. There was an allowance of \u00c2\u00a3100 a year coming to him\nfrom the aunt whose residence at Exeter had induced him to devote\nhimself to the Western Circuit. His father had been a clergyman with\na small living in Devonshire, and had now been dead some fifteen\nyears. His mother and two sisters were still living in a small\ncottage in his late father's parish, on the interest of the money\narising from a life insurance. Some pittance from sixty to seventy\npounds a year was all they had among them. But there was a rich aunt,\nMiss Stanbury, to whom had come considerable wealth in a manner most\nromantic,--the little tale shall be told before this larger tale\nis completed,--and this aunt had undertaken to educate and place\nout in the world her nephew Hugh. So Hugh had been sent to Harrow,\nand then to Oxford,--where he had much displeased his aunt by not\naccomplishing great things,--and then had been set down to make his\nfortune as a barrister in London, with an allowance of \u00c2\u00a3100 a year,\nhis aunt having paid, moreover, certain fees for entrance, tuition,\nand the like. The very hour in which Miss Stanbury learned that her\nnephew was writing for a penny newspaper she sent off a dispatch to\ntell him that he must give up her or the penny paper. He replied by\nsaying that he felt himself called upon to earn his bread in the only\nline from which, as it seemed to him, bread would be forthcoming. By\nreturn of post he got another letter to say that he might draw for\nthe quarter then becoming due, but that that would be the last. And\nit was the last.\n\nStanbury made an ineffectual effort to induce his aunt to make over\nthe allowance,--or at least a part of it,--to his mother and sisters,\nbut the old lady paid no attention whatever to the request. She never\nhad given, and at that moment did not intend to give, a shilling\nto the widow and daughters of her brother. Nor did she intend, or\nhad she ever intended, to leave a shilling of her money to Hugh\nStanbury,--as she had very often told him. The money was, at her\ndeath, to go back to the people from whom it had come to her.\n\nWhen Nora Rowley made those comparisons between Mr. Hugh Stanbury and\nMr. Charles Glascock, they were always wound up very much in favour\nof the briefless barrister. It was not that he was the handsomer man,\nfor he was by no means handsome, nor was he the bigger man, for Mr.\nGlascock was six feet tall; nor was he better dressed, for Stanbury\nwas untidy rather than otherwise in his outward person. Nor had\nhe any air of fashion or special grace to recommend him, for he\nwas undoubtedly an awkward-mannered man. But there was a glance of\nsunshine in his eye, and a sweetness in the curl of his mouth when he\nsmiled, which made Nora feel that it would have been all up with her\nhad she not made so very strong a law for her own guidance. Stanbury\nwas a man about five feet ten, with shoulders more than broad in\nproportion, stout limbed, rather awkward of his gait, with large feet\nand hands, with soft wavy light hair, with light grey eyes, with a\nbroad, but by no means ugly, nose. His mouth and lips were large, and\nhe rarely showed his teeth. He wore no other beard than whiskers,\nwhich he was apt to cut away through heaviness of his hand in\nshaving, till Nora longed to bid him be more careful. \"He doesn't\ncare what sort of a guy he makes of himself,\" she once said to her\nsister, almost angrily. \"He is a plain man, and he knows it,\" Emily\nhad replied. Mr. Trevelyan was doubtless a handsome man, and it was\nalmost on Nora's tongue to say something ill-natured on the subject.\nHugh Stanbury was reputed to be somewhat hot in spirit and manner. He\nwould be very sage in argument, pounding down his ideas on politics,\nreligion, or social life with his fist as well as his voice. He was\nquick, perhaps, at making antipathies, and quick, too, in making\nfriendships; impressionable, demonstrative, eager, rapid in his\nmovements,--sometimes to the great detriment of his shins and\nknuckles; and he possessed the sweetest temper that was ever given\nto a man for the blessing of a woman. This was the man between whom\nand Mr. Glascock Nora Rowley found it to be impossible not to make\ncomparisons.\n\nOn the very day after Lady Milborough's dinner party Stanbury\novertook Trevelyan in the street, and asked his friend where he was\ngoing eastward. Trevelyan was on his way to call upon his lawyer, and\nsaid so. But he did not say why he was going to his lawyer. He had\nsent to his wife by Nora that morning to know whether she would make\nto him the promise he required. The only answer which Nora could draw\nfrom her sister was a counter question, demanding whether he would\nask her pardon for the injury he had done her. Nora had been most\neager, most anxious, most conciliatory as a messenger; but no good\nhad come of these messages, and Trevelyan had gone forth to tell all\nhis trouble to his family lawyer. Old Mr. Bideawhile had been his\nfather's ancient and esteemed friend, and he could tell things to\nMr. Bideawhile which he could not bring himself to tell to any\nother living man; and he could generally condescend to accept Mr.\nBideawhile's advice, knowing that his father before him had been\nguided by the same.\n\n\"But you are out of your way for Lincoln's Inn Fields,\" said\nStanbury.\n\n\"I have to call at Twining's. And where are you going?\"\n\n\"I have been three times round St. James's Park to collect my\nthoughts,\" said Stanbury, \"and now I am on my way to the Daily R.,\n250, Fleet Street. It is my custom of an afternoon. I am prepared\nto instruct the British public of to-morrow on any subject, as per\norder, from the downfall of a European compact to the price of a\nLondon mutton chop.\"\n\n\"I suppose there is nothing more to be said about it,\" said\nTrevelyan, after a pause.\n\n\"Not another word. How should there be? Aunt Jemima has already drawn\ntight the purse strings, and it would soon be the casual ward in\nearnest if it were not for the Daily R. God bless the Daily R. Only\nthink what a thing it is to have all subjects open to one, from the\ndestinies of France to the profit proper to a butcher.\"\n\n\"If you like it!\"\n\n\"I do like it. It may not be altogether honest. I don't know what\nis. But it's a deal honester than defending thieves and bamboozling\njuries. How is your wife?\"\n\n\"She's pretty well, thank you.\"\n\nStanbury knew at once from the tone of his friend's voice that there\nwas something wrong.\n\n\"And Louis the less?\" he said, asking after Trevelyan's child.\n\n\"He's all right.\"\n\n\"And Miss Rowley? When one begins one's inquiries one is bound to go\nthrough the whole family.\"\n\n\"Miss Rowley is pretty well,\" said Trevelyan.\n\nPreviously to this, Trevelyan when speaking of his sister-in-law to\nStanbury, had always called her Nora, and had been wont to speak\nof her as though she were almost as much the friend of one of them\nas of the other. The change of tone on this occasion was in truth\noccasioned by the sadness of the man's thoughts in reference to his\nwife, but Stanbury attributed it to another cause. \"He need not be\nafraid of me,\" he said to himself, \"and at least he should not show\nme that he is.\" Then they parted, Trevelyan going into Twining's\nbank, and Stanbury passing on towards the office of the Daily R.\n\nStanbury had in truth been altogether mistaken as to the state of his\nfriend's mind on that morning. Trevelyan, although he had, according\nto his custom, put in a word in condemnation of the newspaper line of\nlife, was at the moment thinking whether he would not tell all his\ntrouble to Hugh Stanbury. He knew that he should not find anywhere,\nnot even in Mr. Bideawhile, a more friendly or more trustworthy\nlistener. When Nora Rowley's name had been mentioned, he had not\nthought of her. He had simply repeated the name with the usual\nanswer. He was at the moment cautioning himself against a confidence\nwhich after all might not be necessary, and which on this occasion\nwas not made. When one is in trouble it is a great ease to tell one's\ntrouble to a friend; but then one should always wash one's dirty\nlinen at home. The latter consideration prevailed, and Trevelyan\nallowed his friend to go on without burdening him with the story of\nthat domestic quarrel. Nor did he on that occasion tell it to Mr.\nBideawhile; for Mr. Bideawhile was not found at his chambers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nSHEWING HOW THE QUARREL PROGRESSED.\n\n\nTrevelyan got back to his own house at about three, and on going into\nthe library, found on his table a letter to him addressed in his\nwife's handwriting. He opened it quickly, hoping to find that promise\nwhich he had demanded, and resolving that if it were made he would at\nonce become affectionate, yielding, and gentle to his wife. But there\nwas not a word written by his wife within the envelope. It contained\nsimply another letter, already opened, addressed to her. This letter\nhad been brought up to her during her husband's absence from the\nhouse, and was as follows:--\n\n\n   Acrobats, Thursday.\n\n   DEAR EMILY,\n\n   I have just come from the Colonial Office. It is all\n   settled, and Sir M. has been sent for. Of course, you will\n   tell T. now.\n\n   Yours, F. O.\n\n\nThe letter was, of course, from Colonel Osborne, and Mrs. Trevelyan,\nwhen she received it, had had great doubts whether she would enclose\nit to her husband opened or unopened. She had hitherto refused to\nmake the promise which her husband exacted, but nevertheless, she was\nminded to obey him. Had he included in his demand any requirement\nthat she should receive no letter from Colonel Osborne, she would not\nhave opened this one. But nothing had been said about letters, and\nshe would not shew herself to be afraid. So she read the note, and\nthen sent it down to be put on Mr. Trevelyan's table in an envelope\naddressed to him.\n\n\"If he is not altogether blinded, it will show him how cruelly he has\nwronged me,\" said she to her sister. She was sitting at the time with\nher boy in her lap, telling herself that the child's features were in\nall respects the very same as his father's, and that, come what come\nmight, the child should always be taught by her to love and respect\nhis father. And then there came a horrible thought. What if the child\nshould be taken away from her? If this quarrel, out of which she saw\nno present mode of escape, were to lead to a separation between her\nand her husband, would not the law, and the judges, and the courts,\nand all the Lady Milboroughs of their joint acquaintance into the\nbargain, say that the child should go with his father? The judges,\nand the courts, and the Lady Milboroughs would, of course, say that\nshe was the sinner. And what could she do without her boy? Would not\nany humility, any grovelling in the dust be better for her than that?\n\"It is a very poor thing to be a woman,\" she said to her sister.\n\n\"It is perhaps better than being a dog,\" said Nora; \"but, of course,\nwe can't compare ourselves to men.\"\n\n\"It would be better to be a dog. One wouldn't be made to suffer so\nmuch. When a puppy is taken away from its mother, she is bad enough\nfor a few days, but she gets over it in a week.\" There was a pause\nthen for a few moments. Nora knew well which way ran the current of\nher sister's thoughts, and had nothing at the present moment which\nshe could say on that subject. \"It is very hard for a woman to know\nwhat to do,\" continued Emily, \"but if she is to marry, I think she\nhad better marry a fool. After all, a fool generally knows that he is\na fool, and will trust some one, though he may not trust his wife.\"\n\n\"I will never wittingly marry a fool,\" said Nora.\n\n\"You will marry Mr. Glascock, of course. I don't say that he is a\nfool; but I do not think he has that kind of strength which shows\nitself in perversity.\"\n\n\"If he asked me, I should not have him;--and he will never ask me.\"\n\n\"He will ask you, and, of course, you'll take him. Why not? You can't\nbe otherwise than a woman. And you must marry. And this man is a\ngentleman, and will be a peer. There is nothing on earth against him,\nexcept that he does not set the Thames on fire. Louis intends to set\nthe Thames on fire some day, and see what comes of it.\"\n\n\"All the same, I shall not marry Mr. Glascock. A woman can die, at\nany rate,\" said Nora.\n\n\"No, she can't. A woman must be decent; and to die of want is very\nindecent. She can't die, and she mustn't be in want, and she oughtn't\nto be a burden. I suppose it was thought necessary that every man\nshould have two to choose from; and therefore there are so many more\nof us than the world wants. I wonder whether you'd mind taking that\ndown-stairs to his table? I don't like to send it by the servant; and\nI don't want to go myself.\"\n\nThen Nora had taken the letter down, and left it where Louis\nTrevelyan would be sure to find it.\n\nHe did find it, and was sorely disappointed when he perceived that\nit contained no word from his wife to himself. He opened Colonel\nOsborne's note, and read it, and became, as he did so, almost more\nangry than before. Who was this man that he should dare to address\nanother man's wife as \"Dear Emily?\" At the moment Trevelyan\nremembered well enough that he had heard the man so call his wife,\nthat it had been done openly in his presence, and had not given him\na thought. But Lady Rowley and Sir Marmaduke had then been present\nalso; and that man on that occasion had been the old friend of the\nold father, and not the would-be young friend of the young daughter.\nTrevelyan could hardly reason about it, but felt that whereas the one\nwas not improper, the other was grossly impertinent, and even wicked.\nAnd then, again, his wife, his Emily, was to show to him, to her\nhusband, or was not to show to him, the letter which she received\nfrom this man, the letter in which she was addressed as \"Dear Emily,\"\naccording to this man's judgment and wish, and not according to his\njudgment and wish,--not according to the judgment and wish of him who\nwas her husband, her lord, and her master! \"Of course you will tell\nT. now.\" This was intolerable to him. It made him feel that he was\nto be regarded as second, and this man to be regarded as first. And\nthen he began to recapitulate all the good things he had done for his\nwife, and all the causes which he had given her for gratitude. Had\nhe not taken her to his bosom, and bestowed upon her the half of all\nthat he had simply for herself, asking for nothing more than her\nlove? He had possessed money, position, a name,--all that makes life\nworth having. He had found her in a remote corner of the world, with\nno fortune, with no advantages of family or social standing,--so\ncircumstanced that any friend would have warned him against such\na marriage; but he had given her his heart, and his hand, and his\nhouse, and had asked for nothing in return but that he should be all\nin all to her,--that he should be her one god upon earth. And he had\ndone more even than this. \"Bring your sister,\" he had said. \"The\nhouse shall be big enough for her also, and she shall be my sister as\nwell as yours.\" Who had ever done more for a woman, or shown a more\nabsolute confidence? And now what was the return he received? She was\nnot contented with her one god upon earth, but must make to herself\nother gods,--another god, and that too out of a lump of the basest\nclay to be found around her. He thought that he could remember to\nhave heard it said in early days, long before he himself had had\nan idea of marrying, that no man should look for a wife from among\nthe tropics, that women educated amidst the languors of those sunny\nclimes rarely came to possess those high ideas of conjugal duty and\nfeminine truth which a man should regard as the first requisites of a\ngood wife. As he thought of all this, he almost regretted that he had\never visited the Mandarins, or ever heard the name of Sir Marmaduke\nRowley.\n\nHe should have nourished no such thoughts in his heart. He had,\nindeed, been generous to his wife and to his wife's family; but we\nmay almost say that the man who is really generous in such matters,\nis unconscious of his own generosity. The giver who gives the most,\ngives, and does not know that he gives. And had not she given too?\nIn that matter of giving between a man and his wife, if each gives\nall, the two are equal, let the things given be what they may! King\nCophetua did nothing for his beggar maid, unless she were to him,\nafter he had married her, as royal a queen as though he had taken her\nfrom the oldest stock of reigning families then extant. Trevelyan\nknew all this himself,--had said so to himself a score of times,\nthough not probably in spoken words or formed sentences. But, that\nall was equal between himself and the wife of his bosom, had been\na thing ascertained by him as a certainty. There was no debt of\ngratitude from her to him which he did not acknowledge to exist also\nas from him to her. But yet, in his anger, he could not keep himself\nfrom thinking of the gifts he had showered upon her. And he had been,\nwas, would ever be, if she would only allow it, so true to her! He\nhad selected no other friend to take her place in his councils! There\nwas no \"dear Mary,\" or \"dear Augusta,\" with whom he had secrets to\nbe kept from his wife. When there arose with him any question of\ninterest,--question of interest such as was this of the return of Sir\nMarmaduke to her,--he would show it in all its bearings to his wife.\nHe had his secrets too, but his secrets had all been made secrets for\nher also. There was not a woman in the world in whose company he took\nspecial delight in her absence.\n\nAnd if there had been, how much less would have been her ground of\ncomplaint? Let a man have any such friendships,--what friendships he\nmay,--he does not disgrace his wife. He felt himself to be so true of\nheart that he desired no such friendships; but for a man indulging in\nsuch friendships there might be excuse. Even though a man be false,\na woman is not shamed and brought unto the dust before all the world.\nBut the slightest rumour on a woman's name is a load of infamy on\nher husband's shoulders. It was not enough for C\u00c3\u00a6sar that his wife\nshould be true; it was necessary to C\u00c3\u00a6sar that she should not even be\nsuspected. Trevelyan told himself that he suspected his wife of no\nsin. God forbid that it should ever come to that, both for his sake\nand for hers; and, above all, for the sake of that boy who was so\ndear to them both! But there would be the vile whispers, and dirty\nslanders would be dropped from envious tongues into envious ears, and\nminds prone to evil would think evil of him and of his. Had not Lady\nMilborough already cautioned him? Oh, that he should have lived to\nhave been cautioned about his wife;--that he should be told that eyes\noutside had looked into the sacred shrine of his heart and seen that\nthings there were fatally amiss! And yet Lady Milborough was quite\nright. Had he not in his hand at this moment a document that proved\nher to be right? \"Dear Emily!\" He took this note and crushed it in\nhis fist, and then pulled it into fragments.\n\nBut what should he do? There was, first of all considerations, the\nduty which he owed to his wife, and the love which he bore her.\nThat she was ignorant and innocent he was sure; but then she was so\ncontumacious that he hardly knew how to take a step in the direction\nof guarding her from the effects of her ignorance, and maintaining\nfor her the advantages of her innocence. He was her master, and she\nmust know that he was her master. But how was he to proceed when she\nrefused to obey the plainest and most necessary command which he laid\nupon her? Let a man be ever so much his wife's master, he cannot\nmaintain his masterdom by any power which the law places in his\nhands. He had asked his wife for a promise of obedience, and she\nwould not give it to him! What was he to do next? He could, no\ndoubt,--at least he thought so,--keep the man from her presence. He\ncould order the servant not to admit the man, and the servant would\ndoubtless obey him. But to what a condition would he then have been\nbrought! Would not the world then be over for him,--over for him as\nthe husband of a wife whom he could not love unless he respected her?\nBetter that there should be no such world, than call in the aid of a\nservant to guard the conduct of his wife!\n\nAs he thought of it all it seemed to him that if she would not obey\nhim, and give him this promise, they must be separated. He would not\nlive with her, he would not give her the privileges of his wife, if\nshe refused to render to him the obedience which was his privilege.\nThe more he thought of it, the more convinced he was that he ought\nnot to yield to her. Let her once yield to him, and then his\ntenderness should begin, and there should be no limit to it. But he\nwould not see her till she had yielded. He would not see her; and if\nhe should find that she did see Colonel Osborne, then he would tell\nher that she could no longer dwell under the same roof with him.\n\nHis resolution on these points was very strong, and yet there came\nover him a feeling that it was his duty to be gentle. There was a\nfeeling also that that privilege of receiving obedience, which was\nso indubitably his own, could only be maintained by certain wise\npractices on his part, in which gentleness must predominate.\nWives are bound to obey their husbands, but obedience cannot be\nexacted from wives, as it may from servants, by aid of law and\nwith penalties, or as from a horse, by punishments and manger\ncurtailments. A man should be master in his own house, but he should\nmake his mastery palatable, equitable, smooth, soft to the touch,\na thing almost unfelt. How was he to do all this now, when he had\nalready given an order to which obedience had been refused unless\nunder certain stipulations,--an agreement with which would be\ndegradation to him? He had pointed out to his wife her duty, and she\nhad said she would do her duty as pointed out, on condition that he\nwould beg her pardon for having pointed it out! This he could not and\nwould not do. Let the heavens fall,--and the falling of the heavens\nin this case was a separation between him and his wife,--but he would\nnot consent to such injustice as that!\n\nBut what was he to do at this moment,--especially with reference to\nthat note which he had destroyed. At last he resolved to write to his\nwife, and he consequently did write and send to her the following\nletter:--\n\n\n   May 4.\n\n   DEAREST EMILY,\n\n   If Colonel Osborne should write to you again, it will\n   be better that you should not open his letter. As you\n   know his handwriting, you will have no difficulty in so\n   arranging. Should any further letter come from Colonel\n   Osborne addressed to you, you had better put it under\n   cover to me, and take no notice of it yourself.\n\n   I shall dine at the club to-day. We were to have gone to\n   Mrs. Peacock's in the evening. You had better write a line\n   to say that we shall not be there. I am very sorry that\n   Nora should lose her evening. Pray think very carefully\n   over what I have asked of you. My request to you is, that\n   you shall give me a promise that you will not willingly\n   see Colonel Osborne again. Of course you will understand\n   that this is not supposed to extend to accidental\n   meetings, as to which, should they occur,--and they would\n   be sure to occur,--you would find that they would be\n   wholly unnoticed by me.\n\n   But I must request that you will comply with my wish in\n   this matter. If you will send for me, I will go to you\n   instantly, and after one word from you to the desired\n   effect, you will find that there will be no recurrence by\n   me to a subject so hateful. As I have done, and am doing\n   what I think to be right, I cannot stultify myself by\n   saying that I think I have been wrong.\n\n   Yours always, dearest Emily,\n   With the most thorough love,\n\n   LOUIS TREVELYAN.\n\n\nThis letter he himself put on his wife's dressing-room table, and\nthen he went out to his club.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nSHEWING HOW RECONCILIATION WAS MADE.\n\n\n\"Look at that,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, when her sister came into her\nroom about an hour before dinner-time. Nora read the letter, and\nthen asked her sister what she meant to do. \"I have written to Mrs.\nPeacock. I don't know what else I can do. It is very hard upon\nyou,--that you should have been kept at home. But I don't suppose Mr.\nGlascock would have been at Mrs. Peacock's.\"\n\n\"And what else will you do, Emily?\"\n\n\"Nothing;--simply live deserted and forlorn till he shall choose to\nfind his wits again. There is nothing else that a woman can do. If he\nchooses to dine at his club every day, I can't help it. We must put\noff all the engagements, and that will be hard upon you.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about me. It is too terrible to think that there should\nbe such a quarrel.\"\n\n\"What can I do? Have I been wrong?\"\n\n\"Simply do what he tells you, whether it is wrong or right. If it's\nright, it ought to be done, and if it's wrong, it will not be your\nfault.\"\n\n\"That's very easily said, and it sounds logical; but you must know\nit's unreasonable.\"\n\n\"I don't care about reason. He is your husband, and if he wishes it\nyou should do it. And what will be the harm? You don't mean to see\nColonel Osborne any more. You have already said that he's not to be\nadmitted.\"\n\n\"I have said that nobody is to be admitted. Louis has driven me\nto that. How can I look the servant in the face and tell him that\nany special gentleman is not to be admitted to see me? Oh dear! oh\ndear! have I done anything to deserve it? Was ever so monstrous an\naccusation made against any woman! If it were not for my boy, I would\ndefy him to do his worst.\"\n\nOn the day following, Nora again became a messenger between the\nhusband and wife, and before dinner-time a reconciliation had been\neffected. Of course the wife gave way at last; and of course she gave\nway so cunningly that the husband received none of the gratification\nwhich he had expected in her surrender. \"Tell him to come,\" Nora had\nurged. \"Of course he can come if he pleases,\" Emily had replied.\nThen Nora had told Louis to come, and Louis had demanded whether,\nif he did so, the promise which he had exacted would be given. It\nis to be feared that Nora perverted the truth a little; but if ever\nsuch perversion may be forgiven, forgiveness was due to her. If\nthey could only be brought together, she was sure that there would\nbe a reconciliation. They were brought together, and there was a\nreconciliation.\n\n\"Dearest Emily, I am so glad to come to you,\" said the husband,\nwalking up to his wife in their bed-room, and taking her in his arms.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Shewing how reconciliation was made.]\n\n\n\"I have been very unhappy, Louis, for the last two days,\" said she,\nvery gravely,--returning his kiss, but returning it somewhat coldly.\n\n\"We have both been unhappy, I am sure,\" said he. Then he paused that\nthe promise might be made to him. He had certainly understood that\nit was to be made without reserve,--as an act on her part which she\nhad fully consented to perform. But she stood silent, with one hand\non the dressing-table, looking away from him, very beautiful, and\ndignified too, in her manner; but not, as far as he could judge,\neither repentant or submissive. \"Nora said that you would make me the\npromise which I ask from you.\"\n\n\"I cannot think, Louis, how you can want such a promise from me.\"\n\n\"I think it right to ask it; I do indeed.\"\n\n\"Can you imagine that I shall ever willingly see this gentleman again\nafter what has occurred? It will be for you to tell the servant. I\ndo not know how I can do that. But, as a matter of course, I will\nencourage no person to come to your house of whom you disapprove. It\nwould be exactly the same of any man or of any woman.\"\n\n\"That is all that I ask.\"\n\n\"I am surprised that you should have thought it necessary to make any\nformal request in the matter. Your word was quite sufficient. That\nyou should find cause of complaint in Colonel Osborne's coming here\nis of course a different thing.\"\n\n\"Quite a different thing,\" said he.\n\n\"I cannot pretend to understand either your motives or your fears.\nI do not understand them. My own self-respect prevents me from\nsupposing it to be possible that you have attributed an evil thought\nto me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I never have,\" said the husband.\n\n\"That I can assure you I regard as a matter of course,\" said the\nwife.\n\n\"But you know, Emily, the way in which the world talks.\"\n\n\"The world! And do you regard the world, Louis?\"\n\n\"Lady Milborough, I believe, spoke to yourself.\"\n\n\"Lady Milborough! No, she did not speak to me. She began to do so,\nbut I was careful to silence her at once. From you, Louis, I am bound\nto hear whatever you may choose to say to me; but I will not hear\nfrom any other lips a single word that may be injurious to your\nhonour.\" This she said very quietly, with much dignity, and he felt\nthat he had better not answer her. She had given him the promise\nwhich he had demanded, and he began to fear that if he pushed the\nmatter further she might go back even from that amount of submission.\nSo he kissed her again, and had the boy brought into the room, and by\nthe time that he went to dress for dinner he was able, at any rate,\nto seem to be well pleased.\n\n\"Richard,\" he said to the servant, as soon as he was down-stairs,\n\"when Colonel Osborne calls again, say that your mistress is--not at\nhome.\" He gave the order in the most indifferent tone of voice which\nhe could assume; but as he gave it he felt thoroughly ashamed of it.\nRichard, who, with the other servants, had of course known that there\nhad been a quarrel between his master and mistress for the last two\ndays, no doubt understood all about it.\n\nWhile they were sitting at dinner on the next day, a Saturday, there\ncame another note from Colonel Osborne. The servant brought it to\nhis mistress, and she, when she had looked at it, put it down by her\nplate. Trevelyan knew immediately from whom the letter had come, and\nunderstood how impossible it was for his wife to give it up in the\nservant's presence. The letter lay there till the man was out of the\nroom, and then she handed it to Nora. \"Will you give that to Louis?\"\nshe said. \"It comes from the man whom he supposes to be my lover.\"\n\n\"Emily!\" said he, jumping from his seat, \"how can you allow words so\nhorrible and so untrue to fall from your mouth?\"\n\n\"If it be not so, why am I to be placed in such a position as this?\nThe servant knows, of course, from whom the letter comes, and sees\nthat I have been forbidden to open it.\" Then the man returned to the\nroom, and the remainder of the dinner passed off almost in silence.\nIt was their custom when they dined without company to leave the\ndining-room together, but on this evening Trevelyan remained for a\nfew minutes that he might read Colonel Osborne's letter. He waited,\nstanding on the rug with his face to the fire-place, till he was\nquite alone, and then he opened it. It ran as follows:--\n\n\n   House of Commons, Saturday.\n\n   DEAR EMILY,--\n\n\nTrevelyan, as he read this, cursed Colonel Osborne between his teeth.\n\n\n   DEAR EMILY,\n\n   I called this afternoon, but you were out. I am afraid you\n   will be disappointed by what I have to tell you, but you\n   should rather be glad of it. They say at the C. O. that\n   Sir Marmaduke would not receive their letter if sent\n   now till the middle of June, and that he could not be\n   in London, let him do what he would, till the end of\n   July. They hope to have the session over by that time,\n   and therefore the committee is to be put off till next\n   session. They mean to have Lord Bowles home from Canada,\n   and they think that Bowles would like to be here in the\n   winter. Sir Marmaduke will be summoned for February next,\n   and will of course stretch his stay over the hot months.\n   All this will, on the whole, be for the best. Lady Rowley\n   could hardly have packed up her things and come away at a\n   day's notice, whatever your father might have done. I'll\n   call to-morrow at luncheon time.\n\n   Yours always,\n\n   F. O.\n\n\nThere was nothing objectionable in this letter,--excepting always the\n\"Dear Emily,\"--nothing which it was not imperative on Colonel Osborne\nto communicate to the person to whom it was addressed. Trevelyan must\nnow go up-stairs and tell the contents of the letter to his wife.\nBut he felt that he had created for himself a terrible trouble. He\nmust tell his wife what was in the letter, but the very telling of\nit would be a renewing of the soreness of his wound. And then what\nwas to be done in reference to the threatened visit for the Sunday\nmorning? Trevelyan knew very well that were his wife denied at\nthat hour, Colonel Osborne would understand the whole matter. He\nhad doubtless in his anger intended that Colonel Osborne should\nunderstand the whole matter; but he was calmer now than he had been\nthen, and almost wished that the command given by him had not been so\ndefinite and imperious. He remained with his arm on the mantel-piece,\nthinking of it, for some ten minutes, and then went up into the\ndrawing-room. \"Emily,\" he said, walking up to the table at which she\nwas sitting, \"you had better read that letter.\"\n\n\"I would so much rather not,\" she replied haughtily.\n\n\"Then Nora can read it. It concerns you both equally.\"\n\nNora, with hesitating hand, took the letter and read it. \"They are\nnot to come after all,\" said she, \"till next February.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" asked Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Something about the session. I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"Lord Bowles is to come from Canada,\" said Louis, \"and they think he\nwould prefer being here in the winter. I dare say he would.\"\n\n\"But what has that to do with papa?\"\n\n\"I suppose they must both be here together,\" said Nora.\n\n\"I call that very hard indeed,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"I can't agree with you there,\" said her husband. \"His coming at all\nis so much of a favour that it is almost a job.\"\n\n\"I don't see that it is a job at all,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"Somebody\nis wanted, and nobody can know more of the service than papa does.\nBut as the other man is a lord, I suppose papa must give way. Does he\nsay anything about mamma, Nora?\"\n\n\"You had better read the letter yourself,\" said Trevelyan, who was\ndesirous that his wife should know of the threatened visit.\n\n\"No, Louis, I shall not do that. You must not blow hot and cold too.\nTill the other day I should have thought that Colonel Osborne's\nletters were as innocent as an old newspaper. As you have supposed\nthem to be poisoned I will have nothing to do with them.\"\n\nThis speech made him very angry. It seemed that his wife, who\nhad yielded to him, was determined to take out the value of her\nsubmission in the most disagreeable words which she could utter. Nora\nnow closed the letter and handed it back to her brother-in-law. He\nlaid it down on the table beside him, and sat for a while with his\neyes fixed upon his book. At last he spoke again. \"Colonel Osborne\nsays that he will call to-morrow at luncheon time. You can admit him,\nif you please, and thank him for the trouble he has taken in this\nmatter.\"\n\n\"I shall not remain in the room if he be admitted,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan.\n\nThere was silence again for some minutes, and the cloud upon\nTrevelyan's brow became blacker than before. Then he rose from his\nchair and walked round to the sofa on which his wife was sitting. \"I\npresume,\" said he, \"that your wishes and mine in this matter must be\nthe same.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell what your wishes are,\" she replied. \"I never was more\nin the dark on any subject in my life. My wishes at present are\nconfined to a desire to save you as far as may be possible from the\nshame which must be attached to your own suspicions.\"\n\n\"I have never had any suspicions.\"\n\n\"A husband without suspicions does not intercept his wife's letters.\nA husband without suspicions does not call in the aid of his servants\nto guard his wife. A husband without suspicions--\"\n\n\"Emily,\" exclaimed Nora Rowley, \"how can you say such things,--on\npurpose to provoke him?\"\n\n\"Yes; on purpose to provoke me,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"And have I not been provoked? Have I not been injured? You say now\nthat you have not suspected me, and yet in what condition do I find\nmyself? Because an old woman has chosen to talk scandal about me, I\nam placed in a position in my own house which is disgraceful to you\nand insupportable to myself. This man has been in the habit of coming\nhere on Sundays, and will, of course, know that we are at home. You\nmust manage it as you please. If you choose to receive him, I will go\nup-stairs.\"\n\n\"Why can't you let him come in and go away, just as usual?\" said\nNora.\n\n\"Because Louis has made me promise that I will never willingly be\nin his company again,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"I would have given the\nworld to avoid a promise so disgraceful to me; but it was exacted,\nand it shall be kept.\" Having so spoken, she swept out of the room,\nand went up-stairs to the nursery. Trevelyan sat for an hour with his\nbook before him, reading or pretending to read, but his wife did not\ncome down-stairs. Then Nora went up to her, and he descended to his\nsolitude below. So far he had hardly gained much by the enforced\nobedience of his wife.\n\nOn the next morning the three went to church together, and as they\nwere walking home Trevelyan's heart was filled with returning\ngentleness towards his wife. He could not bear to be at wrath with\nher after the church service which they had just heard together.\nBut he was softer-hearted than was she, and knowing this, was\nalmost afraid to say anything that would again bring forth from her\nexpressions of scorn. As soon as they were alone within the house he\ntook her by the hand and led her apart. \"Let all this be,\" said he,\n\"as though it had never been.\"\n\n\"That will hardly be possible, Louis,\" she answered. \"I cannot forget\nthat I have been--cautioned.\"\n\n\"But cannot you bring yourself to believe that I have meant it all\nfor your good?\"\n\n\"I have never doubted it, Louis;--never for a moment. But it has hurt\nme to find that you should think that such caution was needed for my\ngood.\"\n\nIt was almost on his tongue to beg her pardon, to acknowledge that\nhe had made a mistake, and to implore her to forget that he had ever\nmade an objection to Colonel Osborne's visit. He remembered at this\nmoment the painful odiousness of that \"Dear Emily;\" but he had to\nreconcile himself even to that, telling himself that, after all,\nColonel Osborne was an old man,--a man older even than his wife's\nfather. If she would only have met him with gentleness, he would have\nwithdrawn his command, and have acknowledged that he had been wrong.\nBut she was hard, dignified, obedient, and resentful. \"It will, I\nthink,\" he said, \"be better for both of us that he should be asked in\nto lunch to-day.\"\n\n\"You must judge of that,\" said Emily. \"Perhaps, upon the whole, it\nwill be best. I can only say that I will not be present. I will lunch\nup-stairs with baby, and you can make what excuse for me you please.\"\nThis was all very bad, but it was in this way that things were\nallowed to arrange themselves. Richard was told that Colonel Osborne\nwas coming to lunch, and when he came something was muttered to him\nabout Mrs. Trevelyan being not quite well. It was Nora who told the\ninnocent fib, and though she did not tell it well, she did her very\nbest. She felt that her brother-in-law was very wretched, and she was\nmost anxious to relieve him. Colonel Osborne did not stay long, and\nthen Nora went up-stairs to her sister.\n\nLouis Trevelyan felt that he had disgraced himself. He had meant to\nhave been strong, and he had, as he knew, been very weak. He had\nmeant to have acted in a high-minded, honest, manly manner; but\ncircumstances had been so untoward with him, that on looking at his\nown conduct, it seemed to him to have been mean, and almost false\nand cowardly. As the order for the exclusion of this hated man from\nhis house had been given, he should at any rate have stuck to the\norder. At the moment of his vacillation he had simply intended to\nmake things easy for his wife; but she had taken advantage of his\nvacillation, and had now clearly conquered him. Perhaps he respected\nher more than he had done when he was resolving, three or four days\nsince, that he would be the master in his own house; but it may be\nfeared that the tenderness of his love for her had been impaired.\n\nLate in the afternoon his wife and sister-in-law came down dressed\nfor walking, and, finding Trevelyan in the library, they asked him to\njoin them,--it was a custom with them to walk in the park on a Sunday\nafternoon,--and he at once assented, and went out with them. Emily,\nwho had had her triumph, was very gracious. There should not be a\nword more said by her about Colonel Osborne. She would avoid that\ngentleman, never receiving him in Curzon Street, and having as little\nto say to him as possible elsewhere; but she would not throw his name\nin her husband's teeth, or make any reference to the injury which had\nso manifestly been done to her. Unless Louis should be indiscreet,\nit should be as though it had been forgotten. As they walked by\nChesterfield House and Stanhope Street into the park, she began to\ndiscuss the sermon they had heard that morning, and when she found\nthat that subject was not alluring, she spoke of a dinner to which\nthey were to go at Mrs. Fairfax's house. Louis Trevelyan was quite\naware that he was being treated as a naughty boy, who was to be\nforgiven.\n\nThey went across Hyde Park into Kensington Gardens, and still the\nsame thing was going on. Nora found it to be almost impossible to say\na word. Trevelyan answered his wife's questions, but was otherwise\nsilent. Emily worked very hard at her mission of forgiveness, and\nhardly ceased in her efforts at conciliatory conversation. Women\ncan work so much harder in this way than men find it possible to do!\nShe never flagged, but continued to be fluent, conciliatory, and\nintolerably wearisome. On a sudden they came across two men together,\nwho, as they all knew, were barely acquainted with each other. These\nwere Colonel Osborne and Hugh Stanbury.\n\n\"I am glad to find you are able to be out,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"Thanks; yes. I think my seclusion just now was almost as much due to\nbaby as to anything else. Mr. Stanbury, how is it we never see you\nnow?\"\n\n\"It is the D. R., Mrs. Trevelyan;--nothing else. The D. R. is a most\ngrateful mistress, but somewhat exacting. I am allowed a couple of\nhours on Sundays, but otherwise my time is wholly passed in Fleet\nStreet.\"\n\n\"How very unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Well; yes. The unpleasantness of this world consists chiefly in the\nfact that when a man wants wages, he must earn them. The Christian\nphilosophers have a theory about it. Don't they call it the primeval\nfall, original sin, and that kind of thing?\"\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury, I won't have irreligion. I hope that doesn't come from\nwriting for the newspapers.\"\n\n\"Certainly not with me, Mrs. Trevelyan. I have never been put on\nto take that branch yet. Scrubby does that with us, and does it\nexcellently. It was he who touched up the Ritualists, and then the\nCommission, and then the Low Church bishops, till he didn't leave one\nof them a leg to stand upon.\"\n\n\"What is it, then, that the Daily Record upholds?\"\n\n\"It upholds the Daily Record. Believe in that and you will surely be\nsaved.\" Then he turned to Miss Rowley, and they two were soon walking\non together, each manifestly interested in what the other was saying,\nthough there was no word of tenderness spoken between them.\n\nColonel Osborne was now between Mr. and Mrs. Trevelyan. She would\nhave avoided the position had it been possible for her to do so.\nWhile they were falling into their present places, she had made a\nlittle mute appeal to her husband to take her away from the spot, to\ngive her his arm and return with her, to save her in some way from\nremaining in company with the man to whose company for her he had\nobjected; but he took no such step. It had seemed to him that he\ncould take no such step without showing his hostility to Colonel\nOsborne.\n\nThey walked on along the broad path together, and the Colonel was\nbetween them.\n\n\"I hope you think it satisfactory,--about Sir Rowley,\" he said.\n\n\"Beggars must not be choosers, you know, Colonel Osborne. I felt a\nlittle disappointed when I found that we were not to see them till\nFebruary next.\"\n\n\"They will stay longer then, you know, than they could now.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt when the time comes we shall all believe it to be\nbetter.\"\n\n\"I suppose you think, Emily, that a little pudding to-day is better\nthan much to-morrow.\"\n\nColonel Osborne certainly had a caressing, would-be affectionate mode\nof talking to women, which, unless it were reciprocated and enjoyed,\nwas likely to make itself disagreeable. No possible words could have\nbeen more innocent than those he had now spoken; but he had turned\nhis face down close to her face, and had almost whispered them. And\nthen, too, he had again called her by her Christian name. Trevelyan\nhad not heard the words. He had walked on, making the distance\nbetween him and the other man greater than was necessary, anxious to\nshow to his wife that he had no jealousy at such a meeting as this.\nBut his wife was determined that she would put an end to this state\nof things, let the cost be what it might. She did not say a word to\nColonel Osborne, but addressed herself at once to her husband.\n\n\"Louis,\" she said, \"will you give me your arm? We will go back, if\nyou please.\" Then she took her husband's arm, and turned herself and\nhim abruptly away from their companion.\n\nThe thing was done in such a manner that it was impossible that\nColonel Osborne should not perceive that he had been left in anger.\nWhen Trevelyan and his wife had gone back a few yards, he was obliged\nto return for Nora. He did so, and then rejoined his wife.\n\n\"It was quite unnecessary, Emily,\" he said, \"that you should behave\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Your suspicions,\" she said, \"have made it almost impossible for me\nto behave with propriety.\"\n\n\"You have told him everything now,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"And it was requisite that he should be told,\" said his wife. Then\nthey walked home without interchanging another word. When they\nreached their house, Emily at once went up to her own room, and\nTrevelyan to his. They parted as though they had no common interest\nwhich was worthy of a moment's conversation. And she by her step,\nand gait, and every movement of her body showed to him that she was\nnot his wife now in any sense that could bring to him a feeling of\ndomestic happiness. Her compliance with his command was of no use\nto him unless she could be brought to comply in spirit. Unless she\nwould be soft to him he could not be happy. He walked about his room\nuneasily for half-an-hour, trying to shake off his sorrow, and then\nhe went up to her room. \"Emily,\" he said, \"for God's sake let all\nthis pass away.\"\n\n\"What is to pass away?\"\n\n\"This feeling of rancour between you and me. What is the world to us\nunless we can love one another? At any rate it will be nothing to\nme.\"\n\n\"Do you doubt my love?\" said she.\n\n\"No; certainly not.\"\n\n\"Nor I yours. Without love, Louis, you and I can not be happy. But\nlove alone will not make us so. There must be trust, and there must\nalso be forbearance. My feeling of annoyance will pass away in time;\nand till it does, I will shew it as little as may be possible.\"\n\nHe felt that he had nothing more to say, and then he left her; but he\nhad gained nothing by the interview. She was still hard and cold, and\nstill assumed a tone which seemed to imply that she had manifestly\nbeen the injured person.\n\nColonel Osborne, when he was left alone, stood for a few moments on\nthe spot, and then with a whistle, a shake of the head, and a little\nlow chuckle of laughter, rejoined the crowd.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nMISS JEMIMA STANBURY, OF EXETER.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nMiss Jemima Stanbury, the aunt of our friend Hugh, was a maiden lady,\nvery much respected, indeed, in the city of Exeter. It is to be\nhoped that no readers of these pages will be so un-English as to be\nunable to appreciate the difference between county society and town\nsociety,--the society, that is, of a provincial town, or so ignorant\nas not to know also that there may be persons so privileged, that\nalthough they live distinctly within a provincial town, there\nis accorded to them, as though by brevet rank, all the merit of\nliving in the county. In reference to persons so privileged, it is\nconsidered that they have been made free from the contamination of\ncontiguous bricks and mortar by certain inner gifts, probably of\nbirth, occasionally of profession, possibly of merit. It is very\nrarely, indeed, that money alone will bestow this acknowledged\nrank; and in Exeter, which by the stringency and excellence of its\nwell-defined rules on such matters, may perhaps be said to take the\nlead of all English provincial towns, money alone has never availed.\nGood blood, especially if it be blood good in Devonshire, is rarely\nrejected. Clergymen are allowed within the pale,--though by no means\nas certainly as used to be the case; and, indeed, in these days of\nliterates, clergymen have to pass harder examinations than those ever\nimposed upon them by bishops' chaplains, before they are admitted ad\neundem among the chosen ones of the city of Exeter. The wives and\ndaughters of the old prebendaries see well to that. And, as has been\nsaid, special merit may prevail. Sir Peter Mancrudy, the great Exeter\nphysician, has won his way in,--not at all by being Sir Peter, which\nhas stood in his way rather than otherwise,--but by the acknowledged\nexcellence of his book about saltzes. Sir Peter Mancrudy is supposed\nto have quite a metropolitan, almost a European reputation,--and\ntherefore is acknowledged to belong to the county set, although he\nnever dines out at any house beyond the limits of the city. Now, let\nit be known that no inhabitant of Exeter ever achieved a clearer\nright to be regarded as \"county,\" in opposition to \"town,\" than had\nMiss Jemima Stanbury. There was not a tradesman in Exeter who was not\naware of it, and who did not touch his hat to her accordingly. The\nmen who drove the flies, when summoned to take her out at night,\nwould bring oats with them, knowing how probable it was that they\nmight have to travel far. A distinct apology was made if she was\nasked to drink tea with people who were simply \"town.\" The Noels of\nDoddescombe Leigh, the Cliffords of Budleigh Salterton, the Powels of\nHaldon, the Cheritons of Alphington,--all county persons, but very\nfrequently in the city,--were greeted by her, and greeted her, on\nterms of equality. Her most intimate friend was old Mrs. MacHugh,\nthe widow of the last dean but two, who could not have stood higher\nhad she been the widow of the last bishop. And then, although Miss\nStanbury was intimate with the Frenches of Heavitree, with the\nWrights of Northernhay, with the Apjohns of Helion Villa,--a really\nmagnificent house, two miles out of the city on the Crediton\nRoad, and with the Crumbies of Cronstadt House, Saint Ide's,--who\nwould have been county people, if living in the country made the\ndifference;--although she was intimate with all these families,\nher manner to them was not the same, nor was it expected to be the\nsame, as with those of her own acknowledged set. These things are\nunderstood in Exeter so well!\n\nMiss Stanbury belonged to the county set, but she lived in a large\nbrick house, standing in the Close, almost behind the Cathedral.\nIndeed it was so close to the eastern end of the edifice that a\ncarriage could not be brought quite up to her door. It was a large\nbrick house, very old, with a door in the middle, and five steps\nascending to it between high iron rails. On each side of the door\nthere were two windows on the ground floor, and above that there\nwere three tiers of five windows each, and the house was double\nthroughout, having as many windows looking out behind into a gloomy\ncourtyard. But the glory of the house consisted in this, that there\nwas a garden attached to it, a garden with very high walls, over\nwhich the boughs of trees might be seen, giving to the otherwise\ngloomy abode a touch of freshness in the summer, and a look of space\nin the winter, which no doubt added something to the reputation even\nof Miss Stanbury. The fact,--for it was a fact,--that there was\nno gloomier or less attractive spot in the whole city than Miss\nStanbury's garden, when seen inside, did not militate against this\nadvantage. There were but half-a-dozen trees, and a few square yards\nof grass that was never green, and a damp ungravelled path on which\nno one ever walked. Seen from the inside the garden was not much;\nbut, from the outside, it gave a distinct character to the house, and\nproduced an unexpressed acknowledgment that the owner of it ought to\nbelong to the county set.\n\nThe house and all that was in it belonged to Miss Stanbury herself,\nas did also many other houses in the neighbourhood. She was the owner\nof the \"Cock and Bottle,\" a very decent second class inn on the other\nside of the Close, an inn supposed to have clerical tendencies, which\nmade it quite suitable for a close. The choristers took their beer\nthere, and the landlord was a retired verger. Nearly the whole of\none side of a dark passage leading out of the Close towards the High\nStreet belonged to her; and though the passage be narrow and the\nhouses dark, the locality is known to be good for trade. And she\nowned two large houses in the High Street, and a great warehouse\nat St. Thomas's, and had been bought out of land by the Railway at\nSt. David's,--much to her own dissatisfaction, as she was wont to\nexpress herself, but, undoubtedly, at a very high price. It will be\nunderstood therefore, that Miss Stanbury was wealthy, and that she\nwas bound to the city in which she lived by peculiar ties.\n\nBut Miss Stanbury had not been born to this wealth, nor can she\nbe said to have inherited from her forefathers any of these high\nprivileges which had been awarded to her. She had achieved them by\nthe romance of her life and the manner in which she had carried\nherself amidst its vicissitudes. Her father had been vicar of\nNuncombe Putney, a parish lying twenty miles west of Exeter, among\nthe moors. And on her father's death, her brother, also now dead, had\nbecome vicar of the same parish,--her brother, whose only son, Hugh\nStanbury, we already know, working for the \"D. R.\" up in London. When\nMiss Stanbury was twenty-one she became engaged to a certain Mr.\nBrooke Burgess, the eldest son of a banker in Exeter,--or, it might,\nperhaps, be better said, a banker himself; for at the time Mr.\nBrooke Burgess was in the firm. It need not here be told how various\nmisfortunes arose, how Mr. Burgess quarrelled with the Stanbury\nfamily, how Jemima quarrelled with her own family, how, when her\nfather died, she went out from Nuncombe Putney parsonage, and lived\non the smallest pittance in a city lodging, how her lover was untrue\nto her and did not marry her, and how at last he died and left her\nevery shilling that he possessed.\n\nThe Devonshire people, at the time, had been much divided as to the\nmerits of the Stanbury quarrel. There were many who said that the\nbrother could not have acted otherwise than he did; and that Miss\nStanbury, though by force of character and force of circumstances\nshe had weathered the storm, had in truth been very indiscreet. The\nresults, however, were as have been described. At the period of which\nwe treat, Miss Stanbury was a very rich lady, living by herself in\nExeter, admitted, without question, to be one of the county set, and\nstill at variance with her brother's family. Except to Hugh, she had\nnever spoken a word to one of them since her brother's death. When\nthe money came into her hands, she at that time being over forty\nand her nephew being then just ten years old, she had undertaken to\neducate him, and to start him in the world. We know how she had kept\nher word, and how and why she had withdrawn herself from any further\nresponsibility in the matter.\n\nAnd in regard to this business of starting the young man she had been\ncareful to let it be known that she would do no more than start him.\nIn the formal document, by means of which she had made the proposal\nto her brother, she had been careful to let it be understood that\nsimple education was all that she intended to bestow upon him,--\"and\nthat only,\" she had added, \"in the event of my surviving till his\neducation be completed.\" And to Hugh himself she had declared that\nany allowance which she made him after he was called to the Bar,\nwas only made in order to give him room for his foot, a spot of\nground from whence to make his first leap. We know how he made that\nleap, infinitely to the disgust of his aunt, who, when he refused\nobedience to her in the matter of withdrawing from the Daily Record,\nimmediately withdrew from him, not only her patronage and assistance,\nbut even her friendship and acquaintance. This was the letter which\nshe wrote to him--\n\n\n   I don't think that writing radical stuff for a penny\n   newspaper is a respectable occupation for a gentleman, and\n   I will have nothing to do with it. If you choose to do\n   such work, I cannot help it; but it was not for such that\n   I sent you to Harrow and Oxford, nor yet up to London and\n   paid \u00c2\u00a3100 a year to Mr. Lambert. I think you are treating\n   me badly, but that is nothing to your bad treatment of\n   yourself. You need not trouble yourself to answer this,\n   unless you are prepared to say that you will not write any\n   more stuff for that penny newspaper. Only I wish to be\n   understood. I will have no connection that I can help,\n   and no acquaintance at all, with radical scribblers and\n   incendiaries.\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n   The Close, Exeter, April 15, 186--.\n\n\nHugh Stanbury had answered this, thanking his aunt for past favours,\nand explaining to her,--or striving to do so,--that he felt it to be\nhis duty to earn his bread, as a means of earning it had come within\nhis reach. He might as well have spared himself the trouble. She\nsimply wrote a few words across his own letter in red ink:--\"The\nbread of unworthiness should never be earned or eaten;\" and then sent\nthe letter back under a blank envelope to her nephew.\n\nShe was a thorough Tory of the old school. Had Hugh taken to writing\nfor a newspaper that had cost sixpence, or even threepence, for its\ncopies, she might perhaps have forgiven him. At any rate the offence\nwould not have been so flagrant. And had the paper been conservative\ninstead of liberal, she would have had some qualms of conscience\nbefore she gave him up. But to live by writing for a newspaper! and\nfor a penny newspaper!! and for a penny radical newspaper!!! It was\nmore than she could endure. Of what nature were the articles which he\ncontributed it was impossible that she should have any idea, for no\nconsideration would have induced her to look at a penny newspaper, or\nto admit it within her doors. She herself took in the John Bull and\nthe Herald, and daily groaned deeply at the way in which those once\ngreat organs of true British public feeling were becoming demoralised\nand perverted. Had any reduction been made in the price of either of\nthem, she would at once have stopped her subscription. In the matter\nof politics she had long since come to think that everything good was\nover. She hated the name of Reform so much that she could not bring\nherself to believe in Mr. Disraeli and his bill. For many years she\nhad believed in Lord Derby. She would fain believe in him still if\nshe could. It was the great desire of her heart to have some one in\nwhom she believed. In the bishop of her diocese she did believe, and\nannually sent him some little comforting present from her own hand.\nAnd in two or three of the clergymen around her she believed, finding\nin them a flavour of the unascetic godliness of ancient days which\nwas gratifying to her palate. But in politics there was hardly a name\nremaining to which she could fix her faith and declare that there\nshould be her guide. For awhile she thought she would cling to Mr.\nLowe; but, when she made inquiry, she found that there was no base\nthere of really well-formed conservative granite. The three gentlemen\nwho had dissevered themselves from Mr. Disraeli when Mr. Disraeli was\npassing his Reform bill, were doubtless very good in their way; but\nthey were not big enough to fill her heart. She tried to make herself\nhappy with General Peel, but General Peel was after all no more than\na shade to her. But the untruth of others never made her untrue, and\nshe still talked of the excellence of George III. and the glories of\nthe subsequent reign. She had a bust of Lord Eldon, before which she\nwas accustomed to stand with hands closed and to weep,--or to think\nthat she wept.\n\nShe was a little woman, now nearly sixty years of age, with bright\ngrey eyes, and a strong Roman nose, and thin lips, and a sharp-cut\nchin. She wore a head-gear that almost amounted to a mob-cap, and\nbeneath it her grey hair was always frizzled with the greatest care.\nHer dress was invariably of black silk, and she had five gowns,--one\nfor church, one for evening parties, one for driving out, and one for\nevenings at home, and one for mornings. The dress, when new, always\nwent to church. Nothing, she was wont to say, was too good for the\nLord's house. In the days of crinolines she had protested that she\nhad never worn one,--a protest, however, which was hardly true; and\nnow, in these later days, her hatred was especially developed in\nreference to the head-dresses of young women. \"Chignon\" was a word\nwhich she had never been heard to pronounce. She would talk of \"those\nbandboxes which the sluts wear behind their noddles;\" for Miss\nStanbury allowed herself the use of much strong language. She was\nvery punctilious in all her habits, breakfasting ever at half-past\neight, and dining always at six. Half-past five had been her time,\ntill the bishop, who, on an occasion, was to be her guest, once\nsignified to her that such an hour cut up the day and interfered with\nclerical work. Her lunch was always of bread and cheese, and they who\nlunched with her either eat that,--or the bread without the cheese.\nAn afternoon \"tea\" was a thing horrible to her imagination. Tea and\nbuttered toast at half-past eight in the evening was the great luxury\nof her life. She was as strong as a horse, and had never hitherto\nknown a day's illness. As a consequence of this, she did not believe\nin the illness of other people,--especially not in the illness of\nwomen. She did not like a girl who could not drink a glass of beer\nwith her bread and cheese in the middle of the day, and she thought\nthat a glass of port after dinner was good for everybody. Indeed, she\nhad a thorough belief in port wine, thinking that it would go far to\ncure most miseries. But she could not put up with the idea that a\nwoman, young or old, should want the stimulus of a glass of sherry\nto support her at any odd time of the day. Hot concoctions of strong\ndrink at Christmas she would allow to everybody, and was very strong\nin recommending such comforts to ladies blessed, or about to be\nblessed, with babies. She took the sacrament every month, and gave\naway exactly a tenth of her income to the poor. She believed that\nthere was a special holiness in a tithe of a thing, and attributed\nthe commencement of the downfall of the Church of England to rent\ncharges, and the commutation of clergymen's incomes. Since Judas,\nthere had never been, to her thinking, a traitor so base, or an\napostate so sinful, as Colenso; and yet, of the nature of Colenso's\nteaching she was as ignorant as the towers of the cathedral opposite\nto her.\n\nShe believed in Exeter, thinking that there was no other provincial\ntown in England in which a maiden lady could live safely and\ndecently. London to her was an abode of sin; and though, as we have\nseen, she delighted to call herself one of the county set, she did\nnot love the fields and lanes. And in Exeter the only place for a\nlady was the Close. Southernhay and Northernhay might be very well,\nand there was doubtless a respectable neighbourhood on the Heavitree\nside of the town; but for the new streets, and especially for the\nsuburban villas, she had no endurance. She liked to deal at dear\nshops; but would leave any shop, either dear or cheap, in regard to\nwhich a printed advertisement should reach her eye. She paid all her\nbills at the end of each six months, and almost took a delight in\nhigh prices. She would rejoice that bread should be cheap, and grieve\nthat meat should be dear, because of the poor; but in regard to other\nmatters no reduction in the cost of an article ever pleased her.\nShe had houses as to which she was told by her agent that the rents\nshould be raised; but she would not raise them. She had others which\nit was difficult to let without lowering the rents, but she would not\nlower them. All change was to her hateful and unnecessary.\n\nShe kept three maid-servants, and a man came in every day to clean\nthe knives and boots. Service with her was well requited, and much\nlabour was never exacted. But it was not every young woman who could\nlive with her. A rigidity as to hours, as to religious exercises,\nand as to dress, was exacted, under which many poor girls altogether\nbroke down; but they who could stand this rigidity came to know that\ntheir places were very valuable. No one belonging to them need want\nfor aught, when once the good opinion of Miss Stanbury had been\nearned. When once she believed in her servant there was nobody like\nthat servant. There was not a man in Exeter could clean a boot except\nGiles Hickbody,--and if not in Exeter, then where else? And her own\nmaid Martha, who had lived with her now for twenty years, and who had\ncome with her to the brick house when she first inhabited it, was\nsuch a woman that no other servant anywhere was fit to hold a candle\nto her. But then Martha had great gifts,--was never ill, and really\nliked having sermons read to her.\n\nSuch was Miss Stanbury, who had now discarded her nephew Hugh. She\nhad never been tenderly affectionate to Hugh, or she would hardly\nhave asked him to live in London on a hundred a year. She had never\nreally been kind to him since he was a boy, for although she had paid\nfor him, she had been almost penurious in her manner of doing so,\nand had repeatedly given him to understand, that in the event of her\ndeath not a shilling would be left to him. Indeed, as to that matter\nof bequeathing her money, it was understood that it was her purpose\nto let it all go back to the Burgess family. With the Burgess family\nshe had kept up no sustained connection, it being quite understood\nthat she was never to be asked to meet the only one of them now left\nin Exeter. Nor was it as yet known to any one in what manner the\nmoney was to go back, how it was to be divided, or who were to be the\nrecipients. But she had declared that it should go back, explaining\nthat she had conceived it to be a duty to let her own relations know\nthat they would not inherit her wealth at her death.\n\nAbout a week after she had sent back poor Hugh's letter with the\nendorsement on it as to unworthy bread, she summoned Martha to the\nback parlour in which she was accustomed to write her letters. It was\none of the theories of her life that different rooms should be used\nonly for the purposes for which they were intended. She never allowed\npens and ink up into the bed-rooms, and had she ever heard that any\nguest in her house was reading in bed, she would have made an instant\npersonal attack upon that guest, whether male or female, which would\nhave surprised that guest. Poor Hugh would have got on better with\nher had he not been discovered once smoking in the garden. Nor would\nshe have writing materials in the drawing-room or dining-room. There\nwas a chamber behind the dining-room in which there was an inkbottle,\nand if there was a letter to be written, let the writer go there\nand write it. In the writing of many letters, however, she put no\nconfidence, and regarded penny postage as one of the strongest\nevidences of the coming ruin.\n\n\"Martha,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you. Sit down. I think I am\ngoing to do something.\" Martha sat down, but did not speak a word.\nThere had been no question asked of her, and the time for speaking\nhad not come. \"I am writing to Mrs. Stanbury, at Nuncombe Putney; and\nwhat do you think I am saying to her?\"\n\nNow the question had been asked, and it was Martha's duty to reply.\n\n\"Writing to Mrs. Stanbury, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes, to Mrs. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"It ain't possible for me to say, ma'am, unless it's to put Mr. Hugh\nfrom going on with the newspapers.\"\n\n\"When my nephew won't be controlled by me, I shan't go elsewhere\nto look for control over him; you may be sure of that, Martha. And\nremember, Martha, I don't want to have his name mentioned again in\nthe house. You will tell them all so, if you please.\"\n\n\"He was a very nice gentleman, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Martha, I won't have it; and there's an end of it. I won't have it.\nPerhaps I know what goes to the making of a nice gentleman as well as\nyou do.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hugh, ma'am,--\"\n\n\"I won't have it, Martha. And when I say so, let there be an end\nof it.\" As she said this, she got up from her chair, and shook her\nhead, and took a turn about the room. \"If I'm not mistress here, I'm\nnobody.\"\n\n\"Of course you're mistress here, ma'am.\"\n\n\"And if I don't know what's fit to be done, and what's not fit, I'm\ntoo old to learn; and, what's more, I won't be taught. I'm not going\nto have my house crammed with radical incendiary stuff, printed with\nink that stinks, on paper made out of straw. If I can't live without\npenny literature, at any rate I'll die without it. Now listen to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I have asked Mrs. Stanbury to send one of the girls over here.\"\n\n\"To live, ma'am?\" Martha's tone as she asked the question, showed how\ndeeply she felt its importance.\n\n\"Yes, Martha; to live.\"\n\n\"You'll never like it, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose I shall.\"\n\n\"You'll never get on with it, ma'am; never. The young lady'll be out\nof the house in a week; or if she ain't, somebody else will.\"\n\n\"You mean yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm only a servant, ma'am, and it don't signify about me.\"\n\n\"You're a fool.\"\n\n\"That's true, ma'am, I don't doubt.\"\n\n\"I've sent for her, and we must do the best we can. Perhaps she won't\ncome.\"\n\n\"She'll come fast enough,\" said Martha. \"But whether she'll stay,\nthat's a different thing. I don't see how it's possible she's to\nstay. I'm told they're feckless, idle young ladies. She'll be so\nsoft, ma'am, and you,--\"\n\n\"Well; what of me?\"\n\n\"You'll be so hard, ma'am!\"\n\n\"I'm not a bit harder than you, Martha; nor yet so hard. I'll do my\nduty, or at least I'll try. Now you know all about it, and you may go\naway. There's the letter, and I mean to go out and post it myself.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\"I KNOW IT WILL DO.\"\n\n\nMiss Stanbury carried her letter all the way to the chief post-office\nin the city, having no faith whatever in those little subsidiary\nreceiving houses which are established in different parts of the\ncity. As for the iron pillar boxes which had been erected of late\nyears for the receipt of letters, one of which,--a most hateful thing\nto her,--stood almost close to her own hall door, she had not the\nfaintest belief that any letter put into one of them would ever reach\nits destination. She could not understand why people should not walk\nwith their letters to a respectable post-office instead of chucking\nthem into an iron stump,--as she called it,--out in the middle of the\nstreet with nobody to look after it. Positive orders had been given\nthat no letter from her house should ever be put into the iron post.\nHer epistle to her sister-in-law, of whom she never spoke otherwise\nthan as Mrs. Stanbury, was as follows:--\n\n\n   The Close, Exeter, 22nd April, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SISTER STANBURY,\n\n   Your son, Hugh, has taken to courses of which I do not\n   approve, and therefore I have put an end to my connection\n   with him. I shall be happy to entertain your daughter\n   Dorothy in my house if you and she approve of such a plan.\n   Should you agree to this, she will be welcome to receive\n   you or her sister,--_not her brother_,--in my house any\n   Wednesday morning between half-past nine and half-past\n   twelve. I will endeavour to make my house pleasant to her\n   and useful, and will make her an allowance of \u00c2\u00a325 per\n   annum for her clothes as long as she may remain with me. I\n   shall expect her to be regular at meals, to be constant in\n   going to church, and not to read modern novels.\n\n   I intend the arrangement to be permanent, but of course I\n   must retain the power of closing it if, and when, I shall\n   see fit. Its permanence must be contingent on my life. I\n   have no power of providing for any one _after my death_.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n   I hope the young lady does not have any false hair about\n   her.\n\n\nWhen this note was received at Nuncombe Putney the amazement which it\noccasioned was extreme. Mrs. Stanbury, the widow of the late vicar,\nlived in a little morsel of a cottage on the outskirts of the\nvillage, with her two daughters, Priscilla and Dorothy. Their whole\nincome, out of which it was necessary that they should pay rent for\ntheir cottage, was less than \u00c2\u00a370 per annum. During the last few\nmonths a five-pound note now and again had found its way to Nuncombe\nPutney out of the coffers of the \"D. R.;\" but the ladies there were\nmost unwilling to be so relieved, thinking that their brother's\ncareer was of infinitely more importance than their comforts or even\nthan their living. They were very poor, but they were accustomed\nto poverty. The elder sister was older than Hugh, but Dorothy, the\nyounger, to whom this strange invitation was now made, was two years\nyounger than her brother, and was now nearly twenty-six. How they had\nlived, and dressed themselves, and had continued to be called ladies\nby the inhabitants of the village was, and is, and will be a mystery\nto those who have had the spending of much larger incomes, but have\nstill been always poor. But they had lived, had gone to church every\nSunday in decent apparel, and had kept up friendly relations with the\nfamily of the present vicar, and with one or two other neighbours.\n\nWhen the letter had been read first by the mother, and then aloud,\nand then by each of them separately, in the little sitting-room in\nthe cottage, there was silence among them,--for neither of them\ndesired to be the first to express an opinion. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the proposed arrangement, had it not been made unnatural\nby a quarrel existing nearly throughout the whole life of the person\nmost nearly concerned. Priscilla, the elder daughter, was the one of\nthe family who was generally the ruler, and she at last expressed an\nopinion adverse to the arrangement. \"My dear, you would never be able\nto bear it,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, plaintively.\n\n\"I could try,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"My dear, you don't know that woman,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Of course I don't know her,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"She has always been very good to Hugh,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"I don't think she has been good to him at all,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"But think what a saving it would be,\" said Dorothy. \"And I could\nsend home half of what Aunt Stanbury says she would give me.\"\n\n\"You must not think of that,\" said Priscilla, \"because she expects\nyou to be dressed.\"\n\n\"I should like to try,\" she said, before the morning was over,--\"if\nyou and mamma don't think it would be wrong.\"\n\nThe conference that day ended in a written request to Aunt Stanbury\nthat a week might be allowed for consideration,--the letter being\nwritten by Priscilla, but signed with her mother's name,--and with a\nvery long epistle to Hugh, in which each of the ladies took a part,\nand in which advice and decision were demanded. It was very evident\nto Hugh that his mother and Dorothy were for compliance, and that\nPriscilla was for refusal. But he never doubted for a moment. \"Of\ncourse she will go,\" he said in his answer to Priscilla; \"and she\nmust understand that Aunt Stanbury is a most excellent woman, as true\nas the sun, thoroughly honest, with no fault but this, that she likes\nher own way. Of course Dolly can go back again if she finds the house\ntoo hard for her.\" Then he sent another five-pound note, observing\nthat Dolly's journey to Exeter would cost money, and that her\nwardrobe would want some improvement.\n\n\"I'm very glad that it isn't me,\" said Priscilla, who, however, did\nnot attempt to oppose the decision of the man of the family. Dorothy\nwas greatly gratified by the excitement of the proposed change in\nher life, and the following letter, the product of the wisdom of the\nfamily, was written by Mrs. Stanbury:--\n\n\n   Nuncombe Putney, 1st May, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SISTER STANBURY,\n\n   We are all very thankful for the kindness of your offer,\n   which my daughter Dorothy will accept with feelings of\n   affectionate gratitude. I think you will find her docile,\n   good-tempered, and amiable; but a mother, of course,\n   speaks well of her own child. She will endeavour to comply\n   with your wishes in all things reasonable. She, of course,\n   understands that should the arrangement not suit, she will\n   come back home on the expression of your wish that it\n   should be so. And she will, of course, do the same, if she\n   should find that living in Exeter does not suit herself.\n   [This sentence was inserted at the instance of Priscilla,\n   after much urgent expostulation.] Dorothy will be ready\n   to go to you on any day you may fix after the 7th of this\n   month.\n\n   Believe me to remain,\n   Your affectionate sister-in-law,\n\n   P. STANBURY.\n\n\n\"She's going to come,\" said Miss Stanbury to Martha, holding the\nletter in her hand.\n\n\"I never doubted her coming, ma'am,\" said Martha.\n\n\"And I mean her to stay, unless it's her own fault. She'll have the\nsmall room up-stairs, looking out front, next to mine. And you must\ngo and fetch her.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch her, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes. If you won't, I must.\"\n\n\"She ain't a child, ma'am. She's twenty-five years old, and surely\nshe can come to Exeter by herself, with a railroad all the way from\nLessboro'.\"\n\n\"There's no place a young woman is insulted in so bad as those\nrailway carriages, and I won't have her come by herself. If she is to\nlive with me, she shall begin decently at any rate.\"\n\nMartha argued the matter, but was of course beaten, and on the day\nfixed started early in the morning for Nuncombe Putney, and returned\nin the afternoon to the Close with her charge. By the time that she\nhad reached the house she had in some degree reconciled herself to\nthe dangerous step that her mistress had taken, partly by perceiving\nthat in face Dorothy Stanbury was very like her brother Hugh, and\npartly, perhaps, by finding that the young woman's manner to herself\nwas both gentle and sprightly. She knew well that gentleness alone,\nwithout some back-bone of strength under it, would not long succeed\nwith Miss Stanbury. \"As far as I can judge, ma'am, she's a sweet\nyoung lady,\" said Martha, when she reported her arrival to her\nmistress, who had retired up-stairs to her own room, in order that\nshe might thus hear a word of tidings from her lieutenant, before she\nshowed herself on the field of action.\n\n\"Sweet! I hate your sweets,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Then why did you send for her, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Because I was an old fool. But I must go down and receive her, I\nsuppose.\"\n\nThen Miss Stanbury went down, almost trembling as she went. The\nmatter to her was one of vital importance. She was going to change\nthe whole tenour of her life for the sake,--as she told herself,--of\ndoing her duty by a relative whom she did not even know. But we may\nfairly suppose that there had in truth been a feeling beyond that,\nwhich taught her to desire to have some one near her to whom she\nmight not only do her duty as guardian, but whom she might also love.\nShe had tried this with her nephew; but her nephew had been too\nstrong for her, too far from her, too unlike to herself. When he came\nto see her he had smoked a short pipe,--which had been shocking to\nher,--and he had spoken of Reform, and Trades' Unions, and meetings\nin the parks, as though they had not been Devil's ordinances. And he\nwas very shy of going to church,--utterly refusing to be taken there\ntwice on the same Sunday. And he had told his aunt that owing to a\npeculiar and unfortunate weakness in his constitution he could not\nlisten to the reading of sermons. And then she was almost certain\nthat he had once kissed one of the maids! She had found it impossible\nto manage him in any way; and when he positively declared himself as\npermanently devoted to the degrading iniquities of penny newspapers,\nshe had thought it best to cast him off altogether. Now, thus late in\nlife, she was going to make another venture, to try an altogether new\nmode of living,--in order, as she said to herself, that she might be\nof some use to somebody,--but, no doubt, with a further unexpressed\nhope in her bosom, that the solitude of her life might be relieved by\nthe companionship of some one whom she might love. She had arrayed\nherself in a clean cap and her evening gown, and she went down-stairs\nlooking sternly, with a fully-developed idea that she must initiate\nher new duties by assuming a mastery at once. But inwardly she\ntrembled, and was intensely anxious as to the first appearance of\nher niece. Of course there would be a little morsel of a bonnet.\nShe hated those vile patches,--dirty flat daubs of millinery as\nshe called them; but they had become too general for her to refuse\nadmittance for such a thing within her doors. But a chignon, a\nbandbox behind the noddle,--she would not endure. And then there were\nother details of feminine gear, which shall not be specified, as to\nwhich she was painfully anxious,--almost forgetting in her anxiety\nthat the dress of this young woman whom she was about to see must\nhave ever been regulated by the closest possible economy.\n\nThe first thing she saw on entering the room was a dark straw hat,\na straw hat with a strong penthouse flap to it, and her heart was\nimmediately softened.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I am glad to see you.\"\n\nDorothy, who, on her part, was trembling also, whose position was one\nto justify most intense anxiety, murmured some reply.\n\n\"Take off your hat,\" said the aunt, \"and let me give you a kiss.\"\n\nThe hat was taken off and the kiss was given. There was certainly no\nchignon there. Dorothy Stanbury was light haired, with almost flaxen\nringlets, worn after the old-fashioned way which we used to think so\npretty when we were young. She had very soft grey eyes, which ever\nseemed to beseech you to do something when they looked at you, and\nher mouth was a beseeching mouth. There are women who, even amidst\ntheir strongest efforts at giving assistance to others, always look\nas though they were asking aid themselves, and such a one was Dorothy\nStanbury. Her complexion was pale, but there was always present in\nit a tint of pink running here and there, changing with every word\nshe spoke, changing indeed with every pulse of her heart. Nothing\never was softer than her cheek; but her hands were thin and hard,\nand almost fibrous with the working of the thread upon them. She\nwas rather tall than otherwise, but that extreme look of feminine\ndependence which always accompanied her, took away something even\nfrom the appearance of her height.\n\n\"These are all real, at any rate,\" said her aunt, taking hold of the\ncurls, \"and won't be hurt by a little cold water.\"\n\nDorothy smiled but said nothing, and was then taken up to her\nbed-room. Indeed, when the aunt and niece sat down to dinner together\nDorothy had hardly spoken. But Miss Stanbury had spoken, and things\nupon the whole had gone very well.\n\n\"I hope you like roast chicken, my dear?\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\n\"And bread sauce? Jane, I do hope the bread sauce is hot.\"\n\nIf the reader thinks that Miss Stanbury was indifferent to\nconsiderations of the table, the reader is altogether ignorant of\nMiss Stanbury's character. When Miss Stanbury gave her niece the\nliver-wing, and picked out from the attendant sausages one that had\nbeen well browned and properly broken in the frying, she meant to do\na real kindness.\n\n\"And now, my dear, there are mashed potatoes and bread sauce. As for\ngreen vegetables, I don't know what has become of them. They tell me\nI may have green peas from France at a shilling a quart; but if I\ncan't have English green peas, I won't have any.\"\n\nMiss Stanbury was standing up as she said this,--as she always did on\nsuch occasions, liking to have a full mastery over the dish.\n\n\"I hope you like it, my dear?\"\n\n\"Everything is so very nice.\"\n\n\"That's right. I like to see a young woman with an appetite. Remember\nthat God sends the good things for us to eat; and as long as we\ndon't take more than our share, and give away something to those who\nhaven't a fair share of their own, I for one think it quite right to\nenjoy my victuals. Jane, this bread sauce isn't hot. It never is hot.\nDon't tell me; I know what hot is!\"\n\nDorothy thought that her aunt was very angry; but Jane knew Miss\nStanbury better, and bore the scolding without shaking in her shoes.\n\n\"And now, my dear, you must take a glass of port wine. It will do you\ngood after your journey.\"\n\nDorothy attempted to explain that she never did drink any wine, but\nher aunt talked down her scruples at once.\n\n\"One glass of port wine never did anybody any harm, and as there is\nport wine, it must be intended that somebody should drink it.\"\n\nMiss Stanbury, as she sipped hers out very slowly, seemed to enjoy it\nmuch. Although May had come, there was a fire in the grate, and she\nsat with her toes on the fender, and her silk dress folded up above\nher knees. She sat quite silent in this position for a quarter of an\nhour, every now and then raising her glass to her lips. Dorothy sat\nsilent also. To her, in the newness of her condition, speech was\nimpossible.\n\n\"I think it will do,\" said Miss Stanbury at last.\n\nAs Dorothy had no idea what would do, she could make no reply to\nthis.\n\n\"I'm sure it will do,\" said Miss Stanbury, after another short\ninterval. \"You're as like my poor sister as two eggs. You don't have\nheadaches, do you?\"\n\nDorothy said that she was not ordinarily affected in that way.\n\n\"When girls have headaches it comes from tight-lacing, and not\nwalking enough, and carrying all manner of nasty smells about with\nthem. I know what headaches mean. How is a woman not to have a\nheadache, when she carries a thing on the back of her poll as big\nas a gardener's wheel-barrow? Come, it's a fine evening, and we'll\ngo out and look at the towers. You've never even seen them yet, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nSo they went out, and finding the verger at the Cathedral door, he\nbeing a great friend of Miss Stanbury's, they walked up and down the\naisles, and Dorothy was instructed as to what would be expected from\nher in regard to the outward forms of religion. She was to go to the\nCathedral service on the morning of every week-day, and on Sundays in\nthe afternoon. On Sunday mornings she was to attend the little church\nof St. Margaret. On Sunday evenings it was the practice of Miss\nStanbury to read a sermon in the dining-room to all of whom her\nhousehold consisted. Did Dorothy like daily services? Dorothy, who\nwas more patient than her brother, and whose life had been much less\nenergetic, said that she had no objection to going to church every\nday when there was not too much to do.\n\n\"There never need be too much to do to attend the Lord's house,\" said\nMiss Stanbury, somewhat angrily.\n\n\"Only if you've got to make the beds,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"My dear, I beg your pardon,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"I beg your pardon,\nheartily. I'm a thoughtless old woman, I know. Never mind. Now, we'll\ngo in.\"\n\nLater in the evening, when she gave her niece a candlestick to go to\nbed, she repeated what she had said before.\n\n\"It'll do very well, my dear. I'm sure it'll do. But if you read in\nbed either night or morning, I'll never forgive you.\"\n\nThis last caution was uttered with so much energy, that Dorothy gave\na little jump as she promised obedience.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nSHEWING HOW THE QUARREL PROGRESSED AGAIN.\n\n\nOn one Sunday morning, when the month of May was nearly over, Hugh\nStanbury met Colonel Osborne in Curzon Street, not many yards from\nTrevelyan's door. Colonel Osborne had just come from the house, and\nStanbury was going to it. Hugh had not spoken to Osborne since the\nday, now a fortnight since, on which both of them had witnessed\nthe scene in the park; but on that occasion they had been left\ntogether, and it had been impossible for them not to say a few words\nabout their mutual friends. Osborne had expressed his sorrow that\nthere should be any misunderstanding, and had called Trevelyan a\n\"confounded fool.\" Stanbury had suggested that there was something in\nit which they two probably did not understand, and that matters would\nbe sure to come all right. \"The truth is Trevelyan bullies her,\" said\nOsborne; \"and if he goes on with that he'll be sure to get the worst\nof it.\" Now,--on this present occasion,--Stanbury asked whether he\nwould find the ladies at home. \"Yes, they are both there,\" said\nOsborne. \"Trevelyan has just gone out in a huff. She'll never be able\nto go on living with him. Anybody can see that with half an eye.\"\nThen he had passed on, and Hugh Stanbury knocked at the door.\n\nHe was shown up into the drawing-room, and found both the sisters\nthere; but he could see that Mrs. Trevelyan had been in tears. The\navowed purpose of his visit,--that is, the purpose which he had\navowed to himself,--was to talk about his sister Dorothy. He had told\nMiss Rowley, while walking in the park with her, how Dorothy had been\ninvited over to Exeter by her aunt, and how he had counselled his\nsister to accept the invitation. Nora had expressed herself very\ninterested as to Dorothy's fate, and had said how much she wished\nthat she knew Dorothy. We all understand how sweet it is, when two\nsuch persons as Hugh Stanbury and Nora Rowley cannot speak of their\nlove for each other, to say these tender things in regard to some\none else. Nora had been quite anxious to know how Dorothy had been\nreceived by that old conservative warrior, as Hugh Stanbury had\ncalled his aunt, and Hugh had now come to Curzon Street with a letter\nfrom Dorothy in his pocket. But when he saw that there had been some\ncause for trouble, he hardly knew how to introduce his subject.\n\n\"Trevelyan is not at home?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Emily, with her face turned away. \"He went out and left us\na quarter of an hour since. Did you meet Colonel Osborne?\"\n\n\"I was speaking to him in the street not a moment since.\" As he\nanswered he could see that Nora was making some sign to her sister.\nNora was most anxious that Emily should not speak of what had just\noccurred, but her signs were all thrown away. \"Somebody must tell\nhim,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, \"and I don't know who can do so better\nthan so old a friend as Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Tell what, and to whom?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Then I must tell him myself,\" said she, \"that is all. As for\nstanding this kind of life, it is out of the question. I should\neither destroy myself or go mad.\"\n\n\"If I could do any good I should be so happy,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Nobody can do any good between a man and his wife,\" said Nora.\n\nThen Mrs. Trevelyan began to tell her story, putting aside, with an\nimpatient motion of her hands, the efforts which her sister made to\nstop her. She was very angry, and as she told it, standing up, all\ntrace of sobbing soon disappeared from her voice. \"The fact is,\" she\nsaid, \"he does not know his own mind, or what to fear or what not to\nfear. He told me that I was never to see Colonel Osborne again.\"\n\n\"What is the use, Emily, of your repeating that to Mr. Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Why should I not repeat it? Colonel Osborne is papa's oldest friend,\nand mine too. He is a man I like very much,--who is a real friend to\nme. As he is old enough to be my father, one would have thought that\nmy husband could have found no objection.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about his age,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"It does make a difference. It must make a difference. I should not\nthink of becoming so intimate with a younger man. But, however, when\nmy husband told me that I was to see him no more,--though the insult\nnearly killed me, I determined to obey him. An order was given that\nColonel Osborne should not be admitted. You may imagine how painful\nit was; but it was given, and I was prepared to bear it.\"\n\n\"But he had been lunching with you on that Sunday.\"\n\n\"Yes; that is just it. As soon as it was given Louis would rescind\nit, because he was ashamed of what he had done. He was so jealous\nthat he did not want me to see the man; and yet he was so afraid that\nit should be known that he ordered me to see him. He ordered him into\nthe house at last, and I,--I went away up-stairs.\"\n\n\"That was on the Sunday that we met you in the park?\" asked Stanbury.\n\n\"What is the use of going back to all that?\" said Nora.\n\n\"Then I met him by chance in the park,\" continued Mrs. Trevelyan,\n\"and because he said a word which I knew would anger my husband, I\nleft him abruptly. Since that my husband has begged that things might\ngo on as they were before. He could not bear that Colonel Osborne\nhimself should think that he was jealous. Well; I gave way, and the\nman has been here as before. And now there has been a scene which has\nbeen disgraceful to us all. I cannot stand it, and I won't. If he\ndoes not behave himself with more manliness,--I will leave him.\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Mr. Stanbury,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Yes; you can do this. You can go to him from me, and can tell him\nthat I have chosen you as a messenger because you are his friend.\nYou can tell him that I am willing to obey him in anything. If he\nchooses, I will consent that Colonel Osborne shall be asked never\nto come into my presence again. It will be very absurd; but if he\nchooses, I will consent. Or I will let things go on as they are, and\ncontinue to receive my father's old friend when he comes. But if I\ndo, I will not put up with an imputation on my conduct because he\ndoes not like the way in which the gentleman thinks fit to address\nme. I take upon myself to say that if any man alive spoke to me as\nhe ought not to speak, I should know how to resent it myself. But I\ncannot fly into a passion with an old gentleman for calling me by my\nChristian name, when he has done so habitually for years.\"\n\nFrom all this it will appear that the great godsend of a rich\nmarriage, with all manner of attendant comforts, which had come in\nthe way of the Rowley family as they were living at the Mandarins,\nhad not turned out to be an unmixed blessing. In the matter of the\nquarrel, as it had hitherto progressed, the husband had perhaps been\nmore in the wrong than his wife; but the wife, in spite of all her\npromises of perfect obedience, had proved herself to be a woman very\nhard to manage. Had she been earnest in her desire to please her lord\nand master in this matter of Colonel Osborne's visits,--to please\nhim even after he had so vacillated in his own behests,--she might\nprobably have so received the man as to have quelled all feeling of\njealousy in her husband's bosom. But instead of doing so she had\ntold herself that as she was innocent, and as her innocence had been\nacknowledged, and as she had been specially instructed to receive\nthis man whom she had before been specially instructed not to\nreceive, she would now fall back exactly into her old manner with\nhim. She had told Colonel Osborne never to allude to that meeting\nin the park, and to ask no creature as to what had occasioned her\nconduct on that Sunday; thus having a mystery with him, which of\ncourse he understood as well as she did. And then she had again taken\nto writing notes to him and receiving notes from him,--none of which\nshe showed to her husband. She was more intimate with him than ever,\nand yet she hardly ever mentioned his name to her husband. Trevelyan,\nacknowledging to himself that he had done no good by his former\ninterference, feeling that he had put himself in the wrong on that\noccasion, and that his wife had got the better of him, had borne with\nall this, with soreness and a moody savageness of general conduct,\nbut still without further words of anger with reference to the man\nhimself. But now, on this Sunday, when his wife had been closeted\nwith Colonel Osborne in the back drawing-room, leaving him with his\nsister-in-law, his temper had become too hot for him, and he had\nsuddenly left the house, declaring that he would not walk with the\ntwo women on that day. \"Why not, Louis?\" his wife had said, coming up\nto him. \"Never mind why not, but I shall not,\" he had answered; and\nthen he left the room.\n\n\"What is the matter with him?\" Colonel Osborne had asked.\n\n\"It is impossible to say what is the matter with him,\" Mrs. Trevelyan\nhad replied. After that she had at once gone up-stairs to her child,\ntelling herself that she was doing all that the strictest propriety\ncould require in leaving the man's society as soon as her husband\nwas gone. Then there was an awkward minute or two between Nora and\nColonel Osborne, and he took his leave.\n\nStanbury at last promised that he would see Trevelyan, repeating,\nhowever, very frequently that often-used assertion, that no task\nis so hopeless as that of interfering between a man and his wife.\nNevertheless he promised, and undertook to look for Trevelyan at\nthe Acrobats on that afternoon. At last he got a moment in which\nto produce the letter from his sister, and was able to turn the\nconversation for a few minutes to his own affairs. Dorothy's letter\nwas read and discussed by both the ladies with much zeal. \"It is\nquite a strange world to me,\" said Dorothy, \"but I am beginning to\nfind myself more at my ease than I was at first. Aunt Stanbury is\nvery good-natured, and when I know what she wants, I think I shall be\nable to please her. What you said of her disposition is not so bad to\nme, as of course a girl in my position does not expect to have her\nown way.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't she have her share of her own way as well as anybody\nelse?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Poor Dorothy would never want to have her own way,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"She ought to want it,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"She has spirit enough to turn if she's trodden on,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"That's more than what most women have,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nThen he went on with the letter. \"She is very generous, and has given\nme \u00c2\u00a36 5_s._ in advance of my allowance. When I said I would send part\nof it home to mamma, she seemed to be angry, and said that she wanted\nme always to look nice about my clothes. She told me afterwards to do\nas I pleased, and that I might try my own way for the first quarter.\nSo I was frightened, and only sent thirty shillings. We went out\nthe other evening to drink tea with Mrs. MacHugh, an old lady whose\nhusband was once dean. I had to go, and it was all very nice. There\nwere a great many clergymen there, but many of them were young men.\"\n\"Poor Dorothy,\" exclaimed Nora. \"One of them was the minor canon who\nchants the service every morning. He is a bachelor--\" \"Then there is\na hope for her,\" said Nora--\"and he always talks a little as though\nhe were singing the Litany.\" \"That's very bad,\" said Nora; \"fancy\nhaving a husband to sing the Litany to you always.\" \"Better that,\nperhaps, than having him always singing something else,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan.\n\nIt was decided between them that Dorothy's state might on the whole\nbe considered as flourishing, but that Hugh was bound as a brother\nto go down to Exeter and look after her. He explained, however, that\nhe was expressly debarred from calling on his sister, even between\nthe hours of half-past nine and half-past twelve on Wednesday\nmornings, and that he could not see her at all unless he did so\nsurreptitiously.\n\n\"If I were you I would see my sister in spite of all the old viragos\nin Exeter,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"I have no idea of anybody taking so\nmuch upon themselves.\"\n\n\"You must remember, Mrs. Trevelyan, that she has taken upon herself\nmuch also in the way of kindness, in doing what perhaps I ought to\ncall charity. I wonder what I should have been doing now if it were\nnot for my Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\nHe took his leave, and went at once from Curzon Street to Trevelyan's\nclub, and found that Trevelyan had not been there as yet. In another\nhour he called again, and was about to give it up, when he met the\nman whom he was seeking on the steps.\n\n\"I was looking for you,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, here I am.\"\n\nIt was impossible not to see in the look of Trevelyan's face, and not\nto hear in the tone of his voice, that he was, at the moment, in an\nangry and unhappy frame of mind. He did not move as though he were\nwilling to accompany his friend, and seemed almost to know beforehand\nthat the approaching interview was to be an unpleasant one.\n\n\"I want to speak to you, and perhaps you wouldn't mind taking a turn\nwith me,\" said Stanbury.\n\nBut Trevelyan objected to this, and led the way into the club\nwaiting-room. A club waiting-room is always a gloomy, unpromising\nplace for a confidential conversation, and so Stanbury felt it to be\non the present occasion. But he had no alternative. There they were\ntogether, and he must do as he had promised. Trevelyan kept on his\nhat and did not sit down, and looked very gloomy. Stanbury having\nto commence without any assistance from outward auxiliaries, almost\nforgot what it was that he had promised to do.\n\n\"I have just come from Curzon Street,\" he said.\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"At least I was there about two hours ago.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter, I suppose, whether it was two hours or two\nminutes,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"Not in the least. The fact is this; I happened to come upon the two\ngirls there, when they were very unhappy, and your wife asked me to\ncome and say a word or two to you.\"\n\n\"Was Colonel Osborne there?\"\n\n\"No; I had met him in the street a minute or two before.\"\n\n\"Well, now; look here, Stanbury. If you'll take my advice, you'll\nkeep your hands out of this. It is not but that I regard you as being\nas good a friend as I have in the world; but, to own the truth, I\ncannot put up with interference between myself and my wife.\"\n\n\"Of course you understand that I only come as a messenger.\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"I only come as a messenger.\"]\n\n\n\"You had better not be a messenger in such a cause. If she has\nanything to say she can say it to myself.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand that you will not listen to me?\"\n\n\"I had rather not.\"\n\n\"I think you are wrong,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"In that matter you must allow me to judge for myself. I can easily\nunderstand that a young woman like her, especially with her sister to\nback her, should induce such a one as you to take her part.\"\n\n\"I am taking nobody's part. You wrong your wife, and you especially\nwrong Miss Rowley.\"\n\n\"If you please, Stanbury, we will say nothing more about it.\" This\nTrevelyan said holding the door of the room half open in his hand, so\nthat the other was obliged to pass out through it.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said Stanbury, with much anger.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said Trevelyan, with an assumption of indifference.\n\nStanbury went away in absolute wrath, though the trouble which he had\nhad in the interview was much less than he had anticipated, and the\nresult quite as favourable. He had known that no good would come of\nhis visit. And yet he was now full of anger against Trevelyan, and\nhad become a partisan in the matter,--which was exactly that which he\nhad resolutely determined that he would not become. \"I believe that\nno woman on earth could live with him,\" he said to himself as he\nwalked away. \"It was always the same with him,--a desire for mastery,\nwhich he did not know how to use when he had obtained it. If it were\nNora, instead of the other sister, he would break her sweet heart\nwithin a month.\"\n\nTrevelyan dined at his club, and hardly spoke a word to any one\nduring the evening. At about eleven he started to walk home, but\nwent by no means straight thither, taking a long turn through St.\nJames's Park, and by Pimlico. It was necessary that he should make\nup his mind as to what he would do. He had sternly refused the\ninterference of a friend, and he must be prepared to act on his own\nresponsibility. He knew well that he could not begin again with his\nwife on the next day as though nothing had happened. Stanbury's visit\nto him, if it had done nothing else, had made this impossible. He\ndetermined that he would not go to her room to-night, but would see\nher as early as possible in the morning;--and would then talk to her\nwith all the wisdom of which he was master.\n\nHow many husbands have come to the same resolution; and how few of\nthem have found the words of wisdom to be efficacious!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nHARD WORDS.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nIt is to be feared that men in general do not regret as they should\ndo any temporary ill-feeling, or irritating jealousy between husbands\nand wives, of which they themselves have been the cause. The author\nis not speaking now of actual love-makings, of intrigues and devilish\nvillany, either perpetrated or imagined; but rather of those passing\ngusts of short-lived and unfounded suspicion to which, as to other\naccidents, very well-regulated families may occasionally be liable.\nWhen such suspicion rises in the bosom of a wife, some woman\nintervening or being believed to intervene between her and the man\nwho is her own, that woman who has intervened or been supposed to\nintervene, will either glory in her position or bewail it bitterly,\naccording to the circumstances of the case. We will charitably\nsuppose that, in a great majority of such instances, she will bewail\nit. But when such painful jealous doubts annoy the husband, the\nman who is in the way will almost always feel himself justified in\nextracting a slightly pleasurable sensation from the transaction.\nHe will say to himself probably, unconsciously indeed, and with\nno formed words, that the husband is an ass, an ass if he be in\na twitter either for that which he has kept or for that which he\nhas been unable to keep, that the lady has shewn a good deal of\nappreciation, and that he himself is--is--is--quite a Captain bold\nof Halifax. All the while he will not have the slightest intention\nof wronging the husband's honour, and will have received no greater\nfavour from the intimacy accorded to him than the privilege of\nrunning on one day to Marshall and Snellgrove's, the haberdashers,\nand on another to Handcocks', the jewellers. If he be allowed to buy\na present or two, or to pay a few shillings here or there, he has\nachieved much. Terrible things now and again do occur, even here in\nEngland; but women, with us, are slow to burn their household gods.\nIt happens, however, occasionally, as we are all aware, that the\noutward garments of a domestic deity will be a little scorched; and\nwhen this occurs, the man who is the interloper, will generally find\na gentle consolation in his position, let its interest be ever so\nflaccid and unreal, and its troubles in running about, and the like,\never so considerable and time-destructive.\n\nIt was so certainly with Colonel Osborne when he became aware that\nhis intimacy with Mrs. Trevelyan had caused her husband uneasiness.\nHe was not especially a vicious man, and had now, as we know, reached\na time of life when such vice as that in question might be supposed\nto have lost its charm for him. A gentleman over fifty, popular\nin London, with a seat in Parliament, fond of good dinners, and\npossessed of everything which the world has to give, could hardly\nhave wished to run away with his neighbour's wife, or to have\ndestroyed the happiness of his old friend's daughter. Such wickedness\nhad never come into his head; but he had a certain pleasure in being\nthe confidential friend of a very pretty woman; and when he heard\nthat that pretty woman's husband was jealous, the pleasure was\nenhanced rather than otherwise. On that Sunday, as he had left the\nhouse in Curzon Street, he had told Stanbury that Trevelyan had just\ngone off in a huff, which was true enough, and he had walked from\nthence down Clarges Street, and across Piccadilly to St. James's\nStreet, with a jauntier step than usual, because he was aware that he\nhimself had been the occasion of that trouble. This was very wrong;\nbut there is reason to believe that many such men as Colonel Osborne,\nwho are bachelors at fifty, are equally malicious.\n\nHe thought a good deal about it on that evening, and was still\nthinking about it on the following morning. He had promised to go up\nto Curzon Street on the Monday,--really on some most trivial mission,\non a matter of business which no man could have taken in hand whose\ntime was of the slightest value to himself or any one else. But now\nthat mission assumed an importance in his eyes, and seemed to require\neither a special observance or a special excuse. There was no real\nreason why he should not have stayed away from Curzon Street for the\nnext fortnight; and had he done so he need have made no excuse to\nMrs. Trevelyan when he met her. But the opportunity for a little\nexcitement was not to be missed, and instead of going he wrote to her\nthe following note:--\n\n\n   Albany, Monday.\n\n   DEAR EMILY,\n\n   What was it all about yesterday? I was to have come up\n   with the words of that opera, but perhaps it will be\n   better to send it. If it be not wicked, do tell me whether\n   I am to consider myself as a banished man. I thought that\n   our little meetings were so innocent,--and so pleasant!\n   The green-eyed monster is of all monsters the most\n   monstrous,--and the most unreasonable. Pray let me have a\n   line, if it be not forbidden.\n\n   Yours always heartily,\n\n   F. O.\n\n   Putting aside all joking, I beg you to remember that I\n   consider myself always entitled to be regarded by you as\n   your most sincere friend.\n\n\nWhen this was brought to Mrs. Trevelyan, about twelve o'clock in\nthe day, she had already undergone the infliction of those words\nof wisdom which her husband had prepared for her, and which were\nthreatened at the close of the last chapter. Her husband had come\nup to her while she was yet in her bed-room, and had striven hard\nto prevail against her. But his success had been very doubtful. In\nregard to the number of words, Mrs. Trevelyan certainly had had\nthe best of it. As far as any understanding, one of another, was\nconcerned, the conversation had been useless. She believed herself to\nbe injured and aggrieved, and would continue so to assert, let him\nimplore her to listen to him as loudly as he might. \"Yes;--I will\nlisten, and I will obey you,\" she had said, \"but I will not endure\nsuch insults without telling you that I feel them.\" Then he had left\nher, fully conscious that he had failed, and went forth out of his\nhouse into the City, to his club, to wander about the streets, not\nknowing what he had best do to bring back that state of tranquillity\nat home which he felt to be so desirable.\n\nMrs. Trevelyan was alone when Colonel Osborne's note was brought to\nher, and was at that moment struggling with herself in anger against\nher husband. If he laid any command upon her, she would execute it;\nbut she would never cease to tell him that he had ill-used her. She\nwould din it into his ears, let him come to her as often as he might\nwith his wise words. Wise words! What was the use of wise words when\na man was such a fool in nature? And as for Colonel Osborne,--she\nwould see him if he came to her three times a day, unless her husband\ngave some clearly intelligible order to the contrary. She was\nfortifying her mind with this resolution when Colonel Osborne's\nletter was brought to her. She asked whether any servant was waiting\nfor an answer. No,--the servant, who had left it, had gone at once.\nShe read the note, and sat working, with it before her, for a quarter\nof an hour; and then walked over to her desk and answered it.\n\n\n   MY DEAR COLONEL OSBORNE,\n\n   It will be best to say nothing whatever about the\n   occurrence of yesterday; and if possible, not to\n   think of it. As far as I am concerned, I wish for no\n   change;--except that people should be more reasonable.\n   You can call of course whenever you please; and I am very\n   grateful for your expression of friendship.\n\n   Yours most sincerely,\n\n   EMILY TREVELYAN.\n\n   Thanks for the words of the opera.\n\n\nWhen she had written this, being determined that all should be open\nand above board, she put a penny stamp on the envelope, and desired\nthat the letter should be posted. But she destroyed that which she\nhad received from Colonel Osborne. In all things she would act as she\nwould have done if her husband had not been so foolish, and there\ncould have been no reason why she should have kept so unimportant a\ncommunication.\n\nIn the course of the day Trevelyan passed through the hall to the\nroom which he himself was accustomed to occupy behind the parlour,\nand as he did so saw the note lying ready to be posted, took it up,\nand read the address. He held it for a moment in his hand, then\nreplaced it on the hall table, and passed on. When he reached his own\ntable he sat down hurriedly, and took up in his hand some Review that\nwas lying ready for him to read. But he was quite unable to fix his\nmind upon the words before him. He had spoken to his wife on that\nmorning in the strongest language he could use as to the unseemliness\nof her intimacy with Colonel Osborne; and then, the first thing she\nhad done when his back was turned was to write to this very Colonel\nOsborne, and tell him, no doubt, what had occurred between her and\nher husband. He sat thinking of it all for many minutes. He would\nprobably have declared himself that he had thought of it for an hour\nas he sat there. Then he got up, went up-stairs and walked slowly\ninto the drawing-room. There he found his wife sitting with her\nsister. \"Nora,\" he said, \"I want to speak to Emily. Will you forgive\nme, if I ask you to leave us for a few minutes?\" Nora, with an\nanxious look at Emily, got up and left the room.\n\n\"Why do you send her away?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Because I wish to be alone with you for a few minutes. Since what I\nsaid to you this morning, you have written to Colonel Osborne.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I have. I do not know how you have found it out; but I suppose\nyou keep a watch on me.\"\n\n\"I keep no watch on you. As I came into the house, I saw your letter\nlying in the hall.\"\n\n\"Very well. You could have read it if you pleased.\"\n\n\"Emily, this matter is becoming very serious, and I strongly advise\nyou to be on your guard in what you say. I will bear much for you,\nand much for our boy; but I will not bear to have my name made a\nreproach.\"\n\n\"Sir, if you think your name is shamed by me, we had better part,\"\nsaid Mrs. Trevelyan, rising from her chair, and confronting him with\na look before which his own almost quailed.\n\n\"It may be that we had better part,\" he said, slowly. \"But in the\nfirst place I wish you to tell me what were the contents of that\nletter.\"\n\n\"If it was there when you came in, no doubt it is there still. Go and\nlook at it.\"\n\n\"That is no answer to me. I have desired you to tell me what are its\ncontents.\"\n\n\"I shall not tell you. I will not demean myself by repeating anything\nso insignificant in my own justification. If you suspect me of\nwriting what I should not write, you will suspect me also of lying to\nconceal it.\"\n\n\"Have you heard from Colonel Osborne this morning?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"And where is his letter?\"\n\n\"I have destroyed it.\"\n\nAgain he paused, trying to think what he had better do, trying to be\ncalm. And she stood still opposite to him, confronting him with the\nscorn of her bright angry eyes. Of course, he was not calm. He was\nthe very reverse of calm. \"And you refuse to tell me what you wrote,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"The letter is there,\" she answered, pointing away towards the door.\n\"If you want to play the spy, go and look at it for yourself.\"\n\n\"Do you call me a spy?\"\n\n\"And what have you called me? Because you are a husband, is the\nprivilege of vituperation to be all on your side?\"\n\n\"It is impossible that I should put up with this,\" he said;--\"quite\nimpossible. This would kill me. Anything is better than this. My\npresent orders to you are not to see Colonel Osborne, not to write\nto him or have any communication with him, and to put under cover to\nme, unopened, any letter that may come from him. I shall expect your\nimplicit obedience to these orders.\"\n\n\"Well;--go on.\"\n\n\"Have I your promise?\"\n\n\"No;--no. You have no promise. I will make no promise exacted from me\nin so disgraceful a manner.\"\n\n\"You refuse to obey me?\"\n\n\"I will refuse nothing, and will promise nothing.\"\n\n\"Then we must part;--that is all. I will take care that you shall\nhear from me before to-morrow morning.\"\n\nSo saying, he left the room, and, passing through the hall, saw that\nthe letter had been taken away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nLADY MILBOROUGH AS AMBASSADOR.\n\n\n\"Of course, I know you are right,\" said Nora to her sister;--\"right\nas far as Colonel Osborne is concerned; but nevertheless you ought to\ngive way.\"\n\n\"And be trampled upon?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Yes; and be trampled upon, if he should trample on you;--which,\nhowever, he is the last man in the world to do.\"\n\n\"And to endure any insult and any names? You yourself--you would be a\nGriselda, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk about myself,\" said Nora, \"nor about Griselda.\nBut I know that, however unreasonable it may seem, you had better\ngive way to him now and tell him what there was in the note to\nColonel Osborne.\"\n\n\"Never! He has ordered me not to see him or to write to him, or to\nopen his letters,--having, mind you, ordered just the reverse a day\nor two before; and I will obey him. Absurd as it is, I will obey him.\nBut as for submitting to him, and letting him suppose that I think\nhe is right;--never! I should be lying to him then, and I will never\nlie to him. He has said that we must part, and I suppose it will be\nbetter so. How can a woman live with a man that suspects her? He\ncannot take my baby from me.\"\n\nThere were many such conversations as the above between the two\nsisters before Mrs. Trevelyan received from her husband the\ncommunication with which she had been threatened. And Nora, acting on\nher own judgment in the matter, made an attempt to see Mr. Trevelyan,\nwriting to him a pretty little note, and beseeching him to be kind to\nher. But he declined to see her, and the two women sat at home, with\nthe baby between them, holding such pleasant conversations as that\nabove narrated. When such tempests occur in a family, a woman will\ngenerally suffer the least during the thick of the tempest. While\nthe hurricane is at the fiercest, she will be sustained by the most\nthorough conviction that the right is on her side, that she is\naggrieved, that there is nothing for her to acknowledge, and no\nposition that she need surrender. Whereas her husband will desire a\ncompromise, even amidst the violence of the storm. But afterwards,\nwhen the wind has lulled, but while the heavens around are still all\nblack and murky, then the woman's sufferings begin. When passion\ngives way to thought and memory, she feels the loneliness of her\nposition,--the loneliness, and the possible degradation. It is all\nvery well for a man to talk about his name and his honour; but it is\nthe woman's honour and the woman's name that are, in truth, placed in\njeopardy. Let the woman do what she will, the man can, in truth, show\nhis face in the world;--and, after awhile, does show his face. But\nthe woman may be compelled to veil hers, either by her own fault, or\nby his. Mrs. Trevelyan was now told that she was to be separated from\nher husband, and she did not, at any rate, believe that she had done\nany harm. But, if such separation did come, where could she live,\nwhat could she do, what position in the world would she possess?\nWould not her face be, in truth, veiled as effectually as though she\nhad disgraced herself and her husband?\n\nAnd then there was that terrible question about the child. Mrs.\nTrevelyan had said a dozen times to her sister that her husband could\nnot take the boy away from her. Nora, however, had never assented to\nthis, partly from a conviction of her own ignorance, not knowing what\nmight be the power of a husband in such a matter, and partly thinking\nthat any argument would be good and fair by which she could induce\nher sister to avoid a catastrophe so terrible as that which was now\nthreatened.\n\n\"I suppose he could take him, if he chose,\" she said at last.\n\n\"I don't believe he is wicked like that,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"He\nwould not wish to kill me.\"\n\n\"But he will say that he loves baby as well as you do.\"\n\n\"He will never take my child from me. He could never be so bad as\nthat.\"\n\n\"And you will never be so bad as to leave him,\" said Nora after a\npause. \"I will not believe that it can come to that. You know that he\nis good at heart,--that nobody on earth loves you as he does.\"\n\nSo they went on for two days, and on the evening of the second day\nthere came a letter from Trevelyan to his wife. They had neither of\nthem seen him, although he had been in and out of the house. And\non the afternoon of the Sunday a new grievance, a very terrible\ngrievance, was added to those which Mrs. Trevelyan was made to bear.\nHer husband had told one of the servants in the house that Colonel\nOsborne was not to be admitted. And the servant to whom he had given\nthis order was the--cook. There is no reason why a cook should be\nless trustworthy in such a matter than any other servant; and in\nMr. Trevelyan's household there was a reason why she should be more\nso,--as she, and she alone, was what we generally call an old family\ndomestic. She had lived with her master's mother, and had known her\nmaster when he was a boy. Looking about him, therefore, for some one\nin his house to whom he could speak,--feeling that he was bound to\nconvey the order through some medium,--he called to him the ancient\ncook, and imparted to her so much of his trouble as was necessary\nto make the order intelligible. This he did with various ill-worded\nassurances to Mrs. Prodgers that there really was nothing amiss. But\nwhen Mrs. Trevelyan heard what had been done,--which she did from\nMrs. Prodgers herself, Mrs. Prodgers having been desired by her\nmaster to make the communication,--she declared to her sister that\neverything was now over. She could never again live with a husband\nwho had disgraced his wife by desiring her own cook to keep a guard\nupon her. Had the footman been instructed not to admit Colonel\nOsborne, there would have been in such instruction some apparent\nadherence to the recognised usages of society. If you do not desire\neither your friend or your enemy to be received into your house, you\ncommunicate your desire to the person who has charge of the door. But\nthe cook!\n\n\"And now, Nora, if it were you, do you mean to say that you would\nremain with him?\" asked Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nNora simply replied that anything under any circumstances would be\nbetter than a separation.\n\nOn the morning of the third day there came the following letter:--\n\n\n   Wednesday, June 1, 12 midnight.\n\n   DEAREST EMILY,\n\n   You will readily believe me when I say that I never in my\n   life was so wretched as I have been during the last two\n   days. That you and I should be in the same house together\n   and not able to speak to each other is in itself a misery,\n   but this is terribly enhanced by the dread lest this state\n   of things should be made to continue.\n\n   I want you to understand that I do not in the least\n   suspect you of having as yet done anything wrong,--or\n   having even said anything injurious either to my position\n   as your husband, or to your position as my wife. But I\n   cannot but perceive that you are allowing yourself to be\n   entrapped into an intimacy with Colonel Osborne which if\n   it be not checked, will be destructive to my happiness and\n   your own. After what had passed before, you cannot have\n   thought it right to receive letters from him which I was\n   not to see, or to write letters to him of which I was\n   not to know the contents. It must be manifest to you that\n   such conduct on your part is wrong as judged by any of\n   the rules by which a wife's conduct can be measured.\n   And yet you have refused even to say that this shall be\n   discontinued! I need hardly explain to you that if you\n   persist in this refusal you and I cannot continue to live\n   together as man and wife. All my hopes and prospects in\n   life will be blighted by such a separation. I have not as\n   yet been able to think what I should do in such wretched\n   circumstances. And for you, as also for Nora, such a\n   catastrophe would be most lamentable. Do, therefore, think\n   of it well, and write me such a letter as may bring me\n   back to your side.\n\n   There is only one friend in the world to whom I could\n   endure to talk of this great grief, and I have been to\n   her and told her everything. You will know that I mean\n   Lady Milborough. After much difficult conversation I\n   have persuaded her to see you, and she will call in\n   Curzon Street to-morrow about twelve. There can be no\n   kinder-hearted, or more gentle woman in the world than\n   Lady Milborough; nor did any one ever have a warmer friend\n   than both you and I have in her. Let me implore you then\n   to listen to her, and be guided by her advice.\n\n   Pray believe, dearest Emily, that I am now, as ever, your\n   most affectionate husband, and that I have no wish so\n   strong as that we should not be compelled to part.\n\n   LOUIS TREVELYAN.\n\n\nThis epistle was, in many respects, a very injudicious composition.\nTrevelyan should have trusted either to the eloquence of his own\nwritten words, or to that of the ambassador whom he was about to\ndespatch; but by sending both he weakened both. And then there were\ncertain words in the letter which were odious to Mrs. Trevelyan, and\nmust have been odious to any young wife. He had said that he did not\n\"as yet\" suspect her of having done anything wrong. And then, when\nhe endeavoured to explain to her that a separation would be very\ninjurious to herself, he had coupled her sister with her, thus\nseeming to imply that the injury to be avoided was of a material\nkind. She had better do what he told her, as, otherwise, she and her\nsister would not have a roof over their head! That was the nature of\nthe threat which his words were supposed to convey.\n\nThe matter had become so serious, that Mrs. Trevelyan, haughty and\nstiff-necked as she was, did not dare to abstain from showing the\nletter to her sister. She had no other counsellor, at any rate, till\nLady Milborough came, and the weight of the battle was too great for\nher own unaided spirit. The letter had been written late at night, as\nwas shown by the precision of the date, and had been brought to her\nearly in the morning. At first she had determined to say nothing\nabout it to Nora, but she was not strong enough to maintain such a\npurpose. She felt that she needed the poor consolation of discussing\nher wretchedness. She first declared that she would not see Lady\nMilborough. \"I hate her, and she knows that I hate her, and she ought\nnot to have thought of coming,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nBut she was at last beaten out of this purpose by Nora's argument,\nthat all the world would be against her if she refused to see her\nhusband's old friend. And then, though the letter was an odious\nletter, as she declared a dozen times, she took some little\ncomfort in the fact that not a word was said in it about the baby.\nShe thought that if she could take her child with her into any\nseparation, she could endure it, and her husband would ultimately be\nconquered.\n\n\"Yes; I'll see her,\" she said, as they finished the discussion. \"As\nhe chooses to send her, I suppose I had better see her. But I don't\nthink he does much to mend matters when he sends the woman whom he\nknows I dislike more than any other in all London.\"\n\nExactly at twelve o'clock Lady Milborough's carriage was at the door.\nTrevelyan was in the house at the time and heard the knock at the\ndoor. During those two or three days of absolute wretchedness,\nhe spent most of his hours under the same roof with his wife and\nsister-in-law, though he spoke to neither of them. He had had his\ndoubts as to the reception of Lady Milborough, and was, to tell\nthe truth, listening with most anxious ear, when her ladyship was\nannounced. His wife, however, was not so bitterly contumacious as\nto refuse admittance to his friend, and he heard the rustle of the\nponderous silk as the old woman was shown up-stairs. When Lady\nMilborough reached the drawing-room, Mrs. Trevelyan was alone.\n\n\"I had better see her by myself,\" she had said to her sister.\n\nNora had then left her, with one word of prayer that she would be as\nlittle defiant as possible.\n\n\"That must depend,\" Emily had said, with a little shake of her head.\n\nThere had been a suggestion that the child should be with her, but\nthe mother herself had rejected this.\n\n\"It would be stagey,\" she had said, \"and clap-trap. There is nothing\nI hate so much as that.\"\n\nShe was sitting, therefore, quite alone, and as stiff as a man in\narmour, when Lady Milborough was shown up to her.\n\nAnd Lady Milborough herself was not at all comfortable as she\ncommenced the interview. She had prepared many wise words to be\nspoken, but was not so little ignorant of the character of the woman\nwith whom she had to deal, as to suppose that the wise words would\nget themselves spoken without interruption. She had known from the\nfirst that Mrs. Trevelyan would have much to say for herself, and the\nfeeling that it would be so became stronger than ever as she entered\nthe room. The ordinary feelings between the two ladies were cold and\nconstrained, and then there was silence for a few moments when the\nCountess had taken her seat. Mrs. Trevelyan had quite determined that\nthe enemy should fire the first shot.\n\n\"This is a very sad state of things,\" said the Countess.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"The saddest in the world;--and so unnecessary;--is it not?\"\n\n\"Very unnecessary, indeed, as I think.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, yes. But, of course, we must remember--\"\n\nThen Lady Milborough could not clearly bring to her mind what it was\nthat she had to remember.\n\n\"The fact is, my dear, that all this kind of thing is too monstrous\nto be thought of. Goodness, gracious, me; two young people like you\nand Louis, who thoroughly love each other, and who have got a baby,\nto think of being separated! Of course it is out of the question.\"\n\n\"You cannot suppose, Lady Milborough, that I want to be separated\nfrom my husband?\"\n\n\"Of course not. How should it be possible? The very idea is too\nshocking to be thought of. I declare I haven't slept since Louis\nwas talking to me about it. But, my dear, you must remember, you\nknow, that a husband has a right to expect some--some--some--a sort\nof--submission from his wife.\"\n\n\"He has a right to expect obedience, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"Of course; that is all one wants.\"\n\n\"And I will obey Mr. Trevelyan--in anything reasonable.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, who is to say what is reasonable? That, you see, is\nalways the difficulty. You must allow that your husband is the person\nwho ought to decide that.\"\n\n\"Has he told you that I have refused to obey him, Lady Milborough?\"\n\nThe Countess paused a moment before she replied. \"Well, yes; I think\nhe has,\" she said. \"He asked you to do something about a letter,--a\nletter to that Colonel Osborne, who is a man, my dear, really to be\nvery much afraid of; a man who has done a great deal of harm,--and\nyou declined. Now in a matter of that kind of course the husband--\"\n\n\"Lady Milborough, I must ask you to listen to me. You have listened\nto Mr. Trevelyan, and I must ask you to listen to me. I am sorry\nto trouble you, but as you have come here about this unpleasant\nbusiness, you must forgive me if I insist upon it.\"\n\n\"Of course I will listen to you, my dear.\"\n\n\"I have never refused to obey my husband, and I do not refuse now.\nThe gentleman of whom you have been speaking is an old friend of my\nfather's, and has become my friend. Nevertheless, had Mr. Trevelyan\ngiven me any plain order about him, I should have obeyed him. A\nwife does not feel that her chances of happiness are increased when\nshe finds that her husband suspects her of being too intimate with\nanother man. It is a thing very hard to bear. But I would have\nendeavoured to bear it, knowing how important it is for both our\nsakes, and more especially for our child. I would have made excuses,\nand would have endeavoured to think that this horrid feeling on his\npart is nothing more than a short delusion.\"\n\n\"But my dear--\"\n\n\"I must ask you to hear me out, Lady Milborough. But when he tells me\nfirst that I am not to meet the man, and so instructs the servants;\nthen tells me that I am to meet him, and go on just as I was going\nbefore, and then again tells me that I am not to see him, and again\ninstructs the servants,--and, above all, the cook!--that Colonel\nOsborne is not to come into the house, then obedience becomes rather\ndifficult.\"\n\n\"Just say now that you will do what he wants, and then all will be\nright.\"\n\n\"I will not say so to you, Lady Milborough. It is not to you that\nI ought to say it. But as he has chosen to send you here, I will\nexplain to you that I have never disobeyed him. When I was free, in\naccordance with Mr. Trevelyan's wishes, to have what intercourse I\npleased with Colonel Osborne, I received a note from that gentleman\non a most trivial matter. I answered it as trivially. My husband saw\nmy letter, closed, and questioned me about it. I told him that the\nletter was still there, and that if he chose to be a spy upon my\nactions he could open it and read it.\"\n\n\"My dear, how could you bring yourself to use the word spy to your\nhusband?\"\n\n\"How could he bring himself to accuse me as he did? If he cares for\nme let him come and beg my pardon for the insult he has offered me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Trevelyan,--\"\n\n\"Yes; that seems very wrong to you, who have not had to bear it. It\nis very easy for a stranger to take a husband's part, and help to put\ndown a poor woman who has been ill-used. I have done nothing wrong,\nnothing to be ashamed of; and I will not say that I have. I never\nhave spoken a word to Colonel Osborne that all the world might not\nhear.\"\n\n\"Nobody has accused you, my dear.\"\n\n\"Yes; he has accused me, and you have accused me, and you will make\nall the world accuse me. He may put me out of his house if he likes,\nbut he shall not make me say I have been wrong, when I know I have\nbeen right. He cannot take my child from me.\"\n\n\"But he will.\"\n\n\"No,\" shouted Mrs. Trevelyan, jumping up from her chair, \"no; he\nshall never do that. I will cling to him so that he cannot separate\nus. He will never be so wicked,--such a monster as that. I would go\nabout the world saying what a monster he had been to me.\" The passion\nof the interview was becoming too great for Lady Milborough's power\nof moderating it, and she was beginning to feel herself to be in a\ndifficulty. \"Lady Milborough,\" continued Mrs. Trevelyan, \"tell him\nfrom me that I will bear anything but that. That I will not bear.\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Trevelyan, do not let us talk about it.\"\n\n\"Who wants to talk about it? Why do you come here and threaten me\nwith a thing so horrible? I do not believe you. He would not dare to\nseparate me and my--child.\"\n\n\"But you have only to say that you will submit yourself to him.\"\n\n\"I have submitted myself to him, and I will submit no further. What\ndoes he want? Why does he send you here? He does not know what he\nwants. He has made himself miserable by an absurd idea, and he wants\neverybody to tell him that he has been right. He has been very wrong;\nand if he desires to be wise now, he will come back to his home,\nand say nothing further about it. He will gain nothing by sending\nmessengers here.\"\n\nLady Milborough, who had undertaken a most disagreeable task from\nthe purest motives of old friendship, did not like being called a\nmessenger; but the woman before her was so strong in her words, so\neager, and so passionate, that she did not know how to resent the\ninjury. And there was coming over her an idea, of which she herself\nwas hardly conscious, that after all, perhaps, the husband was not in\nthe right. She had come there with the general idea that wives, and\nespecially young wives, should be submissive. She had naturally taken\nthe husband's part; and having a preconceived dislike to Colonel\nOsborne, she had been willing enough to think that precautionary\nmeasures were necessary in reference to so eminent, and notorious,\nand experienced a Lothario. She had never altogether loved Mrs.\nTrevelyan, and had always been a little in dread of her. But she had\nthought that the authority with which she would be invested on this\noccasion, the manifest right on her side, and the undeniable truth of\nher grand argument, that a wife should obey, would carry her, if not\neasily, still successfully through all difficulties. It was probably\nthe case that Lady Milborough when preparing for her visit, had\nanticipated a triumph. But when she had been closeted for an hour\nwith Mrs. Trevelyan, she found that she was not triumphant. She was\ntold that she was a messenger, and an unwelcome messenger; and she\nbegan to feel that she did not know how she was to take herself away.\n\n\"I am sure I have done everything for the best,\" she said, getting up\nfrom her chair.\n\n\"The best will be to send him back, and make him feel the truth.\"\n\n\"The best for you, my dear, will be to consider well what should be\nthe duty of a wife.\"\n\n\"I have considered, Lady Milborough. It cannot be a wife's duty to\nacknowledge that she has been wrong in such a matter as this.\"\n\nThen Lady Milborough made her curtsey and got herself away in some\nmanner that was sufficiently awkward, and Mrs. Trevelyan curtseyed\nalso as she rang the bell; and, though she was sore and wretched,\nand, in truth, sadly frightened, she was not awkward. In that\nencounter, so far as it had gone, she had been the victor.\n\nAs soon as she was alone and the carriage had been driven well away\nfrom the door, Mrs. Trevelyan left the drawing-room and went up to\nthe nursery. As she entered she clothed her face with her sweetest\nsmile. \"How is his own mother's dearest, dearest, darling duck?\"\nshe said, putting out her arms and taking the boy from the nurse.\nThe child was at this time about ten months old, and was a strong,\nhearty, happy infant, always laughing when he was awake and always\nsleeping when he did not laugh, because his little limbs were\nfree from pain and his little stomach was not annoyed by internal\ntroubles. He kicked, and crowed, and sputtered, when his mother took\nhim, and put up his little fingers to clutch her hair, and was to her\nas a young god upon the earth. Nothing in the world had ever been\ncreated so beautiful, so joyous, so satisfactory, so divine! And they\ntold her that this apple of her eye was to be taken away from her!\nNo;--that must be impossible. \"I will take him into my own room,\nnurse, for a little while--you have had him all the morning,\" she\nsaid; as though the \"having baby\" was a privilege over which there\nmight almost be a quarrel. Then she took her boy away with her,\nand when she was alone with him, went through such a service in\nbaby-worship as most mothers will understand. Divide these two! No;\nnobody should do that. Sooner than that, she, the mother, would\nconsent to be no more than a servant in her husband's house. Was not\nher baby all the world to her?\n\nOn the evening of that day the husband and wife had an interview\ntogether in the library, which, unfortunately, was as unsatisfactory\nas Lady Milborough's visit. The cause of the failure of them all\nlay probably in this,--that there was no decided point which, if\nconceded, would have brought about a reconciliation. Trevelyan asked\nfor general submission, which he regarded as his right, and which in\nthe existing circumstances he thought it necessary to claim, and\nthough Mrs. Trevelyan did not refuse to be submissive she would make\nno promise on the subject. But the truth was that each desired that\nthe other should acknowledge a fault, and that neither of them would\nmake that acknowledgment. Emily Trevelyan felt acutely that she\nhad been ill-used, not only by her husband's suspicion, but by the\nmanner in which he had talked of his suspicion to others,--to Lady\nMilborough and the cook, and she was quite convinced that she was\nright herself, because he had been so vacillating in his conduct\nabout Colonel Osborne. But Trevelyan was equally sure that justice\nwas on his side. Emily must have known his real wishes about Colonel\nOsborne; but when she had found that he had rescinded his verbal\norders about the admission of the man to the house,--which he had\ndone to save himself and her from slander and gossip,--she had taken\nadvantage of this and had thrown herself more entirely than ever into\nthe intimacy of which he disapproved! When they met, each was so sore\nthat no approach to terms was made by them.\n\n\"If I am to be treated in that way, I would rather not live with\nyou,\" said the wife. \"It is impossible to live with a husband who is\njealous.\"\n\n\"All I ask of you is that you shall promise me to have no further\ncommunication with this man.\"\n\n\"I will make no promise that implies my own disgrace.\"\n\n\"Then we must part; and if that be so, this house will be given up.\nYou may live where you please,--in the country, not in London; but I\nshall take steps that Colonel Osborne does not see you.\"\n\n\"I will not remain in the room with you to be insulted thus,\" said\nMrs. Trevelyan. And she did not remain, but left the chamber,\nslamming the door after her as she went.\n\n\"It will be better that she should go,\" said Trevelyan, when he found\nhimself alone. And so it came to pass that that blessing of a rich\nmarriage, which had as it were fallen upon them at the Mandarins from\nout of heaven, had become, after an interval of but two short years,\nanything but an unmixed blessing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nMISS STANBURY'S GENEROSITY.\n\n\nOn one Wednesday morning early in June, great preparations were being\nmade at the brick house in the Close at Exeter for an event which can\nhardly be said to have required any preparation at all. Mrs. Stanbury\nand her elder daughter were coming into Exeter from Nuncombe Putney\nto visit Dorothy. The reader may perhaps remember that when Miss\nStanbury's invitation was sent to her niece, she was pleased to\npromise that such visits should be permitted on a Wednesday morning.\nSuch a visit was now to be made, and old Miss Stanbury was quite\nmoved by the occasion. \"I shall not see them, you know, Martha,\" she\nhad said, on the afternoon of the preceding day.\n\n\"I suppose not, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Why should I? It would do no good.\"\n\n\"It is not for me to say, ma'am, of course.\"\n\n\"No, Martha, it is not. And I am sure that I am right. It's no good\ngoing back and undoing in ten minutes what twenty years have done.\nShe's a poor harmless creature, I believe.\"\n\n\"The most harmless in the world, ma'am.\"\n\n\"But she was as bad as poison to me when she was young, and what's\nthe good of trying to change it now? If I was to tell her that I\nloved her, I should only be lying.\"\n\n\"Then, ma'am, I would not say it.\"\n\n\"And I don't mean. But you'll take in some wine and cake, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't think they'll care for wine and cake.\"\n\n\"Will you do as I tell you? What matters whether they care for it or\nnot? They need not take it. It will look better for Miss Dorothy.\nIf Dorothy is to remain here I shall choose that she should be\nrespected.\" And so the question of the cake and wine had been decided\novernight. But when the morning came Miss Stanbury was still in\na twitter. Half-past ten had been the hour fixed for the visit,\nin consequence of there being a train in from Lessboro', due at\nthe Exeter station at ten. As Miss Stanbury breakfasted always\nat half-past eight, there was no need of hurry on account of the\nexpected visit. But, nevertheless, she was in a fuss all the morning;\nand spoke of the coming period as one in which she must necessarily\nput herself into solitary confinement.\n\n\"Perhaps your mamma will be cold,\" she said, \"and will expect a\nfire.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"It could be lighted of course. It is a pity they should come just so\nas to prevent you from going to morning service; is it not?\"\n\n\"I could go with you, aunt, and be back very nearly in time. They\nwon't mind waiting a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"What; and have them here all alone! I wouldn't think of such a\nthing. I shall go up-stairs. You had better come to me when they are\ngone. Don't hurry them. I don't want you to hurry them at all; and\nif you require anything, Martha will wait upon you. I have told the\ngirls to keep out of the way. They are so giddy, there's no knowing\nwhat they might be after. Besides,--they've got their work to mind.\"\n\nAll this was very terrible to poor Dorothy, who had not as yet quite\nrecovered from the original fear with which her aunt had inspired\nher,--so terrible that she was almost sorry that her mother and\nsister were coming to her. When the knock was heard at the door,\nprecisely as the cathedral clock was striking half-past ten,--to\nsecure which punctuality, and thereby not to offend the owner of the\nmansion, Mrs. Stanbury and Priscilla had been walking about the Close\nfor the last ten minutes,--Miss Stanbury was still in the parlour.\n\n\"There they are!\" she exclaimed, jumping up. \"They haven't given\na body much time to run away, have they, my dear? Half a minute,\nMartha,--just half a minute!\" Then she gathered up her things as\nthough she had been ill-treated in being driven to make so sudden a\nretreat, and Martha, as soon as the last hem of her mistress's dress\nhad become invisible on the stairs, opened the front door for the\nvisitors.\n\n\"Do you mean to say you like it?\" said Priscilla, when they had been\nthere about a quarter of an hour.\n\n\"H--u--sh,\" whispered Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"I don't suppose she's listening at the door,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Indeed, she's not,\" said Dorothy. \"There can't be a truer, honester\nwoman, than Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"But is she kind to you, Dolly?\" asked the mother.\n\n\"Very kind; too kind. Only I don't understand her quite, and then\nshe gets angry with me. I know she thinks I'm a fool, and that's the\nworst of it.\"\n\n\"Then, if I were you, I would come home,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"She'll never forgive you if you do,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"And who need care about her forgiveness?\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"I don't mean to go home yet, at any rate,\" said Dorothy. Then there\nwas a knock at the door, and Martha entered with the cake and wine.\n\"Miss Stanbury's compliments, ladies, and she hopes you'll take a\nglass of sherry.\" Whereupon she filled out the glasses and carried\nthem round.\n\n\"Pray give my compliments and thanks to my sister Stanbury,\" said\nDorothy's mother. But Priscilla put down the glass of wine without\ntouching it, and looked her sternest at the maid.\n\nAltogether, the visit was not very successful, and poor Dorothy\nalmost felt that if she chose to remain in the Close she must lose\nher mother and sister, and that without really making a friend of\nher aunt. There had as yet been no quarrel,--nothing that had been\nplainly recognised as disagreeable; but there had not as yet come to\nbe any sympathy, or assured signs of comfortable love. Miss Stanbury\nhad declared more than once that it would do, but had not succeeded\nin showing in what the success consisted. When she was told that the\ntwo ladies were gone, she desired that Dorothy might be sent to her,\nand immediately began to make anxious inquiries.\n\n\"Well, my dear, and what do they think of it?\"\n\n\"I don't know, aunt, that they think very much.\"\n\n\"And what do they say about it?\"\n\n\"They didn't say very much, aunt. I was very glad to see mamma and\nPriscilla. Perhaps I ought to tell you that mamma gave me back the\nmoney I sent her.\"\n\n\"What did she do that for?\" asked Miss Stanbury very sharply.\n\n\"Because she says that Hugh sends her now what she wants.\" Miss\nStanbury, when she heard this, looked very sour. \"I thought it best\nto tell you, you know.\"\n\n\"It will never come to any good, got in that way,--never.\"\n\n\"But, Aunt Stanbury, isn't it good of him to send it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I suppose it's better than drinking, and smoking, and\ngambling. But I dare say he gets enough for that too. When a man,\nborn and bred like a gentleman, condescends to let out his talents\nand education for such purposes, I dare say they are willing enough\nto pay him. The devil always does pay high wages. But that only makes\nit so much the worse. One almost comes to doubt whether any one ought\nto learn to write at all, when it is used for such vile purposes.\nI've said what I've got to say, and I don't mean to say anything\nmore. What's the use? But it has been hard upon me,--very. It was my\nmoney did it, and I feel I've misused it. It's a disgrace to me which\nI don't deserve.\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes Dorothy remained quite silent, and Miss\nStanbury did not herself say anything further. Nor during that time\ndid she observe her niece, or she would probably have seen that the\nsubject was not to be dropped. Dorothy, though she was silent, was\nnot calm, and was preparing herself for a crusade in her brother's\ndefence.\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury, he's my brother, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course he's your brother. I wish he were not.\"\n\n\"I think him the best brother in the world,--and the best son.\"\n\n\"Why does he sell himself to write sedition?\"\n\n\"He doesn't sell himself to write sedition. I don't see why it should\nbe sedition, or anything wicked, because it's sold for a penny.\"\n\n\"If you are going to cram him down my throat, Dorothy, you and I had\nbetter part.\"\n\n\"I don't want to say anything about him, only you ought--not--to\nabuse him--before me.\" By this time Dorothy was beginning to sob,\nbut Miss Stanbury's countenance was still very grim and very stern.\n\"He's coming home to Nuncombe Putney, and I want to--see--see him,\"\ncontinued Dorothy.\n\n\"Hugh Stanbury coming to Exeter! He won't come here.\"\n\n\"Then I'd rather go home, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" said Miss Stanbury, and she got up and left\nthe room.\n\nDorothy was in dismay, and began to think that there was nothing for\nher to do but to pack up her clothes and prepare for her departure.\nShe was very sorry for what had occurred, being fully alive to the\nimportance of the aid not only to herself, but to her mother and\nsister, which was afforded by the present arrangement, and she felt\nvery angry with herself, in that she had already driven her aunt to\nquarrel with her. But she had found it to be impossible to hear her\nown brother abused without saying a word on his behalf. She did not\nsee her aunt again till dinner-time, and then there was hardly a word\nuttered. Once or twice Dorothy made a little effort to speak, but\nthese attempts failed utterly. The old woman would hardly reply even\nby a monosyllable, but simply muttered something, or shook her head\nwhen she was addressed. Jane, who waited at table, was very demure\nand silent, and Martha, who once came into the room during the meal,\nmerely whispered a word into Miss Stanbury's ear. When the cloth\nwas removed, and two glasses of port had been poured out by Miss\nStanbury herself, Dorothy felt that she could endure this treatment\nno longer. How was it possible that she could drink wine under such\ncircumstances?\n\n\n   [Illustration: Aunt Stanbury at dinner will not speak.]\n\n\n\"Not for me, Aunt Stanbury,\" said she, with a deploring tone.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I couldn't drink it to-day.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so before it was poured out? And why not to-day?\nCome, drink it. Do as I bid you.\" And she stood over her niece, as a\ntragedy queen in a play with a bowl of poison. Dorothy took it and\nsipped it from mere force of obedience. \"You make as many bones about\na glass of port wine as though it were senna and salts,\" said Miss\nStanbury. \"Now I've got something to say to you.\" By this time the\nservant was gone, and the two were seated alone together in the\nparlour. Dorothy, who had not as yet swallowed above half her wine,\nat once put the glass down. There was an importance in her aunt's\ntone which frightened her, and made her feel that some evil was\ncoming. And yet, as she had made up her mind that she must return\nhome, there was no further evil that she need dread. \"You didn't\nwrite any of those horrid articles?\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"No, aunt; I didn't write them. I shouldn't know how.\"\n\n\"And I hope you'll never learn. They say women are to vote, and\nbecome doctors, and if so, there's no knowing what devil's tricks\nthey mayn't do. But it isn't your fault about that filthy newspaper.\nHow he can let himself down to write stuff that is to be printed on\nstraw is what I can't understand.\"\n\n\"I don't see how it can make a difference as he writes it.\"\n\n\"It would make a great deal of difference to me. And I'm told that\nwhat they call ink comes off on your fingers like lamp-black. I never\ntouched one, thank God; but they tell me so. All the same; it isn't\nyour fault.\"\n\n\"I've nothing to do with it, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Of course you've not. And as he is your brother it wouldn't be\nnatural that you should like to throw him off. And, my dear, I like\nyou for taking his part. Only you needn't have been so fierce with an\nold woman.\"\n\n\"Indeed--indeed I didn't mean to be--fierce, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"I never was taken up so short in my life. But we won't mind that.\nThere; he shall come and see you. I suppose he won't insist on\nleaving any of his nastiness about.\"\n\n\"But is he to come here, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"He may if he pleases.\"\n\n\"Oh, Aunt Stanbury!\"\n\n\"When he was here last he generally had a pipe in his mouth, and I\ndare say he never puts it down at all now. Those things grow upon\nyoung people so fast. But if he could leave it on the door-step just\nwhile he's here I should be obliged to him.\"\n\n\"But, dear aunt, couldn't I see him in the street?\"\n\n\"Out in the street! No, my dear. All the world is not to know that\nhe's your brother; and he is dressed in such a rapscallion manner\nthat the people would think you were talking to a house-breaker.\"\nDorothy's face became again red as she heard this, and the angry\nwords were very nearly spoken. \"The last time I saw him,\" continued\nMiss Stanbury, \"he had on a short, rough jacket, with enormous\nbuttons, and one of those flipperty-flopperty things on his head,\nthat the butcher-boys wear. And, oh, the smell of tobacco! As he had\nbeen up in London I suppose he thought Exeter was no better than a\nvillage, and he might do just as he pleased. But he knew that if\nI'm particular about anything, it is about a gentleman's hat in\nthe streets. And he wanted me--me!--to walk with him across to Mrs.\nMacHugh's! We should have been hooted about the Close like a pair of\nmad dogs;--and so I told him.\"\n\n\"All the young men seem to dress like that now, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"No, they don't. Mr. Gibson doesn't dress like that.\"\n\n\"But he's a clergyman, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'm an old fool. I dare say I am, and of course that's what\nyou mean. At any rate I'm too old to change, and I don't mean to try.\nI like to see a difference between a gentleman and a house-breaker.\nFor the matter of that I'm told that there is a difference, and that\nthe house-breakers all look like gentlemen now. It may be proper to\nmake us all stand on our heads, with our legs sticking up in the air;\nbut I for one don't like being topsy-turvey, and I won't try it. When\nis he to reach Exeter?\"\n\n\"He is coming on Tuesday next, by the last train.\"\n\n\"Then you can't see him that night. That's out of the question. No\ndoubt he'll sleep at the Nag's Head, as that's the lowest radical\npublic-house in the city. Martha shall try to find him. She knows\nmore about his doings than I do. If he chooses to come here the\nfollowing morning before he goes down to Nuncombe Putney, well and\ngood. I shall wait up till Martha comes back from the train on\nTuesday night, and hear.\" Dorothy was of course full of gratitude and\nthanks; but yet she felt almost disappointed by the result of her\naunt's clemency on the matter. She had desired to take her brother's\npart, and it had seemed to her as though she had done so in a very\nlukewarm manner. She had listened to an immense number of accusations\nagainst him, and had been unable to reply to them because she had\nbeen conquered by the promise of a visit. And now it was out of the\nquestion that she should speak of going. Her aunt had given way to\nher, and of course had conquered her.\n\nLate on the Tuesday evening, after ten o'clock, Hugh Stanbury was\nwalking round the Close with his aunt's old servant. He had not put\nup at that dreadfully radical establishment of which Miss Stanbury\nwas so much afraid, but had taken a bed-room at the Railway Inn. From\nthere he had walked up to the Close with Martha, and now was having a\nfew last words with her before he would allow her to return to the\nhouse.\n\n\"I suppose she'd as soon see the devil as see me,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"If you speak in that way, Mr. Hugh, I won't listen to you.\"\n\n\"And yet I did everything I could to please her; and I don't think\nany boy ever loved an old woman better than I did her.\"\n\n\"That was while she used to send you cakes, and ham, and jam to\nschool, Mr. Hugh.\"\n\n\"Of course it was, and while she sent me flannel waistcoats to\nOxford. But when I didn't care any longer for cakes or flannel then\nshe got tired of me. It is much better as it is, if she'll only be\ngood to Dorothy.\"\n\n\"She never was bad to anybody, Mr. Hugh. But I don't think an old\nlady like her ever takes to a young woman as she does to a young man,\nif only he'll let her have a little more of her own way than you\nwould. It's my belief that you might have had it all for your own\nsome day, if you'd done as you ought.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Martha. She means to leave it all to the Burgesses.\nI've heard her say so.\"\n\n\"Say so; yes. People don't always do what they say. If you'd managed\nrightly you might have it all;--and so you might now.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, old girl; I shan't try. Live for the next twenty\nyears under her apron strings, that I may have the chance at the end\nof it of cutting some poor devil out of his money! Do you know the\nmeaning of making a score off your own bat, Martha?\"\n\n\"No, I don't; and if it's anything you're like to do, I don't think I\nshould be the better for learning,--by all accounts. And now if you\nplease, I'll go in.\"\n\n\"Good night, Martha. My love to them both, and say I'll be there\nto-morrow exactly at half-past nine. You'd better take it. It won't\nturn to slate-stone. It hasn't come from the old gentleman.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything of that kind, Mr. Hugh;--indeed I don't.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. If you don't take it you'll offend me. I believe you think\nI'm not much better than a schoolboy still.\"\n\n\"I don't think you're half so good, Mr. Hugh,\" said the old servant,\nsticking the sovereign which Hugh had given her in under her glove as\nshe spoke.\n\nOn the next morning that other visit was made at the brick house, and\nMiss Stanbury was again in a fuss. On this occasion, however, she was\nin a much better humour than before, and was full of little jokes as\nto the nature of the visitation. Of course, she was not to see her\nnephew herself, and no message was to be delivered from her, and none\nwas to be given to her from him. But an accurate report was to be\nmade to her as to his appearance, and Dorothy was to be enabled to\nanswer a variety of questions respecting him after he was gone. \"Of\ncourse, I don't want to know anything about his money,\" Miss Stanbury\nsaid, \"only I should like to know how much these people can afford\nto pay for their penny trash.\" On this occasion she had left the\nroom and gone up-stairs before the knock came at the door, but she\nmanaged, by peeping over the balcony, to catch a glimpse of the\n\"flipperty-flopperty\" hat which her nephew certainly had with him on\nthis occasion.\n\nHugh Stanbury had great news for his sister. The cottage in which\nMrs. Stanbury lived at Nuncombe Putney, was the tiniest little\ndwelling in which a lady and her two daughters ever sheltered\nthemselves. There was, indeed, a sitting-room, two bed-rooms, and a\nkitchen; but they were all so diminutive in size that the cottage was\nlittle more than a cabin. But there was a house in the village, not\nlarge indeed, but eminently respectable, three stories high, covered\nwith ivy, having a garden behind it, and generally called the Clock\nHouse, because there had once been a clock upon it. This house\nhad been lately vacated, and Hugh informed his sister that he was\nthinking of taking it for his mother's accommodation. Now, the\nlate occupants of the Clock House, at Nuncombe Putney, had been\npeople with five or six hundred a year. Had other matters been in\naccordance, the house would almost have entitled them to consider\nthemselves as county people. A gardener had always been kept\nthere,--and a cow!\n\n\"The Clock House for mamma!\"\n\n\"Well, yes. Don't say a word about it as yet to Aunt Stanbury, as\nshe'll think that I've sold myself altogether to the old gentleman.\"\n\n\"But, Hugh, how can mamma live there?\"\n\n\"The fact is, Dorothy, there is a secret. I can't tell you quite\nyet. Of course, you'll know it, and everybody will know it, if the\nthing comes about. But as you won't talk, I will tell you what most\nconcerns ourselves.\"\n\n\"And am I to go back?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,--if you will take my advice. Stick to your aunt. You\ndon't want to smoke pipes, and wear Tom-and-Jerry hats, and write for\nthe penny newspapers.\"\n\nNow Hugh Stanbury's secret was this;--that Louis Trevelyan's wife and\nsister-in-law were to leave the house in Curzon Street, and come and\nlive at Nuncombe Putney, with Mrs. Stanbury and Priscilla. Such, at\nleast, was the plan to be carried out, if Hugh Stanbury should be\nsuccessful in his present negotiations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MR. GLASCOCK.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nBy the end of July Mrs. Trevelyan with her sister was established in\nthe Clock House, at Nuncombe Putney, under the protection of Hugh's\nmother; but before the reader is made acquainted with any of the\ncircumstances of their life there, a few words must be said of an\noccurrence which took place before those two ladies left Curzon\nStreet.\n\nAs to the quarrel between Trevelyan and his wife things went from bad\nto worse. Lady Milborough continued to interfere, writing letters\nto Emily which were full of good sense, but which, as Emily said\nherself, never really touched the point of dispute. \"Am I, who am\naltogether unconscious of having done anything amiss, to confess that\nI have been in the wrong? If it were about a small matter, I would\nnot mind, for the sake of peace. But when it concerns my conduct in\nreference to another man I would rather die first.\" That had been\nMrs. Trevelyan's line of thought and argument in the matter; but\nthen old Lady Milborough in her letters spoke only of the duty of\nobedience as promised at the altar. \"But I didn't promise to tell a\nlie,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. And there were interviews between Lady\nMilborough and Trevelyan, and interviews between Lady Milborough and\nNora Rowley. The poor dear old dowager was exceedingly busy and full\nof groans, prescribing Naples, prescribing a course of extra prayers,\nprescribing a general course of letting by-gones be by-gones,--to\nwhich, however, Trevelyan would by no means assent without some\nassurance, which he might regard as a guarantee,--prescribing\nretirement to a small town in the west of France if Naples would not\nsuffice; but she could effect nothing.\n\nMrs. Trevelyan, indeed, did a thing which was sure of itself to\nrender any steps taken for a reconciliation ineffectual. In the midst\nof all this turmoil,--while she and her husband were still living in\nthe same house, but apart because of their absurd quarrel respecting\nColonel Osborne, she wrote another letter to that gentleman. The\nargument by which she justified this to herself, and to her sister\nafter it was done, was the real propriety of her own conduct\nthroughout her whole intimacy with Colonel Osborne. \"But that is\njust what Louis doesn't want you to do,\" Nora had said, filled with\nanger and dismay. \"Then let Louis give me an order to that effect,\nand behave to me like a husband, and I will obey him,\" Emily had\nanswered. And she had gone on to plead that in her present condition\nshe was under no orders from her husband. She was left to judge for\nherself, and,--judging for herself,--she knew, as she said, that it\nwas best that she should write to Colonel Osborne. Unfortunately\nthere was no ground for hoping that Colonel Osborne was ignorant\nof this insane jealousy on the part of her husband. It was better,\ntherefore, she said, that she should write to him,--whom on the\noccasion she took care to name to her sister as \"papa's old\nfriend,\"--and explain to him what she would wish him to do, and what\nnot to do. Colonel Osborne answered the letter very quickly, throwing\nmuch more of demonstrative affection than he should have done into\nhis \"Dear Emily,\" and his \"Dearest Friend.\" Of course Mrs. Trevelyan\nhad burned this answer, and of course Mr. Trevelyan had been told of\nthe correspondence. His wife, indeed, had been especially careful\nthat there should be nothing secret about the matter,--that it should\nbe so known in the house that Mr. Trevelyan should be sure to hear\nof it. And he had heard of it, and been driven almost mad by it. He\nhad flown off to Lady Milborough, and had reduced his old friend to\ndespair by declaring that, after all, he began to fear that his wife\nwas--was--was--infatuated by that d---- scoundrel. Lady Milborough\nforgave the language, but protested that he was wrong in his\nsuspicion. \"To continue to correspond with him after what I have said\nto her!\" exclaimed Trevelyan. \"Take her to Naples at once,\"--said\nLady Milborough;--\"at once!\" \"And have him after me?\" said Trevelyan.\nLady Milborough had no answer ready, and not having thought of\nthis looked very blank. \"I should find it harder to deal with her\nthere even than here,\" continued Trevelyan. Then it was that Lady\nMilborough spoke of the small town in the west of France, urging\nas her reason that such a man as Colonel Osborne would certainly\nnot follow them there; but Trevelyan had become indignant at this,\ndeclaring that if his wife's good name could be preserved in no other\nmanner than that, it would not be worth preserving at all. Then Lady\nMilborough had begun to cry, and had continued crying for a very long\ntime. She was very unhappy,--as unhappy as her nature would allow\nher to be. She would have made almost any sacrifice to bring the two\nyoung people together;--would have willingly given her time, her\nmoney, her labour in the cause;--would probably herself have gone\nto the little town in the west of France, had her going been of any\nservice. But, nevertheless, after her own fashion, she extracted no\nsmall enjoyment out of the circumstances of this miserable quarrel.\nThe Lady Milboroughs of the day hate the Colonel Osbornes from the\nvery bottoms of their warm hearts and pure souls; but they respect\nthe Colonel Osbornes almost as much as they hate them, and find it\nto be an inestimable privilege to be brought into some contact with\nthese roaring lions.\n\nBut there arose to dear Lady Milborough a great trouble out of this\nquarrel, irrespective of the absolute horror of the separation of a\nyoung husband from his young wife. And the excess of her trouble on\nthis head was great proof of the real goodness of her heart. For, in\nthis matter, the welfare of Trevelyan himself was not concerned;--but\nrather that of the Rowley family. Now the Rowleys had not given Lady\nMilborough any special reason for loving them. When she had first\nheard that her dear young friend Louis was going to marry a girl from\nthe Mandarins, she had been almost in despair. It was her opinion\nthat had he properly understood his own position, he would have\npromoted his welfare by falling in love with the daughter of some\nEnglish country gentleman,--or some English peer, to which honour,\nwith his advantages, Lady Milborough thought that he might have\naspired. Nevertheless, when the girl from the Mandarins had been\nbrought home as Mrs. Trevelyan, Lady Milborough had received her with\nopen arms,--had received even the sister-in-law with arms partly\nopen. Had either of them shown any tendency to regard her as a\nmother, she would have showered motherly cares upon them. For Lady\nMilborough was like an old hen, in her capacity for taking many\nunder her wings. The two sisters had hardly done more than bear\nwith her,--Nora, indeed, bearing with her more graciously than Mrs.\nTrevelyan; and in return, even for this, the old dowager was full of\nmotherly regard. Now she knew well that Mr. Glascock was over head\nand ears in love with Nora Rowley. It only wanted the slightest\nmanagement and the easiest discretion to bring him on his knees, with\nan offer of his hand. And, then, how much that hand contained!--how\nmuch, indeed, as compared with that other hand, which was to be given\nin return, and which was,--to speak the truth,--completely empty! Mr.\nGlascock was the heir to a peer, was the heir to a rich peer, was the\nheir to a very, very old peer. He was in Parliament. The world spoke\nwell of him. He was not, so to say, by any means an old man himself.\nHe was good-tempered, reasonable, easily led, and yet by no means\ndespicable. On all subjects connected with land, he held an opinion\nthat was very much respected, and was supposed to be a thoroughly\ngood specimen of an upper-class Englishman. Here was a suitor! But it\nwas not to be supposed that such a man as Mr. Glascock would be so\nviolently in love as to propose to a girl whose nearest known friend\nand female relation was misbehaving herself.\n\nOnly they who have closely watched the natural uneasiness of human\nhens can understand how great was Lady Milborough's anxiety on\nthis occasion. Marriage to her was a thing always delightful to\ncontemplate. Though she had never been sordidly a match-maker, the\ncourse of the world around her had taught her to regard men as fish\nto be caught, and girls as the anglers who ought to catch them. Or,\nrather, could her mind have been accurately analysed, it would have\nbeen found that the girl was regarded as half-angler and half-bait.\nAny girl that angled visibly with her own hook, with a manifestly\nexpressed desire to catch a fish, was odious to her. And she was very\ngentle-hearted in regard to the fishes, thinking that every fish\nin the river should have the hook and bait presented to him in the\nmildest, pleasantest form. But still, when the trout was well in\nthe basket, her joy was great; and then came across her unlaborious\nmind some half-formed idea that a great ordinance of nature was\nbeing accomplished in the teeth of difficulties. For,--as she well\nknew,--there is a difficulty in the catching of fish.\n\nLady Milborough, in her kind anxiety on Nora's behalf,--that the fish\nshould be landed before Nora might be swept away in her sister's\nruin,--hardly knew what step she might safely take. Mrs. Trevelyan\nwould not see her again,--having already declared that any further\ninterview would be painful and useless. She had spoken to Trevelyan,\nbut Trevelyan had declared that he could do nothing. What was there\nthat he could have done? He could not, as he said, overlook the gross\nimproprieties of his wife's conduct, because his wife's sister had,\nor might possibly have, a lover. And then as to speaking to Mr.\nGlascock himself,--nobody knew better than Lady Milborough how very\napt fish are to be frightened.\n\nBut at last Lady Milborough did speak to Mr. Glascock,--making no\nallusion whatever to the hook prepared for himself, but saying a word\nor two as to the affairs of that other fish, whose circumstances, as\nhe floundered about in the bucket of matrimony, were not as happy as\nthey might have been. The care, the discretion, nay, the wisdom with\nwhich she did this were most excellent. She had become aware that\nMr. Glascock had already heard of the unfortunate affair in Curzon\nStreet. Indeed, every one who knew the Trevelyans had heard of it,\nand a great many who did not know them. No harm, therefore, could\nbe done by mentioning the circumstance. Lady Milborough did mention\nit, explaining that the only person really in fault was that odious\ndestroyer of the peace of families, Colonel Osborne, of whom\nLady Milborough, on that occasion, said some very severe things\nindeed. Poor dear Mrs. Trevelyan was foolish, obstinate, and\nself-reliant;--but as innocent as the babe unborn. That things would\ncome right before long no one who knew the affair,--and she knew it\nfrom beginning to end,--could for a moment doubt. The real victim\nwould be that sweetest of all girls, Nora Rowley. Mr. Glascock\ninnocently asked why Nora Rowley should be a victim. \"Don't you\nunderstand, Mr. Glascock, how the most remote connection with a\nthing of that kind tarnishes a young woman's standing in the world?\"\nMr. Glascock was almost angry with the well-pleased Countess as he\ndeclared that he could not see that Miss Rowley's standing was at all\ntarnished; and old Lady Milborough, when he got up and left her, felt\nthat she had done a good morning's work. If Nora could have known it\nall, Nora ought to have been very grateful, for Mr. Glascock got into\na cab in Eccleston Square and had himself driven direct to Curzon\nStreet. He himself believed that he was at that moment only doing the\nthing which he had for some time past resolved that he would do; but\nwe perhaps may be justified in thinking that the actual resolution\nwas first fixed by the discretion of Lady Milborough's communication.\nAt any rate he arrived in Curzon Street with his mind fully resolved,\nand had spent the minutes in the cab considering how he had better\nperform the business in hand.\n\nHe was at once shown into the drawing-room, where he found the two\nsisters, and Mrs. Trevelyan, as soon as she saw him, understood the\npurpose of his coming. There was an air of determination about him, a\nmanifest intention of doing something, an absence of that vagueness\nwhich almost always flavours a morning visit. This was so strongly\nmarked that Mrs. Trevelyan felt that she would have been almost\njustified in getting up and declaring that, as this visit was paid\nto her sister, she would retire. But any such declaration on her\npart was unnecessary, as Mr. Glascock had not been in the room three\nminutes before he asked her to go. By some clever device of his own,\nhe got her into the back room and whispered to her that he wanted to\nsay a few words in private to her sister.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, smiling.\n\n\"I dare say you may guess what they are,\" said he. \"I don't know what\nchance I may have.\"\n\n\"I can tell you nothing about that,\" she replied, \"as I know nothing.\nBut you have my good wishes.\"\n\nAnd then she went.\n\nIt may be presumed that gradually some idea of Mr. Glascock's\nintention had made its way into Nora's mind by the time that she\nfound herself alone with that gentleman. Why else had he brought into\nthe room with him that manifest air of a purpose? Why else had he\ntaken the very strong step of sending the lady of the house out of\nher own drawing-room? Nora, beginning to understand this, put herself\ninto an attitude of defence. She had never told herself that she\nwould refuse Mr. Glascock. She had never acknowledged to herself\nthat there was another man whom she liked better than she liked Mr.\nGlascock. But had she ever encouraged any wish for such an interview,\nher feelings at this moment would have been very different from what\nthey were. As it was, she would have given much to postpone it, so\nthat she might have asked herself questions, and have discovered\nwhether she could reconcile herself to do that which, no doubt, all\nher friends would commend her for doing. Of course, it was clear\nenough to the mind of the girl that she had her fortune to make, and\nthat her beauty and youth were the capital on which she had to found\nit. She had not lived so far from all taint of corruption as to feel\nany actual horror at the idea of a girl giving herself to a man,--not\nbecause the man had already, by his own capacities in that direction,\nforced her heart from her,--but because he was one likely to be at\nall points a good husband. Had all this affair concerned any other\ngirl, any friend of her own, and had she known all the circumstances\nof the case, she would have had no hesitation in recommending that\nother girl to marry Mr. Glascock. A girl thrown out upon the world\nwithout a shilling must make her hay while the sun shines. But,\nnevertheless, there was something within her bosom which made her\nlong for a better thing than this. She had dreamed, if she had not\nthought, of being able to worship a man; but she could hardly worship\nMr. Glascock. She had dreamed, if she had not thought, of leaning\nupon a man all through life with her whole weight, as though that\nman had been specially made to be her staff, her prop, her support,\nher wall of comfort and protection. She knew that if she were to\nmarry Mr. Glascock and become Lady Peterborough, in due course she\nmust stand a good deal by her own strength, and live without that\ncomfortable leaning. Nevertheless, when she found herself alone with\nthe man, she by no means knew whether she would refuse him or not.\nBut she knew that she must pluck up courage for an important moment,\nand she collected herself, braced her muscles, as it were, for a\nfight, and threw her mind into an attitude of contest.\n\nMr. Glascock, as soon as the door was shut behind Mrs. Trevelyan's\nback, took a chair and placed it close beside the head of the sofa on\nwhich Nora was sitting. \"Miss Rowley,\" he said, \"you and I have known\neach other now for some months, and I hope you have learned to regard\nme as a friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed,\" said Nora, with some spirit.\n\n\"It has seemed to me that we have met as friends, and I can most\ntruly say for myself, that I have taken the greatest possible\npleasure in your acquaintance. It is not only that I admire you very\nmuch,\"--he looked straight before him as he said this, and moved\nabout the point of the stick which he was holding in both his\nhands,--\"it is not only that,--perhaps not chiefly that, though I do\nadmire you very much; but the truth is, that I like everything about\nyou.\"\n\nNora smiled, but she said nothing. It was better, she thought, to let\nhim tell his story; but his mode of telling it was not without its\nefficacy. It was not the simple praise which made its way with her\nbut a certain tone in the words which seemed to convince her that\nthey were true. If he had really found her, or fancied her to be what\nhe said, there was a manliness in his telling her so in the plainest\nwords that pleased her much.\n\n\"I know,\" continued he, \"that this is a very bald way of telling--of\npleading--my cause; but I don't know whether a bald way may not\nbe the best, if it can only make itself understood to be true. Of\ncourse, Miss Rowley, you know what I mean. As I said before, you have\nall those things which not only make me love you, but which make me\nlike you also. If you think that you can love me, say so; and, as\nlong as I live, I will do my best to make you happy as my wife.\"\n\nThere was a clearness of expression in this, and a downright\nsurrender of himself, which so flattered her and so fluttered her\nthat she was almost reduced to the giving of herself up because she\ncould not reply to such an appeal in language less courteous than\nthat of agreement. After a moment or two she found herself remaining\nsilent, with a growing feeling that silence would be taken as\nconveying consent. There floated quickly across her brain an idea of\nthe hardness of a woman's lot, in that she should be called upon to\ndecide her future fate for life in half a minute. He had had weeks to\nthink of this,--weeks in which it would have been almost unmaidenly\nin her so to think of it as to have made up her mind to accept the\nman. Had she so made up her mind, and had he not come to her, where\nwould she have been then? But he had come to her. There he was, still\npoking about with his stick, waiting for her, and she must answer\nhim. And he was the eldest son of a peer,--an enormous match for her,\nvery proper in all respects; such a man, that if she should accept\nhim, everybody around her would regard her fortune in life as\nmiraculously successful. He was not such a man that any one would\npoint at her and say,--\"There; see another of them who has sold\nherself for money and a title!\" Mr. Glascock was not an Apollo, not\nan admirable Crichton; but he was a man whom any girl might have\nlearned to love. Now he had asked her to be his wife, and it was\nnecessary that she should answer him. He sat there waiting for her\nvery patiently, still poking about the point of his stick.\n\nDid she really love him? Though she was so pressed by consideration\nof time, she did find a moment in which to ask herself the question.\nWith a quick turn of an eye she glanced at him, to see what he was\nlike. Up to this moment, though she knew him well, she could have\ngiven no details of his personal appearance. He was a better-looking\nman than Hugh Stanbury,--so she told herself with a passing thought;\nbut he lacked--he lacked; what was it that he lacked? Was it youth,\nor spirit, or strength; or was it some outward sign of an inward gift\nof mind? Was it that he was heavy while Hugh was light? Was it that\nshe could find no fire in his eye, while Hugh's eyes were full of\nflashing? Or was it that for her, especially for her, Hugh was the\nappointed staff and appropriate wall of protection? Be all that as it\nmight, she knew at the moment that she did love, not this man, but\nthat other who was writing articles for the Daily Record. She must\nrefuse the offer that was so brilliant, and give up the idea of\nreigning as queen at Monkhams.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Glascock,\" she said, \"I ought to answer you more quickly.\"\n\n\"No, dearest; not more quickly than suits you. Nothing ever in this\nworld can be more important both to you and to me. If you want more\ntime to think of it, take more time.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Glascock; I do not. I don't know why I should have paused.\nIs not the truth best?\"\n\n\"Yes,--certainly the truth is best.\"\n\n\"I do not--love you. Pray, pray understand me.\"\n\n\"I understand it too well, Miss Rowley.\" The stick was still going,\nand the eyes more intently fixed than ever on something opposite.\n\n\"I do like you; I like you very much. And I am so grateful! I cannot\nunderstand why such a man as you should want to make me your wife.\"\n\n\"Because I love you better than all the others; simply that. That\nreason, and that only, justifies a man in wanting to marry a girl.\"\nWhat a good fellow he was, and how flattering were his words! Did he\nnot deserve what he wanted, even though it could not be given without\na sacrifice? But yet she did not love him. As she looked at him again\nshe could not there recognise her staff. As she looked at him she was\nmore than ever convinced that that other staff ought to be her staff.\n\"May I come again,--after a month, say?\" he asked, when there had\nbeen another short period of silence.\n\n\"No, no. Why should you trouble yourself? I am not worth it.\"\n\n\"It is for me to judge of that, Miss Rowley.\"\n\n\"All the same, I know that I am not worth it. And I could not tell\nyou to do that.\"\n\n\"Then I will wait, and come again without your telling me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Glascock, I did not mean that; indeed I did not. Pray do not\nthink that. Take what I say as final. I like you more than I can say;\nand I feel a gratitude to you that I cannot express,--which I shall\nnever forget. I have never known any one who has seemed to be so good\nas you. But-- It is just what I said before.\" And then she fairly\nburst into tears.\n\n\"Miss Rowley,\" he said, very slowly, \"pray do not think that I want\nto ask any question which it might embarrass you to answer. But my\nhappiness is so greatly at stake; and, if you will allow me to say\nso, your happiness, too, is so greatly concerned, that it is most\nimportant that we should not come to a conclusion too quickly. If I\nthought that your heart were vacant I would wait patiently. I have\nbeen thinking of you as my possible wife for weeks past,--for months\npast. Of course you have not had such thoughts about me.\" As he said\nthis she almost loved him for his considerate goodness. \"It has\nsometimes seemed to me odd that girls should love men in such a\nhurry. If your heart be free, I will wait. And if you esteem me, you\ncan see, and try whether you cannot learn to love me.\"\n\n\"I do esteem you.\"\n\n\"It depends on that question, then?\" he said, slowly.\n\nShe sat silent for fully a minute, with her hands clasped; and then\nshe answered him in a whisper. \"I do not know,\" she said.\n\nHe also was silent for a while before he spoke again. He ceased to\npoke with his stick, and got up from his chair, and stood a little\napart from her, not looking at her even yet.\n\n\"I see,\" he said at last. \"I understand. Well, Miss Rowley, I quite\nperceive that I cannot press my suit any further now. But I shall not\ndespair altogether. I know this, that if I might possibly succeed, I\nshould be a very happy man. Good-bye, Miss Rowley.\"\n\nShe took his offered hand and pressed it so warmly, that had he not\nbeen manly and big-hearted, he would have taken such pressure as a\nsign that she wished him to ask her again. But such was his nature.\n\n\"God bless you,\" he said, \"and make you happy, whatever you may\nchoose to do.\"\n\nThen he left her, and she heard him walk down the stairs with heavy\nslow steps, and she thought that she could perceive from the sound\nthat he was sad at heart, but that he was resolved not to show his\nsadness outwardly.\n\nWhen she was alone she began to think in earnest of what she had\ndone. If the reader were told that she regretted the decision which\nshe had been forced to make so rapidly, a wrong impression would\nbe given of the condition of her thoughts. But there came upon her\nsuddenly a strange capacity for counting up and making a mental\ninventory of all that might have been hers. She knew,--and where is\nthe girl so placed that does not know?--that it is a great thing to\nbe an English peeress. Now, as she stood there thinking of it all,\nshe was Nora Rowley without a shilling in the world, and without a\nprospect of a shilling. She had often heard her mother speak fearful\nwords of future possible days, when colonial governing should no\nlonger be within the capacity of Sir Marmaduke. She had been taught\nfrom a very early age that all the material prosperity of her life\nmust depend on matrimony. She could never be comfortably disposed of\nin the world, unless some fitting man who possessed those things of\nwhich she was so bare, should wish to make her his wife. Now there\nhad come a man so thoroughly fitting, so marvellously endowed, that\nno worldly blessing would have been wanting. Mr. Glascock had more\nthan once spoken to her of the glories of Monkhams. She thought of\nMonkhams now more than she had ever thought of the place before.\nIt would have been a great privilege to be the mistress of an old\ntime-honoured mansion, to call oaks and elms her own, to know that\nacres of gardens were submitted to her caprices, to look at herds\nof cows and oxen, and be aware that they lowed on her own pastures.\nAnd to have been the mother of a future peer of England, to\nhave the nursing, and sweet custody and very making of a future\nsenator,--would not that have been much? And the man himself who\nwould have been her husband was such a one that any woman might have\ntrusted herself to him with perfect confidence. Now that he was\ngone she almost fancied that she did love him. Then she thought of\nHugh Stanbury, sitting as he had described himself, in a little\ndark closet at the office of the \"D. R.,\" in a very old inky\nshooting-coat, with a tarnished square-cut cloth cap upon his head,\nwith a short pipe in his mouth, writing at midnight for the next\nmorning's impression, this or that article according to the order\nof his master, \"the tallow-chandler;\"--for the editor of the Daily\nRecord was a gentleman whose father happened to be a grocer in the\nCity, and Hugh had been accustomed thus to describe the family\ntrade. And she might certainly have had the peer, and the acres of\ngarden, and the big house, and the senatorial honours; whereas the\ntallow-chandler's journeyman had never been so out-spoken. She told\nherself from moment to moment that she had done right; that she would\ndo the same a dozen times, if a dozen times the experiment could\nbe repeated; but still, still, there was the remembrance of all\nthat she had lost. How would her mother look at her, her anxious,\nheavily-laden mother, when the story should be told of all that had\nbeen offered to her and all that had been refused?\n\n\n   [Illustration: To have been the mother of a future peer!]\n\n\nAs she was thinking of this Mrs. Trevelyan came into the room. Nora\nfelt that though she might dread to meet her mother, she could be\nbold enough on such an occasion before her sister. Emily had not\ndone so well with her own affairs, as to enable her to preach with\nadvantage about marriage.\n\n\"He has gone?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, as she opened the door.\n\n\"Yes, he has gone.\"\n\n\"Well? Do not pretend, Nora, that you will not tell me.\"\n\n\"There is nothing worth the telling, Emily.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I am sure he has proposed. He told me in so many\nwords that it was his intention.\"\n\n\"Whatever has happened, dear, you may be quite sure that I shall\nnever be Mrs. Glascock.\"\n\n\"Then you have refused him,--because of Hugh Stanbury!\"\n\n\"I have refused him, Emily, because I did not love him. Pray let that\nbe enough.\"\n\nThen she walked out of the room with something of stateliness in her\ngait,--as might become a girl who had had it in her power to be the\nfuture Lady Peterborough; but as soon as she reached the sacredness\nof her own chamber, she gave way to an agony of tears. It would,\nindeed, be much to be a Lady Peterborough. And she had, in truth,\nrefused it all because of Hugh Stanbury! Was Hugh Stanbury worth so\ngreat a sacrifice?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE CLOCK HOUSE AT NUNCOMBE PUTNEY.\n\n\nIt was not till a fortnight had passed after the transaction recorded\nin the last chapter, that Mrs. Trevelyan and Nora Rowley first heard\nthe proposition that they should go to live at Nuncombe Putney. From\nbad to worse the quarrel between the husband and the wife had gone\non, till Trevelyan had at last told his friend Lady Milborough\nthat he had made up his mind that they must live apart. \"She is so\nself-willed,--and perhaps I am the same,\" he had said, \"that it\nis impossible that we should live together.\" Lady Milborough had\nimplored and called to witness all testimonies, profane and sacred,\nagainst such a step,--had almost gone down on her knees. Go to\nNaples,--why not Naples? Or to the quiet town in the west of France,\nwhich was so dull that a wicked roaring lion, fond of cities and\ngambling, and eating and drinking, could not live in such a place!\nOh, why not go to the quiet town in the west of France? Was not\nanything better than this flying in the face of God and man? Perhaps\nTrevelyan did not himself like the idea of the quiet dull French\ntown. Perhaps he thought that the flying in the face of God and man\nwas all done by his wife, not by him; and that it was right that his\nwife should feel the consequences. After many such entreaties, many\nsuch arguments, it was at last decided that the house in Curzon\nStreet should be given up, and that he and his wife live apart.\n\n\"And what about Nora Rowley?\" asked Lady Milborough, who had become\naware by this time of Nora's insane folly in having refused Mr.\nGlascock.\n\n\"She will go with her sister, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And who will maintain her? Dear, dear, dear! It does seem as though\nsome young people were bent upon cutting their own throats, and all\ntheir family's.\"\n\nPoor Lady Milborough just at this time went as near to disliking the\nRowleys as was compatible with her nature. It was not possible to her\nto hate anybody. She thought that she hated the Colonel Osbornes; but\neven that was a mistake. She was very angry, however, with both Mrs.\nTrevelyan and her sister, and was disposed to speak of them as though\nthey had been born to create trouble and vexation.\n\nTrevelyan had not given any direct answer to that question about Nora\nRowley's maintenance, but he was quite prepared to bear all necessary\nexpense in that direction, at any rate till Sir Marmaduke should have\narrived. At first there had been an idea that the two sisters should\ngo to the house of their aunt, Mrs. Outhouse. Mrs. Outhouse was the\nwife,--as the reader may perhaps remember,--of a clergyman living\nin the east of London. St. Diddulph's-in-the-East was very much in\nthe east indeed. It was a parish outside the City, lying near the\nriver, very populous, very poor, very low in character, and very\nuncomfortable. There was a rectory-house, queerly situated at the\nend of a little blind lane, with a gate of its own, and a so-called\ngarden about twenty yards square. But the rectory of St. Diddulph's\ncannot be said to have been a comfortable abode. The neighbourhood\nwas certainly not alluring. Of visiting society within a distance\nof three or four miles there was none but what was afforded by the\nfamilies of other East-end clergymen. And then Mr. Outhouse himself\nwas a somewhat singular man. He was very religious, devoted to\nhis work, most kind to the poor; but he was unfortunately a\nstrongly-biased man, and at the same time very obstinate withal. He\nhad never allied himself very cordially with his wife's brother,\nSir Marmaduke, allowing himself to be carried away by a prejudice\nthat people living at the West-end, who frequented clubs, and\nwere connected in any way with fashion, could not be appropriate\ncompanions for himself. The very title which Sir Marmaduke had\nacquired was repulsive to him, and had induced him to tell his\nwife more than once that Sir this or Sir that could not be fitting\nassociates for a poor East-end clergyman. Then his wife's niece had\nmarried a man of fashion,--a man supposed at St. Diddulph's to be\nvery closely allied to fashion; and Mr. Outhouse had never been\ninduced even to dine in the house in Curzon Street. When, therefore,\nhe heard that Mr. and Mrs. Trevelyan were to be separated within two\nyears of their marriage, it could not be expected that he should be\nvery eager to lend to the two sisters the use of his rectory.\n\nThere had been interviews between Mr. Outhouse and Trevelyan, and\nbetween Mrs. Outhouse and her niece; and then there was an interview\nbetween Mr. Outhouse and Emily, in which it was decided that Mrs.\nTrevelyan would not go to the parsonage of St. Diddulph's. She had\nbeen very outspoken to her uncle, declaring that she by no means\nintended to carry herself as a disgraced woman. Mr. Outhouse had\nquoted St. Paul to her; \"Wives, obey your husbands.\" Then she had\ngot up and had spoken very angrily. \"I look for support from you,\"\nshe said, \"as the man who is the nearest to me, till my father\nshall come.\" \"But I cannot support you in what is wrong,\" said the\nclergyman. Then Mrs. Trevelyan had left the room, and would not see\nher uncle again.\n\nShe carried things altogether with a high hand at this time. When old\nMr. Bideawhile called upon her, her husband's ancient family lawyer,\nshe told that gentleman that if it was her husband's will that they\nshould live apart, it must be so. She could not force him to remain\nwith her. She could not compel him to keep up the house in Curzon\nStreet. She had certain rights, she believed. She spoke then, she\nsaid, of pecuniary rights,--not of those other rights which her\nhusband was determined, and was no doubt able, to ignore. She did not\nreally know what those pecuniary rights might be, nor was she careful\nto learn their exact extent. She would thank Mr. Bideawhile to see\nthat things were properly arranged. But of this her husband, and Mr.\nBideawhile, might be quite sure;--she would take nothing as a favour.\nShe would not go to her uncle's house. She declined to tell Mr.\nBideawhile why she had so decided; but she had decided. She was ready\nto listen to any suggestion that her husband might make as to her\nresidence, but she must claim to have some choice in the matter. As\nto her sister, of course she intended to give Nora a home as long as\nsuch a home might be wanted. It would be very sad for Nora, but in\nexisting circumstances such an arrangement would be expedient. She\nwould not go into details as to expense. Her husband was driving\nher away from him, and it was for him to say what proportion of his\nincome he would choose to give for her maintenance,--for hers and\nfor that of their child. She was not desirous of anything beyond the\nmeans of decent living, but of course she must for the present find\na home for her sister as well as for herself. When speaking of her\nbaby she had striven hard so to speak that Mr. Bideawhile should find\nno trace of doubt in the tones of her voice. And yet she had been\nfull of doubt,--full of fear. As Mr. Bideawhile had uttered nothing\nantagonistic to her wishes in this matter,--had seemed to agree\nthat wherever the mother went thither the child would go also,--Mrs.\nTrevelyan had considered herself to be successful in this interview.\n\nThe idea of a residence at Nuncombe Putney had occurred first to\nTrevelyan himself, and he had spoken of it to Hugh Stanbury. There\nhad been some difficulty in this, because he had snubbed Stanbury\ngrievously when his friend had attempted to do some work of gentle\ninterference between him and his wife; and when he began the\nconversation, he took the trouble of stating, in the first instance,\nthat the separation was a thing fixed,--so that nothing might be\nurged on that subject. \"It is to be. You will understand that,\"\nhe said; \"and if you think that your mother would agree to the\narrangement, it would be satisfactory to me, and might, I think,\nbe made pleasant to her. Of course, your mother would be made to\nunderstand that the only fault with which my wife is charged is that\nof indomitable disobedience to my wishes.\"\n\n\"Incompatibility of temper,\" suggested Stanbury.\n\n\"You may call it that if you please;--though I must say for myself\nthat I do not think that I have displayed any temper to which a\nwoman has a right to object.\" Then he had gone on to explain what\nhe was prepared to do about money. He would pay, through Stanbury's\nhands, so much for maintenance and so much for house rent, on the\nunderstanding that the money was not to go into his wife's hands.\n\"I shall prefer,\" he said, \"to make myself, on her behalf, what\ndisbursements may be necessary. I will take care that she receives a\nproper sum quarterly through Mr. Bideawhile for her own clothes,--and\nfor those of our poor boy.\" Then Stanbury had told him of the Clock\nHouse, and there had been an agreement made between them;--an\nagreement which was then, of course, subject to the approval of\nthe ladies at Nuncombe Putney. When the suggestion was made to Mrs.\nTrevelyan,--with a proposition that the Clock House should be taken\nfor one year, and that for that year, at least, her boy should remain\nwith her,--she assented to it. She did so with all the calmness that\nshe was able to assume; but, in truth, almost everything seemed to\nhave been gained, when she found that she was not to be separated\nfrom her baby. \"I have no objection to living in Devonshire if Mr.\nTrevelyan wishes it,\" she said, in her most stately manner; \"and\ncertainly no objection to living with Mr. Stanbury's mother.\" Then\nMr. Bideawhile explained to her that Nuncombe Putney was not a large\ntown,--was, in fact, a very small and a very remote village. \"That\nwill make no difference whatsoever as far as I am concerned,\" she\nanswered; \"and as for my sister, she must put up with it till my\nfather and my mother are here. I believe the scenery at Nuncombe\nPutney is very pretty.\" \"Lovely!\" said Mr. Bideawhile, who had a\ngeneral idea that Devonshire is supposed to be a picturesque\ncounty. \"With such a life before me as I must lead,\" continued Mrs.\nTrevelyan, \"an ugly neighbourhood, one that would itself have had\nno interest for a stranger, would certainly have been an additional\nsorrow.\" So it had been settled, and by the end of July, Mrs.\nTrevelyan, with her sister and baby, was established at the Clock\nHouse, under the protection of Mrs. Stanbury. Mrs. Trevelyan had\nbrought down her own maid and her own nurse, and had found that the\narrangements made by her husband had, in truth, been liberal. The\nhouse in Curzon Street had been given up, the furniture had been sent\nto a warehouse, and Mr. Trevelyan had gone into lodgings. \"There\nnever were two young people so insane since the world began,\" said\nLady Milborough to her old friend, Mrs. Fairfax, when the thing was\ndone.\n\n\"They will be together again before next April,\" Mrs. Fairfax had\nreplied. But Mrs. Fairfax was a jolly dame who made the best of\neverything. Lady Milborough raised her hands in despair, and shook\nher head. \"I don't suppose, though, that Mr. Glascock will go to\nDevonshire after his lady love,\" said Mrs. Fairfax. Lady Milborough\nagain raised her hands, and again shook her head.\n\nMrs. Stanbury had given an easy assent when her son proposed to her\nthis new mode of life, but Priscilla had had her doubts. Like all\nwomen, she thought that when a man was to be separated from his wife,\nthe woman must be in the wrong. And though it must be doubtless\ncomfortable to go from the cottage to the Clock House, it\nwould, she said, with much prudence, be very uncomfortable\nto go back from the Clock House to the cottage. Hugh replied\nvery cavalierly,--generously, that is, rashly, and somewhat\nimpetuously,--that he would guarantee them against any such\ndegradation.\n\n\"We don't want to be a burden upon you, my dear,\" said the mother.\n\n\"You would be a great burden on me,\" he replied, \"if you were living\nuncomfortably while I am able to make you comfortable.\"\n\nMrs. Stanbury was soon won over by Mrs. Trevelyan, by Nora, and\nespecially by the baby; and even Priscilla, after a week or two,\nbegan to feel that she liked their company. Priscilla was a young\nwoman who read a great deal, and even had some gifts of understanding\nwhat she read. She borrowed books from the clergyman, and paid a\npenny a week to the landlady of the Stag and Antlers for the hire\nduring half a day of the weekly newspaper. But now there came a box\nof books from Exeter, and a daily paper from London, and,--to improve\nall this,--both the new comers were able to talk with her about the\nthings she read. She soon declared to her mother that she liked\nMiss Rowley much the best of the two. Mrs. Trevelyan was too fond\nof having her own way. She began to understand, she would say to\nher mother, that a man might find it difficult to live with Mrs.\nTrevelyan. \"She hardly ever yields about anything,\" said Priscilla.\nAs Miss Priscilla Stanbury was also very fond of having her own way,\nit was not surprising that she should object to that quality in this\nlady, who had come to live under the same roof with her.\n\nThe country about Nuncombe Putney is perhaps as pretty as any in\nEngland. It is beyond the river Teign, between that and Dartmoor,\nand is so lovely in all its variations of rivers, rivulets, broken\nground, hills and dales, old broken, battered, time-worn timber,\ngreen knolls, rich pastures, and heathy common, that the wonder is\nthat English lovers of scenery know so little of it. At the Stag and\nAntlers old Mrs. Crocket, than whom no old woman in the public line\nwas ever more generous, more peppery, or more kind, kept two clean\nbed-rooms, and could cook a leg of Dartmoor mutton and make an apple\npie against any woman in Devonshire. \"Drat your fish!\" she would say,\nwhen some self-indulgent and exacting traveller would wish for more\nthan these accustomed viands. \"Cock you up with dainties! If you\ncan't eat your victuals without fish, you must go to Exeter. And\nthen you'll get it stinking mayhap.\" Now Priscilla Stanbury and Mrs.\nCrocket were great friends, and there had been times of deep want,\nin which Mrs. Crocket's friendship had been very serviceable to the\nladies at the cottage. The three young women had been to the inn one\nmorning to ask after a conveyance from Nuncombe Putney to Princetown,\nand had found that a four-wheeled open carriage with an old horse\nand a very young driver could be hired there. \"We have never dreamed\nof such a thing,\" Priscilla Stanbury had said, \"and the only time\nI was at Princetown I walked there and back.\" So they had called at\nthe Stag and Antlers, and Mrs. Crocket had told them her mind upon\nseveral matters.\n\n\"What a dear old woman!\" said Nora, as they came away, having made\ntheir bargain for the open carriage.\n\n\"I think she takes quite enough upon herself, you know,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan.\n\n\"She is a dear old woman,\" said Priscilla, not attending at all to\nthe last words that had been spoken. \"She is one of the best friends\nI have in the world. If I were to say the best out of my own family,\nperhaps I should not be wrong.\"\n\n\"But she uses such very odd language for a woman,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan. Now Mrs. Crocket had certainly \"dratted\" and \"darned\" the\nboy, who wouldn't come as fast as she had wished, and had laughed\nat Mrs. Trevelyan very contemptuously, when that lady had suggested\nthat the urchin, who was at last brought forth, might not be a safe\ncharioteer down some of the hills.\n\n\"I suppose I'm used to it,\" said Priscilla. \"At any rate I know I\nlike it. And I like her.\"\n\n\"I dare say she's a good sort of woman,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan,\n\"only--\"\n\n\"I am not saying anything about her being a good woman now,\" said\nPriscilla, interrupting the other with some vehemence, \"but only that\nshe is my friend.\"\n\n\"I liked her of all things,\" said Nora. \"Has she lived here always?\"\n\n\"Yes; all her life. The house belonged to her father and to her\ngrandfather before her, and I think she says she has never slept\nout of it a dozen times in her life. Her husband is dead, and her\ndaughters are married away, and she has the great grief and trouble\nof a ne'er-do-well son. He's away now, and she's all alone.\" Then\nafter a pause, she continued; \"I dare say it seems odd to you, Mrs.\nTrevelyan, that we should speak of the innkeeper as a dear friend;\nbut you must remember that we have been poor among the poorest--and\nare so indeed now. We only came into our present house to receive\nyou. That is where we used to live,\" and she pointed to the tiny\ncottage, which now that it was dismantled and desolate, looked to be\ndoubly poor. \"There have been times when we should have gone to bed\nvery hungry if it had not been for Mrs. Crocket.\"\n\nLater in the day Mrs. Trevelyan, finding Priscilla alone, had\napologized for what she had said about the old woman. \"I was very\nthoughtless and forgetful, but I hope you will not be angry with me.\nI will be ever so fond of her if you will forgive me.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Priscilla, smiling; \"on those conditions I will\nforgive you.\" And from that time there sprang up something like\na feeling of friendship between Priscilla and Mrs. Trevelyan.\nNevertheless Priscilla was still of opinion that the Clock House\narrangement was dangerous, and should never have been made; and Mrs.\nStanbury, always timid of her own nature, began to fear that it must\nbe so, as soon as she was removed from the influence of her son. She\ndid not see much even of the few neighbours who lived around her, but\nshe fancied that people looked at her in church as though she had\ndone that which she ought not to have done, in taking herself to a\nbig and comfortable house for the sake of lending her protection to a\nlady who was separated from her husband. It was not that she believed\nthat Mrs. Trevelyan had been wrong; but that, knowing herself to be\nweak, she fancied that she and her daughter would be enveloped in the\ndanger and suspicion which could not but attach themselves to the\nlady's condition, instead of raising the lady out of the cloud,--as\nwould have been the case had she herself been strong. Mrs. Trevelyan,\nwho was sharpsighted and clear-witted, soon saw that it was so, and\nspoke to Priscilla on the subject before she had been a fortnight in\nthe house. \"I am afraid your mother does not like our being here,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"How am I to answer that?\" Priscilla replied.\n\n\"Just tell the truth.\"\n\n\"The truth is so uncivil. At first I did not like it. I disliked it\nvery much.\"\n\n\"Why did you give way?\"\n\n\"I didn't give way. Hugh talked my mother over. Mamma does what I\ntell her, except when Hugh tells her something else. I was afraid,\nbecause, down here, knowing nothing of the world, I didn't wish\nthat we, little people, should be mixed up in the quarrels and\ndisagreements of those who are so much bigger.\"\n\n\"I don't know who it is that is big in this matter.\"\n\n\"You are big,--at any rate by comparison. But now it must go on. The\nhouse has been taken, and my fears are over as regards you. What you\nobserve in mamma is only the effect, not yet quite worn out, of what\nI said before you came. You may be quite sure of this,--that we\nneither of us believe a word against you. Your position is a very\nunfortunate one; but if it can be remedied by your staying here with\nus, pray stay with us.\"\n\n\"It cannot be remedied,\" said Emily; \"but we could not be anywhere\nmore comfortable than we are here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nWHAT THEY SAID ABOUT IT IN THE CLOSE.\n\n\nWhen Miss Stanbury, in the Close at Exeter, was first told of the\narrangement that had been made at Nuncombe Putney, she said some very\nhard words as to the thing that had been done. She was quite sure\nthat Mrs. Trevelyan was no better than she should be. Ladies who were\nseparated from their husbands never were any better than they should\nbe. And what was to be thought of any woman, who, when separated from\nher husband, would put herself under the protection of such a Paladin\nas Hugh Stanbury? She heard the tidings of course from Dorothy, and\nspoke her mind even to Dorothy plainly enough; but it was to Martha\nthat she expressed herself with her fullest vehemence.\n\n\"We always knew,\" she said, \"that my brother had married an\naddle-pated, silly woman, one of the most unsuited to be the mistress\nof a clergyman's house that ever a man set eyes on; but I didn't\nthink she'd allow herself to be led into such a stupid thing as\nthis.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose the lady has done anything amiss,--any more than\ncombing her husband's hair, and the like of that,\" said Martha.\n\n\"Don't tell me! Why, by their own story, she has got a lover.\"\n\n\"But he ain't to come after her down here, I suppose. And as for\nlovers, ma'am, I'm told that the most of 'em have 'em up in London.\nBut it don't mean much, only just idle talking and gallivanting.\"\n\n\"When women can't keep themselves from idle talking with strange\ngentlemen, they are very far gone on the road to the devil. That's\nmy notion. And that was everybody's notion a few years ago. But now,\nwhat with divorce bills, and women's rights, and penny papers, and\nfalse hair, and married women being just like giggling girls, and\ngiggling girls knowing just as much as married women, when a woman\nhas been married a year or two she begins to think whether she mayn't\nhave more fun for her money by living apart from her husband.\"\n\n\"Miss Dorothy says--\"\n\n\"Oh, bother what Miss Dorothy says! Miss Dorothy only knows what\nit has suited that scamp, her brother, to tell her. I understand\nthis woman has come away because of a lover; and if that's so, my\nsister-in-law is very wrong to receive her. The temptation of the\nClock House has been too much for her. It's not my doing; that's\nall.\"\n\nThat evening Miss Stanbury and Dorothy went out to tea at the house\nof Mrs. MacHugh, and there the matter was very much discussed. The\nfamily of the Trevelyans was known by name in these parts, and the\nfact of Mrs. Trevelyan having been sent to live in a Devonshire\nvillage, with Devonshire ladies who had a relation in Exeter so\nwell esteemed as Miss Stanbury of the Close, were circumstances of\nthemselves sufficient to ensure a considerable amount of prestige\nat the city tea-table for the tidings of this unfortunate family\nquarrel. Some reticence was of course necessary because of the\npresence of Miss Stanbury and of Dorothy. To Miss Stanbury herself\nMrs. MacHugh and Mrs. Crumbie, of Cronstadt House, did not scruple\nto express themselves very plainly, and to whisper a question as to\nwhat was to be done should the lover make his appearance at Nuncombe\nPutney; but they who spoke of the matter before Dorothy, were at\nfirst more charitable, or, at least, more forbearing. Mr. Gibson,\nwho was one of the minor canons, and the two Miss Frenches from\nHeavitree, who had the reputation of hunting unmarried clergymen in\ncouples, seemed to have heard all about it. When Mrs. MacHugh and\nMiss Stanbury, with Mr. and Mrs. Crumbie, had seated themselves at\ntheir whist-table, the younger people were able to express their\nopinions without danger of interruption or of rebuke. It was known\nto all Exeter by this time, that Dorothy Stanbury's mother had gone\nto the Clock House, and that she had done so in order that Mrs.\nTrevelyan might have a home. But it was not yet known whether anybody\nhad called upon them. There was Mrs. Merton, the wife of the present\nparson of Nuncombe, who had known the Stanburys for the last twenty\nyears; and there was Mrs. Ellison of Lessboro', who lived only four\nmiles from Nuncombe, and who kept a pony-carriage. It would be a\ngreat thing to know how these ladies had behaved in so difficult and\nembarrassing a position. Mrs. Trevelyan and her sister had now been\nat Nuncombe Putney for more than a fortnight, and something in that\nmatter of calling must have been done,--or have been left undone. In\nanswer to an ingeniously-framed question asked by Camilla French,\nDorothy at once set the matter at rest. \"Mrs. Merton,\" said Camilla\nFrench, \"must find it a great thing to have two new ladies come to\nthe village, especially now that she has lost you, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Mamma tells me,\" said Dorothy, \"that Mrs. Trevelyan and Miss Rowley\ndo not mean to know anybody. They have given it out quite plainly, so\nthat there should be no mistake.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Camilla French.\n\n\"I dare say it's for the best,\" said Arabella French, who was the\nelder, and who looked very meek and soft. Miss French almost always\nlooked meek and soft.\n\n\"I'm afraid it will make it very dull for your mother,--not seeing\nher old friends,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"Mamma won't feel that at all,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Mrs. Stanbury, I suppose, will see her own friends at her own house\njust the same,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"There would be great difficulty in that, when there is a lady who is\nto remain unknown,\" said Arabella. \"Don't you think so, Mr. Gibson?\"\nMr. Gibson replied that perhaps there might be a difficulty, but he\nwasn't sure. The difficulty, he thought, might be got over if the\nladies did not always occupy the same room.\n\n\"You have never seen Mrs. Trevelyan, have you, Miss Stanbury?\" asked\nCamilla.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"She is not an old family friend, then,--or anything of that sort?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Arabella, \"it is so odd how different people get\ntogether sometimes.\" Then Dorothy explained that Mr. Trevelyan and\nher brother Hugh had long been friends.\n\n\"Oh!--of Mr. Trevelyan,\" said Camilla. \"Then it is he that has sent\nhis wife to Nuncombe, not she that has come there?\"\n\n\"I suppose there has been some agreement,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Just so; just so,\" said Arabella, the meek. \"I should like to see\nher. They say that she is very beautiful; don't they?\"\n\n\"My brother says that she is handsome.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly lovely, I'm told,\" said Camilla. \"I should like to see\nher,--shouldn't you, Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"I always like to see a pretty woman,\" said Mr. Gibson, with a polite\nbow, which the sisters shared between them.\n\n\"I suppose she'll go to church,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"Very likely not,\" said Arabella. \"Ladies of that sort very often\ndon't go to church. I dare say you'll find that she'll never stir\nout of the place at all, and that not a soul in Nuncombe will ever\nsee her except the gardener. It is such a thing for a woman to be\nseparated from her husband! Don't you think so, Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said he, with a shake of his head, which was\nintended to imply that the censure of the church must of course\nattend any sundering of those whom the church had bound together; but\nwhich implied also by the absence from it of any intense clerical\nseverity, that as the separated wife was allowed to live with so very\nrespectable a lady as Mrs. Stanbury, there must probably be some\nmitigating circumstances attending this special separation.\n\n\"I wonder what he is like?\" said Camilla, after a pause.\n\n\"Who?\" asked Arabella.\n\n\"The gentleman,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"What gentleman?\" demanded Arabella.\n\n\"I don't mean Mr. Trevelyan,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"I don't believe there really is,--eh,--is there?\" said Mr. Gibson,\nvery timidly.\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"I'm afraid there's something of the kind,\" said Camilla. \"I've heard\nthat there is, and I've heard his name.\" Then she whispered very\nclosely into the ear of Mr. Gibson the words, \"Colonel Osborne,\" as\nthough her lips were by far too pure to mention aloud any sound so\nfull of iniquity.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"But he's quite an old man,\" said Dorothy, \"and knew her father\nintimately before she was born. And, as far as I can understand, her\nhusband does not suspect her in the least. And it's only because\nthere's a misunderstanding between them, and not at all because of\nthe gentleman.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Camilla.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Arabella.\n\n\"That would make a difference,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"But for a married woman to have her name mentioned at all with a\ngentleman,--it is so bad; is it not, Mr. Gibson?\" And then Arabella\nalso had her whisper into the clergyman's ear,--very closely. \"I'm\nafraid there's not a doubt about the Colonel. I'm afraid not. I am\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Two by honours and the odd, and it's my deal,\" said Miss Stanbury,\nbriskly, and the sharp click with which she put the markers down\nupon the table was heard all through the room. \"I don't want anybody\nto tell me,\" she said, \"that when a young woman is parted from her\nhusband, the chances are ten to one that she has been very foolish.\"\n\n\"But what's a woman to do, if her husband beats her?\" said Mrs.\nCrumbie.\n\n\"Beat him again,\" said Mrs. MacHugh.\n\n\"And the husband will be sure to have the worst of it,\" said Mr.\nCrumbie. \"Well, I declare, if you haven't turned up an honour again,\nMiss Stanbury!\"\n\n\"It was your wife that cut it to me, Mr. Crumbie.\" Then they were\nagain at once immersed in the play, and the name neither of Trevelyan\nnor Osborne was heard till Miss Stanbury was marking her double under\nthe candlestick; but during all pauses in the game the conversation\nwent back to the same topic, and when the rubber was over they\nwho had been playing it lost themselves for ten minutes in the\nallurements of the interesting subject. It was so singular a\ncoincidence that the lady should have gone to Nuncombe Putney of\nall villages in England, and to the house of Mrs. Stanbury of all\nladies in England. And then was she innocent, or was she guilty; and\nif guilty, in what degree? That she had been allowed to bring her\nbaby with her was considered to be a great point in her favour. Mr.\nCrumbie's opinion was that it was \"only a few words.\" Mrs. Crumbie\nwas afraid that she had been a little light. Mrs. MacHugh said that\nthere was never fire without smoke. And Miss Stanbury, as she took\nher departure, declared that the young women of the present day\ndidn't know what they were after. \"They think that the world should\nbe all frolic and dancing, and they have no more idea of doing their\nduty and earning their bread than a boy home for the holidays has of\ndoing lessons.\"\n\nThen, as she went home with Dorothy across the Close, she spoke a\nword which she intended to be very serious. \"I don't mean to say\nanything against your mother for what she has done as yet. Somebody\nmust take the woman in, and perhaps it was natural. But if that\nColonel What's-his-name makes his way down to Nuncombe Putney, your\nmother must send her packing, if she has any respect either for\nherself or for Priscilla.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nDARTMOOR.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe well-weighed decision of Miss Stanbury respecting the\nStanbury-Trevelyan arrangement at Nuncombe Putney had been\ncommunicated to Dorothy as the two walked home at night across the\nClose from Mrs. MacHugh's house, and it was accepted by Dorothy\nas being wise and proper. It amounted to this. If Mrs. Trevelyan\nshould behave herself with propriety in her retirement at the Clock\nHouse, no further blame in the matter should be attributed to Mrs.\nStanbury for receiving her,--at any rate in Dorothy's hearing. The\nexisting scheme, whether wise or foolish, should be regarded as an\naccepted scheme. But if Mrs. Trevelyan should be indiscreet,--if,\nfor instance, Colonel Osborne should show himself at Nuncombe\nPutney,--then, for the sake of the family, Miss Stanbury would speak\nout, and would speak out very loudly. All this Dorothy understood,\nand she could perceive that her aunt had strong suspicion that there\nwould be indiscretion.\n\n\"I never knew one like her,\" said Miss Stanbury, \"who, when she'd got\naway from one man, didn't want to have another dangling after her.\"\n\nA week had hardly passed after the party at Mrs. MacHugh's, and Mrs.\nTrevelyan had hardly been three weeks at Nuncombe Putney, before the\ntidings which Miss Stanbury almost expected reached her ears.\n\n\"The Colonel's been at the Clock House, ma'am,\" said Martha.\n\nNow, it was quite understood in the Close by this time that \"the\nColonel\" meant Colonel Osborne.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I'm told he has though, ma'am, for sure and certain.\"\n\n\"Who says so?\"\n\n\"Giles Hickbody was down at Lessboro', and see'd him hisself,--a\nportly, middle-aged man,--not one of your young scampish-like\nlovers.\"\n\n\"That's the man.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. He went over to Nuncombe Putney, as sure as\nanything;--hired Mrs. Clegg's chaise and pair, and asked for Mrs.\nTrevelyan's house as open as anything. When Giles asked in the yard,\nthey told him as how that was the married lady's young man.\"\n\n\"I'd like to be at his tail,--so I would,--with a mop-handle,\" said\nMiss Stanbury, whose hatred for those sins by which the comfort and\nrespectability of the world are destroyed, was not only sincere, but\nintense. \"Well; and what then?\"\n\n\"He came back and slept at Mrs. Clegg's that night,--at least, that\nwas what he said he should do.\"\n\nMiss Stanbury, however, was not so precipitate or uncharitable as\nto act strongly upon information such as this. Before she even said\na word to Dorothy, she made further inquiry. She made very minute\ninquiry, writing even to her very old and intimate friend Mrs.\nEllison, of Lessboro',--writing to that lady a most cautious and\nguarded letter. At last it became a fact proved to her mind that\nColonel Osborne had been at the Clock House, had been received there,\nand had remained there for hours,--had been allowed access to Mrs.\nTrevelyan, and had slept the night at the inn at Lessboro'. The thing\nwas so terrible to Miss Stanbury's mind, that even false hair, Dr.\nColenso, and penny newspapers did not account for it.\n\n\"I shall begin to believe that the Evil One has been allowed to come\namong us in person because of our sins,\" she said to Martha;--and she\nmeant it.\n\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Trevelyan, as may be remembered, had hired Mrs.\nCrocket's open carriage, and the three young women, Mrs. Trevelyan,\nNora, and Priscilla, made a little excursion to Princetown, somewhat\nafter the fashion of a picnic. At Princetown, in the middle of\nDartmoor, about nine miles from Nuncombe Putney, is the prison\nestablishment at which are kept convicts undergoing penal servitude.\nIt is regarded by all the country round with great interest, chiefly\nbecause the prisoners now and again escape, and then there comes a\nperiod of interesting excitement until the escaped felon shall have\nbeen again taken. How can you tell where he may be, or whether it may\nnot suit him to find his rest in your own cupboard, or under your own\nbed? And then, as escape without notice will of course be the felon's\nobject, to attain that he will probably cut your throat, and the\nthroat of everybody belonging to you. All which considerations give\nan interest to Princetown, and excite in the hearts of the Devonians\nof these parts a strong affection for the Dartmoor prison. Of those\nwho visit Princetown comparatively few effect an entrance within the\nwalls of the gaol. They look at the gloomy place with a mysterious\ninterest, feeling something akin to envy for the prisoners who have\nenjoyed the privilege of solving the mysteries of prison life, and\nwho know how men feel when they have their hair cut short, and are\nfree from moral responsibility for their own conduct, and are moved\nabout in gangs, and treated like wild beasts.\n\nBut the journey to Princetown, from whatever side it is approached,\nhas the charm of wild and beautiful scenery. The spot itself is ugly\nenough; but you can go not thither without breathing the sweetest,\nfreshest air, and encountering that delightful sense of romance which\nmoorland scenery always produces. The idea of our three friends was\nto see the Moor rather than the prison, to learn something of the\ncountry around, and to enjoy the excitement of eating a sandwich\nsitting on a hillock, in exchange for the ordinary comforts of a good\ndinner with chairs and tables. A bottle of sherry and water and a\npaper of sandwiches contained their whole banquet; for ladies, though\nthey like good things at picnics, and, indeed, at other times, almost\nas well as men like them, very seldom prepare dainties for themselves\nalone. Men are wiser and more thoughtful, and are careful to have the\ngood things, even if they are to be enjoyed without companionship.\n\nMrs. Crocket's boy, though he was only about three feet high, was a\nmiracle of skill and discretion. He used the machine, as the patent\ndrag is called, in going down the hills with the utmost care. He\nnever forced the beast beyond a walk if there was the slightest rise\nin the ground; and as there was always a rise, the journey was slow.\nBut the three ladies enjoyed it thoroughly, and Mrs. Trevelyan was in\nbetter spirits than she herself had thought to be possible for her\nin her present condition. Most of us have recognised the fact that\na dram of spirits will create,--that a so-called nip of brandy will\ncreate hilarity, or, at least, alacrity, and that a glass of sherry\nwill often \"pick up\" and set in order the prostrate animal and mental\nfaculties of the drinker. But we are not sufficiently alive to\nthe fact that copious draughts of fresh air,--of air fresh and\nunaccustomed,--will have precisely the same effect. We do know that\nnow and again it is very essential to \"change the air;\" but we\ngenerally consider that to do that with any chance of advantage, it\nis necessary to go far afield; and we think also that such change of\nthe air is only needful when sickness of the body has come upon us,\nor when it threatens to come. We are seldom aware that we may imbibe\nlong potations of pleasure and healthy excitement without perhaps\ngoing out of our own county; that such potations are within a day's\njourney of most of us; and that they are to be had for half-a-crown\na head, all expenses told. Mrs. Trevelyan probably did not know that\nthe cloud was lifted off her mind, and the load of her sorrow made\nlight to her, by the special vigour of the air of the Moor; but\nshe did know that she was enjoying herself, and that the world was\npleasanter to her than it had been for months past.\n\nWhen they had sat upon their hillocks, and eaten their\nsandwiches,--regretting that the basket of provisions had not been\nbigger,--and had drunk their sherry and water out of the little horn\nmug which Mrs. Crocket had lent them, Nora started off across the\nmoorland alone. The horse had been left to be fed in Princetown, and\nthey had walked back to a bush under which they had rashly left their\nbasket of provender concealed. It happened, however, that on that day\nthere was no escaped felon about to watch what they had done, and\nthe food and the drink had been found secure. Nora had gone off, and\nas her sister and Priscilla sat leaning against their hillocks with\ntheir backs to the road, she could be seen standing now on one little\neminence and now on another, thinking, doubtless, as she stood on the\none how good it would be to be Lady Peterborough, and, as she stood\non the other, how much better to be Mrs. Hugh Stanbury. Only,--before\nshe could be Mrs. Hugh Stanbury it would be necessary that Mr. Hugh\nStanbury should share her opinion,--and necessary also that he should\nbe able to maintain a wife. \"I should never do to be a very poor\nman's wife,\" she said to herself; and remembered as she said it, that\nin reference to the prospect of her being Lady Peterborough, the man\nwho was to be Lord Peterborough was at any rate ready to make her his\nwife, and on that side there were none of those difficulties about\nhouse, and money, and position which stood in the way of the Hugh\nStanbury side of the question. She was not, she thought, fit to be\nthe wife of a very poor man; but she conceived of herself that she\nwould do very well as a future Lady Peterborough in the drawing-rooms\nof Monkhams. She was so far vain as to fancy that she could look,\nand speak, and move, and have her being after the fashion which is\napproved for the Lady Peterboroughs of the world. It was not clear\nto her that Nature had not expressly intended her to be a Lady\nPeterborough; whereas, as far as she could see, Nature had not\nintended her to be a Mrs. Hugh Stanbury, with a precarious income of\nperhaps ten guineas a week when journalism was doing well. So she\nmoved on to another little eminence to think of it there. It was\nclear to her that if she should accept Mr. Glascock she would sell\nherself, and not give herself away; and she had told herself scores\nof times before this, that a young woman should give herself away,\nand not sell herself;--should either give herself away, or keep\nherself to herself as circumstances might go. She had been quite sure\nthat she would never sell herself. But this was a lesson which she\nhad taught herself when she was very young, before she had come to\nunderstand the world and its hard necessities. Nothing, she now told\nherself, could be worse than to hang like a mill-stone round the neck\nof a poor man. It might be a very good thing to give herself away for\nlove,--but it would not be a good thing to be the means of ruining\nthe man she loved, even if that man were willing to be so ruined.\nAnd then she thought that she could also love that other man a\nlittle,--could love him sufficiently for comfortable domestic\npurposes. And it would undoubtedly be very pleasant to have all the\ntroubles of her life settled for her. If she were Mrs. Glascock,\nknown to the world as the future Lady Peterborough, would it not be\nwithin her power to bring her sister and her sister's husband again\ntogether? The tribute of the Monkhams' authority and influence to her\nsister's side of the question would be most salutary. She tried to\nmake herself believe that in this way she would be doing a good deed.\nUpon the whole, she thought that if Mr. Glascock should give her\nanother chance she would accept him. And he had distinctly promised\nthat he would give her another chance. It might be that this\nunfortunate quarrel in the Trevelyan family would deter him. People\ndo not wish to ally themselves with family quarrels. But if the\nchance came in her way she would accept it. She had made up her mind\nto that, when she turned round from off the last knoll on which she\nhad stood, to return to her sister and Priscilla Stanbury.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Nora tries to make herself believe.]\n\n\nThey two had sat still under the shade of a thorn bush, looking at\nNora as she was wandering about, and talking together more freely\nthan they had ever done before on the circumstances that had brought\nthem together. \"How pretty she looks,\" Priscilla had said, as Nora\nwas standing with her figure clearly marked by the light.\n\n\"Yes; she is very pretty, and has been much admired. This terrible\naffair of mine is a cruel blow to her.\"\n\n\"You mean that it is bad for her to come and live here--without\nsociety.\"\n\n\"Not exactly that,--though of course it would be better for her to go\nout. And I don't know how a girl is ever to get settled in the world\nunless she goes out. But it is always an injury to be connected in\nany way with a woman who is separated from her husband. It must be\nbad for you.\"\n\n\"It won't hurt me,\" said Priscilla. \"Nothing of that kind can hurt\nme.\"\n\n\"I mean that people say such ill-natured things.\"\n\n\"I stand alone, and can take care of myself,\" said Priscilla. \"I defy\nthe evil tongues of all the world to hurt me. My personal cares are\nlimited to an old gown and bread and cheese. I like a pair of gloves\nto go to church with, but that is only the remnant of a prejudice.\nThe world has so very little to give me, that I am pretty nearly sure\nthat it will take nothing away.\"\n\n\"And you are contented?\"\n\n\"Well, no; I can't say that I am contented. I hardly think that\nanybody ought to be contented. Should my mother die and Dorothy\nremain with my aunt, or get married, I should be utterly alone in the\nworld. Providence, or whatever you call it, has made me a lady after\na fashion, so that I can't live with the ploughmen's wives, and at\nthe same time has so used me in other respects, that I can't live\nwith anybody else.\"\n\n\"Why should not you get married, as well as Dorothy?\"\n\n\"Who would have me? And if I had a husband I should want a good\none,--a man with a head on his shoulders, and a heart. Even if I\nwere young and good-looking, or rich, I doubt whether I could please\nmyself. As it is I am as likely to be taken bodily to heaven, as to\nbecome any man's wife.\"\n\n\"I suppose most women think so of themselves at some time, and yet\nthey are married.\"\n\n\"I am not fit to marry. I am often cross, and I like my own way, and\nI have a distaste for men. I never in my life saw a man whom I wished\neven to make my intimate friend. I should think any man an idiot who\nbegan to make soft speeches to me, and I should tell him so.\"\n\n\"Ah; you might find it different when he went on with it.\"\n\n\"But I think,\" said Priscilla, \"that when a woman is married there is\nnothing to which she should not submit on behalf of her husband.\"\n\n\"You mean that for me.\"\n\n\"Of course I mean it for you. How should I not be thinking of you,\nliving as you are under the same roof with us? And I am thinking of\nLouey.\" Louey was the baby. \"What are you to do when after a year or\ntwo his father shall send for him to have him under his own care?\"\n\n\"Nothing shall separate me from my child,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan\neagerly.\n\n\"That is easily said; but I suppose the power of doing as he pleased\nwould be with him.\"\n\n\"Why should it be with him? I do not at all know that it would be\nwith him. I have not left his house. It is he that has turned me\nout.\"\n\n\"There can, I think, be very little doubt what you should do,\" said\nPriscilla, after a pause, during which she had got up from her seat\nunder the thorn bush.\n\n\"What should I do?\" asked Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Go back to him.\"\n\n\"I will to-morrow if he will write and ask me. Nay; how could I help\nmyself? I am his creature, and must go or come as he bids me. I am\nhere only because he has sent me.\"\n\n\"You should write and ask him to take you.\"\n\n\"Ask him to forgive me because he has ill-treated me?\"\n\n\"Never mind about that,\" said Priscilla, standing over her companion,\nwho was still lying under the bush. \"All that is twopenny-halfpenny\npride, which should be thrown to the winds. The more right you have\nbeen hitherto the better you can afford to go on being right. What is\nit that we all live upon but self-esteem? When we want praise it is\nonly because praise enables us to think well of ourselves. Every one\nto himself is the centre and pivot of all the world.\"\n\n\"It's a very poor world that goes round upon my pivot,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan.\n\n\"I don't know how this quarrel came up,\" exclaimed Priscilla, \"and\nI don't care to know. But it seems a trumpery quarrel,--as to who\nshould beg each other's pardon first, and all that kind of thing.\nSheer and simple nonsense! Ask him to let it all be forgotten. I\nsuppose he loves you?\"\n\n\"How can I know? He did once.\"\n\n\"And you love him?\"\n\n\"Yes. I love him certainly.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can have a doubt. Here is Jack with the\ncarriage, and if we don't mind he'll pass us by without seeing us.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Trevelyan got up, and when they had succeeded in diverting\nJack's attention for a moment from the horse, they called to Nora,\nwho was still moving about from one knoll to another, and who showed\nno desire to abandon the contemplations in which she had been\nengaged.\n\nIt had been mid-day before they left home in the morning, and they\nwere due to be at home in time for tea,--which is an epoch in the\nday generally allowed to be more elastic than some others. When Mrs.\nStanbury lived in the cottage her hour for tea had been six; this had\nbeen stretched to half-past seven when she received Mrs. Trevelyan at\nthe Clock House; and it was half-past eight before Jack landed them\nat their door. It was manifest to them all as they entered the house\nthat there was an air of mystery in the face of the girl who had\nopened the door for them. She did not speak, however, till they were\nall within the passage. Then she uttered a few words very solemnly.\n\"There be a gentleman come,\" she said.\n\n\"A gentleman!\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, thinking in the first moment of\nher husband, and in the second of Colonel Osborne.\n\n\"He be for you, miss,\" said the girl, bobbing her head at Nora.\n\nUpon hearing this Nora sank speechless into the chair which stood in\nthe passage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA GENTLEMAN COMES TO NUNCOMBE PUTNEY.\n\n\nIt soon became known to them all as they remained clustered in the\nhall that Mr. Glascock was in the house. Mrs. Stanbury came out to\nthem and informed them that he had been at Nuncombe Putney for the\nlast five hours, and that he had asked for Mrs. Trevelyan when he\ncalled. It became evident as the affairs of the evening went on, that\nMrs. Stanbury had for a few minutes been thrown into a terrible state\nof amazement, thinking that \"the Colonel\" had appeared. The strange\ngentleman, however, having obtained admittance, explained who he was,\nsaying that he was very desirous of seeing Mrs. Trevelyan,--and Miss\nRowley. It may be presumed that a glimmer of light did make its way\ninto Mrs. Stanbury's mind on the subject; but up to the moment at\nwhich the three travellers arrived, she had been in doubt on the\nsubject. Mr. Glascock had declared that he would take a walk, and\nin the course of the afternoon had expressed high approval of Mrs.\nCrocket's culinary skill. When Mrs. Crocket heard that she had\nentertained the son of a lord, she was very loud in her praise of the\nmanner in which he had eaten two mutton chops and called for a third.\nHe had thought it no disgrace to apply himself to the second half\nof an apple pie, and had professed himself to be an ardent admirer\nof Devonshire cream. \"It's them counter-skippers as turns up their\nlittle noses at the victuals as is set before them,\" said Mrs.\nCrocket.\n\nAfter his dinner Mr. Glascock had returned to the Clock House, and\nhad been sitting there for an hour with Mrs. Stanbury, not much to\nher delight or to his, when the carriage was driven up to the door.\n\n\"He is to go back to Lessboro' to-night,\" said Mrs. Stanbury in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Of course you must see him before he goes,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan to\nher sister. There had, as was natural, been very much said between\nthe two sisters about Mr. Glascock. Nora had abstained from asserting\nin any decided way that she disliked the man, and had always\nabsolutely refused to allow Hugh Stanbury's name to be mixed up with\nthe question. Whatever might be her own thoughts about Hugh Stanbury\nshe had kept them even from her sister. When her sister had told her\nthat she had refused Mr. Glascock because of Hugh, she had shown\nherself to be indignant, and had since that said one or two fine\nthings as to her capacity to refuse a brilliant offer simply because\nthe man who had made it was indifferent to her. Mrs. Trevelyan had\nlearned from her that her suitor had declared his intention to\npersevere; and here was perseverance with a vengeance! \"Of course you\nmust see him,--at once,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. Nora for a few seconds\nhad remained silent, and then had run up to her room. Her sister\nfollowed her instantly.\n\n\"What is the meaning of it all?\" said Priscilla to her mother.\n\n\"I suppose he is in love with Miss Rowley,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"But who is he?\"\n\nThen Mrs. Stanbury told all that she knew. She had seen from his\ncard that he was an Honourable Mr. Glascock. She had collected from\nwhat he had said that he was an old friend of the two ladies. Her\nconviction was strong in Mr. Glascock's favour,--thinking, as she\nexpressed herself, that everything was right and proper,--but she\ncould hardly explain why she thought so.\n\n\"I do wish that they had never come,\" said Priscilla, who could not\nrid herself of an idea that there must be danger in having to do with\nwomen who had men running after them.\n\n\"Of course I'll see him,\" said Nora to her sister. \"I have not\nrefused to see him. Why do you scold me?\"\n\n\"I have not scolded you, Nora; but I do want you to think how\nimmensely important this is.\"\n\n\"Of course it is important.\"\n\n\"And so much the more so because of my misfortunes! Think how good he\nmust be, how strong must be his attachment, when he comes down here\nafter you in this way.\"\n\n\"But I have to think of my own feelings.\"\n\n\"You know you like him. You have told me so. And only fancy what\nmamma will feel! Such a position! And the man so excellent! Everybody\nsays that he hasn't a fault in any way.\"\n\n\"I hate people without faults.\"\n\n\"Oh, Nora, Nora, that is foolish! There, there; you must go down.\nPray,--pray do not let any absurd fancy stand in your way, and\ndestroy everything. It will never come again, Nora. And, only think;\nit is all now your own, if you will only whisper one word.\"\n\n\"Ah!--one word,--and that a falsehood!\"\n\n\"No,--no. Say you will try to love him, and that will be enough. And\nyou do love him?\"\n\n\"Do I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. It is only the opposition of your nature that makes you\nfight against him. Will you go now?\"\n\n\"Let me be for two minutes by myself,\" said Nora, \"and then I'll come\ndown. Tell him that I'm coming.\" Mrs. Trevelyan stooped over her,\nkissed her, and then left her.\n\nNora, as soon as she was alone, stood upright in the middle of the\nroom and held her hands up to her forehead. She had been far from\nthinking, when she was considering the matter easily among the\nhillocks, that the necessity for an absolute decision would come upon\nher so instantaneously. She had told herself only this morning that\nit would be wise to accept the man, if he should ever ask a second\ntime;--and he had come already. He had been waiting for her in the\nvillage while she had been thinking whether he would ever come across\nher path again. She thought that it would have been easier for her\nnow to have gone down with a \"yes\" in her mouth, if her sister had\nnot pressed her so hard to say that \"yes.\" The very pressure from her\nsister seemed to imply that such pressure ought to be resisted. Why\nshould there have been pressure, unless there were reasons against\nher marrying him? And yet, if she chose to take him, who would have\na right to complain of her? Hugh Stanbury had never spoken to her a\nword that would justify her in even supposing that he would consider\nhimself to be ill-used. All others of her friends would certainly\nrejoice, would applaud her, pat her on the back, cover her with\ncaresses, and tell her that she had been born under a happy star. And\nshe did like the man. Nay;--she thought she loved him. She withdrew\nher hands from her brow, assured herself that her lot in life was\ncast, and with hurrying fingers attempted to smooth her hair and to\narrange her ribbons before the glass. She would go to the encounter\nboldly and accept him honestly. It was her duty to do so. What might\nshe not do for brothers and sisters as the wife of Lord Peterborough\nof Monkhams? She saw that that arrangement before the glass could be\nof no service, and she stepped quickly to the door. If he did not\nlike her as she was, he need not ask her. Her mind was made up, and\nshe would do it. But as she went down the stairs to the room in which\nshe knew that he was waiting for her, there came over her a cold\nfeeling of self-accusation,--almost of disgrace. \"I do not care,\"\nshe said. \"I know that I'm right.\" She opened the door quickly, that\nthere might be no further doubt, and found that she was alone with\nhim.\n\n\"Miss Rowley,\" he said, \"I am afraid you will think that I am\npersecuting you.\"\n\n\"I have no right to think that,\" she answered.\n\n\"I'll tell you why I have come. My dear father, who has always been\nmy best friend, is very ill. He is at Naples, and I must go to him.\nHe is very old, you know,--over eighty; and will never live to come\nback to England. From what I hear, I think it probable that I may\nremain with him till everything is over.\"\n\n\"I did not know that he was so old as that.\"\n\n\"They say that he can hardly live above a month or two. He will never\nsee my wife,--if I can have a wife; but I should like to tell him, if\nit were possible,--that,--that--\"\n\n\"I understand you, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"I told you that I should come to you again, and as I may possibly\nlinger at Naples all the winter, I could not go without seeing you.\nMiss Rowley, may I hope that you can love me?\"\n\nShe did not answer him a word, but stood looking away from him with\nher hands clasped together. Had he asked her whether she would be his\nwife, it is possible that the answer which she had prepared would\nhave been spoken. But he had put the question in another form. Did\nshe love him? If she could only bring herself to say that she could\nlove him, she might be lady of Monkhams before the next summer had\ncome round.\n\n\"Nora,\" he said, \"do you think that you can love me?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, and there was something almost of fierceness in the\ntone of her voice as she answered him.\n\n\"And must that be your final answer to me?\"\n\n\"Mr. Glascock, what can I say?\" she replied. \"I will tell you the\nhonest truth:--I will tell you everything. I came into this room\ndetermined to accept you. But you are so good, and so kind, and so\nupright, that I cannot tell you a falsehood. I do not love you. I\nought not to take what you offer me. If I did, it would be because\nyou are rich, and a lord; and not because I love you. I love some one\nelse. There;--pray, pray do not tell of me; but I do.\" Then she flung\naway from him and hid her face in a corner of the sofa out of the\nlight.\n\nHer lover stood silent, not knowing how to go on with the\nconversation, not knowing how to bring it to an end. After what\nshe had now said to him it was impossible that he should press her\nfurther. It was almost impossible that he should wish to do so. When\na lady is frank enough to declare that her heart is not her own to\ngive, a man can hardly wish to make further prayer for the gift. \"If\nso,\" he said, \"of course I have nothing to hope.\"\n\nShe was sobbing, and could not answer him. She was half repentant,\npartly proud of what she had done,--half repentant in that she had\nlost what had seemed to her to be so good, and full of remorse in\nthat she had so unnecessarily told her secret.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said he, \"I ought to assure you that what you have told me\nshall never be repeated by my lips.\"\n\nShe thanked him for this by a motion of her head and hand, not by\nwords;--and then he was gone. How he managed to bid adieu to Mrs.\nStanbury and her sister, or whether he saw them as he left the house,\nshe never knew. In her corner of the sofa, weeping in the dark,\npartly proud and partly repentant, she remained till her sister came\nto her. \"Emily,\" she said, jumping up, \"say nothing about it; not\na word. It is of no use. The thing is done and over, and let it\naltogether be forgotten.\"\n\n\"It is done and over, certainly,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Exactly;--and I suppose a girl may do what she likes with herself in\nthat way. If I choose to decline to take anything that is pleasant,\nand nice, and comfortable, nobody has a right to scold me. And I\nwon't be scolded.\"\n\n\"But, my child, who is scolding you?\"\n\n\"You mean to scold me. But it is of no use. The man has gone, and\nthere is an end of it. Nothing that you can say or I can think will\nbring him back again. I don't want anybody to tell me that it would\nbe better to be Lady Peterborough, with everything that the world has\nto give, than to live here without a soul to speak to, and to have to\ngo back to those horrible islands next year. You can't think that I\nam very comfortable.\"\n\n\"But what did you say to him, Nora?\"\n\n\"What did I say to him? What could I say to him? Why didn't he ask me\nto be his wife without saying anything about love? He asked me if I\nloved him. Of course I don't love him. I would have said I did, but\nit stuck in my throat. I am willing enough, I believe, to sell myself\nto the devil, but I don't know how to do it. Never mind. It's done,\nand now I'll go to bed.\"\n\nShe did go to bed, and Mrs. Trevelyan explained to the two ladies as\nmuch as was necessary of what had occurred. When Mrs. Stanbury came\nto understand that the gentleman who had been closeted with her\nwould, probably, in a few months be a lord himself, that he was a\nvery rich man, a member of Parliament, and one of those who are\ndecidedly born with gold spoons in their mouths, and understood also\nthat Nora Rowley had refused him, she was lost in amazement. Mr.\nGlascock was about forty years of age, and appeared to Nora Rowley,\nwho was nearly twenty years his junior, to be almost an old man.\nBut to Mrs. Stanbury, who was over sixty, Mr. Glascock seemed to be\nquite in the flower of his age. The bald place at the top of his head\nsimply showed that he had passed his boyhood, and the grey hairs at\nthe back of his whiskers were no more than outward signs of manly\ndiscretion. She could not understand why any girl should refuse such\nan offer, unless the man were himself bad in morals, or in temper.\nBut Mrs. Trevelyan had told her while Nora and Mr. Glascock were\ncloseted together, that he was believed by them all to be good and\ngentle. Nevertheless she felt a considerable increase of respect for\na young lady who had refused the eldest son of a lord. Priscilla,\nwhen she heard what had occurred, expressed to her mother a moderated\napproval. According to her views a girl would much more often be\nright to refuse an offer of marriage than to accept it, let him who\nmade the offer be who he might. And the fact of the man having been\nsent away with a refusal somewhat softened Priscilla's anger at his\ncoming there at all.\n\n\"I suppose he is a goose,\" said she to her mother, \"and I hope there\nwon't be any more of this kind running after them while they are with\nus.\"\n\nNora, when she was alone, wept till her heart was almost broken. It\nwas done, and the man was gone, and the thing was over. She had quite\nsufficient knowledge of the world to realise perfectly the difference\nbetween such a position as that which had been offered to her, and\nthe position which in all probability she would now be called upon to\nfill. She had had her chance, and Fortune had placed great things at\nher disposal. It must be said of her also that the great things which\nFortune had offered to her were treasures very valuable in her eyes.\nWhether it be right and wise to covet or to despise wealth and rank,\nthere was no doubt but that she coveted them. She had been instructed\nto believe in them, and she did believe in them. In some mysterious\nmanner of which she herself knew nothing, taught by some preceptor\nthe nobility of whose lessons she had not recognised though she had\naccepted them, she had learned other things also,--to revere truth\nand love, and to be ambitious as regarded herself of conferring the\ngift of her whole heart upon some one whom she could worship as a\nhero. She had spoken the simple truth when she had told her sister\nthat she had been willing to sell herself to the devil, but that\nshe had failed in her attempt to execute the contract. But now as\nshe lay weeping on her bed, tearing herself with remorse, picturing\nto herself in the most vivid colours all that she had thrown away,\ntelling herself of all that she might have done and all that she\nmight have been, had she not allowed the insane folly of a moment\nto get the better of her, she received little or no comfort from\nthe reflection that she had been true to her better instincts. She\nhad told the man that she had refused him because she loved Hugh\nStanbury;--at least, as far as she could remember what had passed,\nshe had so told him. And how mean it was of her to allow herself to\nbe actuated by an insane passion for a man who had never spoken to\nher of love, and how silly of her afterwards to confess it! Of what\nservice could such a passion be to her life? Even were it returned,\nshe could not marry such a one as Hugh Stanbury. She knew enough of\nherself to be quite sure that were he to ask her to do so to-morrow,\nshe would refuse him. Better go and be scorched, and bored to\ndeath, and buried at the Mandarins, than attempt to regulate a poor\nhousehold which, as soon as she made one of its number, would be on\nthe sure road to ruin!\n\nFor a moment there came upon her, not a thought, hardly an\nidea,--something of a waking dream that she would write to Mr.\nGlascock and withdraw all that she had said. Were she to do so he\nwould probably despise her, and tell her that he despised her;--but\nthere might be a chance. It was possible that such a declaration\nwould bring him back to her;--and did it not bring him back to her\nshe would only be where she was, a poor lost, shipwrecked creature,\nwho had flung herself upon the rocks and thrown away her only chance\nof a prosperous voyage across the ocean of life; her only chance, for\nshe was not like other girls, who at any rate remain on the scene\nof action, and may refit their spars and still win their way. For\nthere were to be no more seasons in London, no more living in Curzon\nStreet, no renewed power of entering the ball-rooms and crowded\nstaircases in which high-born wealthy lovers can be conquered. A\ngreat prospect had been given to her, and she had flung it aside!\nThat letter of retractation was, however, quite out of the question.\nThe reader must not suppose that she had ever thought that she could\nwrite it. She thought of nothing but of coming misery and remorse. In\nher wretchedness she fancied that she had absolutely disclosed to the\nman who loved her the name of him whom she had been mad enough to say\nthat she loved. But what did it matter? Let it be as it might, she\nwas destroyed.\n\nThe next morning she came down to breakfast pale as a ghost; and they\nwho saw her knew at once that she had done that which had made her a\nwretched woman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE STANBURY CORRESPONDENCE.\n\n\nHalf an hour after the proper time, when the others had finished\ntheir tea and bread and butter, Nora Rowley came down among them pale\nas a ghost. Her sister had gone to her while she was dressing, but\nshe had declared that she would prefer to be alone. She would be down\ndirectly, she had said, and had completed her toilet without even the\nassistance of her maid. She drank her cup of tea and pretended to eat\nher toast; and then sat herself down, very wretchedly, to think of\nit all again. It had been all within her grasp,--all of which she\nhad ever dreamed! And now it was gone! Each of her three companions\nstrove from time to time to draw her into conversation, but she\nseemed to be resolute in her refusal. At first, till her utter\nprostration had become a fact plainly recognised by them all, she\nmade some little attempt at an answer when a direct question was\nasked of her; but after a while she only shook her head, and was\nsilent, giving way to absolute despair.\n\nLate in the evening she went out into the garden, and Priscilla\nfollowed her. It was now the end of July, and the summer was in its\nglory. The ladies, during the day, would remain in the drawing-room\nwith the windows open and the blinds down, and would sit in the\nevening reading and working, or perhaps pretending to read and work,\nunder the shade of a cedar which stood upon the lawn. No retirement\ncould possibly be more secluded than was that of the garden of the\nClock House. No stranger could see into it, or hear sounds from out\nof it. Though it was not extensive, it was so well furnished with\nthose charming garden shrubs which, in congenial soils, become large\ntrees, that one party of wanderers might seem to be lost from another\namidst its walls. On this evening Mrs. Stanbury and Mrs. Trevelyan\nhad gone out as usual, but Priscilla had remained with Nora Rowley.\nAfter a while Nora also got up and went through the window all alone.\nPriscilla, having waited for a few minutes, followed her; and caught\nher in a long green walk that led round the bottom of the orchard.\n\n\"What makes you so wretched?\" she said.\n\n\"Why do you say I am wretched?\"\n\n\"Because it's so visible. How is one to go on living with you all day\nand not notice it?\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't notice it. I don't think it kind of you to\nnotice it. If I wanted to talk of it, I would say so.\"\n\n\"It is better generally to speak of a trouble than to keep it to\noneself,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"All the same, I would prefer not to speak of mine,\" said Nora.\n\nThen they parted, one going one way and one the other, and Priscilla\nwas certainly angry at the reception which had been given to the\nsympathy which she had proffered. The next day passed almost without\na word spoken between the two. Mrs. Stanbury had not ventured as yet\nto mention to her guest the subject of the rejected lover, and had\nnot even said much on the subject to Mrs. Trevelyan. Between the two\nsisters there had been, of course, some discussion on the matter. It\nwas impossible that it should be allowed to pass without it; but such\ndiscussions always resulted in an assertion on the part of Nora that\nshe would not be scolded. Mrs. Trevelyan was very tender with her,\nand made no attempt to scold her,--tried, at last, simply to console\nher; but Nora was so continually at work scolding herself, that every\nword spoken to her on the subject of Mr. Glascock's visit seemed to\nher to carry with it a rebuke.\n\nBut on the second day she herself accosted Priscilla Stanbury. \"Come\ninto the garden,\" she said, when they two were for a moment alone\ntogether; \"I want to speak to you.\" Priscilla, without answering,\nfolded up her work and put on her hat. \"Come down to the green walk,\"\nsaid Nora. \"I was savage to you last night, and I want to beg your\npardon.\"\n\n\"You were savage,\" said Priscilla, smiling, \"and you shall have my\npardon. Who would not pardon you any offence, if you asked it?\"\n\n\"I am so miserable!\" she said.\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I can't tell. And it is of no use talking about it\nnow, for it is all over. But I ought not to have been cross to you,\nand I am very sorry.\"\n\n\"That does not signify a straw; only so far, that when I have been\ncross, and have begged a person's pardon,--which I don't do as often\nas I ought,--I always feel that it begets kindness. If I could help\nyou in your trouble I would.\"\n\n\"You can't fetch him back again.\"\n\n\"You mean Mr. Glascock. Shall I go and try?\"\n\nNora smiled and shook her head. \"I wonder what he would say if you\nasked him. But if he came I should do the same thing.\"\n\n\"I do not in the least know what you have done, my dear. I only see\nthat you mope about, and are more down in the mouth than any one\nought to be, unless some great trouble has come.\"\n\n\"A great trouble has come.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have had your choice,--either to accept your lover or\nto reject him.\"\n\n\"No; I have not had my choice.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that no one has dictated to you; or, at least, that\nyou have obeyed no dictation.\"\n\n\"Of course, I can't explain it to you. It is impossible that I\nshould.\"\n\n\"If you mean that you regret what you have done because you have been\nfalse to the man, I can sympathise with you. No one has ever a right\nto be false, and if you are repenting a falsehood, I will willingly\nhelp you to eat your ashes and to wear your sackcloth. But if you are\nrepenting a truth--\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Then you must eat your ashes by yourself, for me; and I do not think\nthat you will ever be able to digest them.\"\n\n\"I do not want anybody to help me,\" said Nora proudly.\n\n\"Nobody can help you, if I understand the matter rightly. You have\ngot to get the better of your own covetousness and evil desires, and\nyou are in the fair way to get the better of them if you have already\nrefused to be this man's wife because you could not bring yourself to\ncommit the sin of marrying him when you did not love him. I suppose\nthat is about the truth of it; and indeed, indeed, I do sympathise\nwith you. If you have done that, though it is no more than the\nplainest duty, I will love you for it. One finds so few people that\nwill do any duty that taxes their self-indulgence.\"\n\n\"But he did not ask me to marry him.\"\n\n\"Then I do not understand anything about it.\"\n\n\"He asked me to love him.\"\n\n\"But he meant you to be his wife?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--he meant that of course.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\" asked Priscilla.\n\n\"That I didn't love him,\" replied Nora.\n\n\"And that was the truth?\"\n\n\"Yes;--it was the truth.\"\n\n\"And what do you regret?--that you didn't tell him a lie?\"\n\n\"No;--not that,\" said Nora slowly.\n\n\"What then? You cannot regret that you have not basely deceived a man\nwho has treated you with a loving generosity?\" They walked on silent\nfor a few yards, and then Priscilla repeated her question. \"You\ncannot mean that you are sorry that you did not persuade yourself to\ndo evil?\"\n\n\"I don't want to go back to the islands, and to lose myself there,\nand to be nobody;--that is what I mean. And I might have been so\nmuch! Could one step from the very highest rung of the ladder to the\nvery lowest and not feel it?\"\n\n\"But you have gone up the ladder,--if you only knew it,\" said\nPriscilla. \"There was a choice given to you between the foulest mire\nof the clay of the world, and the sun-light of the very God. You have\nchosen the sun-light, and you are crying after the clay! I cannot\npity you; but I can esteem you, and love you, and believe in you. And\nI do. You'll get yourself right at last, and there's my hand on it,\nif you'll take it.\" Nora took the hand that was offered to her, held\nit in her own for some seconds, and then walked back to the house and\nup to her own room in silence.\n\nThe post used to come into Nuncombe Putney at about eight in the\nmorning, carried thither by a wooden-legged man who rode a donkey.\nThere is a general understanding that the wooden-legged men in\ncountry parishes should be employed as postmen, owing to the great\nsteadiness of demeanour which a wooden leg is generally found to\nproduce. It may be that such men are slower in their operations than\nwould be biped postmen; but as all private employers of labour demand\nlabourers with two legs, it is well that the lame and halt should\nfind a refuge in the less exacting service of the government. The\none-legged man who rode his donkey into Nuncombe Putney would reach\nhis post-office not above half an hour after his proper time; but he\nwas very slow in stumping round the village, and seldom reached the\nClock House much before ten. On a certain morning two or three days\nafter the conversation just recorded it was past ten when he brought\ntwo letters to the door, one for Mrs. Trevelyan, and one for Mrs.\nStanbury. The ladies had finished their breakfast, and were seated\ntogether at an open window. As was usual, the letters were given into\nPriscilla's hands, and the newspaper which accompanied them into\nthose of Mrs. Trevelyan, its undoubted owner. When her letter was\nhanded to her, she looked at the address closely and then walked away\nwith it into her own room.\n\n\"I think it's from Louis,\" said Nora, as soon as the door was closed.\n\"If so, he is telling her to come back.\"\n\n\"Mamma, this is for you,\" said Priscilla. \"It is from Aunt Stanbury.\nI know her handwriting.\"\n\n\"From your aunt? What can she be writing about? There is something\nwrong with Dorothy.\" Mrs. Stanbury held the letter but did not open\nit. \"You had better read it, my dear. If she is ill, pray let her\ncome home.\"\n\nBut the letter spoke of nothing amiss as regarded Dorothy, and did\nnot indeed even mention Dorothy's name. Luckily Priscilla read\nthe letter in silence, for it was an angry letter. \"What is it,\nPriscilla? Why don't you tell me? Is anything wrong?\" said Mrs.\nStanbury.\n\n\"Nothing is wrong, mamma,--except that my aunt is a silly woman.\"\n\n\"Goodness me! what is it?\"\n\n\"It is a family matter,\" said Nora smiling, \"and I will go.\"\n\n\"What can it be?\" demanded Mrs. Stanbury again as soon as Nora had\nleft the room.\n\n\"You shall hear what it can be. I will read it you,\" said Priscilla.\n\"It seems to me that of all the women that ever lived my Aunt\nStanbury is the most prejudiced, the most unjust, and the most given\nto evil thinking of her neighbours. This is what she has thought fit\nto write to you, mamma.\" Then Priscilla read her aunt's letter, which\nwas as follows:--\n\n\n   The Close, Exeter, July 31, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SISTER STANBURY,\n\n   I am informed that the lady who is living with you because\n   she could not continue to live under the same roof with\n   her lawful husband, has received a visit at your house\n   from a gentleman who was named as her lover before she\n   left her own. I am given to understand that it was because\n   of this gentleman's visits to her in London, and because\n   she would not give up seeing him, that her husband would\n   not live with her any longer.\n\n\n\"But the man has never been here at all,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, in\ndismay.\n\n\"Of course he has not been here. But let me go on.\"\n\n\n   I have got nothing to do with your visitors, [continued\n   the letter] and I should not interfere but for the credit\n   of the family. There ought to be somebody to explain to\n   you that much of the abominable disgrace of the whole\n   proceeding will rest upon you, if you permit such goings\n   on in your house. I suppose it is your house. At any rate\n   you are regarded as the mistress of the establishment, and\n   it is for you to tell the lady that she must go elsewhere.\n   I do hope that you have done so, or at least that you\n   will do so now. It is intolerable that the widow of my\n   brother,--a clergyman,--should harbour a lady who is\n   separated from her husband and who receives visits from\n   a gentleman who is reputed to be her lover. I wonder\n   much that your eldest daughter should countenance such a\n   proceeding.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n\nMrs. Stanbury, when the letter had been read to her, held up both her\nhands in despair. \"Dear, dear,\" she exclaimed. \"Oh, dear!\"\n\n\"She had such pleasure in writing it,\" said Priscilla, \"that one\nought hardly to begrudge it her.\" The blackest spot in the character\nof Priscilla Stanbury was her hatred for her aunt in Exeter. She knew\nthat her aunt had high qualities, and yet she hated her aunt. She was\nwell aware that her aunt was regarded as a shining light by very many\ngood people in the county, and yet she hated her aunt. She could not\nbut acknowledge that her aunt had been generous to her brother, and\nwas now very generous to her sister, and yet she hated her aunt. It\nwas now a triumph to her that her aunt had fallen into so terrible\na quagmire, and she was by no means disposed to let the sinning old\nwoman easily out of it.\n\n\"It is as pretty a specimen,\" she said, \"as I ever knew of malice and\neaves-dropping combined.\"\n\n\"Don't use such hard words, my dear.\"\n\n\"Look at her words to us,\" said Priscilla. \"What business has she to\ntalk to you about the credit of the family and abominable disgrace?\nYou have held your head up in poverty, while she has been rolling in\nmoney.\"\n\n\"She has been very good to Hugh,--and now to Dorothy.\"\n\n\"If I were Dorothy I would have none of her goodness. She likes some\none to trample on,--some one of the name to patronise. She shan't\ntrample on you and me, mamma.\"\n\nThen there was a discussion as to what should be done; or rather\na discourse in which Priscilla explained what she thought fit to\ndo. Nothing, she decided, should be said to Mrs. Trevelyan on the\nsubject; but an answer should be sent to Aunt Stanbury. Priscilla\nherself would write this answer, and herself would sign it. There was\nsome difference of opinion on this point, as Mrs. Stanbury thought\nthat if she might be allowed to put her name to it, even though\nPriscilla should write it, the wording of it would be made, in some\ndegree, mild,--to suit her own character. But her daughter was\nimperative, and she gave way.\n\n\"It shall be mild enough in words,\" said Priscilla, \"and very short.\"\n\nThen she wrote her letter as follows:--\n\n\n   Nuncombe Putney, August 1, 186--.\n\n   DEAR AUNT STANBURY,\n\n   You have found a mare's nest. The gentleman you speak of\n   has never been here at all, and the people who bring you\n   news have probably hoaxed you. I don't think that mamma\n   has ever disgraced the family, and you can have no reason\n   for thinking that she ever will. You should, at any rate,\n   be sure of what you are saying before you make such cruel\n   accusations.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   PRISCILLA STANBURY.\n\n   P.S.--Another gentleman did call here,--not to see Mrs.\n   Trevelyan; but I suppose mamma's house need not be closed\n   against all visitors.\n\n\nPoor Dorothy had passed evil hours from the moment in which her\naunt had so far certified herself as to Colonel Osborne's visit to\nNuncombe as to make her feel it to be incumbent on her to interfere.\nAfter much consideration Miss Stanbury had told her niece the\ndreadful news, and had told also what she intended to do. Dorothy,\nwho was in truth horrified at the iniquity of the fact which was\nrelated, and who never dreamed of doubting the truth of her aunt's\ninformation, hardly knew how to interpose. \"I am sure mamma won't let\nthere be anything wrong,\" she had said.\n\n\"And you don't call this wrong?\" said Miss Stanbury, in a tone of\nindignation.\n\n\"But perhaps mamma will tell them to go.\"\n\n\"I hope she will. I hope she has. But he was allowed to be there\nfor hours. And now three days have passed and there is no sign of\nanything being done. He came and went and may come again when he\npleases.\" Still Dorothy pleaded. \"I shall do my duty,\" said Miss\nStanbury.\n\n\"I am quite sure mamma will do nothing wrong,\" said Dorothy. But the\nletter was written and sent, and the answer to the letter reached the\nhouse in the Close in due time.\n\nWhen Miss Stanbury had read and re-read the very short reply which\nher niece had written, she became at first pale with dismay, and\nthen red with renewed vigour and obstinacy. She had made herself, as\nshe thought, quite certain of her facts before she had acted on her\ninformation. There was some equivocation, some most unworthy deceit\nin Priscilla's letter. Or could it be possible that she herself had\nbeen mistaken? Another gentleman had been there;--not, however, with\nthe object of seeing Mrs. Trevelyan! So said Priscilla. But she had\nmade herself sure that the man in question was a man from London,\na middle-aged man from London, who had specially asked for Mrs.\nTrevelyan, and who had at once been known to Mrs. Clegg, at the\nLessboro' inn, to be Mrs. Trevelyan's lover. Miss Stanbury was\nvery unhappy, and at last sent for Giles Hickbody. Giles Hickbody\nhad never pretended to know the name. He had seen the man and had\ndescribed him, \"Quite a swell, ma'am; and a Lon'oner, and one as'd\nbe up to anything; but not a young 'un; no, not just a young 'un,\nzartainly.\" He was cross-examined again now, and said that all he\nknew about the man's name was that there was a handle to it. This was\nended by Miss Stanbury sending him down to Lessboro' to learn the\nvery name of the gentleman, and by his coming back with that of the\nHonourable George Glascock written on a piece of paper. \"They says\nnow as he was arter the other young 'ooman,\" said Giles Hickbody.\nThen was the confusion of Miss Stanbury complete.\n\nIt was late when Giles returned from Lessboro', and nothing could\nbe done that night. It was too late to write a letter for the\nnext morning's post. Miss Stanbury, who was as proud of her own\ndiscrimination as she was just and true, felt that a day of\nhumiliation had indeed come for her. She hated Priscilla almost as\nvigorously as Priscilla hated her. To Priscilla she would not write\nto own her fault; but it was incumbent on her to confess it to Mrs.\nStanbury. It was incumbent on her also to confess it to Dorothy. All\nthat night she did not sleep, and the next morning she went about\nabashed, wretched, hardly mistress of her own maids. She must confess\nit also to Martha, and Martha would be very stern to her. Martha had\npooh-poohed the whole story of the lover, seeming to think that there\ncould be no reasonable objection to a lover past fifty.\n\n\"Dorothy,\" she said at last, about noon, \"I have been over\nhasty about your mother and this man. I am sorry for it, and\nmust--beg--everybody's--pardon.\"\n\n\"I knew mamma would do nothing wrong,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"To do wrong is human, and she, I suppose, is not more free than\nothers; but in this matter I was misinformed. I shall write and beg\nher pardon; and now I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"Not mine, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Yes, yours and your mother's, and the lady's also,--for against her\nhas the fault been most grievous. I shall write to your mother and\nexpress my contrition.\" She put off the evil hour of writing as long\nas she could, but before dinner the painful letter had been written,\nand carried by herself to the post. It was as follows:--\n\n\n   The Close, August 3, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SISTER STANBURY,\n\n   I have now learned that the information was false on which\n   my former letter was based. I am heartily sorry for any\n   annoyance I may have given you. I can only inform you\n   that my intentions were good and upright. Nevertheless, I\n   humbly beg your pardon.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n\nMrs. Stanbury, when she received this, was inclined to let the matter\ndrop. That her sister-in-law should express such abject contrition\nwas to her such a lowering of the great ones of the earth, that the\napology conveyed to her more pain than pleasure. She could not hinder\nherself from sympathising with all that her sister-in-law had felt\nwhen she had found herself called upon to humiliate herself. But\nit was not so with Priscilla. Mrs. Stanbury did not observe that\nher daughter's name was scrupulously avoided in the apology; but\nPriscilla observed it. She would not let the matter drop, without\nan attempt at the last word. She therefore wrote back again as\nfollows;--\n\n\n   Nuncombe Putney, August 4, 186--.\n\n   DEAR AUNT STANBURY,\n\n   I am glad you have satisfied yourself about the gentleman\n   who has so much disquieted you. I do not know that the\n   whole affair would be worth a moment's consideration, were\n   it not that mamma and I, living as we do so secluded a\n   life, are peculiarly apt to feel any attack upon our good\n   name,--which is pretty nearly all that is left to us. If\n   ever there were women who should be free from attack,\n   at any rate from those of their own family, we are such\n   women. We never interfere with you, or with anybody; and I\n   think you might abstain from harassing us by accusations.\n\n   Pray do not write to mamma in such a strain again, unless\n   you are quite sure of your ground.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   PRISCILLA STANBURY.\n\n\n\"Impudent!\" said Miss Stanbury to Martha, when she had read the\nletter. \"Ill-conditioned, impudent vixen!\"\n\n\"She was provoked, miss,\" said Martha.\n\n\"Well; yes; yes;--and I suppose it is right that you should tell me\nof it. I dare say it is part of what I ought to bear for being an old\nfool, and too cautious about my own flesh and blood. I will bear it.\nThere. I was wrong, and I will say that I have been justly punished.\nThere,--there!\"\n\nHow very much would Miss Stanbury's tone have been changed had\nshe known that at that very moment Colonel Osborne was eating his\nbreakfast at Mrs. Crocket's inn, in Nuncombe Putney!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nBOZZLE, THE EX-POLICEMAN.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nWhen Mr. Trevelyan had gone through the miserable task of breaking up\nhis establishment in Curzon Street, and had seen all his furniture\npacked, including his books, his pictures, and his pet Italian\nornaments, it was necessary that he should go and live somewhere. He\nwas very wretched at this time,--so wretched that life was a burden\nto him. He was a man who loved his wife;--to whom his child was very\ndear; and he was one too to whom the ordinary comforts of domestic\nlife were attractive and necessary. There are men to whom release\nfrom the constraint imposed by family ties will be, at any rate for\na time, felt as a release. But he was not such a man. There was no\ndelight to him in being able to dine at his club, and being free to\ngo whither he pleased in the evening. As it was, it pleased him to\ngo no whither in the evenings; and his mornings were equally blank\nto him. He went so often to Mr. Bideawhile, that the poor old lawyer\nbecame quite tired of the Trevelyan family quarrel. Even Lady\nMilborough, with all her power of sympathising, began to feel that\nshe would almost prefer on any morning that her dear young friend,\nLouis Trevelyan, should not be announced. Nevertheless, she always\nsaw him when he came, and administered comfort according to her\nlight. Of course he would have his wife back before long. That was\nthe only consolation she was able to offer; and she offered it so\noften that he began gradually to feel that something might be done\ntowards bringing about so desirable an event. After what had occurred\nthey could not live again in Curzon Street,--nor even in London for\nawhile; but Naples was open to them. Lady Milborough said so much to\nhim of the advantages which always came in such circumstances from\ngoing to Naples, that he began to regard such a trip as almost the\nnatural conclusion of his adventure. But then there came that very\ndifficult question;--what step should be first taken? Lady Milborough\nproposed that he should go boldly down to Nuncombe Putney, and make\nthe arrangement. \"She will only be too glad to jump into your arms,\"\nsaid Lady Milborough. Trevelyan thought that if he went to Nuncombe\nPutney, his wife might perhaps jump into his arms; but what would\ncome after that? How would he stand then in reference to his\nauthority? Would she own that she had been wrong? Would she promise\nto behave better in future? He did not believe that she was yet\nsufficiently broken in spirit to make any such promise. And he told\nhimself again and again that it would be absurd in him to allow her\nto return to him without such subjection, after all that he had gone\nthrough in defence of his marital rights. If he were to write to her\na long letter, argumentative, affectionate, exhaustive, it might be\nbetter. He was inclined to believe of himself that he was good at\nwriting long, affectionate, argumentative, and exhaustive letters.\nBut he would not do even this as yet. He had broken up his house, and\nscattered all his domestic gods to the winds, because she had behaved\nbadly to him; and the thing done was too important to allow of\nredress being found so easily.\n\nSo he lived on a wretched life in London. He could hardly endure to\nshow himself at his club, fearing that every one would be talking of\nhim as the man who was separated from his wife,--perhaps as the man\nof whose wife Colonel Osborne was the dear friend. No doubt for a day\nor two there had been much of such conversation; but it had died away\nfrom the club long before his consciousness had become callous. At\nfirst he had gone into a lodging in Mayfair; but this had been but\nfor a day or two. After that he had taken a set of furnished chambers\nin Lincoln's Inn, immediately under those in which Stanbury lived;\nand thus it came to pass that he and Stanbury were very much thrown\ntogether. As Trevelyan would always talk of his wife this was rather\na bore; but our friend bore with it, and would even continue to\ninstruct the world through the columns of the D. R. while Trevelyan\nwas descanting on the peculiar cruelty of his own position.\n\n\"I wish to be just, and even generous; and I do love her with all my\nheart,\" he said one afternoon, when Hugh was very hard at work.\n\n\"'It is all very well for gentlemen to call themselves reformers,'\"\nHugh was writing, \"'but have these gentlemen ever realised to\nthemselves the meaning of that word? We think that they have never\ndone so as long as--' Of course you love her,\" said Hugh, with his\neyes still on the paper, still leaning on his pen, but finding by the\ncessation of sound that Trevelyan had paused, and therefore knowing\nthat it was necessary that he should speak.\n\n\"As much as ever,\" said Trevelyan, with energy.\n\n\"'As long as they follow such a leader, in such a cause, into\nwhichever lobby he may choose to take them--' Exactly so,--exactly,\"\nsaid Stanbury; \"just as much as ever.\"\n\n\"You are not listening to a word,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"I haven't missed a single expression you have used,\" said Stanbury.\n\"But a fellow has to do two things at a time when he's on the daily\npress.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon for interrupting you,\" said Trevelyan, angrily,\ngetting up, taking his hat, and stalking off to the house of Lady\nMilborough. In this way he became rather a bore to his friends. He\ncould not divest his mind of the injury which had accrued to him from\nhis wife's conduct, nor could he help talking of the grief with which\nhis mind was laden. And he was troubled with sore suspicions, which,\nas far as they concerned his wife, had certainly not been merited. It\nhad seemed to him that she had persisted in her intimacy with Colonel\nOsborne in a manner that was not compatible with that wife-like\nindifference which he regarded as her duty. Why had she written to\nhim and received letters from him when her husband had plainly told\nher that any such communication was objectionable? She had done\nso, and as far as Trevelyan could remember her words, had plainly\ndeclared that she would continue to do so. He had sent her away into\nthe most remote retirement he could find for her; but the post was\nopen to her. He had heard much of Mrs. Stanbury, and of Priscilla,\nfrom his friend Hugh, and thoroughly believed that his wife was in\nrespectable hands. But what was to prevent Colonel Osborne from\ngoing after her, if he chose to do so? And if he did so choose,\nMrs. Stanbury could not prevent their meeting. He was racked with\njealousy, and yet he did not cease to declare to himself that he knew\nhis wife too well to believe that she would sin. He could not rid\nhimself of his jealousy, but he tried with all his might to make the\nman whom he hated the object of it, rather than the woman whom he\nloved.\n\nHe hated Colonel Osborne with all his heart. It was a regret to him\nthat the days of duelling were over, so that he could not shoot the\nman. And yet, had duelling been possible to him, Colonel Osborne had\ndone nothing that would have justified him in calling his enemy out,\nor would even have enabled him to do so with any chance of inducing\nhis enemy to fight. Circumstances, he thought, were cruel to him\nbeyond compare, in that he should have been made to suffer so great\ntorment without having any of the satisfaction of revenge. Even Lady\nMilborough, with all her horror as to the Colonel, could not tell\nhim that the Colonel was amenable to any punishment. He was advised\nthat he must take his wife away and live at Naples because of this\nman,--that he must banish himself entirely if he chose to repossess\nhimself of his wife and child;--and yet nothing could be done to\nthe unprincipled rascal by whom all his wrongs and sufferings were\noccasioned! Thinking it very possible that Colonel Osborne would\nfollow his wife, he had a watch set upon the Colonel. He had found a\nretired policeman,--a most discreet man, as he was assured,--who, for\na consideration, undertook the management of interesting jobs of this\nkind. The man was one Bozzle, who had not lived without a certain\nreputation in the police courts. In these days of his madness,\ntherefore, he took Mr. Bozzle into his pay; and after a while he got\na letter from Bozzle with the Exeter post-mark. Colonel Osborne had\nleft London with a ticket for Lessboro'. Bozzle also had taken a\nplace by the same train for that small town. The letter was written\nin the railway carriage, and, as Bozzle explained, would be posted by\nhim as he passed through Exeter. A further communication should be\nmade by the next day's post, in a letter which Mr. Bozzle proposed to\naddress to Z. A., Post-office, Waterloo Place.\n\nOn receiving this first letter, Trevelyan was in an agony of\ndoubt, as well as misery. What should he do? Should he go to Lady\nMilborough, or to Stanbury; or should he at once follow Colonel\nOsborne and Mr. Bozzle to Lessboro'? It ended in his resolving at\nlast to wait for the letter which was to be addressed to Z. A. But he\nspent an interval of horrible suspense, and of insane rage. Let the\nlaws say what they might, he would have the man's blood, if he found\nthat the man had even attempted to wrong him. Then, at last, the\nsecond letter reached him. Colonel Osborne and Mr. Bozzle had each of\nthem spent the day in the neighbourhood of Lessboro', not exactly in\neach other's company, but very near to each other. \"The Colonel\" had\nordered a gig, on the day after his arrival at Lessboro', for the\nvillage of Cockchaffington; and, for all Mr. Bozzle knew, the Colonel\nhad gone to Cockchaffington. Mr. Bozzle was ultimately inclined\nto think that the Colonel had really spent his day in going to\nCockchaffington. Mr. Bozzle himself, knowing the wiles of such\nmen as Colonel Osborne, and thinking at first that that journey\nto Cockchaffington might only be a deep ruse, had walked over to\nNuncombe Putney. There he had had a pint of beer and some bread and\ncheese at Mrs. Crocket's house, and had asked various questions, to\nwhich he did not receive very satisfactory answers. But he inspected\nthe Clock House very minutely, and came to a decided opinion as to\nthe point at which it would be attacked, if burglary were the object\nof the assailants. And he observed the iron gates, and the steps,\nand the shape of the trees, and the old pigeon-house-looking fabric\nin which the clock used to be placed. There was no knowing when\ninformation might be wanted, or what information might not be of use.\nBut he made himself tolerably sure that Colonel Osborne did not visit\nNuncombe Putney on that day; and then he walked back to Lessboro'.\nHaving done this, he applied himself to the little memorandum book in\nwhich he kept the records of these interesting duties, and entered a\nclaim against his employer for a conveyance to Nuncombe Putney and\nback, including driver and ostler; and then he wrote his letter.\nAfter that he had a hot supper, with three glasses of brandy and\nwater, and went to bed with a thorough conviction that he had earned\nhis bread on that day.\n\nThe letter to Z. A. did not give all these particulars, but it\ndid explain that Colonel Osborne had gone off, apparently, to\nCockchaffington, and that he,--Bozzle,--had himself visited Nuncombe\nPutney. \"The hawk hasn't been nigh the dovecot as yet,\" said Mr.\nBozzle in his letter, meaning to be both mysterious and facetious.\n\nIt would be difficult to say whether the wit or the mystery disgusted\nTrevelyan the most. He had felt that he was defiling himself with\ndirt when he first went to Mr. Bozzle. He knew that he was having\nrecourse to means that were base and low,--which could not be other\nthan base or low, let the circumstances be what they might. But Mr.\nBozzle's conversation had not been quite so bad as Mr. Bozzle's\nletters; as it may have been that Mr. Bozzle's successful activity\nwas more insupportable than his futile attempts. But, nevertheless,\nsomething must be done. It could not be that Colonel Osborne should\nhave gone down to the close neighbourhood of Nuncombe Putney without\nthe intention of seeing the lady whom his obtrusive pertinacity had\ndriven to that seclusion. It was terrible to Trevelyan that Colonel\nOsborne should be there, and not the less terrible because such a one\nas Mr. Bozzle was watching the Colonel on his behalf. Should he go to\nNuncombe Putney himself? And if so, when he got to Nuncombe Putney\nwhat should he do there? At last, in his suspense and his grief, he\nresolved that he would tell the whole to Hugh Stanbury.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" said Hugh, \"that you have put a policeman on his\ntrack?\"\n\n\"The man was a policeman once.\"\n\n\"What we call a private detective. I can't say I think you were\nright.\"\n\n\"But you see that it was necessary,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"I can't say that it was necessary. To speak out, I can't understand\nthat a wife should be worth watching who requires watching.\"\n\n\"Is a man to do nothing then? And even now it is not my wife whom I\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"As for Colonel Osborne, if he chooses to go to Lessboro', why\nshouldn't he? Nothing that you can do, or that Bozzle can do, can\nprevent him. He has a perfect right to go to Lessboro'.\"\n\n\"But he has not a right to go to my wife.\"\n\n\"And if your wife refuses to see him; or having seen him,--for a man\nmay force his way in anywhere with a little trouble,--if she sends\nhim away with a flea in his ear, as I believe she would--\"\n\n\"She is so frightfully indiscreet.\"\n\n\"I don't see what Bozzle can do.\"\n\n\"He has found out at any rate that Osborne is there,\" said Trevelyan.\n\"I am not more fond of dealing with such fellows than you are\nyourself. But I think it is my duty to know what is going on. What\nought I to do now?\"\n\n\"I should do nothing,--except dismiss Bozzle.\"\n\n\"You know that that is nonsense, Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Whatever I did I should dismiss Bozzle.\" Stanbury was now quite in\nearnest, and, as he repeated his suggestion for the dismissal of the\npoliceman, pushed his writing things away from him. \"If you ask my\nopinion, you know, I must tell you what I think. I should get rid of\nBozzle as a beginning. If you will only think of it, how can your\nwife come back to you if she learns that you have set a detective to\nwatch her?\"\n\n\"But I haven't set the man to watch her.\"\n\n\"Colonel Osborne is nothing to you, except as he is concerned with\nher. This man is now down in her neighbourhood; and, if she learns\nthat, how can she help feeling it as a deep insult? Of course the man\nwatches her as a cat watches a mouse.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do? I can't write to the man and tell him to come\naway. Osborne is down there, and I must do something. Will you go\ndown to Nuncombe Putney yourself, and let me know the truth?\"\n\nAfter much debating of the subject, Hugh Stanbury said that he would\nhimself go down to Nuncombe Putney alone. There were difficulties\nabout the D. R.; but he would go to the office of the newspaper and\novercome them. How far the presence of Nora Rowley at his mother's\nhouse may have assisted in bringing him to undertake the journey,\nperhaps need not be accurately stated. He acknowledged to himself\nthat the claims of friendship were strong upon him; and that as he\nhad loudly disapproved of the Bozzle arrangement, he ought to lend a\nhand to some other scheme of action. Moreover, having professed his\nconviction that no improper visiting could possibly take place under\nhis mother's roof, he felt bound to shew that he was not afraid to\ntrust to that conviction himself. He declared that he would be ready\nto proceed to Nuncombe Putney to-morrow;--but only on condition that\nhe might have plenary power to dismiss Bozzle.\n\n\"There can be no reason why you should take any notice of the man,\"\nsaid Trevelyan.\n\n\"How can I help noticing him when I find him prowling about the\nplace? Of course I shall know who he is.\"\n\n\"I don't see that you need know anything about him.\"\n\n\"My dear Trevelyan, you cannot have two ambassadors engaged in\nthe same service without communication with each other. And any\ncommunication with Mr. Bozzle, except that of sending him back to\nLondon, I will not have.\" The controversy was ended by the writing of\na letter from Trevelyan to Bozzle, which was confided to Stanbury, in\nwhich the ex-policeman was thanked for his activity and requested to\nreturn to London for the present. \"As we are now aware that Colonel\nOsborne is in the neighbourhood,\" said the letter, \"my friend Mr.\nStanbury will know what to do.\"\n\nAs soon as this was settled, Stanbury went to the office of the D. R.\nand made arrangement as to his work for three days. Jones could do\nthe article on the Irish Church upon a pinch like this, although he\nhad not given much study to the subject as yet; and Puddlethwaite,\nwho was great in City matters, would try his hand on the present\nstate of society in Rome, a subject on which it was essential that\nthe D. R. should express itself at once. Having settled these little\ntroubles Stanbury returned to his friend, and in the evening they\ndined together at a tavern.\n\n\"And now, Trevelyan, let me know fairly what it is that you wish,\"\nsaid Stanbury.\n\n\"I wish to have my wife back again.\"\n\n\"Simply that. If she will agree to come back, you will make no\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"No; not quite simply that. I shall desire that she shall be guided\nby my wishes as to any intimacies she may form.\"\n\n\"That is all very well; but is she to give any undertaking? Do you\nintend to exact any promise from her? It is my opinion that she will\nbe willing enough to come back, and that when she is with you there\nwill be no further cause for quarrelling. But I don't think she will\nbind herself by any exacted promise; and certainly not through a\nthird person.\"\n\n\"Then say nothing about it. Let her write a letter to me proposing to\ncome,--and she shall come.\"\n\n\"Very well. So far I understand. And now what about Colonel Osborne?\nYou don't want me to quarrel with him I suppose?\"\n\n\"I should like to keep that for myself,\" said Trevelyan, grimly.\n\n\"If you will take my advice you will not trouble yourself about him,\"\nsaid Stanbury. \"But as far as I am concerned, I am not to meddle or\nmake with him? Of course,\" continued Stanbury, after a pause, \"if I\nfind that he is intruding himself in my mother's house, I shall tell\nhim that he must not come there.\"\n\n\"But if you find him installed in your mother's house as a\nvisitor,--how then?\"\n\n\"I do not regard that as possible.\"\n\n\"I don't mean living there,\" said Trevelyan, \"but coming backwards\nand forwards;--going on in habits of intimacy with,--with--?\" His\nvoice trembled so as he asked these questions, that he could not\npronounce the word which was to complete them.\n\n\"With Mrs. Trevelyan, you mean.\"\n\n\"Yes; with my wife. I don't say that it is so; but it may be so. You\nwill be bound to tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"I will certainly tell you the truth.\"\n\n\"And the whole truth.\"\n\n\"Yes; the whole truth.\"\n\n\"Should it be so I will never see her again,--never. And as for\nhim;--but never mind.\" Then there was another short period of\nsilence, during which Stanbury smoked his pipe and sipped his whisky\ntoddy. \"You must see,\" continued Trevelyan, \"that it is absolutely\nnecessary that I should do something. It is all very well for you to\nsay that you do not like detectives. Neither do I like them. But what\nwas I to do? When you condemn me you hardly realise the difficulties\nof my position.\"\n\n\"It is the deuce of a nuisance certainly,\" said Stanbury, through the\ncloud of smoke,--thinking now not at all of Mrs. Trevelyan, but of\nMrs. Trevelyan's sister.\n\n\"It makes a man almost feel that he had better not marry at all,\"\nsaid Trevelyan.\n\n\"I don't see that. Of course there may come troubles. The tiles may\nfall on your head, you know, as you walk through the streets. As far\nas I can see, women go straight enough nineteen times out of twenty.\nBut they don't like being,--what I call looked after.\"\n\n\"And did I look after my wife more than I ought?\"\n\n\"I don't mean that; but if I were married,--which I never shall be,\nfor I shall never attain to the respectability of a fixed income,--I\nfancy I shouldn't look after my wife at all. It seems to me that\nwomen hate to be told about their duties.\"\n\n\"But if you saw your wife, quite innocently, falling into an improper\nintimacy,--taking up with people she ought not to know,--doing that\nin ignorance, which could not but compromise yourself;--wouldn't you\nspeak a word then?\"\n\n\"Oh! I might just say, in an off-hand way, that Jones was a rascal,\nor a liar, or a fool, or anything of that sort. But I would never\ncaution her against Jones. By George, I believe a woman can stand\nanything better than that.\"\n\n\"You have never tried it, my friend.\"\n\n\"And I don't suppose I ever shall. As for me, I believe Aunt Stanbury\nwas right when she said that I was a radical vagabond. I dare say I\nshall never try the thing myself, and therefore it's very easy to\nhave a theory. But I must be off. Good night, old fellow. I'll do the\nbest I can; and, at any rate, I'll let you know the truth.\"\n\nThere had been a question during the day as to whether Stanbury\nshould let his sister know by letter that he was expected; but it had\nbeen decided that he should appear at Nuncombe without any previous\nnotification of his arrival. Trevelyan had thought that this was very\nnecessary, and when Stanbury had urged that such a measure seemed\nto imply suspicion, he had declared that in no other way could the\ntruth be obtained. He, Trevelyan, simply wanted to know the facts\nas they were occurring. It was a fact that Colonel Osborne was down\nin the neighbourhood of Nuncombe Putney. That, at least, had been\nascertained. It might very possibly be the case that he would be\nrefused admittance to the Clock House,--that all the ladies there\nwould combine to keep him out. But,--so Trevelyan urged,--the truth\non this point was desired. It was essentially necessary to his\nhappiness that he should know what was being done.\n\n\"Your mother and sister,\" said he, \"cannot be afraid of your coming\nsuddenly among them.\"\n\nStanbury, so urged, had found it necessary to yield, but yet he had\nfelt that he himself was almost acting like a detective policeman, in\npurposely falling down upon them without a word of announcement. Had\nchance circumstances made it necessary that he should go in such a\nmanner he would have thought nothing of it. It would simply have been\na pleasant joke to him.\n\nAs he went down by the train on the following day, he almost felt\nashamed of the part which he had been called upon to perform.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nSHEWING HOW COLONEL OSBORNE WENT TO COCKCHAFFINGTON.\n\n\nTogether with Miss Stanbury's first letter to her sister-in-law a\nletter had also been delivered to Mrs. Trevelyan. Nora Rowley, as her\nsister had left the room with this in her hand, had expressed her\nopinion that it had come from Trevelyan; but it had in truth been\nwritten by Colonel Osborne. And when that second letter from Miss\nStanbury had been received at the Clock House,--that in which she in\nplain terms begged pardon for the accusation conveyed in her first\nletter,--Colonel Osborne had started on his deceitful little journey\nto Cockchaffington, and Mr. Bozzle, the ex-policeman who had him in\nhand, had already asked his way to Nuncombe Putney.\n\nWhen Colonel Osborne learned that Louis Trevelyan had broken up his\nestablishment in Curzon Street, and had sent his wife away into a\nbarbarous retirement in Dartmoor,--for such was the nature of the\ninformation on the subject which was spread among Trevelyan's friends\nin London;--and when he was made aware also that all this was done\non his account,--because he was so closely intimate with Trevelyan's\nwife, and because Trevelyan's wife was, and persisted in continuing\nto be, so closely intimate with him,--his vanity was gratified.\nAlthough it might be true,--and no doubt was true,--that he said much\nto his friends and to himself of the deep sorrow which he felt that\nsuch a trouble should befall his old friend and his old friend's\ndaughter; nevertheless, as he curled his grey whiskers before the\nglass, and made the most of such remnant of hair as was left on\nthe top of his head, as he looked to the padding of his coat, and\ncompleted a study of the wrinkles beneath his eyes, so that in\nconversation they might be as little apparent as possible, he felt\nmore of pleasure than of pain in regard to the whole affair. It was\nvery sad that it should be so, but it was human. Had it been in his\npower to set the whole matter right by a word, he would probably have\nspoken that word; but as this was not possible, as Trevelyan had in\nhis opinion made a gross fool of himself, as Emily Trevelyan was\nvery nice, and not the less nice in that she certainly was fond\nof himself, as great tyranny had been used towards her, and as he\nhimself had still the plea of old family friendship to protect his\nconscience,--to protect his conscience unless he went so far as to\nmake that plea an additional sting to his conscience,--he thought\nthat, as a man, he must follow up the matter. Here was a young, and\nfashionable, and very pretty woman banished to the wilds of Dartmoor\nfor his sake. And, as far as he could understand, she would not have\nbeen so banished had she consented to say that she would give up\nher acquaintance with him. In such circumstances as these was it\npossible that he should do nothing? Various ideas ran through his\nhead. He began to think that if Trevelyan were out of the way, he\nmight,--might perhaps be almost tempted to make this woman his wife.\nShe was so nice that he almost thought that he might be rash enough\nfor that, although he knew well the satisfaction of being a bachelor;\nbut as the thought suggested itself to him, he was well aware that\nhe was thinking of a thing quite distant from him. The reader is not\nto suppose that Colonel Osborne meditated any making-away with the\nhusband. Our Colonel was certainly not the man for a murder. Nor did\nhe even think of running away with his friend's daughter. Though he\ntold himself that he could dispose of his wrinkles satisfactorily,\nstill he knew himself and his powers sufficiently to be aware that\nhe was no longer fit to be the hero of such a romance as that. He\nacknowledged to himself that there was much labour to be gone through\nin running away with another man's wife; and that the results, in\nrespect to personal comfort, are not always happy. But what if Mrs.\nTrevelyan were to divorce herself from her husband on the score of\nher husband's cruelty? Various horrors were related as to the man's\ntreatment of his wife. By some it was said that she was in the prison\non Dartmoor,--or, if not actually in the prison, an arrangement which\nthe prison discipline might perhaps make difficult,--that she was in\nthe custody of one of the prison warders who possessed a prim cottage\nand a grim wife, just outside the prison walls. Colonel Osborne did\nnot himself believe even so much as this, but he did believe that\nMrs. Trevelyan had been banished to some inhospitable region, to some\ndreary comfortless abode, of which, as the wife of a man of fortune,\nshe would have great ground to complain. So thinking, he did not\nprobably declare to himself that a divorce should be obtained,\nand that, in such event, he would marry the lady,--but ideas came\nacross his mind in that direction. Trevelyan was a cruel Bluebeard;\nEmily,--as he was studious to call Mrs. Trevelyan,--was a dear\ninjured saint. And as for himself, though he acknowledged to himself\nthat the lumbago pinched him now and again, so that he could not rise\nfrom his chair with all the alacrity of youth, yet, when he walked\nalong Pall Mall with his coat properly buttoned, he could not but\nobserve that a great many young women looked at him with admiring\neyes.\n\nIt was thus with no settled scheme that the Colonel went to work,\nand made inquiries, and ascertained Mrs. Trevelyan's address in\nDevonshire. When he learned it, he thought that he had done much;\nthough, in truth, there had been no secrecy in the matter. Scores\nof people knew Mrs. Trevelyan's address besides the newsvendor who\nsupplied her paper, from whose boy Colonel Osborne's servant obtained\nthe information. But when the information had been obtained, it was\nexpedient that it should be used; and therefore Colonel Osborne wrote\nthe following letter:--\n\n\n   Acrobats Club, July 31, 186--.\n\n   DEAR EMILY,\n\n\nTwice the Colonel wrote Dearest Emily, and twice he tore the sheet on\nwhich the words were written. He longed to be ardent, but still it\nwas so necessary to be prudent! He was not quite sure of the lady.\nWomen sometimes tell their husbands, even when they have quarrelled\nwith them. And, although ardent expressions in writing to pretty\nwomen are pleasant to male writers, it is not pleasant for a\ngentleman to be asked what on earth he means by that sort of thing at\nhis time of life. The Colonel gave half an hour to the consideration,\nand then began the letter, Dear Emily. If prudence be the soul\nof valour, may it not be considered also the very mainspring, or,\nperhaps, the pivot of love?\n\n\n   DEAR EMILY,\n\n   I need hardly tell you with what dismay I have heard of\n   all that has taken place in Curzon Street. I fear that you\n   must have suffered much, and that you are suffering now.\n   It is an inexpressible relief to me to hear that you have\n   your child with you, and Nora. But, nevertheless, to\n   have your home taken away from you, to be sent out of\n   London, to be banished from all society! And for what?\n   The manner in which the minds of some men work is quite\n   incomprehensible.\n\n   As for myself, I feel that I have lost the company of\n   a friend, whom indeed I can very ill spare. I have a\n   thousand things to say to you, and among them one or\n   two which I feel that I must say,--that I ought to say.\n   As it happens, an old schoolfellow of mine is Vicar of\n   Cockchaffington, a village which I find by the map is\n   very near to Nuncombe Putney. I saw him in town last\n   spring, and he then asked me to pay him a visit. There is\n   something in his church which people go to see, and though\n   I don't understand churches much, I shall go and see it.\n   I shall run down on Wednesday, and shall sleep at the inn\n   at Lessboro'. I see that Lessboro' is a market town, and\n   I suppose there is an inn. I shall go over to my friend on\n   the Thursday, but shall return to Lessboro'. Though a man\n   be ever so eager to see a church door-way, he need not\n   sleep at the parsonage. On the following day, I will get\n   over to Nuncombe Putney, and I hope that you will see me.\n   Considering my long friendship with you, and my great\n   attachment to your father and mother, I do not think\n   that the strictest martinet would tell you that you need\n   hesitate in the matter.\n\n   I have seen Mr. Trevelyan twice at the club, but he has\n   not spoken to me. Under such circumstances I could not of\n   course speak to him. Indeed, I may say that my feelings\n   towards him just at present are of such a nature as\n   to preclude me from doing so with any appearance of\n   cordiality.\n\n   Dear Emily,\n   Believe me now, as always, your affectionate friend,\n\n   FREDERIC OSBORNE.\n\n\nWhen he read that letter over to himself a second time he felt quite\nsure that he had not committed himself. Even if his friend were to\nsend the letter to her husband, it could not do him any harm. He was\naware that he might have dilated more on the old friendship between\nhimself and Sir Marmaduke, but he experienced a certain distaste to\nthe mention of things appertaining to years long past. It did not\nquite suit him in his present frame of mind to speak of his regard in\nthose quasi-paternal terms which he would have used had it satisfied\nhim to represent himself simply as her father's friend. His language\ntherefore had been a little doubtful, so that the lady might, if\nshe were so minded, look upon him in that tender light in which her\nhusband had certainly chosen to regard him.\n\nWhen the letter was handed to Mrs. Trevelyan, she at once took it\nwith her up to her own room, so that she might be alone when she read\nit. The handwriting was quite familiar to her, and she did not choose\nthat even her sister should see it. She had told herself twenty times\nover that, while living at Nuncombe Putney, she was not living under\nthe guardianship of Mrs. Stanbury. She would consent to live under\nthe guardianship of no one, as her husband did not choose to remain\nwith her and protect her. She had done no wrong, and she would submit\nto no other authority, than that of her legal lord and master. Nor,\naccording to her views of her own position, was it in his power to\ndepute that authority to others. He had caused the separation, and\nnow she must be the sole judge of her own actions. In itself, a\ncorrespondence between her and her father's old friend was in no\ndegree criminal or even faulty. There was no reason, moral, social,\nor religious, why an old man, over fifty, who had known her all her\nlife, should not write to her. But yet she could not say aloud before\nMrs. Stanbury, and Priscilla, and her sister, that she had received a\nletter from Colonel Osborne. She felt that the colour had come to her\ncheek, and that she could not even walk out of the room as though the\nletter had been a matter of indifference to her.\n\nAnd would it have been a matter of indifference had there been nobody\nthere to see her? Mrs. Trevelyan was certainly not in love with\nColonel Osborne. She was not more so now than she had been when her\nfather's friend, purposely dressed for the occasion, had kissed her\nin the vestry of the church in which she was married, and had given\nher a blessing, which was then intended to be semi-paternal,--as from\nan old man to a young woman. She was not in love with him,--never\nwould be, never could be in love with him. Reader, you may believe\nin her so far as that. But where is the woman, who, when she is\nneglected, thrown over, and suspected by the man that she loves, will\nnot feel the desire of some sympathy, some solicitude, some show of\nregard from another man? This woman's life, too, had not hitherto\nbeen of such a nature that the tranquillity of the Clock House at\nNuncombe Putney afforded to her all that she desired. She had been\nthere now a month, and was almost sick from the want of excitement.\nAnd she was full of wrath against her husband. Why had he sent her\nthere to break her heart in a disgraceful retirement, when she had\nnever wronged him? From morning to night she had no employment, no\namusement, nothing to satisfy her cravings. Why was she to be doomed\nto such an existence? She had declared that as long as she could\nhave her boy with her, she would be happy. She was allowed to have\nher boy; but she was anything but happy. When she received Colonel\nOsborne's letter,--while she held it in her hand still unopened, she\nnever for a moment thought that that could make her happy. But there\nwas in it something of excitement. And she painted the man to herself\nin brighter colours now than she had ever given to him in her former\nportraits. He cared for her. He was gracious to her. He appreciated\nher talents, her beauty, and her conduct. He knew that she deserved\na treatment very different from that accorded to her by her husband.\nWhy should she reject the sympathy of her father's oldest friend,\nbecause her husband was madly jealous about an old man? Her husband\nhad chosen to send her away, and to leave her, so that she must act\non her own judgment. Acting on her own judgment, she read Colonel\nOsborne's letter from first to last. She knew that he was wrong to\nspeak of coming to Nuncombe Putney; but yet she thought that she\nwould see him. She had a dim perception that she was standing on the\nedge of a precipice, on broken ground which might fall under her\nwithout a moment's warning, and yet she would not retreat from the\ndanger. Though Colonel Osborne was wrong, very wrong in coming to see\nher, yet she liked him for coming. Though she would be half afraid\nto tell her news to Mrs. Stanbury, and more than half afraid to tell\nPriscilla, yet she liked the excitement of the fear. Nora would scold\nher; but Nora's scolding she thought she could answer. And then it\nwas not the fact that Colonel Osborne was coming down to Devonshire\nto see her. He was coming as far as Lessboro' to see his friend at\nCockchaffington. And when at Lessboro', was it likely that he should\nleave the neighbourhood without seeing the daughter of his old ally?\nAnd why should he do so? Was he to be unnatural in his conduct,\nuncivil and unfriendly, because Mr. Trevelyan had been foolish,\nsuspicious, and insane?\n\nSo arguing with herself, she answered Colonel Osborne's letter before\nshe had spoken on the subject to any one in the house,--and this was\nher answer:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR COLONEL OSBORNE,\n\n   I must leave it to your own judgment to decide whether you\n   will come to Nuncombe Putney or not. There are reasons\n   which would seem to make it expedient that you should stay\n   away,--even though circumstances are bringing you into\n   the immediate neighbourhood. But of these reasons I will\n   leave you to be the judge. I will never let it be said\n   that I myself have had cause to dread the visit of any old\n   friend. Nevertheless, if you stay away, I shall understand\n   why you do so.\n\n   Personally, I shall be glad to see you,--as I have always\n   been. It seems odd to me that I cannot write in warmer\n   tones to my father's and mother's oldest friend. Of\n   course, you will understand that though I shall readily\n   see you if you call, I cannot ask you to stay. In the\n   first place, I am not now living in my own house. I am\n   staying with Mrs. Stanbury, and the place is called the\n   Clock House.\n\n   Yours very sincerely,\n\n   EMILY TREVELYAN.\n\n   The Clock House, Nuncombe Putney, Monday.\n\n\nSoon after she had written it, Nora came into her room, and at once\nasked concerning the letter which she had seen delivered to her\nsister that morning.\n\n\"It was from Colonel Osborne,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"From Colonel Osborne! How very wrong!\"\n\n\"I don't see that it is wrong at all. Because Louis is foolish and\nmad, that cannot make another man wrong for doing the most ordinary\nthing in the world.\"\n\n\"I had hoped it had been from Louis,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Oh dear, no. He is by no means so considerate. I do not suppose I\nshall hear from him, till he chooses to give some fresh order about\nmyself or my child. He will hardly trouble himself to write to me,\nunless he takes up some new freak to show me that he is my master.\"\n\n\"And what does Colonel Osborne say?\"\n\n\"He is coming here.\"\n\n\"Coming here?\" almost shouted Nora.\n\n\"Yes; absolutely here. Does it sound to you as if Lucifer himself\nwere about to show his face? The fact is, he happens to have a friend\nin the neighbourhood whom he has long promised to visit; and as he\nmust be at Lessboro', he does not choose to go away without the\ncompliment of a call. It will be as much to you as to me.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see him in the least,\" said Nora.\n\n\"There is his letter. As you seem to be so suspicious, you had better\nread it.\"\n\nThen Nora read it.\n\n\"And there is a copy of my answer,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"I shall\nkeep both, because I know so well what ill-natured things people will\nsay.\"\n\n\"Dear Emily, do not send it,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Indeed I shall. I will not be frightened by bugbears. And I will\nnot be driven to confess to any man on earth that I am afraid to see\nhim. Why should I be afraid of Colonel Osborne? I will not submit to\nacknowledge that there can be any danger in Colonel Osborne. Were\nI to do so I should be repeating the insult against myself. If my\nhusband wished to guide me in such matters, why did he not stay with\nme?\"\n\nThen she went out into the village and posted the letter. Nora\nmeanwhile was thinking whether she would call in the assistance of\nPriscilla Stanbury; but she did not like to take any such a step in\nopposition to her sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nSHEWING HOW COLONEL OSBORNE WENT TO NUNCOMBE PUTNEY.\n\n\nColonel Osborne was expected at Nuncombe Putney on the Friday, and\nit was Thursday evening before either Mrs. Stanbury or Priscilla was\ntold of his coming. Emily had argued the matter with Nora, declaring\nthat she would make the communication herself, and that she would\nmake it when she pleased and how she pleased. \"If Mrs. Stanbury\nthinks,\" said she, \"that I am going to be treated as a prisoner, or\nthat I will not judge myself as to whom I may see, or whom I may not\nsee, she is very much mistaken.\" Nora felt that were she to give\ninformation to those ladies in opposition to her sister's wishes,\nshe would express suspicion on her own part by doing so; and she was\nsilent. On that same Thursday Priscilla had written her last defiant\nletter to her aunt,--that letter in which she had cautioned her aunt\nto make no further accusations without being sure of her facts. To\nPriscilla's imagination that coming of Lucifer in person, of which\nMrs. Trevelyan had spoken, would hardly have been worse than the\ncoming of Colonel Osborne. When, therefore, Mrs. Trevelyan declared\nthe fact on the Thursday evening, vainly endeavouring to speak of\nthe threatened visit in an ordinary voice, and as of an ordinary\ncircumstance, it was as though a thunderbolt had fallen upon them.\n\n\"Colonel Osborne coming here!\" said Priscilla, mindful of the\nStanbury correspondence,--mindful of the evil tongues of the world.\n\n\"And why not?\" demanded Mrs. Trevelyan, who had heard nothing of the\nStanbury correspondence.\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear!\" ejaculated Mrs. Stanbury, who, of course, was\naware of all that had passed between the Clock House and the house in\nthe Close, though the letters had been written by her daughter.\n\nNora was determined to stand up for her sister, whatever might be the\ncircumstances of the case. \"I wish Colonel Osborne were not coming,\"\nsaid she, \"because it makes a foolish fuss; but I cannot understand\nhow anybody can suppose it to be wrong that Emily should see papa's\nvery oldest friend in the world.\"\n\n\"But why is he coming?\" demanded Priscilla.\n\n\"Because he wants to see an acquaintance at Cockchaffington,\" said\nMrs. Trevelyan; \"and there is a wonderful church-door there.\"\n\n\"A church-fiddlestick!\" said Priscilla.\n\nThe matter was debated throughout all the evening. At one time\nthere was a great quarrel between the ladies, and then there was a\nreconciliation. The point on which Mrs. Trevelyan stood with the\ngreatest firmness was this,--that it did not become her, as a married\nwoman whose conduct had always been good and who was more careful as\nto that than she was even of her name, to be ashamed to meet any man.\n\"Why should I not see Colonel Osborne, or Colonel anybody else who\nmight call here with the same justification for calling which his old\nfriendship gives him?\" Priscilla endeavoured to explain to her that\nher husband's known wishes ought to hinder her from doing so. \"My\nhusband should have remained with me to express his wishes,\" Mrs.\nTrevelyan replied.\n\nNeither could Mrs. Stanbury nor could Priscilla bring herself to say\nthat the man should not be admitted into the house. In the course of\nthe debate, in the heat of her anger, Mrs. Trevelyan declared that\nwere any such threat held out to her, she would leave the house and\nsee Colonel Osborne in the street, or at the inn.\n\n\"No, Emily; no,\" said Nora.\n\n\"But I will. I will not submit to be treated as a guilty woman, or as\na prisoner. They may say what they like; but I won't be shut up.\"\n\n\"No one has tried to shut you up,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"You are afraid of that old woman at Exeter,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan;\nfor by this time the facts of the Stanbury correspondence had\nall been elicited in general conversation; \"and yet you know how\nuncharitable and malicious she is.\"\n\n\"We are not afraid of her,\" said Priscilla. \"We are afraid of nothing\nbut of doing wrong.\"\n\n\"And will it be wrong to let an old gentleman come into the house,\"\nsaid Nora, \"who is nearly sixty, and who has known us ever since we\nwere born?\"\n\n\"If he is nearly sixty, Priscilla,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, \"that does\nseem to make a difference.\" Mrs. Stanbury herself was only just\nsixty, and she felt herself to be quite an old woman.\n\n\"They may be devils at eighty,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Colonel Osborne is not a devil at all,\" said Nora.\n\n\"But mamma is so foolish,\" said Priscilla. \"The man's age does not\nmatter in the least.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, very humbly.\n\nAt that time the quarrel was raging, but afterwards came the\nreconciliation. Had it not been for the Stanbury correspondence the\nfact of Colonel Osborne's threatened visit would have been admitted\nas a thing necessary--as a disagreeable necessity; but how was\nthe visit to be admitted and passed over in the teeth of that\ncorrespondence? Priscilla felt very keenly the peculiar cruelty\nof her position. Of course Aunt Stanbury would hear of the visit.\nIndeed, any secrecy in the matter was not compatible with Priscilla's\nideas of honesty. Her aunt had apologised humbly for having said\nthat Colonel Osborne had been at Nuncombe. That apology, doubtless,\nhad been due. Colonel Osborne had not been at Nuncombe when the\naccusation had been made, and the accusation had been unjust and\nfalse. But his coming had been spoken of by Priscilla in her own\nletters as an occurrence which was quite out of the question. Her\nanger against her aunt had been for saying that the man had come,\nnot for objecting to such a visit. And now the man was coming, and\nAunt Stanbury would know all about it. How great, how terrible, how\ncrushing would be Aunt Stanbury's triumph!\n\n\"I must write and tell her,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"I am sure I shall not object,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"And Hugh must be told,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"You may tell all the world, if you like,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nIn this way it was settled among them that Colonel Osborne was to\nbe received. On the next morning, Friday morning, Colonel Osborne,\ndoubtless having heard something of Mrs. Crocket from his friend\nat Cockchaffington, was up early, and had himself driven over to\nNuncombe Putney before breakfast. The ever-watchful Bozzle was, of\ncourse, at his heels,--or rather, not at his heels on the first two\nmiles of the journey; for Bozzle, with painful zeal, had made himself\naware of all the facts, and had started on the Nuncombe Putney road\nhalf an hour before the Colonel's fly was in motion. And when the\nfly passed him he was lying discreetly hidden behind an old oak. The\ndriver, however, had caught a glimpse of him as he was topping a\nhill, and having seen him about on the previous day, and perceiving\nthat he was dressed in a decent coat and trousers, and that,\nnevertheless, he was not a gentleman, began to suspect that he\nwas--somebody. There was a great deal said afterwards about Bozzle in\nMrs. Clegg's yard at Lessboro'; but the Lessboro' mind was never able\nto satisfy itself altogether respecting Bozzle and his mission. As\nto Colonel Osborne and his mission, the Lessboro' mind did satisfy\nitself with much certainty. The horse was hardly taken from out of\nColonel Osborne's fly in Mrs. Crocket's yard when Bozzle stepped\ninto the village by a path which he had already discovered, and soon\nbusied himself among the tombs in the churchyard. Now, one corner of\nthe churchyard was immediately opposite to the iron gate leading into\nthe Clock House. \"Drat 'un,\" said the wooden-legged postman, still\nsitting on his donkey, to Mrs. Crocket's ostler, \"if there be'ant the\nchap as was here yesterday when I was a starting, and I zeed 'un in\nLezbro' street thick very morning.\" \"He be'ant arter no good, that\n'un,\" said the ostler. After that a close watch was kept upon the\nwatcher.\n\n\n   [Illustration: The wooden-legged postman of Nuncombe Putney.]\n\n\nIn the meantime, Colonel Osborne had ordered his breakfast at the\nStag and Antlers, and had asked questions as to the position of the\nClock House. He was altogether ignorant of Mr. Bozzle, although Mr.\nBozzle had been on his track now for two days and two nights. He had\ndetermined, as he came on to Nuncombe Putney, that he would not be\nshame-faced about his visit to Mrs. Trevelyan. It is possible that\nhe was not so keen in the matter as he had been when he planned his\njourney in London; and, it may be, that he really tried to make\nhimself believe that he had come all the way to the confines of\nDartmoor to see the porch of Cockchaffington Church. The session\nin London was over, and it was necessary for such a man as Colonel\nOsborne that he should do something with himself before he went down\nto the Scotch grouse. He had long desired to see something of the\nmost picturesque county in England; and now, as he sat eating his\nbreakfast in Mrs. Crocket's parlour, he almost looked upon his dear\nEmily as a subsidiary attraction. \"Oh, that's the Clock House,\"\nhe said to Mrs. Crocket. \"No, I have not the pleasure of knowing\nMrs. Stanbury; very respectable lady, so I have heard; widow of a\nclergyman; ah, yes; son up in London; I know him;--always writing\nbooks is he? Very clever, I dare say. But there's a lady,--indeed two\nladies,--whom I do know. Mrs. Trevelyan is there, I think,--and Miss\nRowley.\"\n\n\"You be'ant Muster Trevelyan, be you?\" said Mrs. Crocket, looking at\nhim very hard.\n\n\"No, I'm not Mr. Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"Nor yet 'the Colonel' they doo be talking about?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I am a colonel. I don't know why anybody should talk\nabout me. I'll just step out now, however, and see my friends.\"\n\n\"It's madam's lover,\" said Mrs. Crocket to herself, \"as sure as eggs\nis eggs.\" As she said so, Colonel Osborne boldly walked across the\nvillage and pulled the bell at the iron gate, while Bozzle, crouching\namong the tombs, saw the handle in his hand. \"There he is,\" said\nPriscilla. Everybody in the Clock House had known that the fly,\nwhich they had seen, had brought \"the Colonel\" into Nuncombe Putney.\nEverybody had known that he had breakfasted at the Stag and Antlers.\nAnd everybody now knew that he was at the gate ringing the bell.\n\"Into the drawing-room,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, with a fearful,\ntremulous whisper, to the girl who went across the little garden\nin front to open the iron gate. The girl felt as though Apollyon\nwere there, and as though she were called upon to admit Apollyon.\nMrs. Stanbury having uttered her whisper, hurried away up-stairs.\nPriscilla held her ground in the parlour, determined to be near the\nscene of action if there might be need. And it must be acknowledged\nthat she peeped from behind the curtain, anxious to catch a glimpse\nof the terrible man, whose coming to Nuncombe Putney she regarded as\nso severe a misfortune.\n\nThe plan of the campaign had all been arranged. Mrs. Trevelyan and\nNora together received Colonel Osborne in the drawing-room. It was\nunderstood that Nora was to remain there during the whole visit. \"It\nis horrible to think that such a precaution should be necessary,\"\nMrs. Trevelyan had said, \"but perhaps it may be best. There is no\nknowing what the malice of people may not invent.\"\n\n\"My dear girls,\" said the Colonel, \"I am delighted to see you,\" and\nhe gave a hand to each.\n\n\"We are not very cheerful here,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, \"as you may\nimagine.\"\n\n\"But the scenery is beautiful,\" said Nora, \"and the people we are\nliving with are kind and nice.\"\n\n\"I am very glad of that,\" said the Colonel. Then there was a pause,\nand it seemed, for a moment or two, that none of them knew how to\nbegin a general conversation. Colonel Osborne was quite sure, by this\ntime, that he had come down to Devonshire with the express object of\nseeing the door of the church at Cockchaffington, and Mrs. Trevelyan\nwas beginning to think that he certainly had not come to see her.\n\"Have you heard from your father since you have been here?\" asked the\nColonel.\n\nThen there was an explanation about Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley.\nMr. Trevelyan's name was not mentioned; but Mrs. Trevelyan stated\nthat she had explained to her mother all the painful circumstances of\nher present life. Sir Marmaduke, as Colonel Osborne was aware, was\nexpected to be in England in the spring, and Lady Rowley would, of\ncourse, come with him. Nora thought that they might probably now come\nbefore that time; but Mrs. Trevelyan declared that it was out of the\nquestion that they should do so. She was sure that her father could\nnot leave the islands except when he did so in obedience to official\norders. The expense of doing so would be ruinous to him. And what\ngood would he do? In this way there was a great deal of family\nconversation, in which Colonel Osborne was able to take a part; but\nnot a word was said about Mr. Trevelyan.\n\nNor did \"the Colonel\" find an opportunity of expressing a spark of\nthat sentiment, for the purpose of expressing which he had made\nthis journey to Devonshire. It is not pleasant to make love in the\npresence of a third person, even when that love is all fair and above\nboard; but it is quite impracticable to do so to a married lady, when\nthat married lady's sister is present. No more futile visit than\nthis of Colonel Osborne's to the Clock House was ever made. And yet,\nthough not a word was spoken to which Mr. Trevelyan himself could\nhave taken the slightest exception, the visit, futile as it was,\ncould not but do an enormous deal of harm. Mrs. Crocket had already\nguessed that the fine gentleman down from London was the lover of the\nmarried lady at the Clock House, who was separated from her husband.\nThe wooden-legged postman and the ostler were not long in connecting\nthe man among the tombstones with the visitor to the house.\nTrevelyan, as we are aware, already knew that Colonel Osborne was in\nthe neighbourhood. And poor Priscilla Stanbury was now exposed to the\nterrible necessity of owning the truth to her aunt. \"The Colonel,\"\nwhen he had sat an hour with his young friends, took his leave; and,\nas he walked back to Mrs. Crocket's, and ordered that his fly might\nbe got ready for him, his mind was heavy with the disagreeable\nfeeling that he had made an ass of himself. The whole affair had\nbeen a failure; and though he might be able to pass off the porch at\nCockchaffington among his friends, he could not but be aware himself\nthat he had spent his time, his trouble, and his money for nothing.\nHe became aware, as he returned to Lessboro', that had he intended to\nmake any pleasant use whatever of his position in reference to Mrs.\nTrevelyan, the tone of his letter and his whole mode of proceeding\nshould have been less patriarchal. And he should have contrived a\nmeeting without the presence of Nora Rowley.\n\nAs soon as he had left them, Mrs. Trevelyan went to her own room, and\nNora at once rejoined Priscilla.\n\n\"Is he gone?\" asked Priscilla.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--he has gone.\"\n\n\"What would I have given that he had never come!\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Nora, \"what harm has he done? I wish he had not come,\nbecause, of course, people will talk! But nothing was more natural\nthan that he should come over to see us when he was so near us.\"\n\n\"Nora!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You don't believe all that? In the neighbourhood! I believe he came\non purpose to see your sister, and I think that it was a dastardly\nand most ungentleman-like thing to do.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure you are wrong, then,--altogether wrong,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Very well. We must have our own opinions. I am glad you can be so\ncharitable. But he should not have come here,--to this house, even\nthough imperative business had brought him into the very village.\nBut men in their vanity never think of the injury they may do to a\nwoman's name. Now I must go and write to my aunt. I am not going to\nhave it said hereafter that I deceived her. And then I shall write to\nHugh. Oh dear; oh dear!\"\n\n\"I am afraid we are a great trouble to you.\"\n\n\"I will not deceive you, because I like you. This is a great trouble\nto me. I have meant to be so prudent, and with all my prudence I have\nnot been able to keep clear of rocks. And I have been so indignant\nwith Aunt Stanbury! Now I must go and eat humble-pie.\"\n\nThen she eat humble-pie,--after the following fashion:--\n\n\n   DEAR AUNT STANBURY,\n\n   After what has passed between us, I think it right to tell\n   you that Colonel Osborne has been at Nuncombe Putney, and\n   that he called at the Clock House this morning. We did not\n   see him. But Mrs. Trevelyan and Miss Rowley, together, did\n   see him. He remained here perhaps an hour.\n\n   I should not have thought it necessary to mention this to\n   you, the matter being one in which you are not concerned,\n   were it not for our former correspondence. When I last\n   wrote, I had no idea that he was coming,--nor had mamma.\n   And when you first wrote, he was not even expected by\n   Mrs. Trevelyan. The man you wrote about was another\n   gentleman;--as I told you before. All this is most\n   disagreeable and tiresome;--and would be quite\n   nonsensical, but that circumstances seem to make it\n   necessary.\n\n   As for Colonel Osborne, I wish he had not been here; but\n   his coming would do no harm,--only that it will be talked\n   about.\n\n   I think you will understand how it is that I feel myself\n   constrained to write to you. I do hope that you will spare\n   mamma, who is disturbed and harassed when she gets angry\n   letters. If you have anything to say to myself, I don't\n   mind it.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   PRISCILLA STANBURY.\n\n   The Clock House, Friday, August 5.\n\n\nShe wrote also to her brother Hugh; but Hugh himself reached Nuncombe\nPutney before the letter reached him.\n\nMr. Bozzle watched the Colonel out of the house, and watched him\nout of the village. When the Colonel was fairly started, Mr. Bozzle\nwalked back to Lessboro'.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nSHEWING HOW MISS STANBURY BEHAVED TO HER TWO NIECES.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe triumph of Miss Stanbury when she received her niece's letter was\ncertainly very great,--so great that in its first flush she could not\nrestrain herself from exhibiting it to Dorothy. \"Well,--well,--what\ndo you think, Dolly?\"\n\n\"About what, aunt? I don't know who the letter is from.\"\n\n\"Nobody writes to me now so constant as your sister Priscilla. The\nletter is from Priscilla. Colonel Osborne has been at the Clock\nHouse, after all. I knew that he would be there. I knew it! I knew\nit!\"\n\nDorothy, when she heard this, was dumbfounded. She had rested her\ndefence of her mother and sister on the impossibility of any such\nvisit being admitted. According to her lights the coming of Colonel\nOsborne, after all that had been said, would be like the coming of\nLucifer himself. The Colonel was, to her imagination, a horrible\nroaring lion. She had no idea that the erratic manoeuvres of such\na beast might be milder and more innocent than the wooing of any\nturtle-dove. She would have asked whether the roaring lion had gone\naway again, and, if so, whether he had taken his prey with him,\nwere it not that she was too much frightened at the moment to ask\nany question. That her mother and sister should have been wilfully\nconcerned in such iniquity was quite incredible to her, but yet she\ndid not know how to defend them. \"But are you quite sure of it, Aunt\nStanbury? May there not be another mistake?\"\n\n\"No mistake this time, I think, my dear. Any way, Priscilla says that\nhe is there.\" Now in this there was a mistake. Priscilla had said\nnothing of the kind.\n\n\"You don't mean that he is staying at the Clock House, Aunt\nStanbury?\"\n\n\"I don't know where he is now. I'm not his keeper. And, I'm glad to\nsay, I'm not the lady's keeper either. Ah, me! It's a bad business.\nYou can't touch pitch and not be defiled, my dear. If your mother\nwanted the Clock House, I would sooner have taken it for her myself\nthan that all this should have happened,--for the family's sake.\"\n\nBut Miss Stanbury, when she was alone, and when she had read her\nniece's three letters again and again, began to understand something\nof Priscilla's honesty, and began also to perceive that there might\nhave been a great difficulty respecting the Colonel, for which\nneither her niece nor her sister-in-law could fairly be held to\nbe responsible. It was perhaps the plainest characteristic of all\nthe Stanburys that they were never wilfully dishonest. Ignorant,\nprejudiced, and passionate they might be. In her anger Miss Stanbury,\nof Exeter, could be almost malicious; and her niece at Nuncombe\nPutney was very like her aunt. Each could say most cruel things, most\nunjust things, when actuated by a mistaken consciousness of perfect\nright on her own side. But neither of them could lie,--even by\nsilence. Let an error be brought home to either of them,--so as to\nbe acknowledged at home,--and the error would be assuredly confessed\naloud. And, indeed, with differences in the shades, Hugh and Dorothy\nwere of the same nature. They were possessed of sweeter tempers than\ntheir aunt and sister, but they were filled with the same eager\nreadiness to believe themselves to be right,--and to own themselves\nto others to be wrong, when they had been constrained to make such\nconfession to themselves. The chances of life, and something probably\nof inner nature, had made Dorothy mild and obedient; whereas, in\nregard to Hugh, the circumstances of his life and disposition had\nmade him obstinate and self-reliant. But in all was to be found the\nsame belief in self,--which amounted almost to conceit,--the same\nwarmth of affection, and the same love of justice.\n\nWhen Miss Stanbury had again perused the correspondence, and had come\nto see, dimly, how things had gone at Nuncombe Putney,--when the\nconviction came upon her mind that Priscilla had entertained a horror\nas to the coming of this Colonel equal to that which she herself\nhad felt,--when her imagination painted to her all that her niece\nhad suffered, her heart was softened somewhat. She had declared to\nDorothy that pitch, if touched, would certainly defile; and she had,\nat first, intended to send the same opinion, couched in very forcible\nwords, to her correspondents at the Clock House. They should not\ncontinue to go astray for want of being told that they were going\nastray. It must be acknowledged, too, that there was a certain\namount of ignoble wrath in the bosom of Miss Stanbury because her\nsister-in-law had taken the Clock House. She had never been told, and\nhad not even condescended to ask Dorothy, whether the house was taken\nand paid for by her nephew on behalf of his mother, or whether it\nwas paid for by Mr. Trevelyan on behalf of his wife. In the latter\ncase, Mrs. Stanbury would, she thought, be little more than an\nupper servant, or keeper,--as she expressed it to herself. Such an\narrangement appeared to her to be quite disgraceful in a Stanbury;\nbut yet she believed that such must be the existing arrangement, as\nshe could not bring herself to conceive that Hugh Stanbury could keep\nsuch an establishment over his mother's head out of money earned by\nwriting for a penny newspaper. There would be a triumph of democracy\nin this which would vanquish her altogether. She had, therefore, been\nanxious enough to trample on Priscilla and upon all the affairs of\nthe Clock House; but yet she had been unable to ignore the nobility\nof Priscilla's truth, and having acknowledged it to herself she found\nherself compelled to acknowledge it aloud. She sat down to think in\nsilence, and it was not till she had fortified herself by her first\ndraught of beer, and till she had finished her first portion of bread\nand cheese, that she spoke. \"I have written to your sister herself,\nthis time,\" she said. \"I don't know that I ever wrote a line to her\nbefore in my life.\"\n\n\"Poor Priscilla!\" Dorothy did not mean to be severe on her aunt,\neither in regard to the letters which had not been written, or to the\none letter which now had been written. But Dorothy pitied her sister,\nwhom she felt to be in trouble.\n\n\"Well; I don't know about her being so poor. Priscilla, I'll be\nbound, thinks as well of herself as any of us do.\"\n\n\"She'd cut her fingers off before she'd mean to do wrong,\" said\nDorothy.\n\n\"But what does that come to? What's the good of that? It isn't\nmeaning to do right that will save us. For aught I know, the Radicals\nmay mean to do right. Mr. Beales means to do right--perhaps.\"\n\n\"But, aunt,--if everybody did the best they could?\"\n\n\"Tush, my dear! you are getting beyond your depth. There are such\nthings still, thank God! as spiritual pastors and masters. Entrust\nyourself to them. Do what they think right.\" Now if aught were known\nin Exeter of Miss Stanbury, this was known,--that if any clergyman\nvolunteered to give to her, unasked and uninvited, counsel, either\nghostly or bodily, that clergyman would be sent from her presence\nwith a wigging which he would not soon forget. The thing had been\ntried more than once, and the wigging had been complete. There was no\nmore attentive listener in church than Miss Stanbury; and she would,\nnow and again, appeal to a clergyman on some knotty point. But for\nthe ordinary authority of spiritual pastors and masters she shewed\nmore of abstract reverence than of practical obedience.\n\n\"I'm sure Priscilla does the best she can,\" said Dorothy, going back\nto the old subject.\n\n\"Ah,--well,--yes. What I want to say about Priscilla is this. It is a\nthousand pities she is so obstinate, so pig-headed, so certain that\nshe can manage everything for herself better than anybody else can\nfor her.\" Miss Stanbury was striving to say something good of her\nniece, but found the task to be difficult and distasteful to her.\n\n\"She has managed for mamma ever so many years; and since she took it\nwe have hardly ever been in debt,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"She'll do all that, I don't doubt. I don't suppose she cares much\nfor ribbons and false hair for herself.\"\n\n\"Who? Priscilla! The idea of Priscilla with false hair!\"\n\n\"I dare say not;--I dare say not. I do not think she'd spend her\nmother's money on things of that kind.\"\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury, you don't know her.\"\n\n\"Ah; very well. Perhaps I don't. But, come, my dear, you are very\nhard upon me, and very anxious to take your sister's part. And\nwhat is it all about? I've just written to her as civil a letter\nas one woman ever wrote to another. And if I had chosen, I could\nhave,--could have,--h--m--m.\" Miss Stanbury, as she hesitated for\nwords in which to complete her sentence, revelled in the strength of\nthe vituperation which she could have poured upon her niece's head,\nhad she chosen to write her last letter about Colonel Osborne in her\nsevere strain.\n\n\"If you have written kindly to her, I am so much obliged to you,\"\nsaid Dorothy.\n\n\"The truth is, Priscilla has meant to be right. Meaning won't go\nfor much when the account is taken, unless the meaning comes from a\nproper source. But the poor girl has done as well as she has known\nhow. I believe it is Hugh's fault more than anybody else's.\" This\naccusation was not pleasant to Dorothy, but she was too intent just\nnow on Priscilla's case to defend her brother. \"That man never ought\nto have been there; and that woman never ought to have been there.\nThere cannot be a doubt about that. If Priscilla were sitting there\nopposite to me, she would own as much. I am sure she would.\" Miss\nStanbury was quite right if she meant to assert that Priscilla had\nowned as much to herself. \"And because I think so, I am willing to\nforgive her part in the matter. To me, personally, she has always\nbeen rude,--most uncourteous,--and,--and,--and unlike a younger woman\nto an older one, and an aunt, and all that. I suppose it is because\nshe hates me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Aunt Stanbury!\"\n\n\"My dear, I suppose it is. Why else should she treat me in such a\nway? But I do believe of her that she would rather eat an honest, dry\ncrust, than dishonest cake and ale.\"\n\n\"She would rather starve than pick up a crumb that was dishonest,\"\nsaid Dorothy, fairly bursting out into tears.\n\n\"I believe it. I do believe it. There; what more can I say? Clock\nHouse, indeed! What matter what house you live in, so that you can\npay the rent of it honestly?\"\n\n\"But the rent is paid--honestly,\" said Dorothy, amidst her sobs.\n\n\"It's paid, I don't doubt. I dare say the woman's husband and your\nbrother see to that among them. Oh, that my boy, Hugh, as he used\nto be, should have brought us all to this! But there's no knowing\nwhat they won't do among them. Reform, indeed! Murder, sacrilege,\nadultery, treason, atheism;--that's what Reform means; besides every\nkind of nastiness under the sun.\" In which latter category Miss\nStanbury intended especially to include bad printer's ink, and paper\nmade of straw.\n\nThe reader may as well see the letter which was as civil a letter\nas ever one woman wrote to another, so that the collection of the\nStanbury correspondence may be made perfect.\n\n\n   The Close, August 6, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR NIECE,\n\n   Your letter has not astonished me nearly as much as you\n   expected it would. I am an older woman than you, and,\n   though you will not believe it, I have seen more of the\n   world. I knew that the gentleman would come after the\n   lady. Such gentlemen always do go after their ladies.\n   As for yourself, I can see all that you have done, and\n   pretty nearly hear all that you have said, as plain as a\n   pike-staff. I do you the credit of believing that the plan\n   is none of your making. I know who made the plan, and a\n   very bad plan it is.\n\n   As to my former letters and the other man, I understand\n   all about it. You were very angry that I should accuse you\n   of having this man at the house; and you were right to be\n   angry. I respect you for having been angry. But what does\n   all that say as to his coming,--now that he has come?\n\n   If you will consent to take an old woman's advice, get rid\n   of the whole boiling of them. I say it in firm love and\n   friendship, for I am,--\n\n   Your affectionate aunt,\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n\nThe special vaunted courtesy of this letter consisted, no doubt, in\nthe expression of respect which it contained, and in that declaration\nof affection with which it terminated. The epithet was one which\nMiss Stanbury would by no means use promiscuously in writing to her\nnearest relatives. She had not intended to use it when she commenced\nher letter to Priscilla. But the respect of which she had spoken\nhad glowed, and had warmed itself into something of temporary love;\nand feeling at the moment that she was an affectionate aunt, Miss\nStanbury had so put herself down in her letter. Having done such a\ndeed she felt that Dorothy, though Dorothy knew nothing about it,\nought in her gratitude to listen patiently to anything that she might\nnow choose to say against Priscilla.\n\nBut Dorothy was in truth very miserable, and in her misery wrote a\nlong letter that afternoon to her mother,--which, however, it will\nnot be necessary to place entire among the Stanbury records,--begging\nthat she might be informed as to the true circumstances of the case.\nShe did not say a word of censure in regard either to her mother or\nsister; but she expressed an opinion in the mildest words which she\ncould use, that if anything had happened which had compromised their\nnames since their residence at the Clock House, she, Dorothy, had\nbetter go home and join them. The meaning of which was that it would\nnot become her to remain in the house in the Close, if the house in\nthe Close would be disgraced by her presence. Poor Dorothy had taught\nherself to think that the iniquity of roaring lions spread itself\nvery widely.\n\nIn the afternoon she made some such proposition to her aunt in\nambiguous terms. \"Go home!\" said Miss Stanbury. \"Now?\"\n\n\"If you think it best, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"And put yourself in the middle of all this iniquity and abomination!\nI don't suppose you want to know the woman?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\"Or the man?\"\n\n\"Oh, Aunt Stanbury!\"\n\n\"It's my belief that no decent gentleman in Exeter would look at you\nagain if you were to go and live among them at Nuncombe Putney while\nall this is going on. No, no. Let one of you be saved out of it, at\nleast.\"\n\nAunt Stanbury had more than once made use of expressions which\nbrought the faintest touch of gentle pink up to her niece's cheeks.\nWe must do Dorothy the justice of saying that she had never dreamed\nof being looked at by any gentleman, whether decent or indecent. Her\nlife at Nuncombe Putney had been of such a nature, that though she\nknew that other girls were looked at, and even made love to, and that\nthey got married and had children, no dim vision of such a career\nfor herself had ever presented itself to her eyes. She had known\nvery well that her mother and sister and herself were people\napart,--ladies, and yet so extremely poor, that they could only\nmaintain their rank by the most rigid seclusion. To live, and work\nunseen, was what the world had ordained for her. Then her call\nto Exeter had come upon her, and she had conceived that she was\nhenceforth to be the humble companion of a very imperious old aunt.\nHer aunt, indeed, was imperious, but did not seem to require humility\nin her companion. All the good things that were eaten and drunk were\ndivided between them with the strictest impartiality. Dorothy's\ncushion and hassock in the church and in the cathedral were the same\nas her aunt's. Her bed-room was made very comfortable for her. Her\naunt never gave her any orders before company, and always spoke of\nher before the servants as one whom they were to obey and respect.\nGradually Dorothy came to understand the meaning of this;--but her\naunt would sometimes say things about young men which she did not\nquite understand. Could it be that her aunt supposed that any young\nman would come and wish to marry her,--her, Dorothy Stanbury? She\nherself had not quite so strong an aversion to men in general as that\nwhich Priscilla felt, but she had not as yet found that any of those\nwhom she had seen at Exeter were peculiarly agreeable to her. Before\nshe went to bed that night her aunt said a word to her which startled\nher more than she had ever been startled before. On that evening Miss\nStanbury had a few friends to drink tea with her. There were Mr. and\nMrs. Crumbie, and Mrs. MacHugh of course, and the Cheritons from\nAlphington, and the Miss Apjohns from Helion Villa, and old Mr. Powel\nall the way from Haldon, and two of the Wrights from their house\nin the Northernhay, and Mr. Gibson;--but the Miss Frenches from\nHeavitree were not there. \"Why don't you have the Miss Frenches,\naunt?\" Dorothy had asked.\n\n\"Bother the Miss Frenches! I'm not bound to have them every time.\nThere's Camilla has been and got herself a band-box on the back of\nher head a great deal bigger than the place inside where her brains\nought to be.\" But the band-box at the back of Camilla French's head\nwas not the sole cause of the omission of the two sisters from the\nlist of Miss Stanbury's visitors on this occasion.\n\nThe party went off very much as usual. There were two whist tables,\nfor Miss Stanbury could not bear to cut out. At other houses than her\nown, when there was cutting out, it was quite understood that Miss\nStanbury was to be allowed to keep her place. \"I'll go away, and sit\nout there by myself, if you like,\" she would say. But she was never\nthus banished; and at her own house she usually contrived that\nthere should be no system of banishment. She would play dummy whist,\npreferring it to the four-handed game; and, when hard driven, and\nwith a meet opponent, would not even despise double-dummy. It was\ntold of her and of Mrs. MacHugh that they had played double-dummy\nfor a whole evening together; and they who were given to calumny\nhad declared that the candles on that evening had been lighted very\nearly. On the present occasion a great many sixpenny points were\nscored, and much tea and cake were consumed. Mr. Gibson never played\nwhist,--nor did Dorothy. That young John Wright and Mary Cheriton\nshould do nothing but talk to each other was a thing of course,\nas they were to be married in a month or two. Then there was Ida\nCheriton, who could not very well be left at home; and Mr. Gibson\nmade himself pleasant to Dorothy and Ida Cheriton, instead of making\nhimself pleasant to the two Miss Frenches. Gentlemen in provincial\ntowns quite understand that, from the nature of social circumstances\nin the provinces, they should always be ready to be pleasant at least\nto a pair at a time. At a few minutes before twelve they were all\ngone, and then came the shock.\n\n\"Dolly, my dear, what do you think of Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Think of him, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Yes; think of him;--think of him. I suppose you know how to think?\"\n\n\"He seems to me always to preach very drawling sermons.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother his sermons! I don't care anything about his sermons now.\nHe is a very good clergyman, and the Dean thinks very much about\nhim.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\nThen came the shock. \"Don't you think it would be a very good thing\nif you were to become Mrs. Gibson?\"\n\nIt may be presumed that Miss Stanbury had assured herself that she\ncould not make progress with Dorothy by \"beating about the bush.\"\nThere was an inaptitude in her niece to comprehend the advantages\nof the situations, which made some direct explanation absolutely\nnecessary. Dorothy stood half-smiling, half-crying, when she heard\nthe proposition, her cheeks suffused with that pink colour, and with\nboth her hands extended with surprise.\n\n\"I've been thinking about it ever since you've been here,\" said Miss\nStanbury.\n\n\"I think he likes Miss French,\" said Dorothy, in a whisper.\n\n\"Which of them? I don't believe he likes them at all. Maybe, if they\ngo on long enough, they may be able to toss up for him. But I don't\nthink it of him. Of course they're after him, but he'll be too wise\nfor them. And he's more of a fool than I take him to be if he don't\nprefer you to them.\" Dorothy remained quite silent. To such an\naddress as this it was impossible that she should reply a word. It\nwas incredible to her that any man should prefer herself to either of\nthe young women in question; but she was too much confounded for the\nexpression even of her humility. \"At any rate you're wholesome, and\npleasant and modest,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\nDorothy did not quite like being told that she was wholesome; but,\nnevertheless, she was thankful to her aunt.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" continued Miss Stanbury; \"I hate all\nmysteries, especially with those I love. I've saved two thousand\npounds, which I've put you down for in my will. Now, if you and he\ncan make it up together, I'll give you the money at once. There's no\nknowing how often an old woman may alter her will; but when you've\ngot a thing, you've got it. Mr. Gibson would know the meaning of a\nbird in the hand as well as anybody. Now those girls at Heavitree\nwill never have above a few hundreds each, and not that while\ntheir mother lives.\" Dorothy made one little attempt at squeezing\nher aunt's hand, wishing to thank her aunt for this affectionate\ngenerosity; but she had hardly accomplished the squeeze, when she\ndesisted, feeling strangely averse to any acknowledgment of such a\nboon as that which had been offered to her. \"And now, good night, my\ndear. If I did not think you a very sensible young woman, I should\nnot trust you by saying all this.\" Then they parted, and Dorothy soon\nfound herself alone in her bedroom.\n\nTo have a husband of her own, a perfect gentleman too, and a\nclergyman;--and to go to him with a fortune! She believed that two\nthousand pounds represented nearly a hundred a year. It was a large\nfortune in those parts,--according to her understanding of ladies'\nfortunes. And that she, the humblest of the humble, should be\nselected for so honourable a position! She had never quite known,\nquite understood as yet, whether she had made good her footing in\nher aunt's house in a manner pleasant to her aunt. More than once or\ntwice she had spoken even of going back to her mother, and things\nhad been said which had almost made her think that her aunt had been\nangry with her. But now, after a month or two of joint residence, her\naunt was offering to her--two thousand pounds and a husband!\n\nBut was it within her aunt's power to offer to her the husband? Mr.\nGibson had always been very civil to her. She had spoken more to Mr.\nGibson than to any other man in Exeter. But it had never occurred to\nher for a moment that Mr. Gibson had any special liking for her. Was\nit probable that he would ever entertain any feeling of that kind\nfor her? It certainly had occurred to her before now that Mr. Gibson\nwas sometimes bored by the Miss Frenches;--but then gentlemen do get\nbored by ladies.\n\nAnd at last she asked herself another question,--had she any special\nliking for Mr. Gibson? As far as she understood such matters\neverything was blank there. Thinking of that other question, she went\nto sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nCOLONEL OSBORNE AND MR. BOZZLE RETURN TO LONDON.\n\n\nHugh Stanbury went down on the Saturday, by the early express to\nExeter, on his road to Lessboro'. He took his ticket through to\nLessboro', not purposing to stay at Exeter; but, from the exigencies\nof the various trains, it was necessary that he should remain for\nhalf an hour at the Exeter Station. This took place on the Saturday,\nand Colonel Osborne's visit to the Clock House had been made on the\nFriday. Colonel Osborne had returned to Lessboro', had slept again\nat Mrs. Clegg's house, and returned to London on the Saturday. It so\nhappened that he also was obliged to spend half an hour at the Exeter\nStation, and that his half-hour, and Hugh Stanbury's half-hour, were\none and the same. They met, therefore, as a matter of course, upon\nthe platform. Stanbury was the first to see the other, and he found\nthat he must determine on the spur of the moment what he would say,\nand what he would do. He had received no direct commission from\nTrevelyan as to his meeting with Colonel Osborne. Trevelyan had\ndeclared that, as to the matter of quarrelling, he meant to retain\nthe privilege of doing that for himself; but Stanbury had quite\nunderstood that this was only the vague expression of an angry man.\nThe Colonel had taken a glass of sherry, and had lighted a cigar,\nand was quite comfortable,--having thrown aside, for a time, that\nconsciousness of the futility of his journey which had perplexed\nhim,--when Stanbury accosted him.\n\n\"What! Mr. Stanbury,--how do you do? Fine day, isn't it? Are you\ngoing up or down?\"\n\n\"I'm going to see my own people at Nuncombe Putney, a village beyond\nLessboro',\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Ah;--indeed.\" Colonel Osborne of course perceived at once that as\nthis man was going to the house at which he had just been visiting,\nit would be better that he should himself explain what he had done.\nIf he were to allow this mention of Nuncombe Putney to pass without\nsaying that he himself had been there, he would be convicted of\nat least some purpose of secrecy in what he had been doing. \"Very\nstrange,\" said he; \"I was at Nuncombe Putney myself yesterday.\"\n\n\"I know you were,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"And how did you know it?\" There had been a tone of anger in\nStanbury's voice which Colonel Osborne had at once appreciated, and\nwhich made him assume a similar tone. As they spoke there was a man\nstanding in a corner close by the bookstall, with his eye upon them,\nand that man was Bozzle, the ex-policeman,--who was doing his duty\nwith sedulous activity by seeing \"the Colonel\" back to London. Now\nBozzle did not know Hugh Stanbury, and was angry with himself that he\nshould be so ignorant. It is the pride of a detective ex-policeman to\nknow everybody that comes in his way.\n\n\"Well, I had been so informed. My friend Trevelyan knew that you were\nthere,--or that you were going there.\"\n\n\"I don't care who knew that I was going there,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"I won't pretend to understand how that may be, Colonel Osborne; but\nI think you must be aware, after what took place in Curzon Street,\nthat it would have been better that you should not have attempted to\nsee Mrs. Trevelyan. Whether you have seen her I do not know.\"\n\n\"What business is it of yours, Mr. Stanbury, whether I have seen that\nlady or not?\"\n\n\"Unhappily for me, her husband has made it my business.\"\n\n\"Very unhappily for you, I should say.\"\n\n\"And the lady is staying at my mother's house.\"\n\n\"I presume the lady is not a prisoner in your mother's house, and\nthat your mother's hospitality is not so restricted but that her\nguest may see an old friend under her roof.\" This Colonel Osborne\nsaid with an assumed look of almost righteous indignation, which\nwas not at all lost upon Bozzle. They had returned back towards the\nbookstall, and Bozzle, with his eyes fixed on a copy of the \"D. R.\"\nwhich he had just bought, was straining his ears to the utmost to\ncatch what was being said.\n\n\"You best know whether you have seen her or not.\"\n\n\"I have seen her.\"\n\n\"Then I shall take leave to tell you, Colonel Osborne, that you have\nacted in a most unfriendly way, and have done that which must tend to\nkeep an affectionate husband apart from his wife.\"\n\n\"Sir, I don't at all understand this kind of thing addressed to me.\nThe father of the lady you are speaking of has been my most intimate\nfriend for thirty years.\" After all, the Colonel was a mean man when\nhe could take pride in his youth, and defend himself on the score of\nhis age, in one and the same proceeding.\n\n\"I have nothing further to say,\" replied Stanbury.\n\n\"You have said too much already, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"I think not, Colonel Osborne. You have, I fear, done an incredible\ndeal of mischief by going to Nuncombe Putney; and, after all that\nyou have heard on the subject, you must have known that it would be\nmischievous. I cannot understand how you can force yourself about a\nman's wife against the man's expressed wish.\"\n\n\"Sir, I didn't force myself upon anybody. Sir, I went down to see an\nold friend,--and a remarkable piece of antiquity. And, when another\nold friend was in the neighbourhood, close by,--one of the oldest\nfriends I have in the world,--wasn't I to go and see her? God bless\nmy soul! What business is it of yours? I never heard such impudence\nin my life!\" Let the charitable reader suppose that Colonel Osborne\ndid not know that he was lying,--that he really thought, when he\nspoke, that he had gone down to Lessboro' to see the remarkable piece\nof antiquity.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Hugh Stanbury, turning on his heels and walking\naway. Colonel Osborne shook himself, inflated his cheeks, and blew\nforth the breath out of his mouth, put his thumbs up to the armholes\nof his waistcoat, and walked about the platform as though he thought\nit to be incumbent on him to show that he was somebody,--somebody\nthat ought not to be insulted,--somebody, perhaps, whom a very pretty\nwoman might prefer to her own husband, in spite of a small difference\nin age. He was angry, but not quite so much angry as proud. And he\nwas safe, too. He thought that he was safe. When he should come to\naccount for himself and his actions to his old friend, Sir Marmaduke,\nhe felt that he would be able to show that he had been, in all\nrespects, true to friendship. Sir Marmaduke had unfortunately given\nhis daughter to a jealous, disagreeable fellow, and the fault all\nlay in that. As for Hugh Stanbury,--he would simply despise Hugh\nStanbury, and have done with it.\n\nMr. Bozzle, though he had worked hard in the cause, had heard but a\nword or two. Eaves-droppers seldom do hear more than that. A porter\nhad already told him who was Hugh Stanbury,--that he was Mr. Hugh\nStanbury, and that his aunt lived at Exeter. And Bozzle, knowing that\nthe lady about whom he was concerned was living with a Mrs. Stanbury\nat the house he had been watching, put two and two together with\nhis natural cleverness. \"God bless my soul! what business is it of\nyours?\" Those words were nearly all that Bozzle had been able to\nhear; but even those sufficiently indicated a quarrel. \"The lady\" was\nliving with Mrs. Stanbury, having been so placed by her husband; and\nyoung Stanbury was taking the lady's part! Bozzle began to fear that\nthe husband had not confided in him with that perfect faith which he\nfelt to be essentially necessary to the adequate performance of the\nduties of his great profession. A sudden thought, however, struck\nhim. Something might be done on the journey up to London. He at\nonce made his way back to the ticket-window and exchanged his\nticket,--second-class for first-class. It was a noble deed, the\nexpense falling all upon his own pocket; for, in the natural course\nof things, he would have charged his employers with the full\nfirst-class fare. He had seen Colonel Osborne seat himself in a\ncarriage, and within two minutes he was occupying the opposite place.\nThe Colonel was aware that he had noticed the man's face lately, but\ndid not know where.\n\n\"Very fine summer weather, sir,\" said Bozzle.\n\n\"Very fine,\" said the Colonel, burying himself behind a newspaper.\n\n\"They is getting up their wheat nicely in these parts, sir.\"\n\nThe answer to this was no more than a grunt. But Bozzle was not\noffended. Not to be offended is the special duty of all policemen, in\nand out of office; and the journey from Exeter to London was long,\nand was all before him.\n\n\"A very nice little secluded village is Nuncombe Putney,\" said\nBozzle, as the train was leaving the Salisbury Station.\n\nAt Salisbury two ladies had left the carriage, no one else had got\nin, and Bozzle was alone with the Colonel.\n\n\"I dare say,\" said the Colonel, who by this time had relinquished his\nshield, and who had begun to compose himself for sleep, or to pretend\nto compose himself, as soon as he heard Bozzle's voice. He had been\nlooking at Bozzle, and though he had not discovered the man's trade,\nhad told himself that his companion was a thing of dangers,--a thing\nto be avoided, by one engaged, as had been he himself, on a special\nand secret mission.\n\n\"Saw you there,--calling at the Clock House,\" said Bozzle.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said the Colonel, throwing his head well back into the\ncorner, shutting his eyes, and uttering a slight preliminary snore.\n\n\"Very nice family of ladies at the Clock House,\" said Bozzle. The\nColonel answered him by a more developed snore. \"Particularly Mrs.\nT----\" said Bozzle.\n\nThe Colonel could not stand this. He was so closely implicated with\nMrs. Trevelyan at the present moment that he could not omit to notice\nan address so made to him. \"What the devil is that to you, sir?\" said\nhe, jumping up and confronting Bozzle in his wrath.\n\nBut policemen have always this advantage in their difficulties, that\nthey know to a fraction what the wrath of men is worth, and what it\ncan do. Sometimes it can dismiss a policeman, and sometimes break\nhis head. Sometimes it can give him a long and troublesome job, and\nsometimes it may be wrath to the death. But in nineteen out of twenty\ncases it is not a fearful thing, and the policeman knows well when\nhe need not fear it. On the present occasion Bozzle was not at all\nafraid of Colonel Osborne's wrath.\n\n\"Well, sir, not much, indeed, if you come to that. Only you was\nthere, sir.\"\n\n\"Of course I was there,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"And a very nice young gentleman is Mr. Stanbury,\" said Bozzle.\n\nTo this Colonel Osborne made no reply, but again had resort to his\nnewspaper in the most formal manner.\n\n\"He's going down to his family, no doubt,\" continued Bozzle.\n\n\"He may be going to the devil for what I know,\" said the Colonel, who\ncould not restrain himself.\n\n\"I suppose they're all friends of Mrs. T.'s?\" asked Bozzle.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Colonel, \"I believe that you're a spy.\"\n\n\"No, Colonel, no; no, no; I'm no spy. I wouldn't demean myself to be\nsuch. A spy is a man as has no profession, and nothing to justify his\nlooking into things. Things must be looked into, Colonel; or how's a\nman to know where he is? or how's a lady to know where she is? But\nas for spies, except in the way of evidence, I don't think nothing\nof 'em.\" Soon after this two more passengers entered the train, and\nnothing more was said between Bozzle and the Colonel.\n\nThe Colonel, as soon as he reached London, went home to his lodgings,\nand then to his club, and did his best to enjoy himself. On the\nfollowing Monday he intended to start for Scotland. But he could not\nquite enjoy himself,--because of Bozzle. He felt that he was being\nwatched; and there is nothing that any man hates so much as that,\nespecially when a lady is concerned. Colonel Osborne knew that his\nvisit to Nuncombe Putney had been very innocent; but he did not like\nthe feeling that even his innocence had been made the subject of\nobservation.\n\nBozzle went away at once to Trevelyan, whom he found at his chambers.\nHe himself had had no very deep-laid scheme in his addresses to\nColonel Osborne. He had begun to think that very little would come of\nthe affair,--especially after Hugh Stanbury had appeared upon the\nscene,--and had felt that there was nothing to be lost by presenting\nhimself before the eyes of the Colonel. It was necessary that he\nshould make a report to his employer, and the report might be made\na little more full after a few words with the man whom he had been\n\"looking into.\" \"Well, Mr. Trewillian,\" he said, seating himself\non a chair close against the wall, and holding his hat between the\nknees,--\"I've seen the parties, and know pretty much all about it.\"\n\n\"All I want to know, Mr. Bozzle, is, whether Colonel Osborne has been\nat the Clock House?\"\n\n\"He has been there, Mr. Trewillian. There is no earthly doubt about\nthat. From hour to hour I can tell you pretty nearly where he's been\nsince he left London.\" Then Bozzle took out his memorandum-book.\n\n\"I don't care about all that,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"I dare say not, sir; but it may be wanted all the same. Any\ngentleman acting in our way can't be too particular,--can't have\ntoo many facts. The smallest little,--tiddly things,\"--and Bozzle\nas he said this seemed to enjoy immensely the flavour of his own\nepithet,--\"the smallest little 'tiddly' things do so often turn up\ntrumps when you get your evidence into court.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to get any evidence into court.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, sir. A gentleman and lady is always best out of court as\nlong as things can hang on any way;--but sometimes things won't hang\non no way.\"\n\nTrevelyan, who was conscious that the employment of Bozzle was\ndiscreditable, and whose affairs in Devonshire were now in the hands\nof, at any rate, a more honourable ally, was at present mainly\nanxious to get rid of the ex-policeman. \"I have no doubt you've been\nvery careful, Mr. Bozzle,\" said he.\n\n\"There isn't no one in the business could be more so, Mr.\nTrewillian.\"\n\n\"And you have found out what it was necessary that I should know.\nColonel Osborne did go to the Clock House?\"\n\n\"Was let in at the front door on Friday the 5th, by Sarah French, the\nhousemaid, at 10.37 a.m., and was let out again by the same young\nwoman at 11.41 a.m. Perhaps you'd like to have a copy of the entry,\nMr. Trewillian?\"\n\n\"No, no, no.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter. Of course it'll be with me when it's wanted. Who\nwas with him, exactly, at that time, I can't say. There is things,\nMr. Trewillian, one can't see. But I don't think as he saw neither\nMrs. Stanbury, nor Miss Stanbury,--not to speak to. I did just have\none word, promiscuous, with Sarah French, after he was gone. Whether\nthe other young lady was with 'em or not, and if so for how long,\nI--can't--say. There is things, Mr. Trewillian, which one can't see.\"\n\nHow Trevelyan hated the man as he went on with his odious\ndetails,--details not one of which possessed the slightest\nimportance. \"It's all right, I dare say, Mr. Bozzle. And now about\nthe account.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Mr. Trewillian. But there was one question;--just one\nquestion.\"\n\n\"What question?\" said Trevelyan, almost angrily.\n\n\"And there's another thing I must tell you, too, Mr. Trewillian. I\ncome back to town in the same carriage with the Colonel. I thought it\nbetter.\"\n\n\"You did not tell him who you were?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Trewillian; I didn't tell him that. I don't think he'd say\nif you was to ask him that I told him much of anything. No, Mr.\nTrewillian, I didn't tell him nothing. I don't often tell folks much\ntill the time comes. But I thought it better, and I did have a word\nor two with the gent,--just a word or two. He's not so very downy,\nisn't the Colonel;--for one that's been at it so long, Mr.\nTrewillian.\"\n\n\"I dare say not. But if you could just let me have the account, Mr.\nBozzle,--\"\n\n\"The account? Oh, yes;--that is necessary; ain't it? These sort of\ninquiries do come a little expensive, Mr. Trewillian; because time\ngoes for so much; and when one has to be down on a thing, sharp, you\nknow, and sure, so that counsel on the other side can't part you from\nit, though he shakes you like a dog does a rat,--and one has to get\noneself up ready for all that, you know, Mr. Trewillian,--as I was\nsaying, one can't count one's shillings when one has such a job as\nthis in hand. Clench your nail;--that's what I say; be it even so.\nClench your nail;--that's what you've got to do.\"\n\n\"I dare say we shan't quarrel about the money, Mr. Bozzle.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no. I find I never has any words about the money. But\nthere's that one question. There's a young Mr. Stanbury has gone\ndown, as knows all about it. What's he up to?\"\n\n\"He's my particular friend,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"Oh--h. He do know all about it, then?\"\n\n\"We needn't talk about that, if you please, Mr. Bozzle.\"\n\n\"Because there was words between him and the Colonel upon the\nplatform;--and very angry words. The young man went at the Colonel\nquite open-mouthed,--savage-like. It's not the way such things should\nbe done, Mr. Trewillian; and though of course it's not for me to\nspeak;--she's your lady,--still, when you has got a thing of this\nkind in hand, one head is better than a dozen. As for myself,\nMr. Trewillian, I never wouldn't look at a case,--not if I knew\nit,--unless I was to have it all to myself. But of course there was\nno bargain, and so I says nothing.\"\n\nAfter considerable delay the bill was made out on the spot, Mr.\nBozzle copying down the figures painfully from his memorandum-book,\nwith his head much inclined on one side. Trevelyan asked him, almost\nin despair, to name the one sum; but this Bozzle declined to do,\nsaying that right was right. He had a scale of pilfering of his own,\nto which he had easily reconciled his conscience; and beyond that\nhe prided himself on the honesty of his accounts. At last the bill\nwas made out, was paid, and Bozzle was gone. Trevelyan, when he was\nalone, threw himself back on a sofa, and almost wept in despair. To\nwhat a depth of degradation had he not been reduced!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nNIDDON PARK.\n\n\nAs Hugh Stanbury went over to Lessboro', and from thence to Nuncombe\nPutney, he thought more of himself and Nora Rowley than he did of Mr.\nand Mrs. Trevelyan. As to Mrs. Trevelyan and Colonel Osborne, he felt\nthat he knew everything that it was necessary that he should know.\nThe man had been there, and had seen Mrs. Trevelyan. Of that there\ncould be no doubt. That Colonel Osborne had been wickedly indifferent\nto the evil consequences of such a visit, and that all the women\nconcerned had been most foolish in permitting him to make it, was his\npresent conviction. But he did not for a moment doubt that the visit\nhad in itself been of all things the most innocent. Trevelyan had\nsworn that if his wife received the man at Nuncombe Putney, he\nwould never see her again. She had seen him, and this oath would be\nremembered, and there would be increased difficulties. But these\ndifficulties, whatever they might be, must be overcome. When he had\ntold himself this, then he allowed his mind to settle itself on Nora\nRowley.\n\nHitherto he had known Miss Rowley only as a fashionable girl living\nwith the wife of an intimate friend of his own in London. He had\nnever been staying in the same house with her. Circumstances had\nnever given to him the opportunity of assuming the manner of an\nintimate friend, justifying him in giving advice, and authorising\nhim to assume that semi-paternal tone which is by far the easiest\npreliminary to love-making. When a man can tell a young lady what\nshe ought to read, what she ought to do, and whom she ought to know,\nnothing can be easier than to assure her that, of all her duties,\nher first duty is to prefer himself to all the world. And any young\nlady who has consented to receive lessons from such a teacher, will\ngenerally be willing to receive this special lesson among others.\nBut Stanbury had hitherto had no such opportunities. In London Miss\nRowley had been a fashionable young lady, living in Mayfair, and he\nhad been,--well, anything but a fashionable young man. Nevertheless,\nhe had seen her often, had sat by her very frequently, was quite sure\nthat he loved her dearly, and had, perhaps, some self-flattering\nidea in his mind that had he stuck to his honourable profession as a\nbarrister, and were he possessed of some comfortable little fortune\nof his own, he might, perhaps, have been able, after due siege\noperations, to make this charming young woman his own. Things were\nquite changed now. For the present, Miss Rowley certainly could not\nbe regarded as a fashionable London young lady. The house in which he\nwould see her was, in some sort, his own. He would be sleeping under\nthe same roof with her, and would have all the advantages which such\na position could give him. He would have no difficulty now in asking,\nif he should choose to ask; and he thought that she might be somewhat\nsofter, somewhat more likely to yield at Nuncombe Putney, than she\nwould have been in London. She was at Nuncombe in weak circumstances,\nto a certain degree friendless; with none of the excitement of\nsociety around her, with no elder sons buzzing about her and\nfilling her mind, if not her heart, with the glories of luxurious\nprimogeniture. Hugh Stanbury certainly did not dream that any\nspecial elder son had as yet been so attracted as to have made a\njourney to Nuncombe Putney on Nora's behalf. But should he on this\naccount,--because she would be, as it were, without means of defence\nfrom his attack,--should he therefore take advantage of her weakness?\nShe would, of course, go back to her London life after some short\nabsence, and would again, if free, have her chance among the favoured\nones of the earth. What had he to offer to her? He had taken the\nClock House for his mother, and it would be quite as much as he could\ndo, when Mrs. Trevelyan should have left the village, to keep up that\nestablishment and maintain himself in London,--quite as much as he\ncould do, even though the favours of the \"D. R.\" should flow upon\nhim with their fullest tides. In such circumstances, would it be\nhonourable in him to ask a girl to love him because he found her\ndefenceless in his mother's house?\n\n\"If there bain't another for Nuncombe,\" said Mrs. Clegg's Ostler to\nMrs. Clegg's Boots, as Stanbury was driven off in a gig.\n\n\"That be young Stanbury, a-going of whome.\"\n\n\"They be all a-going for the Clock House. Since the old 'ooman took\nto thick there house, there be folk a-comin' and a-goin' every day\nloike.\"\n\n\"It's along of the madam that they keeps there, Dick,\" said the\nBoots.\n\n\"I didn't care if there'd be madams allays. They're the best as is\ngoing for trade anyhow,\" said the ostler. What the ostler said was\ntrue. When there comes to be a feeling that a woman's character is in\nany way tarnished, there comes another feeling that everybody on the\none side may charge double, and that everybody on the other side must\npay double, for everything. Hugh Stanbury could not understand why he\nwas charged a shilling a mile, instead of ninepence, for the gig to\nNuncombe Putney. He got no satisfactory answer, and had to pay the\nshilling. The truth was, that gigs to Nuncombe Putney had gone up,\nsince a lady, separated from her husband, with a colonel running\nafter her, had been taken in at the Clock House.\n\n\"Here's Hugh!\" said Priscilla, hurrying to the front door. And Mrs.\nStanbury hurried after her. Her son Hugh was the apple of her eye,\nthe best son that ever lived, generous, noble, a thorough\nman,--almost a god!\n\n\"Dear, dear, oh dear! Who'd have expected it? God bless you, my boy!\nWhy didn't you write? Priscilla, what is there in the house that he\ncan eat?\"\n\n\"Plenty of bread and cheese,\" said Priscilla, laughing, with her hand\ninside her brother's arm. For though Priscilla hated all other men,\nshe did not hate her brother Hugh. \"If you wanted things nice to eat\ndirectly you got here, you ought to have written.\"\n\n\"I shall want my dinner, like any other Christian,--in due time,\"\nsaid Hugh. \"And how is Mrs. Trevelyan,--and how is Miss Rowley?\"\n\nHe soon found himself in company with those two ladies, and\nexperienced some immediate difficulty in explaining the cause of his\nsudden coming. But this was soon put aside by Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"When did you see my husband?\" she asked.\n\n\"I saw him yesterday. He was quite well.\"\n\n\"Colonel Osborne has been here,\" she said.\n\n\"I know that he has been here. I met him at the station at Exeter.\nPerhaps I should not say so, but I wish he had remained away.\"\n\n\"We all wish it,\" said Priscilla.\n\nThen Nora spoke. \"But what could we do, Mr. Stanbury? It seemed so\nnatural that he should call when he was in the neighbourhood. We have\nknown him so long; and how could we refuse to see him?\"\n\n\"I will not let any one think that I'm afraid to see any man on\nearth,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"If he had ever in his life said a word\nthat he should not have said, a word that would have been an insult,\nof course it would have been different. But the notion of it is\npreposterous. Why should I not have seen him?\"\n\n\"I think he was wrong to come,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Of course he was wrong;--wickedly wrong,\" said Priscilla.\n\nStanbury, finding that the subject was openly discussed between\nthem, declared plainly the mission that had brought him to Nuncombe.\n\"Trevelyan heard that he was coming, and asked me to let him know the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Now you can tell him the truth,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, with something\nof indignation in her tone, as though she thought that Stanbury had\ntaken upon himself a task of which he ought to be ashamed.\n\n\"But Colonel Osborne came specially to pay a visit to\nCockchaffington,\" said Nora, \"and not to see us. Louis ought to know\nthat.\"\n\n\"Nora, how can you demean yourself to care about such trash?\" said\nMrs. Trevelyan. \"Who cares why he came here? His visit to me was a\nthing of course. If Mr. Trevelyan disapproves of it, let him say so,\nand not send secret messengers.\"\n\n\"Am I a secret messenger?\" said Hugh Stanbury.\n\n\"There has been a man here, inquiring of the servants,\" said\nPriscilla. So that odious Bozzle had made his foul mission known\nto them! Stanbury, however, thought it best to say nothing of\nBozzle,--not to acknowledge that he had ever heard of Bozzle. \"I am\nsure Mrs. Trevelyan does not mean you,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"I do not know what I mean,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"I am so harassed\nand fevered by these suspicions that I am driven nearly mad.\" Then\nshe left the room for a minute and returned with two letters. \"There,\nMr. Stanbury; I got that note from Colonel Osborne, and wrote to him\nthat reply. You know all about it now. Can you say that I was wrong\nto see him?\"\n\n\"I am sure that he was wrong to come,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Wickedly wrong,\" said Priscilla, again.\n\n\"You can keep the letters, and show them to my husband,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan; \"then he will know all about it.\" But Stanbury declined to\nkeep the letters.\n\nHe was to remain the Sunday at Nuncombe Putney and return to London\non the Monday. There was, therefore, but one day on which he could\nsay what he had to say to Nora Rowley. When he came down to breakfast\non the Sunday morning he had almost made up his mind that he had\nnothing to say to her. As for Nora, she was in a state of mind much\nless near to any fixed purpose. She had told herself that she loved\nthis man,--had indeed done so in the clearest way, by acknowledging\nthe fact of her love to another suitor, by pleading to that other\nsuitor the fact of her love as an insuperable reason why he should\nbe rejected. There was no longer any doubt about it to her. When\nPriscilla had declared that Hugh Stanbury was at the door, her heart\nhad gone into her mouth. Involuntarily she had pressed her hands to\nher sides, and had held her breath. Why had he come there? Had he\ncome there for her? Oh! if he had come there for her, and if she\nmight dare to forget all the future, how sweet,--sweetest of all\nthings in heaven or earth,--might be an August evening with him among\nthe lanes! But she, too, had endeavoured to be very prudent. She\nhad told herself that she was quite unfit to be the wife of a poor\nman,--that she would be only a burden round his neck, and not an aid\nto him. And in so telling herself, she had told herself also that she\nhad been a fool not to accept Mr. Glascock. She should have dragged\nout from her heart the image of this man who had never even whispered\na word of love in her ears, and should have constrained herself to\nreceive with affection a man in loving whom there ought to be no\ndifficulty. But when she had been repeating those lessons to herself,\nHugh Stanbury had not been in the house. Now he was there;--and what\nmust be her answer if he should whisper that word of love? She had an\nidea that it would be treason in her to disown the love she felt, if\nquestioned concerning her heart by the man to whom it had been given.\n\nThey all went to church on the Sunday morning, and up to that time\nNora had not been a moment alone with the man. It had been decided\nthat they should dine early, and then ramble out, when the evening\nwould be less hot than the day had been, to a spot called Niddon\nPark. This was nearly three miles from Nuncombe, and was a beautiful\nwild slope of ground, full of ancient, blighted, blasted, but still\nhalf-living oaks,--oaks that still brought forth leaves,--overlooking\na bend of the river Teign. Park, in the usual sense of the word,\nthere was none, nor did they who lived round Nuncombe Putney know\nwhether Niddon Park had ever been enclosed. But of all the spots in\nthat lovely neighbourhood, Priscilla Stanbury swore that it was the\nloveliest; and, as it had never yet been seen by Mrs. Trevelyan or\nher sister, it was determined that they would walk there on this\nAugust afternoon. There were four of them,--and, as was natural, they\nfell into parties of two and two. But Priscilla walked with Nora, and\nHugh Stanbury walked with his friend's wife. Nora was talkative, but\ndemure in her manner, and speaking now and again as though she were\ngiving words and not thoughts. She felt that there was something to\nhide, and was suffering from disappointment that their party should\nnot have been otherwise divided. Had Hugh spoken to her and asked her\nto be his wife, she could not have accepted him, because she knew\nthat they were both poor, and that she was not fit to keep a poor\nman's house. She had declared to herself most plainly that that must\nbe her course;--but yet she was disappointed, and talked on with the\nknowledge that she had something to conceal.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Niddon Park.]\n\n\nWhen they were seated beneath an old riven, withered oak, looking\ndown upon the river, they were still divided in the same way. In\nseating herself she had been very anxious not to disarrange that\narrangement,--almost equally anxious not to seem to adhere to it\nwith any special purpose. She was very careful that there should be\nnothing seen in her manner that was in any way special,--but in the\nmeantime she was suffering an agony of trouble. He did not care for\nher in the least. She was becoming sure of that. She had given all\nher love to a man who had none to give her in return. As she thought\nof this she almost longed for the offer of that which she knew she\ncould not have accepted had it been offered to her. But she talked\non about the scenery, about the weather,--descanting on the pleasure\nof living where such loveliness was within reach. Then there came a\npause for a moment. \"Nora,\" said Priscilla, \"I do not know what you\nare thinking about, but it is not of the beauty of Niddon Park.\" Then\nthere came a faint sound as of an hysterical sob, and then a gurgle\nin the throat, and then a pretence at laughter.\n\n\"I don't believe I am thinking of anything at all,\" said Nora.\n\nAfter which Hugh insisted on descending to the bank of the river,\nbut, as the necessity of re-climbing the slope was quite manifest,\nnone of the girls would go with him. \"Come, Miss Rowley,\" said he,\n\"will you not show them that a lady can go up and down a hill as well\nas a man?\"\n\n\"I had rather not go up and down the hill,\" said she.\n\nThen he understood that she was angry with him; and in some sort\nsurmised the cause of her anger. Not that he believed that she loved\nhim; but it seemed possible to him that she resented the absence of\nhis attention. He went down, and scrambled out on the rocks into\nthe bed of the river, while the girls above looked down upon him,\nwatching the leaps that he made. Priscilla and Mrs. Trevelyan called\nto him, bidding him beware; but Nora called not at all. He was\nwhistling as he made his jumps, but still he heard their voices, and\nknew that he did not hear Nora's voice. He poised himself on the edge\nof a rock in the middle of the stream, and looked up the river and\ndown the river, turning himself carefully on his narrow foothold; but\nhe was thinking only of Nora. Could there be anything nobler than to\nstruggle on with her, if she only would be willing? But then she was\nyoung; and should she yield to such a request from him, she would not\nknow what she was yielding. He turned again, jumping from rock to\nrock till he reached the bank, and then made his way again up to the\nwithered oak.\n\n\"You would not have repented it if you had come down with me,\" he\nsaid to Nora.\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" she answered.\n\nWhen they started to return she stepped on gallantly with Priscilla;\nbut Priscilla was stopped by some chance, having some word to say to\nher brother, having some other word to say to Mrs. Trevelyan. Could\nit be that her austerity had been softened, and that in kindness she\ncontrived that Nora should be left some yards behind them with her\nbrother? Whether it were kindness, or an unkind error, so it was.\nNora, when she perceived what destiny was doing for her, would not\ninterfere with destiny. If he chose to speak to her she would hear\nhim and would answer him. She knew very well what answer she would\ngive him. She had her answer quite ready at her fingers' ends. There\nwas no doubt about her answer.\n\nThey had walked half a mile together and he had spoken of nothing but\nthe scenery. She had endeavoured to appear to be excited. Oh, yes,\nthe scenery of Devonshire was delightful. She hardly wanted anything\nmore to make her happy. If only this misery respecting her sister\ncould be set right!\n\n\"And you, you yourself,\" said he, \"do you mean that there is nothing\nyou want in leaving London?\"\n\n\"Not much, indeed.\"\n\n\"It sometimes seemed to me that that kind of life was,--was very\npleasant to you.\"\n\n\"What kind of life, Mr. Stanbury?\"\n\n\"The life that you were living,--going out, being admired, and having\nthe rich and dainty all around you.\"\n\n\"I don't dislike people because they are rich,\" she said.\n\n\"No; nor do I; and I despise those who affect to dislike them. But\nall cannot be rich.\"\n\n\"Nor all dainty, as you choose to call them.\"\n\n\"But they who have once been dainty,--as I call them,--never like\nto divest themselves of their daintiness. You have been one of the\ndainty, Miss Rowley.\"\n\n\"Have I?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I doubt whether you would be happy if you thought that\nyour daintiness had departed from you.\"\n\n\"I hope, Mr. Stanbury, that nothing nice and pleasant has departed\nfrom me. If I have ever been dainty, dainty I hope I may remain. I\nwill never, at any rate, give it up of my own accord.\" Why she said\nthis, she could never explain to herself. She had certainly not\nintended to rebuff him when she had been saying it. But he spoke not\na word to her further as they walked home, either of her mode of life\nor of his own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nHUGH STANBURY SMOKES HIS PIPE.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nNora Rowley, when she went to bed, after her walk to Niddon Park in\ncompany with Hugh Stanbury, was full of wrath against him. But she\ncould not own her anger to herself, nor could she even confess to\nherself,--though she was breaking her heart,--that there really\nexisted for her the slightest cause of grief. But why had he been so\nstern to her? Why had he gone out of his way to be uncivil to her? He\nhad called her \"dainty,\" meaning to imply by the epithet that she was\none of the butterflies of the day, caring for nothing but sunshine\nand an opportunity of fluttering her silly wings. She had understood\nwell what he meant. Of course he was right to be cold to her if\nhis heart was cold, but he need not have insulted her by his\nill-concealed rebukes. Had he been kind to her, he might have rebuked\nher as much as he liked. She quite appreciated the delightful\nintimacy of a loving word of counsel from the man she loved,--how\nnice it is, as it were, to play at marriage, and to hear beforehand\nsomething of the pleasant weight of gentle marital authority. But\nthere had been nothing of that in his manner to her. He had told her\nthat she was dainty,--and had so told it her, as she thought, that\nshe might learn thereby, that under no circumstances would he have\nany other tale to tell her. If he had no other tale, why had he not\nbeen silent? Did he think that she was subject to his rebuke merely\nbecause she lived under his mother's roof? She would soon shew him\nthat her residence at the Clock House gave him no such authority over\nher. Then, amidst her wrath and despair, she cried herself asleep.\n\nWhile she was sobbing in bed, he was sitting, with a short, black\npipe stuck into his mouth, on the corner of the churchyard wall\nopposite. Before he had left the house he and Priscilla had spoken\ntogether for some minutes about Mrs. Trevelyan. \"Of course she was\nwrong to see him,\" said Priscilla. \"I hesitate to wound her by so\nsaying, because she has been ill-used,--though I did tell her so,\nwhen she asked me. She could have lost nothing by declining his\nvisit.\"\n\n\"The worst of it is that Trevelyan swears that he will never receive\nher again if she received him.\"\n\n\"He must unswear it,\" said Priscilla, \"that is all. It is out of the\nquestion that a man should take a girl from her home, and make her\nhis wife, and then throw her off for so little of an offence as this.\nShe might compel him by law to take her back.\"\n\n\"What would she get by that?\"\n\n\"Little enough,\" said Priscilla; \"and it was little enough she got by\nmarrying him. She would have had bread, and meat, and raiment without\nbeing married, I suppose.\"\n\n\"But it was a love-match.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and now she is at Nuncombe Putney, and he is roaming about in\nLondon. He has to pay ever so much a year for his love-match, and she\nis crushed into nothing by it. How long will she have to remain here,\nHugh?\"\n\n\"How can I say? I suppose there is no reason against her remaining as\nfar as you are concerned?\"\n\n\"For me personally, none. Were she much worse than I think she is, I\nshould not care in the least for myself, if I thought that we were\ndoing her good,--helping to bring her back. She can't hurt me. I am\nso fixed, and dry, and established, that nothing anybody says will\naffect me. But mamma doesn't like it.\"\n\n\"What is it she dislikes?\"\n\n\"The idea that she is harbouring a married woman, of whom people say,\nat least, that she has a lover.\"\n\n\"Is she to be turned out because people are slanderers?\"\n\n\"Why should mamma suffer because this woman, who is a stranger to\nher, has been imprudent? If she were your wife, Hugh--\"\n\n\"God forbid!\"\n\n\"If we were in any way bound to her, of course we would do our duty.\nBut if it makes mamma unhappy I am sure you will not press it. I\nthink Mrs. Merton has spoken to her. And then Aunt Stanbury has\nwritten such letters!\"\n\n\"Who cares for Aunt Jemima?\"\n\n\"Everybody cares for her,--except you and I. And now this man who has\nbeen here asking the servant questions has upset her greatly. Even\nyour coming has done so, knowing, as she does, that you have come,\nnot to see us, but to make inquiries about Mrs. Trevelyan. She is so\nannoyed by it, that she does not sleep.\"\n\n\"Do you wish her to be taken away at once?\" asked Hugh, almost in an\nangry tone.\n\n\"Certainly not. That would be impossible. We have agreed to take her,\nand must bear with it. And I would not have her moved from this, if I\nthought that if she stayed awhile it might be arranged that she might\nreturn from us direct to her husband.\"\n\n\"I shall try that, of course;--now.\"\n\n\"But if he will not have her;--if he be so obstinate, so foolish, and\nso wicked, do not leave her here longer than you can help.\" Then Hugh\nexplained that Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley were to be in England in\nthe spring, and that it would be very desirable that the poor woman\nshould not be sent abroad to look for a home before that. \"If it must\nbe so, it must,\" said Priscilla. \"But eight months is a long time.\"\n\nHugh went out to smoke his pipe on the church-wall in a moody,\nunhappy state of mind. He had hoped to have done so well in regard\nto Mrs. Trevelyan! Till he had met Colonel Osborne, he felt sure,\nalmost sure, that she would have refused to see that pernicious\ntroubler of the peace of families. In this he found that he had been\ndisappointed; but he had not expected that Priscilla would have been\nso much opposed to the arrangement which he had made about the house,\nand then he had been buoyed up by the anticipation of some delight in\nmeeting Nora Rowley. There was, at any rate, the excitement of seeing\nher to keep his spirits from flagging. He had seen her, and had had\nthe opportunity of which he had so long been thinking. He had seen\nher, and had had every possible advantage on his side. What could any\nman desire better than the privilege of walking home with the girl\nhe loved through country lanes of a summer evening? They had been an\nhour together,--or might have been, had he chosen to prolong the\ninterview. But the words which had been spoken between them had had\nnot the slightest interest,--unless it were that they had tended to\nmake the interval between him and her wider than ever. He had asked\nher,--he thought that he had asked,--whether it would grieve her to\nabandon that delicate, dainty mode of life to which she had been\naccustomed; and she had replied, that she would never abandon it of\nher own accord. Of course she had intended him to take her at her\nword.\n\nHe blew forth quick clouds of heavy smoke, as he attempted to make\nhimself believe that this was all for the best. What would such a one\nas he was do with a wife? Or, seeing as he did see, that marriage\nitself was quite out of the question, how could it be good either for\nhim or her that they should be tied together by a long engagement?\nSuch a future would not at all suit the purpose of his life. In his\nlife absolute freedom would be needed;--freedom from unnecessary\nties, freedom from unnecessary burdens. His income was most\nprecarious, and he certainly would not make it less so by submission\nto any closer literary thraldom. And he believed himself to be a\nBohemian,--too much of a Bohemian to enjoy a domestic fireside with\nchildren and slippers. To be free to go where he liked, and when he\nliked; to think as he pleased; to be driven nowhere by conventional\nrules; to use his days, Sundays as well as Mondays, as he pleased\nto use them; to turn Republican, if his mind should take him that\nway,--or Quaker, or Mormon, or Red Indian, if he wished it, and in so\nturning to do no damage to any one but himself;--that was the life\nwhich he had planned for himself. His Aunt Stanbury had not read\nhis character altogether wrongly, as he thought, when she had once\ndeclared that decency and godliness were both distasteful to him.\nWould it not be destruction to such a one as he was, to fall into an\ninterminable engagement with any girl, let her be ever so sweet?\n\nBut yet, he felt as he sat there, filling pipe after pipe, smoking\naway till past midnight, that though he could not bear the idea of\ntrammels, though he was totally unfit for matrimony, either present\nor in prospect,--he felt that he had within his breast a double\nidentity, and that that other division of himself would be utterly\ncrushed if it were driven to divest itself of the idea of love.\nWhence was to come his poetry, the romance of his life, the springs\nof clear water in which his ignoble thoughts were to be dipped till\nthey should become pure, if love was to be banished altogether from\nthe list of delights that were possible to him? And then he began\nto speculate on love,--that love of which poets wrote, and of which\nhe found that some sparkle was necessary to give light to his life.\nWas it not the one particle of divine breath given to man, of which\nhe had heard since he was a boy? And how was this love to be come\nat, and was it to be a thing of reality, or merely an idea? Was\nit a pleasure to be attained, or a mystery that charmed by the\ndifficulties of the distance,--a distance that never could be so\npassed that the thing should really be reached? Was love to be\never a delight, vague as is that feeling of unattainable beauty\nwhich far-off mountains give, when you know that you can never\nplace yourself amidst their unseen valleys? And if love could be\nreached,--the love of which the poets sing, and of which his own\nheart was ever singing,--what were to be its pleasures? To press a\nhand, to kiss a lip, to clasp a waist, to hear even the low voice of\nthe vanquished, confessing loved one as she hides her blushing cheek\nupon your shoulder,--what is it all but to have reached the once\nmysterious valley of your far-off mountain, and to have found that it\nis as other valleys,--rocks and stones, with a little grass, and a\nthin stream of running water? But beyond that pressure of the hand,\nand that kissing of the lips,--beyond that short-lived pressure of\nthe plumage which is common to birds and men,--what could love do\nbeyond that? There were children with dirty faces, and household\nbills, and a wife who must, perhaps, always darn the stockings,--and\nbe sometimes cross. Was love to lead only to this,--a dull life, with\na woman who had lost the beauty from her cheeks, and the gloss from\nher hair, and the music from her voice, and the fire from her eye,\nand the grace from her step, and whose waist an arm should no longer\nbe able to span? Did the love of the poets lead to that, and that\nonly? Then, through the cloud of smoke, there came upon him some\ndim idea of self-abnegation,--that the mysterious valley among\nthe mountains, the far-off prospect of which was so charming to\nhim,--which made the poetry of his life, was, in fact, the capacity\nof caring more for other human beings than for himself. The beauty of\nit all was not so much in the thing loved as in the loving. \"Were she\na cripple, hunchbacked, eyeless,\" he said to himself, \"it might be\nthe same. Only she must be a woman.\" Then he blew off a great cloud\nof smoke, and went into bed lost amidst poetry, philosophy, love, and\ntobacco.\n\nIt had been arranged over-night that he was to start the next morning\nat half-past seven, and Priscilla had promised to give him his\nbreakfast before he went. Priscilla, of course, kept her word. She\nwas one of those women who would take a grim pleasure in coming\ndown to make the tea at any possible hour,--at five, at four, if it\nwere needed,--and who would never want to go to bed again when the\nceremony was performed. But when Nora made her appearance,--Nora, who\nhad been called dainty,--both Priscilla and Hugh were surprised. They\ncould not say why she was there,--nor could Nora tell herself. She\nhad not forgiven him. She had no thought of being gentle and loving\nto him. She declared to herself that she had no wish of saying\ngood-bye to him once again. But yet she was in the room, waiting\nfor him, when he came down to his breakfast. She had been unable to\nsleep, and had reasoned with herself as to the absurdity of lying in\nbed awake, when she preferred to be up and out of the house. It was\ntrue that she had not been out of her bed at seven any morning since\nshe had been at Nuncombe Putney; but that was no reason why she\nshould not be more active on this special morning. There was a noise\nin the house, and she never could sleep when there was a noise. She\nwas quite sure that she was not going down because she wished to see\nHugh Stanbury, but she was equally sure that it would be a disgrace\nto her to be deterred from going down, simply because the man was\nthere. So she descended to the parlour, and was standing near the\nopen window when Stanbury bustled into the room, some quarter of\nan hour after the proper time. Priscilla was there also, guessing\nsomething of the truth, and speculating whether these two young\npeople, should they love each other, would be the better or the worse\nfor such love. There must be marriages,--if only that the world\nmight go on in accordance with the Creator's purpose. But, as far\nas Priscilla could see, blessed were they who were not called upon\nto assist in the scheme. To her eyes all days seemed to be days of\nwrath, and all times, times of tribulation. And it was all mere\nvanity and vexation of spirit. To go on and bear it till one\nwas dead,--helping others to bear it, if such help might be of\navail,--that was her theory of life. To make it pleasant by eating,\nand drinking, and dancing, or even by falling in love, was, to her\nmind, a vain crunching of ashes between the teeth. Not to have ill\nthings said of her and of hers, not to be disgraced, not to be\nrendered incapable of some human effort, not to have actually to\nstarve,--such was the extent of her ambition in this world. And for\nthe next,--she felt so assured of the goodness of God that she could\nnot bring herself to doubt of happiness in a world that was to be\neternal. Her doubt was this, whether it was really the next world\nwhich would be eternal. Of eternity she did not doubt;--but might\nthere not be many worlds? These things, however, she kept almost\nentirely to herself. \"You down!\" Priscilla had said.\n\n\"Well, yes; I could not sleep when I heard you all moving. And the\nmorning is so fine, and I thought that perhaps you would go out and\nwalk after your brother has gone.\" Priscilla promised that she would\nwalk, and then the tea was made.\n\n\"Your sister and I are going out for an early walk,\" said Nora, when\nshe was greeted by Stanbury. Priscilla said nothing, but thought she\nunderstood it all.\n\n\"I wish I were going with you,\" said Hugh. Nora, remembering how very\nlittle he had made of his opportunity on the evening before, did not\nbelieve him.\n\nThe eggs and fried bacon were eaten in a hurry, and very little was\nsaid. Then there came the moment for parting. The brother and sister\nkissed each other, and Hugh took Nora by the hand. \"I hope you make\nyourself happy here,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--if it were only for myself I should want nothing.\"\n\n\"I will do the best I can with Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"The best will be to make him, and every one, understand that the\nfault is altogether his, and not Emily's.\"\n\n\"The best will be to make each think that there has been no real\nfault,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"There should be no talking of faults,\" said Priscilla. \"Let the\nhusband take his wife back,--as he is bound to do.\"\n\nThese words occupied hardly a minute in the saying, but during that\nminute Hugh Stanbury held Nora by the hand. He held it fast. She\nwould not attempt to withdraw it, but neither would she return his\npressure by the muscle of a single finger. What right had he to press\nher hand; or to make any sign of love, any pretence of loving, when\nhe had gone out of his way to tell her that she was not good enough\nfor him? Then he started, and Nora and Priscilla put on their hats\nand left the house.\n\n\"Let us go to Niddon Park,\" said Nora.\n\n\"To Niddon Park again?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is so beautiful! And I should like to see it by the morning\nlight. There is plenty of time.\"\n\nSo they walked to Niddon Park in the morning, as they had done on the\npreceding evening. Their conversation at first regarded Trevelyan and\nhis wife, and the old trouble; but Nora could not keep herself from\nspeaking of Hugh Stanbury.\n\n\"He would not have come,\" she said, \"unless Louis had sent him.\"\n\n\"He would not have come now, I think.\"\n\n\"Of course not;--why should he?--before Parliament was hardly over,\ntoo? But he won't remain in town now,--will he?\"\n\n\"He says somebody must remain,--and I think he will be in London till\nnear Christmas.\"\n\n\"How disagreeable! But I suppose he doesn't care. It's all the same\nto a man like him. They don't shut the clubs up, I dare say. Will he\ncome here at Christmas?\"\n\n\"Either then or for the New Year;--just for a day or two.\"\n\n\"We shall be gone then, I suppose?\" said Nora.\n\n\"That must depend on Mr. Trevelyan,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"What a life for two women to lead;--to depend upon the caprice of a\nman who must be mad! Do you think that Mr. Trevelyan will care for\nwhat your brother says to him?\"\n\n\"I do not know Mr. Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"He is very fond of your brother, and I suppose men friends do listen\nto each other. They never seem to listen to women. Don't you think\nthat, after all, they despise women? They look on them as dainty,\nfoolish things.\"\n\n\"Sometimes women despise men,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Not very often;--do they? And then women are so dependent on men. A\nwoman can get nothing without a man.\"\n\n\"I manage to get on somehow,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"No, you don't, Miss Stanbury,--if you think of it. You want mutton.\nAnd who kills the sheep?\"\n\n\"But who cooks it?\"\n\n\"But the men-cooks are the best,\" said Nora; \"and the men-tailors,\nand the men to wait at table, and the men-poets, and the\nmen-painters, and the men-nurses. All the things that women do, men\ndo better.\"\n\n\"There are two things they can't do,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"They can't suckle babies, and they can't forget themselves.\"\n\n\"About the babies, of course not. As for forgetting themselves,--I am\nnot quite so sure that I can forget myself.--That is just where your\nbrother went down last night.\"\n\nThey had at this moment reached the top of the steep slope below\nwhich the river ran brawling among the rocks, and Nora seated herself\nexactly where she had sat on the previous evening.\n\n\"I have been down scores of times,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Let us go now.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't go when Hugh asked you yesterday.\"\n\n\"I didn't care then. But do come now,--if you don't mind the climb.\"\nThen they went down the slope and reached the spot from whence Hugh\nStanbury had jumped from rock to rock across the stream. \"You have\nnever been out there, have you?\" said Nora.\n\n\"On the rocks? Oh, dear, no! I should be sure to fall.\"\n\n\"But he went; just like a goat.\"\n\n\"That's one of the things that men can do, I suppose,\" said\nPriscilla. \"But I don't see any great glory in being like a goat.\"\n\n\"I do. I should like to be able to go, and I think I'll try. It is so\nmean to be dainty and weak.\"\n\n\"I don't think it at all dainty to keep dry feet.\"\n\n\"But he didn't get his feet wet,\" said Nora. \"Or if he did, he didn't\nmind. I can see at once that I should be giddy and tumble down if I\ntried it.\"\n\n\"Of course you would.\"\n\n\"But he didn't tumble down.\"\n\n\"He has been doing it all his life,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"He can't do it up in London. When I think of myself, Miss Stanbury,\nI am so ashamed. There is nothing that I can do. I couldn't write an\narticle for a newspaper.\"\n\n\"I think I could. But I fear no one would read it.\"\n\n\"They read his,\" said Nora, \"or else he wouldn't be paid for writing\nthem.\" Then they climbed back again up the hill, and during the\nclimbing there were no words spoken. The slope was not much of a\nhill,--was no more than the fall from the low ground of the valley to\nthe course which the river had cut for itself; but it was steep while\nit lasted; and both the young women were forced to pause for a minute\nbefore they could proceed upon their journey. As they walked home\nPriscilla spoke of the scenery, and of the country, and of the\nnature of the life which she and her mother and sister had passed at\nNuncombe Putney. Nora said but little till they were just entering\nthe village, and then she went back to the subject of her thoughts.\n\"I would sooner,\" said she, \"write for a newspaper than do anything\nelse in the world.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because it is so noble to teach people everything! And then a man\nwho writes for a newspaper must know so many things himself! I\nbelieve there are women who do it, but very few. One or two have done\nit, I know.\"\n\n\"Go and tell that to Aunt Stanbury, and hear what she will say about\nsuch women.\"\n\n\"I suppose she is very,--prejudiced.\"\n\n\"Yes; she is; but she is a clever woman. I am inclined to think women\nhad better not write for newspapers.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" Nora asked.\n\n\"My reasons would take me a week to explain, and I doubt whether I\nhave them very clear in my own head. In the first place there is that\ndifficulty about the babies. Most of them must get married you know.\"\n\n\"But not all,\" said Nora.\n\n\"No; thank God; not all.\"\n\n\"And if you are not married you might write for a newspaper. At any\nrate, if I were you, I should be very proud of my brother.\"\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury is not at all proud of her nephew,\" said Priscilla, as\nthey entered the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nA THIRD PARTY IS SO OBJECTIONABLE.\n\n\nHugh Stanbury went in search of Trevelyan immediately on his return\nto London, and found his friend at his rooms in Lincoln's Inn.\n\n\"I have executed my commission,\" said Hugh, endeavouring to speak of\nwhat he had done in a cheery voice.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you, Stanbury; very much;--but I do not know\nthat I need trouble you to tell me anything about it.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"I have learned it all from that--man.\"\n\n\"What man?\"\n\n\"From Bozzle. He has come back, and has been with me, and has learned\neverything.\"\n\n\"Look here, Trevelyan;--when you asked me to go down to Devonshire,\nyou promised me that there should be nothing more about Bozzle. I\nexpect you to put that rascal, and all that he has told you, out of\nyour head altogether. You are bound to do so for my sake, and you\nwill be very wise to do so for your own.\"\n\n\"I was obliged to see him when he came.\"\n\n\"Yes, and to pay him, I do not doubt. But that is all done, and\nshould be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I can't forget it. Is it true or untrue that he found that man down\nthere? Is it true or untrue that my wife received Colonel Osborne at\nyour mother's house? Is it true or untrue that Colonel Osborne went\ndown there with the express object of seeing her? Is it true or\nuntrue that they had corresponded? It is nonsense to bid me to forget\nall this. You might as well ask me to forget that I had desired her\nneither to write to him, nor to see him.\"\n\n\"If I understand the matter,\" said Trevelyan, \"you are incorrect in\none of your assertions.\"\n\n\"In which?\"\n\n\"You must excuse me if I am wrong, Trevelyan; but I don't think you\never did tell your wife not to see this man, or not to write to him?\"\n\n\"I never told her! I don't understand what you mean.\"\n\n\"Not in so many words. It is my belief that she has endeavoured to\nobey implicitly every clear instruction that you have given her.\"\n\n\"You are wrong;--absolutely and altogether wrong. Heaven and earth!\nDo you mean to tell me now, after all that has taken place, that she\ndid not know my wishes?\"\n\n\"I have not said that. But you have chosen to place her in such a\nposition, that though your word would go for much with her, she\ncannot bring herself to respect your wishes.\"\n\n\"And you call that being dutiful and affectionate!\"\n\n\"I call it human and reasonable; and I think that it is compatible\nwith duty and affection. Have you consulted her wishes?\"\n\n\"Always!\"\n\n\"Consult them now then, and bid her come back to you.\"\n\n\"No;--never! As far as I can see, I will never do so. The moment she\nis away from me this man goes to her, and she receives him. She must\nhave known that she was wrong,--and you must know it.\"\n\n\"I do not think that she is half so wrong as you yourself,\" said\nStanbury. To this Trevelyan made no answer, and they both remained\nsilent some minutes. Stanbury had a communication to make before he\nwent, but it was one which he wished to delay as long as there was a\nchance that his friend's heart might be softened;--one which he need\nnot make if Trevelyan would consent to receive his wife back to his\nhouse. There was the day's paper lying on the table, and Stanbury had\ntaken it up and was reading it,--or pretending to read it.\n\n\"I will tell you what I propose to do,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"It is best both for her and for me that we should be apart.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand how you can be so mad as to say so.\"\n\n\"You don't understand what I feel. Heaven and earth! To have a man\ncoming and going--. But, never mind. You do not see it, and nothing\nwill make you see it. And there is no reason why you should.\"\n\n\"I certainly do not see it. I do not believe that your wife cares\nmore for Colonel Osborne, except as an old friend of her father's,\nthan she does for the fellow that sweeps the crossing. It is a matter\nin which I am bound to tell you what I think.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now, if you have freed your mind, I will tell you my\npurpose. I am bound to do so, because your people are concerned in\nit. I shall go abroad.\"\n\n\"And leave her in England?\"\n\n\"Certainly. She will be safer here than she can be abroad,--unless\nshe should choose to go back with her father to the islands.\"\n\n\"And take the boy?\"\n\n\"No;--I could not permit that. What I intend is this. I will give\nher \u00c2\u00a3800 a year, as long as I have reason to believe that she has no\ncommunication whatever, either by word of mouth or by letter, with\nthat man. If she does, I will put the case immediately into the hands\nof my lawyer, with instructions to him to ascertain from counsel what\nseverest steps I can take.\"\n\n\"How I hate that word severe, when applied to a woman.\"\n\n\"I dare say you do,--when applied to another man's wife. But there\nwill be no severity in my first proposition. As for the child,--if\nI approve of the place in which she lives, as I do at present,--he\nshall remain with her for nine months in the year till he is\nsix years old. Then he must come to me. And he shall come to me\naltogether if she sees or hears from that man. I believe that \u00c2\u00a3800\na year will enable her to live with all comfort under your mother's\nroof.\"\n\n\"As to that,\" said Stanbury, slowly, \"I suppose I had better tell you\nat once, that the Nuncombe Putney arrangement cannot be considered as\npermanent.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because my mother is timid and nervous, and altogether unused to the\nworld.\"\n\n\"That unfortunate woman is to be sent away,--even from Nuncombe\nPutney!\"\n\n\"Understand me, Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"I understand you. I understand you most thoroughly. Nor do I wonder\nat it in the least. Do not suppose that I am angry with your mother,\nor with you, or with your sister. I have no right to expect that they\nshould keep her after that man has made his way into their house. I\ncan well conceive that no honest, high-minded lady would do so.\"\n\n\"It is not that at all.\"\n\n\"But it is that. How can you tell me that it isn't? And yet you would\nhave me believe that I am not disgraced!\" As he said this Trevelyan\ngot up, and walked about the room, tearing his hair with his hands.\nHe was in truth a wretched man, from whose mind all expectation of\nhappiness was banished, who regarded his own position as one of\nincurable ignominy, looking upon himself as one who had been made\nunfit for society by no fault of his own. What was he to do with the\nwretched woman who could be kept from the evil of her pernicious\nvanity by no gentle custody, whom no most distant retirement\nwould make safe from the effects of her own ignorance, folly, and\nobstinacy? \"When is she to go?\" he asked in a low, sepulchral\ntone,--as though these new tidings that had come upon him had been\nfatal--laden with doom, and finally subversive of all chance even of\ntranquillity.\n\n\"When you and she may please.\"\n\n\"That is all very well;--but let me know the truth. I would not have\nyour mother's house--contaminated; but may she remain there for a\nweek?\"\n\nStanbury jumped from his seat with an oath. \"I tell you what it\nis, Trevelyan;--if you speak of your wife in that way, I will not\nlisten to you. It is unmanly and untrue to say that her presence\ncan--contaminate any house.\"\n\n\"That is very fine. It may be chivalrous in you to tell me on her\nbehalf that I am a liar,--and that I am not a man.\"\n\n\"You drive me to it.\"\n\n\"But what am I to think when you are forced to declare that this\nunfortunate woman can not be allowed to remain at your mother's\nhouse,--a house which has been especially taken with reference to a\nshelter for her? She has been received,--with the idea that she would\nbe discreet. She has been indiscreet, past belief, and she is to be\nturned out,--most deservedly. Heaven and earth! Where shall I find\na roof for her head?\" Trevelyan as he said this was walking about\nthe room with his hands stretched up towards the ceiling; and as\nhis friend was attempting to make him comprehend that there was no\nintention on the part of any one to banish Mrs. Trevelyan from the\nClock House, at least for some months to come,--not even till after\nChristmas unless some satisfactory arrangement could be sooner\nmade,--the door of the room was opened by the boy, who called himself\na clerk, and who acted as Trevelyan's servant in the chambers, and\na third person was shown into the room. That third person was Mr.\nBozzle. As no name was given, Stanbury did not at first know Mr.\nBozzle, but he had not had his eye on Mr. Bozzle for half a minute\nbefore he recognised the ex-policeman by the outward attributes\nand signs of his profession. \"Oh, is that you, Mr. Bozzle?\" said\nTrevelyan, as soon as the great man had made his bow of salutation.\n\"Well;--what is it?\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: That third person was Mr. Bozzle.]\n\n\n\"Mr. Hugh Stanbury, I think,\" said Bozzle, making another bow to the\nyoung barrister.\n\n\"That's my name,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Exactly so, Mr. S. The identity is one as I could prove on oath in\nany court in England. You was on the railway platform at Exeter on\nSaturday when we was waiting for the 12 express 'buss;--wasn't you\nnow, Mr. S.?\"\n\n\"What's that to you?\"\n\n\"Well;--as it do happen, it is something to me. And, Mr. S., if you\nwas asked that question in hany court in England or before even one\nof the metropolitan bekes, you wouldn't deny it.\"\n\n\"Why the devil should I deny it? What's all this about, Trevelyan?\"\n\n\"Of course you can't deny it, Mr. S. When I'm down on a fact, I am\ndown on it. Nothing else wouldn't do in my profession.\"\n\n\"Have you anything to say to me, Mr. Bozzle?\" asked Trevelyan.\n\n\"Well;--I have; just a word.\"\n\n\"About your journey to Devonshire?\"\n\n\"Well;--in a way it is about my journey to Devonshire. It's all along\nof the same job, Mr. Trewillian.\"\n\n\"You can speak before my friend here,\" said Trevelyan. Bozzle had\ntaken a great dislike to Hugh Stanbury, regarding the barrister with\na correct instinct as one who was engaged for the time in the same\nservice with himself, and who was his rival in that service. When\nthus instigated to make as it were a party of three in this delicate\nand most confidential matter, and to take his rival into his\nconfidence, he shook his head slowly and looked Trevelyan hard in the\nface,--\"Mr. Stanbury is my particular friend,\" said Trevelyan, \"and\nknows well the circumstances of this unfortunate affair. You can say\nanything before him.\"\n\nBozzle shook his head again. \"I'd rayther not, Mr. Trewillian,\" said\nhe. \"Indeed I'd rayther not. It's something very particular.\"\n\n\"If you take my advice,\" said Stanbury, \"you will not hear him\nyourself.\"\n\n\"That's your advice, Mr. S.?\" asked Mr. Bozzle.\n\n\"Yes;--that's my advice. I'd never have anything to do with such a\nfellow as you as long as I could help it.\"\n\n\"I dare say not, Mr. S.; I dare say not. We're hexpensive, and we're\nhaccurate;--neither of which is much in your line, Mr. S., if I\nunderstand about it rightly.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bozzle, if you've got anything to tell, tell it,\" said Trevelyan\nangrily.\n\n\"A third party is so objectionable,\" pleaded Bozzle.\n\n\"Never mind. That is my affair.\"\n\n\"It is your affair, Mr. Trewillian. There's not a doubt of that. The\nlady is your wife.\"\n\n\"Damnation!\" shouted Trevelyan.\n\n\"But the credit, sir,\" said Bozzle. \"The credit is mine. And here\nis Mr. S. has been down a interfering with me, and doing no 'varsal\ngood, as I'll undertake to prove by evidence before the affair is\nover.\"\n\n\"The affair is over,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"That's as you think, Mr. S. That's where your information goes to,\nMr. S. Mine goes a little beyond that, Mr. S. I've means as you can\nknow nothing about, Mr. S. I've irons in the fire, what you're as\nignorant on as the babe as isn't born.\"\n\n\"No doubt you have, Mr. Bozzle,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"I has. And now if it be that I must speak before a third party, Mr.\nTrewillian, I'm ready. It ain't that I'm no ways ashamed. I've done\nmy duty, and knows how to do it. And let a counsel be ever so sharp,\nI never yet was so 'posed but what I could stand up and hold my own.\nThe Colonel, Mr. Trewillian, got,--a letter,--from your lady,--this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Stanbury, sharply.\n\n\"Very likely not, Mr. S. It ain't in my power to say anything\nwhatever about you believing or not believing. But Mr. T.'s lady\nhas wrote the letter; and the Colonel,--he has received it. You\ndon't look after these things, Mr. S. You don't know the ways of\n'em. But it's my business. The lady has wrote the letter, and the\nColonel,--why, he has received it.\" Trevelyan had become white with\nrage when Bozzle first mentioned this continued correspondence\nbetween his wife and Colonel Osborne. It never occurred to him to\ndoubt the correctness of the policeman's information, and he regarded\nStanbury's assertion of incredulity as being simply of a piece with\nhis general obstinacy in the matter. At this moment he began to\nregret that he had called in the assistance of his friend, and that\nhe had not left the affair altogether in the hands of that much more\nsatisfactory, but still more painful, agent, Mr. Bozzle. He had again\nseated himself, and for a moment or two remained silent on his chair.\n\"It ain't my fault, Mr. Trewillian,\" continued Bozzle, \"if this\nlittle matter oughtn't never to have been mentioned before a third\nparty.\"\n\n\"It is of no moment,\" said Trevelyan, in a low voice. \"What does it\nsignify who knows it now?\"\n\n\"Do not believe it, Trevelyan,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. S. Very well. Just as you like. Don't believe it.\nOnly it's true, and it's my business to find them things out. It's\nmy business, and I finds 'em out. Mr. Trewillian can do as he likes\nabout it. If it's right, why, then it is right. It ain't for me to\nsay nothing about that. But there's the fact. The lady, she has wrote\nanother letter; and the Colonel,--why, he has received it. There\nain't nothing wrong about the post-office. If I was to say what was\ninside of that billydou,--why, then I should be proving what I didn't\nknow; and when it came to standing up in court, I shouldn't be able\nto hold my own. But as for the letter, the lady wrote it, and the\nColonel,--he received it.\"\n\n\"That will do, Mr. Bozzle,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"Shall I call again, Mr. Trewillian?\"\n\n\"No;--yes. I'll send to you, when I want you. You shall hear from\nme.\"\n\n\"I suppose I'd better be keeping my eyes open about the Colonel's\nplace, Mr. Trewillian?\"\n\n\"For God's sake, Trevelyan, do not have anything more to do with this\nman!\"\n\n\"That's all very well for you, Mr. S.,\" said Bozzle. \"The lady ain't\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"Can you imagine anything more disgraceful than all this?\" said\nStanbury.\n\n\"Nothing; nothing; nothing!\" answered Trevelyan.\n\n\"And I'm to keep stirring, and be on the move?\" again suggested\nBozzle, who prudently required to be fortified by instructions before\nhe devoted his time and talents even to so agreeable a pursuit as\nthat in which he had been engaged.\n\n\"You shall hear from me,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"Very well;--very well. I wish you good-day, Mr. Trewillian. Mr. S.,\nyours most obedient. There was one other point, Mr. Trewillian.\"\n\n\"What point?\" asked Trevelyan, angrily.\n\n\"If the lady was to join the Colonel--\"\n\n\"That will do, Mr. Bozzle,\" said Trevelyan, again jumping up from\nhis chair. \"That will do.\" So saying, he opened the door, and Bozzle,\nwith a bow, took his departure. \"What on earth am I to do? How am I\nto save her?\" said the wretched husband, appealing to his friend.\n\nStanbury endeavoured with all his eloquence to prove that this latter\npiece of information from the spy must be incorrect. If such a letter\nhad been written by Mrs. Trevelyan to Colonel Osborne, it must have\nbeen done while he, Stanbury, was staying at the Clock House. This\nseemed to him to be impossible; but he could hardly explain why\nit should be impossible. She had written to the man before, and\nhad received him when he came to Nuncombe Putney. Why was it even\nimprobable that she should have written to him again? Nevertheless,\nStanbury felt sure that she had sent no such letter. \"I think I\nunderstand her feelings and her mind,\" said he; \"and if so, any such\ncorrespondence would be incompatible with her previous conduct.\"\nTrevelyan only smiled at this,--or pretended to smile. He would\nnot discuss the question; but believed implicitly what Bozzle had\ntold him in spite of all Stanbury's arguments. \"I can say nothing\nfurther,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"No, my dear fellow. There is nothing further to be said, except\nthis, that I will have my unfortunate wife removed from the decent\nprotection of your mother's roof with the least possible delay. I\nfeel that I owe Mrs. Stanbury the deepest apology for having sent\nsuch an inmate to trouble her repose.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"That is what I feel.\"\n\n\"And I say that it is nonsense. If you had never sent that wretched\nblackguard down to fabricate lies at Nuncombe Putney, my mother's\nrepose would have been all right. As it is, Mrs. Trevelyan can remain\nwhere she is till after Christmas. There is not the least necessity\nfor removing her at once. I only meant to say that the arrangement\nshould not be regarded as altogether permanent. I must go to my work\nnow. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Stanbury.\"\n\nStanbury paused at the door, and then once more turned round. \"I\nsuppose it is of no use my saying anything further; but I wish you to\nunderstand fully that I regard your wife as a woman much ill-used,\nand I think you are punishing her, and yourself, too, with a cruel\nseverity for an indiscretion of the very slightest kind.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nMR. TREVELYAN'S LETTER TO HIS WIFE.\n\n\nTrevelyan, when he was left alone, sat for above a couple of hours\ncontemplating the misery of his position, and endeavouring to teach\nhimself by thinking what ought to be his future conduct. It never\noccurred to him during these thoughts that it would be well that he\nshould at once take back his wife, either as a matter of duty, or of\nwelfare, for himself or for her. He had taught himself to believe\nthat she had disgraced him; and, though this feeling of disgrace\nmade him so wretched that he wished that he were dead, he would\nallow himself to make no attempt at questioning the correctness of\nhis conviction. Though he were to be shipwrecked for ever, even\nthat seemed to be preferable to supposing that he had been wrong.\nNevertheless, he loved his wife dearly, and, in the white heat of his\nanger endeavoured to be merciful to her. When Stanbury accused him\nof severity, he would not condescend to defend himself; but he told\nhimself then of his great mercy. Was he not as fond of his own boy\nas any other father, and had he not allowed her to take the child\nbecause he had felt that a mother's love was more imperious, more\ncraving in its nature, than the love of a father? Had that been\nsevere? And had he not resolved to allow her every comfort which\nher unfortunate position,--the self-imposed misfortune of her\nposition,--would allow her to enjoy? She had come to him without\na shilling; and yet, bad as her treatment of him had been, he was\nwilling to give enough not only to support her, but her sister also,\nwith every comfort. Severe! No; that, at least, was an undeserved\naccusation. He had been anything but severe. Foolish he might have\nbeen, in taking a wife from a home in which she had been unable to\nlearn the discretion of a matron; too trusting he had been, and too\ngenerous,--but certainly not severe. But, of course, as he said to\nhimself, a young man like Stanbury would take the part of a woman\nwith whose sister he was in love. Then he turned his thoughts upon\nBozzle, and there came over him a crushing feeling of ignominy,\nshame, moral dirt, and utter degradation, as he reconsidered his\ndealings with that ingenious gentleman. He was paying a rogue to\nwatch the steps of a man whom he hated, to pry into the home secrets,\nto read the letters, to bribe the servants, to record the movements\nof this rival, this successful rival, in his wife's affections! It\nwas a filthy thing,--and yet what could he do? Gentlemen of old, his\nown grandfather, or his father, would have taken such a fellow as\nColonel Osborne by the throat and have caned him, and afterwards\nwould have shot him, or have stood to be shot. All that was changed\nnow,--but it was not his fault that it was changed. He was willing\nenough to risk his life, could any opportunity of risking it in this\ncause be obtained for him. But were he to cudgel Colonel Osborne,\nhe would be simply arrested, and he would then be told that he had\ndisgraced himself foully by striking a man old enough to be his\nfather!\n\nHow was he to have avoided the employment of some such man as Bozzle?\nHe had also employed a gentleman, his friend, Stanbury; and what was\nthe result? The facts were not altered. Even Stanbury did not attempt\nto deny that there had been a correspondence, and that there had been\na visit. But Stanbury was so blind to all impropriety, or pretended\nsuch blindness, that he defended that which all the world agreed\nin condemning. Of what use had Stanbury been to him? He had wanted\nfacts, not advice. Stanbury had found out no facts for him; but\nBozzle, either by fair means or foul, did get at the truth. He did\nnot doubt but that Bozzle was right about that letter written only\nyesterday, and received on that very morning. His wife, who had\nprobably been complaining of her wrongs to Stanbury, must have\nretired from that conversation to her chamber, and immediately have\nwritten this letter to her lover! With such a woman as that what can\nbe done in these days otherwise than by the aid of such a one as\nBozzle? He could not confine his wife in a dungeon. He could not\nsave himself from the disgrace of her misconduct, by any rigours of\nsurveillance on his own part. As wives are managed now-a-days, he\ncould not forbid to her the use of the post-office,--could not hinder\nher from seeing this hypocritical scoundrel, who carried on his\nwickedness under the false guise of family friendship. He had given\nher every chance to amend her conduct: but, if she were resolved\non disobedience, he had no means of enforcing obedience. The facts,\nhowever, it was necessary that he should know.\n\nAnd now, what should he do? How should he go to work to make her\nunderstand that she could not write even a letter without his knowing\nit; and that if she did either write to the man or see him he would\nimmediately take the child from her, and provide for her only in such\nfashion as the law should demand from him? For himself, and for his\nown life, he thought that he had determined what he would do. It was\nimpossible that he should continue to live in London. He was ashamed\nto enter a club. He had hardly a friend to whom it was not an agony\nto speak. They who knew him, knew also of his disgrace, and no longer\nasked him to their houses. For days past he had eaten alone, and sat\nalone, and walked alone. All study was impossible to him. No pursuit\nwas open to him. He spent his time in thinking of his wife, and of\nthe disgrace which she had brought upon him. Such a life as this, he\nknew, was unmanly and shameful, and it was absolutely necessary for\nhim that he should in some way change it. He would go out of England,\nand would travel,--if only he could so dispose of his wife that she\nmight be safe from any possible communication with Colonel Osborne.\nIf that could be effected, nothing that money could do should be\nspared for her. If that could not be effected he would remain at\nhome,--and crush her.\n\nThat night before he went to bed he wrote a letter to his wife, which\nwas as follows;--\n\n\n   DEAR EMILY,\n\n   I have learned, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that you\n   have corresponded with Colonel Osborne since you have been\n   at Nuncombe Putney, and also that you have seen him there.\n   This has been done in direct opposition to my expressed\n   wishes, and I feel myself compelled to tell you that such\n   conduct is disgraceful to you, and disgracing to me. I am\n   quite at a loss to understand how you can reconcile to\n   yourself so flagrant a disobedience of my instructions,\n   and so perverse a disregard to the opinion of the world at\n   large.\n\n   But I do not write now for the sake of finding fault with\n   you. It is too late for me to have any hope that I can do\n   so with good effect, either as regards your credit or my\n   happiness. Nevertheless, it is my duty to protect both you\n   and myself from further shame; and I wish to tell you what\n   are my intentions with that view. In the first place, I\n   warn you that I keep a watch on you. The doing so is very\n   painful to me, but it is absolutely necessary. You cannot\n   see Colonel Osborne, or write to him, without my knowing\n   it. I pledge you my word that in either case,--that is, if\n   you correspond with him or see him,--I will at once take\n   our boy away from you. I will not allow him to remain,\n   even with a mother, who shall so misconduct herself.\n   Should Colonel Osborne address a letter to you, I desire\n   that you will put it under an envelope addressed to me.\n\n   If you obey my commands on this head I will leave our boy\n   with you nine months out of every year till he shall be\n   six years old. Such, at least, is my present idea, though\n   I will not positively bind myself to adhere to it. And I\n   will allow you \u00c2\u00a3800 per year for your own maintenance and\n   that of your sister. I am greatly grieved to find from\n   my friend Mr. Stanbury that your conduct in reference to\n   Colonel Osborne has been such as to make it necessary that\n   you should leave Mrs. Stanbury's house. I do not wonder\n   that it should be so. I shall immediately seek for a\n   future home for you, and when I have found one that is\n   suitable, I will have you conveyed to it.\n\n   I must now further explain my purposes,--and I must beg\n   you to remember that I am driven to do so by your direct\n   disobedience to my expressed wishes. Should there be any\n   further communication between you and Colonel Osborne,\n   not only will I take your child away from you, but I will\n   also limit the allowance to be made to you to a bare\n   sustenance. In such case, I shall put the matter into the\n   hands of a lawyer, and shall probably feel myself driven\n   to take steps towards freeing myself from a connection\n   which will be disgraceful to my name.\n\n   For myself, I shall live abroad during the greater part of\n   the year. London has become to me uninhabitable, and all\n   English pleasures are distasteful.\n\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   LOUIS TREVELYAN.\n\n\nWhen he had finished this he read it twice, and believed that he had\nwritten, if not an affectionate, at any rate a considerate letter.\nHe had no bounds to the pity which he felt for himself in reference\nto the injury which was being done to him, and he thought that the\noffers which he was making, both in respect to his child and the\nmoney, were such as to entitle him to his wife's warmest gratitude.\nHe hardly recognised the force of the language which he used when he\ntold her that her conduct was disgraceful, and that she had disgraced\nhis name. He was quite unable to look at the whole question between\nhim and his wife from her point of view. He conceived it possible\nthat such a woman as his wife should be told that her conduct would\nbe watched, and that she should be threatened with the Divorce Court,\nwith an effect that should, upon the whole, be salutary. There\nbe men, and not bad men either, and men neither uneducated, or\nunintelligent, or irrational in ordinary matters, who seem to be\nabsolutely unfitted by nature to have the custody or guardianship of\nothers. A woman in the hands of such a man can hardly save herself or\nhim from endless trouble. It may be that between such a one and his\nwife, events shall flow on so evenly that no ruling, no constraint\nis necessary,--that even the giving of advice is never called for\nby the circumstances of the day. If the man be happily forced to\nlabour daily for his living till he be weary, and the wife be laden\nwith many ordinary cares, the routine of life may run on without\nstorms;--but for such a one, if he be without work, the management\nof a wife will be a task full of peril. The lesson may be learned at\nlast; he may after years come to perceive how much and how little of\nguidance the partner of his life requires at his hands; and he may be\ntaught how that guidance should be given;--but in the learning of the\nlesson there will be sorrow and gnashing of teeth. It was so now with\nthis man. He loved his wife. To a certain extent he still trusted\nher. He did not believe that she would be faithless to him after the\nfashion of women who are faithless altogether. But he was jealous of\nauthority, fearful of slights, self-conscious, afraid of the world,\nand utterly ignorant of the nature of a woman's mind.\n\nHe carried the letter with him in his pocket throughout the next\nmorning, and in the course of the day he called upon Lady Milborough.\nThough he was obstinately bent on acting in accordance with his own\nviews, yet he was morbidly desirous of discussing the grievousness of\nhis position with his friends. He went to Lady Milborough, asking for\nher advice, but desirous simply of being encouraged by her to do that\nwhich he was resolved to do on his own judgment.\n\n\"Down,--after her,--to Nuncombe Putney!\" said Lady Milborough,\nholding up both her hands.\n\n\"Yes; he has been there. And she has been weak enough to see him.\"\n\n\"My dear Louis, take her to Naples at once,--at once.\"\n\n\"It is too late for that now, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"Too late! Oh, no. She has been foolish, indiscreet,\ndisobedient,--what you will of that kind. But, Louis, don't send her\naway; don't send your young wife away from you. Those whom God has\njoined together, let no man put asunder.\"\n\n\"I cannot consent to live with a wife with whom neither my wishes\nnor my word have the slightest effect. I may believe of her what I\nplease, but, think what the world will believe! I cannot disgrace\nmyself by living with a woman who persists in holding intercourse\nwith a man whom the world speaks of as her lover.\"\n\n\"Take her to Naples,\" said Lady Milborough, with all the energy of\nwhich she was capable.\n\n\"I can take her nowhere, nor will I see her, till she has given proof\nthat her whole conduct towards me has been altered. I have written a\nletter to her, and I have brought it. Will you excuse me if I ask you\nto take the trouble to read it?\"\n\nThen he handed Lady Milborough the letter, which she read very\nslowly, and with much care.\n\n\"I don't think I would--would--would--\"\n\n\"Would what?\" demanded Trevelyan.\n\n\"Don't you think that what you say is a little,--just a little prone\nto make,--to make the breach perhaps wider?\"\n\n\"No, Lady Milborough. In the first place, how can it be wider?\"\n\n\"You might take her back, you know; and then if you could only get to\nNaples!\"\n\n\"How can I take her back while she is corresponding with this man?\"\n\n\"She wouldn't correspond with him at Naples.\"\n\nTrevelyan shook his head and became cross. His old friend would not\nat all do as old friends are expected to do when called upon for\nadvice.\n\n\"I think,\" said he, \"that what I have proposed is both just and\ngenerous.\"\n\n\"But, Louis, why should there be any separation?\"\n\n\"She has forced it upon me. She is headstrong, and will not be\nruled.\"\n\n\"But this about disgracing you. Do you think that you must say that?\"\n\n\"I think I must, because it is true. If I do not tell her the truth,\nwho is there that will do so? It may be bitter now, but I think that\nit is for her welfare.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear!\"\n\n\"I want nothing for myself, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that, Louis.\"\n\n\"My whole happiness was in my home. No man cared less for going out\nthan I did. My child and my wife were everything to me. I don't\nsuppose that I was ever seen at a club in the evening once throughout\na season. And she might have had anything that she liked,--anything!\nIt is hard, Lady Milborough; is it not?\"\n\nLady Milborough, who had seen the angry brow, did not dare to suggest\nNaples again. But yet, if any word might be spoken to prevent this\nutter wreck of a home, how good a thing it would be! He had got up to\nleave her, but she stopped him by holding his hand. \"For better, for\nworse, Louis; remember that.\"\n\n\"Why has she forgotten it?\"\n\n\"She is flesh of your flesh, bone of your bone. And for the boy's\nsake! Think of your boy, Louis. Do not send that letter. Sleep on it,\nLouis, and think of it.\"\n\n\"I have slept on it.\"\n\n\"There is no promise in it of forgiveness after a while. It is\nwritten as though you intended that she should never come back to\nyou.\"\n\n\"That shall be as she behaves herself.\"\n\n\"But tell her so. Let there be some one bright spot in what you say\nto her, on which her mind may fix itself. If she be not altogether\nhardened, that letter will drive her to despair.\"\n\nBut Trevelyan would not give up the letter, nor indicate by a word\nthat he would reconsider the question of its propriety. He escaped as\nsoon as he could from Lady Milborough's room, and almost declared as\nhe did so, that he would never enter her doors again. She had utterly\nfailed to see the matter in the proper light. When she talked of\nNaples she must surely have been unable to comprehend the extent\nof the ill-usage to which he, the husband, had been subjected. How\nwas it possible that he should live under the same roof with a wife\nwho claimed to herself the right of receiving visitors of whom he\ndisapproved,--a visitor,--a gentleman,--one whom the world called her\nlover? He gnashed his teeth and clenched his fist as he thought of\nhis old friend's ignorance of the very first law in a married man's\ncode of laws.\n\nBut yet when he was out in the streets he did not post his letter at\nonce; but thought of it throughout the whole day, trying to prove\nthe weight of every phrase that he had used. Once or twice his heart\nalmost relented. Once he had the letter in his hand, that he might\ntear it. But he did not tear it. He put it back into his pocket, and\nthought again of his grievance. Surely it was his first duty in such\nan emergency to be firm!\n\nIt was certainly a wretched life that he was leading. In the evening\nhe went all alone to an eating-house for his dinner, and then,\nsitting with a miserable glass of sherry before him, he again read\nand re-read the epistle which he had written. Every harsh word that\nit contained was, in some sort, pleasant to his ear. She had hit\nhim hard, and should he not hit her again? And then, was it not his\nbounden duty to let her know the truth? Yes; it was his duty to be\nfirm.\n\nSo he went out and posted the letter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nGREAT TRIBULATION.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nTrevelyan's letter to his wife fell like a thunderbolt among them at\nNuncombe Putney. Mrs. Trevelyan was altogether unable to keep it to\nherself;--indeed she made no attempt at doing so. Her husband had\ntold her that she was to be banished from the Clock House because her\npresent hostess was unable to endure her misconduct, and of course\nshe demanded the reasons of the charge that was thus brought against\nher. When she first read the letter, which she did in the presence of\nher sister, she towered in her passion.\n\n\"Disgraced him! I have never disgraced him. It is he that has\ndisgraced me. Correspondence! Yes;--he shall see it all. Unjust,\nignorant, foolish man! He does not remember that the last\ninstructions he really gave me, were to bid me see Colonel Osborne.\nTake my boy away! Yes. Of course, I am a woman and must suffer. I\nwill write to Colonel Osborne, and will tell him the truth, and will\nsend my letter to Louis. He shall know how he has ill-treated me! I\nwill not take a penny of his money;--not a penny. Maintain you! I\nbelieve he thinks that we are beggars. Leave this house because of my\nconduct! What can Mrs. Stanbury have said? What can any of them have\nsaid? I will demand to be told. Free himself from the connection!\nOh, Nora, Nora! that it should come to this!--that I should be thus\nthreatened, who have been as innocent as a baby! If it were not for\nmy child, I think that I should destroy myself!\"\n\nNora said what she could to comfort her sister, insisting chiefly on\nthe promise that the child should not be taken away. There was no\ndoubt as to the husband's power in the mind of either of them; and\nthough, as regarded herself, Mrs. Trevelyan would have defied her\nhusband, let his power be what it might, yet she acknowledged to\nherself that she was in some degree restrained by the fear that she\nwould find herself deprived of her only comfort.\n\n\"We must just go where he bids us,--till papa comes,\" said Nora.\n\n\"And when papa is here, what help will there be then? He will not let\nme go back to the islands,--with my boy. For myself I might die, or\nget out of his way anywhere. I can see that. Priscilla Stanbury is\nright when she says that no woman should trust herself to any man.\nDisgraced! That I should live to be told by my husband that I had\ndisgraced him,--by a lover!\"\n\nThere was some sort of agreement made between the two sisters as to\nthe manner in which Priscilla should be interrogated respecting the\nsentence of banishment which had been passed. They both agreed that\nit would be useless to make inquiry of Mrs. Stanbury. If anything had\nreally been said to justify the statement made in Mr. Trevelyan's\nletter, it must have come from Priscilla, and have reached Trevelyan\nthrough Priscilla's brother. They, both of them, had sufficiently\nlearned the ways of the house to be sure that Mrs. Stanbury had not\nbeen the person active in the matter. They went down, therefore,\ntogether, and found Priscilla seated at her desk in the parlour.\nMrs. Stanbury was also in the room, and it had been presumed between\nthe sisters that the interrogations should be made in that lady's\nabsence; but Mrs. Trevelyan was too hot in the matter for restraint,\nand she at once opened out her budget of grievance.\n\n\"I have a letter from my husband,\" she said,--and then paused. But\nPriscilla, seeing from the fire in her eyes that she was much moved,\nmade no reply, but turned to listen to what might further be said. \"I\ndo not know why I should trouble you with his suspicions,\" continued\nMrs. Trevelyan, \"or read to you what he says about--Colonel Osborne.\"\nAs she spoke she was holding her husband's letter open in her\nhands. \"There is nothing in it that you do not know. He says\nI have corresponded with him. So I have;--and he shall see the\ncorrespondence. He says that Colonel Osborne visited me. He did come\nto see me and Nora.\"\n\n\"As any other old man might have done,\" said Nora.\n\n\"It was not likely that I should openly confess myself to be afraid\nto see my father's old friend. But the truth is, my husband does not\nknow what a woman is.\"\n\nShe had begun by declaring that she would not trouble her friend with\nany statement of her husband's complaints against her; but now she\nhad made her way to the subject, and could hardly refrain herself.\nPriscilla understood this, and thought that it would be wise to\ninterrupt her by a word that might bring her back to her original\npurpose. \"Is there anything,\" said she, \"which we can do to help\nyou?\"\n\n\"To help me? No;--God only can help me. But Louis informs me that I\nam to be turned out of this house, because you demand that we should\ngo.\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" exclaimed Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"My husband. Listen; this is what he says:--'I am greatly grieved to\nhear from my friend Mr. Stanbury that your conduct in reference to\nColonel Osborne has been such as to make it necessary that you should\nleave Mrs. Stanbury's house.' Is that true? Is that true?\" In her\ngeneral mode of carrying herself, and of enduring the troubles of\nher life, Mrs. Trevelyan was a strong woman; but now her grief was\ntoo much for her, and she burst out into tears. \"I am the most\nunfortunate woman that ever was born!\" she sobbed out through her\ntears.\n\n\"I never said that you were to go,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"But your son has told Mr. Trevelyan that we must go,\" said Nora,\nwho felt that her sense of injury against Hugh Stanbury was greatly\nincreased by what had taken place. To her mind he was the person most\nimportant in the matter. Why had he desired that they should be sent\naway from the Clock House? She was very angry with him, and declared\nto herself that she hated him with all her heart. For this man she\nhad sent away that other lover,--a lover who had really loved her!\nAnd she had even confessed that it was so!\n\n\"There is a misunderstanding about this,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"It must be with your brother, then,\" said Nora.\n\n\"I think not,\" said Priscilla. \"I think that it has been with Mr.\nTrevelyan.\" Then she went on to explain, with much difficulty,\nbut still with a slow distinctness that was peculiar to her, what\nhad really taken place. \"We have endeavoured,\" she said, \"to show\nyou,--my mother and I,--that we have not misjudged you; but it\nis certainly true that I told my brother that I did not think\nthe arrangement a good one,--quite as a permanence.\" It was very\ndifficult, and her cheeks were red as she spoke, and her lips\nfaltered. It was an exquisite pain to her to have to give the pain\nwhich her words would convey; but there was no help for it,--as she\nsaid to herself more than once at the time,--there was nothing to be\ndone but to tell the truth.\n\n\"I never said so,\" blurted out Mrs. Stanbury, with her usual\nweakness.\n\n\"No, mother. It was my saying. In discussing what was best for us\nall, with Hugh, I told him,--what I have just now explained.\"\n\n\"Then of course we must go,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, who had gulped down\nher sobs and was resolved to be firm,--to give way to no more tears,\nto bear all without sign of womanly weakness.\n\n\"You will stay with us till your father comes,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Of course you will,\" said Mrs. Stanbury,--\"you and Nora. We have got\nto be such friends, now.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"As to friendship for me, it is out of\nthe question. We must pack up, Nora, and go somewhere. Heaven knows\nwhere!\"\n\nNora was now sobbing. \"Why your brother--should want to turn us\nout,--after he has sent us here--!\"\n\n\"My brother wants nothing of the kind,\" said Priscilla. \"Your sister\nhas no better friend than my brother.\"\n\n\"It will be better, Nora, to discuss the matter no further,\" said\nMrs. Trevelyan. \"We must go away,--somewhere; and the sooner the\nbetter. To be an unwelcome guest is always bad; but to be unwelcome\nfor such a reason as this is terrible.\"\n\n\"There is no reason,\" said Mrs. Stanbury; \"indeed there is none.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Trevelyan will understand us better when she is less excited,\"\nsaid Priscilla. \"I am not surprised that she should be indignant now.\nI can only say again that we hope you will stay with us till Sir\nMarmaduke Rowley shall be in England.\"\n\n\"That is not what your brother means,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Nor is it what I mean,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan. \"Nora, we had better\ngo to our own room. I suppose I must write to my husband; indeed,\nof course I must, that I may send him--the correspondence. I fear\nI cannot walk out into the street, Mrs. Stanbury, and make you quit\nof me, till I hear from him. And if I were to go to an inn at once,\npeople would speak evil of me;--and I have no money.\"\n\n\"My dear, how can you think of such a thing!\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"But you may be quite sure that we shall be gone within three\ndays,--or four at the furthest. Indeed, I will pledge myself not to\nremain longer than that,--even though I should have to go to the\npoor-house. Neither I nor my sister will stay in any family,--to\ncontaminate it. Come, Nora.\" And so speaking she sailed out of the\nroom, and her sister followed her.\n\n\"Why did you say anything about it? Oh dear, oh dear! why did you\nspeak to Hugh? See what you have done!\"\n\n\"I am sorry that I did speak,\" replied Priscilla slowly.\n\n\"Sorry! Of course you are sorry; but what good is that?\"\n\n\"But, mother, I do not think that I was wrong. I feel sure that the\nreal fault in all this is with Mr. Trevelyan, as it has been all\nthrough. He should not have written to her as he has done.\"\n\n\"I suppose Hugh did tell him.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--and I told Hugh; but not after the fashion in which he\nhas told her. I blame myself mostly for this,--that we ever consented\nto come to this house. We had no business here. Who is to pay the\nrent?\"\n\n\"Hugh insisted upon taking it.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and he will pay the rent; and we shall be a drag upon him, as\nthough he had been fool enough to have a wife and a family of his\nown. And what good have we done? We had not strength enough to say\nthat that wicked man should not see her when he came;--for he is a\nwicked man.\"\n\n\"If we had done that she would have been as bad then as she is now.\"\n\n\"Mother, we had no business to meddle either with her badness or\nher goodness. What had we to do with the wife of such a one as Mr.\nTrevelyan, or with any woman who was separated from her husband?\"\n\n\"It was Hugh who thought we should be of service to them.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and I do not blame him. He is in a position to be of service\nto people. He can do work and earn money, and has a right to think\nand to speak. We have a right to think only for ourselves, and we\nshould not have yielded to him. How are we to get back again out of\nthis house to our cottage?\"\n\n\"They are pulling the cottage down, Priscilla.\"\n\n\"To some other cottage, mother. Do you not feel while we are living\nhere that we are pretending to be what we are not? After all, Aunt\nStanbury was right, though it was not her business to meddle with us.\nWe should never have come here. That poor woman now regards us as her\nbitter enemies.\"\n\n\"I meant to do for the best,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"The fault was mine, mother.\"\n\n\"But you meant it for the best, my dear.\"\n\n\"Meaning for the best is trash. I don't know that I did mean it for\nthe best. While we were at the cottage we paid our way and were\nhonest. What is it people say of us now?\"\n\n\"They can't say any harm.\"\n\n\"They say that we are paid by the husband to keep his wife, and paid\nagain by the lover to betray the husband.\"\n\n\"Priscilla!\"\n\n\"Yes;--it is shocking enough. But that comes of people going out\nof their proper course. We were too humble and low to have a right\nto take any part in such a matter. How true it is that while one\ncrouches on the ground, one can never fall.\"\n\nThe matter was discussed in the Clock House all day, between Mrs.\nStanbury and Priscilla, and between Mrs. Trevelyan and Nora, in their\nrooms and in the garden; but nothing could come of such discussions.\nNo change could be made till further instructions should have been\nreceived from the angry husband; nor could any kind of argument be\neven invented by Priscilla which might be efficacious in inducing the\ntwo ladies to remain at the Clock House, even should Mr. Trevelyan\nallow them to do so. They all felt the intolerable injustice, as\nit appeared to them,--of their subjection to the caprice of an\nunreasonable and ill-conditioned man; but to all of them it seemed\nplain enough that in this matter the husband must exercise his own\nwill,--at any rate till Sir Marmaduke should be in England. There\nwere many difficulties throughout the day. Mrs. Trevelyan would not\ngo down to dinner, sending word that she was ill, and that she would,\nif she were allowed, have some tea in her own room. And Nora said\nthat she would remain with her sister. Priscilla went to them more\nthan once; and late in the evening they all met in the parlour. But\nany conversation seemed to be impossible; and Mrs. Trevelyan, as she\nwent up to her room at night, again declared that she would rid the\nhouse of her presence as soon as possible.\n\nOne thing, however, was done on that melancholy day. Mrs. Trevelyan\nwrote to her husband, and enclosed Colonel Osborne's letter to\nherself, and a copy of her reply. The reader will hardly require to\nbe told that no such further letter had been written by her as that\nof which Bozzle had given information to her husband. Men whose\nbusiness it is to detect hidden and secret things, are very apt to\ndetect things which have never been done. What excuse can a detective\nmake even to himself for his own existence if he can detect nothing?\nMr. Bozzle was an active-minded man, who gloried in detecting, and\nwho, in the special spirit of his trade, had taught himself to\nbelieve that all around him were things secret and hidden, which\nwould be within his power of unravelling if only the slightest clue\nwere put in his hand. He lived by the crookednesses of people, and\ntherefore was convinced that straight doings in the world were quite\nexceptional. Things dark and dishonest, fights fought and races run\nthat they might be lost, plants and crosses, women false to their\nhusbands, sons false to their fathers, daughters to their mothers,\nservants to their masters, affairs always secret, dark, foul, and\nfraudulent, were to him the normal condition of life. It was to be\npresumed that Mrs. Trevelyan should continue to correspond with her\nlover,--that old Mrs. Stanbury should betray her trust by conniving\nat the lover's visit,--that everybody concerned should be steeped to\nthe hips in lies and iniquity. When, therefore, he found at Colonel\nOsborne's rooms that the Colonel had received a letter with the\nLessboro' post-mark, addressed in the handwriting of a woman, he\ndid not scruple to declare that Colonel Osborne had received, on\nthat morning, a letter from Mr. Trevelyan's \"lady.\" But in sending\nto her husband what she called with so much bitterness, \"the\ncorrespondence,\" Mrs. Trevelyan had to enclose simply the copy of one\nsheet note from herself.\n\nBut she now wrote again to Colonel Osborne, and enclosed to her\nhusband, not a copy of what she had written, but the note itself. It\nwas as follows:--\n\n\n   Nuncombe Putney, Wednesday, August 10.\n\n   MY DEAR COLONEL OSBORNE,\n\n   My husband has desired me not to see you, or to write to\n   you, or to hear from you again. I must therefore beg you\n   to enable me to obey him,--at any rate till papa comes to\n   England.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   EMILY TREVELYAN.\n\n\nAnd then she wrote to her husband, and in the writing of this letter\nthere was much doubt, much labour, and many changes. We will give it\nas it was written when completed:--\n\n\n   I have received your letter, and will obey your commands\n   to the best of my power. In order that you may not be\n   displeased by any further unavoidable correspondence\n   between me and Colonel Osborne, I have written to him a\n   note, which I now send to you. I send it that you may\n   forward it. If you do not choose to do so, I cannot be\n   answerable either for his seeing me, or for his writing to\n   me again.\n\n   I send also copies of all the correspondence I have had\n   with Colonel Osborne since you turned me out of your\n   house. When he came to call on me, Nora remained with me\n   while he was here. I blush while I write this;--not for\n   myself, but that I should be so suspected as to make such\n   a statement necessary.\n\n   You say that I have disgraced you and myself. I have\n   done neither. I am disgraced;--but it is you that have\n   disgraced me. I have never spoken a word or done a thing,\n   as regards you, of which I have cause to be ashamed.\n\n   I have told Mrs. Stanbury that I and Nora will leave her\n   house as soon as we can be made to know where we are to\n   go. I beg that this may be decided instantly, as else we\n   must walk out into the street without a shelter. After\n   what has been said, I cannot remain here.\n\n   My sister bids me say that she will relieve you of all\n   burden respecting herself as soon as possible. She will\n   probably be able to find a home with my aunt, Mrs.\n   Outhouse, till papa comes to England. As for myself, I can\n   only say that till he comes, I shall do exactly what you\n   order.\n\n   EMILY TREVELYAN.\n\n   Nuncombe Putney, August 10.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nMR. AND MRS. OUTHOUSE.\n\n\nBoth Mr. Outhouse and his wife were especially timid in taking upon\nthemselves the cares of other people. Not on that account is it to be\nsupposed that they were bad or selfish. They were both given much to\ncharity, and bestowed both in time and money more than is ordinarily\nconsidered necessary, even from persons in their position. But what\nthey gave, they gave away from their own quiet hearth. Had money\nbeen wanting to the daughters of his wife's brother, Mr. Outhouse\nwould have opened such small coffer as he had with a free hand. But\nhe would have much preferred that his benevolence should be used\nin a way that would bring upon him no further responsibility and\nno questionings from people whom he did not know and could not\nunderstand.\n\nThe Rev. Oliphant Outhouse had been Rector of St.\nDiddulph's-in-the-East for the last fifteen years, having married\nthe sister of Sir Marmaduke Rowley,--then simply Mr. Rowley, with a\ncolonial appointment in Jamaica of \u00c2\u00a3120 per annum,--twelve years\nbefore his promotion, while he was a curate in one of the populous\nborough parishes. He had thus been a London clergyman all his life;\nbut he knew almost as little of London society as though he had held\na cure in a Westmoreland valley. He had worked hard, but his work had\nbeen altogether among the poor. He had no gift of preaching, and had\nacquired neither reputation nor popularity. But he could work;--and\nhaving been transferred because of that capability to the temporary\ncuracy of St. Diddulph's,--out of one diocese into another,--he had\nreceived the living from the bishop's hands when it became vacant.\n\nA dreary place was the parsonage of St. Diddulph's-in-the-East for\nthe abode of a gentleman. Mr. Outhouse had not, in his whole parish,\na parishioner with whom he could consort. The greatest men around\nhim were the publicans, and the most numerous were men employed in\nand around the docks. Dredgers of mud, navvies employed on suburban\ncanals, excavators, loaders and unloaders of cargo, cattle drivers,\nwhose driving, however, was done mostly on board ship,--such and\nsuch like were the men who were the fathers of the families of St.\nDiddulph's-in-the-East. And there was there, not far removed from the\nmuddy estuary of a little stream that makes its black way from the\nEssex marshes among the houses of the poorest of the poor into the\nThames, a large commercial establishment for turning the carcasses of\nhorses into manure. Messrs. Flowsem and Blurt were in truth the great\npeople of St. Diddulph's-in-the-East; but the closeness of their\nestablishment was not an additional attraction to the parsonage.\nThey were liberal, however, with their money, and Mr. Outhouse was\ndisposed to think,--custom perhaps having made the establishment\nless objectionable to him than it was at first,--that St.\nDiddulph's-in-the-East would be more of a Pandemonium than it now\nwas, if by any sanitary law Messrs. Flowsem and Blurt were compelled\nto close their doors. \"Non olet,\" he would say with a grim smile when\nthe charitable cheque of the firm would come punctually to hand on\nthe first Saturday after Christmas.\n\nBut such a house as his would be, as he knew, but a poor residence\nfor his wife's nieces. Indeed, without positively saying that he\nwas unwilling to receive them, he had, when he first heard of the\nbreaking up of the house in Curzon Street, shewn that he would rather\nnot take upon his shoulders so great a responsibility. He and his\nwife had discussed the matter between them, and had come to the\nconclusion that they did not know what kind of things might have been\ndone in Curzon Street. They would think no evil, they said; but the\nvery idea of a married woman with a lover was dreadful to them. It\nmight be that their niece was free from blame. They hoped so. And\neven though her sin had been of ever so deep a dye, they would take\nher in,--if it were indeed necessary. But they hoped that such help\nfrom them might not be needed. They both knew how to give counsel to\na poor woman, how to rebuke a poor man,--how to comfort, encourage,\nor to upbraid the poor. Practice had told them how far they might go\nwith some hope of doing good;--and at what stage of demoralisation\nno good from their hands was any longer within the scope of fair\nexpectation. But all this was among the poor. With what words to\nencourage such a one as their niece Mrs. Trevelyan,--to encourage her\nor to rebuke her, as her conduct might seem to make necessary,--they\nboth felt that they were altogether ignorant. To them Mrs. Trevelyan\nwas a fine lady. To Mr. Outhouse, Sir Marmaduke had ever been a fine\ngentleman, given much to worldly things, who cared more for whist and\na glass of wine than for anything else, and who thought that he had\na good excuse for never going to church in England because he was\ncalled upon, as he said, to show himself in the governor's pew always\nonce on Sundays, and frequently twice, when he was at the seat of his\ngovernment. Sir Marmaduke manifestly looked upon church as a thing\nin itself notoriously disagreeable. To Mr. Outhouse it afforded the\ngreat events of the week. And Mrs. Outhouse would declare that to\nhear her husband preach was the greatest joy of her life. It may\nbe understood therefore that though the family connection between\nthe Rowleys and the Outhouses had been kept up with a semblance of\naffection, it had never blossomed forth into cordial friendship.\n\nWhen therefore the clergyman of St. Diddulph's received a letter from\nhis niece, Nora, begging him to take her into his parsonage till Sir\nMarmaduke should arrive in the course of the spring, and hinting\nalso a wish that her uncle Oliphant should see Mr. Trevelyan and\nif possible arrange that his other niece should also come to the\nparsonage, he was very much perturbed in spirit. There was a long\nconsultation between him and his wife before anything could be\nsettled, and it may be doubted whether anything would have been\nsettled, had not Mr. Trevelyan himself made his way to the parsonage,\non the second day of the family conference. Mr. and Mrs. Outhouse had\nboth seen the necessity of sleeping upon the matter. They had slept\nupon it, and the discourse between them on the second day was so\ndoubtful in its tone that more sleeping would probably have been\nnecessary had not Mr. Trevelyan appeared and compelled them to a\ndecision.\n\n\"You must remember that I make no charge against her,\" said\nTrevelyan, after the matter had been discussed for about an hour.\n\n\"Then why should she not come back to you?\" said Mr. Outhouse,\ntimidly.\n\n\"Some day she may,--if she will be obedient. But it cannot be now.\nShe has set me at defiance; and even yet it is too clear from the\ntone of her letter to me that she thinks that she has been right to\ndo so. How could we live together in amity when she addresses me as a\ncruel tyrant?\"\n\n\"Why did she go away at first?\" asked Mrs. Outhouse.\n\n\"Because she would compromise my name by an intimacy which I did not\napprove. But I do not come here to defend myself, Mrs. Outhouse. You\nprobably think that I have been wrong. You are her friend; and to\nyou, I will not even say that I have been right. What I want you to\nunderstand is this. She cannot come back to me now. It would not be\nfor my honour that she should do so.\"\n\n\"But, sir,--would it not be for your welfare, as a Christian?\" asked\nMr. Outhouse.\n\n\"You must not be angry with me, if I say that I will not discuss that\njust now. I did not come here to discuss it.\"\n\n\"It is very sad for our poor niece,\" said Mrs. Outhouse.\n\n\"It is very sad for me,\" said Trevelyan, gloomily;--\"very sad,\nindeed. My home is destroyed; my life is made solitary; I do not even\nsee my own child. She has her boy with her, and her sister. I have\nnobody.\"\n\n\"I can't understand, for the life of me, why you should not live\ntogether just like any other people,\" said Mrs. Outhouse, whose\nwoman's spirit was arising in her bosom. \"When people are married,\nthey must put up with something;--at least, most always.\" This she\nadded, lest it might be for a moment imagined that she had had any\ncause for complaint with her Mr. Outhouse.\n\n\"Pray excuse me, Mrs. Outhouse; but I cannot discuss that. The\nquestion between us is this,--can you consent to receive your two\nnieces till their father's return;--and if so, in what way shall I\ndefray the expense of their living? You will of course understand\nthat I willingly undertake the expense not only of my wife's\nmaintenance and of her sister's also, but that I will cheerfully\nallow anything that may be required either for their comfort or\nrecreation.\"\n\n\"I cannot take my nieces into my house as lodgers,\" said Mr.\nOuthouse.\n\n\"No, not as lodgers; but of course you can understand that it is for\nme to pay for my own wife. I know I owe you an apology for mentioning\nit;--but how else could I make my request to you?\"\n\n\"If Emily and Nora come here they must come as our guests,\" said Mrs.\nOuthouse.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the clergyman. \"And if I am told they are in want\nof a home they shall find one here till their father comes. But I am\nbound to say that as regards the elder I think her home should be\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"Of course it should,\" said Mrs. Outhouse. \"I don't know anything\nabout the law, but it seems to me very odd that a young woman should\nbe turned out in this way. You say she has done nothing?\"\n\n\"I will not argue the matter,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"That's all very well, Mr. Trevelyan,\" said the lady, \"but she's my\nown niece, and if I don't stand up for her I don't know who will. I\nnever heard such a thing in my life as a wife being sent away after\nsuch a fashion as that. We wouldn't treat a cookmaid so; that we\nwouldn't. As for coming here, she shall come if she pleases, but I\nshall always say that it's the greatest shame I ever heard of.\"\n\nNothing came of this visit at last. The lady grew in her anger; and\nMr. Trevelyan, in his own defence, was driven to declare that his\nwife's obstinate intimacy with Colonel Osborne had almost driven\nhim out of his senses. Before he left the parsonage he was brought\neven to tears by his own narration of his own misery;--whereby Mr.\nOuthouse was considerably softened, although Mrs. Outhouse became\nmore and more stout in the defence of her own sex. But nothing at\nlast came of it. Trevelyan insisted on paying for his wife, wherever\nshe might be placed; and when he found that this would not be\npermitted to him at the parsonage, he was very anxious to take some\nsmall furnished house in the neighbourhood, in which the two sisters\nmight live for the next six months under the wings of their uncle\nand aunt. But even Mr. Outhouse was moved to pleasantry by this\nsuggestion, as he explained the nature of the tenements which were\ncommon at St. Diddulph's. Two rooms, front and back, they might\nhave for about five-and-sixpence a week in a house with three other\nfamilies. \"But perhaps that is not exactly what you'd like,\" said Mr.\nOuthouse. The interview ended with no result, and Mr. Trevelyan took\nhis leave, declaring to himself that he was worse off than the foxes,\nwho have holes in which to lay their heads;--but it must be presumed\nthat his sufferings in this respect were to be by attorney; as it was\nfor his wife, and not for himself, that the necessary hole was now\nrequired.\n\nAs soon as he was gone Mrs. Outhouse answered Nora's letter, and\nwithout meaning to be explicit, explained pretty closely what had\ntaken place. The spare bedroom at the parsonage was ready to receive\neither one or both of the sisters till Sir Marmaduke should be in\nLondon, if one or both of them should choose to come. And though\nthere was no nursery at the parsonage,--for Mr. and Mrs. Outhouse had\nbeen blessed with no children,--still room should be made for the\nlittle boy. But they must come as visitors,--\"as our own nieces,\"\nsaid Mrs. Outhouse. And she went on to say that she would have\nnothing to do with the quarrel between Mr. Trevelyan and his wife.\nAll such quarrels were very bad,--but as to this quarrel she could\ntake no part either one side or the other. Then she stated that Mr.\nTrevelyan had been at the parsonage, but that no arrangement had been\nmade, because Mr. Trevelyan had insisted on paying for their board\nand lodging.\n\nThis letter reached Nuncombe Putney before any reply was received by\nMrs. Trevelyan from her husband. This was on the Saturday morning,\nand Mrs. Trevelyan had pledged herself to Mrs. Stanbury that she\nwould leave the Clock House on the Monday. Of course, there was no\nneed that she should do so. Both Mrs. Stanbury and Priscilla would\nnow have willingly consented to their remaining till Sir Marmaduke\nshould be in England. But Mrs. Trevelyan's high spirit revolted\nagainst this after all that had been said. She thought that she\nshould hear from her husband on the morrow, but the post on Sunday\nbrought no letter from Trevelyan. On the Saturday they had finished\npacking up,--so certain was Mrs. Trevelyan that some instructions as\nto her future destiny would be sent to her by her lord.\n\nAt last they decided on the Sunday that they would both go at once\nto St. Diddulph's; or perhaps it would be more correct to say that\nthis was the decision of the elder sister. Nora would willingly have\nyielded to Priscilla's entreaties, and have remained. But Emily\ndeclared that she could not, and would not, stay in the house. She\nhad a few pounds,--what would suffice for her journey; and as Mr.\nTrevelyan had not thought proper to send his orders to her, she would\ngo without them. Mrs. Outhouse was her aunt, and her nearest relative\nin England. Upon whom else could she lean in this time of her great\naffliction? A letter, therefore, was written to Mrs. Outhouse, saying\nthat the whole party, including the boy and nurse, would be at St.\nDiddulph's on the Monday evening, and the last cord was put to the\nboxes.\n\n\"I suppose that he is very angry,\" Mrs. Trevelyan said to her sister,\n\"but I do not feel that I care about that now. He shall have nothing\nto complain of in reference to any gaiety on my part. I will see no\none. I will have no--correspondence. But I will not remain here after\nwhat he has said to me, let him be ever so angry. I declare, as I\nthink of it, it seems to me that no woman was ever so cruelly treated\nas I have been.\" Then she wrote one further line to her husband.\n\n\n   Not having received any orders from you, and having\n   promised Mrs. Stanbury that I would leave this house\n   on Monday, I go with Nora to my aunt, Mrs. Outhouse,\n   to-morrow.\n\n   E. T.\n\n\nOn the Sunday evening the four ladies drank tea together, and they\nall made an effort to be civil, and even affectionate, to each other.\nMrs. Trevelyan had at last allowed Priscilla to explain how it had\ncome to pass that she had told her brother that it would be better\nboth for her mother and for herself that the existing arrangements\nshould be brought to an end, and there had come to be an agreement\nbetween them that they should all part in amity. But the conversation\non the Sunday evening was very difficult.\n\n\"I am sure we shall always think of you both with the greatest\nkindness,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"As for me,\" said Priscilla, \"your being with us has been a delight\nthat I cannot describe;--only it has been wrong.\"\n\n\"I know too well,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, \"that in our present\ncircumstances we are unable to carry delight with us anywhere.\"\n\n\"You hardly understand what our life has been,\" said Priscilla; \"but\nthe truth is that we had no right to receive you in such a house as\nthis. It has not been our way of living, and it cannot continue to be\nso. It is not wonderful that people should talk of us. Had it been\ncalled your house, it might have been better.\"\n\n\"And what will you do now?\" asked Nora.\n\n\"Get out of this place as soon as we can. It is often hard to go\nback to the right path; but it may always be done,--or at least\nattempted.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that I take misery with me wherever I go,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan.\n\n\"My dear, it has not been your fault,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"I do not like to blame my brother,\" said Priscilla, \"because he has\ndone his best to be good to us all;--and the punishment will fall\nheaviest upon him, because he must pay for it.\"\n\n\"He should not be allowed to pay a shilling,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nThen the morning came, and at seven o'clock the two sisters, with the\nnurse and child, started for Lessboro' Station in Mrs. Crocket's open\ncarriage, the luggage having been sent on in a cart. There were many\ntears shed, and any one looking at the party would have thought that\nvery dear friends were being torn asunder.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Priscilla, as soon as the parlour door was shut, and\nthe two were alone together, \"we must take care that we never are\nbrought again into such a mistake as that. They who protect the\ninjured should be strong themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nDOROTHY MAKES UP HER MIND.\n\n\nIt was true that most ill-natured things had been said at Lessboro'\nand at Nuncombe Putney about Mrs. Stanbury and the visitors at the\nClock House, and that these ill-natured things had spread themselves\nto Exeter. Mrs. Ellison of Lessboro', who was not the most\ngood-natured woman in the world, had told Mrs. Merton of Nuncombe\nthat she had been told that the Colonel's visit to the lady had been\nmade by express arrangement between the Colonel and Mrs. Stanbury.\nMrs. Merton, who was very good-natured, but not the wisest woman\nin the world, had declared that any such conduct on the part of\nMrs. Stanbury was quite impossible. \"What does it matter which it\nis,--Priscilla or her mother?\" Mrs. Ellison had said. \"These are the\nfacts. Mrs. Trevelyan has been sent there to be out of the way of\nthis Colonel; and the Colonel immediately comes down and sees her at\nthe Clock House. But when people are very poor they do get driven to\ndo almost anything.\"\n\nMrs. Merton, not being very wise, had conceived it to be her duty\nto repeat this to Priscilla; and Mrs. Ellison, not being very\ngood-natured, had conceived it to be hers to repeat it to Mrs.\nMacHugh at Exeter. And then Bozzle's coming had become known.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. MacHugh, a policeman in mufti down at Nuncombe! I wonder\nwhat our friend in the Close here will think about it! I have always\nsaid, you know, that if she wanted to keep things straight at\nNuncombe, she should have opened her purse-strings.\"\n\nFrom all which it may be understood, that Priscilla Stanbury's desire\nto go back to their old way of living had not been without reason.\n\nIt may be imagined that Miss Stanbury of the Close did not receive\nwith equanimity the reports which reached her. And, of course, when\nshe discussed the matter either with Martha or with Dorothy, she fell\nback upon her own early appreciation of the folly of the Clock House\narrangement. Nevertheless, she had called Mrs. Ellison very bad\nnames, when she learned from her friend Mrs. MacHugh what reports\nwere being spread by the lady from Lessboro'.\n\n\"Mrs. Ellison! Yes; we all know Mrs. Ellison. The bitterest tongue in\nDevonshire, and the falsest! There are some people at Lessboro' who\nwould be well pleased if she paid her way there as well as those poor\nwomen do at Nuncombe. I don't think much of what Mrs. Ellison says.\"\n\n\"But it is bad about the policeman,\" said Mrs. MacHugh.\n\n\"Of course it's bad. It's all bad. I'm not saying that it's not bad.\nI'm glad I've got this other young woman out of it. It's all that\nyoung man's doing. If I had a son of my own, I'd sooner follow him to\nthe grave than hear him call himself a Radical.\"\n\nThen, on a sudden, there came to the Close news that Mrs. Trevelyan\nand her sister were gone. On the very Monday on which they went,\nPriscilla sent a note on to her sister, in which no special allusion\nwas made to Aunt Stanbury, but which was no doubt written with the\nintention that the news should be communicated.\n\n\"Gone; are they? As it is past wishing that they hadn't come, it's\nthe best thing they could do now. And who is to pay the rent of the\nhouse, now they have gone?\" As this was a point on which Dorothy was\nnot prepared to trouble herself at present, she made no answer to the\nquestion.\n\nDorothy at this time was in a state of very great perturbation on her\nown account. The reader may perhaps remember that she had been much\nstartled by a proposition that had been made to her in reference\nto her future life. Her aunt had suggested to her that she should\nbecome--Mrs. Gibson. She had not as yet given any answer to that\nproposition, and had indeed found it to be quite impossible to speak\nabout it at all. But there can be no doubt that the suggestion had\nopened out to her altogether new views of life. Up to the moment\nof her aunt's speech to her, the idea of her becoming a married\nwoman had never presented itself to her. In her humility it had\nnot occurred to her that she should be counted as one among the\ncandidates for matrimony. Priscilla had taught her to regard\nherself,--indeed, they had both so regarded themselves,--as born to\neat and drink, as little as might be, and then to die. Now, when she\nwas told that she could, if she pleased, become Mrs. Gibson, she was\nalmost lost in a whirl of new and confused ideas. Since her aunt had\nspoken, Mr. Gibson himself had dropped a hint or two which seemed to\nher to indicate that he also must be in the secret. There had been\na party, with a supper, at Mrs. Crumbie's, at which both the Miss\nFrenches had been present. But Mr. Gibson had taken her, Dorothy\nStanbury, out to supper, leaving both Camilla and Arabella behind\nhim in the drawing-room! During the quarter of an hour afterwards\nin which the ladies were alone while the gentlemen were eating\nand drinking, both Camilla and Arabella continued to wreak their\nvengeance. They asked questions about Mrs. Trevelyan, and suggested\nthat Mr. Gibson might be sent over to put things right. But Miss\nStanbury had heard them, and had fallen upon them with a heavy hand.\n\n\"There's a good deal expected of Mr. Gibson, my dears,\" she said,\n\"which it seems to me Mr. Gibson is not inclined to perform.\"\n\n\"It is quite indifferent to us what Mr. Gibson may be inclined to\nperform,\" said Arabella. \"I'm sure we shan't interfere with Miss\nDorothy.\"\n\nAs this was said quite out loud before all the other ladies, Dorothy\nwas overcome with shame. But her aunt comforted her when they were\nagain at home.\n\n\"Laws, my dear; what does it matter? When you're Mrs. Gibson, you'll\nbe proud of it all.\"\n\nWas it then really written in the book of the Fates that she, Dorothy\nStanbury, was to become Mrs. Gibson? Poor Dorothy began to feel\nthat she was called upon to exercise an amount of thought and\npersonal decision to which she had not been accustomed. Hitherto,\nin the things which she had done, or left undone, she had received\ninstructions which she could obey. Had her mother and Priscilla\ntold her positively not to go to her aunt's house, she would have\nremained at Nuncombe without complaint. Had her aunt since her coming\ngiven her orders as to her mode of life,--enjoined, for instance,\nadditional church attendances, or desired her to perform menial\nservices in the house,--she would have obeyed, from custom, without a\nword. But when she was told that she was to marry Mr. Gibson, it did\nseem to her to be necessary to do something more than obey. Did she\nlove Mr. Gibson? She tried hard to teach herself to think that she\nmight learn to love him. He was a nice-looking man enough, with sandy\nhair, and a head rather bald, with thin lips, and a narrow nose, who\ncertainly did preach drawling sermons; but of whom everybody said\nthat he was a very excellent clergyman. He had a house and an income,\nand all Exeter had long since decided that he was a man who would\ncertainly marry. He was one of those men of whom it may be said that\nthey have no possible claim to remain unmarried. He was fair game,\nand unless he surrendered himself to be bagged before long, would\nsubject himself to just and loud complaint. The Miss Frenches had\nbeen aware of this, and had thought to make sure of him among them.\nIt was a little hard upon them that the old maid of the Close, as\nthey always called Miss Stanbury, should interfere with them when\ntheir booty was almost won. And they felt it to be the harder because\nDorothy Stanbury was, as they thought, so poor a creature. That\nDorothy herself should have any doubt as to accepting Mr. Gibson, was\nan idea that never occurred to them. But Dorothy had her doubts. When\nshe came to think of it, she remembered that she had never as yet\nspoken a word to Mr. Gibson, beyond such little trifling remarks as\nare made over a tea-table. She might learn to love him, but she did\nnot think that she loved him as yet.\n\n\"I don't suppose all this will make any difference to Mr. Gibson,\"\nsaid Miss Stanbury to her niece, on the morning after the receipt of\nPriscilla's note stating that the Trevelyans had left Nuncombe.\n\nDorothy always blushed when Mr. Gibson's name was mentioned, and she\nblushed now. But she did not at all understand her aunt's allusion.\n\"I don't know what you mean, aunt,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, you know, my dear, what they say about Mrs. Trevelyan and the\nClock House is not very nice. If Mr. Gibson were to turn round and\nsay that the connection wasn't pleasant, no one would have a right to\ncomplain.\"\n\nThe faint customary blush on Dorothy's cheeks which Mr. Gibson's name\nhad produced now covered her whole face even up to the roots of her\nhair. \"If he believes bad of mamma, I'm sure, Aunt Stanbury, I don't\nwant to see him again.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine, my dear, but a man has to think of himself,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Of course he thinks of himself. Why shouldn't he? I dare say he\nthinks of himself more than I do.\"\n\n\"Dorothy, don't be a fool. A good husband isn't to be caught every\nday.\"\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury, I don't want to catch any man.\"\n\n\"Dorothy, don't be a fool.\"\n\n\"I must say it. I don't suppose Mr. Gibson thinks of me the least in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Psha! I tell you he does.\"\n\n\"But as for mamma and Priscilla, I never could like anybody for a\nmoment who would be ashamed of them.\"\n\nShe was most anxious to declare that, as far as she knew herself\nand her own wishes at present, she entertained no partiality for Mr.\nGibson,--no feeling which could become partiality even if Mr. Gibson\nwas to declare himself willing to accept her mother and her sister\nwith herself. But she did not dare to say so. There was an instinct\nwithin her which made it almost impossible to her to express an\nobjection to a suitor before the suitor had declared himself to be\none. She could speak out as touching her mother and her sister,--but\nas to her own feelings she could express neither assent nor dissent.\n\n\"I should like to have it settled soon,\" said Miss Stanbury, in a\nmelancholy voice. Even to this Dorothy could make no reply. What did\nsoon mean? Perhaps in the course of a year or two. \"If it could be\narranged by the end of this week, it would be a great comfort to me.\"\nDorothy almost fell off her chair, and was stricken altogether dumb.\n\"I told you, I think, that Brooke Burgess is coming here?\"\n\n\"You said he was to come some day.\"\n\n\"He is to be here on Monday. I haven't seen him for more than twelve\nyears; and now he's to be here next week? Dear, dear! When I think\nsometimes of all the hard words that have been spoken, and the harder\nthoughts that have been in people's minds, I often regret that the\nmoney ever came to me at all. I could have done without it, very\nwell,--very well.\"\n\n\"But all the unpleasantness is over now, aunt.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that. Unpleasantness of that kind is apt to\nrankle long. But I wasn't going to give up my rights. Nobody but a\ncoward does that. They talked of going to law and trying the will,\nbut they wouldn't have got much by that. And then they abused me for\ntwo years. When they had done and got sick of it, I told them they\nshould have it all back again as soon as I am dead. It won't be long\nnow. This Burgess is the elder nephew, and he shall have it all.\"\n\n\"Is not he grateful?\"\n\n\"No. Why should he be grateful? I don't do it for special love of\nhim. I don't want his gratitude; nor anybody's gratitude. Look at\nHugh. I did love him.\"\n\n\"I am grateful, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Are you, my dear? Then show it by being a good wife to Mr. Gibson,\nand a happy wife. I want to get everything settled while Burgess is\nhere. If he is to have it, why should I keep him out of it whilst I\nlive? I wonder whether Mr. Gibson would mind coming and living here,\nDolly?\"\n\nThe thing was coming so near to her that Dorothy began to feel that\nshe must, in truth, make up her mind, and let her aunt know also how\nit had been made up. She was sensible enough to perceive that if\nshe did not prepare herself for the occasion she would find herself\nhampered by an engagement simply because her aunt had presumed that\nit was out of the question that she should not acquiesce. She would\ndrift into marriage with Mr. Gibson against her will. Her greatest\ndifficulty was the fact that her aunt clearly had no doubt on the\nsubject. And as for herself, hitherto her feelings did not, on either\nside, go beyond doubts. Assuredly it would be a very good thing for\nher to become Mrs. Gibson, if only she could create for herself some\nattachment for the man. At the present moment her aunt said nothing\nmore about Mr. Gibson, having her mind much occupied with the coming\nof Mr. Brooke Burgess.\n\n\"I remember him twenty years ago and more; as nice a boy as you would\nwish to see. His father was the fourth of the brothers. Dear, dear!\nThree of them are gone; and the only one remaining is old Barty, whom\nno one ever loved.\"\n\nThe Burgesses had been great people in Exeter, having been both\nbankers and brewers there, but the light of the family had paled;\nand though Bartholomew Burgess, of whom Miss Stanbury declared that\nno one had ever loved him, still had a share in the bank, it was\nwell understood in the city that the real wealth in the firm of\nCropper and Burgess belonged to the Cropper family. Indeed the most\nconsiderable portion of the fortune that had been realised by old\nMr. Burgess had come into the possession of Miss Stanbury herself.\nBartholomew Burgess had never forgiven his brother's will, and\nbetween him and Jemima Stanbury the feud was irreconcileable. The\nnext brother, Tom Burgess, had been a solicitor at Liverpool, and had\ndone well there. But Miss Stanbury knew nothing of the Tom Burgesses\nas she called them. The fourth brother, Harry Burgess, had been a\nclergyman, and this Brooke Burgess, Junior, who was now coming to\nthe Close, had been left with a widowed mother, the eldest of a\nlarge family. It need not now be told at length how there had been\nill-blood also between this clergyman and the heiress. There had been\nattempts at friendship, and at one time Miss Stanbury had received\nthe Rev. Harry Burgess and all his family at the Close;--but the\nattempts had not been successful; and though our old friend had never\nwavered in her determination to leave the money all back to some one\nof the Burgess family, and with this view had made a pilgrimage to\nLondon some twelve years since, and had renewed her acquaintance\nwith the widow and the children, still there had been no comfortable\nrelations between her and any of the Burgess family. Old Barty\nBurgess, whom she met in the Close, or saw in the High Street every\nday of her life, was her great enemy. He had tried his best,--so at\nleast she was convinced,--to drive her out of the pale of society,\nyears upon years ago, by saying evil things of her. She had conquered\nin that combat. Her victory had been complete, and she had triumphed\nafter a most signal fashion. But this triumph did not silence Barty's\ntongue, nor soften his heart. When she prayed to be forgiven, as she\nherself forgave others, she always exempted Barty Burgess from her\nprayers. There are things which flesh and blood cannot do. She had\nnot liked Harry Burgess' widow, nor for the matter of that, Harry\nBurgess himself. When she had last seen the children she had not\nliked any of them much, and had had her doubts even as to Brooke. But\nwith that branch of the family she was willing to try again. Brooke\nwas now coming to the Close, having received, however, an intimation,\nthat if, during his visit to Exeter, he chose to see his Uncle Barty,\nany such intercourse must be kept quite in the background. While he\nremained in Miss Stanbury's house he was to remain there as though\nthere were no such person as Mr. Bartholomew Burgess in Exeter.\n\nAt this time Brooke Burgess was a man just turned thirty, and was\na clerk in the Ecclesiastical Record Office, in Somerset House. No\ndoubt the peculiar nature and name of the public department to which\nhe was attached had done something to recommend him to Miss Stanbury.\nEcclesiastical records were things greatly to be reverenced in her\neyes, and she felt that a gentleman who handled them and dealt with\nthem would probably be sedate, gentlemanlike, and conservative.\nBrooke Burgess, when she had last seen him, was just about to enter\nupon the duties of the office. Then there had come offence, and she\nhad in truth known nothing of him from that day to this. The visitor\nwas to be at Exeter on the following Monday, and very much was done\nin preparation of his coming. There was to be a dinner party on that\nvery day, and dinner parties were not common with Miss Stanbury. She\nhad, however, explained to Martha that she intended to put her best\nfoot forward. Martha understood perfectly that Mr. Brooke Burgess\nwas to be received as the heir of property. Sir Peter Mancrudy, the\ngreat Devonshire chemist, was coming to dinner, and Mr. and Mrs.\nPowel from Haldon,--people of great distinction in that part of the\ncounty,--Mrs. MacHugh of course; and, equally of course, Mr. Gibson.\nThere was a deep discussion between Miss Stanbury and Martha\nas to asking two of the Cliffords, and Mr. and Mrs. Noel from\nDoddiscombeleigh. Martha had been very much in favour of having\ntwelve. Miss Stanbury had declared that with twelve she must have two\nwaiters from the greengrocer's, and that two waiters would overpower\nher own domesticities below stairs. Martha had declared that she\ndidn't care about them any more than if they were puppy dogs. But\nMiss Stanbury had been quite firm against twelve. She had consented\nto have ten,--for the sake of artistic arrangement at the table;\n\"They should be pantaloons and petticoats alternate, you know,\" she\nhad said to Martha,--and had therefore asked the Cliffords. But the\nCliffords could not come, and then she had declined to make any\nfurther attempt. Indeed, a new idea had struck her. Brooke Burgess,\nher guest, should sit at one end of the table, and Mr. Gibson, the\nclergyman, at the other. In this way the proper alternation would be\neffected. When Martha heard this, Martha quite understood the extent\nof the good fortune that was in store for Dorothy. If Mr. Gibson was\nto be welcomed in that way, it could only be in preparation of his\nbecoming one of the family.\n\nAnd Dorothy herself became aware that she must make up her mind. It\nwas not so declared to her, but she came to understand that it was\nvery probable that something would occur on the coming Monday which\nwould require her to be ready with her answer on that day. And she\nwas greatly tormented by feeling that if she could not bring herself\nto accept Mr. Gibson,--should Mr. Gibson propose to her, as to which\nshe continued to tell herself that the chance of such a thing must\nbe very remote indeed,--but that if he should propose to her, and if\nshe could not accept him, her aunt ought to know that it would be so\nbefore the moment came. But yet she could not bring herself to speak\nto her aunt as though any such proposition were possible.\n\nIt happened that during the week, on the Saturday, Priscilla came\ninto Exeter. Dorothy met her sister at the railway station, and then\nthe two walked together two miles and back along the Crediton Road.\nAunt Stanbury had consented to Priscilla coming to the Close, even\nthough it was not the day appointed for such visits; but the walk\nhad been preferred, and Dorothy felt that she would be able to ask\nfor counsel from the only human being to whom she could have brought\nherself to confide the fact that a gentleman was expected to ask her\nto marry him. But it was not till they had turned upon their walk,\nthat she was able to open her mouth on the subject even to her\nsister. Priscilla had been very full of their own cares at Nuncombe,\nand had said much of her determination to leave the Clock House and\nto return to the retirement of some small cottage. She had already\nwritten to Hugh to this effect, and during their walk had said much\nof her own folly in having consented to so great a change in their\nmode of life. At last Dorothy struck in with her story.\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury wants me to make a change too.\"\n\n\"What change?\" asked Priscilla anxiously.\n\n\"It is not my idea, Priscilla, and I don't think that there can be\nanything in it. Indeed, I'm sure there isn't. I don't see how it's\npossible that there should be.\"\n\n\"But what is it, Dolly?\"\n\n\"I suppose there can't be any harm in my telling you.\"\n\n\"If it's anything concerning yourself, I should say not. If it\nconcerns Aunt Stanbury, I dare say she'd rather you held your\ntongue.\"\n\n\"It concerns me most,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"She doesn't want you to leave her, does she?\"\n\n\"Well; yes; no. By what she said last,--I shouldn't leave her at all\nin that way. Only I'm sure it's not possible.\"\n\n\"I am the worst hand in the world, Dolly, at guessing a riddle.\"\n\n\"You've heard of that Mr. Gibson, the clergyman;--haven't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I have.\"\n\n\"Well--. Mind, you know, it's only what Aunt Stanbury says. He has\nnever so much as opened his lips to me himself, except to say, 'How\ndo you do?' and that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury wants you to marry him?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Of course it's out of the question,\" said Dorothy, sadly.\n\n\"I don't see why it should be out of the question,\" said Priscilla\nproudly. \"Indeed, if Aunt Stanbury has said much about it, I should\nsay that Mr. Gibson himself must have spoken to her.\"\n\n\"Do you think he has?\"\n\n\"I do not believe that my aunt would raise false hopes,\" said\nPriscilla.\n\n\"But I haven't any hopes. That is to say, I had never thought about\nsuch a thing.\"\n\n\"But you think about it now, Dolly?\"\n\n\"I should never have dreamed about it, only for Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"But, dearest, you are dreaming of it now, are you not?\"\n\n\"Only because she says that it is to be so. You don't know how\ngenerous she is. She says that if it should be so, she will give me\never so much money;--two thousand pounds!\"\n\n\"Then I am quite sure that she and Mr. Gibson must understand each\nother.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Dorothy, sadly, \"if he were to think of such a\nthing at all, it would only be because the money would be\nconvenient.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Priscilla, sternly,--with a sternness that was\nvery comfortable to her listener. \"Not at all. Why should not Mr.\nGibson love you as well as any man ever loved any woman? You are\nnice-looking,\"--Dorothy blushed beneath her hat even at her sister's\npraise,--\"and good-tempered, and lovable in every way. And I think\nyou are just fitted to make a good wife. And you must not suppose,\nDolly, that because Mr. Gibson wouldn't perhaps have asked you\nwithout the money, that therefore he is mercenary. It so often\nhappens that a gentleman can't marry unless the lady has some money!\"\n\n\"But he hasn't asked me at all.\"\n\n\"I suppose he will, dear.\"\n\n\"I only know what Aunt Stanbury says.\"\n\n\"You may be sure that he will ask you.\"\n\n\"And what must I say, Priscilla?\"\n\n\"What must you say? Nobody can tell you that, dear, but yourself. Do\nyou like him?\"\n\n\"I don't dislike him.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"I know him so very little, Priscilla. Everybody says he is very\ngood;--and then it's a great thing, isn't it, that he should be a\nclergyman?\"\n\n\"I don't know about that.\"\n\n\"I think it is. If it were possible that I should ever marry any one,\nI should like a clergyman so much the best.\"\n\n\"Then you do know what to say to him.\"\n\n\"No, I don't, Priscilla. I don't know at all.\"\n\n\"Look here, dearest. What my aunt offers to you is a very great\nstep in life. If you can accept this gentleman I think you would be\nhappy;--and I think, also, which should be of more importance for\nyour consideration, that you would make him happy. It is a brighter\nprospect, dear Dolly, than to live either with us at Nuncombe, or\neven with Aunt Stanbury as her niece.\"\n\n\"But if I don't love him, Priscilla?\"\n\n\"Then give it up, and be as you are, my own own, dearest sister.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Dorothy, and at that time her mind was made up.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Dorothy makes up her mind.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nMR. BROOKE BURGESS.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe hour at which Mr. Brooke Burgess was to arrive had come round,\nand Miss Stanbury was in a twitter, partly of expectation, and\npartly, it must be confessed, of fear. Why there should be any fear\nshe did not herself know, as she had much to give and nothing to\nexpect. But she was afraid, and was conscious of it, and was out\nof temper because she was ashamed of herself. Although it would be\nnecessary that she should again dress for dinner at six, she had put\non a clean cap at four, and appeared at that early hour in one of\nher gowns which was not customarily in use for home purposes at that\nearly hour. She felt that she was \"an old fool\" for her pains, and\nwas consequently cross to poor Dorothy. And there were other reasons\nfor some display of harshness to her niece. Mr. Gibson had been at\nthe house that very morning, and Dorothy had given herself airs. At\nleast, so Miss Stanbury thought. And during the last three or four\ndays, whenever Mr. Gibson's name had been mentioned, Dorothy had\nbecome silent, glum, and almost obstructive. Miss Stanbury had been\nat the trouble of explaining that she was specially anxious to have\nthat little matter of the engagement settled at once. She knew that\nshe was going to behave with great generosity;--that she was going to\nsacrifice, not her money only, of which she did not think much, but a\nconsiderable portion of her authority, of which she did think a great\ndeal; and that she was about to behave in a manner which demanded\nmuch gratitude. But it seemed to her that Dorothy was not in\nthe least grateful. Hugh had proved himself to be \"a mass of\ningratitude,\" as she was in the habit of saying. None of the\nBurgesses had ever shown to her any gratitude for promises made to\nthem, or, indeed, for any substantial favours conferred upon them.\nAnd now Dorothy, to whom a very seventh heaven of happiness had been\nopened,--a seventh heaven, as it must be computed in comparison with\nher low expectations,--now Dorothy was already shewing how thankless\nshe could become. Mr. Gibson had not yet declared his passion, but he\nhad freely admitted to Miss Stanbury that he was prepared to do so.\nPriscilla had been quite right in her suggestion that there was a\nclear understanding between the clergyman and her aunt.\n\n\"I don't think he is come after all,\" said Miss Stanbury, looking\nat her watch. Had the train arrived at the moment that it was due,\nhad the expectant visitor jumped out of the railway carriage into\na fly, and had the driver galloped up to the Close, it might have\nbeen possible that the wheels should have been at the door as Miss\nStanbury spoke.\n\n\"It's hardly time yet, aunt.\"\n\n\"Nonsense; it is time. The train comes in at four. I dare say he\nwon't come at all.\"\n\n\"He is sure to come, aunt.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt you know all about it better than any one else. You\nusually do.\" Then five minutes were passed in silence. \"Heaven and\nearth! what shall I do with these people that are coming? And I told\nthem especially that it was to meet this young man! It's the way I am\nalways treated by everybody that I have about me.\"\n\n\"The train might be ten minutes late, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and monkeys might chew tobacco. There;--there's the omnibus at\nthe Cock and Bottle; the omnibus up from the train. Now, of course,\nhe won't come.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's walking, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Walking,--with his luggage on his shoulders? Is that your idea of\nthe way in which a London gentleman goes about? And there are two\nflies,--coming up from the train, of course.\" Miss Stanbury was\nobliged to fix the side of her chair very close to the window in\norder that she might see that part of the Close in which the vehicles\nof which she had spoken were able to pass.\n\n\"Perhaps they are not coming from the train, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Perhaps a fiddlestick! You have lived here so much longer than\nI have done that, of course, you must know all about it.\" Then\nthere was an interval of another ten minutes, and even Dorothy was\nbeginning to think that Mr. Burgess was not coming. \"I've given him\nup now,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"I think I'll send and put them all\noff.\" Just at that moment there came a knock at the door. But there\nwas no cab. Dorothy's conjecture had been right. The London gentleman\nhad walked, and his portmanteau had been carried behind him by a boy.\n\"How did he get here?\" exclaimed Miss Stanbury, as she heard the\nstrange voice speaking to Martha down-stairs. But Dorothy knew better\nthan to answer the question.\n\n\"Miss Stanbury, I am very glad to see you,\" said Mr. Brooke Burgess,\nas he entered the room. Miss Stanbury courtesied, and then took\nhim by both hands. \"You wouldn't have known me, I dare say,\" he\ncontinued. \"A black beard and a bald head do make a difference.\"\n\n\"You are not bald at all,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"I am beginning to be thin enough at the top. I am so glad to come to\nyou, and so much obliged to you for having me! How well I remember\nthe old room!\"\n\n\"This is my niece, Miss Dorothy Stanbury, from Nuncombe Putney.\"\nDorothy was about to make some formal acknowledgment of the\nintroduction, when Brooke Burgess came up to her, and shook her hand\nheartily. \"She lives with me,\" continued the aunt.\n\n\"And what has become of Hugh?\" said Brooke.\n\n\"We never talk of him,\" said Miss Stanbury gravely.\n\n\"I hope there's nothing wrong? I hear of him very often in London.\"\n\n\"My aunt and he don't agree;--that's all,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"He has given up his profession as a barrister,--in which he might\nhave lived like a gentleman,\" said Miss Stanbury, \"and has taken to\nwriting for a--penny newspaper.\"\n\n\"Everybody does that now, Miss Stanbury.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"I! Nobody would print anything that I wrote. I don't write for\nanything, certainly.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\nBrooke Burgess, or Mr. Brooke, as he came to be called very shortly\nby the servants in the house, was a good-looking man, with black\nwhiskers and black hair, which, as he said, was beginning to be thin\non the top of his head, and pleasant small bright eyes. Dorothy\nthought that next to her brother Hugh he was the most good-natured\nlooking man she had ever seen. He was rather below the middle height,\nand somewhat inclined to be stout. But he would boast that he could\nstill walk his twelve miles in three hours, and would add that as\nlong as he could do that he would never recognise the necessity of\nputting himself on short commons. He had a well-cut nose, not quite\naquiline, but tending that way, a chin with a dimple on it, and as\nsweet a mouth as ever declared the excellence of a man's temper.\nDorothy immediately began to compare him with her brother Hugh, who\nwas to her, of all men, the most godlike. It never occurred to her to\nmake any comparison between Mr. Gibson and Mr. Burgess. Her brother\nHugh was the most godlike of men; but there was something godlike\nalso about the new comer. Mr. Gibson, to Dorothy's eyes, was by no\nmeans divine.\n\n\"I used to call you Aunt Stanbury,\" said Brooke Burgess to the old\nlady; \"am I to go on doing it now?\"\n\n\"You may call me what you like,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"Only,--dear\nme;--I never did see anybody so much altered.\" Before she went up to\ndress herself for dinner, Miss Stanbury was quite restored to her\ngood humour, as Dorothy could perceive.\n\nThe dinner passed off well enough. Mr. Gibson, at the head of the\ntable, did, indeed, look very much out of his element, as though he\nconceived that his position revealed to the outer world those ideas\nof his in regard to Dorothy, which ought to have been secret for a\nwhile longer. There are few men who do not feel ashamed of being\nparaded before the world as acknowledged suitors, whereas ladies\naccept the position with something almost of triumph. The lady\nperhaps regards herself as the successful angler, whereas the\ngentleman is conscious of some similitude to the unsuccessful fish.\nMr. Gibson, though he was not yet gasping in the basket, had some\npresentiment of this feeling, which made his present seat of honour\nunpleasant to him. Brooke Burgess, at the other end of the table,\nwas as gay as a lark. Mrs. MacHugh sat on one side of him, and\nMiss Stanbury on the other, and he laughed at the two old ladies,\nreminding them of his former doings in Exeter,--how he had hunted\nMrs. MacHugh's cat, and had stolen Aunt Stanbury's best apricot jam,\ntill everybody began to perceive that he was quite a success. Even\nSir Peter Mancrudy laughed at his jokes, and Mrs. Powel, from the\nother side of Sir Peter, stretched her head forward so that she might\nbecome one of the gay party.\n\n\"There isn't a word of it true,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"It's all pure\ninvention, and a great scandal. I never did such a thing in my life.\"\n\n\"Didn't you though?\" said Brooke Burgess. \"I remember it as well\nas if it was yesterday, and old Dr. Ball, the prebendary, with the\ncarbuncles on his nose, saw it too.\"\n\n\"Dr. Ball had no carbuncles on his nose,\" said Mrs. MacHugh. \"You'll\nsay next that I have carbuncles on my nose.\"\n\n\"He had three. I remember each of them quite well, and so does Sir\nPeter.\"\n\nThen everybody laughed; and Martha, who was in the room, knew that\nBrooke Burgess was a complete success.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Gibson was talking to Dorothy; but Dorothy was\nendeavouring to listen to the conversation at the other end of the\ntable. \"I found it very dirty on the roads to-day outside the city,\"\nsaid Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"Very dirty,\" said Dorothy, looking round at Mr. Burgess as she\nspoke.\n\n\"But the pavement in the High Street was dry enough.\"\n\n\"Quite dry,\" said Dorothy. Then there came a peal of laughter from\nMrs. MacHugh and Sir Peter, and Dorothy wondered whether anybody\nbefore had ever made those two steady old people laugh after that\nfashion.\n\n\"I should so like to get a drive with you up to the top of Haldon\nHill,\" said Mr. Gibson. \"When the weather gets fine, that is. Mrs.\nPowel was talking about it.\"\n\n\"It would be very nice,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"You have never seen the view from Haldon Hill yet?\" asked Mr.\nGibson. But to this question Dorothy could make no answer. Miss\nStanbury had lifted one of the table-spoons, as though she was going\nto strike Mr. Brooke Burgess with the bowl of it. And this during\na dinner party! From that moment Dorothy turned herself round, and\nbecame one of the listeners to the fun at the other end of the table.\nPoor Mr. Gibson soon found himself \"nowhere.\"\n\n\"I never saw a man so much altered in my life,\" said Mrs. MacHugh, up\nin the drawing-room. \"I don't remember that he used to be clever.\"\n\n\"He was a bright boy,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"But the Burgesses all used to be such serious, strait-laced people,\"\nsaid Mrs. MacHugh. \"Excellent people,\" she added, remembering the\nsource of her friend's wealth; \"but none of them like that.\"\n\n\"I call him a very handsome man,\" said Mrs. Powel. \"I suppose he's\nnot married yet?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"There's time enough for him\nyet.\"\n\n\"He'll find plenty here to set their caps at him,\" said Mrs. MacHugh.\n\n\"He's a little old for my girls,\" said Mrs. Powel, laughing. Mrs.\nPowel was the happy mother of four daughters, of whom the eldest was\nonly twelve.\n\n\"There are others who are more forward,\" said Mrs. MacHugh. \"What a\nchance it would be for dear Arabella French!\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"And then poor Mr. Gibson wouldn't be any longer like the donkey\nbetween two bundles of hay,\" said Mrs. Powel. Dorothy was quite\ndetermined that she would never marry a man who was like a donkey\nbetween two bundles of hay.\n\nWhen the gentlemen came up into the drawing-room, Dorothy was seated\nbehind the urn and tea-things at a large table, in such a position as\nto be approached only at one side. There was one chair at her left\nhand, but at her right hand there was no room for a seat,--only room\nfor some civil gentleman to take away full cups and bring them back\nempty. Dorothy was not sufficiently ready-witted to see the danger of\nthis position till Mr. Gibson had seated himself in the chair. Then\nit did seem cruel to her that she should be thus besieged for the\nrest of the evening as she had been also at dinner. While the tea\nwas being consumed Mr. Gibson assisted at the service, asking ladies\nwhether they would have cake or bread and butter; but when all that\nwas over Dorothy was still in her prison, and Mr. Gibson was still\nthe jailer at the gate. She soon perceived that everybody else was\nchatting and laughing, and that Brooke Burgess was the centre of a\nlittle circle which had formed itself quite at a distance from her\nseat. Once, twice, thrice she meditated an escape, but she had not\nthe courage to make the attempt. She did not know how to manage it.\nShe was conscious that her aunt's eye was upon her, and that her aunt\nwould expect her to listen to Mr. Gibson. At last she gave up all\nhope of moving, and was anxious simply that Mr. Gibson should confine\nhimself to the dirt of the paths and the noble prospect from Haldon\nHill.\n\n\"I think we shall have more rain before we are done with it,\" he\nsaid. Twice before during the evening he had been very eloquent about\nthe rain.\n\n\"I dare say we shall,\" said Dorothy. And then there came the sound\nof loud laughter from Sir Peter, and Dorothy could see that he was\npoking Brooke Burgess in the ribs. There had never been anything so\ngay before since she had been in Exeter, and now she was hemmed up in\nthat corner, away from it all, by Mr. Gibson!\n\n\"This Mr. Burgess seems to be different from the other Burgesses,\"\nsaid Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"I think he must be very clever,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Well;--yes; in a sort of a way. What people call a Merry Andrew.\"\n\n\"I like people who make me laugh and laugh themselves,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"I quite agree with you that laughter is a very good thing,--in\nits place. I am not at all one of those who would make the world\naltogether grave. There are serious things, and there must be serious\nmoments.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"And I think that serious conversation upon the whole has more\nallurements than conversation which when you come to examine it is\nfound to mean nothing. Don't you?\"\n\n\"I suppose everybody should mean something when he talks.\"\n\n\"Just so. That is exactly my idea,\" said Mr. Gibson. \"On all such\nsubjects as that I should be so sorry if you and I did not agree. I\nreally should.\" Then he paused, and Dorothy was so confounded by what\nshe conceived to be the dangers of the coming moment that she was\nunable even to think what she ought to say. She heard Mrs. MacHugh's\nclear, sharp, merry voice, and she heard her aunt's tone of pretended\nanger, and she heard Sir Peter's continued laughter, and Brooke\nBurgess as he continued the telling of some story; but her own\ntrouble was too great to allow of her attending to what was going on\nat the other end of the room. \"There is nothing as to which I am so\nanxious as that you and I should agree about serious things,\" said\nMr. Gibson.\n\n\"I suppose we do agree about going to church,\" said Dorothy. She knew\nthat she could have made no speech more stupid, more senseless, more\ninefficacious;--but what was she to say in answer to such an\nassurance?\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Mr. Gibson; \"and I think so. Your aunt is a most\nexcellent woman, and her opinion has very great weight with me on all\nsubjects,--even as to matters of church discipline and doctrine, in\nwhich, as a clergyman, I am of course presumed to be more at home.\nBut your aunt is a woman among a thousand.\"\n\n\"Of course I think she is very good.\"\n\n\"And she is so right about this young man and her property. Don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"Quite right, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"Because you know, to you, of course, being her near relative, and\nthe one she has singled out as the recipient of her kindness, it\nmight have been cause for some discontent.\"\n\n\"Discontent to me, Mr. Gibson!\"\n\n\"I am quite sure your feelings are what they ought to be. And for\nmyself, if I ever were,--that is to say, supposing I could be in any\nway interested--. But perhaps it is premature to make any suggestion\non that head at present.\"\n\n\"I don't at all understand what you mean, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"I thought that perhaps I might take this opportunity of\nexpressing--. But, after all, the levity of the moment is hardly in\naccordance with the sentiments which I should wish to express.\"\n\n\"I think that I ought to go to my aunt now, Mr. Gibson, as perhaps\nshe might want something.\" Then she did push back her chair, and\nstand upon her legs,--and Mr. Gibson, after pausing for a moment,\nallowed her to escape. Soon after that the visitors went, and Brooke\nBurgess was left in the drawing-room with Miss Stanbury and Dorothy.\n\n\"How well I recollect all the people,\" said Brooke; \"Sir Peter, and\nold Mrs. MacHugh, and Mrs. Powel, who then used to be called the\nbeautiful Miss Noel. And I remember every bit of furniture in the\nroom.\"\n\n\"Nothing changed except the old woman, Brooke,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Upon my word, you are the least changed of all,--except that you\ndon't seem to be so terrible as you were then.\"\n\n\"Was I very terrible, Brooke?\"\n\n\"My mother had told me, I fancy, that I was never to make a noise,\nand be sure not to break any of the china. You were always very\ngood-natured, and when you gave me a silver watch I could hardly\nbelieve the extent of my own bliss.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't care about a watch from an old woman now, Brooke?\"\n\n\"You try me. But what rakes you are here! It's past eleven o'clock,\nand I must go and have a smoke.\"\n\n\"Have a what?\" said Miss Stanbury, with a startled air.\n\n\"A smoke. You needn't be frightened; I don't mean in the house.\"\n\n\"No;--I hope you don't mean that.\"\n\n\"But I may take a turn round the Close with a pipe;--mayn't I?\"\n\n\"I suppose all young men do smoke now,\" said Miss Stanbury,\nsorrowfully.\n\n\"Every one of them; and they tell me that the young women mean to\ntake to it before long.\"\n\n\"If I saw a young woman smoking, I should blush for my sex; and\nthough she were the nearest and dearest that I had, I would never\nspeak to her;--never. Dorothy, I don't think Mr. Gibson smokes.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, aunt.\"\n\n\"I hope he doesn't. I do hope that he does not. I cannot understand\nwhat pleasure it is that men take in making chimneys of themselves,\nand going about smelling so that no one can bear to come near them.\"\n\nBrooke merely laughed at this, and went his way, and smoked his pipe\nout in the Close, while Martha sat up to let him in when he had\nfinished it. Then Dorothy escaped at once to her room, fearful of\nbeing questioned by her aunt about Mr. Gibson. She had, she thought\nnow, quite made up her mind. There was nothing in Mr. Gibson that\nshe liked. She was by no means so sure as she had been when she was\ntalking to her sister, that she would prefer a clergyman to any one\nelse. She had formed no strong ideas on the subject of love-making,\nbut she did think that any man who really cared for her, would find\nsome other way of expressing his love than that which Mr. Gibson had\nadopted. And then Mr. Gibson had spoken to her about her aunt's money\nin a way that was distasteful to her. She thought that she was quite\nsure that if he should ask her, she would not accept him.\n\nShe was nearly undressed, nearly safe for the night, when there came\na knock at the door, and her aunt entered the room. \"He has come in,\"\nsaid Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"I suppose he has had his pipe, then.\"\n\n\"I wish he didn't smoke. I do wish he didn't smoke. But I suppose an\nold woman like me is only making herself a fool to care about such\nthings. If they all do it I can't prevent them. He seems to be a very\nnice young man--in other things; does he not, Dolly?\"\n\n\"Very nice indeed, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"And he has done very well in his office. And as for his saying that\nhe must smoke, I like that a great deal better than doing it on the\nsly.\"\n\n\"I don't think Mr. Burgess would do anything on the sly, aunt.\"\n\n\"No, no; I don't think he would. Dear me; he's not at all like what I\nfancied.\"\n\n\"Everybody seemed to like him very much.\"\n\n\"Didn't they? I never saw Sir Peter so much taken. And there was\nquite a flirtation between him and Mrs. MacHugh. And now, my dear,\ntell me about Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to tell, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Isn't there? From what I saw going on, I thought there would be\nsomething to tell. He was talking to you the whole evening.\"\n\n\"As it happened he was sitting next to me,--of course.\"\n\n\"Indeed he was sitting next to you;--so much so that I thought\neverything would be settled.\"\n\n\"If I tell you something, Aunt Stanbury, you mustn't be angry with\nme.\"\n\n\"Tell me what? What is it you have to tell me?\"\n\n\"I don't think I shall ever care for Mr. Gibson;--not in that way.\"\n\n\"Why not, Dorothy?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he doesn't care for me. And I don't think he means it.\"\n\n\"I tell you he does mean it. Mean it! Why, I tell you it has all been\nsettled between us. Since I first spoke to you I have explained to\nhim exactly what I intend to do. He knows that he can give up his\nhouse and come and live here. I am sure he must have said something\nabout it to you to-night.\"\n\n\"Not a word, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Then he will.\"\n\n\"Dear aunt, I do so wish you would prevent it. I don't like him. I\ndon't indeed.\"\n\n\"Not like him!\"\n\n\"No;--I don't care for him a bit, and I never shall. I can't help\nit, Aunt Stanbury. I thought I would try, but I find it would be\nimpossible. You can't want me to marry a man if I don't love him.\"\n\n\"I never heard of such a thing in my life. Not love him! And why\nshouldn't you love him? He's a gentleman. Everybody respects him.\nHe'll have plenty to make you comfortable all your life! And then why\ndidn't you tell me before?\"\n\n\"I didn't know, Aunt Stanbury. I thought that perhaps--\"\n\n\"Perhaps what?\"\n\n\"I could not say all at once that I didn't care for him, when I had\nnever so much as thought about it for a moment before.\"\n\n\"You haven't told him this?\"\n\n\"No, I have not told him. I couldn't begin by telling him, you know.\"\n\n\"Then I must pray that you will think about it again. Have you\nimagined what a great thing for you it would be to be established for\nlife,--so that you should never have any more trouble again about a\nhome, or about money, or anything? Don't answer me now, Dorothy, but\nthink of it. It seemed to me that I was doing such an excellent thing\nfor both of you.\" So saying Miss Stanbury left the room, and Dorothy\nwas enabled to obey her, at any rate, in one matter. She did think of\nit. She laid awake thinking of it almost all the night. But the more\nshe thought of it, the less able was she to realise to herself any\nfuture comfort or happiness in the idea of becoming Mrs. Gibson.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nTHE \"FULL MOON\" AT ST. DIDDULPH'S.\n\n\nThe receipt of Mrs. Trevelyan's letter on that Monday morning was a\ngreat surprise both to Mr. and Mrs. Outhouse. There was no time for\nany consideration, no opportunity for delaying their arrival till\nthey should have again referred the matter to Mr. Trevelyan. Their\ntwo nieces were to be with them on that evening, and even the\ntelegraph wires, if employed with such purpose, would not be quick\nenough to stop their coming. The party, as they knew, would have left\nNuncombe Putney before the arrival of the letter at the parsonage of\nSt. Diddulph's. There would have been nothing in this to have caused\nvexation, had it not been decided between Trevelyan and Mr. Outhouse\nthat Mrs. Trevelyan was not to find a home at the parsonage. Mr.\nOuthouse was greatly afraid of being so entangled in the matter as to\nbe driven to take the part of the wife against the husband; and Mrs.\nOuthouse, though she was full of indignation against Trevelyan, was\nat the same time not free from anger in regard to her own niece.\nShe more than once repeated that most unjust of all proverbs, which\ndeclares that there is never smoke without fire, and asserted broadly\nthat she did not like to be with people who could not live at\nhome, husbands with wives, and wives with husbands, in a decent,\nrespectable manner. Nevertheless the preparations went on busily, and\nwhen the party arrived at seven o'clock in the evening, two rooms had\nbeen prepared close to each other, one for the two sisters, and the\nother for the child and nurse, although poor Mr. Outhouse himself was\nturned out of his own little chamber in order that the accommodation\nmight be given. They were all very hot, very tired, and very dusty,\nwhen the cab reached the parsonage. There had been the preliminary\ndrive from Nuncombe Putney to Lessboro'. Then the railway journey\nfrom thence to the Waterloo Bridge Station had been long. And it had\nseemed to them that the distance from the station to St. Diddulph's\nhad been endless. When the cabman was told whither he was to go, he\nlooked doubtingly at his poor old horse, and then at the luggage\nwhich he was required to pack on the top of his cab, and laid himself\nout for his work with a full understanding that it would not be\naccomplished without considerable difficulty. The cabman made it\ntwelve miles from Waterloo Bridge to St. Diddulph's, and suggested\nthat extra passengers and parcels would make the fare up to ten and\nsix. Had he named double as much Mrs. Trevelyan would have assented.\nSo great was the fatigue, and so wretched the occasion, that there\nwas sobbing and crying in the cab, and when at last the parsonage was\nreached, even the nurse was hardly able to turn her hand to anything.\nThe poor wanderers were made welcome on that evening without a word\nof discussion as to the cause of their coming. \"I hope you are not\nangry with us, Uncle Oliphant,\" Emily Trevelyan had said, with tears\nin her eyes. \"Angry with you, my dear;--for coming to our house!\nHow could I be angry with you?\" Then the travellers were hurried\nup-stairs by Mrs. Outhouse, and the master of the parsonage was left\nalone for a while. He certainly was not angry, but he was ill at\nease, and unhappy. His guests would probably remain with him for\nsix or seven months. He had resolutely refused all payment from Mr.\nTrevelyan, but, nevertheless, he was a poor man. It is impossible\nto conceive that a clergyman in such a parish as St. Diddulph's,\nwithout a private income, should not be a poor man. It was but a\nhand-to-mouth existence which he lived, paying his way as his money\ncame to him, and sharing the proceeds of his parish with the poor.\nHe was always more or less in debt. That was quite understood among\nthe tradesmen. And the butcher who trusted him, though he was a\nbad churchman, did not look upon the parson's account as he did on\nother debts. He would often hint to Mr. Outhouse that a little money\nought to be paid, and then a little money would be paid. But it was\nnever expected that the parsonage bill should be settled. In such a\nhousehold the arrival of four guests, who were expected to remain for\nan almost indefinite number of months, could not be regarded without\ndismay. On that first evening, Emily and Nora did come down to tea,\nbut they went up again to their rooms almost immediately afterwards;\nand Mr. Outhouse found that many hours of solitary meditation were\nallowed to him on the occasion. \"I suppose your brother has been told\nall about it,\" he said to his wife, as soon as they were together on\nthat evening.\n\n\"Yes;--he has been told. She did not write to her mother till after\nshe had got to Nuncombe Putney. She did not like to speak about her\ntroubles while there was a hope that things might be made smooth.\"\n\n\"You can't blame her for that, my dear.\"\n\n\"But there was a month lost, or nearly. Letters go only once a month.\nAnd now they can't hear from Marmaduke or Bessy,\"--Lady Rowley's name\nwas Bessy,--\"till the beginning of September.\"\n\n\"That will be in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"But what can my brother say to them? He will suppose that they are\nstill down in Devonshire.\"\n\n\"You don't think he will come at once?\"\n\n\"How can he, my dear? He can't come without leave, and the expense\nwould be ruinous. They would stop his pay, and there would be all\nmanner of evils. He is to come in the spring, and they must stay\nhere till he comes.\" The parson of St. Diddulph's sighed and groaned.\nWould it not have been almost better that he should have put his\npride in his pocket, and have consented to take Mr. Trevelyan's\nmoney?\n\nOn the second morning Hugh Stanbury called at the parsonage, and was\ncloseted for a while with the parson. Nora had heard his voice in the\npassage, and every one in the house knew who it was that was talking\nto Mr. Outhouse, in the little back parlour that was called a study.\nNora was full of anxiety. Would he ask to see them,--to see her? And\nwhy was he there so long? \"No doubt he has brought a message from Mr.\nTrevelyan,\" said her sister. \"I dare say he will send word that I\nought not to have come to my uncle's house.\" Then, at last, both Mr.\nOuthouse and Hugh Stanbury came into the room in which they were all\nsitting. The greetings were cold and unsatisfactory, and Nora barely\nallowed Hugh to touch the tip of her fingers. She was very angry with\nhim, and yet she knew that her anger was altogether unreasonable.\nThat he had caused her to refuse a marriage that had so much to\nattract her was not his sin;--not that; but that, having thus\noverpowered her by his influence, he should then have stopped. And\nyet Nora had told herself twenty times that it was quite impossible\nthat she should become Hugh Stanbury's wife;--and that, were Hugh\nStanbury to ask her, it would become her to be indignant with him,\nfor daring to make a proposition so outrageous. And now she was sick\nat heart, because he did not speak to her!\n\nHe had, of course, come to St. Diddulph's with a message from\nTrevelyan, and his secret was soon told to them all. Trevelyan\nhimself was up-stairs in the sanded parlour of the Full Moon\npublic-house, round the corner. Mrs. Trevelyan, when she heard this,\nclasped her hands and bit her lips. What was he there for? If he\nwanted to see her, why did he not come boldly to the parsonage? But\nit soon appeared that he had no desire to see his wife. \"I am to take\nLouey to him,\" said Hugh Stanbury, \"if you will allow me.\"\n\n\"What;--to be taken away from me!\" exclaimed the mother. But Hugh\nassured her that no such idea had been formed; that he would have\nconcerned himself in no such stratagem, and that he would himself\nundertake to bring the boy back again within an hour. Emily was, of\ncourse, anxious to be informed what other message was to be conveyed\nto her; but there was no other message--no message either of love or\nof instruction.\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury,\" said the parson, \"has left something in my hands for\nyou.\" This \"something\" was given over to her as soon as Stanbury\nhad left the house, and consisted of cheques for various small sums,\namounting in all to \u00c2\u00a3200. \"And he hasn't said what I am to do with\nit?\" Emily asked of her uncle. Mr. Outhouse declared that the cheques\nhad been given to him without any instructions on that head. Mr.\nTrevelyan had simply expressed his satisfaction that his wife should\nbe with her uncle and aunt, had sent the money, and had desired to\nsee the child.\n\nThe boy was got ready, and Hugh walked with him in his arms round the\ncorner, to the Full Moon. He had to pass by the bar, and the barmaid\nand the potboy looked at him very hard. \"There's a young 'ooman has\nto do with that ere little game,\" said the potboy. \"And it's two to\none the young 'ooman has the worst of it,\" said the barmaid. \"They\nmostly does,\" said the potboy, not without some feeling of pride in\nthe immunities of his sex. \"Here he is,\" said Hugh, as he entered\nthe parlour. \"My boy, there's papa.\" The child at this time was more\nthan a year old, and could crawl about and use his own legs with the\nassistance of a finger to his little hand, and could utter a sound\nwhich the fond mother interpreted to mean papa; for with all her hot\nanger against her husband, the mother was above all things anxious\nthat her child should be taught to love his father's name. She\nwould talk of her separation from her husband as though it must be\npermanent; she would declare to her sister how impossible it was that\nthey should ever again live together; she would repeat to herself\nover and over the tale of the injustice that had been done to her,\nassuring herself that it was out of the question that she should ever\npardon the man; but yet, at the bottom of her heart, there was a hope\nthat the quarrel should be healed before her boy would be old enough\nto understand the nature of quarrelling. Trevelyan took the child on\nto his knee, and kissed him; but the poor little fellow, startled by\nhis transference from one male set of arms to another, confused by\nthe strangeness of the room, and by the absence of things familiar\nto his sight, burst out into loud tears. He had stood the journey\nround the corner in Hugh's arms manfully, and, though he had looked\nabout him with very serious eyes, as he passed through the bar,\nhe had borne that, and his carriage up the stairs; but when he\nwas transferred to his father, whose air, as he took the boy, was\nmelancholy and lugubrious in the extreme, the poor little fellow\ncould endure no longer a mode of treatment so unusual, and, with a\ngrimace which for a moment or two threatened the coming storm, burst\nout with an infantine howl. \"That's how he has been taught,\" said\nTrevelyan.\n\n\n   [Illustration: The \"Full Moon\" at St. Diddulph's.]\n\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Stanbury. \"He's not been taught at all. It's\nNature.\"\n\n\"Nature that he should be afraid of his own father! He did not cry\nwhen he was with you.\"\n\n\"No;--as it happened, he did not. I played with him when I was at\nNuncombe; but, of course, one can't tell when a child will cry, and\nwhen it won't.\"\n\n\"My darling, my dearest, my own son!\" said Trevelyan, caressing the\nchild, and trying to comfort him; but the poor little fellow only\ncried the louder. It was now nearly two months since he had seen his\nfather, and, when age is counted by months only, almost everything\nmay be forgotten in six weeks. \"I suppose you must take him back\nagain,\" said Trevelyan, sadly.\n\n\"Of course I must take him back again. Come along, Louey, my boy.\"\n\n\"It is cruel;--very cruel,\" said Trevelyan. \"No man living could love\nhis child better than I love mine;--or, for the matter of that, his\nwife. It is very cruel.\"\n\n\"The remedy is in your own hands, Trevelyan,\" said Stanbury, as he\nmarched off with the boy in his arms.\n\nTrevelyan had now become so accustomed to being told by everybody\nthat he was wrong, and was at the same time so convinced that he was\nright, that he regarded the perversity of his friends as a part of\nthe persecution to which he was subjected. Even Lady Milborough,\nwho objected to Colonel Osborne quite as strongly as did Trevelyan\nhimself, even she blamed him now, telling him that he had done\nwrong to separate himself from his wife. Mr. Bideawhile, the old\nfamily lawyer, was of the same opinion. Trevelyan had spoken to Mr.\nBideawhile as to the expediency of making some lasting arrangement\nfor a permanent maintenance for his wife; but the attorney had told\nhim that nothing of the kind could be held to be lasting. It was\nclearly the husband's duty to look forward to a reconciliation, and\nMr. Bideawhile became quite severe in the tone of rebuke which he\nassumed. Stanbury treated him almost as though he were a madman. And\nas for his wife herself--when she wrote to him she would not even\npretend to express any feeling of affection. And yet, as he thought,\nno man had ever done more for a wife. When Stanbury had gone with the\nchild, he sat waiting for him in the parlour of the public-house, as\nmiserable a man as one could find. He had promised himself something\nthat should be akin to pleasure in seeing his boy;--but it had been\nall disappointment and pain. What was it that they expected him to\ndo? What was it that they desired? His wife had behaved with such\nindiscretion as almost to have compromised his honour; and in return\nfor that he was to beg her pardon, confess himself to have done\nwrong, and allow her to return in triumph! That was the light in\nwhich he regarded his own position; but he promised to himself that\nlet his own misery be what it might he would never so degrade him.\nThe only person who had been true to him was Bozzle. Let them all\nlook to it. If there were any further intercourse between his wife\nand Colonel Osborne, he would take the matter into open court, and\nput her away publicly, let Mr. Bideawhile say what he might. Bozzle\nshould see to that;--and as to himself, he would take himself out of\nEngland and hide himself abroad. Bozzle should know his address, but\nhe would give it to no one else. Nothing on earth should make him\nyield to a woman who had ill-treated him,--nothing but confession\nand promise of amendment on her part. If she would acknowledge and\npromise, then he would forgive all, and the events of the last four\nmonths should never again be mentioned by him. So resolving he sat\nand waited till Stanbury should return to him.\n\nWhen Stanbury got back to the parsonage with the boy he had nothing\nto do but to take his leave. He would fain have asked permission to\ncome again, could he have invented any reason for doing so. But the\nchild was taken from him at once by its mother, and he was left alone\nwith Mr. Outhouse. Nora Rowley did not even show herself, and he\nhardly knew how to express sympathy and friendship for the guests at\nthe parsonage, without seeming to be untrue to his friend Trevelyan.\n\"I hope all this may come to an end soon,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope it may, Mr. Stanbury,\" said the clergyman; \"but to tell you\nthe truth, it seems to me that Mr. Trevelyan is so unreasonable a\nman, so much like a madman indeed, that I hardly know how to look\nforward to any future happiness for my niece.\" This was spoken with\nthe utmost severity that Mr. Outhouse could assume.\n\n\"And yet no man loves his wife more tenderly.\"\n\n\"Tender love should show itself by tender conduct, Mr. Stanbury. What\nhas he done to his wife? He has blackened her name among all his\nfriends and hers, he has turned her out of his house, he has reviled\nher,--and then thinks to prove how good he is by sending her money.\nThe only possible excuse is that he must be mad.\"\n\nStanbury went back to the Full Moon, and retraced his steps with his\nfriend towards Lincoln's Inn. Two minutes took him from the parsonage\nto the public-house, but during these two minutes he resolved that\nhe would speak his mind roundly to Trevelyan as they returned home.\nTrevelyan should either take his wife back again at once, or else he,\nStanbury, would have no more to do with him. He said nothing till\nthey had threaded together the maze of streets which led them from\nthe neighbourhood of the Church of St. Diddulph's into the straight\nway of the Commercial Road. Then he began. \"Trevelyan,\" said he, \"you\nare wrong in all this from beginning to end.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I say. If there was anything in what your wife did to\noffend you, a soft word from you would have put it all right.\"\n\n\"A soft word! How do you know what soft words I used?\"\n\n\"A soft word now would do it. You have only to bid her come back to\nyou, and let bygones be bygones, and all would be right. Can't you be\nman enough to remember that you are a man?\"\n\n\"Stanbury, I believe you want to quarrel with me.\"\n\n\"I tell you fairly that I think that you are wrong.\"\n\n\"They have talked you over to their side.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about sides. I only know that you are wrong.\"\n\n\"And what would you have me do?\"\n\n\"Go and travel together for six months.\" Here was Lady Milborough's\nreceipt again! \"Travel together for a year if you will. Then come\nback and live where you please. People will have forgotten it;--or if\nthey remember it, what matters? No sane person can advise you to go\non as you are doing now.\"\n\nBut it was of no avail. Before they had reached the Bank the two\nfriends had quarrelled and had parted. Then Trevelyan felt that there\nwas indeed no one left to him but Bozzle. On the following morning he\nsaw Bozzle, and on the evening of the next day he was in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nHUGH STANBURY SMOKES ANOTHER PIPE.\n\n\nTrevelyan was gone, and Bozzle alone knew his address. During the\nfirst fortnight of her residence at St. Diddulph's Mrs. Trevelyan\nreceived two letters from Lady Milborough, in both of which she\nwas recommended, indeed tenderly implored, to be submissive to\nher husband. \"Anything,\" said Lady Milborough, \"is better than\nseparation.\" In answer to the second letter Mrs. Trevelyan told the\nold lady that she had no means by which she could shew any submission\nto her husband, even if she were so minded. Her husband had gone\naway, she did not know whither, and she had no means by which she\ncould communicate with him. And then came a packet to her from her\nfather and mother, despatched from the islands after the receipt by\nLady Rowley of the melancholy tidings of the journey to Nuncombe\nPutney. Both Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley were full of anger against\nTrevelyan, and wrote as though the husband could certainly be brought\nback to a sense of his duty, if they only were present. This packet\nhad been at Nuncombe Putney, and contained a sealed note from Sir\nMarmaduke addressed to Mr. Trevelyan. Lady Rowley explained that it\nwas impossible that they should get to England earlier than in the\nspring. \"I would come myself at once and leave papa to follow,\" said\nLady Rowley, \"only for the children. If I were to bring them, I\nmust take a house for them, and the expense would ruin us. Papa has\nwritten to Mr. Trevelyan in a way that he thinks will bring him to\nreason.\"\n\nBut how was this letter, by which the husband was to be brought to\nreason, to be put into the husband's hands? Mrs. Trevelyan applied\nto Mr. Bideawhile and to Lady Milborough, and to Stanbury, for\nTrevelyan's address; but was told by each of them that nothing was\nknown of his whereabouts. She did not apply to Mr. Bozzle, although\nMr. Bozzle was more than once in her neighbourhood; but as yet she\nknew nothing of Mr. Bozzle. The replies from Mr. Bideawhile and from\nLady Milborough came by the post; but Hugh Stanbury thought that duty\nrequired him to make another journey to St. Diddulph's and carry his\nown answer with him.\n\nAnd on this occasion Fortune was either very kind to him,--or very\nunkind. Whichever it was, he found himself alone for a few seconds\nin the parsonage parlour with Nora Rowley. Mr. Outhouse was away at\nthe time. Emily had gone up-stairs for the boy; and Mrs. Outhouse,\nsuspecting nothing, had followed her. \"Miss Rowley,\" said he, getting\nup from his seat, \"if you think it will do any good I will follow\nTrevelyan till I find him.\"\n\n\"How can you find him? Besides, why should you give up your own\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"I would do anything--to serve your sister.\" This he said with\nhesitation in his voice, as though he did not dare to speak all that\nhe desired to have spoken.\n\n\"I am sure that Emily is very grateful,\" said Nora; \"but she would\nnot wish to give you such trouble as that.\"\n\n\"I would do anything for your sister,\" he repeated, \"--for your sake,\nMiss Rowley.\" This was the first time that he had ever spoken a word\nto her in such a strain, and it would be hardly too much to say that\nher heart was sick for some such expression. But now that it had\ncome, though there was a sweetness about it that was delicious to\nher, she was absolutely silenced by it. And she was at once not only\nsilent, but stern, rigid, and apparently cold. Stanbury could not but\nfeel as he looked at her that he had offended her. \"Perhaps I ought\nnot to say as much,\" said he; \"but it is so.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury,\" said she, \"that is nonsense. It is of my sister, not\nof me, that we are speaking.\"\n\nThen the door was opened and Emily came in with her child, followed\nby her aunt. There was no other opportunity, and perhaps it was well\nfor Nora and for Hugh that there should have been no other. Enough\nhad been said to give her comfort; and more might have led to his\ndiscomposure. As to that matter on which he was presumed to have come\nto St. Diddulph's, he could do nothing. He did not know Trevelyan's\naddress, but did know that Trevelyan had abandoned the chambers in\nLincoln's Inn. And then he found himself compelled to confess that he\nhad quarrelled with Trevelyan, and that they had parted in anger on\nthe day of their joint visit to the East. \"Everybody who knows him\nmust quarrel with him,\" said Mrs. Outhouse. Hugh when he took his\nleave was treated by them all as a friend who had been gained. Mrs.\nOuthouse was gracious to him. Mrs. Trevelyan whispered a word to him\nof her own trouble. \"If I can hear anything of him, you may be sure\nthat I will let you know,\" he said. Then it was Nora's turn to bid\nhim adieu. There was nothing to be said. No word could be spoken\nbefore others that should be of any avail. But as he took her hand\nin his he remembered the reticence of her fingers on that former day,\nand thought that he was sure there was a difference.\n\nOn this occasion he made his journey back to the end of Chancery Lane\non the top of an omnibus; and as he lit his little pipe, disregarding\naltogether the scrutiny of the public, thoughts passed through his\nmind similar to those in which he had indulged as he sat smoking on\nthe corner of the churchyard wall at Nuncombe Putney. He declared to\nhimself that he did love this girl; and as it was so, would it not be\nbetter, at any rate more manly, that he should tell her so honestly,\nthan go on groping about with half-expressed words when he saw her,\nthinking of her and yet hardly daring to go near her, bidding himself\nto forget her although he knew that such forgetting was impossible,\nhankering after the sound of her voice and the touch of her hand, and\nsomething of the tenderness of returned affection,--and yet regarding\nher as a prize altogether out of his reach! Why should she be out\nof his reach? She had no money, and he had not a couple of hundred\npounds in the world. But he was earning an income which would give\nthem both shelter and clothes and bread and cheese.\n\nWhat reader is there, male or female, of such stories as is this, who\nhas not often discussed in his or her own mind the different sides of\nthis question of love and marriage? On either side enough may be said\nby any arguer to convince at any rate himself. It must be wrong for a\nman, whose income is both insufficient and precarious also, not only\nto double his own cares and burdens, but to place the weight of that\ndoubled burden on other shoulders besides his own,--on shoulders that\nare tender and soft, and ill adapted to the carriage of any crushing\nweight. And then that doubled burden,--that burden of two mouths to\nbe fed, of two backs to be covered, of two minds to be satisfied, is\nso apt to double itself again and again. The two so speedily become\nfour, and six! And then there is the feeling that that kind of\nsemi-poverty, which has in itself something of the pleasantness of\nindependence, when it is borne by a man alone, entails the miseries\nof a draggle-tailed and querulous existence when it is imposed on a\nwoman who has in her own home enjoyed the comforts of affluence. As a\nman thinks of all this, if he chooses to argue with himself on that\nside, there is enough in the argument to make him feel that not only\nas a wise man but as an honest man, he had better let the young lady\nalone. She is well as she is, and he sees around him so many who have\ntried the chances of marriage and who are not well! Look at Jones\nwith his wan, worn wife and his five children, Jones who is not yet\nthirty, of whom he happens to know that the wretched man cannot look\nhis doctor in the face, and that the doctor is as necessary to the\nman's house as is the butcher! What heart can Jones have for his work\nwith such a burden as this upon his shoulders? And so the thinker,\nwho argues on that side, resolves that the young lady shall go her\nown way for him.\n\nBut the arguments on the other side are equally cogent, and so much\nmore alluring! And they are used by the same man with reference to\nthe same passion, and are intended by him to put himself right in his\nconduct in reference to the same dear girl. Only the former line of\nthoughts occurred to him on a Saturday, when he was ending his week\nrather gloomily, and this other way of thinking on the same subject\nhas come upon him on a Monday, as he is beginning his week with\nrenewed hope. Does this young girl of his heart love him? And if so,\ntheir affection for each other being thus reciprocal, is she not\nentitled to an expression of her opinion and her wishes on this\ndifficult subject? And if she be willing to run the risk and to\nencounter the dangers,--to do so on his behalf, because she is\nwilling to share everything with him,--is it becoming in him, a man,\nto fear what she does not fear? If she be not willing let her say so.\nIf there be any speaking, he must speak first;--but she is entitled,\nas much as he is, to her own ideas respecting their great outlook\ninto the affairs of the world. And then is it not manifestly God's\nordinance that a man should live together with a woman? How poor\na creature does the man become who has shirked his duty in this\nrespect, who has done nothing to keep the world going, who has been\nwilling to ignore all affection so that he might avoid all burdens,\nand who has put into his own belly every good thing that has come to\nhim, either by the earning of his own hands or from the bounty and\nindustry of others! Of course there is a risk; but what excitement is\nthere in anything in which there is none? So on the Tuesday he speaks\nhis mind to the young lady, and tells her candidly that there will be\npotatoes for the two of them,--sufficient, as he hopes, of potatoes,\nbut no more. As a matter of course the young lady replies that\nshe for her part will be quite content to take the parings for her\nown eating. Then they rush deliciously into each other's arms and\nthe matter is settled. For, though the convictions arising from\nthe former line of argument may be set aside as often as need be,\nthose reached from the latter are generally conclusive. That such\na settlement will always be better for the young gentleman and the\nyoung lady concerned than one founded on a sterner prudence is more\nthan one may dare to say; but we do feel sure that that country will\nbe most prosperous in which such leaps in the dark are made with the\ngreatest freedom.\n\nOur friend Hugh, as he sat smoking on the knife-board of the omnibus,\ndetermined that he would risk everything. If it were ordained that\nprudence should prevail, the prudence should be hers. Why should he\ntake upon himself to have prudence enough for two, seeing that she\nwas so very discreet in all her bearings? Then he remembered the\ntouch of her hand, which he still felt upon his palm as he sat\nhandling his pipe, and he told himself that after that he was bound\nto say a word more. And moreover he confessed to himself that he was\ncompelled by a feeling that mastered him altogether. He could not get\nthrough an hour's work without throwing down his pen and thinking of\nNora Rowley. It was his destiny to love her,--and there was, to his\nmind, a mean, pettifogging secrecy, amounting almost to daily lying,\nin his thus loving her and not telling her that he loved her. It\nmight well be that she should rebuke him; but he thought that he\ncould bear that. It might well be that he had altogether mistaken\nthat touch of her hand. After all it had been the slightest possible\nmotion of no more than one finger. But he would at any rate know the\ntruth. If she would tell him at once that she did not care for him,\nhe thought that he could get over it; but life was not worth having\nwhile he lived in this shifty, dubious, and uncomfortable state. So\nhe made up his mind that he would go to St. Diddulph's with his heart\nin his hand.\n\nIn the mean time, Mr. Bozzle had been twice to St. Diddulph's;--and\nnow he made a third journey there, two days after Stanbury's visit.\nTrevelyan, who, in truth, hated the sight of the man, and who\nsuffered agonies in his presence, had, nevertheless, taught himself\nto believe that he could not live without his assistance. That it\nshould be so was a part of the cruelty of his lot. Who else was there\nthat he could trust? His wife had renewed her intimacy with Colonel\nOsborne the moment that she had left him. Mrs. Stanbury, who had been\nrepresented to him as the most correct of matrons, had at once been\nfalse to him and to her trust, in allowing Colonel Osborne to enter\nher house. Mr. and Mrs. Outhouse, with whom his wife had now located\nherself, not by his orders, were, of course, his enemies. His old\nfriend, Hugh Stanbury, had gone over to the other side, and had\nquarrelled with him purposely, with malice prepense, because he would\nnot submit himself to the caprices of the wife who had injured him.\nHis own lawyer had refused to act for him; and his fast and oldest\nally, the very person who had sounded in his ear the earliest warning\nnote against that odious villain, whose daily work it was to destroy\nthe peace of families,--even Lady Milborough had turned against him!\nBecause he would not follow the stupid prescription which she, with\npig-headed obstinacy, persisted in giving,--because he would not\ncarry his wife off to Naples,--she was ill-judging and inconsistent\nenough to tell him that he was wrong! Who was then left to him but\nBozzle? Bozzle was very disagreeable. Bozzle said things, and made\nsuggestions to him which were as bad as pins stuck into his flesh.\nBut Bozzle was true to his employer, and could find out facts. Had\nit not been for Bozzle, he would have known nothing of the Colonel's\njourney to Devonshire. Had it not been for Bozzle, he would never\nhave heard of the correspondence; and, therefore, when he left\nLondon, he gave Bozzle a roving commission; and when he went to\nParis, and from Paris onwards, over the Alps into Italy, he furnished\nBozzle with his address. At this time, in the midst of all his\nmisery, it never occurred to him to inquire of himself whether\nit might be possible that his old friends were right, and that\nhe himself was wrong. From morning to night he sang to himself\nmelancholy silent songs of inward wailing, as to the cruelty of his\nown lot in life;--and, in the mean time, he employed Bozzle to find\nout for him how far that cruelty was carried.\n\nMr. Bozzle was, of course, convinced that the lady whom he was\nemployed to watch was--no better than she ought to be. That is the\nusual Bozzlian language for broken vows, secrecy, intrigue, dirt, and\nadultery. It was his business to obtain evidence of her guilt. There\nwas no question to be solved as to her innocency. The Bozzlian mind\nwould have regarded any such suggestion as the product of a green\nsoftness, the possession of which would have made him quite unfit for\nhis profession. He was aware that ladies who are no better than they\nshould be are often very clever,--so clever, as to make it necessary\nthat the Bozzles who shall at last confound them should be first-rate\nBozzles, Bozzles quite at the top of their profession,--and,\ntherefore, he went about his work with great industry and much\ncaution. Colonel Osborne was at the present moment in Scotland.\nBozzle was sure of that. He was quite in the north of Scotland.\nBozzle had examined his map, and had found that Wick, which was the\nColonel's post-town, was very far north indeed. He had half a mind to\nrun down to Wick, as he was possessed by a certain honest zeal, which\nmade him long to do something hard and laborious; but his experience\ntold him that it was very easy for the Colonel to come up to the\nneighbourhood of St. Diddulph's, whereas the lady could not go down\nto Wick, unless she were to decide upon throwing herself into her\nlover's arms,--whereby Bozzle's work would be brought to an end. He,\ntherefore, confined his immediate operations to St. Diddulph's.\n\nHe made acquaintance with one or two important persons in and about\nMr. Outhouse's parsonage. He became very familiar with the postman.\nHe arranged terms of intimacy, I am sorry to say, with the housemaid;\nand, on the third journey, he made an alliance with the potboy at the\nFull Moon. The potboy remembered well the fact of the child being\nbrought to \"our 'ouse,\" as he called the Full Moon; and he was\nenabled to say, that the same \"gent as had brought the boy backards\nand forrards,\" had since that been at the parsonage. But Bozzle\nwas quite quick enough to perceive that all this had nothing to do\nwith the Colonel. He was led, indeed, to fear that his \"governor,\"\nas he was in the habit of calling Trevelyan in his half-spoken\nsoliloquies,--that his governor was not as true to him as he was to\nhis governor. What business had that meddling fellow Stanbury at St.\nDiddulph's?--for Trevelyan had not thought it necessary to tell his\nsatellite that he had quarrelled with his friend. Bozzle was grieved\nin his mind when he learned that Stanbury's interference was still\nto be dreaded; and wrote to his governor, rather severely, to\nthat effect; but, when so writing, he was able to give no further\ninformation. Facts, in such cases, will not unravel themselves\nwithout much patience on the part of the investigators.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nPRISCILLA'S WISDOM.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nOn the night after the dinner party in the Close, Dorothy was not the\nonly person in the house who laid awake thinking of what had taken\nplace. Miss Stanbury also was full of anxiety, and for hour after\nhour could not sleep as she remembered the fruitlessness of her\nefforts on behalf of her nephew and niece.\n\nIt had never occurred to her, when she had first proposed to herself\nthat Dorothy should become Mrs. Gibson that Dorothy herself would\nhave any objection to such a step in life. Her fear had been that\nDorothy would have become over-radiant with triumph at the idea of\nhaving a husband, and going to that husband with a fortune of her\nown. That Mr. Gibson might hesitate she had thought very likely.\nIt is thus in general that women regard the feelings, desires, and\naspirations of other women. You will hardly ever meet an elderly lady\nwho will not speak of her juniors as living in a state of breathless\nanxiety to catch husbands. And the elder lady will speak of\nthe younger as though any kind of choice in such catching was\nquite disregarded. The man must be a gentleman,--or, at least,\ngentlemanlike,--and there must be bread. Let these things be given,\nand what girl won't jump into what man's arms? Female reader, is it\nnot thus that the elders of your sex speak of the younger? When old\nMrs. Stanbury heard that Nora Rowley had refused Mr. Glascock, the\nthing was to her unintelligible; and it was now quite unintelligible\nto Miss Stanbury that Dorothy should prefer a single life to\nmatrimony with Mr. Gibson.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, on Aunt Stanbury's behalf, that Dorothy was\none of those yielding, hesitating, submissive young women, trusting\nothers, but doubting ever of themselves, as to whom it is natural\nthat their stronger friends should find it expedient to decide for\nthem. Miss Stanbury was almost justified in thinking that unless she\nwere to find a husband for her niece, her niece would never find\none for herself. Dorothy would drift into being an old maid, like\nPriscilla, simply because she would never assert herself,--never\nput her best foot foremost. Aunt Stanbury had therefore taken upon\nherself to put out a foot; and having carefully found that Mr.\nGibson was \"willing,\" had conceived that all difficulties were over.\nShe would be enabled to do her duty by her niece, and establish\ncomfortably in life, at any rate, one of her brother's children. And\nnow Dorothy was taking upon herself to say that she did not like\nthe gentleman! Such conduct was almost equal to writing for a penny\nnewspaper!\n\nOn the following morning, after breakfast, when Brooke Burgess was\ngone out to call upon his uncle,--which he insisted upon doing\nopenly, and not under the rose, in spite of Miss Stanbury's great\ngravity on the occasion,--there was a very serious conversation, and\npoor Dorothy had found herself to be almost silenced. She did argue\nfor a time; but her arguments seemed, even to herself, to amount to\nso little! Why shouldn't she love Mr. Gibson? That was a question\nwhich she found it impossible to answer. And though she did not\nactually yield, though she did not say that she would accept the man,\nstill, when she was told that three days were to be allowed to her\nfor consideration, and that then the offer would be made to her\nin form, she felt that, as regarded the anti-Gibson interest, she\nhad not a leg to stand upon. Why should not such an insignificant\ncreature, as was she, love Mr. Gibson,--or any other man who had\nbread to give her, and was in some degree like a gentleman? On that\nnight, she wrote the following letter to her sister:--\n\n\n   The Close, Tuesday.\n\n   DEAREST PRISCILLA,\n\n   I do so wish that you could be with me, so that I could\n   talk to you again. Aunt Stanbury is the most affectionate\n   and kindest friend in the world; but she has always been\n   so able to have her own way, because she is both clever\n   and good, that I find myself almost like a baby with her.\n   She has been talking to me again about Mr. Gibson; and it\n   seems that Mr. Gibson really does mean it. It is certainly\n   very strange; but I do think now that it is true. He is to\n   come on Friday. It seems very odd that it should all be\n   settled for him in that way; but then Aunt Stanbury is so\n   clever at settling things!\n\n   He sat next to me almost all the evening yesterday; but\n   he didn't say anything about it, except that he hoped I\n   agreed with him about going to church, and all that. I\n   suppose I do; and I am quite sure that if I were to be a\n   clergyman's wife, I should endeavour to do whatever my\n   husband thought right about religion. One ought to try\n   to do so, even if the clergyman is not one's husband.\n   Mr. Burgess has come, and he was so very amusing all the\n   evening, that perhaps that was the reason Mr. Gibson said\n   so little. Mr. Burgess is a very nice man, and I think\n   Aunt Stanbury is more fond of him than of anybody. He is\n   not at all the sort of person that I expected.\n\n   But if Mr. Gibson does come on Friday, and does really\n   mean it, what am I to say to him? Aunt Stanbury will be\n   very angry if I do not take her advice. I am quite sure\n   that she intends it all for my happiness; and then, of\n   course, she knows so much more about the world than I do.\n   She asks me what it is that I expect. Of course, I do not\n   expect anything. It is a great compliment from Mr. Gibson,\n   who is a clergyman, and thought well of by everybody. And\n   nothing could be more respectable. Aunt Stanbury says\n   that with the money she would give us we should be quite\n   comfortable; and she wants us to live in this house. She\n   says that there are thirty girls round Exeter who would\n   give their eyes for such a chance; and, looking at it\n   in that light, of course, it is a very great thing for\n   me. Only think how poor we have been! And then, dear\n   Priscilla, perhaps he would let me be good to you and dear\n   mamma!\n\n   But of course he will ask me whether I--love him; and what\n   am I to say? Aunt Stanbury says that I am to love him.\n   \"Begin to love him at once,\" she said this morning. I\n   would if I could, partly for her sake, and because I do\n   feel that it would be so respectable. When I think of it,\n   it does seem such a pity that poor I should throw away\n   such a chance. And I must say that Mr. Gibson is very\n   good and most obliging; and everybody says that he has\n   an excellent temper, and that he is a most prudent,\n   well-dispositioned man. I declare, dear Priscilla, when I\n   think of it, I cannot bring myself to believe that such a\n   man should want me to be his wife.\n\n   But what ought I to do? I suppose when a girl is in love\n   she is very unhappy if the gentleman does not propose to\n   her. I am sure it would not make me at all unhappy if I\n   were told that Mr. Gibson had changed his mind.\n\n   Dearest Priscilla, you must write at once, because he is\n   to be here on Friday. Oh, dear; Friday does seem to be so\n   near! And I shall never know what to say to him, either\n   one way or the other.\n\n   Your most affectionate sister,\n\n   DOROTHY STANBURY.\n\n   P.S.--Give my kindest love to mamma; but you need not tell\n   her unless you think it best.\n\n\nPriscilla received this letter on the Wednesday morning, and felt\nherself bound to answer it on that same afternoon. Had she postponed\nher reply for a day, it would still have been in Dorothy's hands\nbefore Mr. Gibson could have come to her on the dreaded Friday\nmorning. But still that would hardly give her time enough to consider\nthe matter with any degree of deliberation after she should have been\narmed with what wisdom Priscilla might be able to send her. The post\nleft Nuncombe Putney at three; and therefore the letter had to be\nwritten before their early dinner.\n\nSo Priscilla went into the garden and sat herself down under an old\ncedar that she might discuss the matter with herself in all its\nbearings. She felt that no woman could be called upon to write a\nletter that should be of more importance. The whole welfare in life\nof the person who was dearest to her would probably depend upon it.\nThe weight upon her was so great that she thought for a while she\nwould take counsel with her mother; but she felt sure that her mother\nwould recommend the marriage; and that if she afterwards should find\nherself bound to oppose it, then her mother would be a miserable\nwoman. There could be no use to her in taking counsel with her\nmother, because her mother's mind was known to her beforehand. The\nresponsibility was thrown upon her, and she alone must bear it.\n\nShe tried hard to persuade herself to write at once and tell her\nsister to marry the man. She knew her sister's heart so well as to be\nsure that Dorothy would learn to love the man who was her husband. It\nwas almost impossible that Dorothy should not love those with whom\nshe lived. And then her sister was so well adapted to be a wife and\na mother. Her temper was so sweet, she was so pure, so unselfish, so\ndevoted, and so healthy withal! She was so happy when she was acting\nfor others; and so excellent in action when she had another one to\nthink for her! She was so trusting and trustworthy that any husband\nwould adore her! Then Priscilla walked slowly into the house, got\nher prayer-book, and returning to her seat under the tree read the\nmarriage service. It was one o'clock when she went up-stairs to write\nher letter, and it had not yet struck eleven when she first seated\nherself beneath the tree. Her letter, when written, was as follows:--\n\n\n   Nuncombe Putney, August 25, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST DOROTHY,\n\n   I got your letter this morning, and I think it is better\n   to answer it at once, as the time is very short. I have\n   been thinking about it with all my mind, and I feel almost\n   awe-stricken lest I should advise you wrongly. After all,\n   I believe that your own dear sweet truth and honesty would\n   guide you better than anybody else can guide you. You may\n   be sure of this, that whichever way it is, I shall think\n   that you have done right. Dearest sister, I suppose there\n   can be no doubt that for most women a married life is\n   happier than a single one. It is always thought so, as we\n   may see by the anxiety of others to get married; and when\n   an opinion becomes general, I think that the world is most\n   often right. And then, my own one, I feel sure that you\n   are adapted both for the cares and for the joys of married\n   life. You would do your duty as a married woman happily,\n   and would be a comfort to your husband;--not a thorn in\n   his side, as are so many women.\n\n   But, my pet, do not let that reasoning of Aunt Stanbury's\n   about the thirty young girls who would give their eyes for\n   Mr. Gibson, have any weight with you. You should not take\n   him because thirty other young girls would be glad to have\n   him. And do not think too much of that respectability\n   of which you speak. I would never advise my Dolly to\n   marry any man unless she could be respectable in her new\n   position; but that alone should go for nothing. Nor should\n   our poverty. We shall not starve. And even if we did, that\n   would be but a poor excuse.\n\n   I can find no escape from this,--that you should love him\n   before you say that you will take him. But honest, loyal\n   love need not, I take it, be of that romantic kind which\n   people write about in novels and poetry. You need not\n   think him to be perfect, or the best or grandest of men.\n   Your heart will tell you whether he is dear to you. And\n   remember, Dolly, that I shall remember that love itself\n   must begin at some precise time. Though you had not\n   learned to love him when you wrote on Tuesday, you may\n   have begun to do so when you get this on Thursday.\n\n   If you find that you love him, then say that you will be\n   his wife. If your heart revolts from such a declaration\n   as being false;--if you cannot bring yourself to feel\n   that you prefer him to others as the partner of your\n   life,--then tell him, with thanks for his courtesy, that\n   it cannot be as he would have it.\n\n   Yours always and ever most affectionately,\n\n   PRISCILLA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nMR. GIBSON'S GOOD FORTUNE.\n\n\n\"I'll bet you half-a-crown, my lad, you're thrown over at last, like\nthe rest of them. There's nothing she likes so much as taking some\none up in order that she may throw him over afterwards.\" It was thus\nthat Mr. Bartholomew Burgess cautioned his nephew Brooke.\n\n\"I'll take care that she shan't break my heart, Uncle Barty. I will\ngo my way and she may go hers, and she may give her money to the\nhospital if she pleases.\"\n\nOn the morning after his arrival Brooke Burgess had declared aloud\nin Miss Stanbury's parlour that he was going over to the bank to see\nhis uncle. Now there was in this almost a breach of contract. Miss\nStanbury, when she invited the young man to Exeter, had stipulated\nthat there should be no intercourse between her house and the bank.\n\"Of course, I shall not need to know where you go or where you don't\ngo,\" she had written; \"but after all that has passed there must not\nbe any positive intercourse between my house and the bank.\" And now\nhe had spoken of going over to C and B, as he called them, with the\nutmost indifference. Miss Stanbury had looked very grave, but had\nsaid nothing. She had determined to be on her guard, so that she\nshould not be driven to quarrel with Brooke if she could avoid it.\n\nBartholomew Burgess was a tall, thin, ill-tempered old man, as\nwell-known in Exeter as the cathedral, and respected after a fashion.\nNo one liked him. He said ill-natured things of all his neighbours,\nand had never earned any reputation for doing good-natured acts. But\nhe had lived in Exeter for nearly seventy years, and had achieved\nthat sort of esteem which comes from long tenure. And he had\ncommitted no great iniquities in the course of his fifty years of\nbusiness. The bank had never stopped payment, and he had robbed no\none. He had not swallowed up widows and orphans, and had done his\nwork in the firm of Cropper and Burgess after the old-fashioned safe\nmanner, which leads neither to riches nor to ruin. Therefore he was\nrespected. But he was a discontented, sour old man, who believed\nhimself to have been injured by all his own friends, who disliked\nhis own partners because they had bought that which had, at any rate,\nnever belonged to him;--and whose strongest passion it was to hate\nMiss Stanbury of the Close.\n\n\"She's got a parson by the hand, now,\" said the uncle, as he\ncontinued his caution to the nephew.\n\n\"There was a clergyman there last night.\"\n\n\"No doubt, and she'll play him off against you, and you against him;\nand then she'll throw you both over. I know her.\"\n\n\"She has got a right to do what she likes with her own, Uncle Barty.\"\n\n\"And how did she get it? Never mind. I'm not going to set you against\nher, if you're her favourite for the moment. She has a niece with her\nthere,--hasn't she?\"\n\n\"One of her brother's daughters.\"\n\n\"They say she's going to make that clergyman marry her.\"\n\n\"What;--Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Yes. They tell me he was as good as engaged to another girl,--one of\nthe Frenches of Heavitree. And therefore dear Jemima could do nothing\nbetter than interfere. When she has succeeded in breaking the girl's\nheart--\"\n\n\"Which girl's heart, Uncle Barty?\"\n\n\"The girl the man was to have married; when that's done she'll throw\nGibson over. You'll see. She'll refuse to give the girl a shilling.\nShe took the girl's brother by the hand ever so long, and then she\nthrew him over. And she'll throw the girl over too, and send her back\nto the place she came from. And then she'll throw you over.\"\n\n\"According to you, she must be the most malicious old woman that ever\nwas allowed to live!\"\n\n\"I don't think there are many to beat her, as far as malice goes. But\nyou'll find out for yourself. I shouldn't be surprised if she were to\ntell you before long that you were to marry the niece.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think that such very hard lines either,\" said Brooke\nBurgess.\n\n\"I've no doubt you may have her if you like,\" said Barty, \"in spite\nof Mr. Gibson. Only I should recommend you to take care and get the\nmoney first.\"\n\nWhen Brooke went back to the house in the Close, Miss Stanbury was\nquite fussy in her silence. She would have given much to have been\ntold something about Barty, and, above all, to have learned what\nBarty had said about herself. But she was far too proud even to\nmention the old man's name of her own accord. She was quite sure that\nshe had been abused. She guessed, probably with tolerable accuracy,\nthe kind of things that had been said of her, and suggested to\nherself what answer Brooke would make to such accusations. But she\nhad resolved to cloak it all in silence, and pretended for a while\nnot to remember the young man's declared intention when he left the\nhouse. \"It seems odd to me,\" said Brooke, \"that Uncle Barty should\nalways live alone as he does. He must have a dreary time of it.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about your Uncle Barty's manner of living.\"\n\n\"No;--I suppose not. You and he are not friends.\"\n\n\"By no means, Brooke.\"\n\n\"He lives there all alone in that poky bank-house, and nobody ever\ngoes near him. I wonder whether he has any friends in the city?\"\n\n\"I really cannot tell you anything about his friends. And, to tell\nyou the truth, Brooke, I don't want to talk about your uncle. Of\ncourse, you can go to see him when you please, but I'd rather you\ndidn't tell me of your visits afterwards.\"\n\n\"There is nothing in the world I hate so much as a secret,\" said he.\nHe had no intention in this of animadverting upon Miss Stanbury's\nsecret enmity, nor had he purposed to ask any question as to her\nrelations with the old man. He had alluded to his dislike of having\nsecrets of his own. But she misunderstood him.\n\n\"If you are anxious to know--\" she said, becoming very red in the\nface.\n\n\"I am not at all curious to know. You quite mistake me.\"\n\n\"He has chosen to believe,--or to say that he believed,--that I\nwronged him in regard to his brother's will. I nursed his brother\nwhen he was dying,--as I considered it to be my duty to do. I cannot\ntell you all that story. It is too long, and too sad. Romance is very\npretty in novels, but the romance of a life is always a melancholy\nmatter. They are most happy who have no story to tell.\"\n\n\"I quite believe that.\"\n\n\"But your Uncle Barty chose to think,--indeed, I hardly know what\nhe thought. He said that the will was a will of my making. When it\nwas made I and his brother were apart; we were not even on speaking\nterms. There had been a quarrel, and all manner of folly. I am not\nvery proud when I look back upon it. It is not that I think myself\nbetter than others; but your Uncle Brooke's will was made before we\nhad come together again. When he was ill it was natural that I should\ngo to him,--after all that had passed between us. Eh, Brooke?\"\n\n\"It was womanly.\"\n\n\"But it made no difference about the will. Mr. Bartholomew Burgess\nmight have known that at once, and must have known it afterwards. But\nhe has never acknowledged that he was wrong;--never even yet.\"\n\n\"He could not bring himself to do that, I should say.\"\n\n\"The will was no great triumph to me. I could have done without it.\nAs God is my judge, I would not have lifted up my little finger to\nget either a part or the whole of poor Brooke's money. If I had known\nthat a word would have done it, I would have bitten my tongue out\nbefore it should have been spoken.\" She had risen from her seat, and\nwas speaking with a solemnity that almost filled her listener with\nawe. She was a woman short of stature; but now, as she stood over\nhim, she seemed to be tall and majestic. \"But when the man was dead,\"\nshe continued, \"and the will was there,--the property was mine,\nand I was bound in duty to exercise the privileges and bear the\nresponsibilities which the dead man had conferred upon me. It was\nBarty, then, who sent a low attorney to me, offering me a compromise.\nWhat had I to compromise? Compromise! No. If it was not mine by all\nthe right the law could give, I would sooner have starved than have\nhad a crust of bread out of the money.\" She had now clenched both her\nfists, and was shaking them rapidly as she stood over him, looking\ndown upon him.\n\n\"Of course it was your own.\"\n\n\"Yes. Though they asked me to compromise, and sent messages to me to\nfrighten me;--both Barty and your Uncle Tom; ay, and your father too,\nBrooke; they did not dare to go to law. To law, indeed! If ever there\nwas a good will in the world, the will of your Uncle Brooke was good.\nThey could talk, and malign me, and tell lies as to dates, and strive\nto make my name odious in the county; but they knew that the will was\ngood. They did not succeed very well in what they did attempt.\"\n\n\"I would try to forget it all now, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Forget it! How is that to be done? How can the mind forget the\nhistory of its own life? No,--I cannot forget it. I can forgive it.\"\n\n\"Then why not forgive it?\"\n\n\"I do. I have. Why else are you here?\"\n\n\"But forgive old Uncle Barty also!\"\n\n\"Has he forgiven me? Come now. If I wished to forgive him, how should\nI begin? Would he be gracious if I went to him? Does he love me,\ndo you think,--or hate me? Uncle Barty is a good hater. It is the\nbest point about him. No, Brooke, we won't try the farce of a\nreconciliation after a long life of enmity. Nobody would believe us,\nand we should not believe each other.\"\n\n\"Then I certainly would not try.\"\n\n\"I do not mean to do so. The truth is, Brooke, you shall have it\nall when I'm gone, if you don't turn against me. You won't take to\nwriting for penny newspapers, will you, Brooke?\" As she asked the\nquestion she put one of her hands softly on his shoulder.\n\n\"I certainly shan't offend in that way.\"\n\n\"And you won't be a Radical?\"\n\n\"No, not a Radical.\"\n\n\"I mean a man to follow Beales and Bright, a republican, a\nputter-down of the Church, a hater of the Throne. You won't take up\nthat line, will you, Brooke?\"\n\n\"It isn't my way at present, Aunt Stanbury. But a man shouldn't\npromise.\"\n\n\"Ah me! It makes me sad when I think what the country is coming\nto. I'm told there are scores of members of Parliament who don't\npronounce their h's. When I was young, a member of Parliament used to\nbe a gentleman;--and they've taken to ordaining all manner of people.\nIt used to be the case that when you met a clergyman you met a\ngentleman. By-the-bye, Brooke, what do you think of Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Mr. Gibson! To tell the truth, I haven't thought much about him.\"\n\n\"But you must think about him. Perhaps you haven't thought about my\nniece, Dolly Stanbury?\"\n\n\"I think that she's an uncommonly nice girl.\"\n\n\"She's not to be nice for you, young man. She's to be married to Mr.\nGibson.\"\n\n\"Are they engaged?\"\n\n\"Well, no; but I intend that they shall be. You won't begrudge that I\nshould give my little savings to one of my own name?\"\n\n\"You don't know me, Aunt Stanbury, if you think that I should\nbegrudge anything that you might do with your money.\"\n\n\"Dolly has been here a month or two. I think it's three months since\nshe came, and I do like her. She's soft and womanly, and hasn't taken\nup those vile, filthy habits which almost all the girls have adopted.\nHave you seen those Frenches with the things they have on their\nheads?\"\n\n\"I was speaking to them yesterday.\"\n\n\"Nasty sluts! You can see the grease on their foreheads when they try\nto make their hair go back in the dirty French fashion. Dolly is not\nlike that;--is she?\"\n\n\"She is not in the least like either of the Miss Frenches.\"\n\n\"And now I want her to become Mrs. Gibson. He is quite taken.\"\n\n\"Is he?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes. Didn't you see him the other night at dinner and\nafterwards? Of course he knows that I can give her a little bit of\nmoney, which always goes for something, Brooke. And I do think it\nwould be such a nice thing for Dolly.\"\n\n\"And what does Dolly think about it?\"\n\n\"There's the difficulty. She likes him well enough; I'm sure of that.\nAnd she has no stuck-up ideas about herself. She isn't one of those\nwho think that almost nothing is good enough for them. But--\"\n\n\"She has an objection.\"\n\n\"I don't know what it is. I sometimes think she is so bashful and\nmodest she doesn't like to talk of being married,--even to an old\nwoman like me.\"\n\n\"Dear me! That's not the way of the age;--is it, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"It's coming to that, Brooke, that the girls will ask the men soon.\nYes,--and that they won't take a refusal either. I do believe that\nCamilla French did ask Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"And what did Mr. Gibson say?\"\n\n\"Ah;--I can't tell you that. He knows too well what he's about to\ntake her. He's to come here on Friday at eleven, and you must be out\nof the way. I shall be out of the way too. But if Dolly says a word\nto you before that, mind you make her understand that she ought to\naccept Gibson.\"\n\n\"She's too good for him, according to my thinking.\"\n\n\"Don't you be a fool. How can any young woman be too good for\na gentleman and a clergyman? Mr. Gibson is a gentleman. Do you\nknow,--only you must not mention this,--that I have a kind of idea\nthat we could get Nuncombe Putney for him. My father had the living,\nand my brother; and I should like it to go on in the family.\"\n\nNo opportunity came in the way of Brooke Burgess to say anything in\nfavour of Mr. Gibson to Dorothy Stanbury. There did come to be very\nquickly a sort of intimacy between her and her aunt's favourite; but\nshe was one not prone to talk about her own affairs. And as to such\nan affair as this,--a question as to whether she should or should not\ngive herself in marriage to her suitor,--she, who could not speak\nof it even to her own sister without a blush, who felt confused\nand almost confounded when receiving her aunt's admonitions and\ninstigations on the subject, would not have endured to hear Brooke\nBurgess speak on the matter. Dorothy did feel that a person easier to\nknow than Brooke had never come in her way. She had already said as\nmuch to him as she had spoken to Mr. Gibson in the three months that\nshe had made his acquaintance. They had talked about Exeter, and\nabout Mrs. MacHugh, and the cathedral, and Tennyson's poems, and the\nLondon theatres, and Uncle Barty, and the family quarrel. They had\nbecome quite confidential with each other on some matters. But on\nthis heavy subject of Mr. Gibson and his proposal of marriage not\na word had been said. When Brooke once mentioned Mr. Gibson on the\nThursday morning, Dorothy within a minute had taken an opportunity of\nescaping from the room.\n\nBut circumstances did give him an opportunity of speaking to Mr.\nGibson. On the Wednesday afternoon both he and Mr. Gibson were\ninvited to drink tea at Mrs. French's house on that evening. Such\ninvitations at Exeter were wont to be given at short dates, and both\nthe gentlemen had said that they would go. Then Arabella French had\ncalled in the Close and had asked Miss Stanbury and Dorothy. It was\nwell understood by Arabella that Miss Stanbury herself would not\ndrink tea at Heavitree. And it may be that Dorothy's company was not\nin truth desired. The ladies both declined. \"Don't you stay at home\nfor me, my dear,\" Miss Stanbury said to her niece. But Dorothy had\nnot been out without her aunt since she had been at Exeter, and\nunderstood perfectly that it would not be wise to commence the\npractice at the house of the Frenches. \"Mr. Brooke is coming, Miss\nStanbury; and Mr. Gibson,\" Miss French said. And Miss Stanbury had\nthought that there was some triumph in her tone. \"Mr. Brooke can go\nwhere he pleases, my dear,\" Miss Stanbury replied. \"And as for Mr.\nGibson, I am not his keeper.\" The tone in which Miss Stanbury\nspoke would have implied great imprudence, had not the two ladies\nunderstood each other so thoroughly, and had not each known that it\nwas so.\n\nThere was the accustomed set of people in Mrs. French's\ndrawing-room;--the Crumbies, and the Wrights, and the Apjohns. And\nMrs. MacHugh came also,--knowing that there would be a rubber. \"Their\nnaked shoulders don't hurt me,\" Mrs. MacHugh said, when her friend\nalmost scolded her for going to the house. \"I'm not a young man. I\ndon't care what they do to themselves.\" \"You might say as much if\nthey went naked altogether,\" Miss Stanbury had replied in anger. \"If\nnobody else complained, I shouldn't,\" said Mrs. MacHugh. Mrs. MacHugh\ngot her rubber; and as she had gone for her rubber, on a distinct\npromise that there should be a rubber, and as there was a rubber, she\nfelt that she had no right to say ill-natured things. \"What does it\nmatter to me,\" said Mrs. MacHugh, \"how nasty she is? She's not going\nto be my wife.\" \"Ugh!\" exclaimed Miss Stanbury, shaking her head both\nin anger and disgust.\n\nCamilla French was by no means so bad as she was painted by Miss\nStanbury, and Brooke Burgess rather liked her than otherwise. And it\nseemed to him that Mr. Gibson did not at all dislike Arabella, and\nfelt no repugnance at either the lady's noddle or shoulders now that\nhe was removed from Miss Stanbury's influence. It was clear enough\nalso that Arabella had not given up the attempt, although she must\nhave admitted to herself that the claims of Dorothy Stanbury were\nvery strong. On this evening it seemed to have been specially\npermitted to Arabella, who was the elder sister, to take into her own\nhands the management of the case. Beholders of the game had hitherto\ndeclared that Mr. Gibson's safety was secured by the constant\ncoupling of the sisters. Neither would allow the other to hunt\nalone. But a common sense of the common danger had made some special\nstrategy necessary, and Camilla hardly spoke a word to Mr. Gibson\nduring the evening. Let us hope that she found some temporary\nconsolation in the presence of the stranger.\n\n\"I hope you are going to stay with us ever so long, Mr. Burgess?\"\nsaid Camilla.\n\n\"A month. That is ever so long;--isn't it? Why I mean to see all\nDevonshire within that time. I feel already that I know Exeter\nthoroughly and everybody in it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we are very much flattered.\"\n\n\"As for you, Miss French, I've heard so much about you all my life,\nthat I felt that I knew you before I came here.\"\n\n\"Who can have spoken to you about me?\"\n\n\"You forget how many relatives I have in the city. Do you think my\nUncle Barty never writes to me?\"\n\n\"Not about me.\"\n\n\"Does he not? And do you suppose I don't hear from Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"But she hates me. I know that.\"\n\n\"And do you hate her?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I've the greatest respect for her. But she is a little\nodd; isn't she, now, Mr. Burgess? We all like her ever so much; and\nwe've known her ever so long, six or seven years,--since we were\nquite young things. But she has such queer notions about girls.\"\n\n\"What sort of notions?\"\n\n\"She'd like them all to dress just like herself; and she thinks that\nthey should never talk to young men. If she was here she'd say I was\nflirting with you, because we're sitting together.\"\n\n\"But you are not; are you?\"\n\n\"Of course I am not.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"I shouldn't know how to begin. I shouldn't indeed. I don't know what\nflirting means, and I don't know who does know. When young ladies and\ngentlemen go out, I suppose they are intended to talk to each other.\"\n\n\"But very often they don't, you know.\"\n\n\"I call that stupid,\" said Camilla. \"And yet, when they do, all the\nold maids say that the girls are flirting. I'll tell you one thing,\nMr. Burgess. I don't care what any old maid says about me. I always\ntalk to people that I like, and if they choose to call me a flirt,\nthey may. It's my opinion that still waters run the deepest.\"\n\n\"No doubt the noisy streams are very shallow,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"You may call me a shallow stream if you like, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"I meant nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"But what do you call Dorothy Stanbury? That's what I call still\nwater. She runs deep enough.\"\n\n\"The quietest young lady I ever saw in my life.\"\n\n\"Exactly. So quiet, but so--clever. What do you think of Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Everybody is asking me what I think of Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"You know what they say. They say he is to marry Dorothy Stanbury.\nPoor man! I don't think his own consent has ever been asked\nyet;--but, nevertheless, it's settled.\"\n\n\"Just at present he seems to me to be,--what shall I say?--I oughtn't\nto say flirting with your sister; ought I?\"\n\n\"Miss Stanbury would say so if she were here, no doubt. But the fact\nis, Mr. Burgess, we've known him almost since we were infants, and\nof course we take an interest in his welfare. There has never been\nanything more than that. Arabella is nothing more to him than I am.\nOnce, indeed--; but, however--; that does not signify. It would be\nnothing to us, if he really liked Dorothy Stanbury. But as far as we\ncan see,--and we do see a good deal of him,--there is no such feeling\non his part. Of course we haven't asked. We should not think of such\na thing. Mr. Gibson may do just as he likes for us. But I am not\nquite sure that Dorothy Stanbury is just the girl that would make\nhim a good wife. Of course when you've known a person seven or eight\nyears you do get anxious about his happiness. Do you know, we think\nher,--perhaps a little,--sly.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Gibson was completely subject to the individual\ncharms of Arabella. Camilla had been quite correct in a part of\nher description of their intimacy. She and her sister had known Mr.\nGibson for seven or eight years; but nevertheless the intimacy could\nnot with truth be said to have commenced during the infancy of the\nyoung ladies, even if the word were used in its legal sense. Seven or\neight years, however, is a long acquaintance; and there was, perhaps,\nsomething of a real grievance in this Stanbury intervention. If it\nbe a recognised fact in society that young ladies are in want of\nhusbands, and that an effort on their part towards matrimony is not\naltogether impossible, it must be recognised also that failure will\nbe disagreeable, and interference regarded with animosity. Miss\nStanbury the elder was undoubtedly interfering between Mr. Gibson\nand the Frenches; and it is neither manly nor womanly to submit\nto interference with one's dearest prospects. It may, perhaps, be\nadmitted that the Miss Frenches had shown too much open ardour in\ntheir pursuit of Mr. Gibson. Perhaps there should have been no ardour\nand no pursuit. It may be that the theory of womanhood is right which\nforbids to women any such attempts,--which teaches them that they\nmust ever be pursued, never the pursuers. As to that there shall be\nno discourse at present. But it must be granted that whenever the\npursuit has been attempted, it is not in human nature to abandon it\nwithout an effort. That the French girls should be very angry with\nMiss Stanbury, that they should put their heads together with the\nintention of thwarting her, that they should think evil things of\npoor Dorothy, that they should half despise Mr. Gibson, and yet\nresolve to keep their hold upon him as a chattel and a thing of value\nthat was almost their own, was not perhaps much to their discredit.\n\n\"You are a good deal at the house in the Close now,\" said Arabella,\nin her lowest voice,--in a voice so low that it was almost\nmelancholy.\n\n\"Well; yes. Miss Stanbury, you know, has always been a staunch friend\nof mine. And she takes an interest in my little church.\" People say\nthat girls are sly; but men can be sly, too, sometimes.\n\n\"It seems that she has taken you so much away from us, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"I don't know why you should say that, Miss French.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am wrong. One is apt to be sensitive about one's friends.\nWe seem to have known you so well. There is nobody else in Exeter\nthat mamma regards as she does you. But, of course, if you are happy\nwith Miss Stanbury that is everything.\"\n\n\"I am speaking of the old lady,\" said Mr. Gibson, who, in spite of\nhis slyness, was here thrown a little off his guard.\n\n\"And I am speaking of the old lady too,\" said Arabella. \"Of whom else\nshould I be speaking?\"\n\n\"No;--of course not.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" continued Arabella, \"I hear what people say about the\nniece. One cannot help what one hears, you know, Mr. Gibson; but I\ndon't believe that, I can assure you.\" As she said this, she looked\ninto his face, as though waiting for an answer; but Mr. Gibson had no\nanswer ready. Then Arabella told herself that if anything was to be\ndone it must be done at once. What use was there in beating round\nthe bush, when the only chance of getting the game was to be had by\ndashing at once into the thicket. \"I own I should be glad,\" she said,\nturning her eyes away from him, \"if I could hear from your own mouth\nthat it is not true.\"\n\nMr. Gibson's position was one not to be envied. Were he willing to\ntell the very secrets of his soul to Miss French with the utmost\ncandour, he could not answer her question either one way or the\nother, and he was not willing to tell her any of his secrets. It was\ncertainly the fact, too, that there had been tender passages between\nhim and Arabella. Now, when there have been such passages, and the\ngentleman is cross-examined by the lady, as Mr. Gibson was being\ncross-examined at the present moment,--the gentleman usually teaches\nhimself to think that a little falsehood is permissible. A gentleman\ncan hardly tell a lady that he has become tired of her, and has\nchanged his mind. He feels the matter, perhaps, more keenly even than\nshe does; and though, at all other times he may be a very Paladin in\nthe cause of truth, in such strait as this he does allow himself some\nlatitude.\n\n\"You are only joking, of course,\" he said.\n\n\"Indeed, I am not joking. I can assure you, Mr. Gibson, that the\nwelfare of the friends whom I really love can never be a matter of\njoke to me. Mrs. Crumbie says that you positively are engaged to\nmarry Dorothy Stanbury.\"\n\n\"What does Mrs. Crumbie know about it?\"\n\n\"I dare say, nothing. It is not so;--is it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"And there is nothing in it;--is there?\"\n\n\"I wonder why people make these reports,\" said Mr. Gibson,\nprevaricating.\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"I wonder why people make these reports.\"]\n\n\n\"It is a fabrication from beginning to end then,\" said Arabella,\npressing the matter quite home. At this time she was very close to\nhim, and though her words were severe, the glance from her eyes was\nsoft. And the scent from her hair was not objectionable to him, as\nit would have been to Miss Stanbury. And the mode of her head-dress\nwas not displeasing to him. And the folds of her dress, as they fell\nacross his knee, were welcome to his feelings. He knew that he was as\none under temptation, but he was not strong enough to bid the tempter\navaunt. \"Say that it is so, Mr. Gibson!\"\n\n\"Of course, it is not so,\" said Mr. Gibson--lying.\n\n\"I am so glad. For of course, Mr. Gibson, when we heard it we thought\na great deal about it. A man's happiness depends so much on whom he\nmarries;--doesn't it? And a clergyman's more than anybody else's. And\nwe didn't think she was quite the sort of woman that you would like.\nYou see, she has had no advantages, poor thing. She has been shut up\nin a little country cottage all her life;--just a labourer's hovel,\nno more;--and though it wasn't her fault, of course, and we all\npitied her, and were so glad when Miss Stanbury brought her to\nthe Close;--still, you know, though one was very glad of her as\nan acquaintance, yet, you know, as a wife,--and for such a dear,\ndear friend--\" She went on, and said many other things with equal\nenthusiasm, and then wiped her eyes, and then smiled and laughed.\nAfter that she declared that she was quite happy,--so happy; and so\nshe left him. The poor man, after the falsehood had been extracted\nfrom him, said nothing more; but sat, in patience, listening to the\nraptures and enthusiasm of his friend. He knew that he had disgraced\nhimself, and he knew also that his disgrace would be known, if\nDorothy Stanbury should accept his offer on the morrow. And yet how\nhardly he had been used! What answer could he have given compatible\nboth with the truth and with his own personal dignity?\n\nAbout half an hour afterwards he was walking back to Exeter with\nBrooke Burgess, and then Brooke did ask him a question or two.\n\n\"Nice girls those Frenches, I think,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"Very nice,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"How Miss Stanbury does hate them,\" says Brooke.\n\n\"Not hate them, I hope,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"She doesn't love them;--does she?\"\n\n\"Well, as for love;--yes; in one sense,--I hope she does. Miss\nStanbury, you know, is a woman who expresses herself strongly.\"\n\n\"What would she say, if she were told that you and I were going to\nmarry those two girls? We are both favourites, you know.\"\n\n\"Dear me! What a very odd supposition,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"For my part, I don't think I shall,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"I don't suppose I shall either,\" said Mr. Gibson, with a gravity\nwhich was intended to convey some smattering of rebuke.\n\n\"A fellow might do worse, you know,\" said Brooke. \"For my part, I\nrather like girls with chignons, and all that sort of get-up. But the\nworst of it is, one can't marry two at a time.\"\n\n\"That would be bigamy,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Brooke.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nMISS STANBURY'S WRATH.\n\n\nPunctually at eleven o'clock on the Friday morning Mr. Gibson\nknocked at the door of the house in the Close. The reader must not\nimagine that he had ever wavered in his intention with regard to\nDorothy Stanbury, because he had been driven into a corner by the\npertinacious ingenuity of Miss French. He never for a moment thought\nof being false to Miss Stanbury the elder. Falseness of that nature\nwould have been ruinous to him,--would have made him a marked man in\nthe city all his days, and would probably have reached even to the\nbishop's ears. He was neither bad enough, nor audacious enough, nor\nfoolish enough, for such perjury as that. And, moreover, though the\nwiles of Arabella had been potent with him, he very much preferred\nDorothy Stanbury. Seven years of flirtation with a young lady is more\ntrying to the affection than any duration of matrimony. Arabella had\nmanaged to awaken something of the old glow, but Mr. Gibson, as soon\nas he was alone, turned from her mentally in disgust. No! Whatever\nlittle trouble there might be in his way, it was clearly his duty\nto marry Dorothy Stanbury. She had the sweetest temper in the world,\nand blushed with the prettiest blush! She would have, moreover, two\nthousand pounds on the day she married, and there was no saying what\nother and greater pecuniary advantages might follow. His mind was\nquite made up; and during the whole morning he had been endeavouring\nto drive all disagreeable reminiscences of Miss French from his\nmemory, and to arrange the words with which he would make his offer\nto Dorothy. He was aware that he need not be very particular about\nhis words, as Dorothy, from the bashfulness of her nature, would be\nno judge of eloquence at such a time. But still, for his own sake,\nthere should be some form of expression, some propriety of diction.\nBefore eleven o'clock he had it all by heart, and had nearly freed\nhimself from the uneasiness of his falsehood to Arabella. He had\ngiven much serious thought to the matter, and had quite resolved that\nhe was right in his purpose, and that he could marry Dorothy with a\npure conscience, and with a true promise of a husband's love. \"Dear\nDolly!\" he said to himself, with something of enthusiasm as he walked\nacross the Close. And he looked up to the house as he came to it.\nThere was to be his future home. There was not one of the prebends\nwho had a better house. And there was a dove-like softness about\nDorothy's eyes, and a winning obedience in her manner, that were\ncharming. His lines had fallen to him in very pleasant places.\nYes;--he would go up to her, and take her at once by the hand, and\nask her whether she would be his, now and for ever. He would not\nlet go her hand till he had brought her so close to him that she\ncould hide her blushes on his shoulder. The whole thing had been so\nwell conceived, had become so clear to his mind, that he felt no\nhesitation or embarrassment as he knocked at the door. Arabella\nFrench would, no doubt, hear of it soon. Well;--she must hear of it.\nAfter all she could do him no injury.\n\nHe was shown up at once into the drawing-room, and there he\nfound--Miss Stanbury the elder. \"Oh, Mr. Gibson!\" she said at once.\n\n\"Is anything the matter with--dear Dorothy?\"\n\n\"She is the most obstinate, pig-headed young woman I ever came across\nsince the world began.\"\n\n\"You don't say so! But what is it, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"What is it? Why just this. Nothing on earth that I can say to her\nwill induce her to come down and speak to you.\"\n\n\"Have I offended her?\"\n\n\"Offended a fiddlestick! Offence indeed! An offer from an honest man,\nwith her friends' approval, and a fortune at her back, as though she\nhad been born with a gold spoon in her mouth! And she tells me that\nshe can't, and won't, and wouldn't, and shouldn't, as though I were\nasking her to walk the streets. I declare I don't know what has come\nto the young women;--or what it is they want. One would have thought\nthat butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.\"\n\n\"But what is the reason, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Oh, reason! You don't suppose people give reasons in these days.\nWhat reason have they when they dress themselves up with bandboxes on\ntheir sconces? Just simply the old reason--'I do not like thee, Dr.\nFell;--why I cannot tell.'\"\n\n\"May I not see her myself, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"I can't make her come down-stairs to you. I've been at her the whole\nmorning, Mr. Gibson. Ever since daylight, pretty nearly. She came\ninto my room before I was up, and told me she had made up her mind.\nI've coaxed, and scolded, and threatened, and cried;--but if she'd\nbeen a milestone it couldn't have been of less use. I told her she\nmight go back to Nuncombe, and she just went off to pack up.\"\n\n\"But she's not to go?\"\n\n\"How can I say what such a young woman will do? I'm never allowed a\nway of my own for a moment. There's Brooke Burgess been scolding me\nat that rate I didn't know whether I stood on my head or my heels.\nAnd I don't know now.\"\n\nThen there was a pause, while Mr. Gibson was endeavouring to decide\nwhat would now be his best course of action. \"Don't you think she'll\never come round, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"I don't think she'll ever come any way that anybody wants her to\ncome, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"I didn't think she was at all like that,\" said Mr. Gibson, almost in\ntears.\n\n\"No,--nor anybody else. I've been seeing it come all the same. It's\njust the Stanbury perversity. If I'd wanted to keep her by herself,\nto take care of me, and had set my back up at her if she spoke to\na man, and made her understand that she wasn't to think of getting\nmarried, she'd have been making eyes at every man that came into the\nhouse. It's just what one gets for going out of one's way. I did\nthink she'd be so happy, Mr. Gibson, living here as your wife. She\nand I between us could have managed for you so nicely.\"\n\nMr. Gibson was silent for a minute or two, during which he walked up\nand down the room,--contemplating, no doubt, the picture of married\nlife which Miss Stanbury had painted for him,--a picture which, as\nit seemed, was not to be realised. \"And what had I better do, Miss\nStanbury?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Do! I don't know what you're to do. I'm groom enough to bring a mare\nto water, but I can't make her drink.\"\n\n\"Will waiting be any good?\"\n\n\"How can I say? I'll tell you one thing not to do. Don't go and\nphilander with those girls at Heavitree. It's my belief that Dorothy\nhas been thinking of them. People talk to her, of course.\"\n\n\"I wish people would hold their tongues. People are so indiscreet.\nPeople don't know how much harm they may do.\"\n\n\"You've given them some excuse, you know, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\nThis was very ill-natured, and was felt by Mr. Gibson to be so rude,\nthat he almost turned upon his patroness in anger. He had known Dolly\nfor not more than three months, and had devoted himself to her, to\nthe great anger of his older friends. He had come this morning true\nto his appointment, expecting that others would keep their promises\nto him, as he was ready to keep those which he had made;--and now he\nwas told that it was his fault! \"I do think that's rather hard, Miss\nStanbury,\" he said.\n\n\"So you have,\" said she;--\"nasty, slatternly girls, without an idea\ninside their noddles. But it's no use your scolding me.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to scold, Miss Stanbury.\"\n\n\"I've done all that I could.\"\n\n\"And you think she won't see me for a minute?\"\n\n\"She says she won't. I can't bid Martha carry her down.\"\n\n\"Then, perhaps, I had better leave you for the present,\" said Mr.\nGibson, after another pause. So he went, a melancholy, blighted man.\nLeaving the Close, he passed through into Southernhay, and walked\nacross by the new streets towards the Heavitree road. He had no\ndesign in taking this route, but he went on till he came in sight\nof the house in which Mrs. French lived. As he walked slowly by it,\nhe looked up at the windows, and something of a feeling of romance\ncame across his heart. Were his young affections buried there, or\nwere they not? And, if so, with which of those fair girls were\nthey buried? For the last two years, up to last night, Camilla had\ncertainly been in the ascendant. But Arabella was a sweet young\nwoman; and there had been a time,--when those tender passages were\ngoing on,--in which he had thought that no young woman ever was so\nsweet. A period of romance, an era of enthusiasm, a short-lived,\ndelicious holiday of hot-tongued insanity had been permitted to him\nin his youth;--but all that was now over. And yet here he was, with\nthree strings to his bow,--so he told himself,--and he had not as yet\nsettled for himself the great business of matrimony. He was inclined\nto think, as he walked on, that he would walk his life alone, an\nactive, useful, but a melancholy man. After such experiences as\nhis, how should he ever again speak of his heart to a woman? During\nthis walk, his mind recurred frequently to Dorothy Stanbury; and,\ndoubtless, he thought that he had often spoken of his heart to her.\nHe was back at his lodgings before three, at which hour he ate an\nearly dinner, and then took the afternoon cathedral service at four.\nThe evening he spent at home, thinking of the romance of his early\ndays. What would Miss Stanbury have said, had she seen him in his\neasy chair behind the \"Exeter Argus,\"--with a pipe in his mouth?\n\nIn the meantime, there was an uncomfortable scene in progress between\nDorothy and her aunt. Brooke Burgess, as desired, had left the house\nbefore eleven, having taken upon himself, when consulted, to say in\nthe mildest terms, that he thought that, in general, young women\nshould not be asked to marry if they did not like to;--which opinion\nhad been so galling to Miss Stanbury that she had declared that he\nhad so scolded her, that she did not know whether she was standing\non her head or her heels. As soon as Mr. Gibson left her, she sat\nherself down, and fairly cried. She had ardently desired this thing,\nand had allowed herself to think of her desire as of one that would\ncertainly be accomplished. Dorothy would have been so happy as the\nwife of a clergyman! Miss Stanbury's standard for men and women was\nnot high. She did not expect others to be as self-sacrificing, as\ncharitable, and as good as herself. It was not that she gave to\nherself credit for such virtues; but she thought of herself as one\nwho, from the peculiar circumstances of life, was bound to do much\nfor others. There was no end to her doing good for others,--if only\nthe others would allow themselves to be governed by her. She did not\nthink that Mr. Gibson was a great divine; but she perceived that he\nwas a clergyman, living decently,--of that secret pipe Miss Stanbury\nknew nothing,--doing his duty punctually, and, as she thought, very\nmuch in want of a wife. Then there was her niece, Dolly,--soft,\npretty, feminine, without a shilling, and much in want of some one\nto comfort and take care of her. What could be better than such a\nmarriage! And the overthrow to the girls with the big chignons would\nbe so complete! She had set her mind upon it, and now Dorothy said\nthat it couldn't, and it wouldn't, and it shouldn't be accomplished!\nShe was to be thrown over by this chit of a girl, as she had been\nthrown over by the girl's brother! And, when she complained, the girl\nsimply offered to go away!\n\nAt about twelve Dorothy came creeping down into the room in which her\naunt was sitting, and pretended to occupy herself on some piece of\nwork. For a considerable time,--for three minutes perhaps,--Miss\nStanbury did not speak. She had resolved that she would not speak\nto her niece again,--at least, not for that day. She would let the\nungrateful girl know how miserable she had been made. But at the\nclose of the three minutes her patience was exhausted. \"What are you\ndoing there?\" she said.\n\n\"I am quilting your cap, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Put it down. You shan't do anything for me. I won't have you touch\nmy things any more. I don't like pretended service.\"\n\n\"It is not pretended, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"I say it is pretended. Why did you pretend to me that you would have\nhim when you had made up your mind against it all the time?\"\n\n\"But I hadn't--made up my mind.\"\n\n\"If you had so much doubt about it, you might have done what I wanted\nyou.\"\n\n\"I couldn't, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"You mean you wouldn't. I wonder what it is you do expect.\"\n\n\"I don't expect anything, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"No; and I don't expect anything. What an old fool I am ever to look\nfor any comfort. Why should I think that anybody would care for me?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I do care for you.\"\n\n\"In what sort of way do you show it? You're just like your brother\nHugh. I've disgraced myself to that man,--promising what I could not\nperform. I declare it makes me sick when I think of it. Why did you\nnot tell me at once?\" Dorothy said nothing further, but sat with the\ncap on her lap. She did not dare to resume her needle, and she did\nnot like to put the cap aside, as by doing so it would seem as though\nshe had accepted her aunt's prohibition against her work. For half\nan hour she sat thus, during which time Miss Stanbury dropped asleep.\nShe woke with a start, and began to scold again. \"What's the good of\nsitting there all the day, with your hands before you, doing\nnothing?\"\n\nBut Dorothy had been very busy. She had been making up her mind,\nand had determined to communicate her resolution to her aunt. \"Dear\naunt,\" she said, \"I have been thinking of something.\"\n\n\"It's too late now,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"I see I've made you very unhappy.\"\n\n\"Of course you have.\"\n\n\"And you think that I'm ungrateful. I'm not ungrateful, and I don't\nthink that Hugh is.\"\n\n\"Never mind Hugh.\"\n\n\"Only because it seems so hard that you should take so much trouble\nabout us, and that then there should be so much vexation.\"\n\n\"I find it very hard.\"\n\n\"So I think that I'd better go back to Nuncombe.\"\n\n\"That's what you call gratitude.\"\n\n\"I don't like to stay here and make you unhappy. I can't think that I\nought to have done what you asked me, because I did not feel at all\nin that way about Mr. Gibson. But as I have only disappointed you,\nit will be better that I should go home. I have been very happy\nhere,--very.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" exclaimed Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"I have,--and I do love you, though you won't believe it. But I am\nsure I oughtn't to remain to make you unhappy. I shall never forget\nall that you have done for me; and though you call me ungrateful, I\nam not. But I know that I ought not to stay, as I cannot do what you\nwish. So, if you please, I will go back to Nuncombe.\"\n\n\"You'll not do anything of the kind,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"But it will be better.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; no doubt. I suppose you're tired of us all.\"\n\n\"It is not that I'm tired, Aunt Stanbury. It isn't that at all.\"\nDorothy had now become red up to the roots of her hair, and her eyes\nwere full of tears. \"But I cannot stay where people think that I\nam ungrateful. If you please, Aunt Stanbury, I will go.\" Then, of\ncourse, there was a compromise. Dorothy did at last consent to remain\nin the Close, but only on condition that she should be forgiven for\nher sin in reference to Mr. Gibson, and be permitted to go on with\nher aunt's cap.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nMONT CENIS.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe night had been fine and warm, and it was now noon on a fine\nSeptember day when the train from Paris reached St. Michael, on the\nroute to Italy by Mont Cenis,--as all the world knows St. Michael\nis, or was a year or two back, the end of railway travelling in\nthat direction. At the time Mr. Fell's grand project of carrying a\nline of rails over the top of the mountain was only in preparation,\nand the journey from St. Michael to Susa was still made by the\ndiligences,--those dear old continental coaches which are now nearly\nas extinct as our own, but which did not deserve death so fully as\ndid our abominable vehicles. The coup\u00c3\u00a9 of a diligence, or better\nstill, the banquette, was a luxurious mode of travelling as compared\nwith anything that our coaches offered. There used indeed to be a\ncertain halo of glory round the occupant of the box of a mail-coach.\nThe man who had secured that seat was supposed to know something\nabout the world, and to be such a one that the passengers sitting\nbehind him would be proud to be allowed to talk to him. But the\nprestige of the position was greater than the comfort. A night on\nthe box of a mail-coach was but a bad time, and a night inside a\nmail-coach was a night in purgatory. Whereas a seat up above, on the\nbanquette of a diligence passing over the Alps, with room for the\nfeet, and support for the back, with plenty of rugs and plenty of\ntobacco, used to be on the Mont Cenis, and still is on some other\nmountain passes, a very comfortable mode of seeing a mountain route.\nFor those desirous of occupying the coup\u00c3\u00a9, or the three front seats\nof the body of the vehicle, it must be admitted that difficulties\nfrequently arose; and that such difficulties were very common at\nSt. Michael. There would be two or three of those enormous vehicles\npreparing to start for the mountain, whereas it would appear that\ntwelve or fifteen passengers had come down from Paris armed with\ntickets assuring them that this preferable mode of travelling should\nbe theirs. And then assertions would be made, somewhat recklessly,\nby the officials, to the effect that all the diligence was coup\u00c3\u00a9.\nIt would generally be the case that some middle-aged Englishman who\ncould not speak French would go to the wall, together with his wife.\nMiddle-aged Englishmen with their wives, who can't speak French, can\nnevertheless be very angry, and threaten loudly, when they suppose\nthemselves to be ill-treated. A middle-aged Englishman, though he\ncan't speak a word of French, won't believe a French official who\ntells him that the diligence is all coup\u00c3\u00a9, when he finds himself\nwith his unfortunate partner in a roundabout place behind with two\npriests, a dirty man who looks like a brigand, a sick maid-servant,\nand three agricultural labourers. The attempt, however, was\nfrequently made, and thus there used to be occasionally a little\nnoise round the bureau at St. Michael.\n\nOn the morning of which we are speaking two Englishmen had just made\ngood their claim, each independently of the other, each without\nhaving heard or seen the other, when two American ladies, coming up\nvery tardily, endeavoured to prove their rights. The ladies were\nwithout other companions, and were not fluent with their French,\nbut were clearly entitled to their seats. They were told that the\nconveyance was all coup\u00c3\u00a9, but perversely would not believe the\nstatement. The official shrugged his shoulders and signified that\nhis ultimatum had been pronounced. What can an official do in such\ncircumstances, when more coup\u00c3\u00a9 passengers are sent to him than the\ncoup\u00c3\u00a9s at his command will hold? \"But we have paid for the coup\u00c3\u00a9,\"\nsaid the elder American lady, with considerable indignation, though\nher French was imperfect;--for American ladies understand their\nrights. \"Bah; yes; you have paid and you shall go. What would you\nhave?\" \"We would have what we have paid for,\" said the American lady.\nThen the official rose from his stool and shrugged his shoulders\nagain, and made a motion with both his hands, intended to shew that\nthe thing was finished. \"It is a robbery,\" said the elder American\nlady to the younger. \"I should not mind, only you are so unwell.\"\n\"It will not kill me, I dare say,\" said the younger. Then one of\nthe English gentlemen declared that his place was very much at the\nservice of the invalid,--and the other Englishman declared that his\nalso was at the service of the invalid's companion. Then, and not\ntill then, the two men recognised each other. One was Mr. Glascock,\non his way to Naples, and the other was Mr. Trevelyan, on his\nway,--he knew not whither.\n\nUpon this, of course, they spoke to each other. In London they had\nbeen well acquainted, each having been an intimate guest at the house\nof old Lady Milborough. And each knew something of the other's recent\nhistory. Mr. Glascock was aware, as was all the world, that Trevelyan\nhad quarrelled with his wife; and Trevelyan was aware that Mr.\nGlascock had been spoken of as a suitor to his own sister-in-law. Of\nthat visit which Mr. Glascock had made to Nuncombe Putney, and of\nthe manner in which Nora had behaved to her lover, Trevelyan knew\nnothing. Their greetings spoken, their first topic of conversation\nwas, of course, the injury proposed to be done to the American\nladies, and which would now fall upon them. They went into the\nwaiting-room together, and during such toilet as they could make\nthere, grumbled furiously. They would take post horses over the\nmountain, not from any love of solitary grandeur, but in order that\nthey might make the company pay for its iniquity. But it was soon\napparent to them that they themselves had no ground of complaint, and\nas everybody was very civil, and as a seat in the banquette over the\nheads of the American ladies was provided for them, and as the man\nfrom the bureau came and apologised, they consented to be pacified,\nand ended, of course, by tipping half-a-dozen of the servants about\nthe yard. Mr. Glascock had a man of his own with him, who was very\nnearly being put on to the same seat with his master as an extra\ncivility; but this inconvenience was at last avoided. Having settled\nthese little difficulties, they went into breakfast in the buffet.\n\nThere could be no better breakfast than used to be given in the\nbuffet at the railway terminus at St. Michael. The company might\noccasionally be led into errors about that question of coup\u00c3\u00a9 seats,\nbut in reference to their provisions, they set an example which might\nbe of great use to us here in England. It is probably the case that\nbreakfasts for travellers are not so frequently needed here as they\nare on the Continent; but, still, there is often to be found a crowd\nof people ready to eat if only the wherewithal were there. We are\noften told in our newspapers that England is disgraced by this and\nby that; by the unreadiness of our army, by the unfitness of our\nnavy, by the irrationality of our laws, by the immobility of our\nprejudices, and what not; but the real disgrace of England is the\nrailway sandwich,--that whited sepulchre, fair enough outside, but\nso meagre, poor, and spiritless within, such a thing of shreds and\nparings, such a dab of food, telling us that the poor bone whence it\nwas scraped had been made utterly bare before it was sent into the\nkitchen for the soup pot. In France one does get food at the railway\nstations, and at St. Michael the breakfast was unexceptional.\n\nOur two friends seated themselves near to the American ladies, and\nwere, of course, thanked for their politeness. American women are\ntaught by the habits of their country to think that men should give\nway to them more absolutely than is in accordance with the practices\nof life in Europe. A seat in a public conveyance in the States, when\nmerely occupied by a man, used to be regarded by any woman as being\nat her service as completely as though it were vacant. One woman\nindicating a place to another would point with equal freedom to a man\nor a space. It is said that this is a little altered now, and that\nEuropean views on this subject are spreading themselves. Our two\nladies, however, who were pretty, clever-looking, and attractive even\nafter the night's journey, were manifestly more impressed with the\nvillainy of the French officials than they were with the kindness of\ntheir English neighbours.\n\n\"And nothing can be done to punish them?\" said the younger of them to\nMr. Glascock.\n\n\"Nothing, I should think,\" said he. \"Nothing will, at any rate.\"\n\n\"And you will not get back your money?\" said the elder,--who, though\nthe elder, was probably not much above twenty.\n\n\"Well;--no. Time is money, they say. It would take thrice the value\nof the time in money, and then one would probably fail. They have\ndone very well for us, and I suppose there are difficulties.\"\n\n\"It couldn't have taken place in our country,\" said the younger lady.\n\"All the same, we are very much obliged to you. It would not have\nbeen nice for us to have to go up into the banquette.\"\n\n\"They would have put you into the interior.\"\n\n\"And that would have been worse. I hate being put anywhere,--as if I\nwere a sheep. It seems so odd to us, that you here should be all so\ntame.\"\n\n\"Do you mean the English or the French, or the world in general on\nthis side of the Atlantic?\"\n\n\"We mean Europeans,\" said the younger lady, who was better after\nher breakfast. \"But then we think that the French have something\nof compensation, in their manners, and their ways of life, their\nclimate, the beauty of their cities, and their general management of\nthings.\"\n\n\"They are very great in many ways, no doubt,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"They do understand living better than you do,\" said the elder.\n\n\"Everything is so much brighter with them,\" said the younger.\n\n\"They contrive to give a grace to every-day existence,\" said the\nelder.\n\n\"There is such a welcome among them for strangers,\" said the younger.\n\n\"Particularly in reference to places taken in the coup\u00c3\u00a9,\" said\nTrevelyan, who had hardly spoken before.\n\n\"Ah, that is an affair of honesty,\" said the elder. \"If we want\nhonesty, I believe we must go back to the stars and stripes.\"\n\nMr. Glascock looked up from his plate almost aghast. He said nothing,\nhowever, but called for the waiter, and paid for his breakfast.\nNevertheless, there was a considerable amount of travelling\nfriendship engendered between the ladies and our two friends\nbefore the diligence had left the railway yard. They were two Miss\nSpaldings, going on to Florence, at which place they had an uncle,\nwho was minister from the States to the kingdom of Italy; and they\nwere not at all unwilling to receive such little civilities as\ngentlemen can give to ladies when travelling. The whole party\nintended to sleep at Turin that night, and they were altogether on\ngood terms with each other when they started on the journey from St.\nMichael.\n\n\"Clever women those,\" said Mr. Glascock, as soon as they had arranged\ntheir legs and arms in the banquette.\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"American women always are clever,--and are almost always pretty.\"\n\n\"I do not like them,\" said Trevelyan,--who in these days was in a\nmood to like nothing. \"They are exigeant;--and then they are so hard.\nThey want the weakness that a woman ought to have.\"\n\n\"That comes from what they would call your insular prejudice. We\nare accustomed to less self-assertion on the part of women than is\ncustomary with them. We prefer women to rule us by seeming to yield.\nIn the States, as I take it, the women never yield, and the men have\nto fight their own battles with other tactics.\"\n\n\"I don't know what their tactics are.\"\n\n\"They keep their distance. The men live much by themselves, as though\nthey knew they would not have a chance in the presence of their wives\nand daughters. Nevertheless they don't manage these things badly. You\nvery rarely hear of an American being separated from his wife.\"\n\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth, than Mr. Glascock knew,\nand remembered, and felt what he had said. There are occasions in\nwhich a man sins so deeply against fitness and the circumstances\nof the hour, that it becomes impossible for him to slur over his\nsin as though it had not been committed. There are certain little\npeccadilloes in society which one can manage to throw behind\none,--perhaps with some difficulty, and awkwardness; but still they\nare put aside, and conversation goes on, though with a hitch. But\nthere are graver offences, the gravity of which strikes the offender\nso seriously that it becomes impossible for him to seem even to\nignore his own iniquity. Ashes must be eaten publicly, and sackcloth\nworn before the eyes of men. It was so now with poor Mr. Glascock. He\nthought about it for a moment,--whether or no it was possible that\nhe should continue his remarks about the American ladies, without\nbetraying his own consciousness of the thing that he had done; and\nhe found that it was quite impossible. He knew that he was red up to\nhis hairs, and hot, and that his blood tingled. His blushes, indeed,\nwould not be seen in the seclusion of the banquette; but he could not\novercome the heat and the tingling. There was silence for about three\nminutes, and then he felt that it would be best for him to confess\nhis own fault. \"Trevelyan,\" he said, \"I am very sorry for the\nallusion that I made. I ought to have been less awkward, and I beg\nyour pardon.\"\n\n\"It does not matter,\" said Trevelyan. \"Of course I know that\neverybody is talking of it behind my back. I am not to expect that\npeople will be silent because I am unhappy.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless I beg your pardon,\" said the other.\n\nThere was but little further conversation between them till they\nreached Lanslebourg, at the foot of the mountain, at which place they\noccupied themselves with getting coffee for the two American ladies.\nThe Miss Spaldings took their coffee almost with as much grace as\nthough it had been handed to them by Frenchmen. And indeed they were\nvery gracious,--as is the nature of American ladies in spite of that\nhardness of which Trevelyan had complained. They assume an intimacy\nreadily, with no appearance of impropriety, and are at their ease\neasily. When, therefore, they were handed out of their carriage by\nMr. Glascock, the bystanders at Lanslebourg might have thought that\nthe whole party had been travelling together from New York. \"What\nshould we have done if you hadn't taken pity on us?\" said the elder\nlady. \"I don't think we could have climbed up into that high place;\nand look at the crowd that have come out of the interior. A man has\nsome advantages after all.\"\n\n\"I am quite in the dark as to what they are,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"He can give up his place to a lady, and can climb up into a\nbanquette.\"\n\n\"And he can be a member of Congress,\" said the younger. \"I'd sooner\nbe senator from Massachusetts than be the Queen of England.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"I'm glad we can agree about one\nthing.\"\n\nThe two gentlemen agreed to walk up the mountain together, and with\nsome trouble induced the conductor to permit them to do so. Why\nconductors of diligences should object to such relief to their horses\nthe ordinary Englishman can hardly understand. But in truth they\nfeel so deeply the responsibility which attaches itself to their\nshepherding of their sheep, that they are always fearing lest some\npoor lamb should go astray on the mountain side. And though the road\nbe broad and very plainly marked, the conductor never feels secure\nthat his passenger will find his way safely to the summit. He likes\nto know that each of his flock is in his right place, and disapproves\naltogether of an erratic spirit. But Mr. Glascock at last prevailed,\nand the two men started together up the mountain. When the permission\nhas been once obtained the walker may be sure that his guide and\nshepherd will not desert him.\n\n\"Of course I know,\" said Trevelyan, when the third twist up the\nmountain had been overcome, \"that people talk about me and my wife.\nIt is a part of the punishment for the mistake that one makes.\"\n\n\"It is a sad affair altogether.\"\n\n\"The saddest in the world. Lady Milborough has no doubt spoken to you\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; she has.\"\n\n\"How could she help it? I am not such a fool as to suppose that\npeople are to hold their tongues about me more than they do about\nothers. Intimate as she is with you, of course she has spoken to\nyou.\"\n\n\"I was in hopes that something might have been done by this time.\"\n\n\"Nothing has been done. Sometimes I think I shall put an end to\nmyself, it makes me so wretched.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you agree to forget and forgive and have done with\nit?\"\n\n\"That is so easily said;--so easily said.\" After this they walked on\nin silence for a considerable distance. Mr. Glascock was not anxious\nto talk about Trevelyan's wife, but he did wish to ask a question or\ntwo about Mrs. Trevelyan's sister, if only this could be done without\ntelling too much of his own secret. \"There's nothing I think so\ngrand, as walking up a mountain,\" he said after a while.\n\n\"It's all very well,\" said Trevelyan, in a tone which seemed to\nimply that to him in his present miserable condition all recreations,\nexercises, and occupations were mere leather and prunella.\n\n\"I don't mean, you know, in the Alpine Club way,\" said Glascock. \"I'm\ntoo old and too stiff for that. But when the path is good, and the\nair not too cold, and when it is neither snowing, nor thawing, nor\nraining, and when the sun isn't hot, and you've got plenty of time,\nand know that you can stop any moment you like and be pushed up by a\ncarriage, I do think walking up a mountain is very fine,--if you've\ngot proper shoes, and a good stick, and it isn't too soon after\ndinner. There's nothing like the air of Alps.\" And Mr. Glascock\nrenewed his pace, and stretched himself against the hill at the rate\nof three miles an hour.\n\n\"I used to be very fond of Switzerland,\" said Trevelyan, \"but I don't\ncare about it now. My eye has lost all its taste.\"\n\n\"It isn't the eye,\" said Glascock.\n\n\"Well; no. The truth is that when one is absolutely unhappy one\ncannot revel in the imagination. I don't believe in the miseries of\npoets.\"\n\n\"I think myself,\" said Glascock, \"that a poet should have a good\ndigestion. By-the-bye, Mrs. Trevelyan and her sister went down to\nNuncombe Putney, in Devonshire.\"\n\n\"They did go there.\"\n\n\"Have they moved since? A very pretty place is Nuncombe Putney.\"\n\n\"You have been there then?\"\n\nMr. Glascock blushed again. He was certainly an awkward man, saying\nthings that he ought not to say, and telling secrets which ought not\nto have been told. \"Well;--yes. I have been there,--as it happens.\"\n\n\"Just lately do you mean?\"\n\nMr. Glascock paused, hoping to find his way out of the scrape, but\nsoon perceived that there was no way out. He could not lie, even\nin an affair of love, and was altogether destitute of those honest\nsubterfuges,--subterfuges honest in such position,--of which a dozen\nwould have been at once at the command of any woman, and with one\nof which, sufficient for the moment, most men would have been able\nto arm themselves. \"Indeed, yes,\" he said, almost stammering as\nhe spoke. \"It was lately;--since your wife went there.\" Trevelyan,\nthough he had been told of the possibility of Mr. Glascock's\ncourtship, felt himself almost aggrieved by this man's intrusion\non his wife's retreat. Had he not sent her there that she might\nbe private; and what right had any one to invade such privacy? \"I\nsuppose I had better tell the truth at once,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"I\nwent to see Miss Rowley.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed.\"\n\n\"My secret will be safe with you, I know.\"\n\n\"I did not know that there was a secret,\" said Trevelyan. \"I should\nhave thought that they would have told me.\"\n\n\"I don't see that. However, it doesn't matter much. I got nothing by\nmy journey. Are the ladies still at Nuncombe Putney?\"\n\n\"No, they have moved from there to London.\"\n\n\"Not back to Curzon Street?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no. There is no house in Curzon Street for them now.\" This\nwas said in a tone so sad that it almost made Mr. Glascock weep.\n\"They are staying with an aunt of theirs,--out to the east of the\ncity.\"\n\n\"At St. Diddulph's?\"\n\n\"Yes;--with Mr. Outhouse, the clergyman there. You can't conceive\nwhat it is not to be able to see your own child; and yet, how can I\ntake the boy from her?\"\n\n\"Of course not. He's only a baby.\"\n\n\"And yet all this is brought on me solely by her obstinacy. God\nknows, however, I don't want to say a word against her. People choose\nto say that I am to blame, and they may say so for me. Nothing that\nany one may say can add anything to the weight that I have to bear.\"\nThen they walked to the top of the mountain in silence, and in due\ntime were picked up by their proper shepherd and carried down to Susa\nat a pace that would give an English coachman a concussion of the\nbrain.\n\nWhy passengers for Turin, who reach Susa dusty, tired, and sleepy,\nshould be detained at that place for an hour and a half instead of\nbeing forwarded to their beds in the great city, is never made very\napparent. All travelling officials on the continent of Europe are\nvery slow in their manipulation of luggage; but as they are equally\ncorrect we will find the excuse for their tardiness in the latter\nquality. The hour and a half, however, is a necessity, and it is very\ngrievous. On this occasion the two Miss Spaldings ate their supper,\nand the two gentlemen waited on them. The ladies had learned to\nregard at any rate Mr. Glascock as their own property, and received\nhis services, graciously indeed, but quite as a matter of course.\nWhen he was sent from their peculiar corner of the big, dirty\nrefreshment room to the supper-table to fetch an apple, and then\ndesired to change it because the one which he had brought was\nspotted, he rather liked it. And when he sat down with his knees\nnear to theirs, actually trying to eat a large Italian apple himself\nsimply because they had eaten one, and discussed with them the\npassage over the Mont Cenis, he began to think that Susa was, after\nall, a place in which an hour and a half might be whiled away without\nmuch cause for complaint.\n\n\"We only stay one night at Turin,\" said Caroline Spalding, the elder.\n\n\"And we shall have to start at ten,--to get through to Florence\nto-morrow,\" said Olivia, the younger. \"Isn't it cruel, wasting all\nthis time when we might be in bed?\"\n\n\"It is not for me to complain of the cruelty,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"We should have fared infinitely worse if we hadn't met you,\" said\nCaroline Spalding.\n\n\"But our republican simplicity won't allow us to assert that even\nyour society is better than going to bed, after a journey of thirty\nhours,\" said Olivia.\n\nIn the meantime Trevelyan was roaming about the station moodily by\nhimself, and the place is one not apt to restore cheerfulness to a\nmoody man by any resources of its own. When the time for departure\ncame Mr. Glascock sought him and found him; but Trevelyan had chosen\na corner for himself in a carriage, and declared that he would rather\navoid the ladies for the present. \"Don't think me uncivil to leave\nyou,\" he said, \"but the truth is, I don't like American ladies.\"\n\n\"I do rather,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"You can say that I've got a headache,\" said Trevelyan. So Mr.\nGlascock returned to his friends, and did say that Mr. Trevelyan had\na headache. It was the first time that a name had been mentioned\nbetween them.\n\n\"Mr. Trevelyan! What a pretty name. It sounds like a novel,\" said\nOlivia.\n\n\"A very clever man,\" said Mr. Glascock, \"and much liked by his own\ncircle. But he has had trouble, and is unhappy.\"\n\n\"He looks unhappy,\" said Caroline.\n\n\"The most miserable looking man I ever saw in my life,\" said Olivia.\nThen it was agreed between them as they went up to Trompetta's hotel,\nthat they would go on together by the ten o'clock train to Florence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nVERDICT OF THE JURY--\"MAD, MY LORD.\"\n\n\nTrevelyan was left alone at Turin when Mr. Glascock went on to\nFlorence with his fair American friends. It was imperatively\nnecessary that he should remain at Turin, though he had no business\nthere of any kind whatever, and did not know a single person in the\ncity. And of all towns in Italy Turin has perhaps less of attraction\nto offer to the solitary visitor than any other. It is new and\nparallelogrammatic as an American town, is very cold in cold weather,\nvery hot in hot weather, and now that it has been robbed of its life\nas a capital, is as dull and uninteresting as though it were German\nor English. There is the Armoury, and the river Po, and a good hotel.\nBut what are these things to a man who is forced to live alone in a\nplace for four days, or perhaps a week? Trevelyan was bound to remain\nat Turin till he should hear from Bozzle. No one but Bozzle knew his\naddress; and he could do nothing till Bozzle should have communicated\nto him tidings of what was being done at St. Diddulph's.\n\nThere is perhaps no great social question so imperfectly understood\namong us at the present day as that which refers to the line which\ndivides sanity from insanity. That this man is sane and that other\nunfortunately mad we do know well enough; and we know also that one\nman may be subject to various hallucinations,--may fancy himself to\nbe a teapot, or what not,--and yet be in such a condition of mind as\nto call for no intervention either on behalf of his friends, or of\nthe law; while another may be in possession of intellectual faculties\ncapable of lucid exertion for the highest purposes, and yet be so mad\nthat bodily restraint upon him is indispensable. We know that the\nsane man is responsible for what he does, and that the insane man\nis irresponsible; but we do not know,--we only guess wildly, at the\nstate of mind of those, who now and again act like madmen, though no\ncourt or council of experts has declared them to be mad. The bias of\nthe public mind is to press heavily on such men till the law attempts\nto touch them, as though they were thoroughly responsible; and\nthen, when the law interferes, to screen them as though they were\naltogether irresponsible. The same juryman who would find a man mad\nwho has murdered a young woman, would in private life express a\ndesire that the same young man should be hung, crucified, or skinned\nalive, if he had moodily and without reason broken his faith to the\nyoung woman in lieu of killing her. Now Trevelyan was, in truth, mad\non the subject of his wife's alleged infidelity. He had abandoned\neverything that he valued in the world, and had made himself wretched\nin every affair of life, because he could not submit to acknowledge\nto himself the possibility of error on his own part. For that, in\ntruth, was the condition of his mind. He had never hitherto believed\nthat she had been false to her vow, and had sinned against him\nirredeemably; but he had thought that in her regard for another man\nshe had slighted him; and, so thinking, he had subjected her to a\nseverity of rebuke which no high-spirited woman could have borne. His\nwife had not tried to bear it,--in her indignation had not striven to\ncure the evil. Then had come his resolution that she should submit,\nor part from him; and, having so resolved, nothing could shake him.\nThough every friend he possessed was now against him,--including\neven Lady Milborough,--he was certain that he was right. Had not his\nwife sworn to obey him, and was not her whole conduct one tissue of\ndisobedience? Would not the man who submitted to this find himself\ndriven to submit to things worse? Let her own her fault, let her\nsubmit, and then she should come back to him.\n\nHe had not considered, when his resolutions to this effect were first\nforming themselves, that a separation between a man and his wife once\neffected cannot be annulled, and as it were cured, so as to leave no\ncicatrice behind. Gradually, as he spent day after day in thinking on\nthis one subject, he came to feel that even were his wife to submit,\nto own her fault humbly, and to come back to him, this very coming\nback would in itself be a new wound. Could he go out again with\nhis wife on his arm to the houses of those who knew that he had\nrepudiated her because of her friendship with another man? Could\nhe open again that house in Curzon Street, and let things go on\nquietly as they had gone before? He told himself that it was\nimpossible;--that he and she were ineffably disgraced;--that, if\nreunited, they must live buried out of sight in some remote distance.\nAnd he told himself, also, that he could never be with her again\nnight or day without thinking of the separation. His happiness had\nbeen shipwrecked.\n\nThen he had put himself into the hands of Mr. Bozzle, and Mr. Bozzle\nhad taught him that women very often do go astray. Mr. Bozzle's idea\nof female virtue was not high, and he had opportunities of implanting\nhis idea on his client's mind. Trevelyan hated the man. He was filled\nwith disgust by Bozzle's words, and was made miserable by Bozzle's\npresence. Yet he came gradually to believe in Bozzle. Bozzle alone\nbelieved in him. There were none but Bozzle who did not bid him to\nsubmit himself to his disobedient wife. And then, as he came to\nbelieve in Bozzle, he grew to be more and more assured that no one\nbut Bozzle could tell him facts. His chivalry, and love, and sense of\nwoman's honour, with something of manly pride on his own part,--so\nhe told himself,--had taught him to believe it to be impossible that\nhis wife should have sinned. Bozzle, who knew the world, thought\notherwise. Bozzle, who had no interest in the matter, one way or the\nother, would find out facts. What if his chivalry, and love, and\nmanly pride had deceived him? There were women who sinned. Then he\nprayed that his wife might not be such a woman; and got up from his\nprayers almost convinced that she was a sinner.\n\nHis mind was at work upon it always. Could it be that she was so base\nas this--so vile a thing, so abject, such dirt, pollution, filth? But\nthere were such cases. Nay, were they not almost numberless? He found\nhimself reading in the papers records of such things from day to\nday, and thought that in doing so he was simply acquiring experience\nnecessary for himself. If it were so, he had indeed done well to\nseparate himself from a thing so infamous. And if it were not so,\nhow could it be that that man had gone to her in Devonshire? He had\nreceived from his wife's hands a short note addressed to the man, in\nwhich the man was desired by her not to go to her, or to write to\nher again, because of her husband's commands. He had shown this to\nBozzle, and Bozzle had smiled. \"It's just the sort of thing they\ndoes,\" Bozzle had said. \"Then they writes another by post.\" He had\nconsulted Bozzle as to the sending on of that letter, and Bozzle had\nbeen strongly of opinion that it should be forwarded, a copy having\nbeen duly taken and attested by himself. It might be very pretty\nevidence by-and-by. If the letter were not forwarded, Bozzle thought\nthat the omission to do so might be given in evidence against his\nemployer. Bozzle was very careful, and full of \"evidence.\" The letter\ntherefore was sent on to Colonel Osborne. \"If there's billy-dous\ngoing between 'em we shall nobble 'em,\" said Bozzle. Trevelyan tore\nhis hair in despair, but believed that there would be billy-dous.\n\nHe came to believe everything; and, though he prayed fervently that\nhis wife might not be led astray, that she might be saved at any\nrate from utter vice, yet he almost came to hope that it might be\notherwise;--not, indeed, with the hope of the sane man, who desires\nthat which he tells himself to be for his advantage; but with the\nhope of the insane man, who loves to feed his grievance, even though\nthe grief should be his death. They who do not understand that a man\nmay be brought to hope that which of all things is the most grievous\nto him, have not observed with sufficient closeness the perversity of\nthe human mind. Trevelyan would have given all that he had to save\nhis wife; would, even now, have cut his tongue out before he would\nhave expressed to anyone,--save to Bozzle,--a suspicion that she\ncould in truth have been guilty; was continually telling himself that\nfurther life would be impossible to him, if he, and she, and that\nchild of theirs, should be thus disgraced;--and yet he expected it,\nbelieved it, and, after a fashion, he almost hoped it.\n\nHe was to wait at Turin till tidings should come from Bozzle, and\nafter that he would go on to Venice; but he would not move from Turin\ntill he should have received his first communication from England.\nWhen he had been three days at Turin they came to him, and, among\nother letters in Bozzle's packet, there was a letter addressed in his\nwife's handwriting. The letter was simply directed to Bozzle's house.\nIn what possible way could his wife have found out ought of his\ndealings with Bozzle,--where Bozzle lived, or could have learned that\nletters intended for him should be sent to the man's own residence?\nBefore, however, we inspect the contents of Mr. Bozzle's dispatch, we\nwill go back and see how Mrs. Trevelyan had discovered the manner of\nforwarding a letter to her husband.\n\nThe matter of the address was, indeed, very simple. All letters for\nTrevelyan were to be redirected from the house in Curzon Street, and\nfrom the chambers in Lincoln's Inn, to the Acrobats' Club; to the\nporter of the Acrobats' Club had been confided the secret, not of\nBozzle's name, but of Bozzle's private address, No. 55, Stony Walk,\nUnion Street, Borough. Thus all letters reaching the Acrobats' were\nduly sent to Mr. Bozzle's house. It may be remembered that Hugh\nStanbury, on the occasion of his last visit to the parsonage of St.\nDiddulph's, was informed that Mrs. Trevelyan had a letter from her\nfather for her husband, and that she knew not whither to send it.\nIt may well be that, had the matter assumed no other interest in\nStanbury's eyes than that given to it by Mrs. Trevelyan's very\nmoderate anxiety to have the letter forwarded, he would have thought\nnothing about it; but having resolved, as he sat upon the knife-board\nof the omnibus,--the reader will, at any rate, remember those\nresolutions made on the top of the omnibus while Hugh was smoking his\npipe,--having resolved that a deed should be done at St. Diddulph's,\nhe resolved also that it should be done at once. He would not allow\nthe heat of his purpose to be cooled by delay. He would go to St.\nDiddulph's at once, with his heart in his hand. But it might, he\nthought, be as well that he should have an excuse for his visit.\nSo he called upon the porter at the Acrobats', and was successful\nin learning Mr. Trevelyan's address. \"Stony Walk, Union Street,\nBorough,\" he said to himself, wondering; then it occurred to him\nthat Bozzle, and Bozzle only among Trevelyan's friends, could\nlive at Stony Walk in the Borough. Thus armed, he set out for St.\nDiddulph's;--and, as one of the effects of his visit to the East, Sir\nMarmaduke's note was forwarded to Louis Trevelyan at Turin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nMISS NORA ROWLEY IS MALTREATED.\n\n\nHugh Stanbury, when he reached the parsonage, found no difficulty\nin making his way into the joint presence of Mrs. Outhouse, Mrs.\nTrevelyan, and Nora. He was recognised by the St. Diddulph's party\nas one who had come over to their side, as a friend of Trevelyan\nwho had found himself constrained to condemn his friend in spite of\nhis friendship, and was consequently very welcome. And there was\nno difficulty about giving the address. The ladies wondered how it\ncame to pass that Mr. Trevelyan's letters should be sent to such\na locality, and Hugh expressed his surprise also. He thought it\ndiscreet to withhold his suspicions about Mr. Bozzle, and simply\nexpressed his conviction that letters sent in accordance with the\ndirections given by the club-porter would reach their destination.\nThen the boy was brought down, and they were all very confidential\nand very unhappy together. Mrs. Trevelyan could see no end to the\ncruelty of her position, and declared that her father's anger against\nher husband was so great that she anticipated his coming with almost\nmore of fear than of hope. Mrs. Outhouse expressed an opinion that\nMr. Trevelyan must surely be mad; and Nora suggested that the\npossibility of such perversity on the part of a man made it almost\nunwise in any woman to trust herself to the power of a husband. \"But\nthere are not many like him, thank God,\" said Mrs. Outhouse, bridling\nin her wrath. Thus they were very friendly together, and Hugh\nwas allowed to feel that he stood upon comfortable terms in the\nparsonage;--but he did not as yet see how he was to carry out his\nproject for the present day.\n\nAt last Mrs. Trevelyan went away with the child. Hugh felt that he\nought to go, but stayed courageously. He thought he could perceive\nthat Nora suspected the cause of his assiduity; but it was quite\nevident that Mrs. Outhouse did not do so. Mrs. Outhouse, having\nreconciled herself to the young man, was by no means averse to his\npresence. She went on talking about the wickedness of Trevelyan, and\nher brother's anger, and the fate of the little boy, till at last the\nlittle boy's mother came back into the room. Then Mrs. Outhouse went.\nThey must excuse her for a few minutes, she said. If only she would\nhave gone a few minutes sooner, how well her absence might have been\nexcused. Nora understood it all now; and though she became almost\nbreathless, she was not surprised, when Hugh got up from his chair\nand asked her sister to go away. \"Mrs. Trevelyan,\" he said, \"I want\nto speak a few words to your sister. I hope you will give me the\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"Nora!\" exclaimed Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"She knows nothing about it,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Am I to go?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan to her sister. But Nora said never\na word. She sat perfectly fixed, not turning her eyes from the object\non which she was gazing.\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"Am I to go?\"]\n\n\n\"Pray,--pray do,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"I cannot think that it will be for any good,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan;\n\"but I know that she may be trusted. And I suppose it ought to be so,\nif you wish it.\"\n\n\"I do wish it, of all things,\" said Hugh, still standing up, and\nalmost turning the elder sister out of the room by the force of his\nlook and voice. Then, with another pause of a moment, Mrs. Trevelyan\nrose from her chair and left the room, closing the door after her.\n\nHugh, when he found that the coast was clear for him, immediately\nbegan his task with a conviction that not a moment was to be lost.\nHe had told himself a dozen times that the matter was hopeless,\nthat Nora had shown him by every means in her power that she was\nindifferent to him, that she with all her friends would know that\nsuch a marriage was out of the question; and he had in truth come\nto believe that the mission which he had in hand was one in which\nsuccess was not possible. But he thought that it was his duty to go\non with it. \"If a man love a woman, even though it be the king and\nthe beggar-woman reversed,--though it be a beggar and a queen, he\nshould tell her of it. If it be so, she has a right to know it and to\ntake her choice. And he has a right to tell her, and to say what he\ncan for himself.\" Such was Hugh's doctrine in the matter; and, acting\nupon it, he found himself alone with his mistress.\n\n\"Nora,\" he said, speaking perhaps with more energy than the words\nrequired, \"I have come here to tell you that I love you, and to ask\nyou to be my wife.\"\n\nNora, for the last ten minutes, had been thinking that this would\ncome,--that it would come at once; and yet she was not at all\nprepared with an answer. It was now weeks since she had confessed to\nherself frankly that nothing else but this,--this one thing which was\nnow happening, this one thing which had now happened,--that nothing\nelse could make her happy, or could touch her happiness. She had\nrefused a man whom she otherwise would have taken, because her heart\nhad been given to Hugh Stanbury. She had been bold enough to tell\nthat other suitor that it was so, though she had not mentioned the\nrival's name. She had longed for some expression of love from this\nman when they had been at Nuncombe together, and had been fiercely\nangry with him because no such expression had come from him. Day\nafter day, since she had been with her aunt, she had told herself\nthat she was a broken-hearted woman, because she had given away all\nthat she had to give and had received nothing in return. Had he said\na word that might have given her hope, how happy could she have been\nin hoping. Now he had come to her with a plain-spoken offer, telling\nher that he loved her, and asking her to be his wife,--and she was\naltogether unable to answer. How could she consent to be his wife,\nknowing as she did that there was no certainty of an income on which\nthey could live? How could she tell her father and mother that she\nhad engaged herself to marry a man who might or might not make \u00c2\u00a3400 a\nyear, and who already had a mother and sister depending on him?\n\nIn truth, had he come more gently to her, his chance of a happy\nanswer,--of an answer which might be found to have in it something\nof happiness,--would have been greater. He might have said a word\nwhich she could not but have answered softly;--and then from that\nconstrained softness other gentleness would have followed, and so\nhe would have won her in spite of her discretion. She would have\nsurrendered gradually, accepting on the score of her great love all\nthe penalties of a long and precarious engagement. But when she\nwas asked to come and be his wife, now and at once, she felt that\nin spite of her love it was impossible that she could accede to a\nrequest so sudden, so violent, so monstrous. He stood over her as\nthough expecting an instant answer; and then, when she had sat dumb\nbefore him for a minute, he repeated his demand. \"Tell me, Nora, can\nyou love me? If you knew how thoroughly I have loved you, you would\nat least feel something for me.\"\n\nTo tell him that she did not love him was impossible to her. But how\nwas she to refuse him without telling him either a lie, or the truth?\nSome answer she must give him; and as to that matter of marrying him,\nthe answer must be a negative. Her education had been of that nature\nwhich teaches girls to believe that it is a crime to marry a man\nwithout an assured income. Assured morality in a husband is a great\nthing. Assured good temper is very excellent. Assured talent,\nreligion, amiability, truth, honesty, are all desirable. But an\nassured income is indispensable. Whereas, in truth, the income may\ncome hereafter; but the other things, unless they be there already,\nwill hardly be forthcoming. \"Mr. Stanbury,\" she said, \"your\nsuddenness has quite astounded me.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; but how should I not be sudden? I have come here on purpose\nto say this to you. If I do not say it now--\"\n\n\"You heard what Emily said.\"\n\n\"No;--what did she say?\"\n\n\"She said that it would not be for good that you should speak to me\nthus.\"\n\n\"Why not for good? But she is unhappy, and looks gloomily at things.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"But all the world need not be sad for ever because she has been\nunfortunate.\"\n\n\"Not all the world, Mr. Stanbury;--but you must not be surprised if\nit affects me.\"\n\n\"But would that prevent your loving me,--if you did love me? But,\nNora, I do not expect you to love me,--not yet. I do not say that I\nexpect it,--ever. But if you would--. Nora, I can do no more than\ntell you the simple truth. Just listen to me for a minute. You know\nhow I came to be intimate with you all in Curzon Street. The first\nday I saw you I loved you; and there has come no change yet. It is\nmonths now since I first knew that I loved you. Well; I told myself\nmore than once,--when I was down at Nuncombe for instance,--that I\nhad no right to speak to you. What right can a poor devil like me\nhave, who lives from hand to mouth, to ask such a girl as you to be\nhis wife? And so I said nothing,--though it was on my lips every\nmoment that I was there.\" Nora remembered at the moment how she had\nlooked to his lips, and had not seen the words there. \"But I think\nthere is something unmanly in this. If you cannot give me a grain\nof hope;--if you tell me that there never can be hope, it is my\nmisfortune. It will be very grievous, but I will bear it. But that\nwill be better than puling and moping about without daring to tell my\ntale. I am not ashamed of it. I have fallen in love with you, Nora,\nand I think it best to come for an answer.\"\n\nHe held out his arms as though he thought that she might perhaps come\nto him. Indeed he had no idea of any such coming on her part; but\nshe, as she looked at him, almost thought that it was her duty to go.\nHad she a right to withhold herself from him, she who loved him so\ndearly? Had he stepped forward and taken her in his arms it might be\nthat all power of refusal would soon have been beyond her power.\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury,\" she said, \"you have confessed yourself that it is\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"But do you love me;--do you think that it is possible that you\nshould ever love me?\"\n\n\"You know, Mr. Stanbury, that you should not say anything further.\nYou know that it cannot be.\"\n\n\"But do you love me?\"\n\n\"You are ungenerous not to take an answer without driving me to be\nuncourteous.\"\n\n\"I do not care for courtesy. Tell me the truth. Can you ever love me?\nWith one word of hope I will wait, and work, and feel myself to be a\nhero. I will not go till you tell me that you cannot love me.\"\n\n\"Then I must tell you so.\"\n\n\"What is it you will tell me, Nora? Speak it. Say it. If I knew that\na girl disliked me, nothing should make me press myself upon her. Am\nI odious to you, Nora?\"\n\n\"No; not odious,--but very, very unfair.\"\n\n\"I will have the truth if I be ever so unfair,\" he said. And by this\ntime probably some inkling of the truth had reached his intelligence.\nThere was already a tear in Nora's eye, but he did not pity her. She\nowed it to him to tell him the truth, and he would have it from her\nif it was to be reached. \"Nora,\" he said, \"listen to me again. All my\nheart and soul are in this. It is everything to me. If you can love\nme you are bound to say so. By Jove, I will believe you do unless you\nswear to me that it is not so!\" He was now holding her by the hand\nand looking closely into her face.\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury,\" she said, \"let me go; pray, pray let me go.\"\n\n\"Not till you say that you love me. Oh, Nora, I believe that you love\nme. You do; yes; you do love me. Dearest, dearest Nora, would you not\nsay a word to make me the happiest man in the world?\" And now he had\nhis arm round her waist.\n\n\"Let me go,\" she said, struggling through her tears and covering her\nface with her hands. \"You are very, very wicked. I will never speak\nto you again. Nay, but you shall let me go!\" And then she was out of\nhis arms and had escaped from the room before he had managed to touch\nher face with his lips.\n\nAs he was thinking how he also might escape now,--might escape\nand comfort himself with his triumph,--Mrs. Outhouse returned to\nthe chamber. She was very demure, and her manner towards him was\nconsiderably changed since she had left the chamber. \"Mr. Stanbury,\"\nshe said, \"this kind of thing mustn't go any further indeed;--at\nleast not in my house.\"\n\n\"What kind of thing, Mrs. Outhouse?\"\n\n\"Well;--what my elder niece has told me. I have not seen Miss Rowley\nsince she left you. I am quite sure she has behaved with discretion.\"\n\n\"Indeed she has, Mrs. Outhouse.\"\n\n\"The fact is my nieces are in grief and trouble, and this is no time\nor place for love-making. I am sorry to be uncivil, but I must ask\nyou not to come here any more.\"\n\n\"I will stay away from this house, certainly, if you bid me.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry; but I must bid you. Sir Marmaduke will be home in\nthe spring, and if you have anything to say to him of course you can\nsee him.\"\n\nThen Hugh Stanbury took his leave of Mrs. Outhouse; but as he went\nhome, again on the knifeboard of an omnibus, he smoked the pipe of\ntriumph rather than the pipe of contemplation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n\"C. G.\"\n\n\nThe Miss Spaldings were met at the station at Florence by their\nuncle, the American Minister, by their cousin, the American Secretary\nof Legation, and by three or four other dear friends and relations,\nwho were there to welcome the newcomers to sunny Italy. Mr. Glascock,\ntherefore, who ten minutes since had been, and had felt himself to\nbe, quite indispensable to their comfort, suddenly became as though\nhe were nothing and nobody. Who is there that has not felt these\nsudden disruptions to the intimacies and friendships of a long\njourney? He bowed to them, and they to him, and then they were\nwhirled away in their grandeur. He put himself into a small, open\nhackney-carriage, and had himself driven to the York Hotel, feeling\nhimself to be deserted and desolate. The two Miss Spaldings were\nthe daughters of a very respectable lawyer at Boston, whereas Mr.\nGlascock was heir to a peerage, to an enormous fortune, and to one of\nthe finest places in England. But he thought nothing of this at the\ntime. As he went he was meditating which young woman was the most\nattractive, Nora Rowley or Caroline Spalding. He had no doubt but\nthat Nora was the prettier, the pleasanter in manner, the better\ndressed, the more engaging in all that concerned the outer woman;\nbut he thought that he had never met any lady who talked better than\nCaroline Spalding. And what was Nora Rowley's beauty to him? Had she\nnot told him that she was the property of some one else; or, for the\nmatter of that, what was Miss Spalding to him? They had parted, and\nhe was going on to Naples in two days. He had said some half-defined\nword as to calling at the American Embassy, but it had not been taken\nup by either of the ladies. He had not pressed it, and so they had\nparted without an understanding as to a future meeting.\n\nThe double journey, from Turin to Bologna and from Bologna to\nFlorence, is very long, and forms ample time for a considerable\nintimacy. There had, too, been a long day's journeying together\nbefore that; and with no women is a speedy intimacy so possible, or\nindeed so profitable, as with Americans. They fear nothing,--neither\nyou nor themselves; and talk with as much freedom as though they\nwere men. It may, perhaps, be assumed to be true as a rule that\nwomen's society is always more agreeable to men than that of other\nmen,--except for the lack of ease. It undoubtedly is so when the\nwomen be young and pretty. There is a feeling, however, among pretty\nwomen in Europe that such freedom is dangerous, and it is withheld.\nThere is such danger, and more or less of such withholding is\nexpedient: but the American woman does not recognise the danger; and,\nif she withhold the grace of her countenance and the pearls of her\nspeech, it is because she is not desirous of the society which is\nproffered to her. These two American sisters had not withholden their\npearls from Mr. Glascock. He was much their senior in age; he was\ngentle in his manners, and they probably recognised him to be a safe\ncompanion. They had no idea who he was, and had not heard his name\nwhen they parted from him. But it was not probable that they should\nhave been with him so long, and that they should leave him without\nfurther thought of him, without curiosity or a desire to know more\nof him. They had seen \"C. G.\" in large letters on his dressing-bag,\nand that was all they had learned as to his identity. He had known\ntheir names well, and had once called Olivia by hers, in the\nhurry of speaking to her sister. He had apologised, and there had\nbeen a little laugh, and a discussion about the use of Christian\nnames,--such as is very conducive to intimacy between gentlemen and\nladies. When you can talk to a young lady about her own Christian\nname, you are almost entitled for the nonce to use it.\n\nMr. Glascock went to his hotel, and was very moody and desolate. His\nname was very soon known there, and he received the honours due to\nhis rank and station. \"I should like to travel in America,\" he said\nto himself, \"if I could be sure that no one would find out who I\nwas.\" He had received letters at Turin, stating that his father was\nbetter, and, therefore, he intended to remain two days at Florence.\nThe weather was still very hot, and Florence in the middle of\nSeptember is much preferable to Naples.\n\nThat night, when the two Miss Spaldings were alone together, they\ndiscussed their fellow-traveller thoroughly. Something, of course,\nhad been said about him to their uncle the minister, to their aunt\nthe minister's wife, and to their cousin the secretary of legation.\nBut travellers will always observe that the dear new friends they\nhave made on their journey are not interesting to the dear old\nfriends whom they meet afterwards. There may be some touch of\njealousy in this; and then, though you, the traveller, are fully\naware that there has been something special in the case which has\nmade this new friendship more peculiar than others that have sprung\nup in similar circumstances, fathers and brothers and wives and\nsisters do not see it in that light. They suspect, perhaps, that\nthe new friend was a bagman, or an opera dancer, and think that the\naffair need not be made of importance. The American Minister had\ncast his eye on Mr. Glascock during that momentary parting, and had\nnot thought much of Mr. Glascock. \"He was certainly a gentleman,\"\nCaroline had said. \"There are a great many English gentlemen,\" the\nminister had replied.\n\n\"I thought you would have asked him to call,\" Olivia said to her\nsister. \"He did offer.\"\n\n\"I know he did. I heard it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell him he might come?\"\n\n\"Because we are not in Boston, Livy. It might be the most horrible\nthing in the world to do here in Florence; and it may make a\ndifference, because Uncle Jonas is minister.\"\n\n\"Why should that make a difference? Do you mean that one isn't to see\none's own friends? That must be nonsense.\"\n\n\"But he isn't a friend, Livy.\"\n\n\"It seems to me as if I'd known him for ever. That soft, monotonous\nvoice, which never became excited and never disagreeable, is as\nfamiliar to me as though I had lived with it all my life.\"\n\n\"I thought him very pleasant.\"\n\n\"Indeed you did, Carry. And he thought you pleasant too. Doesn't it\nseem odd? You were mending his glove for him this very afternoon,\njust as if he were your brother.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I mend his glove?\"\n\n\"Why not, indeed? He was entitled to have everything mended after\ngetting us such a good dinner at Bologna. By-the-bye, you never paid\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,--when you were not by.\"\n\n\"I wonder who he is! C. G.! That fine man in the brown coat was his\nservant, you know. I thought at first that C. G. must have been\ncracked, and that the tall man was his keeper.\"\n\n\"I never knew any one less like a madman.\"\n\n\"No;--but the man was so queer. He did nothing, you know. We hardly\nsaw him, if you remember, at Turin. All he did was to tie the shawls\nat Bologna. What can any man want with another man about with him\nlike that, unless he is cracked either in body or mind?\"\n\n\"You'd better ask C. G. yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall never see C. G. again, I suppose. I should like to see him\nagain. I guess you would too, Carry. Eh?\"\n\n\"Of course, I should;--why not?\"\n\n\"I never knew a man so imperturbable, and who had yet so much to say\nfor himself. I wonder what he is! Perhaps he's on business, and that\nman was a kind of a clerk.\"\n\n\"He had livery buttons on,\" said Carry.\n\n\"And does that make a difference?\"\n\n\"I don't think they put clerks into livery, even in England.\"\n\n\"Nor yet mad doctors,\" said Olivia. \"Well, I like him very much; and\nthe only thing against him is that he should have a man, six feet\nhigh, going about with him doing nothing.\"\n\n\"You'll make me angry, Livy, if you talk in that way. It's\nuncharitable.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"About a mad doctor.\"\n\n\"It's my belief,\" said Olivia, \"that he's an English swell, a lord,\nor a duke;--and it's my belief, too, that he's in love with you.\"\n\n\"It's my belief, Livy, that you're a regular ass;\"--and so the\nconversation was ended on that occasion.\n\nOn the next day, about noon, the American Minister, as a part of the\nduty which he owed to his country, read in a publication of that day,\nissued for the purpose, the names of the new arrivals at Florence.\nFirst and foremost was that of the Honourable Charles Glascock, with\nhis suite, at the York Hotel, en route to join his father, Lord\nPeterborough, at Naples. Having read the news first to himself, the\nminister read it out loud in the presence of his nieces.\n\n\"That's our friend C. G.,\" said Livy.\n\n\"I should think not,\" said the minister, who had his own ideas about\nan English lord.\n\n\"I'm sure it is, because of the tall man with the buttons,\" said\nOlivia.\n\n\"It's very unlikely,\" said the secretary of legation. \"Lord\nPeterborough is a man of immense wealth, very old, indeed. They say\nhe is dying at Naples. This man is his eldest son.\"\n\n\"Is that any reason why he shouldn't have been civil to us?\" asked\nOlivia.\n\n\"I don't think he is the sort of man likely to sit up in the\nbanquette; and he would have posted over the Alps. Moreover, he had\nhis suite with him.\"\n\n\"His suite was Buttons,\" said Olivia. \"Only fancy, Carry, we've been\nwaited on for two days by a lord as is to be, and didn't know it! And\nyou have mended the tips of his lordship's glove!\" But Carry said\nnothing at all.\n\nLate on that same evening, they met Mr. Glascock close to the Duomo,\nunder the shade of the Campanile. He had come out as they had done,\nto see by moonlight that loveliest of all works made by man's hands.\nThey were with the minister, but Mr. Glascock came up and shook hands\nwith them.\n\n\"I would introduce you to my uncle, Mr. Spalding,\" said\nOlivia,--\"only,--as it happens,--we have never yet heard your name.\"\n\n\"My name is Mr. Glascock,\" said he, smiling. Then the introduction\nwas made; and the American Minister took off his hat, and was very\naffable.\n\n\"Only think, Carry,\" said Olivia, when they were alone that evening,\n\"if you were to become the wife of an English lord!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nSHEWING WHAT TOOK PLACE AT ST. DIDDULPH'S.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nNora Rowley, when she escaped from the violence of her lover, at once\nrushed up to her own room, and managed to fasten herself in before\nshe had been seen by any one. Her elder sister had at once gone to\nher aunt when, at Hugh's request, she had left the room, thinking it\nright that Mrs. Outhouse should know what was being done in her own\nhouse. Mrs. Outhouse had considered the matter patiently for awhile,\ngiving the lovers the benefit of her hesitation, and had then spoken\nher mind to Stanbury, as we have already heard. He had, upon the\nwhole, been so well pleased with what had occurred, that he was not\nin the least angry with the parson's wife when he left the parsonage.\nAs soon as he was gone Mrs. Outhouse was at once joined by her elder\nniece, but Nora remained for a while alone in her room.\n\nHad she committed herself; and if so, did she regret it? He had\nbehaved very badly to her, certainly, taking her by the hand and\nputting his arm round her waist. And then had he not even attempted\nto kiss her? He had done all this, although she had been resolute in\nrefusing to speak to him one word of kindness,--though she had told\nhim with all the energy and certainty of which she was mistress, that\nshe would never be his wife. If a girl were to be subjected to such\ntreatment as this when she herself had been so firm, so discreet,\nso decided, then indeed it would be unfit that a girl should trust\nherself with a man. She had never thought that he had been such a one\nas that, to ill-use her, to lay a hand on her in violence, to refuse\nto take an answer. She threw herself on the bed and sobbed, and\nthen hid her face,--and was conscious that in spite of this acting\nbefore herself she was the happiest girl alive. He had behaved very\nbadly;--of course, he had behaved most wickedly, and she would tell\nhim so some day. But was he not the dearest fellow living? Did ever\nman speak with more absolute conviction of love in every tone of\nhis voice? Was it not the finest, noblest heart that ever throbbed\nbeneath a waistcoat? Had not his very wickedness come from the\noverpowering truth of his affection for her? She would never quite\nforgive him because it had been so very wrong; but she would be\ntrue to him for ever and ever. Of course they could not marry.\nWhat!--would she go to him and be a clog round his neck, and a weight\nupon him for ever, bringing him down to the gutter by the burden of\nher own useless and unworthy self? No. She would never so injure\nhim. She would not even hamper him by an engagement. But yet she\nwould be true to him. She had an idea that in spite of all her\nprotestations,--which, as she looked back upon them, appeared to her\nto have been louder than they had been,--that through the teeth of\nher denials, something of the truth had escaped from her. Well,--let\nit be so. It was the truth, and why should he not know it? Then\nshe pictured to herself a long romance, in which the heroine lived\nhappily on the simple knowledge that she had been beloved. And\nthe reader may be sure that in this romance Mr. Glascock with his\nsplendid prospects filled one of the characters.\n\nShe had been so wretched at Nuncombe Putney when she had felt herself\nconstrained to admit to herself that this man for whom she had\nsacrificed herself did not care for her, that she could not now but\nenjoy her triumph. After she had sobbed upon the bed, she got up and\nwalked about the room smiling; and she would now press her hands to\nher forehead, and then shake her tresses, and then clasp her own left\nhand with her right, as though he were still holding it. Wicked man!\nWhy had he been so wicked and so violent? And why, why, why had she\nnot once felt his lips upon her brow?\n\nAnd she was pleased with herself. Her sister had rebuked her because\nshe had refused to make her fortune by marrying Mr. Glascock; and,\nto own the truth, she had rebuked herself on the same score when she\nfound that Hugh Stanbury had not had a word of love to say to her. It\nwas not that she regretted the grandeur which she had lost, but that\nshe should, even within her own thoughts, with the consciousness of\nher own bosom, have declared herself unable to receive another man's\ndevotion because of her love for this man who neglected her. Now\nshe was proud of herself. Whether it might be accounted as good or\nill-fortune that she had ever seen Hugh Stanbury, it must at any rate\nbe right that she should be true to him now that she had seen him\nand had loved him. To know that she loved and that she was not loved\nagain had nearly killed her. But such was not her lot. She too had\nbeen successful with her quarry, and had struck her game, and brought\ndown her dear. He had been very violent with her, but his violence\nhad at least made the matter clear. He did love her. She would\nbe satisfied with that, and would endeavour so to live that that\nalone should make life happy for her. How should she get his\nphotograph,--and a lock of his hair?--and when again might she have\nthe pleasure of placing her own hand within his great, rough, violent\ngrasp? Then she kissed the hand which he had held, and opened the\ndoor of her room, at which her sister was now knocking.\n\n\"Nora, dear, will you not come down?\"\n\n\"Not yet, Emily. Very soon I will.\"\n\n\"And what has happened, dearest?\"\n\n\"There is nothing to tell, Emily.\"\n\n\"There must be something to tell. What did he say to you?\"\n\n\"Of course you know what he said.\"\n\n\"And what answer did you make?\"\n\n\"I told him that it could not be.\"\n\n\"And did he take that,--as final, Nora?\"\n\n\"Of course not. What man ever takes a No as final?\"\n\n\"When you said No to Mr. Glascock he took it.\"\n\n\"That was different, Emily.\"\n\n\"But how different? I don't see the difference, except that if you\ncould have brought yourself to like Mr. Glascock, it would have been\nthe greatest thing in the world for you, and for all of them.\"\n\n\"Would you have me take a man, Emily, that I didn't care one straw\nfor, merely because he was a lord? You can't mean that.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about Mr. Glascock now, Nora.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. And what's the use? He is gone, and there's an end of\nit.\"\n\n\"And is Mr. Stanbury gone?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"In the same way?\" asked Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"How can I tell about his ways? No; it is not in the same way. There!\nHe went in a very different way.\"\n\n\"How was it different, Nora?\"\n\n\"Oh, so different. I can't tell you how. Mr. Glascock will never come\nback again.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Stanbury will?\" said the elder sister. Nora made no reply,\nbut after a while nodded her head. \"And you want him to come back?\"\nShe paused again, and again nodded her head. \"Then you have accepted\nhim?\"\n\n\"I have not accepted him. I have refused him. I have told him that it\nwas impossible.\"\n\n\"And yet you wish him back again!\" Nora again nodded her head.\n\"That is a state of things I cannot at all understand,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan, \"and would not believe unless you told me so yourself.\"\n\n\"And you think me very wrong, of course. I will endeavour to do\nnothing wrong, but it is so. I have not said a word of encouragement\nto Mr. Stanbury; but I love him with all my heart. Ought I to tell\nyou a lie when you question me? Or is it natural that I should never\nwish to see again a person whom I love better than all the world? It\nseems to me that a girl can hardly be right if she have any choice of\nher own. Here are two men, one rich and the other poor. I shall fall\nto the ground between them. I know that. I have fallen to the ground\nalready. I like the one I can't marry. I don't care a straw for the\none who could give me a grand house. That is falling to the ground.\nBut I don't see that it is hard to understand, or that I have\ndisgraced myself.\"\n\n\"I said nothing of disgrace, Nora.\"\n\n\"But you looked it.\"\n\n\"I did not intend to look it, dearest.\"\n\n\"And remember this, Emily, I have told you everything because you\nasked me. I do not mean to tell anybody else, at all. Mamma would not\nunderstand me. I have not told him, and I shall not.\"\n\n\"You mean Mr. Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Yes; I mean Mr. Stanbury. As to Mr. Glascock, of course I shall tell\nmamma that. I have no secret there. That is his secret, and I suppose\nmamma should know it. But I will have nothing told about the other.\nHad I accepted him, or even hinted to him that I cared for him, I\nwould tell mamma at once.\"\n\nAfter that there came something of a lecture, or something, rather,\nof admonition, from Mrs. Outhouse. That lady did not attempt to\nupbraid, or to find any fault; but observed that as she understood\nthat Mr. Stanbury had no means whatever, and as Nora herself had\nnone, there had better be no further intercourse between them, till,\nat any rate, Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley should be in London. \"So\nI told him that he must not come here any more, my dear,\" said Mrs.\nOuthouse.\n\n\"You are quite right, aunt. He ought not to come here.\"\n\n\"I am so glad that you agree with me.\"\n\n\"I agree with you altogether. I think I was bound to see him when he\nasked to see me; but the thing is altogether out of the question. I\ndon't think he'll come any more, aunt.\" Then Mrs. Outhouse was quite\nsatisfied that no harm had been done.\n\nA month had now passed since anything had been heard at St.\nDiddulph's from Mr. Trevelyan, and it seemed that many months might\ngo on in the same dull way. When Mrs. Trevelyan first found herself\nin her uncle's house, a sum of two hundred pounds had been sent to\nher; and since that she had received a letter from her husband's\nlawyer saying that a similar amount would be sent to her every three\nmonths, as long as she was separated from her husband. A portion\nof this she had given over to Mr. Outhouse; but this pecuniary\nassistance by no means comforted that unfortunate gentleman in his\ntrouble. \"I don't want to get into debt,\" he said, \"by keeping a lot\nof people whom I haven't the means to feed. And I don't want to board\nand lodge my nieces and their family at so much a head. It's very\nhard upon me either way.\" And so it was. All the comfort of his home\nwas destroyed, and he was driven to sacrifice his independence by\npaying his tradesmen with a portion of Mrs. Trevelyan's money. The\nmore he thought of it all, and the more he discussed the matter with\nhis wife, the more indignant they became with the truant husband. \"I\ncan't believe,\" he said, \"but what Mr. Bideawhile could make him come\nback, if he chose to do his duty.\"\n\n\"But they say that Mr. Trevelyan is in Italy, my dear.\"\n\n\"And if I went to Italy, might I leave you to starve, and take my\nincome with me?\"\n\n\"He doesn't leave her quite to starve, my dear.\"\n\n\"But isn't a man bound to stay with his wife? I never heard of such a\nthing,--never. And I'm sure that there must be something wrong. A man\ncan't go away and leave his wife to live with her uncle and aunt. It\nisn't right.\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\"\n\nMr. Outhouse was forced to acknowledge that nothing could be done. He\nwas a man to whom the quiescence of his own childless house was the\none pleasure of his existence. And of that he was robbed because this\nwicked madman chose to neglect all his duties, and leave his wife\nwithout a house to shelter her. \"Supposing that she couldn't have\ncome here, what then?\" said Mr. Outhouse. \"I did tell him, as plain\nas words could speak, that we couldn't receive them.\" \"But here they\nare,\" said Mrs. Outhouse, \"and here they must remain till my brother\ncomes to England.\" \"It's the most monstrous thing that I ever heard\nof in all my life,\" said Mr. Outhouse. \"He ought to be locked\nup;--that's what he ought.\"\n\nIt was hard, and it became harder, when a gentleman, whom Mr.\nOuthouse certainly did not wish to see, called upon him about the\nlatter end of September. Mr. Outhouse was sitting alone, in the\ngloomy parlour of his parsonage,--for his own study had been given\nup to other things, since this great inroad had been made upon his\nfamily;--he was sitting alone on one Saturday morning, preparing for\nthe duties of the next day, with various manuscript sermons lying on\nthe table around him, when he was told that a gentleman had called\nto see him. Had Mr. Outhouse been an incumbent at the West-end of\nLondon, or had his maid been a West-end servant, in all probability\nthe gentleman's name would have been demanded; but Mr. Outhouse was a\nman who was not very ready in foreseeing and preventing misfortunes,\nand the girl who opened the door was not trained to discreet\nusages in such matters. As she announced the fact that there was a\ngentleman, she pointed to the door, to show that the gentleman was\nthere; and before Mr. Outhouse had been able to think whether it\nwould be prudent for him to make some preliminary inquiry, Colonel\nOsborne was in the room. Now, as it happened, these two men had never\nhitherto met each other, though one was the brother-in-law of Sir\nMarmaduke Rowley, and the other had been his very old friend. \"My\nname, Mr. Outhouse, is Colonel Osborne,\" said the visitor, coming\nforward, with his hand out. The clergyman, of course, took his hand,\nand asked him to be seated. \"We have known each other's names very\nlong,\" continued the Colonel, \"though I do not think we have ever yet\nhad an opportunity of becoming acquainted.\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: At St. Diddulph's.]\n\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Outhouse; \"we have never been acquainted, I believe.\"\nHe might have added, that he had no desire whatever to make such\nacquaintance; and his manner, over which he himself had no control,\ndid almost say as much. Indeed, this coming to his house of the\nsuspected lover of his niece appeared to him to be a heavy addition\nto his troubles; for, although he was disposed to take his niece's\npart against her husband to any possible length,--even to the locking\nup of the husband as a madman, if it were possible,--nevertheless, he\nhad almost as great a horror of the Colonel, as though the husband's\nallegation as to the lover had been true as gospel. Because Trevelyan\nhad been wrong altogether, Colonel Osborne was not the less wrong.\nBecause Trevelyan's suspicions were to Mr. Outhouse wicked and\ngroundless, he did not the less regard the presumed lover to be an\niniquitous roaring lion, going about seeking whom he might devour.\nElderly unmarried men of fashion generally, and especially colonels,\nand majors, and members of parliament, and such like, were to him\nas black sheep or roaring lions. They were \"fruges consumere nati;\"\nmen who stood on club doorsteps talking naughtily and doing nothing,\nwearing sleek clothing, for which they very often did not pay, and\nnever going to church. It seemed to him,--in his ignorance,--that\nsuch men had none of the burdens of this world upon their shoulders,\nand that, therefore, they stood in great peril of the burdens of the\nnext. It was, doubtless, his special duty to deal with men in such\nperil;--but those wicked ones with whom he was concerned were those\nwhom he could reach. Now, the Colonel Osbornes of the earth were\nnot to be got at by any clergyman, or, as far as Mr. Outhouse could\nsee, by any means of grace. That story of the rich man and the camel\nseemed to him to be specially applicable to such people. How was such\na one as Colonel Osborne to be shewn the way through the eye of a\nneedle? To Mr. Outhouse, his own brother-in-law, Sir Marmaduke, was\nalmost of the same class,--for he frequented clubs when in London,\nand played whist, and talked of the things of the world,--such as the\nDerby, and the lev\u00c3\u00a9es, and West-end dinner parties,--as though they\nwere all in all to him. He, to be sure, was weighted with so large\na family that there might be hope for him. The eye of the needle\ncould not be closed against him as a rich man; but he savoured of\nthe West-end, and was worldly, and consorted with such men as this\nColonel Osborne. When Colonel Osborne introduced himself to Mr.\nOuthouse, it was almost as though Apollyon had made his way into the\nparsonage of St. Diddulph's.\n\n\"Mr. Outhouse,\" said the Colonel, \"I have thought it best to come\nto you the very moment that I got back to town from Scotland.\" Mr.\nOuthouse bowed, and was bethinking himself slowly what manner of\nspeech he would adopt. \"I leave town again to-morrow for Dorsetshire.\nI am going down to my friends, the Brambers, for partridge shooting.\"\nMr. Outhouse knitted his thick brows, in further inward condemnation.\nPartridge shooting! yes;--this was September, and partridge shooting\nwould be the probable care and occupation of such a man at such a\ntime. A man without a duty in the world! Perhaps, added to this there\nwas a feeling that, whereas Colonel Osborne could shoot Scotch grouse\nin August, and Dorsetshire partridges in September, and go about\nthroughout the whole year like a roaring lion, he, Mr. Outhouse,\nwas forced to remain at St. Diddulph's-in-the-East, from January to\nDecember, with the exception of one small parson's week spent at\nMargate, for the benefit of his wife's health. If there was such a\nthought, or rather, such a feeling, who will say that it was not\nnatural? \"But I could not go through London without seeing you,\"\ncontinued the Colonel. \"This is a most frightful infatuation of\nTrevelyan!\"\n\n\"Very frightful, indeed,\" said Mr. Outhouse.\n\n\"And, on my honour as a gentleman, not the slightest cause in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"You are old enough to be the lady's father,\" said Mr. Outhouse,\nmanaging in that to get one blow at the gallant Colonel.\n\n\"Just so. God bless my soul!\" Mr. Outhouse shrunk visibly at this\nprofane allusion to the Colonel's soul. \"Why, I've known her father\never so many years. As you say, I might almost be her father myself.\"\nAs far as age went, such certainly might have been the case, for the\nColonel was older than Sir Marmaduke. \"Look here, Mr. Outhouse, here\nis a letter I got from Emily--\"\n\n\"From Mrs. Trevelyan?\"\n\n\"Yes, from Mrs. Trevelyan; and as well as I can understand, it must\nhave been sent to me by Trevelyan himself. Did you ever hear of such\na thing? And now I'm told he has gone away, nobody knows where, and\nhas left her here.\"\n\n\"He has gone away,--nobody knows where.\"\n\n\"Of course, I don't ask to see her.\"\n\n\"It would be imprudent, Colonel Osborne; and could not be permitted\nin this house.\"\n\n\"I don't ask it. I have known Emily Trevelyan since she was an\ninfant, and have always loved her. I'm her godfather, for aught I\nknow,--though one forgets things of that sort.\" Mr. Outhouse again\nknit his eyebrows and shuddered visibly. \"She and I have been fast\nfriends,--and why not? But, of course, I can't interfere.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, Colonel Osborne, I should say that you can do nothing\nin the matter;--except to remain away from her. When Sir Marmaduke is\nin England, you can see him, if you please.\"\n\n\"See him;--of course, I shall see him. And, by George, Louis\nTrevelyan will have to see him, too! I shouldn't like to have to\nstand up before Rowley if I had treated a daughter of his in such a\nfashion. You know Rowley, of course?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I know him.\"\n\n\"He's not the sort of man to bear this sort of thing. He'll about\ntear Trevelyan in pieces if he gets hold of him. God bless my soul--\"\nthe eyebrows went to work again,--\"I never heard of such a thing in\nall my life! Does he pay anything for them, Mr. Outhouse?\"\n\nThis was dreadful to the poor clergyman. \"That is a subject which\nwe surely need not discuss,\" said he. Then he remembered that\nsuch speech on his part was like to a subterfuge, and he found it\nnecessary to put himself right. \"I am repaid for the maintenance here\nof my nieces, and the little boy, and their attendants. I do not know\nwhy the question should be asked, but such is the fact.\"\n\n\"Then they are here by agreement between you and him?\"\n\n\"No, sir; they are not. There is no such agreement. But I do not like\nthese interrogatives from a stranger as to matters which should be\nprivate.\"\n\n\"You cannot wonder at my interest, Mr. Outhouse.\"\n\n\"You had better restrain it, sir, till Sir Marmaduke arrives. I shall\nthen wash my hands of the affair.\"\n\n\"And she is pretty well;--Emily, I mean?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Trevelyan's health is good.\"\n\n\"Pray tell her though I could not--might not ask to see her, I came\nto inquire after her the first moment that I was in London. Pray\ntell her how much I feel for her;--but she will know that. When Sir\nMarmaduke is here, of course, we shall meet. When she is once more\nunder her father's wing, she need not be restrained by any absurd\ncommands from a husband who has deserted her. At present, of course,\nI do not ask to see her.\"\n\n\"Of course, you do not, Colonel Osborne.\"\n\n\"And give my love to Nora;--dear little Nora! There can be no reason\nwhy she and I should not shake hands.\"\n\n\"I should prefer that it should not be so in this house,\" said the\nclergyman, who was now standing,--in expectation that his unwelcome\nguest would go.\n\n\"Very well;--so be it. But you will understand I could not be in\nLondon without coming and asking after them.\" Then the Colonel at\nlast took his leave, and Mr. Outhouse was left to his solitude and\nhis sermons.\n\nMrs. Outhouse was very angry when she heard of the visit. \"Men of\nthat sort,\" she said, \"think it a fine thing, and talk about it. I\nbelieve the poor girl is as innocent as I am, but he isn't innocent.\nHe likes it.\"\n\n\"'It is easier,'\" said Mr. Outhouse solemnly, \"'for a camel to go\nthrough the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom\nof God.'\"\n\n\"I don't know that he is a rich man,\" said Mrs. Outhouse; \"but he\nwouldn't have come here if he had been honest.\"\n\nMrs. Trevelyan was told of the visit, and simply said that of course\nit was out of the question that she should have seen Colonel Osborne.\nNevertheless she seemed to think it quite natural that he should have\ncalled, and defended him with some energy when her aunt declared that\nhe had been much to blame. \"He is not bound to obey Mr. Trevelyan\nbecause I am,\" said Emily.\n\n\"He is bound to abstain from evil doing,\" said Mrs. Outhouse; \"and he\noughtn't to have come. There; let that be enough, my dear. Your uncle\ndoesn't wish to have it talked about.\" Nevertheless it was talked\nabout between the two sisters. Nora was of opinion that Colonel\nOsborne had been wrong, whereas Emily defended him. \"It seems to me\nto have been the most natural thing in life,\" said she.\n\nHad Colonel Osborne made the visit as Sir Marmaduke's friend, feeling\nhimself to be an old man, it might have been natural. When a man has\ncome to regard himself as being, on the score of age, about as fit to\nbe a young lady's lover as though he were an old woman instead of an\nold man,--which some men will do when they are younger even than was\nColonel Osborne,--he is justified in throwing behind him as utterly\nabsurd the suspicions of other people. But Colonel Osborne cannot be\ndefended altogether on that plea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nMISS STANBURY AND MR. GIBSON BECOME TWO.\n\n\nThere came to be a very gloomy fortnight at Miss Stanbury's house\nin the Close. For two or three days after Mr. Gibson's dismissal at\nthe hands of Miss Stanbury herself, Brooke Burgess was still in the\nhouse, and his presence saved Dorothy from the full weight of her\naunt's displeasure. There was the necessity of looking after Brooke,\nand scolding him, and of praising him to Martha, and of dispraising\nhim, and of seeing that he had enough to eat, and of watching whether\nhe smoked in the house, and of quarrelling with him about everything\nunder the sun, which together so employed Miss Stanbury that she\nsatisfied herself with glances at Dorothy which were felt to be full\nof charges of ingratitude. Dorothy was thankful that it should be so,\nand bore the glances with abject submission. And then there was a\ngreat comfort to her in Brooke's friendship. On the second day after\nMr. Gibson had gone she found herself talking to Brooke quite openly\nupon the subject. \"The fact was, Mr. Burgess, that I didn't really\ncare for him. I know he's very good and all that, and of course Aunt\nStanbury meant it all for the best. And I would have done it if I\ncould, but I couldn't.\" Brooke patted her on the back,--not in the\nflesh but in the spirit,--and told her that she was quite right. And\nhe expressed an opinion too that it was not expedient to yield too\nmuch to Aunt Stanbury. \"I would yield to her in anything that was\npossible to me,\" said Dorothy. \"I won't,\" said he; \"and I don't think\nI should do any good if I did. I like her, and I like her money. But\nI don't like either well enough to sell myself for a price.\"\n\nA great part too of the quarrelling which went on from day to day\nbetween Brooke and Miss Stanbury was due to the difference of their\nopinions respecting Dorothy and her suitor. \"I believe you put her up\nto it,\" said Aunt Stanbury.\n\n\"I neither put her up nor down, but I think that she was quite\nright.\"\n\n\"You've robbed her of a husband, and she'll never have another\nchance. After what you've done, you ought to take her yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready to-morrow,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"How can you tell such a lie?\" said Aunt Stanbury.\n\nBut after two or three days Brooke was gone to make a journey through\nthe distant part of the county, and see the beauties of Devonshire.\nHe was to be away for a fortnight, and then come back for a day or\ntwo before he returned to London. During that fortnight things did\nnot go well with poor Dorothy at Exeter.\n\n\"I suppose you know your own business best,\" her aunt said to her\none morning. Dorothy uttered no word of reply. She felt it to be\nequally impossible to suggest either that she did or that she did\nnot know her own business best. \"There may be reasons which I don't\nunderstand,\" exclaimed Aunt Stanbury; \"but I should like to know what\nit is you expect.\"\n\n\"Why should I expect anything, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"That's nonsense. Everybody expects something. You expect to have\nyour dinner by-and-by,--don't you?\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall,\" said Dorothy, to whom it occurred at the moment\nthat such expectation was justified by the fact that on every day of\nher life hitherto some sort of a dinner had come in her way.\n\n\"Yes,--and you think it comes from heaven, I suppose.\"\n\n\"It comes by God's goodness and your bounty, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"And how will it come when I'm dead? Or how will it come if things\nshould go in such a way that I can't stay here any longer? You don't\never think of that.\"\n\n\"I should go back to mamma, and Priscilla.\"\n\n\"Psha! As if two mouths were not enough to eat all the meal there is\nin that tub. If there was a word to say against the man, I wouldn't\nask you to have him; if he drank, or smoked, or wasn't a gentleman,\nor was too poor, or anything you like. But there's nothing. It's all\nvery well to tell me you don't love him, but why don't you love him?\nI don't like a girl to go and throw herself at a man's head, as those\nFrenches have done; but when everything has been prepared for you\nand made proper, it seems to me to be like turning away from good\nvictuals.\" Dorothy could only offer to go home if she had offended\nher aunt, and then Miss Stanbury scolded her for making the offer. As\nthis kind of thing went on at the house in the Close for a fortnight,\nduring which there was no going out, and no society at home, Dorothy\nbegan to be rather tired of it.\n\nAt the end of the fortnight, on the morning of the day on which\nBrooke Burgess was expected back, Dorothy, slowly moving into the\nsitting room with her usual melancholy air, found Mr. Gibson talking\nto her aunt. \"There she is herself,\" said Miss Stanbury, jumping\nup briskly, \"and now you can speak to her. Of course I have no\nauthority,--none in the least. But she knows what my wishes are.\"\nAnd, having so spoken, Miss Stanbury left the room.\n\nIt will be remembered that hitherto no word of affection had been\nwhispered by Mr. Gibson into Dorothy's ears. When he came before to\npress his suit, she had been made aware of his coming, and had fled,\nleaving her answer with her aunt. Mr. Gibson had then expressed\nhimself as somewhat injured, in that no opportunity of pouring forth\nhis own eloquence had been permitted to him. On that occasion Miss\nStanbury, being in a snubbing humour, had snubbed him. She had in\ntruth scolded him almost as much as she had scolded Dorothy, telling\nhim that he went about the business in hand as though butter wouldn't\nmelt in his mouth. \"You're stiff as a chair-back,\" she had said to\nhim, with a few other compliments, and these amenities had for a\nwhile made him regard the establishment at Heavitree as being, at\nany rate, pleasanter than that in the Close. But since that cool\nreflection had come. The proposal was not that he should marry Miss\nStanbury, senior, who certainly could be severe on occasions, but\nMiss Stanbury, junior, whose temper was as sweet as primroses in\nMarch. That which he would have to take from Miss Stanbury, senior,\nwas a certain sum of money, as to which her promise was as good as\nany bond in the world. Things had come to such a pass with him in\nExeter,--from the hints of his friend the Prebend, from a word or two\nwhich had come to him from the Dean, from certain family arrangements\nproposed to him by his mother and sisters,--things had come to such\na pass that he was of a mind that he had better marry some one. He\nhad, as it were, three strings to his bow. There were the two French\nstrings, and there was Dorothy. He had not breadth of genius enough\nto suggest to himself that yet another woman might be found. There\nwas a difficulty on the French score even about Miss Stanbury; but\nit was clear to him that, failing her, he was due to one of the\ntwo Miss Frenches. Now it was not only that the Miss Frenches were\nempty-handed, but he was beginning to think himself that they were\nnot as nice as they might have been in reference to the arrangement\nof their head-gear. Therefore, having given much thought to the\nmatter, and remembering that he had never yet had play for his own\neloquence with Dorothy, he had come to Miss Stanbury asking that he\nmight have another chance. It had been borne in upon him that he had\nperhaps hitherto regarded Dorothy as too certainly his own since she\nhad been offered to him by her aunt,--as being a prize that required\nno eloquence in the winning; and he thought that if he could have an\nopportunity of amending that fault, it might even yet be well with\nhis suit. So he prepared himself, and asked permission, and now found\nhimself alone with the young lady.\n\n\"When last I was in this house, Miss Stanbury,\" he began, \"I was not\nfortunate enough to be allowed an opportunity of pleading my cause to\nyourself.\" Then he paused, and Dorothy was left to consider how best\nshe might answer him. All that her aunt had said to her had not been\nthrown away upon her. The calls upon that slender meal-tub at home\nshe knew were quite sufficient. And Mr. Gibson was, she believed, a\ngood man. And how better could she dispose of herself in life? And\nwhat was she that she should scorn the love of an honest gentleman?\nShe would take him, she thought,--if she could. But then there came\nupon her, unconsciously, without work of thought, by instinct rather\nthan by intelligence, a feeling of the closeness of a wife to her\nhusband. Looking at it in general she could not deny that it would\nbe very proper that she should become Mrs. Gibson. But when there\ncame upon her a remembrance that she would be called upon for\ndemonstration of her love,--that he would embrace her, and hold her\nto his heart, and kiss her,--she revolted and shuddered. She believed\nthat she did not want to marry any man, and that such a state of\nthings would not be good for her. \"Dear young lady,\" continued Mr.\nGibson, \"you will let me now make up for the loss which I then\nexperienced?\"\n\n\"I thought it was better not to give you trouble,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Trouble, Miss Stanbury! How could it be trouble? The labour we\ndelight in physics pain. But to go back to the subject-matter. I hope\nyou do not doubt that my affection for you is true and honest, and\ngenuine.\"\n\n\"I don't want to doubt anything, Mr. Gibson; but--\"\n\n\"You needn't, dearest Miss Stanbury; indeed you needn't. If you\ncould read my heart you would see written there true love very\nplainly;--very plainly. And do you not think it a duty that people\nshould marry?\" It may be surmised that he had here forgotten some\nconnecting link which should have joined without abruptness the\ndeclaration of his own love, and his social view as to the general\nexpediency of matrimony. But Dorothy did not discover the hiatus.\n\n\"Certainly,--when they like each other, and if their friends think it\nproper.\"\n\n\"Our friends think it proper, Miss Stanbury,--may I say Dorothy?--all\nof them. I can assure you that on my side you will be welcomed by a\nmother and sisters only too anxious to receive you with open arms.\nAnd as regards your own relations, I need hardly allude to your\nrevered aunt. As to your own mother and sister,--and your brother,\nwho, I believe, gives his mind chiefly to other things,--I am assured\nby Miss Stanbury that no opposition need be feared from them. Is that\ntrue, dearest Dorothy?\"\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\n\"Does not all that plead in my behalf? Tell me, Dorothy.\"\n\n\"Of course it does.\"\n\n\"And you will be mine?\" As far as eloquence could be of service, Mr.\nGibson was sufficiently eloquent. To Dorothy his words appeared good,\nand true, and affecting. All their friends did wish it. There were\nmany reasons why it should be done. If talking could have done it,\nhis talking was good enough. Though his words were in truth cold,\nand affected, and learned by rote, they did not offend her; but his\nface offended her; and the feeling was strong within her that if she\nyielded, it would soon be close to her own. She couldn't do it. She\ndidn't love him, and she wouldn't do it. Priscilla would not grudge\nher her share out of that meagre meal-tub. Had not Priscilla told her\nnot to marry the man if she did not love him? She found that she was\nfurther than ever from loving him. She would not do it. \"Say that you\nwill be mine,\" pleaded Mr. Gibson, coming to her with both his hands\noutstretched.\n\n\"Mr. Gibson, I can't,\" she said. She was sobbing now, and was half\nchoked by tears.\n\n\"And why not, Dorothy?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I can't. I don't feel that I want to be married at\nall.\"\n\n\"But it is honourable.\"\n\n\"It's no use, Mr. Gibson; I can't, and you oughtn't to ask me any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Must this be your very last answer?\"\n\n\"What's the good of going over it all again and again? I can't do\nit.\"\n\n\"Never, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"No;--never.\"\n\n\"That is cruel, very cruel. I fear that you doubt my love.\"\n\n\"It isn't cruel, Mr. Gibson. I have a right to have my own feelings,\nand I can't. If you please, I'll go away now.\" Then she went, and\nhe was left standing alone in the room. His first feeling was one\nof anger. Then there came to be mixed with that a good deal of\nwonder,--and then a certain amount of doubt. He had during the last\nfortnight discussed the matter at great length with a friend, a\ngentleman who knew the world, and who took upon himself to say that\nhe specially understood female nature. It was by advice from this\nfriend that he had been instigated to plead his own cause. \"Of course\nshe means to accept you,\" the friend had said. \"Why the mischief\nshouldn't she? But she has some flimsy, old-fashioned country idea\nthat it isn't maidenly to give in at first. You tell her roundly that\nshe must marry you.\" Mr. Gibson was just reaching that roundness\nwhich his friend had recommended when the lady left him and he was\nalone.\n\nMr. Gibson was no doubt very much in love with Dorothy Stanbury. So\nmuch, we may take for granted. He, at least, believed that he was in\nlove with her. He would have thought it wicked to propose to her had\nhe not been in love with her. But with his love was mingled a certain\namount of contempt which had induced him to look upon her as an easy\nconquest. He had been perhaps a little ashamed of himself for being\nin love with Dorothy, and had almost believed the Frenches when they\nhad spoken of her as a poor creature, a dependant, one born to be\nsnubbed,--as a young woman almost without an identity of her own.\nWhen, therefore, she so pertinaciously refused him, he could not but\nbe angry. And it was natural that he should be surprised. Though he\nwas to have received a fortune with Dorothy, the money was not hers.\nIt was to be hers,--or rather theirs,--only if she would accept him.\nMr. Gibson thoroughly understood this point. He knew that Dorothy had\nnothing of her own. The proposal made to her was as rich as though\nhe had sought her down at Nuncombe Putney, with his preferment, plus\nthe \u00c2\u00a32,000, in his own pocket. And his other advantages were not\nhidden from his own eyes. He was a clergyman, well thought of, not\nbad-looking certainly, considerably under forty,--a man, indeed, who\nought to have been, in the eyes of Dorothy, such an Orlando as she\nwould have most desired. He could not therefore but wonder. And then\ncame the doubt. Could it be possible that all those refusals were\nsimply the early pulses of hesitating compliance produced by maidenly\nreserve? Mr. Gibson's friend had expressed a strong opinion that\nalmost any young woman would accept any young man if he put his\n\"com 'ether\" upon her strong enough. For Mr. Gibson's friend was an\nIrishman. As to Dorothy the friend had not a doubt in the world. Mr.\nGibson, as he stood alone in the room after Dorothy's departure,\ncould not share his friend's certainty; but he thought it just\npossible that the pulsations of maidenly reserve were yet at work. As\nhe was revolving these points in his mind, Miss Stanbury entered the\nroom.\n\n\"It's all over now,\" she said.\n\n\"As how, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"As how! She's given you an answer; hasn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Stanbury, she has given me an answer. But it has occurred\nto me that young ladies are sometimes,--perhaps a little--\"\n\n\"She means it, Mr. Gibson; you may take my word for that. She is\nquite in earnest. She can take the bit between her teeth as well as\nanother, though she does look so mild and gentle. She's a Stanbury\nall over.\"\n\n\"And must this be the last of it, Miss Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't know what else you can do,--unless you send\nthe Dean and Chapter to talk her over. She's a pig-headed, foolish\nyoung woman;--but I can't help that. The truth is, you didn't make\nenough of her at first, Mr. Gibson. You thought the plum would tumble\ninto your mouth.\"\n\nThis did seem cruel to the poor man. From the first day in which\nthe project had been opened to him by Miss Stanbury, he had yielded\na ready acquiescence,--in spite of those ties which he had at\nHeavitree,--and had done his very best to fall into her views. \"I\ndon't think that is at all fair, Miss Stanbury,\" he said, with some\ntone of wrath in his voice.\n\n\"It's true,--quite true. You always treated her as though she were\nsomething beneath you.\" Mr. Gibson stood speechless, with his mouth\nopen. \"So you did. I saw it all. And now she's had spirit enough to\nresent it. I don't wonder at it; I don't, indeed. It's no good your\nstanding there any longer. The thing is done.\"\n\nSuch intolerable ill-usage Mr. Gibson had never suffered in his life.\nHad he been untrue, or very nearly untrue, to those dear girls at\nHeavitree for this? \"I never treated her as anything beneath me,\" he\nsaid at last.\n\n\"Yes, you did. Do you think that I don't understand? Haven't I eyes\nin my head, and ears? I'm not deaf yet, nor blind. But there's an\nend of it. If any young woman ever meant anything, she means it. The\ntruth is, she don't like you.\"\n\nWas ever a lover despatched in so uncourteous a way! Then, too, he\nhad been summoned thither as a lover, had been specially encouraged\nto come there as a lover, had been assured of success in a peculiar\nway, had had the plum actually offered to him! He had done all that\nthis old woman had bidden him,--something, indeed, to the prejudice\nof his own heart; he had been told that the wife was ready for\nhim; and now, because this foolish young woman didn't know her own\nmind,--this was Mr. Gibson's view of the matter,--he was reviled\nand abused, and told that he had behaved badly to the lady. \"Miss\nStanbury,\" he said, \"I think that you are forgetting yourself.\"\n\n\"Highty, tighty!\" said Miss Stanbury. \"Forgetting myself! I shan't\nforget you in a hurry, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"Nor I you, Miss Stanbury. Good morning, Miss Stanbury.\" Mr. Gibson,\nas he went from the hall-door into the street, shook the dust off his\nfeet, and resolved that for the future he and Miss Stanbury should be\ntwo. There would arise great trouble in Exeter, but, nevertheless, he\nand Miss Stanbury must be two. He could justify himself in no other\npurpose after such conduct as he had received.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nLABURNUM COTTAGE.\n\n\nThere had been various letters passing, during the last six weeks,\nbetween Priscilla Stanbury and her brother, respecting the Clock\nHouse at Nuncombe Putney. The ladies at Nuncombe had, certainly, gone\ninto the Clock House on the clear understanding that the expenses of\nthe establishment were to be incurred on behalf of Mrs. Trevelyan.\nPriscilla had assented to the movement most doubtingly. She had\ndisliked the idea of taking the charge of a young married woman who\nwas separated from her husband, and she had felt that a going down\nafter such an uprising,--a fall from the Clock House back to a\ncottage,--would be very disagreeable. She had, however, allowed her\nbrother's arguments to prevail, and there they were. The annoyance\nwhich she had anticipated from the position of their late guest had\nfallen upon them: it had been felt grievously, from the moment in\nwhich Colonel Osborne called at the house; and now that going back\nto the cottage must be endured. Priscilla understood that there had\nbeen a settlement between Trevelyan and Stanbury as to the cost of\nthe establishment so far;--but that must now be at an end. In their\npresent circumstances she would not continue to live there, and had\nalready made inquiries as to some humble roof for their shelter. For\nherself she would not have cared had it been necessary for her to\nhide herself in a hut,--for herself, as regarded any feeling as to\nher own standing in the village. For herself, she was ashamed of\nnothing. But her mother would suffer, and she knew what Aunt Stanbury\nwould say to Dorothy. To Dorothy at the present moment, if Dorothy\nshould think of accepting her suitor, the change might be very\ndeleterious; but still it should be made. She could not endure\nto live there on the very hard-earned proceeds of her brother's\npen,--proceeds which were not only hard-earned, but precarious. She\ngave warning to the two servants who had been hired, and consulted\nwith Mrs. Crocket as to a cottage, and was careful to let it be known\nthroughout Nuncombe Putney that the Clock House was to be abandoned.\nThe Clock House had been taken furnished for six months, of which\nhalf were not yet over; but there were other expenses of living there\nmuch greater than the rent, and go she would. Her mother sighed and\nassented; and Mrs. Crocket, having strongly but fruitlessly advised\nthat the Clock House should be inhabited at any rate for the six\nmonths, promised her assistance. \"It has been a bad business, Mrs.\nCrocket,\" said Priscilla; \"and all we can do now is to get out of\nit as well as we can. Every mouthful I eat chokes me while I stay\nthere.\" \"It ain't good, certainly, miss, not to know as you're all\nstraight the first thing as you wakes in the morning,\" said Mrs.\nCrocket,--who was always able to feel when she woke that everything\nwas straight with her.\n\nThen there came the correspondence between Priscilla and Hugh.\nPriscilla was at first decided, indeed, but mild in the expression\nof her decision. To this, and to one or two other missives\ncouched in terms of increasing decision, Hugh answered with manly,\nself-asserting, overbearing arguments. The house was theirs till\nChristmas; between this and then he would think about it. He could\nvery well afford to keep the house on till next Midsummer, and then\nthey might see what had best be done. There was plenty of money, and\nPriscilla need not put herself into a flutter. In answer to that word\nflutter, Priscilla wrote as follows:--\n\n\n   Clock House, September 16, 186--.\n\n   DEAR HUGH,\n\n   I know very well how good you are, and how generous, but\n   you must allow me to have feelings as well as yourself. I\n   will not consent to have myself regarded as a grand lady\n   out of your earnings. How should I feel when some day I\n   heard that you had run yourself into debt? Neither mamma\n   nor I could endure it. Dorothy is provided for now, at any\n   rate for a time, and what we have is enough for us. You\n   know I am not too proud to take anything you can spare to\n   us, when we are ourselves placed in a proper position: but\n   I could not live in this great house, while you are paying\n   for everything,--and I will not. Mamma quite agrees with\n   me, and we shall go out of it on Michaelmas-day. Mrs.\n   Crocket says she thinks she can get you a tenant for the\n   three months, out of Exeter,--if not for the whole rent,\n   at least for part of it. I think we have already got a\n   small place for eight shillings a week, a little out of\n   the village, on the road to Cockchaffington. You will\n   remember it. Old Soames used to live there. Our old\n   furniture will be just enough. There is a mite of a\n   garden, and Mrs. Crocket says she thinks we can get it for\n   seven shillings, or perhaps for six and sixpence, if we\n   stay there. We shall go in on the 29th. Mrs. Crocket will\n   see about having somebody to take care of the house.\n\n   Your most affectionate sister,\n\n   PRISCILLA.\n\n\nOn the receipt of this letter, Hugh proceeded to Nuncombe. At this\ntime he was making about ten guineas a week, and thought that\nhe saw his way to further work. No doubt the ten guineas were\nprecarious;--that is, the \"Daily Record\" might discontinue his\nservices to-morrow, if the \"Daily Record\" thought fit to do so. The\ngreater part of his earnings came from the \"D. R.,\" and the editor\nhad only to say that things did not suit any longer, and there would\nbe an end of it. He was not as a lawyer or a doctor with many clients\nwho could not all be supposed to withdraw their custom at once; but\nleading articles were things wanted with at least as much regularity\nas physic or law, and Hugh Stanbury, believing in himself, did not\nthink it probable that an editor, who knew what he was about, would\nwithdraw his patronage. He was proud of his weekly ten guineas,\nfeeling sure that a weekly ten guineas would not as yet have been\nhis had he stuck to the Bar as a profession. He had calculated, when\nMrs. Trevelyan left the Clock House, that two hundred a year would\nenable his mother to continue to reside there, the rent of the place\nfurnished, or half-furnished, being only eighty; and he thought\nthat he could pay the two hundred easily. He thought so still, when\nhe received Priscilla's last letter; but he knew something of the\nstubbornness of his dear sister, and he, therefore, went down to\nNuncombe Putney, in order that he might use the violence of his logic\non his mother.\n\nHe had heard of Mr. Gibson from both Priscilla and from Dorothy,\nand was certainly desirous that \"dear old Dolly,\" as he called her,\nshould be settled comfortably. But when dear old Dolly wrote to him\ndeclaring that it could not be so, that Mr. Gibson was a very nice\ngentleman, of whom she could not say that she was particularly\nfond,--\"though I really do think that he is an excellent man, and if\nit was any other girl in the world, I should recommend her to take\nhim,\"--and that she thought that she would rather not get married, he\nwrote to her the kindest brotherly letter in the world, telling her\nthat she was \"a brick,\" and suggesting to her that there might come\nsome day some one who would suit her taste better than Mr. Gibson.\n\"I'm not very fond of parsons myself,\" said Hugh, \"but you must not\ntell that to Aunt Stanbury.\" Then he suggested that as he was going\ndown to Nuncombe, Dorothy should get leave of absence and come over\nand meet him at the Clock House. Dorothy demanded the leave of\nabsence somewhat imperiously, and was at home at the Clock House when\nHugh arrived.\n\n\"And so that little affair couldn't come off?\" said Hugh at their\nfirst family meeting.\n\n\"It was a pity,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, plaintively. She had been very\nplaintive on the subject. What a thing it would have been for her,\ncould she have seen Dorothy so well established!\n\n\"There's no help for spilt milk, mother,\" said Hugh. Mrs. Stanbury\nshook her head.\n\n\"Dorothy was quite right,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"Of course she was right,\" said Hugh. \"Who doubts her being right?\nBless my soul! What's any girl to do if she don't like a man except\nto tell him so? I honour you, Dolly,--not that I ever should have\ndoubted you. You're too much of a chip of the old block to say you\nliked a man when you didn't.\"\n\n\"He is a very excellent young man,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"An excellent fiddlestick, mother. Loving and liking don't go by\nexcellence. Besides, I don't know about his being any better than\nanybody else, just because he's a clergyman.\"\n\n\"A clergyman is more likely to be steady than other men,\" said the\nmother.\n\n\"Steady, yes; and as selfish as you please.\"\n\n\"Your father was a clergyman, Hugh.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to say that they are not as good as others; but I won't\nhave it that they are better. They are always dealing with the Bible,\ntill they think themselves apostles. But when money comes up, or\ncomfort, or, for the matter of that either, a pretty woman with a\nlittle money, then they are as human as the rest of us.\"\n\nIf the truth had been told on that occasion, Hugh Stanbury would have\nhad to own that he had written lately two or three rather stinging\narticles in the \"Daily Record,\" as \"to the assumed merits and actual\ndemerits of the clergy of the Church of England.\" It is astonishing\nhow fluent a man is on a subject when he has lately delivered himself\nrespecting it in this fashion.\n\nNothing on that evening was said about the Clock House, or about\nPriscilla's intentions. Priscilla was up early on the next morning,\nintending to discuss it in the garden with Hugh before breakfast; but\nHugh was aware of her purpose and avoided her. It was his intention\nto speak first to his mother; and though his mother was, as he knew,\nvery much in awe of her daughter, he thought that he might carry his\npoint, at any rate for the next three months, by forcing an assent\nfrom the elder lady. So he managed to waylay Mrs. Stanbury before she\ndescended to the parlour.\n\n\"We can't afford it, my dear;--indeed we can't,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"That's not the question, mother. The rent must be paid up to\nChristmas, and you can live here as cheap as you can anywhere.\"\n\n\"But Priscilla--\"\n\n\"Oh, Priscilla! Of course we know what Priscilla says. Priscilla has\nbeen writing to me about it in the most sensible manner in the world;\nbut what does it all come to? If you are ashamed of taking assistance\nfrom me, I don't know who is to do anything for anybody. You are\ncomfortable here?\"\n\n\"Very comfortable; only Priscilla feels--\"\n\n\"Priscilla is a tyrant, mother; and a very stern one. Just make up\nyour mind to stay here till Christmas. If I tell you that I can\nafford it, surely that ought to be enough.\" Then Dorothy entered the\nroom, and Hugh appealed to her. Dorothy had come to Nuncombe only on\nthe day before, and had not been consulted on the subject. She had\nbeen told that the Clock House was to be abandoned, and had been\ntaken down to inspect the cottage in which old Soames had lived;--but\nher opinion had not been asked. Priscilla had quite made up her mind,\nand why should she ask an opinion of any one? But now Dorothy's\nopinion was demanded. \"It's what I call the rhodomontade of\nindependence,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"I suppose it is very expensive,\" suggested Dorothy.\n\n\"The house must be paid for,\" said Hugh;--\"and if I say that I've got\nthe money, is not that enough? A miserable, dirty little place, where\nyou'll catch your death of lumbago, mother.\"\n\n\"Of course it's not a comfortable house,\" said Mrs. Stanbury,--who,\nof herself, was not at all indifferent to the comforts of her present\nresidence.\n\n\"And it is very dirty,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"The nastiest place I ever saw in my life. Come, mother; if I say\nthat I can afford it, ought not that to be enough for you? If you\nthink you can't trust me, there's an end of everything, you know.\"\nAnd Hugh, as he thus expressed himself, assumed an air of injured\nvirtue.\n\nMrs. Stanbury had very nearly yielded, when Priscilla came in among\nthem. It was impossible not to continue the conversation, though Hugh\nwould much have preferred to have forced an assent from his mother\nbefore he opened his mouth on the subject to his sister. \"My mother\nagrees with me,\" said he abruptly, \"and so does Dolly, that it will\nbe absurd to move away from this house at present.\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" exclaimed Priscilla.\n\n\"I don't think I said that, Hugh,\" murmured Dorothy, softly.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't want anything for myself,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"It's I that want it,\" said Hugh. \"And I think that I've a right to\nhave my wishes respected, so far as that goes.\"\n\n\"My dear Hugh,\" said Priscilla, \"the cottage is already taken, and we\nshall certainly go into it. I spoke to Mrs. Crocket yesterday about\na cart for moving the things. I'm sure mamma agrees with me. What\npossible business can people have to live in such a house as this\nwith about twenty-four shillings a week for everything? I won't do\nit. And as the thing is settled, it is only making trouble to disturb\nit.\"\n\n\"I suppose, Priscilla,\" said Hugh, \"you'll do as your mother\nchooses?\"\n\n\"Mamma chooses to go. She has told me so already.\"\n\n\"You have talked her into it.\"\n\n\"We had better go, Hugh,\" said Mrs. Stanbury. \"I'm sure we had better\ngo.\"\n\n\"Of course we shall go,\" said Priscilla. \"Hugh is very kind and very\ngenerous, but he is only giving trouble for nothing about this. Had\nwe not better go down to breakfast?\"\n\nAnd so Priscilla carried the day. They went down to breakfast, and\nduring the meal Hugh would speak to nobody. When the gloomy meal\nwas over he took his pipe and walked out to the cottage. It was an\nuntidy-looking, rickety place, small and desolate, with a pretension\nabout it of the lowest order, a pretension that was evidently ashamed\nof itself. There was a porch. And the one sitting-room had what the\nlate Mr. Soames had always called his bow window. But the porch\nlooked as though it were tumbling down, and the bow window looked\nas though it were tumbling out. The parlour and the bedroom over it\nhad been papered;--but the paper was torn and soiled, and in sundry\nplaces was hanging loose. There was a miserable little room called a\nkitchen to the right as you entered the door, in which the grate was\nworn out, and behind this was a shed with a copper. In the garden\nthere remained the stumps and stalks of Mr. Soames's cabbages, and\nthere were weeds in plenty, and a damp hole among some elder bushes\ncalled an arbour. It was named Laburnum Cottage, from a shrub that\ngrew at the end of the house. Hugh Stanbury shuddered as he stood\nsmoking among the cabbage-stalks. How could a man ask such a girl\nas Nora Rowley to be his wife, whose mother lived in a place like\nthis? While he was still standing in the garden, and thinking of\nPriscilla's obstinacy and his own ten guineas a week, and the sort of\nlife which he lived in London,--where he dined usually at his club,\nand denied himself nothing in the way of pipes, beer, and beefsteaks,\nhe heard a step behind him, and turning round, saw his elder sister.\n\n\"Hugh,\" she said, \"you must not be angry with me.\"\n\n\"But I am angry with you.\"\n\n\"I know you are; but you are unjust. I am doing what I am sure is\nright.\"\n\n\"I never saw such a beastly hole as this in all my life.\"\n\n\"I don't think it beastly at all. You'll find that I'll make it nice.\nWhatever we want here you shall give us. You are not to think that I\nam too proud to take anything at your hands. It is not that.\"\n\n\"It's very like it.\"\n\n\"I have never refused anything that is reasonable, but it is quite\nunreasonable that we should go on living in such a place as that, as\nthough we had three or four hundred a year of our own. If mamma got\nused to the comfort of it, it would be hard then upon her to move.\nYou shall give her what you can afford, and what is reasonable; but\nit is madness to think of living there. I couldn't do it.\"\n\n\"You're to have your way at any rate, it seems.\"\n\n\"But you must not quarrel with me, Hugh. Give me a kiss. I don't have\nyou often with me; and yet you are the only man in the world that I\never speak to, or even know. I sometimes half think that the bread is\nso hard and the water so bitter, that life will become impossible. I\ntry to get over it; but if you were to go away from me in anger, I\nshould be so beaten for a week or two that I could do nothing.\"\n\n\"Why won't you let me do anything?\"\n\n\"I will;--whatever you please. But kiss me.\" Then he kissed her, as\nhe stood among Mr. Soames's cabbage-stalks. \"Dear Hugh; you are such\na god to me!\"\n\n\"You don't treat me like a divinity.\"\n\n\"But I think of you as one when you are absent. The gods were never\nobeyed when they showed themselves. Let us go and have a walk.\nCome;--shall we get as far as Ridleigh Mill?\" Then they started\ntogether, and all unpleasantness was over between them when they\nreturned to the Clock House.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nBROOKE BURGESS TAKES LEAVE OF EXETER.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe time had arrived at which Brooke Burgess was to leave Exeter. He\nhad made his tour through the county, and returned to spend his two\nlast nights at Miss Stanbury's house. When he came back Dorothy was\nstill at Nuncombe, but she arrived in the Close the day before his\ndeparture. Her mother and sister had wished her to stay at Nuncombe.\n\"There is a bed for you now, and a place to be comfortable in,\"\nPriscilla had said, laughing, \"and you may as well see the last of\nus.\" But Dorothy declared that she had named a day to her aunt, and\nthat she would not break her engagement. \"I suppose you can stay if\nyou like,\" Priscilla had urged. But Dorothy was of opinion that she\nought not to stay. She said not a word about Brooke Burgess; but it\nmay be that it would have been matter of regret to her not to shake\nhands with him once more. Brooke declared to her that had she not\ncome back he would have gone over to Nuncombe to see her; but Dorothy\ndid not consider herself entitled to believe that.\n\nOn the morning of the last day Brooke went over to his uncle's\noffice. \"I've come to say good-bye, Uncle Barty,\" he said.\n\n\"Good-bye, my boy. Take care of yourself.\"\n\n\"I mean to try.\"\n\n\"You haven't quarrelled with the old woman,--have you?\" said Uncle\nBarty.\n\n\"Not yet;--that is to say, not to the knife.\"\n\n\"And you still believe that you are to have her money?\"\n\n\"I believe nothing one way or the other. You may be sure of this,--I\nshall never count it mine till I've got it; and I shall never make\nmyself so sure of it as to break my heart because I don't get it. I\nsuppose I've got as good a right to it as anybody else, and I don't\nsee why I shouldn't take it if it come in my way.\"\n\n\"I don't think it ever will,\" said the old man, after a pause.\n\n\"I shall be none the worse,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"Yes, you will. You'll be a broken-hearted man. And she means to\nbreak your heart. She does it on purpose. She has no more idea of\nleaving you her money than I have. Why should she?\"\n\n\"Simply because she takes the fancy.\"\n\n\"Fancy! Believe me, there is very little fancy about it. There isn't\none of the name she wouldn't ruin if she could. She'd break all our\nhearts if she could get at them. Look at me and my position. I'm\nlittle more than a clerk in the concern. By God;--I'm not so well off\nas a senior clerk in many a bank. If there came a bad time, I must\nlose as the others would lose;--but a clerk never loses. And my share\nin the business is almost a nothing. It's just nothing,--compared to\nwhat it would have been, only for her.\"\n\nBrooke had known that his uncle was a disappointed, or at least\na discontented man; but he had never known much of the old man's\ncircumstances, and certainly had not expected to hear him speak in\nthe strain that he had now used. He had heard often that his Uncle\nBarty disliked Miss Stanbury, and had not been surprised at former\nsharp, biting little words spoken in reference to that lady's\ncharacter. But he had not expected such a tirade of abuse as the\nbanker had now poured out. \"Of course I know nothing about the bank,\"\nsaid he; \"but I did not suppose that she had had anything to do with\nit.\"\n\n\"Where do you think the money came from that she has got? Did\nyou ever hear that she had anything of her own? She never had a\npenny,--never a penny. It came out of this house. It is the capital\non which this business was founded, and on which it ought to be\ncarried on to this day. My brother had thrown her off; by heavens,\nyes;--had thrown her off. He had found out what she was, and had got\nrid of her.\"\n\n\"But he left her his money.\"\n\n\"Yes;--she got near him when he was dying, and he did leave her his\nmoney;--his money, and my money, and your father's money.\"\n\n\"He could have given her nothing, Uncle Barty, that wasn't his own.\"\n\n\"Of course that's true;--it's true in one way. You might say the same\nof a man who was cozened into leaving every shilling away from his\nown children. I wasn't in Exeter when the will was made. We none\nof us were here. But she was here; and when we came to see him die,\nthere we found her. She had had her revenge upon him, and she means\nto have it on all of us. I don't believe she'll ever leave you a\nshilling, Brooke. You'll find her out yet, and you'll talk of her to\nyour nephews as I do to you.\"\n\nBrooke made some ordinary answer to this, and bade his uncle adieu.\nHe had allowed himself to entertain a half chivalrous idea that he\ncould produce a reconciliation between Miss Stanbury and his uncle\nBarty; and since he had been at Exeter he had said a word, first to\nthe one and then to the other, hinting at the subject; but his hints\nhad certainly not been successful. As he walked from the bank into\nthe High Street he could not fail to ask himself whether there were\nany grounds for the terrible accusations which he had just heard from\nhis uncle's lips. Something of the same kind, though in form much\nless violent, had been repeated to him very often by others of the\nfamily. Though he had as a boy known Miss Stanbury well, he had been\ntaught to regard her as an ogress. All the Burgesses had regarded\nMiss Stanbury as an ogress since that unfortunate will had come\nto light. But she was an ogress from whom something might be\ngained,--and the ogress had still persisted in saying that a Burgess\nshould be her heir. It had therefore come to pass that Brooke had\nbeen brought up half to revere her and half to abhor her. \"She is a\ndreadful woman,\" said his branch of the family, \"who will not scruple\nat anything evil. But as it seems that you may probably reap the\nadvantage of the evil that she does, it will become you to put up\nwith her iniquity.\" As he had become old enough to understand the\nnature of her position, he had determined to judge for himself;--but\nhis judgment hitherto simply amounted to this,--that Miss Stanbury\nwas a very singular old woman, with a kind heart and good instincts,\nbut so capricious withal that no sensible man would risk his\nhappiness on expectations formed on her promises. Guided by this\nopinion, he had resolved to be attentive to her and, after a certain\nfashion, submissive; but certainly not to become her slave. She had\nthrown over her nephew. She was constantly complaining to him of her\nniece. Now and again she would say a very bitter word to him about\nhimself. When he had left Exeter on his little excursion, no one was\nso much in favour with her as Mr. Gibson. On his return he found that\nMr. Gibson had been altogether discarded, and was spoken of in terms\nof almost insolent abuse. \"If I were ever so humble to her,\" he had\nsaid to himself, \"it would do no good; and there is nothing I hate so\nmuch as humility.\" He had thus determined to take the goods the gods\nprovided, should it ever come to pass that such godlike provision was\nlaid before him out of Miss Stanbury's coffers;--but not to alter\nhis mode of life or put himself out of his way in obedience to her\nbehests, as a man might be expected to do who was destined to receive\nso rich a legacy. Upon this idea he had acted, still believing the\nold woman to be good, but believing at the same time that she was\nvery capricious. Now he had heard what his Uncle Bartholomew Burgess\nhad had to say upon the matter, and he could not refrain from asking\nhimself whether his uncle's accusations were true.\n\nIn a narrow passage between the High Street and the Close he met Mr.\nGibson. There had come to be that sort of intimacy between the two\nmen which grows from closeness of position rather than from any\nsocial desire on either side, and it was natural that Burgess should\nsay a word of farewell. On the previous evening Miss Stanbury\nhad relieved her mind by turning Mr. Gibson into ridicule in her\ndescription to Brooke of the manner in which the clergyman had\ncarried on his love affair; and she had at the same time declared\nthat Mr. Gibson had been most violently impertinent to herself. He\nknew, therefore, that Miss Stanbury and Mr. Gibson had become two,\nand would on this occasion have passed on without a word relative\nto the old lady had Mr. Gibson allowed him to do so. But Mr. Gibson\nspoke his mind freely.\n\n\"Off to-morrow, are you?\" he said. \"Good-bye. I hope we may meet\nagain; but not in the same house, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"There or anywhere I shall be very happy,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"Not there, certainly. While you were absent Miss Stanbury treated me\nin such a way that I shall certainly never put my foot in her house\nagain.\"\n\n\"Dear me! I thought that you and she were such great friends.\"\n\n\"I knew her very well, of course;--and respected her. She is a good\nchurchwoman, and is charitable in the city; but she has got such a\ntongue in her head that there is no bearing it when she does what she\ncalls giving you a bit of her mind.\"\n\n\"She has been indulgent to me, and has not given me much of it.\"\n\n\"Your time will come, I've no doubt,\" continued Mr. Gibson.\n\"Everybody has always told me that it would be so. Even her oldest\nfriends knew it. You ask Mrs. MacHugh, or Mrs. French, at Heavitree.\"\n\n\"Mrs. French!\" said Brooke, laughing. \"That would hardly be fair\nevidence.\"\n\n\"Why not? I don't know a better judge of character in all Exeter than\nMrs. French. And she and Miss Stanbury have been intimate all their\nlives. Ask your uncle at the bank.\"\n\n\"My uncle and Miss Stanbury never were friends,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"Ask Hugh Stanbury what he thinks of her. But don't suppose I want\nto say a word against her. I wouldn't for the world do such a thing.\nOnly, as we've met there and all that, I thought it best to let you\nknow that she had treated me in such a way, and has been altogether\nso violent, that I never will go there again.\" So saying, Mr.\nGibson passed on, and was of opinion that he had spoken with great\ngenerosity of the old woman who had treated him so badly.\n\nIn the afternoon Brooke Burgess went over to the further end of the\nClose, and called on Mrs. MacHugh; and from thence he walked across\nto Heavitree, and called on the Frenches. It may be doubted whether\nhe would have been so well behaved to these ladies had they not been\nappealed to by Mr. Gibson as witnesses to the character of Miss\nStanbury. He got very little from Mrs. MacHugh. That lady was kind\nand cordial, and expressed many wishes that she might see him again\nin Exeter. When he said a few words about Mr. Gibson, Mrs. MacHugh\nonly laughed, and declared that the gentleman would soon find a\nplaister for that sore. \"There are more fishes than one in the sea,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"But I'm afraid they've quarrelled, Mrs. MacHugh.\"\n\n\"So they tell me. What should we have to talk about here if somebody\ndidn't quarrel sometimes? She and I ought to get up a quarrel for the\ngood of the public;--only they know that I never can quarrel with\nanybody. I never see anybody interesting enough to quarrel with.\" But\nMrs. MacHugh said nothing about Miss Stanbury, except that she sent\nover a message with reference to a rubber of whist for the next night\nbut one.\n\nHe found the two French girls sitting with their mother, and they all\nexpressed their great gratitude to him for coming to say good-bye\nbefore he went. \"It's so very nice of you, Mr. Burgess,\" said\nCamilla, \"and particularly just at present.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Arabella, \"because you know things have been so\nunpleasant.\"\n\n\"My dears, never mind about that,\" said Mrs. French. \"Miss Stanbury\nhas meant everything for the best, and it is all over now.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by its being all over, mamma,\" said\nCamilla. \"As far as I can understand, it has never been begun.\"\n\n\"My dear, the least said the soonest mended,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"That's of course, mamma,\" said Camilla; \"but yet one can't hold\none's tongue altogether. All the city is talking about it, and I dare\nsay Mr. Burgess has heard as much as anybody else.\"\n\n\"I've heard nothing at all,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"Oh yes, you have,\" continued Camilla. Arabella conceived herself\nat this moment to be situated in so delicate a position, that it\nwas best that her sister should talk about it, and that she herself\nshould hold her tongue,--with the exception, perhaps, of a hint here\nand there which might be of assistance; for Arabella completely\nunderstood that the prize was now to be hers, if the prize could be\nrescued out of the Stanbury clutches. She was aware,--no one better\naware,--how her sister had interfered with her early hopes, and was\nsure, in her own mind, that all her disappointment had come from\nfratricidal rivalry on the part of Camilla. It had never, however,\nbeen open to her to quarrel with Camilla. There they were, linked\ntogether, and together they must fight their battles. As two pigs may\nbe seen at the same trough, each striving to take the delicacies of\nthe banquet from the other, and yet enjoying always the warmth of\nthe same dunghill in amicable contiguity, so had these young ladies\nlived in sisterly friendship, while each was striving to take a\nhusband from the other. They had understood the position, and,\nthough for years back they had talked about Mr. Gibson, they had\nnever quarrelled; but now, in these latter days of the Stanbury\ninterference, there had come tacitly to be something of an\nunderstanding between them that, if any fighting were still possible\non the subject, one must be put forward and the other must yield.\nThere had been no spoken agreement, but Arabella quite understood\nthat she was to be put forward. It was for her to take up the\nrunning, and to win, if possible, against the Stanbury filly. That\nwas her view, and she was inclined to give Camilla credit for acting\nin accordance with it with honesty and zeal. She felt, therefore,\nthat her words on the present occasion ought to be few. She sat back\nin her corner of the sofa, and was intent on her work, and shewed by\nthe pensiveness of her brow that there were thoughts within her bosom\nof which she was not disposed to speak. \"You must have heard a great\ndeal,\" said Camilla, laughing. \"You must know how poor Mr. Gibson has\nbeen abused, because he wouldn't--\"\n\n\"Camilla, don't be foolish,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"Because he wouldn't what?\" asked Brooke. \"What ought he to have done\nthat he didn't do?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about ought,\" said Camilla. \"That's a matter\nof taste altogether.\"\n\n\"I'm the worst hand in the world at a riddle,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"How sly you are,\" continued Camilla, laughing; \"as if dear Aunt\nStanbury hadn't confided all her hopes to you.\"\n\n\"Camilla, dear,--don't,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"But when a gentleman is hunted, and can't be caught, I don't think\nhe ought to be abused to his face.\"\n\n\"But who hunted him, and who abused him?\" asked Brooke.\n\n\"Mind, I don't mean to say a word against Miss Stanbury, Mr. Burgess.\nWe've known her and loved her all our lives;--haven't we, mamma?\"\n\n\"And respected her,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"Quite so,\" continued Camilla. \"But you know, Mr. Burgess, that she\nlikes her own way.\"\n\n\"I don't know anybody that does not,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"And when she's disappointed, she shows it. There's no doubt she is\ndisappointed now, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"What's the good of going on, Camilla?\" said Mrs. French. Arabella\nsat silent in her corner, with a conscious glow of satisfaction, as\nshe reflected that the joint disappointment of the elder and the\nyounger Miss Stanbury had been caused by a tender remembrance of her\nown charms. Had not dear Mr. Gibson told her, in the glowing language\nof truth, that there was nothing further from his thoughts than the\nidea of taking Dorothy Stanbury for his wife?\n\n\"Well, you know,\" continued Camilla, \"I think that when a person\nmakes an attempt, and comes by the worst of it, that person should\nput up with the defeat, and not say all manner of ill-natured things.\nEverybody knows that a certain gentleman is very intimate in this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Don't, dear,\" said Arabella, in a whisper.\n\n\"Yes, I shall,\" said Camilla. \"I don't know why people should hold\ntheir tongues, when other people talk so loudly. I don't care a bit\nwhat anybody says about the gentleman and us. We have known him for\never so many years, and mamma is very fond of him.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am, Camilla,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"And for the matter of that, so am I,--very,\" said Camilla, laughing\nbravely. \"I don't care who knows it.\"\n\n\"Don't be so silly, child,\" said Arabella. Camilla was certainly\ndoing her best, and Arabella was grateful.\n\n\"We don't care what people may say,\" continued Camilla again.\n\"Of course we heard, as everybody else heard too, that a certain\ngentleman was to be married to a certain lady. It was nothing to us\nwhether he was married or not.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"We never spoke ill of the young lady. We did not interfere. If the\ngentleman liked the young lady, he was quite at liberty to marry\nher, as far as we were concerned. We had been in the habit of seeing\nhim here, almost as a brother, and perhaps we might feel that a\nconnection with that particular young lady would take him from us;\nbut we never hinted so much even as that,--to him or to anyone else.\nWhy should we? It was nothing to us. Now it turns out that the\ngentleman never meant anything of the kind, whereupon he is pretty\nnearly kicked out of the house, and all manner of ill-natured things\nare said about us everywhere.\" By this time Camilla had become quite\nexcited, and was speaking with much animation.\n\n\"How can you be so foolish, Camilla?\" said Arabella.\n\n\"Perhaps I am foolish,\" said Camilla, \"to care what anybody says.\"\n\n\"What can it all be to Mr. Burgess?\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"Only this, that as we all like Mr. Burgess, and as he is almost one\nof the family in the Close, I think he ought to know why we are not\nquite so cordial as we used to be. Now that the matter is over I have\nno doubt things will get right again. And as for the young lady, I'm\nsure we feel for her. We think it was the aunt who was indiscreet.\"\n\n\"And then she has such a tongue,\" said Arabella.\n\nOur friend Brooke, of course, knew the whole truth;--knew the nature\nof Mr. Gibson's failure, and knew also how Dorothy had acted in the\naffair. He was inclined, moreover, to believe that the ladies who\nwere now talking to him were as well instructed on the subject as\nwas he himself. He had heard, too, of the ambition of the two young\nladies now before him, and believed that that ambition was not yet\ndead. But he did not think it incumbent on him to fight a battle even\non behalf of Dorothy. He might have declared that Dorothy, at least,\nhad not been disappointed, but he thought it better to be silent\nabout Dorothy. \"Yes,\" he said, \"Miss Stanbury has a tongue; but I\nthink it speaks as much good as it does evil, and perhaps that is a\ngreat deal to say for any lady's tongue.\"\n\n\"We never speak evil of anybody,\" said Camilla; \"never. It is a rule\nwith us.\" Then Brooke took his leave, and the three ladies were\ncordial and almost affectionate in their farewell greetings.\n\nBrooke was to start on the following morning before anybody would\nbe up except Martha, and Miss Stanbury was very melancholy during\nthe evening. \"We shall miss him very much; shall we not?\" she said,\nappealing to Dorothy. \"I am sure you will miss him very much,\" said\nDorothy. \"We are so stupid here alone,\" said Miss Stanbury. When they\nhad drank their tea, she sat nearly silent for half an hour, and then\nsummoned him up into her own room. \"So you are going, Brooke?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes; I must go now. They would dismiss me if I stayed an hour\nlonger.\"\n\n\"It was good of you to come to the old woman; and you must let me\nhear of you from time to time.\"\n\n\"Of course I'll write.\"\n\n\"And, Brooke,--\"\n\n\"What is it, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Do you want any money, Brooke?\"\n\n\"No;--none, thank you. I've plenty for a bachelor.\"\n\n\"When you think of marrying, Brooke, mind you tell me.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to tell you;--but I can't promise yet when that will\nbe.\" She said nothing more to him, though she paused once more as\nthough she were going to speak. She kissed him and bade him good-bye,\nsaying that she would not go down-stairs again that evening. He was\nto tell Dorothy to go to bed. And so they parted.\n\nBut Dorothy did not go to bed for an hour after that. When Brooke\ncame down into the parlour with his message she intended to go at\nonce, and put up her work, and lit her candle, and put out her hand\nto him, and said good-bye to him. But, for all that, she remained\nthere for an hour with him. At first she said very little, but by\ndegrees her tongue was loosened, and she found herself talking with a\nfreedom which she could hardly herself understand. She told him how\nthoroughly she believed her aunt to be a good woman,--how sure she\nwas that her aunt was at any rate honest. \"As for me,\" said Dorothy,\n\"I know that I have displeased her about Mr. Gibson;--and I would go\naway, only that I think she would be so desolate.\" Then Brooke begged\nher never to allow the idea of leaving Miss Stanbury to enter her\nhead. Because Miss Stanbury was capricious, he said, not on that\naccount should her caprices either be indulged or permitted. That\nwas his doctrine respecting Miss Stanbury, and he declared that, as\nregarded himself, he would never be either disrespectful to her or\nsubmissive. \"It is a great mistake,\" he said, \"to think that anybody\nis either an angel or a devil.\" When Dorothy expressed an opinion\nthat with some people angelic tendencies were predominant, and with\nothers diabolic tendencies, he assented; but declared that it was not\nalways easy to tell the one tendency from the other. At last, when\nDorothy had made about five attempts to go, Mr. Gibson's name was\nmentioned. \"I am very glad that you are not going to be Mrs. Gibson,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Brooke Burgess takes his leave.]\n\n\n\"I don't know why you should be glad.\"\n\n\"Because I should not have liked your husband,--not as your husband.\"\n\n\"He is an excellent man, I'm sure,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Nevertheless I am very glad. But I did not think you would accept\nhim, and I congratulate you on your escape. You would have been\nnothing to me as Mrs. Gibson.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't I?\" said Dorothy, not knowing what else to say.\n\n\"But now I think we shall always be friends.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope so, Mr. Burgess. But indeed I must go now. It is\never so late, and you will hardly get any sleep. Good night.\" Then he\ntook her hand, and pressed it very warmly, and referring to a promise\nbefore made to her, he assured her that he would certainly make\nacquaintance with her brother as soon as he was back in London.\nDorothy, as she went up to bed, was more than ever satisfied with\nherself, in that she had not yielded in reference to Mr. Gibson.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nTREVELYAN AT VENICE.\n\n\nTrevelyan passed on moodily and alone from Turin to Venice, always\nexpecting letters from Bozzle, and receiving from time to time the\ndispatches which that functionary forwarded to him, as must be\nacknowledged, with great punctuality. For Mr. Bozzle did his work,\nnot only with a conscience, but with a will. He was now, as he had\ndeclared more than once, altogether devoted to Mr. Trevelyan's\ninterest; and as he was an active, enterprising man, always on the\nalert to be doing something, and as he loved the work of writing\ndispatches, Trevelyan received a great many letters from Bozzle. It\nis not exaggeration to say that every letter made him for the time\na very wretched man. This ex-policeman wrote of the wife of his\nbosom,--of her who had been the wife of his bosom, and who was the\nmother of his child, who was at this very time the only woman whom he\nloved,--with an entire absence of delicacy. Bozzle would have thought\nreticence on his part to be dishonest. We remember Othello's demand\nof Iago. That was the demand which Bozzle understood that Trevelyan\nhad made of him, and he was minded to obey that order. But Trevelyan,\nthough he had in truth given the order, was like Othello also in\nthis,--that he would have preferred before all the prizes of the\nworld to have had proof brought home to him exactly opposite to that\nwhich he demanded. But there was nothing so terrible to him as the\ngrinding suspicion that he was to be kept in the dark. Bozzle could\nfind out facts. Therefore he gave, in effect, the same order that\nOthello gave;--and Bozzle went to work determined to obey it. There\ncame many dispatches to Venice, and at last there came one, which\ncreated a correspondence which shall be given here at length. The\nfirst is a letter from Mr. Bozzle to his employer:--\n\n\n   55, Stony Walk, Union Street, Borough,\n   September 29, 186--, 4.30 P.M.\n\n   HOND. SIR,\n\n   Since I wrote yesterday morning, something has occurred\n   which, it may be, and I think it will, will help to bring\n   this melancholy affair to a satisfactory termination and\n   conclusion. I had better explain, Mr. Trewilyan, how I\n   have been at work from the beginning about watching the\n   Colonel. I couldn't do nothing with the porter at the\n   Albany, which he is always mostly muzzled with beer, and\n   he wouldn't have taken my money, not on the square. So,\n   when it was tellegrammed to me as the Colonel was on the\n   move in the North, I put on two boys as knows the Colonel,\n   at eighteenpence a day, at each end, one Piccadilly end,\n   and the other Saville Row end, and yesterday morning,\n   as quick as ever could be, after the Limited Express\n   Edinburgh Male Up was in, there comes the Saville Row End\n   Boy here to say as the Colonel was lodged safe in his\n   downey. Then I was off immediate myself to St. Diddulph's,\n   because I knows what it is to trust to Inferiors when\n   matters gets delicate. Now, there hadn't been no letters\n   from the Colonel, nor none to him as I could make out,\n   though that mightn't be so sure. She might have had 'em\n   addressed to A. Z., or the like of that, at any of the\n   Post-offices as was distant, as nobody could give the\n   notice to 'em all. Barring the money, which I know ain't\n   an object when the end is so desirable, it don't do to be\n   too ubiketous, because things will go astray. But I've\n   kept my eye uncommon open, and I don't think there have\n   been no letters since that last which was sent, Mr.\n   Trewilyan, let any of 'em, parsons, or what not, say what\n   they will. And I don't see as parsons are better than\n   other folk when they has to do with a lady as likes her\n   fancy-man.\n\n\nTrevelyan, when he had read as far as this, threw down the letter and\ntore his hair in despair. \"My wife,\" he exclaimed, \"Oh, my wife!\" But\nit was essential that he should read Bozzle's letter, and he\npersevered.\n\n\n   Well; I took to the ground myself as soon as ever I heard\n   that the Colonel was among us, and I hung out at the Full\n   Moon. They had been quite on the square with me at the\n   Full Moon, which I mention, because, of course, it has\n   to be remembered, and it do come up as a hitem. And I'm\n   proud, Mr. Trewilyan, as I did take to the ground myself;\n   for what should happen but I see the Colonel as large as\n   life ringing at the parson's bell at 1.47 p.m. He was let\n   in at 1.49, and he was let out at 2.17. He went away in a\n   cab which it was kept, and I followed him till he was put\n   down at the Arcade, and I left him having his 'ed washed\n   and greased at Trufitt's rooms, half-way up. It was a\n   wonder to me when I see this, Mr. Trewilyan, as he didn't\n   have his 'ed done first, as they most of 'em does when\n   they're going to see their ladies; but I couldn't make\n   nothing of that, though I did try to put too and too\n   together, as I always does.\n\n   What he did at the parson's, Mr. Trewilyan, I won't\n   say I saw, and I won't say I know. It's my opinion the\n   young woman there isn't on the square, though she's\n   been remembered too, and is a hitem of course. And, Mr.\n   Trewilyan, it do go against the grain with me when they're\n   remembered and ain't on the square. I doesn't expect too\n   much of Human Nature, which is poor, as the saying goes;\n   but when they're remembered and ain't on the square after\n   that, it's too bad for Human Nature. It's more than poor.\n   It's what I calls beggarly.\n\n   He ain't been there since, Mr. Trewilyan, and he goes out\n   of town to-morrow by the 1.15 p.m. express to Bridport. So\n   he lets on; but of course I shall see to that. That he's\n   been at St. Diddulph's, in the house from 1.47 to 2.17,\n   you may take as a fact. There won't be no shaking of that,\n   because I have it in my mem. book, and no Counsel can get\n   the better of it. Of course he went there to see her, and\n   it's my belief he did. The young woman as was remembered\n   says he didn't, but she isn't on the square. They never is\n   when a lady wants to see her gentleman, though they comes\n   round afterwards, and tells up everything when it comes\n   before his ordinary lordship.\n\n   If you ask me, Mr. Trewilyan, I don't think it's ripe yet\n   for the court, but we'll have it ripe before long. I'll\n   keep a look-out, because it's just possible she may leave\n   town. If she do, I'll be down upon them together, and no\n   mistake.\n\n   Yours most respectful,\n\n   S. BOZZLE.\n\n\nEvery word in the letter had been a dagger to Trevelyan, and yet he\nfelt himself to be under an obligation to the man who had written\nit. No one else would or could make facts known to him. If she were\ninnocent, let him know that she were innocent, and he would proclaim\nher innocence, and believe in her innocence,--and sacrifice himself\nto her innocence, if such sacrifice were necessary. But if she were\nguilty, let him also know that. He knew how bad it was, all that\nbribing of postmen and maidservants, who took his money, and her\nmoney also, very likely. It was dirt, all of it. But who had put him\ninto the dirt? His wife had, at least, deceived him,--had deceived\nhim and disobeyed him, and it was necessary that he should know the\nfacts. Life without a Bozzle would now have been to him a perfect\nblank.\n\nThe Colonel had been to the parsonage at St. Diddulph's, and had\nbeen admitted! As to that he had no doubt. Nor did he really doubt\nthat his wife had seen the visitor. He had sent his wife first\ninto a remote village on Dartmoor, and there she had been visited\nby her--lover! How was he to use any other word? Iago;--oh, Iago!\nThe pity of it, Iago! Then, when she had learned that this was\ndiscovered, she had left the retreat in which he had placed\nher,--without permission from him,--and had taken herself to\nthe house of a relative of hers. Here she was visited again by\nher--lover! Oh, Iago; the pity of it, Iago! And then there had been\nbetween them an almost constant correspondence. So much he had\nascertained as fact; but he did not for a moment believe that Bozzle\nhad learned all the facts. There might be correspondence, or even\nvisits, of which Bozzle could learn nothing. How could Bozzle know\nwhere Mrs. Trevelyan was during all those hours which Colonel Osborne\npassed in London? That which he knew, he knew absolutely, and on\nthat he could act; but there was, of course, much of which he knew\nnothing. Gradually the truth would unveil itself, and then he would\nact. He would tear that Colonel into fragments, and throw his wife\nfrom him with all the ignominy which the law made possible to him.\n\nBut in the meantime he wrote a letter to Mr. Outhouse. Colonel\nOsborne, after all that had been said, had been admitted at the\nparsonage, and Trevelyan was determined to let the clergyman know\nwhat he thought about it. The oftener he turned the matter in his\nmind, as he walked slowly up and down the piazza of St. Mark, the\nmore absurd it appeared to him to doubt that his wife had seen the\nman. Of course she had seen him. He walked there nearly the whole\nnight, thinking of it, and as he dragged himself off at last to his\ninn, had almost come to have but one desire,--namely, that he should\nfind her out, that the evidence should be conclusive, that it should\nbe proved, and so brought to an end. Then he would destroy her, and\ndestroy that man,--and afterwards destroy himself, so bitter to him\nwould be his ignominy. He almost revelled in the idea of the tragedy\nhe would make. It was three o'clock before he was in his bedroom, and\nthen he wrote his letter to Mr. Outhouse before he took himself to\nhis bed. It was as follows:--\n\n\n   Venice, Oct. 4, 186--.\n\n   SIR,\n\n   Information of a certain kind, on which I can place a\n   firm reliance, has reached me, to the effect that Colonel\n   Osborne has been allowed to visit at your house during\n   the sojourn of my wife under your roof. I will thank you\n   to inform me whether this be true; as, although I am\n   confident of my facts, it is necessary, in reference to my\n   ulterior conduct, that I should have from you either an\n   admission or a denial of my assertion. It is of course\n   open to you to leave my letter unanswered. Should you\n   think proper to do so, I shall know also how to deal with\n   that fact.\n\n   As to your conduct in admitting Colonel Osborne into your\n   house while my wife is there,--after all that has passed,\n   and all that you know that has passed,--I am quite unable\n   to speak with anything like moderation of feeling. Had the\n   man succeeded in forcing himself into your residence, you\n   should have been the first to give me notice of it. As it\n   is, I have been driven to ascertain the fact from other\n   sources. I think that you have betrayed the trust that a\n   husband has placed in you, and that you will find from the\n   public voice that you will be regarded as having disgraced\n   yourself as a clergyman.\n\n   In reference to my wife herself, I would wish her to know,\n   that after what has now taken place, I shall not feel\n   myself justified in leaving our child longer in her hands,\n   even tender as are his years. I shall take steps for\n   having him removed. What further I shall do to vindicate\n   myself, and extricate myself as far as may be possible\n   from the slough of despond in which I have been submerged,\n   she and you will learn in due time.\n\n   Your obedient servant,\n\n   L. TREVELYAN.\n\n   A letter addressed \"poste restante, Venice,\" will reach me\n   here.\n\n\nIf Trevelyan was mad when he wrote this letter, Mr. Outhouse was\nvery nearly as mad when he read it. He had most strongly desired\nto have nothing to do with his wife's niece when she was separated\nfrom her husband. He was a man honest, charitable, and sufficiently\naffectionate; but he was timid, and disposed to think ill of those\nwhose modes of life were strange to him. Actuated by these feelings,\nhe would have declined to offer the hospitality of his roof to Mrs.\nTrevelyan, had any choice been left to him. But there had been no\nchoice. She had come thither unasked, with her boy and baggage, and\nhe could not send her away. His wife had told him that it was his\nduty to protect these women till their father came, and he recognised\nthe truth of what his wife said. There they were, and there they must\nremain throughout the winter. It was hard upon him,--especially as\nthe difficulties and embarrassments as to money were so disagreeable\nto him;--but there was no help for it. His duty must be done though\nit were ever so painful. Then that horrid Colonel had come. And now\nhad come this letter, in which he was not only accused of being an\naccomplice between his married niece and her lover, but was also\nassured that he should be held up to public ignominy and disgrace.\nThough he had often declared that Trevelyan was mad, he would not\nremember that now. Such a letter as he had received should have been\ntreated by him as the production of a madman. But he was not sane\nenough himself to see the matter in that light. He gnashed his teeth,\nand clenched his fist, and was almost beside himself as he read the\nletter a second time.\n\nThere had been a method in Trevelyan's madness; for though he had\ndeclared to himself that without doubt Bozzle had been right in\nsaying that as the Colonel had been at the parsonage, therefore, as a\ncertainty, Mrs. Trevelyan had met the Colonel there, yet he had not\nso stated in his letter. He had merely asserted that Colonel Osborne\nhad been at the house, and had founded his accusation upon that\nalleged fact. The alleged fact had been in truth a fact. So far\nBozzle had been right. The Colonel had been at the parsonage; and the\nreader knows how far Mr. Outhouse had been to blame for his share\nin the matter! He rushed off to his wife with the letter, declaring\nat first that Mrs. Trevelyan, Nora, and the child, and the servant,\nshould be sent out of the house at once. But at last Mrs. Outhouse\nsucceeded in showing him that he would not be justified in ill-using\nthem because Trevelyan had ill-used him. \"But I will write to him,\"\nsaid Mr. Outhouse. \"He shall know what I think about it.\" And he did\nwrite his letter that day, in spite of his wife's entreaties that\nhe would allow the sun to set upon his wrath. And his letter was as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   St. Diddulph's, October 8, 186--.\n\n   SIR,\n\n   I have received your letter of the 4th, which is more\n   iniquitous, unjust, and ungrateful, than anything I ever\n   before saw written. I have been surprised from the first\n   at your gross cruelty to your unoffending wife; but even\n   that seems to me more intelligible than your conduct in\n   writing such words as those which you have dared to send\n   to me.\n\n   For your wife's sake, knowing that she is in a great\n   degree still in your power, I will condescend to tell\n   you what has happened. When Mrs. Trevelyan found herself\n   constrained to leave Nuncombe Putney by your aspersions\n   on her character, she came here, to the protection of her\n   nearest relatives within reach, till her father and mother\n   should be in England. Sorely against my will I received\n   them into my home, because they had been deprived of other\n   shelter by the cruelty or madness of him who should have\n   been their guardian. Here they are, and here they shall\n   remain till Sir Marmaduke Rowley arrives. The other day,\n   on the 29th of September, Colonel Osborne, who is their\n   father's old friend, called, not on them, but on me. I may\n   truly say that I did not wish to see Colonel Osborne. They\n   did not see him, nor did he ask to see them. If his coming\n   was a fault,--and I think it was a fault,--they were\n   not implicated in it. He came, remained a few minutes,\n   and went without seeing any one but myself. That is the\n   history of Colonel Osborne's visit to my house.\n\n   I have not thought fit to show your letter to your wife,\n   or to make her acquainted with this further proof of your\n   want of reason. As to the threats which you hold out\n   of removing her child from her, you can of course do\n   nothing except by law. I do not think that even you will\n   be sufficiently audacious to take any steps of that\n   description. Whatever protection the law may give her\n   and her child from your tyranny and misconduct cannot be\n   obtained till her father shall be here.\n\n   I have only further to request that you will not address\n   any further communication to me. Should you do so, it will\n   be refused.\n\n   Yours in deep indignation,\n\n   OLIPHANT OUTHOUSE.\n\n\nTrevelyan had also written two other letters to England, one to Mr.\nBideawhile and the other to Bozzle. In the former he acquainted the\nlawyer that he had discovered that his wife still maintained her\nintercourse with Colonel Osborne, and that he must therefore remove\nhis child from her custody. He then inquired what steps would be\nnecessary to enable him to obtain possession of his little boy.\nIn the letter to Bozzle he sent a cheque, and his thanks for the\nex-policeman's watchful care. He desired Bozzle to continue his\nprecautions, and explained his intentions about his son. Being\nsomewhat afraid that Mr. Bideawhile might not be zealous on his\nbehalf, and not himself understanding accurately the extent of his\npower with regard to his own child, or the means whereby he might\nexercise it, he was anxious to obtain assistance from Bozzle also on\nthis point. He had no doubt that Bozzle knew all about it. He had\ngreat confidence in Bozzle. But still he did not like to consult the\nex-policeman. He knew that it became him to have some regard for his\nown dignity. He therefore put the matter very astutely to Bozzle,\nasking no questions, but alluding to his difficulty in a way that\nwould enable Bozzle to offer advice.\n\nAnd where was he to get a woman to take charge of his child? If Lady\nMilborough would do it, how great would be the comfort! But he was\nalmost sure that Lady Milborough would not do it. All his friends had\nturned against him, and Lady Milborough among the number. There was\nnobody left to him, but Bozzle. Could he entrust Bozzle to find some\nwoman for him who would take adequate charge of the little fellow,\ntill he himself could see to the child's education? He did not put\nthis question to Bozzle in plain terms; but he was very astute, and\nwrote in such a fashion that Bozzle could make a proposal, if any\nproposal were within his power.\n\nThe answer from Mr. Outhouse came first. To this Mr. Trevelyan paid\nvery little attention. It was just what he expected. Of course Mr.\nOuthouse's assurance about Colonel Osborne went for nothing. A man\nwho would permit intercourse in his house between a married lady and\nher lover would not scruple to deny that he had permitted it. Then\ncame Mr. Bideawhile's answer, which was very short. Mr. Bideawhile\nsaid that nothing could be done about the child till Mr. Trevelyan\nshould return to England;--and that he could give no opinion as to\nwhat should be done then till he knew more of the circumstances. It\nwas quite clear to Trevelyan that he must employ some other lawyer.\nMr. Bideawhile had probably been corrupted by Colonel Osborne. Could\nBozzle recommend a lawyer?\n\nFrom Bozzle himself there came no other immediate reply than, \"his\nduty, and that he would make further inquiries.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nTHE AMERICAN MINISTER.\n\n\nIn the second week in October, Mr. Glascock returned to Florence,\nintending to remain there till the weather should have become\nbearable at Naples. His father was said to be better, but was in\nsuch a condition as hardly to receive much comfort from his son's\npresence. His mind was gone, and he knew no one but his nurse; and,\nthough Mr. Glascock was unwilling to put himself altogether out of\nthe reach of returning at a day's notice, he did not find himself\nobliged to remain in Naples during the heat of the autumn. So Mr.\nGlascock returned to the hotel at Florence, accompanied by the tall\nman who wore the buttons. The hotel-keeper did not allow such a light\nto remain long hidden under a bushel, and it was soon spread far and\nwide that the Honourable Charles Glascock and his suite were again in\nthe beautiful city.\n\nAnd the fact was soon known to the American Minister and his family.\nMr. Spalding was a man who at home had been very hostile to English\ninterests. Many American gentlemen are known for such hostility. They\nmake anti-English speeches about the country, as though they thought\nthat war with England would produce certain triumph to the States,\ncertain increase to American trade, and certain downfall to a tyranny\nwhich no Anglo-Saxon nation ought to endure. But such is hardly their\nreal opinion. There, in the States, as also here in England, you\nshall from day to day hear men propounding, in very loud language,\nadvanced theories of political action, the assertion of which\nis supposed to be necessary to the end which they have in view.\nMen whom we know to have been as mild as sucking doves in the\npolitical aspiration of their whole lives, suddenly jump up,\nand with infuriated gestures declare themselves the enemies\nof everything existing. When they have attained their little\npurpose,--or have failed to do so,--they revert naturally into their\nsucking-dove elements. It is so with Americans as frequently as\nwith ourselves,--and there is no political subject on which it is\nconsidered more expedient to express pseudo-enthusiasm than on that\nof the sins of England. It is understood that we do not resent it.\nIt is presumed that we regard it as the Irishman regarded his wife's\ncuffs. In the States a large party, which consists chiefly of those\nwho have lately left English rule, and who are keen to prove to\nthemselves how wise they have been in doing so, is pleased by this\nstrong language against England; and, therefore, the strong language\nis spoken. But the speakers, who are, probably, men knowing something\nof the world, mean it not at all; they have no more idea of war with\nEngland than they have of war with all Europe; and their respect for\nEngland and for English opinion is unbounded. In their political\ntones of speech and modes of action they strive to be as English as\npossible. Mr. Spalding's aspirations were of this nature. He had\nuttered speeches against England which would make the hair stand on\nend on the head of an uninitiated English reader. He had told his\ncountrymen that Englishmen hugged their chains, and would do so until\nAmerican hammers had knocked those chains from off their wounded\nwrists and bleeding ankles. He had declared that, if certain American\nclaims were not satisfied, there was nothing left for Americans to do\nbut to cross the ferry with such a sheriff's officer as would be able\nto make distraint on the great English household. He had declared\nthat the sheriff's officer would have very little trouble. He had\nspoken of Canada as an outlying American territory, not yet quite\nsufficiently redeemed from savage life to be received into the Union\nas a State. There is a multiplicity of subjects of this kind ready\nto the hand of the American orator. Mr. Spalding had been quite\nsuccessful, and was now Minister at Florence; but, perhaps, one of\nthe greatest pleasures coming to him from his prosperity was the\nenjoyment of the society of well-bred Englishmen, in the capital to\nwhich he had been sent. When, therefore, his wife and nieces pointed\nout to him the fact that it was manifestly his duty to call upon Mr.\nGlascock after what had passed between them on that night under the\nCampanile, he did not rebel for an instant against the order given\nto him. His mind never reverted for a moment to that opinion which\nhad gained for him such a round of applause, when expressed on the\nplatform of the Temperance Hall at Nubbly Creek, State of Illinois,\nto the effect that the English aristocrat, thorough-born and\nthorough-bred, who inherited acres and titles from his father, could\nnever be fitting company for a thoughtful Christian American citizen.\nHe at once had his hat brushed, and took up his best gloves and\numbrella, and went off to Mr. Glascock's hotel. He was strictly\nenjoined by the ladies to fix a day on which Mr. Glascock would come\nand dine at the American embassy.\n\n\"'C. G.' has come back to see you,\" said Olivia to her elder sister.\nThey had always called him \"C. G.\" since the initials had been seen\non the travelling bag.\n\n\"Probably,\" said Carry. \"There is so very little else to bring people\nto Florence, that there can hardly be any other reason for his\ncoming. They do say it's terribly hot at Naples just now; but that\ncan have had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Livy. \"I'm sure he's in love with you. He looked\nto me just like a proper sort of lover for you, when I saw his long\nlegs creeping up over our heads into the banquette.\"\n\n\"You ought to have been very much obliged to his long legs;--so sick\nas you were at the time.\"\n\n\"I like him amazingly,\" said Livy, \"legs and all. I only hope Uncle\nJonas won't bore him, so as to prevent his coming.\"\n\n\"His father is very ill,\" said Carry, \"and I don't suppose we shall\nsee him at all.\"\n\nBut the American Minister was successful. He found Mr. Glascock\nsitting in his dressing-gown, smoking a cigar, and reading a\nnewspaper. The English aristocrat seemed very glad to see his\nvisitor, and assumed no airs at all. The American altogether forgot\nhis speech at Nubbly Creek, and found the aristocrat's society to\nbe very pleasant. He lit a cigar, and they talked about Naples,\nRome, and Florence. Mr. Spalding, when the marbles of old Rome were\nmentioned, was a little too keen in insisting on the merits of Story,\nMiss Hosmer, and Hiram Powers, and hardly carried his listener with\nhim in the parallel which he drew between Greenough and Phidias; and\nhe was somewhat repressed by the apathetic curtness of Mr. Glascock's\nreply, when he suggested that the victory gained by the gunboats at\nVicksburg, on the Mississippi, was vividly brought to his mind by\nan account which he had just been reading of the battle of Actium;\nbut he succeeded in inducing Mr. Glascock to accept an invitation to\ndinner for the next day but one, and the two gentlemen parted on the\nmost amicable terms.\n\nEverybody meets everybody in Florence every day. Carry and Livy\nSpalding had met Mr. Glascock twice before the dinner at their\nuncle's house, so that they met at dinner quite as intimate friends.\nMrs. Spalding had very large rooms, up three flights of stairs, on\nthe Lungarno. The height of her abode was attributed by Mrs. Spalding\nto her dread of mosquitoes. She had not yet learned that people in\nFlorence require no excuse for being asked to walk up three flights\nof stairs. The rooms, when they were reached, were very lofty,\nfloored with what seemed to be marble, and were of a nature almost to\nwarrant Mrs. Spalding in feeling that nature had made her more akin\nto an Italian countess than to a matron of Nubbly Creek, State of\nIllinois, where Mr. Spalding had found her and made her his own.\nThere was one other Englishman present, Mr. Harris Hyde Granville\nGore, from the Foreign Office, now serving temporarily at the English\nLegation in Florence; and an American, Mr. Jackson Unthank, a man of\nwealth and taste, who was resolved on having such a collection of\npictures at his house in Baltimore that no English private collection\nshould in any way come near to it; and a Tuscan, from the Italian\nForeign Office, to whom nobody could speak except Mr. Harris Hyde\nGranville Gore,--who did not indeed seem to enjoy the efforts of\nconversation which were expected of him. The Italian, who had a\nhandle to his name,--he was a Count Buonarosci,--took Mrs. Spalding\nin to dinner. Mrs. Spalding had been at great trouble to ascertain\nwhether this was proper, or whether she should not entrust herself\nto Mr. Glascock. There were different points to be considered in\nthe matter. She did not quite know whether she was in Italy or in\nAmerica. She had glimmerings on the subject of her privilege to carry\nher own nationality into her own drawing-room. And then she was\ncalled upon to deal between an Italian Count with an elder brother,\nand an English Honourable, who had no such incumbrance. Which of the\ntwo was possessed of the higher rank? \"I've found it all out, Aunt\nMary,\" said Livy. \"You must take the Count.\" For Livy wanted to give\nher sister every chance. \"How have you found it out?\" said the aunt.\n\"You may be sure it is so,\" said Livy. And the lady in her doubt\nyielded the point. Mrs. Spalding, as she walked along the passage on\nthe Count's arm, determined that she would learn Italian. She would\nhave given all Nubbly Creek to have been able to speak a word to\nCount Buonarosci. To do her justice, it must be admitted that she had\nstudied a few words. But her courage failed her, and she could not\nspeak them. She was very careful, however, that Mr. H. H. G. Gore was\nplaced in the chair next to the Count.\n\n\"We are very glad to see you here,\" said Mr. Spalding, addressing\nhimself especially to Mr. Glascock, as he stood up at his own seat at\nthe round table. \"In leaving my own country, sir, there is nothing\nthat I value more than the privilege of becoming acquainted with\nthose whose historic names and existing positions are of such\ninestimable value to the world at large.\" In saying this, Mr.\nSpalding was not in the least insincere, nor did his conscience at\nall prick him in reference to that speech at Nubbly Creek. On both\noccasions he half thought as he spoke,--or thought that he thought\nso. Unless it be on subjects especially endeared to us the thoughts\nof but few of us go much beyond this.\n\nMr. Glascock, who sat between Mrs. Spalding and her niece, was soon\nasked by the elder lady whether he had been in the States. No; he\nhad not been in the States. \"Then you must come, Mr. Glascock,\" said\nMrs. Spalding, \"though I will not say, dwelling as we now are in the\nmetropolis of the world of art, that we in our own homes have as much\nof the outer beauty of form to charm the stranger as is to be found\nin other lands. Yet I think that the busy lives of men, and the\nvaried institutions of a free country, must always have an interest\npeculiarly their own.\" Mr. Glascock declared that he quite agreed\nwith her, and expressed a hope that he might some day find himself in\nNew York.\n\n\"You wouldn't like it at all,\" said Carry; \"because you are an\naristocrat. I don't mean that it would be your fault.\"\n\n\"Why should that prevent my liking it,--even if I were an\naristocrat?\"\n\n\"One half of the people would run after you, and the other half would\nrun away from you,\" said Carry.\n\n\"Then I'd take to the people who ran after me, and would not regard\nthe others.\"\n\n\"That's all very well,--but you wouldn't like it. And then you would\nbecome unfair to what you saw. When some of our speechifying people\ntalked to you about our institutions through their noses, you would\nthink that the institutions themselves must be bad. And we have\nnothing to show except our institutions.\"\n\n\"What are American institutions?\" asked Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"Everything is an institution. Having iced water to drink in every\nroom of the house is an institution. Having hospitals in every town\nis an institution. Travelling altogether in one class of railway\ncars is an institution. Saying sir, is an institution. Teaching all\nthe children mathematics is an institution. Plenty of food is an\ninstitution. Getting drunk is an institution in a great many towns.\nLecturing is an institution. There are plenty of them, and some are\nvery good;--but you wouldn't like it.\"\n\n\"At any rate, I'll go and see,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"If you do, I hope we may be at home,\" said Miss Spalding.\n\nMr. Spalding, in the mean time, with the assistance of his\ncountryman, the man of taste, was endeavouring to explain a certain\npoint in American politics to the Count. As, in doing this, they\ncalled upon Mr. Gore to translate every speech they made into\nItalian, and as Mr. Gore had never offered his services as an\ninterpreter, and as the Italian did not quite catch the subtle\nmeanings of the Americans in Mr. Gore's Tuscan version, and did not\nin the least wish to understand the things that were explained to\nhim, Mr. Gore and the Italian began to think that the two Americans\nwere bores. \"The truth is, Mr. Spalding,\" said Mr. Gore, \"I've got\nsuch a cold in my head, that I don't think I can explain it any\nmore.\" Then Livy Spalding laughed aloud, and the two American\ngentlemen began to eat their dinner. \"It sounds ridiculous, don't\nit?\" said Mr. Gore, in a whisper.\n\n\"I ought not to have laughed, I know,\" said Livy.\n\n\"The very best thing you could have done. I shan't be troubled any\nmore now. The fact is, I know just nine words of Italian. Now there\nis a difficulty in having to explain the whole theory of American\npolitics to an Italian, who doesn't want to know anything about it,\nwith so very small a repertory of words at one's command.\"\n\n\"How well you did it!\"\n\n\"Too well. I felt that. So well that, unless I had stopped it, I\nshouldn't have been able to say a word to you all through dinner.\nYour laughter clenched it, and Buonarosci and I will be grateful to\nyou for ever.\"\n\nAfter the ladies went there was rather a bad half hour for Mr.\nGlascock. He was button-holed by the minister, and found it\noppressive before he was enabled to escape into the drawing-room.\n\"Mr. Glascock,\" said the minister, \"an English gentleman, sir,\nlike you, who has the privilege of an hereditary seat in your\nparliament,\"--Mr. Glascock was not quite sure whether he were being\naccused of having an hereditary seat in the House of Commons, but he\nwould not stop to correct any possible error on that point,--\"and who\nhas been born to all the gifts of fortune, rank, and social eminence,\nshould never think that his education is complete till he has visited\nour great cities in the west.\" Mr. Glascock hinted that he by no\nmeans conceived his education to be complete; but the minister went\non without attending to this. \"Till you have seen, sir, what men\ncan do who are placed upon the earth with all God's gifts of free\nintelligence, free air, and a free soil, but without any of those\nother good things which we are accustomed to call the gifts of\nfortune, you can never become aware of the infinite ingenuity of\nman.\" There had been much said before, but just at this moment Mr.\nGore and the American left the room, and the Italian followed them\nbriskly. Mr. Glascock at once made a decided attempt to bolt; but the\nminister was on the alert, and was too quick for him. And he was by\nno means ashamed of what he was doing. He had got his guest by the\ncoat, and openly declared his intention of holding him. \"Let me keep\nyou for a few minutes, sir,\" said he, \"while I dilate on this point\nin one direction. In the drawing-room female spells are too potent\nfor us male orators. In going among us, Mr. Glascock, you must not\nlook for luxury or refinement, for you will find them not. Nor must\nyou hope to encounter the highest order of erudition. The lofty\nsummits of acquired knowledge tower in your country with an altitude\nwe have not reached yet.\"\n\n\"It's very good of you to say so,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"No, sir. In our new country and in our new cities we still lack the\nluxurious perfection of fastidious civilisation. But, sir, regard our\nlevel. That is what I say to every unprejudiced Britisher that comes\namong us; look at our level. And when you have looked at our level,\nI think that you will confess that we live on the highest table-land\nthat the world has yet afforded to mankind. You follow my meaning,\nMr. Glascock?\" Mr. Glascock was not sure that he did, but the\nminister went on to make that meaning clear. \"It is the multitude\nthat with us is educated. Go into their houses, sir, and see how they\nthumb their books. Look at the domestic correspondence of our helps\nand servants, and see how they write and spell. We haven't got the\nmountains, sir, but our table-lands are the highest on which the\nbright sun of our Almighty God has as yet shone with its illuminating\nsplendour in this improving world of ours! It is because we are a\nyoung people, sir,--with nothing as yet near to us of the decrepitude\nof age. The weakness of age, sir, is the penalty paid by the folly of\nyouth. We are not so wise, sir, but what we too shall suffer from its\neffects as years roll over our heads.\" There was a great deal more,\nbut at last Mr. Glascock did escape into the drawing-room.\n\n\"My uncle has been saying a few words to you perhaps,\" said Carry\nSpalding.\n\n\"Yes; he has,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"He usually does,\" said Carry Spalding.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nABOUT FISHING, AND NAVIGATION, AND HEAD-DRESSES.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe feud between Miss Stanbury and Mr. Gibson raged violently in\nExeter, and produced many complications which were very difficult\nindeed of management. Each belligerent party felt that a special\ninjury had been inflicted upon it. Mr. Gibson was quite sure that he\nhad been grossly misused by Miss Stanbury the elder, and strongly\nsuspected that Miss Stanbury the younger had had a hand in this\nmisconduct. It had been positively asserted to him,--at least so he\nthought, but in this was probably in error,--that the lady would\naccept him if he proposed to her. All Exeter had been made aware of\nthe intended compact. He, indeed, had denied its existence to Miss\nFrench, comforting himself, as best he might, with the reflection\nthat all is fair in love and war; but when he counted over his\ninjuries he did not think of this denial. All Exeter, so to say, had\nknown of it. And yet, when he had come with his proposal, he had been\nrefused without a moment's consideration, first by the aunt, and then\nby the niece;--and, after that, had been violently abused, and at\nlast turned out of the house! Surely, no gentleman had ever before\nbeen subjected to ill-usage so violent! But Miss Stanbury the elder\nwas quite as assured that the injury had been done to her. As to the\nmatter of the compact itself, she knew very well that she had been as\ntrue as steel. She had done everything in her power to bring about\nthe marriage. She had been generous in her offers of money. She had\nused all her powers of persuasion on Dorothy, and she had given\nevery opportunity to Mr. Gibson. It was not her fault if he had not\nbeen able to avail himself of the good things which she had put in\nhis way. He had first been, as she thought, ignorant and arrogant,\nfancying that the good things ought to be made his own without any\ntrouble on his part;--and then awkward, not knowing how to take the\ntrouble when trouble was necessary. And as to that matter of abusive\nlanguage and turning out of the house, Miss Stanbury was quite\nconvinced that she was sinned against, and not herself the sinner.\nShe declared to Martha, more than once, that Mr. Gibson had used such\nlanguage to her that, coming out of a clergyman's mouth, it had quite\ndismayed her. Martha, who knew her mistress, probably felt that Mr.\nGibson had at least received as good as he gave; but she had made no\nattempt to set her mistress right on that point.\n\nBut the cause of Miss Stanbury's sharpest anger was not to be found\nin Mr. Gibson's conduct either before Dorothy's refusal of his offer,\nor on the occasion of his being turned out of the house. A base\nrumour was spread about the city that Dorothy Stanbury had been\noffered to Mr. Gibson, that Mr. Gibson had civilly declined the\noffer,--and that hence had arisen the wrath of the Juno of the Close.\nNow this was not to be endured by Miss Stanbury. She had felt even\nin the moment of her original anger against Mr. Gibson that she was\nbound in honour not to tell the story against him. She had brought\nhim into the little difficulty, and she at least would hold her\ntongue. She was quite sure that Dorothy would never boast of her\ntriumph. And Martha had been strictly cautioned,--as indeed, also,\nhad Brooke Burgess. The man had behaved like an idiot, Miss Stanbury\nsaid; but he had been brought into a little dilemma, and nothing\nshould be said about it from the house in the Close. But when the\nother rumour reached Miss Stanbury's ears, when Mrs. Crumbie condoled\nwith her on her niece's misfortune, when Mrs. MacHugh asked whether\nMr. Gibson had not behaved rather badly to the young lady, then our\nJuno's celestial mind was filled with a divine anger. But even then\nshe did not declare the truth. She asked a question of Mrs. Crumbie,\nand was enabled, as she thought, to trace the falsehood to the\nFrenches. She did not think that Mr. Gibson could on a sudden have\nbecome so base a liar. \"Mr. Gibson fast and loose with my niece!\" she\nsaid to Mrs. MacHugh. \"You have not got the story quite right, my\ndear friend. Pray, believe me;--there has been nothing of that sort.\"\n\"I dare say not,\" said Mrs. MacHugh, \"and I'm sure I don't care. Mr.\nGibson has been going to marry one of the French girls for the last\nten years, and I think he ought to make up his mind and do it at\nlast.\"\n\n\"I can assure you he is quite welcome as far as Dorothy is\nconcerned,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\nWithout a doubt the opinion did prevail throughout Exeter that Mr.\nGibson, who had been regarded time out of mind as the property of\nthe Miss Frenches, had been angled for by the ladies in the Close,\nthat he had nearly been caught, but that he had slipped the hook\nout of his mouth, and was now about to subside quietly into the net\nwhich had been originally prepared for him. Arabella French had not\nspoken loudly on the subject, but Camilla had declared in more than\none house that she had most direct authority for stating that the\ngentleman had never dreamed of offering to the young lady. \"Why he\nshould not do so if he pleases, I don't know,\" said Camilla. \"Only\nthe fact is that he has not pleased. The rumour of course has reached\nhim, and, as we happen to be very old friends, we have authority for\ndenying it altogether.\" All this came round to Miss Stanbury, and she\nwas divine in her wrath.\n\n\"If they drive me to it,\" she said to Dorothy, \"I'll have the whole\ntruth told by the bellman through the city, or I'll publish it in the\nCounty Gazette.\"\n\n\"Pray don't say a word about it, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"It is those odious girls. He's there now every day.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he go there, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"If he's fool enough, let him go. I don't care where he goes. But\nI do care about these lies. They wouldn't dare to say it only they\nthink my mouth is closed. They've no honour themselves, but they\nscreen themselves behind mine.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they won't find themselves mistaken in what they trust to,\"\nsaid Dorothy, with a spirit that her aunt had not expected from her.\nMiss Stanbury at this time had told nobody that the offer to her\nniece had been made and repeated and finally rejected;--but she found\nit very difficult to hold her tongue.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Gibson spent a good deal of his time at\nHeavitree. It should not perhaps be asserted broadly that he had made\nup his mind that marriage would be good for him; but he had made up\nhis mind, at least, to this, that it was no longer to be postponed\nwithout a balance of disadvantage. The Charybdis in the Close drove\nhim helpless into the whirlpool of the Heavitree Scylla. He had no\nlonger an escape from the perils of the latter shore. He had been so\nmauled by the opposite waves, that he had neither spirit nor skill\nleft to him to keep in the middle track. He was almost daily at\nHeavitree, and did not attempt to conceal from himself the approach\nof his doom.\n\nBut still there were two of them. He knew that he must become a prey,\nbut was there any choice left to him as to which siren should have\nhim? He had been quite aware in his more gallant days, before he had\nbeen knocked about on that Charybdis rock, that he might sip, and\ntaste, and choose between the sweets. He had come to think lately\nthat the younger young lady was the sweeter. Eight years ago indeed\nthe passages between him and the elder had been tender; but Camilla\nhad then been simply a romping girl, hardly more than a year or two\nbeyond her teens. Now, with her matured charms, Camilla was certainly\nthe more engaging as far as outward form went. Arabella's cheeks\nwere thin and long, and her front teeth had come to show themselves.\nHer eyes were no doubt still bright, and what she had of hair was\nsoft and dark. But it was very thin in front, and what there was of\nsupplemental mass behind,--the bandbox by which Miss Stanbury was\nso much aggrieved,--was worn with an indifference to the lines of\nbeauty, which Mr. Gibson himself found to be very depressing. A man\nwith a fair burden on his back is not a grievous sight; but when\nwe see a small human being attached to a bale of goods which he\ncan hardly manage to move, we feel that the poor fellow has been\ncruelly overweighted. Mr. Gibson certainly had that sensation about\nArabella's chignon. And as he regarded it in a nearer and a dearer\nlight,--as a chignon that might possibly become his own, as a burden\nwhich in one sense he might himself be called upon to bear, as a\ndomestic utensil which he himself might be called upon to inspect,\nand perhaps to aid the shifting on and the shifting off, he did begin\nto think that that side of the Scylla gulf ought to be avoided if\npossible. And probably this propensity on his part, this feeling that\nhe would like to reconsider the matter dispassionately before he\ngave himself up for good to his old love, may have been increased by\nCamilla's apparent withdrawal of her claims. He felt mildly grateful\nto the Heavitree household in general for accepting him in this time\nof his affliction, but he could not admit to himself that they had a\nright to decide upon him in private conclave, and allot him either to\nthe one or to the other nuptials without consultation with himself.\nTo be swallowed up by Scylla he now recognised as his doom; but he\nthought he ought to be asked on which side of the gulf he would\nprefer to go down. The way in which Camilla spoke of him as a thing\nthat wasn't hers, but another's; and the way in which Arabella looked\nat him, as though he were hers and could never be another's, wounded\nhis manly pride. He had always understood that he might have his\nchoice, and he could not understand that the little mishap which had\nbefallen him in the Close was to rob him of that privilege.\n\nHe used to drink tea at Heavitree in those days. On one evening on\ngoing in he found himself alone with Arabella. \"Oh, Mr. Gibson,\" she\nsaid, \"we weren't sure whether you'd come. And mamma and Camilla have\ngone out to Mrs. Camadge's.\" Mr. Gibson muttered some word to the\neffect that he hoped he had kept nobody at home; and, as he did so,\nhe remembered that he had distinctly said that he would come on\nthis evening. \"I don't know that I should have gone,\" said Arabella,\n\"because I am not quite,--not quite myself at present. No, not ill;\nnot at all. Don't you know what it is, Mr. Gibson, to be,--to be,--to\nbe,--not quite yourself?\" Mr. Gibson said that he had very often felt\nlike that. \"And one can't get over it;--can one?\" continued Arabella.\n\"There comes a presentiment that something is going to happen, and\na kind of belief that something has happened, though you don't know\nwhat; and the heart refuses to be light, and the spirit becomes\nabashed, and the mind, though it creates new thoughts, will not\nsettle itself to its accustomed work. I suppose it's what the novels\nhave called Melancholy.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" said Mr. Gibson. \"But there's generally some cause\nfor it. Debt for instance--\"\n\n\"It's nothing of that kind with me. It's no debt, at least, that can\nbe written down in the figures of ordinary arithmetic. Sit down, Mr.\nGibson, and we will have some tea.\" Then, as she stretched forward to\nring the bell, he thought that he never in his life had seen anything\nso unshapely as that huge wen at the back of her head. \"Monstrum\nhorrendum, informe, ingens!\" He could not help quoting the words to\nhimself. She was dressed with some attempt at being smart, but her\nribbons were soiled, and her lace was tawdry, and the fabric of her\ndress was old and dowdy. He was quite sure that he would feel no\npride in calling her Mrs. Gibson, no pleasure in having her all to\nhimself at his own hearth. \"I hope we shall escape the bitterness of\nMiss Stanbury's tongue if we drink tea t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate,\" she said, with\nher sweetest smile.\n\n\"I don't suppose she'll know anything about it.\"\n\n\"She knows about everything, Mr. Gibson. It's astonishing what she\nknows. She has eyes and ears everywhere. I shouldn't care, if she\ndidn't see and hear so very incorrectly. I'm told now that she\ndeclares--; but it doesn't signify.\"\n\n\"Declares what?\" asked Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"Never mind. But wasn't it odd how all Exeter believed that you were\ngoing to be married in that house, and to live there all the rest of\nyour life, and be one of Miss Stanbury's slaves. I never believed\nit, Mr. Gibson.\" This she said with a sad smile, that ought to have\nbrought him on his knees, in spite of the chignon.\n\n\"One can't help these things,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"I never could have believed it;--not even if you had not given me an\nassurance so solemn, and so sweet, that there was nothing in it.\" The\npoor man had given the assurance, and could not deny the solemnity\nand the sweetness. \"That was a happy moment for us, Mr. Gibson;\nbecause, though we never believed it, when it was dinned into our\nears so frequently, when it was made such a triumph in the Close, it\nwas impossible not to fear that there might be something in it.\" He\nfelt that he ought to make some reply, but he did not know what to\nsay. He was thoroughly ashamed of the lie he had told, but he could\nnot untell it. \"Camilla reproached me afterwards for asking you,\"\nwhispered Arabella, in her softest, tenderest voice. \"She said\nthat it was unmaidenly. I hope you did not think it unmaidenly, Mr.\nGibson?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no;--not at all,\" said he.\n\nArabella French was painfully alive to the fact that she must do\nsomething. She had her fish on the hook; but of what use is a fish\non your hook, if you cannot land him? When could she have a better\nopportunity than this of landing the scaly darling out of the fresh\nand free waters of his bachelor stream, and sousing him into the pool\nof domestic life, to be ready there for her own household purposes?\n\"I had known you so long, Mr. Gibson,\" she said, \"and had valued your\nfriendship so--so deeply.\" As he looked at her he could see nothing\nbut the shapeless excrescence to which his eyes had been so painfully\ncalled by Miss Stanbury's satire. It is true that he had formerly\nbeen very tender with her, but she had not then carried about with\nher that distorted monster. He did not believe himself to be at all\nbound by anything which had passed between them in circumstances\nso very different. But yet he ought to say something. He ought to\nhave said something; but he said nothing. She was patient, however,\nvery patient; and she went on playing him with her hook. \"I am so\nglad that I did not go out to-night with mamma. It has been such a\npleasure to me to have this conversation with you. Camilla, perhaps,\nwould say that I am--unmaidenly.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"That is all that I care for, Mr. Gibson. If you acquit me, I do\nnot mind who accuses. I should not like to suppose that you thought\nme unmaidenly. Anything would be better than that; but I can throw\nall such considerations to the wind when true--true--friendship is\nconcerned. Don't you think that one ought, Mr. Gibson?\"\n\nIf it had not been for the thing at the back of her head, he would\nhave done it now. Nothing but that gave him courage to abstain.\nIt grew bigger and bigger, more shapeless, monstrous, absurd, and\nabominable, as he looked at it. Nothing should force upon him the\nnecessity of assisting to carry such an abortion through the world.\n\"One ought to sacrifice everything to friendship,\" said Mr. Gibson,\n\"except self-respect.\"\n\nHe meant nothing personal. Something special, in the way of an\nopinion, was expected of him; and, therefore, he had striven to\nsay something special. But she was in tears in a moment. \"Oh, Mr.\nGibson,\" she exclaimed; \"oh, Mr. Gibson!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Miss French?\"\n\n\"Have I lost your respect? Is it that that you mean?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Miss French.\"\n\n\"Do not call me Miss French, or I shall be sure that you condemn me.\nMiss French sounds so very cold. You used to call me--Bella.\" That\nwas quite true; but it was long ago, thought Mr. Gibson,--before the\nmonster had been attached. \"Will you not call me Bella now?\"\n\nHe thought that he had rather not; and yet, how was he to avoid it?\nOn a sudden he became very crafty. Had it not been for the sharpness\nof his mother wit, he would certainly have been landed at that\nmoment. \"As you truly observed just now,\" he said, \"the tongues\nof people are so malignant. There are little birds that hear\neverything.\"\n\n\"I don't care what the little birds hear,\" said Miss French, through\nher tears. \"I am a very unhappy girl;--I know that; and I don't care\nwhat anybody says. It is nothing to me what anybody says. I know what\nI feel.\" At this moment there was some dash of truth about her. The\nfish was so very heavy on hand that, do what she would, she could\nnot land him. Her hopes before this had been very low,--hopes that\nhad once been high; but they had been depressed gradually; and, in\nthe slow, dull routine of her daily life, she had learned to bear\ndisappointment by degrees, without sign of outward suffering, without\nconsciousness of acute pain. The task of her life had been weary,\nand the wished-for goal was ever becoming more and more distant;\nbut there had been still a chance, and she had fallen away into a\nlethargy of lessening expectation, from which joy, indeed, had been\nbanished, but in which there had been nothing of agony. Then had\ncome upon the whole house at Heavitree the great Stanbury peril, and,\narising out of that, had sprung new hopes to Arabella, which made her\nagain capable of all the miseries of a foiled ambition. She could\nagain be patient, if patience might be of any service; but in such a\ncondition an eternity of patience is simply suicidal. She was willing\nto work hard, but how could she work harder than she had worked. Poor\nyoung woman,--perishing beneath an incubus which a false idea of\nfashion had imposed on her!\n\n\"I hope I have said nothing that makes you unhappy,\" pleaded Mr.\nGibson. \"I'm sure I haven't meant it.\"\n\n\"But you have,\" she said. \"You make me very unhappy. You condemn me.\nI see you do. And if I have done wrong it has been all because-- Oh\ndear, oh dear, oh dear!\"\n\n\"But who says you have done wrong?\"\n\n\"You won't call me Bella,--because you say the little birds will hear\nit. If I don't care for the little birds, why should you?\"\n\nThere is no question more difficult than this for a gentleman to\nanswer. Circumstances do not often admit of its being asked by a lady\nwith that courageous simplicity which had come upon Miss French in\nthis moment of her agonising struggle; but nevertheless it is one\nwhich, in a more complicated form, is often put, and to which some\nreply, more or less complicated, is expected. \"If I, a woman, can\ndare, for your sake, to encounter the public tongue, will you, a man,\nbe afraid?\" The true answer, if it could be given, would probably\nbe this; \"I am afraid, though a man, because I have much to lose\nand little to get. You are not afraid, though a woman, because you\nhave much to get and little to lose.\" But such an answer would be\nuncivil, and is not often given. Therefore men shuffle and lie, and\ntell themselves that in love,--love here being taken to mean all\nantenuptial contests between man and woman,--everything is fair. Mr.\nGibson had the above answer in his mind, though he did not frame\nit into words. He was neither sufficiently brave nor sufficiently\ncruel to speak to her in such language. There was nothing for him,\ntherefore, but that he must shuffle and lie.\n\n\"I only meant,\" said he, \"that I would not for worlds do anything to\nmake you uneasy.\"\n\nShe did not see how she could again revert to the subject of her own\nChristian name. She had made her little tender, loving request, and\nit had been refused. Of course she knew that it had been refused as a\nmatter of caution. She was not angry with him because of his caution,\nas she had expected him to be cautious. The barriers over which\nshe had to climb were no more than she had expected to find in her\nway;--but they were so very high and so very difficult! Of course she\nwas aware that he would escape if he could. She was not angry with\nhim on that account. Anger could not have helped her. Indeed, she did\nnot price herself highly enough to make her feel that she would be\njustified in being angry. It was natural enough that he shouldn't\nwant her. She knew herself to be a poor, thin, vapid, tawdry\ncreature, with nothing to recommend her to any man except a sort\nof second-rate, provincial-town fashion which,--infatuated as she\nwas,--she attributed in a great degree to the thing she carried on\nher head. She knew nothing. She could do nothing. She possessed\nnothing. She was not angry with him because he so evidently wished to\navoid her. But she thought that if she could only be successful she\nwould be good and loving and obedient,--and that it was fair for her\nat any rate to try. Each created animal must live and get its food\nby the gifts which the Creator has given to it, let those gifts be\nas poor as they may,--let them be even as distasteful as they may to\nother members of the great created family. The rat, the toad, the\nslug, the flea, must each live according to its appointed mode of\nexistence. Animals which are parasites by nature can only live by\nattaching themselves to life that is strong. To Arabella Mr. Gibson\nwould be strong enough, and it seemed to her that if she could fix\nherself permanently upon his strength, that would be her proper\nmode of living. She was not angry with him because he resisted\nthe attempt, but she had nothing of conscience to tell her that\nshe should spare him as long as there remained to her a chance of\nsuccess. And should not her plea of excuse, her justification be\nadmitted? There are tormentors as to which no man argues that they\nare iniquitous, though they be very troublesome. He either rids\nhimself of them, or suffers as quiescently as he may.\n\n\"We used to be such--great--friends,\" she said, still crying, \"and I\nam afraid you don't like me a bit now.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do;--I have always liked you. But--\"\n\n\"But what? Do tell me what the but means. I will do anything that you\nbid me.\"\n\nThen it occurred to him that if, after such a promise, he were to\nconfide to her his feeling that the chignon which she wore was ugly\nand unbecoming, she would probably be induced to change her mode of\nhead-dress. It was a foolish idea, because, had he followed it out,\nhe would have seen that compliance on her part in such a matter could\nonly be given with the distinct understanding that a certain reward\nshould be the consequence. When an unmarried gentleman calls upon an\nunmarried lady to change the fashion of her personal adornments, the\nunmarried lady has a right to expect that the unmarried gentleman\nmeans to make her his wife. But Mr. Gibson had no such meaning; and\nwas led into error by the necessity for sudden action. When she\noffered to do anything that he might bid her do, he could not take up\nhis hat and go away. She looked up into his face, expecting that he\nwould give her some order;--and he fell into the temptation that was\nspread for him.\n\n\"If I might say a word,--\" he began.\n\n\"You may say anything,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"If I were you I don't think--\"\n\n\"You don't think what, Mr. Gibson?\"\n\nHe found it to be a matter very difficult of approach. \"Do you know,\nI don't think the fashion that has come up about wearing your hair\nquite suits you,--not so well as the way you used to do it.\" She\nbecame on a sudden very red in the face, and he thought that she was\nangry. Vexed she was, but still, accompanying her vexation, there\nwas a remembrance that she was achieving victory even by her own\nhumiliation. She loved her chignon; but she was ready to abandon even\nthat for him. Nevertheless she could not speak for a moment or two,\nand he was forced to continue his criticism. \"I have no doubt those\nthings are very becoming and all that, and I dare say they are\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Oh, very,\" she said.\n\n\"But there was a simplicity that I liked about the other.\"\n\nCould it be then that for the last five years he had stood aloof from\nher because she had arrayed herself in fashionable attire? She was\nstill very red in the face, still suffering from wounded vanity,\nstill conscious of that soreness which affects us all when we are\nmade to understand that we are considered to have failed there, where\nwe have most thought that we excelled. But her womanly art enabled\nher quickly to conceal the pain. \"I have made a promise,\" she said,\n\"and you will find that I will keep it.\"\n\n\"What promise?\" asked Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"I said that I would do as you bade me, and so I will. I would have\ndone it sooner if I had known that you wished it. I would never have\nworn it at all if I had thought that you disliked it.\"\n\n\"I think that a little of them is very nice,\" said Mr. Gibson. Mr.\nGibson was certainly an awkward man. But there are men so awkward\nthat it seems to be their especial province to say always the very\nworst thing at the very worst moment.\n\nShe became redder than ever as she was thus told of the hugeness of\nher favourite ornament. She was almost angry now. But she restrained\nherself, thinking perhaps of how she might teach him taste in days to\ncome as he was teaching her now. \"I will change it to-morrow,\" she\nsaid with a smile. \"You come and see to-morrow.\"\n\nUpon this he got up and took his hat and made his escape, assuring\nher that he would come and see her on the morrow. She let him go now\nwithout any attempt at further tenderness. Certainly she had gained\nmuch during the interview. He had as good as told her in what had\nbeen her offence, and of course, when she had remedied that offence,\nhe could hardly refuse to return to her. She got up as soon as she\nwas alone, and looked at her head in the glass, and told herself that\nthe pity would be great. It was not that the chignon was in itself\na thing of beauty, but that it imparted so unmistakable an air of\nfashion! It divested her of that dowdiness which she feared above\nall things, and enabled her to hold her own among other young women,\nwithout feeling that she was absolutely destitute of attraction.\nThere had been a certain homage paid to it, which she had recognised\nand enjoyed. But it was her ambition to hold her own, not among\nyoung women, but among clergymen's wives, and she would certainly\nobey his orders. She could not make the attempt now because of the\ncomplications; but she certainly would make it before she laid her\nhead on the pillow,--and would explain to Camilla that it was a\nlittle joke between herself and Mr. Gibson.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nMR. GIBSON IS PUNISHED.\n\n\nMiss Stanbury was divine in her wrath, and became more and more so\ndaily as new testimony reached her of dishonesty on the part of\nthe Frenches and of treachery on the part of Mr. Gibson. And these\npeople, so empty, so vain, so weak, were getting the better of her,\nwere conquering her, were robbing her of her prestige and her ancient\nglory, simply because she herself was too generous to speak out and\ntell the truth! There was a martyrdom to her in this which was almost\nunendurable.\n\nNow there came to her one day at luncheon time,--on the day\nsucceeding that on which Miss French had promised to sacrifice her\nchignon,--a certain Mrs. Clifford from Budleigh Salterton, to whom\nshe was much attached. Perhaps the distance of Budleigh Salterton\nfrom Exeter added somewhat to this affection, so that Mrs. Clifford\nwas almost closer to our friend's heart even than Mrs. MacHugh, who\nlived just at the other end of the cathedral. And in truth Mrs.\nClifford was a woman more serious in her mode of thought than Mrs.\nMacHugh, and one who had more in common with Miss Stanbury than that\nother lady. Mrs. Clifford had been a Miss Noel of Doddiscombe Leigh,\nand she and Miss Stanbury had been engaged to be married at the same\ntime,--each to a man of fortune. One match had been completed in the\nordinary course of matches. What had been the course of the other we\nalready know. But the friendship had been maintained on very close\nterms. Mrs. MacHugh was a Gallio at heart, anxious chiefly to remove\nfrom herself,--and from her friends also,--all the troubles of life,\nand make things smooth and easy. She was one who disregarded great\nquestions; who cared little or nothing what people said of her; who\nconsidered nothing worth the trouble of a fight;--Epicuri de grege\nporca. But there was nothing swinish about Mrs. Clifford of Budleigh\nSalterton. She took life thoroughly in earnest. She was a Tory who\nsorrowed heartily for her country, believing that it was being\nbrought to ruin by the counsels of evil men. She prayed daily to\nbe delivered from dissenters, radicals, and wolves in sheep's\nclothing,--by which latter bad name she meant especially a certain\nleading politician of the day who had, with the cunning of the\ndevil, tempted and perverted the virtue of her own political friends.\nAnd she was one who thought that the slightest breath of scandal\non a young woman's name should be stopped at once. An antique,\npure-minded, anxious, self-sacrificing matron was Mrs. Clifford, and\nvery dear to the heart of Miss Stanbury.\n\nAfter lunch was over on the day in question Mrs. Clifford got Miss\nStanbury into some closet retirement, and there spoke her mind as\nto the things which were being said. It had been asserted in her\npresence by Camilla French that she, Camilla, was authorised by Mr.\nGibson to declare that he had never thought of proposing to Dorothy\nStanbury, and that Miss Stanbury had been \"labouring under some\nstrange misapprehension in the matter.\" \"Now, my dear, I don't care\nvery much for the young lady in question,\" said Mrs. Clifford,\nalluding to Camilla French.\n\n\"Very little, indeed, I should think,\" said Miss Stanbury, with a\nshake of her head.\n\n\"Quite true, my dear,--but that does not make the words out of her\nmouth the less efficacious for evil. She clearly insinuated that you\nhad endeavoured to make up a match between this gentleman and your\nniece, and that you had failed.\" So much was at least true. Miss\nStanbury felt this, and felt also that she could not explain the\ntruth, even to her dear old friend. In the midst of her divine wrath\nshe had acknowledged to herself that she had brought Mr. Gibson into\nhis difficulty, and that it would not become her to tell any one\nof his failure. And in this matter she did not herself accuse Mr.\nGibson. She believed that the lie originated with Camilla French, and\nit was against Camilla that her wrath raged the fiercest.\n\n\"She is a poor, mean, disappointed thing,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Very probably;--but I think I should ask her to hold her tongue\nabout Miss Dorothy,\" said Mrs. Clifford.\n\nThe consultation in the closet was carried on for about half-an-hour,\nand then Miss Stanbury put on her bonnet and shawl and descended into\nMrs. Clifford's carriage. The carriage took the Heavitree road, and\ndeposited Miss Stanbury at the door of Mrs. French's house. The walk\nhome from Heavitree would be nothing, and Mrs. Clifford proceeded on\nher way, having given this little help in counsel and conveyance to\nher friend. Mrs. French was at home, and Miss Stanbury was shown up\ninto the room in which the three ladies were sitting.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Miss Stanbury visits the Frenches.]\n\n\nThe reader will doubtless remember the promise which Arabella had\nmade to Mr. Gibson. That promise she had already fulfilled,--to the\namazement of her mother and sister;--and when Miss Stanbury entered\nthe room the elder daughter of the family was seen without her\naccustomed head-gear. If the truth is to be owned, Miss Stanbury gave\nthe poor young woman no credit for her new simplicity, but put down\nthe deficiency to the charge of domestic slatternliness. She was\nunjust enough to declare afterwards that she had found Arabella\nFrench only half dressed at between three and four o'clock in the\nafternoon! From which this lesson may surely be learned,--that though\nthe way down Avernus may be, and customarily is, made with great\ncelerity, the return journey, if made at all, must be made slowly. A\nyoung woman may commence in chignons by attaching any amount of an\nedifice to her head; but the reduction should be made by degrees.\nArabella's edifice had, in Miss Stanbury's eyes, been the ugliest\nthing in art that she had known; but, now, its absence offended her,\nand she most untruly declared that she had come upon the young woman\nin the middle of the day just out of her bed-room and almost in her\ndressing-gown.\n\nAnd the whole French family suffered a diminution of power from the\nstrange phantasy which had come upon Arabella. They all felt, in\nsight of the enemy, that they had to a certain degree lowered their\nflag. One of the ships, at least, had shown signs of striking,\nand this element of weakness made itself felt through the whole\nfleet. Arabella, herself, when she saw Miss Stanbury, was painfully\nconscious of her head, and wished that she had postponed the\noperation till the evening. She smiled with a faint watery smile, and\nwas aware that something ailed her.\n\nThe greetings at first were civil, but very formal, as are those\nbetween nations which are nominally at peace, but which are waiting\nfor a sign at which each may spring at the other's throat. In this\ninstance the Juno from the Close had come quite prepared to declare\nher casus belli as complete, and to fling down her gauntlet, unless\nthe enemy should at once yield to her everything demanded with an\nabject submission. \"Mrs. French,\" she said, \"I have called to-day\nfor a particular purpose, and I must address myself chiefly to Miss\nCamilla.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"I shall be delighted to hear anything from you, Miss Stanbury,\" said\nCamilla,--not without an air of bravado. Arabella said nothing, but\nshe put her hand up almost convulsively to the back of her head.\n\n\"I have been told to-day by a friend of mine, Miss Camilla,\" began\nMiss Stanbury, \"that you declared yourself, in her presence,\nauthorised by Mr. Gibson to make a statement about my niece Dorothy.\"\n\n\"May I ask who was your friend?\" demanded Mrs. French.\n\n\"It was Mrs. Clifford, of course,\" said Camilla. \"There is nobody\nelse would try to make difficulties.\"\n\n\"There need be no difficulty at all, Miss Camilla,\" said Miss\nStanbury, \"if you will promise me that you will not repeat the\nstatement. It can't be true.\"\n\n\"But it is true,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"What is true?\" asked Miss Stanbury, surprised by the audacity of the\ngirl.\n\n\"It is true that Mr. Gibson authorised us to state what I did state\nwhen Mrs. Clifford heard me.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\"\n\n\"Only this,--that people had been saying all about Exeter that he\nwas going to be married to a young lady, and that as the report was\nincorrect, and as he had never had the remotest idea in his mind of\nmaking the young lady his wife,--\" Camilla, as she said this, spoke\nwith a great deal of emphasis, putting forward her chin and shaking\nher head,--\"and as he thought it was uncomfortable both for the young\nlady and for himself, and as there was nothing in it the least in the\nworld,--nothing at all, no glimmer of a foundation for the report, it\nwould be better to have it denied everywhere. That is what I said;\nand we had authority from the gentleman himself. Arabella can say\nthe same, and so can mamma;--only mamma did not hear him.\" Nor had\nCamilla heard him, but that incident she did not mention.\n\nThe circumstances were, in Miss Stanbury's judgment, becoming very\nremarkable. She did not for a moment believe Camilla. She did not\nbelieve that Mr. Gibson had given to either of the Frenches any\njustification for the statement just made. But Camilla had been so\nmuch more audacious than Miss Stanbury had expected, that that lady\nwas for a moment struck dumb. \"I'm sure, Miss Stanbury,\" said Mrs.\nFrench, \"we don't want to give any offence to your niece,--very far\nfrom it.\"\n\n\"My niece doesn't care about it two straws,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"It\nis I that care. And I care very much. The things that have been said\nhave been altogether false.\"\n\n\"How false, Miss Stanbury?\" asked Camilla.\n\n\"Altogether false,--as false as they can be.\"\n\n\"Mr. Gibson must know his own mind,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"My dear, there's a little disappointment,\" said Miss French, \"and it\ndon't signify.\"\n\n\"There's no disappointment at all,\" said Miss Stanbury, \"and it does\nsignify very much. Now that I've begun, I'll go to the bottom of it.\nIf you say that Mr. Gibson told you to make these statements, I'll go\nto Mr. Gibson. I'll have it out somehow.\"\n\n\"You may have what you like out for us, Miss Stanbury,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"I don't believe Mr. Gibson said anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"That's civil,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"But why shouldn't he?\" asked Arabella.\n\n\"There were the reports, you know,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"And why shouldn't he deny them when there wasn't a word of truth\nin them?\" continued Camilla. \"For my part I think the gentleman is\nbound for the lady's sake to declare that there's nothing in it when\nthere is nothing in it.\" This was more than Miss Stanbury could bear.\nHitherto the enemy had seemed to have the best of it. Camilla was\nfiring broadside after broadside, as though she was assured of\nvictory. Even Mrs. French was becoming courageous; and Arabella was\nforgetting the place where her chignon ought to have been. \"I really\ndo not know what else there is for me to say,\" remarked Camilla, with\na toss of her head, and an air of impudence that almost drove poor\nMiss Stanbury frantic.\n\nIt was on her tongue to declare the whole truth, but she refrained.\nShe had schooled herself on this subject vigorously. She would not\nbetray Mr. Gibson. Had she known all the truth,--or had she believed\nCamilla French's version of the story,--there would have been no\nbetrayal. But looking at the matter with such knowledge as she had\nat present, she did not even yet feel herself justified in declaring\nthat Mr. Gibson had offered his hand to her niece, and had been\nrefused. She was, however, sorely tempted. \"Very well, ladies,\" she\nsaid. \"I shall now see Mr. Gibson, and ask him whether he did give\nyou authority to make such statements as you have been spreading\nabroad everywhere.\" Then the door of the room was opened, and in a\nmoment Mr. Gibson was among them. He was true to his promise, and had\ncome to see Arabella with her altered head-dress;--but he had come\nat this hour thinking that escape in the morning would be easier and\nquicker than it might have been in the evening. His mind had been\nfull of Arabella and her head-dress even up to the moment of his\nknocking at the door; but all that was driven out of his brain at\nonce when he saw Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Here is Mr. Gibson himself,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Gibson?\" said Miss Stanbury, with a very stately\ncourtesy. They had never met since the day on which he had been, as\nhe stated, turned out of Miss Stanbury's house. He now bowed to her;\nbut there was no friendly greeting, and the Frenches were able to\ncongratulate themselves on the apparent loyalty to themselves of\nthe gentleman who stood among them. \"I have come here, Mr. Gibson,\"\ncontinued Miss Stanbury, \"to put a small matter right in which you\nare concerned.\"\n\n\"It seems to me to be the most insignificant thing in the world,\"\nsaid Camilla.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"But it is not insignificant\nto me. Miss Camilla French has asserted publicly that you have\nauthorised her to make a statement about my niece Dorothy.\"\n\nMr. Gibson looked into Camilla's face doubtingly, inquisitively,\nalmost piteously. \"You had better let her go on,\" said Camilla. \"She\nwill make a great many mistakes, no doubt, but you had better let her\ngo on to the end.\"\n\n\"I have made no mistake as yet, Miss Camilla. She so asserted, Mr.\nGibson, in the hearing of a friend of mine, and she repeated the\nassertion here in this room to me just before you came in. She says\nthat you have authorised her to declare that--that--that,--I had\nbetter speak it out plainly at once.\"\n\n\"Much better,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"That you never entertained an idea of offering your hand to my\nniece.\" Miss Stanbury paused, and Mr. Gibson's jaw fell visibly. But\nhe was not expected to speak as yet; and Miss Stanbury continued her\naccusation. \"Beyond that, I don't want to mention my niece's name, if\nit can be avoided.\"\n\n\"But it can't be avoided,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"If you please, I will continue. Mr. Gibson will understand me.\nI will not, if I can help it, mention my niece's name again, Mr.\nGibson. But I still have that confidence in you that I do not think\nthat you would have made such a statement in reference to yourself\nand any young lady,--unless it were some young lady who had\nabsolutely thrown herself at your head.\" And in saying this she\npaused, and looked very hard at Camilla.\n\n\"That's just what Dorothy Stanbury has been doing,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"She has been doing nothing of the kind, and you know she hasn't,\"\nsaid Miss Stanbury, raising her arm as though she were going to\nstrike her opponent. \"But I am quite sure, Mr. Gibson, that you\nnever could have authorised these young ladies to make such an\nassertion publicly on your behalf. Whatever there may have been of\nmisunderstanding between you and me, I can't believe that of you.\"\nThen she paused for a reply. \"If you will be good enough to set us\nright on that point, I shall be obliged to you.\"\n\nMr. Gibson's position was one of great discomfort. He had given no\nauthority to any one to make such a statement. He had said nothing\nabout Dorothy Stanbury to Camilla; but he had told Arabella, when\nhard pressed by that lady, that he did not mean to propose to\nDorothy. He could not satisfy Miss Stanbury because he feared\nArabella. He could not satisfy the Frenches because he feared Miss\nStanbury. \"I really do not think,\" said he, \"that we ought to talk\nabout a young lady in this way.\"\n\n\"That's my opinion, too,\" said Camilla; \"but Miss Stanbury will.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. Miss Stanbury will,\" said that lady. \"Mr. Gibson,\nI insist upon it, that you tell me whether you did give any such\nauthority to Miss Camilla French, or to Miss French.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't answer her, if I were you,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"I really don't think this can do any good,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"And it is so very harassing to our nerves,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"Nerves! Pooh!\" exclaimed Miss Stanbury. \"Now, Mr. Gibson, I am\nwaiting for an answer.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Stanbury, I really think it better,--the situation\nis so peculiar, and, upon my word, I hardly know how not to give\noffence, which I wouldn't do for the world.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you won't answer my question?\" demanded\nMiss Stanbury.\n\n\"I really think that I had better hold my tongue,\" pleaded Mr.\nGibson.\n\n\"You are quite right, Mr. Gibson,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"Indeed, it is wisest,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"I don't see what else he can do,\" said Arabella.\n\nThen was Miss Stanbury driven altogether beyond her powers of\nendurance. \"If that be so,\" said she, \"I must speak out, though I\nshould have preferred to hold my tongue. Mr. Gibson did offer to my\nniece the week before last,--twice, and was refused by her. My niece,\nDorothy, took it into her head that she did not like him; and, upon\nmy word, I think she was right. We should have said nothing about\nthis,--not a word; but when these false assertions are made on Mr.\nGibson's alleged authority, and Mr. Gibson won't deny it, I must\ntell the truth.\" Then there was silence among them for a few seconds,\nand Mr. Gibson struggled hard, but vainly, to clothe his face in\na pleasant smile. \"Mr. Gibson, is that true?\" said Miss Stanbury.\nBut Mr. Gibson made no reply. \"It is as true as heaven,\" said Miss\nStanbury, striking her hand upon the table. \"And now you had better,\nall of you, hold your tongues about my niece, and she will hold her\ntongue about you. And as for Mr. Gibson,--anybody who wants him\nafter this is welcome to him for us. Good-morning, Mrs. French;\ngood-morning, young ladies.\" And so she stalked out of the room, and\nout of the house, and walked back to her house in the Close.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Arabella, as soon as the enemy was gone, \"I have got\nsuch a headache that I think I will go up-stairs.\"\n\n\"And I will go with you, dear,\" said Camilla.\n\nMr. Gibson, before he left the house, confided his secret to the\nmaternal ears of Mrs. French. He certainly had been allured into\nmaking an offer to Dorothy Stanbury, but was ready to atone for\nthis crime by marrying her daughter,--Camilla,--as soon as might\nbe convenient. He was certainly driven to make this declaration by\nintense cowardice,--not to excuse himself, for in that there could\nbe no excuse;--but how else should he dare to suggest that he might\nas well leave the house? \"Shall I tell the dear girl?\" asked Mrs.\nFrench. But Mr. Gibson requested a fortnight, in which to consider\nhow the proposition had best be made.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nMR. BROOKE BURGESS AFTER SUPPER.\n\n\nBrooke Burgess was a clerk in the office of the Ecclesiastical\nCommissioners in London, and as such had to do with things very\nsolemn, grave, and almost melancholy. He had to deal with the rents\nof episcopal properties, to correspond with clerical claimants,\nand to be at home with the circumstances of underpaid vicars and\nperpetual curates with much less than \u00c2\u00a3300 a-year; but yet he was\nas jolly and pleasant at his desk as though he were busied about\nthe collection of the malt tax, or wrote his letters to admirals\nand captains instead of to deans and prebendaries. Brooke Burgess\nhad risen to be a senior clerk, and was held in some respect in his\noffice; but it was not perhaps for the amount of work he did, nor yet\non account of the gravity of his demeanour, nor for the brilliancy of\nhis intellect. But if not clever, he was sensible; though he was not\na dragon of official virtue, he had a conscience;--and he possessed\nthose small but most valuable gifts by which a man becomes popular\namong men. And thus it had come to pass in all those battles as to\ncompetitive merit which had taken place in his as in other public\noffices, that no one had ever dreamed of putting a junior over\nthe head of Brooke Burgess. He was tractable, easy, pleasant, and\ntherefore deservedly successful. All his brother clerks called him\nBrooke,--except the young lads who, for the first year or two of\ntheir service, still denominated him Mr. Burgess.\n\n\"Brooke,\" said one of his juniors, coming into his room and standing\nbefore the fireplace with a cigar in his mouth, \"have you heard who\nis to be the new Commissioner?\"\n\n\"Colenso, to be sure,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"What a lark that would be. And I don't see why he shouldn't. But it\nisn't Colenso. The name has just come down.\"\n\n\"And who is it?\"\n\n\"Old Proudie, from Barchester.\"\n\n\"Why, we had him here years ago, and he resigned.\"\n\n\"But he's to come on again now for a spell. It always seems to me\nthat the bishops ain't a bit of use here. They only get blown up, and\nsnubbed, and shoved into corners by the others.\"\n\n\"You young reprobate,--to talk of shoving an archbishop into a\ncorner.\"\n\n\"Well,--don't they? It's only for the name of it they have them.\nThere's the Bishop of Broomsgrove;--he's always sauntering about the\nplace, looking as though he'd be so much obliged if somebody would\ngive him something to do. He's always smiling, and so gracious,--just\nas if he didn't feel above half sure that he had any right to be\nwhere he is, and he thought that perhaps somebody was going to kick\nhim.\"\n\n\"And so old Proudie is coming up again,\" said Brooke. \"It certainly\nis very much the same to us whom they send. He'll get shoved into a\ncorner, as you call it,--only that he'll go into the corner without\nany shoving.\" Then there came in a messenger with a card, and Brooke\nlearned that Hugh Stanbury was waiting for him in the strangers'\nroom. In performing the promise made to Dorothy, he had called upon\nher brother as soon as he was back in London, but had not found him.\nThis now was the return visit.\n\n\"I thought I was sure to find you here,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Pretty nearly sure from eleven till five,\" said Brooke. \"A hard\nstepmother like the Civil Service does not allow one much chance of\nrelief. I do get across to the club sometimes for a glass of sherry\nand a biscuit,--but here I am now, at any rate; and I'm very glad\nyou have come.\" Then there was some talk between them about affairs\nat Exeter; but as they were interrupted before half an hour was\nover their heads by a summons brought for Burgess from one of\nthe secretaries, it was agreed that they should dine together at\nBurgess's club on the following day. \"We can manage a pretty good\nbeef-steak,\" said Brooke, \"and have a fair glass of sherry. I don't\nthink you can get much more than that anywhere nowadays,--unless you\nwant a dinner for eight at three guineas a head. The magnificence of\nmen has become so intolerable now that one is driven to be humble in\none's self-defence.\" Stanbury assured his acquaintance that he was\nanything but magnificent in his own ideas, that cold beef and beer\nwas his usual fare, and at last allowed the clerk to wait upon the\nsecretary.\n\n\"I wouldn't have any other fellow to meet you,\" said Brooke as they\nsat at their dinners, \"because in this way we can talk over the dear\nold woman at Exeter. Yes, our fellow does make good soup, and it's\nabout all that he does do well. As for getting a potato properly\nboiled, that's quite out of the question. Yes, it is a good glass\nof sherry. I told you we'd a fairish tap of sherry on. Well, I was\nthere, backwards and forwards, for nearly six weeks.\"\n\n\"And how did you get on with the old woman?\"\n\n\"Like a house on fire,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"She didn't quarrel with you?\"\n\n\"No,--upon the whole she did not. I always felt that it was touch\nand go. She might or she might not. Every now and then she looked at\nme, and said a sharp word, as though it was about to come. But I had\ndetermined when I went there altogether to disregard that kind of\nthing.\"\n\n\"It's rather important to you,--is it not?\"\n\n\"You mean about her money?\"\n\n\"Of course, I mean about her money,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"It is important;--and so it was to you.\"\n\n\"Not in the same degree, or nearly so. And as for me, it was not on\nthe cards that we shouldn't quarrel. I am so utterly a Bohemian in\nall my ideas of life, and she is so absolutely the reverse, that not\nto have quarrelled would have been hypocritical on my part or on\nhers. She had got it into her head that she had a right to rule\nmy life; and, of course, she quarrelled with me when I made her\nunderstand that she should do nothing of the kind. Now, she won't\nwant to rule you.\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"She has taken you up,\" continued Stanbury, \"on altogether a\ndifferent understanding. You are to her the representative of a\nfamily to whom she thinks she owes the restitution of the property\nwhich she enjoys. I was simply a member of her own family, to which\nshe owes nothing. She thought it well to help one of us out of what\nshe regarded as her private purse, and she chose me. But the matter\nis quite different with you.\"\n\n\"She might have given everything to you, as well as to me,\" said\nBrooke.\n\n\"That's not her idea. She conceives herself bound to leave all she\nhas back to a Burgess, except anything she may save,--as she says,\noff her own back, or out of her own belly. She has told me so a score\nof times.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"I always told her that, let her do as she would, I should never ask\nany question about her will.\"\n\n\"But she hates us all like poison,--except me,\" said Brooke. \"I never\nknew people so absurdly hostile as are your aunt and my uncle Barty.\nEach thinks the other the most wicked person in the world.\"\n\n\"I suppose your uncle was hard upon her once.\"\n\n\"Very likely. He is a hard man,--and has, very warmly, all the\nfeelings of an injured man. I suppose my uncle Brooke's will was a\ncruel blow to him. He professes to believe that Miss Stanbury will\nnever leave me a shilling.\"\n\n\"He is wrong, then,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Oh yes;--he's wrong, because he thinks that that's her present\nintention. I don't know that he's wrong as to the probable result.\"\n\n\"Who will have it, then?\"\n\n\"There are ever so many horses in the race,\" said Brooke. \"I'm one.\"\n\n\"You're the favourite,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"For the moment I am. Then there's yourself.\"\n\n\"I've been scratched, and am altogether out of the betting.\"\n\n\"And your sister,\" continued Brooke.\n\n\"She's only entered to run for the second money; and, if she'll trot\nover the course quietly, and not go the wrong side of the posts,\nshe'll win that.\"\n\n\"She may do more than that. Then there's Martha.\"\n\n\"My aunt will never leave her money to a servant. What she may give\nto Martha would come from her own savings.\"\n\n\"The next is a dark horse, but one that wins a good many races of\nthis kind. He's apt to come in with a fatal rush at the end.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"The hospitals. When an old lady finds in her latter days that she\nhates everybody, and fancies that the people around her are all\nthinking of her money, she's uncommon likely to indulge herself in a\nlittle bit of revenge, and solace herself with large-handed charity.\"\n\n\"But she's so good a woman at heart,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"And what can a good woman do better than promote hospitals?\"\n\n\"She'll never do that. She's too strong. It's a maudlin sort of\nthing, after all, for a person to leave everything to a hospital.\"\n\n\"But people are maudlin when they're dying,\" said Brooke,--\"or even\nwhen they think they're dying. How else did the Church get the\nestates, of which we are now distributing so bountifully some of the\nlast remnants down at our office? Come into the next room, and we'll\nhave a smoke.\"\n\nThey had their smoke, and then they went at half-price to the play;\nand, after the play was over, they eat three or four dozen of oysters\nbetween them. Brooke Burgess was a little too old for oysters at\nmidnight in September; but he went through his work like a man. Hugh\nStanbury's powers were so great, that he could have got up and done\nthe same thing again, after he had been an hour in bed, without any\nserious inconvenience.\n\nBut, in truth, Brooke Burgess had still another word or two to say\nbefore he went to his rest. They supped somewhere near the Haymarket,\nand then he offered to walk home with Stanbury, to his chambers in\nLincoln's Inn. \"Do you know that Mr. Gibson at Exeter?\" he asked, as\nthey passed through Leicester Square.\n\n\"Yes; I knew him. He was a sort of tame-cat parson at my aunt's\nhouse, in my days.\"\n\n\"Exactly;--but I fancy that has come to an end now. Have you heard\nanything about him lately?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes I have,\" said Stanbury, feeling that dislike to speak\nof his sister which is common to most brothers when in company with\nother men.\n\n\"I suppose you've heard of it, and, as I was in the middle of it all,\nof course I couldn't but know all about it too. Your aunt wanted him\nto marry your sister.\"\n\n\"So I was told.\"\n\n\"But your sister didn't see it,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"So I understand,\" said Stanbury. \"I believe my aunt was exceedingly\nliberal, and meant to do the best she could for poor Dorothy; but, if\nshe didn't like him, I suppose she was right not to have him,\" said\nHugh.\n\n\"Of course she was right,\" said Brooke, with a good deal of\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"I believe Gibson to be a very decent sort of fellow,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"A mean, paltry dog,\" said Brooke. There had been a little\nwhisky-toddy after the oysters, and Mr. Burgess was perhaps moved to\na warmer expression of feeling than he might have displayed had he\ndiscussed this branch of the subject before supper. \"I knew from the\nfirst that she would have nothing to say to him. He is such a poor\ncreature!\"\n\n\"I always thought well of him,\" said Stanbury, \"and was inclined to\nthink that Dolly might have done worse.\"\n\n\"It is hard to say what is the worst a girl might do; but I think she\nmight do, perhaps, a little better.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Hugh.\n\n\"I think I shall go down, and ask her to take myself.\"\n\n\"Do you mean it in earnest?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Brooke. \"Of course, I hadn't a chance when I was there.\nShe told me--\"\n\n\"Who told you;--Dorothy?\"\n\n\"No, your aunt;--she told me that Mr. Gibson was to marry your\nsister. You know your aunt's way. She spoke of it as though the thing\nwere settled as soon as she had got it into her own head; and she was\nas hot upon it as though Mr. Gibson had been an archbishop. I had\nnothing to do then but to wait and see.\"\n\n\"I had no idea of Dolly being fought for by rivals.\"\n\n\"Brothers never think much of their sisters,\" said Brooke Burgess.\n\n\"I can assure you I think a great deal of Dorothy,\" said Hugh. \"I\nbelieve her to be as sweet a woman as God ever made. She hardly knows\nthat she has a self belonging to herself.\"\n\n\"I am sure she doesn't,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"She is a dear, loving, sweet-tempered creature, who is only too\nready to yield in all things.\"\n\n\"But she wouldn't yield about Gibson,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"How did she and my aunt manage?\"\n\n\"Your sister simply said she couldn't,--and then that she wouldn't. I\nnever thought from the first moment that she'd take that fellow. In\nthe first place he can't say boo to a goose.\"\n\n\"But Dolly wouldn't want a man to say--boo.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that, old fellow. At any rate I mean to try\nmyself. Now,--what'll the old woman say?\"\n\n\"She'll be pleased as Punch, I should think,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Either that;--or else she'll swear that she'll never speak another\nword to either of us. However, I shall go on with it.\"\n\n\"Does Dorothy know anything of this?\" asked Stanbury.\n\n\"Not a word,\" said Brooke. \"I came away a day or so after Gibson was\nsettled; and as I had been talked to all through the affair by both\nof them, I couldn't turn round and offer myself the moment he was\ngone. You won't object;--will you?\"\n\n\"Who; I?\" said Stanbury. \"I shall have no objection as long as Dolly\npleases herself. Of course you know that we haven't as much as a\nbrass farthing among us?\"\n\n\"That won't matter if the old lady takes it kindly,\" said Brooke.\nThen they parted, at the corner of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and Hugh as\nhe went up to his own rooms, reflected with something of wonderment\non the success of Dorothy's charms. She had always been the poor one\nof the family, the chick out of the nest which would most require\nassistance from the stronger birds; but it now appeared that she\nwould become the first among all the Stanburys. Wealth had first\nflowed down upon the Stanbury family from the will of old Brooke\nBurgess; and it now seemed probable that poor Dolly would ultimately\nhave the enjoyment of it all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nCAMILLA TRIUMPHANT.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nIt was now New Year's day, and there was some grief and perhaps more\nexcitement in Exeter,--for it was rumoured that Miss Stanbury lay\nvery ill at her house in the Close. But in order that our somewhat\nuneven story may run as smoothly as it may be made to do, the little\nhistory of the French family for the intervening months shall be told\nin this chapter, in order that it may be understood how matters were\nwith them when the tidings of Miss Stanbury's severe illness first\nreached their house at Heavitree.\n\nAfter that terrible scene in which Miss Stanbury had so dreadfully\nconfounded Mr. Gibson by declaring the manner in which he had been\nrebuffed by Dorothy, the unfortunate clergyman had endeavoured to\nmake his peace with the French family by assuring the mother that in\nvery truth it was the dearest wish of his heart to make her daughter\nCamilla his wife. Mrs. French, who had ever been disposed to favour\nArabella's ambition, well knowing its priority and ancient right,\nand who of late had been taught to consider that even Camilla had\nconsented to waive any claim that she might have once possessed,\ncould not refrain from the expression of some surprise. That he\nshould be recovered at all out of the Stanbury clutches was very\nmuch to Mrs. French,--was so much that, had time been given her for\nconsideration, she would have acknowledged to herself readily that\nthe property had best be secured at once to the family, without\nincurring that amount of risk which must unquestionably attend any\nattempt on her part to direct Mr. Gibson's purpose hither or thither.\nBut the proposition came so suddenly that time was not allowed to her\nto be altogether wise. \"I thought it was poor Bella,\" she said, with\nsomething of a piteous whine in her voice. At the moment Mr. Gibson\nwas so humble, that he was half inclined to give way even on that\nhead. He felt himself to have been brought so low in the market by\nthat terrible story of Miss Stanbury's,--which he had been unable\neither to contradict or to explain,--that there was but little power\nof fighting left in him. He was, however, just able to speak a word\nfor himself, and that sufficed. \"I hope there has been no mistake,\"\nhe said; \"but really it is Camilla that has my heart.\" Mrs. French\nmade no rejoinder to this. It was so much to her to know that Mr.\nGibson's heart was among them at all after what had occurred in\nthe Close, that she acknowledged to herself after that moment of\nreflection that Arabella must be sacrificed for the good of the\nfamily interests. Poor, dear, loving, misguided, and spiritless\nmother! She would have given the blood out of her bosom to get\nhusbands for her daughters, though it was not of her own experience\nthat she had learned that of all worldly goods a husband is the best.\nBut it was the possession which they had from their earliest years\nthought of acquiring, which they first expected, for which they had\nthen hoped, and afterwards worked and schemed and striven with every\nenergy,--and as to which they had at last almost despaired. And now\nArabella's fire had been rekindled with a new spark, which, alas,\nwas to be quenched so suddenly! \"And am I to tell them?\" asked\nMrs. French, with a tremor in her voice. To this, however, Mr.\nGibson demurred. He said that for certain reasons he should like a\nfortnight's grace; and that at the end of the fortnight he would\nbe prepared to speak. The interval was granted without further\nquestions, and Mr. Gibson was allowed to leave the house.\n\nAfter that Mrs. French was not very comfortable at home. As soon as\nMr. Gibson had departed, Camilla at once returned to her mother and\ndesired to know what had taken place. Was it true that the perjured\nman had proposed to that young woman in the Close? Mrs. French was\nnot clever at keeping a secret, and she could not keep this by her\nown aid. She told all that happened to Camilla, and between them\nthey agreed that Arabella should be kept in ignorance till the fatal\nfortnight should have passed. When Camilla was interrogated as to\nher own purpose, she said she should like a day to think of it. She\ntook the twenty-four hours, and then made the following confession\nof her passion to her mother. \"You see, mamma, I always liked Mr.\nGibson,--always.\"\n\n\"So did Arabella, my dear,--before you thought of such things.\"\n\n\"I dare say that may be true, mamma; but that is not my fault. He\ncame here among us on such sweetly intimate terms that the feeling\ngrew up with me before I knew what it meant. As to any idea of\ncutting out Arabella, my conscience is quite clear. If I thought\nthere had been anything really between them I would have gone\nanywhere,--to the top of a mountain,--rather than rob my sister of a\nheart that belonged to her.\"\n\n\"He has been so slow about it,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Camilla. \"Gentlemen have to be\nslow, I suppose, when they think of their incomes. He only got St.\nPeter's-cum-Pumpkin three years ago, and didn't know for the first\nyear whether he could hold that and the minor canonry together. Of\ncourse a gentleman has to think of these things before he comes\nforward.\"\n\n\"My dear, he has been very backward.\"\n\n\"If I'm to be Mrs. Gibson, mamma, I beg that I mayn't hear anything\nsaid against him. Then there came all this about that young woman;\nand when I saw that Arabella took on so,--which I must say was very\nabsurd,--I'm sure I put myself out of the way entirely. If I'd buried\nmyself under the ground I couldn't have done it more. And it's my\nbelief that what I've said, all for Arabella's sake, has put the old\nwoman into such a rage that it has made a quarrel between him and the\nniece; otherwise that wouldn't be off. I don't believe a word of her\nrefusing him, and never shall. Is it in the course of things, mamma?\"\nMrs. French shook her head. \"Of course not. Then when you question\nhim,--very properly,--he says that he's devoted to--poor me. If I was\nto refuse him, he wouldn't put up with Bella.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"He hates Bella. I've known it all along, though I wouldn't say\nso. If I were to sacrifice myself ever so it wouldn't be of any\ngood,--and I shan't do it.\" In this way the matter was arranged.\n\nAt the end of the fortnight, however, Mr. Gibson did not come,--nor\nat the end of three weeks. Inquiries had of course been made, and it\nwas ascertained that he had gone into Cornwall for a parson's holiday\nof thirteen days. That might be all very well. A man might want the\nrecruiting vigour of some change of air after such scenes as those\nMr. Gibson had gone through with the Stanburys, and before his\nproposed encounter with new perils. And he was a man so tied by the\nleg that his escape could not be for any long time. He was back\non the appointed Sunday, and on the Wednesday Mrs. French, under\nCamilla's instruction, wrote to him a pretty little note. He replied\nthat he would be with her on the Saturday. It would then be nearly\nfour weeks after the great day with Miss Stanbury, but no one would\nbe inclined to quarrel with so short a delay as that. Arabella in the\nmeantime had become fidgety and unhappy. She seemed to understand\nthat something was expected, being quite unable to guess what that\nsomething might be. She was true throughout these days to the\nsimplicity of head-gear which Mr. Gibson had recommended to her,\nand seemed in her questions to her mother and to Camilla to be more\nfearful of Dorothy Stanbury than of any other enemy. \"Mamma, I think\nyou ought to tell her,\" said Camilla more than once. But she had not\nbeen told when Mr. Gibson came on the Saturday. It may truly be said\nthat the poor mother's pleasure in the prospects of one daughter was\naltogether destroyed by the anticipation of the other daughter's\nmisery. Had Mr. Gibson made Dorothy Stanbury his wife they could\nhave all comforted themselves together by the heat of their joint\nanimosity.\n\nHe came on the Saturday, and it was so managed that he was closeted\nwith Camilla before Arabella knew that he was in the house. There\nwas a quarter of an hour during which his work was easy, and perhaps\npleasant. When he began to explain his intention, Camilla, with the\nutmost frankness, informed him that her mother had told her all about\nit. Then she turned her face on one side and put her hand in his; he\ngot his arm round her waist, gave her a kiss, and the thing was done.\nCamilla was fully resolved that after such a betrothal it should not\nbe undone. She had behaved with sisterly forbearance, and would not\nnow lose the reward of virtue. Not a word was said of Arabella at\nthis interview till he was pressed to come and drink tea with them\nall that night. He hesitated a moment; and then Camilla declared,\nwith something perhaps of imperious roughness in her manner, that he\nhad better face it all at once. \"Mamma will tell her, and she will\nunderstand,\" said Camilla. He hesitated again, but at last promised\nthat he would come.\n\nWhilst he was yet in the house Mrs. French had told the whole story\nto her poor elder daughter. \"What is he doing with Camilla?\" Arabella\nhad asked with feverish excitement.\n\n\"Bella, darling;--don't you know?\" said the mother.\n\n\"I know nothing. Everybody keeps me in the dark, and I am badly used.\nWhat is it that he is doing?\" Then Mrs. French tried to take the\npoor young woman in her arms, but Arabella would not submit to be\nembraced. \"Don't!\" she exclaimed. \"Leave me alone. Nobody likes me,\nor cares a bit about me! Why is Cammy with him there, all alone?\"\n\n\"I suppose he is asking her--to be--his wife.\" Then Arabella threw\nherself in despair upon the bed, and wept without any further attempt\nat control over her feelings. It was a death-blow to her last hope,\nand all the world, as she looked upon the world then, was over for\nher. \"If I could have arranged it the other way, you know that I\nwould,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Arabella, jumping up, \"he shan't do it. He hasn't a\nright. And as for her,-- Oh, that she should treat me in this way!\nDidn't he tell me the other night, when he drank tea here with me\nalone--\"\n\n\"What did he tell you, Bella?\"\n\n\"Never mind. Nothing shall ever make me speak to him again;--not if\nhe married her three times over; nor to her. She is a nasty, sly,\ngood-for-nothing thing!\"\n\n\"But, Bella--\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me, mamma. There never was such a thing done before\nsince people--were--people at all. She has been doing it all the\ntime. I know she has.\"\n\nNevertheless Arabella did sit down to tea with the two lovers that\nnight. There was a terrible scene between her and Camilla; but\nCamilla held her own; and Arabella, being the weaker of the two, was\nvanquished by the expenditure of her own small energies. Camilla\nargued that as her sister's chance was gone, and as the prize had\ncome in her own way, there was no good reason why it should be lost\nto the family altogether, because Arabella could not win it. When\nArabella called her a treacherous vixen and a heartless, profligate\nhussy, she spoke out freely, and said that she wasn't going to be\nabused. A gentleman to whom she was attached had asked her for her\nhand, and she had given it. If Arabella chose to make herself a fool\nshe might,--but what would be the effect? Simply that all the world\nwould know that she, Arabella, was disappointed. Poor Bella at last\ngave way, put on her discarded chignon, and came down to tea. Mr.\nGibson was already in the room when she entered it. \"Arabella,\" he\nsaid, getting up to greet her, \"I hope you will congratulate me.\"\nHe had planned his little speech and his manner of making it, and\nhad wisely decided that in this way might he best get over the\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Oh yes;--of course,\" she said, with a little giggle, and then a sob,\nand then a flood of tears.\n\n\"Dear Bella feels these things so strongly,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"We have never been parted yet,\" said Camilla. Then Arabella tapped\nthe head of the sofa three or four times sharply with her knuckles.\nIt was the only protest against the reading of the scene which\nCamilla had given of which she was capable at that moment. After that\nMrs. French gave out the tea, Arabella curled herself upon the sofa\nas though she were asleep, and the two lovers settled down to proper\nlover-like conversation.\n\nThe reader may be sure that Camilla was not slow in making the fact\nof her engagement notorious through the city. It was not probably\ntrue that the tidings of her success had anything to do with Miss\nStanbury's illness; but it was reported by many that such was the\ncase. It was in November that the arrangement was made, and it\ncertainly was true that Miss Stanbury was rather ill about the same\ntime. \"You know, you naughty Lothario, that you did give her some\nground to hope that she might dispose of her unfortunate niece,\" said\nCamilla playfully to her own one, when this illness was discussed\nbetween them. \"But you are caught now, and your wings are clipped,\nand you are never to be a naughty Lothario again.\" The clerical\nDon Juan bore it all, awkwardly indeed, but with good humour, and\ndeclared that all his troubles of that sort were over, now and for\never. Nevertheless he did not name the day, and Camilla began to feel\nthat there might be occasion for a little more of that imperious\nroughness which she had at her command.\n\nNovember was nearly over and nothing had been fixed about the day.\nArabella never condescended to speak to her sister on the subject;\nbut on more than one occasion made some inquiry of her mother. And\nshe came to perceive, or to think that she perceived, that her mother\nwas still anxious on the subject. \"I shouldn't wonder if he wasn't\noff some day now,\" she said at last to her mother.\n\n\"Don't say anything so dreadful, Bella.\"\n\n\"It would serve Cammy quite right, and it's just what he's likely to\ndo.\"\n\n\"It would kill me,\" said the mother.\n\n\"I don't know about killing,\" said Arabella; \"it's nothing to what\nI've had to go through. I shouldn't pretend to be sorry if he were to\ngo to Hong-Kong to-morrow.\"\n\nBut Mr. Gibson had no idea of going to Hong-Kong. He was simply\ncarrying out his little scheme for securing the advantages of a \"long\nday.\" He was fully resolved to be married, and was contented to think\nthat his engagement was the best thing for him. To one or two male\nfriends he spoke of Camilla as the perfection of female virtue, and\nentertained no smallest idea of ultimate escape. But a \"long day\" is\noften a convenience. A bill at three months sits easier on a man than\none at sixty days; and a bill at six months is almost as little of a\nburden as no bill at all.\n\nBut Camilla was resolved that some day should be fixed. \"Thomas,\" she\nsaid to her lover one morning, as they were walking home together\nafter service at the cathedral, \"isn't this rather a fool's Paradise\nof ours?\"\n\n\"How a fool's Paradise?\" asked the happy Thomas.\n\n\"What I mean is, dearest, that we ought to fix something. Mamma is\ngetting uneasy about her own plans.\"\n\n\"In what way, dearest?\"\n\n\"About a thousand things. She can't arrange anything till our plans\nare made. Of course there are little troubles about money when people\nain't rich.\" Then it occurred to her that this might seem to be a\nplea for postponing rather than for hurrying the marriage, and she\nmended her argument. \"The truth is, Thomas, she wants to know when\nthe day is to be fixed, and I've promised to ask. She said she'd ask\nyou herself, but I wouldn't let her do that.\"\n\n\"We must think about it, of course,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"But, my dear, there has been plenty of time for thinking. What do\nyou say to January?\" This was on the last day of November.\n\n\"January!\" exclaimed Thomas, in a tone that betrayed no triumph. \"I\ncouldn't get my services arranged for in January.\"\n\n\"I thought a clergyman could always manage that for his marriage,\"\nsaid Camilla.\n\n\"Not in January. Besides, I was thinking you would like to be away in\nwarmer weather.\"\n\nThey were still in November, and he was thinking of postponing it\ntill the summer! Camilla immediately perceived how necessary it was\nthat she should be plain with him. \"We shall not have warm weather,\nas you call it, for a very long time, Thomas;--and I don't think that\nit would be wise to wait for the weather at all. Indeed, I've begun\nto get my things for doing it in the winter. Mamma said that she was\nsure January would be the very latest. And it isn't as though we had\nto get furniture or anything of that kind. Of course a lady shouldn't\nbe pressing.\" She smiled sweetly and leaned on his arm as she said\nthis. \"But I hate all girlish nonsense and that kind of thing. It is\nsuch a bore to be kept waiting. I'm sure there's nothing to prevent\nit coming off in February.\"\n\nThe 31st of March was fixed before they reached Heavitree, and\nCamilla went into her mother's house a happy woman. But Mr. Gibson,\nas he went home, thought that he had been hardly used. Here was a\ngirl who hadn't a shilling of money,--not a shilling till her mother\ndied,--and who already talked about his house, and his furniture,\nand his income, as if it were all her own! Circumstanced as she was,\nwhat right had she to press for an early day? He was quite sure that\nArabella would have been more discreet and less exacting. He was very\nangry with his dear Cammy as he went across the Close to his house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSHEWING WHAT HAPPENED DURING MISS STANBURY'S ILLNESS.\n\n\nIt was on Christmas-day that Sir Peter Mancrudy, the highest\nauthority on such matters in the west of England, was sent for to see\nMiss Stanbury; and Sir Peter had acknowledged that things were very\nserious. He took Dorothy on one side, and told her that Mr. Martin,\nthe ordinary practitioner, had treated the case, no doubt, quite\nwisely throughout; that there was not a word to be said against\nMr. Martin, whose experience was great, and whose discretion was\nundeniable; but, nevertheless,--at least it seemed to Dorothy that\nthis was the only meaning to be attributed to Sir Peter's words,--Mr.\nMartin had in this case taken one line of treatment, when he ought\nto have taken another. The plan of action was undoubtedly changed,\nand Mr. Martin became very fidgety, and ordered nothing without Sir\nPeter's sanction. Miss Stanbury was suffering from bronchitis, and a\ncomplication of diseases about her throat and chest. Barty Burgess\ndeclared to more than one acquaintance in the little parlour behind\nthe bank, that she would go on drinking four or five glasses of\nnew port wine every day, in direct opposition to Martin's request.\nCamilla French heard the report, and repeated it to her lover, and\nperhaps another person or two, with an expression of her assured\nconviction that it must be false,--at any rate, as regarded the\nfifth glass. Mrs. MacHugh, who saw Martha daily, was much frightened.\nThe peril of such a friend disturbed equally the repose and the\npleasures of her life. Mrs. Clifford was often at Miss Stanbury's\nbed-side,--and would have sat there reading for hours together,\nhad she not been made to understand by Martha that Miss Stanbury\npreferred that Miss Dorothy should read to her. The sick woman\nreceived the Sacrament weekly,--not from Mr. Gibson, but from the\nhands of another minor canon; and, though she never would admit her\nown danger, or allow others to talk to her of it, it was known to\nthem all that she admitted it to herself because she had, with much\npersonal annoyance, caused a codicil to be added to her will. \"As\nyou didn't marry that man,\" she said to Dorothy, \"I must change it\nagain.\" It was in vain that Dorothy begged her not to trouble herself\nwith such thoughts. \"That's trash,\" said Miss Stanbury, angrily. \"A\nperson who has it is bound to trouble himself about it. You don't\nsuppose I'm afraid of dying;--do you?\" she added. Dorothy answered\nher with some commonplace,--declaring how strongly they all expected\nto see her as well as ever. \"I'm not a bit afraid to die,\" said the\nold woman, wheezing, struggling with such voice as she possessed;\n\"I'm not afraid of it, and I don't think I shall die this time; but\nI'm not going to have mistakes when I'm gone.\" This was on the eve\nof the new year, and on the same night she asked Dorothy to write to\nBrooke Burgess, and request him to come to Exeter. This was Dorothy's\nletter:--\n\n\n   Exeter, 31st December, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. BURGESS,\n\n   Perhaps I ought to have written before, to say that Aunt\n   Stanbury is not as well as we could wish her; but, as I\n   know that you cannot very well leave your office, I have\n   thought it best not to say anything to frighten you. But\n   to-night Aunt herself has desired me to tell you that she\n   thinks you ought to know that she is ill, and that she\n   wishes you to come to Exeter for a day or two, if it is\n   possible. Sir Peter Mancrudy has been here every day\n   since Christmas-day, and I believe he thinks she may get\n   over it. It is chiefly in the throat;--what they call\n   bronchitis,--and she has got to be very weak with it, and\n   at the same time very liable to inflammation. So I know\n   that you will come if you can.\n\n   Yours very truly,\n\n   DOROTHY STANBURY.\n\n   Perhaps I ought to tell you that she had her lawyer here\n   with her the day before yesterday; but she does not seem\n   to think that she herself is in danger. I read to her a\n   good deal, and I think she is generally asleep; when I\n   stop she wakes, and I don't believe she gets any other\n   rest at all.\n\n\nWhen it was known in Exeter that Brooke Burgess had been sent for,\nthen the opinion became general that Miss Stanbury's days were\nnumbered. Questions were asked of Sir Peter at every corner of the\nstreet; but Sir Peter was a discreet man, who could answer such\nquestions without giving any information. If it so pleased God, his\npatient would die; but it was quite possible that she might live.\nThat was the tenor of Sir Peter's replies,--and they were read in any\nlight, according to the idiosyncracies of the reader. Mrs. MacHugh\nwas quite sure that the danger was over, and had a little game of\ncribbage on the sly with old Miss Wright;--for, during the severity\nof Miss Stanbury's illness, whist was put on one side in the vicinity\nof the Close. Barty Burgess was still obdurate, and shook his head.\nHe was of opinion that they might soon gratify their curiosity, and\nsee the last crowning iniquity of this wickedest of old women. Mrs.\nClifford declared that it was all in the hands of God; but that\nshe saw no reason why Miss Stanbury should not get about again. Mr.\nGibson thought that it was all up with his late friend; and Camilla\nwished that at their last interview there had been more of charity\non the part of one whom she had regarded in past days with respect\nand esteem. Mrs. French, despondent about everything, was quite\ndespondent in this case. Martha almost despaired, and already was\nburdened with the cares of a whole wardrobe of solemn funereal\nclothing. She was seen peering in for half-an-hour at the windows and\ndoorway of a large warehouse for the sale of mourning. Giles Hickbody\nwould not speak above his breath, and took his beer standing; but\nDorothy was hopeful, and really believed that her aunt would recover.\nPerhaps Sir Peter had spoken to her in terms less oracular than those\nwhich he used towards the public.\n\nBrooke Burgess came, and had an interview with Sir Peter, and to\nhim Sir Peter was under some obligation to speak plainly, as being\nthe person whom Miss Stanbury recognised as her heir. So Sir Peter\ndeclared that his patient might perhaps live, and perhaps might die.\n\"The truth is, Mr. Burgess,\" said Sir Peter, \"a doctor doesn't know\nso very much more about these things than other people.\" It was\nunderstood that Brooke was to remain three days in Exeter, and then\nreturn to London. He would, of course, come again if--if anything\nshould happen. Sir Peter had been quite clear in his opinion, that no\nimmediate result was to be anticipated,--either in the one direction\nor the other. His patient was doomed to a long illness; she might get\nover it, or she might succumb to it.\n\nDorothy and Brooke were thus thrown much together during these three\ndays. Dorothy, indeed, spent most of her hours beside her aunt's bed,\ninstigating sleep by the reading of a certain series of sermons in\nwhich Miss Stanbury had great faith; but nevertheless, there were\nsome minutes in which she and Brooke were necessarily together. They\neat their meals in each other's company, and there was a period in\nthe evening, before Dorothy began her night-watch in her aunt's room,\nat which she took her tea while Martha was nurse in the room above.\nAt this time of the day she would remain an hour or more with Brooke;\nand a great deal may be said between a man and a woman in an hour\nwhen the will to say it is there. Brooke Burgess had by no means\nchanged his mind since he had declared it to Hugh Stanbury under the\nmidnight lamps of Long Acre, when warmed by the influence of oysters\nand whisky toddy. The whisky toddy had in that instance brought out\ntruth and not falsehood,--as is ever the nature of whisky toddy and\nsimilar dangerous provocatives. There is no saying truer than that\nwhich declares that there is truth in wine. Wine is a dangerous\nthing, and should not be made the exponent of truth, let the truth\nbe good as it may; but it has the merit of forcing a man to show his\ntrue colours. A man who is a gentleman in his cups may be trusted to\nbe a gentleman at all times. I trust that the severe censor will not\nturn upon me, and tell me that no gentleman in these days is ever to\nbe seen in his cups. There are cups of different degrees of depth;\nand cups do exist, even among gentlemen, and seem disposed to hold\ntheir own let the censor be ever so severe. The gentleman in his cups\nis a gentleman always; and the man who tells his friend in his cups\nthat he is in love, does so because the fact has been very present\nto himself in his cooler and calmer moments. Brooke Burgess, who\nhad seen Hugh Stanbury on two or three occasions since that of the\noysters and toddy, had not spoken again of his regard for Hugh's\nsister; but not the less was he determined to carry out his plan and\nmake Dorothy his wife if she would accept him. But could he ask her\nwhile the old lady was, as it might be, dying in the house? He put\nthis question to himself as he travelled down to Exeter, and had told\nhimself that he must be guided for an answer by circumstances as\nthey might occur. Hugh had met him at the station as he started for\nExeter, and there had been a consultation between them as to the\npropriety of bringing about, or of attempting to bring about, an\ninterview between Hugh and his aunt. \"Do whatever you like,\" Hugh had\nsaid. \"I would go down to her at a moment's warning, if she should\nexpress a desire to see me.\"\n\nOn the first night of Brooke's arrival this question had been\ndiscussed between him and Dorothy. Dorothy had declared herself\nunable to give advice. If any message were given to her she would\ndeliver it to her aunt, but she thought that anything said to her\naunt on the subject had better come from Brooke himself. \"You\nevidently are the person most important to her,\" Dorothy said, \"and\nshe would listen to you when she would not let any one else say a\nword.\" Brooke promised that he would think of it; and then Dorothy\ntripped up to relieve Martha, dreaming nothing at all of that other\ndoubt to which the important personage downstairs was now subject.\nDorothy was, in truth, very fond of the new friend she had made; but\nit had never occurred to her that he might be a possible suitor to\nher. Her old conception of herself,--that she was beneath the notice\nof any man,--had only been partly disturbed by the absolute fact of\nMr. Gibson's courtship. She had now heard of his engagement with\nCamilla French, and saw in that complete proof that the foolish man\nhad been induced to offer his hand to her by the promise of her\naunt's money. If there had been a moment of exaltation,--a period in\nwhich she had allowed herself to think that she was, as other women,\ncapable of making herself dear to a man,--it had been but a moment.\nAnd now she rejoiced greatly that she had not acceded to the wishes\nof one to whom it was so manifest that she had not made herself in\nthe least dear.\n\nOn the second day of his visit, Brooke was summoned to Miss\nStanbury's room at noon. She was forbidden to talk, and during a\ngreat portion of the day could hardly speak without an effort; but\nthere would be half hours now and again in which she would become\nstronger than usual, at which time nothing that Martha and Dorothy\ncould say would induce her to hold her tongue. When Brooke came to\nher on this occasion he found her sitting up in bed with a great\nshawl round her; and he at once perceived she was much more like her\nown self than on the former day. She told him that she had been an\nold fool for sending for him, that she had nothing special to say\nto him, that she had made no alteration in her will in regard to\nhim,--\"except that I have done something for Dolly that will have to\ncome out of your pocket, Brooke.\" Brooke declared that too much could\nnot be done for a person so good, and dear, and excellent as Dorothy\nStanbury, let it come out of whose pocket it might. \"She is nothing\nto you, you know,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"She is a great deal to me,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"What is she?\" asked Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Oh;--a friend; a great friend.\"\n\n\"Well; yes. I hope it may be so. But she won't have anything that\nI haven't saved,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"There are two houses at St.\nThomas's; but I bought them myself, Brooke;--out of the income.\"\nBrooke could only declare that as the whole property was hers, to do\nwhat she liked with it as completely as though she had inherited it\nfrom her own father, no one could have any right to ask questions\nas to when or how this or that portion of the property had accrued.\n\"But I don't think I'm going to die yet, Brooke,\" she said. \"If it is\nGod's will, I am ready. Not that I'm fit, Brooke. God forbid that I\nshould ever think that. But I doubt whether I shall ever be fitter. I\ncan go without repining if He thinks best to take me.\" Then he stood\nup by her bedside, with his hand upon hers, and after some hesitation\nasked her whether she would wish to see her nephew Hugh. \"No,\" said\nshe, sharply. Brooke went on to say how pleased Hugh would have been\nto come to her. \"I don't think much of death-bed reconciliations,\"\nsaid the old woman, grimly. \"I loved him dearly, but he didn't love\nme, and I don't know what good we should do each other.\" Brooke\ndeclared that Hugh did love her; but he could not press the matter,\nand it was dropped.\n\nOn that evening at eight Dorothy came down to her tea. She had dined\nat the same table with Brooke that afternoon, but a servant had been\nin the room all the time and nothing had been said between them. As\nsoon as Brooke had got his tea he began to tell the story of his\nfailure about Hugh. He was sorry, he said, that he had spoken on the\nsubject, as it had moved Miss Stanbury to an acrimony which he had\nnot expected.\n\n\"She always declares that he never loved her,\" said Dorothy. \"She has\ntold me so twenty times.\"\n\n\"There are people who fancy that nobody cares for them,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"Indeed there are, Mr. Burgess; and it is so natural.\"\n\n\"Why natural?\"\n\n\"Just as it is natural that there should be dogs and cats that are\npetted and loved and made much of, and others that have to crawl\nthrough life as they can, cuffed and kicked and starved.\"\n\n\"That depends on the accident of possession,\" said Brooke.\n\n\"So does the other. How many people there are that don't seem to\nbelong to anybody,--and if they do, they're no good to anybody.\nThey're not cuffed exactly, or starved; but--\"\n\n\"You mean that they don't get their share of affection?\"\n\n\"They get perhaps as much as they deserve,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Because they're cross-grained, or ill-tempered, or disagreeable?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that.\"\n\n\"What then?\" asked Brooke.\n\n\"Because they're just nobodies. They are not anything particular to\nanybody, and so they go on living till they die. You know what I\nmean, Mr. Burgess. A man who is a nobody can perhaps make himself\nsomebody,--or, at any rate, he can try; but a woman has no means of\ntrying. She is a nobody, and a nobody she must remain. She has her\nclothes and her food, but she isn't wanted anywhere. People put up\nwith her, and that is about the best of her luck. If she were to die\nsomebody perhaps would be sorry for her, but nobody would be worse\noff. She doesn't earn anything or do any good. She is just there and\nthat's all.\"\n\nBrooke had never heard her speak after this fashion before, had never\nknown her to utter so many consecutive words, or to put forward any\nopinion of her own with so much vigour. And Dorothy herself, when she\nhad concluded her speech, was frightened by her own energy and grew\nred in the face, and showed very plainly that she was half ashamed\nof herself. Brooke thought that he had never seen her look so pretty\nbefore, and was pleased by her enthusiasm. He understood perfectly\nthat she was thinking of her own position, though she had entertained\nno idea that he would so read her meaning; and he felt that it was\nincumbent on him to undeceive her, and make her know that she was not\none of those women who are \"just there and that's all.\" \"One does see\nsuch a woman as that now and again,\" he said.\n\n\"There are hundreds of them,\" said Dorothy. \"And of course it can't\nbe helped.\"\n\n\"Such as Arabella French,\" said he, laughing.\n\n\"Well,--yes; if she is one. It is very easy to see the difference.\nSome people are of use and are always doing things. There are others,\ngenerally women, who have nothing to do, but who can't be got rid of.\nIt is a melancholy sort of feeling.\"\n\n\"You at least are not one of them.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to complain about myself,\" she said. \"I have got a\ngreat deal to make me happy.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you regard yourself as an Arabella French,\" said he.\n\n\"How angry Miss French would be if she heard you. She considers\nherself to be one of the reigning beauties of Exeter.\"\n\n\"She has had a very long reign, and dominion of that sort to be\nsuccessful ought to be short.\"\n\n\"That is spiteful, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"I don't feel spiteful against her, poor woman. I own I do not love\nCamilla. Not that I begrudge Camilla her present prosperity.\"\n\n\"Nor I either, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"She and Mr. Gibson will do very well together, I dare say.\"\n\n\"I hope they will,\" said Dorothy, \"and I do not see any reason\nagainst it. They have known each other a long time.\"\n\n\"A very long time,\" said Brooke. Then he paused for a minute,\nthinking how he might best tell her that which he had now resolved\nshould be told on this occasion. Dorothy finished her tea and got up\nas though she were about to go to her duty up-stairs. She had been as\nyet hardly an hour in the room, and the period of her relief was not\nfairly over. But there had come something of a personal flavour in\ntheir conversation which prompted her, unconsciously, to leave him.\nShe had, without any special indication of herself, included herself\namong that company of old maids who are born and live and die without\nthat vital interest in the affairs of life which nothing but family\nduties, the care of children, or at least of a husband, will give to\na woman. If she had not meant this she had felt it. He had understood\nher meaning, or at least her feeling, and had taken upon himself to\nassure her that she was not one of the company whose privations she\nhad endeavoured to describe. Her instinct rather than her reason put\nher at once upon her guard, and she prepared to leave the room. \"You\nare not going yet,\" he said.\n\n\"I think I might as well. Martha has so much to do, and she comes to\nme again at five in the morning.\"\n\n\"Don't go quite yet,\" he said, pulling out his watch. \"I know all\nabout the hours, and it wants twenty minutes to the proper time.\"\n\n\"There is no proper time, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"Then you can remain a few minutes longer. The fact is, I've got\nsomething I want to say to you.\"\n\nHe was now standing between her and the door, so that she could not\nget away from him; but at this moment she was absolutely ignorant of\nhis purpose, expecting nothing of love from him more than she would\nfrom Sir Peter Mancrudy. Her face had become flushed when she made\nher long speech, but there was no blush on it as she answered him\nnow. \"Of course, I can wait,\" she said, \"if you have anything to say\nto me.\"\n\n\"Well;--I have. I should have said it before, only that that other\nman was here.\" He was blushing now,--up to the roots of his hair, and\nfelt that he was in a difficulty. There are men, to whom such moments\nof their lives are pleasurable, but Brooke Burgess was not one of\nthem. He would have been glad to have had it done and over,--so that\nthen he might take pleasure in it.\n\n\"What man?\" asked Dorothy, in perfect innocence.\n\n\"Mr. Gibson, to be sure. I don't know that there is anybody else.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Gibson. He never comes here now, and I don't suppose he will\nagain. Aunt Stanbury is so very angry with him.\"\n\n\"I don't care whether he comes or not. What I mean is this. When I\nwas here before, I was told that you were going--to marry him.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't.\"\n\n\"How was I to know that, when you didn't tell me? I certainly did\nknow it after I came back from Dartmoor.\" He paused a moment, as\nthough she might have a word to say. She had no word to say, and\ndid not in the least know what was coming. She was so far from\nanticipating the truth, that she was composed and easy in her mind.\n\"But all that is of no use at all,\" he continued. \"When I was here\nbefore Miss Stanbury wanted you to marry Mr. Gibson; and, of course,\nI had nothing to say about it. Now I want you--to marry me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Burgess!\"\n\n\"Dorothy, my darling, I love you better than all the world. I do,\nindeed.\" As soon as he had commenced his protestations he became\nprofuse enough with them, and made a strong attempt to support them\nby the action of his hands. But she retreated from him step by step,\ntill she had regained her chair by the tea-table, and there she\nseated herself,--safely, as she thought; but he was close to her,\nover her shoulder, still continuing his protestations, offering up\nhis vows, and imploring her to reply to him. She, as yet, had not\nanswered him by a word, save by that one half-terrified exclamation\nof his name. \"Tell me, at any rate, that you believe me, when I\nassure you that I love you,\" he said. The room was going round with\nDorothy, and the world was going round, and there had come upon her\nso strong a feeling of the disruption of things in general, that she\nwas at the moment anything but happy. Had it been possible for her to\nfind that the last ten minutes had been a dream, she would at this\nmoment have wished that it might become one. A trouble had come upon\nher, out of which she did not see her way. To dive among the waters\nin warm weather is very pleasant; there is nothing pleasanter. But\nwhen the young swimmer first feels the thorough immersion of his\nplunge, there comes upon him a strong desire to be quickly out again.\nHe will remember afterwards how joyous it was; but now, at this\nmoment, the dry land is everything to him. So it was with Dorothy.\nShe had thought of Brooke Burgess as one of those bright ones of the\nworld, with whom everything is happy and pleasant, whom everybody\nloves, who may have whatever they please, whose lines have been laid\nin pleasant places. She thought of him as a man who might some day\nmake some woman very happy as his wife. To be the wife of such a man\nwas, in Dorothy's estimation, one of those blessed chances which come\nto some women, but which she never regarded as being within her own\nreach. Though she had thought much about him, she had never thought\nof him as a possible possession for herself; and now that he was\noffering himself to her, she was not at once made happy by his love.\nHer ideas of herself and of her life were all dislocated for the\nmoment, and she required to be alone, that she might set herself in\norder, and try herself all over, and find whether her bones were\nbroken. \"Say that you believe me,\" he repeated.\n\n\n   [Illustration: The world was going round with Dorothy.]\n\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" she whispered.\n\n\"I'll tell you what to say. Say at once that you will be my wife.\"\n\n\"I can't say that, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"Why not? Do you mean that you cannot love me?\"\n\n\"I think, if you please, I'll go up to Aunt Stanbury. It is time for\nme; indeed it is; and she will be wondering, and Martha will be put\nout. Indeed I must go up.\"\n\n\"And will you not answer me?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to say. You must give me a little time to\nconsider. I don't quite think you're serious.\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth!\" began Brooke.\n\n\"And I'm sure it would never do. At any rate, I must go now. I must,\nindeed.\"\n\nAnd so she escaped, and went up to her aunt's room, which she reached\nat ten minutes after her usual time, and before Martha had begun\nto be put out. She was very civil to Martha, as though Martha had\nbeen injured; and she put her hand on her aunt's arm, with a soft,\ncaressing, apologetic touch, feeling conscious that she had given\ncause for offence. \"What has he been saying to you?\" said her aunt,\nas soon as Martha had closed the door. This was a question which\nDorothy, certainly, could not answer. Miss Stanbury meant nothing\nby it,--nothing beyond a sick woman's desire that something of the\nconversation of those who were not sick should be retailed to her;\nbut to Dorothy the question meant so much! How should her aunt have\nknown that he had said anything? She sat herself down and waited,\ngiving no answer to the question. \"I hope he gets his meals\ncomfortably,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"I am sure he does,\" said Dorothy, infinitely relieved. Then, knowing\nhow important it was that her aunt should sleep, she took up the\nvolume of Jeremy Taylor, and, with so great a burden on her mind,\nshe went on painfully and distinctly with the second sermon on the\nMarriage Ring. She strove valiantly to keep her mind to the godliness\nof the discourse, so that it might be of some possible service to\nherself; and to keep her voice to the tone that might be of service\nto her aunt. Presently she heard the grateful sound which indicated\nher aunt's repose, but she knew of experience that were she to stop,\nthe sound and the sleep would come to an end also. For a whole hour\nshe persevered, reading the sermon of the Marriage Ring with such\nattention to the godly principles of the teaching as she could\ngive,--with that terrible burden upon her mind.\n\n\"Thank you;--thank you; that will do, my dear. Shut it up,\" said\nthe sick woman. \"It's time now for the draught.\" Then Dorothy moved\nquietly about the room, and did her nurse's work with soft hand, and\nsoft touch, and soft tread. After that her aunt kissed her, and bade\nher sit down and sleep.\n\n\"I'll go on reading, aunt, if you'll let me,\" said Dorothy. But\nMiss Stanbury, who was not a cruel woman, would have no more of the\nreading, and Dorothy's mind was left at liberty to think of the\nproposition that had been made to her. To one resolution she came\nvery quickly. The period of her aunt's illness could not be a proper\ntime for marriage vows, or the amenities of love-making. She did not\nfeel that he, being a man, had offended; but she was quite sure that\nwere she, a woman, the niece of so kind an aunt, the nurse at the\nbed-side of such an invalid,--were she at such a time to consent to\ntalk of love, she would never deserve to have a lover. And from this\nresolve she got great comfort. It would give her an excuse for making\nno more assured answer at present, and would enable her to reflect\nat leisure as to the reply she would give him, should he ever, by\nany chance, renew his offer. If he did not,--and probably he would\nnot,--then it would have been very well that he should not have been\nmade the victim of a momentary generosity. She had complained of the\ndulness of her life, and that complaint from her had produced his\nnoble, kind, generous, dear, enthusiastic benevolence towards her.\nAs she thought of it all,--and by degrees she took great pleasure in\nthinking of it,--her mind bestowed upon him all manner of eulogies.\nShe could not persuade herself that he really loved her, and yet she\nwas full at heart of gratitude to him for the expression of his love.\nAnd as for herself, could she love him? We who are looking on of\ncourse know that she loved him;--that from this moment there was\nnothing belonging to him, down to his shoe-tie, that would not be\ndear to her heart and an emblem so tender as to force a tear from\nher. He had already become her god, though she did not know it. She\nmade comparisons between him and Mr. Gibson, and tried to convince\nherself that the judgment, which was always pronounced very clearly\nin Brooke's favour, came from anything but her heart. And thus\nthrough the long watches of the night she became very happy, feeling\nbut not knowing that the whole aspect of the world was changed to her\nby those few words which her lover had spoken to her. She thought now\nthat it would be consolation enough to her in future to know that\nsuch a man as Brooke Burgess had once asked her to be the partner of\nhis life, and that it would be almost ungenerous in her to push her\nadvantage further and attempt to take him at his word. Besides, there\nwould be obstacles. Her aunt would dislike such a marriage for him,\nand he would be bound to obey her aunt in such a matter. She would\nnot allow herself to think that she could ever become Brooke's wife,\nbut nothing could rob her of the treasure of the offer which he had\nmade her. Then Martha came to her at five o'clock, and she went to\nher bed to dream for an hour or two of Brooke Burgess and her future\nlife.\n\nOn the next morning she met him at breakfast. She went down stairs\nlater than usual, not till ten, having hung about her aunt's room,\nthinking that thus she would escape him for the present. She would\nwait till he was gone out, and then she would go down. She did wait;\nbut she could not hear the front door, and then her aunt murmured\nsomething about Brooke's breakfast. She was told to go down, and she\nwent. But when on the stairs she slunk back to her own room, and\nstood there for awhile, aimless, motionless, not knowing what to do.\nThen one of the girls came to her, and told her that Mr. Burgess was\nwaiting breakfast for her. She knew not what excuse to make, and at\nlast descended slowly to the parlour. She was very happy, but had it\nbeen possible for her to have run away she would have gone.\n\n\"Dear Dorothy,\" he said at once. \"I may call you so,--may I not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And you will love me;--and be my own, own wife?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"I mean;--that is to say--\"\n\n\"Do you love me, Dorothy?\"\n\n\"Only think how ill Aunt Stanbury is, Mr. Burgess;--perhaps dying!\nHow can I have any thought now except about her? It wouldn't be\nright;--would it?\"\n\n\"You may say that you love me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Burgess, pray, pray don't speak of it now. If you do I must go\naway.\"\n\n\"But do you love me?\"\n\n\"Pray, pray don't, Mr. Burgess!\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be got from her during the whole day than\nthat. He told her in the evening that as soon as Miss Stanbury was\nwell, he would come again;--that in any case he would come again. She\nsat quite still as he said this, with a solemn face,--but smiling at\nheart, laughing at heart, so happy! When she got up to leave him, and\nwas forced to give him her hand, he seized her in his arms and kissed\nher. \"That is very, very wrong,\" she said, sobbing, and then ran to\nher room,--the happiest girl in all Exeter. He was to start early on\nthe following morning, and she knew that she would not be forced to\nsee him again. Thinking of him was so much pleasanter than seeing\nhim!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nMR. OUTHOUSE COMPLAINS THAT IT'S HARD.\n\n\nLife had gone on during the winter at St. Diddulph's Parsonage in a\ndull, weary, painful manner. There had come a letter in November from\nTrevelyan to his wife, saying that as he could trust neither her nor\nher uncle with the custody of his child, he should send a person\narmed with due legal authority, addressed to Mr. Outhouse, for the\nrecovery of the boy, and desiring that little Louis might be at once\nsurrendered to the messenger. Then of course there had arisen great\ntrouble in the house. Both Mrs. Trevelyan and Nora Rowley had learned\nby this time that, as regarded the master of the house, they were not\nwelcome guests at St. Diddulph's. When the threat was shewn to Mr.\nOuthouse, he did not say a word to indicate that the child should be\ngiven up. He muttered something, indeed, about impotent nonsense,\nwhich seemed to imply that the threat could be of no avail; but there\nwas none of that reassurance to be obtained from him which a positive\npromise on his part to hold the bairn against all comers would have\ngiven. Mrs. Outhouse told her niece more than once that the child\nwould be given to no messenger whatever; but even she did not give\nthe assurance with that energy which the mother would have liked.\n\"They shall drag him away from me by force if they do take him!\" said\nthe mother, gnashing her teeth. Oh, if her father would but come!\nFor some weeks she did not let the boy out of her sight; but when no\nmessenger had presented himself by Christmas time, they all began to\nbelieve that the threat had in truth meant nothing,--that it had been\npart of the ravings of a madman.\n\nBut the threat had meant something. Early on one morning in January\nMr. Outhouse was told that a person in the hall wanted to see him,\nand Mrs. Trevelyan, who was sitting at breakfast, the child being at\nthe moment up-stairs, started from her seat. The maid described the\nman as being \"All as one as a gentleman,\" though she would not go so\nfar as to say that he was a gentleman in fact. Mr. Outhouse slowly\nrose from his breakfast, went out to the man in the passage, and bade\nhim follow into the little closet that was now used as a study. It is\nneedless perhaps to say that the man was Bozzle.\n\n\"I dare say, Mr. Houthouse, you don't know me,\" said Bozzle. Mr.\nOuthouse, disdaining all complimentary language, said that he\ncertainly did not. \"My name, Mr. Houthouse, is Samuel Bozzle, and I\nlive at No. 55, Stony Walk, Union Street, Borough. I was in the Force\nonce, but I work on my own 'ook now.\"\n\n\"What do you want with me, Mr. Bozzle?\"\n\n\"It isn't so much with you, sir, as it is with a lady as is under\nyour protection; and it isn't so much with the lady as it is with her\ninfant.\"\n\n\"Then you may go away, Mr. Bozzle,\" said Mr. Outhouse, impatiently.\n\"You may as well go away at once.\"\n\n\"Will you please read them few lines, sir,\" said Mr. Bozzle. \"They\nis in Mr. Trewilyan's handwriting, which will no doubt be familiar\ncharacters,--leastways to Mrs. T., if you don't know the gent's\nfist.\" Mr. Outhouse, after looking at the paper for a minute, and\nconsidering deeply what in this emergency he had better do, did take\nthe paper and read it. The words ran as follows: \"I hereby give full\nauthority to Mr. Samuel Bozzle, of 55, Stony Walk, Union Street,\nBorough, to claim and to enforce possession of the body of my child,\nLouis Trevelyan; and I require that any person whatsoever who may\nnow have the custody of the said child, whether it be my wife or any\nof her friends, shall at once deliver him up to Mr. Bozzle, on the\nproduction of this authority.--LOUIS TREVELYAN.\" It may be explained\nthat before this document had been written there had been much\ncorrespondence on the subject between Bozzle and his employer. To\ngive the ex-policeman his due, he had not at first wished to meddle\nin the matter of the child. He had a wife at home who expressed an\nopinion with much vigour that the boy should be left with its mother,\nand that he, Bozzle, should he succeed in getting hold of the child,\nwould not know what to do with it. Bozzle was aware, moreover, that\nit was his business to find out facts, and not to perform actions.\nBut his employer had become very urgent with him. Mr. Bideawhile had\npositively refused to move in the matter; and Trevelyan, mad as he\nwas, had felt a disinclination to throw his affairs into the hands of\na certain Mr. Skint, of Stamford Street, whom Bozzle had recommended\nto him as a lawyer. Trevelyan had hinted, moreover, that if Bozzle\nwould make the application in person, that application, if not\nobeyed, would act with usefulness as a preliminary step for further\npersonal measures to be taken by himself. He intended to return\nto England for the purpose, but he desired that the order for the\nchild's rendition should be made at once. Therefore Bozzle had come.\nHe was an earnest man, and had now worked himself up to a certain\ndegree of energy in the matter. He was a man loving power, and\nspecially anxious to enforce obedience from those with whom he came\nin contact by the production of the law's mysterious authority. In\nhis heart he was ever tapping people on the shoulder, and telling\nthem that they were wanted. Thus, when he displayed his document to\nMr. Outhouse, he had taught himself at least to desire that that\ndocument should be obeyed.\n\nMr. Outhouse read the paper and turned up his nose at it. \"You had\nbetter go away,\" said he, as he thrust it back into Bozzle's hand.\n\n\"Of course I shall go away when I have the child.\"\n\n\"Psha!\" said Mr. Outhouse.\n\n\"What does that mean, Mr. Houthouse? I presume you'll not dispute the\npaternal parent's legal authority?\"\n\n\"Go away, sir,\" said Mr. Outhouse.\n\n\"Go away!\"\n\n\"Yes;--out of this house. It's my belief that you are a knave.\"\n\n\"A knave, Mr. Houthouse?\"\n\n\"Yes;--a knave. No one who was not a knave would lend a hand towards\nseparating a little child from its mother. I think you are a knave,\nbut I don't think you are fool enough to suppose that the child will\nbe given up to you.\"\n\n\"It's my belief that knave is hactionable,\" said Bozzle,--whose\nrespect, however, for the clergyman was rising fast. \"Would you mind\nringing the bell, Mr. Houthouse, and calling me a knave again before\nthe young woman?\"\n\n\"Go away,\" said Mr. Outhouse.\n\n\"If you have no objection, sir, I should be glad to see the lady\nbefore I goes.\"\n\n\"You won't see any lady here; and if you don't get out of my house\nwhen I tell you, I'll send for a real policeman.\" Then was Bozzle\nconquered; and, as he went, he admitted to himself that he had sinned\nagainst all the rules of his life in attempting to go beyond the\nlegitimate line of his profession. As long as he confined himself\nto the getting up of facts nobody could threaten him with a \"real\npoliceman.\" But one fact he had learned to-day. The clergyman of St.\nDiddulph's, who had been represented to him as a weak, foolish man,\nwas anything but that. Bozzle was much impressed in favour of Mr.\nOuthouse, and would have been glad to have done that gentleman a\nkindness had an opportunity come in his way.\n\n\"What does he want, Uncle Oliphant?\" said Mrs. Trevelyan at the foot\nof the stairs, guarding the way up to the nursery. At this moment the\nfront door had just been closed behind the back of Mr. Bozzle.\n\n\"You had better ask no questions,\" said Mr. Outhouse.\n\n\"But is it about Louis?\"\n\n\"Yes, he came about him.\"\n\n\"Well? Of course you must tell me, Uncle Oliphant. Think of my\ncondition.\"\n\n\"He had some stupid paper in his hand from your husband, but it meant\nnothing.\"\n\n\"He was the messenger, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was the messenger. But I don't suppose he expected to get\nanything. Never mind. Go up and look after the child.\" Then Mrs.\nTrevelyan returned to her boy, and Mr. Outhouse went back to his\npapers.\n\nIt was very hard upon him, Mr. Outhouse thought,--very hard. He\nwas threatened with an action now, and most probably would become\nsubject to one. Though he had been spirited enough in presence of the\nenemy, he was very much out of spirits at this moment. Though he had\nadmitted to himself that his duty required him to protect his wife's\nniece, he had never taken the poor woman to his heart with a loving,\ngenerous feeling of true guardianship. Though he would not give up\nthe child to Bozzle, he thoroughly wished that the child was out of\nhis house. Though he called Bozzle a knave and Trevelyan a madman,\nstill he considered that Colonel Osborne was the chief sinner, and\nthat Emily Trevelyan had behaved badly. He constantly repeated to\nhimself the old adage, that there was no smoke without fire; and\nlamented the misfortune that had brought him into close relation\nwith things and people that were so little to his taste. He sat for\nawhile, with a pen in his hand, at the miserable little substitute\nfor a library table which had been provided for him, and strove to\ncollect his thoughts and go on with his work. But the effort was in\nvain. Bozzle would be there, presenting his document, and begging\nthat the maid might be rung for, in order that she might hear him\ncalled a knave. And then he knew that on this very day his niece\nintended to hand him money, which he could not refuse. Of what use\nwould it be to refuse it now, after it had been once taken? As he\ncould not write a word, he rose and went away to his wife.\n\n\"If this goes on much longer,\" said he, \"I shall be in Bedlam.\"\n\n\"My dear, don't speak of it in that way!\"\n\n\"That's all very well. I suppose I ought to say that I like it. There\nhas been a policeman here who is going to bring an action against\nme.\"\n\n\"A policeman!\"\n\n\"Some one that her husband has sent for the child.\"\n\n\"The boy must not be given up, Oliphant.\"\n\n\"It's all very well to say that, but I suppose we must obey the law.\nThe parsonage of St. Diddulph's isn't a castle in the Apennines. When\nit comes to this, that a policeman is sent here to fetch any man's\nchild, and threatens me with an action because I tell him to leave my\nhouse, it is very hard upon me, seeing how very little I've had to do\nwith it. It's all over the parish now that my niece is kept here away\nfrom her husband, and that a lover comes to see her. This about the\npoliceman will be known now, of course. I only say it is hard; that's\nall.\" The wife did all that she could to comfort him, reminding him\nthat Sir Marmaduke would be home soon, and that then the burden would\nbe taken from his shoulders. But she was forced to admit that it was\nvery hard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nHUGH STANBURY IS SHEWN TO BE NO CONJUROR.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nMany weeks had now passed since Hugh Stanbury had paid his visit to\nSt. Diddulph's, and Nora Rowley was beginning to believe that her\nrejection of her lover had been so firm and decided that she would\nnever see him or hear from him more; and she had long since confessed\nto herself that if she did not see him or hear from him soon, life\nwould not be worth a straw to her. To all of us a single treasure\ncounts for much more when the outward circumstances of our life are\ndull, unvaried, and melancholy, than it does when our days are full\nof pleasure, or excitement, or even of business. With Nora Rowley at\nSt. Diddulph's life at present was very melancholy. There was little\nor no society to enliven her. Her sister was sick at heart, and\nbecoming ill in health under the burden of her troubles. Mr. Outhouse\nwas moody and wretched; and Mrs. Outhouse, though she did her best\nto make her house comfortable to her unwelcome inmates, could not\nmake it appear that their presence there was a pleasure to her.\nNora understood better than did her sister how distasteful the\npresent arrangement was to their uncle, and was consequently very\nuncomfortable on that score. And in the midst of that unhappiness,\nshe of course told herself that she was a young woman miserable and\nunfortunate altogether. It is always so with us. The heart when it is\nburdened, though it may have ample strength to bear the burden, loses\nits buoyancy and doubts its own power. It is like the springs of a\ncarriage which are pressed flat by the superincumbent weight. But,\nbecause the springs are good, the weight is carried safely, and they\nare the better afterwards for their required purposes because of the\ntrial to which they have been subjected.\n\nNora had sent her lover away, and now at the end of three months\nfrom the day of his dismissal she had taught herself to believe that\nhe would never come again. Amidst the sadness of her life at St.\nDiddulph's some confidence in a lover expected to come again would\nhave done much to cheer her. The more she thought of Hugh Stanbury,\nthe more fully she became convinced that he was the man who as a\nlover, as a husband, and as a companion, would just suit all her\ntastes. She endowed him liberally with a hundred good gifts in the\ndisposal of which Nature had been much more sparing. She made for\nherself a mental portrait of him more gracious in its flattery than\never was canvas coming from the hand of a Court limner. She gave\nhim all gifts of manliness, honesty, truth, and energy, and felt\nregarding him that he was a Paladin,--such as Paladins are in this\nage, that he was indomitable, sure of success, and fitted in all\nrespects to take the high position which he would certainly win\nfor himself. But she did not presume him to be endowed with such a\nconstancy as would make him come to seek her hand again. Had Nora at\nthis time of her life been living at the West-end of London, and\ngoing out to parties three or four times a week, she would have been\nquite easy about his coming. The springs would not have been weighted\nso heavily, and her heart would have been elastic.\n\nNo doubt she had forgotten many of the circumstances of his visit\nand of his departure. Immediately on his going she had told her\nsister that he would certainly come again, but had said at the same\ntime that his coming could be of no use. He was so poor a man; and\nshe,--though poorer than he,--had been so little accustomed to\npoverty of life, that she had then acknowledged to herself that she\nwas not fit to be his wife. Gradually, as the slow weeks went by her,\nthere had come a change in her ideas. She now thought that he never\nwould come again; but that if he did she would confess to him that\nher own views about life were changed. \"I would tell him frankly\nthat I could eat a crust with him in any garret in London.\" But this\nwas said to herself;--never to her sister. Emily and Mrs. Outhouse\nhad determined together that it would be wise to abstain from all\nmention of Hugh Stanbury's name. Nora had felt that her sister had so\nabstained, and this reticence had assisted in producing the despair\nwhich had come upon her. Hugh, when he had left her, had certainly\ngiven her encouragement to expect that he would return. She had been\nsure then that he would return. She had been sure of it, though she\nhad told him that it would be useless. But now, when these sad weeks\nhad slowly crept over her head, when during the long hours of the\nlong days she had thought of him continually,--telling herself that\nit was impossible that she should ever become the wife of any man if\nshe did not become his,--she assured herself that she had seen and\nheard the last of him. She must surely have forgotten his hot words\nand that daring embrace.\n\nThen there came a letter to her. The question of the management of\nletters for young ladies is handled very differently in different\nhouses. In some establishments the post is as free to young ladies\nas it is to the reverend seniors of the household. In others it is\nconsidered to be quite a matter of course that some experienced\ndiscretion should sit in judgment on the correspondence of the\ndaughters of the family. When Nora Rowley was living with her sister\nin Curzon Street, she would have been very indignant indeed had it\nbeen suggested to her that there was any authority over her letters\nvested in her sister. But now, circumstanced as she was at St.\nDiddulph's, she did understand that no letter would reach her\nwithout her aunt knowing that it had come. All this was distasteful\nto her,--as were indeed all the details of her life at St.\nDiddulph's;--but she could not help herself. Had her aunt told her\nthat she should never be allowed to receive a letter at all, she must\nhave submitted till her mother had come to her relief. The letter\nwhich reached her now was put into her hands by her sister, but it\nhad been given to Mrs. Trevelyan by Mrs. Outhouse. \"Nora,\" said\nMrs. Trevelyan, \"here is a letter for you. I think it is from Mr.\nStanbury.\"\n\n\"Give it me,\" said Nora greedily.\n\n\"Of course I will give it you. But I hope you do not intend to\ncorrespond with him.\"\n\n\"If he has written to me I shall answer him of course,\" said Nora,\nholding her treasure.\n\n\"Aunt Mary thinks that you should not do so till papa and mamma have\narrived.\"\n\n\"If Aunt Mary is afraid of me let her tell me so, and I will contrive\nto go somewhere else.\" Poor Nora knew that this threat was futile.\nThere was no house to which she could take herself.\n\n\"She is not afraid of you at all, Nora. She only says that she thinks\nyou should not write to Mr. Stanbury.\" Then Nora escaped to the cold\nbut solitary seclusion of her bed-room and there she read her letter.\n\nThe reader may remember that Hugh Stanbury when he last left St.\nDiddulph's had not been oppressed by any of the gloomy reveries of a\ndespairing lover. He had spoken his mind freely to Nora, and had felt\nhimself justified in believing that he had not spoken in vain. He had\nhad her in his arms, and she had found it impossible to say that she\ndid not love him. But then she had been quite firm in her purpose to\ngive him no encouragement that she could avoid. She had said no word\nthat would justify him in considering that there was any engagement\nbetween them; and, moreover, he had been warned not to come to the\nhouse by its mistress. From day to day he thought of it all, now\ntelling himself that there was nothing to be done but to trust in\nher fidelity till he should be in a position to offer her a fitting\nhome, and then reflecting that he could not expect such a girl as\nNora Rowley to wait for him, unless he could succeed in making her\nunderstand that he at any rate intended to wait for her. On one day\nhe would think that good faith and proper consideration for Nora\nherself required him to keep silent; on the next he would tell\nhimself that such maudlin chivalry as he was proposing to himself was\nsure to go to the wall and be neither rewarded nor recognised. So at\nlast he sat down and wrote the following letter:--\n\n\n   Lincoln's Inn Fields, January, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST NORA,\n\n   Ever since I last saw you at St. Diddulph's, I have been\n   trying to teach myself what I ought to do in reference\n   to you. Sometimes I think that because I am poor I ought\n   to hold my tongue. At others I feel sure that I ought to\n   speak out loud, because I love you so dearly. You may\n   presume that just at this moment the latter opinion is in\n   the ascendant.\n\n   As I do write I mean to be very bold; so bold that if I am\n   wrong you will be thoroughly disgusted with me and will\n   never willingly see me again. But I think it best to be\n   true, and to say what I think. I do believe that you love\n   me. According to all precedent I ought not to say so;--but\n   I do believe it. Ever since I was at St. Diddulph's that\n   belief has made me happy,--though there have been moments\n   of doubt. If I thought that you did not love me, I would\n   trouble you no further. A man may win his way to love when\n   social circumstances are such as to throw him and the girl\n   together; but such is not the case with us; and unless you\n   love me now, you never will love me.\n\n\n\"I do--I do!\" said Nora, pressing the letter to her bosom.\n\n\n   If you do, I think that you owe it me to say so, and\n   to let me have all the joy and all the feeling of\n   responsibility which such an assurance will give me.\n\n\n\"I will tell him so,\" said Nora; \"I don't care what may come\nafterwards, but I will tell him the truth.\"\n\n\n   I know [continued Hugh] that an engagement with me now\n   would be hazardous, because what I earn is both scanty and\n   precarious; but it seems to me that nothing could ever\n   be done without some risk. There are risks of different\n   kinds,--\n\n\nShe wondered whether he was thinking when he wrote this of the rock\non which her sister's barque had been split to pieces;--\n\n\n   and we may hardly hope to avoid them all. For myself,\n   I own that life would be tame to me, if there were no\n   dangers to be overcome.\n\n   If you do love me, and will say so, I will not ask you\n   to be my wife till I can give you a proper home; but the\n   knowledge that I am the master of the treasure which I\n   desire will give me a double energy, and will make me feel\n   that when I have gained so much I cannot fail of adding to\n   it all other smaller things that may be necessary.\n\n   Pray,--pray, send me an answer. I cannot reach you except\n   by writing, as I was told by your aunt not to come to the\n   house again.\n\n   Dearest Nora, pray believe\n   That I shall always be truly yours only,\n\n   HUGH STANBURY.\n\n\nWrite to him! Of course she would write to him. Of course she would\nconfess to him the truth. \"He tells me that I owe it to him to say\nso, and I acknowledge the debt,\" she said aloud to herself. \"And as\nfor a proper home, he shall be the judge of that.\" She resolved that\nshe would not be a fine lady, not fastidious, not coy, not afraid\nto take her full share of the risk of which he spoke in such manly\nterms. \"It is quite true. As he has been able to make me love him,\nI have no right to stand aloof,--even if I wished it.\" As she was\nwalking up and down the room so resolving her sister came to her.\n\n\"Well, dear!\" said Emily. \"May I ask what it is he says?\"\n\nNora paused a moment, holding the letter tight in her hand, and then\nshe held it out to her sister. \"There it is. You may read it.\" Mrs.\nTrevelyan took the letter and read it slowly, during which Nora\nstood looking out of the window. She would not watch her sister's\nface, as she did not wish to have to reply to any outward signs of\ndisapproval. \"Give it me back,\" she said, when she heard by the\nrefolding of the paper that the perusal was finished.\n\n\"Of course I shall give it you back, dear.\"\n\n\"Yes;--thanks. I did not mean to doubt you.\"\n\n\"And what will you do, Nora?\"\n\n\"Answer it of course.\"\n\n\"I would think a little before I answered it,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"I have thought,--a great deal, already.\"\n\n\"And how will you answer it?\"\n\nNora paused again before she replied. \"As nearly as I know how to do\nin such words as he would put into my mouth. I shall strive to write\njust what I think he would wish me to write.\"\n\n\"Then you will engage yourself to him, Nora?\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall. I am engaged to him already. I have been ever\nsince he came here.\"\n\n\"You told me that there was nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"I told you that I loved him better than anybody in the world, and\nthat ought to have made you know what it must come to. When I am\nthinking of him every day, and every hour, how can I not be glad to\nhave an engagement settled with him? I couldn't marry anybody else,\nand I don't want to remain as I am.\" The tears came into the married\nsister's eyes, and rolled down her cheeks, as this was said to her.\nWould it not have been better for her had she remained as she was?\n\"Dear Emily,\" said Nora, \"you have got Louey still.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and they mean to take him from me. But I do not wish to speak\nof myself. Will you postpone your answer till mamma is here?\"\n\n\"I cannot do that, Emily. What; receive such a letter as that, and\nsend no reply to it!\"\n\n\"I would write a line for you, and explain--\"\n\n\"No, indeed, Emily. I choose to answer my own letters. I have shewn\nyou that, because I trust you; but I have fully made up my mind as\nto what I shall write. It will have been written and sent before\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I think you will be wrong, Nora.\"\n\n\"Why wrong! When I came over here to stay with you, would mamma ever\nhave thought of directing me not to accept any offer till her consent\nhad been obtained all the way from the Mandarins? She would never\nhave dreamed of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Will you ask Aunt Mary?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. What is Aunt Mary to me? We are here in her house for\na time, under the press of circumstances; but I owe her no obedience.\nShe told Mr. Stanbury not to come here; and he has not come; and I\nshall not ask him to come. I would not willingly bring any one into\nUncle Oliphant's house that he and she do not wish to see. But I will\nnot admit that either of them have any authority over me.\"\n\n\"Then who has, dearest?\"\n\n\"Nobody;--except papa and mamma; and they have chosen to leave me to\nmyself.\"\n\nMrs. Trevelyan found it impossible to shake her sister's firmness,\nand could herself do nothing, except tell Mrs. Outhouse what was the\nstate of affairs. When she said that she should do this, there almost\ncame to be a flow of high words between the two sisters; but at last\nNora assented. \"As for knowing, I don't care if all the world knows\nit. I shall do nothing in a corner. I don't suppose Aunt Mary will\nendeavour to prevent my posting my letter.\"\n\nEmily at last went to seek Mrs. Outhouse, and Nora at once sat\ndown to her desk. Neither of the sisters felt at all sure that Mrs.\nOuthouse would not attempt to stop the emission of the letter from\nher house; but, as it happened, she was out, and did not return till\nNora had come back from her journey to the neighbouring post-office.\nShe would trust her letter, when written, to no hands but her\nown; and as she herself dropped it into the safe custody of the\nPostmaster-General, it also shall be revealed to the public:--\n\n\n   Parsonage, St. Diddulph's, January, 186--.\n\n   DEAR HUGH,\n\n   For I suppose I may as well write to you in that way now.\n   I have been made so happy by your affectionate letter. Is\n   not that a candid confession for a young lady? But you\n   tell me that I owe you the truth, and so I tell you the\n   truth. Nobody will ever be anything to me, except you; and\n   you are everything. I do love you; and should it ever be\n   possible, I will become your wife.\n\n   I have said so much, because I feel that I ought to obey\n   the order you have given me; but pray do not try to see me\n   or write to me till mamma has arrived. She and papa will\n   be here in the spring,--quite early in the spring, we\n   hope; and then you may come to us. What they may say, of\n   course, I cannot tell; but I shall be true to you.\n\n   Your own, with truest affection,\n\n   NORA.\n\n   Of course, you knew that I loved you, and I don't think\n   that you are a conjuror at all.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Nora's letter.]\n\n\nAs soon as ever the letter was written, she put on her bonnet, and\nwent forth with it herself to the post-office. Mrs. Trevelyan stopped\nher on the stairs, and endeavoured to detain her, but Nora would not\nbe detained. \"I must judge for myself about this,\" she said. \"If\nmamma were here, it would be different, but, as she is not here, I\nmust judge for myself.\"\n\nWhat Mrs. Outhouse might have done had she been at home at the time,\nit would be useless to surmise. She was told what had happened\nwhen it occurred, and questioned Nora on the subject. \"I thought I\nunderstood from you,\" she said, with something of severity in her\ncountenance, \"that there was to be nothing between you and Mr.\nStanbury--at any rate, till my brother came home?\"\n\n\"I never pledged myself to anything of the kind, Aunt Mary,\" Nora\nsaid. \"I think he promised that he would not come here, and I don't\nsuppose that he means to come. If he should do so, I shall not see\nhim.\"\n\nWith this Mrs. Outhouse was obliged to be content. The letter was\ngone, and could not be stopped. Nor, indeed, had any authority been\ndelegated to her by which she would have been justified in stopping\nit. She could only join her husband in wishing that they both\nmight be relieved, as soon as possible, from the terrible burden\nwhich had been thrown upon them. \"I call it very hard,\" said Mr.\nOuthouse;--\"very hard, indeed. If we were to desire them to leave\nthe house, everybody would cry out upon us for our cruelty; and yet,\nwhile they remain here, they will submit themselves to no authority.\nAs far as I can see, they may, both of them, do just what they\nplease, and we can't stop it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nMR. GIBSON'S THREAT.\n\n\nMiss Stanbury for a long time persisted in being neither better nor\nworse. Sir Peter would not declare her state to be precarious, nor\nwould he say that she was out of danger; and Mr. Martin had been so\nutterly prostrated by the nearly-fatal effects of his own mistake\nthat he was quite unable to rally himself and talk on the subject\nwith any spirit or confidence. When interrogated he would simply\nreply that Sir Peter said this and Sir Peter said that, and thus\nadd to, rather than diminish, the doubt, and excitement, and varied\nopinion which prevailed through the city. On one morning it was\nabsolutely asserted within the limits of the Close that Miss Stanbury\nwas dying,--and it was believed for half a day at the bank that she\nwas then lying in articulo mortis. There had got about, too, a report\nthat a portion of the property had only been left to Miss Stanbury\nfor her life, that the Burgesses would be able to reclaim the\nhouses in the city, and that a will had been made altogether in\nfavour of Dorothy, cutting out even Brooke from any share in the\ninheritance;--and thus Exeter had a good deal to say respecting\nthe affairs and state of health of our old friend. Miss Stanbury's\nillness, however, was true enough. She was much too ill to hear\nanything of what was going on;--too ill to allow Martha to talk to\nher at all about the outside public. When the invalid herself would\nask questions about the affairs of the world, Martha would be very\ndiscreet and turn away from the subject. Miss Stanbury, for instance,\nill as she was, exhibited a most mundane interest, not exactly in\nCamilla French's marriage, but in the delay which that marriage\nseemed destined to encounter. \"I dare say he'll slip out of it yet,\"\nsaid the sick lady to her confidential servant. Then Martha had\nthought it right to change the subject, feeling it to be wrong\nthat an old lady on her death-bed should be taking joy in the\ndisappointment of her young neighbour. Martha changed the subject,\nfirst to jelly, and then to the psalms of the day. Miss Stanbury\nwas too weak to resist; but the last verse of the last psalm of the\nevening had hardly been finished before she remarked that she would\nnever believe it till she saw it. \"It's all in the hands of Him as is\non high, mum,\" said Martha, turning her eyes up to the ceiling, and\nclosing the book at the same time, with a look strongly indicative of\ndispleasure.\n\nMiss Stanbury understood it all as well as though she were in perfect\nhealth. She knew her own failings, was conscious of her worldly\ntendencies, and perceived that her old servant was thinking of it.\nAnd then sundry odd thoughts, half-digested thoughts, ideas too\ndifficult for her present strength, crossed her brain. Had it been\nwicked of her when she was well to hope that a scheming woman should\nnot succeed in betraying a man by her schemes into an ill-assorted\nmarriage; and if not wicked then, was it wicked now because she was\nill? And from that thought her mind travelled on to the ordinary\npractices of death-bed piety. Could an assumed devotion be of use to\nher now,--such a devotion as Martha was enjoining upon her from hour\nto hour, in pure and affectionate solicitude for her soul? She had\nspoken one evening of a game of cards, saying that a game of cribbage\nwould have consoled her. Then Martha, with a shudder, had suggested\na hymn, and had had recourse at once to a sleeping draught. Miss\nStanbury had submitted, but had understood it all. If cards were\nwicked, she had indeed been a terrible sinner. What hope could there\nbe now, on her death-bed, for one so sinful? And she could not repent\nof her cards, and would not try to repent of them, not seeing the\nevil of them; and if they were innocent, why should she not have the\nconsolation now,--when she so much wanted it? Yet she knew that the\nwhole household, even Dorothy, would be in arms against her, were she\nto suggest such a thing. She took the hymn and the sleeping draught,\ntelling herself that it would be best for her to banish such ideas\nfrom her mind. Pastors and masters had laid down for her a mode of\nliving, which she had followed, but indifferently perhaps, but still\nwith an intention of obedience. They had also laid down a mode of\ndying, and it would be well that she should follow that as closely\nas possible. She would say nothing more about cards. She would\nthink nothing more of Camilla French. But, as she so resolved, with\nintellect half asleep, with her mind wandering between fact and\ndream, she was unconsciously comfortable with an assurance that if\nMr. Gibson did marry Camilla French, Camilla French would lead him\nthe very devil of a life.\n\nDuring three days Dorothy went about the house as quiet as a mouse,\nsitting nightly at her aunt's bedside, and tending the sick woman\nwith the closest care. She, too, had been now and again somewhat\nstartled by the seeming worldliness of her aunt in her illness. Her\naunt talked to her about rents, and gave her messages for Brooke\nBurgess on subjects which seemed to Dorothy to be profane when spoken\nof on what might perhaps be a death-bed. And this struck her the more\nstrongly, because she had a matter of her own on which she would have\nmuch wished to ascertain her aunt's opinion, if she had not thought\nthat it would have been exceedingly wrong of her to trouble her\naunt's mind at such a time by any such matter. Hitherto she had said\nnot a word of Brooke's proposal to any living being. At present it\nwas a secret with herself, but a secret so big that it almost caused\nher bosom to burst with the load that it bore. She could not, she\nthought, write to Priscilla till she had told her aunt. If she were\nto write a word on the subject to any one, she could not fail to make\nmanifest the extreme longing of her own heart. She could not have\nwritten Brooke's name on paper, in reference to his words to herself,\nwithout covering it with epithets of love. But all that must be known\nto no one if her love was to be of no avail to her. And she had an\nidea that her aunt would not wish Brooke to marry her,--would think\nthat Brooke should do better; and she was quite clear that in such a\nmatter as this her aunt's wishes must be law. Had not her aunt the\npower of disinheriting Brooke altogether? And what then if her aunt\nshould die,--should die now,--leaving Brooke at liberty to do as he\npleased? There was something so distasteful to her in this view of\nthe matter that she would not look at it. She would not allow herself\nto think of any success which might possibly accrue to herself by\nreason of her aunt's death. Intense as was the longing in her heart\nfor permission from those in authority over her to give herself to\nBrooke Burgess, perfect as was the earthly Paradise which appeared to\nbe open to her when she thought of the good thing which had befallen\nher in that matter, she conceived that she would be guilty of the\ngrossest ingratitude were she in any degree to curtail even her own\nestimate of her aunt's prohibitory powers because of her aunt's\nillness. The remembrance of the words which Brooke had spoken to her\nwas with her quite perfect. She was entirely conscious of the joy\nwhich would be hers, if she might accept those words as properly\nsanctioned; but she was a creature in her aunt's hands,--according to\nher own ideas of her own duties; and while her aunt was ill she could\nnot even learn what might be the behests which she would be called on\nto obey.\n\nShe was sitting one evening alone, thinking of all this, having left\nMartha with her aunt, and was trying to reconcile the circumstances\nof her life as it now existed with the circumstances as they had been\nwith her in the old days at Nuncombe Putney, wondering at herself in\nthat she should have a lover, and trying to convince herself that for\nher this little episode of romance could mean nothing serious, when\nMartha crept down into the room to her. Of late days,--the alteration\nmight perhaps be dated from the rejection of Mr. Gibson,--Martha, who\nhad always been very kind, had become more respectful in her manner\nto Dorothy than had heretofore been usual with her. Dorothy was quite\naware of it, and was not unconscious of a certain rise in the world\nwhich was thereby indicated. \"If you please, miss,\" said Martha, \"who\ndo you think is here?\"\n\n\"But there is nobody with my aunt?\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"She is sleeping like a babby, and I came down just for a moment.\nMr. Gibson is here, miss,--in the house! He asked for your aunt, and\nwhen, of course, he could not see her, he asked for you.\" Dorothy for\na few minutes was utterly disconcerted, but at last she consented to\nsee Mr. Gibson. \"I think it is best,\" said Martha, \"because it is bad\nto be fighting, and missus so ill. 'Blessed are the peace-makers,'\nmiss, 'for they shall be called the children of God.'\" Convinced by\nthis argument, or by the working of her own mind, Dorothy directed\nthat Mr. Gibson might be shewn into the room. When he came, she found\nherself unable to address him. She remembered the last time in which\nshe had seen him, and was lost in wonder that he should be there. But\nshe shook hands with him, and went through some form of greeting in\nwhich no word was uttered.\n\n\"I hope you will not think that I have done wrong,\" said he, \"in\ncalling to ask after my old friend's state of health?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said Dorothy, quite bewildered.\n\n\"I have known her for so very long, Miss Dorothy, that now in the\nhour of her distress, and perhaps mortal malady, I cannot stop to\nremember the few harsh words that she spoke to me lately.\"\n\n\"She never means to be harsh, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"Ah; well; no,--perhaps not. At any rate, I have learned to forgive\nand forget. I am afraid your aunt is very ill, Miss Dorothy.\"\n\n\"She is ill, certainly, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear! We are all as the grass of the field, Miss\nDorothy,--here to-day and gone to-morrow, as sparks fly upwards. Just\nfit to be cut down and cast into the oven. Mr. Jennings has been with\nher, I believe?\" Mr. Jennings was the other minor canon.\n\n\"He comes three times a week, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"He is an excellent young man,--a very good young man. It has been a\ngreat comfort to me to have Jennings with me. But he's very young,\nMiss Dorothy; isn't he?\" Dorothy muttered something, purporting to\ndeclare that she was not acquainted with the exact circumstances of\nMr. Jennings' age. \"I should be so glad to come if my old friend\nwould allow me,\" said Mr. Gibson, almost with a sigh. Dorothy was\nclearly of opinion that any change at the present would be bad for\nher aunt, but she did not know how to express her opinion; so she\nstood silent and looked at him. \"There needn't be a word spoken, you\nknow, about the ladies at Heavitree,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said Dorothy. And yet she knew well that there would\nbe such words spoken if Mr. Gibson were to make his way into her\naunt's room. Her aunt was constantly alluding to the ladies at\nHeavitree, in spite of all the efforts of her old servant to restrain\nher.\n\n\"There was some little misunderstanding,\" said Mr. Gibson; \"but all\nthat should be over now. We both intended for the best, Miss Dorothy;\nand I'm sure nobody here can say that I wasn't sincere.\" But Dorothy,\nthough she could not bring herself to answer Mr. Gibson plainly,\ncould not be induced to assent to his proposition. She muttered\nsomething about her aunt's weakness, and the great attention which\nMr. Jennings shewed. Her aunt had become very fond of Mr. Jennings,\nand she did at last express her opinion, with some clearness, that\nher aunt should not be disturbed by any changes at present. \"After\nthat I should not think of pressing it, Miss Dorothy,\" said Mr.\nGibson; \"but, still, I do hope that I may have the privilege of\nseeing her yet once again in the flesh. And touching my approaching\nmarriage, Miss Dorothy--\" He paused, and Dorothy felt that she\nwas blushing up to the roots of her hair. \"Touching my marriage,\"\ncontinued Mr. Gibson, \"which however will not be solemnized till the\nend of March;\"--it was manifest that he regarded this as a point that\nwould in that household be regarded as an argument in his favour,--\"I\ndo hope that you will look upon it in the most favourable light,--and\nyour excellent aunt also, if she be spared to us.\"\n\n\"I am sure we hope that you will be happy, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"What was I to do, Miss Dorothy? I know that I have been very much\nblamed;--but so unfairly! I have never meant to be untrue to a mouse,\nMiss Dorothy.\" Dorothy did not at all understand whether she were the\nmouse, or Camilla French, or Arabella. \"And it is so hard to find\nthat one is ill-spoken of because things have gone a little amiss.\"\nIt was quite impossible that Dorothy should make any answer to this,\nand at last Mr. Gibson left her, assuring her with his last word that\nnothing would give him so much pleasure as to be called upon once\nmore to see his old friend in her last moments.\n\nThough Miss Stanbury had been described as sleeping \"like a babby,\"\nshe had heard the footsteps of a strange man in the house, and had\nmade Martha tell her whose footsteps they were. As soon as Dorothy\nwent to her, she darted upon the subject with all her old keenness.\n\"What did he want here, Dolly?\"\n\n\"He said he would like to see you, aunt,--when you are a little\nbetter, you know. He spoke a good deal of his old friendship and\nrespect.\"\n\n\"He should have thought of that before. How am I to see people now?\"\n\n\"But when you are better, aunt--?\"\n\n\"How do I know that I shall ever be better? He isn't off with those\npeople at Heavitree,--is he?\"\n\n\"I hope not, aunt.\"\n\n\"Psha! A poor, weak, insufficient creature;--that's what he is.\nMr. Jennings is worth twenty of him.\" Dorothy, though she put the\nquestion again in its most alluring form of Christian charity and\nforgiveness, could not induce her aunt to say that she would see\nMr. Gibson. \"How can I see him, when you know that Sir Peter has\nforbidden me to see anybody except Mrs. Clifford and Mr. Jennings?\"\n\nTwo days afterwards there was an uncomfortable little scene at\nHeavitree. It must, no doubt, have been the case, that the same train\nof circumstances which had produced Mr. Gibson's visit to the Close,\nproduced also the scene in question. It was suggested by some who\nwere attending closely to the matter that Mr. Gibson had already come\nto repent his engagement with Camilla French; and, indeed, there were\nthose who pretended to believe that he was induced, by the prospect\nof Miss Stanbury's demise, to transfer his allegiance yet again, and\nto bestow his hand upon Dorothy at last. There were many in the city\nwho could never be persuaded that Dorothy had refused him,--these\nbeing, for the most part, ladies in whose estimation the value of a\nhusband was counted so great, and a beneficed clergyman so valuable\namong suitors, that it was to their thinking impossible that Dorothy\nStanbury should in her sound senses have rejected such an offer. \"I\ndon't believe a bit of it,\" said Mrs. Crumbie to Mrs. Apjohn; \"is\nit likely?\" The ears of all the French family were keenly alive\nto rumours, and to rumours of rumours. Reports of these opinions\nrespecting Mr. Gibson reached Heavitree, and had their effect.\nAs long as Mr. Gibson was behaving well as a suitor, they were\ninoperative there. What did it matter to them how the prize might\nhave been struggled for,--might still be struggled for elsewhere,\nwhile they enjoyed the consciousness of possession? But when the\nconsciousness of possession became marred by a cankerous doubt, such\nrumours were very important. Camilla heard of the visit in the Close,\nand swore that she would have justice done her. She gave her mother\nto understand that, if any trick were played upon her, the diocese\nshould be made to ring of it, in a fashion that would astonish them\nall, from the bishop downwards. Whereupon Mrs. French, putting much\nfaith in her daughter's threats, sent for Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"The truth is, Mr. Gibson,\" said Mrs. French, when the civilities of\ntheir first greeting had been completed, \"my poor child is pining.\"\n\n\"Pining, Mrs. French!\"\n\n\"Yes;--pining, Mr. Gibson. I am afraid that you little understand\nhow sensitive is that young heart. Of course, she is your own now.\nTo her thinking, it would be treason to you for her to indulge in\nconversation with any other gentleman; but, then, she expects that\nyou should spend your evenings with her,--of course!\"\n\n\"But, Mrs. French,--think of my engagements, as a clergyman.\"\n\n\"We know all about that, Mr. Gibson. We know what a clergyman's calls\nare. It isn't like a doctor's, Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"It's very often worse, Mrs. French.\"\n\n\"Why should you go calling in the Close, Mr. Gibson?\" Here was the\ngist of the accusation.\n\n\"Wouldn't you have me make my peace with a poor dying sister?\"\npleaded Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"After what has occurred,\" said Mrs. French, shaking her head at him,\n\"and while things are just as they are now, it would be more like an\nhonest man of you to stay away. And, of course, Camilla feels it. She\nfeels it very much;--and she won't put up with it neither.\"\n\n\"I think this is the cruellest, cruellest thing I ever heard,\" said\nMr. Gibson.\n\n\"It is you that are cruel, sir.\"\n\nThen the wretched man turned at bay. \"I tell you what it is, Mrs.\nFrench;--if I am treated in this way, I won't stand it. I won't,\nindeed. I'll go away. I'm not going to be suspected, nor yet blown\nup. I think I've behaved handsomely, at any rate to Camilla.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Mr. Gibson, if you would come and see her on evenings,\"\nsaid Mrs. French, who was falling back into her usual state of\ntimidity.\n\n\"But, if I'm to be treated in this way, I will go away. I've thought\nof it as it is. I've been already invited to go to Natal, and if I\nhear anything more of these accusations, I shall certainly make up\nmy mind to go.\" Then he left the house, before Camilla could be down\nupon him from her perch on the landing-place.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nTHE REPUBLICAN BROWNING.\n\n\nMr. Glascock had returned to Naples after his sufferings in the\ndining-room of the American Minister, and by the middle of February\nwas back again in Florence. His father was still alive, and it was\nsaid that the old lord would now probably live through the winter.\nAnd it was understood that Mr. Glascock would remain in Italy. He\nhad declared that he would pass his time between Naples, Rome, and\nFlorence; but it seemed to his friends that Florence was, of the\nthree, the most to his taste. He liked his room, he said, at the York\nHotel, and he liked being in the capital. That was his own statement.\nHis friends said that he liked being with Carry Spalding, the\ndaughter of the American Minister; but none of them, then in Italy,\nwere sufficiently intimate with him to express that opinion to\nhimself.\n\nIt had been expressed more than once to Carry Spalding. The world in\ngeneral says such things to ladies more openly than it does to men,\nand the probability of a girl's success in matrimony is canvassed\nin her hearing by those who are nearest to her with a freedom which\ncan seldom be used in regard to a man. A man's most intimate friend\nhardly speaks to him of the prospect of his marriage till he himself\nhas told that the engagement exists. The lips of no living person had\nsuggested to Mr. Glascock that the American girl was to become his\nwife; but a great deal had been said to Carry Spalding about the\nconquest she had made. Her uncle, her aunt, her sister, and her great\nfriend Miss Petrie, the poetess,--the Republican Browning as she\nwas called,--had all spoken to her about it frequently. Olivia had\ndeclared her conviction that the thing was to be. Miss Petrie had,\nwith considerable eloquence, explained to her friend that that\nEnglish title, which was but the clatter of a sounding brass, should\nbe regarded as a drawback rather than as an advantage. Mrs. Spalding,\nwho was no poetess, would undoubtedly have welcomed Mr. Glascock as\nher niece's husband with all an aunt's energy. When told by Miss\nPetrie that old Lord Peterborough was a tinkling cymbal she snapped\nangrily at her gifted countrywoman. But she was too honest a woman,\nand too conscious also of her niece's strength, to say a word to urge\nher on. Mr. Spalding as an American minister, with full powers at the\ncourt of a European sovereign, felt that he had full as much to give\nas to receive; but he was well inclined to do both. He would have\nbeen much pleased to talk about his nephew Lord Peterborough, and\nhe loved his niece dearly. But by the middle of February he was\nbeginning to think that the matter had been long enough in training.\nIf the Honourable Glascock meant anything, why did he not speak\nout his mind plainly? The American Minister in such matters was\naccustomed to fewer ambages than were common in the circles among\nwhich Mr. Glascock had lived.\n\nIn the meantime Caroline Spalding was suffering. She had allowed\nherself to think that Mr. Glascock intended to propose to her, and\nhad acknowledged to herself that were he to do so she would certainly\naccept him. All that she had seen of him, since the day on which he\nhad been courteous to her about the seat in the diligence, had been\npleasant to her. She had felt the charm of his manner, his education,\nand his gentleness; and had told herself that with all her love for\nher own country, she would willingly become an Englishwoman for the\nsake of being that man's wife. But nevertheless the warnings of her\ngreat friend, the poetess, had not been thrown away upon her. She\nwould put away from herself as far as she could any desire to become\nLady Peterborough. There should be no bias in the man's favour on\nthat score. The tinkling cymbal and the sounding brass should be\nnothing to her. But yet,--yet what a chance was there here for her?\n\"They are dishonest, and rotten at the core,\" said Miss Petrie,\ntrying to make her friend understand that a free American should\nunder no circumstances place trust in an English aristocrat. \"Their\ncountry, Carry, is a game played out, while we are still breasting\nthe hill with our young lungs full of air.\" Carry Spalding was proud\nof her intimacy with the Republican Browning; but nevertheless she\nliked Mr. Glascock; and when Mr. Glascock had been ten days in\nFlorence, on his third visit to the city, and had been four or five\ntimes at the embassy without expressing his intentions in the proper\nform, Carry Spalding began to think that she had better save herself\nfrom a heartbreak while salvation might be within her reach. She\nperceived that her uncle was gloomy and almost angry when he spoke of\nMr. Glascock, and that her aunt was fretful with disappointment. The\nRepublican Browning had uttered almost a note of triumph; and had it\nnot been that Olivia persisted, Carry Spalding would have consented\nto go away with Miss Petrie to Rome. \"The old stones are rotten too,\"\nsaid the poetess; \"but their dust tells no lies.\" That well known\npiece of hers--\"Ancient Marbles, while ye crumble,\" was written at\nthis time, and contained an occult reference to Mr. Glascock and her\nfriend.\n\nBut Livy Spalding clung to the alliance. She probably knew her\nsister's heart better than did the others; and perhaps also had a\nclearer insight into Mr. Glascock's character. She was at any rate\nclearly of opinion that there should be no running away. \"Either you\ndo like him, or you don't. If you do, what are you to get by going to\nRome?\" said Livy.\n\n\"I shall get quit of doubt and trouble.\"\n\n\"I call that cowardice. I would never run away from a man, Carry.\nAunt Sophie forgets that they don't manage these things in England\njust as we do.\"\n\n\"I don't know why there should be a difference.\"\n\n\"Nor do I;--only that there is. You haven't read so many of their\nnovels as I have.\"\n\n\"Who would ever think of learning to live out of an English novel?\"\nsaid Carry.\n\n\"I am not saying that. You may teach him to live how you like\nafterwards. But if you have anything to do with people it must be\nwell to know what their manners are. I think the richer sort of\npeople in England slide into these things more gradually than we do.\nYou stand your ground, Carry, and hold your own, and take the goods\nthe gods provide you.\" Though Caroline Spalding opposed her sister's\narguments, and was particularly hard upon that allusion to \"the\nricher sort of people,\"--which, as she knew, Miss Petrie would have\nregarded as evidence of reverence for sounding brasses and tinkling\ncymbals,--nevertheless she loved Livy dearly for what she said, and\nkissed the sweet counsellor, and resolved that she would for the\npresent decline the invitation of the poetess. Then was Miss Petrie\nsomewhat indignant with her friend, and threw out her scorn in those\nlines which have been mentioned.\n\nBut the American Minister hardly knew how to behave himself when he\nmet Mr. Glascock, or even when he was called upon to speak of him.\nFlorence no doubt is a large city, and is now the capital of a great\nkingdom; but still people meet in Florence much more frequently\nthan they do in Paris or in London. It may almost be said that they\nwhose habit it is to go into society, and whose circumstances bring\nthem into the same circles, will see each other every day. Now the\nAmerican Minister delighted to see and to be seen in all places\nfrequented by persons of a certain rank and position in Florence.\nHaving considered the matter much, he had convinced himself that\nhe could thus best do his duty as minister from the great Republic\nof Free States to the newest and,--as he called it,--\"the free-est\nof the European kingdoms.\" The minister from France was a marquis;\nhe from England was an earl; from Spain had come a count,--and so\non. In the domestic privacy of his embassy Mr. Spalding would be\nsevere enough upon the sounding brasses and the tinkling cymbals,\nand was quite content himself to be the Honourable Jonas G.\nSpalding,--Honourable because selected by his country for a post of\nhonour; but he liked to be heard among the cymbals and seen among\nthe brasses, and to feel that his position was as high as theirs. Mr.\nGlascock also was frequently in the same circles, and thus it came\nto pass that the two gentlemen saw each other almost daily. That Mr.\nSpalding knew well how to bear himself in his high place no one could\ndoubt; but he did not quite know how to carry himself before Mr.\nGlascock. At home at Boston he would have been more completely master\nof the situation.\n\nHe thought too that he began to perceive that Mr. Glascock avoided\nhim, though he would hear on his return home that that gentleman had\nbeen at the embassy, or had been walking in the Cascine with his\nnieces. That their young ladies should walk in public places with\nunmarried gentlemen is nothing to American fathers and guardians.\nAmerican young ladies are accustomed to choose their own companions.\nBut the minister was tormented by his doubts as to the ways of\nEnglishmen, and as to the phase in which English habits might most\nproperly exhibit themselves in Italy. He knew that people were\ntalking about Mr. Glascock and his niece. Why then did Mr. Glascock\navoid him? It was perhaps natural that Mr. Spalding should have\nomitted to observe that Mr. Glascock was not delighted by those\nlectures on the American constitution which formed so large a part of\nhis ordinary conversation with Englishmen.\n\nIt happened one afternoon that they were thrown together so closely\nfor nearly an hour that neither could avoid the other. They were both\nat the old palace in which the Italian parliament is held, and were\nkept waiting during some long delay in the ceremonies of the place.\nThey were seated next to each other, and during such delay there was\nnothing for them but to talk. On the other side of each of them was a\nstranger, and not to talk in such circumstances would be to quarrel.\nMr. Glascock began by asking after the ladies.\n\n\"They are quite well, sir, thank you,\" said the minister. \"I hope\nthat Lord Peterborough was pretty well when last you heard from\nNaples, Mr. Glascock.\" Mr. Glascock explained that his father's\ncondition was not much altered, and then there was silence for a\nmoment.\n\n\"Your nieces will remain with you through the spring I suppose?\" said\nMr. Glascock.\n\n\"Such is their intention, sir.\"\n\n\"They seem to like Florence, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes;--yes; I think they do like Florence. They see this capital,\nsir, perhaps under more favourable circumstances than are accorded\nto most of my countrywomen. Our republican simplicity, Mr. Glascock,\nhas this drawback, that away from home it subjects us somewhat to the\ncold shade of unobserved obscurity. That it possesses merits which\nmuch more than compensate for this trifling evil I should be the last\nman in Europe to deny.\" It is to be observed that American citizens\nare always prone to talk of Europe. It affords the best counterpoise\nthey know to that other term, America,--and America and the United\nStates are of course the same. To speak of France or of England as\nweighing equally against their own country seems to an American to be\nan absurdity,--and almost an insult to himself. With Europe he can\ncompare himself, but even this is done generally in the style of the\nRepublican Browning when she addressed the Ancient Marbles.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Mr. Glascock, \"the family of a minister\nabroad has great advantages in seeing the country to which he is\naccredited.\"\n\n\"That is my meaning, sir. But, as I was remarking, we carry with us\nas a people no external symbols of our standing at home. The wives\nand daughters, sir, of the most honoured of our citizens have no\nnomenclature different from that which belongs to the least noted\namong us. It is perhaps a consequence of this that Europeans who are\naccustomed in their social intercourse to the assistance of titles,\nwill not always trouble themselves to inquire who and what are the\nAmerican citizens who may sit opposite to them at table. I have\nknown, Mr. Glascock, the wife and daughter of a gentleman who has\nbeen thrice sent as senator from his native State to Washington,\nto remain as disregarded in the intercourse of a European city, as\nthough they had formed part of the family of some grocer from your\nRussell Square!\"\n\n\"Let the Miss Spaldings go where they will,\" said Mr. Glascock, \"they\nwill not fare in that way.\"\n\n\"The Miss Spaldings, sir, are very much obliged to you,\" said the\nminister with a bow.\n\n\"I regard it as one of the luckiest chances of my life that I was\nthrown in with them at St. Michael as I was,\" said Mr. Glascock with\nsomething like warmth.\n\n\"I am sure, sir, they will never forget the courtesy displayed by you\non that occasion,\" said the minister bowing again.\n\n\"That was a matter of course. I and my friend would have done the\nsame for the grocer's wife and daughter of whom you spoke. Little\nservices such as that do not come from appreciation of merit, but are\nsimply the payment of the debt due by all men to all women.\"\n\n\"Such is certainly the rule of living in our country, sir,\" said Mr.\nSpalding.\n\n\"The chances are,\" continued the Englishman, \"that no further\nobservation follows the payment of such a debt. It has been a thing\nof course.\"\n\n\"We delight to think it so, Mr. Glascock, in our own cities.\"\n\n\"But in this instance it has given rise to one of the pleasantest,\nand as I hope most enduring friendships that I have ever formed,\"\nsaid Mr. Glascock with enthusiasm. What could the American Minister\ndo but bow again three times? And what other meaning could he attach\nto such words than that which so many of his friends had been\nattributing to Mr. Glascock for some weeks past? It had occurred to\nMr. Spalding, even since he had been sitting in his present close\nproximity to Mr. Glascock, that it might possibly be his duty as an\nuncle having to deal with an Englishman, to ask that gentleman what\nwere his intentions. He would do his duty let it be what it might;\nbut the asking of such a question would be very disagreeable to him.\nFor the present he satisfied himself with inviting his neighbour to\ncome and drink tea with Mrs. Spalding on the next evening but one.\n\"The girls will be delighted, I am sure,\" said he, thinking himself\nto be justified in this friendly familiarity by Mr. Glascock's\nenthusiasm. For Mr. Spalding was clearly of opinion that, let the\nvalue of republican simplicity be what it might, an alliance with the\ncrumbling marbles of Europe would in his niece's circumstances be not\ninexpedient. Mr. Glascock accepted the invitation with alacrity, and\nthe minister when he was closeted with his wife that evening declared\nhis opinion that after all the Britisher meant fighting. The aunt\ntold the girls that Mr. Glascock was coming, and in order that it\nmight not seem that a net was being specially spread for him, others\nwere invited to join the party. Miss Petrie consented to be there,\nand the Italian, Count Buonarosci, to whose presence, though she\ncould not speak to him, Mrs. Spalding was becoming accustomed. It\nwas painful to her to feel that she could not communicate with those\naround her, and for that reason she would have avoided Italians. But\nshe had an idea that she could not thoroughly realise the advantages\nof foreign travel unless she lived with foreigners; and, therefore,\nshe was glad to become intimate at any rate with the outside of Count\nBuonarosci.\n\n\"I think your uncle is wrong, dear,\" said Miss Petrie early in the\nday to her friend.\n\n\"But why? He has done nothing more than what is just civil.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Glascock kept a store in Broadway he would not have thought\nit necessary to shew the same civility.\"\n\n\"Yes;--if we all liked the Mr. Glascock who kept the store.\"\n\n\"Caroline,\" said the poetess with severe eloquence, \"can you put your\nhand upon your heart and say that this inherited title, this tinkling\ncymbal as I call it, has no attraction for you or yours? Is it the\nunadorned simple man that you welcome to your bosom, or a thing of\nstars and garters, a patch of parchment, the minion of a throne,\nthe lordling of twenty descents, in which each has been weaker than\nthat before it, the hero of a scutcheon, whose glory is in his\nquarterings, and whose worldly wealth comes from the sweat of serfs\nwhom the euphonism of an effete country has learned to decorate with\nthe name of tenants?\"\n\nBut Caroline Spalding had a spirit of her own, and had already made\nup her mind that she would not be talked down by Miss Petrie. \"Uncle\nJonas,\" said she, \"asks him because we like him; and would do so\ntoo if he kept the store in Broadway. But if he did keep the store\nperhaps we should not like him.\"\n\n\"I trow not,\" said Miss Petrie.\n\nLivy was much more comfortable in her tactics, and without consulting\nanybody sent for a hairdresser. \"It's all very well for Wallachia,\"\nsaid Livy,--Miss Petrie's name was Wallachia,--\"but I know a nice\nsort of man when I see him, and the ways of the world are not to be\naltered because Wally writes poetry.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Glascock was announced Mrs. Spalding's handsome rooms were\nalmost filled, as rooms in Florence are filled,--obstruction in every\navenue, a crowd in every corner, and a block at every doorway, not\nbeing among the customs of the place. Mr. Spalding immediately caught\nhim,--intercepting him between the passages and the ladies,--and\nengaged him at once in conversation.\n\n\"Your John S. Mill is a great man,\" said the minister.\n\n\"They tell me so,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"I don't read what he writes\nmyself.\"\n\nThis acknowledgment seemed to the minister to be almost disgraceful,\nand yet he himself had never read a word of Mr. Mill's writings.\n\"He is a far-seeing man,\" continued the minister. \"He is one of\nthe few Europeans who can look forward, and see how the rivers of\ncivilization are running on. He has understood that women must at\nlast be put upon an equality with men.\"\n\n\"Can he manage that men shall have half the babies?\" said Mr.\nGlascock, thinking to escape by an attempt at playfulness.\n\nBut the minister was down upon him at once,--had him by the lappet\nof his coat, though he knew how important it was for his dear niece\nthat he should allow Mr. Glascock to amuse himself this evening after\nanother fashion. \"I have an answer ready, sir, for that difficulty,\"\nhe said. \"Step aside with me for a moment. The question is important,\nand I should be glad if you would communicate my ideas to your great\nphilosopher. Nature, sir, has laid down certain laws, which are\nimmutable; and, against them,--\"\n\nBut Mr. Glascock had not come to Florence for this. There were\ncircumstances in his present position which made him feel that he\nwould be gratified in escaping, even at the cost of some seeming\nincivility. \"I must go in to the ladies at once,\" he said, \"or I\nshall never get a word with them.\" There came across the minister's\nbrow a momentary frown of displeasure, as though he felt that he were\nbeing robbed of that which was justly his own. For an instant his\ngrasp fixed itself more tightly to the coat. It was quite within\nthe scope of his courage to hold a struggling listener by physical\nstrength;--but he remembered that there was a purpose, and he relaxed\nhis hold.\n\n\"I will take another opportunity,\" said the minister. \"As you have\nraised that somewhat trite objection of the bearing of children,\nwhich we in our country, sir, have altogether got over, I must put\nyou in possession of my views on that subject; but I will find\nanother occasion.\" Then Mr. Glascock began to reflect whether an\nAmerican lady, married in England, would probably want to see much of\nher uncle in her adopted country.\n\nMrs. Spalding was all smiles when her guest reached her. \"We did not\nmean to have such a crowd of people,\" she said, whispering; \"but you\nknow how one thing leads to another, and people here really like\nshort invitations.\" Then the minister's wife bowed very low to an\nItalian lady, and for the moment wished herself in Beacon Street. It\nwas a great trouble to her that she could not pluck up courage to\nspeak a word in Italian. \"I know more about it than some that are\nglib enough,\" she would say to her niece Livy, \"but these Tuscans are\nso particular with their Bocca Toscana.\"\n\nIt was almost spiteful on the part of Miss Petrie,--the manner in\nwhich, on this evening, she remained close to her friend Caroline\nSpalding. It is hardly possible to believe that it came altogether\nfrom high principle,--from a determination to save her friend from\nan impending danger. One's friend has no right to decide for one\nwhat is, and what is not dangerous. Mr. Glascock after awhile found\nhimself seated on a fixed couch, that ran along the wall, between\nCarry Spalding and Miss Petrie; but Miss Petrie was almost as bad\nto him as had been the minister himself. \"I am afraid,\" she said,\nlooking up into his face with some severity, and rushing upon her\nsubject with audacity, \"that the works of your Browning have not\nbeen received in your country with that veneration to which they are\nentitled.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Mr. or Mrs. Browning?\" asked Mr. Glascock,--perhaps with\nsome mistaken idea that the lady was out of her depth, and did not\nknow the difference.\n\n\"Either;--both; for they are one, the same, and indivisible. The\nspirit and germ of each is so reflected in the outcome of the other,\nthat one sees only the result of so perfect a combination, and one\nis tempted to acknowledge that here and there a marriage may have\nbeen arranged in Heaven. I don't think that in your country you have\nperceived this, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"I am not quite sure that we have,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"Yours is not altogether an inglorious mission,\" continued Miss\nPetrie.\n\n\"I've got no mission,\" said Mr. Glascock,--\"either from the Foreign\nOffice, or from my own inner convictions.\"\n\nMiss Petrie laughed with a scornful laugh. \"I spoke, sir, of the\nmission of that small speck on the earth's broad surface, of which\nyou think so much, and which we call Great Britain.\"\n\n\"I do think a good deal of it,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"It has been more thought of than any other speck of the same size,\"\nsaid Carry Spalding.\n\n\"True,\" said Miss Petrie, sharply;--\"because of its iron and coal.\nBut the mission I spoke of was this.\" And she put forth her hand with\nan artistic motion as she spoke. \"It utters prophecies, though it\ncannot read them. It sends forth truth, though it cannot understand\nit. Though its own ears are deaf as adders', it is the nursery of\npoets, who sing not for their own countrymen, but for the higher\nsensibilities and newer intelligences of lands, in which philanthropy\nhas made education as common as the air that is breathed.\"\n\n\"Wally,\" said Olivia, coming up to the poetess, in anger that was\nalmost apparent, \"I want to take you, and introduce you to the\nMarchesa Pulti.\"\n\nBut Miss Petrie no doubt knew that the eldest son of an English lord\nwas at least as good as an Italian marchesa. \"Let her come here,\"\nsaid the poetess, with her grandest smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nWITHERED GRASS.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nWhen Caroline Spalding perceived how direct an attempt had been made\nby her sister to take the poetess away, in order that she might\nthus be left alone with Mr. Glascock, her spirit revolted against\nthe manoeuvre, and she took herself away amidst the crowd. If Mr.\nGlascock should wish to find her again he could do so. And there came\nacross her mind something of a half-formed idea that, perhaps after\nall her friend Wallachia was right. Were this man ready to take her\nand she ready to be taken, would such an arrangement be a happy one\nfor both of them? His high-born, wealthy friends might very probably\ndespise her, and it was quite possible that she also might despise\nthem. To be Lady Peterborough, and have the spending of a large\nfortune, would not suffice for her happiness. She was sure of that.\nIt would be a leap in the dark, and all such leaps must needs be\ndangerous, and therefore should be avoided. But she did like the man.\nHer friend was untrue to her and cruel in those allusions to tinkling\ncymbals. It might be well for her to get over her liking, and to\nthink no more of one who was to her a foreigner and a stranger,--of\nwhose ways of living in his own home she knew so little, whose people\nmight be antipathetic to her, enemies instead of friends, among whom\nher life would be one long misery; but it was not on that ground\nthat Miss Petrie had recommended her to start for Rome as soon as\nMr. Glascock had reached Florence. \"There is no reason,\" she said to\nherself, \"why I should not marry a man if I like him, even though\nhe be a lord. And of him I should not be the least afraid. It's the\nwomen that I fear.\" And then she called to mind all that she had ever\nheard of English countesses and duchesses. She thought that she knew\nthat they were generally cold and proud, and very little given to\nreceive outsiders graciously within their ranks. Mr. Glascock had\nan aunt who was a Duchess, and a sister who would be a Countess.\nCaroline Spalding felt how her back would rise against these new\nrelations, if it should come to pass that they should look unkindly\nupon her when she was taken to her own home;--how she would fight\nwith them, giving them scorn for scorn; how unutterably miserable\nshe would be; how she would long to be back among her own equals, in\nspite even of her love for her husband. \"How grand a thing it is,\"\nshe said, \"to be equal with those whom you love!\" And yet she was to\nsome extent allured by the social position of the man. She could\nperceive that he had a charm of manner which her countrymen lacked.\nHe had read, perhaps, less than her uncle;--knew, perhaps, less than\nmost of those men with whom she had been wont to associate in her\nown city life at home;--was not braver, or more virtuous, or more\nself-denying than they; but there was a softness and an ease in\nhis manner which was palatable to her, and an absence of that too\nvisible effort of the intellect which is so apt to mark and mar\nthe conversation of Americans. She almost wished that she had been\nEnglish, in order that the man's home and friends might have suited\nher. She was thinking of all this as she stood pretending to talk to\nan American lady, who was very eloquent on the delights of Florence.\n\nIn the meantime Olivia and Mr. Glascock had moved away together, and\nMiss Petrie was left alone. This was no injury to Miss Petrie, as her\nmind at once set itself to work on a sonnet touching the frivolity\nof modern social gatherings; and when she complained afterwards to\nCaroline that it was the curse of their mode of life that no moment\ncould be allowed for thought,--in which she referred specially to a\nfew words that Mr. Gore had addressed to her at this moment of her\nmeditations,--she was not wilfully a hypocrite. She was painfully\nturning her second set of rhymes, and really believed that she had\nbeen subjected to a hardship. In the meantime Olivia and Mr. Glascock\nwere discussing her at a distance.\n\n\"You were being put through your facings, Mr. Glascock,\" Olivia had\nsaid.\n\n\"Well; yes; and your dear friend, Miss Petrie, is rather a stern\nexaminer.\"\n\n\"She is Carry's ally, not mine,\" said Olivia. Then she remembered\nthat by saying this she might be doing her sister an injury. Mr.\nGlascock might object to such a bosom friend for his wife. \"That is\nto say, of course we are all intimate with her, but just at this\nmoment Carry is most in favour.\"\n\n\"She is very clever, I am quite sure,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh yes;--she's a genius. You must not doubt that on the peril of\nmaking every American in Italy your enemy.\"\n\n\"She is a poet,--is she not?\"\n\n\"Mr. Glascock!\"\n\n\"Have I said anything wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do you mean to look me in the face and tell me that you are not\nacquainted with her works,--that you don't know pages of them by\nheart, that you don't sleep with them under your pillow, don't travel\nabout with them in your dressing-bag? I'm afraid we have mistaken\nyou, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"Is it so great a sin?\"\n\n\"If you'll own up honestly, I'll tell you something,--in a whisper.\nYou have not read a word of her poems?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"Neither have I. Isn't it horrible? But, perhaps, if I heard Tennyson\ntalking every day, I shouldn't read Tennyson. Familiarity does breed\ncontempt;--doesn't it? And then poor dear Wallachia is such a bore. I\nsometimes wonder, when English people are listening to her, whether\nthey think that American girls generally talk like that.\"\n\n\"Not all, perhaps, with that perfected eloquence.\"\n\n\"I dare say you do,\" continued Olivia, craftily. \"That is just the\nway in which people form their opinions about foreigners. Some\nspecially self-asserting American speaks his mind louder than other\npeople, and then you say that all Americans are self-asserting.\"\n\n\"But you are a little that way given, Miss Spalding.\"\n\n\"Because we are always called upon to answer accusations against\nus, expressed or unexpressed. We don't think ourselves a bit better\nthan you; or, if the truth were known, half as good. We are always\nstruggling to be as polished and easy as the French, or as sensible\nand dignified as the English; but when our defects are thrown in our\nteeth--\"\n\n\"Who throws them in your teeth, Miss Spalding?\"\n\n\"You look it,--all of you,--if you do not speak it out. You do assume\na superiority, Mr. Glascock; and that we cannot endure.\"\n\n\"I do not feel that I assume anything,\" said Mr. Glascock, meekly.\n\n\"If three gentlemen be together, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and an\nAmerican, is not the American obliged to be on his mettle to prove\nthat he is somebody among the three? I admit that he is always\nclaiming to be the first; but he does so only that he may not be too\nevidently the last. If you knew us, Mr. Glascock, you would find us\nto be very mild, and humble and nice, and good, and clever, and kind,\nand charitable, and beautiful,--in short, the finest people that have\nas yet been created on the broad face of God's smiling earth.\" These\nlast words she pronounced with a nasal twang, and in a tone of voice\nwhich almost seemed to him to be a direct mimicry of the American\nMinister. The upshot of the conversation, however, was that the\ndisgust against Americans which, to a certain degree, had been\nexcited in Mr. Glascock's mind by the united efforts of Mr. Spalding\nand the poetess, had been almost entirely dispelled. From all of\nwhich the reader ought to understand that Miss Olivia Spalding was a\nvery clever young woman.\n\nBut nevertheless Mr. Glascock had not quite made up his mind to ask\nthe elder sister to be his wife. He was one of those men to whom\nlove-making does not come very easy, although he was never so much at\nhis ease as when he was in company with ladies. He was sorely in want\nof a wife, but he was aware that at different periods during the last\nfifteen years he had been angled for as a fish. Mothers in England\nhad tried to catch him, and of such mothers he had come to have the\nstrongest possible detestation. He had seen the hooks,--or perhaps\nhad fancied that he saw them when they were not there. Lady Janes and\nLady Sarahs had been hard upon him, till he learned to buckle himself\ninto triple armour when he went amongst them, and yet he wanted\na wife;--no man more sorely wanted one. The reader will perhaps\nremember how he went down to Nuncombe Putney in quest of a wife, but\nall in vain. The lady in that case had been so explicit with him that\nhe could not hope for a more favourable answer; and, indeed, he would\nnot have cared to marry a girl who had told him that she preferred\nanother man to himself, even if it had been possible for him to do\nso. Now he had met a lady very different from those with whom he had\nhitherto associated,--but not the less manifestly a lady. Caroline\nSpalding was bright, pleasant, attractive, very easy to talk to, and\nyet quite able to hold her own. But the American Minister was--a\nbore; and Miss Petrie was--unbearable. He had often told himself that\nin this matter of marrying a wife he would please himself altogether,\nthat he would allow himself to be tied down by no consideration of\nfamily pride,--that he would consult nothing but his own heart and\nfeelings. As for rank, he could give that to his wife. As for money,\nhe had plenty of that also. He wanted a woman that was not blas\u00c3\u00a9e\nwith the world, that was not a fool, and who would respect him. The\nmore he thought of it, the more sure he was that he had seen none who\npleased him so well as Caroline Spalding; and yet he was a little\nafraid of taking a step that would be irrevocable. Perhaps the\nAmerican Minister might express a wish to end his days at Monkhams,\nand might think it desirable to have Miss Petrie always with him as a\nprivate secretary in poetry!\n\n\"Between you and us, Mr. Glascock, the spark of sympathy does not\npass with a strong flash,\" said a voice in his ear. As he turned\nround rapidly to face his foe, he was quite sure, for the moment,\nthat under no possible circumstances would he ever take an American\nwoman to his bosom as his wife.\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"no, no. I rather think that I agree with you.\"\n\n\"The antipathy is one,\" continued Miss Petrie, \"which has been\ncommon on the face of the earth since the clown first trod upon the\ncourtier's heels. It is the instinct of fallen man to hate equality,\nto desire ascendancy, to crush, to oppress, to tyrannise, to\nenslave. Then, when the slave is at last free, and in his freedom\ndemands--equality, man is not great enough to take his enfranchised\nbrother to his bosom.\"\n\n\"You mean negroes,\" said Mr. Glascock, looking round and planning for\nhimself a mode of escape.\n\n\"Not negroes only,--not the enslaved blacks, who are now enslaved no\nmore,--but the rising nations of white men wherever they are to be\nseen. You English have no sympathy with a people who claim to be at\nleast your equals. The clown has trod upon the courtier's heels till\nthe clown is clown no longer, and the courtier has hardly a court in\nwhich he may dangle his sword-knot.\"\n\n\"If so the clown might as well spare the courtier,\" not meaning the\nrebuke which his words implied.\n\n\"Ah--h,--but the clown will not spare the courtier, Mr. Glascock. I\nunderstand the gibe, and I tell you that the courtier shall be spared\nno longer;--because he is useless. He shall be cut down together with\nthe withered grasses and thrown into the oven, and there shall be an\nend of him.\" Then she turned round to appeal to an American gentleman\nwho had joined them, and Mr. Glascock made his escape. \"I hold it to\nbe the holiest duty which I owe to my country never to spare one of\nthem when I meet him.\"\n\n\"They are all very well in their way,\" said the American gentleman.\n\n\"Down with them, down with them!\" exclaimed the poetess, with a\nbeautiful enthusiasm. In the meantime Mr. Glascock had made up his\nmind that he could not dare to ask Caroline Spalding to be his wife.\nThere were certain forms of the American female so dreadful that no\nwise man would wilfully come in contact with them. Miss Petrie's\nferocity was distressing to him, but her eloquence and enthusiasm\nwere worse even than her ferocity. The personal incivility of which\nshe had been guilty in calling him a withered grass was distasteful\nto him, as being opposed to his ideas of the customs of society; but\nwhat would be his fate if his wife's chosen friend should be for ever\ndinning her denunciation of withered grasses into his ear?\n\nHe was still thinking of all this when he was accosted by Mrs.\nSpalding. \"Are you going to dear Lady Banbury's to-morrow?\" she\nasked. Lady Banbury was the wife of the English Minister.\n\n\"I suppose I shall be there in the course of the evening.\"\n\n\"How very nice she is; is she not? I do like Lady Banbury;--so soft,\nand gentle, and kind.\"\n\n\"One of the pleasantest old ladies I know,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"It does not strike you so much as it does me,\" said Mrs. Spalding,\nwith one of her sweetest smiles. \"The truth is, we all value what\nwe have not got. There are no Lady Banburys in our country, and\ntherefore we think the more of them when we meet them here. She is\ntalking of going to Rome for the Carnival, and has asked Caroline\nto go with her. I am so pleased to find that my dear girl is such a\nfavourite.\"\n\nMr. Glascock immediately told himself that he saw the hook. If he\nwere to be fished for by this American aunt as he had been fished\nfor by English mothers, all his pleasure in the society of Caroline\nSpalding would be at once over. It would be too much, indeed, if\nin this American household he were to find the old vices of an\naristocracy superadded to young republican sins! Nevertheless Lady\nBanbury was, as he knew well, a person whose opinion about young\npeople was supposed to be very good. She noticed those only who were\nworthy of notice; and to have been taken by the hand by Lady Banbury\nwas acknowledged to be a passport into good society. If Caroline\nSpalding was in truth going to Rome with Lady Banbury, that fact\nwas in itself a great confirmation of Mr. Glascock's good opinion\nof her. Mrs. Spalding had perhaps understood this; but had not\nunderstood that having just hinted that it was so, she should have\nabstained from saying a word more about her dear girl. Clever and\nwell-practised must, indeed, be the hand of the fisherwoman in\nmatrimonial waters who is able to throw her fly without showing\nany glimpse of the hook to the fish for whom she angles. Poor Mrs.\nSpalding, though with kindly instincts towards her niece she did on\nthis occasion make some slight attempt at angling, was innocent of\nany concerted plan. It seemed to her to be so natural to say a good\nword in praise of her niece to the man whom she believed to be in\nlove with her niece.\n\nCaroline and Mr. Glascock did not meet each other again till late in\nthe evening, and just as he was about to take his leave. As they came\ntogether each of them involuntarily looked round to see whether Miss\nPetrie was near. Had she been there nothing would have been said\nbeyond the shortest farewell greeting. But Miss Petrie was afar\noff, electrifying some Italian by the vehemence of her sentiments,\nand the audacious volubility of a language in which all arbitrary\nrestrictions were ignored. \"Are you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well;--I believe I am. Since I saw you last I've encountered Miss\nPetrie again, and I'm rather depressed.\"\n\n\"Ah;--you don't know her. If you did you wouldn't laugh at her.\"\n\n\"Laugh at her! Indeed I do not do that; but when I'm told that I'm to\nbe thrown into the oven and burned because I'm such a worn-out old\ninstitution--\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that you mind that!\"\n\n\"Not much, when it comes up in the ordinary course of conversation;\nbut it palls upon one when it is asserted for the fourth or fifth\ntime in an evening.\"\n\n\"Alas, alas!\" exclaimed Miss Spalding, with mock energy.\n\n\"And why, alas?\"\n\n\"Because it is so impossible to make the oil and vinegar of the old\nworld and of the new mix together and suit each other.\"\n\n\"You think it is impossible, Miss Spalding?\"\n\n\"I fear so. We are so terribly tender, and you are always pinching us\non our most tender spot. And we never meet you without treading on\nyour gouty toes.\"\n\n\"I don't think my toes are gouty,\" said he.\n\n\"I apologise to your own, individually, Mr. Glascock; but I must\nassert that nationally you are subject to the gout.\"\n\n\"That is, when I'm told over and over again that I'm to be cut down\nand thrown into the oven--\"\n\n\"Never mind the oven now, Mr. Glascock. If my friend has been\nover-zealous I will beg pardon for her. But it does seem to me,\nindeed it does, with all the reverence and partiality I have\nfor everything European,\"--the word European was an offence to\nhim, and he shewed that it was so by his countenance,--\"that the\nidiosyncrasies of you and of us are so radically different, that\nwe cannot be made to amalgamate and sympathise with each other\nthoroughly.\"\n\nHe paused for some seconds before he answered her, but it was so\nevident by his manner that he was going to speak, that she could\nneither leave him nor interrupt him. \"I had thought that it might\nhave been otherwise,\" he said at last, and the tone of his voice was\nso changed as to make her know that he was in earnest.\n\nBut she did not change her voice by a single note. \"I'm afraid it\ncannot be so,\" she said, speaking after her old fashion--half in\nearnest, half in banter. \"We may make up our minds to be very civil\nto each other when we meet. The threats of the oven may no doubt be\ndropped on our side, and you may abstain from expressing in words\nyour sense of our inferiority.\"\n\n\"I never expressed anything of the kind,\" he said, quite in anger.\n\n\"I am taking you simply as the sample Englishman, not as Mr.\nGlascock, who helped me and my sister over the mountains. Such of\nus as have to meet in society may agree to be very courteous; but\ncourtesy and cordiality are not only not the same, but they are\nincompatible.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Courtesy is an effort, and cordiality is free. I must be allowed\nto contradict the friend that I love; but I assent,--too often\nfalsely,--to what is said to me by a passing acquaintance. In spite\nof what the Scripture says, I think it is one of the greatest\nprivileges of a brother that he may call his brother a fool.\"\n\n\"Shall you desire to call your husband a fool?\"\n\n\"My husband!\"\n\n\"He will, I suppose, be at least as dear to you as a brother?\"\n\n\"I never had a brother.\"\n\n\"Your sister, then! It is the same, I suppose?\"\n\n\"If I were to have a husband, I hope he would be the dearest to me\nof all. Unless he were so, he certainly would not be my husband. But\nbetween a man and his wife there does not spring up that playful,\nviolent intimacy admitting of all liberties, which comes from early\nnursery associations; and then, there is the difference of sex.\"\n\n\"I should not like my wife to call me a fool,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope she may never have occasion to do so, Mr. Glascock. Marry an\nEnglish wife in your own class,--as, of course, you will,--and then\nyou will be safe.\"\n\n\"But I have set my heart fast on marrying an American wife,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I can't tell what may befall you. It's like enough, if you do\nthat, that you may be called by some name you will think hard to\nbear. But you'll think better of it. Like should pair with like, Mr.\nGlascock. If you were to marry one of our young women, you would lose\nin dignity as much as she would lose in comfort.\" Then they parted,\nand she went off to say farewell to other guests. The manner in which\nshe had answered what he had said to her had certainly been of a\nnature to stop any further speech of the same kind. Had she been\ngentle with him, then he would certainly have told her that she was\nthe American woman whom he desired to take with him to his home in\nEngland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nDOROTHY'S FATE.\n\n\nTowards the end of February Sir Peter Mancrudy declared Miss Stanbury\nto be out of danger, and Mr. Martin began to be sprightly on the\nsubject, taking to himself no inconsiderable share of the praise\naccruing to the medical faculty in Exeter generally for the saving of\na life so valuable to the city. \"Yes, Mr. Burgess,\" Sir Peter said\nto old Barty of the bank, \"our friend will get over it this time,\nand without any serious damage to her constitution, if she will only\ntake care of herself.\" Barty made some inaudible grunt, intended\nto indicate his own indifference on the subject, and expressed his\nopinion to the chief clerk that old Jemima Wideawake,--as he was\npleased to call her,--was one of those tough customers who would\nnever die. \"It would be nothing to us, Mr. Barty, one way or the\nother,\" said the clerk; to which Barty Burgess assented with another\ngrunt.\n\nCamilla French declared that she was delighted to hear the news. At\nthis time there had been some sort of a reconciliation between her\nand her lover. Mrs. French had extracted from him a promise that he\nwould not go to Natal; and Camilla had commenced the preparations for\nher wedding. His visits to Heavitree were as few and far between as\nhe could make them with any regard to decency; but the 31st of March\nwas coming on quickly, and as he was to be made a possession of them\nfor ever, it was considered to be safe and well to allow him some\nliberty in his present condition. \"My dear, if they are driven, there\nis no knowing what they won't do,\" Mrs. French said to her daughter.\nCamilla had submitted with compressed lips and a slight nod of her\nhead. She had worked very hard, but her day of reward was coming. It\nwas impossible not to perceive,--both for her and her mother,--that\nthe scantiness of Mr. Gibson's attention to his future bride was\ncause of some weak triumph to Arabella. She said that it was very odd\nthat he did not come,--and once added with a little sigh that he used\nto come in former days, alluding to those happy days in which another\nlove was paramount. Camilla could not endure this with an equal mind.\n\"Bella, dear,\" she said, \"we know what all that means. He has made\nhis choice, and if I am satisfied with what he does now, surely you\nneed not grumble.\" Miss Stanbury's illness had undoubtedly been a\ngreat source of contentment to the family at Heavitree, as they had\nall been able to argue that her impending demise was the natural\nconsequence of her great sin in the matter of Dorothy's proposed\nmarriage. When, however, they heard from Mr. Martin that she would\ncertainly recover, that Sir Peter's edict to that effect had gone\nforth, they were willing to acknowledge that Providence, having so\nfar punished the sinner, was right in staying its hand and abstaining\nfrom the final blow. \"I'm sure we are delighted,\" said Mrs. French,\n\"for though she has said cruel things of us,--and so untrue too,--yet\nof course it is our duty to forgive her. And we do forgive her.\"\n\nDorothy had written three or four notes to Brooke since his\ndeparture, which contained simple bulletins of her aunt's health.\nShe always began her letters with \"My dear Mr. Burgess,\" and ended\nthem with \"yours truly.\" She never made any allusion to Brooke's\ndeclaration of love, or gave the slightest sign in her letters to\nshew that she even remembered it. At last she wrote to say that her\naunt was convalescent; and, in making this announcement, she allowed\nherself some enthusiasm of expression. She was so happy, and was so\nsure that Mr. Burgess would be equally so! And her aunt had asked\nafter her \"dear Brooke,\" expressing her great satisfaction with\nhim, in that he had come down to see her when she had been almost\ntoo ill to see any one. In answer to this there came to her a real\nlove-letter from Brooke Burgess. It was the first occasion on\nwhich he had written to her. The little bulletins had demanded no\nreplies, and had received none. Perhaps there had been a shade of\ndisappointment on Dorothy's side, in that she had written thrice, and\nhad been made rich with no word in return. But, although her heart\nhad palpitated on hearing the postman's knock, and had palpitated in\nvain, she had told herself that it was all as it should be. She wrote\nto him, because she possessed information which it was necessary that\nshe should communicate. He did not write to her, because there was\nnothing for him to tell. Then had come the love-letter, and in the\nlove-letter there was an imperative demand for a reply.\n\nWhat was she to do? To have recourse to Priscilla for advice was\nher first idea; but she herself believed that she owed a debt\nof gratitude to her aunt, which Priscilla would not take into\naccount,--the existence of which Priscilla would by no means\nadmit. She knew Priscilla's mind in this matter, and was sure that\nPriscilla's advice, whatever it might be, would be given without any\nregard to her aunt's views. And then Dorothy was altogether ignorant\nof her aunt's views. Her aunt had been very anxious that she should\nmarry Mr. Gibson, but had clearly never admitted into her mind the\nidea that she might possibly marry Brooke Burgess; and it seemed to\nher that she herself would be dishonest, both to her aunt and to her\nlover, if she were to bind this man to herself without her aunt's\nknowledge. He was to be her aunt's heir, and she was maintained by\nher aunt's liberality! Thinking of all this, she at last resolved\nthat she would take the bull by the horns, and tell her aunt. She\nfelt that the task would be one almost beyond her strength. Thrice\nshe went into her aunt's room, intending to make a clean breast.\nThrice her courage failed her, and she left the room with her tale\nuntold, excusing herself on various pretexts. Her aunt had seemed to\nbe not quite so well, or had declared herself to be tired, or had\nbeen a little cross;--or else Martha had come in at the nick of time.\nBut there was Brooke Burgess's letter unanswered,--a letter that was\nread night and morning, and which was never for an instant out of her\nmind. He had demanded a reply, and he had a right at least to that.\nThe letter had been with her for four entire days before she had\nventured to speak to her aunt on the subject.\n\nOn the first of March Miss Stanbury came out of her bed-room for the\nfirst time. Dorothy, on the previous day, had decided on postponing\nher communication for this occasion; but, when she found herself\nsitting in the little sitting-room up-stairs close at her aunt's\nelbow, and perceived the signs of weakness which the new move had\nmade conspicuous, and heard the invalid declare that the little\njourney had been almost too much for her, her heart misgave her. She\nought to have told her tale while her aunt was still in bed. But\npresently there came a question, which put her into such a flutter\nthat she was for the time devoid of all resolution. \"Has Brooke\nwritten?\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Yes,--aunt; he has written.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\" Dorothy was struck quite dumb. \"Is there\nanything wrong?\" And now, as Miss Stanbury asked the question, she\nseemed herself to have forgotten that she had two minutes before\ndeclared herself to be almost too feeble to speak. \"I'm sure there is\nsomething wrong. What is it? I will know.\"\n\n\"There is nothing wrong, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Where is the letter? Let me see it.\"\n\n\"I mean there is nothing wrong about him.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"He is quite well, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Shew me the letter. I will see the letter. I know that there is\nsomething the matter. Do you mean to say you won't shew me Brooke's\nletter?\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause before Dorothy answered. \"I will shew you\nhis letter;--though I am sure he didn't mean that I should shew it to\nanyone.\"\n\n\"He hasn't written evil of me?\"\n\n\"No; no; no. He would sooner cut his hand off than say a word bad\nof you. He never says or writes anything bad of anybody. But--. Oh,\naunt; I'll tell you everything. I should have told you before, only\nthat you were ill.\"\n\nThen Miss Stanbury was frightened. \"What is it?\" she said hoarsely,\nclasping the arms of the great chair, each with a thin, shrivelled\nhand.\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury, Brooke,--Brooke,--wants me to be his--wife!\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"Brooke wants me to be his wife.\"]\n\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"You cannot be more surprised than I have been, Aunt Stanbury; and\nthere has been no fault of mine.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the old woman.\n\n\"Now you may read the letter,\" said Dorothy, standing up. She was\nquite prepared to be obedient, but she felt that her aunt's manner of\nreceiving the information was almost an insult.\n\n\"He must be a fool,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\nThis was hard to bear, and the colour went and came rapidly across\nDorothy's cheeks as she gave herself a few moments to prepare an\nanswer. She already perceived that her aunt would be altogether\nadverse to the marriage, and that therefore the marriage could never\ntake place. She had never for a moment allowed herself to think\notherwise, but, nevertheless, the blow was heavy on her. We all know\nhow constantly hope and expectation will rise high within our own\nbosoms in opposition to our own judgment,--how we become sanguine\nin regard to events which we almost know can never come to pass. So\nit had been with Dorothy. Her heart had been almost in a flutter of\nhappiness since she had had Brooke's letter in her possession, and\nyet she never ceased to declare to herself her own conviction that\nthat letter could lead to no good result. In regard to her own wishes\non the subject she had never asked herself a single question. As it\nhad been quite beyond her power to bring herself to endure the idea\nof marrying Mr. Gibson, so it had been quite impossible to her not\nto long to be Brooke's wife from the moment in which a suggestion to\nthat effect had fallen from his lips. This was a state of things so\ncertain, so much a matter of course, that, though she had not spoken\na word to him in which she owned her love, she had never for a moment\ndoubted that he knew the truth,--and that everybody else concerned\nwould know it too. But she did not suppose that her wishes would go\nfor anything with her aunt. Brooke Burgess was to become a rich man\nas her aunt's heir, and her aunt would of course have her own ideas\nabout Brooke's advancement in life. She was quite prepared to submit\nwithout quarrelling when her aunt should tell her that the idea must\nnot be entertained. But the order might be given, the prohibition\nmight be pronounced, without an insult to her own feelings as a\nwoman. \"He must be a fool,\" Miss Stanbury had said, and Dorothy took\ntime to collect her thoughts before she would reply. In the meantime\nher aunt finished the reading of the letter.\n\n\"He may be foolish in this,\" Dorothy said; \"but I don't think you\nshould call him a fool.\"\n\n\"I shall call him what I please. I suppose this was going on at the\ntime when you refused Mr. Gibson.\"\n\n\"Nothing was going on. Nothing has gone on at all,\" said Dorothy,\nwith as much indignation as she was able to assume.\n\n\"How can you tell me that? That is an untruth.\"\n\n\"It is not--an untruth,\" said Dorothy, almost sobbing, but driven at\nthe same time to much anger.\n\n\"Do you mean to say that this is the first you ever heard of it?\" And\nshe held out the letter, shaking it in her thin hand.\n\n\"I have never said so, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did.\"\n\n\"I said that nothing--was--going on, when Mr. Gibson--was--. If you\nchoose to suspect me, Aunt Stanbury, I'll go away. I won't stay here\nif you suspect me. When Brooke spoke to me, I told him you wouldn't\nlike it.\"\n\n\"Of course I don't like it.\" But she gave no reason why she did not\nlike it.\n\n\"And there was nothing more till this letter came. I couldn't help\nhis writing to me. It wasn't my fault.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"If you are angry, I am very sorry. But you haven't a right to be\nangry.\"\n\n\"Go on, Dorothy; go on. I'm so weak that I can hardly stir myself;\nit's the first moment that I've been out of my bed for weeks;--and of\ncourse you can say what you please. I know what it will be. I shall\nhave to take to my bed again, and then,--in a very little time,--you\ncan both--make fools of yourselves,--just as you like.\"\n\nThis was an argument against which Dorothy of course found it to be\nquite impossible to make continued combat. She could only shuffle her\nletter back into her pocket, and be, if possible, more assiduous than\never in her attentions to the invalid. She knew that she had been\ntreated most unjustly, and there would be a question to be answered\nas soon as her aunt should be well as to the possibility of her\nremaining in the Close subject to such injustice; but let her aunt\nsay what she might, or do what she might, Dorothy could not leave\nher for the present. Miss Stanbury sat for a considerable time quite\nmotionless, with her eyes closed, and did not stir or make signs of\nlife till Dorothy touched her arm, asking her whether she would not\ntake some broth which had been prepared for her. \"Where's Martha? Why\ndoes not Martha come?\" said Miss Stanbury. This was a hard blow, and\nfrom that moment Dorothy believed that it would be expedient that\nshe should return to Nuncombe Putney. The broth, however, was taken,\nwhile Dorothy sat by in silence. Only one word further was said that\nevening by Miss Stanbury about Brooke and his love affair. \"There\nmust be nothing more about this, Dorothy; remember that; nothing at\nall. I won't have it.\" Dorothy made no reply. Brooke's letter was in\nher pocket, and it should be answered that night. On the following\nday she would let her aunt know what she had said to Brooke. Her aunt\nshould not see the letter, but should be made acquainted with its\npurport in reference to Brooke's proposal of marriage.\n\n\"I won't have it!\" That had been her aunt's command. What right had\nher aunt to give any command upon the matter? Then crossed Dorothy's\nmind, as she thought of this, a glimmering of an idea that no one can\nbe entitled to issue commands who cannot enforce obedience. If Brooke\nand she chose to become man and wife by mutual consent, how could her\naunt prohibit the marriage? Then there followed another idea, that\ncommands are enforced by the threatening and, if necessary, by the\nenforcement of penalties. Her aunt had within her hand no penalty of\nwhich Dorothy was afraid on her own behalf; but she had the power\nof inflicting a terrible punishment on Brooke Burgess. Now Dorothy\nconceived that she herself would be the meanest creature alive if she\nwere actuated by fears as to money in her acceptance or rejection of\na man whom she loved as she did Brooke Burgess. Brooke had an income\nof his own which seemed to her to be ample for all purposes. But that\nwhich would have been sordid in her, did not seem to her to have any\nstain of sordidness for him. He was a man, and was bound to be rich\nif he could. And, moreover, what had she to offer in herself,--such a\npoor thing as was she,--to make compensation to him for the loss of\nfortune? Her aunt could inflict this penalty, and therefore the power\nwas hers, and the power must be obeyed. She would write to Brooke in\na manner that should convey to him her firm decision. But not the\nless on that account would she let her aunt know that she thought\nherself to have been ill-used. It was an insult to her, a most\nill-natured insult,--that telling her that Brooke had been a fool\nfor loving her. And then that accusation against her of having been\nfalse, of having given one reason for refusing Mr. Gibson, while\nthere was another reason in her heart,--of having been cunning and\nthen untrue, was not to be endured. What would her aunt think of her\nif she were to bear such allegations without indignant protest? She\nwould write her letter, and speak her mind to her aunt as soon as her\naunt should be well enough to hear it.\n\nAs she had resolved, she wrote her letter that night before she went\nto bed. She wrote it with floods of tears, and a bitterness of heart\nwhich almost conquered her. She too had heard of love, and had been\ntaught to feel that the success or failure of a woman's life depended\nupon that,--whether she did, or whether she did not, by such gifts\nas God might have given to her, attract to herself some man strong\nenough, and good enough, and loving enough to make straight for her\nher paths, to bear for her her burdens, to be the father of her\nchildren, the staff on which she might lean, and the wall against\nwhich she might grow, feeling the sunshine, and sheltered from the\nwind. She had ever estimated her own value so lowly as to have told\nherself often that such success could never come in her way. From her\nearliest years she had regarded herself as outside the pale within\nwhich such joys are to be found. She had so strictly taught herself\nto look forward to a blank existence, that she had learned to do so\nwithout active misery. But not the less did she know where happiness\nlay; and when the good thing came almost within her reach, when it\nseemed that God had given her gifts which might have sufficed, when\na man had sought her hand whose nature was such that she could have\nleaned on him with a true worship, could have grown against him as\nagainst a wall with perfect confidence, could have lain with her head\nupon his bosom, and have felt that of all spots that in the world was\nthe most fitting for her,--when this was all but grasped, and must\nyet be abandoned, there came upon her spirit an agony so bitter\nthat she had not before known how great might be the depth of human\ndisappointment. But the letter was at last written, and when finished\nwas as follows:--\n\n\n   The Close, Exeter, March 1, 186--.\n\n   DEAR BROOKE,\n\n\nThere had been many doubts about this; but at last they were\nconquered, and the name was written.\n\n\n   I have shown your letter to my aunt, as I am sure you will\n   think was best. I should have answered it before, only\n   that I thought that she was not quite well enough to talk\n   about it. She says, as I was sure she would, that what you\n   propose is quite out of the question. I am aware that I\n   am bound to obey her; and as I think that you also ought\n   to do so, I shall think no more of what you have said to\n   me and have written. It is quite impossible now, even if\n   it might have been possible under other circumstances. I\n   shall always remember your great kindness to me. Perhaps\n   I ought to say that I am very grateful for the compliment\n   you have paid me. I shall think of you always;--till I\n   die.\n\n   Believe me to be,\n   Your very sincere friend,\n\n   DOROTHY STANBURY.\n\n\nThe next day Miss Stanbury again came out of her room, and on the\nthird day she was manifestly becoming stronger. Dorothy had as yet\nnot spoken of her letter, but was prepared to do so as soon as she\nthought that a fitting opportunity had come. She had a word or two to\nsay for herself; but she must not again subject herself to being told\nthat she was taking her will of her aunt because her aunt was too ill\nto defend herself. But on the third day Miss Stanbury herself asked\nthe question. \"Have you written anything to Brooke?\" she asked.\n\n\"I have answered his letter, Aunt Stanbury.\"\n\n\"And what have you said to him?\"\n\n\"I have told him that you disapproved of it, and that nothing more\nmust be said about it.\"\n\n\"Yes;--of course you made me out to be an ogre.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that, aunt. I am sure that I told him\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"May I see the letter?\"\n\n\"It has gone.\"\n\n\"But you have kept a copy,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Yes; I have got a copy,\" replied Dorothy; \"but I would rather not\nshew it. I told him just what I tell you.\"\n\n\"Dorothy, it is not at all becoming that you should have a\ncorrespondence with any young man of such a nature that you should be\nashamed to shew it to your aunt.\"\n\n\"I am not ashamed of anything,\" said Dorothy sturdily.\n\n\"I don't know what young women in these days have come to,\" continued\nMiss Stanbury. \"There is no respect, no subjection, no obedience, and\ntoo often--no modesty.\"\n\n\"Does that mean me, Aunt Stanbury?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, Dorothy, I don't think you ought to have\nbeen receiving love-letters from Brooke Burgess when I was lying ill\nin bed. I didn't expect it of you. I tell you fairly that I didn't\nexpect it of you.\"\n\nThen Dorothy spoke out her mind. \"As you think that, Aunt Stanbury,\nI had better go away. And if you please I will,--when you are well\nenough to spare me.\"\n\n\"Pray don't think of me at all,\" said her aunt.\n\n\"And as for love-letters,--Mr. Burgess has written to me once. I\ndon't think that there can be anything immodest in opening a letter\nwhen it comes by the post. And as soon as I had it I determined to\nshew it to you. As for what happened before, when Mr. Burgess spoke\nto me, which was long, long after all that about Mr. Gibson was over,\nI told him that it couldn't be so; and I thought there would be no\nmore about it. You were so ill that I could not tell you. Now you\nknow it all.\"\n\n\"I have not seen your letter to him.\"\n\n\"I shall never shew it to anybody. But you have said things, Aunt\nStanbury, that are very cruel.\"\n\n\"Of course! Everything I say is wrong.\"\n\n\"You have told me that I was telling untruths, and you have called\nme--immodest. That is a terrible word.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't deserve it then.\"\n\n\"I never have deserved it, and I won't bear it. No; I won't. If Hugh\nheard me called that word, I believe he'd tear the house down.\"\n\n\"Hugh, indeed! He's to be brought in between us;--is he?\"\n\n\"He's my brother, and of course I'm obliged to think of him. And if\nyou please, I'll go home as soon as you are well enough to spare me.\"\n\nQuickly after this there were very many letters coming and going\nbetween the house in the Close and the ladies at Nuncombe Putney, and\nHugh Stanbury and Brooke Burgess. The correspondent of Brooke Burgess\nwas of course Miss Stanbury herself. The letters to Hugh and to\nNuncombe Putney were written by Dorothy. Of the former we need be\ntold nothing at the present moment; but the upshot of all poor\nDolly's letters was, that on the tenth of March she was to return\nhome to Nuncombe Putney, share once more her sister's bed and\nmother's poverty, and abandon the comforts of the Close. Before\nthis became a definite arrangement Miss Stanbury had given way in a\ncertain small degree. She had acknowledged that Dorothy had intended\nno harm. But this was not enough for Dorothy, who was conscious of\nno harm either done or intended. She did not specify her terms, or\nrequire specifically that her aunt should make apology for that word\nimmodest, or at least withdraw it; but she resolved that she would go\nunless it was most absolutely declared to have been applied to her\nwithout the slightest reason. She felt, moreover, that her aunt's\nhouse ought to be open to Brooke Burgess, and that it could not be\nopen to them both. And so she went;--having resided under her aunt's\nroof between nine and ten months.\n\n\"Good-bye, Aunt Stanbury,\" said Dorothy, kissing her aunt, with a\ntear in her eye and a sob in her throat.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear, good-bye.\" And Miss Stanbury, as she pressed her\nniece's hand, left in it a bank-note.\n\n\"I'm much obliged, aunt; I am indeed; but I'd rather not.\" And the\nbank-note was left on the parlour table.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nDOROTHY AT HOME.\n\n\nDorothy was received at home with so much affection and such\nexpressions of esteem as to afford her much consolation in her\nmisery. Both her mother and her sister approved of her conduct.\nMrs. Stanbury's approval was indeed accompanied by many expressions\nof regret as to the good things lost. She was fully alive to the\nfact that life in the Close at Exeter was better for her daughter\nthan life in their little cottage at Nuncombe Putney. The outward\nappearance which Dorothy bore on her return home was proof of this.\nHer clothes, the set of her hair, her very gestures and motions had\nframed themselves on town ideas. The faded, wildered, washed-out\nlook, the uncertain, purposeless bearing which had come from her\nsecluded life and subjection to her sister had vanished from her.\nShe had lived among people, and had learned something of their gait\nand carriage. Money we know will do almost everything, and no doubt\nmoney had had much to do with this. It is very pretty to talk of the\nalluring simplicity of a clean calico gown; but poverty will shew\nitself to be meagre, dowdy, and draggled in a woman's dress, let\nthe woman be ever so simple, ever so neat, ever so independent, and\never so high-hearted. Mrs. Stanbury was quite alive to all that her\nyounger daughter was losing. Had she not received two offers of\nmarriage while she was at Exeter? There was no possibility that\noffers of marriage should be made in the cottage at Nuncombe Putney.\nA man within the walls of the cottage would have been considered as\nmuch out of place as a wild bull. It had been matter of deep regret\nto Mrs. Stanbury that her daughter should not have found herself able\nto marry Mr. Gibson. She knew that there was no matter for reproach\nin this, but it was a misfortune,--a great misfortune. And in the\nmother's breast there had been a sad, unrepressed feeling of regret\nthat young people should so often lose their chances in the world\nthrough over-fancifulness, and ignorance as to their own good. Now\nwhen she heard the story of Brooke Burgess, she could not but think\nthat had Dorothy remained at Exeter, enduring patiently such hard\nwords as her aunt might speak, the love affair might have been\nbrought at some future time to a happy conclusion. She did not say\nall this; but there came on her a silent melancholy, made expressive\nby constant little shakings of the head and a continued reproachful\nsadness of demeanour, which was quite as intelligible to Priscilla\nas would have been any spoken words. But Priscilla's approval of her\nsister's conduct was clear, outspoken, and satisfactory. She had been\nquite sure that her sister had been right about Mr. Gibson; and was\nequally sure that she was now right about Brooke Burgess. Priscilla\nhad in her mind an idea that if B. B., as they called him, was half\nas good as her sister represented him to be,--for indeed Dorothy\nendowed him with every virtue consistent with humanity,--he would\nnot be deterred from his pursuit either by Dolly's letter or by Aunt\nStanbury's commands. But of this she thought it wise to say nothing.\nShe paid Dolly the warm and hitherto unaccustomed compliment of\nequality, assuming to regard her sister's judgment and persistent\nindependence to be equally strong with her own; and, as she knew\nwell, she could not have gone further than this. \"I never shall agree\nwith you about Aunt Stanbury,\" she said. \"To me she seems to be so\nimperious, so exacting, and also so unjust, as to be unbearable.\"\n\n\"But she is affectionate,\" said Dolly.\n\n\"So is the dog that bites you, and, for aught I know, the horse that\nkicks you. But it is ill living with biting dogs and kicking horses.\nBut all that matters little as you are still your own mistress. How\nstrange these nine months have been, with you in Exeter, while we\nhave been at the Clock House. And here we are, together again in the\nold way, just as though nothing had happened.\" But Dorothy knew well\nthat a great deal had happened, and that her life could never be as\nit had been heretofore. The very tone in which her sister spoke to\nher was proof of this. She had an infinitely greater possession in\nherself than had belonged to her before her residence at Exeter; but\nthat possession was so heavily mortgaged and so burthened as to make\nher believe that the change was to be regretted.\n\nAt the end of the first week there came a letter from Aunt Stanbury\nto Dorothy. It began by saying that Dolly had left behind her certain\nsmall properties which had now been made up in a parcel and sent by\nthe railway, carriage paid. \"But they weren't mine at all,\" said\nDolly, alluding to certain books in which she had taken delight. \"She\nmeans to give them to you,\" said Priscilla, \"and I think you must\ntake them.\" \"And the shawl is no more mine than it is yours, though\nI wore it two or three times in the winter.\" Priscilla was of opinion\nthat the shawl must be taken also. Then the letter spoke of the\nwriter's health, and at last fell into such a strain of confidential\ngossip that Mrs. Stanbury, when she read it, could not understand\nthat there had been a quarrel. \"Martha says that she saw Camilla\nFrench in the street to-day, such a guy in her new finery as never\nwas seen before except on May-day.\" Then in the postscript Dorothy\nwas enjoined to answer this letter quickly. \"None of your short\nscraps, my dear,\" said Aunt Stanbury.\n\n\"She must mean you to go back to her,\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"No doubt she does,\" said Priscilla; \"but Dolly need not go because\nmy aunt means it. We are not her creatures.\"\n\nBut Dorothy answered her aunt's letter in the spirit in which it had\nbeen written. She asked after her aunt's health, thanked her aunt for\nthe gift of the books,--in each of which her name had been clearly\nwritten,--protested about the shawl, sent her love to Martha and her\nkind regards to Jane, and expressed a hope that C. F. enjoyed her new\nclothes. She described the cottage, and was funny about the cabbage\nstumps in the garden, and at last succeeded in concocting a long\nepistle. \"I suppose there will be a regular correspondence,\" said\nPriscilla.\n\nTwo days afterwards, however, the correspondence took altogether\nanother form. The cottage in which they now lived was supposed to be\nbeyond the beat of the wooden-legged postman, and therefore it was\nnecessary that they should call at the post-office for their letters.\nOn the morning in question Priscilla obtained a thick letter from\nExeter for her mother, and knew that it had come from her aunt.\nHer aunt could hardly have found it necessary to correspond with\nDorothy's mother so soon after that letter to Dorothy had been\nwritten had there not arisen some very peculiar cause. Priscilla,\nafter much meditation, thought it better that the letter should be\nopened in Dorothy's absence, and in Dorothy's absence the following\nletter was read both by Priscilla and her mother:--\n\n\n   The Close, March 19, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SISTER STANBURY,\n\n   After much consideration, I think it best to send under\n   cover to you the enclosed letter from Mr. Brooke Burgess,\n   intended for your daughter Dorothy. You will see that I\n   have opened it and read it,--as I was clearly entitled to\n   do, the letter having been addressed to my niece while she\n   was supposed to be under my care. I do not like to destroy\n   the letter, though, perhaps, that would be best; but I\n   would advise you to do so, if it be possible, without\n   shewing it to Dorothy. I have told Mr. Brooke Burgess what\n   I have done.\n\n   I have also told him that I cannot sanction a marriage\n   between him and your daughter. There are many reasons of\n   old date,--not to speak of present reasons also,--which\n   would make such a marriage highly inexpedient. Mr. Brooke\n   Burgess is, of course, his own master, but your daughter\n   understands completely how the matter stands.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n\n\"What a wicked old woman!\" said Priscilla. Then there arose a\nquestion whether they should read Brooke's letter, or whether they\nshould give it unread to Dorothy. Priscilla denounced her aunt in\nthe strongest language she could use for having broken the seal.\n\"'Clearly entitled,'--because Dorothy had been living with her!\"\nexclaimed Priscilla. \"She can have no proper conception of honour\nor of honesty. She had no more right to open Dorothy's letter than\nshe had to take her money.\" Mrs. Stanbury was very anxious to read\nBrooke's letter, alleging that they would then be able to judge\nwhether it should be handed over to Dorothy. But Priscilla's sense of\nright would not admit of this. Dorothy must receive the letter from\nher lover with no further stain from unauthorised eyes than that to\nwhich it had been already subjected. She was called in, therefore,\nfrom the kitchen, and the whole packet was given to her. \"Your aunt\nhas read the enclosure, Dolly; but we have not opened it.\"\n\nDorothy took the packet without a word and sat herself down. She\nfirst read her aunt's letter very slowly. \"I understand perfectly,\"\nshe said, folding it up, almost listlessly, while Brooke's letter lay\nstill unopened on her lap. Then she took it up, and held it awhile in\nboth hands, while her mother and Priscilla watched her. \"Priscilla,\"\nshe said, \"do you read it first.\"\n\nPriscilla was immediately at her side, kissing her. \"No, my darling;\nno,\" she said; \"it is for you to read it.\" Then Dorothy took the\nprecious contents from the envelope, and opened the folds of the\npaper. When she had read a dozen words, her eyes were so suffused\nwith tears, that she could hardly make herself mistress of the\ncontents of the letter; but she knew that it contained renewed\nassurances of her lover's love, and assurance on his part that he\nwould take no refusal from her based on any other ground than that of\nher own indifference to him. He had written to Miss Stanbury to the\nsame effect; but he had not thought it necessary to explain this to\nDorothy; nor did Miss Stanbury in her letter tell them that she had\nreceived any communication from him. \"Shall I read it now?\" said\nPriscilla, as soon as Dorothy again allowed the letter to fall into\nher lap.\n\nBoth Priscilla and Mrs. Stanbury read it, and for awhile they sat\nwith the two letters among them without much speech about them.\nMrs. Stanbury was endeavouring to make herself believe that her\nsister-in-law's opposition might be overcome, and that then Dorothy\nmight be married. Priscilla was inquiring of herself whether it would\nbe well that Dorothy should defy her aunt,--so much, at any rate,\nwould be well,--and marry the man, even to his deprivation of the\nold woman's fortune. Priscilla had her doubts about this, being very\nstrong in her ideas of self-denial. That her sister should put up\nwith the bitterest disappointment rather than injure the man she\nloved was right;--but then it would also be so extremely right to\ndefy Aunt Stanbury to her teeth! But Dorothy, in whose character was\nmixed with her mother's softness much of the old Stanbury strength,\nhad no doubt in her mind. It was very sweet to be so loved. What\ngratitude did she not owe to a man who was so true to her! What was\nshe that she should stand in his way? To lay herself down that she\nmight be crushed in his path was no more than she owed to him. Mrs.\nStanbury was the first to speak.\n\n\"I suppose he is a very good young man,\" she said.\n\n\"I am sure he is;--a noble, true-hearted man,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"And why shouldn't he marry whom he pleases, as long as she is\nrespectable?\" said Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"In some people's eyes poverty is more disreputable than vice,\" said\nPriscilla.\n\n\"Your aunt has been so fond of Dorothy,\" pleaded Mrs. Stanbury.\n\n\"Just as she is of her servants,\" said Priscilla.\n\nBut Dorothy said nothing. Her heart was too full to enable her to\ndefend her aunt; nor at the present moment was she strong enough to\nmake her mother understand that no hope was to be entertained. In the\ncourse of the day she walked out with her sister on the road towards\nRidleigh, and there, standing among the rocks and ferns, looking down\nupon the river, with the buzz of the little mill within her ears,\nshe explained the feelings of her heart and her many thoughts with a\nflow of words stronger, as Priscilla thought, than she had ever used\nbefore.\n\n\"It is not what he would suffer now, Pris, or what he would feel, but\nwhat he would feel ten, twenty years hence, when he would know that\nhis children would have been all provided for, had he not lost his\nfortune by marrying me.\"\n\n\"He must be the only judge whether he prefers you to the old woman's\nmoney,\" said Priscilla.\n\n\"No, dear; not the only judge. And it isn't that, Pris,--not which\nhe likes best now, but which it is best for him that he should have.\nWhat could I do for him?\"\n\n\"You can love him.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I can do that.\" And Dorothy paused a moment, to think how\nexceedingly well she could do that one thing. \"But what is that? As\nyou said the other day, a dog can do that. I am not clever. I can't\nplay, or talk French, or do things that men like their wives to do.\nAnd I have lived here all my life; and what am I, that for me he\nshould lose a great fortune?\"\n\n\"That is his look out.\"\n\n\"No, dearest;--it is mine, and I will look out. I shall be able, at\nany rate, to remember always that I have loved him, and have not\ninjured him. He may be angry with me now,\"--and there was a feeling\nof pride at her heart, as she thought that he would be angry with\nher, because she did not go to him,--\"but he will know at last that I\nhave been as good to him as I knew how to be.\"\n\nThen Priscilla wound her arms round Dorothy, and kissed her.\n\"My sister,\" she said; \"my own sister!\" They walked on further,\ndiscussing the matter in all its bearings, talking of the act of\nself-denial which Dorothy was called on to perform, as though it were\nsome abstract thing, the performance of which was, or perhaps was\nnot, imperatively demanded by the laws which should govern humanity;\nbut with no idea on the mind of either of them that there was any\nlonger a doubt as to this special matter in hand. They were away\nfrom home over three hours; and, when they returned, Dorothy at once\nwrote her two letters. They were very simple, and very short. She\ntold Brooke, whom she now addressed as \"Dear Mr. Burgess,\" that\nit could not be as he would have it; and she told her aunt,--with\nsome terse independence of expression, which Miss Stanbury quite\nunderstood,--that she had considered the matter, and had thought it\nright to refuse Mr. Burgess's offer.\n\n\"Don't you think she is very much changed?\" said Mrs. Stanbury to her\neldest daughter.\n\n\"Not changed in the least, mother; but the sun has opened the bud,\nand now we see the fruit.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nMR. BOZZLE AT HOME.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nIt had now come to pass that Trevelyan had not a friend in the world\nto whom he could apply in the matter of his wife and family. In the\nlast communication which he had received from Lady Milborough she\nhad scolded him, in terms that were for her severe, because he had\nnot returned to his wife and taken her off with him to Naples. Mr.\nBideawhile had found himself obliged to decline to move in the matter\nat all. With Hugh Stanbury, Trevelyan had had a direct quarrel. Mr.\nand Mrs. Outhouse he regarded as bitter enemies, who had taken the\npart of his wife without any regard to the decencies of life. And now\nit had come to pass that his sole remaining ally, Mr. Samuel Bozzle,\nthe ex-policeman, was becoming weary of his service. Trevelyan\nremained in the north of Italy up to the middle of March, spending a\nfortune in sending telegrams to Bozzle, instigating Bozzle by all the\nmeans in his power to obtain possession of the child, desiring him at\none time to pounce down upon the parsonage of St. Diddulph's with a\nbattalion of policemen armed to the teeth with the law's authority,\nand at another time suggesting to him to find his way by stratagem\ninto Mr. Outhouse's castle and carry off the child in his arms. At\nlast he sent word to say that he himself would be in England before\nthe end of March, and would see that the majesty of the law should be\nvindicated in his favour.\n\nBozzle had in truth made but one personal application for the child\nat St. Diddulph's. In making this he had expected no success, though,\nfrom the energetic nature of his disposition, he had made the attempt\nwith some zeal. But he had never applied again at the parsonage,\ndisregarding the letters, the telegrams, and even the promises which\nhad come to him from his employer with such frequency. The truth was\nthat Mrs. Bozzle was opposed to the proposed separation of the mother\nand the child, and that Bozzle was a man who listened to the words of\nhis wife. Mrs. Bozzle was quite prepared to admit that Madame T.,--as\nMrs. Trevelyan had come to be called at No. 55, Stony Walk,--was\nno better than she should be. Mrs. Bozzle was disposed to think\nthat ladies of quality, among whom Madame T. was entitled in her\nestimation to take rank, were seldom better than they ought to be,\nand she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread\nby watching the lady or the lady's lover. She had participated in\nBozzle's triumph when he had discovered that the Colonel had gone to\nDevonshire, and again when he had learned that the Lothario had been\nat St. Diddulph's. And had the case been brought before the judge\nordinary by means of her husband's exertions, she would have taken\npleasure in reading every word of the evidence, even though her\nhusband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers. But\nnow, when a demand was made upon Bozzle to violate the sanctity of\nthe clergyman's house, and withdraw the child by force or stratagem,\nshe began to perceive that the palmy days of the Trevelyan affair\nwere over for them, and that it would be wise on her husband's part\ngradually to back out of the gentleman's employment. \"Just put it on\nthe fire-back, Bozzle,\" she said one morning, as her husband stood\nbefore her reading for the second time a somewhat lengthy epistle\nwhich had reached him from Italy, while he held the baby over his\nshoulder with his left arm. He had just washed himself at the sink,\nand though his face was clean, his hair was rough, and his shirt\nsleeves were tucked up.\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"Put it on the fire-back, Bozzle.\"]\n\n\n\"That's all very well, Maryanne; but when a party has took a gent's\nmoney, a party is bound to go through with the job.\"\n\n\"Gammon, Bozzle.\"\n\n\"It's all very well to say gammon; but his money has been took,--and\nthere's more to come.\"\n\n\"And ain't you worked for the money,--down to Hexeter one time,\nacross the water pretty well day and night watching that ere\nclergyman's 'ouse like a cat? What more'd he have? As to the child,\nI won't hear of it, B. The child shan't come here. We'd all be\nshewed up in the papers as that black, that they'd hoot us along the\nstreets. It ain't the regular line of business, Bozzle; and there\nain't no good to be got, never, by going off the regular line.\"\nWhereupon Bozzle scratched his head and again read the letter. A\ndistinct promise of a hundred pounds was made to him, if he would\nhave the child ready to hand over to Trevelyan on Trevelyan's arrival\nin England.\n\n\"It ain't to be done, you know,\" said Bozzle.\n\n\"Of course it ain't,\" said Mrs. Bozzle.\n\n\"It ain't to be done anyways;--not in my way of business. Why didn't\nhe go to Skint, as I told him, when his own lawyer was too dainty for\nthe job? The paternal parent has a right to his infants, no doubt.\"\nThat was Bozzle's law.\n\n\"I don't believe it, B.\"\n\n\"But he have, I tell you.\"\n\n\"He can't suckle 'em;--can he? I don't believe a bit of his rights.\"\n\n\"When a married woman has followers, and the husband don't go the\nwrong side of the post too, or it ain't proved again him that he do,\nthey'll never let her have nothing to do with the children. It's been\nbefore the court a hundred times. He'll get the child fast enough if\nhe'll go before the court.\"\n\n\"Anyways it ain't your business, Bozzle, and don't you meddle nor\nmake. The money's good money as long as it's honest earned; but when\nyou come to rampaging and breaking into a gent's house, then I say\nmoney may be had a deal too hard.\" In this special letter, which had\nnow come to hand, Bozzle was not instructed to \"rampage.\" He was\nsimply desired to make a further official requisition for the boy at\nthe parsonage, and to explain to Mr. Outhouse, Mrs. Outhouse, and\nMrs. Trevelyan, or to as many of them as he could contrive to see,\nthat Mr. Trevelyan was immediately about to return to London, and\nthat he would put the law into execution if his son were not given\nup to him at once. \"I'll tell you what it is, B.,\" exclaimed Mrs.\nBozzle, \"it's my belief as he ain't quite right up here;\" and Mrs.\nBozzle touched her forehead.\n\n\"It's love for her as has done it then,\" said Bozzle, shaking his\nhead.\n\n\"I'm not a taking of her part, B. A woman as has a husband as finds\nher with her wittels regular, and with what's decent and comfortable\nbeside, ought to be contented. I've never said no other than that.\nI ain't no patience with your saucy madames as can't remember as\nthey're eating an honest man's bread. Drat 'em all; what is it they\nwants? They don't know what they wants. It's just hidleness,--cause\nthere ain't a ha'porth for 'em to do. It's that as makes 'em--, I\nwon't say what. But as for this here child, B.--.\" At that moment\nthere came a knock at the door. Mrs. Bozzle going into the passage,\nopened it herself, and saw a strange gentleman. Bozzle, who had stood\nat the inner door, saw that the gentleman was Mr. Trevelyan.\n\nThe letter, which was still in the ex-policeman's hand, had reached\nStony Walk on the previous day; but the master of the house had been\nabsent, finding out facts, following up his profession, and earning\nan honest penny. Trevelyan had followed his letter quicker than\nhe had intended when it was written, and was now with his prime\nminister, before his prime minister had been able to take any action\non the last instruction received. \"Does one Mr. Samuel Bozzle live\nhere?\" asked Trevelyan. Then Bozzle came forward and introduced his\nwife. There was no one else present except the baby, and Bozzle\nintimated that let matters be as delicate as they might, they could\nbe discussed with perfect security in his wife's presence. But\nTrevelyan was of a different opinion, and he was disgusted and\nrevolted,--most unreasonably,--by the appearance of his minister's\ndomestic arrangements. Bozzle had always waited upon him with a\ndecent coat, and a well-brushed hat, and clean shoes. It is very much\neasier for such men as Mr. Bozzle to carry decency of appearance\nabout with them than to keep it at home. Trevelyan had never believed\nhis ally to be more than an ordinary ex-policeman, but he had not\nconsidered how unattractive might be the interior of a private\ndetective's private residence. Mrs. Bozzle had set a chair for\nhim, but he had declined to sit down. The room was dirty, and very\nclose,--as though no breath of air was ever allowed to find entrance\nthere. \"Perhaps you could put on your coat, and walk out with me for\na few minutes,\" said Trevelyan. Mrs. Bozzle, who well understood that\nbusiness was business, and that wives were not business, felt no\nanger at this, and handed her husband his best coat. The well-brushed\nhat was fetched from a cupboard, and it was astonishing to see\nhow easily and how quickly the outer respectability of Bozzle was\nrestored.\n\n\"Well?\" said Trevelyan, as soon as they were together in the middle\nof Stony Walk.\n\n\"There hasn't been nothing to be done, sir,\" said Bozzle.\n\n\"Why not?\" Trevelyan could perceive at once that the authority which\nhe had once respected had gone from the man. Bozzle away from his own\nhome, out on business, with his coat buttoned over his breast, and\nhis best hat in his hand, was aware that he commanded respect,--and\nhe could carry himself accordingly. He knew himself to be\nsomebody, and could be easy, self-confident, confidential, severe,\nauthoritative, or even arrogant, as the circumstances of the moment\nmight demand. But he had been found with his coat off, and a baby in\nhis arms, and he could not recover himself. \"I do not suppose that\nanybody will question my right to have the care of my own child,\"\nsaid Trevelyan.\n\n\"If you would have gone to Mr. Skint, sir--,\" suggested Bozzle.\n\"There ain't no smarter gent in all the profession, sir, than Mr.\nSkint.\"\n\nMr. Trevelyan made no reply to this, but walked on in silence, with\nhis minister at his elbow. He was very wretched, understanding well\nthe degradation to which he was subjecting himself in discussing his\nwife's conduct with this man;--but with whom else could he discuss\nit? The man seemed to be meaner now than he had been before he had\nbeen seen in his own home. And Trevelyan was conscious too that he\nhimself was not in outward appearance as he used to be; that he was\nill-dressed, and haggard, and worn, and visibly a wretched being. How\ncan any man care to dress himself with attention who is always alone,\nand always miserable when alone? During the months which had passed\nover him since he had sent his wife away from him, his very nature\nhad been altered, and he himself was aware of the change. As he went\nabout, his eyes were ever cast downwards, and he walked with a quick\nshuffling gait, and he suspected others, feeling that he himself was\nsuspected. And all work had ceased with him. Since she had left him\nhe had not read a single book that was worth the reading. And he knew\nit all. He was conscious that he was becoming disgraced and degraded.\nHe would sooner have shot himself than have walked into his club,\nor even have allowed himself to be seen by daylight in Pall Mall,\nor Piccadilly. He had taken in his misery to drinking little drops\nof brandy in the morning, although he knew well that there was no\nshorter road to the devil than that opened by such a habit. He looked\nup for a moment at Bozzle, and then asked him a question. \"Where is\nhe now?\"\n\n\"You mean the Colonel, sir. He's up in town, sir, a minding of his\nparliamentary duties. He have been up all this month, sir.\"\n\n\"They haven't met?\"\n\nBozzle paused a moment before he replied, and then smiled as he\nspoke. \"It is so hard to say, sir. Ladies is so cute and cunning.\nI've watched as sharp as watching can go, pretty near. I've put a\nyoungster on at each hend, and both of 'em 'd hear a mouse stirring\nin his sleep. I ain't got no evidence, Mr. Trevelyan. But if you ask\nme my opinion, why in course they've been together somewhere. It\nstands to reason, Mr. Trevelyan; don't it?\" And Bozzle as he said\nthis smiled almost aloud.\n\n\"D----n and b----t it all for ever!\" said Trevelyan, gnashing his\nteeth, and moving away into Union Street as fast as he could walk.\nAnd he did go away, leaving Bozzle standing in the middle of Stony\nWalk.\n\n\"He's disturbed in his mind,--quite 'orrid,\" Bozzle said when he got\nback to his wife. \"He cursed and swore as made even me feel bad.\"\n\n\"B.,\" said his wife, \"do you listen to me. Get in what's a howing,\nand don't you have nothing more to do with it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nANOTHER STRUGGLE.\n\n\nSir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley were to reach England about the end of\nMarch or the beginning of April, and both Mrs. Trevelyan and Nora\nRowley were almost sick for their arrival. Both their uncle and aunt\nhad done very much for them, had been true to them in their need, and\nhad submitted to endless discomforts in order that their nieces might\nhave respectable shelter in their great need; but nevertheless their\nconduct had not been of a kind to produce either love or friendship.\nEach of the sisters felt that she had been much better off at\nNuncombe Putney, and that either the weakness of Mrs. Stanbury,\nor the hardness of Priscilla, was preferable to the repulsive\nforbearance of their clerical host. He did not scold them. He never\nthrew it in Mrs. Trevelyan's teeth that she had been separated\nfrom her husband by her own fault; he did not tell them of his own\ndiscomfort. But he showed it in every gesture, and spoke of it in\nevery tone of his voice;--so that Mrs. Trevelyan could not refrain\nfrom apologising for the misfortune of her presence.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"things can't be pleasant and unpleasant at the\nsame time. You were quite right to come here. I am glad for all our\nsakes that Sir Marmaduke will be with us so soon.\"\n\nShe had almost given up in her mind the hope that she had long\ncherished, that she might some day be able to live again with her\nhusband. Every step which he now took in reference to her seemed to\nbe prompted by so bitter an hostility, that she could not but believe\nthat she was hateful to him. How was it possible that a husband and\nhis wife should again come together, when there had been between\nthem such an emissary as a detective policeman? Mrs. Trevelyan\nhad gradually come to learn that Bozzle had been at Nuncombe\nPutney, watching her, and to be aware that she was still under the\nsurveillance of his eye. For some months past now she had neither\nseen Colonel Osborne, nor heard from him. He had certainly by his\nfolly done much to produce the ruin which had fallen upon her; but it\nnever occurred to her to blame him. Indeed she did not know that he\nwas liable to blame. Mr. Outhouse always spoke of him with indignant\nscorn, and Nora had learned to think that much of their misery was\ndue to his imprudence. But Mrs. Trevelyan would not see this, and,\nnot seeing it, was more widely separated from her husband than\nshe would have been had she acknowledged that any excuse for his\nmisconduct had been afforded by the vanity and folly of the other\nman.\n\nLady Rowley had written to have a furnished house taken for them\nfrom the first of April, and a house had been secured in Manchester\nStreet. The situation in question is not one which is of itself very\ncharming, nor is it supposed to be in a high degree fashionable; but\nNora looked forward to her escape from St. Diddulph's to Manchester\nStreet as though Paradise were to be re-opened to her as soon as she\nshould be there with her father and mother. She was quite clear now\nas to her course about Hugh Stanbury. She did not doubt but that she\ncould so argue the matter as to get the consent of her father and\nmother. She felt herself to be altogether altered in her views of\nlife, since experience had come upon her, first at Nuncombe Putney,\nand after that, much more heavily and seriously, at St. Diddulph's.\nShe looked back as though to a childish dream to the ideas which had\nprevailed with her when she had told herself, as she used to do so\nfrequently, that she was unfit to be a poor man's wife. Why should\nshe be more unfit for such a position than another? Of course there\nwere many thoughts in her mind, much of memory if nothing of regret,\nin regard to Mr. Glascock and the splendour that had been offered\nto her. She had had her chance of being a rich man's wife, and had\nrejected it,--had rejected it twice, with her eyes open. Readers\nwill say that if she loved Hugh Stanbury with all her heart, there\ncould be nothing of regret in her reflections. But we are perhaps\naccustomed in judging for ourselves and of others to draw the\nlines too sharply, and to say that on this side lie vice, folly,\nheartlessness, and greed,--and on the other honour, love, truth, and\nwisdom,--the good and the bad each in its own domain. But the good\nand the bad mix themselves so thoroughly in our thoughts, even in our\naspirations, that we must look for excellence rather in overcoming\nevil than in freeing ourselves from its influence. There had been\nmany moments of regret with Nora;--but none of remorse. At the very\nmoment in which she had sent Mr. Glascock away from her, and had\nfelt that he had now been sent away for always, she had been full of\nregret. Since that there had been many hours in which she had thought\nof her own self-lesson, of that teaching by which she had striven to\nconvince herself that she could never fitly become a poor man's wife.\nBut the upshot of it all was a healthy pride in what she had done,\nand a strong resolution that she would make shirts and hem towels for\nher husband if he required it. It had been given her to choose, and\nshe had chosen. She had found herself unable to tell a man that she\nloved him when she did not love him,--and equally unable to conceal\nthe love which she did feel. \"If he wheeled a barrow of turnips about\nthe street, I'd marry him to-morrow,\" she said to her sister one\nafternoon as they were sitting together in the room which ought to\nhave been their uncle's study.\n\n\"If he wheeled a big barrow, you'd have to wheel a little one,\" said\nher sister.\n\n\"Then I'd do it. I shouldn't mind. There has been this advantage in\nSt. Diddulph's, that nothing can be triste, nothing dull, nothing\nugly after it.\"\n\n\"It may be so with you, Nora;--that is in imagination.\"\n\n\"What I mean is that living here has taught me much that I never\ncould have learned in Curzon Street. I used to think myself such a\nfine young woman,--but, upon my word, I think myself a finer one\nnow.\"\n\n\"I don't quite know what you mean.\"\n\n\"I don't quite know myself; but I nearly know. I do know this, that\nI've made up my own mind about what I mean to do.\"\n\n\"You'll change it, dear, when mamma is here, and things are\ncomfortable again. It's my belief that Mr. Glascock would come to you\nagain to-morrow if you would let him.\" Mrs. Trevelyan was, naturally,\nin complete ignorance of the experience of transatlantic excellence\nwhich Mr. Glascock had encountered in Italy.\n\n\"But I certainly should not let him. How would it be possible after\nwhat I wrote to Hugh?\"\n\n\"All that might pass away,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan,--slowly, after a\nlong pause.\n\n\"All what might pass away? Have I not given him a distinct promise?\nHave I not told him that I loved him, and sworn that I would be true\nto him? Can that be made to pass away,--even if one wished it?\"\n\n\"Of course it can. Nothing need be fixed for you till you have stood\nat the altar with a man and been made his wife. You may choose still.\nI can never choose again.\"\n\n\"I never will, at any rate,\" said Nora.\n\nThen there was another pause. \"It seems strange to me, Nora,\" said\nthe elder sister, \"that after what you have seen you should be so\nkeen to be married to any one.\"\n\n\"What is a girl to do?\"\n\n\"Better drown herself than do as I have done. Only think what there\nis before me. What I have gone through is nothing to it. Of course I\nmust go back to the Islands. Where else am I to live? Who else will\ntake me?\"\n\n\"Come to us,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Us, Nora! Who are the us? But in no way would that be possible.\nPapa will be here, perhaps, for six months.\" Nora thought it quite\npossible that she might have a home of her own before six months were\npassed,--even though she might be wheeling the smaller barrow,--but\nshe would not say so. \"And by that time everything must be decided.\"\n\n\"I suppose it must.\"\n\n\"Of course papa and mamma must go back,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"Papa might take a pension. He's entitled to a pension now.\"\n\n\"He'll never do that as long as he can have employment. They'll go\nback, and I must go with them. Who else would take me in?\"\n\n\"I know who would take you in, Emily.\"\n\n\"My darling, that is romance. As for myself, I should not care where\nI went. If it were even to remain here, I could bear it.\"\n\n\"I could not,\" said Nora, decisively.\n\n\"It is so different with you, dear. I don't suppose it is possible\nI should take my boy with me to the Islands; and how--am I--to\ngo--anywhere--without him?\" Then she broke down, and fell into a\nparoxysm of sobs, and was in very truth a broken-hearted woman.\n\nNora was silent for some minutes, but at last she spoke. \"Why do you\nnot go back to him, Emily?\"\n\n\"How am I to go back to him? What am I to do to make him take me\nback?\" At this very moment Trevelyan was in the house, but they did\nnot know it.\n\n\"Write to him,\" said Nora.\n\n\"What am I to say? In very truth I do believe that he is mad. If I\nwrite to him, should I defend myself or accuse myself? A dozen times\nI have striven to write such a letter,--not that I might send it, but\nthat I might find what I could say should I ever wish to send it. And\nit is impossible. I can only tell him how unjust he has been, how\ncruel, how mad, how wicked!\"\n\n\"Could you not say to him simply this?--'Let us be together, wherever\nit may be; and let bygones be bygones.'\"\n\n\"While he is watching me with a policeman? While he is still thinking\nthat I entertain a--lover? While he believes that I am the base thing\nthat he has dared to think me?\"\n\n\"He has never believed it.\"\n\n\"Then how can he be such a villain as to treat me like this? I could\nnot go to him, Nora;--not unless I went to him as one who was known\nto be mad, over whom in his wretched condition it would be my duty\nto keep watch. In no other way could I overcome my abhorrence of the\noutrages to which he has subjected me.\"\n\n\"But for the child's sake, Emily.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! If it were simply to grovel in the dust before him it\nshould be done. If humiliation would suffice,--or any self-abasement\nthat were possible to me! But I should be false if I said that I look\nforward to any such possibility. How can he wish to have me back\nagain after what he has said and done? I am his wife, and he has\ndisgraced me before all men by his own words. And what have I done,\nthat I should not have done;--what left undone on his behalf that\nI should have done? It is hard that the foolish workings of a weak\nman's mind should be able so completely to ruin the prospects of a\nwoman's life!\"\n\nNora was beginning to answer this by attempting to shew that the\nhusband's madness was, perhaps, only temporary, when there came a\nknock at the door, and Mrs. Outhouse was at once in the room. It\nwill be well that the reader should know what had taken place at the\nparsonage while the two sisters had been together up-stairs, so that\nthe nature of Mrs. Outhouse's mission to them may explain itself. Mr.\nOuthouse had been in his closet down-stairs, when the maid-servant\nbrought word to him that Mr. Trevelyan was in the parlour, and was\ndesirous of seeing him.\n\n\"Mr. Trevelyan!\" said the unfortunate clergyman, holding up both his\nhands. The servant understood the tragic importance of the occasion\nquite as well as did her master, and simply shook her head. \"Has your\nmistress seen him?\" said the master. The girl again shook her head.\n\"Ask your mistress to come to me,\" said the clergyman. Then the girl\ndisappeared; and in a few minutes Mrs. Outhouse, equally imbued with\nthe tragic elements of the day, was with her husband.\n\nMr. Outhouse began by declaring that no consideration should induce\nhim to see Trevelyan, and commissioned his wife to go to the man and\ntell him that he must leave the house. When the unfortunate woman\nexpressed an opinion that Trevelyan had some legal rights upon which\nhe might probably insist, Mr. Outhouse asserted roundly that he could\nhave no legal right to remain in that parsonage against the will\nof the rector. \"If he wants to claim his wife and child, he must\ndo it by law,--not by force; and thank God, Sir Marmaduke will be\nhere before he can do that.\" \"But I can't make him go,\" said Mrs.\nOuthouse. \"Tell him that you'll send for a policeman,\" said the\nclergyman.\n\nIt had come to pass that there had been messages backwards and\nforwards between the visitor and the master of the house, all carried\nby that unfortunate lady. Trevelyan did not demand that his wife and\nchild should be given up to him;--did not even, on this occasion,\ndemand that his boy should be surrendered to him,--now, at once.\nHe did say, very repeatedly, that of course he must have his boy,\nbut seemed to imply that, under certain circumstances, he would\nbe willing to take his wife to live with him again. This appeared\nto Mrs. Outhouse to be so manifestly the one thing that was\ndesirable,--to be the only solution of the difficulty that could be\nadmitted as a solution at all,--that she went to work on that hint,\nand ventured to entertain a hope that a reconciliation might be\neffected. She implored her husband to lend a hand to the work;--by\nwhich she intended to imply that he should not only see Trevelyan,\nbut consent to meet the sinner on friendly terms. But Mr. Outhouse\nwas on the occasion even more than customarily obstinate. His wife\nmight do what she liked. He would neither meddle nor make. He would\nnot willingly see Mr. Trevelyan in his own house;--unless, indeed,\nMr. Trevelyan should attempt to force his way up into the nursery.\nThen he said that which left no doubt on his wife's mind that, should\nany violence be attempted, her husband would manfully join the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nBut it soon became evident that no such attempt was to be made on\nthat day. Trevelyan was lachrymose, heartbroken, and a sight pitiable\nto behold. When Mrs. Outhouse loudly asserted that his wife had not\nsinned against him in the least,--\"not in a tittle, Mr. Trevelyan,\"\nshe repeated over and over again,--he began to assert himself,\ndeclaring that she had seen the man in Devonshire, and corresponded\nwith him since she had been at St. Diddulph's; and when the lady had\ndeclared that the latter assertion was untrue, he had shaken his\nhead, and had told her that perhaps she did not know all. But the\nmisery of the man had its effect upon her, and at last she proposed\nto be the bearer of a message to his wife. He had demanded to see his\nchild, offering to promise that he would not attempt to take the boy\nby force on this occasion,--saying, also, that his claim by law was\nso good, that no force could be necessary. It was proposed by Mrs.\nOuthouse that he should first see the mother,--and to this he at last\nassented. How blessed a thing would it be if these two persons could\nbe induced to forget the troubles of the last twelve months, and once\nmore to love and trust each other! \"But, sir,\" said Mrs. Outhouse,\nputting her hand upon his arm;--\"you must not upbraid her, for\nshe will not bear it.\" \"She knows nothing of what is due to a\nhusband,\" said Trevelyan, gloomily. The task was not hopeful; but,\nnevertheless, the poor woman resolved to do her best.\n\nAnd now Mrs. Outhouse was in her niece's room, asking her to go down\nand see her husband. Little Louis had at the time been with the\nnurse, and the very moment that the mother heard that the child's\nfather was in the house, she jumped up and rushed away to get\npossession of her treasure. \"Has he come for baby?\" Nora asked in\ndismay. Then Mrs. Outhouse, anxious to obtain a convert to her\npresent views, boldly declared that Mr. Trevelyan had no such\nintention. Mrs. Trevelyan came back at once with the boy, and then\nlistened to all her aunt's arguments. \"But I will not take baby with\nme,\" she said. At last it was decided that she should go down alone,\nand that the child should afterwards be taken to his father in the\ndrawing-room; Mrs. Outhouse pledging herself that the whole household\nshould combine in her defence if Mr. Trevelyan should attempt to take\nthe child out of that room. \"But what am I to say to him?\" she asked.\n\n\"Say as little as possible,\" said Mrs. Outhouse,--\"except to make him\nunderstand that he has been in error in imputing fault to you.\"\n\n\"He will never understand that,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nA considerable time elapsed after that before she could bring herself\nto descend the stairs. Now that her husband was so near her, and that\nher aunt had assured her that she might reinstate herself in her\nposition, if she could only abstain from saying hard words to him,\nshe wished that he was away from her again, in Italy. She knew that\nshe could not refrain from hard words. How was it possible that she\nshould vindicate her own honour, without asserting with all her\nstrength that she had been ill-used; and, to speak truth on the\nmatter, her love for the man, which had once been true and eager, had\nbeen quelled by the treatment she had received. She had clung to her\nlove in some shape, in spite of the accusations made against her,\ntill she had heard that the policeman had been set upon her heels.\nCould it be possible that any woman should love a man, or at least\nthat any wife should love a husband, after such usage as that? At\nlast she crept gently down the stairs, and stood at the parlour-door.\nShe listened, and could hear his steps, as he paced backwards and\nforwards through the room. She looked back, and could see the face\nof the servant peering round from the kitchen-stairs. She could not\nendure to be watched in her misery, and, thus driven, she opened the\nparlour-door. \"Louis,\" she said, walking into the room, \"Aunt Mary\nhas desired me to come to you.\"\n\n\"Emily!\" he exclaimed, and ran to her and embraced her. She did not\nseek to stop him, but she did not return the kiss which he gave her.\nThen he held her by her hands, and looked into her face, and she\ncould see how strangely he was altered. She thought that she would\nhardly have known him, had she not been sure that it was he. She\nherself was also changed. Who can bear sorrow without such change,\ntill age has fixed the lines of the face, or till care has made them\nhard and unmalleable? But the effect on her was as nothing to that\nwhich grief, remorse, and desolation had made on him. He had had\nno child with him, no sister, no friend. Bozzle had been his only\nrefuge,--a refuge not adapted to make life easier to such a man as\nTrevelyan; and he,--in spite of the accusations made by himself\nagainst his wife, within his own breast hourly since he had\nleft her,--had found it to be very difficult to satisfy his own\nconscience. He told himself from hour to hour that he knew that he\nwas right; but in very truth he was ever doubting his own conduct.\n\n\"You have been ill, Louis,\" she said, looking at him.\n\n\"Ill at ease, Emily;--very ill at ease! A sore heart will make the\nface thin, as well as fever or ague. Since we parted I have not had\nmuch to comfort me.\"\n\n\"Nor have I,--nor any of us,\" said she. \"How was comfort to come from\nsuch a parting?\"\n\nThen they both stood silent together. He was still holding her by\nthe hand, but she was careful not to return his pressure. She would\nnot take her hand away from him; but she would show him no sign\nof softness till he should have absolutely acquitted her of the\naccusation he had made against her. \"We are man and wife,\" he said\nafter awhile. \"In spite of all that has come and gone I am yours, and\nyou are mine.\"\n\n\"You should have remembered that always, Louis.\"\n\n\"I have never forgotten it,--never. In no thought have I been untrue\nto you. My heart has never changed since first I gave it you.\" There\ncame a bitter frown upon her face, of which she was so conscious\nherself, that she turned her face away from him. She still remembered\nher lesson, that she was not to anger him, and, therefore, she\nrefrained from answering him at all. But the answer was there, hot\nwithin her bosom. Had he loved her,--and yet suspected that she was\nfalse to him and to her vows, simply because she had been on terms\nof intimacy with an old friend? Had he loved her, and yet turned her\nfrom his house? Had he loved her,--and set a policeman to watch her?\nHad he loved her, and yet spoken evil of her to all their friends?\nHad he loved her, and yet striven to rob her of her child? \"Will you\ncome to me?\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose it will be better so,\" she answered slowly.\n\n\"Then you will promise me--\" He paused, and attempted to turn her\ntowards him, so that he might look her in the face.\n\n\"Promise what?\" she said, quickly glancing round at him, and drawing\nher hand away from him as she did so.\n\n\"That all intercourse with Colonel Osborne shall be at an end.\"\n\n\"I will make no promise. You come to me to add one insult to another.\nHad you been a man, you would not have named him to me after what you\nhave done to me.\"\n\n\"That is absurd. I have a right to demand from you such a pledge. I\nam willing to believe that you have not--\"\n\n\"Have not what?\"\n\n\"That you have not utterly disgraced me.\"\n\n\"God in heaven, that I should hear this!\" she exclaimed. \"Louis\nTrevelyan, I have not disgraced you at all,--in thought, in word, in\ndeed, in look, or in gesture. It is you that have disgraced yourself,\nand ruined me, and degraded even your own child.\"\n\n\"Is this the way in which you welcome me?\"\n\n\"Certainly it is,--in this way and in no other if you speak to me\nof what is past, without acknowledging your error.\" Her brow became\nblacker and blacker as she continued to speak to him. \"It would be\nbest that nothing should be said,--not a word. That it all should be\nregarded as an ugly dream. But, when you come to me and at once go\nback to it all, and ask me for a promise--\"\n\n\"Am I to understand then that all idea of submission to your husband\nis to be at an end?\"\n\n\"I will submit to no imputation on my honour,--even from you. One\nwould have thought that it would have been for you to preserve it\nuntarnished.\"\n\n\"And you will give me no assurance as to your future life?\"\n\n\"None;--certainly none. If you want promises from me, there can be no\nhope for the future. What am I to promise? That I will not have--a\nlover? What respect can I enjoy as your wife if such a promise be\nneeded? If you should choose to fancy that it had been broken you\nwould set your policeman to watch me again! Louis, we can never live\ntogether again ever with comfort, unless you acknowledge in your own\nheart that you have used me shamefully.\"\n\n\"Were you right to see him in Devonshire?\"\n\n\"Of course I was right. Why should I not see him,--or any one?\"\n\n\"And you will see him again?\"\n\n\"When papa comes, of course I shall see him.\"\n\n\"Then it is hopeless,\" said he, turning away from her.\n\n\"If that man is to be a source of disquiet to you, it is hopeless,\"\nshe answered. \"If you cannot so school yourself that he shall be the\nsame to you as other men, it is quite hopeless. You must still be\nmad,--as you have been mad hitherto.\"\n\nHe walked about the room restlessly for a time, while she stood with\nassumed composure near the window. \"Send me my child,\" he said at\nlast.\n\n\"He shall come to you, Louis,--for a little; but he is not to be\ntaken out from hence. Is that a promise?\"\n\n\"You are to exact promises from me, where my own rights are\nconcerned, while you refuse to give me any, though I am entitled to\ndemand them! I order you to send the boy to me. Is he not my own?\"\n\n\"Is he not mine too? And is he not all that you have left to me?\"\n\nHe paused again, and then gave the promise. \"Let him be brought to\nme. He shall not be removed now. I intend to have him. I tell you\nso fairly. He shall be taken from you unless you come back to me\nwith such assurances as to your future conduct as I have a right to\ndemand. There is much that the law cannot give me. It cannot procure\nwife-like submission, love, gratitude, or even decent matronly\nconduct. But that which it can give me, I will have.\"\n\nShe walked off to the door, and then as she was quitting the room she\nspoke to him once again. \"Alas, Louis,\" she said, \"neither can the\nlaw, nor medicine, nor religion, restore to you that fine intellect\nwhich foolish suspicions have destroyed.\" Then she left him and\nreturned to the room in which her aunt, and Nora, and the child\nwere all clustered together, waiting to learn the effects of the\ninterview. The two women asked their questions with their eyes,\nrather than with spoken words. \"It is all over,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\"There is nothing left for me but to go back to papa. I only hear the\nsame accusations, repeated again and again, and make myself subject\nto the old insults.\" Then Mrs. Outhouse knew that she could interfere\nno further, and that in truth nothing could be done till the return\nof Sir Marmaduke should relieve her and her husband from all further\nactive concern in the matter.\n\nBut Trevelyan was still down-stairs waiting for the child. At last it\nwas arranged that Nora should take the boy into the drawing-room, and\nthat Mrs. Outhouse should fetch the father up from the parlour to the\nroom above it. Angry as was Mrs. Trevelyan with her husband, not the\nless was she anxious to make the boy good-looking and seemly in his\nfather's eyes. She washed the child's face, put on him a clean frill\nand a pretty ribbon; and, as she did so, she bade him kiss his papa,\nand speak nicely to him, and love him. \"Poor papa is unhappy,\" she\nsaid, \"and Louey must be very good to him.\" The boy, child though he\nwas, understood much more of what was passing around him than his\nmother knew. How was he to love papa when mamma did not do so? In\nsome shape that idea had framed itself in his mind; and, as he was\ntaken down, he knew it was impossible that he should speak nicely\nto his papa. Nora did as she was bidden, and went down to the\nfirst-floor. Mrs. Outhouse, promising that even if she were put out\nof the room by Mr. Trevelyan she would not stir from the landing\noutside the door, descended to the parlour and quickly returned with\nthe unfortunate father. Mr. Outhouse, in the meantime, was still\nsitting in his closet, tormented with curiosity, but yet determined\nnot to be seen till the intruder should have left his house.\n\n\"I hope you are well, Nora,\" he said, as he entered the room with\nMrs. Outhouse.\n\n\"Quite well, thank you, Louis.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that our troubles should have deprived you of the home\nyou had been taught to expect.\" To this Nora made no reply, but\nescaped, and went up to her sister. \"My poor little boy,\" said\nTrevelyan, taking the child and placing it on his knee. \"I suppose\nyou have forgotten your unfortunate father.\" The child, of course,\nsaid nothing, but just allowed himself to be kissed.\n\n\"He is looking very well,\" said Mrs. Outhouse.\n\n\"Is he? I dare say he is well. Louey, my boy, are you happy?\" The\nquestion was asked in a voice that was dismal beyond compare, and it\nalso remained unanswered. He had been desired to speak nicely to his\npapa, but how was it possible that a child should speak nicely under\nsuch a load of melancholy? \"He will not speak to me,\" said Trevelyan.\n\"I suppose it is what I might have expected.\" Then the child was put\noff his knee on to the floor, and began to whimper. \"A few months\nsince he would sit there for hours, with his head upon my breast,\"\nsaid Trevelyan.\n\n\"A few months is a long time in the life of such an infant,\" said\nMrs. Outhouse.\n\n\"He may go away,\" said Trevelyan. Then the child was led out of the\nroom, and sent up to his mother.\n\n\"Emily has done all she can to make the child love your memory,\" said\nMrs. Outhouse.\n\n\"To love my memory! What;--as though I were dead. I will teach him to\nlove me as I am, Mrs. Outhouse. I do not think that it is too late.\nWill you tell your husband from me, with my compliments, that I shall\ncause him to be served with a legal demand for the restitution of my\nchild?\"\n\n\"But Sir Marmaduke will be here in a few days.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of that. Sir Marmaduke is nothing to me now. My child\nis my own,--and so is my wife. Sir Marmaduke has no authority over\neither one or the other. I find my child here, and it is here that\nI must look for him. I am sorry that you should be troubled, but the\nfault does not rest with me. Mr. Outhouse has refused to give me up\nmy own child, and I am driven to take such steps for his recovery as\nthe law has put within my reach.\"\n\n\"Why did you turn your wife out of doors, Mr. Trevelyan?\" asked Mrs.\nOuthouse boldly.\n\n\"I did not turn her out of doors. I provided a fitting shelter\nfor her. I gave her everything that she could want. You know what\nhappened. That man went down and was received there. I defy you, Mrs.\nOuthouse, to say that it was my fault.\"\n\nMrs. Outhouse did attempt to show him that it was his fault; but\nwhile she was doing so he left the house. \"I don't think she could go\nback to him,\" said Mrs. Outhouse to her husband. \"He is quite insane\nupon this matter.\"\n\n\"I shall be insane, I know,\" said Mr. Outhouse, \"if Sir Marmaduke\ndoes not come home very quickly.\" Nevertheless he quite ignored any\nlegal power that might be brought to bear against him as to the\nrestitution of the child to its father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nPARKER'S HOTEL, MOWBRAY STREET.\n\n\nWithin a week of the occurrence which is related in the last chapter,\nthere came a telegram from Southampton to the parsonage at St.\nDiddulph's, saying that Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley had reached\nEngland. On the evening of that day they were to lodge at a small\nfamily hotel in Baker Street, and both Mrs. Trevelyan and Nora were\nto be with them. The leave-taking at the parsonage was painful, as\non both sides there existed a feeling that affection and sympathy\nwere wanting. The uncle and aunt had done their duty, and both Mrs.\nTrevelyan and Nora felt that they ought to have been demonstrative\nand cordial in their gratitude;--but they found it impossible to\nbecome so. And the rector could not pretend but that he was glad to\nbe rid of his guests. There were, too, some last words about money to\nbe spoken, which were grievous thorns in the poor man's flesh. Two\nbank notes, however, were put upon his table, and he knew that unless\nhe took them he could not pay for the provisions which his unwelcome\nvisitors had consumed. Surely there never was a man so cruelly\nill-used as had been Mr. Outhouse in all this matter. \"Another such\nwinter as that would put me in my grave,\" he said, when his wife\ntried to comfort him after they were gone. \"I know that they have\nboth been very good to us,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, as she and her\nsister, together with the child and the nurse, hurried away towards\nBaker Street in a cab, \"but I have never for a moment felt that\nthey were glad to have us.\" \"But how could they have been glad to\nhave us,\" she added afterwards, \"when we brought such trouble with\nus?\" But they to whom they were going now would receive her with\njoy;--would make her welcome with all her load of sorrows, would give\nto her a sympathy which it was impossible that she should receive\nfrom others. Though she might not be happy now,--for in truth how\ncould she be ever really happy again,--there would be a joy to her in\nplacing her child in her mother's arms, and in receiving her father's\nwarm caresses. That her father would be very vehement in his anger\nagainst her husband she knew well,--for Sir Marmaduke was a vehement\nman. But there would be some support for her in the very violence\nof his wrath, and at this moment it was such support that she most\nneeded. As they journeyed together in the cab, the married sister\nseemed to be in the higher spirits of the two. She was sure, at any\nrate, that those to whom she was going would place themselves on her\nside. Nora had her own story to tell about Hugh Stanbury, and was\nby no means so sure that her tale would be received with cordial\nagreement. \"Let me tell them myself,\" she whispered to her sister.\n\"Not to-night, because they will have so much to say to you; but I\nshall tell mamma to-morrow.\"\n\nThe train by which the Rowleys were to reach London was due at the\nstation at 7.30 p.m., and the two sisters timed their despatch from\nSt. Diddulph's so as to enable them to reach the hotel at eight. \"We\nshall be there now before mamma,\" said Nora, \"because they will have\nso much luggage, and so many things, and the trains are always late.\"\nWhen they started from the door of the parsonage, Mr. Outhouse gave\nthe direction to the cabman, \"Gregg's Hotel, Baker Street.\" Then at\nonce he began to console himself in that they were gone.\n\nIt was a long drive from St. Diddulph's in the east, to Marylebone in\nthe west, of London. None of the party in the cab knew anything of\nthe region through which they passed. The cabman took the line by the\nback of the Bank, and Finsbury Square and the City Road, thinking it\nbest, probably, to avoid the crush at Holborn Hill, though at the\nexpense of something of a circuit. But of this Mrs. Trevelyan and\nNora knew nothing. Had their way taken them along Piccadilly, or\nthrough Mayfair, or across Grosvenor Square, they would have known\nwhere they were; but at present they were not thinking of those once\nmuch-loved localities. The cab passed the Angel, and up and down the\nhill at Pentonville, and by the King's Cross stations, and through\nEuston Square,--and then it turned up Gower Street. Surely the man\nshould have gone on along the New Road, now that he had come so far\nout of his way. But of this the two ladies knew nothing,--nor did the\nnurse. It was a dark, windy night, but the lamps in the streets had\ngiven them light, so that they had not noticed the night. Nor did\nthey notice it now as the streets became narrower and darker. They\nwere hardly thinking that their journey was yet at an end, and the\nmother was in the act of covering her boy's face as he lay asleep on\nthe nurse's lap, when the cab was stopped. Nora looking out through\nthe window, saw the word \"Hotel\" over a doorway, and was satisfied.\n\"Shall I take the child, ma'am?\" said a man in black, and the child\nwas handed out. Nora was the first to follow, and she then perceived\nthat the door of the hotel was not open. Mrs. Trevelyan followed;\nand then they looked round them,--and the child was gone. They heard\nthe rattle of another cab as it was carried away at a gallop round a\ndistant corner;--and then some inkling of what had happened came upon\nthem. The father had succeeded in getting possession of his child.\n\nIt was a narrow, dark street, very quiet, having about it a certain\nair of poor respectability,--an obscure, noiseless street, without\neven a sign of life. Some unfortunate one had endeavoured here to\nkeep an hotel;--but there was no hotel kept there now. There had\nbeen much craft in selecting the place in which the child had been\ntaken from them. As they looked around them, perceiving the terrible\nmisfortune which had befallen them, there was not a human being near\nthem save the cabman, who was occupied in unchaining, or pretending\nto unchain the heavy mass of luggage on the roof. The windows of\nthe house before which they were stopping, were closed, and Nora\nperceived at once that the hotel was not inhabited. The cabman must\nhave perceived it also. As for the man who had taken the child, the\nnurse could only say that he was dressed in black, like a waiter,\nthat he had a napkin under his arm, and no hat on his head. He had\ntaken the boy tenderly in his arms,--and then she had seen nothing\nfurther. The first thing that Nora had seen, as she stood on the\npavement, was the other cab moving off rapidly.\n\nMrs. Trevelyan had staggered against the railings, and was soon\nscreaming in her wretchedness. Before long there was a small crowd\naround them, comprising three or four women, a few boys, an old man\nor two,--and a policeman. To the policeman Nora had soon told the\nwhole story, and the cabman was of course attacked. But the cabman\nplayed his part very well. He declared that he had done just what\nhe had been told to do. Nora was indeed sure that she had heard her\nuncle desire him to drive to Gregg's Hotel in Baker Street. The\ncabman in answer to this, declared that he had not clearly heard the\nold gentleman's directions; but that a man whom he had conceived to\nbe a servant, had very plainly told him to drive to Parker's Hotel,\nMowbray Street, Gower Street. \"I comed ever so far out of my way,\"\nsaid the cabman, \"to avoid the rumpus with the homnibuses at the\nhill,--cause the ladies' things is so heavy we'd never got up if the\n'orse had once jibbed.\" All which, though it had nothing to do with\nthe matter, seemed to impress the policeman with the idea that the\ncabman, if not a true man, was going to be too clever for them on\nthis occasion. And the crafty cabman went on to declare that his\nhorse was so tired with the load that he could not go on to Baker\nStreet. They must get another cab. Take his number! Of course they\ncould take his number. There was his number. His fare was four and\nsix,--that is if the ladies wouldn't pay him anything extra for the\nterrible load; and he meant to have it. It would be sixpence more if\nthey kept him there many minutes longer. The number was taken, and\nanother cab was got, and the luggage was transferred, and the money\nwas paid, while the unhappy mother was still screaming in hysterics\nagainst the railings. What had been done was soon clear enough to all\nthose around her. Nora had told the policeman, and had told one of\nthe women, thinking to obtain their sympathy and assistance. \"It's\nthe kid's dada as has taken it,\" said one man, \"and there ain't\nnothing to be done.\" There was nothing to be done;--nothing at any\nrate then and there.\n\nNora had been very eager that the cabman should be arrested; but the\npoliceman assured her that such an arrest was out of the question,\nand would have been useless had it been possible. The man would be\nforthcoming if his presence should be again desired, but he had\nprobably,--so said the policeman,--really been desired to drive to\nMowbray Street. \"They knows where to find me if they wants me,--only\nI must be paid my time,\" said the cabman confidently. And the\npoliceman was of opinion that as the boy had been kidnapped on behalf\nof the father, no legal steps could be taken either for the recovery\nof the child or for the punishment of the perpetrators of the act. He\ngot up, however, on the box of the cab, and accompanied the party to\nthe hotel in Baker Street. They reached it almost exactly at the same\ntime with Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley, and the reader must imagine\nthe confusion, the anguish, and the disappointment of that meeting.\nMrs. Trevelyan was hardly in possession of her senses when she\nreached her mother, and could not be induced to be tranquil even when\nshe was assured by her father that her son would suffer no immediate\nevil by being transferred to his father's hands. She in her frenzy\ndeclared that she would never see her little one again, and seemed to\nthink that the father might not improbably destroy the child. \"He is\nmad, papa, and does not know what he does. Do you mean to say that a\nmadman may do as he pleases?--that he may rob my child from me in the\nstreets?--that he may take him out of my very arms in that way?\" And\nshe was almost angry with her father because no attempt was made that\nnight to recover the boy.\n\nSir Marmaduke, who was not himself a good lawyer, had been closeted\nwith the policeman for a quarter of an hour, and had learned the\npoliceman's views. Of course, the father of the child was the person\nwho had done the deed. Whether the cabman had been in the plot or\nnot, was not matter of much consequence. There could be no doubt that\nsome one had told the man to go to Parker's Hotel, as the cab was\nstarting; and it would probably be impossible to punish him in the\nteeth of such instructions. Sir Marmaduke, however, could doubtless\nhave the cabman summoned. And as for the absolute abduction of the\nchild, the policeman was of opinion that a father could not be\npunished for obtaining possession of his son by such a stratagem,\nunless the custody of the child had been made over to the mother\nby some court of law. The policeman, indeed, seemed to think that\nnothing could be done, and Sir Marmaduke was inclined to agree with\nhim. When this was explained to Mrs. Trevelyan by her mother, she\nagain became hysterical in her agony, and could hardly be restrained\nfrom going forth herself to look for her lost treasure.\n\nIt need hardly be further explained that Trevelyan had planned the\nstratagem in concert with Mr. Bozzle. Bozzle, though strongly\ncautioned by his wife to keep himself out of danger in the matter,\nwas sorely tempted by his employer's offer of a hundred pounds.\nHe positively refused to be a party to any attempt at violence at\nSt. Diddulph's; but when he learned, as he did learn, that Mrs.\nTrevelyan, with her sister and baby, were to be transferred from St.\nDiddulph's in a cab to Baker Street, and that the journey was luckily\nto be made during the shades of evening, his active mind went to\nwork, and he arranged the plan. There were many difficulties, and\neven some pecuniary difficulty. He bargained that he should have his\nhundred pounds clear of all deduction for expenses, and then the\nattendant expenses were not insignificant. It was necessary that\nthere should be four men in the service, all good and true; and men\nrequire to be well paid for such goodness and truth. There was the\nman, himself an ex-policeman, who gave the instructions to the first\ncabman, as he was starting. The cabman would not undertake the job at\nall unless he were so instructed on the spot, asserting that in this\nway he would be able to prove that the orders he obeyed came from\nthe lady's husband. And there was the crafty pseudo-waiter, with the\nnapkin and no hat, who had carried the boy to the cab in which his\nfather was sitting. And there were the two cabmen. Bozzle planned\nit all, and with some difficulty arranged the preliminaries. How\nsuccessful was the scheme, we have seen; and Bozzle, for a month, was\nable to assume a superiority over his wife, which that honest woman\nfound to be very disagreeable. \"There ain't no fraudulent abduction\nin it at all,\" Bozzle exclaimed, \"because a wife ain't got no rights\nagain her husband,--not in such a matter as that.\" Mrs. Bozzle\nimplied that if her husband were to take her child away from her\nwithout her leave, she'd let him know something about it. But as\nthe husband had in his possession the note for a hundred pounds,\nrealized, Mrs. Bozzle had not much to say in support of her view of\nthe case.\n\nOn the morning after the occurrence, while Sir Marmaduke was waiting\nwith his solicitor upon a magistrate to find whether anything could\nbe done, the following letter was brought to Mrs. Trevelyan at\nGregg's Hotel:--\n\n\n   Our child is safe with me, and will remain so. If you care\n   to obtain legal advice you will find that I as his father\n   have a right to keep him under my protection. I shall\n   do so; but will allow you to see him as soon as I shall\n   have received a full guarantee that you have no idea of\n   withdrawing him from my charge.\n\n   A home for yourself with me is still open to you,--on\n   condition that you will give me the promise that I have\n   demanded from you; and as long as I shall not hear that\n   you again see or communicate with the person to whose\n   acquaintance I object. While you remain away from me I\n   will cause you to be paid \u00c2\u00a350 a month, as I do not wish\n   that you should be a burden on others. But this payment\n   will depend also on your not seeing or holding any\n   communication with the person to whom I have alluded.\n\n   Your affectionate and offended husband,\n\n   LOUIS TREVELYAN.\n\n   A letter addressed to the Acrobats' Club will reach me.\n\n\nSir Rowley came home dispirited and unhappy, and could not give much\ncomfort to his daughter. The magistrate had told him that though the\ncabman might probably be punished for taking the ladies otherwise\nthan as directed,--if the direction to Baker Street could be\nproved,--nothing could be done to punish the father. The magistrate\nexplained that under a certain Act of Parliament the mother might\napply to the Court of Chancery for the custody of any children under\nseven years of age, and that the court would probably grant such\ncustody,--unless it were shewn that the wife had left her husband\nwithout sufficient cause. The magistrate could not undertake to say\nwhether or no sufficient cause had here been given;--or whether the\nhusband was in fault or the wife. It was, however, clear that nothing\ncould be done without application to the Court of Chancery. It\nappeared,--so said the magistrate,--that the husband had offered a\nhome to his wife, and that in offering it he had attempted to impose\nno conditions which could be shown to be cruel before a judge. The\nmagistrate thought that Mr. Trevelyan had done nothing illegal in\ntaking the child from the cab. Sir Marmaduke, on hearing this, was\nof opinion that nothing could be gained by legal interference. His\nprivate desire was to get hold of Trevelyan and pull him limb from\nlimb. Lady Rowley thought that her daughter had better go back to her\nhusband, let the future consequences be what they might. And the poor\ndesolate mother herself had almost brought herself to offer to do so,\nhaving in her brain some idea that she would after a while be able to\nescape with her boy. As for love for her husband, certainly there was\nnone now left in her bosom. Nor could she teach herself to think it\npossible that she should ever live with him again on friendly terms.\nBut she would submit to anything with the object of getting back her\nboy. Three or four letters were written to Mr. Trevelyan in as many\ndays from his wife, from Lady Rowley, and from Nora; in which various\novertures were made. Trevelyan wrote once again to his wife. She\nknew, he said, already the terms on which she might come back. These\nterms were still open to her. As for the boy, he certainly should not\nleave his father. A meeting might be planned on condition that he,\nTrevelyan, were provided with a written assurance from his wife that\nshe would not endeavour to remove the boy, and that he himself should\nbe present at the meeting.\n\nThus the first week was passed after Sir Marmaduke's return,--and a\nmost wretched time it was for all the party at Gregg's Hotel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nLADY ROWLEY MAKES AN ATTEMPT.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nNothing could be more uncomfortable than the state of Sir Marmaduke\nRowley's family for the first ten days after the arrival in London of\nthe Governor of the Mandarin Islands. Lady Rowley had brought with\nher two of her girls,--the third and fourth,--and, as we know, had\nbeen joined by the two eldest, so that there was a large family\nof ladies gathered together. A house had been taken in Manchester\nStreet, to which they had intended to transfer themselves after a\nsingle night passed at Gregg's Hotel. But the trouble and sorrow\ninflicted upon them by the abduction of Mrs. Trevelyan's child, and\nthe consequent labours thrust upon Sir Marmaduke's shoulders had been\nso heavy, that they had slept six nights at the hotel, before they\nwere able to move themselves into the house prepared for them. By\nthat time all idea had been abandoned of recovering the child by any\nlegal means to be taken as a consequence of the illegality of the\nabduction. The boy was with his father, and the lawyers seemed to\nthink that the father's rights were paramount,--as he had offered a\nhome to his wife without any conditions which a court of law would\nadjudge to be cruel. If she could shew that he had driven her to live\napart from him by his own bad conduct, then probably the custody of\nher boy might be awarded to her, until the child should be seven\nyears old. But when the circumstances of the case were explained to\nSir Marmaduke's lawyer by Lady Rowley, that gentleman shook his head.\nMrs. Trevelyan had, he said, no case with which she could go into\ncourt. Then by degrees there were words whispered as to the husband's\nmadness. The lawyer said that that was a matter for the doctors. If\na certain amount of medical evidence could be obtained to shew that\nthe husband was in truth mad, the wife could, no doubt, obtain the\ncustody of the child. When this was reported to Mrs. Trevelyan, she\ndeclared that conduct such as her husband's must suffice to prove any\nman to be mad; but at this Sir Marmaduke shook his head, and Lady\nRowley sat, sadly silent, with her daughter's hand within her own.\nThey would not dare to tell her that she could regain her child by\nthat plea.\n\nDuring those ten days they did not learn whither the boy had been\ncarried, nor did they know even where the father might be found. Sir\nMarmaduke followed up the address as given in the letter, and learned\nfrom the porter at \"The Acrobats\" that the gentleman's letters\nwere sent to No. 55, Stony Walk, Union Street, Borough. To this\nuncomfortable locality Sir Marmaduke travelled more than once. Thrice\nhe went thither, intent on finding his son-in-law's residence. On the\ntwo first occasions he saw no one but Mrs. Bozzle; and the discretion\nof that lady in declining to give any information was most admirable.\n\"Trewillian!\" Yes, she had heard the name certainly. It might be that\nher husband had business engagements with a gent of that name. She\nwould not say even that for certain, as it was not her custom ever\nto make any inquiries as to her husband's business engagements. Her\nhusband's business engagements were, she said, much too important\nfor the \"likes of she\" to know anything about them. When was\nBozzle likely to be at home? Bozzle was never likely to be at home.\nAccording to her showing, Bozzle was of all husbands the most\nerratic. He might perhaps come in for an hour or two in the middle of\nthe day on a Wednesday, or perhaps would take a cup of tea at home on\nFriday evening. But anything so fitful and uncertain as were Bozzle's\nappearances in the bosom of his family was not to be conceived in the\nmind of woman. Sir Marmaduke then called in the middle of the day on\nWednesday, but Bozzle was reported to be away in the provinces. His\nwife had no idea in which of the provinces he was at that moment\nengaged. The persevering governor from the islands called again on\nthe Friday evening, and then, by chance, Bozzle was found at home.\nBut Sir Marmaduke succeeded in gaining very little information\neven from Bozzle. The man acknowledged that he was employed by Mr.\nTrevelyan. Any letter or parcel left with him for Mr. Trevelyan\nshould be duly sent to that gentleman. If Sir Marmaduke wanted Mr.\nTrevelyan's address, he could write to Mr. Trevelyan and ask for it.\nIf Mr. Trevelyan declined to give it, was it likely that he, Bozzle,\nshould betray it? Sir Marmaduke explained who he was at some length.\nBozzle with a smile assured the governor that he knew very well\nwho he was. He let drop a few words to show that he was intimately\nacquainted with the whole course of Sir Marmaduke's family affairs.\nHe knew all about the Mandarins, and Colonel Osborne, and Gregg's\nHotel,--not that he said anything about Parker's Hotel,--and the\nColonial Office. He spoke of Miss Nora, and even knew the names of\nthe other two young ladies, Miss Sophia and Miss Lucy. It was a\nweakness with Bozzle,--that of displaying his information. He would\nhave much liked to be able to startle Sir Marmaduke by describing\nthe Government House in the island, or by telling him something of\nhis old carriage-horses. But of such information as Sir Marmaduke\ndesired, Sir Marmaduke got none.\n\nAnd there were other troubles which fell very heavily upon the poor\ngovernor, who had come home as it were for a holiday, and who was a\nman hating work naturally, and who, from the circumstances of his\nlife, had never been called on to do much work. A man may govern the\nMandarins and yet live in comparative idleness. To do such governing\nwork well a man should have a good presence, a flow of words which\nshould mean nothing, an excellent temper, and a love of hospitality.\nWith these attributes Sir Rowley was endowed; for, though his\ndisposition was by nature hot, for governing purposes it had been\nbrought by practice under good control. He had now been summoned\nhome through the machinations of his dangerous old friend Colonel\nOsborne, in order that he might give the results of his experience in\ngoverning before a committee of the House of Commons. In coming to\nEngland on this business he had thought much more of his holiday, of\nhis wife and children, of his daughters at home, of his allowance per\nday while he was to be away from his government, and of his salary to\nbe paid to him entire during his absence, instead of being halved as\nit would be if he were away on leave,--he had thought much more in\ncoming home on these easy and pleasant matters, than he did on the\nwork that was to be required from him when he arrived. And then it\ncame to pass that he felt himself almost injured when the Colonial\nOffice demanded his presence from day to day, and when clerks\nbothered him with questions as to which they expected ready replies,\nbut in replying to which Sir Marmaduke was by no means ready. The\nworking men at the Colonial Office had not quite thought that Sir\nMarmaduke was the most fitting man for the job in hand. There was a\ncertain Mr. Thomas Smith at another set of islands in quite another\npart of the world, who was supposed by these working men at home to\nbe a very paragon of a governor. If he had been had home,--so said\nthe working men,--no Committee of the House would have been able to\nmake anything of him. They might have asked him questions week after\nweek, and he would have answered them all fluently and would have\ncommitted nobody. He knew all the ins and outs of governing,--did\nMr. Thomas Smith,--and was a match for the sharpest Committee that\never sat at Westminster. Poor Sir Marmaduke was a man of a very\ndifferent sort; all of which was known by the working men; but\nthe Parliamentary interest had been too strong, and here was Sir\nMarmaduke at home. But the working men were not disposed to make\nmatters so pleasant for Sir Marmaduke, as Sir Marmaduke had expected.\nThe Committee would not examine Sir Marmaduke till after Easter, in\nthe middle of April; but it was expected of him that he should read\nblue-books without number, and he was so catechised by the working\nmen that he almost began to wish himself back at the Mandarins. In\nthis way the new establishment in Manchester Street was not at first\nin a happy or even in a contented condition.\n\nAt last, after about ten days, Lady Rowley did succeed in obtaining\nan interview with Trevelyan. A meeting was arranged through Bozzle,\nand took place in a very dark and gloomy room at an inn in the City.\nWhy Bozzle should have selected the Bremen Coffee House, in Poulter's\nAlley, for this meeting no fit reason can surely be given, unless\nit was that he conceived himself bound to select the most dreary\nlocality within his knowledge on so melancholy an occasion. Poulter's\nAlley is a narrow dark passage somewhere behind the Mansion House;\nand the Bremen Coffee House,--why so called no one can now tell,--is\none of those strange houses of public resort in the City at which\nthe guests seem never to eat, never to drink, never to sleep, but to\ncome in and out after a mysterious and almost ghostly fashion, seeing\ntheir friends,--or perhaps their enemies, in nooks and corners, and\ncarrying on their conferences in low, melancholy whispers. There is\nan aged waiter at the Bremen Coffee House; and there is certainly\none private sitting-room up-stairs. It was a dingy, ill-furnished\nroom, with an old large mahogany table, an old horse-hair sofa, six\nhorse-hair chairs, two old round mirrors, and an old mahogany press\nin a corner. It was a chamber so sad in its appearance that no\nwholesome useful work could have been done within it; nor could men\nhave eaten there with any appetite, or have drained the flowing bowl\nwith any touch of joviality. It was generally used for such purposes\nas that to which it was now appropriated, and no doubt had been\ntaken by Bozzle on more than one previous occasion. Here Lady Rowley\narrived precisely at the hour fixed, and was told that the gentleman\nwas waiting up-stairs for her.\n\nThere had, of course, been many family consultations as to the manner\nin which this meeting should be arranged. Should Sir Marmaduke\naccompany his wife;--or, perhaps, should Sir Marmaduke go alone? Lady\nRowley had been very much in favour of meeting Mr. Trevelyan without\nany one to assist her in the conference. As for Sir Marmaduke, no\nmeeting could be concluded between him and his son-in-law without a\npersonal, and probably a violent quarrel. Of that Lady Rowley had\nbeen quite sure. Sir Marmaduke, since he had been home, had, in the\nmidst of his various troubles, been driven into so vehement a state\nof indignation against his son-in-law as to be unable to speak of\nthe wretched man without strongest terms of opprobrium. Nothing was\ntoo bad to be said by him of one who had ill-treated his dearest\ndaughter. It must be admitted that Sir Marmaduke had heard only\none side of the question. He had questioned his daughter, and had\nconstantly seen his old friend Osborne. The Colonel's journey down\nto Devonshire had been made to appear the most natural proceeding\nin the world. The correspondence of which Trevelyan thought so much\nhad been shown to consist of such notes as might pass between any\nold gentleman and any young woman. The promise which Trevelyan had\nendeavoured to exact, and which Mrs. Trevelyan had declined to give,\nappeared to the angry father to be a monstrous insult. He knew that\nthe Colonel was an older man than himself, and his Emily was still to\nhim only a young girl. It was incredible to him that anybody should\nhave regarded his old comrade as his daughter's lover. He did not\nbelieve that anybody had, in truth, so regarded the man. The tale had\nbeen a monstrous invention on the part of the husband, got up because\nhe had become tired of his young wife. According to Sir Marmaduke's\nway of thinking, Trevelyan should either be thrashed within an inch\nof his life, or else locked up in a mad-house. Colonel Osborne shook\nhis head, and expressed a conviction that the poor man was mad.\n\nBut Lady Rowley was more hopeful. Though she was as confident about\nher daughter as was the father, she was less confident about the old\nfriend. She, probably, was alive to the fact that a man of fifty\nmight put on the airs and assume the character of a young lover;\nand acting on that suspicion, entertaining also some hope that bad\nas matters now were they might be mended, she had taken care that\nColonel Osborne and Mrs. Trevelyan should not be brought together.\nSir Marmaduke had fumed, but Lady Rowley had been firm. \"If you think\nso, mamma,\" Mrs. Trevelyan had said, with something of scorn in her\ntone,--\"of course let it be so.\" Lady Rowley had said that it would\nbe better so; and the two had not seen each other since the memorable\nvisit to Nuncombe Putney. And now Lady Rowley was about to meet her\nson-in-law with some slight hope that she might arrange affairs.\nShe was quite aware that present indignation, though certainly a\ngratification, might be indulged in at much too great a cost. It\nwould be better for all reasons that Emily should go back to her\nhusband and her home, and that Trevelyan should be forgiven for his\niniquities.\n\nBozzle was at the tavern during the interview, but he was not seen\nby Lady Rowley. He remained seated down-stairs, in one of the dingy\ncorners, ready to give assistance to his patron should assistance be\nneeded. When Lady Rowley was shown into the gloomy sitting-room by\nthe old waiter, she found Trevelyan alone, standing in the middle of\nthe room, and waiting for her. \"This is a sad occasion,\" he said, as\nhe advanced to give her his hand.\n\n\"A very sad occasion, Louis.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you may have heard of what has occurred, Lady\nRowley. It is natural, however, to suppose that you must have heard\nme spoken of with censure.\"\n\n\"I think my child has been ill used, Louis,\" she replied.\n\n\"Of course you do. I could not expect that it should be otherwise.\nWhen it was arranged that I should meet you here, I was quite aware\nthat you would have taken the side against me before you had heard\nmy story. It is I that have been ill used,--cruelly misused; but I\ndo not expect that you should believe me. I do not wish you to do.\nI would not for worlds separate the mother from her daughter.\"\n\n\"But why have you separated your own wife from her child?\"\n\n\"Because it was my duty. What! Is a father not to have the charge\nof his own son? I have done nothing, Lady Rowley, to justify a\nseparation which is contrary to the laws of nature.\"\n\n\"Where is the boy, Louis?\"\n\n\"Ah;--that is just what I am not prepared to tell any one who has\ntaken my wife's side till I know that my wife has consented to pay to\nme that obedience which I, as her husband, have a right to demand. If\nEmily will do as I request of her, as I command her,\"--as Trevelyan\nsaid this, he spoke in a tone which was intended to give the highest\npossible idea of his own authority and dignity,--\"then she may see\nher child without delay.\"\n\n\"What is it you request of my daughter?\"\n\n\"Obedience;--simply that. Submission to my will, which is surely a\nwife's duty. Let her beg my pardon for what has occurred,--\"\n\n\"She cannot do that, Louis.\"\n\n\"And solemnly promise me,\" continued Trevelyan, not deigning to\nnotice Lady Rowley's interruption, \"that she will hold no further\nintercourse with that snake in the grass who wormed his way into my\nhouse,--let her be humble, and penitent, and affectionate, and then\nshe shall be restored to her husband and to her child.\" He said this\nwalking up and down the room, and waving his hand, as though he were\nmaking a speech that was intended to be eloquent,--as though he had\nconceived that he was to overcome his mother-in-law by the weight\nof his words and the magnificence of his demeanour. And yet his\ndemeanour was ridiculous, and his words would have had no weight had\nthey not tended to show Lady Rowley how little prospect there was\nthat she should be able to heal this breach. He himself, too, was so\naltered in appearance since she had last seen him, bright with the\nhopes of his young married happiness, that she would hardly have\nrecognised him had she met him in the street. He was thin, and pale,\nand haggard, and mean. And as he stalked up and down the room, it\nseemed to her that the very character of the man was changed. She\nhad not previously known him to be pompous, unreasonable, and absurd.\nShe did not answer him at once, as she perceived that he had not\nfinished his address;--and, after a moment's pause, he continued.\n\"Lady Rowley, there is nothing I would not have done for your\ndaughter,--for my wife. All that I had was hers. I did not dictate to\nher any mode of life; I required from her no sacrifices; I subjected\nher to no caprices; but I was determined to be master in my own\nhouse.\"\n\n\"I do not think, Louis, that she has ever denied your right to be\nmaster.\"\n\n\"To be master in my own house, and to be paramount in my influence\nover her. So much I had a right to demand.\"\n\n\"Who has denied your right?\"\n\n\"She has submitted herself to the counsels and to the influences of a\nman who has endeavoured to undermine me in her affection. In saying\nthat I make my accusation as light against her as is possible. I\nmight make it much heavier, and yet not sin against the truth.\"\n\n\"This is an illusion, Louis.\"\n\n\"Ah;--well. No doubt it becomes you to defend your child. Was it\nan illusion when he went to Devonshire? Was it an illusion when he\ncorresponded with her,--contrary to my express orders,--both before\nand after that unhallowed journey? Lady Rowley, there must be no more\nsuch illusions. If my wife means to come back to me, and to have her\nchild in her own hands, she must be penitent as regards the past, and\nobedient as regards the future.\"\n\nThere was a wicked bitterness in that word penitent which almost\nmaddened Lady Rowley. She had come to this meeting believing that\nTrevelyan would be rejoiced to take back his wife, if details could\nbe arranged for his doing so which should not subject him to the\nnecessity of crying, peccavi; but she found him speaking of his wife\nas though he would be doing her the greatest possible favour in\nallowing her to come back to him dressed in sackcloth, and with ashes\non her head. She could understand from what she had heard that his\ntone and manner were much changed since he obtained possession of\nthe child, and that he now conceived that he had his wife within his\npower. That he should become a tyrant because he had the power to\ntyrannise was not in accordance with her former conception of the\nman's character;--but then he was so changed, that she felt that\nshe knew nothing of the man who now stood before her. \"I cannot\nacknowledge that my daughter has done anything that requires\npenitence,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"I dare say not; but my view is different.\"\n\n\"She cannot admit herself to be wrong when she knows herself to be\nright. You would not have her confess to a fault, the very idea of\nwhich has always been abhorrent to her?\"\n\n\"She must be crushed in spirit, Lady Rowley, before she can again\nbecome a pure and happy woman.\"\n\n\"This is more than I can bear,\" said Lady Rowley, now, at last,\nworked up to a fever of indignation. \"My daughter, sir, is as pure a\nwoman as you have ever known, or are likely to know. You, who should\nhave protected her against the world, will some day take blame to\nyourself as you remember that you have so cruelly maligned her.\" Then\nshe walked away to the door, and would not listen to the words which\nhe was hurling after her. She went down the stairs, and out of the\nhouse, and at the end of Poulter's Alley found the cab which was\nwaiting for her.\n\nTrevelyan, as soon as he was alone, rang the bell, and sent for\nBozzle. And while the waiter was coming to him, and until his\nmyrmidon had appeared, he continued to stalk up and down the room,\nwaving his hand in the air as though he were continuing his speech.\n\"Bozzle,\" said he, as soon as the man had closed the door, \"I have\nchanged my mind.\"\n\n\"As how, Mr. Trewillian?\"\n\n\"I shall make no further attempt. I have done all that man can do,\nand have done it in vain. Her father and mother uphold her in her\nconduct, and she is lost to me,--for ever.\"\n\n\"But the boy, Mr. T.?\"\n\n\"I have my child. Yes,--I have my child. Poor infant. Bozzle, I look\nto you to see that none of them learn our retreat.\"\n\n\"As for that, Mr. Trewillian,--why facts is to be come at by one\nparty pretty well as much as by another. Now, suppose the things\nwas changed, wicey warsey,--and as I was hacting for the Colonel's\nparty.\"\n\n\"D---- the Colonel!\" exclaimed Trevelyan.\n\n\"Just so, Mr. Trewillian; but if I was hacting for the other party,\nand they said to me, 'Bozzle,--where's the boy?' why, in three days\nI'd be down on the facts. Facts is open, Mr. Trewillian, if you knows\nwhere to look for them.\"\n\n\"I shall take him abroad,--at once.\"\n\n\"Think twice of it, Mr. T. The boy is so young, you see, and a\nmother's 'art is softer and lovinger than anything. I'd think twice\nof it, Mr. T., before I kept 'em apart.\" This was a line of thought\nwhich Mr. Bozzle's conscience had not forced him to entertain to the\nprejudice of his professional arrangements; but now, as he conversed\nwith his employer, and became by degrees aware of the failure of\nTrevelyan's mind, some shade of remorse came upon him, and made him\nsay a word on behalf of the \"other party.\"\n\n\"Am I not always thinking of it? What else have they left me to think\nof? That will do for to-day. You had better come down to me to-morrow\nafternoon.\" Bozzle promised obedience to these instructions, and as\nsoon as his patron had started he paid the bill, and took himself\nhome.\n\nLady Rowley, as she travelled back to her house in Manchester Street,\nalmost made up her mind that the separation between her daughter and\nher son-in-law had better be continued. It was a very sad conclusion\nto which to come, but she could not believe that any high-spirited\nwoman could long continue to submit herself to the caprices of a\nman so unreasonable and dictatorial as he to whom she had just been\nlistening. Were it not for the boy, there would, she felt, be no\ndoubt upon the matter. And now, as matters stood, she thought that\nit should be their great object to regain possession of the child.\nThen she endeavoured to calculate what would be the result to her\ndaughter, if in very truth it should be found that the wretched\nman was mad. To hope for such a result seemed to her to be very\nwicked;--and yet she hardly knew how not to hope for it.\n\n\"Well, mamma,\" said Emily Trevelyan, with a faint attempt at a smile,\n\"you saw him?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest, I saw him. I can only say that he is a most\nunreasonable man.\"\n\n\"And he would tell you nothing of Louey?\"\n\n\"No dear,--not a word.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nSIR MARMADUKE AT HOME.\n\n\nNora Rowley had told her lover that there was to be no further\ncommunication between them till her father and mother should be\nin England; but in telling him so, had so frankly confessed her\nown affection for him and had so sturdily promised to be true to\nhim, that no lover could have been reasonably aggrieved by such an\ninterdiction. Nora was quite conscious of this, and was aware that\nHugh Stanbury had received such encouragement as ought at any rate to\nbring him to the new Rowley establishment, as soon as he should learn\nwhere it had fixed itself. But when at the end of ten days he had\nnot shown himself, she began to feel doubts. Could it be that he had\nchanged his mind, that he was unwilling to encounter refusal from her\nfather, or that he had found, on looking into his own affairs more\nclosely, that it would be absurd for him to propose to take a wife to\nhimself while his means were so poor and so precarious? Sir Marmaduke\nduring this time had been so unhappy, so fretful, so indignant,\nand so much worried, that Nora herself had become almost afraid of\nhim; and, without much reasoning on the matter, had taught herself\nto believe that Hugh might be actuated by similar fears. She had\nintended to tell her mother of what had occurred between her and\nStanbury the first moment that she and Lady Rowley were together; but\nthen there had fallen upon them that terrible incident of the loss\nof the child, and the whole family had become at once so wrapped up\nin the agony of the bereaved mother, and so full of rage against the\nunreasonable father, that there seemed to Nora to be no possible\nopportunity for the telling of her own love-story. Emily herself\nappeared to have forgotten it in the midst of her own misery, and had\nnot mentioned Hugh Stanbury's name since they had been in Manchester\nStreet. We have all felt how on occasions our own hopes and fears,\nnay, almost our own individuality, become absorbed in and obliterated\nby the more pressing cares and louder voices of those around us. Nora\nhardly dared to allude to herself while her sister's grief was still\nso prominent, and while her father was daily complaining of his own\npersonal annoyances at the Colonial Office. It seemed to her that at\nsuch a moment she could not introduce a new matter for dispute, and\nperhaps a new subject of dismay.\n\nNevertheless, as the days passed by, and as she saw nothing of Hugh\nStanbury, her heart became sore and her spirit vexed. It seemed to\nher that if she were now deserted by him, all the world would be\nover for her. The Glascock episode in her life had passed by,--that\nepisode which might have been her history, which might have been a\nhistory so prosperous, so magnificent, and probably so happy. As she\nthought of herself and of circumstances as they had happened to her,\nof the resolutions which she had made as to her own career when she\nfirst came to London, and of the way in which she had thrown all\nthose resolutions away in spite of the wonderful success which had\ncome in her path, she could not refrain from thinking that she had\nbrought herself to shipwreck by her own indecision. It must not be\nimagined that she regretted what she had done. She knew very well\nthat to have acted otherwise than she did when Mr. Glascock came\nto her at Nuncombe Putney would have proved her to be heartless,\nselfish, and unwomanly. Long before that time she had determined that\nit was her duty to marry a rich man,--and, if possible, a man in\nhigh position. Such a one had come to her,--one endowed with all the\ngood things of the world beyond her most sanguine expectation,--and\nshe had rejected him! She knew that she had been right because she\nhad allowed herself to love the other man. She did not repent what\nshe had done, the circumstances being as they were, but she almost\nregretted that she had been so soft in heart, so susceptible of the\nweakness of love, so little able to do as she pleased with herself.\nOf what use to her was it that she loved this man with all her\nstrength of affection when he never came to her, although the time at\nwhich he had been told that he might come was now ten days past?\n\nShe was sitting one afternoon in the drawing-room listlessly\nreading, or pretending to read, a novel, when, on a sudden, Hugh\nStanbury was announced. The circumstances of the moment were most\nunfortunate for such a visit. Sir Marmaduke, who had been down at\nWhitehall in the morning, and from thence had made a journey to St.\nDiddulph's-in-the-East and back, was exceedingly cross and out of\ntemper. They had told him at his office that they feared he would not\nsuffice to carry through the purpose for which he had been brought\nhome. And his brother-in-law, the parson, had expressed to him an\nopinion that he was in great part responsible for the misfortune of\nhis daughter, by the encouragement which he had given to such a man\nas Colonel Osborne. Sir Marmaduke had in consequence quarrelled both\nwith the chief clerk and with Mr. Outhouse, and had come home surly\nand discontented. Lady Rowley and her eldest daughter were away,\ncloseted at the moment with Lady Milborough, with whom they were\nendeavouring to arrange some plan by which the boy might at any\nrate be given back. Poor Emily Trevelyan was humble enough now to\nLady Milborough,--was prepared to be humble to any one, and in any\ncircumstances, so that she should not be required to acknowledge that\nshe had entertained Colonel Osborne as her lover. The two younger\ngirls, Sophy and Lucy, were in the room when Stanbury was announced,\nas was also Sir Marmaduke, who at that very moment was uttering angry\ngrowls at the obstinacy and want of reason with which he had been\ntreated by Mr. Outhouse. Now Sir Marmaduke had not so much as heard\nthe name of Hugh Stanbury as yet; and Nora, though her listlessness\nwas all at an end, at once felt how impossible it would be to explain\nany of the circumstances of her case in such an interview as this.\nWhile, however, Hugh's dear steps were heard upon the stairs,\nher feminine mind at once went to work to ascertain in what best\nmode, with what most attractive reason for his presence, she might\nintroduce the young man to her father. Had not the girls been then\npresent, she thought that it might have been expedient to leave Hugh\nto tell his own story to Sir Marmaduke. But she had no opportunity of\nsending her sisters away; and, unless chance should remove them, this\ncould not be done.\n\n\"He is son of the lady we were with at Nuncombe Putney,\" she\nwhispered to her father as she got up to move across the room to\nwelcome her lover. Now Sir Marmaduke had expressed great disapproval\nof that retreat to Dartmoor, and had only understood respecting it\nthat it had been arranged between Trevelyan and the family in whose\ncustody his two daughters had been sent away into banishment. He\nwas not therefore specially disposed to welcome Hugh Stanbury in\nconsequence of this mode of introduction.\n\nHugh, who had asked for Lady Rowley and Mrs. Trevelyan and had\nlearned that they were out before he had mentioned Miss Rowley's\nname, was almost prepared to take his sweetheart into his arms. In\nthat half-minute he had taught himself to expect that he would meet\nher alone, and had altogether forgotten Sir Marmaduke. Young men\nwhen they call at four o'clock in the day never expect to find papas\nat home. And of Sophia and Lucy he had either heard nothing or had\nforgotten what he had heard. He repressed himself however in time,\nand did not commit either Nora or himself by any very vehement\ndemonstration of affection. But he did hold her hand longer than he\nshould have done, and Sir Marmaduke saw that he did so.\n\n\"This is papa,\" said Nora. \"Papa, this is our friend, Mr. Hugh\nStanbury.\" The introduction was made in a manner almost absurdly\nformal, but poor Nora's difficulties lay heavy upon her. Sir\nMarmaduke muttered something;--but it was little more than a grunt.\n\"Mamma and Emily are out,\" continued Nora. \"I dare say they will be\nin soon.\" Sir Marmaduke looked round sharply at the man. Why was he\nto be encouraged to stay till Lady Rowley should return? Lady Rowley\ndid not want to see him. It seemed to Sir Marmaduke, in the midst of\nhis troubles, that this was no time to be making new acquaintances.\n\"These are my sisters, Mr. Stanbury,\" continued Nora. \"This is\nSophia, and this is Lucy.\" Sophia and Lucy would have been thoroughly\nwilling to receive their sister's lover with genial kindness if they\nhad been properly instructed, and if the time had been opportune;\nbut, as it was, they had nothing to say. They, also, could only\nmutter some little sound intended to be more courteous than their\nfather's grunt. Poor Nora!\n\n\"I hope you are comfortable here,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"The house is all very well,\" said Nora, \"but we don't like the\nneighbourhood.\"\n\nHugh also felt that conversation was difficult. He had soon come to\nperceive,--before he had been in the room half a minute,--that the\natmosphere was not favourable to his mission. There was to be no\nembracing or permission for embracing on the present occasion. Had he\nbeen left alone with Sir Marmaduke he would probably have told his\nbusiness plainly, let Sir Marmaduke's manner to him have been what\nit might; but it was impossible for him to do this with three young\nladies in the room with him. Seeing that Nora was embarrassed by\nher difficulties, and that Nora's father was cross and silent, he\nendeavoured to talk to the other girls, and asked them concerning\ntheir journey and the ship in which they had come. But it was very\nup-hill work. Lucy and Sophy could talk as glibly as any young\nladies home from any colony,--and no higher degree of fluency can\nbe expressed;--but now they were cowed. Their elder sister was\nshamefully and most undeservedly disgraced, and this man had had\nsomething,--they knew not what,--to do with it. \"Is Priscilla quite\nwell?\" Nora asked at last.\n\n\"Quite well. I heard from her yesterday. You know they have left the\nClock House.\"\n\n\"I had not heard it.\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--and they are living in a small cottage just outside the\nvillage. And what else do you think has happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing bad, I hope, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"My sister Dorothy has left her aunt, and is living with them again\nat Nuncombe.\"\n\n\"Has there been a quarrel, Mr. Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Well, yes;--after a fashion there has, I suppose. But it is a long\nstory and would not interest Sir Marmaduke. The wonder is that\nDorothy should have been able to stay so long with my aunt. I will\ntell it you all some day.\" Sir Marmaduke could not understand why\na long story about this man's aunt and sister should be told to\nhis daughter. He forgot,--as men always do in such circumstances\nforget,--that, while he was living in the Mandarins, his daughter,\nliving in England, would of course pick up new interest and become\nintimate with new histories. But he did not forget that pressure\nof the hand which he had seen, and he determined that his daughter\nNora could not have any worse lover than the friend of his elder\ndaughter's husband.\n\nStanbury had just determined that he must go, that there was no\npossibility for him either to say or do anything to promote his cause\nat the present moment, when the circumstances were all changed by the\nreturn home of Lady Rowley and Mrs. Trevelyan. Lady Rowley knew, and\nhad for some days known, much more of Stanbury than had come to the\nears of Sir Marmaduke. She understood in the first place that the\nStanburys had been very good to her daughter, and she was aware that\nHugh Stanbury had thoroughly taken her daughter's part against his\nold friend Trevelyan. She would therefore have been prepared to\nreceive him kindly had he not on this very morning been the subject\nof special conversation between her and Emily. But, as it had\nhappened, Mrs. Trevelyan had this very day told Lady Rowley the\nwhole story of Nora's love. The elder sister had not intended to be\ntreacherous to the younger; but in the thorough confidence which\nmutual grief and close conference had created between the mother\nand daughter, everything had at last come out, and Lady Rowley had\nlearned the story, not only of Hugh Stanbury's courtship, but of\nthose rich offers which had been made by the heir to the barony of\nPeterborough.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that Lady Rowley was greatly grieved and\nthoroughly dismayed. It was not only that Mr. Glascock was the eldest\nson of a peer, but that he was represented by the poor suffering wife\nof the ill-tempered man to be a man blessed with a disposition sweet\nas an angel's. \"And she would have liked him,\" Emily had said, \"if\nit had not been for this unfortunate young man.\" Lady Rowley was not\nworse than are other mothers, not more ambitious, or more heartless,\nor more worldly. She was a good mother, loving her children, and\nthoroughly anxious for their welfare. But she would have liked to\nbe the mother-in-law of Lord Peterborough, and she would have liked,\ndearly, to see her second daughter removed from the danger of those\nrocks against which her eldest child had been shipwrecked. And when\nshe asked after Hugh Stanbury, and his means of maintaining a wife,\nthe statement which Mrs. Trevelyan made was not comforting. \"He\nwrites for a penny newspaper,--and, I believe, writes very well,\"\nMrs. Trevelyan had said.\n\n\"For a penny newspaper! Is that respectable?\"\n\n\"His aunt, Miss Stanbury, seemed to think not. But I suppose men of\neducation do write for such things now. He says himself that it is\nvery precarious as an employment.\"\n\n\"It must be precarious, Emily. And has he got nothing?\"\n\n\"Not a penny of his own,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nThen Lady Rowley had thought again of Mr. Glascock, and of the family\ntitle, and of Monkhams. And she thought of her present troubles, and\nof the Mandarins, and the state of Sir Marmaduke's balance at the\nbankers;--and of the other girls, and of all there was before her to\ndo. Here had been a very Apollo among suitors kneeling at her child's\nfeet, and the foolish girl had sent him away for the sake of a young\nman who wrote for a penny newspaper! Was it worth the while of\nany woman to bring up daughters with such results? Lady Rowley,\ntherefore, when she was first introduced to Hugh Stanbury, was not\nprepared to receive him with open arms.\n\nOn this occasion the task of introducing him fell to Mrs. Trevelyan,\nand was done with much graciousness. Emily knew that Hugh Stanbury\nwas her friend, and would sympathise with her respecting her child.\n\"You have heard what has happened to me?\" she said. Stanbury,\nhowever, had heard nothing of that kidnapping of the child. Though\nto the Rowleys it seemed that such a deed of iniquity, done in the\nmiddle of London, must have been known to all the world, he had not\nas yet been told of it;--and now the story was given to him. Mrs.\nTrevelyan herself told it, with many tears and an agony of fresh\ngrief; but still she told it as to one whom she regarded as a sure\nfriend, and from whom she knew that she would receive sympathy. Sir\nMarmaduke sat by the while, still gloomy and out of humour. Why was\ntheir family sorrow to be laid bare to this stranger?\n\n\"It is the cruellest thing I ever heard,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"A dastardly deed,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"But we all feel that for the time he can hardly know what he does,\"\nsaid Nora.\n\n\"And where is the child?\" Stanbury asked.\n\n\"We have not the slightest idea,\" said Lady Rowley. \"I have seen him,\nand he refuses to tell us. He did say that my daughter should see her\nboy; but he now accompanies his offer with such conditions that it is\nimpossible to listen to him.\"\n\n\"And where is he?\"\n\n\"We do not know where he lives. We can reach him only through a\ncertain man--\"\n\n\"Ah, I know the man,\" said Stanbury; \"one who was a policeman once.\nHis name is Bozzle.\"\n\n\"That is the man,\" said Sir Marmaduke. \"I have seen him.\"\n\n\"And of course he will tell us nothing but what he is told to tell\nus,\" continued Lady Rowley. \"Can there be anything so horrible as\nthis,--that a wife should be bound to communicate with her own\nhusband respecting her own child through such a man as that?\"\n\n\"One might possibly find out where he keeps the child,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"If you could manage that, Mr. Stanbury!\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"I hardly see that it would do much good,\" said Hugh. \"Indeed I do\nnot know why he should keep the place a secret. I suppose he has a\nright to the boy until the mother shall have made good her claim\nbefore the court.\" He promised, however, that he would do his best to\nascertain where the child was kept, and where Trevelyan resided, and\nthen,--having been nearly an hour at the house,--he was forced to\nget up and take his leave. He had said not a word to any one of the\nbusiness that had brought him there. He had not even whispered an\nassurance of his affection to Nora. Till the two elder ladies had\ncome in, and the subject of the taking of the boy had been mooted, he\nhad sat there as a perfect stranger. He thought that it was manifest\nenough that Nora had told her secret to no one. It seemed to him\nthat Mrs. Trevelyan must have forgotten it;--that Nora herself must\nhave forgotten it, if such forgetting could be possible! He got up,\nhowever, and took his leave, and was comforted in some slight degree\nby seeing that there was a tear in Nora's eye.\n\n\"Who is he?\" demanded Sir Marmaduke, as soon as the door was closed.\n\n\"He is a young man who was an intimate friend of Louis's,\" answered\nMrs. Trevelyan; \"but he is so no longer, because he sees how\ninfatuated Louis has been.\"\n\n\"And why does he come here?\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"And why does he come here?\"]\n\n\n\"We know him very well,\" continued Mrs. Trevelyan. \"It was he\nthat arranged our journey down to Devonshire. He was very kind\nabout it, and so were his mother and sister. We have every reason\nto be grateful to Mr. Stanbury.\" This was all very well, but\nNora nevertheless felt that the interview had been anything but\nsuccessful.\n\n\"Has he any profession?\" asked Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"He writes for the press,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"What do you mean;--books?\"\n\n\"No;--for a newspaper.\"\n\n\"For a penny newspaper,\" said Nora boldly--\"for the Daily Record.\"\n\n\"Then I hope he won't come here any more,\" said Sir Marmaduke. Nora\npaused a moment, striving to find words for some speech which might\nbe true to her love and yet not unseemly,--but finding no such words\nready, she got up from her seat and walked out of the room. \"What is\nthe meaning of it all?\" asked Sir Marmaduke. There was a silence for\na while, and then he repeated his question in another form. \"Is there\nany reason for his coming here,--about Nora?\"\n\n\"I think he is attached to Nora,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Lady Rowley, \"perhaps we had better not speak about\nit just now.\"\n\n\"I suppose he has not a penny in the world,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"He has what he earns,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"If Nora understands her duty she will never let me hear his name\nagain,\" said Sir Marmaduke. Then there was nothing more said, and as\nsoon as they could escape, both Lady Rowley and Mrs. Trevelyan left\nthe room.\n\n\"I should have told you everything,\" said Nora to her mother that\nnight. \"I had no intention to keep anything a secret from you. But we\nhave all been so unhappy about Louey, that we have had no heart to\ntalk of anything else.\"\n\n\"I understand all that, my darling.\"\n\n\"And I had meant that you should tell papa, for I supposed that\nhe would come. And I meant that he should go to papa himself. He\nintended that himself,--only, to-day,--as things turned out--\"\n\n\"Just so, dearest;--but it does not seem that he has got any income.\nIt would be very rash,--wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"People must be rash sometimes. Everybody can't have an income\nwithout earning it. I suppose people in professions do marry without\nhaving fortunes.\"\n\n\"When they have settled professions, Nora.\"\n\n\"And why is not his a settled profession? I believe he receives quite\nas much at seven and twenty as Uncle Oliphant does at sixty.\"\n\n\"But your Uncle Oliphant's income is permanent.\"\n\n\"Lawyers don't have permanent incomes, or doctors,--or merchants.\"\n\n\"But those professions are regular and sure. They don't marry,\nwithout fortunes, till they have made their incomes sure.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury's income is sure. I don't know why it shouldn't be\nsure. He goes on writing and writing every day, and it seems to me\nthat of all professions in the world it is the finest. I'd much\nsooner write for a newspaper than be one of those old musty, fusty\nlawyers, who'll say anything that they're paid to say.\"\n\n\"My dearest Nora, all that is nonsense. You know as well as I do that\nyou should not marry a man when there is a doubt whether he can keep\na house over your head;--that is his position.\"\n\n\"It is good enough for me, mamma.\"\n\n\"And what is his income from writing?\"\n\n\"It is quite enough for me, mamma. The truth is I have promised, and\nI cannot go back from it. Dear, dear mamma, you won't quarrel with\nus, and oppose us, and make papa hard against us. You can do what you\nlike with papa. I know that. Look at poor Emily. Plenty of money has\nnot made her happy.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Glascock had only asked you a week sooner,\" said Lady Rowley,\nwith a handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\"But you see he didn't, mamma.\"\n\n\"When I think of it I cannot but weep\"--and the poor mother burst out\ninto a full flood of tears--\"such a man, so good, so gentle, and so\ntruly devoted to you.\"\n\n\"Mamma, what's the good of that now?\"\n\n\"Going down all the way to Devonshire after you!\"\n\n\"So did Hugh, mamma.\"\n\n\"A position that any girl in England would have envied you. I cannot\nbut feel it. And Emily says she is sure he would come back if he got\nthe very slightest encouragement.\"\n\n\"That is quite impossible, mamma.\"\n\n\"Why should it be impossible? Emily declares that she never saw a man\nso much in love in her life;--and she says also that she believes he\nis abroad now simply because he is broken-hearted about it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Glascock, mamma, was very nice and good and all that; but indeed\nhe is not the man to suffer from a broken heart. And Emily is quite\nmistaken. I told him the whole truth.\"\n\n\"What truth?\"\n\n\"That there was somebody else that I did love. Then he said that of\ncourse that put an end to it all, and he wished me good-bye ever so\ncalmly.\"\n\n\"How could you be so infatuated? Why should you have cut the ground\naway from your feet in that way?\"\n\n\"Because I chose that there should be an end to it. Now there has\nbeen an end to it; and it is much better, mamma, that we should\nnot think about Mr. Glascock any more. He will never come again to\nme,--and if he did, I could only say the same thing.\"\n\n\"You mustn't be surprised, Nora, if I'm unhappy; that is all. Of\ncourse I must feel it. Such a connection as it would have been for\nyour sisters! Such a home for poor Emily in her trouble! And as for\nthis other man--\"\n\n\"Mamma, don't speak ill of him.\"\n\n\"If I say anything of him, I must say the truth,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Don't say anything against him, mamma, because he is to be my\nhusband. Dear, dear mamma, you can't change me by anything you say.\nPerhaps I have been foolish; but it is settled now. Don't make me\nwretched by speaking against the man whom I mean to love all my life\nbetter than all the world.\"\n\n\"Think of Louis Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"I will think of no one but Hugh Stanbury. I tried not to love him,\nmamma. I tried to think that it was better to make believe that I\nloved Mr. Glascock. But he got the better of me, and conquered me,\nand I will never rebel against him. You may help me, mamma;--but you\ncan't change me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nSIR MARMADUKE AT HIS CLUB.\n\n\nSir Marmaduke had come away from his brother-in-law the parson in\nmuch anger, for Mr. Outhouse, with that mixture of obstinacy and\nhonesty which formed his character, had spoken hard words of Colonel\nOsborne, and words which by implication had been hard also against\nEmily Trevelyan. He had been very staunch to his niece when attacked\nby his niece's husband; but when his sympathies and assistance were\ninvoked by Sir Marmaduke it seemed as though he had transferred his\nallegiance to the other side. He pointed out to the unhappy father\nthat Colonel Osborne had behaved with great cruelty in going to\nDevonshire, that the Stanburys had been untrue to their trust in\nallowing him to enter the house, and that Emily had been \"indiscreet\"\nin receiving him. When a young woman is called indiscreet by her\nfriends it may be assumed that her character is very seriously\nassailed. Sir Marmaduke had understood this, and on hearing the word\nhad become wroth with his brother-in-law. There had been hot words\nbetween them, and Mr. Outhouse would not yield an inch or retract\na syllable. He conceived it to be his duty to advise the father\nto caution his daughter with severity, to quarrel absolutely with\nColonel Osborne, and to let Trevelyan know that this had been done.\nAs to the child, Mr. Outhouse expressed a strong opinion that the\nfather was legally entitled to the custody of his boy, and that\nnothing could be done to recover the child, except what might be\ndone with the father's consent. In fact, Mr. Outhouse made himself\nexceedingly disagreeable, and sent away Sir Marmaduke with a very\nheavy heart. Could it really be possible that his old friend Fred\nOsborne, who seven or eight-and-twenty years ago had been potent\namong young ladies, had really been making love to his old friend's\nmarried daughter? Sir Marmaduke looked into himself, and conceived it\nto be quite out of the question that he should make love to any one.\nA good dinner, good wine, a good cigar, an easy chair, and a rubber\nof whist,--all these things, with no work to do, and men of his own\nstanding around him were the pleasures of life which Sir Marmaduke\ndesired. Now Fred Osborne was an older man than he, and though Fred\nOsborne did keep up a foolish system of padded clothes and dyed\nwhiskers, still,--at fifty-two or fifty-three,--surely a man might be\nreckoned safe. And then, too, that ancient friendship! Sir Marmaduke,\nwho had lived all his life in the comparative seclusion of a colony,\nthought perhaps more of that ancient friendship than did the Colonel,\nwho had lived amidst the blaze of London life, and who had had many\nopportunities of changing his friends. Some inkling of all this\nmade its way into Sir Marmaduke's bosom, as he thought of it with\nbitterness; and he determined that he would have it out with his\nfriend.\n\nHitherto he had enjoyed very few of those pleasant hours which he had\nanticipated on his journey homewards. He had had no heart to go to\nhis club, and he had fancied that Colonel Osborne had been a little\nbackward in looking him up, and providing him with amusement. He had\nsuggested this to his wife, and she had told him that the Colonel had\nbeen right not to come to Manchester Street. \"I have told Emily,\"\nsaid Lady Rowley, \"that she must not meet him, and she is quite of\nthe same opinion.\" Nevertheless, there had been remissness. Sir\nMarmaduke felt that it was so, in spite of his wife's excuses. In\nthis way he was becoming sore with everybody, and very unhappy. It\ndid not at all improve his temper when he was told that his second\ndaughter had refused an offer from Lord Peterborough's eldest son.\n\"Then she may go into the workhouse for me,\" the angry father had\nsaid, declaring at the same time that he would never give his consent\nto her marriage with the man who \"did dirty work\" for the Daily\nRecord,--as he, with his paternal wisdom, chose to express it. But\nthis cruel phrase was not spoken in Nora's hearing, nor was it\nrepeated to her. Lady Rowley knew her husband, and was aware that he\nwould on occasions change his opinion.\n\nIt was not till two or three days after his visit to St. Diddulph's\nthat he met Colonel Osborne. The Easter recess was then over,\nand Colonel Osborne had just returned to London. They met on the\ndoor-steps of \"The Acrobats,\" and the Colonel immediately began\nwith an apology. \"I have been so sorry to be away just when you are\nhere;--upon my word I have. But I was obliged to go down to the\nduchess's. I had promised early in the winter; and those people\nare so angry if you put them off. By George, it's almost as bad as\nputting off royalty.\"\n\n\"D----n the duchess,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the Colonel;--\"only I thought it as well\nthat I should tell you the truth.\"\n\n\"What I mean is, that the duchess and her people make no difference\nto me. I hope you had a pleasant time; that's all.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes, we had. One must get away somewhere at Easter. There is\nno one left at the club, and there's no House, and no one asks one to\ndinner in town. In fact, if one didn't go away one wouldn't know what\nto do. There were ever so many people there that I liked to meet.\nLady Glencora was there, and uncommon pleasant she made it. That\nwoman has more to say for herself than any half-dozen men that I\nknow. And Lord Cantrip, your chief, was there. He said a word or two\nto me about you.\"\n\n\"What sort of a word?\"\n\n\"He says he wishes you would read up some blue-books, or papers, or\nreports, or something of that kind, which he says that some of his\nfellows have sent you. It seems that there are some new rules, or\norders, or fashions, which he wants you to have at your fingers'\nends. Nothing could be more civil than he was,--but he just wished\nme to mention this, knowing that you and I are likely to see each\nother.\"\n\n\"I wish I had never come over,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"They didn't bother me with their new rules and fashions over there.\nWhen the papers came somebody read them, and that was enough. I could\ndo what they wanted me to do there.\"\n\n\"And so you will here,--after a bit.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. Those young fellows seem to forget that\nan old dog can't learn new tricks. They've got a young brisk fellow\nthere who seems to think that a man should be an encyclopedia of\nknowledge because he has lived in a colony over twenty years.\"\n\n\"That's the new under-secretary.\"\n\n\"Never mind who it is. Osborne, just come up to the library, will\nyou? I want to speak to you.\" Then Sir Marmaduke, with considerable\nsolemnity, led the way up to the most deserted room in the club, and\nColonel Osborne followed him, well knowing that something was to be\nsaid about Emily Trevelyan.\n\nSir Marmaduke seated himself on a sofa, and his friend sat close\nbeside him. The room was quite deserted. It was four o'clock in\nthe afternoon, and the club was full of men. There were men in the\nmorning-room, and men in the drawing-room, and men in the card-room,\nand men in the billiard-room; but no better choice of a chamber for\na conference intended to be silent and secret could have been made\nin all London than that which had induced Sir Marmaduke to take his\nfriend into the library of \"The Acrobats.\" And yet a great deal of\nmoney had been spent in providing this library for \"The Acrobats.\"\nSir Marmaduke sat for awhile silent, and had he sat silent for an\nhour, Colonel Osborne would not have interrupted him. Then, at last,\nhe began, with a voice that was intended to be serious, but which\nstruck upon the ear of his companion as being affected and unlike the\nowner of it. \"This is a very sad thing about my poor girl,\" said Sir\nMarmaduke.\n\n\"Indeed it is. There is only one thing to be said about it, Rowley.\"\n\n\"And what's that?\"\n\n\"The man must be mad.\"\n\n\"He is not so mad as to give us any relief by his madness,--poor as\nsuch comfort would be. He has got Emily's child away from her, and\nI think it will about kill her. And what is to become of her? As to\ntaking her back to the islands without her child, it is out of the\nquestion. I never knew anything so cruel in my life.\"\n\n\"And so absurd, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah,--that's just the question. If anybody had asked me, I should\nhave said that you were the man of all men whom I could have best\ntrusted.\"\n\n\"Do you doubt it now?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you suspect me,--and your daughter too?\"\n\n\"No;--by heavens! Poor dear. If I suspected her, there would be an\nend of all things with me. I could never get over that. No; I don't\nsuspect her!\" Sir Marmaduke had now dropped his affected tone, and\nwas speaking with natural energy.\n\n\"But you do me?\"\n\n\"No;--if I did, I don't suppose I should be sitting with you here;\nbut they tell me--\"\n\n\"They tell you what?\"\n\n\"They tell me that,--that you did not behave wisely about it. Why\ncould you not let her alone when you found out how matters were\ngoing?\"\n\n\"Who has been telling you this, Rowley?\"\n\nSir Marmaduke considered for awhile, and then remembering that\nColonel Osborne could hardly quarrel with a clergyman, told him the\ntruth. \"Outhouse says that you have done her an irretrievable injury\nby going down to Devonshire to her, and by writing to her.\"\n\n\"Outhouse is an ass.\"\n\n\"That is easily said;--but why did you go?\"\n\n\"And why should I not go? What the deuce! Because a man like that\nchooses to take vagaries into his head I am not to see my own\ngodchild!\" Sir Marmaduke tried to remember whether the Colonel was in\nfact the godfather of his eldest daughter, but he found that his mind\nwas quite a blank about his children's godfathers and godmothers.\n\"And as for the letters;--I wish you could see them. The only letters\nwhich had in them a word of importance were those about your coming\nhome. I was anxious to get that arranged, not only for your sake, but\nbecause she was so eager about it.\"\n\n\"God bless her, poor child,\" said Sir Marmaduke, rubbing the tears\naway from his eyes with his red silk pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"I will acknowledge that those letters,--there may have been one or\ntwo,--were the beginning of the trouble. It was these that made this\nman show himself to be a lunatic. I do admit that. I was bound not to\ntalk about your coming, and I told her to keep the secret. He went\nspying about, and found her letters, I suppose,--and then he took\nfire because there was to be a secret from him. Dirty, mean dog! And\nnow I'm to be told by such a fellow as Outhouse that it's my fault,\nthat I have caused all the trouble, because, when I happened to be in\nDevonshire, I went to see your daughter!\" We must do the Colonel the\njustice of supposing that he had by this time quite taught himself to\nbelieve that the church porch at Cockchaffington had been the motive\ncause of his journey into Devonshire. \"Upon my word it is too hard,\"\ncontinued he indignantly. \"As for Outhouse,--only for the gown upon\nhis back, I'd pull his nose. And I wish that you would tell him that\nI say so.\"\n\n\"There is trouble enough without that,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"But it is hard. By G----, it is hard. There is this comfort;--if\nit hadn't been me, it would have been some one else. Such a man as\nthat couldn't have gone two or three years, without being jealous of\nsome one. And as for poor Emily, she is better off perhaps with an\naccusation so absurd as this, than she might have been had her name\nbeen joined with a younger man, or with one whom you would have less\nreason for trusting.\"\n\nThere was so much that seemed to be sensible in this, and it was\nspoken with so well assumed a tone of injured innocence, that Sir\nMarmaduke felt that he had nothing more to say. He muttered something\nfurther about the cruelty of the case, and then slunk away out of the\nclub, and made his way home to the dull gloomy house in Manchester\nStreet. There was no comfort for him there;--but neither was there\nany comfort for him at the club. And why did that vexatious Secretary\nof State send him messages about blue books? As he went, he expressed\nsundry wishes that he was back at the Mandarins, and told himself\nthat it would be well that he should remain there till he died.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nMYSTERIOUS AGENCIES.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nWhen the thirty-first of March arrived, Exeter had not as yet been\nmade gay with the marriage festivities of Mr. Gibson and Camilla\nFrench. And this delay had not been the fault of Camilla. Camilla had\nbeen ready, and when, about the middle of the month, it was hinted\nto her that some postponement was necessary, she spoke her mind out\nplainly, and declared that she was not going to stand that kind of\nthing. The communication had not been made to her by Mr. Gibson in\nperson. For some days previously he had not been seen at Heavitree,\nand Camilla had from day to day become more black, gloomy, and harsh\nin her manners both to her mother and her sister. Little notes had\ncome and little notes had gone, but no one in the house, except\nCamilla herself, knew what those notes contained. She would not\ncondescend to complain to Arabella; nor did she say much in\ncondemnation of her lover to Mrs. French, till the blow came. With\nunremitting attention she pursued the great business of her wedding\ngarments, and exacted from the unfortunate Arabella an amount of work\nequal to her own,--of thankless work, as is the custom of embryo\nbrides with their unmarried sisters. And she drew with great audacity\non the somewhat slender means of the family for the amount of\nfeminine gear necessary to enable her to go into Mr. Gibson's house\nwith something of the \u00c3\u00a9clat of a well-provided bride. When Mrs.\nFrench hesitated, and then expostulated, Camilla replied that she did\nnot expect to be married above once, and that in no cheaper or more\nproductive way than this could her mother allow her to consume her\nshare of the family resources. \"What matter, mamma, if you do have to\nborrow a little money? Mr. Burgess will let you have it when he knows\nwhy. And as I shan't be eating and drinking at home any more, nor yet\ngetting my things here, I have a right to expect it.\" And she ended\nby expressing an opinion, in Arabella's hearing, that any daughter\nof a house who proves herself to be capable of getting a husband for\nherself, is entitled to expect that those left at home shall pinch\nthemselves for a time, in order that she may go forth to the world in\na respectable way, and be a credit to the family.\n\nThen came the blow. Mr. Gibson had not been at the house for some\ndays, but the notes had been going and coming. At last Mr. Gibson\ncame himself; but, as it happened, when he came, Camilla was out\nshopping. In these days she often did go out shopping between eleven\nand one, carrying her sister with her. It must have been but a poor\npleasure for Arabella, this witnessing the purchases made, seeing\nthe pleasant draperies, and handling the real linens and admiring\nthe fine cambrics spread out before them on the shop counters by\nobsequious attendants. And the questions asked of her by her sister,\nwhether this was good enough for so august an occasion, or that\nsufficiently handsome, must have been harassing. She could not have\nfailed to remember that it ought all to have been done for her,--that\nhad she not been treated with monstrous injustice, with most\nunsisterly cruelty, all these good things would have been spread on\nher behoof. But she went on and endured it, and worked diligently\nwith her needle, and folded and unfolded as she was desired, and\nbecame as it were quite a younger sister in the house,--creeping out\nby herself now and again into the purlieus of the city, to find such\nconsolation as she might receive from her solitary thoughts.\n\nBut Arabella and Camilla were both away when Mr. Gibson called to\ntell Mrs. French of his altered plans. And as he asked, not for\nhis lady-love, but for Mrs. French herself, it is probable that he\nwatched his opportunity and that he knew to what cares his Camilla\nwas then devoting herself. \"Perhaps it is quite as well that I should\nfind you alone,\" he said, after sundry preludes, to his future\nmother-in-law, \"because you can make Camilla understand this better\nthan I can. I must put off the day for about three weeks.\"\n\n\"Three weeks, Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"Or a month. Perhaps we had better say the 29th of April.\" Mr. Gibson\nhad by this time thrown off every fear that he might have entertained\nof the mother, and could speak to her of such an unwarrantable change\nof plans with tolerable equanimity.\n\n\"But I don't know that that will suit Camilla at all.\"\n\n\"She can name any other day she pleases, of course;--that is, in\nMay.\"\n\n\"But why is this to be?\"\n\n\"There are things about money, Mrs. French, which I cannot arrange\nsooner. And I find that unfortunately I must go up to London.\" Though\nmany other questions were asked, nothing further was got out of\nMr. Gibson on that occasion; and he left the house with a perfect\nunderstanding on his own part,--and on that of Mrs. French,--that the\nmarriage was postponed till some day still to be fixed, but which\ncould not and should not be before the 29th of April. Mrs. French\nasked him why he did not come up and see Camilla. He replied,--false\nman that he was,--that he had hoped to have seen her this morning,\nand that he would come again before the week was over.\n\nThen it was that Camilla spoke her mind out plainly. \"I shall go to\nhis house at once,\" she said, \"and find out all about it. I don't\nunderstand it. I don't understand it at all; and I won't put up with\nit. He shall know who he has to deal with, if he plays tricks upon\nme. Mamma, I wonder you let him out of the house, till you had made\nhim come back to his old day.\"\n\n\"What could I do, my dear?\"\n\n\"What could you do? Shake him out of it,--as I would have done. But\nhe didn't dare to tell me,--because he is a coward.\"\n\nCamilla in all this showed her spirit; but she allowed her anger\nto hurry her away into an indiscretion. Arabella was present, and\nCamilla should have repressed her rage.\n\n\"I don't think he's at all a coward,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"That's my business. I suppose I'm entitled to know what he is better\nthan you.\"\n\n\"All the same I don't think Mr. Gibson is at all a coward,\" said\nArabella, again pleading the cause of the man who had misused her.\n\n\"Now, Arabella, I won't take any interference from you; mind that.\nI say it was cowardly, and he should have come to me. It's my\nconcern, and I shall go to him. I'm not going to be stopped by any\nshilly-shally nonsense, when my future respectability, perhaps, is\nat stake. All Exeter knows that the marriage is to take place on the\n31st of this month.\"\n\nOn the next day Camilla absolutely did go to Mr. Gibson's house at\nan early hour, at nine, when, as she thought, he would surely be at\nbreakfast. But he had flown. He had left Exeter that morning by an\nearly train, and his servant thought that he had gone to London. On\nthe next morning Camilla got a note from him, written in London.\nIt affected to be very cheery and affectionate, beginning \"Dearest\nCammy,\" and alluding to the postponement of his wedding as though\nit were a thing so fixed as to require no further question. Camilla\nanswered this letter, still in much wrath, complaining, protesting,\nexpostulating;--throwing in his teeth the fact that the day had been\nfixed by him, and not by her. And she added a postscript in the\nfollowing momentous words:--\"If you have any respect for the name of\nyour future wife, you will fall back upon your first arrangement.\" To\nthis she got simply a line of an answer, declaring that this falling\nback was impossible, and then nothing was heard of him for ten days.\nHe had gone from Tuesday to Saturday week;--and the first that\nCamilla saw of him was his presence in the reading desk when he\nchaunted the cathedral service as priest-vicar on the Sunday.\n\nAt this time Arabella was very ill, and was confined to her bed.\nMr. Martin declared that her system had become low from over\nanxiety,--that she was nervous, weak, and liable to hysterics,--that\nher feelings were in fact too many for her,--and that her efforts to\novercome them, and to face the realities of the world, had exhausted\nher. This was, of course, not said openly, at the town-cross of\nExeter; but such was the opinion which Mr. Martin gave in confidence\nto the mother. \"Fiddle-de-dee!\" said Camilla, when she was told of\nfeelings, susceptibilities, and hysterics. At the present moment she\nhad a claim to the undivided interest of the family, and she believed\nthat her sister's illness was feigned in order to defraud her of her\nrights. \"My dear, she is ill,\" said Mrs. French. \"Then let her have\na dose of salts,\" said the stern Camilla. This was on the Sunday\nafternoon. Camilla had endeavoured to see Mr. Gibson as he came out\nof the cathedral, but had failed. Mr. Gibson had been detained within\nthe building,--no doubt by duties connected with the choral services.\nOn that evening he got a note from Camilla, and quite early on the\nMonday morning he came up to Heavitree.\n\n\"You will find her in the drawing-room,\" said Mrs. French, as she\nopened the hall-door for him. There was a smile on her face as she\nspoke, but it was a forced smile. Mr. Gibson did not smile at all.\n\n\"Is it all right with her?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well;--you had better go to her. You see, Mr. Gibson, young ladies,\nwhen they are going to be married, think that they ought to have\ntheir own way a little, just for the last time, you know.\" He took no\nnotice of the joke, but went with slow steps up to the drawing-room.\nIt would be inquiring too curiously to ask whether Camilla, when\nshe embraced him, discerned that he had fortified his courage that\nmorning with a glass of curacoa.\n\n\"What does all this mean, Thomas?\" was the first question that\nCamilla asked when the embrace was over.\n\n\"All what mean, dear?\"\n\n\"This untoward delay. Thomas, you have almost broken my heart. You\nhave been away, and I have not heard from you.\"\n\n\"I wrote twice, Camilla.\"\n\n\"And what sort of letters? If there is anything the matter, Thomas,\nyou had better tell me at once.\" She paused, but Thomas held his\ntongue. \"I don't suppose you want to kill me.\"\n\n\"God forbid,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"But you will. What must everybody think of me in the city when\nthey find that it is put off? Poor mamma has been dreadful;--quite\ndreadful! And here is Arabella now laid up on a bed of sickness.\"\nThis, too, was indiscreet. Camilla should have said nothing about her\nsister's sickness.\n\n\"I have been so sorry to hear about dear Bella,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"I don't suppose she's very bad,\" said Camilla, \"but of course we all\nfeel it. Of course we're upset. As for me, I bear up; because I've\nthat spirit that I won't give way if it's ever so; but, upon my word,\nit tries me hard. What is the meaning of it, Thomas?\"\n\nBut Thomas had nothing to say beyond what he had said before to Mrs.\nFrench. He was very particular, he said, about money; and certain\nmoney matters made it incumbent on him not to marry before the 29th\nof April. When Camilla suggested to him that as she was to be his\nwife, she ought to know all about his money matters, he told her that\nshe should,--some day. When they were married, he would tell her all.\nCamilla talked a great deal, and said some things that were very\nsevere. Mr. Gibson did not enjoy his morning, but he endured the\nupbraidings of his fair one with more firmness than might perhaps\nhave been expected from him. He left all the talking to Camilla; but\nwhen he got up to leave her, the 29th of April had been fixed, with\nsome sort of assent from her, as the day on which she was really to\nbecome Mrs. Gibson.\n\nWhen he left the room, he again met Mrs. French on the landing-place.\nShe hesitated a moment, waiting to see whether the door would be\nshut; but the door could not be shut, as Camilla was standing in\nthe entrance. \"Mr. Gibson,\" said Mrs. French, in a voice that was\nscarcely a whisper, \"would you mind stepping in and seeing poor Bella\nfor a moment?\"\n\n\"Why;--she is in bed,\" said Camilla.\n\n\"Yes;--she is in bed; but she thinks it would be a comfort to her.\nShe has seen nobody these four days except Mr. Martin, and she thinks\nit would comfort her to have a word or two with Mr. Gibson.\" Now\nMr. Gibson was not only going to be Bella's brother-in-law, but\nhe was also a clergyman. Camilla in her heart believed that the\nhalf-clerical aspect which her mother had given to the request was\nfalse and hypocritical. There were special reasons why Bella should\nnot have wished to see Mr. Gibson in her bedroom, at any rate till\nMr. Gibson had become her brother-in-law. The expression of such a\nwish at the present moment was almost indecent.\n\n\"You'll be there with them?\" said Camilla. Mr. Gibson blushed up to\nhis ears as he heard the suggestion. \"Of course you'll be there with\nthem, mamma.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, I think not. I fancy she wishes him to read to her,--or\nsomething of that sort.\" Then Mr. Gibson, without speaking a word,\nbut still blushing up to his ears, was taken to Arabella's room; and\nCamilla, flouncing into the drawing-room, banged the door behind her.\nShe had hitherto fought her battle with considerable skill and with\ngreat courage;--but her very success had made her imprudent. She\nhad become so imperious in the great position which she had reached,\nthat she could not control her temper or wait till her power was\nconfirmed. The banging of that door was heard through the whole\nhouse, and every one knew why it was banged. She threw herself on to\na sofa, and then, instantly rising again, paced the room with quick\nstep. Could it be possible that there was treachery? Was it on the\ncards that that weak, poor creature, Bella, was intriguing once again\nto defraud her of her husband? There were different things that she\nnow remembered. Arabella, in that moment of bliss in which she had\nconceived herself to be engaged to Mr. Gibson, had discarded her\nchignon. Then she had resumed it,--in all its monstrous proportions.\nSince that it had been lessened by degrees, and brought down, through\nvarious interesting but abnormal shapes, to a size which would hardly\nhave drawn forth any anathema from Miss Stanbury. And now, on this\nvery morning, Arabella had put on a clean nightcap, with muslin\nfrills. It is perhaps not unnatural that a sick lady, preparing\nto receive a clergyman in her bedroom, should put on a clean\nnightcap,--but to suspicious eyes small causes suffice to create\nalarm. And if there were any such hideous wickedness in the wind, had\nArabella any colleague in her villainy? Could it be that the mother\nwas plotting against her daughter's happiness and respectability?\nCamilla was well aware that her mamma would at first have preferred\nto give Arabella to Mr. Gibson, had the choice in the matter been\nleft to her. But now, when the thing had been settled before all\nthe world, would not such treatment on a mother's part be equal to\ninfanticide? And then as to Mr. Gibson himself! Camilla was not\nprone to think little of her own charms, but she had been unable\nnot to perceive that her lover had become negligent in his personal\nattentions to her. An accepted lover, who deserves to have been\naccepted, should devote every hour at his command to his mistress.\nBut Mr. Gibson had of late been so chary of his presence at\nHeavitree, that Camilla could not but have known that he took no\ndelight in coming thither. She had acknowledged this to herself; but\nshe had consoled herself with the reflection that marriage would make\nthis all right. Mr. Gibson was not the man to stray from his wife,\nand she could trust herself to obtain a sufficient hold upon her\nhusband hereafter, partly by the strength of her tongue, partly by\nthe ascendency of her spirit, and partly, also, by the comforts which\nshe would provide for him. She had not doubted but that it would be\nall well when they should be married;--but how if, even now, there\nshould be no marriage for her? Camilla French had never heard of\nCreusa and of Jason, but as she paced her mother's drawing-room that\nmorning she was a Medea in spirit. If any plot of that kind should be\nin the wind, she would do such things that all Devonshire should hear\nof her wrongs and of her revenge!\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Gibson was sitting by Arabella's bedside, while\nMrs. French was trying to make herself busy in her own chamber, next\ndoor. There had been a reading of some chapter of the Bible,--or of\nsome portion of a chapter. And Mr. Gibson, as he read, and Arabella,\nas she listened, had endeavoured to take to their hearts and to make\nuse of the word which they heard. The poor young woman, when she\nbegged her mother to send to her the man who was so dear to her, did\nso with some half-formed condition that it would be good for her to\nhear a clergyman read to her. But now the chapter had been read, and\nthe book was back in Mr. Gibson's pocket, and he was sitting with\nhis hand on the bed. \"She is so very arrogant,\" said Bella,--\"and\nso domineering.\" To this Mr. Gibson made no reply. \"I'm sure I have\nendeavoured to bear it well, though you must have known what I have\nsuffered, Thomas. Nobody can understand it so well as you do.\"\n\n\"I wish I had never been born,\" said Mr. Gibson, tragically.\n\n\"Don't say that, Thomas,--because it's wicked.\"\n\n\"But I do. See all the harm I have done;--and yet I did not mean it.\"\n\n\"You must try and do the best you can now. I am not saying what that\nshould be. I am not dictating to you. You are a man, and, of course,\nyou must judge for yourself. But I will say this. You shouldn't do\nanything just because it is the easiest. I don't suppose I should\nlive after it. I don't indeed. But that should not signify to you.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose that any man was ever before in such a terrible\nposition since the world began.\"\n\n\"It is difficult;--I am sure of that, Thomas.\"\n\n\"And I have meant to be so true. I fancy sometimes that some\nmysterious agency interferes with the affairs of a man, and drives\nhim on,--and on,--and on,--almost,--till he doesn't know where it\ndrives him.\" As he said this in a voice that was quite sepulchral\nin its tone, he felt some consolation in the conviction that this\nmysterious agency could not affect a man without embuing him with\na certain amount of grandeur,--very uncomfortable, indeed, in its\nnature, but still having considerable value as a counterpoise. Pride\nmust bear pain;--but pain is recompensed by pride.\n\n\"She is so strong, Thomas, that she can put up with anything,\" said\nArabella, in a whisper.\n\n\"Strong;--yes,\" said he, with a shudder;--\"she is strong enough.\"\n\n\"And as for love--\"\n\n\"Don't talk about it,\" said he, getting up from his chair. \"Don't\ntalk about it. You will drive me frantic.\"\n\n\"You know what my feelings are, Thomas; you have always known them.\nThere has been no change since I was the young thing you first knew\nme.\" As she spoke, she just touched his hand with hers; but he did\nnot seem to notice this, sitting with his elbow on the arm of his\nchair and his forehead on his hand. In reply to what she said to him,\nhe merely shook his head,--not intending to imply thereby any doubt\nof the truth of her assertion. \"You have now to make up your mind and\nto be bold, Thomas,\" continued Arabella. \"She says that you are a\ncoward; but I know that you are no coward. I told her so, and she\nsaid that I was interfering. Oh,--that she should be able to tell me\nthat I interfere when I defend you!\"\n\n\"I must go,\" said Mr. Gibson, jumping up from his chair. \"I must go.\nBella, I cannot stand this any longer. It is too much for me. I will\npray that I may decide aright. God bless you!\" Then he kissed her\nbrow as she lay in bed, and hurried out of the room.\n\nHe had hoped to go from the house without further converse with any\nof its inmates; for his mind was disturbed, and he longed to be at\nrest. But he was not allowed to escape so easily. Camilla met him at\nthe dining-room door, and accosted him with a smile. There had been\ntime for much meditation during the last half hour, and Camilla had\nmeditated. \"How do you find her, Thomas?\" she asked.\n\n\"She seems weak, but I believe she is better. I have been reading to\nher.\"\n\n\"Come in, Thomas;--will you not? It is bad for us to stand talking on\nthe stairs. Dear Thomas, don't let us be so cold to each other.\" He\nhad no alternative but to put his arm round her waist and kiss her,\nthinking, as he did so, of the mysterious agency which afflicted him.\n\"Tell me that you love me, Thomas,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course I love you.\" The question is not a pleasant one when put\nby a lady to a gentleman whose affections towards her are not strong,\nand it requires a very good actor to produce an efficient answer.\n\n\"I hope you do, Thomas. It would be sad, indeed, if you did not. You\nare not weary of your Camilla,--are you?\"\n\nFor a moment there came upon him an idea that he would confess that\nhe was weary of her, but he found at once that such an effort was\nbeyond his powers. \"How can you ask such a question?\" he said.\n\n\"Because you do not--come to me.\" Camilla, as she spoke, laid her\nhead upon his shoulder, and wept. \"And now you have been five minutes\nwith me and nearly an hour with Bella.\"\n\n\"She wanted me to read to her,\" said Mr. Gibson;--and he hated\nhimself thoroughly as he said it.\n\n\"And now you want to get away as fast as you can,\" continued Camilla.\n\n\"Because of the morning service,\" said Mr. Gibson. This was quite\ntrue, and yet he hated himself again for saying it. As Camilla knew\nthe truth of the last plea, she was obliged to let him go; but she\nmade him swear before he went that he loved her dearly. \"I think it's\nall right,\" she said to herself as he went down the stairs. \"I don't\nthink he'd dare make it wrong. If he does;--o-oh!\"\n\nMr. Gibson, as he walked into Exeter, endeavoured to justify his\nown conduct to himself. There was no moment, he declared to himself,\nin which he had not endeavoured to do right. Seeing the manner in\nwhich he had been placed among these two young women, both of whom\nhad fallen in love with him, how could he have saved himself from\nvacillation? And by what untoward chance had it come to pass that he\nhad now learned to dislike so vigorously, almost to hate, the one\nwith whom he had been for a moment sufficiently infatuated to think\nthat he loved?\n\nBut with all his arguments he did not succeed in justifying to\nhimself his own conduct, and he hated himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\nOF A QUARTER OF LAMB.\n\n\nMiss Stanbury, looking out of her parlour window, saw Mr. Gibson\nhurrying towards the cathedral, down the passage which leads from\nSouthernhay into the Close. \"He's just come from Heavitree, I'll be\nbound,\" said Miss Stanbury to Martha, who was behind her.\n\n\"Like enough, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Though they do say that the poor fool of a man has become quite sick\nof his bargain already.\"\n\n\"He'll have to be sicker yet, ma'am,\" said Martha.\n\n\"They were to have been married last week, and nobody ever knew why\nit was put off. It's my belief he'll never marry her. And she'll be\nserved right;--quite right.\"\n\n\"He must marry her now, ma'am. She's been buying things all over\nExeter, as though there was no end of their money.\"\n\n\"They haven't more than enough to keep body and soul together,\" said\nMiss Stanbury. \"I don't see why I mightn't have gone to service this\nmorning, Martha. It's quite warm now out in the Close.\"\n\n\"You'd better wait, ma'am, till the east winds is over. She was at\nPuddock's only the day before yesterday, buying bed-linen,--the\nfinest they had, and that wasn't good enough.\"\n\n\"Psha!\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"As though Mr. Gibson hadn't things of that kind good enough for\nher,\" said Martha.\n\nThen there was silence in the room for awhile. Miss Stanbury was\nstanding at one window, and Martha at the other, watching the people\nas they passed backwards and forwards, in and out of the Close.\nDorothy had now been away at Nuncombe Putney for some weeks, and her\naunt felt her loneliness with a heavy sense of weakness. Never had\nshe entertained a companion in the house who had suited her as well\nas her niece, Dorothy. Dorothy would always listen to her, would\nalways talk to her, would always bear with her. Since Dorothy had\ngone, various letters had been interchanged between them. Though\nthere had been anger about Brooke Burgess, there had been no absolute\nrupture; but Miss Stanbury had felt that she could not write and beg\nher niece to come back to her. She had not sent Dorothy away. Dorothy\nhad chosen to go, because her aunt had had an opinion of her own as\nto what was fitting for her heir; and as Miss Stanbury would not give\nup her opinion, she could not ask her niece to return to her. Such\nhad been her resolution, sternly expressed to herself a dozen times\nduring these solitary weeks; but time and solitude had acted upon\nher, and she longed for the girl's presence in the house. \"Martha,\"\nshe said at last, \"I think I shall get you to go over to Nuncombe\nPutney.\"\n\n\"Again, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Why not again? It's not so far, I suppose, that the journey will\nhurt you.\"\n\n\"I don't think it'd hurt me, ma'am;--only what good will I do?\"\n\n\"If you'll go rightly to work, you may do good. Miss Dorothy was a\nfool to go the way she did;--a great fool.\"\n\n\"She stayed longer than I thought she would, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking you what you thought. I'll tell you what. Do you send\nGiles to Winslow's, and tell them to send in early to-morrow a nice\nfore-quarter of lamb. Or it wouldn't hurt you if you went and chose\nit yourself.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't hurt me at all, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You get it nice;--not too small, because meat is meat at the price\nthings are now; and how they ever see butcher's meat at all is more\nthan I can understand.\"\n\n\"People as has to be careful, ma'am, makes a little go a long way.\"\n\n\"You get it a good size, and take it over in a basket. It won't hurt\nyou, done up clean in a napkin.\"\n\n\"It won't hurt me at all, ma'am.\"\n\n\"And you give it to Miss Dorothy with my love. Don't you let 'em\nthink I sent it to my sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"And is that to be all, ma'am?\"\n\n\"How do you mean all?\"\n\n\"Because, ma'am, the railway and the carrier would take it quite\nready, and there would be a matter of ten or twelve shillings saved\nin the journey.\"\n\n\"Whose affair is that?\"\n\n\"Not mine, ma'am, of course.\"\n\n\"I believe you are afraid of the trouble, Martha. Or else you don't\nlike going because they're poor.\"\n\n\"It ain't fair, ma'am, of you to say so;--that it ain't. All I ask\nis,--is that to be all? When I've giv'em the lamb, am I just to come\naway straight, or am I to say anything? It will look so odd if I'm\njust to put down the basket and come away without e'er a word.\"\n\n\"Martha!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You're a fool.\"\n\n\"That's true, too, ma'am.\"\n\n\"It would be like you to go about in that dummy way,--wouldn't\nit;--and you that was so fond of Miss Dorothy.\"\n\n\"I was fond of her, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Of course you'll be talking to her;--and why not? And if she should\nsay anything about returning--\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You can say that you know her old aunt wouldn't,--wouldn't refuse\nto have her back again. You can put it your own way, you know. You\nneedn't make me find words for you.\"\n\n\"But she won't, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Won't what?\"\n\n\"Won't say anything about returning.\"\n\n\"Yes, she will, Martha, if you talk to her rightly.\" The servant\ndidn't reply for awhile, but stood looking out of the window. \"You\nmight as well go about the lamb at once, Martha.\"\n\n\"So I will, ma'am, when I've got it out, all clear.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Why,--just this, ma'am. May I tell Miss Dolly straight out that you\nwant her to come back, and that I've been sent to say so?\"\n\n\"No, Martha.\"\n\n\"Then how am I to do it, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Do it out of your own head, just as it comes up at the moment.\"\n\n\"Out of my own head, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes;--just as you feel, you know.\"\n\n\"Just as I feel, ma'am?\"\n\n\"You understand what I mean, Martha.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, ma'am, and I can't say no more. And if you scolds\nme afterwards, ma'am,--why, of course, I must put up with it.\"\n\n\"But I won't scold you, Martha.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go out to Winslow's about the lamb at once, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Very nice, and not too small, Martha.\"\n\nMartha went out and ordered the lamb, and packed it as desired quite\nclean in a napkin, and fitted it into the basket, and arranged with\nGiles Hickbody to carry it down for her early in the morning to the\nstation, so that she might take the first train to Lessborough. It\nwas understood that she was to hire a fly at Lessborough to take her\nto Nuncombe Putney. Now that she understood the importance of her\nmission and was aware that the present she took with her was only\nthe customary accompaniment of an ambassadress entrusted with a\ngreat mission, Martha said nothing even about the expense. The train\nstarted for Lessborough at seven, and as she was descending from her\nroom at six, Miss Stanbury, in her flannel dressing-gown, stepped\nout of the door of her own room. \"Just put this in the basket,\" said\nshe, handing a note to her servant. \"I thought last night I'd write a\nword. Just put it in the basket and say nothing about it.\" The note\nwhich she sent was as follows:--\n\n\n   The Close, 8th April, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR DOROTHY,--\n\n   As Martha talks of going over to pay you a visit, I've\n   thought that I'd just get her to take you a quarter of\n   lamb, which is coming in now very nice. I do envy her\n   going to see you, my dear, for I had gotten somehow to\n   love to see your pretty face. I'm getting almost strong\n   again; but Sir Peter, who was here this afternoon, just\n   calling as a friend, was uncivil enough to say that I'm\n   too much of an old woman to go out in the east wind. I\n   told him it didn't much matter;--for the sooner old women\n   made way for young ones, the better.\n\n   I am very desolate and solitary here. But I rather think\n   that women who don't get married are intended to be\n   desolate; and perhaps it is better for them, if they\n   bestow their time and thoughts properly,--as I hope you\n   do, my dear. A woman with a family of children has almost\n   too many of the cares of this world, to give her mind as\n   she ought to the other. What shall we say then of those\n   who have no such cares, and yet do not walk uprightly?\n   Dear Dorothy, be not such a one. For myself, I acknowledge\n   bitterly the extent of my shortcomings. Much has been\n   given to me; but if much be expected, how shall I answer\n   the demand?\n\n   I hope I need not tell you that whenever it may suit you\n   to pay a visit to Exeter, your room will be ready for you,\n   and there will be a warm welcome. Mrs. MacHugh always asks\n   after you; and so has Mrs. Clifford. I won't tell you\n   what Mrs. Clifford said about your colour, because it\n   would make you vain. The Heavitree affair has all been put\n   off;--of course you have heard that. Dear, dear, dear! You\n   know what I think, so I need not repeat it.\n\n   Give my respects to your mamma and Priscilla,--and for\n   yourself, accept the affectionate love of\n\n   Your loving old aunt,\n\n   JEMIMA STANBURY.\n\n   P.S.--If Martha should say anything to you, you may feel\n   sure that she knows my mind.\n\n\nPoor old soul. She felt an almost uncontrollable longing to have her\nniece back again, and yet she told herself that she was bound not\nto send a regular invitation, or to suggest an unconditional return.\nDorothy had herself decided to take her departure, and if she chose\nto remain away,--so it must be. She, Miss Stanbury, could not demean\nherself by renewing her invitation. She read her letter before she\nadded to it the postscript, and felt that it was too solemn in its\ntone to suggest to Dorothy that which she wished to suggest. She had\nbeen thinking much of her own past life when she wrote those words\nabout the state of an unmarried woman, and was vacillating between\ntwo minds,--whether it were better for a young woman to look forward\nto the cares and affections, and perhaps hard usage, of a married\nlife; or to devote herself to the easier and safer course of an\nold maid's career. But an old maid is nothing if she be not kind\nand good. She acknowledged that, and, acknowledging it, added the\npostscript to her letter. What though there was a certain blow\nto her pride in the writing of it! She did tell herself that in\nthus referring her niece to Martha for an expression of her own\nmind,--after that conversation which she and Martha had had in the\nparlour,--she was in truth eating her own words. But the postscript\nwas written, and though she took the letter up with her to her own\nroom in order that she might alter the words if she repented of them\nin the night, the letter was sent as it was written,--postscript and\nall.\n\nShe spent the next day with very sober thoughts. When Mrs. MacHugh\ncalled upon her and told her that there were rumours afloat in\nExeter that the marriage between Camilla French and Mr. Gibson would\ncertainly be broken off, in spite of all purchases that had been\nmade, she merely remarked that they were two poor, feckless things,\nwho didn't know their own minds. \"Camilla knows hers plain enough,\"\nsaid Mrs. MacHugh sharply; but even this did not give Miss Stanbury\nany spirit. She waited, and waited patiently, till Martha should\nreturn, thinking of the sweet pink colour which used to come and\ngo in Dorothy's cheeks,--which she had been wont to observe so\nfrequently, not knowing that she had observed it and loved it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nRIVER'S COTTAGE.\n\n\nThree days after Hugh Stanbury's visit to Manchester Street, he wrote\na note to Lady Rowley, telling her of the address at which might be\nfound both Trevelyan and his son. As Bozzle had acknowledged, facts\nare things which may be found out. Hugh had gone to work somewhat\nafter the Bozzlian fashion, and had found out this fact. \"He lives at\na place called River's Cottage, at Willesden,\" wrote Stanbury. \"If\nyou turn off the Harrow Road to the right, about a mile beyond the\ncemetery, you will find the cottage on the left hand side of the lane\nabout a quarter of a mile from the Harrow Road. I believe you can go\nto Willesden by railway, but you had better take a cab from London.\"\nThere was much consultation respecting this letter between Lady\nRowley and Mrs. Trevelyan, and it was decided that it should not\nbe shown to Sir Marmaduke. To see her child was at the present\nmoment the most urgent necessity of the poor mother, and both the\nladies felt that Sir Marmaduke in his wrath might probably impede\nrather than assist her in this desire. If told where he might find\nTrevelyan, he would probably insist on starting in quest of his\nson-in-law himself, and the distance between the mother and her child\nmight become greater in consequence, instead of less. There were many\nconsultations; and the upshot of these was, that Lady Rowley and her\ndaughter determined to start for Willesden without saying anything to\nSir Marmaduke of the purpose they had in hand. When Emily expressed\nher conviction that if Trevelyan should be away from home they would\nprobably be able to make their way into the house,--so as to see the\nchild, Lady Rowley with some hesitation acknowledged that such might\nbe the case. But the child's mother said nothing to her own mother of\na scheme which she had half formed of so clinging to her boy that no\nhuman power should separate them.\n\nThey started in a cab, as advised by Stanbury, and were driven to a\npoint on the road from which a lane led down to Willesden, passing by\nRiver's Cottage. They asked as they came along, and met no difficulty\nin finding their way. At the point on the road indicated, there was\na country inn for hay-waggoners, and here Lady Rowley proposed that\nthey should leave their cab, urging that it might be best to call at\nthe cottage in the quietest manner possible; but Mrs. Trevelyan, with\nher scheme in her head for the recapture of their child, begged that\nthe cab might go on;--and thus they were driven up to the door.\n\nRiver's Cottage was not a prepossessing abode. It was a new building,\nof light-coloured bricks, with a door in the middle and one window\non each side. Over the door was a stone tablet, bearing the\nname,--River's Cottage. There was a little garden between the\nroad and the house, across which there was a straight path to the\ndoor. In front of one window was a small shrub, generally called\na puzzle-monkey, and in front of the other was a variegated laurel.\nThere were two small morsels of green turf, and a distant view round\nthe corner of the house of a row of cabbage stumps. If Trevelyan were\nliving there, he had certainly come down in the world since the days\nin which he had occupied the house in Curzon Street. The two ladies\ngot out of the cab, and slowly walked across the little garden. Mrs.\nTrevelyan was dressed in black, and she wore a thick veil. She had\naltogether been unable to make up her mind as to what should be her\nconduct to her husband should she see him. That must be governed by\ncircumstances as they might occur. Her visit was made not to him, but\nto her boy.\n\nThe door was opened before they knocked, and Trevelyan himself was\nstanding in the narrow passage. Lady Rowley was the first to speak.\n\"Louis,\" she said, \"I have brought your wife to see you.\"\n\n\"Who told you that I was here?\" he asked, still standing in the\npassage.\n\n\"Of course a mother would find out where was her child,\" said Lady\nRowley.\n\n\"You should not have come here without notice,\" he said. \"I was\ncareful to let you know the conditions on which you should come.\"\n\n\"You do not mean that I shall not see my child,\" said the mother.\n\"Oh, Louis, you will let me see him.\"\n\nTrevelyan hesitated a moment, still keeping his position firmly in\nthe doorway. By this time an old woman, decently dressed and of\ncomfortable appearance, had taken her place behind him, and behind\nher was a slip of a girl about fifteen years of age. This was the\nowner of River's Cottage and her daughter, and all the inhabitants\nof the cottage were now there, standing in the passage. \"I ought not\nto let you see him,\" said Trevelyan; \"you have intruded upon me in\ncoming here! I had not wished to see you here,--till you had complied\nwith the order I had given you.\" What a meeting between a husband and\na wife who had not seen each other now for many months,--between a\nhusband and a wife who were still young enough not to have outlived\nthe first impulses of their early love! He still stood there guarding\nthe way, and had not even put out his hand to greet her. He was\nguarding the way lest she should, without his permission, obtain\naccess to her own child! She had not removed her veil, and now she\nhardly dared to step over the threshold of her husband's house. At\nthis moment, she perceived that the woman behind was pointing to\nthe room on the left, as the cottage was entered, and Emily at once\nunderstood that her boy was there. Then at that moment she heard her\nson's voice, as, in his solitude, the child began to cry. \"I must go\nin,\" she said; \"I will go in;\" and rushing on she tried to push aside\nher husband. Her mother aided her, nor did Trevelyan attempt to stop\nher with violence, and in a moment she was kneeling at the foot of a\nsmall sofa, with her child in her arms. \"I had not intended to hinder\nyou,\" said Trevelyan, \"but I require from you a promise that you will\nnot attempt to remove him.\"\n\n\"Why should she not take him home with her?\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Because I will not have it so,\" replied Trevelyan. \"Because I choose\nthat it should be understood that I am to be the master of my own\naffairs.\"\n\nMrs. Trevelyan had now thrown aside her bonnet and her veil, and was\ncovering her child with caresses. The poor little fellow, whose mind\nhad been utterly dismayed by the events which had occurred to him\nsince his capture, though he returned her kisses, did so in fear\nand trembling. And he was still sobbing, rubbing his eyes with his\nknuckles, and by no means yielding himself with his whole heart to\nhis mother's tenderness,--as she would have had him do. \"Louey,\"\nshe said, whispering to him, \"you know mamma; you haven't forgotten\nmamma?\" He half murmured some little infantine word through his sobs,\nand then put his cheek up to be pressed against his mother's face.\n\"Louey will never, never forget his own mamma; will he, Louey?\" The\npoor boy had no assurances to give, and could only raise his cheek\nagain to be kissed. In the meantime Lady Rowley and Trevelyan were\nstanding by, not speaking to each other, regarding the scene in\nsilence.\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"You haven't forgotten Mamma?\"]\n\n\nShe,--Lady Rowley,--could see that he was frightfully altered in\nappearance, even since the day on which she had so lately met him\nin the City. His cheeks were thin and haggard, and his eyes were\ndeep and very bright,--and he moved them quickly from side to side,\nas though ever suspecting something. He seemed to be smaller in\nstature,--withered, as it were, as though he had melted away. And\nthough he stood looking upon his wife and child, he was not for a\nmoment still. He would change the posture of his hands and arms,\nmoving them quickly with little surreptitious jerks, and would\nshuffle his feet upon the floor, almost without altering his\nposition. His clothes hung about him, and his linen was soiled and\nworn. Lady Rowley noticed this especially, as he had been a man\npeculiarly given to neatness of apparel. He was the first to speak.\n\"You have come down here in a cab?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,--in a cab, from London,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Of course you will go back in it? You cannot stay here. There is no\naccommodation. It is a wretched place, but it suits the boy. As for\nme, all places are now alike.\"\n\n\"Louis,\" said his wife, springing up from her knees, coming to him,\nand taking his right hand between both her own, \"you will let me take\nhim with me. I know you will let me take him with me.\"\n\n\"I cannot do that, Emily; it would be wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong to restore a child to his mother? Oh, Louis, think of it. What\nmust my life be without him,--or you?\"\n\n\"Don't talk of me. It is too late for that.\"\n\n\"Not if you will be reasonable, Louis, and listen to me. Oh, heavens,\nhow ill you are!\" As she said this she drew nearer to him, so that\nher face was almost close to his. \"Louis, come back; come back, and\nlet it all be forgotten. It shall be a dream, a horrid dream, and\nnobody shall speak of it.\" He left his hand within hers and stood\nlooking into her face. He was well aware that his life since he had\nleft her had been one long hour of misery. There had been to him no\nalleviation, no comfort, no consolation. He had not a friend left to\nhim. Even his satellite, the policeman, was becoming weary of him and\nmanifestly suspicious. The woman with whom he was now lodging, and\nwhose resources were infinitely benefited by his payments to her, had\nalready thrown out hints that she was afraid of him. And as he looked\nat his wife, he knew that he loved her. Everything for him now was\nhot and dry and poor and bitter. How sweet would it be again to sit\nwith her soft hand in his, to feel her cool brow against his own, to\nhave the comfort of her care, and to hear the music of loving words!\nThe companionship of his wife had once been to him everything in the\nworld; but now, for many months past, he had known no companion. She\nbade him come to her, and look upon all this trouble as a dream not\nto be mentioned. Could it be possible that it should be so, and that\nthey might yet be happy together,--perhaps in some distant country,\nwhere the story of all their misery might not be known? He felt all\nthis truly and with a keen accuracy. If he were mad, he was not all\nmad. \"I will tell you of nothing that is past,\" said she, hanging to\nhim, and coming still nearer to him, and embracing his arm.\n\nCould she have condescended to ask him not to tell her of the\npast;--had it occurred to her so to word her request,--she might\nperhaps have prevailed. But who can say how long the tenderness of\nhis heart would have saved him from further outbreak;--and whether\nsuch prevailing on her part would have been of permanent service? As\nit was, her words wounded him in that spot of his inner self which\nwas most sensitive,--on that spot from whence had come all his fury.\nA black cloud came upon his brow, and he made an effort to withdraw\nhimself from her grasp. It was necessary to him that she should in\nsome fashion own that he had been right, and now she was promising\nhim that she would not tell him of his fault! He could not thus\nswallow down all the convictions by which he had fortified himself to\nbear the misfortunes which he had endured. Had he not quarrelled with\nevery friend he possessed on this score; and should he now stultify\nhimself in all those quarrels by admitting that he had been cruel,\nunjust, and needlessly jealous? And did not truth demand of him that\nhe should cling to his old assurances? Had she not been disobedient,\nill-conditioned, and rebellious? Had she not received the man, both\nhim personally and his letters, after he had explained to her that\nhis honour demanded that it should not be so? How could he come into\nsuch terms as those now proposed to him, simply because he longed\nto enjoy the rich sweetness of her soft hand, to feel the fragrance\nof her breath, and to quench the heat of his forehead in the cool\natmosphere of her beauty? \"Why have you driven me to this by your\nintercourse with that man?\" he said. \"Why, why, why did you do it?\"\n\nShe was still clinging to him. \"Louis,\" she said, \"I am your wife.\"\n\n\"Yes; you are my wife.\"\n\n\"And will you still believe such evil of me without any cause?\"\n\n\"There has been cause,--horrible cause. You must\nrepent,--repent,--repent.\"\n\n\"Heaven help me,\" said the woman, falling back from him, and\nreturning to the boy who was now seated in Lady Rowley's lap. \"Mamma,\ndo you speak to him. What can I say? Would he think better of me were\nI to own myself to have been guilty, when there has been no guilt, no\nslightest fault? Does he wish me to purchase my child by saying that\nI am not fit to be his mother?\"\n\n\"Louis,\" said Lady Rowley, \"if any man was ever wrong, mad, madly\nmistaken, you are so now.\"\n\n\"Have you come out here to accuse me again, as you did before in\nLondon?\" he asked. \"Is that the way in which you and she intend to\nlet the past be, as she says, like a dream? She tells me that I am\nill. It is true. I am ill,--and she is killing me, killing me, by her\nobstinacy.\"\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" said the wife, again rising from her\nchild.\n\n\"Acknowledge your transgressions, and say that you will amend your\nconduct for the future.\"\n\n\"Mamma, mamma,--what shall I say to him?\"\n\n\"Who can speak to a man that is beside himself?\" replied Lady Rowley.\n\n\"I am not so beside myself as yet, Lady Rowley, but that I know how\nto guard my own honour and to protect my own child. I have told you,\nEmily, the terms on which you can come back to me. You had better now\nreturn to your mother's house; and if you wish again to have a house\nof your own, and your husband, and your boy, you know by what means\nyou may acquire them. For another week I shall remain here;--after\nthat I shall remove far from hence.\"\n\n\"And where will you go, Louis?\"\n\n\"As yet I know not. To Italy I think,--or perhaps to America. It\nmatters little where for me.\"\n\n\"And will Louey be taken with you?\"\n\n\"Certainly he will go with me. To strive to bring him up so that he\nmay be a happier man than his father is all that there is now left\nfor me in life.\" Mrs. Trevelyan had now got the boy in her arms, and\nher mother was seated by her on the sofa. Trevelyan was standing away\nfrom them, but so near the door that no sudden motion on their part\nwould enable them to escape with the boy without his interposition.\nIt now again occurred to the mother to carry off her prize in\nopposition to her husband;--but she had no scheme to that effect laid\nwith her mother, and she could not reconcile herself to the idea of\na contest with him in which personal violence would be necessary.\nThe woman of the house had, indeed, seemed to sympathise with her,\nbut she could not dare in such a matter to trust to assistance from a\nstranger. \"I do not wish to be uncourteous,\" said Trevelyan, \"but if\nyou have no assurance to give me, you had better--leave me.\"\n\nThen there came to be a bargaining about time, and the poor woman\nbegged almost on her knees that she might be allowed to take her\nchild up-stairs and be with him alone for a few minutes. It seemed\nto her that she had not seen her boy till she had had him to herself,\nin absolute privacy, till she had kissed his limbs, and had her hand\nupon his smooth back, and seen that he was white and clean and bright\nas he had ever been. And the bargain was made. She was asked to\npledge her word that she would not take him out of the house,--and\nshe pledged her word, feeling that there was no strength in her for\nthat action which she had meditated. He, knowing that he might still\nguard the passage at the bottom of the stairs, allowed her to go with\nthe boy to his bedroom, while he remained below with Lady Rowley. A\nquarter of an hour was allowed to her, and she humbly promised that\nshe would return when that time was expired.\n\nTrevelyan held the door open for her as she went, and kept it open\nduring her absence. There was hardly a word said between him and Lady\nRowley, but he paced from the passage into the room and from the room\ninto the passage with his hands behind his back. \"It is cruel,\" he\nsaid once. \"It is very cruel.\"\n\n\"It is you that are cruel,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Of course;--of course. That is natural from you. I expect that from\nyou.\" To this she made no answer, and he did not open his lips again.\n\nAfter a while Mrs. Trevelyan called to her mother, and Lady Rowley\nwas allowed to go up-stairs. The quarter of an hour was of course\ngreatly stretched, and all the time Trevelyan continued to pace in\nand out of the room. He was patient, for he did not summon them; but\nwent on pacing backwards and forwards, looking now and again to see\nthat the cab was at its place,--that no deceit was being attempted,\nno second act of kidnapping being perpetrated. At last the two ladies\ncame down the stairs, and the boy was with them,--and the woman of\nthe house.\n\n\"Louis,\" said the wife, going quickly up to her husband, \"I will do\nanything, if you will give me my child.\"\n\n\"What will you do?\"\n\n\"Anything;--say what you want. He is all the world to me, and I\ncannot live if he be taken from me.\"\n\n\"Acknowledge that you have been wrong.\"\n\n\"But how;--in what words;--how am I to speak it?\"\n\n\"Say that you have sinned;--and that you will sin no more.\"\n\n\"Sinned, Louis;--as the woman did,--in the Scripture? Would you have\nme say that?\"\n\n\"He cannot think that it is so,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\nBut Trevelyan had not understood her. \"Lady Rowley, I should have\nfancied that my thoughts at any rate were my own. But this is useless\nnow. The child cannot go with you to-day, nor can you remain here. Go\nhome and think of what I have said. If then you will do as I would\nhave you, you shall return.\"\n\nWith many embraces, with promises of motherly love, and with prayers\nfor love in return, the poor woman did at last leave the house, and\nreturn to the cab. As she went there was a doubt on her own mind\nwhether she should ask to kiss her husband; but he made no sign, and\nshe at last passed out without any mark of tenderness. He stood by\nthe cab as they entered it, and closed the door upon them, and then\nwent slowly back to his room. \"My poor bairn,\" he said to the boy;\n\"my poor bairn.\"\n\n\"Why for mamma go?\" sobbed the child.\n\n\"Mamma goes--; oh, heaven and earth, why should she go? She goes\nbecause her spirit is obstinate, and she will not bend. She is\nstiff-necked, and will not submit herself. But Louey must love mamma\nalways;--and mamma some day will come back to him, and be good to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Mamma is good,--always,\" said the child. Trevelyan had intended on\nthis very afternoon to have gone up to town,--to transact business\nwith Bozzle; for he still believed, though the aspect of the man was\nbitter to him as wormwood, that Bozzle was necessary to him in all\nhis business. And he still made appointments with the man, sometimes\nat Stony Walk, in the Borough, and sometimes at the tavern in\nPoulter's Court, even though Bozzle not unfrequently neglected to\nattend the summons of his employer. And he would go to his banker's\nand draw out money, and then walk about the crowded lanes of the\nCity, and afterwards return to his desolate lodgings at Willesden,\nthinking that he had been transacting business,--and that this\nbusiness was exacted from him by the unfortunate position of his\naffairs. But now he gave up his journey. His retreat had been\ndiscovered; and there came upon him at once a fear that if he left\nthe house his child would be taken. His landlady told him on this\nvery day that the boy ought to be sent to his mother, and had made\nhim understand that it would not suit her to find a home any longer\nfor one who was so singular in his proceedings. He believed that his\nchild would be given up at once, if he were not there to guard it.\nHe stayed at home, therefore, turning in his mind many schemes. He\nhad told his wife that he should go either to Italy or to America at\nonce; but in doing so he had had no formed plan in his head. He had\nsimply imagined at the moment that such a threat would bring her to\nsubmission. But now it became a question whether he would do better\nthan go to America. He suggested to himself that he should go to\nCanada, and fix himself with his boy on some remote farm,--far away\nfrom any city; and would then invite his wife to join him if she\nwould. She was too obstinate, as he told himself, ever to yield,\nunless she should be absolutely softened and brought down to the\nground by the loss of her child. What would do this so effectually\nas the interposition of the broad ocean between him and her? He sat\nthinking of this for the rest of the day, and Louey was left to the\ncharge of the mistress of River's Cottage.\n\n\"Do you think he believes it, mamma?\" Mrs. Trevelyan said to her\nmother when they had already made nearly half their journey home in\nthe cab. There had been nothing spoken hitherto between them, except\nsome half-formed words of affection intended for consolation to the\nyoung mother in her great affliction.\n\n\"He does not know what he believes, dearest.\"\n\n\"You heard what he said. I was to own that I had--sinned.\"\n\n\"Sinned;--yes; because you will not obey him like a slave. That is\nsin--to him.\"\n\n\"But I asked him, mamma. Did you not hear me? I could not say\nthe word plainer,--but I asked him whether he meant that sin.\nHe must have known, and he would not answer me. And he spoke of\nmy--transgression. Mamma, if he believed that, he would not let me\ncome back at all.\"\n\n\"He did not believe it, Emily.\"\n\n\"Could he possibly then so accuse me,--the mother of his child! If\nhis heart be utterly hard and false towards me, if it is possible\nthat he should be cruel to me with such cruelty as that,--still he\nmust love his boy. Why did he not answer me, and say that he did not\nthink it?\"\n\n\"Simply because his reason has left him.\"\n\n\"But if he be mad, mamma, ought we to leave him like that? And, then,\ndid you see his eyes, and his face, and his hands? Did you observe\nhow thin he is,--and his back, how bent? And his clothes,--how they\nwere torn and soiled. It cannot be right that he should be left like\nthat.\"\n\n\"We will tell papa when we get home,\" said Lady Rowley, who was\nherself beginning to be somewhat frightened by what she had seen.\nIt is all very well to declare that a friend is mad when one simply\ndesires to justify one's self in opposition to that friend;--but\nthe matter becomes much more serious when evidence of the friend's\ninsanity becomes true and circumstantial. \"I certainly think that a\nphysician should see him,\" continued Lady Rowley. On their return\nhome Sir Marmaduke was told of what had occurred, and there was a\nlong family discussion in which it was decided that Lady Milborough\nshould be consulted, as being the oldest friend of Louis Trevelyan\nhimself with whom they were acquainted. Trevelyan had relatives of\nhis own name living in Cornwall; but Mrs. Trevelyan herself had never\neven met one of that branch of the family.\n\nSir Marmaduke, however, resolved that he himself would go out and\nsee his son-in-law. He too had called Trevelyan mad, but he did not\nbelieve that the madness was of such a nature as to interfere with\nhis own duties in punishing the man who had ill used his daughter. He\nwould at any rate see Trevelyan himself;--but of this he said nothing\neither to his wife or to his child.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nMAJOR MAGRUDER'S COMMITTEE.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nSir Marmaduke could not go out to Willesden on the morning after Lady\nRowley's return from River's Cottage, because on that day he was\nsummoned to attend at twelve o'clock before a Committee of the House\nof Commons, to give his evidence and the fruit of his experience as\nto the government of British colonies generally; and as he went down\nto the House in a cab from Manchester Street he thoroughly wished\nthat his friend Colonel Osborne had not been so efficacious in\nbringing him home. The task before him was one which he thoroughly\ndisliked, and of which he was afraid. He dreaded the inquisitors\nbefore whom he was to appear, and felt that though he was called\nthere to speak as a master of his art of governing, he would in truth\nbe examined as a servant,--and probably as a servant who did not\nknow his business. Had his sojourn at home been in other respects\nhappy, he might have been able to balance the advantage against the\ninquiry;--but there was no such balancing for him now. And, moreover,\nthe expense of his own house in Manchester Street was so large that\nthis journey, in a pecuniary point of view, would be of but little\nservice to him. So he went down to the House in an unhappy mood; and\nwhen he shook hands in one of the passages with his friend Osborne\nwho was on the Committee, there was very little cordiality in his\nmanner. \"This is the most ungrateful thing I ever knew,\" said the\nColonel to himself; \"I have almost disgraced myself by having this\nfellow brought home; and now he quarrels with me because that idiot,\nhis son-in-law, has quarrelled with his wife.\" And Colonel Osborne\nreally did feel that he was a martyr to the ingratitude of his\nfriend.\n\nThe Committee had been convoked by the House in compliance with the\neager desires of a certain ancient pundit of the constitution, who\nhad been for many years a member, and who had been known as a stern\ncritic of our colonial modes of government. To him it certainly\nseemed that everything that was, was bad,--as regarded our national\ndependencies. But this is so usually the state of mind of all\nparliamentary critics, it is so much a matter of course that the\nmembers who take up the army or the navy, guns, India, our relations\nwith Spain, or workhouse management, should find everything to\nbe bad, rotten, and dishonest, that the wrath of the member for\nKillicrankie against colonial peculation and idleness, was not\nthought much of in the open House. He had been at the work for years,\nand the Colonial Office were so used to it that they rather liked\nhim. He had made himself free of the office, and the clerks were\nalways glad to see him. It was understood that he said bitter things\nin the House,--that was Major Magruder's line of business; but he\ncould be quite pleasant when he was asking questions of a private\nsecretary, or telling the news of the day to a senior clerk. As he\nwas now between seventy and eighty, and had been at the work for at\nleast twenty years, most of those concerned had allowed themselves\nto think that he would ride his hobby harmlessly to the day of his\nparliamentary death. But the drop from a house corner will hollow\na stone by its constancy, and Major Magruder at last persuaded the\nHouse to grant him a Committee of Inquiry. Then there came to be\nserious faces at the Colonial Office, and all the little pleasantries\nof a friendly opposition were at an end. It was felt that the battle\nmust now become a real fight, and Secretary and Under-Secretary\ngirded up their loins.\n\nMajor Magruder was chairman of his own committee, and being a man\nof a laborious turn of mind, much given to blue-books, very patient,\nthoroughly conversant with the House, and imbued with a strong belief\nin the efficacy of parliamentary questionings to carry a point, if\nnot to elicit a fact, had a happy time of it during this session.\nHe was a man who always attended the House from 4 p.m. to the time\nof its breaking up, and who never missed a division. The slight\nadditional task of sitting four hours in a committee-room three days\na week, was only a delight the more,--especially as during those four\nhours he could occupy the post of chairman. Those who knew Major\nMagruder well did not doubt but that the Committee would sit for many\nweeks, and that the whole theory of colonial government, or rather of\nimperial control supervising such government, would be tested to the\nvery utmost. Men who had heard the old Major maunder on for years\npast on his pet subject, hardly knew how much vitality would be found\nin him when his maundering had succeeded in giving him a committee.\n\nA Governor from one of the greater colonies had already been under\nquestion for nearly a week, and was generally thought to have come\nout of the fire unscathed by the flames of the Major's criticism.\nThis Governor had been a picked man, and he had made it appear that\nthe control of Downing Street was never more harsh and seldom less\nrefreshing and beautifying than a spring shower in April. No other\nlands under the sun were so blest, in the way of government, as were\nthe colonies with which he had been acquainted; and, as a natural\nconsequence, their devotion and loyalty to the mother country were\nquite a passion with them. Now the Major had been long of a mind that\none or two colonies had better simply be given up to other nations,\nwhich were more fully able to look after them than was England, and\nthat three or four more should be allowed to go clear,--costing\nEngland nothing, and owing England nothing. But the well-chosen\nGovernor who had now been before the Committee, had rather staggered\nthe Major,--and things altogether were supposed to be looking up for\nthe Colonial Office.\n\nAnd now had come the day of Sir Marmaduke's martyrdom. He was first\nrequested, with most urbane politeness, to explain the exact nature\nof the government which he exercised in the Mandarins. Now it\ncertainly was the case that the manner in which the legislative and\nexecutive authorities were intermingled in the affairs of these\nislands, did create a complication which it was difficult for any man\nto understand, and very difficult indeed for any man to explain to\nothers. There was a Court of Chancery, so called, which Sir Marmaduke\ndescribed as a little parliament. When he was asked whether the court\nexercised legislative or executive functions, he said at first that\nit exercised both, and then that it exercised neither. He knew that\nit consisted of nine men, of whom five were appointed by the colony\nand four by the Crown. Yet he declared that the Crown had the control\nof the court;--which, in fact, was true enough no doubt, as the five\nopen members were not perhaps, all of them, immaculate patriots; but\non this matter poor Sir Marmaduke was very obscure. When asked who\nexercised the patronage of the Crown in nominating the four members,\nhe declared that the four members exercised it themselves. Did he\nappoint them? No; he never appointed anybody himself. He consulted\nthe Court of Chancery for everything. At last it came out that the\nchief justice of the islands, and three other officers, always sat in\nthe court;--but whether it was required by the constitution of the\nislands that this should be so, Sir Marmaduke did not know. It had\nworked well; that was to say, everybody had complained of it, but\nhe, Sir Marmaduke, would not recommend any change. What he thought\nbest was that the Colonial Secretary should send out his orders, and\nthat the people in the colonies should mind their business and grow\ncoffee. When asked what would be the effect upon the islands, under\nhis scheme of government, if an incoming Colonial Secretary should\nchange the policy of his predecessor, he said that he didn't think it\nwould much matter if the people did not know anything about it.\n\nIn this way the Major had a field day, and poor Sir Marmaduke\nwas much discomfited. There was present on the Committee a young\nParliamentary Under-Secretary, who with much attention had studied\nthe subject of the Court of Chancery in the Mandarins, and who had\nacknowledged to his superiors in the office that it certainly was of\nall legislative assemblies the most awkward and complicated. He did\nwhat he could, by questions judiciously put, to pull Sir Marmaduke\nthrough his difficulties; but the unfortunate Governor had more than\nonce lost his temper in answering the chairman; and in his heavy\nconfusion was past the power of any Under-Secretary, let him be ever\nso clever, to pull him through. Colonel Osborne sat by the while and\nasked no questions. He had been put on the Committee as a respectable\ndummy; but there was not a member sitting there who did not know that\nSir Marmaduke had been brought home as his friend;--and some of them,\nno doubt, had whispered that this bringing home of Sir Marmaduke\nwas part of the payment made by the Colonel for the smiles of the\nGovernor's daughter. But no one alluded openly to the inefficiency of\nthe evidence given. No one asked why a Governor so incompetent had\nbeen sent to them. No one suggested that a job had been done. There\nare certain things of which opposition members of Parliament complain\nloudly;--and there are certain other things as to which they are\nsilent. The line between these things is well known; and should an\nill-conditioned, a pig-headed, an underbred, or an ignorant member\nnot understand this line and transgress it, by asking questions which\nshould not be asked, he is soon put down from the Treasury bench, to\nthe great delight of the whole House.\n\nSir Marmaduke, after having been questioned for an entire afternoon,\nleft the House with extreme disgust. He was so convinced of his own\nfailure, that he felt that his career as a Colonial Governor must be\nover. Surely they would never let him go back to his islands after\nsuch an exposition as he had made of his own ignorance. He hurried\noff into a cab, and was ashamed to be seen of men. But the members\nof the Committee thought little or nothing about it. The Major, and\nthose who sided with him, had been anxious to entrap their witness\ninto contradictions and absurdities, for the furtherance of their own\nobject; and for the furtherance of theirs, the Under-Secretary from\nthe Office and the supporters of Government had endeavoured to defend\ntheir man. But, when the affair was over, if no special admiration\nhad been elicited for Sir Marmaduke, neither was there expressed\nany special reprobation. The Major carried on his Committee over\nsix weeks, and succeeded in having his blue-book printed; but, as\na matter of course, nothing further came of it; and the Court of\nChancery in the Mandarin Islands still continues to hold its own,\nand to do its work, in spite of the absurdities displayed in its\nconstruction. Major Magruder has had his day of success, and now\nfeels that Othello's occupation is gone. He goes no more to the\nColonial Office, lives among his friends on the memories of his\nCommittee,--not always to their gratification,--and is beginning to\nthink that as his work is done he may as well resign Killicrankie to\nsome younger politician. Poor Sir Marmaduke remembered his defeat\nwith soreness long after it had been forgotten by all others who had\nbeen present, and was astonished when he found that the journals of\nthe day, though they did in some curt fashion report the proceedings\nof the Committee, never uttered a word of censure against him, as\nthey had not before uttered a word of praise for that pearl of a\nGovernor who had been examined before him.\n\nOn the following morning he went to the Colonial Office by\nappointment, and then he saw the young Irish Under-Secretary whom he\nhad so much dreaded. Nothing could be more civil than was the young\nIrish Under-Secretary, who told him that he had better of course stay\nin town till the Committee was over, though it was not probable that\nhe would be wanted again. When the Committee had done its work he\nwould be allowed to remain six weeks on service to prepare for his\njourney back. If he wanted more time after that he could ask for\nleave of absence. So Sir Marmaduke left the Colonial Office with a\ngreat weight off his mind, and blessed that young Irish Secretary as\nhe went.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\nSIR MARMADUKE AT WILLESDEN.\n\n\nOn the next day Sir Marmaduke purposed going to Willesden. He was in\ngreat doubt whether or no he would first consult that very eminent\nman Dr. Trite Turbury, as to the possibility, and,--if possible,--as\nto the expediency, of placing Mr. Trevelyan under some control. But\nSir Marmaduke, though he would repeatedly declare that his son-in-law\nwas mad, did not really believe in this madness. He did not, that\nis, believe that Trevelyan was so mad as to be fairly exempt from\nthe penalties of responsibility; and he was therefore desirous of\nspeaking his own mind out fully to the man, and, as it were, of\nhaving his own personal revenge, before he might be deterred by the\ninterposition of medical advice. He resolved therefore that he would\nnot see Sir Trite Turbury, at any rate till he had come back from\nWillesden. He also went down in a cab, but he left the cab at the\npublic-house at the corner of the road, and walked to the cottage.\n\nWhen he asked whether Mr. Trevelyan was at home, the woman of\nthe house hesitated and then said that her lodger was out. \"I\nparticularly wish to see him,\" said Sir Marmaduke, feeling that the\nwoman was lying to him. \"But he ain't to be seen, sir,\" said the\nwoman. \"I know he is at home,\" said Sir Marmaduke. But the argument\nwas soon cut short by the appearance of Trevelyan behind the woman's\nshoulder.\n\n\"I am here, Sir Marmaduke Rowley,\" said Trevelyan. \"If you wish to\nsee me you may come in. I will not say that you are welcome, but you\ncan come in.\" Then the woman retired, and Sir Marmaduke followed\nTrevelyan into the room in which Lady Rowley and Emily had been\nreceived; but the child was not now in the chamber.\n\n\"What are these charges that I hear against my daughter?\" said Sir\nMarmaduke, rushing at once into the midst of his indignation.\n\n\"I do not know what charges you have heard.\"\n\n\"You have put her away.\"\n\n\"In strict accuracy that is not correct, Sir Marmaduke.\"\n\n\"But she is put away. She is in my house now because you have no\nhouse of your own for her. Is not that so? And when I came home she\nwas staying with her uncle, because you had put her away. And what\nwas the meaning of her being sent down into Devonshire? What has she\ndone? I am her father, and I expect to have an answer.\"\n\n\"You shall have an answer, certainly.\"\n\n\"And a true one. I will have no hocus-pocus, no humbug, no Jesuitry.\"\n\n\"Have you come here to insult me, Sir Marmaduke? Because, if so,\nthere shall be an end to this interview at once.\"\n\n\"There shall not be an end;--by G----, no, not till I have heard what\nis the meaning of all this. Do you know what people are saying of\nyou;--that you are mad, and that you must be locked up, and your\nchild taken away from you, and your property?\"\n\n\"Who are the people that say so? Yourself;--and, perhaps, Lady\nRowley? Does my wife say so? Does she think that I am mad? She did\nnot think so on Thursday, when she prayed that she might be allowed\nto come back and live with me.\"\n\n\"And you would not let her come?\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Trevelyan. \"I would wish that she should come,--but\nit must be on certain conditions.\"\n\n\"What I want to know is why she was turned out of your house?\"\n\n\"She was not turned out.\"\n\n\"What has she done that she should be punished?\" urged Sir Marmaduke,\nwho was unable to arrange his questions with the happiness which had\ndistinguished Major Magruder. \"I insist upon knowing what it is that\nyou lay to her charge. I am her father, and I have a right to know.\nShe has been barbarously, shamefully ill-used, and by G---- I will\nknow.\"\n\n\"You have come here to bully me, Sir Marmaduke Rowley.\"\n\n\"I have come here, sir, to do the duty of a parent to his child;\nto protect my poor girl against the cruelty of a husband who in\nan unfortunate hour was allowed to take her from her home. I will\nknow the reason why my daughter has been treated as though,--as\nthough,--as though--\"\n\n\"Listen to me for a minute,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"I will tell you nothing; I will answer you not a word.\"\n\n\"You will not answer me?\"\n\n\"Not when you come to me in this fashion. My wife is my wife, and\nmy claim to her is nearer and closer than is yours, who are her\nfather. She is the mother of my child, and the only being in the\nworld,--except that child,--whom I love. Do you think that with\nsuch motives on my part for tenderness towards her, for loving care,\nfor the most anxious solicitude, that I can be made more anxious,\nmore tender, more loving by coarse epithets from you? I am the\nmost miserable being under the sun because our happiness has been\ninterrupted, and is it likely that such misery should be cured by\nviolent words and gestures? If your heart is wrung for her, so is\nmine. If she be much to you, she is more to me. She came here the\nother day, almost as a stranger, and I thought that my heart would\nhave burst beneath its weight of woe. What can you do that can add\nan ounce to the burden that I bear? You may as well leave me,--or at\nleast be quiet.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke had stood and listened to him, and he, too, was so\nstruck by the altered appearance of the man that the violence of his\nindignation was lessened by the pity which he could not suppress.\nWhen Trevelyan spoke of his wretchedness, it was impossible not to\nbelieve him. He was as wretched a being to look at as it might have\nbeen possible to find. His contracted cheeks, and lips always open,\nand eyes glowing in their sunken caverns, told a tale which even\nSir Marmaduke, who was not of nature quick in deciphering such\nstories, could not fail to read. And then the twitching motion of\nthe man's hands, and the restless shuffling of his feet, produced a\nnervous feeling that if some remedy were not applied quickly, some\nalleviation given to the misery of the suffering wretch, human power\nwould be strained too far, and the man would break to pieces,--or\nelse the mind of the man. Sir Marmaduke, during his journey in the\ncab, had resolved that, old as he was, he would take this sinner\nby the throat, this brute who had striven to stain his daughter's\nname,--and would make him there and then acknowledge his own\nbrutality. But it was now very manifest to Sir Marmaduke that there\ncould be no taking by the throat in this case. He could not have\nbrought himself to touch the poor, weak, passionate creature before\nhim. Indeed, even the fury of his words was stayed, and after that\nlast appeal he stormed no more. \"But what is to be the end of it?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Who can tell? Who can say? She can tell. She can put an end to it\nall. She has but to say a word, and I will devote my life to her. But\nthat word must be spoken.\" As he said this, he dashed his hand upon\nthe table, and looked up with an air that would have been comic with\nits assumed magnificence had it not been for the true tragedy of the\noccasion.\n\n\"You had better, at any rate, let her have her child for the\npresent.\"\n\n\"No;--my boy shall go with me. She may go, too, if she pleases, but\nmy boy shall certainly go with me. If I had put her from me, as you\nsaid just now, it might have been otherwise. But she shall be as\nwelcome to me as flowers in May,--as flowers in May! She shall be as\nwelcome to me as the music of heaven.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke felt that he had nothing more to urge. He had\naltogether abandoned that idea of having his revenge at the cost of\nthe man's throat, and was quite convinced that reason could have\nno power with him. He was already thinking that he would go away,\nstraight to his lawyer, so that some step might be taken at once to\nstop, if possible, the taking away of the boy to America, when the\nlock of the door was gently turned, and the landlady entered the\nroom.\n\n\"You will excuse me, sir,\" said the woman, \"but if you be anything to\nthis gentleman--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fuller, leave the room,\" said Trevelyan. \"I and the gentleman\nare engaged.\"\n\n\"I see you be engaged, and I do beg pardon. I ain't one as would\nintrude wilful, and, as for listening, or the likes of that, I scorn\nit. But if this gentleman be anything to you, Mr. Trevelyan--\"\n\n\"I am his wife's father,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Like enough. I was thinking perhaps so. His lady was down here on\nThursday,--as sweet a lady as any gentleman need wish to stretch by\nhis side.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fuller,\" said Trevelyan, marching up towards her, \"I will not\nhave this, and I desire that you will retire from my room.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Fuller escaped round the table, and would not be banished.\nShe got round the table, and came closely opposite to Sir Marmaduke.\n\"I don't want to say nothing out of my place, sir,\" said she, \"but\nsomething ought to be done. He ain't fit to be left to hisself,--not\nalone,--not as he is at present. He ain't, indeed, and I wouldn't be\ndoing my duty if I didn't say so. He has them sweats at night as'd be\nenough to kill any man; and he eats nothing, and he don't do nothing;\nand as for that poor little boy as is now in my own bed upstairs, if\nit wasn't that I and my Bessy is fond of children, I don't know what\nwould become of that boy.\"\n\nTrevelyan, finding it impossible to get rid of her, had stood\nquietly, while he listened to her. \"She has been good to my child,\"\nhe said. \"I acknowledge it. As for myself, I have not been well. It\nis true. But I am told that travel will set me on my feet again.\nChange of air will do it.\" Not long since he had been urging the\nwretchedness of his own bodily health as a reason why his wife\nshould yield to him; but now, when his sickness was brought as a\ncharge against him,--was adduced as a reason why his friends should\ninterfere, and look after him, and concern themselves in his affairs,\nhe saw at once that it was necessary that he should make little of\nhis ailments.\n\n\"Would it not be best, Trevelyan, that you should come with me to a\ndoctor?\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"No;--no. I have my own doctor. That is, I know the course which\nI should follow. This place, though it is good for the boy, has\ndisagreed with me, and my life has not been altogether pleasant;--I\nmay say, by no means pleasant. Troubles have told upon me, but change\nof air will mend it all.\"\n\n\"I wish you would come with me, at once, to London. You shall come\nback, you know. I will not detain you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,--no. I will not trouble you. That will do, Mrs. Fuller.\nYou have intended to do your duty, no doubt, and now you can go.\"\nWhereupon Mrs. Fuller did go. \"I am obliged for your care, Sir\nMarmaduke, but I can really do very well without troubling you.\"\n\n\"You cannot suppose, Trevelyan, that we can allow things to go on\nlike this.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Well;--I shall take advice. I shall go to a lawyer,--and to a\ndoctor, and perhaps to the Lord Chancellor, and all that kind of\nthing. We can't let things go on like this.\"\n\n\"You can do as you please,\" said Trevelyan, \"but as you have\nthreatened me, I must ask you to leave me.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke could do no more, and could say no more, and he took\nhis leave, shaking hands with the man, and speaking to him with a\ncourtesy which astonished himself. It was impossible to maintain\nthe strength of his indignation against a poor creature who was so\nmanifestly unable to guide himself. But when he was in London he\ndrove at once to the house of Dr. Trite Turbury, and remained there\ntill the doctor returned from his round of visits. According to\nthe great authority, there was much still to be done before even\nthe child could be rescued out of the father's hands. \"I can't act\nwithout the lawyers,\" said Dr. Turbury. But he explained to Sir\nMarmaduke what steps should be taken in such a matter.\n\nTrevelyan, in the mean time, clearly understanding that hostile\nmeasures would now be taken against him, set his mind to work to\nthink how best he might escape at once to America with his boy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\nSHEWING WHAT NORA ROWLEY THOUGHT ABOUT CARRIAGES.\n\n\nSir Marmaduke, on his return home from Dr. Turbury's house, found\nthat he had other domestic troubles on hand over and above those\narising from his elder daughter's position. Mr. Hugh Stanbury had\nbeen in Manchester Street during his absence, and had asked for him,\nand, finding that he was away from home, had told his story to Lady\nRowley. When he had been shown up-stairs all the four daughters had\nbeen with their mother; but he had said a word or two signifying his\ndesire to speak to Lady Rowley, and the three girls had left the\nroom. In this way it came to pass that he had to plead his cause\nbefore Nora's mother and her elder sister. He had pleaded it well,\nand Lady Rowley's heart had been well disposed towards him; but when\nshe asked of his house and his home, his answer had been hardly more\nsatisfactory than that of Alan-a-Dale. There was little that he\ncould call his own beyond \"The blue vault of heaven.\" Had he saved\nany money? No,--not a shilling;--that was to say,--as he himself\nexpressed it,--nothing that could be called money. He had a few\npounds by him, just to go on with. What was his income? Well--last\nyear he had made four hundred pounds, and this year he hoped to make\nsomething more. He thought he could see his way plainly to five\nhundred a year. Was it permanent; and if not, on what did it depend?\nHe believed it to be as permanent as most other professional incomes,\nbut was obliged to confess that, as regarded the source from whence\nit was drawn at the present moment, it might be brought to an abrupt\nend any day by a disagreement between himself and the editor of the\nD. R. Did he think that this was a fixed income? He did think that if\nhe and the editor of the D. R. were to fall out, he could come across\nother editors who would gladly employ him. Would he himself feel safe\nin giving his own sister to a man with such an income? In answer to\nthis question, he started some rather bold doctrines on the subject\nof matrimony in general, asserting that safety was not desirable,\nthat energy, patience, and mutual confidence would be increased by\nthe excitement of risk, and that in his opinion it behoved young men\nand young women to come together and get themselves married, even\nthough there might be some not remote danger of distress before them.\nHe admitted that starvation would be disagreeable,--especially for\nchildren, in the eyes of their parents,--but alleged that children\nas a rule were not starved, and quoted the Scripture to prove that\nhonest laborious men were not to be seen begging their bread in\nthe streets. He was very eloquent, but his eloquence itself was\nagainst him. Both Lady Rowley and Mrs. Trevelyan were afraid of such\nadvanced opinions; and, although everything was of course to be left,\nnominally, to the decision of Sir Marmaduke, they both declared that\nthey could not recommend Sir Marmaduke to consent. Lady Rowley said\na word as to the expediency of taking Nora back with her to the\nMandarins, pointing out what appeared to her then to be the necessity\nof taking Mrs. Trevelyan with them also; and in saying this she\nhinted that if Nora were disposed to stand by her engagement, and\nMr. Stanbury equally so disposed, there might be some possibility\nof a marriage at a future period. Only in such case, there must be\nno correspondence. In answer to this Hugh declared that he regarded\nsuch a scheme as being altogether bad. The Mandarins were so very far\ndistant that he might as well be engaged to an angel in heaven. Nora,\nif she were to go away now, would perhaps never come back again; and\nif she did come back, would be an old woman, with hollow cheeks. In\nreplying to this proposition, he let fall an opinion that Nora was\nold enough to judge for herself. He said nothing about her actual\nage, and did not venture to plead that the young lady had a legal\nright to do as she liked with herself; but he made it manifest that\nsuch an idea was in his mind. In answer to this, Lady Rowley asserted\nthat Nora was a good girl, and would do as her father told her; but\nshe did not venture to assert that Nora would give up her engagement.\nLady Rowley at last undertook to speak to Sir Rowley, and to speak\nalso to her daughter. Hugh was asked for his address, and gave that\nof the office of the D. R. He was always to be found there between\nthree and five; and after that, four times a week, in the reporters'\ngallery of the House of Commons. Then he was at some pains to explain\nto Lady Rowley that though he attended the reporters' gallery, he\ndid not report himself. It was his duty to write leading political\narticles, and, to enable him to do so, he attended the debates.\n\nBefore he went Mrs. Trevelyan thanked him most cordially for the\ntrouble he had taken in procuring for her the address at Willesden,\nand gave him some account of the journey which she and her mother\nhad made to River's Cottage. He argued with both of them that the\nunfortunate man must now be regarded as being altogether out of his\nmind, and something was said as to the great wisdom and experience of\nDr. Trite Turbury. Then Hugh Stanbury took his leave; and even Lady\nRowley bade him adieu with kind cordiality. \"I don't wonder, mamma,\nthat Nora should like him,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"That is all very well, my dear, and no doubt he is pleasant, and\nmanly, and all that;--but really it would be almost like marrying a\nbeggar.\"\n\n\"For myself,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan, \"if I could begin life again, I do\nnot think that any temptation would induce me to place myself in a\nman's power.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke was told of all this on his return home, and he asked\nmany questions as to the nature of Stanbury's work. When it was\nexplained to him,--Lady Rowley repeating as nearly as she could all\nthat Hugh had himself said about it, he expressed his opinion that\nwriting for a penny newspaper was hardly more safe as a source of\nincome than betting on horse races. \"I don't see that it is wrong,\"\nsaid Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"I say nothing about wrong. I simply assert that it is uncertain. The\nvery existence of such a periodical must in itself be most insecure.\"\nSir Marmaduke, amidst the cares of his government at the Mandarins,\nhad, perhaps, had no better opportunity of watching what was going on\nin the world of letters than had fallen to the lot of Miss Stanbury\nat Exeter.\n\n\"I think your papa is right,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Of course I am right. It is out of the question; and so Nora must\nbe told.\" He had as yet heard nothing about Mr. Glascock. Had that\nmisfortune been communicated to him his cup would indeed have been\nfilled with sorrow to overflowing.\n\nIn the evening Nora was closeted with her father. \"Nora, my dear,\nyou must understand, once and for all, that this cannot be,\" said\nSir Marmaduke. The Governor, when he was not disturbed by outward\ncircumstances, could assume a good deal of personal dignity, and\ncould speak, especially to his children, with an air of indisputable\nauthority.\n\n\"What can't be, papa?\" said Nora.\n\nSir Marmaduke perceived at once that there was no indication of\nobedience in his daughter's voice, and he prepared himself for\nbattle. He conceived himself to be very strong, and thought that his\nobjections were so well founded that no one would deny their truth\nand that his daughter had not a leg to stand on. \"This, that your\nmamma tells me of about Mr. Stanbury. Do you know, my dear, that he\nhas not a shilling in the world?\"\n\n\"I know that he has no fortune, papa,--if you mean that.\"\n\n\"And no profession either;--nothing that can be called a profession.\nI do not wish to argue it, my dear, because there is no room for\nargument. The whole thing is preposterous. I cannot but think ill\nof him for having proposed it to you; for he must have known,--must\nhave known, that a young man without an income cannot be accepted as\na fitting suitor for a gentleman's daughter. As for yourself, I can\nonly hope that you will get the little idea out of your head very\nquickly;--but mamma will speak to you about that. What I want you to\nunderstand from me is this,--that there must be an end to it.\"\n\nNora listened to this speech in perfect silence, standing before her\nfather, and waiting patiently till the last word of it should be\npronounced. Even when he had finished she still paused before she\nanswered him. \"Papa,\" she said at last, and hesitated again before\nshe went on.\n\n\"Well, my dear.\"\n\n\"I can not give it up.\"\n\n\"But you must give it up.\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"But you must give it up,\" said Sir Marmaduke.]\n\n\n\"No, papa. I would do anything I could for you and mamma, but that is\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Why is it impossible?\"\n\n\"Because I love him so dearly.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense. That is what all girls say when they choose to\nrun against their parents. I tell you that it shall be given up. I\nwill not have him here. I forbid you to see him. It is quite out of\nthe question that you should marry such a man. I do hope, Nora, that\nyou are not going to add to mamma's difficulties and mine by being\nobstinate and disobedient.\" He paused a moment, and then added, \"I do\nnot think that there is anything more to be said.\"\n\n\"Papa.\"\n\n\"My dear, I think you had better say nothing further about it. If you\ncannot bring yourself at the present moment to promise that there\nshall be an end of it, you had better hold your tongue. You have\nheard what I say, and you have heard what mamma says. I do not for\na moment suppose that you dream of carrying on a communication with\nthis gentleman in opposition to our wishes.\"\n\n\"But I do.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Papa, you had better listen to me.\" Sir Marmaduke, when he heard\nthis, assumed an air of increased authority, in which he intended\nthat paternal anger should be visible; but he seated himself, and\nprepared to receive, at any rate, some of the arguments with which\nNora intended to bolster up her bad cause. \"I have promised Mr.\nStanbury that I will be his wife.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense.\"\n\n\"Do listen to me, papa. I have listened to you and you ought to\nlisten to me. I have promised him, and I must keep my promise. I\nshall keep my promise if he wishes it. There is a time when a girl\nmust be supposed to know what is best for herself,--just as there is\nfor a man.\"\n\n\"I never heard such stuff in all my life. Do you mean that you'll go\nout and marry him like a beggar, with nothing but what you stand up\nin, with no friend to be with you, an outcast, thrown off by your\nmother,--with your father's--curse?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, do not say that. You would not curse me. You could not.\"\n\n\"If you do it at all, that will be the way.\"\n\n\"That will not be the way, papa. You could not treat me like that.\"\n\n\"And how are you proposing to treat me?\"\n\n\"But, papa, in whatever way I do it, I must do it. I do not say\nto-day or to-morrow; but it must be the intention and purpose of\nmy life, and I must declare that it is, everywhere. I have made\nup my mind about it. I am engaged to him, and I shall always say\nso,--unless he breaks it. I don't care a bit about fortune. I thought\nI did once, but I have changed all that.\"\n\n\"Because this scoundrel has talked sedition to you.\"\n\n\"He is not a scoundrel, papa, and he has not talked sedition. I don't\nknow what sedition is. I thought it meant treason, and I'm sure he is\nnot a traitor. He has made me love him, and I shall be true to him.\"\n\nHereupon Sir Marmaduke began almost to weep. There came first a\nhalf-smothered oath and then a sob, and he walked about the room, and\nstruck the table with his fist, and rubbed his bald head impatiently\nwith his hand. \"Nora,\" he said, \"I thought you were so different from\nthis! If I had believed this of you, you never should have come to\nEngland with Emily.\"\n\n\"It is too late for that now, papa.\"\n\n\"Your mamma always told me that you had such excellent ideas about\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"So I have,--I think,\" said she, smiling.\n\n\"She always believed that you would make a match that would be a\ncredit to the family.\"\n\n\"I tried it, papa;--the sort of match that you mean. Indeed I was\nmercenary enough in what I believed to be my views of life. I meant\nto marry a rich man,--if I could, and did not think much whether I\nshould love him or not. But when the rich man came--\"\n\n\"What rich man?\"\n\n\"I suppose mamma has told you about Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Glascock? I have not heard a word about Mr. Glascock.\"\nThen Nora was forced to tell her story,--was called upon to tell it\nwith all its aggravating details. By degrees Sir Marmaduke learned\nthat this Mr. Glascock, who had desired to be his son-in-law, was in\nvery truth the heir to the Peterborough title and estates,--would\nhave been such a son-in-law as almost to compensate, by the\nbrilliance of the connection, for that other unfortunate alliance. He\ncould hardly control his agony when he was made to understand that\nthis embryo peer had in truth been in earnest. \"Do you mean that he\nwent down after you into Devonshire?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"And you refused him then,--a second time?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"Why;--why;--why? You say yourself that you liked him;--that you\nthought that you would accept him.\"\n\n\"When it came to speaking the word, papa, I found that I could not\npretend to love him when I did not love him. I did not care for\nhim,--and I liked somebody else so much better! I just told him the\nplain truth,--and so he went away.\"\n\nThe thought of all that he had lost, of all that might so easily have\nbeen his, for a time overwhelmed Sir Marmaduke, and drove the very\nmemory of Hugh Stanbury almost out of his head. He could understand\nthat a girl should not marry a man whom she did not like; but he\ncould not understand how any girl should not love such a suitor\nas was Mr. Glascock. And had she accepted this pearl of men, with\nher position, with her manners and beauty and appearance, such a\nconnection would have been as good as an assured marriage for every\none of Sir Marmaduke's numerous daughters. Nora was just the woman to\nlook like a great lady, a lady of high rank,--such a lady as could\nalmost command men to come and throw themselves at her unmarried\nsisters' feet. Sir Marmaduke had believed in his daughter Nora, had\nlooked forward to see her do much for the family; and, when the crash\nhad come upon the Trevelyan household, had thought almost as much\nof her injured prospects as he had of the misfortune of her sister.\nBut now it seemed that more than all the good things of what he had\ndreamed had been proposed to this unruly girl, in spite of that great\ncrash,--and had been rejected! And he saw more than this,--as he\nthought. These good things would have been accepted had it not been\nfor this rascal of a penny-a-liner, this friend of that other rascal\nTrevelyan, who had come in the way of their family to destroy the\nhappiness of them all! Sir Marmaduke, in speaking of Stanbury after\nthis, would constantly call him a penny-a-liner, thinking that the\ncontamination of the penny communicated itself to all transactions of\nthe Daily Record.\n\n\"You have made your bed for yourself, Nora, and you must lie upon\nit.\"\n\n\"Just so, papa.\"\n\n\"I mean that, as you have refused Mr. Glascock's offer, you can never\nagain hope for such an opening in life.\"\n\n\"Of course I cannot. I am not such a child as to suppose that there\nare many Mr. Glascocks to come and run after me. And if there were\never so many, papa, it would be no good. As you say, I have chosen\nfor myself, and I must put up with it. When I see the carriages going\nabout in the streets, and remember how often I shall have to go home\nin an omnibus, I do think about it a good deal.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you will think when it is too late.\"\n\n\"It isn't that I don't like carriages, papa. I do like them; and\npretty dresses, and brooches, and men and women who have nothing to\ndo, and balls, and the opera; but--I love this man, and that is more\nto me than all the rest. I cannot help myself, if it were ever so.\nPapa, you mustn't be angry with me. Pray, pray, pray do not say that\nhorrid word again.\"\n\nThis was the end of the interview. Sir Marmaduke found that he had\nnothing further to say. Nora, when she reached her last prayer to her\nfather, referring to that curse with which he had threatened her, was\nherself in tears, and was leaning on him with her head against his\nshoulder. Of course he did not say a word which could be understood\nas sanctioning her engagement with Stanbury. He was as strongly\ndetermined as ever that it was his duty to save her from the perils\nof such a marriage as that. But, nevertheless, he was so far overcome\nby her as to be softened in his manners towards her. He kissed her as\nhe left her, and told her to go to her mother. Then he went out and\nthought of it all, and felt as though Paradise had been opened to his\nchild and she had refused to enter the gate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\nSHEWING WHAT HUGH STANBURY THOUGHT ABOUT THE DUTY OF MAN.\n\n\nIn the conference which took place between Sir Marmaduke and his\nwife after the interview between him and Nora, it was his idea that\nnothing further should be done at all. \"I don't suppose the man will\ncome here if he be told not,\" said Sir Marmaduke, \"and if he does,\nNora of course will not see him.\" He then suggested that Nora would\nof course go back with them to the Mandarins, and that when once\nthere she would not be able to see Stanbury any more. \"There must be\nno correspondence or anything of that sort, and so the thing will die\naway.\" But Lady Rowley declared that this would not quite suffice.\nMr. Stanbury had made his offer in due form, and must be held to be\nentitled to an answer. Sir Marmaduke, therefore, wrote the following\nletter to the \"penny-a-liner,\" mitigating the asperity of his\nlanguage in compliance with his wife's counsels.\n\n\n   Manchester Street, April 20th, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,--\n\n   Lady Rowley has told me of your proposal to my daughter\n   Nora; and she has told me also what she learned from you\n   as to your circumstances in life. I need hardly point out\n   to you that no father would be justified in giving his\n   daughter to a gentleman upon so small an income, and upon\n   an income so very insecure.\n\n   I am obliged to refuse my consent, and I must therefore\n   ask you to abstain from visiting and from communicating\n   with my daughter.\n\n   Yours faithfully,\n\n   MARMADUKE ROWLEY.\n\n   Hugh Stanbury, Esq.\n\n\nThis letter was directed to Stanbury at the office of the D. R.,\nand Sir Marmaduke, as he wrote the pernicious address, felt himself\ninjured in that he was compelled to write about his daughter to a man\nso circumstanced. Stanbury, when he got the letter, read it hastily\nand then threw it aside. He knew what it would contain before he\nopened it. He had heard enough from Lady Rowley to be aware that Sir\nMarmaduke would not welcome him as a son-in-law. Indeed, he had never\nexpected such welcome. He was half-ashamed of his own suit because of\nthe lowliness of his position,--half-regretful that he should have\ninduced such a girl as Nora Rowley to give up for his sake her hopes\nof magnificence and splendour. But Sir Marmaduke's letter did not add\nanything to this feeling. He read it again, and smiled as he told\nhimself that the father would certainly be very weak in the hands\nof his daughter. Then he went to work again at his article with a\npersistent resolve that so small a trifle as such a note should have\nno effect upon his daily work. Of course Sir Marmaduke would refuse\nhis consent. Of course it would be for him, Stanbury, to marry the\ngirl he loved in opposition to her father. Her father indeed! If Nora\nchose to take him,--and as to that he was very doubtful as to Nora's\nwisdom,--but if Nora would take him, what was any father's opposition\nto him? He wanted nothing from Nora's father. He was not looking\nfor money with his wife;--nor for fashion, nor countenance. Such a\nBohemian was he that he would be quite satisfied if his girl would\nwalk out to him, and become his wife, with any morning-gown on and\nwith any old hat that might come readiest to hand. He wanted neither\ncards, nor breakfast, nor carriages, nor fine clothes. If his Nora\nshould choose to come to him as she was, he having had all previous\nnecessary arrangements duly made,--such as calling of banns or\nprocuring of licence if possible,--he thought that a father's\nopposition would almost add something to the pleasure of the\noccasion. So he pitched the letter on one side, and went on with his\narticle. And he finished his article; but it may be doubted whether\nit was completed with the full strength and pith needed for moving\nthe pulses of the national mind,--as they should be moved by leading\narticles in the D. R. As he was writing he was thinking of Nora,--and\nthinking of the letter which Nora's father had sent to him. Trivial\nas was the letter, he could not keep himself from repeating the words\nof it to himself. \"'Need hardly point out,'--oh; needn't he. Then\nwhy does he? Refusing his consent! I wonder what the old buffers\nthink is the meaning of their consent, when they are speaking of\ndaughters old enough to manage for themselves? Abstain from visiting\nor communicating with her! But if she visits and communicates with\nme;--what then? I can't force my way into the house, but she can\nforce her way out. Does he imagine that she can be locked up in the\nnursery or put into the corner?\" So he argued with himself, and by\nsuch arguments he brought himself to the conviction that it would\nbe well for him to answer Sir Marmaduke's letter. This he did at\nonce,--before leaving the office of the D. R.\n\n\n   250, Fleet Street, 20th April.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR MARMADUKE ROWLEY,--\n\n   I have just received your letter, and am indeed sorry that\n   its contents should be so little favourable to my hopes.\n   I understand that your objection to me is simply in regard\n   to the smallness and insecurity of my income. On the first\n   point I may say that I have fair hopes that it may be\n   at once increased. As to the second, I believe I may\n   assert that it is as sure at least as the income of other\n   professional men, such as barristers, merchants, and\n   doctors. I cannot promise to say that I will not see your\n   daughter. If she desires me to do so, of course I shall\n   be guided by her views. I wish that I might be allowed an\n   opportunity of seeing you, as I think I could reverse or\n   at least mitigate some of the objections which you feel to\n   our marriage.\n\n   Yours most faithfully,\n\n   HUGH STANBURY.\n\n\nOn the next day but one Sir Marmaduke came to him. He was sitting\nat the office of the D. R., in a very small and dirty room at the\nback of the house, and Sir Marmaduke found his way thither through\na confused crowd of compositors, pressmen, and printers' boys. He\nthought that he had never before been in a place so foul, so dark,\nso crowded, and so comfortless. He himself was accustomed to do his\nwork, out in the Islands, with many of the appanages of vice-royalty\naround him. He had his secretary, and his private secretary, and his\ninner-room, and his waiting-room; and not unfrequently he had the\nhonour of a dusky sentinel walking before the door through which he\nwas to be approached. He had an idea that all gentlemen at their\nwork had comfortable appurtenances around them,--such as carpets,\ndispatch-boxes, unlimited stationery, easy chairs for temporary\nleisure, big table-space, and a small world of books around them\nto give at least a look of erudition to their pursuits. There was\nnothing of the kind in the miserably dark room occupied by Stanbury.\nHe was sitting at a wretched little table on which there was nothing\nbut a morsel of blotting paper, a small ink-bottle, and the paper\non which he was scribbling. There was no carpet there, and no\ndispatch-box, and the only book in the room was a little dog's-eared\ndictionary. \"Sir Marmaduke, I am so much obliged to you for coming,\"\nsaid Hugh. \"I fear you will find this place a little rough, but we\nshall be all alone.\"\n\n\"The place, Mr. Stanbury, will not signify, I think.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,--if you don't mind it. I got your letter, you\nknow, Sir Marmaduke.\"\n\n\"And I have had your reply. I have come to you because you have\nexpressed a wish for an interview;--but I do not see that it will do\nany good.\"\n\n\"You are very kind for coming, indeed, Sir Marmaduke;--very kind. I\nthought I might explain something to you about my income.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me that you have any permanent income?\"\n\n\"It goes on regularly from month to month;\"--Sir Marmaduke did not\nfeel the slightest respect for an income that was paid monthly.\nAccording to his ideas, a gentleman's income should be paid\nquarterly, or perhaps half-yearly. According to his view, a monthly\nsalary was only one degree better than weekly wages;--\"and I suppose\nthat is permanence,\" said Hugh Stanbury.\n\n\"I cannot say that I so regard it.\"\n\n\"A barrister gets his, you know, very irregularly. There is no saying\nwhen he may have it.\"\n\n\"But a barrister's profession is recognised as a profession among\ngentlemen, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"And is not ours recognised? Which of us, barristers or men of\nliterature, have the most effect on the world at large? Who is most\nthought of in London, Sir Marmaduke,--the Lord Chancellor or the\nEditor of the 'Jupiter?'\"\n\n\"The Lord Chancellor a great deal,\" said Sir Marmaduke, quite\ndismayed by the audacity of the question.\n\n\"By no means, Sir Marmaduke,\" said Stanbury, throwing out his hand\nbefore him so as to give the energy of action to his words. \"He has\nthe higher rank. I will admit that.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"And the larger income.\"\n\n\"Very much larger, I should say,\" said Sir Marmaduke, with a smile.\n\n\"And he wears a wig.\"\n\n\"Yes;--he wears a wig,\" said Sir Marmaduke, hardly knowing in what\nspirit to accept this assertion.\n\n\"And nobody cares one brass button for him or his opinions,\" said\nStanbury, bringing down his hand heavily on the little table for the\nsake of emphasis.\n\n\"What, sir?\"\n\n\"If you'll think of it, it is so.\"\n\n\"Nobody cares for the Lord Chancellor!\" It certainly is the fact that\ngentlemen living in the Mandarin Islands do think more of the Lord\nChancellor, and the Lord Mayor, and the Lord-Lieutenant, and the Lord\nChamberlain, than they whose spheres of life bring them into closer\ncontact with those august functionaries. \"I presume, Mr. Stanbury,\nthat a connection with a penny newspaper makes such opinions as these\nalmost a necessity.\"\n\n\"Quite a necessity, Sir Marmaduke. No man can hold his own in print,\nnow-a-days, unless he can see the difference between tinsel and\ngold.\"\n\n\"And the Lord Chancellor, of course, is tinsel.\"\n\n\"I do not say so. He may be a great lawyer,--and very useful. But his\nlordship, and his wig, and his woolsack, are tinsel in comparison\nwith the real power possessed by the editor of a leading newspaper.\nIf the Lord Chancellor were to go to bed for a month, would he be\nmuch missed?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir. I'm not in the secrets of the Cabinet. I should\nthink he would.\"\n\n\"About as much as my grandmother;--but if the Editor of the 'Jupiter'\nwere to be taken ill, it would work quite a commotion. For myself I\nshould be glad,--on public grounds,--because I don't like his mode of\nbusiness. But it would have an effect,--because he is a leading man.\"\n\n\"I don't see what all this leads to, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Only to this,--that we who write for the press think that our\ncalling is recognised, and must be recognised as a profession. Talk\nof permanence, Sir Marmaduke, are not the newspapers permanent? Do\nnot they come out regularly every day,--and more of them, and still\nmore of them, are always coming out? You do not expect a collapse\namong them.\"\n\n\"There will be plenty of newspapers, I do not doubt;--more than\nplenty, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Somebody must write them,--and the writers will be paid.\"\n\n\"Anybody could write the most of them, I should say.\"\n\n\"I wish you would try, Sir Marmaduke. Just try your hand at a leading\narticle to-night, and read it yourself to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I've a great deal too much to do, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"Just so. You have, no doubt, the affairs of your Government to look\nto. We are all so apt to ignore the work of our neighbours! It seems\nto me that I could go over and govern the Mandarins without the\nslightest trouble in the world. But no doubt I am mistaken;--just as\nyou are about writing for the newspapers.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Sir Marmaduke, rising from his chair with\ndignity, \"that I called here to discuss such matters as these. As it\nhappens, you, Mr. Stanbury, are not the Governor of the Mandarins,\nand I have not the honour to write for the columns of the penny\nnewspaper with which you are associated. It is therefore useless\nto discuss what either of us might do in the position held by the\nother.\"\n\n\"Altogether useless, Sir Marmaduke,--except just for the fun of the\nthing.\"\n\n\"I do not see the fun, Mr. Stanbury. I came here, at your request,\nto hear what you might have to urge against the decision which I\nexpressed to you in reference to my daughter. As it seems that you\nhave nothing to urge, I will not take up your time further.\"\n\n\"But I have a great deal to urge, and have urged a great deal.\"\n\n\"Have you, indeed?\"\n\n\"You have complained that my work is not permanent. I have shewn that\nit is so permanent that there is no possibility of its coming to an\nend. There must be newspapers, and the people trained to write them\nmust be employed. I have been at it now about two years. You know\nwhat I earn. Could I have got so far in so short a time as a lawyer,\na doctor, a clergyman, a soldier, a sailor, a Government clerk, or\nin any of those employments which you choose to call professions? I\nthink that is urging a great deal. I think it is urging everything.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Stanbury. I have listened to you, and in a certain\ndegree I admire your,--your,--your zeal and ingenuity, shall I say.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to call for admiration, Sir Marmaduke; but suppose you\nsay,--good sense and discrimination.\"\n\n\"Let that pass. You must permit me to remark that your position is\nnot such as to justify me in trusting my daughter to your care. As my\nmind on that matter is quite made up, as is that also of Lady Rowley,\nI must ask you to give me your promise that your suit to my daughter\nshall be discontinued.\"\n\n\"What does she say about it, Sir Marmaduke?\"\n\n\"What she has said to me has been for my ears, and not for yours.\"\n\n\"What I say is for her ears and for yours, and for her mother's ears,\nand for the ears of any who may choose to hear it. I will never give\nup my suit to your daughter till I am forced to do so by a full\nconviction that she has given me up. It is best to be plain, Sir\nMarmaduke, of course.\"\n\n\"I do not understand this, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\n\"I mean to be quite clear.\"\n\n\"I have always thought that when a gentleman was told by the head of\na family that he could not be made welcome in that family, it was\nconsidered to be the duty of that gentleman,--as a gentleman,--to\nabandon his vain pursuit. I have been brought up with that idea.\"\n\n\"And I, Sir Marmaduke, have been brought up in the idea that when\na man has won the affections of a woman, it is the duty of that\nman,--as a man,--to stick to her through thick and thin; and I mean\nto do my duty, according to my idea.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I have nothing further to say, but to take my leave. I\nmust only caution you not to enter my doors.\" As the passages were\ndark and intricate, it was necessary that Stanbury should shew Sir\nMarmaduke out, and this he did in silence. When they parted each of\nthem lifted his hat, and not a word more was said.\n\nThat same night there was a note put into Nora's hands, as she was\nfollowing her mother out of one of the theatres. In the confusion she\ndid not even see the messenger who had handed it to her. Her sister\nLucy saw that she had taken the note, and questioned her about it\nafterwards,--with discretion, however, and in privacy. This was the\nnote:--\n\n\n   DEAREST LOVE,\n\n   I have seen your father, who is stern,--after the manner\n   of fathers. What granite equals a parent's flinty bosom!\n   For myself, I do not prefer clandestine arrangements\n   and rope ladders; and you, dear, have nothing of the\n   Lydia about you. But I do like my own way, and like it\n   especially when you are at the end of the path. It is\n   quite out of the question that you should go back to those\n   islands. I think I am justified in already assuming enough\n   of the husband to declare that such going back must not be\n   held for a moment in question. My proposition is that you\n   should authorise me to make such arrangements as may be\n   needed, in regard to licence, banns, or whatever else, and\n   that you should then simply walk from the house to the\n   church and marry me. You are of age, and can do as you\n   please. Neither your father nor mother can have any right\n   to stop you. I do not doubt but that your mother would\n   accompany you, if she were fully satisfied of your\n   purpose. Write to me to the D. R.\n\n   Your own, ever and ever, and always,\n\n   H. S.\n\n   I shall try and get this given to you as you leave the\n   theatre. If it should fall into other hands, I don't much\n   care. I'm not in the least ashamed of what I am doing; and\n   I hope that you are not.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\nTHE DELIVERY OF THE LAMB.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nIt is hoped that a certain quarter of lamb will not have been\nforgotten,--a quarter of lamb that was sent as a peace-offering from\nExeter to Nuncombe Putney by the hands of Miss Stanbury's Martha, not\nwith purposes of corruption, not intended to buy back the allegiance\nof Dorothy,--folded delicately and temptingly in one of the best\ntable napkins, with no idea of bribery, but sent as presents used\nto be sent of old in the trains of great ambassadors as signs of\nfriendship and marks of true respect. Miss Stanbury was, no doubt,\nmost anxious that her niece should return to her, but was not,\nherself, low spirited enough to conceive that a quarter of lamb\ncould be efficacious in procuring such return. If it might be that\nDorothy's heart could be touched by mention of the weariness of her\naunt's solitary life; and if, therefore, she would return, it would\nbe very well; but it could not be well so, unless the offer should\ncome from Dorothy herself. All of which Martha had been made to\nunderstand by her mistress, considerable ingenuity having been\nexercised in the matter on each side.\n\nOn her arrival at Lessboro', Martha had hired a fly, and been driven\nout to Nuncombe Putney; but she felt, she knew not why, a dislike\nto be taken in her carriage to the door of the cottage; and was put\ndown in the middle of the village, from whence she walked out to Mrs.\nStanbury's abode, with the basket upon her arm. It was a good half\nmile, and the lamb was heavy, for Miss Stanbury had suggested that a\nbottle of sherry should be put in under the napkin,--and Martha was\nbecoming tired of her burden, when,--whom should she see on the road\nbefore her but Brooke Burgess! As she said herself afterwards, it\nimmediately occurred to her, \"that all the fat was in the fire.\" Here\nhad this young man come down, passing through Exeter without even a\nvisit to Miss Stanbury, and had clandestinely sought out the young\nwoman whom he wasn't to marry; and here was the young woman herself\nflying in her aunt's face, when one scratch of a pen might ruin them\nboth! Martha entertained a sacred, awful, overcoming feeling about\nher mistress's will. That she was to have something herself she\nsupposed, and her anxiety was not on that score; but she had heard\nso much about it, had realised so fully the great power which Miss\nStanbury possessed, and had had her own feelings so rudely invaded by\nalterations in Miss Stanbury's plans, that she had come to entertain\nan idea that all persons around her should continually bear that will\nin their memory. Hugh had undoubtedly been her favourite, and, could\nMartha have dictated the will herself, she would still have made Hugh\nthe heir; but she had realised the resolution of her mistress so\nfar as to confess that the bulk of the property was to go back to a\nBurgess. But there were very many Burgesses; and here was the one\nwho had been selected flying in the very face of the testatrix! What\nwas to be done? Were she to go back and not tell her mistress that\nshe had seen Brooke Burgess at Nuncombe then,--should the fact be\nfound out,--would the devoted anger of Miss Stanbury fall upon\nher own head? It would be absolutely necessary that she should\ntell the story, let the consequences be what they might;--but the\nconsequences, probably, would be very dreadful. \"Mr. Brooke, that is\nnot you?\" she said, as she came up to him, putting her basket down in\nthe middle of the dusty road.\n\n\"Then who can it be?\" said Brooke, giving her his hand to shake.\n\n\"But what do bring you here, Mr. Brooke? Goodness me, what will\nmissus say?\"\n\n\"I shall make that all straight. I'm going back to Exeter to-morrow.\"\nThen there were many questions and many answers. He was sojourning\nat Mrs. Crocket's, and had been there for the last two days. \"Dear,\ndear, dear,\" she said over and over again. \"Deary me, deary me!\" and\nthen she asked him whether it was \"all along of Miss Dorothy\" that he\nhad come. Of course, it was all along of Miss Dorothy. Brooke made no\nsecret about it. He had come down to see Dorothy's mother and sister,\nand to say a bit of his own mind about future affairs;--and to see\nthe beauties of the country. When he talked about the beauties of the\ncountry, Martha looked at him as the people of Lessboro' and Nuncombe\nPutney should have looked at Colonel Osborne, when he talked of\nthe church porch at Cockchaffington. \"Beauties of the country, Mr.\nBrooke;--you ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" said Martha.\n\n\"But I ain't,--the least in the world,\" said Brooke.\n\nThen Martha took up her basket, and went on to the cottage, which had\nbeen close in sight during their conversation in the road. She felt\nangry with Dorothy. In such matters a woman is always angry with the\nwoman,--who has probably been quite passive, and rarely with the man,\nwho is ever the real transgressor. Having a man down after her at\nNuncombe Putney! It had never struck Martha as very horrible that\nBrooke Burgess should fall in love with Dorothy in the city;--but\nthis meeting, in the remoteness of the country, out of sight even of\nthe village, was almost indecent; and all, too, with Miss Stanbury's\nwill just, as one might say, on the balance! Dorothy ought to have\nburied herself rather than have allowed Brooke to see her at Nuncombe\nPutney; and Dorothy's mother and Priscilla must be worse. She trudged\non, however, with her lamb, and soon found herself in the presence of\nthe three ladies.\n\n\"What,--Martha!\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Yes, miss,--here I am. I'd have been here half-an-hour ago amost, if\nI hadn't been stopped on the road.\"\n\n\"And who stopped you?\" asked Priscilla.\n\n\"Why,--Mr. Brooke, of course.\"\n\n\"And what did Mr. Brooke say to you?\" asked Dorothy.\n\nMartha perceived at once that Dorothy was quite radiant. She told her\nmistress that she had never seen Miss Dorothy look half so comely\nbefore. \"Laws, ma'am, she brightened up and speckled about, till it\ndid your heart good to see her in spite of all.\" But this was some\ntime afterwards.\n\n\"He didn't say very much,\" replied Martha, gravely.\n\n\"But I've got very much to tell you,\" continued Dorothy. \"I'm engaged\nto be married to Mr. Brooke, and you must congratulate me. It is\nsettled now, and mamma and my sister know all about it.\"\n\nMartha, when she was thus asked directly for congratulation, hardly\nknew at once how to express herself. Being fully aware of Miss\nStanbury's objection to the marriage, she could not venture to\nexpress her approbation of it. It was very improper, in Martha's\nmind, that any young woman should have a follower, when the \"missus\"\ndidn't approve of it. She understood well enough that, in that matter\nof followers, privileges are allowed to young ladies which are not\naccorded to maid servants. A young lady may do things,--have young\nmen to walk and talk with them, to dance with them and embrace them,\nand perhaps even more than this,--when for half so much a young woman\nwould be turned into the streets without a character. Martha knew\nall this, and knew also that Miss Dorothy, though her mother lived\nin a very little cottage, was not altogether debarred, in the matter\nof followers, from the privileges of a lady. But yet Miss Dorothy's\nposition was so very peculiar! Look at that will,--or, rather, at\nthat embryo will, which might be made any day, which now probably\nwould be made, and which might affect them both so terribly! People\nwho have not got money should not fly in the face of those who have.\nSuch at least was Martha's opinion very strongly. How could she\ncongratulate Miss Dorothy under the existing circumstances? \"I do\nhope you will be happy, miss;--that you knows,\" said Martha, in her\ndifficulty. \"And now, ma'am;--miss, I mean,\" she added, correcting\nherself, in obedience to Miss Stanbury's direct orders about the\npresent,--\"missus has just sent me over with a bit of lamb, and a\nletter as is here in the basket, and to ask how you is,--and the\nother ladies.\"\n\n\"We are very much obliged,\" said Mrs. Stanbury, who had not\nunderstood the point of Martha's speech.\n\n\"My sister is, I'm sure,\" said Priscilla, who had understood it.\n\nDorothy had taken the letter, and had gone aside with it, and was\nreading it very carefully. It touched her nearly, and there had come\ntears into both her eyes, as she dwelt upon it. There was something\nin her aunt's allusion to the condition of unmarried women which came\nhome to her especially. She knew her aunt's past history, and now she\nknew, or hoped that she knew, something of her own future destiny.\nHer aunt was desolate, whereas upon her the world smiled most\nbenignly. Brooke had just informed her that he intended to make\nher his wife as speedily as possible,--with her aunt's consent if\npossible, but if not, then without it. He had ridiculed the idea of\nhis being stopped by Miss Stanbury's threats, and had said all this\nin such fashion that even Priscilla herself had only listened and\nobeyed. He had spoken not a word of his own income, and none of them\nhad dreamed even of asking him a question. He had been as a god in\nthe little cottage, and all of them had been ready to fall down\nand worship him. Mrs. Stanbury had not known how to treat him\nwith sufficient deference, and, at the same time, with sufficient\naffection. He had kissed them all round, and Priscilla had felt an\nelation which was hardly intelligible to herself. Dorothy, who was so\nmuch honoured, had come to enjoy a status in her mother's estimation\nvery different from that which she had previously possessed, and had\ngrown to be quite beautiful in her mother's eyes.\n\nThere was once a family of three ancient maiden ladies, much\nrespected and loved in the town in which they lived. Their manners\nof life were well known among their friends, and excited no surprise;\nbut a stranger to the locality once asked of the elder why Miss\nMatilda, the younger, always went first out of the room? \"Matilda\nonce had an offer of marriage,\" said the dear simple old lady, who\nhad never been so graced, and who felt that such an episode in life\nwas quite sufficient to bestow brevet rank. It was believed by Mrs.\nStanbury that Dorothy's honours would be carried further than those\nof Miss Matilda, but there was much of the same feeling in the bosom\nof the mother towards the fortunate daughter, who, in the eyes of a\nman, had seemed goodly enough to be his wife.\n\nWith this swelling happiness round her heart, Dorothy read her aunt's\nletter, and was infinitely softened. \"I had gotten somehow to love\nto see your pretty face.\" Dorothy had thought little enough of her\nown beauty, but she liked being told by her aunt that her face had\nbeen found to be pretty. \"I am very desolate and solitary here,\" her\naunt said; and then had come those words about the state of maiden\nwomen;--and then those other words, about women's duties, and her\naunt's prayer on her behalf. \"Dear Dorothy, be not such an one.\"\nShe held the letter to her lips and to her bosom, and could hardly\ncontinue its perusal because of her tears. Such prayers from the aged\naddressed to the young are generally held in light esteem, but this\nadjuration was valued by the girl to whom it was addressed. She put\ntogether the invitation,--or rather the permission accorded to her,\nto make a visit to Exeter,--and the intimation in the postscript\nthat Martha knew her mistress's mind; and then she returned to the\nsitting-room, in which Martha was still seated with her mother, and\ntook the old servant apart. \"Martha,\" she said, \"is my aunt happy\nnow?\"\n\n\"Well,--miss.\"\n\n\"She is strong again; is she not?\"\n\n\"Sir Peter says she is getting well; and Mr. Martin--; but Mr. Martin\nisn't much account.\"\n\n\"She eats and drinks again?\"\n\n\"Pretty well;--not as it used to be, you know, miss. I tell her she\nought to go somewheres,--but she don't like moving nohow. She never\ndid. I tell her if she'd go to Dawlish,--just for a week. But she\ndon't think there's a bed fit to sleep on, nowhere, except just her\nown.\"\n\n\"She would go if Sir Peter told her.\"\n\n\"She says that these movings are newfangled fashions, and that the\nair didn't use to want changing for folk when she was young. I heard\nher tell Sir Peter herself, that if she couldn't live at Exeter,\nshe would die there. She won't go nowheres, Miss Dorothy. She ain't\ncareful to live.\"\n\n\"Tell me something, Martha; will you?\"\n\n\"What is it, Miss Dorothy?\"\n\n\"Be a dear good woman now, and tell me true. Would she be better if I\nwere with her?\"\n\n\"She don't like being alone, miss. I don't know nobody as does.\"\n\n\"But now, about Mr. Brooke, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Brooke! That's it.\"\n\n\"Of course, Martha, I love him better than anything in all the world.\nI can't tell you how it was, but I think I loved him the very first\nmoment I saw him.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear!\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it, Martha;--but it's no good talking about it, for\nof course I shan't try to help it now. Only this,--that I would do\nanything in the world for my aunt,--except that.\"\n\n\"But she don't like it, Miss Dorothy. That is the truth, you know.\"\n\n\"It can't be helped now, Martha; and of course she'll be told at\nonce. Shall I go and tell her? I'd go to-day if you think she would\nlike it.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Brooke?\"\n\n\"He is to go to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And will you leave him here?\"\n\n\"Why not? Nobody will hurt him. I don't mind a bit about having him\nwith me now. But I can tell you this. When he went away from us once\nit made me very unhappy. Would Aunt Stanbury be glad to see me,\nMartha?\"\n\nMartha's reserve was at last broken down, and she expressed herself\nin strong language. There was nothing on earth her mistress wanted so\nmuch as to have her favourite niece back again. Martha acknowledged\nthat there were great difficulties about Brooke Burgess, and she did\nnot see her way clearly through them. Dorothy declared her purpose of\ntelling her aunt boldly,--at once. Martha shook her head, admiring\nthe honesty and courage, but doubting the result. She understood\nbetter than did any one else the peculiarity of mind which made her\nmistress specially anxious that none of the Stanbury family should\nenjoy any portion of the Burgess money, beyond that which she herself\nhad saved out of the income. There had been moments in which Martha\nhad hoped that this prejudice might be overcome in favour of Hugh;\nbut it had become stronger as the old woman grew to be older and\nmore feeble,--and it was believed now to be settled as Fate. \"She'd\nsooner give it all to old Barty over the way,\" Martha had once said,\n\"than let it go to her own kith and kin. And if she do hate any human\ncreature, she do hate Barty Burgess.\" She assented, however, to\nDorothy's proposal; and, though Mrs. Stanbury and Priscilla were\nastounded by the precipitancy of the measure they did not attempt to\noppose it.\n\n\"And what am I to do?\" said Brooke, when he was told.\n\n\"You'll come to-morrow, of course,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"But it may be that the two of us together will be too many for the\ndear old lunatic.\"\n\n\"You shan't call her a lunatic, Brooke. She isn't so much a lunatic\nas you are, to run counter to her, and disobey her, and all that kind\nof thing.\"\n\n\"And how about yourself?\"\n\n\"How can I help it, Brooke? It is you that say it must be so.\"\n\n\"Of course it must. Who is to be stayed from doing what is reasonable\nbecause an old woman has a bee on her bonnet. I don't believe in\npeople's wills.\"\n\n\"She can do what she likes about it, Brooke.\"\n\n\"Of course she can, and of course she will. What I mean is that it\nnever pays to do this or that because somebody may alter his will, or\nmay make a will, or may not make a will. You become a slave for life,\nand then your dead tyrant leaves you a mourning-ring, and grins at\nyou out of his grave. All the same she'll kick up a row, I fancy, and\nyou'll have to bear the worst of it.\"\n\n\"I'll tell her the truth; and if she be very angry, I'll just come\nhome again. But I think I'll come home to-morrow any way, so that\nI'll pass you on the road. That will be best. She won't want us both\ntogether. Only then, Brooke, I shan't see you again.\"\n\n\"Not till June.\"\n\n\"And is it to be really in June?\"\n\n\"You say you don't like May.\"\n\n\"You are such a goose, Brooke. It will be May almost to-morrow. I\nshall be such a poor wife for you, Brooke. As for getting my things\nready, I shall not bring hardly any things at all. Have you thought\nwhat it is to take a body so very poor?\"\n\n\"I own I haven't thought as much about it, Dolly,--as I ought to have\ndone, perhaps.\"\n\n\"It is too late now, Brooke.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is.\"\n\n\"Quite too late. A week ago I could have borne it. I had almost got\nmyself to think that it would be better that I should bear it. But\nyou have come, and banished all the virtue out of my head. I am\nashamed of myself, because I am so unworthy; but I would put up with\nthat shame rather than lose you now. Brooke, Brooke, I will so try to\nbe good to you!\"\n\nIn the afternoon Martha and Dorothy started together for Exeter,\nBrooke and Priscilla accompanying them as far as Mrs. Crocket's,\nwhere the Lessboro' fly was awaiting them. Dorothy said little or\nnothing during the walk, nor, indeed, was she very communicative\nduring the journey into Exeter. She was going to her aunt, instigated\nsimply by the affection of her full heart; but she was going with a\ntale in her mouth which she knew would be very unwelcome. She could\nnot save herself from feeling that, in having accepted Brooke, and in\nhaving not only accepted him but even fixed the day for her marriage,\nshe had been ungrateful to her aunt. Had it not been for her aunt's\nkindness and hospitality, she would never have seen Brooke Burgess.\nAnd as she had been under her aunt's care at Exeter, she doubted\nwhether she had not been guilty of some great fault in falling in\nlove with this man, in opposition as it were to express orders.\nShould her aunt still declare that she would in no way countenance\nthe marriage, that she would still oppose it and use her influence\nwith Brooke to break it off, then would Dorothy return on the morrow\nto her mother's cottage at Nuncombe Putney, so that her lover might\nbe free to act with her aunt as he might think fit. And should he\nyield, she would endeavour,--she would struggle hard, to think that\nhe was still acting for the best. \"I must tell her myself, Martha,\"\nsaid Dorothy, as they came near to Exeter.\n\n\"Certainly, miss;--only you'll do it to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes;--at once. As soon after I get there as possible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\nDOROTHY RETURNS TO EXETER.\n\n\nMiss Stanbury perfectly understood that Martha was to come back by\nthe train reaching Exeter at 7 p.m., and that she might be expected\nin the Close about a quarter-of-an-hour after that time. She had been\nnervous and anxious all day,--so much so that Mr. Martin had told\nher that she must be very careful. \"That's all very well,\" the old\nwoman had said, \"but you haven't got any medicine for my complaint,\nMr. Martin.\" The apothecary had assured her that the worst of her\ncomplaint was in the east wind, and had gone away begging her to be\nvery careful. \"It is not God's breezes that are hard to any one,\" the\nold lady had said to herself,--\"but our own hearts.\" After her lonely\ndinner she had fidgeted about the room, and had rung twice for the\ngirl, not knowing what order to give when the servant came to her.\nShe was very anxious about her tea, but would not have it brought to\nher till after Martha should have arrived. She was half-minded to\norder that a second cup and saucer should be placed there, but she\nhad not the courage to face the disappointment which would fall upon\nher, should the cup and saucer stand there for no purpose. And yet,\nshould she come, how nice it would be to shew her girl that her old\naunt had been ready for her. Thrice she went to the window after the\ncathedral clock had struck seven, to see whether her ambassador was\nreturning. From her window there was only one very short space of\npathway on which she could have seen her,--and, as it happened, there\ncame the ring at the door, and no ambassador had as yet been viewed.\nMiss Stanbury was immediately off her seat, and out upon the landing.\n\"Here we are again, Miss Dorothy,\" said Martha. Then Miss Stanbury\ncould not restrain herself,--but descended the stairs, moving as she\nhad never moved since she had first been ill. \"My bairn,\" she said;\n\"my dearest bairn! I thought that perhaps it might be so. Jane,\nanother tea-cup and saucer up-stairs.\" What a pity that she had not\nordered it before! \"And get a hot cake, Jane. You will be ever so\nhungry, my darling, after your journey.\"\n\n\"Are you glad to see me, Aunt Stanbury?\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"Glad, my pretty one!\" Then she put up her hands, and smoothed down\nthe girl's cheeks, and kissed her, and patted Martha on the back, and\nscolded her at the same time for not bringing Miss Dorothy from the\nstation in a cab. \"And what is the meaning of that little bag?\" she\nsaid. \"You shall go back for the rest yourself, Martha, because it is\nyour own fault.\" Martha knew that all this was pleasant enough;--but\nthen her mistress's moods would sometimes be changed so suddenly! How\nwould it be when Miss Stanbury knew that Brooke Burgess had been left\nbehind at Nuncombe Putney?\n\n\"You see I didn't stay to eat any of the lamb,\" said Dorothy,\nsmiling.\n\n\"You shall have a calf instead, my dear,\" said Miss Stanbury,\n\"because you are a returned prodigal.\"\n\nAll this was very pleasant, and Miss Stanbury was so happy dispensing\nher tea, and the hot cake, and the clotted cream, and was so intent\nupon her little methods of caressing and petting her niece, that\nDorothy had no heart to tell her story while the plates and cups were\nstill upon the table. She had not, perhaps, cared much for the hot\ncake, having such a weight upon her mind, but she had seemed to care,\nunderstanding well that she might so best conduce to her aunt's\ncomfort. Miss Stanbury was a woman who could not bear that the good\nthings which she had provided for a guest should not be enjoyed. She\ncould taste with a friend's palate, and drink with a friend's throat.\nBut when debarred these vicarious pleasures by what seemed to her to\nbe the caprice of her guests, she would be offended. It had been one\nof the original sins of Camilla and Arabella French that they would\ndeclare at her tea-table that they had dined late and could not eat\ntea-cake. Dorothy knew all this,--and did her duty;--but with a\nheavy heart. There was the story to be told, and she had promised\nMartha that it should be told to-night. She was quite aware, too,\nindependently of her promise, that it was necessary that it should\nbe told to-night. It was very sad,--very grievous that the dear old\nlady's happiness should be disturbed so soon; but it must be done.\nWhen the tea-things were being taken away her aunt was still purring\nround her, and saying gentle, loving words. Dorothy bore it as well\nas she could,--bore it well, smiling and kissing her aunt's hand, and\nuttering now and then some word of affection. But the thing had to be\ndone; and as soon as the room was quiet for a moment, she jumped up\nfrom her chair and began. \"Aunt Stanbury, I must tell you something\nat once. Who, do you think, is at Nuncombe Putney?\"\n\n\"Not Brooke Burgess?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is. He is there now, and is to be here with you to-morrow.\"\n\nThe whole colour and character of Miss Stanbury's face was changed in\na moment. She had been still purring up to the moment in which this\ncommunication had been made to her. Her gratification had come to her\nfrom the idea that her pet had come back to her from love of her,--as\nin very truth had been the case; but now it seemed that Dorothy had\nreturned to ask for a great favour for herself. And she reflected at\nonce that Brooke had passed through Exeter without seeing her. If\nhe was determined to marry without reference to her, he might at\nany rate have had the grace to come to her and say so. She, in the\nfulness of her heart, had written words of affection to Dorothy;--and\nboth Dorothy and Brooke had at once taken advantage of her\nexpressions for their own purposes. Such was her reading of the story\nof the day. \"He need not trouble himself to come here now,\" she said.\n\n\"Dear aunt, do not say that.\"\n\n\"I do say it. He need not trouble himself to come now. When I said\nthat I should be glad to see you, I did not intend that you should\nmeet Mr. Burgess under my roof. I did not wish to have you both\ntogether.\"\n\n\"How could I help coming, when you wrote to me like that?\"\n\n\"It is very well,--but he need not come. He knows the way from\nNuncombe to London without stopping at Exeter.\"\n\n\"Aunt Stanbury, you must let me tell it you all.\"\n\n\"There is no more to tell, I should think.\"\n\n\"But there is more. You knew what he thought about me, and what he\nwished.\"\n\n\"He is his own master, my dear;--and you are your own mistress.\"\n\n\"If you speak to me like that you will kill me, Aunt Stanbury. I did\nnot think of coming; only when Martha brought your dear letter I\ncould not help it. But he was coming. He meant to come to-morrow,\nand he will. Of course he must defend himself, if you are angry with\nhim.\"\n\n\"He need not defend himself at all.\"\n\n\"I told them, and I told him, that I would only stay one night,--if\nyou did not wish that we should be here together. You must see him,\nAunt Stanbury. You would not refuse to see him.\"\n\n\"If you please, my dear, you must allow me to judge whom I will see.\"\n\nAfter that the discussion ceased between them for awhile, and Miss\nStanbury left the room that she might hold a consultation with\nMartha. Dorothy went up to her chamber, and saw that everything had\nbeen prepared for her with most scrupulous care. Nothing could be\nwhiter, neater, cleaner, nicer than was everything that surrounded\nher. She had perceived while living under her aunt's roof, how,\ngradually, small, delicate feminine comforts had been increased for\nher. Martha had been told that Miss Dorothy ought to have this, and\nthat Miss Dorothy ought to have that; till at last she, who had\nhitherto known nothing of the small luxuries that come from an easy\nincome, had felt ashamed of the prettinesses that had been added to\nher. Now she could see at once that infinite care had been used to\nmake her room bright and smiling,--only in the hope that she would\nreturn. As soon as she saw it all, she sat down on her bed and burst\nout into tears. Was it not hard upon her that she should be forced\ninto such ingratitude! Every comfort prepared for her was a coal of\nhot fire upon her head. And yet what had she done that she ought not\nto have done? Was it unreasonable that she should have loved this\nman, when they two were brought together? And had she even dared to\nthink of him otherwise than as an acquaintance till he had compelled\nher to confess her love? And after that had she not tried to separate\nherself from him, so that they two,--her aunt and her lover,--might\nbe divided by no quarrel? Had not Priscilla told her that she was\nright in all that she was doing? Nevertheless, in spite of all this,\nshe could not refrain from accusing herself of ingratitude towards\nher aunt. And she began to think it would have been better for her\nnow to have remained at home, and have allowed Brooke to come alone\nto Exeter than to have obeyed the impulse which had arisen from the\nreceipt of her aunt's letter. When she went down again she found\nherself alone in the room, and she was beginning to think that it was\nintended that she should go to bed without again seeing her aunt;\nbut at last Miss Stanbury came to her, with a sad countenance, but\nwithout that look of wrath which Dorothy knew so well. \"My dear,\"\nshe said, \"it will be better that Mr. Burgess should go up to London\nto-morrow. I will see him, of course, if he chooses to come, and\nMartha shall meet him at the station and explain it. If you do not\nmind, I would prefer that you should not meet him here.\"\n\n\"I meant only to stay one night, aunt.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense. If I am to part with either of you, I will part\nwith him. You are dearer to me than he is. Dorothy, you do not know\nhow dear to me you are.\"\n\nDorothy immediately fell on her knees at her aunt's feet, and hid her\nface in her aunt's lap. Miss Stanbury twined round her fingers the\nsoft hair which she loved so well,--because it was a grace given by\nGod and not bought out of a shop,--and caressed the girl's head, and\nmuttered something that was intended for a prayer. \"If he will let\nme, aunt, I will give him up,\" said Dorothy, looking up into her\naunt's face. \"If he will say that I may, though I shall love him\nalways, he may go.\"\n\n\"He is his own master,\" said Miss Stanbury. \"Of course he is his own\nmaster.\"\n\n\"Will you let me return to-morrow,--just for a few days,--and then\nyou can talk to him as you please. I did not mean to come to stay. I\nwished him good-bye because I knew that I should not meet him here.\"\n\n\"You always talk of going away, Dorothy, as soon as ever you are in\nthe house. You are always threatening me.\"\n\n\"I will come again, the moment you tell me. If he goes in the\nmorning, I will be here the same evening. And I will write to him,\nAunt Stanbury, and tell him,--that he is--quite free,--quite\nfree,--quite free.\"\n\nMiss Stanbury made no reply to this, but sat, still playing with her\nniece's hair. \"I think I will go to bed,\" she said at last. \"It is\npast ten. You need not go to Nuncombe, Dorothy. Martha shall meet\nhim, and he can see me here. But I do not wish him to stay in the\nhouse. You can go over and call on Mrs. MacHugh. Mrs. MacHugh will\ntake it well of you that you should call on her.\" Dorothy made no\nfurther opposition to this arrangement, but kissed her aunt, and went\nto her chamber.\n\nHow was it all to be for her? For the last two days she had been\nradiant with new happiness. Everything had seemed to be settled. Her\nlover, in his high-handed way, had declared that in no important\ncrisis of life would he allow himself to be driven out of his way\nby the fear of what an old woman might do in her will. When Dorothy\nassured him that not for worlds would she, though she loved him\ndearly, injure his material prospects, he had thrown it all aside,\nafter a grand fashion, that had really made the girl think that\nall Miss Stanbury's money was as nothing to his love for her. She\nand Priscilla and her mother had been carried away so entirely by\nBrooke's oratory as to feel for the time that the difficulties were\nentirely conquered. But now the aspect of things was so different!\nWhatever Brooke might owe to Miss Stanbury, she, Dorothy, owed her\naunt everything. She would immolate herself,--if Brooke would only\nlet her. She did not quite understand her aunt's stubborn opposition;\nbut she knew that there was some great cause for her aunt's feeling\non the matter. There had been a promise made, or an oath sworn, that\nthe property of the Burgess family should not go into the hands of\nany Stanbury. Dorothy told herself that, were she married, she would\nbe a Stanbury no longer;--that her aunt would still comply with the\nobligation she had fixed for herself; but, nevertheless, she was\nready to believe that her aunt might be right. Her aunt had always\ndeclared that it should be so; and Dorothy, knowing this, confessed\nto herself that she should have kept her heart under better control.\nThinking of these things, she went to the table, where paper and ink\nand pens had all been prepared for her so prettily, and began her\nletter to Brooke. \"Dearest, dearest Brooke.\" But then she thought\nthat this was not a fair keeping of her promise, and she began again.\n\"My dear Brooke.\" The letter, however, did not get itself written\nthat night. It was almost impossible for her to write it. \"I think it\nwill be better for you,\" she had tried to say, \"to be guided by my\naunt.\" But how could she say this when she did not believe it? It was\nher wish to make him understand that she would never think ill of\nhim, for a moment, if he would make up his mind to abandon her;--but\nshe could not find the words to express herself,--and she went, at\nlast, to bed, leaving the half-covered paper upon the table.\n\nShe went to bed, and cried herself to sleep. It had been so sweet\nto have a lover,--a man of her own, to whom she could say what she\npleased, from whom she had a right to ask for counsel and protection,\na man who delighted to be near her, and to make much of her. In\ncomparison with her old mode of living, her old ideas of life, her\nlife with such a lover was passed in an elysium. She had entered from\nbarren lands into so rich a paradise! But there is no paradise, as\nshe now found, without apples which must be eaten, and which lead\nto sorrow. She regretted in this hour that she had ever seen Brooke\nBurgess. After all, with her aunt's love and care for her, with\nher mother and sister near her, with the respect of those who knew\nher, why should the lands have been barren, even had there been no\nentrance for her into that elysium? And did it not all result in\nthis,--that the elysium to be desired should not be here; that the\nparadise, without the apples, must be waited for till beyond the\ngrave? It is when things go badly with us here, and for most of us\nonly then, that we think that we can see through the dark clouds into\nthe joys of heaven. But at last she slept, and in her dreams Brooke\nwas sitting with her in Niddon Park with his arm tight clasped round\nher waist.\n\nShe slept so soundly, that when a step crept silently into her room,\nand when a light was held for awhile over her face, neither the step\nnor the light awakened her. She was lying with her head back upon the\npillow, and her arm hung by the bedside, and her lips were open, and\nher loose hair was spread upon the pillow. The person who stood there\nwith the light thought that there never had been a fairer sight.\nEverything there was so pure, so sweet, so good! She was one whose\nonly selfish happiness could come to her from the belief that others\nloved her. The step had been very soft, and even the breath of the\nintruder was not allowed to pass heavily into the air, but the light\nof the candle shone upon the eyelids of the sleeper, and she moved\nher head restlessly on the pillow. \"Dorothy, are you awake? Can you\nspeak to me?\"\n\nThen the disturbed girl gradually opened her eyes and gazed upwards,\nand raised herself in her bed, and sat wondering. \"Is anything the\nmatter, aunt?\" she said.\n\n\"Only the vagaries of an old woman, my pet,--of an old woman who\ncannot sleep in her bed.\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"Only the vagaries of an old woman.\"]\n\n\n\"But what is it, aunt?\"\n\n\"Kiss me, dearest.\" Then with something of slumber still about her,\nDorothy raised herself in her bed, and placed her arm on her aunt's\nshoulder and embraced her. \"And now for my news,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"What news, aunt? It isn't morning yet; is it?\"\n\n\"No;--it is not morning. You shall sleep again presently. I have\nthought of it, and you shall be Brooke's wife, and I will have it\nhere, and we will all be friends.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"You will like that;--will you not?\"\n\n\"And you will not quarrel with him? What am I to say? What am I to\ndo?\" She was, in truth, awake now, and, not knowing what she did, she\njumped out of bed, and stood holding her aunt by the arm.\n\n\"It is not a dream,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"Are you sure that it is not a dream? And may he come here\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"Of course he will come to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And may I see him, Aunt Stanbury?\"\n\n\"Not if you go home, my dear.\"\n\n\"But I won't go home. And will you tell him? Oh dear, oh dear! Aunt\nStanbury, I do not think that I believe it yet.\"\n\n\"You will catch cold, my dear, if you stay there trying to believe\nit. You have nothing on. Get into bed and believe it there. You will\nhave time to think of it before the morning.\" Then Miss Stanbury went\nback to her own chamber, and Dorothy was left alone to realise her\nbliss.\n\nShe thought of all her life for the last twelve months,--of the\nfirst invitation to Exeter, and the doubts of the family as to\nits acceptance, of her arrival and of her own doubts as to the\npossibility of her remaining, of Mr. Gibson's courtship and her\naunt's disappointment, of Brooke's coming, of her love and of\nhis,--and then of her departure back to Nuncombe. After that had come\nthe triumph of Brooke's visit, and then the terrible sadness of her\naunt's displeasure. But now everything was good and glorious. She\ndid not care for money herself. She thought that she never could\ncare much for being rich. But had she made Brooke poor by marrying\nhim, that must always have been to her matter of regret, if not of\nremorse. But now it was all to be smooth and sweet. Now a paradise\nwas to be opened to her, with no apples which she might not eat;--no\napples which might not, but still must, be eaten. She thought that it\nwould be impossible that she should sleep again that night; but she\ndid sleep, and dreamed that Brooke was holding her in Niddon Park,\ntighter than ever.\n\nWhen the morning came she trembled as she walked down into the\nparlour. Might it not still be possible that it was all a dream? Or\nwhat if her aunt should again have changed her purpose? But the first\nmoment of her aunt's presence told her that there was nothing to\nfear. \"How did you sleep, Dorothy?\" said the old lady.\n\n\"Dear aunt, I do not know. Was it all sleep?\"\n\n\"What shall we say to Brooke when he comes?\"\n\n\"You shall tell him.\"\n\n\"No, dearest, you must tell him. And you must say to him that if he\nis not good to my girl, and does not love her always, and cling to\nher, and keep her from harm, and be in truth her loving husband, I\nwill hold him to be the most ungrateful of human beings.\" And before\nBrooke came, she spoke again. \"I wonder whether he thinks you as\npretty as I do, Dolly?\"\n\n\"He never said that he thought me pretty at all.\"\n\n\"Did he not? Then he shall say so, or he shall not have you. It was\nyour looks won me first, Dolly,--like an old fool as I am. It is so\npleasant to have a little nature after such a deal of artifice.\" In\nwhich latter remarks it was quite understood that Miss Stanbury was\nalluding to her enemies at Heavitree.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\nTHE LIONESS AROUSED.\n\n\nBrooke Burgess had been to Exeter and had gone,--for he only remained\nthere one night,--and everything was apparently settled. It was not\nexactly told through Exeter that Miss Stanbury's heir was to be\nallowed to marry Miss Stanbury's niece; but Martha knew it, and Giles\nHickbody guessed it, and Dorothy was allowed to tell her mother and\nsister, and Brooke himself, in his own careless way, had mentioned\nthe matter to his uncle Barty. As Miss Stanbury had also told the\nsecret in confidence to Mrs. MacHugh, it cannot be said that it was\naltogether well kept. Four days after Brooke's departure the news\nreached the Frenches at Heavitree. It was whispered to Camilla by\none of the shopmen with whom she was still arranging her marriage\ntrousseau, and was repeated by her to her mother and sister with some\nadditions which were not intended to be good-natured. \"He gets her\nand the money together as a bargain--of course,\" said Camilla. \"I\nonly hope the money won't be found too dear.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he won't get it after all,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"That would be cruel,\" replied Camilla. \"I don't think that even Miss\nStanbury is so false as that.\"\n\nThings were going very badly at Heavitree. There was war there,\nalmost everlastingly, though such little playful conversations as the\nabove shewed that there might be an occasional lull in the battle.\nMr. Gibson was not doing his duty. That was clear enough. Even Mrs.\nFrench, when she was appealed to with almost frantic energy by her\nyounger daughter, could not but acknowledge that he was very remiss\nas a lover. And Camilla, in her fury, was very imprudent. That very\nfrantic energy which induced her to appeal to her mother was, in\nitself, proof of her imprudence. She knew that she was foolish, but\nshe could not control her passion. Twice had she detected Arabella in\nreceiving notes from Mr. Gibson, which she did not see, and of which\nit had been intended that she should know nothing. And once, when\nshe spent a night away at Ottery St. Mary with a friend,--a visit\nwhich was specially prefatory to marriage, and made in reference to\nbridesmaids' dresses,--Arabella had had,--so at least Camilla was\nmade to believe,--a secret meeting with Mr. Gibson in some of the\nlanes which lead down from Heavitree to the Topsham road.\n\n\"I happened to meet him, and spoke two words to him,\" said Arabella.\n\"Would you have me cut him?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Bella;--if there is any underhand game\ngoing on that I don't understand, all Exeter shall be on fire before\nyou shall carry it out.\"\n\nBella made no answer to this, but shrugged her shoulders. Camilla\nwas almost at a loss to guess what might be the truth. Would not any\nsister, so accused on such an occasion, rebut the accusation with\nawful wrath? But Arabella simply shrugged her shoulders, and went her\nway. It was now the 15th of April, and there wanted but one short\nfortnight to their marriage. The man had not the courage to jilt\nher! She felt sure that he had not heart enough to do a deed of such\naudacity. And her sister, too, was weak and a coward, and would\nlack the power to stand on her legs and declare herself to be the\nperpetrator of such villany. Her mother, as she knew well, would\nalways have preferred that her elder daughter should be the bride;\nbut her mother was not the woman to have the hardihood, now, in\nthe eleventh hour, to favour such an intrigue. Let her wish be\nwhat it might, she would not be strong enough to carry through the\naccomplishment of it. They would all know that that threat of hers\nof setting Exeter on fire would be carried out after some fashion\nthat would not be inadequate to the occasion. A sister, a mother, a\npromised lover, all false,--all so damnably, cruelly false! It was\nimpossible. No history, no novel of most sensational interest, no\nwonderful villany that had ever been wrought into prose or poetry,\nwould have been equal to this. It was impossible. She told herself so\na score of times a day. And yet the circumstances were so terribly\nsuspicious! Mr. Gibson's conduct as a lover was simply disgraceful\nto him as a man and a clergyman. He was full of excuses, which she\nknew to be false. He would never come near her if he could help it.\nWhen he was with her, he was as cold as an archbishop both in word\nand in action. Nothing would tempt him to any outward manifestation\nof affection. He would talk of nothing but the poor women of St.\nPeter-cum-Pumpkin in the city, and the fraudulent idleness of a\ncertain colleague in the cathedral services, who was always shirking\nhis work. He made her no presents. He never walked with her. He was\nalways gloomy,--and he had indeed so behaved himself in public that\npeople were beginning to talk of \"poor Mr. Gibson.\" And yet he could\nmeet Arabella on the sly in the lanes, and send notes to her by the\ngreen-grocer's boy! Poor Mr. Gibson indeed! Let her once get him\nwell over the 29th of April, and the people of Exeter might talk\nabout poor Mr. Gibson if they pleased. And Bella's conduct was more\nwonderful almost than that of Mr. Gibson. With all her cowardice, she\nstill held up her head,--held it perhaps a little higher than was\nusual with her. And when that grievous accusation was made against\nher,--made and repeated,--an accusation the very thought and sound\nof which would almost have annihilated her had there been a decent\nfeeling in her bosom, she would simply shrug her shoulders and walk\naway. \"Camilla,\" she had once said, \"you will drive that man mad\nbefore you have done.\" \"What is it to you how I drive him?\" Camilla\nhad answered in her fury. Then Arabella had again shrugged her\nshoulders and walked away. Between Camilla and her mother, too, there\nhad come to be an almost internecine quarrel on a collateral point.\nCamilla was still carrying on a vast arrangement which she called the\npreparation of her trousseau, but which both Mrs. French and Bella\nregarded as a spoliation of the domestic nest, for the proud purposes\nof one of the younger birds. And this had grown so fearfully that\nin two different places Mrs. French had found herself compelled to\nrequest that no further articles might be supplied to Miss Camilla.\nThe bride elect had rebelled, alleging that as no fortune was to be\nprovided for her, she had a right to take with her such things as she\ncould carry away in her trunks and boxes. Money could be had at the\nbank, she said; and, after all, what were fifty pounds more or less\non such an occasion as this? And then she went into a calculation to\nprove that her mother and sister would be made so much richer by her\nabsence, and that she was doing so much for them by her marriage,\nthat nothing could be more mean in them than that they should\nhesitate to supply her with such things as she desired to make her\nentrance into Mr. Gibson's house respectable. But Mrs. French was\nobdurate, and Mr. Gibson was desired to speak to her. Mr. Gibson, in\nfear and trembling, told her that she ought to repress her spirit of\nextravagance, and Camilla at once foresaw that he would avail himself\nof this plea against her should he find it possible at any time to\navail himself of any plea. She became ferocious, and, turning upon\nhim, told him to mind his own business. Was it not all for him that\nshe was doing it? \"She was not,\" she said, \"disposed to submit to any\ncontrol in such matters from him till he had assumed his legal right\nto it by standing with her before the altar.\" It came, however, to\nbe known all over Exeter that Miss Camilla's expenditure had been\nchecked, and that, in spite of the joys naturally incidental to a\nwedding, things were not going well with the ladies at Heavitree.\n\nAt last the blow came. Camilla was aware that on a certain morning\nher mother had been to Mr. Gibson's house, and had held a long\nconference with him. She could learn nothing of what took place\nthere, for at that moment she had taken upon herself to place herself\non non-speaking terms with her mother in consequence of those\ndisgraceful orders which had been given to the tradesmen. But Bella\nhad not been at Mr. Gibson's house at the time, and Camilla, though\nshe presumed that her own conduct had been discussed in a manner very\ninjurious to herself, did not believe that any step was being then\narranged which would be positively antagonistic to her own views. The\nday fixed was now so very near, that there could, she felt, be no\nescape for the victim. But she was wrong.\n\nMr. Gibson had been found by Mrs. French in a very excited state on\nthat occasion. He had wept, and pulled his hair, and torn open his\nwaistcoat, had spoken of himself as a wretch,--pleading, however,\nat the same time, that he was more sinned against than sinning, had\npaced about the room with his hands dashing against his brows, and\nat last had flung himself prostrate on the ground. The meaning of it\nall was, that he had tried very hard, and had found at last that \"he\ncouldn't do it.\" \"I am ready to submit,\" said he, \"to any verdict\nthat you may pronounce against me, but I should deceive you and\ndeceive her if I didn't say at once that I can't do it.\" He went on\nto explain that since he had unfortunately entered into his present\nengagement with Camilla,--of whose position he spoke in quite a\ntouching manner,--and since he had found what was the condition of\nhis own heart and feelings he had consulted a friend,--who, if any\nmerely human being was capable of advising, might be implicitly\ntrusted for advice in such a matter,--and that his friend had told\nhim that he was bound to give up the marriage let the consequences\nto himself or to others be what they might. \"Although the skies\nshould fall on me, I cannot stand at the hymeneal altar with a lie\nin my mouth,\" said Mr. Gibson immediately upon his rising from his\nprostrate condition on the floor. In such a position as this a\nmother's fury would surely be very great! But Mrs. French was hardly\nfurious. She cried, and begged him to think better of it, and assured\nhim that Camilla, when she should be calmed down by matrimony, would\nnot be so bad as she seemed;--but she was not furious. \"The truth\nis, Mr. Gibson,\" she said through her tears, \"that, after all, you\nlike Bella best.\" Mr. Gibson owned that he did like Bella best,\nand although no bargain was made between them then and there,--and\nsuch making of a bargain then and there would hardly have been\npracticable,--it was understood that Mrs. French would not proceed to\nextremities if Mr. Gibson would still make himself forthcoming as a\nhusband for the advantage of one of the daughters of the family.\n\nSo far Mr. Gibson had progressed towards a partial liberation from\nhis thraldom with a considerable amount of courage; but he was well\naware that the great act of daring still remained to be done. He\nhad suggested to Mrs. French that she should settle the matter with\nCamilla,--but this Mrs. French had altogether declined to do. It\nmust, she said, come from himself. If she were to do it, she must\nsympathise with her child; and such sympathy would be obstructive\nof the future arrangements which were still to be made. \"She always\nknew that I liked Bella best,\" said Mr. Gibson,--still sobbing, still\ntearing his hair, still pacing the room with his waistcoat torn open.\n\"I would not advise you to tell her that,\" said Mrs. French. Then\nMrs. French went home, and early on the following morning it was\nthought good by Arabella that she also should pay a visit at Ottery\nSt. Mary's. \"Good-bye, Cammy,\" said Arabella as she went. \"Bella,\"\nsaid Camilla, \"I wonder whether you are a serpent. I do not think\nyou can be so base a serpent as that.\" \"I declare, Cammy, you do say\nsuch odd things that no one can understand what you mean.\" And so she\nwent.\n\nOn that morning Mr. Gibson was walking at an early hour along the\nroad from Exeter to Cowley, contemplating his position and striving\nto arrange his plans. What was he to do, and how was he to do it? He\nwas prepared to throw up his living, to abandon the cathedral, to\nleave the diocese,--to make any sacrifice rather than take Camilla\nto his bosom. Within the last six weeks he had learned to regard her\nwith almost a holy horror. He could not understand by what miracle\nof self-neglect he had fallen into so perilous an abyss. He had long\nknown Camilla's temper. But in those days in which he had been beaten\nlike a shuttlecock between the Stanburys and the Frenches, he had\nlost his head and had done,--he knew not what. \"Those whom the God\nchooses to destroy, he first maddens,\" said Mr. Gibson to himself\nof himself, throwing himself back upon early erudition and pagan\nphilosophy. Then he looked across to the river Exe, and thought that\nthere was hardly water enough there to cover the multiplicity of his\nsorrows.\n\nBut something must be done. He had proceeded so far in forming a\nresolution, as he reached St. David's Church on his return homewards.\nHis sagacious friend had told him that as soon as he had altered\nhis mind, he was bound to let the lady know of it without delay.\n\"You must remember,\" said the sagacious friend, \"that you will owe\nher much,--very much.\" Mr. Gibson was perplexed in his mind when he\nreflected how much he might possibly be made to owe her if she should\ndecide on appealing to a jury of her countrymen for justice. But\nanything would be better than his home at St. Peter's-cum-Pumpkin\nwith Camilla sitting opposite to him as his wife. Were there not\ndistant lands in which a clergyman, unfortunate but still energetic,\nmight find work to do? Was there not all America?--and were there\nnot Australia, New Zealand, Natal, all open to him? Would not a\nmissionary career among the Chinese be better for him than St.\nPeter's-cum-Pumpkin with Camilla French for his wife? By the time he\nhad reached home his mind was made up. He would write a letter to\nCamilla at once; and he would marry Arabella at once,--on any day\nthat might be fixed,--on condition that Camilla would submit to her\ndefeat without legal redress. If legal redress should be demanded, he\nwould put in evidence the fact that her own mother had been compelled\nto caution the tradesmen of the city in regard to her extravagance.\n\nHe did write his letter,--in an agony of spirit. \"I sit down,\nCamilla, with a sad heart and a reluctant hand,\" he said,\n\n\n   to communicate to you a fatal truth. But truth should be\n   made to prevail, and there is nothing in man so cowardly,\n   so detrimental, and so unmanly as its concealment. I have\n   looked into myself, and have inquired of myself, and have\n   assured myself, that were I to become your husband, I\n   should not make you happy. It would be of no use for me\n   now to dilate on the reasons which have convinced me;--but\n   I am convinced, and I consider it my duty to inform you so\n   at once. I have been closeted with your mother, and have\n   made her understand that it is so.\n\n   I have not a word to say in my own justification but\n   this,--that I am sure I am acting honestly in telling you\n   the truth. I would not wish to say a word animadverting\n   on yourself. If there must be blame in this matter, I am\n   willing to take it all on my own shoulders. But things\n   have been done of late, and words have been spoken, and\n   habits have displayed themselves, which would not, I am\n   sure, conduce to our mutual comfort in this world, or to\n   our assistance to each other in our struggles to reach the\n   happiness of the world to come.\n\n   I think that you will agree with me, Camilla, that when\n   a man or a woman has fallen into such a mistake as\n   that which I have now made, it is best that it should\n   be acknowledged. I know well that such a change of\n   arrangements as that which I now propose will be regarded\n   most unfavourably. But will not anything be better than\n   the binding of a matrimonial knot which cannot be again\n   unloosed, and which we should both regret?\n\n   I do not know that I need add anything further. What can\n   I add further? Only this;--that I am inflexible. Having\n   resolved to take this step,--and to bear the evil things\n   that may be said of me,--for your happiness and for my own\n   tranquility,--I shall not now relinquish my resolution. I\n   do not ask you to forgive me. I doubt much whether I shall\n   ever be quite able to forgive myself. The mistake which\n   I have made is one which should not have been committed.\n   I do not ask you to forgive me; but I do ask you to pray\n   that I may be forgiven.\n\n   Yours, with feelings of the truest friendship,\n\n   THOMAS GIBSON.\n\n\nThe letter had been very difficult, but he was rather proud of it\nthan otherwise when it was completed. He had felt that he was writing\na letter which not improbably might become public property. It was\nnecessary that he should be firm, that he should accuse himself a\nlittle in order that he might excuse himself much, and that he should\nhint at causes which might justify the rupture, though he should\nso veil them as not to appear to defend his own delinquency by\nungenerous counter-accusation. When he had completed the letter,\nhe thought that he had done all this rather well, and he sent the\ndespatch off to Heavitree by the clerk of St. Peter's Church, with\nsomething of that feeling of expressible relief which attends the\nfinal conquest over some fatal and all but insuperable misfortune. He\nthought that he was sure now that he would not have to marry Camilla\non the 29th of the month,--and there would probably be a period of\nsome hours before he would be called upon to hear or read Camilla's\nreply.\n\nCamilla was alone when she received the letter, but she rushed at\nonce to her mother. \"There,\" said she; \"there--I knew that it was\ncoming!\" Mrs. French took the paper into her hands, and gasped, and\ngazed at her daughter without speaking. \"You knew of it, mother.\"\n\n\"Yesterday,--when he told me, I knew of it.\"\n\n\"And Bella knows it.\"\n\n\"Not a word of it.\"\n\n\"She does. I am sure she does. But it is all nothing. I will not\naccept it. He cannot treat me so. I will drag him there;--but he\nshall come.\"\n\n\"You can't make him, my dear.\"\n\n\"I will make him. And you would help me, mamma, if you had any\nspirit. What,--a fortnight before the time, when the things are all\nbought! Look at the presents that have been sent! Mamma, he doesn't\nknow me. And he never would have done it, if it had not been for\nBella,--never. She had better take care, or there shall be such a\ntragedy that nobody ever heard the like. If she thinks that she is\ngoing to be that man's wife,--she is--mistaken.\" Then there was a\npause for a moment. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"I shall go to him at once.\nI do not care in the least what anybody may say. I shall--go to\nhim,--at once.\" Mrs. French felt that at this moment it was best that\nshe should be silent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV.\n\nTHE ROWLEYS GO OVER THE ALPS.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nBy the thirteenth of May the Rowley family had established itself in\nFlorence, purposing to remain either there or at the baths of Lucca\ntill the end of June, at which time it was thought that Sir Marmaduke\nshould begin to make preparations for his journey back to the\nIslands. Their future prospects were not altogether settled. It was\nnot decided whether Lady Rowley should at once return with him,\nwhether Mrs. Trevelyan should return with him,--nor was it settled\namong them what should be the fate of Nora Rowley. Nora Rowley was\nquite resolved herself that she would not go back to the Islands, and\nhad said as much to her mother. Lady Rowley had not repeated this\nto Sir Marmaduke, and was herself in doubt as to what might best be\ndone. Girls are understood by their mothers better than they are by\ntheir fathers. Lady Rowley was beginning to be aware that Nora's\nobstinacy was too strong to be overcome by mere words, and that other\nsteps must be taken if she were to be weaned from her pernicious\npassion for Hugh Stanbury. Mr. Glascock was still in Florence. Might\nshe not be cured by further overtures from Mr. Glascock? The chance\nof securing such a son-in-law was so important, so valuable, that no\ntrouble was too great to be incurred, even though the probability of\nsuccess might not be great.\n\nIt must not, however, be supposed that Lady Rowley carried off all\nthe family to Italy, including Sir Marmaduke, simply in chase of\nMr. Glascock. Anxious as she was on the subject, she was too proud,\nand also too well-conditioned, to have suggested to herself such a\njourney with such an object. Trevelyan had escaped from Willesden\nwith the child, and they had heard,--again through Stanbury,--that\nhe had returned to Italy. They had all agreed that it would be well\nthat they should leave London for awhile, and see something of\nthe Continent; and when it was told to them that little Louis was\nprobably in Florence, that alone was reason enough for them to go\nthither. They would go to the city till the heat was too great and\nthe mosquitoes too powerful, and then they would visit the baths\nof Lucca for a month. This was their plan of action, and the cause\nfor their plan; but Lady Rowley found herself able to weave into it\nanother little plan of her own of which she said nothing to anybody.\nShe was not running after Mr. Glascock; but if Mr. Glascock should\nchoose to run after them,--or her, who could say that any harm had\nbeen done?\n\nNora had answered that proposition of her lover's to walk out of the\nhouse in Manchester Street, and get married at the next church, in a\nmost discreet manner. She had declared that she would be true and\nfirm, but that she did not wish to draw upon herself the displeasure\nof her father and mother. She did not, she said, look upon a\nclandestine marriage as a happy resource. But,--this she added at the\nend of a long and very sensible letter,--she intended to abide by her\nengagement, and she did not intend to go back to the Mandarins. She\ndid not say what alternative she would choose in the event of her\nbeing unable to obtain her father's consent before his return. She\ndid not suggest what was to become of her when Sir Marmaduke's leave\nof absence should be expired. But her statement that she would not go\nback to the islands was certainly made with more substantial vigour,\nthough, perhaps, with less of reasoning, than any other of the\npropositions made in her letter. Then, in her postscript, she told\nhim that they were all going to Italy. \"Papa and mamma think that we\nought to follow poor Mr. Trevelyan. The lawyer says that nothing can\nbe done while he is away with the boy. We are therefore all going to\nstart to Florence. The journey is delightful. I will not say whose\npresence will be wanting to make it perfect.\"\n\nBefore they started there came a letter to Nora from Dorothy, which\nshall be given entire, because it will tell the reader more of\nDorothy's happiness than would be learned from any other mode of\nnarrative.\n\n\n   The Close, Thursday.\n\n   DEAREST NORA,\n\n   I have just had a letter from Hugh, and that makes me feel\n   that I should like to write to you. Dear Hugh has told me\n   all about it, and I do so hope that things may come right\n   and that we may be sisters. He is so good that I do not\n   wonder that you should love him. He has been the best son\n   and the best brother in the world, and everybody speaks\n   well of him,--except my dear aunt, who is prejudiced\n   because she does not like newspapers. I need not praise\n   him to you, for I dare say you think quite as well of him\n   as I do. I cannot tell you all the beautiful things he\n   says about you, but I dare say he has told them to you\n   himself.\n\n   I seem to know you so well because Priscilla has talked\n   about you so often. She says that she knew that you and\n   my brother were fond of each other because you growled at\n   each other when you were together at the Clock House, and\n   never had any civil words to say before people. I don't\n   know whether growling is a sign of love, but Hugh does\n   growl sometimes when he is most affectionate. He growls at\n   me, and I understand him, and I like to be growled at. I\n   wonder whether you like him to growl at you.\n\n   And now I must tell you something about myself,--because\n   if you are to be my sister you ought to know it all. I\n   also am going to be married to a man whom I love,--oh, so\n   dearly! His name is Mr. Brooke Burgess, and he is a great\n   friend of my aunt's. At first she did not like our being\n   engaged, because of some family reason;--but she has got\n   over that, and nothing can be kinder and nicer than she\n   is. We are to be married here, some day in June,--the 11th\n   I think it will be. How I do wish you could have been here\n   to be my bridesmaid. It would have been so nice to have\n   had Hugh's sweetheart with me. He is a friend of Hugh's,\n   and no doubt you will hear all about him. The worst of it\n   is that we must live in London, because my husband as will\n   be,--you see I call him mine already,--is in an office\n   there. And so poor Aunt Stanbury will be left all alone.\n   It will be very sad, and she is so wedded to Exeter that I\n   fear we shall not get her up to London.\n\n   I would describe Mr. Burgess to you, only I do not suppose\n   you would care to hear about him. He is not so tall as\n   Hugh, but he is a great deal better looking. With you two\n   the good looks are to be with the wife; but, with us, with\n   the husband. Perhaps you think Hugh is handsome. We used\n   to declare that he was the ugliest boy in the country.\n   I don't suppose it makes very much difference. Brooke is\n   handsome, but I don't think I should like him the less if\n   he were ever so ugly.\n\n   Do you remember hearing about the Miss Frenches when you\n   were in Devonshire? There has come up such a terrible\n   affair about them. A Mr. Gibson, a clergyman, was going to\n   marry the younger; but has changed his mind and wants to\n   take the elder. I think he was in love with her first.\n\n\nDorothy did not say a word about the little intermediate stage of\nattachment to herself.\n\n\n   All this is making a great noise in the city, and some\n   people think he should be punished severely. It seems to\n   me that a gentleman ought not to make such a mistake; but\n   if he does, he ought to own it. I hope they will let him\n   marry the elder one. Aunt Stanbury says it all comes from\n   their wearing chignons. I wish you knew Aunt Stanbury,\n   because she is so good. Perhaps you wear a chignon. I\n   think Priscilla said that you did. It must not be large,\n   if you come to see Aunt Stanbury.\n\n   Pray write to me,--and believe that I hope to be your most\n   affectionate sister,\n\n   DOROTHY STANBURY.\n\n   P.S.--I am so happy, and I do so hope that you will be the\n   same.\n\n\nThis was received only a day before the departure of the Rowleys for\nItaly, and was answered by a short note promising that Nora would\nwrite to her correspondent from Florence.\n\nThere could be no doubt that Trevelyan had started with his boy,\nfearing the result of the medical or legal interference with his\naffairs which was about to be made at Sir Marmaduke's instance. He\nhad written a few words to his wife, neither commencing nor ending\nhis note after any usual fashion, telling her that he thought it\nexpedient to travel, that he had secured the services of a nurse for\nthe little boy, and that during his absence a certain income would,\nas heretofore, be paid to her. He said nothing as to his probable\nreturn, or as to her future life; nor was there anything to indicate\nwhither he was going. Stanbury, however, had learned from the\nfaithless and frightened Bozzle that Trevelyan's letters were to be\nsent after him to Florence. Mr. Bozzle, in giving this information,\nhad acknowledged that his employer was \"becoming no longer quite\nhimself under his troubles,\" and had expressed his opinion that he\nought to be \"looked after.\" Bozzle had made his money; and now,\nwith a grain of humanity mixed with many grains of faithlessness,\nreconciled it to himself to tell his master's secrets to his master's\nenemies. What would a counsel be able to say about his conduct\nin a court of law? That was the question which Bozzle was always\nasking himself as to his own business. That he should be abused\nby a barrister to a jury, and exposed as a spy and a fiend, was,\nhe thought, a matter of course. To be so abused was a part of his\nprofession. But it was expedient for him in all cases to secure some\nloop-hole of apparent duty by which he might in part escape from such\ncensures. He was untrue to his employer now, because he thought that\nhis employer ought to be \"looked after.\" He did, no doubt, take a\nfive-pound note from Hugh Stanbury; but then it was necessary that\nhe should live. He must be paid for his time. In this way Trevelyan\nstarted for Florence, and within a week afterwards the Rowleys were\nupon his track.\n\nNothing had been said by Sir Marmaduke to Nora as to her lover since\nthat stormy interview in which both father and daughter had expressed\ntheir opinions very strongly, and very little had been said by Lady\nRowley. Lady Rowley had spoken more than once of Nora's return to\nthe Mandarins, and had once alluded to it as a certainty. \"But I do\nnot know that I shall go back,\" Nora had said. \"My dear,\" the mother\nhad replied, \"unless you are married, I suppose your home must be\nwith your parents.\" Nora, having made her protest, did not think it\nnecessary to persevere, and so the matter was dropped. It was known,\nhowever, that they must all come back to London before they started\nfor their seat of government, and therefore the subject did not at\npresent assume its difficult aspect. There was a tacit understanding\namong them that everything should be done to make the journey\npleasant to the young mother who was in search of her son; and, in\naddition to this, Lady Rowley had her own little understanding, which\nwas very tacit indeed, that in Mr. Glascock might be found an escape\nfrom one of their great family difficulties.\n\n\"You had better take this, papa,\" Mrs. Trevelyan had said, when she\nreceived from the office of Mr. Bideawhile a cheque payable to her\norder for the money sent to her by her husband's direction.\n\n\"I do not want the man's money,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"But you are going to this place for my sake, papa;--and it is right\nthat he should bear the expense for his own wife. And, papa, you must\nremember always that though his mind is distracted on this horrible\nbusiness, he is not a bad man. No one is more liberal or more just\nabout money.\" Sir Marmaduke's feelings on the matter were very\nmuch the same as those which had troubled Mr. Outhouse, and he,\npersonally, refused to touch the money; but his daughter paid her own\nshare of the expenses of the journey.\n\nThey travelled at their ease, stopping at Paris, and at Geneva, and\nat Milan. Lady Rowley thought that she was taken very fast, because\nshe was allowed to sleep only two nights at each of these places,\nand Sir Rowley himself thought that he had achieved something of a\nHannibalian enterprise in taking five ladies and two maids over the\nSimplon and down into the plains of Lombardy, with nobody to protect\nhim but a single courier. He had been a little nervous about it,\nbeing unaccustomed to European travelling, and had not at first\nrealised the fact that the journey is to be made with less trouble\nthan one from the Marble Arch to Mile End. \"My dears,\" he said to his\nyounger daughters, as they were rattling round the steep downward\ntwists and turns of the great road, \"you must sit quite still on\nthese descents, or you do not know where you may go. The least thing\nwould overset us.\" But Lucy and Sophy soon knew better, and became\nso intimate with the mountain, under the friendly guidance of their\ncourier, that before the plains were reached, they were in and out,\nand here and there, and up and down, as though they had been bred\namong the valleys of the pass. There would come a ringing laugh from\nsome rock above their head, and Lady Rowley looking up would see\ntheir dresses fluttering on a pinnacle which appeared to her to be\nfit only for a bird; and there would be the courier behind them, with\ntwo parasols, and a shawl, and a cloak, and an eye-glass, and a fine\npair of grizzled whiskers. They made an Alpine club of their own,\nrefusing to admit their father because he would not climb up a rock,\nand Nora thought of the letters about it which she would write to\nher lover,--only that she had determined that she would not write to\nhim at all without telling her mother,--and Mrs. Trevelyan would for\nmoments almost forget that she had been robbed of her child.\n\nFrom Milan they went on to Florence, and though they were by that\ntime quite at home in Italy, and had become critical judges of\nItalian inns and Italian railways, they did not find that journey\nto be quite so pleasant. There is a romance to us still in the name\nof Italy which a near view of many details in the country fails to\nrealise. Shall we say that a journey through Lombardy is about as\ninteresting as one through the flats of Cambridgeshire and the fens\nof Norfolk? And the station of Bologna is not an interesting spot\nin which to spend an hour or two, although it may be conceded that\nprovisions may be had there much better than any that can be procured\nat our own railway stations. From thence they went, still by rail,\nover the Apennines, and unfortunately slept during the whole time.\nThe courier had assured them that if they would only look out they\nwould see the castles of which they had read in novels; but the day\nhad been very hot, and Sir Marmaduke had been cross, and Lady Rowley\nhad been weary, and so not a castle was seen. \"Pistoia, me lady,\nthis,\" said the courier opening the door;--\"to stop half an hour.\"\n\"Oh, why was it not Florence?\" Another hour and a half! So they\nall went to sleep again, and were very tired when they reached the\nbeautiful city.\n\nDuring the next day they rested at their inn, and sauntered through\nthe Duomo, and broke their necks looking up at the inimitable glories\nof the campanile. Such a one as Sir Marmaduke had of course not come\nto Florence without introductions. The Foreign Office is always very\ncivil to its next-door neighbour of the colonies,--civil and cordial,\nthough perhaps a little patronising. A minister is a bigger man than\na governor; and the smallest of the diplomatic fry are greater swells\nthan even secretaries in quite important dependencies. The attach\u00c3\u00a9,\nthough he be unpaid, dwells in a capital, and flirts with a countess.\nThe governor's right-hand man is confined to an island, and dances\nwith a planter's daughter. The distinction is quite understood, but\nis not incompatible with much excellent good feeling on the part of\nthe superior department. Sir Marmaduke had come to Florence fairly\nprovided with passports to Florentine society, and had been mentioned\nin more than one letter as the distinguished Governor of the\nMandarins, who had been called home from his seat of government on a\nspecial mission of great importance. On the second day he went out\nto call at the embassy and to leave his cards. \"Have you been able\nto learn whether he is here?\" asked Lady Rowley of her husband in a\nwhisper, as soon as they were alone.\n\n\"Who;--Trevelyan?\"\n\n\"I did not suppose you could learn about him, because he would be\nhiding himself. But is Mr. Glascock here?\"\n\n\"I forgot to ask,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\nLady Rowley did not reproach him. It is impossible that any father\nshould altogether share a mother's anxiety in regard to the marriage\nof their daughters. But what a thing it would be! Lady Rowley thought\nthat she could compound for all misfortunes in other respects, if she\ncould have a daughter married to the future Lord Peterborough. She\nhad been told in England that he was faultless,--not very clever, not\nvery active, not likely to be very famous; but, as a husband, simply\nfaultless. He was very rich, very good-natured, easily managed,\nmore likely to be proud of his wife than of himself, addicted to no\njealousies, afflicted by no vices, so respectable in every way that\nhe was sure to become great as an English nobleman by the very weight\nof his virtues. And it had been represented also to Lady Rowley\nthat this paragon among men had been passionately attached to her\ndaughter! Perhaps she magnified a little the romance of the story;\nbut it seemed to her that this greatly endowed lover had rushed away\nfrom his country in despair, because her daughter Nora would not\nsmile upon him. Now they were, as she hoped, in the same city with\nhim. But it was indispensable to her success that she should not seem\nto be running after him. To Nora, not a word had been said of the\nprospect of meeting Mr. Glascock at Florence. Hardly more than a\nword had been said to her sister Emily, and that under injunction\nof strictest secrecy. It must be made to appear to all the world\nthat other motives had brought them to Florence,--as, indeed, other\nmotives had brought them. Not for worlds would Lady Rowley have run\nafter a man for her daughter; but still, still,--still, seeing that\nthe man was himself so unutterably in love with her girl, seeing that\nhe was so fully justified by his position to be in love with any\ngirl, seeing that such a maximum of happiness would be the result of\nsuch a marriage, she did feel that, even for his sake, she must be\ndoing a good thing to bring them together! Something, though not much\nof all this, she had been obliged to explain to Sir Marmaduke;--and\nyet he had not taken the trouble to inquire whether Mr. Glascock was\nin Florence!\n\nOn the third day after their arrival, the wife of the British\nminister came to call upon Lady Rowley, and the wife of the British\nminister was good-natured, easy-mannered, and very much given to\nconversation. She preferred talking to listening, and in the course\nof a quarter of an hour had told Lady Rowley a good deal about\nFlorence; but she had not mentioned Mr. Glascock's name. It would\nhave been so pleasant if the requisite information could have been\nobtained without the asking of any direct question on the subject!\nBut Lady Rowley, who from many years' practice of similar, though\nperhaps less distinguished, courtesies on her part, knew well the\nfirst symptom of the coming end of her guest's visit, found that the\nminister's wife was about to take her departure without an allusion\nto Mr. Glascock. And yet the names had been mentioned of so many\nEnglish residents in Florence, who neither in wealth, rank, or\nvirtue, were competent to hold a candle to that phoenix! She was\nforced, therefore, to pluck up courage, and to ask the question.\n\"Have you had a Mr. Glascock here this spring?\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"What;--Lord Peterborough's son? Oh, dear, yes. Such a singular\nbeing!\"\n\nLady Rowley thought that she could perceive that her phoenix had\nnot made himself agreeable at the embassy. It might perhaps be that\nhe had buried himself away from society because of his love. \"And is\nhere now?\" asked Lady Rowley.\n\n\"I cannot say at all. He is sometimes here and sometimes with his\nfather at Naples. But when here, he lives chiefly with the Americans.\nThey say he is going to marry an American girl,--their minister's\nniece. There are three of them, I think, and he is to take the\neldest.\" Lady Rowley asked no more questions, and let her august\nvisitor go, almost without another word.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\n\n\"WE SHALL BE SO POOR.\"\n\n\nMr. Glascock at that moment was not only in Florence, but was\noccupying rooms in the very hotel in which the Rowleys were staying.\nLady Rowley, when she heard that he was engaged to marry an American\nlady, became suddenly very sick at heart,--sick with a sickness\nthat almost went beyond her heart. She felt ill, and was glad to be\nalone. The rumour might be untrue. Such rumours generally are untrue.\nBut then, as Lady Rowley knew very well, they generally have some\nfoundation in truth. Mr. Glascock, if he were not actually engaged\nto the American girl, had probably been flirting with her;--and, if\nso, where was that picture which Lady Rowley had been painting for\nherself of a love-lorn swain to be brought back to the pleasures and\noccupations of the world only by the girl of whom he was enamoured?\nBut still she would not quite give up the project. Mr. Glascock,\nif he was in Italy, would no doubt see by the newspapers that Sir\nMarmaduke and his family were in Florence,--and would probably come\nto them. Then, if Nora would only behave herself, the American girl\nmight still be conquered.\n\nDuring two or three days after this nothing was seen or heard of\nMr. Glascock. Had Lady Rowley thought of mentioning the name to the\nwaiter at the hotel, she would have learned that he was living in the\nnext passage; but it did not occur to her to seek information in that\nfashion. Nor did she ask direct questions in other quarters about\nMr. Glascock himself. She did, however, make inquiry about Americans\nliving in Florence,--especially about the American Minister,--and,\nbefore a week had passed overhead, had been introduced to the\nSpaldings. Mrs. Spalding was very civil, and invited Lady Rowley and\nall the girls and Sir Marmaduke to come to her on her \"Fridays.\" She\nreceived her friends every Friday, and would continue to do so till\nthe middle of June. She had nieces who would, she said, be so happy\nto make the acquaintance of the Miss Rowleys.\n\nBy this time the picture galleries, the churches, and the palaces in\nFlorence had nearly all been visited. Poor Lady Rowley had dragged\nherself wearily from sight to sight, hoping always to meet with\nMr. Glascock, ignorant of the fact that residents in a town do not\npass their mornings habitually in looking after pictures. During\nthis time inquiries were being made through the police, respecting\nTrevelyan; and Sir Marmaduke had obtained information that an English\ngentleman, with a little boy, had gone on to Siena, and had located\nhimself there. There seemed to be but little doubt that this was\nTrevelyan,--though nothing had been learned with certainty as to the\ngentleman's name. It had been decided that Sir Marmaduke, with his\ncourier and Mrs. Trevelyan, should go on to Siena, and endeavour\nto come upon the fugitive, and they had taken their departure on a\ncertain morning. On that same day Lady Rowley was walking with Nora\nand one of the other girls through the hall of the hotel, when they\nwere met in full face--by Mr. Glascock! Lady Rowley and Lucy were in\nfront, and they, of course, did not know the man. Nora had seen him\nat once, and in her confusion hardly knew how to bear herself. Mr.\nGlascock was passing by her without recognising her,--had passed her\nmother and sister, and had so far gone on, that Nora had determined\nto make no sign, when he chanced to look up and see who it was that\nwas so close to him. \"Miss Rowley,\" he said, \"who thought of meeting\nyou in Florence!\" Lady Rowley, of course, turned round, and there was\nan introduction. Poor Nora, though she knew nothing of her mother's\nschemes, was confused and ill at ease. Mr. Glascock was very civil,\nbut at the same time rather cold. Lady Rowley was all smiles and\ncourtesy. She had, she said, heard his name from her daughters, and\nwas very happy to make his acquaintance. Lucy looked on somewhat\nastonished to find that the lover whom her sister had been blamed for\nrejecting, and who was spoken of with so many encomiums, was so old a\nman. Mr. Glascock asked after Mrs. Trevelyan; and Lady Rowley, in a\nlow, melancholy whisper, told him that they were now all in Florence,\nin the hope of meeting Mr. Trevelyan. \"You have heard the sad story,\nI know, Mr. Glascock,--and therefore I do not mind telling you.\" Mr.\nGlascock acknowledged that he did know the story, and informed her\nthat he had seen Mr. Trevelyan in Florence within the last ten days.\nThis was so interesting, that, at Lady Rowley's request, he went with\nthem up to their rooms, and in this way the acquaintance was made. It\nturned out that Mr. Glascock had spoken to Mr. Trevelyan, and that\nTrevelyan had told him that he meant for the present to take up his\nresidence in some small Italian town. \"And how was he looking, Mr.\nGlascock?\"\n\n\"Very ill, Lady Rowley;--very ill, indeed.\"\n\n\"Do not tell her so, Mr. Glascock. She has gone now with her father\nto Siena. We think that he is there, with the boy,--or, at least,\nthat he may be heard of there. And you;--you are living here?\" Mr.\nGlascock said that he was living between Naples and Florence,--going\noccasionally to Naples, a place that he hated, to see his father,\nand coming back at intervals to the capital. Nora sat by, and hardly\nspoke a word. She was nicely dressed, with an exquisite little\nbonnet, which had been bought as they came through Paris; and Lady\nRowley, with natural pride, felt that if he was ever in love with her\nchild, that love must come back upon him now. American girls, she had\nbeen told, were hard, and dry, and sharp, and angular. She had seen\nsome at the Mandarins, with whom she thought it must be impossible\nthat any Englishman should be in love. There never, surely, had\nbeen an American girl like her Nora. \"Are you fond of pictures, Mr.\nGlascock?\" she asked. Mr. Glascock was not very fond of pictures,\nand thought that he was rather tired of them. What was he fond of?\nOf sitting at home and doing nothing. That was his reply, at least;\nand a very unsatisfactory reply it was, as Lady Rowley could hardly\npropose that they should come and sit and do nothing with him. Could\nhe have been lured into churches or galleries, Nora might have been\nonce more thrown into his company. Then Lady Rowley took courage,\nand asked him whether he knew the Spaldings. They were going to Mrs.\nSpalding's that very evening,--she and her daughters. Mr. Glascock\nreplied that he did know the Spaldings, and that he also should be at\ntheir house. Lady Rowley thought that she discovered something like a\nblush about his cheekbones and brow, as he made his answer. Then he\nleft them, giving his hand to Nora as he went;--but there was nothing\nin his manner to justify the slightest hope.\n\n\"I don't think he is nice at all,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Don't be so foolish, Lucy,\" said Lady Rowley angrily.\n\n\"I think he is very nice,\" said Nora. \"He was only talking nonsense\nwhen he said that he liked to sit still and do nothing. He is not at\nall an idle man;--at least I am told so.\"\n\n\"But he is as old as Methuselah,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"He is between thirty and forty,\" said Lady Rowley. \"Of course we\nknow that from the peerage.\" Lady Rowley, however, was wrong. Had she\nconsulted the peerage, she would have seen that Mr. Glascock was over\nforty.\n\nNora, as soon as she was alone and could think about it all, felt\nquite sure that Mr. Glascock would never make her another offer. This\nought not to have caused her any sorrow, as she was very well aware\nthat she would not accept him, should he do so. Yet, perhaps, there\nwas a moment of some feeling akin to disappointment. Of course she\nwould not have accepted him. How could she? Her faith was so plighted\nto Hugh Stanbury that she would be a by-word among women for ever,\nwere she to be so false. And as she told herself, she had not the\nslightest feeling of affection for Mr. Glascock. It was quite out of\nthe question, and a matter simply for speculation. Nevertheless it\nwould have been a very grand thing to be Lady Peterborough, and she\nalmost regretted that she had a heart in her bosom.\n\nShe had become fully aware during that interview that her mother\nstill entertained hopes, and almost suspected that Lady Rowley had\nknown something of Mr. Glascock's residence in Florence. She had\nseen that her mother had met Mr. Glascock almost as though some such\nmeeting had been expected, and had spoken to him almost as though she\nhad expected to have to speak to him. Would it not be better that she\nshould at once make her mother understand that all this could be of\nno avail? If she were to declare plainly that nothing could bring\nabout such a marriage, would not her mother desist? She almost made\nup her mind to do so; but as her mother said nothing to her before\nthey started for Mr. Spalding's house, neither did she say anything\nto her mother. She did not wish to have angry words if they could be\navoided, and she felt that there might be anger and unpleasant words\nwere she to insist upon her devotion to Hugh Stanbury while this rich\nprize was in sight. If her mother should speak to her, then, indeed,\nshe would declare her own settled purpose; but she would do nothing\nto accelerate the evil hour.\n\nThere were but few people in Mrs. Spalding's drawing-room when they\nwere announced, and Mr. Glascock was not among them. Miss Wallachia\nPetrie was there, and in the confusion of the introduction was\npresumed by Lady Rowley to be one of the nieces introduced. She had\nbeen distinctly told that Mr. Glascock was to marry the eldest, and\nthis lady was certainly older than the other two. In this way Lady\nRowley decided that Miss Wallachia Petrie was her daughter's hated\nrival, and she certainly was much surprised at the gentleman's taste.\nBut there is nothing,--nothing in the way of an absurd matrimonial\nengagement,--into which a man will not allow himself to be entrapped\nby pique. Nora would have a great deal to answer for, Lady Rowley\nthought, if the unfortunate man should be driven by her cruelty to\nmarry such a woman as this one now before her.\n\nIt happened that Lady Rowley soon found herself seated by Miss\nPetrie, and she at once commenced her questionings. She intended to\nbe very discreet, but the subject was too near her heart to allow her\nto be altogether silent. \"I believe you know Mr. Glascock?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wallachia, \"I do know him.\" Now the peculiar nasal twang\nwhich our cousins over the water have learned to use, and which\nhas grown out of a certain national instinct which coerces them to\nexpress themselves with self-assertion;--let the reader go into his\ncloset and talk through his nose for awhile with steady attention\nto the effect which his own voice will have, and he will find that\nthis theory is correct;--this intonation, which is so peculiar among\nintelligent Americans, had been adopted con amore, and, as it were,\ntaken to her bosom by Miss Petrie. Her ears had taught themselves\nto feel that there could be no vitality in speech without it, and\nthat all utterance unsustained by such tone was effeminate, vapid,\nuseless, unpersuasive, unmusical,--and English. It was a complaint\nfrequently made by her against her friends Caroline and Olivia that\nthey debased their voices, and taught themselves the puling British\nmode of speech. \"I do know the gentleman,\" said Wallachia;--and Lady\nRowley shuddered. Could it be that such a woman as this was to reign\nover Monkhams, and become the future Lady Peterborough?\n\n\"He told me that he is acquainted with the family,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\"He is staying at our hotel, and my daughter knew him very well when\nhe was living in London.\"\n\n\"I dare say. I believe that in London the titled aristocrats do hang\npretty much together.\" It had never occurred to poor Lady Rowley,\nsince the day in which her husband had been made a knight, at the\nadvice of the Colonial Minister, in order that the inhabitants of\nsome island might be gratified by the opportunity of using the\ntitle, that she and her children had thereby become aristocrats.\nWere her daughter Nora to marry Mr. Glascock, Nora would become an\naristocrat,--or would, rather, be ennobled,--all which Lady Rowley\nunderstood perfectly.\n\n\"I don't know that London society is very exclusive in that respect,\"\nsaid Lady Rowley.\n\n\"I guess you are pretty particular,\" said Miss Petrie, \"and it seems\nto me you don't have much regard to intellect or erudition,--but fix\nthings up straight according to birth and money.\"\n\n\"I hope we are not quite so bad as that,\" said Lady Rowley. \"I do not\nknow London well myself, as I have passed my life in very distant\nplaces.\"\n\n\"The distant places are, in my estimation, the best. The further the\nmind is removed from the contamination incidental to the centres of\nlong-established luxury, the more chance it has of developing itself\naccording to the intention of the Creator, when he bestowed his gifts\nof intellect upon us.\" Lady Rowley, when she heard this eloquence,\ncould hardly believe that such a man as Mr. Glascock should really be\nintent upon marrying such a lady as this who was sitting next to her.\n\nIn the meantime, Nora and the real rival were together, and they also\nwere talking of Mr. Glascock. Caroline Spalding had said that Mr.\nGlascock had spoken to her of Nora Rowley, and Nora acknowledged that\nthere had been some acquaintance between them in London. \"Almost more\nthan that, I should have thought,\" said Miss Spalding, \"if one might\njudge by his manner of speaking of you.\"\n\n\n   [Illustration: The rivals.]\n\n\n\"He is a little given to be enthusiastic,\" said Nora, laughing.\n\n\"The least so of all mankind, I should have said. You must know he is\nvery intimate in this house. It begun in this way;--Olivia and I were\ntravelling together, and there was--a difficulty, as we say in our\ncountry when three or four gentlemen shoot each other. Then there\ncame up Mr. Glascock and another gentleman. By-the-bye, the other\ngentleman was your brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"Poor Mr. Trevelyan!\"\n\n\"He is very ill;--is he not?\"\n\n\"We think so. My sister is with us, you know. That is to say, she is\nat Siena to-day.\"\n\n\"I have heard about him, and it is so sad. Mr. Glascock knows him. As\nI said, they were travelling together, when Mr. Glascock came to our\nassistance. Since that, we have seen him very frequently. I don't\nthink he is enthusiastic,--except when he talks of you.\"\n\n\"I ought to be very proud,\" said Nora.\n\n\"I think you ought,--as Mr. Glascock is a man whose good opinion is\ncertainly worth having. Here he is. Mr. Glascock, I hope your ears\nare tingling. They ought to do so, because we are saying all manner\nof fine things about you.\"\n\n\"I could not be well spoken of by two on whose good word I should set\na higher value,\" said he.\n\n\"And whose do you value the most?\" said Caroline.\n\n\"I must first know whose eulogium will run the highest.\"\n\nThen Nora answered him. \"Mr. Glascock, other people may praise\nyou louder than I can do, but no one will ever do so with more\nsincerity.\" There was a pretty earnestness about her as she spoke,\nwhich Lady Rowley ought to have heard. Mr. Glascock bowed, and Miss\nSpalding smiled, and Nora blushed.\n\n\"If you are not overwhelmed now,\" said Miss Spalding, \"you must be so\nused to flattery, that it has no longer any effect upon you. You must\nbe like a drunkard, to whom wine is as water, and who thinks that\nbrandy is not strong enough.\"\n\n\"I think I had better go away,\" said Mr. Glascock, \"for fear the\nbrandy should be watered by degrees.\" And so he left them.\n\nNora had become quite aware, without much process of thinking about\nit, that her former lover and this American young lady were very\nintimate with each other. The tone of the conversation had shewn that\nit was so;--and, then, how had it come to pass that Mr. Glascock had\nspoken to this American girl about her,--Nora Rowley? It was evident\nthat he had spoken of her with warmth, and had done so in a manner to\nimpress his hearer. For a minute or two they sat together in silence\nafter Mr. Glascock had left them, but neither of them stirred. Then\nCaroline Spalding turned suddenly upon Nora, and took her by the\nhand. \"I must tell you something,\" said she, \"only it must be a\nsecret for awhile.\"\n\n\"I will not repeat it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear. I am engaged to him,--as his wife. He asked me this\nvery afternoon, and nobody knows it but my aunt. When I had accepted\nhim, he told me all the story about you. He had very often spoken\nof you before, and I had guessed how it must have been. He wears\nhis heart so open for those whom he loves, that there is nothing\nconcealed. He had seen you just before he came to me. But perhaps I\nam wrong to tell you that now. He ought to have been thinking of you\nagain at such a time.\"\n\n\"I did not want him to think of me again.\"\n\n\"Of course you did not. Of course I am joking. You might have been\nhis wife if you wished it. He has told me all that. And he especially\nwants us to be friends. Is there anything to prevent it?\"\n\n\"On my part? Oh, dear, no;--except that you will be such grand folk,\nand we shall be so poor.\"\n\n\"We!\" said Caroline, laughing. \"I am so glad that there is a 'we.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\nTHE FUTURE LADY PETERBOROUGH.\n\n\n\"If you have not sold yourself for British gold, and for British\nacres, and for British rank, I have nothing to say against it,\"\nsaid Miss Wallachia Petrie that same evening to her friend Caroline\nSpalding.\n\n\"You know that I have not sold myself, as you call it,\" said\nCaroline. There had been a long friendship between these two ladies,\nand the younger one knew that it behoved her to bear a good deal\nfrom the elder. Miss Petrie was honest, clever, and in earnest. We\nin England are not usually favourably disposed to women who take a\npride in a certain antagonism to men in general, and who are anxious\nto shew the world that they can get on very well without male\nassistance; but there are many such in America who have noble\naspirations, good intellects, much energy, and who are by no means\nunworthy of friendship. The hope in regard to all such women,--the\nhope entertained not by themselves, but by those who are solicitous\nfor them,--is that they will be cured at last by a husband and\nhalf-a-dozen children. In regard to Wallachia Petrie there was not,\nperhaps, much ground for such hope. She was so positively wedded to\nwomen's rights in general, and to her own rights in particular, that\nit was improbable that she should ever succumb to any man;--and where\nwould be the man brave enough to make the effort? From circumstances\nCaroline Spalding had been the beloved of her heart since Caroline\nSpalding was a very little girl; and she had hoped that Caroline\nwould through life have borne arms along with her in that contest\nwhich she was determined to wage against man, and which she always\nwaged with the greatest animosity against men of the British race.\nShe hated rank; she hated riches; she hated monarchy;--and with\na true woman's instinct in battle, felt that she had a specially\nstrong point against Englishmen, in that they submitted themselves\nto dominion from a woman monarch. And now the chosen friend of her\nyouth,--the friend who had copied out all her poetry, who had learned\nby heart all her sonnets, who had, as she thought, reciprocated all\nher ideas, was going to be married,--and to be married to an English\nlord! She had seen that it was coming for some time, and had spoken\nout very plainly, hoping that she might still save the brand from\nthe burning. Now the evil was done; and Caroline Spalding, when she\ntold her news, knew well that she would have to bear some heavy\nreproaches.\n\n\"How many of us are there who never know whether we sell ourselves\nor not?\" said Wallachia. \"The senator who longs for office, and who\nvotes this way instead of that in order that he may get it, thinks\nthat he is voting honestly. The minister who calls himself a teacher\nof God's word, thinks that it is God's word that he preaches when\nhe strains his lungs to fill his church. The question is this,\nCaroline;--would you have loved the same man had he come to you with\na woodman's axe in his hand or a clerk's quill behind his ear? I\nguess not.\"\n\n\"As to the woodman's axe, Wally, it is very well in theory; but--\"\n\n\"Things good in theory, Caroline, will be good also when practised.\nYou may be sure of that. We dislike theory simply because our\nintelligences are higher than our wills. But we will let that pass.\"\n\n\"Pray let it pass, Wally. Do not preach me sermons to-night. I am so\nhappy, and you ought to wish me joy.\"\n\n\"If wishing you joy would get you joy, I would wish it you while I\nlived. I cannot be happy that you should be taken from us whither I\nshall never see you again.\"\n\n\"But you are to come to us. I have told him so, and it is settled.\"\n\n\"No, dear; I shall not do that. What should I be in the glittering\nhalls of an English baron? Could there be any visiting less fitting,\nany admixture less appropriate? Could I who have held up my voice\nin the Music Hall of Laced\u00c3\u00a6mon, amidst the glories of the West, in\nthe great and free State of Illinois, against the corruption of an\nEnglish aristocracy,--could I, who have been listened to by two\nthousand of my countrywomen,--and men,--while I spurned the unmanly,\ninhuman errors of primogeniture,--could I, think you, hold my tongue\nbeneath the roof of a feudal lord!\" Caroline Spalding knew that her\nfriend could not hold her tongue, and hesitated to answer. There had\nbeen that fatal triumph of a lecture on the joint rights of men and\nwomen, and it had rendered poor Wallachia Petrie unfit for ordinary\nsociety.\n\n\"You might come there without talking politics, Wally,\" said\nCaroline.\n\n\"No, Caroline; no. I will go into the house of no man in which the\nfree expression of my opinion is debarred me. I will not sit even\nat your table with a muzzled tongue. When you are gone, Caroline,\nI shall devote myself to what, after all, must be the work of my\nlife, and I shall finish the biographical history of our great\nhero in verse,--which I hope may at least be not ephemeral. From\nmonth to month I shall send you what I do, and you will not refuse\nme your friendly criticism,--and, perhaps, some slight meed of\napprobation,--because you are dwelling beneath the shade of a throne.\nOh, Caroline, let it not be a upas tree!\"\n\nThe Miss Petries of the world have this advantage,--an advantage\nwhich rarely if ever falls to the lot of a man,--that they are never\nconvinced of error. Men, let them be ever so much devoted to their\nclosets, let them keep their work ever so closely veiled from public\nscrutiny, still find themselves subjected to criticism, and under\nthe necessity of either defending themselves or of succumbing. If,\nindeed, a man neither speaks, nor writes,--if he be dumb as regards\nopinion,--he passes simply as one of the crowd, and is in the way\nneither of convincing nor of being convinced; but a woman may speak,\nand almost write, as she likes, without danger of being wounded by\nsustained conflict. Who would have the courage to begin with such a\none as Miss Petrie, and endeavour to prove to her that she is wrong\nfrom the beginning? A little word of half-dissent, a smile, a shrug,\nand an ambiguous compliment which is misunderstood, are all the forms\nof argument which can be used against her. Wallachia Petrie, in\nher heart of hearts, conceived that she had fairly discussed her\ngreat projects from year to year with indomitable eloquence and\nunanswerable truth,--and that none of her opponents had had a leg\nto stand upon. And this she believed because the chivalry of men\nhad given to her sex that protection against which her life was one\ncontinued protest.\n\n\"Here he is,\" said Caroline, as Mr. Glascock came up to them. \"Try\nand say a civil word to him, if he speaks about it. Though he is to\nbe a lord, still he is a man and a brother.\"\n\n\"Caroline,\" said the stern monitress, \"you are already learning to\nlaugh at principles which have been dear to you since you left your\nmother's breast. Alas, how true it is, 'You cannot touch pitch and\nnot be defiled.'\"\n\nThe further progress of these friendly and feminine amenities was\nstopped by the presence of the gentleman who had occasioned them.\n\"Miss Petrie,\" said the hero of the hour, \"Caroline was to tell you\nof my good fortune, and no doubt she has done so.\"\n\n\"I cannot wait to hear the pretty things he has to say,\" said\nCaroline, \"and I must look after my aunt's guests. There is poor\nSignor Buonarosci without a soul to say a syllable to him, and I must\ngo and use my ten Italian words.\"\n\n\"You are about to take with you to your old country, Mr. Glascock,\"\nsaid Miss Petrie, \"one of the brightest stars in our young American\nfirmament.\" There could be no doubt, from the tone of Miss Petrie's\nvoice, that she now regarded this star, however bright, as one of a\nsort which is subjected to falling.\n\n\"I am going to take a very nice young woman,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"I hate that word woman, sir, uttered with the half-hidden sneer\nwhich always accompanies its expression from the mouth of a man.\"\n\n\"Sneer, Miss Petrie!\"\n\n\"I quite allow that it is involuntary, and not analysed or understood\nby yourselves. If you speak of a dog, you intend to do so with\naffection, but there is always contempt mixed with it. The so-called\nchivalry of man to woman is all begotten in the same spirit. I want\nno favour, but I claim to be your equal.\"\n\n\"I thought that American ladies were generally somewhat exacting as\nto those privileges which chivalry gives them.\"\n\n\"It is true, sir, that the only rank we know in our country is in\nthat precedence which man gives to woman. Whether we maintain that,\nor whether we abandon it, we do not intend to purchase it at the\nprice of an acknowledgment of intellectual inferiority. For myself, I\nhate chivalry;--what you call chivalry. I can carry my own chair, and\nI claim the right to carry it whithersoever I may please.\"\n\nMr. Glascock remained with her for some time, but made no opportunity\nfor giving that invitation to Monkhams of which Caroline had spoken.\nAs he said afterwards, he found it impossible to expect her to attend\nto any subject so trivial; and when, afterwards, Caroline told him,\nwith some slight mirth,--the capability of which on such a subject\nwas coming to her with her new ideas of life,--that, though he was\npartly saved as a man and a brother, still he was partly the reverse\nas a feudal lord, he began to reflect that Wallachia Petrie would be\na guest with whom he would find it very difficult to make things go\npleasant at Monkhams. \"Does she not bully you horribly?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course she bullies me,\" Caroline answered; \"and I cannot expect\nyou to understand as yet how it is that I love her and like her; but\nI do. If I were in distress to-morrow, she would give everything she\nhas in the world to put me right.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah, you;--that is a matter of course. That is your business now.\nAnd she would give everything she has in the world to set the world\nright. Would you do that?\"\n\n\"It would depend on the amount of my faith. If I could believe in the\nresult, I suppose I should do it.\"\n\n\"She would do it on the slightest hope that such giving would have\nany tendency that way. Her philanthropy is all real. Of course she is\na bore to you.\"\n\n\"I am very patient.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall find you so,--always. And, of course, she is\nridiculous--in your eyes. I have learned to see it, and to regret it;\nbut I shall never cease to love her.\"\n\n\"I have not the slightest objection. Her lessons will come from over\nthe water, and mine will come from--where shall I say?--over the\ntable. If I can't talk her down with so much advantage on my side, I\nought to be made a woman's-right man myself.\"\n\nPoor Lady Rowley had watched Miss Petrie and Mr. Glascock during\nthose moments that they had been together, and had half believed the\nrumour, and had half doubted, thinking in the moments of her belief\nthat Mr. Glascock must be mad, and in the moments of unbelief that\nthe rumours had been set afloat by the English Minister's wife with\nthe express intention of turning Mr. Glascock into ridicule. It had\nnever occurred to her to doubt that Wallachia was the eldest of that\nfamily of nieces. Could it be possible that a man who had known\nher Nora, who had undoubtedly loved her Nora,--who had travelled\nall the way from London to Nuncombe Putney to ask Nora to be his\nwife,--should within twelve months of that time have resolved to\nmarry a woman whom he must have selected simply as being the most\nopposite to Nora of any female human being that he could find? It was\nnot credible to her; and if it were not true, there might still be a\nhope. Nora had met him, and had spoken to him, and it had seemed that\nfor a moment or two they had spoken as friends. Lady Rowley, when\ntalking to Mrs. Spalding, had watched them closely; and she had seen\nthat Nora's eyes had been bright, and that there had been something\nbetween them which was pleasant. Suddenly she found herself close to\nWallachia, and thought that she would trust herself to a word.\n\n\"Have you been long in Florence?\" asked Lady Rowley in her softest\nvoice.\n\n\"A pretty considerable time, ma'am;--that is, since the fall began.\"\n\nWhat a voice;--what an accent;--and what words! Was there a man\nliving with sufficient courage to take this woman to England, and\nshew her to the world as Lady Peterborough?\n\n\"Are you going to remain in Italy for the summer?\" continued Lady\nRowley.\n\n\"I guess I shall;--or, perhaps, locate myself in the purer atmosphere\nof the Swiss mountains.\"\n\n\"Switzerland in summer must certainly be much pleasanter.\"\n\n\"I was thinking at the moment of the political atmosphere,\" said Miss\nPetrie; \"for although, certainly, much has been done in this country\nin the way of striking off shackles and treading sceptres under foot,\nstill, Lady Rowley, there remains here that pernicious thing,--a\nking. The feeling of the dominion of a single man,--and that of a\nsingle woman is, for aught I know, worse,--with me so clouds the air,\nthat the breath I breathe fails to fill my lungs.\" Wallachia, as she\nsaid this, put forth her hand, and raised her chin, and extended\nher arm. She paused, feeling that justice demanded that Lady Rowley\nshould have a right of reply. But Lady Rowley had not a word to say,\nand Wallachia Petrie went on. \"I cannot adapt my body to the sweet\nsavours and the soft luxuries of the outer world with any comfort to\nmy inner self, while the circumstances of the society around me are\noppressive to my spirit. When our war was raging all around me I was\nlight-spirited as the lark that mounts through the morning sky.\"\n\n\"I should have thought it was very dreadful,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Full of dread, of awe, and of horror, were those fiery days of\nindiscriminate slaughter; but they were not days of desolation,\nbecause hope was always there by our side. There was a hope in\nwhich the soul could trust, and the trusting soul is ever light and\nbuoyant.\"\n\n\"I dare say it is,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"But apathy, and serfdom, and kinghood, and dominion, drain the\nfountain of its living springs, and the soul becomes like the plummet\nof lead, whose only tendency is to hide itself in subaqueous mud and\nunsavoury slush.\"\n\nSubaqueous mud and unsavoury slush! Lady Rowley repeated the words to\nherself as she made good her escape, and again expressed to herself\nher conviction that it could not possibly be so. The \"subaqueous mud\nand unsavoury slush,\" with all that had gone before it about the\nsoul was altogether unintelligible to her; but she knew that it was\nAmerican buncom of a high order of eloquence, and she told herself\nagain and again that it could not be so. She continued to keep her\neyes upon Mr. Glascock, and soon saw him again talking to Nora. It\nwas hardly possible, she thought, that Nora should speak to him\nwith so much animation, or he to her, unless there was some feeling\nbetween them which, if properly handled, might lead to a renewal of\nthe old tenderness. She went up to Nora, having collected the other\ngirls, and said that the carriage was then waiting for them. Mr.\nGlascock immediately offered Lady Rowley his arm, and took her\ndown to the hall. Could it be that she was leaning upon a future\nson-in-law? There was something in the thought which made her lay\nher weight upon him with a freedom which she would not otherwise\nhave used. Oh!--that her Nora should live to be Lady Peterborough!\nWe are apt to abuse mothers for wanting high husbands for their\ndaughters;--but can there be any point in which the true maternal\ninstinct can shew itself with more affectionate enthusiasm? This poor\nmother wanted nothing for herself from Mr. Glascock. She knew very\nwell that it was her fate to go back to the Mandarins, and probably\nto die there. She knew also that such men as Mr. Glascock, when they\nmarry beneath themselves in rank and fortune, will not ordinarily\ntrouble themselves much with their mothers-in-law. There was nothing\ndesired for herself. Were such a match accomplished, she might,\nperhaps, indulge herself in talking among the planters' wives of her\ndaughter's coronet; but at the present moment there was no idea even\nof this in her mind. It was of Nora herself, and of Nora's sisters,\nthat she was thinking,--for them that she was plotting,--that the\none might be rich and splendid, and the others have some path opened\nfor them to riches and splendour. Husband-hunting mothers may be\ninjudicious; but surely they are maternal and unselfish. Mr. Glascock\nput her into the carriage, and squeezed her hand;--and then he\nsqueezed Nora's hand. She saw it, and was sure of it. \"I am so glad\nyou are going to be happy,\" Nora had said to him before this. \"As\nfar as I have seen her, I like her so much.\" \"If you do not come\nand visit her in her own house, I shall think you have no spirit of\nfriendship,\" he said. \"I will,\" Nora had replied;--\"I will.\" This had\nbeen said up-stairs, just as Lady Rowley was coming to them, and on\nthis understanding, on this footing, Mr. Glascock had pressed her\nhand.\n\nAs she went home, Lady Rowley's mind was full of doubt as to the\ncourse which it was best that she should follow with her daughter.\nShe was not unaware how great was the difficulty before her. Hugh\nStanbury's name had not been mentioned since they left London, but at\nthat time Nora was obstinately bent on throwing herself away upon the\n\"penny-a-liner.\" She had never been brought to acknowledge that such\na marriage would be even inappropriate, and had withstood gallantly\nthe expression of her father's displeasure. But with such a spirit as\nNora's, it might be easier to prevail by silence than by many words.\nLady Rowley was quite sure of this,--that it would be far better to\nsay nothing further of Hugh Stanbury. Let the cure come, if it might\nbe possible, from absence and from her daughter's good sense. The\nonly question was whether it would be wise to say any word about Mr.\nGlascock. In the carriage she was not only forbearing but flattering\nin her manner to Nora. She caressed her girl's hand and spoke to\nher,--as mothers know how to speak when they want to make much of\ntheir girls, and to have it understood that those girls are behaving\nas girls should behave. There was to be nobody to meet them to-night,\nas it had been arranged that Sir Marmaduke and Mrs. Trevelyan should\nsleep at Siena. Hardly a word had been spoken in the carriage; but\nup-stairs, in their drawing-room, there came a moment in which Lucy\nand Sophie had left them, and Nora was alone with her mother. Lady\nRowley almost knew that it would be most prudent to be silent;--but a\nword spoken in season;--how good it is! And the thing was so near to\nher that she could not hold her peace. \"I must say, Nora,\" she began,\n\"that I do like your Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"He is not my Mr. Glascock, mamma,\" said Nora, smiling.\n\n\"You know what I mean, dear.\" Lady Rowley had not intended to utter a\nword that should appear like pressure on her daughter at this moment.\nShe had felt how imprudent it would be to do so. But now Nora seemed\nto be leading the way herself to such discourse. \"Of course, he is\nnot your Mr. Glascock. You cannot eat your cake and have it, nor can\nyou throw it away and have it.\"\n\n\"I have thrown my cake away altogether, and certainly I cannot have\nit.\" She was still smiling as she spoke, and seemed to be quite merry\nat the idea of regarding Mr. Glascock as the cake which she had\ndeclined to eat.\n\n\"I can see one thing quite plainly, dear.\"\n\n\"What is that, mamma?\"\n\n\"That in spite of what you have done, you can still have your cake\nwhenever you choose to take it.\"\n\n\"Why, mamma, he is engaged to be married!\"\n\n\"Mr. Glascock?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Glascock. It's quite settled. Is it not sad?\"\n\n\"To whom is he engaged?\" Lady Rowley's solemnity as she asked this\nquestion was piteous to behold.\n\n\"To Miss Spalding,--Caroline Spalding.\"\n\n\"The eldest of those nieces?\"\n\n\"Yes;--the eldest.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe it.\"\n\n\"Mamma, they both told me so. I have sworn an eternal friendship with\nher already.\"\n\n\"I did not see you speaking to her.\"\n\n\"But I did talk to her a great deal.\"\n\n\"And he is really going to marry that dreadful woman?\"\n\n\"Dreadful, mamma!\"\n\n\"Perfectly awful! She talked to me in a way that I have read about\nin books, but which I did not before believe to be possible. Do you\nmean that he is going to be married to that hideous old maid,--that\nbell-clapper?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, what slander! I think her so pretty.\"\n\n\"Pretty!\"\n\n\"Very pretty. And, mamma, ought I not to be happy that he should\nhave been able to make himself so happy? It was quite, quite, quite\nimpossible that I should have been his wife. I have thought about it\never so much, and I am so glad of it! I think she is just the girl\nthat is fit for him.\"\n\nLady Rowley took her candle and went to bed, professing to herself\nthat she could not understand it. But what did it signify? It was,\nat any rate, certain now that the man had put himself out of Nora's\nreach, and if he chose to marry a republican virago, with a red nose,\nit could now make no difference to Nora. Lady Rowley almost felt\na touch of satisfaction in reflecting on the future misery of his\nmarried life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\n\nCASALUNGA.\n\n\nSir Marmaduke had been told at the Florence post-office that he would\nno doubt be able to hear tidings of Trevelyan, and to learn his\naddress, from the officials in the post-office at Siena. At Florence\nhe had been introduced to some gentleman who was certainly of\nimportance,--a superintendent who had clerks under him and who was a\nbig man. This person had been very courteous to him, and he had gone\nto Siena thinking that he would find it easy to obtain Trevelyan's\naddress,--or to learn that there was no such person there. But at\nSiena he and his courier together could obtain no information. They\nrambled about the huge cathedral and the picturesque market-place\nof that quaint old city for the whole day, and on the next morning\nafter breakfast they returned to Florence. They had learned nothing.\nThe young man at the post-office had simply protested that he knew\nnothing of the name of Trevelyan. If letters should come addressed to\nsuch a name, he would keep them till they were called for; but, to\nthe best of his knowledge, he had never seen or heard the name. At\nthe guard-house of the gendarmerie they could not, or would not, give\nhim any information, and Sir Marmaduke came back with an impression\nthat everybody at Siena was ignorant, idiotic, and brutal. Mrs.\nTrevelyan was so dispirited as to be ill, and both Sir Marmaduke and\nLady Rowley were disposed to think that the world was all against\nthem. \"You have no conception of the sort of woman that man is going\nto marry,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"What man?\"\n\n\"Mr. Glascock! A horrid American female, as old almost as I am, who\ntalks through her nose, and preaches sermons about the rights of\nwomen. It is incredible! And Nora might have had him just for lifting\nup her hand.\" But Sir Marmaduke could not interest himself much about\nMr. Glascock. When he had been told that his daughter had refused the\nheir to a great estate and a peerage, it had been matter of regret;\nbut he had looked upon the affair as done, and cared nothing now\nthough Mr. Glascock should marry a transatlantic Xantippe. He was\nangry with Nora because by her obstinacy she was adding to the\ngeneral perplexities of the family, but he could not make comparisons\non Mr. Glascock's behalf between her and Miss Spalding,--as his wife\nwas doing, either mentally or aloud, from hour to hour. \"I suppose it\nis too late now,\" said Lady Rowley, shaking her head.\n\n\"Of course it is too late. The man must marry whom he pleases. I am\nbeginning to wonder that anybody should ever want to get married. I\nam indeed.\"\n\n\"But what are the girls to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know what anybody is to do. Here is a man as mad as a March\nhare, and yet nobody can touch him. If it was not for the child, I\nshould advise Emily to put him out of her head altogether.\"\n\nBut though Sir Marmaduke could not bring himself to take any interest\nin Mr. Glascock's affairs, and would not ask a single question\nrespecting the fearful American female whom this unfortunate man\nwas about to translate to the position of an English peeress, yet\ncircumstances so fell out that before three days were over he and\nMr. Glascock were thrown together in very intimate relations. Sir\nMarmaduke had learned that Mr. Glascock was the only Englishman in\nFlorence to whom Trevelyan had been known, and that he was the only\nperson with whom Trevelyan had been seen to speak while passing\nthrough the city. In his despair, therefore, Sir Marmaduke had gone\nto Mr. Glascock, and it was soon arranged that the two gentlemen\nshould renew the search at Siena together, without having with them\neither Mrs. Trevelyan or the courier. Mr. Glascock knew the ways\nof the people better than did Sir Marmaduke, and could speak the\nlanguage. He obtained a passport to the good offices of the police of\nSiena, and went prepared to demand rather than to ask for assistance.\nThey started very early, before breakfast, and on arriving at Siena\nat about noon, first employed themselves in recruiting exhausted\nnature. By the time that they had both declared that the hotel at\nSiena was the very worst in all Italy, and that a breakfast without\neatable butter was not to be considered a breakfast at all, they\nhad become so intimate that Mr. Glascock spoke of his own intended\nmarriage. He must have done this with the conviction on his mind that\nNora Rowley would have told her mother of his former intention, and\nthat Lady Rowley would have told Sir Marmaduke; but he did not feel\nit to be incumbent on himself to say anything on that subject. He had\nnothing to excuse. He had behaved fairly and honourably. It was not\nto be expected that he should remain unmarried for ever for the sake\nof a girl who had twice refused him. \"Of course there are very many\nin England,\" he said, \"who will think me foolish to marry a girl from\nanother country.\"\n\n\"It is done every day,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"No doubt it is. I admit, however, that I ought to be more careful\nthan some other persons. There is a title and an estate to be\nperpetuated, and I cannot, perhaps, be justified in taking quite so\nmuch liberty as some other men may do; but I think I have chosen a\nwoman born to have a high position, and who will make her own way in\nany society in which she may be placed.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt she will,\" said Sir Marmaduke, who had still\nsounding in his ears the alarming description which his wife had\ngiven him of this infatuated man's proposed bride. But he would have\nbeen bound to say as much had Mr. Glascock intended to marry as lowly\nas did King Cophetua.\n\n\"She is highly educated, gentle-mannered, as sweetly soft as any\nEnglish girl I ever met, and very pretty. You have met her, I think.\"\n\n\"I do not remember that I have observed her.\"\n\n\"She is too young for me, perhaps,\" said Mr. Glascock; \"but that is a\nfault on the right side.\" Sir Marmaduke, as he wiped his beard after\nhis breakfast, remembered what his wife had told him about the lady's\nage. But it was nothing to him. \"She is four-and-twenty, I think,\"\nsaid Mr. Glascock. If Mr. Glascock chose to believe that his intended\nwife was four-and-twenty instead of something over forty, that was\nnothing to Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"The very best age in the world,\" said he.\n\nThey had sent for an officer of the police, and before they had been\nthree hours in Siena they had been told that Trevelyan lived about\nseven miles from the town, in a small and very remote country house,\nwhich he had hired for twelve months from one of the city hospitals.\nHe had hired it furnished, and had purchased a horse and small\ncarriage from a man in the town. To this man they went, and it soon\nbecame evident to them that he of whom they were in search was living\nat this house, which was called Casalunga, and was not, as the police\nofficer told them, on the way to any place. They must leave Siena by\nthe road for Rome, take a turn to the left about a mile beyond the\ncity gate, and continue on along the country lane till they saw a\ncertain round hill to the right. On the top of that round hill was\nCasalunga. As the country about Siena all lies in round hills, this\nwas no adequate description;--but it was suggested that the country\npeople would know all about it. They got a small open carriage in\nthe market-place, and were driven out. Their driver knew nothing of\nCasalunga, and simply went whither he was told. But by the aid of the\ncountry people they got along over the unmade lanes, and in little\nmore than an hour were told, at the bottom of the hill, that they\nmust now walk up to Casalunga. Though the hill was round-topped, and\nno more than a hill, still the ascent at last was very steep, and\nwas paved with stones set edgeway in a manner that could hardly have\nbeen intended to accommodate wheels. When Mr. Glascock asserted that\nthe signor who lived there had a carriage of his own, the driver\nsuggested that he must keep it at the bottom of the hill. It was\nclearly not his intention to attempt to drive up the ascent, and Sir\nMarmaduke and Mr. Glascock were therefore obliged to walk. It was\nnow in the latter half of May, and there was a blazing Italian sky\nover their heads. Mr. Glascock was acclimated to Italian skies, and\ndid not much mind the work; but Sir Marmaduke, who never did much\nin walking, declared that Italy was infinitely hotter than the\nMandarins, and could hardly make his way as far as the house door.\n\nIt seemed to both of them to be a most singular abode for such a\nman as Trevelyan. At the top of the hill there was a huge entrance\nthrough a wooden gateway, which seemed to have been constructed with\nthe intention of defying any intruders not provided with warlike\nammunition. The gates were, indeed, open at the period of their\nvisit, but it must be supposed that they were intended to be closed\nat any rate at night. Immediately on the right, as they entered\nthrough the gates, there was a large barn, in which two men were\ncoopering wine vats. From thence a path led slanting to the house,\nof which the door was shut, and all the front windows blocked with\nshutters. The house was very long, and only of one story for a\nportion of its length. Over that end at which the door was placed\nthere were upper rooms, and there must have been space enough for a\nlarge family with many domestics. There was nothing round or near\nthe residence which could be called a garden, so that its look of\ndesolation was extreme. There were various large barns and outhouses,\nas though it had been intended by the builder that corn and hay and\ncattle should be kept there; but it seemed now that there was nothing\nthere except the empty vats at which the two men were coopering. Had\nthe Englishmen gone farther into the granary, they would have seen\nthat there were wine-presses stored away in the dark corners.\n\nThey stopped and looked at the men, and the men halted for a moment\nfrom their work and looked at them; but the men spoke never a word.\nMr. Glascock then asked after Mr. Trevelyan, and one of the coopers\npointed to the house. Then they crossed over to the door, and Mr.\nGlascock finding there neither knocker nor bell, first tapped with\nhis knuckles, and then struck with his stick. But no one came. There\nwas not a sound in the house, and no shutter was removed. \"I don't\nbelieve that there is a soul here,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"We'll not give it up till we've seen it all at any rate,\" said Mr.\nGlascock. And so they went round to the other front.\n\nOn this side of the house the tilled ground, either ploughed or dug\nwith the spade, came up to the very windows. There was hardly even\na particle of grass to be seen. A short way down the hill there\nwere rows of olive trees, standing in prim order and at regular\ndistances, from which hung the vines that made the coopering of\nthe vats necessary. Olives and vines have pretty names, and call\nup associations of landscape beauty. But here they were in no way\nbeautiful. The ground beneath them was turned up, and brown, and\narid, so that there was not a blade of grass to be seen. On some\nfurrows the maize or Indian corn was sprouting, and there were\npatches of growth of other kinds,--each patch closely marked by its\nown straight lines; and there were narrow paths, so constructed as to\ntake as little room as possible. But all that had been done had been\ndone for economy, and nothing for beauty. The occupiers of Casalunga\nhad thought more of the produce of their land than of picturesque or\nattractive appearance.\n\nThe sun was blazing fiercely hot, hotter on this side, Sir Marmaduke\nthought, even than on the other; and there was not a wavelet of a\ncloud in the sky. A balcony ran the whole length of the house, and\nunder this Sir Marmaduke took shelter at once, leaning with his back\nagainst the wall. \"There is not a soul here at all,\" said he.\n\n\"The men in the barn told us that there was,\" said Mr. Glascock;\n\"and, at any rate, we will try the windows.\" So saying, he walked\nalong the front of the house, Sir Marmaduke following him slowly,\ntill they came to a door, the upper half of which was glazed, and\nthrough which they looked into one of the rooms. Two or three of the\nother windows in this frontage of the house came down to the ground,\nand were made for egress and ingress; but they had all been closed\nwith shutters, as though the house was deserted. But they now looked\ninto a room which contained some signs of habitation. There was a\nsmall table with a marble top, on which lay two or three books, and\nthere were two arm-chairs in the room, with gilded arms and legs,\nand a morsel of carpet, and a clock on a shelf over a stove, and--a\nrocking-horse. \"The boy is here, you may be sure,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\"The rocking-horse makes that certain. But how are we to get at any\none!\"\n\n\"I never saw such a place for an Englishman to come and live in\nbefore,\" said Sir Marmaduke. \"What on earth can he do here all day!\"\nAs he spoke the door of the room was opened, and there was Trevelyan\nstanding before them, looking at them through the window. He wore an\nold red English dressing-gown, which came down to his feet, and a\nsmall braided Italian cap on his head. His beard had been allowed\nto grow, and he had neither collar nor cravat. His trousers were\nunbraced, and he shuffled in with a pair of slippers, which would\nhardly cling to his feet. He was paler and still thinner than when he\nhad been visited at Willesden, and his eyes seemed to be larger, and\nshone almost with a brighter brilliancy.\n\nMr. Glascock tried to open the door, but found that it was closed.\n\"Sir Marmaduke and I have come to visit you,\" said Mr. Glascock,\naloud. \"Is there any means by which we can get into the house?\"\nTrevelyan stood still and stared at them. \"We knocked at the front\ndoor, but nobody came,\" continued Mr. Glascock. \"I suppose this is\nthe way you usually go in and out.\"\n\n\"He does not mean to let us in,\" whispered Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Can you open this door,\" said Mr. Glascock, \"or shall we go round\nagain?\" Trevelyan had stood still contemplating them, but at last\ncame forward and put back the bolt. \"That is all right,\" said\nMr. Glascock, entering. \"I am sure you will be glad to see Sir\nMarmaduke.\"\n\n\"I should be glad to see him,--or you, if I could entertain you,\"\nsaid Trevelyan. His voice was harsh and hard, and his words were\nuttered with a certain amount of intended grandeur. \"Any of the\nfamily would be welcome were it not--\"\n\n\"Were it not what?\" asked Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"It can be nothing to you, sir, what troubles I have here. This is my\nown abode, in which I had flattered myself that I could be free from\nintruders. I do not want visitors. I am sorry that you should have\nhad trouble in coming here, but I do not want visitors. I am very\nsorry that I have nothing that I can offer you, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"Emily is in Florence,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Who brought her? Did I tell her to come? Let her go back to her\nhome. I have come here to be free from her, and I mean to be free. If\nshe wants my money, let her take it.\"\n\n\"She wants her child,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"He is my child,\" said Trevelyan, \"and my right to him is better than\nhers. Let her try it in a court of law, and she shall see. Why did\nshe deceive me with that man? Why has she driven me to this? Look\nhere, Mr. Glascock;--my whole life is spent in this seclusion, and it\nis her fault.\"\n\n\"Your wife is innocent of all fault, Trevelyan,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"Any woman can say as much as that;--and all women do say it.\nYet,--what are they worth?\"\n\n\"Do you mean, sir, to take away your wife's character?\" said Sir\nMarmaduke, coming up in wrath. \"Remember that she is my daughter, and\nthat there are things which flesh and blood cannot stand.\"\n\n\"She is my wife, sir, and that is ten times more. Do you think that\nyou would do more for her than I would do,--drink more of Esill? You\nhad better go away, Sir Marmaduke. You can do no good by coming here\nand talking of your daughter. I would have given the world to save\nher;--but she would not be saved.\"\n\n\"You are a slanderer!\" said Sir Marmaduke, in his wrath.\n\nMr. Glascock turned round to the father, and tried to quiet him. It\nwas so manifest to him that the balance of the poor man's mind was\ngone, that it seemed to him to be ridiculous to upbraid the sufferer.\nHe was such a piteous sight to behold, that it was almost impossible\nto feel indignation against him. \"You cannot wonder,\" said Mr.\nGlascock, advancing close to the master of the house, \"that the\nmother should want to see her only child. You do not wish that your\nwife should be the most wretched woman in the world.\"\n\n\"Am not I the most wretched of men? Can anything be more wretched\nthan this? Is her life worse than mine? And whose fault was it? Had\nI any friend to whom she objected? Was I untrue to her in a single\nthought?\"\n\n\"If you say that she was untrue, it is a falsehood,\" said Sir\nMarmaduke.\n\n\"You allow yourself a liberty of expression, sir, because you are my\nwife's father,\" said Trevelyan, \"which you would not dare to take in\nother circumstances.\"\n\n\"I say that it is a false calumny,--a lie! and I would say so to any\nman on earth who should dare to slander my child's name.\"\n\n\"Your child, sir! She is my wife;--my wife;--my wife!\" Trevelyan, as\nhe spoke, advanced close up to his father-in-law; and at last hissed\nout his words, with his lips close to Sir Marmaduke's face. \"Your\nright in her is gone, sir. She is mine,--mine,--mine! And you see the\nway in which she has treated me, Mr. Glascock. Everything I had was\nhers; but the words of a grey-haired sinner were sweeter to her than\nall my love. I wonder whether you think that it is a pleasant thing\nfor such a one as I to come out here and live in such a place as\nthis? I have not a friend,--a companion,--hardly a book. There is\nnothing that I can eat or drink. I do not stir out of the house,--and\nI am ill;--very ill! Look at me. See what she has brought me to! Mr.\nGlascock, on my honour as a man, I never wronged her in a thought or\na word.\"\n\nMr. Glascock had come to think that his best chance of doing any good\nwas to get Trevelyan into conversation with himself, free from the\ninterruption of Sir Marmaduke. The father of the injured woman could\nnot bring himself to endure the hard words that were spoken of his\ndaughter. During this last speech he had broken out once or twice;\nbut Trevelyan, not heeding him, had clung to Mr. Glascock's arm. \"Sir\nMarmaduke,\" said he, \"would you not like to see the boy?\"\n\n\"He shall not see the boy,\" said Trevelyan. \"You may see him. He\nshall not. What is he that he should have control over me?\"\n\n\"This is the most fearful thing I ever heard of,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\"What are we to do with him?\"\n\nMr. Glascock whispered a few words to Sir Marmaduke, and then\ndeclared that he was ready to be taken to the child. \"And he will\nremain here?\" asked Trevelyan. A pledge was then given by Sir\nMarmaduke that he would not force his way farther into the house,\nand the two other men left the chamber together. Sir Marmaduke,\nas he paced up and down the room alone, perspiring at every pore,\nthoroughly uncomfortable and ill at ease, thought of all the hard\npositions of which he had ever read, and that his was harder than\nthem all. Here was a man married to his daughter, in possession of\nhis daughter's child, manifestly mad,--and yet he could do nothing\nto him! He was about to return to the seat of his government, and\nhe must leave his own child in this madman's power! Of course, his\ndaughter could not go with him, leaving her child in this madman's\nhands. He had been told that even were he to attempt to prove the man\nto be mad in Italy, the process would be slow; and, before it could\nbe well commenced, Trevelyan would be off with the child elsewhere.\nThere never was an embarrassment, thought Sir Marmaduke, out of which\nit was so impossible to find a clear way.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Glascock and Trevelyan were visiting the child.\nIt was evident that the father, let him be ever so mad, had discerned\nthe expediency of allowing some one to see that his son was alive\nand in health. Mr. Glascock did not know much of children, and could\nonly say afterwards that the boy was silent and very melancholy, but\nclean, and apparently well. It appeared that he was taken out daily\nby his father in the cool hours of the morning, and that his father\nhardly left him from the time that he was taken up till he was put to\nbed. But Mr. Glascock's desire was to see Trevelyan alone, and this\nhe did after they had left the boy. \"And now, Trevelyan,\" he said,\n\"what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"To do?\"\n\n\"In what way do you propose to live? I want you to be reasonable with\nme.\"\n\n\"They do not treat me reasonably.\"\n\n\"Are you going to measure your own conduct by that of other people?\nIn the first place, you should go back to England. What good can you\ndo here?\" Trevelyan shook his head, but remained silent. \"You cannot\nlike this life.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. But whither can I go now that I shall like to live?\"\n\n\"Why not home?\"\n\n\"I have no home.\"\n\n\"Why not go back to England? Ask your wife to join you, and return\nwith her. She would go at a word.\" The poor wretch again shook\nhis head. \"I hope you think that I speak as your friend,\" said Mr.\nGlascock.\n\n\"I believe you do.\"\n\n\"I will say nothing of any imprudence; but you cannot believe that\nshe has been untrue to you?\" Trevelyan would say nothing to this, but\nstood silent waiting for Mr. Glascock to continue. \"Let her come back\nto you--here; and then, as soon as you can arrange it, go to your own\nhome.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you something?\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nHe came up close to Mr. Glascock, and put his hand upon his visitor's\nshoulder. \"I will tell you what she would do at once. I dare say that\nshe would come to me. I dare say that she would go with me. I am\nsure she would. And directly she got me there, she would--say that I\nwas--mad! She,--my wife, would do it! He,--that furious, ignorant old\nman below, tried to do it before. His wife said that I was mad.\" He\npaused a moment, as though waiting for a reply; but Mr. Glascock had\nnone to make. It had not been his object, in the advice which he had\ngiven, to entrap the poor fellow by a snare, and to induce him so to\nact that he should deliver himself up to keepers; but he was well\naware that wherever Trevelyan might be, it would be desirable that he\nshould be placed for awhile in the charge of some physician. He could\nnot bring himself at the spur of the moment to repudiate the idea by\nwhich Trevelyan was actuated. \"Perhaps you think that she would be\nright?\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"I am quite sure that she would do nothing that is not for the best,\"\nsaid Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"I can see it all. I will not go back to England, Mr. Glascock. I\nintend to travel. I shall probably leave this and go to--to--to\nGreece, perhaps. It is a healthy place, this, and I like it for that\nreason; but I shall not stay here. If my wife likes to travel with\nme, she can come. But,--to England I will not go.\"\n\n\"You will let the child go to his mother?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. If she wants to see the child, he is here. If she\nwill come,--without her father,--she shall see him. She shall not\ntake him from hence. Nor shall she return to live with me, without\nfull acknowledgment of her fault, and promises of an amended life. I\nknow what I am saying, Mr. Glascock, and have thought of these things\nperhaps more than you have done. I am obliged to you for coming to\nme; but now, if you please, I would prefer to be alone.\"\n\nMr. Glascock, seeing that nothing further could be done, joined Sir\nMarmaduke, and the two walked down to their carriage at the bottom of\nthe hill. Mr. Glascock, as he went, declared his conviction that the\nunfortunate man was altogether mad, and that it would be necessary\nto obtain some interference on the part of the authorities for the\nprotection of the child. How this could be done, or whether it\ncould be done in time to intercept a further flight on the part of\nTrevelyan, Mr. Glascock could not say. It was his idea that Mrs.\nTrevelyan should herself go out to Casalunga, and try the force of\nher own persuasion.\n\n\"I believe that he would murder her,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"He would not do that. There is a glimmer of sense in all his\nmadness, which will keep him from any actual violence.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\n\n\"I CAN SLEEP ON THE BOARDS.\"\n\n\nThree days after this there came another carriage to the bottom of\nthe hill on which Casalunga stood, and a lady got out of it all\nalone. It was Emily Trevelyan, and she had come thither from Siena\nin quest of her husband and her child. On the previous day Sir\nMarmaduke's courier had been at the house with a note from the\nwife to the husband, and had returned with an answer, in which\nMrs. Trevelyan was told that, if she would come quite alone, she\nshould see her child. Sir Marmaduke had been averse to any further\nintercourse with the man, other than what might be made in accordance\nwith medical advice, and, if possible, with government authority.\nLady Rowley had assented to her daughter's wish, but had suggested\nthat she should at least be allowed to go also,--at any rate, as\nfar as the bottom of the hill. But Emily had been very firm, and Mr.\nGlascock had supported her. He was confident that the man would do no\nharm to her, and he was indisposed to believe that any interference\non the part of the Italian Government could be procured in such a\ncase with sufficient celerity to be of use. He still thought it might\nbe possible that the wife might prevail over the husband, or the\nmother over the father. Sir Marmaduke was at last obliged to yield,\nand Mrs. Trevelyan went to Siena with no other companion but the\ncourier. From Siena she made the journey quite alone; and having\nlearned the circumstances of the house from Mr. Glascock, she got out\nof the carriage, and walked up the hill. There were still the two men\ncoopering at the vats, but she did not stay to speak to them. She\nwent through the big gates, and along the slanting path to the door,\nnot doubting of her way;--for Mr. Glascock had described it all to\nher, making a small plan of the premises, and even explaining to her\nthe position of the room in which her boy and her husband slept. She\nfound the door open, and an Italian maid-servant at once welcomed\nher to the house, and assured her that the signor would be with her\nimmediately. She was sure that the girl knew that she was the boy's\nmother, and was almost tempted to ask questions at once as to the\nstate of the household; but her knowledge of Italian was slight, and\nshe felt that she was so utterly a stranger in the land that she\ncould dare to trust no one. Though the heat was great, her face was\ncovered with a thick veil. Her dress was black, from head to foot,\nand she was as a woman who mourned for her husband. She was led into\nthe room which her father had been allowed to enter through the\nwindow; and here she sat, in her husband's house, feeling that in no\nposition in the world could she be more utterly separated from the\ninterests of all around her. In a few minutes the door was opened,\nand her husband was with her, bringing the boy in his hand. He had\ndressed himself with some care; but it may be doubted whether the\ngarments which he wore did not make him appear thinner even and more\nhaggard than he had looked to be in his old dressing-gown. He had not\nshaved himself, but his long hair was brushed back from his forehead,\nafter a fashion quaint and very foreign to his former ideas of\ndress. His wife had not expected that her child would come to her\nat once,--had thought that some entreaties would be necessary, some\nobedience perhaps exacted from her, before she would be allowed to\nsee him; and now her heart was softened, and she was grateful to her\nhusband. But she could not speak to him till she had had the boy in\nher arms. She tore off her bonnet, and then clinging to the child,\ncovered him with kisses. \"Louey, my darling! Louey; you remember\nmamma?\" The child pressed himself close to the mother's bosom, but\nspoke never a word. He was cowed and overcome, not only by the\nincidents of the moment, but by the terrible melancholy of his\nwhole life. He had been taught to understand, without actual spoken\nlessons, that he was to live with his father, and that the former\nwoman-given happinesses of his life were at an end. In this second\nvisit from his mother he did not forget her. He recognised the luxury\nof her love; but it did not occur to him even to hope that she might\nhave come to rescue him from the evil of his days. Trevelyan was\nstanding by, the while, looking on; but he did not speak till she\naddressed him.\n\n\"I am so thankful to you for bringing him to me,\" she said.\n\n\"I told you that you should see him,\" he said. \"Perhaps it might have\nbeen better that I should have sent him by a servant; but there are\ncircumstances which make me fear to let him out of my sight.\"\n\n\"Do you think that I did not wish to see you also? Louis, why do\nyou do me so much wrong? Why do you treat me with such cruelty?\"\nThen she threw her arms round his neck, and before he could repulse\nher,--before he could reflect whether it would be well that he should\nrepulse her or not,--she had covered his brow and cheeks and lips\nwith kisses. \"Louis,\" she said; \"Louis, speak to me!\"\n\n\"It is hard to speak sometimes,\" he said.\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"It is hard to speak sometimes.\"]\n\n\n\"You love me, Louis?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I love you. But I am afraid of you!\"\n\n\"What is it that you fear? I would give my life for you, if you would\nonly come back to me and let me feel that you believed me to be\ntrue.\" He shook his head, and began to think,--while she still clung\nto him. He was quite sure that her father and mother had intended to\nbring a mad doctor down upon him, and he knew that his wife was in\nher mother's hands. Should he yield to her now,--should he make her\nany promise,--might not the result be that he would be shut up in\ndark rooms, robbed of his liberty, robbed of what he loved better\nthan his liberty,--his power as a man. She would thus get the better\nof him and take the child, and the world would say that in this\ncontest between him and her he had been the sinning one, and she the\none against whom the sin had been done. It was the chief object of\nhis mind, the one thing for which he was eager, that this should\nnever come to pass. Let it once be conceded to him from all sides\nthat he had been right, and then she might do with him almost as she\nwilled. He knew well that he was ill. When he thought of his child,\nhe would tell himself that he was dying. He was at some moments of\nhis miserable existence fearfully anxious to come to terms with his\nwife, in order that at his death his boy might not be without a\nprotector. Were he to die, then it would be better that his child\nshould be with its mother. In his happy days, immediately after\nhis marriage, he had made a will, in which he had left his entire\nproperty to his wife for her life, providing for its subsequent\ndescent to his child,--or children. It had never even occurred to his\npoor shattered brain that it would be well for him to alter his will.\nHad he really believed that his wife had betrayed him, doubtless he\nwould have done so. He would have hated her, have distrusted her\naltogether, and have believed her to be an evil thing. He had no such\nbelief. But in his desire to achieve empire, and in the sorrows which\nhad come upon him in his unsuccessful struggle, his mind had wavered\nso frequently, that his spoken words were no true indicators of his\nthoughts; and in all his arguments he failed to express either his\nconvictions or his desires. When he would say something stronger than\nhe intended, and it would be put to him by his wife, by her father or\nmother, or by some friend of hers, whether he did believe that she\nhad been untrue to him, he would recoil from the answer which his\nheart would dictate, lest he should seem to make an acknowledgment\nthat might weaken the ground upon which he stood. Then he would\nsatisfy his own conscience by assuring himself that he had never\naccused her of such sin. She was still clinging to him now as his\nmind was working after this fashion. \"Louis,\" she said, \"let it all\nbe as though there had been nothing.\"\n\n\"How can that be, my dear?\"\n\n\"Not to others;--but to us it can be so. There shall be no word\nspoken of the past.\" Again he shook his head. \"Will it not be best\nthat there should be no word spoken?\"\n\n\"'Forgiveness may be spoken with the tongue,'\" he said, beginning to\nquote from a poem which had formerly been frequent in his hands.\n\n\"Cannot there be real forgiveness between you and me,--between\nhusband and wife who, in truth, love each other? Do you think that I\nwould tell you of it again?\" He felt that in all that she said there\nwas an assumption that she had been right, and that he had been\nwrong. She was promising to forgive. She was undertaking to forget.\nShe was willing to take him back to the warmth of her love, and the\ncomfort of her kindness,--but was not asking to be taken back. This\nwas what he could not and would not endure. He had determined that\nif she behaved well to him, he would not be harsh to her, and he\nwas struggling to keep up to his resolve. He would accuse her of\nnothing,--if he could help it. But he could not say a word that would\neven imply that she need forget,--that she should forgive. It was for\nhim to forgive;--and he was willing to do it, if she would accept\nforgiveness. \"I will never speak a word, Louis,\" she said, laying her\nhead upon his shoulder.\n\n\"Your heart is still hardened,\" he replied slowly.\n\n\"Hard to you?\"\n\n\"And your mind is dark. You do not see what you have done. In our\nreligion, Emily, forgiveness is sure, not after penitence, but with\nrepentance.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means this, that though I would welcome you back to my arms with\njoy, I cannot do so, till you have--confessed your fault.\"\n\n\"What fault, Louis? If I have made you unhappy, I do, indeed, grieve\nthat it has been so.\"\n\n\"It is of no use,\" said he. \"I cannot talk about it. Do you suppose\nthat it does not tear me to the very soul to think of it?\"\n\n\"What is it that you think, Louis?\" As she had been travelling\nthither, she had determined that she would say anything that he\nwished her to say,--make any admission that might satisfy him. That\nshe could be happy again as other women are happy, she did not\nexpect; but if it could be conceded between them that bygones should\nbe bygones, she might live with him and do her duty, and, at least,\nhave her child with her. Her father had told her that her husband was\nmad; but she was willing to put up with his madness on such terms as\nthese. What could her husband do to her in his madness that he could\nnot do also to the child? \"Tell me what you want me to say, and I\nwill say it,\" she said.\n\n\"You have sinned against me,\" he said, raising her head gently from\nhis shoulder.\n\n\"Never!\" she exclaimed. \"As God is my judge, I never have!\" As she\nsaid this, she retreated and took the sobbing boy again into her\narms.\n\nHe was at once placed upon his guard, telling himself that he saw the\nnecessity of holding by his child. How could he tell? Might there not\nbe a policeman down from Florence, ready round the house, to seize\nthe boy and carry him away? Though all his remaining life should be\na torment to him, though infinite plagues should be poured upon his\nhead, though he should die like a dog, alone, unfriended, and in\ndespair, while he was fighting this battle of his, he would not give\nway. \"That is sufficient,\" he said. \"Louey must return now to his own\nchamber.\"\n\n\"I may go with him?\"\n\n\"No, Emily. You cannot go with him now. I will thank you to release\nhim, that I may take him.\" She still held the little fellow closely\npressed in her arms. \"Do not reward me for my courtesy by further\ndisobedience,\" he said.\n\n\"You will let me come again?\" To this he made no reply. \"Tell me that\nI may come again.\"\n\n\"I do not think that I shall remain here long.\"\n\n\"And I may not stay now?\"\n\n\"That would be impossible. There is no accommodation for you.\"\n\n\"I could sleep on the boards beside his cot,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"That is my place,\" he replied. \"You may know that he is not\ndisregarded. With my own hands I tend him every morning. I take him\nout myself. I feed him myself. He says his prayers to me. He learns\nfrom me, and can say his letters nicely. You need not fear for him.\nNo mother was ever more tender with her child than I am with him.\"\nThen he gently withdrew the boy from her arms, and she let her child\ngo, lest he should learn to know that there was a quarrel between\nhis father and his mother. \"If you will excuse me,\" he said, \"I will\nnot come down to you again to-day. My servant will see you to your\ncarriage.\"\n\nSo he left her; and she, with an Italian girl at her heels, got into\nher vehicle, and was taken back to Siena. There she passed the night\nalone at the inn, and on the next morning returned to Florence by the\nrailway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX.\n\n\"WILL THEY DESPISE HIM?\"\n\n\nGradually the news of the intended marriage between Mr. Glascock and\nMiss Spalding spread itself over Florence, and people talked about\nit with that energy which subjects of such moment certainly deserve.\nThat Caroline Spalding had achieved a very great triumph, was, of\ncourse, the verdict of all men and of all women; and I fear that\nthere was a corresponding feeling that poor Mr. Glascock had been\ntriumphed over, and as it were, subjugated. In some respects he had\nbeen remiss in his duties as a bachelor visitor to Florence,--as a\nvisitor to Florence who had manifestly been much in want of a wife.\nHe had not given other girls a fair chance, but had thrown himself\ndown at the feet of this American female in the weakest possible\nmanner. And then it got about the town that he had been refused over\nand over again by Nora Rowley. It is too probable that Lady Rowley\nin her despair and dismay had been indiscreet, and had told secrets\nwhich should never have been mentioned by her. And the wife of\nthe English minister, who had some grudges of her own, lifted her\neyebrows and shook her head and declared that all the Glascocks at\nhome would be outraged to the last degree. \"My dear Lady Rowley,\"\nshe said, \"I don't know whether it won't become a question with them\nwhether they should issue a commission de lunatico.\" Lady Rowley did\nnot know what a commission de lunatico meant, but was quite willing\nto regard poor Mr. Glascock as a lunatic. \"And there is poor Lord\nPeterborough at Naples just at death's door,\" continued the British\nMinister's wife. In this she was perhaps nearly correct; but as Lord\nPeterborough had now been in the same condition for many months, as\nhis mind had altogether gone, and as the doctor declared that he\nmight live in his present condition for a year, or for years, it\ncould not fairly be said that Mr. Glascock was acting without due\nfilial feeling in engaging himself to marry a young lady. \"And she\nsuch a creature!\" said Lady Rowley, with emphasis. This the British\nMinister's wife noticed simply by shaking her head. Caroline Spalding\nwas undoubtedly a pretty girl; but, as the British Minister's wife\nsaid afterwards, it was not surprising that poor Lady Rowley should\nbe nearly out of her mind.\n\nThis had occurred a full week after the evening spent at Mr.\nSpalding's house; and even yet Lady Rowley had never been put right\nas to that mistake of hers about Wallachia Petrie. That other trouble\nof hers, and her eldest daughter's journey to Siena, had prevented\nthem from going out; and though the matter had often been discussed\nbetween Lady Rowley and Nora, there had not as yet come between them\nany proper explanation. Nora would declare that the future bride\nwas very pretty and very delightful; and Lady Rowley would throw up\nher hands in despair and protest that her daughter was insane. \"Why\nshould he not marry whom he likes, mamma?\" Nora once said, almost\nwith indignation.\n\n\"Because he will disgrace his family.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand what you mean, mamma. They are, at any rate, as\ngood as we are. Mr. Spalding stands quite as high as papa does.\"\n\n\"She is an American,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"And her family might say that he is an Englishman,\" said Nora.\n\n\"My dear, if you do not understand the incongruity between an English\npeer and a Yankee--female, I cannot help you. I suppose it is because\nyou have been brought up within the limited society of a small\ncolony. If so, it is not your fault. But I had hoped you had been in\nEurope long enough to have learned what was what. Do you think, my\ndear, that she will look well when she is presented to her Majesty as\nLord Peterborough's wife?\"\n\n\"Splendid,\" said Nora. \"She has just the brow for a coronet.\"\n\n\"Heavens and earth!\" said Lady Rowley, throwing up her hands. \"And\nyou believe that he will be proud of her in England?\"\n\n\"I am sure he will.\"\n\n\"My belief is that he will leave her behind him, or that they\nwill settle somewhere in the wilds of America,--out in Mexico, or\nMassachusetts, or the Rocky Mountains. I do not think that he will\nhave the courage to shew her in London.\"\n\nThe marriage was to take place in the Protestant church at Florence\nearly in June, and then the bride and bridegroom were to go over the\nAlps, and to remain there subject to tidings as to the health of the\nold man at Naples. Mr. Glascock had thrown up his seat in Parliament,\nsome month or two ago, knowing that he could not get back to his\nduties during the present session, and feeling that he would shortly\nbe called upon to sit in the other House. He was thus free to use his\ntime and to fix his days as he pleased; and it was certainly clear to\nthose who knew him, that he was not ashamed of his American bride.\nHe spent much of his time at the Spaldings' house, and was always\nto be seen with them in the Cascine and at the Opera. Mrs. Spalding,\nthe aunt, was, of course, in great glory. A triumphant, happy, or\neven simply a splendid marriage, for the rising girl of a family is\na great glory to the maternal mind. Mrs. Spalding could not but be\naware that the very air around her seemed to breathe congratulations\ninto her ears. Her friends spoke to her, even on indifferent\nsubjects, as though everything was going well with her,--better with\nher than with anybody else; and there came upon her in these days\na dangerous feeling, that in spite of all the preachings of the\npreachers, the next world might perhaps be not so very much better\nthan this. She was, in fact, the reverse of the medal of which\npoor Lady Rowley filled the obverse. And the American Minister was\ncertainly an inch taller than before, and made longer speeches, being\nmuch more regardless of interruption. Olivia was delighted at her\nsister's success, and heard with rapture the description of Monkhams,\nwhich came to her second-hand through her sister. It was already\nsettled that she was to spend her next Christmas at Monkhams, and\nperhaps there might be an idea in her mind that there were other\neldest sons of old lords who would like American brides. Everything\naround Caroline Spalding was pleasant,--except the words of Wallachia\nPetrie.\n\nEverything around her was pleasant till there came to her a touch of\na suspicion that the marriage which Mr. Glascock was going to make\nwould be detrimental to her intended husband in his own country.\nThere were many in Florence who were saying this besides the wife of\nthe English Minister and Lady Rowley. Of course Caroline Spalding\nherself was the last to hear it, and to her the idea was brought\nby Wallachia Petrie. \"I wish I could think you would make yourself\nhappy,--or him,\" Wallachia had said, croaking.\n\n\"Why should I fail to make him happy?\"\n\n\"Because you are not of the same blood, or race, or manners as\nhimself. They say that he is very wealthy in his own country, and\nthat those who live around him will look coldly on you.\"\n\n\"So that he does not look coldly, I do not care how others may look,\"\nsaid Caroline proudly.\n\n\"But when he finds that he has injured himself by such a marriage in\nthe estimation of all his friends,--how will it be then?\"\n\nThis set Caroline Spalding thinking of what she was doing. She began\nto realise the feeling that perhaps she might not be a fit bride for\nan English lord's son, and in her agony she came to Nora Rowley for\ncounsel. After all, how little was it that she knew of the home and\nthe country to which she was to be carried! She might not, perhaps,\nget adequate advice from Nora, but she would probably learn something\non which she could act. There was no one else among the English at\nFlorence to whom she could speak with freedom. When she mentioned her\nfears to her aunt, her aunt of course laughed at her. Mrs. Spalding\ntold her that Mr. Glascock might be presumed to know his own business\nbest, and that she, as an American lady of high standing,--the niece\nof a minister!--was a fitting match for any Englishman, let him be\never so much a lord. But Caroline was not comforted by this, and in\nher suspense she went to Nora Rowley. She wrote a line to Nora, and\nwhen she called at the hotel, was taken up to her friend's bed-room.\nShe found great difficulty in telling her story, but she did tell it.\n\"Miss Rowley,\" she said, \"if this is a silly thing that he is going\nto do, I am bound to save him from his own folly. You know your own\ncountry better than I do. Will they think that he has disgraced\nhimself?\"\n\n\"Certainly not that,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Shall I be a load round his neck? Miss Rowley, for my own sake I\nwould not endure such a position as that, not even though I love him.\nBut for his sake! Think of that. If I find that people think ill of\nhim,--because of me--!\"\n\n\"No one will think ill of him.\"\n\n\"Is it esteemed needful that such a one as he should marry a woman of\nhis own rank? I can bear to end it all now; but I shall not be able\nto bear his humiliation, and my own despair, if I find that I have\ninjured him. Tell me plainly,--is it a marriage that he should not\nmake?\" Nora paused for a while before she answered, and as she sat\nsilent the other girl watched her face carefully. Nora on being thus\nconsulted, was very careful that her tongue should utter nothing that\nwas not her true opinion as best she knew how to express it. Her\nsympathy would have prompted her to give such an answer as would\nat once have made Caroline happy in her mind. She would have been\ndelighted to have been able to declare that these doubts were utterly\ngroundless, and this hesitation needless. But she conceived that she\nowed it as a duty from one woman to another to speak the truth as she\nconceived it on so momentous an occasion, and she was not sure but\nthat Mr. Glascock would be considered by his friends in England to be\ndoing badly in marrying an American girl. What she did not remember\nwas this,--that her very hesitation was in fact an answer, and such\nan answer as she was most unwilling to give. \"I see that it would be\nso,\" said Caroline Spalding.\n\n\"No;--not that.\"\n\n\"What then? Will they despise him,--and me?\"\n\n\"No one who knows you can despise you. No one who sees you can fail\nto admire you.\" Nora, as she said this, thought of her mother, but\ntold herself at once that in this matter her mother's judgment had\nbeen altogether destroyed by her disappointment. \"What I think will\ntake place will be this. His family, when first they hear of it, will\nbe sorry.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Caroline, \"I will put an end to it.\"\n\n\"You can't do that, dear. You are engaged, and you haven't a right.\nI am engaged to a man, and all my friends object to it. But I shan't\nput an end to it. I don't think I have a right. I shall not do it any\nway, however.\"\n\n\"But if it were for his good?\"\n\n\"It couldn't be for his good. He and I have got to go along together\nsomehow.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't hurt him,\" said Caroline.\n\n\"I won't if I can help it, but he has got to take me along with him\nany how; and Mr. Glascock has got to take you. If I were you, I\nshouldn't ask any more questions.\"\n\n\"It isn't the same. You said that you were to be poor, but he is very\nrich. And I am beginning to understand that these titles of yours are\nsomething like kings' crowns. The man who has to wear them can't do\njust as he pleases with them. Noblesse oblige. I can see the meaning\nof that, even when the obligation itself is trumpery in its nature.\nIf it is a man's duty to marry a Talbot because he's a Howard, I\nsuppose he ought to do his duty.\" After a pause she went on again. \"I\ndo believe that I have made a mistake. It seemed to be absurd at the\nfirst to think of it, but I do believe it now. Even what you say to\nme makes me think it.\"\n\n\"At any rate you can't go back,\" said Nora enthusiastically.\n\n\"I will try.\"\n\n\"Go to himself and ask him. You must leave him to decide it at last.\nI don't see how a girl when she is engaged, is to throw a man over\nunless he consents. Of course you can throw yourself into the Arno.\"\n\n\"And get the water into my shoes,--for it wouldn't do much more at\npresent.\"\n\n\"And you can--jilt him,\" said Nora.\n\n\"It would not be jilting him.\"\n\n\"He must decide that. If he so regards it, it will be so. I advise\nyou to think no more about it; but if you speak to anybody it should\nbe to him.\" This was at last the result of Nora's wisdom, and then\nthe two girls descended together to the room in which Lady Rowley was\nsitting with her other daughters. Lady Rowley was very careful in\nasking after Miss Spalding's sister, and Miss Spalding assured her\nthat Olivia was quite well. Then Lady Rowley made some inquiry about\nOlivia and Mr. Glascock, and Miss Spalding assured her that no two\npersons were ever such allies, and that she believed that they were\ntogether at this moment investigating some old church. Lady Rowley\nsimpered, and declared that nothing could be more proper, and\nexpressed a hope that Olivia would like England. Caroline Spalding,\nhaving still in her mind the trouble that had brought her to Nora,\nhad not much to say about this. \"If she goes again to England I am\nsure she will like it,\" replied Miss Spalding.\n\n\"But of course she is going,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Of course she will some day, and of course she'll like it,\" said\nMiss Spalding. \"We both of us have been there already.\"\n\n\"But I mean Monkhams,\" said Lady Rowley, still simpering.\n\n\"I declare I believe mamma thinks that your sister is to be married\nto Mr. Glascock!\" said Lucy.\n\n\"And so she is;--isn't she?\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\" said Nora, jumping up. \"It is Caroline;--this one,\nthis one, this one,\"--and Nora took her friend by the arm as she\nspoke,--\"it is this one that is to be Mrs. Glascock.\"\n\n\"It is a most natural mistake to make,\" said Caroline.\n\nLady Rowley became very red in the face, and was unhappy. \"I\ndeclare,\" she said, \"that they told me it was your elder sister.\"\n\n\"But I have no elder sister,\" said Caroline, laughing.\n\n\"Of course she is oldest,\" said Nora,--\"and looks to be so, ever so\nmuch. Don't you, Miss Spalding?\"\n\n\"I have always supposed so.\"\n\n\"I don't understand it at all,\" said Lady Rowley, who had no image\nbefore her mind's eye but that of Wallachia Petrie, and who was\nbeginning to feel that she had disgraced her own judgment by the\ncriticisms she had expressed everywhere as to Mr. Glascock's bride.\n\"I don't understand it at all. Do you mean that both your sisters are\nyounger than you, Miss Spalding?\"\n\n\"I have only got one, Lady Rowley.\"\n\n\"Mamma, you are thinking of Miss Petrie,\" said Nora, clapping both\nher hands together.\n\n\"I mean the lady that wears the black bugles.\"\n\n\"Of course you do;--Miss Petrie. Mamma has all along thought that Mr.\nGlascock was going to carry away with him the republican Browning!\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, how can you have made such a blunder!\" said Sophie\nRowley. \"Mamma does make such delicious blunders.\"\n\n\"Sophie, my dear, that is not a proper way of speaking.\"\n\n\"But, dear mamma, don't you?\"\n\n\"If somebody has told me wrong, that has not been my fault,\" said\nLady Rowley.\n\nThe poor woman was so evidently disconcerted that Caroline Spalding\nwas quite unhappy. \"My dear Lady Rowley, there has been no fault. And\nwhy shouldn't it have been so? Wallachia is so clever, that it is the\nmost natural thing in the world to have thought.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I agree with you there,\" said Lady Rowley,\nsomewhat recovering herself.\n\n\"You must know the whole truth now,\" said Nora, turning to her\nfriend, \"and you must not be angry with us if we laugh a little at\nyour poetess. Mamma has been frantic with Mr. Glascock because he has\nbeen going to marry,--whom shall I say,--her edition of you. She has\nsworn that he must be insane. When we have sworn how beautiful you\nwere, and how nice, and how jolly, and all the rest of it,--she has\nsworn that you were at least a hundred, and that you had a red nose.\nYou must admit that Miss Petrie has a red nose.\"\n\n\"Is that a sin?\"\n\n\"Not at all in the woman who has it; but in the man who is going to\nmarry it,--yes. Can't you see how we have all been at cross-purposes,\nand what mamma has been thinking and saying of poor Mr. Glascock?\nYou mustn't repeat it, of course; but we have had such a battle here\nabout it. We thought that mamma had lost her eyes and her ears and\nher knowledge of things in general. And now it has all come out! You\nwon't be angry?\"\n\n\"Why should I be angry?\"\n\n\"Miss Spalding,\" said Lady Rowley, \"I am really unhappy at what has\noccurred, and I hope that there may be nothing more said about it.\nI am quite sure that somebody told me wrong, or I should not have\nfallen into such an error. I beg your pardon,--and Mr. Glascock's!\"\n\n\"Beg Mr. Glascock's pardon, certainly,\" said Lucy.\n\nMiss Spalding looked very pretty, smiled very gracefully, and coming\nup to Lady Rowley to say good-bye, kissed her on her cheeks. This\novercame the spirit of the disappointed mother, and Lady Rowley never\nsaid another word against Caroline Spalding or her marriage. \"Now,\nmamma, what do you think of her?\" said Nora, as soon as Caroline was\ngone.\n\n\"Was it odd, my dear, that I should be astonished at his wanting to\nmarry that other woman?\"\n\n\"But, mamma, when we told you that she was young and pretty and\nbright!\"\n\n\"I thought that you were all demented. I did indeed. I still think it\na pity that he should take an American. I think that Miss Spalding is\nvery nice, but there are English girls quite as nice-looking as her.\"\nAfter that there was not another word said by Lady Rowley against\nCaroline Spalding.\n\nNora, when she thought of it all that night, felt that she had hardly\nspoken to Miss Spalding as she should have spoken as to the treatment\nin England which would be accorded to Mr. Glascock's wife. She became\naware of the effect which her own hesitation must have had, and\nthought that it was her duty to endeavour to remove it. Perhaps, too,\nthe conversion of her mother had some effect in making her feel that\nshe had been wrong in supposing that there would be any difficulty\nin Caroline's position in England. She had heard so much adverse\ncriticism from her mother that she had doubted in spite of\nher own convictions;--but now it had come to light that Lady\nRowley's criticisms had all come from a most absurd blunder. \"Only\nfancy;\"--she said to herself;--\"Miss Petrie coming out as Lady\nPeterborough! Poor mamma!\" And then she thought of the reception\nwhich would be given to Caroline, and of the place the future Lady\nPeterborough would fill in the world, and of the glories of Monkhams!\nResolving that she would do her best to counteract any evil which\nshe might have done, she seated herself at her desk, and wrote the\nfollowing letter to Miss Spalding:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR CAROLINE,\n\n   I am sure you will let me call you so, as had you not felt\n   towards me like a friend, you would not have come to me\n   to-day and told me of your doubts. I think that I did not\n   answer you as I ought to have done when you spoke to me.\n   I did not like to say anything off-hand, and in that way\n   I misled you. I feel quite sure that you will encounter\n   nothing in England as Mr. Glascock's wife to make you\n   uncomfortable, and that he will have nothing to repent.\n   Of course Englishmen generally marry Englishwomen; and,\n   perhaps, there may be some people who will think that such\n   a prize should not be lost to their countrywomen. But that\n   will be all. Mr. Glascock commands such universal respect\n   that his wife will certainly be respected, and I do not\n   suppose that anything will ever come in your way that can\n   possibly make you feel that he is looked down upon. I hope\n   you will understand what I mean.\n\n   As for your changing now, that is quite impossible. If I\n   were you, I would not say a word about it to any living\n   being; but just go on,--straight forward,--in your own\n   way, and take the good the gods provide you,--as the poet\n   says to the king in the ode. And I think the gods have\n   provided for you very well,--and for him.\n\n   I do hope that I may see you sometimes. I cannot explain\n   to you how very much out of your line \"we\" shall be;--for\n   of course there is a \"we.\" People are more separated with\n   us than they are, I suppose, with you. And my \"we\" is\n   a very poor man, who works hard at writing in a dingy\n   newspaper office, and we shall live in a garret and have\n   brown sugar in our tea, and eat hashed mutton. And I shall\n   have nothing a year to buy my clothes with. Still I mean\n   to do it; and I don't mean to be long before I do do it.\n   When a girl has made up her mind to be married, she had\n   better go on with it at once, and take it all afterwards\n   as it may come. Nevertheless, perhaps, we may see each\n   other somewhere, and I may be able to introduce you to the\n   dearest, honestest, very best, and most affectionate man\n   in the world. And he is very, very clever.\n\n   Yours very affectionately,\n\n   NORA ROWLEY.\n\n   Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\n\nMR. GLASCOCK IS MASTER.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nCaroline Spalding, when she received Nora's letter, was not disposed\nto give much weight to it. She declared to herself that the girl's\nunpremeditated expression of opinion was worth more than her studied\nwords. But she was not the less grateful or the less loving towards\nher new friend. She thought how nice it would be to have Nora at that\nsplendid abode in England of which she had heard so much,--but she\nthought also that in that splendid abode she herself ought never to\nhave part or share. If it were the case that this were an unfitting\nmatch, it was clearly her duty to decide that there should be no\nmarriage. Nora had been quite right in bidding her speak to Mr.\nGlascock himself, and to Mr. Glascock she would go. But it was very\ndifficult for her to determine on the manner in which she would\ndiscuss the subject with him. She thought that she could be firm if\nher mind were once made up. She believed that perhaps she was by\nnature more firm than he. In all their intercourse together he had\never yielded to her; and though she had been always pleased and\ngrateful, there had grown upon her an idea that he was perhaps too\neasy,--that he was a man as to whom it was necessary that they who\nloved him should see that he was not led away by weakness into folly.\nBut she would want to learn something from him before her decision\nwas finally reached, and in this she foresaw a great difficulty.\nIn her trouble she went to her usual counsellor,--the Republican\nBrowning. In such an emergency she could hardly have done worse.\n\"Wally,\" she said, \"we talk about England, and Italy, and France,\nas though we knew all about them; but how hard it is to realise the\ndifference between one's own country and others.\"\n\n\"We can at least learn a great deal that is satisfactory,\" said\nWallachia. \"About one out of every five Italians can read a book,\nabout two out of every five Englishmen can read a book. Out of every\nfive New Englanders four and four-fifths can read a book. I guess\nthat is knowing a good deal.\"\n\n\"I don't mean in statistics.\"\n\n\"I cannot conceive how you are to learn anything about any country\nexcept by statistics. I have just discovered that the number of\nillegitimate children--\"\n\n\"Oh, Wally, I can't talk about that,--not now at least. What I cannot\nrealise is this,--what sort of a life it is that they will lead at\nMonkhams.\"\n\n\"Plenty to eat and drink, I guess; and you'll always have to go round\nin fine clothes.\"\n\n\"And that will be all?\"\n\n\"No;--not all. There will be carriages and horses, and all manner\nof people there who won't care much about you. If he is firm,--very\nfirm;--if he have that firmness which one does not often meet, even\nin an American man, he will be able, after a while, to give you\na position as an English woman of rank.\" It is to be feared that\nWallachia Petrie had been made aware of Caroline's idea as to Mr.\nGlascock's want of purpose.\n\n\"And that will be all?\"\n\n\"If you have a baby, they'll let you go and see it two or three times\na day. I don't suppose you will be allowed to nurse it, because they\nnever do in England. You have read what the Saturday Review says. In\nevery other respect the Saturday Review has been the falsest of all\nfalse periodicals, but I guess it has been pretty true in what it has\nsaid about English women.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew more about it really.\"\n\n\"When a man has to leap through a window in the dark, Caroline, of\ncourse he doubts whether the feather bed said to be below will be\nsoft enough for him.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't fear the leap for myself, if it wouldn't hurt him. Do\nyou think it possible that society can be so formed that a man should\nlose caste because he doesn't marry just one of his own set?\"\n\n\"It has been so all over the world, my dear. If like to like is to be\ntrue anywhere, it should be true in marriage.\"\n\n\"Yes;--but with a difference. He and I are like to like. We come of\nthe same race, we speak the same language, we worship the same God,\nwe have the same ideas of culture and of pleasures. The difference is\none that is not patent to the eye or to the ear. It is a difference\nof accidental incident, not of nature or of acquirement.\"\n\n\"I guess you would find, Caroline, that a jury of English matrons\nsworn to try you fairly, would not find you to be entitled to come\namong them as one of themselves.\"\n\n\"And how will that affect him?\"\n\n\"Less powerfully than many others, because he is not impassioned. He\nis, perhaps--lethargic.\"\n\n\"No, Wally, he is not lethargic.\"\n\n\"If you ask me I must speak. It would harass some men almost to\ndeath; it will not do so with him. He would probably find his\nhappiness best in leaving his old country and coming among your\npeople.\"\n\nThe idea of Mr. Glascock,--the future Lord Peterborough,--leaving\nEngland, abandoning Monkhams, deserting his duty in the House of\nLords, and going away to live in an American town, in order that he\nmight escape the miseries which his wife had brought upon him in his\nown country, was more than Caroline could bear. She knew that, at\nany rate, it would not come to that. The lord of Monkhams would live\nat Monkhams, though the heavens should fall--in regard to domestic\ncomforts. It was clear to Caroline that Wallachia Petrie had in truth\nnever brought home to her own imagination the position of an English\npeer. \"I don't think you understand the people at all,\" she said\nangrily.\n\n\"You think that you can understand them better because you are\nengaged to this man!\" said Miss Petrie, with well-pronounced irony.\n\"You have found generally that when the sun shines in your eyes your\nsight is improved by it! You think that the love-talk of a few weeks\ngives clearer instruction than the laborious reading of many volumes\nand thoughtful converse with thinking persons! I hope that you may\nfind it so, Caroline.\" So saying Wallachia Petrie walked off in great\ndudgeon.\n\nMiss Petrie, not having learned from her many volumes and her much\nconverse with thoughtful persons to read human nature aright, was\nconvinced by this conversation that her friend Caroline was blind\nto all results, and was determined to go on with this dangerous\nmarriage, having the rays of that sun of Monkhams so full upon her\neyes that she could not see at all. She was specially indignant at\nfinding that her own words had no effect. But, unfortunately, her\nwords had had much effect; and Caroline, though she had contested her\npoints, had done so only with the intention of producing her Mentor's\nadmonitions. Of course it was out of the question that Mr. Glascock\nshould go and live in Providence, Rhode Island, from which thriving\ntown Caroline Spalding had come; but, because that was impossible,\nit was not the less probable that he might be degraded and made\nmiserable in his own home. That suggested jury of British matrons\nwas a frightful conclave to contemplate, and Caroline was disposed\nto believe that the verdict given in reference to herself would\nbe adverse to her. So she sat and meditated, and spoke not a word\nfurther to any one on the subject till she was alone with the man\nthat she loved.\n\nMr. Spalding at this time inhabited the ground floor of a large\npalace in the city, from which there was access to a garden which at\nthis period of the year was green, bright, and shady, and which as\nbeing in the centre of a city was large and luxurious. From one end\nof the house there projected a covered terrace, or loggia, in which\nthere were chairs and tables, sculptured ornaments, busts, and old\nmonumental relics let into the wall in profusion. It was half chamber\nand half garden,--such an adjunct to a house as in our climate would\ngive only an idea of cold, rheumatism, and a false romance, but under\nan Italian sky, is a luxury daily to be enjoyed during most months of\nthe year. Here Mr. Glascock and Caroline had passed many hours,--and\nhere they were now seated, late in the evening, while all others of\nthe family were away. As far as regarded the rooms occupied by the\nAmerican Minister, they had the house and garden to themselves, and\nthere never could come a time more appropriate for the saying of a\nthing difficult to be said. Mr. Glascock had heard from his father's\nphysician, and had said that it was nearly certain now that he\nneed not go down to Naples again before his marriage. Caroline was\ntrembling, not knowing how to speak, not knowing how to begin;--but\nresolved that the thing should be done. \"He will never know you,\nCarry,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"It is, perhaps, hardly a sorrow to me,\nbut it is a regret.\"\n\n\"It would have been a sorrow perhaps to him had he been able to know\nme,\" said she, taking the opportunity of rushing at her subject.\n\n\"Why so? Of all human beings he was the softest-hearted.\"\n\n\"Not softer-hearted than you, Charles. But soft hearts have to be\nhardened.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Am I becoming obdurate?\"\n\n\"I am, Charles,\" she said. \"I have got something to say to you. What\nwill your uncles and aunts and your mother's relations say of me when\nthey see me at Monkhams?\"\n\n\"They will swear to me that you are charming; and then,--when my back\nis turned,--they'll pick you to pieces a little among themselves. I\nbelieve that is the way of the world, and I don't suppose that we are\nto do better than others.\"\n\n\"And if you had married an English girl, a Lady Augusta\nSomebody,--would they pick her to pieces?\"\n\n\"I guess they would, as you say.\"\n\n\"Just the same?\"\n\n\"I don't think anybody escapes, as far as I can see. But that won't\nprevent their becoming your bosom friends in a few weeks time.\"\n\n\"No one will say that you have been wrong to marry an American girl?\"\n\n\"Now, Carry, what is the meaning of all this?\"\n\n\"Do you know any man in your position who ever did marry an American\ngirl;--any man of your rank in England?\" Mr. Glascock began to think\nof the case, and could not at the moment remember any instance.\n\"Charles, I do not think you ought to be the first.\"\n\n\"And yet somebody must be first, if the thing is ever to be\ndone;--and I am too old to wait on the chance of being the second.\"\n\nShe felt that at the rate she was now progressing she would only run\nfrom one little suggestion to another, and that he, either wilfully\nor in sheer simplicity, would take such suggestions simply as jokes;\nand she was aware that she lacked the skill to bring the conversation\nround gradually to the point which she was bound to reach. She must\nmake another dash, let it be ever so sudden. Her mode of doing so\nwould be crude, ugly,--almost vulgar she feared; but she would attain\nher object and say what she had to say. When once she had warmed\nherself with the heat which argument would produce, then, she was\npretty sure, she would find herself at least as strong as he. \"I\ndon't know that the thing ought to be done at all,\" she said. During\nthe last moment or two he had put his arm round her waist; and she,\nnot choosing to bid him desist from embracing her, but unwilling in\nher present mood to be embraced, got up and stood before him. \"I have\nthought, and thought, and thought, and feel that it should not be\ndone. In marriage, like should go to like.\" She despised herself for\nusing Wallachia's words, but they fitted in so usefully, that she\ncould not refrain from them. \"I was wrong not to know it before, but\nit is better to know it now, than not to have known it till too late.\nEverything that I hear and see tells me that it would be so. If you\nwere simply an Englishman, I would go anywhere with you; but I am not\nfit to be the wife of an English lord. The time would come when I\nshould be a disgrace to you, and then I should die.\"\n\n\"I think I should go near dying myself,\" said he, \"if you were a\ndisgrace to me.\" He had not risen from his chair, and sat calmly\nlooking up into her face.\n\n\"We have made a mistake, and let us unmake it,\" she continued. \"I\nwill always be your friend. I will correspond with you. I will come\nand see your wife.\"\n\n\"That will be very kind!\"\n\n\"Charles, if you laugh at me, I shall be angry with you. It is right\nthat you should look to your future life, as it is right that I\nshould do so also. Do you think that I am joking? Do you suppose that\nI do not mean it?\"\n\n\"You have taken an extra dose this morning of Wallachia Petrie, and\nof course you mean it.\"\n\n\"If you think that I am speaking her mind and not my own, you do not\nknow me.\"\n\n\"And what is it you propose?\" he said, still keeping his seat and\nlooking calmly up into her face.\n\n\"Simply that our engagement should be over.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because it is not a fitting one for you to have made. I did not\nunderstand it before, but now I do. It will not be good for you to\nmarry an American girl. It will not add to your happiness, and may\ndestroy it. I have learned, at last, to know how much higher is your\nposition than mine.\"\n\n\"And I am to be supposed to know nothing about it?\"\n\n\"Your fault is only this,--that you have been too generous. I can be\ngenerous also.\"\n\n\"Now, look here, Caroline, you must not be angry with me if on such\na subject I speak plainly. You must not even be angry if I laugh a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Pray do not laugh at me!--not now.\"\n\n\"I must a little, Carry. Why am I to be supposed to be so ignorant of\nwhat concerns my own happiness and my own duties? If you will not sit\ndown, I will get up, and we will take a turn together.\" He rose from\nhis seat, but they did not leave the covered terrace. They moved on\nto the extremity, and then he stood hemming her in against a marble\ntable in the corner. \"In making this rather wild proposition, have\nyou considered me at all?\"\n\n\"I have endeavoured to consider you, and you only.\"\n\n\"And how have you done it? By the aid of some misty, far-fetched\nideas respecting English society, for which you have no basis except\nyour own dreams,--and by the fantasies of a rabid enthusiast.\"\n\n\"She is not rabid,\" said Caroline earnestly; \"other people think just\nthe same.\"\n\n\"My dear, there is only one person whose thinking on this subject\nis of any avail, and I am that person. Of course, I can't drag you\ninto church to be married, but practically you can not help yourself\nfrom being taken there now. As there need be no question about our\nmarriage,--which is a thing as good as done--\"\n\n\"It is not done at all,\" said Caroline.\n\n\"I feel quite satisfied you will not jilt me, and as I shall insist\non having the ceremony performed, I choose to regard it as a\ncertainty. Passing that by, then, I will go on to the results. My\nuncles, and aunts, and cousins, and the people you talk of, were very\nreasonable folk when I last saw them, and quite sufficiently alive to\nthe fact that they had to regard me as the head of their family. I\ndo not doubt that we shall find them equally reasonable when we get\nhome; but should they be changed, should there be any sign shewn that\nmy choice of a wife had occasioned displeasure,--such displeasure\nwould not affect you.\"\n\n\"But it would affect you.\"\n\n\"Not at all. In my own house I am master,--and I mean to continue to\nbe so. You will be mistress there, and the only fear touching such\na position is that it may be recognised by others too strongly. You\nhave nothing to fear, Carry.\"\n\n\"It is of you I am thinking.\"\n\n\"Nor have I. What if some old women, or even some young women, should\nturn up their noses at the wife I have chosen, because she has not\nbeen chosen from among their own countrywomen, is that to be a cause\nof suffering to us? Can not we rise above that,--lasting as it would\ndo for a few weeks, a month or two perhaps,--say a year,--till my\nCaroline shall have made herself known? I think that we are strong\nenough to live down a trouble so light.\" He had come close to her\nas he was speaking, and had again put his arm round her waist. She\ntried to escape from his embrace,--not with persistency, not with the\nstrength which always suffices for a woman when the embrace is in\ntruth a thing to be avoided, but clutching at his fingers with hers,\npressing them rather than loosening their grasp. \"No, Carry,\" he\ncontinued; \"we have got to go through with it now, and we will try\nand make the best of it. You may trust me that we shall not find it\ndifficult,--not, at least, on the ground of your present fears. I can\nbear a heavier burden than you will bring upon me.\"\n\n\"I know that I ought to prove to you that I am right,\" she said,\nstill struggling with his hand.\n\n\"And I know that you can prove nothing of the kind. Dearest, it is\nfixed between us now, and do not let us be so silly as to raise\nimaginary difficulties. Of course you would have to marry me, even if\nthere were cause for such fears. If there were any great cause, still\nthe game would be worth the candle. There could be no going back, let\nthe fear be what it might. But there need be no fear if you will only\nlove me.\" She felt that he was altogether too strong for her,--that\nshe had mistaken his character in supposing that she could be more\nfirm than he. He was so strong that he treated her almost as a\nchild;--and yet she loved him infinitely the better for so treating\nher. Of course, she knew now that her objection, whether true or\nunsubstantial, could not avail. As he stood with his arm round her,\nshe was powerless to contradict him in anything. She had so far\nacknowledged this that she no longer struggled with him, but allowed\nher hand to remain quietly within his. If there was no going back\nfrom this bargain that had been made,--why, then, there was no need\nfor combating. And when he stooped over and kissed her lips, she had\nnot a word to say. \"Be good to me,\" he said, \"and tell me that I am\nright.\"\n\n\"You must be master, I suppose, whether you are right or wrong. A man\nalways thinks himself entitled to his own way.\"\n\n\"Why, yes. When he has won the battle, he claims his captive. Now,\nthe truth is this, I have won the battle, and your friend, Miss\nPetrie, has lost it. I hope she will understand that she has been\nbeaten at last out of the field.\" As he said this, he heard a step\nbehind them, and turning round saw Wallachia there almost before he\ncould drop his arm.\n\n\"I am sorry that I have intruded on you,\" she said very grimly.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"Caroline and I have had a\nlittle dispute, but we have settled it without coming to blows.\"\n\n\"I do not suppose that an English gentleman ever absolutely strikes a\nlady,\" said Wallachia Petrie.\n\n\"Not except on strong provocation,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"In reference\nto wives, a stick is allowed as big as your thumb.\"\n\n\"I have heard that it is so by the laws of England,\" said Wallachia.\n\n\"How can you be so ridiculous, Wally!\" said Caroline. \"There is\nnothing that you would not believe.\"\n\n\"I hope that it may never be true in your case,\" said Wallachia.\n\nA couple of days after this Miss Spalding found that it was\nabsolutely necessary that she should explain the circumstances of her\nposition to Nora. She had left Nora with the purpose of performing\na very high-minded action, of sacrificing herself for the sake of\nher lover, of giving up all her golden prospects, and of becoming\nonce again the bosom friend of Wallachia Petrie, with this simple\nconsolation for her future life,--that she had refused to marry\nan English nobleman because the English nobleman's condition was\nunsuited to her. It would have been an episode in female life in\nwhich pride might be taken;--but all that was now changed. She had\nmade her little attempt,--had made it, as she felt, in a very languid\nmanner, and had found herself treated as a child for doing so. Of\ncourse she was happy in her ill success; of course she would have\nbeen broken-hearted had she succeeded. But, nevertheless, she was\nsomewhat lowered in her own esteem, and it was necessary that she\nshould acknowledge the truth to the friend whom she had consulted. A\nday or two had passed before she found herself alone with Nora, but\nwhen she did so she confessed her failure at once.\n\n\"You told him all, then?\" said Nora.\n\n\"Oh yes, I told him all. That is, I could not really tell him. When\nthe moment came I had no words.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He had words enough. I never knew him to be eloquent before.\"\n\n\"He can speak out if he likes,\" said Nora.\n\n\"So I have found,--with a vengeance. Nobody was ever so put down as I\nwas. Don't you know that there are times when it does not seem to be\nworth your while to put out your strength against an adversary? So it\nwas with him. He just told me that he was my master, and that I was\nto do as he bade me.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"I promised to be a good girl,\" said Caroline, \"and not to pretend\nto have any opinion of my own ever again. And so we kissed, and were\nfriends.\"\n\n\"I dare say there was a kiss, my dear.\"\n\n\"Of course there was;--and he held me in his arms, and comforted me,\nand told me how to behave;--just as you would do a little girl. It's\nall over now, of course; and if there be a mistake, it is his fault.\nI feel that all responsibility is gone from myself, and that for all\nthe rest of my life I have to do just what he tells me.\"\n\n\"And what says the divine Wallachia?\"\n\n\"Poor Wally! She says nothing, but she thinks that I am a castaway\nand a recreant. I am a recreant, I know;--but yet I think that I was\nright. I know I could not help myself.\"\n\n\"Of course you were right, my dear,\" said the sage Nora. \"If you had\nthe notion in your head, it was wise to get rid of it; but I knew how\nit would be when you spoke to him.\"\n\n\"You were not so weak when he came to you.\"\n\n\"That was altogether another thing. It was not arranged in heaven\nthat I was to become his captive.\"\n\nAfter that Wallachia Petrie never again tried her influence on her\nformer friend, but admitted to herself that the evil was done, and\nthat it could not be remedied. According to her theory of life,\nCaroline Spalding had been wrong, and weak,--had shewn herself to\nbe comfort-loving and luxuriously-minded, had looked to get her\nhappiness from soft effeminate pleasures rather than from rational\nwork and the useful, independent exercise of her own intelligence.\nIn the privacy of her little chamber Wallachia Petrie shed,--not\nabsolute tears,--but many tearful thoughts over her friend. It was\nto her a thing very terrible that the chosen one of her heart should\nprefer the career of an English lord's wife to that of an American\ncitizeness, with all manner of capability for female voting, female\nspeech-making, female poetising, and, perhaps, female political\naction before her. It was a thousand pities! \"You may take a horse\nto water,\"--said Wallachia to herself, thinking of the ever-freshly\nspringing fountain of her own mind, at which Caroline Spalding would\nalways have been made welcome freely to quench her thirst,--\"but you\ncannot make him drink if he be not athirst.\" In the future she would\nhave no friend. Never again would she subject herself to the disgrace\nof such a failure. But the sacrifice was to be made, and she knew\nthat it was bootless to waste her words further on Caroline Spalding.\nShe left Florence before the wedding, and returned alone to the land\nof liberty. She wrote a letter to Caroline explaining her conduct,\nand Caroline Spalding shewed the letter to her husband,--as one that\nwas both loving and eloquent.\n\n\"Very loving and very eloquent,\" he said. \"But, nevertheless, one\ndoes think of sour grapes.\"\n\n\"There I am sure you wrong her,\" said Caroline.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\n\nMRS. FRENCH'S CARVING KNIFE.\n\n\nDuring these days there were terrible doings at Exeter. Camilla had\nsworn that if Mr. Gibson did not come to, there should be a tragedy,\nand it appeared that she was inclined to keep her word. Immediately\nafter the receipt of her letter from Mr. Gibson she had had an\ninterview with that gentleman in his lodgings, and had asked him his\nintentions. He had taken measures to fortify himself against such an\nattack; but, whatever those measures were, Camilla had broken through\nthem. She had stood before him as he sat in his arm-chair, and he had\nbeen dumb in her presence. It had perhaps been well for him that the\neloquence of her indignation had been so great that she had hardly\nbeen able to pause a moment for a reply. \"Will you take your letter\nback again?\" she had said. \"I should be wrong to do that,\" he had\nlisped out in reply, \"because it is true. As a Christian minister\nI could not stand with you at the altar with a lie in my mouth.\"\nIn no other way did he attempt to excuse himself,--but that, twice\nrepeated, filled up all the pause which she made for him.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Camilla's wrath.]\n\n\nThere never had been such a case before,--so impudent, so cruel, so\ngross, so uncalled for, so unmanly, so unnecessary, so unjustifiable,\nso damnable,--so sure of eternal condemnation! All this she\nsaid to him with loud voice, and clenched fist, and starting\neyes,--regardless utterly of any listeners on the stairs, or of\noutside passers in the street. In very truth she was moved to a\nsublimity of indignation. Her low nature became nearly poetic under\nthe wrong inflicted upon her. She was almost tempted to tear him with\nher hands, and inflict upon him at the moment some terrible vengeance\nwhich should be told of for ever in the annals of Exeter. A man so\nmean as he, so weak, so cowardly, one so little of a hero;--that he\nshould dare to do it, and dare to sit there before her, and to say\nthat he would do it! \"Your gown shall be torn off your back, sir, and\nthe very boys of Exeter shall drag you through the gutters!\" To this\nthreat he said nothing, but sat mute, hiding his face in his hands.\n\"And now tell me this, sir;--is there anything between you and\nBella?\" But there was no voice in reply. \"Answer my question, sir.\nI have a right to ask it.\" Still he said not a word. \"Listen to me.\nSooner than that you and she should be man and wife, I would stab\nher! Yes, I would;--you poor, paltry, lying, cowardly creature!\" She\nremained with him for more than half an hour, and then banged out of\nthe room flashing back a look of scorn at him as she went. Martha,\nbefore that day was over, had learned the whole story from Mr.\nGibson's cook, and had told her mistress.\n\n\"I did not think he had so much spirit in him,\" was Miss Stanbury's\nanswer. Throughout Exeter the great wonder arising from the crisis\nwas the amount of spirit which had been displayed by Mr. Gibson.\n\nWhen he was left alone he shook himself, and began to think that if\nthere were danger that such interviews might occur frequently he had\nbetter leave Exeter for good. As he put his hand over his forehead,\nhe declared to himself that a very little more of that kind of thing\nwould kill him. When a couple of hours had passed over his head he\nshook himself again, and sat down and wrote a letter to his intended\nmother-in-law.\n\n\n   I do not mean to complain [he said], God knows I have\n   no right; but I cannot stand a repetition of what has\n   occurred just now. If your younger daughter comes to see\n   me again I must refuse to see her, and shall leave the\n   town. I am ready to make what reparation may be possible\n   for the mistake into which I have fallen.\n\n   T. G.\n\n\nMrs. French was no doubt much afraid of her younger daughter, but\nshe was less afraid of her than were other people. Familiarity, they\nsay, breeds contempt; and who can be so familiar with a child as its\nparent? She did not in her heart believe that Camilla would murder\nanybody, and she fully realised the conviction that, even after all\nthat was come and gone, it would be better that one of her daughters\nshould have a husband than that neither should be so blessed. If only\nCamilla could be got out of Exeter for a few months,--how good a\nthing it would be for them all! She had a brother in Gloucester,--if\nonly he could be got to take Camilla for a few months! And then, too,\nshe knew that if the true rights of her two daughters were strictly\nand impartially examined, Arabella's claim was much stronger than any\nthat Camilla could put forward to the hand of Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"You must not go there again, Camilla,\" the mother said.\n\n\"I shall go whenever I please,\" replied the fury.\n\n\"Now, Camilla, we may as well understand each other. I will not have\nit done. If I am provoked, I will send to your uncle at Gloucester.\"\nNow the uncle at Gloucester was a timber merchant, a man with\nprotuberant eyes and a great square chin,--known to be a very stern\nman indeed, and not at all afraid of young women.\n\n\"What do I care for my uncle? My uncle would take my part.\"\n\n\"No, he would not. The truth is, Camilla, you interfered with Bella\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Mamma, how dare you say so!\"\n\n\"You did, my dear. And these are the consequences.\"\n\n\"And you mean to say that she is to be Mrs. Gibson?\"\n\n\"I say nothing about that. But I do not see why they shouldn't be\nmarried if their hearts are inclined to each other.\"\n\n\"I will die first!\"\n\n\"Your dying has nothing to do with it, Camilla.\"\n\n\"And I will kill her!\"\n\n\"If you speak to me again in that way I will write to your uncle at\nGloucester. I have done the best I could for you both, and I will not\nbear such treatment.\"\n\n\"And how am I treated?\"\n\n\"You should not have interfered with your sister.\"\n\n\"You are all in a conspiracy together,\" shouted Camilla, \"you are!\nThere never was anybody so badly treated,--never,--never,--never!\nWhat will everybody say of me?\"\n\n\"They will pity you, if you will be quiet.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be pitied;--I won't be pitied. I wish I could\ndie,--and I will die! Anybody else would, at any rate, have had their\nmother and sister with them!\" Then she burst into a flood of real,\ntrue, womanly tears.\n\nAfter this there was a lull at Heavitree for a few days. Camilla\ndid not speak to her sister, but she condescended to hold some\nintercourse with her mother, and to take her meals at the family\ntable. She did not go out of the house, but she employed herself in\nher own room, doing no one knew what, with all that new clothing and\nhousehold gear which was to have been transferred in her train to\nMr. Gibson's house. Mrs. French was somewhat uneasy about the new\nclothing and household gear, feeling that, in the event of Bella's\nmarriage, at least a considerable portion of it must be transferred\nto the new bride. But it was impossible at the present moment to open\nsuch a subject to Camilla;--it would have been as a proposition to a\nlioness respecting the taking away of her whelps. Nevertheless, the\nday must soon come in which something must be said about the clothing\nand household gear. All the property that had been sent into the\nhouse at Camilla's orders could not be allowed to remain as Camilla's\nperquisites, now that Camilla was not to be married. \"Do you know\nwhat she is doing, my dear?\" said Mrs. French to her elder daughter.\n\n\"Perhaps she is picking out the marks,\" said Bella.\n\n\"I don't think she would do that as yet,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"She might just as well leave it alone,\" said Bella, feeling that one\nof the two letters would do for her. But neither of them dared to\nspeak to her of her occupation in these first days of her despair.\n\nMr. Gibson in the meantime remained at home, or only left his house\nto go to the Cathedral or to visit the narrow confines of his little\nparish. When he was out he felt that everybody looked at him, and it\nseemed to him that people whispered about him when they saw him at\nhis usual desk in the choir. His friends passed him merely bowing to\nhim, and he was aware that he had done that which would be regarded\nby every one around him as unpardonable. And yet,--what ought he to\nhave done? He acknowledged to himself that he had been very foolish,\nmad,--quite demented at the moment,--when he allowed himself to think\nit possible that he should marry Camilla French. But having found out\nhow mad he had been at that moment, having satisfied himself that to\nlive with her as his wife would be impossible, was he not right to\nbreak the engagement? Could anything be so wicked as marrying a woman\nwhom he--hated? Thus he tried to excuse himself; but yet he knew that\nall the world would condemn him. Life in Exeter would be impossible,\nif no way to social pardon could be opened for him. He was willing to\ndo anything within bounds in mitigation of his offence. He would give\nup fifty pounds a year to Camilla for his life,--or he would marry\nBella. Yes; he would marry Bella at once,--if Camilla would only\nconsent, and give up that idea of stabbing some one. Bella French\nwas not very nice in his eyes; but she was quiet, he thought, and it\nmight be possible to live with her. Nevertheless, he told himself\nover and over again that the manner in which unmarried men with\nincomes were set upon by ladies in want of husbands was very\ndisgraceful to the country at large. That mission to Natal which had\nonce been offered to him would have had charms for him now, of which\nhe had not recognised the force when he rejected it.\n\n\"Do you think that he ever was really engaged to her?\" Dorothy said\nto her aunt. Dorothy was now living in a seventh heaven of happiness,\nwriting love-letters to Brooke Burgess every other day, and devoting\nto this occupation a number of hours of which she ought to have\nbeen ashamed; making her purchases for her wedding,--with nothing,\nhowever, of the magnificence of a Camilla,--but discussing everything\nwith her aunt, who urged her on to extravagances which seemed beyond\nthe scope of her own economical ideas; settling, or trying to settle,\nlittle difficulties which perplexed her somewhat, and wondering\nat her own career. She could not of course be married without the\npresence of her mother and sister, and her aunt,--with something of\na grim courtesy,--had intimated that they should be made welcome to\nthe house in the Close for the special occasion. But nothing had been\nsaid about Hugh. The wedding was to be in the Cathedral, and Dorothy\nhad a little scheme in her head for meeting her brother among the\naisles. He would no doubt come down with Brooke, and nothing perhaps\nneed be said about it to Aunt Stanbury. But still it was a trouble.\nHer aunt had been so good that Dorothy felt that no step should be\ntaken which would vex the old woman. It was evident enough that\nwhen permission had been given for the visit of Mrs. Stanbury and\nPriscilla, Hugh's name had been purposely kept back. There had been\nno accidental omission. Dorothy, therefore, did not dare to mention\nit,--and yet it was essential for her happiness that he should be\nthere. At the present moment Miss Stanbury's intense interest in the\nStanbury wedding was somewhat mitigated by the excitement occasioned\nby Mr. Gibson's refusal to be married. Dorothy was so shocked that\nshe could not bring herself to believe the statement that had reached\nthem through Martha.\n\n\"Of course he was engaged to her. We all knew that,\" said Miss\nStanbury.\n\n\"I think there must have been some mistake,\" said Dorothy. \"I don't\nsee how he could do it.\"\n\n\"There is no knowing what people can do, my dear, when they're hard\ndriven. I suppose we shall have a lawsuit now, and he'll have to pay\never so much money. Well, well, well! see what a deal of trouble you\nmight have saved!\"\n\n\"But he'd have done the same to me, aunt;--only, you know, I never\ncould have taken him. Isn't it better as it is, aunt? Tell me.\"\n\n\"I suppose young women always think it best when they can get their\nown ways. An old woman like me has only got to do what she is bid.\"\n\n\"But this was best, aunt;--was it not?\"\n\n\"My dear, you've had your way, and let that be enough. Poor Camilla\nFrench is not allowed to have hers at all. Dear, dear, dear! I didn't\nthink the man would ever have been such a fool to begin with;--or\nthat he would ever have had the heart to get out of it afterwards.\"\nIt astonished Dorothy to find that her aunt was not loud in\nreprobation of Mr. Gibson's very dreadful conduct.\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. French had written to her brother at Gloucester.\nThe maid-servant, in making Miss Camilla's bed, and in \"putting the\nroom to rights,\" as she called it,--which description probably was\nintended to cover the circumstances of an accurate search,--had\ndiscovered, hidden among some linen,--a carving knife! such a\nknife as is used for the cutting up of fowls; and, after two days'\ninterval, had imparted the discovery to Mrs. French. Instant visit\nwas made to the pantry, and it was found that a very aged but\nunbroken and sharply-pointed weapon was missing. Mrs. French at once\naccused Camilla, and Camilla, after some hesitation, admitted that\nit might be there. Molly, she said, was a nasty, sly, wicked thing,\nto go looking in her drawers, and she would never leave anything\nunlocked again. The knife, she declared, had been taken up-stairs,\nbecause she had wanted something very sharp to cut,--the bones of\nher stays. The knife was given up, but Mrs. French thought it best\nto write to her brother, Mr. Crump. She was in great doubt about\nsundry matters. Had the carving knife really pointed to a domestic\ntragedy;--and if so, what steps ought a poor widow to take with\nsuch a daughter? And what ought to be done about Mr. Gibson? It ran\nthrough Mrs. French's mind that unless something were done at once,\nMr. Gibson would escape scot free. It was her wish that he should yet\nbecome her son-in-law. Poor Bella was entitled to her chance. But\nif Bella was to be disappointed,--from fear of carving knives, or\nfor other reasons,--then there came the question whether Mr. Gibson\nshould not be made to pay in purse for the mischief he had done. With\nall these thoughts and doubts running through her head, Mrs. French\nwrote to her brother at Gloucester.\n\nThere came back an answer from Mr. Crump, in which that gentleman\nexpressed a very strong idea that Mr. Gibson should be prosecuted for\ndamages with the utmost virulence, and with the least possible delay.\nNo compromise should be accepted. Mr. Crump would himself come to\nExeter and see the lawyer as soon as he should be told that there\nwas a lawyer to be seen. As to the carving knife, Mr. Crump was of\nopinion that it did not mean anything. Mr. Crump was a gentleman who\ndid not believe in strong romance, but who had great trust in all\npecuniary claims. The Frenches had always been genteel. The late\nCaptain French had been an officer in the army, and at ordinary times\nand seasons the Frenches were rather ashamed of the Crump connection.\nBut now the timber merchant might prove himself to be a useful\nfriend.\n\nMrs. French shewed her brother's letter to Bella,--and poor Bella was\nagain sore-hearted, seeing that nothing was said in it of her claims.\n\"It will be dreadful scandal to have it all in the papers!\" said\nBella.\n\n\"But what can we do?\"\n\n\"Anything would be better than that,\" said Bella. \"And you don't want\nto punish Mr. Gibson, mamma.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, you see what your uncle says. What can I do, except go\nto him for advice?\"\n\n\"Why don't you go to Mr. Gibson yourself, mamma?\"\n\nBut nothing was said to Camilla about Mr. Crump;--nothing as yet.\nCamilla did not love Mr. Crump, but there was no other house except\nthat of Mr. Crump's at Gloucester to which she might be sent, if\nit could be arranged that Mr. Gibson and Bella should be made one.\nMrs. French took her eldest daughter's advice, and went to Mr.\nGibson;--taking Mr. Crump's letter in her pocket. For herself she\nwanted nothing,--but was it not the duty of her whole life to fight\nfor her daughters? Poor woman! If somebody would only have taught her\nhow that duty might best be done, she would have endeavoured to obey\nthe teaching. \"You know I do not want to threaten you,\" she said to\nMr. Gibson; \"but you see what my brother says. Of course I wrote to\nmy brother. What could a poor woman do in such circumstances except\nwrite to her brother?\"\n\n\"If you choose to set the bloodhounds of the law at me, of course you\ncan,\" said Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"I do not want to go to law at all;--God knows I do not!\" said Mrs.\nFrench. Then there was a pause. \"Poor dear Bella!\" ejaculated Mrs.\nFrench.\n\n\"Dear Bella!\" echoed Mr. Gibson.\n\n\"What do you mean to do about Bella?\" asked Mrs. French.\n\n\"I sometimes think that I had better take poison and have done with\nit!\" said Mr. Gibson, feeling himself to be very hard pressed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\n\nBELLA VICTRIX.\n\n\nMr. Crump arrived at Exeter. Camilla was not told of his coming till\nthe morning of the day on which he arrived; and then the tidings were\ncommunicated, because it was necessary that a change should be made\nin the bed-rooms. She and her sister had separate rooms when there\nwas no visitor with them, but now Mr. Crump must be accommodated.\nThere was a long consultation between Bella and Mrs. French, but at\nlast it was decided that Bella should sleep with her mother. There\nwould still be too much of the lioness about Camilla to allow of her\nbeing regarded as a safe companion through the watches of the night.\n\"Why is Uncle Jonas coming now?\" she asked.\n\n\"I thought it better to ask him,\" said Mrs. French.\n\nAfter a long pause, Camilla asked another question. \"Does Uncle Jonas\nmean to see Mr. Gibson?\"\n\n\"I suppose he will,\" said Mrs. French.\n\n\"Then he will see a low, mean fellow;--the lowest, meanest fellow\nthat ever was heard of! But that won't make much difference to Uncle\nJonas. I wouldn't have him now, if he was to ask me ever so;--that I\nwouldn't!\"\n\nMr. Crump came, and kissed his sister and two nieces. The embrace\nwith Camilla was not very affectionate. \"So your Joe has been and\njilted you?\" said Uncle Jonas;--\"it's like one of them clergymen.\nThey say so many prayers, they think they may do almost anything\nafterwards. Another man would have had his head punched.\"\n\n\"The less talk there is about it the better,\" said Camilla.\n\nOn the following day Mr. Crump called by appointment on Mr. Gibson,\nand remained closeted with that gentleman for the greater portion of\nthe morning. Camilla knew well that he was going, and went about the\nhouse like a perturbed spirit during his absence. There was a look\nabout her that made them all doubt whether she was not, in truth,\nlosing her mind. Her mother more than once went to the pantry to\nsee that the knives were right; and, as regarded that sharp-pointed\nweapon, was careful to lock it up carefully out of her daughter's\nway. Mr. Crump had declared himself willing to take Camilla back to\nGloucester, and had laughed at the obstacles which his niece might,\nperhaps, throw in the way of such an arrangement. \"She mustn't have\nmuch luggage;--that is all,\" said Mr. Crump. For Mr. Crump had been\nmade aware of the circumstances of the trousseau. About three o'clock\nMr. Crump came back from Mr. Gibson's, and expressed a desire to be\nleft alone with Camilla. Mrs. French was prepared for everything; and\nMr. Crump soon found himself with his younger niece.\n\n\"Camilla, my dear,\" said he, \"this has been a bad business.\"\n\n\"I don't know what business you mean, Uncle Jonas.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, my dear;--you know. And I hope it won't come too late\nto prove to you that young women shouldn't be too keen in setting\ntheir caps at the gentlemen. It's better for them to be hunted, than\nto hunt.\"\n\n\"Uncle Jonas, I will not be insulted.\"\n\n\"Stick to that, my dear, and you won't get into a scrape again. Now,\nlook here. This man can never be made to marry you, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't touch him with a pair of tongs, if he were kneeling at my\nfeet!\"\n\n\"That's right; stick to that. Of course, you wouldn't now, after all\nthat has come and gone. No girl with any spirit would.\"\n\n\"He's a coward and a thief, and he'll be--damned for what he has\ndone, some of these days!\"\n\n\"T-ch, t-ch, t-ch! That isn't a proper way for a young lady to talk.\nThat's cursing and swearing.\"\n\n\"It isn't cursing and swearing;--it's what the Bible says.\"\n\n\"Then we'll leave him to the Bible. In the meantime, Mr. Gibson wants\nto marry some one else, and that can't hurt you.\"\n\n\"He may marry whom he likes;--but he shan't marry Bella--that's all!\"\n\n\"It is Bella that he means to marry.\"\n\n\"Then he won't. I'll forbid the banns. I'll write to the bishop. I'll\ngo to the church and prevent its being done. I'll make such a noise\nin the town that it can't be done. It's no use your looking at me\nlike that, Uncle Jonas. I've got my own feelings, and he shall never\nmarry Bella. It's what they have been intending all through, and it\nshan't be done!\"\n\n\"It will be done.\"\n\n\"Uncle Jonas, I'll stab her to the heart, and him too, before I'll\nsee it done! Though I were to be killed the next day, I would. Could\nyou bear it?\"\n\n\"I'm not a young woman. Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do.\"\n\n\"I'll not do anything.\"\n\n\"Just pack up your things, and start with me to Gloucester\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"I--won't!\"\n\n\"Then you'll be carried, my dear. I'll write to your aunt, to say\nthat you're coming; and we'll be as jolly as possible when we get you\nhome.\"\n\n\"I won't go to Gloucester, Uncle Jonas. I won't go away from Exeter.\nI won't let it be done. She shall never, never, never be that man's\nwife!\"\n\nNevertheless, on the day but one after this, Camilla French did go to\nGloucester. Before she went, however, things had to be done in that\nhouse which almost made Mrs. French repent that she had sent for so\nstern an assistant. Camilla was at last told, in so many words, that\nthe things which she had prepared for her own wedding must be given\nup for the wedding of her sister; and it seemed that this item in\nthe list of her sorrows troubled her almost more than any other. She\nswore that whither she went there should go the dresses, and the\nhandkerchiefs, and the hats, the bonnets, and the boots. \"Let her\nhave them,\" Bella had pleaded. But Mr. Crump was inexorable. He had\nlooked into his sister's affairs, and found that she was already in\ndebt. To his practical mind, it was an absurdity that the unmarried\nsister should keep things that were wholly unnecessary, and that the\nsister that was to be married should be without things that were\nneeded. There was a big trunk, of which Camilla had the key, but\nwhich, unfortunately for her, had been deposited in her mother's\nroom. Upon this she sat, and swore that nothing should move her but a\npromise that her plunder should remain untouched. But there came this\nadvantage from the terrible question of the wedding raiments,--that\nin her energy to keep possession of them, she gradually abandoned her\nopposition to her sister's marriage. She had been driven from one\npoint to another till she was compelled at last to stand solely upon\nher possessions. \"Perhaps we had better let her keep them,\" said Mrs.\nFrench. \"Trash and nonsense!\" said Mr. Crump. \"If she wants a new\nfrock, let her have it; as for the sheets and tablecloths, you'd\nbetter keep them yourself. But Bella must have the rest.\"\n\nIt was found on the eve of the day on which she was told that she was\nto depart that she had in truth armed herself with a dagger or clasp\nknife. She actually displayed it when her uncle told her to come away\nfrom the chest on which she was sitting. She declared that she would\ndefend herself there to the last gasp of her life; but of course the\nknife fell from her hand the first moment that she was touched. \"I\ndid think once that she was going to make a poke at me,\" Mr. Crump\nsaid afterwards; \"but she had screamed herself so weak that she\ncouldn't do it.\"\n\nWhen the morning came, she was taken to the fly and driven to\nthe station without any further serious outbreak. She had even\ncondescended to select certain articles, leaving the rest of\nthe hymeneal wealth behind her. Bella, early on that morning of\ndeparture, with great humility, implored her sister to forgive her;\nbut no entreaties could induce Camilla to address one gracious word\nto the proposed bride. \"You've been cheating me all along!\" she said;\nand that was the last word she spoke to poor Bella.\n\nShe went, and the field was once more open to the amorous Vicar\nof St. Peter's-cum-Pumpkin. It is astonishing how the greatest\ndifficulties will sink away, and become as it were nothing, when\nthey are encountered face to face. It is certain that Mr. Gibson's\nposition had been one most trying to the nerves. He had speculated on\nvarious modes of escape;--a curacy in the north of England would be\nwelcome, or the duties of a missionary in New Zealand,--or death. To\ntell the truth, he had, during the last week or two, contemplated\neven a return to the dominion of Camilla. That there should ever\nagain be things pleasant for him in Exeter seemed to be quite\nimpossible. And yet, on the evening of the day but one after the\ndeparture of Camilla, he was seated almost comfortably with his own\nArabella! There is nothing that a man may not do, nothing that he may\nnot achieve, if he have only pluck enough to go through with it.\n\n\"You do love me?\" Bella said to him. It was natural that she should\nask him; but it would have been better perhaps if she had held her\ntongue. Had she spoken to him about his house, or his income, or the\nservants, or the duties of his parish church, it would have been\neasier for him to make a comfortable reply.\n\n\"Yes;--I love you,\" he replied; \"of course I love you. We have always\nbeen friends, and I hope things will go straight now. I have had\na great deal to go through, Bella, and so have you;--but God will\ntemper the wind to the shorn lambs.\" How was the wind to be tempered\nfor the poor lamb who had gone forth shorn down to the very skin!\n\nSoon after this Mrs. French returned to the room, and then there was\nno more romance. Mrs. French had by no means forgiven Mr. Gibson\nall the trouble he had brought into the family, and mixed a certain\namount of acrimony with her entertainment of him. She dictated to\nhim, treated him with but scant respect, and did not hesitate to let\nhim understand that he was to be watched very closely till he was\nactually and absolutely married. The poor man had in truth no further\nidea of escape. He was aware that he had done that which made it\nnecessary that he should bear a great deal, and that he had no right\nto resent suspicion. When a day was fixed in June on which he should\nbe married at the church of Heavitree, and it was proposed that he\nshould be married by banns, he had nothing to urge to the contrary.\nAnd when it was also suggested to him by one of the prebendaries of\nthe Cathedral that it might be well for him to change his clerical\nduties for a period with the vicar of a remote parish in the north\nof Cornwall,--so as to be out of the way of remark from those whom\nhe had scandalised by his conduct,--he had no objection to make to\nthat arrangement. When Mrs. MacHugh met him in the Close, and told\nhim that he was a gay Lothario, he shook his head with a melancholy\nself-abasement, and passed on without even a feeling of anger. \"When\nthey smite me on the right cheek, I turn unto them my left,\" he said\nto himself, when one of the cathedral vergers remarked to him that\nafter all he was going to be married, at last. Even Bella became\ndominant over him, and assumed with him occasionally the air of one\nwho had been injured.\n\nBella wrote a touching letter to her sister;--a letter that ought to\nhave touched Camilla, begging for forgiveness, and for one word of\nsisterly love. Camilla answered the letter, but did not send a word\nof sisterly love. \"According to my way of thinking, you have been a\nnasty sly thing, and I don't believe you'll ever be happy. As for\nhim, I'll never speak to him again.\" That was nearly the whole of her\nletter. \"You must leave it to time,\" said Mrs. French wisely; \"she'll\ncome round some day.\" And then Mrs. French thought how bad it would\nbe for her if the daughter who was to be her future companion did not\n\"come round\" some day.\n\nAnd so it was settled that they should be married in Heavitree\nChurch,--Mr. Gibson and his first love,--and things went on\npretty much as though nothing had been done amiss. The gentleman\nfrom Cornwall came down to take Mr. Gibson's place at St.\nPeter's-cum-Pumpkin, while his duties in the Cathedral were\ntemporarily divided among the other priest-vicars,--with some amount\nof grumbling on their part. Bella commenced her modest preparations\nwithout any of the \u00c3\u00a9clat which had attended Camilla's operations, but\nshe felt more certainty of ultimate success than had ever fallen to\nCamilla's lot. In spite of all that had come and gone, Bella never\nfeared again that Mr. Gibson would be untrue to her. In regard to\nhim, it must be doubted whether Nemesis ever fell upon him with a\nhand sufficiently heavy to punish him for the great sins which he\nhad manifestly committed. He had encountered a bad week or two, and\nthere had been days in which, as has been said, he thought of Natal,\nof ecclesiastical censures, and even of annihilation; but no real\npunishment seemed to fall upon him. It may be doubted whether, when\nthe whole arrangement was settled for him, and when he heard that\nCamilla had yielded to the decrees of Fate, he did not rather flatter\nhimself on being a successful man of intrigue,--whether he did not\ntake some glory to himself for his good fortune with women, and pride\nhimself amidst his self-reproaches for the devotion which had been\ndisplayed for him by the fair sex in general. It is quite possible\nthat he taught himself to believe that at one time Dorothy Stanbury\nwas devotedly in love with him, and that when he reckoned up his\nsins she was one of those in regard to whom he accounted himself\nto have been a sinner. The spirit of intrigue with women, as to\nwhich men will flatter themselves, is customarily so vile, so mean,\nso vapid a reflection of a feeling, so aimless, resultless, and\nutterly unworthy! Passion exists and has its sway. Vice has its\nvotaries,--and there is, too, that worn-out longing for vice,\n\"prurient, yet passionless, cold-studied lewdness,\" which drags on\na feeble continuance with the aid of money. But the commonest folly\nof man in regard to women is a weak taste for intrigue, with little\nor nothing on which to feed it;--a worse than feminine aptitude for\nmale coquetry, which never ascends beyond a desire that somebody\nshall hint that there is something peculiar; and which is shocked and\nretreats backwards into its boots when anything like a consequence\nforces itself on the apprehension. Such men have their glory in their\nown estimation. We remember how Falstaff flouted the pride of his\ncompanion whose victory in the fields of love had been but little\nglorious. But there are victories going now-a-days so infinitely less\nglorious, that Falstaff's page was a Lothario, a very Don Juan, in\ncomparison with the heroes whose praises are too often sung by their\nown lips. There is this recompense,--that their defeats are always\nsung by lips louder than their own. Mr. Gibson, when he found that he\nwas to escape apparently unscathed,--that people standing respectably\nbefore the world absolutely dared to whisper words to him of\ncongratulation on this third attempt at marriage within little more\nthan a year, took pride to himself, and bethought himself that he\nwas a gay deceiver. He believed that he had selected his wife,--and\nthat he had done so in circumstances of peculiar difficulty! Poor Mr.\nGibson,--we hardly know whether most to pity him, or the unfortunate,\npoor woman who ultimately became Mrs. Gibson.\n\n\"And so Bella French is to be the fortunate woman after all,\" said\nMiss Stanbury to her niece.\n\n\"It does seem to me to be so odd,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder how he\nlooked when he proposed it.\"\n\n\"Like a fool,--as he always does.\"\n\nDorothy refrained from remarking that Miss Stanbury had not always\nthought that Mr. Gibson looked like a fool, but the idea occurred to\nher mind. \"I hope they will be happy at last,\" she said.\n\n\"Pshaw! Such people can't be happy, and can't be unhappy. I don't\nsuppose it much matters which he marries, or whether he marries them\nboth, or neither. They are to be married by banns, they say,--at\nHeavitree.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything bad in that.\"\n\n\"Only Camilla might step out and forbid them,\" said Aunt Stanbury. \"I\nalmost wish she would.\"\n\n\"She has gone away, aunt,--to an uncle who lives at Gloucester.\"\n\n\"It was well to get her out of the way, no doubt. They'll be married\nbefore you now, Dolly.\"\n\n\"That won't break my heart, aunt.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there'll be much of a wedding. They haven't anybody\nbelonging to them, except that uncle at Gloucester.\" Then there was a\npause. \"I think it is a nice thing for friends to collect together at\na wedding,\" continued Aunt Stanbury.\n\n\"I think it is,\" said Dorothy, in the mildest, softest voice.\n\n\"I suppose we must make room for that black sheep of a brother of\nyours, Dolly,--or else you won't be contented.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dearest aunt!\" said Dorothy, falling down on her knees\nat her aunt's feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\n\nSELF-SACRIFICE.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nTrevelyan, when his wife had left him, sat for hours in silence\npondering over his own position and hers. He had taken his child to\nan upper room, in which was his own bed and the boy's cot, and before\nhe seated himself, he spread out various toys which he had been at\npains to purchase for the unhappy little fellow,--a regiment of\nGaribaldian soldiers, all with red shirts, and a drum to give the\nregiment martial spirit, and a soft fluffy Italian ball, and a\nbattledore and a shuttlecock,--instruments enough for juvenile joy,\nif only there had been a companion with whom the child could use\nthem. But the toys remained where the father had placed them, almost\nunheeded, and the child sat looking out of the window, melancholy,\nsilent, and repressed. Even the drum did not tempt him to be noisy.\nDoubtless he did not know why he was wretched, but he was fully\nconscious of his wretchedness. In the meantime the father sat\nmotionless, in an old worn-out but once handsome leathern arm-chair,\nwith his eyes fixed against the opposite wall, thinking of the wreck\nof his life.\n\nThought deep, correct, continued, and energetic is quite compatible\nwith madness. At this time Trevelyan's mind was so far unhinged, his\nordinary faculties were so greatly impaired, that they who declared\nhim to be mad were justified in their declaration. His condition was\nsuch that the happiness and welfare of no human being,--not even his\nown,--could safely be entrusted to his keeping. He considered himself\nto have been so injured by the world, to have been the victim of so\ncruel a conspiracy among those who ought to have been his friends,\nthat there remained nothing for him but to flee away from them and\nremain in solitude. But yet, through it all, there was something\napproaching to a conviction that he had brought his misery upon\nhimself by being unlike to other men; and he declared to himself\nover and over again that it was better that he should suffer than\nthat others should be punished. When he was alone his reflections\nrespecting his wife were much juster than were his words when he\nspoke either with her, or to others, of her conduct. He would declare\nto himself not only that he did not believe her to have been false to\nhim, but that he had never accused her of such crime. He had demanded\nfrom her obedience, and she had been disobedient. It had been\nincumbent upon him,--so ran his own ideas, as expressed to himself\nin these long unspoken soliloquies,--to exact obedience, or at least\ncompliance, let the consequences be what they might. She had refused\nto obey or even to comply, and the consequences were very grievous.\nBut, though he pitied himself with a pity that was feminine, yet he\nacknowledged to himself that her conduct had been the result of his\nown moody temperament. Every friend had parted from him. All those to\nwhose counsels he had listened, had counselled him that he was wrong.\nThe whole world was against him. Had he remained in England, the\ndoctors and lawyers among them would doubtless have declared him to\nbe mad. He knew all this, and yet he could not yield. He could not\nsay that he had been wrong. He could not even think that he had been\nwrong as to the cause of the great quarrel. He was one so miserable\nand so unfortunate,--so he thought,--that even in doing right he had\nfallen into perdition!\n\nHe had had two enemies, and between them they had worked his ruin.\nThese were Colonel Osborne and Bozzle. It may be doubted whether he\ndid not hate the latter the more strongly of the two. He knew now\nthat Bozzle had been untrue to him, but his disgust did not spring\nfrom that so much as from the feeling that he had defiled himself by\ndealing with the man. Though he was quite assured that he had been\nright in his first cause of offence, he knew that he had fallen from\nbad to worse in every step that he had taken since. Colonel Osborne\nhad marred his happiness by vanity, by wicked intrigue, by a devilish\ndelight in doing mischief; but he, he himself, had consummated the\nevil by his own folly. Why had he not taken Colonel Osborne by the\nthroat, instead of going to a low-born, vile, mercenary spy for\nassistance? He hated himself for what he had done;--and yet it was\nimpossible that he should yield.\n\nIt was impossible that he should yield;--but it was yet open to him\nto sacrifice himself. He could not go back to his wife and say that\nhe was wrong; but he could determine that the destruction should\nfall upon him and not upon her. If he gave up his child and then\ndied,--died, alone, without any friend near him, with no word of love\nin his ears, in that solitary and miserable abode which he had found\nfor himself,--then it would at least be acknowledged that he had\nexpiated the injury that he had done. She would have his wealth, his\nname, his child to comfort her,--and would be troubled no longer by\ndemands for that obedience which she had sworn at the altar to give\nhim, and which she had since declined to render to him. Perhaps there\nwas some feeling that the coals of fire would be hot upon her head\nwhen she should think how much she had received from him and how\nlittle she had done for him. And yet he loved her, with all his\nheart, and would even yet dream of bliss that might be possible with\nher,--had not the terrible hand of irresistible Fate come between\nthem and marred it all. It was only a dream now. It could be no more\nthan a dream. He put out his thin wasted hands and looked at them,\nand touched the hollowness of his own cheeks, and coughed that he\nmight hear the hacking sound of his own infirmity, and almost took\nglory in his weakness. It could not be long before the coals of fire\nwould be heaped upon her head.\n\n\"Louey,\" he said at last, addressing the child who had sat for an\nhour gazing through the window without stirring a limb or uttering a\nsound; \"Louey, my boy, would you like to go back to mamma?\" The child\nturned round on the floor, and fixed his eyes on his father's face,\nbut made no immediate reply. \"Louey, dear, come to papa and tell him.\nWould it be nice to go back to mamma?\" And he stretched out his hand\nto the boy. Louey got up, and approached slowly and stood between his\nfather's knees. \"Tell me, darling;--you understand what papa says?\"\n\n\"Altro!\" said the boy, who had been long enough among Italian\nservants to pick up the common words of the language. Of course he\nwould like to go back. How indeed could it be otherwise?\n\n\"Then you shall go to her, Louey.\"\n\n\"To-day, papa?\"\n\n\"Not to-day, nor to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But the day after?\"\n\n\"That is sufficient. You shall go. It is not so bad with you that one\nday more need be a sorrow to you. You shall go,--and then you will\nnever see your father again!\" Trevelyan as he said this drew his\nhands away so as not to touch the child. The little fellow had put\nout his arm, but seeing his father's angry gesture had made no\nfurther attempt at a caress. He feared his father from the bottom of\nhis little heart, and yet was aware that it was his duty to try to\nlove papa. He did not understand the meaning of that last threat,\nbut slunk back, passing his untouched toys, to the window, and there\nseated himself again, filling his mind with the thought that when two\nmore long long days should have crept by, he should once more go to\nhis mother.\n\nTrevelyan had tried his best to be soft and gentle to his child.\nAll that he had said to his wife of his treatment of the boy had\nbeen true to the letter. He had spared no personal trouble, he had\ndone all that he had known how to do, he had exercised all his\nintelligence to procure amusement for the boy;--but Louey had hardly\nsmiled since he had been taken from his mother. And now that he was\ntold that he was to go and never see his father again, the tidings\nwere to him simply tidings of joy. \"There is a curse upon me,\" said\nTrevelyan; \"it is written down in the book of my destiny that nothing\nshall ever love me!\"\n\nHe went out from the house, and made his way down by the narrow path\nthrough the olives and vines to the bottom of the hill in front of\nthe villa. It was evening now, but the evening was very hot, and\nthough the olive trees stood in long rows, there was no shade. Quite\nat the bottom of the hill there was a little sluggish muddy brook,\nalong the sides of which the reeds grew thickly and the dragon-flies\nwere playing on the water. There was nothing attractive in the spot,\nbut he was weary, and sat himself down on the dry hard bank which had\nbeen made by repeated clearing of mud from the bottom of the little\nrivulet. He sat watching the dragon-flies as they made their short\nflights in the warm air, and told himself that of all God's creatures\nthere was not one to whom less power of disporting itself in God's\nsun was given than to him. Surely it would be better for him that he\nshould die, than live as he was now living without any of the joys of\nlife. The solitude of Casalunga was intolerable to him, and yet there\nwas no whither that he could go and find society. He could travel if\nhe pleased. He had money at command, and, at any rate as yet, there\nwas no embargo on his personal liberty. But how could he travel\nalone,--even if his strength might suffice for the work? There had\nbeen moments in which he had thought that he would be happy in the\nlove of his child,--that the companionship of an infant would suffice\nfor him if only the infant would love him. But all such dreams as\nthat were over. To repay him for his tenderness his boy was always\ndumb before him. Louey would not prattle as he had used to do. He\nwould not even smile, or give back the kisses with which his father\nhad attempted to win him. In mercy to the boy he would send him back\nto his mother;--in mercy to the boy if not to the mother also. It was\nin vain that he should look for any joy in any quarter. Were he to\nreturn to England, they would say that he was mad!\n\n\n   [Illustration: Trevelyan at Casalunga.]\n\n\nHe lay there by the brook-side till the evening was far advanced,\nand then he arose and slowly returned to the house. The labour of\nascending the hill was so great to him that he was forced to pause\nand hold by the olive trees as he slowly performed his task. The\nperspiration came in profusion from his pores, and he found himself\nto be so weak that he must in future regard the brook as being beyond\nthe tether of his daily exercise. Eighteen months ago he had been a\nstrong walker, and the snow-bound paths of Swiss mountains had been\na joy to him. He paused as he was slowly dragging himself on, and\nlooked up at the wretched, desolate, comfortless abode which he\ncalled his home. Its dreariness was so odious to him that he was\nhalf-minded to lay himself down where he was, and let the night air\ncome upon him and do its worst. In such case, however, some Italian\ndoctor would be sent down who would say that he was mad. Above\nall the things, and to the last, he must save himself from that\ndegradation.\n\nWhen he had crawled up to the house, he went to his child, and found\nthat the woman had put the boy to bed. Then he was angry with himself\nin that he himself had not seen to this, and kept up his practice\nof attending the child to the last. He would, at least, be true to\nhis resolution, and prepare for the boy's return to his mother. Not\nknowing how otherwise to manage it, he wrote that night the following\nnote to Mr. Glascock;--\n\n\n   Casalunga, Thursday night.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,\n\n   Since you last were considerate enough to call upon me I\n   have resolved to take a step in my affairs which, though\n   it will rob me of my only remaining gratification, will\n   tend to lessen the troubles under which Mrs. Trevelyan is\n   labouring. If she desires it, as no doubt she does, I will\n   consent to place our boy again in her custody,--trusting\n   to her sense of honour to restore him to me should I\n   demand it. In my present unfortunate position I cannot\n   suggest that she should come for the boy. I am unable to\n   support the excitement occasioned by her presence. I will,\n   however, deliver up my darling either to you, or to any\n   messenger sent by you whom I can trust. I beg heartily\n   to apologise for the trouble I am giving you, and to\n   subscribe myself yours very faithfully,\n\n   LOUIS TREVELYAN.\n\n   The Hon. C. Glascock.\n\n   P.S.--It is as well, perhaps, that I should explain that\n   I must decline to receive any visit from Sir Marmaduke\n   Rowley. Sir Marmaduke has insulted me grossly on each\n   occasion on which I have seen him since his return home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\n\nTHE BATHS OF LUCCA.\n\n\nJune was now far advanced, and the Rowleys and the Spaldings had\nremoved from Florence to the Baths of Lucca. Mr. Glascock had\nfollowed in their wake, and the whole party were living at the Baths\nin one of those hotels in which so many English and Americans are\nwont to congregate in the early weeks of the Italian summer. The\nmarriage was to take place in the last week of the month; and all\nthe party were to return to Florence for the occasion,--with the\nexception of Sir Marmaduke and Mrs. Trevelyan. She was altogether\nunfitted for wedding joys, and her father had promised to bear her\ncompany when the others left her. Mr. Glascock and Caroline Spalding\nwere to be married in Florence, and were to depart immediately from\nthence for some of the cooler parts of Switzerland. After that\nSir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley were to return to London with their\ndaughters, preparatory to that dreary journey back to the Mandarins;\nand they had not even yet resolved what they had better do respecting\nthat unfortunate man who was living in seclusion on the hill-top near\nSiena. They had consulted lawyers and doctors in Florence, but it had\nseemed that everybody there was afraid of putting the law in force\nagainst an Englishman. Doubtless there was a law in respect to the\ncustody of the insane; and it was admitted that if Trevelyan were\ndangerously mad something could be done; but it seemed that nobody\nwas willing to stir in such a case as that which now existed.\nSomething, it was said, might be done at some future time; but the\ndifficulties were so great that nothing could be done now.\n\nIt was very sad, because it was necessary that some decision\nshould be made as to the future residence of Mrs. Trevelyan and of\nNora. Emily had declared that nothing should induce her to go to\nthe Islands with her father and mother unless her boy went with\nher. Since her journey to Casalunga she had also expressed her\nunwillingness to leave her husband. Her heart had been greatly\nsoftened towards him, and she had declared that where he remained,\nthere would she remain,--as near to him as circumstances would admit.\nIt might be that at last her care would be necessary for his comfort.\nHe supplied her with means of living, and she would use these means\nas well as she might be able in his service.\n\nThen there had arisen the question of Nora's future residence. And\nthere had come troubles and storms in the family. Nora had said that\nshe would not go back to the Mandarins, but had not at first been\nable to say where or how she would live. She had suggested that\nshe might stay with her sister, but her father had insisted that\nshe could not live on the income supplied by Trevelyan. Then, when\npressed hard, she had declared that she intended to live on Hugh\nStanbury's income. She would marry him at once,--with her father's\nleave, if she could get it, but without it if it needs must be so.\nHer mother told her that Hugh Stanbury was not himself ready for her;\nhe had not even proposed so hasty a marriage, nor had he any home\nfitted for her. Lady Rowley, in arguing this, had expressed no assent\nto the marriage, even as a distant arrangement, but had thought\nthus to vanquish her daughter by suggesting small but insuperable\ndifficulties. On a sudden, however, Lady Rowley found that all\nthis was turned against her, by an offer that came direct from Mr.\nGlascock. His Caroline, he said, was very anxious that Nora should\ncome to them at Monkhams as soon as they had returned home from\nSwitzerland. They intended to be there by the middle of August, and\nwould hurry there sooner, if there was any intermediate difficulty\nabout finding a home for Nora. Mr. Glascock said nothing about Hugh\nStanbury; but, of course, Lady Rowley understood that Nora had told\nall her troubles and hopes to Caroline, and that Caroline had told\nthem to her future husband. Lady Rowley, in answer to this, could\nonly say that she would consult her husband.\n\nThere was something very grievous in the proposition to Lady Rowley.\nIf Nora had not been self-willed and stiff-necked beyond the usual\nself-willedness and stiff-neckedness of young women she might have\nbeen herself the mistress of Monkhams. It was proposed now that she\nshould go there to wait till a poor man should have got together\nshillings enough to buy a few chairs and tables, and a bed to lie\nupon! The thought of this was very bitter. \"I cannot think, Nora, how\nyou could have the heart to go there,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"I cannot understand why not, mamma. Caroline and I are friends, and\nsurely he and I need not be enemies. He has never injured me; and if\nhe does not take offence, why should I?\"\n\n\"If you don't see it, I can't help it,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Spalding's triumph was terrible to Lady Rowley. Mrs.\nSpalding knew nothing of her future son-in-law's former passion, and\nspoke of her Caroline as having achieved triumphs beyond the reach of\nother girls. Lady Rowley bore it, never absolutely telling the tale\nof her daughter's fruitless victory. She was too good at heart to\nutter the boast;--but it was very hard to repress it. Upon the whole\nshe would have preferred that Mr. Glascock and his bride should not\nhave become the fast friends of herself and her family. There was\nmore of pain than of pleasure in the alliance. But circumstances\nhad been too strong for her. Mr. Glascock had been of great use in\nreference to Trevelyan, and Caroline and Nora had become attached\nto each other almost on their first acquaintance. Here they were\ntogether at the Baths of Lucca, and Nora was to be one of the four\nbridesmaids. When Sir Marmaduke was consulted about this visit to\nMonkhams, he became fretful, and would give no answer. The marriage,\nhe said, was impossible, and Nora was a fool. He could give her no\nallowance more than would suffice for her clothes, and it was madness\nfor her to think of stopping in England. But he was so full of cares\nthat he could come to no absolute decision on this matter. Nora,\nhowever, had come to a very absolute decision.\n\n\"Caroline,\" she said, \"if you will have me, I will go to Monkhams.\"\n\n\"Of course we will have you. Has not Charles said how delighted he\nwould be?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,--your Charles,\" said Nora, laughing.\n\n\"He is mine now, dear. You must not expect him to change his mind\nagain. I gave him the chance, you know, and he would not take it.\nBut, Nora, come to Monkhams, and stay as long as it suits. I have\ntalked it all over with him, and we both agree that you shall have\na home there. You shall be just like a sister. Olivia is coming too\nafter a bit; but he says there is room for a dozen sisters. Of course\nit will be all right with Mr. Stanbury after a while.\" And so it was\nsettled among them that Nora Rowley should find a home at Monkhams,\nif a home in England should be wanted for her.\n\nIt wanted but four days to that fixed for the marriage at Florence,\nand but six to that on which the Rowleys were to leave Italy for\nEngland, when Mr. Glascock received Trevelyan's letter. It was\nbrought to him as he was sitting at a late breakfast in the garden\nof the hotel; and there were present at the moment not only all the\nSpalding family, but the Rowleys also. Sir Marmaduke was there and\nLady Rowley, and the three unmarried daughters; but Mrs. Trevelyan,\nas was her wont, had remained alone in her own room. Mr. Glascock\nread the letter, and read it again, without attracting much\nattention. Caroline, who was of course sitting next to him, had her\neyes upon him, and could see that the letter moved him; but she was\nnot curious, and at any rate asked no question. He himself understood\nfully how great was the offer made,--how all-important to the\nhappiness of the poor mother,--and he was also aware, or thought\nthat he was aware, how likely it might be that the offer would be\nretracted. As regarded himself, a journey from the Baths at Lucca to\nCasalunga and back before his marriage, would be a great infliction\non his patience. It was his plan to stay where he was till the day\nbefore his marriage, and then to return to Florence with the rest\nof the party. All this must be altered, and sudden changes must be\nmade, if he decided on going to Siena himself. The weather now was\nvery hot, and such a journey would be most disagreeable to him. Of\ncourse he had little schemes in his head, little amatory schemes\nfor pr\u00c3\u00a6nuptial enjoyment, which, in spite of his mature years,\nwere exceedingly agreeable to him. The chestnut woods round the\nBaths of Lucca are very pleasant in the early summer, and there\nwere excursions planned in which Caroline would be close to his\nside,--almost already his wife. But, if he did not go, whom could he\nsend? It would be necessary at least that he should consult her, the\nmother of the child, before any decision was formed.\n\nAt last he took Lady Rowley aside, and read to her the letter. She\nunderstood at once that it opened almost a heaven of bliss to her\ndaughter;--and she understood also how probable it might be that that\nwretched man, with his shaken wits, should change his mind. \"I think\nI ought to go,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"But how can you go now?\"\n\n\"I can go,\" said he. \"There is time for it. It need not put off my\nmarriage,--to which of course I could not consent. I do not know whom\nI could send.\"\n\n\"Monnier could go,\" said Lady Rowley, naming the courier.\n\n\"Yes;--he could go. But it might be that he would return without\nthe child, and then we should not forgive ourselves. I will go,\nLady Rowley. After all, what does it signify? I am a little old, I\nsometimes think, for this philandering. You shall take this letter to\nyour daughter, and I will explain it all to Caroline.\"\n\nCaroline had not a word to say. She could only kiss him, and promise\nto make him what amends she could when he came back. \"Of course you\nare right,\" she said. \"Do you think that I would say a word against\nit, even though the marriage were to be postponed?\"\n\n\"I should;--a good many words. But I will be back in time for that,\nand will bring the boy with me.\"\n\nMrs. Trevelyan, when her husband's letter was read to her, was almost\novercome by the feelings which it excited. In her first paroxysm of\njoy she declared that she would herself go to Siena, not for her\nchild's sake, but for that of her husband. She felt at once that the\nboy was being given up because of the father's weakness,--because\nhe felt himself to be unable to be a protector to his son,--and\nher woman's heart was melted with softness as she thought of the\ncondition of the man to whom she had once given her whole heart.\nSince then, doubtless, her heart had revolted from him. Since that\ntime there had come hours in which she had almost hated him for his\ncruelty to her. There had been moments in which she had almost cursed\nhis name because of the aspersion which it had seemed that he had\nthrown upon her. But this was now forgotten, and she remembered only\nhis weakness. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"I will go. It is my duty to go to\nhim.\" But Lady Rowley withheld her, explaining that were she to go,\nthe mission might probably fail in its express purpose. \"Let Louey be\nsent to us first,\" said Lady Rowley, \"and then we will see what can\nbe done afterwards.\"\n\nAnd so Mr. Glascock started, taking with him a maid-servant who might\nhelp him with the charge of the child. It was certainly very hard\nupon him. In order to have time for his journey to Siena and back,\nand time also to go out to Casalunga, it was necessary that he should\nleave the Baths at five in the morning. \"If ever there was a hero of\nromance, you are he!\" said Nora to him.\n\n\"The heroes of life are so much better than the heroes of romance,\"\nsaid Caroline.\n\n\"That is a lesson from the lips of the American Browning,\" said Mr.\nGlascock. \"Nevertheless, I think I would rather ride a charge against\na Paynim knight in Palestine than get up at half-past four in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"We will get up too, and give the knight his coffee,\" said Nora.\nThey did get up, and saw him off; and when Mr. Glascock and Caroline\nparted with a lover's embrace, Nora stood by as a sister might have\ndone. Let us hope that she remembered that her own time was coming.\n\nThere had been a promise given by Nora, when she left London, that\nshe would not correspond with Hugh Stanbury while she was in Italy,\nand this promise had been kept. It may be remembered that Hugh had\nmade a proposition to his lady-love, that she should walk out of the\nhouse one fine morning, and get herself married without any reference\nto her father's or her mother's wishes. But she had not been willing\nto take upon herself as yet independence so complete as this would\nhave required. She had assured her lover that she did mean to marry\nhim some day, even though it should be in opposition to her father,\nbut that she thought that the period for filial persuasion was not\nyet over; and then, in explaining all this to her mother, she had\ngiven a promise neither to write nor to receive letters during the\nshort period of her sojourn in Italy. She would be an obedient child\nfor so long;--but, after that, she must claim the right to fight her\nown battle. She had told her lover that he must not write; and, of\ncourse, she had not written a word herself. But now, when her mother\nthrew it in her teeth that Stanbury would not be ready to marry her,\nshe thought that an unfair advantage was being taken of her,--and of\nhim. How could he be expected to say that he was ready,--deprived as\nhe was of the power of saying anything at all?\n\n\"Mamma,\" she said, the day before they went to Florence, \"has papa\nfixed about your leaving England yet? I suppose you'll go now on the\nlast Saturday in July?\"\n\n\"I suppose we shall, my dear.\"\n\n\"Has not papa written about the berths?\"\n\n\"I believe he has, my dear.\"\n\n\"Because he ought to know who are going. I will not go.\"\n\n\"You will not, Nora. Is that a proper way of speaking?\"\n\n\"Dear mamma, I mean it to be proper. I hope it is proper. But is it\nnot best that we should understand each other? All my life depends on\nmy going or my staying now. I must decide.\"\n\n\"After what has passed, you do not, I suppose, mean to live in Mr.\nGlascock's house?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I mean to live with,--with,--with my husband. Mamma,\nI promised not to write, and I have not written. And he has not\nwritten,--because I told him not. Therefore, nothing is settled. But\nit is not fair to throw it in my teeth that nothing is settled.\"\n\n\"I have thrown nothing in your teeth, Nora.\"\n\n\"Papa talks sneeringly about chairs and tables. Of course, I know\nwhat he is thinking of. As I cannot go with him to the Mandarins, I\nthink I ought to be allowed to look after the chairs and tables.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, my dear?\"\n\n\"That you should absolve me from my promise, and let me write to Mr.\nStanbury. I do not want to be left without a home.\"\n\n\"You cannot wish to write to a gentleman and ask him to marry you!\"\n\n\"Why not? We are engaged. I shall not ask him to marry me,--that is\nalready settled; but I shall ask him to make arrangements.\"\n\n\"Your papa will be very angry if you break your word to him.\"\n\n\"I will write, and show you the letter. Papa may see it, and if he\nwill not let it go, it shall not go. He shall not say that I broke my\nword. But, mamma, I will not go out to the Islands. I should never\nget back again, and I should be broken-hearted.\" Lady Rowley had\nnothing to say to this; and Nora went and wrote her letter. \"Dear\nHugh,\" the letter ran, \"Papa and mamma leave England on the last\nSaturday in July. I have told mamma that I cannot return with them.\nOf course, you know why I stay. Mr. Glascock is to be married the day\nafter to-morrow, and they have asked me to go with them to Monkhams\nsome time in August. I think I shall do so, unless Emily wants me to\nremain with her. At any rate, I shall try to be with her till I go\nthere. You will understand why I tell you all this. Papa and mamma\nknow that I am writing. It is only a business letter, and, therefore,\nI shall say no more, except that I am ever and always yours,--NORA.\"\n\"There,\" she said, handing her letter to her mother, \"I think that\nthat ought to be sent. If papa chooses to prevent its going, he can.\"\n\nLady Rowley, when she handed the letter to her husband, recommended\nthat it should be allowed to go to its destination. She admitted\nthat, if they sent it, they would thereby signify their consent to\nher engagement;--and she alleged that Nora was so strong in her will,\nand that the circumstances of their journey out to the Antipodes were\nso peculiar, that it was of no avail for them any longer to oppose\nthe match. They could not force their daughter to go with them.\n\"But I can cast her off from me, if she be disobedient,\" said Sir\nMarmaduke. Lady Rowley, however, had no desire that her daughter\nshould be cast off, and was aware that Sir Marmaduke, when it came\nto the point of casting off, would be as little inclined to be stern\nas she was herself. Sir Marmaduke, still hoping that firmness would\ncarry the day, and believing that it behoved him to maintain his\nparental authority, ended the discussion by keeping possession of the\nletter, and saying that he would take time to consider the matter.\n\"What security have we that he will ever marry her, if she does\nstay?\" he asked the next morning. Lady Rowley had no doubt on this\nscore, and protested that her opposition to Hugh Stanbury arose\nsimply from his want of income. \"I should never be justified,\" said\nSir Marmaduke, \"if I were to go and leave my girl as it were in the\nhands of a penny-a-liner.\" The letter, in the end, was not sent; and\nNora and her father hardly spoke to each other as they made their\njourney back to Florence together.\n\nEmily Trevelyan, before the arrival of that letter from her husband,\nhad determined that she would not leave Italy. It had been her\npurpose to remain somewhere in the neighbourhood of her husband and\nchild; and to overcome her difficulties,--or be overcome by them, as\ncircumstances might direct. Now her plans were again changed,--or,\nrather, she was now without a plan. She could form no plan till\nshe should again see Mr. Glascock. Should her child be restored to\nher, would it not be her duty to remain near her husband? All this\nmade Nora's line of conduct the more difficult for her. It was\nacknowledged that she could not remain in Italy. Mrs. Trevelyan's\nposition would be most embarrassing; but as all her efforts were to\nbe used towards a reconciliation with her husband, and as his state\nutterly precluded the idea of a mixed household,--of any such a\nfamily arrangement as that which had existed in Curzon Street,--Nora\ncould not remain with her. Mrs. Trevelyan herself had declared that\nshe would not wish it. And, in that case, where was Nora to bestow\nherself when Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley had sailed? Caroline\noffered to curtail those honeymoon weeks in Switzerland, but it was\nimpossible to listen to an offer so magnanimous and so unreasonable.\nNora had a dim romantic idea of sharing Priscilla's bed-room in that\nsmall cottage near Nuncombe Putney, of which she had heard, and of\nthere learning lessons in strict economy;--but of this she said\nnothing. The short journey from the Baths of Lucca to Florence was\nnot a pleasant one, and the Rowley family were much disturbed as they\nlooked into the future. Lodgings had now been taken for them, and\nthere was the great additional doubt whether Mrs. Trevelyan would\nfind her child there on her arrival.\n\nThe Spaldings went one way from the Florence station, and the Rowleys\nanother. The American Minister had returned to the city some days\npreviously,--drawn there nominally by pleas of business, but, in\ntruth, by the necessities of the wedding breakfast,--and he met them\nat the station. \"Has Mr. Glascock come back?\" Nora was the first to\nask. Yes;--he had come. He had been in the city since two o'clock,\nand had been up at the American Minister's house for half a minute.\n\"And has he brought the child?\" asked Caroline, relieved of doubt\non her own account. Mr. Spalding did not know;--indeed, he had not\ninterested himself quite so intently about Mrs. Trevelyan's little\nboy, as had all those who had just returned from the Baths. Mr.\nGlascock had said nothing to him about the child, and he had not\nquite understood why such a man should have made a journey to Siena,\nleaving his sweetheart behind him, just on the eve of his marriage.\nHe hurried his women-kind into their carriage, and they were driven\naway; and then Sir Marmaduke was driven away with his women-kind.\nCaroline Spalding had perhaps thought that Mr. Glascock might have\nbeen there to meet her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\n\nMR. GLASCOCK AS NURSE.\n\n\nA message had been sent by the wires to Trevelyan, to let him know\nthat Mr. Glascock was himself coming for the boy. Whether such\nmessage would or would not be sent out to Casalunga Mr. Glascock had\nbeen quite ignorant;--but it could, at any rate, do no harm. He did\nfeel it hard as in this hot weather he made the journey, first to\nFlorence, and then on to Siena. What was he to the Rowleys, or to\nTrevelyan himself, that such a job of work should fall to his lot at\nsuch a period of his life? He had been very much in love with Nora,\nno doubt; but, luckily for him, as he thought, Nora had refused him.\nAs for Trevelyan,--Trevelyan had never been his friend. As for Sir\nMarmaduke,--Sir Marmaduke was nothing to him. He was almost angry\neven with Mrs. Trevelyan as he arrived tired, heated, and very dusty,\nat Siena. It was his purpose to sleep at Siena that night, and to\ngo out to Casalunga early the next morning. If the telegram had not\nbeen forwarded, he would send a message on that evening. On inquiry,\nhowever, he found that the message had been sent, and that the paper\nhad been put into the Signore's own hand by the Sienese messenger.\nThen he got into some discourse with the landlord about the strange\ngentleman at Casalunga. Trevelyan was beginning to become the subject\nof gossip in the town, and people were saying that the stranger was\nvery strange indeed. The landlord thought that if the Signore had\nany friends at all, it would be well that such friends should come\nand look after him. Mr. Glascock asked if Mr. Trevelyan was ill. It\nwas not only that the Signore was out of health,--so the landlord\nheard,--but that he was also somewhat-- And then the landlord touched\nhis head. He eat nothing, and went nowhere, and spoke to no one; and\nthe people at the hospital to which Casalunga belonged were beginning\nto be uneasy about their tenant. Perhaps Mr. Glascock had come to\ntake him away. Mr. Glascock explained that he had not come to take\nMr. Trevelyan away,--but only to take away a little boy that was with\nhim. For this reason he was travelling with a maid-servant,--a fact\nfor which Mr. Glascock clearly thought it necessary that he should\ngive an intelligible and credible explanation. The landlord seemed to\nthink that the people at the hospital would have been much rejoiced\nhad Mr. Glascock intended to take Mr. Trevelyan away also.\n\nHe started after a very early breakfast, and found himself walking\nup over the stone ridges to the house between nine and ten in the\nmorning. He himself had sat beside the driver and had put the maid\ninside the carriage. He had not deemed it wise to take an undivided\ncharge of the boy even from Casalunga to Siena. At the door of the\nhouse, as though waiting for him, he found Trevelyan, not dirty as he\nhad been before, but dressed with much appearance of smartness. He\nhad a brocaded cap on his head, and a shirt with a laced front, and a\nworked waistcoat, and a frock coat, and coloured bright trousers. Mr.\nGlascock knew at once that all the clothes which he saw before him\nhad been made for Italian and not for English wear; and could almost\nhave said that they had been bought in Siena and not in Florence.\n\"I had not intended to impose this labour on you, Mr. Glascock,\"\nTrevelyan said, raising his cap to salute his visitor.\n\n\"For fear there might be mistakes, I thought it better to come\nmyself,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"You did not wish to see Sir Marmaduke?\"\n\n\"Certainly not Sir Marmaduke,\" said Trevelyan, with a look of anger\nthat was almost grotesque.\n\n\"And you thought it better that Mrs. Trevelyan should not come.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I thought it better;--but not from any feeling of anger\ntowards her. If I could welcome my wife here, Mr. Glascock, without\na risk of wrath on her part, I should be very happy to receive her.\nI love my wife, Mr. Glascock. I love her dearly. But there have been\nmisfortunes. Never mind. There is no reason why I should trouble you\nwith them. Let us go in to breakfast. After your drive you will have\nan appetite.\"\n\nPoor Mr. Glascock was afraid to decline to sit down to the meal which\nwas prepared for him. He did mutter something about having already\neaten, but Trevelyan put this aside with a wave of his hand as he led\nthe way into a spacious room, in which had been set out a table with\nalmost a sumptuous banquet. The room was very bare and comfortless,\nhaving neither curtains nor matting, and containing not above half\na dozen chairs. But an effort had been made to give it an air of\nItalian luxury. The windows were thrown open, down to the ground, and\nthe table was decorated with fruits and three or four long-necked\nbottles. Trevelyan waved with his hand towards an arm-chair, and Mr.\nGlascock had no alternative but to seat himself. He felt that he was\nsitting down to breakfast with a madman; but if he did not sit down,\nthe madman might perhaps break out into madness. Then Trevelyan went\nto the door and called aloud for Catarina. \"In these remote places,\"\nsaid he, \"one has to do without the civilisation of a bell. Perhaps\none gains as much in quiet as one loses in comfort.\" Then Catarina\ncame with hot meats and fried potatoes, and Mr. Glascock was\ncompelled to help himself.\n\n\"I am but a bad trencherman myself,\" said Trevelyan, \"but I shall\nlament my misfortune doubly if that should interfere with your\nappetite.\" Then he got up and poured out wine into Mr. Glascock's\nglass. \"They tell me that it comes from the Baron's vineyard,\" said\nTrevelyan, alluding to the wine-farm of Ricasoli, \"and that there is\nnone better in Tuscany. I never was myself a judge of the grape, but\nthis to me is as palatable as any of the costlier French wines. How\ngrand a thing would wine really be, if it could make glad the heart\nof man. How truly would one worship Bacchus if he could make one's\nheart to rejoice. But if a man have a real sorrow, wine will not wash\nit away,--not though a man were drowned in it, as Clarence was.\"\n\nMr. Glascock hitherto had spoken hardly a word. There was an attempt\nat joviality about this breakfast,--or, at any rate, of the usual\ncomfortable luxury of hospitable entertainment,--which, coming as it\ndid from Trevelyan, almost locked his lips. He had not come there to\nbe jovial or luxurious, but to perform a most melancholy mission; and\nhe had brought with him his saddest looks, and was prepared for a\nfew sad words. Trevelyan's speech, indeed, was sad enough, but Mr.\nGlascock could not take up questions of the worship of Bacchus at\nhalf a minute's warning. He eat a morsel, and raised his glass to his\nlips, and felt himself to be very uncomfortable. It was necessary,\nhowever, that he should utter a word. \"Do you not let your little boy\ncome in to breakfast?\" he said.\n\n\"He is better away,\" said Trevelyan gloomily.\n\n\"But as we are to travel together,\" said Mr. Glascock, \"we might as\nwell make acquaintance.\"\n\n\"You have been a little hurried with me on that score,\" said\nTrevelyan. \"I wrote certainly with a determined mind, but things have\nchanged somewhat since then.\"\n\n\"You do not mean that you will not send him?\"\n\n\"You have been somewhat hurried with me, I say. If I remember\nrightly, I named no time, but spoke of the future. Could I have\nanswered the message which I received from you, I would have\npostponed your visit for a week or so.\"\n\n\"Postponed it! Why,--I am to be married the day after to-morrow.\nIt was just as much as I was able to do, to come here at all.\" Mr.\nGlascock now pushed his chair back from the table, and prepared\nhimself to speak up. \"Your wife expects her child now, and you will\nbreak her heart by refusing to send him.\"\n\n\"Nobody thinks of my heart, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"But this is your own offer.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was my own offer, certainly. I am not going to deny my own\nwords, which have no doubt been preserved in testimony against me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Trevelyan, what do you mean?\" Then, when he was on the point of\nboiling over with passion, Mr. Glascock remembered that his companion\nwas not responsible for his expressions. \"I do hope you will let\nthe child go away with me,\" he said. \"You cannot conceive the state\nof his mother's anxiety, and she will send him back at once if you\ndemand it.\"\n\n\"Is that to be in good faith?\"\n\n\"Certainly, in good faith. I would lend myself to nothing, Mr.\nTrevelyan, that was not said and done in good faith.\"\n\n\"She will not break her word, excusing herself, because I am--mad?\"\n\n\"I am sure that there is nothing of the kind in her mind.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not now; but such things grow. There is no iniquity, no\nbreach of promise, no treason that a woman will not excuse to\nherself,--or a man either,--by the comfortable self-assurance that\nthe person to be injured is--mad. A hound without a friend is not so\ncruelly treated. The outlaw, the murderer, the perjurer has surer\nprivileges than the man who is in the way, and to whom his friends\ncan point as being--mad!\" Mr. Glascock knew or thought that he knew\nthat his host in truth was mad, and he could not, therefore, answer\nthis tirade by an assurance that no such idea was likely to prevail.\n\"Have they told you, I wonder,\" continued Trevelyan, \"how it was\nthat, driven to force and an ambuscade for the recovery of my own\nchild, I waylaid my wife and took him from her? I have done nothing\nto forfeit my right as a man to the control of my own family. I\ndemanded that the boy should be sent to me, and she paid no attention\nto my words. I was compelled to vindicate my own authority; and then,\nbecause I claimed the right which belongs to a father, they said that\nI was--mad! Ay, and they would have proved it, too, had I not fled\nfrom my country and hidden myself in this desert. Think of that, Mr.\nGlascock! Now they have followed me here,--not out of love for me;\nand that man whom they call a governor comes and insults me; and my\nwife promises to be good to me, and says that she will forgive and\nforget! Can she ever forgive herself her own folly, and the cruelty\nthat has made shipwreck of my life? They can do nothing to me here;\nbut they would entice me home because there they have friends, and\ncan fee doctors,--with my own money,--and suborn lawyers, and put me\naway,--somewhere in the dark, where I shall be no more heard of among\nmen! As you are a man of honour, Mr. Glascock,--tell me; is it not\nso?\"\n\n\"I know nothing of their plans,--beyond this, that you wrote me word\nthat you would send them the boy.\"\n\n\"But I know their plans. What you say is true. I did write you\nword,--and I meant it. Mr. Glascock, sitting here alone from\nmorning to night, and lying down from night till morning, without\ncompanionship, without love, in utter misery, I taught myself to feel\nthat I should think more of her than of myself.\"\n\n\"If you are so unhappy here, come back yourself with the child. Your\nwife would desire nothing better.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and submit to her, and her father, and her mother. No,--Mr.\nGlascock; never, never. Let her come to me.\"\n\n\"But you will not receive her.\"\n\n\"Let her come in a proper spirit, and I will receive her. She is the\nwife of my bosom, and I will receive her with joy. But if she is to\ncome to me and tell me that she forgives me,--forgives me for the\nevil that she has done,--then, sir, she had better stay away. Mr.\nGlascock, you are going to be married. Believe me,--no man should\nsubmit to be forgiven by his wife. Everything must go astray if that\nbe done. I would rather encounter their mad doctors, one of them\nafter another till they had made me mad;--I would encounter anything\nrather than that. But, sir, you neither eat nor drink, and I fear\nthat my speech disturbs you.\"\n\nIt was like enough that it may have done so. Trevelyan, as he had\nbeen speaking, had walked about the room, going from one extremity to\nthe other with hurried steps, gesticulating with his arms, and every\nnow and then pushing back with his hands the long hair from off his\nforehead. Mr. Glascock was in truth very much disturbed. He had come\nthere with an express object; but, whenever he mentioned the child,\nthe father became almost rabid in his wrath. \"I have done very well,\nthank you,\" said Mr. Glascock. \"I will not eat any more, and I\nbelieve I must be thinking of going back to Siena.\"\n\n\"I had hoped you would spend the day with me, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"I am to be married, you see, in two days; and I must be in Florence\nearly to-morrow. I am to meet my--wife, as she will be, and the\nRowleys, and your wife. Upon my word I can't stay. Won't you just say\na word to the young woman and let the boy be got ready?\"\n\n\"I think not;--no, I think not.\"\n\n\"And am I to have had all this journey for nothing? You will have\nmade a fool of me in writing to me.\"\n\n\"I intended to be honest, Mr. Glascock.\"\n\n\"Stick to your honesty, and send the boy back to his mother. It will\nbe better for you, Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"Better for me! Nothing can be better for me. All must be worst. It\nwill be better for me, you say; and you ask me to give up the last\ndrop of cold water wherewith I can touch my parched lips. Even in my\nhell I had so much left to me of a limpid stream, and you tell me\nthat it will be better for me to pour it away. You may take him, Mr.\nGlascock. The woman will make him ready for you. What matters it\nwhether the fiery furnace be heated seven times, or only six;--in\neither degree the flames are enough! You may take him;--you may take\nhim.\" So saying, Trevelyan walked out of the window, leaving Mr.\nGlascock seated in his chair. He walked out of the window and went\ndown among the olive trees. He did not go far, however, but stood\nwith his arm round the stem of one of them, playing with the shoots\nof a vine with his hand. Mr. Glascock followed him to the window and\nstood looking at him for a few moments. But Trevelyan did not turn\nor move. There he stood gazing at the pale, cloudless, heat-laden,\nmotionless sky, thinking of his own sorrows, and remembering too,\ndoubtless, with the vanity of a madman, that he was probably being\nwatched in his reverie.\n\nMr. Glascock was too practical a man not to make the most of the\noffer that had been made to him, and he went back among the passages\nand called for Catarina. Before long he had two or three women with\nhim, including her whom he had brought from Florence, and among them\nLouey was soon made to appear, dressed for his journey, together with\na small trunk in which were his garments. It was quite clear that\nthe order for his departure had been given before that scene at the\nbreakfast-table, and that Trevelyan had not intended to go back from\nhis promise. Nevertheless Mr. Glascock thought it might be as well to\nhurry his departure, and he turned back to say the shortest possible\nword of farewell to Trevelyan in the garden. But when he got to the\nwindow, Trevelyan was not to be found among the olive trees. Mr.\nGlascock walked a few steps down the hill, looking for him, but\nseeing nothing of him, returned to the house. The elder woman said\nthat her master had not been there, and Mr. Glascock started with his\ncharge. Trevelyan was manifestly mad, and it was impossible to treat\nhim as a sane man would have been treated. Nevertheless, Mr. Glascock\nfelt much compunction in carrying the child away without a final kiss\nor word of farewell from its father. But it was not to be so. He\nhad got into the carriage with the child, having the servant seated\nopposite to him,--for he was moved by some undefinable fear which\nmade him determine to keep the boy close to him, and he had not,\ntherefore, returned to the driver's seat,--when Trevelyan appeared\nstanding by the road-side at the bottom of the hill. \"Would you take\nhim away from me without one word!\" said Trevelyan bitterly.\n\n\"I went to look for you but you were gone,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"No, sir, I was not gone. I am here. It is the last time that I shall\never gladden my eyes with his brightness. Louey, my love, will you\ncome to your father?\" Louey did not seem to be particularly willing\nto leave the carriage, but he made no loud objection when Mr.\nGlascock held him up to the open space above the door. The child had\nrealised the fact that he was to go, and did not believe that his\nfather would stop him now; but he was probably of opinion that the\nsooner the carriage began to go on the better it would be for him.\nMr. Glascock, thinking that his father intended to kiss him over the\ndoor, held him by his frock; but the doing of this made Trevelyan\nvery angry. \"Am I not to be trusted with my own child in my arms?\"\nsaid he. \"Give him to me, sir. I begin to doubt now whether I am\nright to deliver him to you.\" Mr. Glascock immediately let go his\nhold of the boy's frock and leaned back in the carriage. \"Louey will\ntell papa that he loves him before he goes?\" said Trevelyan. The poor\nlittle fellow murmured something, but it did not please his father,\nwho had him in his arms. \"You are like the rest of them, Louey,\" he\nsaid; \"because I cannot laugh and be gay, all my love for you is\nnothing;--nothing! You may take him. He is all that I have;--all that\nI have;--and I shall never see him again!\" So saying he handed the\nchild into the carriage, and sat himself down by the side of the road\nto watch till the vehicle should be out of sight. As soon as the last\nspeck of it had vanished from his sight, he picked himself up, and\ndragged his slow footsteps back to the house.\n\nMr. Glascock made sundry attempts to amuse the child, with whom he\nhad to remain all that night at Siena; but his efforts in that line\nwere not very successful. The boy was brisk enough, and happy, and\nsocial by nature; but the events, or rather the want of events of\nthe last few months, had so cowed him, that he could not recover his\nspirits at the bidding of a stranger. \"If I have any of my own,\" said\nMr. Glascock to himself, \"I hope they will be of a more cheerful\ndisposition.\"\n\nAs we have seen, he did not meet Caroline at the station,--thereby\nincurring his lady-love's displeasure for the period of\nhalf-a-minute; but he did meet Mrs. Trevelyan almost at the door of\nSir Marmaduke's lodgings. \"Yes, Mrs. Trevelyan; he is here.\"\n\n\"How am I ever to thank you for such goodness?\" said she. \"And Mr.\nTrevelyan;--you saw him?\"\n\n\"Yes:--I saw him.\"\n\nBefore he could answer her further she was up-stairs, and had her\nchild in her arms. It seemed to be an age since the boy had been\nstolen from her in the early spring in that unknown, dingy street\nnear Tottenham Court Road. Twice she had seen her darling since\nthat,--twice during his captivity; but on each of these occasions\nshe had seen him as one not belonging to herself, and had seen him\nunder circumstances which had robbed the greeting of almost all its\npleasure. But now he was her own again, to take whither she would,\nto dress and to undress, to feed, to coax, to teach, and to caress.\nAnd the child lay close up to her as she hugged him, putting up his\nlittle cheek to her chin, and burying himself happily in her embrace.\nHe had not much as yet to say, but she could feel that he was\ncontented.\n\nMr. Glascock had promised to wait for her a few minutes,--even at the\nrisk of Caroline's displeasure,--and Mrs. Trevelyan ran down to him\nas soon as the first craving of her mother's love was satisfied. Her\nboy would at any rate be safe with her now, and it was her duty to\nlearn something of her husband. It was more than her duty;--if only\nher services might be of avail to him. \"And you say he was well?\"\nshe asked. She had taken Mr. Glascock apart, and they were alone\ntogether, and he had determined that he would tell her the truth.\n\n\"I do not know that he is ill,--though he is pale and altered beyond\nbelief.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I saw that.\"\n\n\"I never knew a man so thin and haggard.\"\n\n\"My poor Louis!\"\n\n\"But that is not the worst of it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Glascock?\"\n\n\"I mean that his mind is astray, and that he should not be left\nalone. There is no knowing what he might do. He is so much more alone\nthere than he would be in England. There is not a soul who could\ninterfere.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you think--that he is in danger--from himself?\"\n\n\"I would not say so, Mrs. Trevelyan; but who can tell? I am sure of\nthis,--that he should not be left alone. If it were only because of\nthe misery of his life, he should not be left alone.\"\n\n\"But what can I do? He would not even see papa.\"\n\n\"He would see you.\"\n\n\"But he would not let me guide him in anything. I have been to him\ntwice, and he breaks out,--as if I were--a bad woman.\"\n\n\"Let him break out. What does it matter?\"\n\n\"Am I to own to a falsehood,--and such a falsehood?\"\n\n\"Own to anything, and you will conquer him at once. That is what I\nthink. You will excuse what I say, Mrs. Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Glascock, you have been such a friend! What should we have\ndone without you!\"\n\n\"You cannot take to heart the words that come from a disordered\nreason. In truth, he believes no ill of you.\"\n\n\"But he says so.\"\n\n\"It is hard to know what he says. Declare that you will submit to\nhim, and I think that he will be softened towards you. Try to bring\nhim back to his own country. It may be that were he to--die there,\nalone, the memory of his loneliness would be heavy with you in after\ndays.\" Then, having so spoken, he rushed off, declaring, with a\nforced laugh, that Caroline Spalding would never forgive him.\n\nThe next day was the day of the wedding, and Emily Trevelyan was\nleft all alone. It was of course out of the question that she should\njoin any party the purport of which was to be festive. Sir Marmaduke\nwent with some grumbling, declaring that wine and severe food in the\nmorning were sins against the plainest rules of life. And the three\nRowley girls went, Nora officiating as one of the bridesmaids. But\nMrs. Trevelyan was left with her boy, and during the day she was\nforced to resolve what should be the immediate course of her life.\nTwo days after the wedding her family would return to England. It was\nopen to her to go with them, and to take her boy with her. But a few\ndays since how happy she would have been could she have been made to\nbelieve that such a mode of returning would be within her power! But\nnow she felt that she might not return and leave that poor, suffering\nwretch behind her. As she thought of him she tried to interrogate\nherself in regard to her feelings. Was it love, or duty, or\ncompassion which stirred her? She had loved him as fondly as any\nbright young woman loves the man who is to take her away from\neverything else, and make her a part of his house and of himself.\nShe had loved him as Nora now loved the man whom she worshipped and\nthought to be a god, doing godlike work in the dingy recesses of the\nD. R. office. Emily Trevelyan was forced to tell herself that all\nthat was over with her. Her husband had shown himself to be weak,\nsuspicious, unmanly,--by no means like a god. She had learned to feel\nthat she could not trust her comfort in his hands,--that she could\nnever know what his thoughts of her might be. But still he was her\nhusband, and the father of her child; and though she could not dare\nto look forward to happiness in living with him, she could understand\nthat no comfort would be possible to her were she to return to\nEngland and to leave him to perish alone at Casalunga. Fate seemed\nto have intended that her life should be one of misery, and she must\nbear it as best she might.\n\nThe more she thought of it, however, the greater seemed to be her\ndifficulties. What was she to do when her father and mother should\nhave left her? She could not go to Casalunga if her husband would not\ngive her entrance; and if she did go, would it be safe for her to\ntake her boy with her? Were she to remain in Florence she would be\nhardly nearer to him for any useful purpose than in England; and even\nshould she pitch her tent at Siena, occupying there some desolate\nset of huge apartments in a deserted palace, of what use could she\nbe to him? Could she stay there if he desired her to go; and was it\nprobable that he would be willing that she should be at Siena while\nhe was living at Casalunga,--no more than two leagues distant? How\nshould she begin her work; and if he repulsed her, how should she\nthen continue it?\n\nBut during these wedding hours she did make up her mind as to what\nshe would do for the present. She would certainly not leave Italy\nwhile her husband remained there. She would for a while keep her\nrooms in Florence, and there should her boy abide. But from time\nto time,--twice a week perhaps,--she would go down to Siena and\nCasalunga, and there form her plans in accordance with her husband's\nconduct. She was his wife, and nothing should entirely separate her\nfrom him, now that he so sorely wanted her aid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\n\nMR. GLASCOCK'S MARRIAGE COMPLETED.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nThe Glascock marriage was a great affair in Florence;--so much\nso, that there were not a few who regarded it as a strengthening\nof peaceful relations between the United States and the United\nKingdom, and who thought that the Alabama claims and the question\nof naturalisation might now be settled with comparative ease. An\nEnglish lord was about to marry the niece of an American Minister\nto a foreign court. The bridegroom was not, indeed, quite a lord as\nyet, but it was known to all men that he must be a lord in a very\nshort time, and the bride was treated with more than usual bridal\nhonours because she belonged to a legation. She was not, indeed, an\nambassador's daughter, but the niece of a daughterless ambassador,\nand therefore almost as good as a daughter. The wives and daughters\nof other ambassadors, and the other ambassadors themselves, of\ncourse, came to the wedding; and as the palace in which Mr. Spalding\nhad apartments stood alone, in a garden, with a separate carriage\nentrance, it seemed for all wedding purposes as though the\nwhole palace were his own. The English Minister came, and his\nwife,--although she had never quite given over turning up her nose at\nthe American bride whom Mr. Glascock had chosen for himself. It was\nsuch a pity, she said, that such a man as Mr. Glascock should marry\na young woman from Providence, Rhode Island. Who in England would\nknow anything of Providence, Rhode Island? And it was so expedient,\nin her estimation, that a man of family should strengthen himself\nby marrying a woman of family. It was so necessary, she declared,\nthat a man when marrying should remember that his child would have\ntwo grandfathers, and would be called upon to account for four\ngreat-grandfathers. Nevertheless Mr. Glascock was--Mr. Glascock;\nand, let him marry whom he would, his wife would be the future Lady\nPeterborough. Remembering this, the English Minister's wife gave up\nthe point when the thing was really settled, and benignly promised to\ncome to the breakfast with all the secretaries and attach\u00c3\u00a9s belonging\nto the legation, and all the wives and daughters thereof. What may\na man not do, and do with \u00c3\u00a9clat, if he be heir to a peer and have\nplenty of money in his pocket?\n\nMr. and Mrs. Spalding were covered with glory on the occasion; and\nperhaps they did not bear their glory as meekly as they should have\ndone. Mrs. Spalding laid herself open to some ridicule from the\nBritish Minister's wife because of her inability to understand with\nabsolute clearness the condition of her niece's husband in respect to\nhis late and future seat in Parliament, to the fact of his being a\ncommoner and a nobleman at the same time, and to certain information\nwhich was conveyed to her, surely in a most unnecessary manner, that\nif Mr. Glascock were to die before his father her niece would never\nbecome Lady Peterborough, although her niece's son, if she had\none, would be the future lord. No doubt she blundered, as was most\nnatural; and then the British Minister's wife made the most of the\nblunders; and when once Mrs. Spalding ventured to speak of Caroline\nas her ladyship, not to the British Minister's wife, but to the\nsister of one of the secretaries, a story was made out of it which\nwas almost as false as it was ill-natured. Poor Caroline was spoken\nof as her ladyship backward and forwards among the ladies of the\nlegation in a manner which might have vexed her had she known\nanything about it; but, nevertheless, all the ladies prepared their\nbest flounces to go to the wedding. The time would soon come when she\nwould in truth be a \"ladyship,\" and she might be of social use to any\none of the ladies in question.\n\nBut Mr. Spalding was, for the time, the most disturbed of any of\nthe party concerned. He was a tall, thin, clever Republican of the\nNorth,--very fond of hearing himself talk, and somewhat apt to take\nadvantage of the courtesies of conversation for the purpose of making\nunpardonable speeches. As long as there was any give and take going\non in the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e of words he would speak quickly and with energy,\nseizing his chances among others; but the moment he had established\nhis right to the floor,--as soon as he had won for himself the\nposition of having his turn at the argument, he would dole out his\nwords with considerable slowness, raise his hand for oratorial\neffect, and proceed as though Time were annihilated. And he would go\nfurther even than this, for,--fearing by experience the escape of his\nvictims,--he would catch a man by the button-hole of his coat, or\nback him ruthlessly into the corner of a room, and then lay on to him\nwithout quarter. Since the affair with Mr. Glascock had been settled,\nhe had talked an immensity about England,--not absolutely taking\nhonour to himself because of his intended connection with a lord, but\nmaking so many references to the aristocratic side of the British\nconstitution as to leave no doubt on the minds of his hearers as\nto the source of his arguments. In old days, before all this was\nhappening, Mr. Spalding, though a courteous man in his personal\nrelations, had constantly spoken of England with the bitter\nindignation of the ordinary American politician. England must be made\nto disgorge. England must be made to do justice. England must be\ntaught her place in the world. England must give up her claims. In\nhot moments he had gone further, and had declared that England must\nbe--whipped. He had been specially loud against that aristocracy of\nEngland which, according to a figure of speech often used by him,\nwas always feeding on the vitals of the people. But now all this was\nvery much changed. He did not go the length of expressing an opinion\nthat the House of Lords was a valuable institution; but he discussed\nquestions of primogeniture and hereditary legislation, in reference\nto their fitness for countries which were gradually emerging\nfrom feudal systems, with an equanimity, an impartiality, and a\nperseverance which soon convinced those who listened to him where he\nhad learned his present lessons, and why. \"The conservative nature of\nyour institutions, sir,\" he said to poor Sir Marmaduke at the Baths\nof Lucca a very few days before the marriage, \"has to be studied\nwith great care before its effects can be appreciated in reference\nto a people who, perhaps, I may be allowed to say, have more in\ntheir composition of constitutional reverence than of educated\nintelligence.\" Sir Marmaduke, having suffered before, had endeavoured\nto bolt; but the American had caught him and pinned him, and the\nGovernor of the Mandarins was impotent in his hands. \"The position\nof the great peer of Parliament is doubtless very splendid, and\nmay be very useful,\" continued Mr. Spalding, who was intending to\nbring round his argument to the evil doings of certain scandalously\nextravagant young lords, and to offer a suggestion that in such\ncases a committee of aged and respected peers should sit and decide\nwhether a second son, or some other heir should not be called to the\ninheritance both of the title and the property. But Mrs. Spalding\nhad seen the sufferings of Sir Marmaduke, and had rescued him. \"Mr.\nSpalding,\" she had said, \"it is too late for politics, and Sir\nMarmaduke has come out here for a holiday.\" Then she took her husband\nby the arm, and led him away helpless.\n\nIn spite of these drawbacks to the success,--if ought can be\nsaid to be a drawback on success of which the successful one is\nunconscious,--the marriage was prepared with great splendour, and\neverybody who was anybody in Florence was to be present. There\nwere only to be four bridesmaids, Caroline herself having strongly\nobjected to a greater number. As Wallachia Petrie had fled at\nthe first note of preparation for these trivial and unpalatable\nfestivities, another American young lady was found; and the sister of\nthe English secretary of legation, who had so maliciously spread that\nreport about her \"ladyship,\" gladly agreed to be the fourth.\n\nAs the reader will remember, the whole party from the Baths of Lucca\nreached Florence only the day before the marriage, and Nora at\nthe station promised to go up to Caroline that same evening. \"Mr.\nGlascock will tell me about the little boy,\" said Caroline; \"but I\nshall be so anxious to hear about your sister.\" So Nora crossed the\nbridge after dinner, and went up to the American Minister's palatial\nresidence. Caroline was then in the loggia, and Mr. Glascock was\nwith her; and for a while they talked about Emily Trevelyan and her\nmisfortunes. Mr. Glascock was clearly of opinion that Trevelyan would\nsoon be either in an asylum or in his grave. \"I could not bring\nmyself to tell your sister so,\" he said; \"but I think your father\nshould be told,--or your mother. Something should be done to put an\nend to that fearful residence at Casalunga.\" Then by degrees the\nconversation changed itself to Nora's prospects; and Caroline, with\nher friend's hand in hers, asked after Hugh Stanbury.\n\n\"You will not mind speaking before him,--will you?\" said Caroline,\nputting her hand on her own lover's arm.\n\n\"Not unless he should mind it,\" said Nora, smiling. She had meant\nnothing beyond a simple reply to her friend's question, but he took\nher words in a different sense, and blushed as he remembered his\nvisit to Nuncombe Putney.\n\n\"He thinks almost more of your happiness than he does of mine,\" said\nCaroline; \"which isn't fair, as I am sure that Mr. Stanbury will not\nreciprocate the attention. And now, dear, when are we to see you?\"\n\n\"Who on earth can say?\"\n\n\"I suppose Mr. Stanbury would say something,--only he is not here.\"\n\n\"And papa won't send my letter,\" said Nora.\n\n\"You are sure that you will not go out to the Islands with him?\"\n\n\"Quite sure,\" said Nora. \"I have made up my mind so far as that.\"\n\n\"And what will your sister do?\"\n\n\"I think she will stay. I think she will say good-bye to papa and\nmamma here in Florence.\"\n\n\"I am quite of opinion that she should not leave her husband alone in\nItaly,\" said Mr. Glascock.\n\n\"She has not told us with certainty,\" said Nora; \"but I feel sure\nthat she will stay. Papa thinks she ought to go with them to London.\"\n\n\"Your papa seems to have two very intractable daughters,\" said\nCaroline.\n\n\"As for me,\" declared Nora, solemnly, \"nothing shall make me go back\nto the Islands,--unless Mr. Stanbury should tell me to do so.\"\n\n\"And they start at the end of July?\"\n\n\"On the last Saturday.\"\n\n\"And what will you do then, Nora?\"\n\n\"I believe there are casual wards that people go to.\"\n\n\"Casual wards!\" said Caroline.\n\n\"Miss Rowley is condescending to poke her fun at you,\" said Mr.\nGlascock.\n\n\"She is quite welcome, and shall poke as much as she likes; only we\nmust be serious now. If it be necessary, we will get back by the end\nof July;--won't we, Charles?\"\n\n\"You will do nothing of the kind,\" said Nora. \"What!--give up your\nhoneymoon to provide me with board and lodgings! How can you suppose\nthat I am so selfish or so helpless? I would go to my aunt, Mrs.\nOuthouse.\"\n\n\"We know that that wouldn't do,\" said Caroline. \"You might as well be\nin Italy as far as Mr. Stanbury is concerned.\"\n\n\"If Miss Rowley would go to Monkhams, she might wait for us,\"\nsuggested Mr. Glascock. \"Old Mrs. Richards is there; and though of\ncourse she would be dull--\"\n\n\"It is quite unnecessary,\" said Nora. \"I shall take a two-pair back\nin a respectable feminine quarter, like any other young woman who\nwants such accommodation, and shall wait there till my young man can\ncome and give me his arm to church. That is about the way we shall do\nit. I am not going to give myself any airs, Mr. Glascock, or make any\ndifficulties. Papa is always talking to me about chairs and tables\nand frying-pans, and I shall practise to do with as few of them as\npossible. As I am headstrong about having my young man,--and I own\nthat I am headstrong about that,--I guess I've got to fit myself for\nthat sort of life.\" And Nora, as she said this, pronounced her words\nwith something of a nasal twang, imitating certain countrywomen of\nher friend's.\n\n\"I like to hear you joking about it, Nora; because your voice is so\ncheery and you are so bright when you joke. But, nevertheless, one\nhas to be reasonable, and to look the facts in the face. I don't see\nhow you are to be left in London alone, and you know that your aunt\nMrs. Outhouse,--or at any rate your uncle,--would not receive you\nexcept on receiving some strong anti-Stanbury pledge.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not give an anti-Stanbury pledge.\"\n\n\"And, therefore, that is out of the question. You will have a\nfortnight or three weeks in London, in all the bustle of their\ndeparture, and I declare I think that at the last moment you will go\nwith them.\"\n\n\"Never!--unless he says so.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you are even to meet--'him,' and talk it over.\"\n\n\"I'll manage that. My promise not to write lasts only while we are in\nItaly.\"\n\n\"I think we had better get back to England, Charles, and take pity on\nthis poor destitute one.\"\n\n\"If you talk of such a thing I will swear that I will never go to\nMonkhams. You will find that I shall manage it. It may be that I\nshall do something very shocking,--so that all your patronage will\nhardly be able to bring me round afterwards; but I will do something\nthat will serve my purpose. I have not gone so far as this to be\nturned back now.\" Nora, as she spoke of having \"gone so far,\" was\nlooking at Mr. Glascock, who was seated in an easy arm-chair close\nto the girl whom he was to make his wife on the morrow, and she\nwas thinking, no doubt, of the visit which he had made to Nuncombe\nPutney, and of the first irretrievable step which she had taken when\nshe told him that her love was given to another. That had been her\nRubicon. And though there had been periods with her since the passing\nof it, in which she had felt that she had crossed it in vain, that\nshe had thrown away the splendid security of the other bank without\nobtaining the perilous object of her ambition,--though there had been\nmoments in which she had almost regretted her own courage and noble\naction, still, having passed the river, there was nothing for her\nbut to go on to Rome. She was not going to be stopped now by the\nwant of a house in which to hide herself for a few weeks. She was\nwithout money, except so much as her mother might be able, almost\nsurreptitiously, to give her. She was without friends to help\nher,--except these who were now with her, whose friendship had come\nto her in so singular a manner, and whose power to aid her at the\npresent moment was cruelly curtailed by their own circumstances.\nNothing was settled as to her own marriage. In consequence of\nthe promise that had been extorted from her that she should not\ncorrespond with Stanbury, she knew nothing of his present wishes or\nintention. Her father was so offended by her firmness that he would\nhardly speak to her. And it was evident to her that her mother,\nthough disposed to yield, was still in hopes that her daughter, in\nthe press and difficulty of the moment, would allow herself to be\ncarried away with the rest of the family to the other side of the\nworld. She knew all this,--but she had made up her mind that she\nwould not be carried away. It was not very pleasant, the thought that\nshe would be obliged at last to ask her young man, as she called\nhim, to provide for her; but she would do that and trust herself\naltogether in his hands sooner than be taken to the Antipodes. \"I\ncan be very resolute if I please, my dear,\" she said, looking at\nCaroline. Mr. Glascock almost thought that she must have intended to\naddress him.\n\nThey sat there discussing the matter for some time through the long,\ncool, evening hours, but nothing could be settled further,--except\nthat Nora would write to her friend as soon as her affairs had begun\nto shape themselves after her return to England. At last Caroline\nwent into the house, and for a few minutes Mr. Glascock was alone\nwith Nora. He had remained, determining that the moment should come,\nbut now that it was there he was for awhile unable to say the words\nthat he wished to utter. At last he spoke. \"Miss Rowley, Caroline is\nso eager to be your friend.\"\n\n\"I know she is, and I do love her so dearly. But, without joke, Mr.\nGlascock, there will be as it were a great gulf between us.\"\n\n\"I do not know that there need be any gulf, great or little. But\nI did not mean to allude to that. What I want to say is this. My\nfeelings are not a bit less warm or sincere than hers. You know of\nold that I am not very good at expressing myself.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"There is no such gulf as what you speak of. All that is mostly\ngone by, and a nobleman in England, though he has advantages as a\ngentleman, is no more than a gentleman. But that has nothing to\ndo with what I am saying now. I shall never forget my journey to\nDevonshire. I won't pretend to say now that I regret its result.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure you don't.\"\n\n\"No; I do not;--though I thought then that I should regret it always.\nBut remember this, Miss Rowley,--that you can never ask me to do\nanything that I will not, if possible, do for you. You are in some\nlittle difficulty now.\"\n\n\"It will disappear, Mr. Glascock. Difficulties always do.\"\n\n\"But we will do anything that we are wanted to do; and should a\ncertain event take place--\"\n\n\"It will take place some day.\"\n\n\"Then I hope that we may be able to make Mr. Stanbury and his wife\nquite at home at Monkhams.\" After that he took Nora's hand and kissed\nit, and at that moment Caroline came back to them.\n\n\"To-morrow, Mr. Glascock,\" she said, \"you will, I believe, be at\nliberty to kiss everybody; but to-day you should be more discreet.\"\n\nIt was generally admitted among the various legations in Florence\nthat there had not been such a wedding in the City of Flowers since\nit had become the capital of Italia. Mr. Glascock and Miss Spalding\nwere married in the chapel of the legation,--a legation chapel on the\nground floor having been extemporised for the occasion. This greatly\nenhanced the pleasantness of the thing, and saved the necessity of\nmatrons and bridesmaids packing themselves and their finery into\nclose fusty carriages. A portion of the guests attended in the\nchapel, and the remainder, when the ceremony was over, were found\nstrolling about the shady garden. The whole affair of the breakfast\nwas very splendid and lasted some hours. In the midst of this the\nbride and bridegroom were whisked away with a pair of grey horses to\nthe railway station, and before the last toast of the day had been\nproposed by the Belgian Councillor of Legation, they were half way up\nthe Apennines on their road to Bologna. Mr. Spalding behaved himself\nlike a man on the occasion. Nothing was spared in the way of expense,\nand when he made that celebrated speech, in which he declared that\nthe republican virtue of the New World had linked itself in a happy\nalliance with the aristocratic splendour of the Old, and went on with\na simile about the lion and the lamb, everybody accepted it with good\nhumour in spite of its being a little too long for the occasion.\n\n\"It has gone off very well, mamma; has it not?\" said Nora, as she\nreturned home with her mother to her lodgings.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; much, I fancy, as these things generally do.\"\n\n\"I thought it was so nice. And she looked so very well. And he was so\npleasant, and so much like a gentleman;--not noisy, you know,--and\nyet not too serious.\"\n\n\"I dare say, my love.\"\n\n\"It is easy enough, mamma, for a girl to be married, for she has\nnothing to do but to wear her clothes and look as pretty as she can.\nAnd if she cries and has a red nose it is forgiven her. But a man has\nso difficult a part to play. If he tries to carry himself as though\nit were not a special occasion, he looks like a fool that way; and if\nhe is very special, he looks like a fool the other way. I thought Mr.\nGlascock did it very well.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, my dear, I did not observe him.\"\n\n\"I did,--narrowly. He hadn't tied his cravat at all nicely.\"\n\n\"How you could think of his cravat, Nora, with such memories as you\nmust have, and such regrets, I cannot understand.\"\n\n\"Mamma, my memories of Mr. Glascock are pleasant memories, and as for\nregrets,--I have not one. Can I regret, mamma, that I did not marry a\nman whom I did not love,--and that I rejected him when I knew that I\nloved another? You cannot mean that, mamma.\"\n\n\"I know this;--that I was thinking all the time how proud I should\nhave been, and how much more fortunate he would have been, had you\nbeen standing there instead of that American young woman.\" As she\nsaid this Lady Rowley burst into tears, and Nora could only answer\nher mother by embracing her. They were alone together, their party\nhaving been too large for one carriage, and Sir Marmaduke having\ntaken his two younger daughters. \"Of course I feel it,\" said Lady\nRowley, through her tears. \"It would have been such a position for\nmy child! And that young man,--without a shilling in the world; and\nwriting in that way, just for bare bread!\" Nora had nothing more\nto say. A feeling that in herself would have been base, was simply\naffectionate and maternal in her mother. It was impossible that she\nshould make her mother see it as she saw it.\n\nThere was but one intervening day and then the Rowleys returned to\nEngland. There had been, as it were, a tacit agreement among them\nthat, in spite of all their troubles, their holiday should be a\nholiday up to the time of the Glascock marriage. Then must commence\nat once the stern necessity of their return home,--home, not only\nto England, but to those antipodean islands from which it was\ntoo probable that some of them might never come back. And the\ndifficulties in their way seemed to be almost insuperable. First\nof all there was to be the parting from Emily Trevelyan. She had\ndetermined to remain in Florence, and had written to her husband\nsaying that she would do so, and declaring her willingness to go out\nto him, or to receive him in Florence at any time and in any manner\nthat he might appoint. She had taken this as a first step, intending\nto go to Casalunga very shortly, even though she should receive\nno answer from him. The parting between her and her mother and\nfather and sisters was very bitter. Sir Marmaduke, as he had become\nestranged from Nora, had grown to be more and more gentle and loving\nwith his elder daughter, and was nearly overcome at the idea of\nleaving her in a strange land, with a husband near her, mad, and yet\nnot within her custody. But he could do nothing,--could hardly say a\nword,--toward opposing her. Though her husband was mad, he supplied\nher with the means of living; and when she said that it was her duty\nto be near him, her father could not deny it. The parting came. \"I\nwill return to you the moment you send to me,\" were Nora's last words\nto her sister. \"I don't suppose I shall send,\" said Emily. \"I shall\ntry to bear it without assistance.\"\n\nThen the journey from Italy to England was made without much\ngratification or excitement, and the Rowley family again found\nthemselves at Gregg's Hotel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\n\nCROPPER AND BURGESS.\n\n\nWe must now go back to Exeter and look after Mr. Brooke Burgess and\nMiss Dorothy Stanbury. It is rather hard upon readers that they\nshould be thus hurried from the completion of hymeneals at Florence,\nto the preparations for other hymeneals in Devonshire; but it is the\nnature of a complex story to be entangled with many weddings towards\nits close. In this little history there are, we fear, three or four\nmore to come. We will not anticipate by alluding prematurely to Hugh\nStanbury's treachery, or death,--or the possibility that he after all\nmay turn out to be the real descendant of the true Lord Peterborough\nand the actual inheritor of the title and estate of Monkhams, nor\nwill we speak of Nora's certain fortitude under either of these\nemergencies. But the instructed reader must be aware that Camilla\nFrench ought to have a husband found for her; that Colonel Osborne\nshould be caught in some matrimonial trap,--as, how otherwise\nshould he be fitly punished?--and that something should be at least\nattempted for Priscilla Stanbury, who from the first has been\nintended to be the real heroine of these pages. That Martha should\nmarry Giles Hickbody, and Barty Burgess run away with Mrs. MacHugh,\nis of course evident to the meanest novel-expounding capacity; but\nthe fate of Brooke Burgess and of Dorothy will require to be evolved\nwith some delicacy and much detail.\n\nThere was considerable difficulty in fixing the day. In the first\nplace Miss Stanbury was not very well,--and then she was very\nfidgety. She must see Brooke again before the day was fixed, and\nafter seeing Brooke she must see her lawyer. \"To have a lot of money\nto look after is more plague than profit, my dear,\" she said to\nDorothy one day; \"particularly when you don't quite know what you\nought to do with it.\" Dorothy had always avoided any conversation\nwith her aunt about money since the first moment in which she had\nthought of accepting Brooke Burgess as her husband. She knew that\nher aunt had some feeling which made her averse to the idea that any\nportion of the property which she had inherited should be enjoyed by\na Stanbury after her death, and Dorothy, guided by this knowledge,\nhad almost convinced herself that her love for Brooke was treason\neither against him or against her aunt. If, by engaging herself to\nhim, she should rob him of his inheritance, how bitter a burden to\nhim would her love have been! If, on the other hand, she should\nreward her aunt for all that had been done for her by forcing\nherself, a Stanbury, into a position not intended for her, how base\nwould be her ingratitude! These thoughts had troubled her much, and\nhad always prevented her from answering any of her aunt's chance\nallusions to the property. For her, things had at last gone very\nright. She did not quite know how it had come about, but she was\nengaged to marry the man she loved. And her aunt was, at any rate,\nreconciled to the marriage. But when Miss Stanbury declared that she\ndid not know what to do about the property, Dorothy could only hold\nher tongue. She had had plenty to say when it had been suggested to\nher that the marriage should be put off yet for a short while, and\nthat, in the meantime, Brooke should come again to Exeter. She swore\nthat she did not care for how long it was put off,--only that she\nhoped it might not be put off altogether. And as for Brooke's coming,\nthat, for the present, would be very much nicer than being married\nout of hand at once. Dorothy, in truth, was not at all in a hurry to\nbe married, but she would have liked to have had her lover always\ncoming and going. Since the courtship had become a thing permitted,\nshe had had the privilege of welcoming him twice at the house in the\nClose; and that running down to meet him in the little front parlour,\nand the getting up to make his breakfast for him as he started in\nthe morning, were among the happiest epochs of her life. And then,\nas soon as ever the breakfast was eaten, and he was gone, she would\nsit down to write him a letter. Oh, those letters, so beautifully\ncrossed, more than one of which was copied from beginning to end\nbecause some word in it was not thought to be sweet enough;--what a\nheaven of happiness they were to her! The writing of the first had\ndisturbed her greatly, and she had almost repented of the privilege\nbefore it was ended; but with the first and second the difficulties\nhad disappeared; and, had she not felt somewhat ashamed of the\noccupation, she could have sat at her desk and written him letters\nall day. Brooke would answer them, with fair regularity, but in a\nmost cursory manner,--sending seven or eight lines in return for two\nsheets fully crossed; but this did not discompose her in the least.\nHe was worked hard at his office, and had hundreds of other things\nto do. He, too, could say,--so thought Dorothy,--more in eight lines\nthan she could put into as many pages.\n\nShe was quite happy when she was told that the marriage could not\ntake place till August, but that Brooke must come again in July.\nBrooke did come in the first week of July, and somewhat horrified\nDorothy by declaring to her that Miss Stanbury was unreasonable.\n\n\"If I insist upon leaving London so often for a day or two,\" said he,\n\"how am I to get anything like leave of absence when the time comes?\"\nIn answer to this Dorothy tried to make him understand that business\nshould not be neglected, and that, as far as she was concerned, she\ncould do very well without that trip abroad which he had proposed for\nher. \"I'm not going to be done in that way,\" said Brooke. \"And now\nthat I am here she has nothing to say to me. I've told her a dozen\ntimes that I don't want to know anything about her will, and that\nI'll take it all for granted. There is something to be settled on\nyou, that she calls her own.\"\n\n\"She is so generous, Brooke.\"\n\n\"She is generous enough, but she is very whimsical. She is going\nto make her whole will over again, and now she wants to send some\nmessage to Uncle Barty. I don't know what it is yet, but I am to take\nit. As far as I can understand, she has sent all the way to London\nfor me, in order that I may take a message across the Close.\"\n\n\"You talk as though it were very disagreeable, coming to Exeter,\"\nsaid Dorothy, with a little pout.\n\n\"So it is,--very disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Oh, Brooke!\"\n\n\"Very disagreeable if our marriage is to be put off by it. I think\nit will be so much nicer making love somewhere on the Rhine than\nhaving snatches of it here, and talking all the time about wills and\ntenements and settlements.\" As he said this, with his arm round her\nwaist and his face quite close to hers,--shewing thereby that he was\nnot altogether averse even to his present privileges,--she forgave\nhim.\n\nOn that same afternoon, just before the banking hours were over,\nBrooke went across to the house of Cropper and Burgess, having first\nbeen closeted for nearly an hour with his aunt,--and, as he went,\nhis step was sedate and his air was serious. He found his uncle\nBarty, and was not very long in delivering his message. It was to\nthis effect,--that Miss Stanbury particularly wished to see Mr.\nBartholomew Burgess on business, at some hour on that afternoon\nor that evening. Brooke himself had been made acquainted with the\nsubject in regard to which this singular interview was desired;\nbut it was not a part of his duty to communicate any information\nrespecting it. It had been necessary that his consent to certain\narrangements should be asked before the invitation to Barty Burgess\ncould be given; but his present mission was confined to an authority\nto give the invitation.\n\nOld Mr. Burgess was much surprised, and was at first disposed to\ndecline the proposition made by the \"old harridan,\" as he called her.\nHe had never put any restraint on his language in talking of Miss\nStanbury with his nephew, and was not disposed to do so now, because\nshe had taken a new vagary into her head. But there was something in\nhis nephew's manner which at last induced him to discuss the matter\nrationally.\n\n\"And you don't know what it's all about?\" said Uncle Barty.\n\n\"I can't quite say that. I suppose I do know pretty well. At any\nrate, I know enough to think that you ought to come. But I must not\nsay what it is.\"\n\n\"Will it do me or anybody else any good?\"\n\n\"It can't do you any harm. She won't eat you.\"\n\n\"But she can abuse me like a pickpocket, and I should return it, and\nthen there would be a scolding match. I always have kept out of her\nway, and I think I had better do so still.\"\n\nNevertheless Brooke prevailed,--or rather the feeling of curiosity\nwhich was naturally engendered prevailed. For very, very many years\nBarty Burgess had never entered or left his own house of business\nwithout seeing the door of that in which Miss Stanbury lived,--and\nhe had never seen that door without a feeling of detestation for the\nowner of it. It would, perhaps, have been a more rational feeling on\nhis part had he confined his hatred to the memory of his brother, by\nwhose will Miss Stanbury had been enriched, and he had been, as he\nthought, impoverished. But there had been a contest, and litigation,\nand disputes, and contradictions, and a long course of those\nincidents in life which lead to rancour and ill blood, after the\ndeath of the former Brooke Burgess; and, as the result of all this,\nMiss Stanbury held the property and Barty Burgess held his hatred.\nHe had never been ashamed of it, and had spoken his mind out to all\nwho would hear him. And, to give Miss Stanbury her due, it must be\nadmitted that she had hardly been behind him in the warmth of her\nexpression,--of which old Barty was well aware. He hated, and knew\nthat he was hated in return. And he knew, or thought that he knew,\nthat his enemy was not a woman to relent because old age and weakness\nand the fear of death were coming on her. His enemy, with all her\nfaults, was no coward. It could not be that now at the eleventh hour\nshe should desire to reconcile him by any act of tardy justice,--nor\ndid he wish to be reconciled at this the eleventh hour. His hatred\nwas a pleasant excitement to him. His abuse of Miss Stanbury was a\nchosen recreation. His unuttered daily curse, as he looked over to\nher door, was a relief to him. Nevertheless he would go. As Brooke\nhad said,--no harm could come of his going. He would go, and at least\nlisten to her proposition.\n\nAbout seven in the evening his knock was heard at the door. Miss\nStanbury was sitting in the small up-stairs parlour, dressed in her\nsecond best gown, and was prepared with considerable stiffness and\nstate for the occasion. Dorothy was with her, but was desired in a\nquick voice to hurry away the moment the knock was heard, as though\nold Barty would have jumped from the hall door into the room at\na bound. Dorothy collected herself with a little start, and went\nwithout a word. She had heard much of Barty Burgess, but had never\nspoken to him, and was subject to a feeling of great awe when she\nwould remember that the grim old man of whom she had heard so much\nevil would soon be her uncle. According to arrangement, Mr. Burgess\nwas shewn up-stairs by his nephew. Barty Burgess had been born in\nthis very house, but had not been inside the walls of it for more\nthan thirty years. He also was somewhat awed by the occasion, and\nfollowed his nephew without a word. Brooke was to remain at hand,\nso that he might be summoned should he be wanted; but it had been\ndecided by Miss Stanbury that he should not be present at the\ninterview. As soon as her visitor entered the room she rose in a\nstately way, and curtseyed, propping herself with one hand upon the\ntable as she did so. She looked him full in the face meanwhile, and\ncurtseying a second time asked him to seat himself in a chair which\nhad been prepared for him. She did it all very well, and it may be\nsurmised that she had rehearsed the little scene, perhaps more than\nonce, when nobody was looking at her. He bowed, and walked round to\nthe chair and seated himself; but finding that he was so placed that\nhe could not see his neighbour's face, he moved his chair. He was not\ngoing to fight such a duel as this with the disadvantage of the sun\nin his eyes.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Barty Burgess.]\n\n\nHitherto there had hardly been a word spoken. Miss Stanbury had\nmuttered something as she was curtseying, and Barty Burgess had made\nsome return. Then she began: \"Mr. Burgess,\" she said, \"I am indebted\nto you for your complaisance in coming here at my request.\" To this\nhe bowed again. \"I should not have ventured thus to trouble you were\nit not that years are dealing more hardly with me than they are\nwith you, and that I could not have ventured to discuss a matter\nof deep interest otherwise than in my own room.\" It was her room\nnow, certainly, by law; but Barty Burgess remembered it when it was\nhis mother's room, and when she used to give them all their meals\nthere,--now so many, many years ago! He bowed again, and said not a\nword. He knew well that she could sooner be brought to her point by\nhis silence than by his speech.\n\nShe was a long time coming to her point. Before she could do so she\nwas forced to allude to times long past, and to subjects which she\nfound it very difficult to touch without saying that which would\neither belie herself, or seem to be severe upon him. Though she had\nprepared herself, she could hardly get the words spoken, and she was\ngreatly impeded by the obstinacy of his silence. But at last her\nproposition was made to him. She told him that his nephew, Brooke,\nwas about to be married to her niece, Dorothy; and that it was her\nintention to make Brooke her heir in the bulk of the property which\nshe had received under the will of the late Mr. Brooke Burgess.\n\"Indeed,\" she said, \"all that I received at your brother's hands\nshall go back to your brother's family unimpaired.\" He only bowed,\nand would not say a word. Then she went on to say that it had at\nfirst been a matter to her of deep regret that Brooke should have set\nhis affections upon her niece, as there had been in her mind a strong\ndesire that none of her own people should enjoy the reversion of the\nwealth, which she had always regarded as being hers only for the\nterm of her life; but that she had found that the young people had\nbeen so much in earnest, and that her own feeling had been so near\nakin to a prejudice, that she had yielded. When this was said Barty\nsmiled instead of bowing, and Miss Stanbury felt that there might be\nsomething worse even than his silence. His smile told her that he\nbelieved her to be lying. Nevertheless she went on. She was not fool\nenough to suppose that the whole nature of the man was to be changed\nby a few words from her. So she went on. The marriage was a thing\nfixed, and she was thinking of settlements, and had been talking to\nlawyers about a new will.\n\n\"I do not know that I can help you,\" said Barty, finding that a\nlonger pause than usual made some word from him absolutely necessary.\n\n\"I am going on to that, and I regret that my story should detain\nyou so long, Mr. Burgess.\" And she did go on. She had, she said,\nmade some saving out of her income. She was not going to trouble Mr.\nBurgess with this matter,--only that she might explain to him that\nwhat she would at once give to the young couple, and what she would\nsettle on Dorothy after her own death, would all come from such\nsavings, and that such gifts and bequests would not diminish the\nfamily property. Barty again smiled as he heard this, and Miss\nStanbury in her heart likened him to the devil in person. But still\nshe went on. She was very desirous that Brooke Burgess should\ncome and live at Exeter. His property would be in the town and\nthe neighbourhood. It would be a seemly thing,--such were her\nwords,--that he should occupy the house that had belonged to his\ngrandfather and his great-grandfather; and then, moreover,--she\nacknowledged that she spoke selfishly,--she dreaded the idea of being\nleft alone for the remainder of her own years. Her proposition at\nlast was uttered. It was simply this, that Barty Burgess should give\nto his nephew, Brooke, his share in the bank.\n\n\"I am damned, if I do!\" said Barty Burgess, rising up from his chair.\n\nBut before he had left the room he had agreed to consider the\nproposition. Miss Stanbury had of course known that any such\nsuggestion coming from her without an adequate reason assigned, would\nhave been mere idle wind. She was prepared with such adequate reason.\nIf Mr. Burgess could see his way to make the proposed transfer of his\nshare of the bank business, she, Miss Stanbury, would hand over to\nhim, for his life, a certain proportion of the Burgess property which\nlay in the city, the income of which would exceed that drawn by him\nfrom the business. Would he, at his time of life, take that for doing\nnothing which he now got for working hard? That was the meaning of\nit. And then, too, as far as the portion of the property went,--and\nit extended to the houses owned by Miss Stanbury on the bank side\nof the Close,--it would belong altogether to Barty Burgess for his\nlife. \"It will simply be this, Mr. Burgess;--that Brooke will be your\nheir,--as would be natural.\"\n\n\"I don't know that it would be at all natural,\" said he. \"I should\nprefer to choose my own heir.\"\n\n\"No doubt, Mr. Burgess,--in respect to your own property,\" said Miss\nStanbury.\n\nAt last he said that he would think of it, and consult his partner;\nand then he got up to take his leave. \"For myself,\" said Miss\nStanbury, \"I would wish that all animosities might be buried.\"\n\n\"We can say that they are buried,\" said the grim old man,--\"but\nnobody will believe us.\"\n\n\"What matters,--if we could believe it ourselves?\"\n\n\"But suppose we didn't. I don't believe that much good can come from\ntalking of such things, Miss Stanbury. You and I have grown too old\nto swear a friendship. I will think of this thing, and if I find\nthat it can be made to suit without much difficulty, I will perhaps\nentertain it.\" Then the interview was over, and old Barty made\nhis way down-stairs, and out of the house. He looked over to the\ntenements in the Close which were offered to him, every circumstance\nof each one of which he knew, and felt that he might do worse. Were\nhe to leave the bank, he could not take his entire income with him,\nand it had been long said of him that he ought to leave it. The\nCroppers, who were his partners,--and whom he had never loved,--would\nbe glad to welcome in his place one of the old family who would have\nmoney; and then the name would be perpetuated in Exeter, which, even\nto Barty Burgess, was something.\n\nOn that night the scheme was divulged to Dorothy, and she was in\necstasies. London had always sounded bleak and distant and terrible\nto her; and her heart had misgiven her at the idea of leaving her\naunt. If only this thing might be arranged! When Brooke spoke the\nnext morning of returning at once to his office, he was rebuked by\nboth the ladies. What was the Ecclesiastical Commission Office to any\nof them, when matters of such importance were concerned? But Brooke\nwould not be talked out of his prudence. He was very willing to be\nmade a banker at Exeter, and to go to school again and learn banking\nbusiness; but he would not throw up his occupation in London till he\nknew that there was another ready for him in the country. One day\nlonger he spent in Exeter, and during that day he was more than once\nwith his uncle. He saw also the Messrs. Cropper, and was considerably\nchilled by the manner in which they at first seemed to entertain the\nproposition. Indeed, for a couple of hours he thought that the scheme\nmust be abandoned. It was pointed out to him that Mr. Barty Burgess's\nlife would probably be short, and that he--Barty--had but a small\npart of the business at his disposal. But gradually a way to terms\nwas seen,--not quite so simple as that which Miss Stanbury had\nsuggested; and Brooke, when he left Exeter, did believe it possible\nthat he, after all, might become the family representative in the old\nbanking-house of the Burgesses.\n\n\"And how long will it take, Aunt Stanbury?\" Dorothy asked.\n\n\"Don't you be impatient, my dear.\"\n\n\"I am not the least impatient; but of course I want to tell mamma and\nPriscilla. It will be so nice to live here and not go up to London.\nAre we to stay here,--in this very house?\"\n\n\"Have you not found out yet that Brooke will be likely to have an\nopinion of his own on such things?\"\n\n\"But would you wish us to live here, aunt?\"\n\n\"I hardly know, dear. I am a foolish old woman, and cannot say what I\nwould wish. I cannot bear to be alone.\"\n\n\"Of course we will stay with you.\"\n\n\"And yet I should be jealous if I were not mistress of my own house.\"\n\n\"Of course you will be mistress.\"\n\n\"I believe, Dolly, that it would be better that I should die. I have\ncome to feel that I can do more good by going out of the world than\nby remaining in it.\" Dorothy hardly answered this in words, but sat\nclose by her aunt, holding the old woman's hand and caressing it, and\nadministering that love of which Miss Stanbury had enjoyed so little\nduring her life and which had become so necessary to her.\n\nThe news about the bank arrangements, though kept of course as a\ngreat secret, soon became common in Exeter. It was known to be a good\nthing for the firm in general that Barty Burgess should be removed\nfrom his share of the management. He was old-fashioned, unpopular,\nand very stubborn; and he and a certain Mr. Julius Cropper, who was\nthe leading man among the Croppers, had not always been comfortable\ntogether. It was at first hinted that old Miss Stanbury had been\nsoftened by sudden twinges of conscience, and that she had confessed\nto some terrible crime in the way of forgery, perjury, or perhaps\nworse, and had relieved herself at last by making full restitution.\nBut such a rumour as this did not last long or receive wide credence.\nWhen it was hinted to such old friends as Sir Peter Mancrudy and Mrs.\nMacHugh, they laughed it to scorn,--and it did not exist even in the\nvague form of an undivulged mystery for above three days. Then it\nwas asserted that old Barty had been found to have no real claim\nto any share in the bank, and that he was to be turned out at Miss\nStanbury's instance;--that he was to be turned out, and that Brooke\nhad been acknowledged to be the owner of the Burgess share of her\nbusiness. Then came the fact that old Barty had been bought out, and\nthat the future husband of Miss Stanbury's niece was to be the junior\npartner. A general feeling prevailed at last that there had been\nanother great battle between Miss Stanbury and old Barty, and that\nthe old maid had prevailed now as she had done in former days.\n\nBefore the end of July the papers were in the lawyer's hands, and\nall the terms had been fixed. Brooke came down again and again, to\nDorothy's great delight, and displayed considerable firmness in the\nmanagement of his own interest. If Fate intended to make him a banker\nin Exeter instead of a clerk in the Ecclesiastical Commission Office,\nhe would be a banker after a respectable fashion. There was more\nthan one little struggle between him and Mr. Julius Cropper, which\nended in accession of respect on the part of Mr. Cropper for his new\npartner. Mr. Cropper had thought that the establishment might best\nbe known to the commercial world of the West of England as \"Croppers'\nBank;\" but Brooke had been very firm in asserting that if he was to\nhave anything to do with it the old name should be maintained.\n\n\"It's to be 'Cropper and Burgess,'\" he said to Dorothy one afternoon.\n\"They fought hard for 'Cropper, Cropper, and Burgess;'--but I\nwouldn't stand more than one Cropper.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy, with something almost of scorn in\nher voice. By this time Dorothy had gone very deeply into banking\nbusiness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\n\n\"I WOULDN'T DO IT, IF I WAS YOU.\"\n\n\nMiss Stanbury at this time was known all through Exeter to be very\nmuch altered from the Miss Stanbury of old;--or even from the Miss\nStanbury of two years since. The Miss Stanbury of old was a stalwart\nlady who would play her rubber of whist five nights a week, and could\nhold her own in conversation against the best woman in Exeter,--not\nto speak of her acknowledged superiority over every man in that city.\nNow she cared little for the glories of debate; and though she still\nliked her rubber, and could wake herself up to the old fire in the\ndetection of a revoke or the claim for a second trick, her rubbers\nwere few and far between, and she would leave her own house on an\nevening only when all circumstances were favourable, and with many\nprecautions against wind and water. Some said that she was becoming\nold, and that she was going out like the snuff of a candle. But Sir\nPeter Mancrudy declared that she might live for the next fifteen\nyears, if she would only think so herself. \"It was true,\" Sir Peter\nsaid, \"that in the winter she had been ill, and that there had been\ndanger as to her throat during the east winds of the spring;--but\nthose dangers had passed away, and, if she would only exert herself,\nshe might be almost as good a woman as ever she had been.\" Sir Peter\nwas not a man of many words, or given to talk frequently of his\npatients; but it was clearly Sir Peter's opinion that Miss Stanbury's\nmind was ill at ease. She had become discontented with life, and\ntherefore it was that she cared no longer for the combat of tongues,\nand had become cold even towards the card-table. It was so in truth;\nand yet perhaps the lives of few men or women had been more innocent,\nand few had struggled harder to be just in their dealings and\ngenerous in their thoughts.\n\nThere was ever present to her mind an idea of failure and a fear lest\nshe had been mistaken in her views throughout her life. No one had\never been more devoted to peculiar opinions, or more strong in the\nuse of language for their expression; and she was so far true to\nherself, that she would never seem to retreat from the position she\nhad taken. She would still scorn the new fangles of the world around\nher, and speak of the changes which she saw as all tending to evil.\nBut, through it all, there was an idea present to herself that\nit could not be God's intention that things should really change\nfor the worse, and that the fault must be in her, because she had\nbeen unable to move as others had moved. She would sit thinking of\nthe circumstances of her own life and tell herself that with her\neverything had failed. She had loved, but had quarrelled with her\nlover; and her love had come to nothing--but barren wealth. She had\nfought for her wealth and had conquered;--and had become hard in the\nfight, and was conscious of her own hardness. In the early days of\nher riches and power she had taken her nephew by the hand,--and had\nthrown him away from her because he would not dress himself in her\nmirror. She had believed herself to be right, and would not, even\nnow, tell herself that she had been wrong; but there were doubts, and\nqualms of conscience, and an uneasiness,--because her life had been\na failure. Now she was seeking to appease her self-accusations by\nsacrificing everything for the happiness of her niece and her chosen\nhero; but as she went on with the work she felt that all would be in\nvain, unless she could sweep herself altogether from off the scene.\nShe had told herself that if she could bring Brooke to Exeter, his\nprospects would be made infinitely brighter than they would be in\nLondon, and that she in her last days would not be left utterly\nalone. But as the prospect of her future life came nearer to her, she\nsaw, or thought that she saw, that there was still failure before\nher. Young people would not want an old woman in the house with\nthem;--even though the old woman would declare that she would be no\nmore in the house than a tame cat. And she knew herself also too well\nto believe that she could make herself a tame cat in the home that\nhad so long been subject to her dominion. Would it not be better that\nshe should go away somewhere,--and die?\n\n\"If Mr. Brooke is to come here,\" Martha said to her one day, \"we\nought to begin and make the changes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"What changes? You are always wanting to make changes.\"\n\n\"If they was never made till I wanted them they'd never be made,\nma'am. But if there is to be a married couple there should be things\nproper. Anyways, ma'am, we ought to know;--oughtn't we?\"\n\nThe truth of this statement was so evident that Miss Stanbury could\nnot contradict it. But she had not even yet made up her mind. Ideas\nwere running through her head which she knew to be very wild, but\nof which she could not divest herself. \"Martha,\" she said, after a\nwhile, \"I think I shall go away from this myself.\"\n\n\"Leave the house, ma'am?\" said Martha, awestruck.\n\n\"There are other houses in the world, I suppose, in which an old\nwoman can live and die.\"\n\n\"There is houses, ma'am, of course.\"\n\n\"And what is the difference between one and another?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do it, ma'am, if I was you. I wouldn't do it if it was\never so. Sure the house is big enough for Mr. Brooke and Miss Dorothy\nalong with you. I wouldn't go and make such change as that;--I\nwouldn't indeed, ma'am.\" Martha spoke out almost with eloquence, so\nmuch expression was there in her face. Miss Stanbury said nothing\nmore at the moment, beyond signifying her indisposition to make up\nher mind to anything at the present moment. Yes;--the house was big\nenough as far as rooms were concerned; but how often had she heard\nthat an old woman must always be in the way, if attempting to live\nwith a newly-married couple? If a mother-in-law be unendurable, how\nmuch more so one whose connection would be less near? She could keep\nher own house no doubt, and let them go elsewhere; but what then\nwould come of her old dream, that Burgess, the new banker in the\ncity, should live in the very house that had been inhabited by the\nBurgesses, the bankers of old? There was certainly only one way out\nof all these troubles, and that way would be that she should--go from\nthem and be at rest.\n\nHer will had now been drawn out and completed for the third or fourth\ntime, and she had made no secret of its contents either with Brooke\nor Dorothy. The whole estate she left to Brooke, including the houses\nwhich were to become his after his uncle's death; and in regard to\nthe property she had made no further stipulation. \"I might have\nsettled it on your children,\" she said to him, \"but in doing so I\nshould have settled it on hers. I don't know why an old woman should\ntry to interfere with things after she has gone. I hope you won't\nsquander it, Brooke.\"\n\n\"I shall be a steady old man by that time,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope you'll be steady at any rate. But there it is, and God must\ndirect you in the use of it, if He will. It has been a burthen to\nme; but then I have been a solitary old woman.\" Half of what she had\nsaved she proposed to give Dorothy on her marriage, and for doing\nthis arrangements had already been made. There were various other\nlegacies, and the last she announced was one to her nephew, Hugh. \"I\nhave left him a thousand pounds,\" she said to Dorothy,--\"so that he\nmay remember me kindly at last.\" As to this, however, she exacted a\npledge that no intimation of the legacy was to be made to Hugh. Then\nit was that Dorothy told her aunt that Hugh intended to marry Nora\nRowley, one of the ladies who had been at the Clock House during the\ndays in which her mother had lived in grandeur; and then it was also\nthat Dorothy obtained leave to invite Hugh to her own wedding. \"I\nhope she will be happier than her sister,\" Miss Stanbury said, when\nshe heard of the intended marriage.\n\n\"It wasn't Mrs. Trevelyan's fault, you know, aunt.\"\n\n\"I say nothing about anybody's fault; but this I do say, that it was\na very great misfortune. I fought all that battle with your sister\nPriscilla, and I don't mean to fight it again, my dear. If Hugh\nmarries the young lady, I hope she will be more happy than her\nsister. There can be no harm in saying that.\"\n\nDorothy's letter to her brother shall be given, because it will\ninform the reader of all the arrangements as they were made up to\nthat time, and will convey the Exeter news respecting various persons\nwith whom our story is concerned.\n\n\n   The Close, July 20th, 186--.\n\n   DEAR HUGH,--\n\n   The day for my marriage is now fixed, and I wish with all\n   my heart that it was the same with you. Pray give my love\n   to Nora. It seems so odd that, though she was living for a\n   while with mamma at Nuncombe Putney, I never should have\n   seen her yet. I am very glad that Brooke has seen her, and\n   he declares that she is quite _magnificently beautiful_.\n   Those are his own words.\n\n   We are to be married on the 10th of August, a Wednesday,\n   and now comes my great news. Aunt Stanbury says that you\n   are to come and stay in the house. She bids me tell you so\n   with her love; and that you can have a room as long as you\n   like. _Of course you must come._ In the first place, you\n   must because you are to give me away, and Brooke wouldn't\n   have me if I wasn't given away properly; and then it will\n   make me so happy that you and Aunt Stanbury should be\n   friends again. You can stay as long as you like, but, of\n   course, you must come the day before the wedding. We are\n   to be married in the Cathedral, and there are to be two\n   clergymen, but I don't yet know who they will be;--not Mr.\n   Gibson, certainly, as you were good enough to suggest.\n\n   Mr. Gibson is married to Arabella French, and they have\n   gone away somewhere into Cornwall. Camilla has come back,\n   and I have seen her once. She looked ever so fierce, as\n   though she intended to declare that she didn't mind what\n   anybody may think. They say that she still protests that\n   she never will speak to her sister again.\n\n   I was introduced to Mr. Barty Burgess the other day.\n   Brooke was here, and we met him in the Close. I hardly\n   knew what he said to me, I was so frightened; but Brooke\n   said that he meant to be civil, and that he is going\n   to send me a present. I have got a quantity of things\n   already, and yesterday Mrs. MacHugh sent me such a\n   beautiful cream-jug. If you'll come in time on the 9th,\n   you shall see them all before they are put away.\n\n   Mamma and Priscilla are to be here, and they will come\n   on the 9th also. Poor, dear mamma is, I know, terribly\n   flurried about it, and so is Aunt Stanbury. It is so long\n   since they have seen each other. I don't think Priscilla\n   feels it the same way, because she is so brave. Do you\n   remember when it was first proposed that I should come\n   here? I am so glad I came,--because of Brooke. He will\n   come on the 9th, quite early, and I do so hope you will\n   come with him.\n\n   Yours most affectionately,\n\n   DOROTHY STANBURY.\n\n   Give my best, best love to Nora.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XC.\n\nLADY ROWLEY CONQUERED.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nWhen the Rowleys were back in London, and began to employ themselves\non the terrible work of making ready for their journey to the\nIslands, Lady Rowley gradually gave way about Hugh Stanbury. She had\nbecome aware that Nora would not go back with them,--unless under an\namount of pressure which she would find it impossible to use. And if\nNora did not go out to the Islands, what was to become of her unless\nshe married this man? Sir Marmaduke, when all was explained to him,\ndeclared that a girl must do what her parents ordered her to do.\n\"Other girls live with their fathers and mothers, and so must she.\"\nLady Rowley endeavoured to explain that other girls lived with their\nfathers and mothers, because they found themselves in established\nhomes from which they are not disposed to run away; but Nora's\nposition was, as she alleged, very different. Nora's home had\nlatterly been with her sister, and it was hardly to be expected\nthat the parental authority should not find itself impaired by the\ninterregnum which had taken place. Sir Marmaduke would not see the\nthing in the same light, and was disposed to treat his daughter with\na high hand. If she would not do as she was bidden, she should no\nlonger be daughter of his. In answer to this Lady Rowley could only\nrepeat her conviction that Nora would not go out to the Mandarins;\nand that as for disinheriting her, casting her off, cursing her, and\nthe rest,--she had no belief in such doings at all. \"On the stage\nthey do such things as that,\" she said; \"and, perhaps, they used to\ndo it once in reality. But you know that it's out of the question,\nnow. Fancy your standing up and cursing at the dear girl, just as we\nare all starting from Southampton!\" Sir Marmaduke knew as well as his\nwife that it would be impossible, and only muttered something about\nthe \"dear girl\" behaving herself with great impropriety.\n\nThey were all aware that Nora was not going to leave England, because\nno berth had been taken for her on board the ship, and because, while\nthe other girls were preparing for their long voyage, no preparations\nwere made for her. Of course she was not going. Sir Marmaduke would\nprobably have given way altogether immediately on his return to\nLondon, had he not discussed the matter with his friend Colonel\nOsborne. It became, of course, his duty to make some inquiry as\nto the Stanbury family, and he knew that Osborne had visited Mrs.\nStanbury when he made his unfortunate pilgrimage to the porch of\nCockchaffington Church. He told Osborne the whole story of Nora's\nengagement, telling also that other most heart-breaking tale of\nher conduct in regard to Mr. Glascock, and asked the Colonel what\nhe thought about the Stanburys. Now the Colonel did not hold the\nStanburys in high esteem. He had met Hugh, as the reader may perhaps\nremember, and had had some intercourse with the young man, which\nhad not been quite agreeable to him, on the platform of the railway\nstation at Exeter. And he had also heard something of the ladies\nat Nuncombe Putney during his short sojourn at the house of Mrs.\nCrocket. \"My belief is, they are beggars,\" said Colonel Osborne.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Sir Marmaduke, shaking his head.\n\n\"When I went over to call on Emily,--that time I was at\nCockchaffington, you know, when Trevelyan made himself such a d----\nfool,--I found the mother and sister living in a decentish house\nenough; but it wasn't their house.\"\n\n\"Not their own, you mean?\"\n\n\"It was a place that Trevelyan had got this young man to take for\nEmily, and they had merely gone there to be with her. They had been\nliving in a little bit of a cottage; a sort of a place that any--any\nploughman would live in. Just that kind of cottage.\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious!\"\n\n\"And they've gone to another just like it;--so I'm told.\"\n\n\"And can't he do anything better for them than that?\" asked Sir\nMarmaduke.\n\n\"I know nothing about him. I have met him, you know. He used to be\nwith Trevelyan;--that was when Nora took a fancy for him, of course.\nAnd I saw him once down in Devonshire, when I must say he behaved\nuncommonly badly,--doing all he could to foster Trevelyan's stupid\njealousy.\"\n\n\"He has changed his mind about that, I think.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he has; but he behaved very badly then. Let him shew up his\nincome;--that, I take it, is the question in such a case as this. His\nfather was a clergyman, and therefore I suppose he must be considered\nto be a gentleman. But has he means to support a wife, and keep up a\nhouse in London? If he has not, that is an end to it, I should say.\"\n\nBut Sir Marmaduke could not see his way to any such end, and,\nalthough he still looked black upon Nora, and talked to his wife\nof his determination to stand no contumacy, and hinted at cursing,\ndisinheriting, and the like, he began to perceive that Nora would\nhave her own way. In his unhappiness he regretted this visit to\nEngland, and almost thought that the Mandarins were a pleasanter\nresidence than London. He could do pretty much as he pleased there,\nand could live quietly, without the trouble which encountered him now\non every side.\n\nNora, immediately on her return to London, had written a note to\nHugh, simply telling him of her arrival and begging him to come and\nsee her. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"I must see him, and it would be nonsense\nto say that he must not come here. I have done what I have said\nI would do, and you ought not to make difficulties.\" Lady Rowley\ndeclared that Sir Marmaduke would be very angry if Hugh were admitted\nwithout his express permission. \"I don't want to do anything in the\ndark,\" continued Nora, \"but of course I must see him. I suppose it\nwill be better that he should come to me than that I should go to\nhim?\" Lady Rowley quite understood the threat that was conveyed in\nthis. It would be much better that Hugh should come to the hotel, and\nthat he should be treated then as an accepted lover. She had come to\nthat conclusion. But she was obliged to vacillate for awhile between\nher husband and her daughter. Hugh came of course, and Sir Marmaduke,\nby his wife's advice, kept out of the way. Lady Rowley, though she\nwas at home, kept herself also out of the way, remaining above with\nher two other daughters. Nora thus achieved the glory and happiness\nof receiving her lover alone.\n\n\"My own true girl!\" he said, speaking with his arms still round her\nwaist.\n\n\"I am true enough; but whether I am your own,--that is another\nquestion.\"\n\n\"You mean to be?\"\n\n\"But papa doesn't mean it. Papa says that you are nobody, and that\nyou haven't got an income; and thinks that I had better go back and\nbe an old maid at the Mandarins.\"\n\n\"And what do you think yourself, Nora?\"\n\n\"What do I think? As far as I can understand, young ladies are not\nallowed to think at all. They have to do what their papas tell them.\nThat will do, Hugh. You can talk without taking hold of me.\"\n\n\"It is such a time since I have had a hold of you,--as you call it.\"\n\n\"It will be much longer before you can do so again, if I go back\nto the Islands with papa. I shall expect you to be true, you know;\nand it will be ten years at the least before I can hope to be home\nagain.\"\n\n\"I don't think you mean to go, Nora.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do? That idea of yours of walking out to the\nnext church and getting ourselves married sounds very nice and\nindependent, but you know that it is not practicable.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, I know it is.\"\n\n\"It is not practicable for me, Hugh. Of all things in the world I\ndon't want to be a Lydia. I won't do anything that anybody shall ever\nsay that your wife ought not to have done. Young women when they are\nmarried ought to have their papas' and mammas' consent. I have been\nthinking about it a great deal for the last month or two, and I have\nmade up my mind to that.\"\n\n\"What is it all to come to, then?\"\n\n\"I mean to get papa's consent. That is what it is to come to.\"\n\n\"And if he is obstinate?\"\n\n\"I shall coax him round at last. When the time for going comes, he'll\nyield then.\"\n\n\"But you will not go with them?\" As he asked this he came to her and\ntried again to take her by the waist; but she retreated from him, and\ngot herself clear from his arm. \"If you are afraid of me, I shall\nknow that you think it possible that we may be parted.\"\n\n\"I am not a bit afraid of you, Hugh.\"\n\n\"Nora, I think you ought to tell me something definitely.\"\n\n\"I think I have been definite enough, sir. You may be sure of this,\nhowever;--I will not go back to the Islands.\"\n\n\"Give me your hand on that.\"\n\n\"There is my hand. But, remember;--I had told you just as much\nbefore. I don't mean to go back. I mean to stay here. I mean;--but I\ndo not think I will tell you all the things I mean to do.\"\n\n\"You mean to be my wife?\"\n\n\"Certainly;--some day, when the difficulty about the chairs and\ntables can settle itself. The real question now is,--what am I to do\nwith myself when papa and mamma are gone?\"\n\n\"Become Mrs. H. Stanbury at once. Chairs and tables! You shall have\nchairs and tables as many as you want. You won't be too proud to live\nin lodgings for a few months?\"\n\n\"There must be preliminaries, Hugh,--even for lodgings, though they\nmay be very slender. Papa goes in less than three weeks now, and\nmamma has got something else to think of than my marriage garments.\nAnd then there are all manner of difficulties, money difficulties\nand others, out of which I don't see my way yet.\" Hugh began to\nasseverate that it was his business to help her through all money\ndifficulties as well as others; but she soon stopped his eloquence.\n\"It will be by-and-by, Hugh, and I hope you'll support the burden\nlike a man; but just at present there is a hitch. I shouldn't have\ncome over at all;--I should have stayed with Emily in Italy, had I\nnot thought that I was bound to see you.\"\n\n\"My own darling!\"\n\n\"When papa goes, I think that I had better go back to her.\"\n\n\"I'll take you!\" said Hugh, picturing to himself all the pleasures of\nsuch a tour together over the Alps.\n\n\"No you won't, because that would be improper. When we travel\ntogether we must go Darby and Joan fashion, as man and wife. I think\nI had better go back to Emily, because her position there is so\nterrible. There must come some end to it, I suppose soon. He will be\nbetter, or he will become so bad that,--that medical interference\nwill be unavoidable. But I do not like that she should be alone. She\ngave me a home when she had one;--and I must always remember that\nI met you there.\" After this there was of course another attempt\nwith Hugh's right arm, which on this occasion was not altogether\nunsuccessful. And then she told him of her friendship for Mr.\nGlascock's wife, and of her intention at some future time to visit\nthem at Monkhams.\n\n\n   [Illustration: \"I must always remember that I met you there.\"]\n\n\n\"And see all the glories that might have been your own,\" he said.\n\n\"And think of the young man who has robbed me of them all! And you\nare to go there too, so that you may see what you have done. There\nwas a time, Hugh, when I was very nearly pleasing all my friends\nand shewing myself to be a young lady of high taste and noble\nfortune,--and an obedient, good girl.\"\n\n\"And why didn't you?\"\n\n\"I thought I would wait just a little longer.\nBecause,--because,--because--. Oh, Hugh, how cross you were to me\nafterwards when you came down to Nuncombe and would hardly speak to\nme!\"\n\n\"And why didn't I speak to you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Because you were cross, and surly, and thinking of\nnothing but your tobacco, I believe. Do you remember how we walked to\nNiddon, and you hadn't a word for anybody?\"\n\n\"I remember I wanted you to go down to the river with me, and you\nwouldn't go.\"\n\n\"You asked me only once, and I did so long to go with you. Do you\nremember the rocks in the river? I remember the place as though I saw\nit now; and how I longed to jump from one stone to another. Hugh, if\nwe are ever married, you must take me there, and let me jump on those\nstones.\"\n\n\"You pretended that you could not think of wetting your feet.\"\n\n\"Of course I pretended,--because you were so cross, and so cold. Oh,\ndear! I wonder whether you will ever know it all.\"\n\n\"Don't I know it all now?\"\n\n\"I suppose you do, nearly. There is mighty little of a secret in it,\nand it is the same thing that is going on always. Only it seems so\nstrange to me that I should ever have loved any one so dearly,--and\nthat for next to no reason at all. You never made yourself very\ncharming that I know of;--did you?\"\n\n\"I did my best. It wasn't much, I dare say.\"\n\n\"You did nothing, sir,--except just let me fall in love with you. And\nyou were not quite sure that you would let me do that.\"\n\n\"Nora, I don't think you do understand.\"\n\n\"I do;--perfectly. Why were you cross with me, instead of saying one\nnice word when you were down at Nuncombe? I do understand.\"\n\n\"Why was it?\"\n\n\"Because you did not think well enough of me to believe that I would\ngive myself to a man who had no fortune of his own. I know it now,\nand I knew it then; and therefore I wouldn't dabble in the river with\nyou. But it's all over now, and we'll go and get wet together like\ndear little children, and Priscilla shall scold us when we come\nback.\"\n\nThey were alone in the sitting-room for more than an hour, and Lady\nRowley was patient up-stairs as mothers will be patient in such\nemergencies. Sophie and Lucy had gone out and left her; and there\nshe remained telling herself, as the weary minutes went by, that as\nthe thing was to be, it was well that the young people should be\ntogether. Hugh Stanbury could never be to her what Mr. Glascock would\nhave been,--a son-in-law to sit and think about, and dream of, and\nbe proud of,--whose existence as her son-in-law would in itself have\nbeen a happiness to her out in her banishment at the other side of\nthe world; but nevertheless it was natural to her, as a soft-hearted\nloving mother with many daughters, that any son-in-law should be dear\nto her. Now that she had gradually brought herself round to believe\nin Nora's marriage, she was disposed to make the best of Hugh, to\nremember that he was certainly a clever man, that he was an honest\nfellow, and that she had heard of him as a good son and a kind\nbrother, and that he had behaved well in reference to her Emily and\nTrevelyan. She was quite willing now that Hugh should be happy, and\nshe sat there thinking that the time was very long, but still waiting\npatiently till she should be summoned. \"You must let me go for mamma\nfor a moment,\" Nora said. \"I want you to see her and make yourself a\ngood boy before her. If you are ever to be her son-in-law, you ought\nto be in her good graces.\" Hugh declared that he would do his best,\nand Nora fetched her mother.\n\nStanbury found some difficulty in making himself a \"good boy\" in\nLady Rowley's presence; and Lady Rowley herself, for some time, felt\nvery strongly the awkwardness of the meeting. She had never formally\nrecognised the young man as her daughter's accepted suitor, and was\nnot yet justified in doing so by any permission from Sir Marmaduke;\nbut, as the young people had been for the last hour or two alone\ntogether, with her connivance and sanction, it was indispensable\nthat she should in some way signify her parental adherence to the\narrangement. Nora began by talking about Emily, and Trevelyan's\ncondition and mode of living were discussed. Then Lady Rowley said\nsomething about their coming journey, and Hugh, with a lucky blunder,\nspoke of Nora's intended return to Italy. \"We don't know how that may\nbe,\" said Lady Rowley. \"Her papa still wishes her to go back with\nus.\"\n\n\"Mamma, you know that that is impossible,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Not impossible, my love.\"\n\n\"But she will not go back,\" said Hugh. \"Lady Rowley, you would not\npropose to separate us by such a distance as that?\"\n\n\"It is Sir Marmaduke that you must ask.\"\n\n\"Mamma, mamma!\" exclaimed Nora, rushing to her mother's side, \"it is\nnot papa that we must ask,--not now. We want you to be our friend.\nDon't we, Hugh? And, mamma, if you will really be our friend, of\ncourse, papa will come round.\"\n\n\"My dear Nora!\"\n\n\"You know he will, mamma; and you know that you mean to be good and\nkind to us. Of course I can't go back to the Islands with you. How\ncould I go so far and leave him behind? He might have half-a-dozen\nwives before I could get back to him--\"\n\n\"If you have not more trust in him than that--!\"\n\n\"Long engagements are awful bores,\" said Hugh, finding it to be\nnecessary that he also should press forward his argument.\n\n\"I can trust him as far as I can see him,\" said Nora, \"and therefore\nI do not want to lose sight of him altogether.\"\n\nLady Rowley of course gave way and embraced her accepted son-in-law.\nAfter all it might have been worse. He saw his way clearly, he said,\nto making six hundred a year, and did not at all doubt that before\nlong he would do better than that. He proposed that they should be\nmarried some time in the autumn, but was willing to acknowledge that\nmuch must depend on the position of Trevelyan and his wife. He would\nhold himself ready at any moment, he said, to start to Italy, and\nwould do all that could be done by a brother. Then Lady Rowley gave\nhim her blessing, and kissed him again,--and Nora kissed him too, and\nhung upon him, and did not push him away at all when his arm crept\nround her waist. And that feeling came upon him which must surely be\nacknowledged by all engaged young men when they first find themselves\nencouraged by mammas in the taking of liberties which they have\nhitherto regarded as mysteries to be hidden, especially from maternal\neyes,--that feeling of being a fine fat calf decked out with ribbons\nfor a sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCI.\n\nFOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.\n\n\nAnother week went by and Sir Marmaduke had even yet not surrendered.\nHe quite understood that Nora was not to go back to the Islands.\nAnd he had visited Mr. and Mrs. Outhouse at St. Diddulph's in order\nto secure a home for her there, if it might be possible. Mr. Outhouse\ndid not refuse, but gave the permission in such a fashion as to make\nit almost equal to a refusal. \"He was,\" he said, \"much attached to\nhis niece Nora, but he had heard that there was a love affair.\" Sir\nMarmaduke, of course, could not deny the love affair. There was\ncertainly a love affair of which he did not personally approve, as\nthe gentleman had no fixed income and as far as he could understand\nno fixed profession. \"Such a love affair,\" thought Mr. Outhouse, \"was\na sort of thing that he didn't know how to manage at all. If Nora\ncame to him, was the young man to visit at the house, or was he\nnot?\" Then Mrs. Outhouse said something as to the necessity of an\nanti-Stanbury pledge on Nora's part, and Sir Marmaduke found that\nthat scheme must be abandoned. Mrs. Trevelyan had written from\nFlorence more than once or twice, and in her last letter had said\nthat she would prefer not to have Nora with her. She was at that\ntime living in lodgings at Siena and had her boy there also. She saw\nher husband every other day; but nevertheless,--according to her\nstatements,--her visits to Casalunga were made in opposition to his\nwishes. He had even expressed a desire that she should leave Siena\nand return to England. He had once gone so far as to say that if she\nwould do so, he would follow her. But she clearly did not believe\nhim, and in all her letters spoke of him as one whom she could not\nregard as being under the guidance of reason. She had taken her\nchild with her once or twice to the house, and on the first occasion\nTrevelyan had made much of his son, had wept over him, and professed\nthat in losing him he had lost his only treasure; but after that he\nhad not noticed the boy, and latterly she had gone alone. She thought\nthat perhaps her visits cheered him, breaking the intensity of his\nsolitude; but he never expressed himself gratified by them, never\nasked her to remain at the house, never returned with her into Siena,\nand continually spoke of her return to England as a step which must\nbe taken soon,--and the sooner the better. He intended to follow her,\nhe said; and she explained very fully how manifest was his wish that\nshe should go, by the temptation to do so which he thought that he\nheld out by this promise. He had spoken, on every occasion of her\npresence with him, of Sir Marmaduke's attempt to prove him to be a\nmadman; but declared that he was afraid of no one in England, and\nwould face all the lawyers in Chancery Lane and all the doctors\nin Savile Row. Nevertheless, so said Mrs. Trevelyan, he would\nundoubtedly remain at Casalunga till after Sir Marmaduke should have\nsailed. He was not so mad but that he knew that no one else would be\nso keen to take steps against him as would Sir Marmaduke. As for his\nhealth, her account of him was very sad. \"He seemed,\" she said, \"to\nbe withering away.\" His hand was mere skin and bone. His hair and\nbeard so covered his thin long cheeks, that there was nothing left\nof his face but his bright, large, melancholy eyes. His legs had\nbecome so frail and weak that they would hardly bear his weight as he\nwalked; and his clothes, though he had taken a fancy to throw aside\nall that he had brought with him from England, hung so loose about\nhim that they seemed as though they would fall from him. Once she had\nventured to send out to him from Siena a doctor to whom she had been\nrecommended in Florence; but he had taken the visit in very bad part,\nhad told the gentleman that he had no need for any medical services,\nand had been furious with her, because of her offence in having sent\nsuch a visitor. He had told her that if ever she ventured to take\nsuch a liberty again, he would demand the child back, and refuse her\npermission inside the gates of Casalunga. \"Don't come, at any rate,\ntill I send for you,\" Mrs. Trevelyan said in her last letter to her\nsister. \"Your being here would do no good, and would, I think, make\nhim feel that he was being watched. My hope is, at last, to get him\nto return with me. If you were here, I think this would be less\nlikely. And then why should you be mixed up with such unutterable\nsadness and distress more than is essentially necessary? My health\nstands wonderfully well, though the heat here is very great. It is\ncooler at Casalunga than in the town,--of which I am glad for his\nsake. He perspires so profusely that it seems to me he cannot stand\nthe waste much longer. I know he will not go to England as long as\npapa is there;--but I hope that he may be induced to do so by slow\nstages as soon as he knows that papa has gone. Mind you send me a\nnewspaper, so that he may see it stated in print that papa has\nsailed.\"\n\nIt followed as one consequence of these letters from Florence that\nNora was debarred from the Italian scheme as a mode of passing her\ntime till some house should be open for her reception. She had\nsuggested to Hugh that she might go for a few weeks to Nuncombe\nPutney, but he had explained to her the nature of his mother's\ncottage, and had told her that there was no hole there in which she\ncould lay her head. \"There never was such a forlorn young woman,\"\nshe said. \"When papa goes I shall literally be without shelter.\"\nThere had come a letter from Mrs. Glascock,--at least it was signed\nCaroline Glascock, though another name might have been used,--dated\nfrom Milan, saying that they were hurrying back to Naples even at\nthat season of the year, because Lord Peterborough was dead. \"And\nshe is Lady Peterborough!\" said Lady Rowley, unable to repress the\nexpression of the old regrets. \"Of course she is Lady Peterborough,\nmamma; what else should she be?--though she does not so sign\nherself.\" \"We think,\" said the American peeress, \"that we shall be\nat Monkhams before the end of August, and Charles says that you are\nto come just the same. There will be nobody else there, of course,\nbecause of Lord Peterborough's death.\" \"I saw it in the paper,\" said\nSir Marmaduke, \"and quite forgot to mention it.\"\n\nThat same evening there was a long family discussion about Nora's\nprospects. They were all together in the gloomy sitting-room at\nGregg's Hotel, and Sir Marmaduke had not yielded. The ladies had\nbegun to feel that it would be well not to press him to yield.\nPractically he had yielded. There was now no question of cursing\nand of so-called disinheritance. Nora was to remain in England, of\ncourse with the intention of being married to Hugh Stanbury; and the\ndifficulty consisted in the need of an immediate home for her. It\nwanted now but twelve days to that on which the family were to sail\nfrom Southampton, and nothing had been settled. \"If papa will allow\nme something ever so small, and will trust me, I will live alone in\nlodgings,\" said Nora.\n\n\"It is the maddest thing I ever heard,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Who would take care of you, Nora?\" asked Lady Rowley.\n\n\"And who would walk about with you?\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I don't see how it would be possible to live alone like that,\" said\nSophie.\n\n\"Nobody would take care of me, and nobody would walk about with me,\nand I could live alone very well,\" said Nora. \"I don't see why a\nyoung woman is to be supposed to be so absolutely helpless as all\nthat comes to. Of course it won't be very nice,--but it need not be\nfor long.\"\n\n\"Why not for long?\" asked Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Not for very long,\" said Nora.\n\n\"It does not seem to me,\" said Sir Marmaduke, after a considerable\npause, \"that this gentleman himself is so particularly anxious for\nthe match. I have heard no day named, and no rational proposition\nmade.\"\n\n\"Papa, that is unfair, most unfair,--and ungenerous.\"\n\n\"Nora,\" said her mother, \"do not speak in that way to your father.\"\n\n\"Mamma, it is unfair. Papa accuses Mr. Stanbury of being,--being\nlukewarm and untrue,--of not being in earnest.\"\n\n\"I would rather that he were not in earnest,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Mr. Stanbury is ready at any time,\" continued Nora. \"He would have\nthe banns at once read, and marry me in three weeks,--if I would let\nhim.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Nora!\" exclaimed Lady Rowley.\n\n\"But I have refused to name any day, or to make any arrangement,\nbecause I did not wish to do so before papa had given his consent.\nThat is why things are in this way. If papa will but let me take a\nroom till I can go to Monkhams, I will have everything arranged from\nthere. You can trust Mr. Glascock for that, and you can trust her.\"\n\n\"I suppose your papa will make you some allowance,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"She is entitled to nothing, as she has refused to go to her proper\nhome,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\nThe conversation, which had now become very disagreeable, was\nnot allowed to go any further. And it was well that it should be\ninterrupted. They all knew that Sir Marmaduke must be brought round\nby degrees, and that both Nora and Lady Rowley had gone as far as was\nprudent at present. But all trouble on this head was suddenly ended\nfor this evening by the entrance of the waiter with a telegram.\nIt was addressed to Lady Rowley, and she opened it with trembling\nhands,--as ladies always do open telegrams. It was from Emily\nTrevelyan. \"Louis is much worse. Let somebody come to me. Hugh\nStanbury would be the best.\"\n\nIn a few minutes they were so much disturbed that no one quite knew\nwhat should be done at once. Lady Rowley began by declaring that she\nwould go herself. Sir Marmaduke of course pointed out that this was\nimpossible, and suggested that he would send a lawyer. Nora professed\nherself ready to start immediately on the journey, but was stopped by\na proposition from her sister Lucy that in that case Hugh Stanbury\nwould of course go with her. Lady Rowley asked whether Hugh would go,\nand Nora asserted that he would go immediately as a matter of course.\nShe was sure he would go, let the people at the D. R. say what they\nmight. According to her there was always somebody at the call of the\neditor of the D. R. to do the work of anybody else, when anybody else\nwanted to go away. Sir Marmaduke shook his head, and was very uneasy.\nHe still thought that a lawyer would be best, feeling, no doubt, that\nif Stanbury's services were used on such an occasion, there must be\nan end of all opposition to the marriage. But before half-an-hour was\nover Stanbury was sent for. The boots of the hotel went off in a cab\nto the office of the D. R. with a note from Lady Rowley. \"Dear Mr.\nStanbury,--We have had a telegram from Emily, and want to see you,\n_at once_. Please come. We shall sit up and wait for you till you do\ncome.--E. R.\"\n\nIt was very distressing to them because, let the result be what it\nmight, it was all but impossible that Mrs. Trevelyan should be with\nthem before they had sailed, and it was quite out of the question\nthat they should now postpone their journey. Were Stanbury to start\nby the morning train on the following day, he could not reach Siena\ntill the afternoon of the fourth day; and let the result be what\nit might when he arrived there, it would be out of the question\nthat Emily Trevelyan should come back quite at once, or that she\nshould travel at the same speed. Of course they might hear again by\ntelegram, and also by letter; but they could not see her, or have any\nhand in her plans. \"If anything were to happen, she might have come\nwith us,\" said Lady Rowley.\n\n\"It is out of the question,\" said Sir Marmaduke gloomily. \"I could\nnot give up the places I have taken.\"\n\n\"A few days more would have done it.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose she would wish to go,\" said Nora. \"Of course she\nwould not take Louey there. Why should she? And then I don't suppose\nhe is so ill as that.\"\n\n\"There is no saying,\" said Sir Marmaduke. It was very evident\nthat, whatever might be Sir Marmaduke's opinion, he had no\nstrongly-developed wish for his son-in-law's recovery.\n\nThey all sat up waiting for Hugh Stanbury till eleven, twelve, one,\nand two o'clock at night. The \"boots\" had returned, saying that Mr.\nStanbury had not been at the office of the newspaper, but that,\naccording to information received, he certainly would be there that\nnight. No other address had been given to the man, and the note had\ntherefore of necessity been left at the office. Sir Marmaduke became\nvery fretful, and was evidently desirous of being liberated from his\nnight watch. But he could not go himself, and shewed his impatience\nby endeavouring to send the others away. Lady Rowley replied for\nherself that she should certainly remain in her corner on the sofa\nall night, if it were necessary; and as she slept very soundly in her\ncorner, her comfort was not much impaired. Nora was pertinacious in\nrefusing to go to bed. \"I should only go to my own room, papa, and\nremain there,\" she said. \"Of course I must speak to him before he\ngoes.\" Sophie and Lucy considered that they had as much right to sit\nup as Nora, and submitted to be called geese and idiots by their\nfather.\n\nSir Marmaduke had arisen with a snort from a short slumber, and\nhad just sworn that he and everybody else should go to bed, when\nthere came a ring at the front-door bell. The trusty boots had also\nremained up, and in two minutes Hugh Stanbury was in the room. He\nhad to make his excuses before anything else could be said. When he\nreached the D. R. office between ten and eleven, it was absolutely\nincumbent on him to write a leading article before he left it. He\nhad been in the reporter's gallery of the House all the evening,\nand he had come away laden with his article. \"It was certainly\nbetter that we should remain up, than that the whole town should be\ndisappointed,\" said Sir Marmaduke, with something of a sneer.\n\n\"It is so very, very good of you to come,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Indeed, it is,\" said Lady Rowley; \"but we were quite sure you would\ncome.\" Having kissed and blessed him as her son-in-law, Lady Rowley\nwas now prepared to love him almost as well as though he had been\nLord Peterborough.\n\n\"Perhaps, Mr. Stanbury, we had better show you this telegram,\" said\nSir Marmaduke, who had been standing with the scrap of paper in his\nhand since the ring of the bell had been heard. Hugh took the message\nand read it. \"I do not know what should have made my daughter mention\nyour name,\" continued Sir Marmaduke;--\"but as she has done so, and as\nperhaps the unfortunate invalid himself may have alluded to you, we\nthought it best to send for you.\"\n\n\"No doubt it was best, Sir Marmaduke.\"\n\n\"We are so situated that I cannot go. It is absolutely necessary that\nwe should leave town for Southampton on Friday week. The ship sails\non Saturday.\"\n\n\"I will go as a matter of course,\" said Hugh. \"I will start at\nonce,--at any time. To tell the truth, when I got Lady Rowley's note,\nI thought that it was to be so. Trevelyan and I were very intimate at\none time, and it may be that he will receive me without displeasure.\"\n\nThere was much to be discussed, and considerable difficulty in\nthe discussion. This was enhanced, too, by the feeling in the\nminds of all of them that Hugh and Sir Marmaduke would not meet\nagain,--probably for many years. Were they to part now on terms of\nclose affection, or were they to part almost as strangers? Had Lucy\nand Sophie not persistently remained up, Nora would have faced the\ndifficulty, and taken the bull by the horns, and asked her father to\nsanction her engagement in the presence of her lover. But she could\nnot do it before so many persons, even though the persons were her\nown nearest relatives. And then there arose another embarrassment.\nSir Marmaduke, who had taught himself to believe that Stanbury\nwas so poor as hardly to have the price of a dinner in his\npocket,--although, in fact, our friend Hugh was probably the richer\nman of the two,--said something about defraying the cost of the\njourney. \"It is taken altogether on our behalf,\" said Sir Marmaduke.\nHugh became red in the face, looked angry, and muttered a word or two\nabout Trevelyan being the oldest friend he had in the world,--\"even\nif there were nothing else.\" Sir Marmaduke felt ashamed of\nhimself,--without cause, indeed, for the offer was natural,--said\nnothing further about it; but appeared to be more stiff and ungainly\nthan ever.\n\nThe Bradshaw was had out and consulted, and nearly half an hour\nwas spent in poring over that wondrous volume. It is the fashion\nto abuse Bradshaw,--we speak now especially of Bradshaw the\nContinental,--because all the minutest details of the autumn tour,\njust as the tourist thinks that it may be made, cannot be made patent\nto him at once without close research amidst crowded figures. After\nmuch experience we make bold to say that Bradshaw knows more, and\nwill divulge more in a quarter of an hour, of the properest mode of\ngetting from any city in Europe to any other city more than fifty\nmiles distant, than can be learned in that first city in a single\nmorning with the aid of a courier, a carriage, a pair of horses, and\nall the temper that any ordinary tourist possesses. The Bradshaw was\nhad out, and it was at last discovered that nothing could be gained\nin the journey from London to Siena by starting in the morning.\nIntending as he did to travel through without sleeping on the road,\nStanbury could not do better than leave London by the night mail\ntrain, and this he determined to do. But when that was arranged, then\ncame the nature of his commission. What was he to do? No commission\ncould be given to him. A telegram should be sent to Emily the next\nmorning to say that he was coming; and then he would hurry on and\ntake his orders from her.\n\nThey were all in doubt, terribly in doubt, whether the aggravated\nmalady of which the telegram spoke was malady of the mind or of the\nbody. If of the former nature then the difficulty might be very great\nindeed; and it would be highly expedient that Stanbury should have\nsome one in Italy to assist him. It was Nora who suggested that he\nshould carry a letter of introduction to Mr. Spalding, and it was she\nwho wrote it. Sir Marmaduke had not foregathered very closely with\nthe English Minister, and nothing was said of assistance that should\nbe peculiarly British. Then, at last, about three or four in the\nmorning came the moment for parting. Sir Marmaduke had suggested that\nStanbury should dine with them on the next day before he started, but\nHugh had declined, alleging that as the day was at his command it\nmust be devoted to the work of providing for his absence. In truth,\nSir Marmaduke had given the invitation with a surly voice, and Hugh,\nthough he was ready to go to the North Pole for any others of the\nfamily, was at the moment in an aggressive mood of mind towards Sir\nMarmaduke.\n\n\"I will send a message directly I get there,\" he said, holding Lady\nRowley by the hand, \"and will write fully,--to you,--immediately.\"\n\n\"God bless you, my dear friend!\" said Lady Rowley, crying.\n\n\"Good night, Sir Marmaduke,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Good night, Mr. Stanbury.\"\n\nThen he gave a hand to the two girls, each of whom, as she took it,\nsobbed, and looked away from Nora. Nora was standing away from them,\nby herself, and away from the door, holding on to her chair, and with\nher hands clasped together. She had prepared nothing,--not a word, or\nan attitude, not a thought, for his farewell. But she had felt that\nit was coming, and had known that she must trust to him for a cue\nfor her own demeanour. If he could say adieu with a quiet voice, and\nsimply with a touch of the hand, then would she do the same,--and\nendeavour to think no worse of him. Nor had he prepared anything; but\nwhen the moment came he could not leave her after that fashion. He\nstood a moment hesitating, not approaching her, and merely called her\nby her name,--\"Nora!\" For a moment she was still; for a moment she\nheld by her chair; and then she rushed into his arms. He did not much\ncare for her father now, but kissed her hair and her forehead, and\nheld her closely to his bosom. \"My own, own Nora!\"\n\nIt was necessary that Sir Marmaduke should say something. There\nwas at first a little scene between all the women, during which he\narranged his deportment. \"Mr. Stanbury,\" he said, \"let it be so.\nI could wish for my child's sake, and also for your own, that your\nmeans of living were less precarious.\" Hugh accepted this simply as\nan authority for another embrace, and then he allowed them all to go\nto bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCII.\n\nTREVELYAN DISCOURSES ON LIFE.\n\n\nStanbury made his journey without pause or hindrance till he reached\nFlorence, and as the train for Siena made it necessary that he should\nremain there for four or five hours, he went to an inn, and dressed\nand washed himself, and had a meal, and was then driven to Mr.\nSpalding's house. He found the American Minister at home, and was\nreceived with cordiality; but Mr. Spalding could tell him little or\nnothing about Trevelyan. They went up to Mrs. Spalding's room, and\nHugh was told by her that she had seen Mrs. Trevelyan once since her\nniece's marriage, and that then she had represented her husband as\nbeing very feeble. Hugh, in the midst of his troubles, was amused\nby a second and a third, perhaps by a fourth, reference to \"Lady\nPeterborough.\" Mrs. Spalding's latest tidings as to the Trevelyans\nhad been received through \"Lady Peterborough\" from Nora Rowley. \"Lady\nPeterborough\" was at the present moment at Naples, but was expected\nto pass north through Florence in a day or two. They, the Spaldings\nthemselves, were kept in Florence in this very hot weather by this\ncircumstance. They were going up to the Tyrolese mountains for a\nfew weeks as soon as \"Lady Peterborough\" should have left them for\nEngland. \"Lady Peterborough\" would have been so happy to make Mr.\nStanbury's acquaintance, and to have heard something direct from\nher friend Nora. Then Mrs. Spalding smiled archly, showing thereby\nthat she knew all about Hugh Stanbury and his relation to Nora\nRowley. From all which, and in accordance with the teaching which\nwe got,--alas, now many years ago,--from a great master on the\nsubject, we must conclude that poor, dear Mrs. Spalding was a snob.\nNevertheless, with all deference to the memory of that great master,\nwe think that Mrs. Spalding's allusions to the success in life\nachieved by her niece were natural and altogether pardonable; and\nthat reticence on the subject,--a calculated determination to\nabstain from mentioning a triumph which must have been very dear to\nher,--would have betrayed on the whole a condition of mind lower than\nthat which she exhibited. While rank, wealth, and money are held to\nbe good things by all around us, let them be acknowledged as such. It\nis natural that a mother should be as proud when her daughter marries\nan Earl's heir as when her son becomes Senior Wrangler; and when we\nmeet a lady in Mrs. Spalding's condition who purposely abstains from\nmentioning the name of her titled daughter, we shall be disposed to\njudge harshly of the secret workings of that lady's thoughts on the\nsubject. We prefer the exhibition, which we feel to be natural. Mr.\nSpalding got our friend by the button-hole, and was making him a\nspeech on the perilous condition in which Mrs. Trevelyan was placed;\nbut Stanbury, urged by the circumstances of his position, pulled out\nhis watch, pleaded the hour, and escaped.\n\nHe found Mrs. Trevelyan waiting for him at the station at Siena.\nHe would hardly have known her,--not from any alteration that was\nphysically personal to herself, not that she had become older in\nface, or thin, or grey, or sickly,--but that the trouble of her\nlife had robbed her for the time of that brightness of apparel, of\nthat pride of feminine gear, of that sheen of high-bred womanly\nbearing with which our wives and daughters are so careful to invest\nthemselves. She knew herself to be a wretched woman, whose work in\nlife now was to watch over a poor prostrate wretch, and who had\nthrown behind her all ideas of grace and beauty. It was not quickly\nthat this condition had come upon her. She had been unhappy at\nNuncombe Putney; but unhappiness had not then told upon the outward\nwoman. She had been more wretched still at St. Diddulph's, and all\nthe outward circumstances of life in her uncle's parsonage had been\nvery wearisome to her; but she had striven against it all, and the\nsheen and outward brightness had still been there. After that her\nchild had been taken from her, and the days which she had passed in\nManchester Street had been very grievous;--but even yet she had not\ngiven way. It was not till her child had been brought back to her,\nand she had seen the life which her husband was living, and that her\nanger,--hot anger,--had been changed to pity, and that with pity love\nhad returned, it was not till this point had come in her sad life\nthat her dress became always black and sombre, that a veil habitually\ncovered her face, that a bonnet took the place of the jaunty hat that\nshe had worn, and that the prettinesses of her life were lain aside.\n\"It is very good of you to come,\" she said; \"very good. I hardly knew\nwhat to do, I was so wretched. On the day that I sent he was so bad\nthat I was obliged to do something.\" Stanbury, of course, inquired\nafter Trevelyan's health, as they were being driven up to Mrs.\nTrevelyan's lodgings. On the day on which she had sent the telegram\nher husband had again been furiously angry with her. She had\ninterfered, or had endeavoured to interfere, in some arrangements as\nto his health and comfort, and he had turned upon her with an order\nthat the child should be at once sent back to him, and that she\nshould immediately quit Siena. \"When I said that Louey could not be\nsent,--and who could send a child into such keeping,--he told me\nthat I was the basest liar that ever broke a promise, and the vilest\ntraitor that had ever returned evil for good. I was never to come to\nhim again,--never; and the gate of the house would be closed against\nme if I appeared there.\"\n\nOn the next day she had gone again, however, and had seen him, and\nhad visited him on every day since. Nothing further had been said\nabout the child, and he had now become almost too weak for violent\nanger. \"I told him you were coming, and though he would not say so,\nI think he is glad of it. He expects you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I will go this evening, if he will let me.\"\n\n\"Not to-night. I think he goes to bed almost as the sun sets. I am\nnever there myself after four or five in the afternoon. I told him\nthat you should be there to-morrow,--alone. I have hired a little\ncarriage, and you can take it. He said specially that I was not\nto come with you. Papa goes certainly on next Saturday?\" It was a\nSaturday now,--this day on which Stanbury had arrived at Siena.\n\n\"He leaves town on Friday.\"\n\n\"You must make him believe that. Do not tell him suddenly, but bring\nit in by degrees. He thinks that I am deceiving him. He would go back\nif he knew that papa were gone.\"\n\nThey spent a long evening together, and Stanbury learned all that\nMrs. Trevelyan could tell him of her husband's state. There was no\ndoubt, she said, that his reason was affected; but she thought the\nstate of his mind was diseased in a ratio the reverse of that of his\nbody, and that when he was weakest in health, then were his ideas the\nmost clear and rational. He never now mentioned Colonel Osborne's\nname, but would refer to the affairs of the last two years as though\nthey had been governed by an inexorable Fate which had utterly\ndestroyed his happiness without any fault on his part. \"You may be\nsure,\" she said, \"that I never accuse him. Even when he says terrible\nthings of me,--which he does,--I never excuse myself. I do not think\nI should answer a word, if he called me the vilest thing on earth.\"\nBefore they parted for the night many questions were of course asked\nabout Nora, and Hugh described the condition in which he and she\nstood to each other. \"Papa has consented, then?\"\n\n\"Yes,--at four o'clock in the morning,--just as I was leaving them.\"\n\n\"And when is it to be?\"\n\n\"Nothing has been settled, and I do not as yet know where she will go\nto when they leave London. I think she will visit Monkhams when the\nGlascock people return to England.\"\n\n\"What an episode in life,--to go and see the place, when it might all\nnow have been hers!\"\n\n\"I suppose I ought to feel dreadfully ashamed of myself for having\nmarred such promotion,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Nora is such a singular girl;--so firm, so headstrong, so good, and\nso self-reliant that she will do as well with a poor man as she would\nhave done with a rich. Shall I confess to you that I did wish that\nshe should accept Mr. Glascock, and that I pressed it on her very\nstrongly? You will not be angry with me?\"\n\n\"I am only the more proud of her;--and of myself.\"\n\n\"When she was told of all that he had to give in the way of wealth\nand rank, she took the bit between her teeth and would not be turned\nan inch. Of course she was in love.\"\n\n\"I hope she may never regret it;--that is all.\"\n\n\"She must change her nature first. Everything she sees at Monkhams\nwill make her stronger in her choice. With all her girlish ways, she\nis like a rock;--nothing can move her.\"\n\nEarly on the next morning Hugh started alone for Casalunga, having\nfirst, however, seen Mrs. Trevelyan. He took out with him certain\nlittle things for the sick man's table;--as to which, however, he\nwas cautioned to say not a word to the sick man himself. And it was\narranged that he should endeavour to fix a day for Trevelyan's return\nto England. That was to be the one object in view. \"If we could get\nhim to England,\" she said, \"he and I would, at any rate, be together,\nand gradually he would be taught to submit himself to advice.\" Before\nten in the morning, Stanbury was walking up the hill to the house,\nand wondering at the dreary, hot, hopeless desolation of the spot.\nIt seemed to him that no one could live alone in such a place, in\nsuch weather, without being driven to madness. The soil was parched\nand dusty, as though no drop of rain had fallen there for months.\nThe lizards, glancing in and out of the broken walls, added to the\nappearance of heat. The vegetation itself was of a faded yellowish\ngreen, as though the glare of the sun had taken the fresh colour out\nof it. There was a noise of grasshoppers and a hum of flies in the\nair, hardly audible, but all giving evidence of the heat. Not a human\nvoice was to be heard, nor the sound of a human foot, and there was\nno shelter; but the sun blazed down full upon everything. He took\noff his hat, and rubbed his head with his handkerchief as he struck\nthe door with his stick. Oh God, to what misery had a little folly\nbrought two human beings who had had every blessing that the world\ncould give within their reach!\n\nIn a few minutes he was conducted through the house, and found\nTrevelyan seated in a chair under the verandah which looked down\nupon the olive trees. He did not even get up from his seat, but put\nout his left hand and welcomed his old friend. \"Stanbury,\" he said,\n\"I am glad to see you,--for auld lang syne's sake. When I found\nout this retreat, I did not mean to have friends round me here.\nI wanted to try what solitude was;--and, by heaven, I've tried\nit!\" He was dressed in a bright Italian dressing-gown or woollen\npaletot,--Italian, as having been bought in Italy, though, doubtless,\nit had come from France,--and on his feet he had green worked\nslippers, and on his head a brocaded cap. He had made but little\nother preparation for his friend in the way of dressing. His long\ndishevelled hair came down over his neck, and his beard covered his\nface. Beneath his dressing-gown he had on a night-shirt and drawers,\nand was as dirty in appearance as he was gaudy in colours. \"Sit\ndown and let us two moralise,\" he said. \"I spend my life here doing\nnothing,--nothing,--nothing; while you cudgel your brain from day\nto day to mislead the British public. Which of us two is taking the\nnearest road to the devil?\"\n\nStanbury seated himself in a second arm-chair, which there was there\nin the verandah, and looked as carefully as he dared to do at his\nfriend. There could be no mistake as to the restless gleam of that\neye. And then the affected air of ease, and the would-be cynicism,\nand the pretence of false motives, all told the same story. \"They\nused to tell us,\" said Stanbury, \"that idleness is the root of all\nevil.\"\n\n\"They have been telling us since the world began so many lies, that I\nfor one have determined never to believe anything again. Labour leads\nto greed, and greed to selfishness, and selfishness to treachery,\nand treachery straight to the devil,--straight to the devil. Ha, my\nfriend, all your leading articles won't lead you out of that. What's\nthe news? Who's alive? Who dead? Who in? Who out? What think you of\na man who has not seen a newspaper for two months; and who holds no\nconversation with the world further than is needed for the cooking of\nhis polenta and the cooling of his modest wine-flask?\"\n\n\"You see your wife sometimes,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"My wife! Now, my friend, let us drop that subject. Of all topics of\ntalk it is the most distressing to man in general, and I own that\nI am no exception to the lot. Wives, Stanbury, are an evil, more\nor less necessary to humanity, and I own to being one who has not\nescaped. The world must be populated, though for what reason one does\nnot see. I have helped,--to the extent of one male bantling; and if\nyou are one who consider population desirable, I will express my\nregret that I should have done no more.\"\n\nIt was very difficult to force Trevelyan out of this humour, and it\nwas not till Stanbury had risen apparently to take his leave that he\nfound it possible to say a word as to his mission there. \"Don't you\nthink you would be happier at home?\" he asked.\n\n\"Where is my home, Sir Knight of the midnight pen?\"\n\n\"England is your home, Trevelyan.\"\n\n\"No, sir; England was my home once; but I have taken the liberty\naccorded to me by my Creator of choosing a new country. Italy is now\nmy nation, and Casalunga is my home.\"\n\n\"Every tie you have in the world is in England.\"\n\n\"I have no tie, sir;--no tie anywhere. It has been my study to untie\nall the ties; and, by Jove, I have succeeded. Look at me here. I have\ngot rid of the trammels pretty well,--haven't I?--have unshackled\nmyself, and thrown off the paddings, and the wrappings, and the\nswaddling clothes. I have got rid of the conventionalities, and can\nlook Nature straight in the face. I don't even want the Daily Record,\nStanbury;--think of that!\"\n\nStanbury paced the length of the terrace, and then stopped for a\nmoment down under the blaze of the sun, in order that he might think\nhow to address this philosopher. \"Have you heard,\" he said at last,\n\"that I am going to marry your sister-in-law, Nora Rowley?\"\n\n\"Then there will be two more full-grown fools in the world certainly,\nand probably an infinity of young fools coming afterwards. Excuse me,\nStanbury, but this solitude is apt to make one plain-spoken.\"\n\n\"I got Sir Marmaduke's sanction the day before I left.\"\n\n\"Then you got the sanction of an illiterate, ignorant,\nself-sufficient, and most contemptible old man; and much good may it\ndo you.\"\n\n\"Let him be what he may, I was glad to have it. Most probably I shall\nnever see him again. He sails from Southampton for the Mandarins on\nthis day week.\"\n\n\"He does,--does he? May the devil sail along with him!--that is all I\nsay. And does my much-respected and ever-to-be-beloved mother-in-law\nsail with him?\"\n\n\"They all return together,--except Nora.\"\n\n\"Who remains to comfort you? I hope you may be comforted;--that is\nall. Don't be too particular. Let her choose her own friends, and go\nher own gait, and have her own way, and do you be blind and deaf and\ndumb and properly submissive; and it may be that she'll give you your\nbreakfast and dinner in your own house,--so long as your hours don't\ninterfere with her pleasures. If she should even urge you beside\nyourself by her vanity, folly, and disobedience,--so that at last you\nare driven to express your feeling,--no doubt she will come to you\nafter a while and tell you with the sweetest condescension that she\nforgives you. When she has been out of your house for a twelvemonth\nor more, she will offer to come back to you, and to forget\neverything,--on condition that you will do exactly as she bids you\nfor the future.\"\n\nThis attempt at satire, so fatuous, so plain, so false, together\nwith the would-be jaunty manner of the speaker, who, however, failed\nrepeatedly in his utterances from sheer physical exhaustion, was\nexcessively painful to Stanbury. What can one do at any time with a\nmadman? \"I mentioned my marriage,\" said he, \"to prove my right to\nhave an additional interest in your wife's happiness.\"\n\n\"You are quite welcome, whether you marry the other one or\nnot;--welcome to take any interest you please. I have got beyond all\nthat, Stanbury;--yes, by Jove, a long way beyond all that.\"\n\n\"You have not got beyond loving your wife, and your child,\nTrevelyan?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, yes;--I think I have. There may be a grain of weakness\nleft, you know. But what have you to do with my love for my wife?\"\n\n\"I was thinking more just now of her love for you. There she is at\nSiena. You cannot mean that she should remain there?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. What the deuce is there to keep her there?\"\n\n\"Come with her then to England.\"\n\n\"Why should I go to England with her? Because you bid me, or because\nshe wishes it,--or simply because England is the most damnable,\npuritanical, God-forgotten, and stupid country on the face of the\nglobe? I know no other reason for going to England. Will you take a\nglass of wine, Stanbury?\" Hugh declined the offer. \"You will excuse\nme,\" continued Trevelyan; \"I always take a glass of wine at this\nhour.\" Then he rose from his chair, and helped himself from a\ncupboard that was near at hand. Stanbury, watching him as he filled\nhis glass, could see that his legs were hardly strong enough to carry\nhim. And Stanbury saw, moreover, that the unfortunate man took two\nglasses out of the bottle. \"Go to England indeed. I do not think much\nof this country; but it is, at any rate, better than England.\"\n\nHugh perceived that he could do nothing more on the present occasion.\nHaving heard so much of Trevelyan's debility, he had been astonished\nto hear the man speak with so much volubility and attempts at\nhigh-flown spirit. Before he had taken the wine he had almost sunk\ninto his chair, but still he had continued to speak with the same\nfluent would-be cynicism. \"I will come and see you again,\" said Hugh,\ngetting up to take his departure.\n\n\"You might as well save your trouble, Stanbury; but you can come if\nyou please, you know. If you should find yourself locked out, you\nwon't be angry. A hermit such as I am must assume privileges.\"\n\n\"I won't be angry,\" said Hugh, good humouredly.\n\n\"I can smell what you are come about,\" said Trevelyan. \"You and my\nwife want to take me away from here among you, and I think it best to\nstay here. I don't want much for myself, and why should I not live\nhere? My wife can remain at Siena if she pleases, or she can go to\nEngland if she pleases. She must give me the same liberty;--the same\nliberty,--the same liberty.\" After this he fell a-coughing violently,\nand Stanbury thought it better to leave him. He had been at Casalunga\nabout two hours, and did not seem as yet to have done any good.\nHe had been astonished both by Trevelyan's weakness, and by his\nstrength; by his folly, and by his sharpness. Hitherto he could see\nno way for his future sister-in-law out of her troubles.\n\nWhen he was with her at Siena, he described what had taken place\nwith all the accuracy in his power. \"He has intermittent days,\"\nsaid Emily. \"To-morrow he will be in quite another frame of\nmind,--melancholy, silent perhaps, and self-reproachful. We will\nboth go to-morrow, and we shall find probably that he has forgotten\naltogether what has passed to-day between you and him.\"\n\nSo their plans for the morrow were formed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIII.\n\n\"SAY THAT YOU FORGIVE ME.\"\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nOn the following day, again early in the morning, Mrs. Trevelyan and\nStanbury were driven out to Casalunga. The country people along the\nroad knew the carriage well, and the lady who occupied it, and would\nsay that the English wife was going to see her mad husband. Mrs.\nTrevelyan knew that these words were common in the people's mouths,\nand explained to her companion how necessary it would be to use these\nrumours, to aid her in putting some restraint over her husband even\nin this country, should they fail in their effort to take him to\nEngland. She saw the doctor in Siena constantly, and had learned from\nhim how such steps might be taken. The measure proposed would be\nslow, difficult, inefficient, and very hard to set aside, if once\ntaken;--but still it might be indispensable that something should be\ndone. \"He would be so much worse off here than he would be at home,\"\nshe said;--\"if we could only make him understand that it would be\nso.\" Then Stanbury asked about the wine. It seemed that of late\nTrevelyan had taken to drink freely, but only of the wine of the\ncountry. But the wine of the country in these parts is sufficiently\nstimulating, and Mrs. Trevelyan acknowledged that hence had arisen a\nfurther cause of fear.\n\nThey walked up the hill together, and Mrs. Trevelyan, now well\nknowing the ways of the place, went round at once to the front\nterrace. There he was, seated in his arm-chair, dressed in the same\nway as yesterday, dirty, dishevelled, and gaudy with various colours;\nbut Stanbury could see at once that his mood had greatly changed. He\nrose slowly, dragging himself up out of his chair, as they came up to\nhim, but shewing as he did so,--and perhaps somewhat assuming,--the\nimpotency of querulous sickness. His wife went to him, and took him\nby the hand, and placed him back in his chair. He was weak, he said,\nand had not slept, and suffered from the heat; and then he begged her\nto give him wine. This she did, half filling for him a tumbler, of\nwhich he swallowed the contents greedily. \"You see me very poorly,\nStanbury,--very poorly,\" he said, seeming to ignore all that had\ntaken place on the previous day.\n\n\"You want change of climate, old fellow,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Change of everything;--I want change of everything,\" he said. \"If\nI could have a new body and a new mind, and a new soul!\"\n\n\"The mind and soul, dear, will do well enough, if you will let us\nlook after the body,\" said his wife, seating herself on a stool near\nhis feet. Stanbury, who had settled beforehand how he would conduct\nhimself, took out a cigar and lighted it;--and then they sat together\nsilent, or nearly silent, for half an hour. She had said that if Hugh\nwould do so, Trevelyan would soon become used to the presence of his\nold friend, and it seemed that he had already done so. More than\nonce, when he coughed, his wife fetched him some drink in a cup,\nwhich he took from her without a word. And Stanbury the while went on\nsmoking in silence.\n\n\"You have heard, Louis,\" she said at last, \"that, after all, Nora and\nMr. Stanbury are going to be married?\"\n\n\"Ah;--yes; I think I was told of it. I hope you may be happy,\nStanbury;--happier than I have been.\" This was unfortunate, but\nneither of the visitors winced, or said a word.\n\n\"It will be a pity that papa and mamma cannot be present at the\nwedding,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"If I had to do it again, I should not regret your father's absence;\nI must say that. He has been my enemy. Yes, Stanbury,--my enemy. I\ndon't care who hears me say so. I am obliged to stay here, because\nthat man would swear every shilling I have away from me if I were in\nEngland. He would strive to do so, and the struggle in my state of\nhealth would be too much for me.\"\n\n\"But Sir Marmaduke sails from Southampton this very week,\" said\nStanbury.\n\n\"I don't know. He is always sailing, and always coming back again. I\nnever asked him for a shilling in my life, and yet he has treated me\nas though I were his bitterest enemy.\"\n\n\"He will trouble you no more now, Louis,\" said Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\n\"He cannot trouble you again. He will have left England before you\ncan possibly reach it.\"\n\n\"He will have left other traitors behind him,--though none as bad as\nhimself,\" said Trevelyan.\n\nStanbury, when his cigar was finished, rose and left the husband and\nwife together on the terrace. There was little enough to be seen at\nCasalunga, but he strolled about looking at the place. He went into\nthe huge granary, and then down among the olive trees, and up into\nthe sheds which had been built for beasts. He stood and teased the\nlizards, and listened to the hum of the insects, and wiped away the\nperspiration which rose to his brow even as he was standing. And all\nthe while he was thinking what he would do next, or what say next,\nwith the view of getting Trevelyan away from the place. Hitherto he\nhad been very tender with him, contradicting him in nothing, taking\nfrom him good humouredly any absurd insult which he chose to offer,\npressing upon him none of the evil which he had himself occasioned,\nsaying to him no word that could hurt either his pride or his\ncomfort. But he could not see that this would be efficacious for the\npurpose desired. He had come thither to help Nora's sister in her\nterrible distress, and he must take upon himself to make some plan\nfor giving this aid. When he had thought of all this and made his\nplan, he sauntered back round the house on to the terrace. She was\nstill there, sitting at her husband's feet, and holding one of his\nhands in hers. It was well that the wife should be tender, but he\ndoubted whether tenderness would suffice.\n\n\"Trevelyan,\" he said, \"you know why I have come over here?\"\n\n\"I suppose she told you to come,\" said Trevelyan.\n\n\"Well; yes; she did tell me. I came to try and get you back to\nEngland. If you remain here, the climate and solitude together will\nkill you.\"\n\n\"As for the climate, I like it;--and as for solitude, I have got used\neven to that.\"\n\n\"And then there is another thing,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Trevelyan, starting.\n\n\"You are not safe here.\"\n\n\"How not safe?\"\n\n\"She could not tell you, but I must.\" His wife was still holding his\nhand, and he did not at once attempt to withdraw it; but he raised\nhimself in his chair, and fixed his eyes fiercely on Stanbury. \"They\nwill not let you remain here quietly,\" said Stanbury.\n\n\"Who will not?\"\n\n\"The Italians. They are already saying that you are not fit to be\nalone; and if once they get you into their hands,--under some Italian\nmedical board, perhaps into some Italian asylum, it might be years\nbefore you could get out,--if ever. I have come to tell you what the\ndanger is. I do not know whether you will believe me.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" he said, turning to his wife.\n\n\"I believe it is, Louis.\"\n\n\"And who has told them? Who has been putting them up to it?\" Now his\nhand had been withdrawn. \"My God, am I to be followed here too with\nsuch persecution as this?\"\n\n\"Nobody has told them,--but people have eyes.\"\n\n\"Liar, traitor, fiend!--it is you!\" he said, turning upon his wife.\n\n\"Louis, as I hope for mercy, I have said not a word to any one that\ncould injure you.\"\n\n\"Trevelyan, do not be so unjust, and so foolish,\" said Stanbury. \"It\nis not her doing. Do you suppose that you can live here like this\nand give rise to no remarks? Do you think that people's eyes are not\nopen, and that their tongues will not speak? I tell you, you are in\ndanger here.\"\n\n\"What am I to do? Where am I to go? Can not they let me stay till I\ndie? Whom am I hurting here? She may have all my money, if she wants\nit. She has got my child.\"\n\n\"I want nothing, Louis, but to take you where you may be safe and\nwell.\"\n\n\"Why are you afraid of going to England?\" Stanbury asked.\n\n\"Because they have threatened to put me--in a madhouse.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever thought of so treating you,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Your father did,--and your mother. They told me so.\"\n\n\"Look here, Trevelyan. Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley are gone. They\nwill have sailed, at least, before we can reach England. Whatever may\nhave been either their wishes or their power, they can do nothing\nnow. Here something would be done,--very soon; you may take my word\nfor that. If you will return with me and your wife, you shall choose\nyour own place of abode. Is not that so, Emily?\"\n\n\"He shall choose everything. His boy will be with him, and I will be\nwith him, and he shall be contradicted in nothing. If he only knew my\nheart towards him!\"\n\n\"You hear what she says, Trevelyan?\"\n\n\"Yes; I hear her.\"\n\n\"And you believe her?\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. Stanbury, how should you like to be locked\nup in a madhouse and grin through the bars till your heart was\nbroken? It would not take long with me, I know.\"\n\n\"You shall never be locked up;--never be touched,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I am very harmless here,\" he said, almost crying; \"very harmless. I\ndo not think anybody here will touch me,\" he added, afterwards. \"And\nthere are other places. There are other places. My God, that I should\nbe driven about the world like this!\" The conference was ended by his\nsaying that he would take two days to think of it, and by his then\ndesiring that they would both leave him. They did so, and descended\nthe hill together, knowing that he was watching them,--that he would\nwatch them till they were out of sight from the gate;--for, as Mrs.\nTrevelyan said, he never came down the hill now, knowing that the\nlabour of ascending it was too much for him. When they were at the\ncarriage they were met by one of the women of the house, and strict\ninjunctions were given to her by Mrs. Trevelyan to send on word\nto Siena if the Signore should prepare to move. \"He cannot go far\nwithout my knowing it,\" said she, \"because he draws his money in\nSiena, and lately I have taken to him what he wants. He has not\nenough with him for a long journey.\" For Stanbury had suggested that\nhe might be off to seek another residence in another country, and\nthat they would find Casalunga vacant when they reached it on the\nfollowing Tuesday. But he told himself almost immediately,--not\ncaring to express such an opinion to Emily,--that Trevelyan would\nhardly have strength even to prepare for such a journey by himself.\n\nOn the intervening day, the Monday, Stanbury had no occupation\nwhatever, and he thought that since he was born no day had ever been\nso long. Siena contains many monuments of interest, and much that is\nvaluable in art,--having had a school of painting of its own, and\nstill retaining in its public gallery specimens of its school, of\nwhich as a city it is justly proud. There are palaces there to be\nbeaten for gloomy majesty by none in Italy. There is a cathedral\nwhich was to have been the largest in the world, and than which few\nare more worthy of prolonged inspection. The town is old, and quaint,\nand picturesque, and dirty, and attractive,--as it becomes a town in\nItaly to be. But in July all such charms are thrown away. In July\nItaly is not a land of charms to an Englishman. Poor Stanbury did\nwander into the cathedral, and finding it the coolest place in the\ntown, went to sleep on a stone step. He was awoke by the voice of the\npriests as they began to chant the vespers. The good-natured Italians\nhad let him sleep, and would have let him sleep till the doors were\nclosed for the night. At five he dined with Mrs. Trevelyan, and then\nendeavoured to while away the evening thinking of Nora with a pipe in\nhis mouth. He was standing in this way at the hotel gateway, when, on\na sudden, all Siena was made alive by the clatter of an open carriage\nand four on its way through the town to the railway. On looking up,\nStanbury saw Lord Peterborough in the carriage,--with a lady whom\nhe did not doubt to be Lord Peterborough's wife. He himself had not\nbeen recognised, but he slowly followed the carriage to the railway\nstation. After the Italian fashion, the arrival was three-quarters\nof an hour before the proper time, and Stanbury had full opportunity\nof learning their news and telling his own. They were coming up from\nRome, and thought it preferable to take the route by Siena than to\nuse the railway through the Maremma; and they intended to reach\nFlorence that night.\n\n\"And do you think he is really mad?\" asked Lady Peterborough.\n\n\"He is undoubtedly so mad as to be unfit to manage anything for\nhimself, but he is not in such a condition that any one would wish to\nsee him put into confinement. If he were raving mad there would be\nless difficulty, though there might be more distress.\"\n\nA great deal was said about Nora, and both Lord Peterborough and his\nwife insisted that the marriage should take place at Monkhams. \"We\nshall be home now in less than three weeks,\" said Caroline, \"and she\nmust come to us at once. But I will write to her from Florence, and\ntell her how we saw you smoking your pipe under the archway. Not that\nmy husband knew you in the least.\"\n\n\"Upon my word no,\" said the husband,--\"one didn't expect to find you\nhere. Good-bye. I hope you may succeed in getting him home. I went\nto him once, but could do very little.\" Then the train started, and\nStanbury went back to Mrs. Trevelyan.\n\nOn the next day Stanbury went out to Casalunga alone. He had\ncalculated, on leaving England, that if any good might be done\nat Siena it could be done in three days, and that he would have\nbeen able to start on his return on the Wednesday morning,--or on\nWednesday evening at the latest. But now there did not seem to be any\nchance of that;--and he hardly knew how to guess when he might get\naway. He had sent a telegram to Lady Rowley after his first visit,\nin which he had simply said that things were not at all changed at\nCasalunga, and he had written to Nora each day since his arrival. His\nstay was prolonged at great expense and inconvenience to himself;\nand yet it was impossible that he should go and leave his work half\nfinished. As he walked up the hill to the house he felt very angry\nwith Trevelyan, and prepared himself to use hard words and dreadful\nthreats. But at the very moment of his entrance on the terrace,\nTrevelyan professed himself ready to go to England. \"That's right,\nold fellow,\" said Hugh. \"I am so glad.\" But in expressing his joy he\nhad hardly noticed Trevelyan's voice and appearance.\n\n\"I might as well go,\" he said. \"It matters little where I am, or\nwhether they say that I am mad or sane.\"\n\n\"When we have you over there, nobody shall say a word that is\ndisagreeable.\"\n\n\"I only hope that you may not have the trouble of burying me on the\nroad. You don't know, Stanbury, how ill I am. I cannot eat. If I\nwere at the bottom of that hill, I could no more walk up it than I\ncould fly. I cannot sleep, and at night my bed is wet through with\nperspiration. I can remember nothing,--nothing but what I ought to\nforget.\"\n\n\"We'll put you on to your legs again when we get you to your own\nclimate.\"\n\n\"I shall be a poor traveller,--a poor traveller; but I will do my\nbest.\"\n\nWhen would he start? That was the next question. Trevelyan asked for\na week, and Stanbury brought him down at last to three days. They\nwould go to Florence by the evening train on Friday, and sleep there.\nEmily should come out and assist him to arrange his things on the\nmorrow. Having finished so much of his business, Stanbury returned to\nSiena.\n\nThey both feared that he might be found on the next day to have\ndeparted from his intention; but no such idea seemed to have occurred\nto him. He gave instructions as to the notice to be served on the\nagent from the Hospital as to his house, and allowed Emily to go\namong his things and make preparations for the journey. He did not\nsay much to her; and when she attempted, with a soft half-uttered\nword, to assure him that the threat of Italian interference, which\nhad come from Stanbury, had not reached Stanbury from her, he simply\nshook his head sadly. She could not understand whether he did not\nbelieve her, or whether he simply wished that the subject should be\ndropped. She could elicit no sign of affection from him, nor would he\nwillingly accept such from her;--but he allowed her to prepare for\nthe journey, and never hinted that his purpose might again be liable\nto change. On the Friday, Emily with her child, and Hugh with all\ntheir baggage, travelled out on the road to Casalunga, thinking it\nbetter that there should be no halt in the town on their return.\nAt Casalunga, Hugh went up the hill with the driver, leaving Mrs.\nTrevelyan in the carriage. He had been out at the house before in the\nmorning, and had given all necessary orders;--but still at the last\nmoment he thought that there might be failure. But Trevelyan was\nready, having dressed himself up with a laced shirt, and changed his\ndressing-gown for a blue frock-coat, and his brocaded cap for a Paris\nhat, very pointed before and behind, and closely turned up at the\nsides. But Stanbury did not in the least care for his friend's dress.\n\"Take my arm,\" he said, \"and we will go down, fair and easy. Emily\nwould not come up because of the heat.\" He suffered himself to be\nled, or almost carried down the hill; and three women, and the\ncoachman, and an old countryman who worked on the farm, followed with\nthe luggage. It took about an hour and a half to pack the things; but\nat last they were all packed, and corded, and bound together with\nsticks, as though it were intended that they should travel in that\nform to Moscow. Trevelyan the meanwhile sat on a chair which had been\nbrought out for him from one of the cottages, and his wife stood\nbeside him with her boy. \"Now then we are ready,\" said Stanbury. And\nin that way they bade farewell to Casalunga. Trevelyan sat speechless\nin the carriage, and would not even notice the child. He seemed to be\nhalf dreaming and to fix his eyes on vacancy. \"He appears to think of\nnothing now,\" Emily said that evening to Stanbury. But who can tell\nhow busy and how troubled are the thoughts of a madman!\n\nThey had now succeeded in their object of inducing their patient to\nreturn with them to England; but what were they to do with him when\nthey had reached home with him? They rested only a night at Florence;\nbut they found their fellow-traveller so weary, that they were unable\nto get beyond Bologna on the second day. Many questions were asked\nof him as to where he himself would wish to take up his residence in\nEngland; but it was found almost impossible to get an answer. Once\nhe suggested that he would like to go back to Mrs. Fuller's cottage\nat Willesden, from whence they concluded that he would wish to live\nsomewhere out of London. On his first day's journey, he was moody\nand silent,--wilfully assuming the airs of a much-injured person. He\nspoke hardly at all, and would notice nothing that was said to him by\nhis wife. He declared once that he regarded Stanbury as his keeper,\nand endeavoured to be disagreeable and sullenly combative; but on\nthe second day, he was too weak for this, and accepted, without\nremonstrance, the attentions that were paid to him. At Bologna they\nrested a day, and from thence both Stanbury and Mrs. Trevelyan wrote\nto Nora. They did not know where she might be now staying, but the\nletters, by agreement, were addressed to Gregg's Hotel. It was\nsuggested that lodgings, or, if possible, a small furnished house,\nshould be taken in the neighbourhood of Mortlake, Richmond, or\nTeddington, and that a telegram as well as a letter should be sent to\nthem at the Paris hotel. As they could not travel quick, there might\nbe time enough for them in this way to know whither they should go on\ntheir reaching London.\n\nThey stayed a day at Bologna, and then they went on again,--to Turin,\nover the mountains to Chambery, thence to Dijon, and on to Paris. At\nChambery they remained a couple of days, fancying that the air there\nwas cool, and that the delay would be salutary to the sick man. At\nTurin, finding that they wanted further assistance, they had hired\na courier, and at last Trevelyan allowed himself to be carried in\nand out of the carriages and up and down the hotel stairs almost as\nthough he were a child. The delay was terribly grievous to Stanbury,\nand Mrs. Trevelyan, perceiving this more than once, begged him to\nleave them, and to allow her to finish the journey with the aid\nof the courier. But this he could not do. He wrote letters to\nhis friends at the D. R. office, explaining his position as well\nas he could, and suggesting that this and that able assistant\nshould enlighten the British people on this and that subject,\nwhich would,--in the course of nature, as arranged at the D. R.\noffice,--have fallen into his hands. He and Mrs. Trevelyan became\nas brother and sister to each other on their way home,--as, indeed,\nit was natural that they should do. Were they doing right or wrong\nin this journey that they were taking? They could not conceal from\nthemselves that the labour was almost more than the poor wretch could\nendure; and that it might be, as he himself had suggested, that they\nwould be called on to bury him on the road. But that residence at\nCasalunga had been so terrible,--the circumstances of it, including\nthe solitude, sickness, madness, and habits of life of the wretched\nhermit, had been so dangerous,--the probability of interference on\nthe part of some native authority so great, and the chance of the\nhouse being left in Trevelyan's possession so small, that it had\nseemed to him that they had no other alternative; and yet, how would\nit be if they were killing him by the toil of travelling? From\nChambery, they made the journey to Paris in two days, and during that\ntime Trevelyan hardly opened his mouth. He slept much, and ate better\nthan he had done in the hotter climate on the other side of the Alps.\n\nThey found a telegram at Paris, which simply contained the promise\nof a letter for the next day. It had been sent by Nora, before she\nhad gone out on her search. But it contained one morsel of strange\ninformation; \"Lady Milborough is going with me.\" On the next day\nthey got a letter, saying that a cottage had been taken, furnished,\nbetween Richmond and Twickenham. Lady Milborough had known of the\ncottage, and everything would be ready then. Nora would herself meet\nthem at the station in London, if they would, as she proposed, stay\na night at Dover. They were to address to her at Lady Milborough's\nhouse, in Eccleston Square. In that case, she would have a carriage\nfor them at the Victoria Station, and would go down with them at once\nto the cottage.\n\nThere were to be two days more of weary travelling, and then they\nwere to be at home again. She and he would have a house together as\nhusband and wife, and the curse of their separation would, at any\nrate, be over. Her mind towards him had changed altogether since\nthe days in which she had been so indignant, because he had set a\npoliceman to watch over her. All feeling of anger was over with her\nnow. There is nothing that a woman will not forgive a man, when he is\nweaker than she is herself.\n\nThe journey was made first to Dover, and then to London. Once, as\nthey were making their way through the Kentish hop-fields, he put\nout his hand feebly, and touched hers. They had the carriage to\nthemselves, and she was down on her knees before him instantly. \"Oh,\nLouis! Oh, Louis! say that you forgive me!\" What could a woman do\nmore than that in her mercy to a man?\n\n\"Yes;--yes; yes,\" he said; \"but do not talk now; I am so tired.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIV.\n\nA REAL CHRISTIAN.\n\n\nIn the meantime the Rowleys were gone. On the Monday after the\ndeparture of Stanbury for Italy, Lady Rowley had begun to look the\ndifficulty about Nora in the face, and to feel that she must do\nsomething towards providing the poor girl with a temporary home.\nEverybody had now agreed that she was to marry Hugh Stanbury as soon\nas Hugh Stanbury could be ready, and it was not to be thought of that\nshe should be left out in the world as one in disgrace or under a\ncloud. But what was to be done? Sir Marmaduke was quite incapable of\nsuggesting anything. He would make her an allowance, and leave her a\nsmall sum of ready money;--but as to residence, he could only suggest\nagain and again that she should be sent to Mrs. Outhouse. Now Lady\nRowley was herself not very fond of Mrs. Outhouse, and she was aware\nthat Nora herself was almost as averse to St. Diddulph's as she was\nto the Mandarins. Nora already knew that she had the game in her\nown hands. Once when in her presence her father suggested the near\nrelationship and prudent character and intense respectability of Mrs.\nOuthouse, Nora, who was sitting behind Sir Marmaduke, shook her head\nat her mother, and Lady Rowley knew that Nora would not go to St.\nDiddulph's. This was the last occasion on which that proposition was\ndiscussed.\n\nThroughout all the Trevelyan troubles Lady Milborough had continued\nto shew a friendly anxiety on behalf of Emily Trevelyan. She had\ncalled once or twice on Lady Rowley, and Lady Rowley had of course\nreturned the visits. She had been forward in expressing her belief\nthat in truth the wife had been but little if at all to blame,\nand had won her way with Lady Rowley, though she had never been\na favourite with either of Lady Rowley's daughters. Now, in her\ndifficulty, Lady Rowley went to Lady Milborough, and returned with\nan invitation that Nora should come to Eccleston Square, either till\nsuch time as she might think fit to go to Monkhams, or till Mrs.\nTrevelyan should have returned, and should be desirous of having her\nsister with her. When Nora first heard of this she almost screamed\nwith surprise, and, if the truth must be told, with disappointment\nalso.\n\n\"She never liked me, mamma.\"\n\n\"Then she is so much more good-natured.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to go to her merely because she is good-natured\nenough to receive a person she dislikes. I know she is very good. I\nknow she would sacrifice herself for anything she thought right. But,\nmamma, she is such a bore!\"\n\nBut Lady Rowley would not be talked down, even by Nora, in this\nfashion. Nora was somewhat touched with an idea that it would be a\nfine independent thing to live alone, if it were only for a week or\ntwo, just because other young ladies never lived alone. Perhaps there\nwas some half-formed notion in her mind that permission to do so was\npart of the reward due to her for having refused to marry a lord.\nStanbury was in some respects a Bohemian, and it would become her,\nshe thought, to have a little practice herself in the Bohemian\nline. She had, indeed, declined a Bohemian marriage, feeling\nstrongly averse to encounter the loud displeasure of her father and\nmother;--but as long as everything was quite proper, as long as there\nshould be no running away, or subjection of her name to scandal, she\nconsidered that a little independence would be useful and agreeable.\nShe had looked forward to sitting up at night alone by a single\ntallow candle, to stretching a beefsteak so as to last her for two\ndays' dinners, and perhaps to making her own bed. Now, there would\nnot be the slightest touch of romance in a visit to Lady Milborough's\nhouse in Eccleston Square, at the end of July. Lady Rowley, however,\nwas of a different opinion, and spoke her mind plainly. \"Nora, my\ndear, don't be a fool. A young lady like you can't go and live in\nlodgings by herself. All manner of things would be said. And this is\nsuch a very kind offer! You must accept it,--for Hugh's sake. I have\nalready said that you would accept it.\"\n\n\"But she will be going out of town.\"\n\n\"She will stay till you can go to Monkhams,--if Emily is not back\nbefore then. She knows all about Emily's affairs; and if she does\ncome back,--which I doubt, poor thing,--Lady Milborough and you will\nbe able to judge whether you should go to her.\" So it was settled,\nand Nora's Bohemian Castle in the Air fell into shatters.\n\nThe few remaining days before the departure to Southampton passed\nquickly, but yet sadly. Sir Marmaduke had come to England expecting\npleasure,--and with that undefined idea which men so employed always\nhave on their return home that something will turn up which will make\ntheir going back to that same banishment unnecessary. What Governor\nof Hong-Kong, what Minister to Bogota, what General of the Forces\nat the Gold Coast, ever left the scene of his official or military\nlabours without a hope, which was almost an expectation, that a\ngrateful country would do something better for him before the period\nof his return should have arrived? But a grateful country was doing\nnothing better for Sir Marmaduke, and an ungrateful Secretary of\nState at the Colonial Office would not extend the term during which\nhe could regard himself as absent on special service. How thankful he\nhad been when first the tidings reached him that he was to come home\nat the expense of the Crown, and without diminution of his official\nincome! He had now been in England for five months, with a per diem\nallowance, with his very cabs paid for him, and he was discontented,\nsullen, and with nothing to comfort him but his official grievance,\nbecause he could not be allowed to extend his period of special\nservice more than two months beyond the time at which those special\nservices were in truth ended! There had been a change of Ministry in\nthe last month, and he had thought that a Conservative Secretary of\nState would have been kinder to him. \"The Duke says I can stay three\nmonths with leave of absence;--and have half my pay stopped. I wonder\nwhether it ever enters into his august mind that even a Colonial\nGovernor must eat and drink.\" It was thus he expressed his great\ngrievance to his wife. \"The Duke,\" however, had been as inexorable\nas his predecessor, and Sir Rowley, with his large family, was too\nwise to remain to the detriment of his pocket. In the meantime the\nclerks in the office, who had groaned in spirit over the ignorance\ndisplayed in his evidence before the committee, were whispering\namong themselves that he ought not to be sent back to his seat of\ngovernment at all.\n\nLady Rowley also was disappointed and unhappy. She had expected so\nmuch pleasure from her visit to her daughter, and she had received so\nlittle! Emily's condition was very sad, but in her heart of hearts\nperhaps she groaned more bitterly over all that Nora had lost, than\nshe did over the real sorrows of her elder child. To have had the cup\nat her lip, and then not to have tasted it! And she had the solace of\nno communion in this sorrow. She had accepted Hugh Stanbury as her\nson-in-law, and not for worlds would she now say a word against him\nto any one. She had already taken him to her heart, and she loved\nhim. But to have had it almost within her grasp to have had a lord,\nthe owner of Monkhams, for her son-in-law! Poor Lady Rowley!\n\nSophie and Lucy, too, were returning to their distant and dull\nbanishment without any realisation of their probable but unexpressed\nambition. They made no complaint, but yet it was hard on them\nthat their sister's misfortune should have prevented them from\ngoing,--almost to a single dance. Poor Sophie and poor Lucy! They\nmust go, and we shall hear no more about them. It was thought well\nthat Nora should not go down with them to Southampton. What good\nwould her going do? \"God bless you, my darling,\" said the mother, as\nshe held her child in her arms.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear mamma.\"\n\n\"Give my best love to Hugh, and tell him that I pray him with my\nlast word to be good to you.\" Even then she was thinking of Lord\nPeterborough, but the memory of what might have been was buried deep\nin her mind.\n\n\"Nora, tell me all about it,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"There will be nothing to tell,\" said Nora.\n\n\"Tell it all the same,\" said Lucy. \"And bring Hugh out to write a\nbook of travels about the Mandarins. Nobody has ever written a book\nabout the Mandarins.\" So they parted; and when Sir Marmaduke and his\nparty were taken off in two cabs to the Waterloo Station, Nora was\ntaken in one cab to Eccleston Square.\n\nIt may be doubted whether any old lady since the world began ever did\na more thoroughly Christian and friendly act than this which was now\nbeing done by Lady Milborough. It was the end of July, and she would\nalready have been down in Dorsetshire, but for her devotion to this\ngood deed. For, in truth, what she was doing was not occasioned by\nany express love for Nora Rowley. Nora Rowley was all very well, but\nNora Rowley towards her had been flippant, impatient, and, indeed,\nnot always so civil as a young lady should be to the elderly friends\nof her married sister. But to Lady Milborough it had seemed to be\nquite terrible that a young girl should be left alone in the world,\nwithout anybody to take care of her. Young ladies, according to her\nviews of life, were fragile plants that wanted much nursing before\nthey could be allowed to be planted out in the gardens of the\nworld as married women. When she heard from Lady Rowley that Nora\nwas engaged to marry Hugh Stanbury,--\"You know all about Lord\nPeterborough, Lady Milborough; but it is no use going back to that\nnow,--is it? And Mr. Stanbury has behaved so exceedingly well\nin regard to poor Louis,\"--when Lady Milborough heard this, and\nheard also that Nora was talking of going to live by herself--in\nlodgings--she swore to herself, like a goodly Christian woman, as\nshe was, that such a thing must not be. Eccleston Square in July\nand August is not pleasant, unless it be to an inhabitant who\nis interested in the fag-end of the parliamentary session. Lady\nMilborough had no interest in politics,--had not much interest even\nin seeing the social season out to its dregs. She ordinarily remained\nin London till the beginning or middle of July, because the people\nwith whom she lived were in the habit of doing so;--but as soon as\never she had fixed the date of her departure, that day to her was\na day of release. On this occasion the day had been fixed,--and it\nwas unfixed, and changed, and postponed, because it was manifest\nto Lady Milborough that she could do good by remaining for another\nfortnight. When she made the offer she said nothing of her previous\narrangements. \"Lady Rowley, let her come to me. As soon as her friend\nLady Peterborough is at Monkhams, she can go there.\"\n\nThus it was that Nora found herself established in Eccleston Square.\nAs she took her place in Lady Milborough's drawing-rooms, she\nremembered well a certain day, now two years ago, when she had first\nheard of the glories of Monkhams in that very house. Lady Milborough,\nas good-natured then as she was now, had brought Mr. Glascock and\nNora together, simply because she had heard that the gentleman\nadmired the young lady. Nora, in her pride, had resented this as\ninterference,--had felt that the thing had been done, and, though she\nhad valued the admiration of the man, had ridiculed the action of the\nwoman. As she thought of it now she was softened by gratitude. She\nhad not on that occasion been suited with a husband, but she had\ngained a friend. \"My dear,\" said Lady Milborough, as at her request\nNora took off her hat, \"I am afraid that the parties are mostly\nover,--that is, those I go to; but we will drive out every day, and\nthe time won't be so very long.\"\n\n\"It won't be long for me, Lady Milborough;--but I cannot but know how\nterribly I am putting you out.\"\n\n\"I am never put out, Miss Rowley,\" said the old lady, \"as long as I\nam made to think that what I do is taken in good part.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed it shall be taken in good part,\" said Nora,--\"indeed\nit shall.\" And she swore a solemn silent vow of friendship for the\ndear old woman.\n\nThen there came letters and telegrams from Chambery, Dijon, and\nParis, and the joint expedition in search of the cottage was made\nto Twickenham. It was astonishing how enthusiastic and how loving\nthe elder and the younger lady were together before the party from\nItaly had arrived in England. Nora had explained everything about\nherself,--how impossible it had been for her not to love Hugh\nStanbury; how essential it had been for her happiness and self-esteem\nthat she should refuse Mr. Glascock; how terrible had been the\ntragedy of her sister's marriage. Lady Milborough spoke of the former\nsubject with none of Lady Rowley's enthusiasm, but still with an\nevident partiality for her own rank, which almost aroused Nora to\nindignant eloquence. Lady Milborough was contented to acknowledge\nthat Nora might be right, seeing that her heart was so firmly fixed;\nbut she was clearly of opinion that Mr. Glascock, being Mr. Glascock,\nhad possessed a better right to the prize in question than could\nhave belonged to any man who had no recognised position in the world.\nSeeing that her heart had been given away, Nora was no doubt right\nnot to separate her hand from her heart; but Lady Milborough was of\nopinion that young ladies ought to have their hearts under better\ncontrol, so that the men entitled to the prizes should get them. It\nwas for the welfare of England at large that the eldest sons of good\nfamilies should marry the sweetest, prettiest, brightest, and most\nlovable girls of their age. It is a doctrine on behalf of which very\nmuch may be said.\n\nOn that other matter, touching Emily Trevelyan, Lady Milborough\nfrankly owned that she had seen early in the day that he was the one\nmost in fault. \"I must say, my dear,\" she said, \"that I very greatly\ndislike your friend, Colonel Osborne.\"\n\n\"I am sure that he meant not the slightest harm,--no more than she\ndid.\"\n\n\"He was old enough, and ought to have known better. And when the\nfirst hint of an uneasiness in the mind of Louis was suggested to\nhim, his feelings as a gentleman should have prompted him to remove\nhimself. Let the suspicion have been ever so absurd, he should\nhave removed himself. Instead of that, he went after her,--into\nDevonshire.\"\n\n\"He went to see other friends, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"I hope it may have been so;--I hope it may have been so. But he\nshould have cut off his hand before he rang at the door of the house\nin which she was living. You will understand, my dear, that I acquit\nyour sister altogether. I did so all through, and said the same to\npoor Louis when he came to me. But Colonel Osborne should have known\nbetter. Why did he write to her? Why did he go to St. Diddulph's? Why\ndid he let it be thought that,--that she was especially his friend.\nOh dear; oh dear; oh dear! I am afraid he is a very bad man.\"\n\n\"We had known him so long, Lady Milborough.\"\n\n\"I wish you had never known him at all. Poor Louis! If he had only\ndone what I told him at first, all might have been well. 'Go to\nNaples, with your wife,' I said. 'Go to Naples.' If he had gone to\nNaples, there would have been no journeys to Siena, no living at\nCasalunga, no separation. But he didn't seem to see it in the same\nlight. Poor dear Louis. I wish he had gone to Naples when I told\nhim.\"\n\nWhile they were going backwards and forwards, looking at the cottage\nat Twickenham and trying to make things comfortable there for the\nsick man, Lady Milborough hinted to Nora that it might be distasteful\nto Trevelyan, in his present condition, to have even a sister-in-law\nstaying in the house with him. There was a little chamber which Nora\nhad appropriated to herself, and at first it seemed to be taken\nfor granted that she should remain there at least till the 10th of\nAugust, on which day Lady Peterborough had signified that she and her\nhusband would be ready to receive their visitor. But Lady Milborough\nslept on the suggestion, and on the next morning hinted her\ndisapprobation. \"You shall take them down in the carriage, and their\nluggage can follow in a cab;--but the carriage can bring you back.\nYou will see how things are then.\"\n\n\"Dear Lady Milborough, you would go out of town at once if I left\nyou.\"\n\n\"And I shall not go out of town if you don't leave me. What\ndifference does it make to an old woman like me? I have got no\nlover coming to look for me, and all I have to do is to tell my\ndaughter-in-law that I shall not be there for another week or so.\nAugusta is very glad to have me, but she is the wisest woman in the\nworld, and can get on very well without me.\"\n\n\"And as I am the silliest, I cannot.\"\n\n\"You shall put it in that way if you like it, my dear. Girls in your\nposition often do want assistance. I dare say you think me very\nstraight-laced, but I am quite sure Mr. Stanbury will be grateful to\nme. As you are to be married from Monkhams, it will be quite well\nthat you should pass thither through my house as an intermediate\nresting-place, after leaving your father and mother.\" By all which\nLady Milborough intended to express an opinion that the value of\nthe article which Hugh Stanbury would receive at the altar would be\nenhanced by the distinguished purity of the hands through which it\nhad passed before it came into his possession;--in which opinion she\nwas probably right as regarded the price put upon the article by\nthe world at large, though it may perhaps be doubted whether the\nrecipient himself would be of the same opinion.\n\n\"I hope you know that I am grateful, whatever he may be,\" said Nora,\nafter a pause.\n\n\"I think that you take it as it is meant, and that makes me quite\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Lady Milborough, I shall love you for ever and ever. I don't think I\never knew anybody so good as you are,--or so nice.\"\n\n\"Then I shall be more than comfortable,\" said Lady Milborough. After\nthat there was an embrace, and the thing was settled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCV.\n\nTREVELYAN BACK IN ENGLAND.\n\n\nNora, with Lady Milborough's carriage, and Lady Milborough's coach\nand footman, and with a cab ready for the luggage close behind the\ncarriage, was waiting at the railway station when the party from\nDover arrived. She soon saw Hugh upon the platform, and ran to\nhim with her news. They had not a word to say to each other of\nthemselves, so anxious were they both respecting Trevelyan. \"We got a\nbed-carriage for him at Dover,\" said Hugh; \"and I think he has borne\nthe journey pretty well;--but he feels the heat almost as badly as\nin Italy. You will hardly know him when you see him.\" Then, when the\nrush of passengers was gone, Trevelyan was brought out by Hugh and\nthe courier, and placed in Lady Milborough's carriage. He just smiled\nas his eye fell upon Nora, but he did not even put out his hand to\ngreet her.\n\n\"I am to go in the carriage with him,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Of course you are,--and so will I and Louey. I think there will be\nroom: it is so large. There is a cab for all the things. Dear Emily,\nI am so glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Dearest Nora! I shall be able to speak to you by-and-by, but you\nmust not be angry with me now. How good you have been.\"\n\n\"Has not she been good? I don't understand about the cottage. It\nbelongs to some friend of hers; and I have not been able to say a\nword about the rent. It is so nice;--and looks upon the river. I hope\nthat he will like it.\"\n\n\"You will be with us?\"\n\n\"Not just at first. Lady Milborough thinks I had better not,--that he\nwill like it better. I will come down almost every day, and will stay\nif you think he will like it.\"\n\nThese few words were said while the men were putting Trevelyan\ninto the carriage. And then another arrangement was made. Hugh\nhired a second cab, in which he and the courier made a part of the\nprocession; and so they all went to Twickenham together. Hugh had not\nyet learned that he would be rewarded by coming back alone with Nora\nin the carriage.\n\nThe cottage by the River Thames, which, as far as the party knew, was\nnameless, was certainly very much better than the house on the top of\nthe hill at Casalunga. And now, at last, the wife would sleep once\nmore under the same roof with her husband, and the separation would\nbe over. \"I suppose that is the Thames,\" said Trevelyan; and they\nwere nearly the only words he spoke in Nora's hearing that evening.\nBefore she started on her return journey, the two sisters were\ntogether for a few minutes, and each told her own budget of news in\nshort, broken fragments. There was not much to tell. \"He is so weak,\"\nsaid Mrs. Trevelyan, \"that he can do literally nothing. He can hardly\nspeak. When we give him wine, he will say a few words, and his mind\nseems then to be less astray than it was. I have told him just simply\nthat it was all my doing,--that I have been in fault all through, and\nevery now and then he will say a word, to shew me that he remembers\nthat I have confessed.\"\n\n\"My poor Emily!\"\n\n\"It was better so. What does it all matter? He had suffered so, that\nI would have said worse than that to give him relief. The pride has\ngone out of me so, that I do not regard what anybody may say. Of\ncourse, it will be said that I--went astray, and that he forgave me.\"\n\n\"Nobody will say that, dearest; nobody. Lady Milborough is quite\naware how it all was.\"\n\n\"What does it signify? There are things in life worse even than a bad\nname.\"\n\n\"But he does not think it?\"\n\n\"Nora, his mind is a mystery to me. I do not know what is in it.\nSometimes I fancy that all facts have been forgotten, and that he\nmerely wants the childish gratification of being assured that he is\nthe master. Then, again, there come moments, in which I feel sure\nthat suspicion is lurking within him, that he is remembering the\npast, and guarding against the future. When he came into this house,\na quarter of an hour ago, he was fearful lest there was a mad doctor\nlurking about to pounce on him. I can see in his eye that he had some\nsuch idea. He hardly notices Louey,--though there was a time, even at\nCasalunga, when he would not let the child out of his sight.\"\n\n\"What will you do now?\"\n\n\"I will try to do my duty;--that is all.\"\n\n\"But you will have a doctor?\"\n\n\"Of course. He was content to see one in Paris, though he would not\nlet me be present. Hugh saw the gentleman afterwards, and he seemed\nto think that the body was worse than the mind.\" Then Nora told her\nthe name of a doctor whom Lady Milborough had suggested, and took her\ndeparture along with Hugh in the carriage.\n\nIn spite of all the sorrow that they had witnessed and just left,\ntheir journey up to London was very pleasant. Perhaps there is no\nperiod so pleasant among all the pleasant periods of love-making as\nthat in which the intimacy between the lovers is so assured, and the\ncoming event so near, as to produce and to endure conversation about\nthe ordinary little matters of life;--what can be done with the\nlimited means at their mutual disposal; how that life shall be begun\nwhich they are to lead together; what idea each has of the other's\nduties; what each can do for the other; what each will renounce for\nthe other. There was a true sense of the delight of intimacy in the\ngirl who declared that she had never loved her lover so well as when\nshe told him how many pairs of stockings she had got. It is very\nsweet to gaze at the stars together; and it is sweet to sit out\namong the haycocks. The reading of poetry together, out of the same\nbook, with brows all close, and arms all mingled, is very sweet. The\npouring out of the whole heart in written words, which the writer\nknows would be held to be ridiculous by any eyes, and any ears, and\nany sense, but the eyes and ears and sense of the dear one to whom\nthey are sent, is very sweet;--but for the girl who has made a shirt\nfor the man that she loves, there has come a moment in the last\nstitch of it, sweeter than any that stars, haycocks, poetry, or\nsuperlative epithets have produced. Nora Rowley had never as yet\nbeen thus useful on behalf of Hugh Stanbury. Had she done so, she\nmight perhaps have been happier even than she was during this\njourney;--but, without the shirt, it was one of the happiest moments\nof her life. There was nothing now to separate them but their own\nprudential scruples;--and of them it must be acknowledged that Hugh\nStanbury had very few. According to his shewing, he was as well\nprovided for matrimony as the gentleman in the song, who came out\nto woo his bride on a rainy night. In live stock he was not so well\nprovided as the Irish gentleman to whom we allude; but in regard to\nall other provisions for comfortable married life, he had, or at a\nmoment's notice could have, all that was needed. Nora could live just\nwhere she pleased;--not exactly in Whitehall Gardens or Belgrave\nSquare; but the New Road, Lupus Street, Montague Place, the North\nBank, or Kennington Oval, with all their surrounding crescents,\nterraces, and rows, offered, according to him, a choice so wide,\neither for lodgings or small houses, that their only embarrassment\nwas in their riches. He had already insured his life for a thousand\npounds, and, after paying yearly for that, and providing a certain\nsurplus for saving, five hundred a year was the income on which they\nwere to commence the world. \"Of course, I wish it were five thousand\nfor your sake,\" he said; \"and I wish I were a Cabinet Minister, or a\nduke, or a brewer; but, even in heaven, you know all the angels can't\nbe archangels.\" Nora assured him that she would be quite content with\nvirtues simply angelic. \"I hope you like mutton-chops and potatoes; I\ndo,\" he said. Then she told him of her ambition about the beef-steak,\nacknowledging that, as it must now be shared between two, the\nglorious idea of putting a part of it away in a cupboard must be\nabandoned. \"I don't believe in beef-steaks,\" he said. \"A beef-steak\nmay mean anything. At our club, a beef-steak is a sumptuous and\nexpensive luxury. Now, a mutton-chop means something definite, and\nmust be economical.\"\n\n\"Then we will have the mutton-chops at home,\" said Nora, \"and you\nshall go to your club for the beef-steak.\"\n\nWhen they reached Eccleston Square, Nora insisted on taking Hugh\nStanbury up to Lady Milborough. It was in vain that he pleaded that\nhe had come all the way from Dover on a very dusty day,--all the way\nfrom Dover, including a journey in a Hansom cab to Twickenham and\nback, without washing his hands and face. Nora insisted that Lady\nMilborough was such a dear, good, considerate creature, that she\nwould understand all that, and Hugh was taken into her presence. \"I\nam delighted to see you, Mr. Stanbury,\" said the old lady, \"and hope\nyou will think that Nora is in good keeping.\"\n\n\"She has been telling me how very kind you have been to her. I do not\nknow where she could have bestowed herself if you had not received\nher.\"\n\n\"There, Nora;--I told you he would say so. I won't tell tales, Mr.\nStanbury; but she had all manner of wild plans which I knew you\nwouldn't approve. But she is very amiable, and if she will only\nsubmit to you as well as she does to me--\"\n\n\"I don't mean to submit to him at all, Lady Milborough;--of course\nnot. I am going to marry for liberty.\"\n\n\"My dear, what you say, you say in joke; but a great many young women\nof the present day do, I really believe, go up to the altar and\npronounce their marriage vows, with the simple idea that as soon as\nthey have done so, they are to have their own way in everything. And\nthen people complain that young men won't marry! Who can wonder at\nit?\"\n\n\"I don't think the young men think much about the obedience,\" said\nNora. \"Some marry for money, and some for love. But I don't think\nthey marry to get a slave.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Mr. Stanbury?\" asked the old lady.\n\n\"I can only assure you that I shan't marry for money,\" said he.\n\nTwo or three days after this Nora left her friend in Eccleston\nSquare, and domesticated herself for awhile with her sister. Mrs.\nTrevelyan declared that such an arrangement would be comfortable\nfor her, and that it was very desirable now, as Nora would so soon\nbe beyond her reach. Then Lady Milborough was enabled to go to\nDorsetshire, which she did not do, however, till she had presented\nNora with the veil which she was to wear on the occasion of her\nwedding. \"Of course I cannot see it, my dear, as it is to take place\nat Monkhams; but you must write and tell me the day;--and I will\nthink of you. And you, when you put on the veil, must think of me.\"\nSo they parted, and Nora knew that she had made a friend for life.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Nora's veil.]\n\n\nWhen she first took her place in the house at Twickenham as a\nresident, Trevelyan did not take much notice of her;--but, after\nawhile, he would say a few words to her, especially when it might\nchance that she was with him in her sister's absence. He would speak\nof dear Emily, and poor Emily, and shake his head slowly, and talk of\nthe pity of it. \"The pity of it, Iago; oh, the pity of it,\" he said\nonce. The allusion to her was so terrible that she almost burst out\nin anger, as she would have done formerly. She almost told him that\nhe had been as wrong throughout as was the jealous husband in the\nplay whose words he quoted, and that his jealousy, if continued, was\nlikely to be as tragical. But she restrained herself, and kept close\nto her needle,--making, let us hope, an auspicious garment for Hugh\nStanbury. \"She has seen it now,\" he continued; \"she has seen it now.\"\nStill she went on with her hemming in silence. It certainly could not\nbe her duty to upset at a word all that her sister had achieved. \"You\nknow that she has confessed?\" he asked.\n\n\"Pray, pray do not talk about it, Louis.\"\n\n\"I think you ought to know,\" he said. Then she rose from her seat and\nleft the room. She could not stand it, even though he were mad,--even\nthough he were dying!\n\nShe went to her sister and repeated what had been said. \"You had\nbetter not notice it,\" said Emily. \"It is only a proof of what I told\nyou. There are times in which his mind is as active as ever it was,\nbut it is active in so terrible a direction!\"\n\n\"I cannot sit and hear it. And what am I to say when he asks me a\nquestion as he did just now? He said that you had confessed.\"\n\n\"So I have. Do none confess but the guilty? What is all that we have\nread about the Inquisition and the old tortures? I have had to learn\nthat torturing has not gone out of the world;--that is all.\"\n\n\"I must go away if he says the same thing to me so again.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, Nora. If I can bear it, cannot you? Would you have\nme drive him into violence again by disputing with him upon such a\nsubject?\"\n\n\"But he may recover;--and then he will remember what you have said.\"\n\n\"If he recovers altogether he will suspect nothing. I must take my\nchance of that. You cannot suppose that I have not thought about it.\nI have often sworn to myself that though the world should fall around\nme, nothing should make me acknowledge that I had ever been untrue\nto my duty as a married woman, either in deed, or word, or thought.\nI have no doubt that the poor wretches who were tortured in their\ncells used to make the same resolutions as to their confessions. But\nyet, when their nails were dragged out of them, they would own to\nanything. My nails have been dragged out, and I have been willing to\nconfess anything. When he talks of the pity of it, of course I know\nwhat he means. There has been something, some remainder of a feeling,\nwhich has still kept him from asking me that question. May God, in\nhis mercy, continue to him that feeling!\"\n\n\"But you would answer truly?\"\n\n\"How can I say what I might answer when the torturer is at my nails?\nIf you knew how great was the difficulty to get him away from that\nplace in Italy and bring him here; and what it was to feel that one\nwas bound to stay near him, and that yet one was impotent,--and to\nknow that even that refuge must soon cease for him, and that he might\nhave gone out and died on the road-side, or have done anything which\nthe momentary strength of madness might have dictated,--if you could\nunderstand all this, you would not be surprised at my submitting to\nany degradation which would help to bring him here.\"\n\nStanbury was often down at the cottage, and Nora could discuss the\nmatter better with him than with her sister. And Stanbury could learn\nmore thoroughly from the physician who was now attending Trevelyan\nwhat was the state of the sick man, than Emily could do. According\nto the doctor's idea there was more of ailment in the body than in\nthe mind. He admitted that his patient's thoughts had been forced\nto dwell on one subject till they had become distorted, untrue,\njaundiced, and perhaps mono-maniacal; but he seemed to doubt whether\nthere had ever been a time at which it could have been decided that\nTrevelyan was so mad as to make it necessary that the law should\ninterfere to take care of him. A man,--so argued the doctor,--need\nnot be mad because he is jealous, even though his jealousy be ever\nso absurd. And Trevelyan, in his jealousy, had done nothing cruel,\nnothing wasteful, nothing infamous. In all this Nora was very little\ninclined to agree with the doctor, and thought nothing could be more\ninfamous than Trevelyan's conduct at the present moment,--unless,\nindeed, he could be screened from infamy by that plea of madness.\nBut then there was more behind. Trevelyan had been so wasted by the\nkind of life which he had led, and possessed by nature stamina so\ninsufficient to resist such debility, that it was very doubtful\nwhether he would not sink altogether before he could be made to\nbegin to rise. But one thing was clear. He should be contradicted in\nnothing. If he chose to say that the moon was made of green cheese,\nlet it be conceded to him that the moon was made of green cheese.\nShould he make any other assertion equally removed from the truth,\nlet it not be contradicted. Who would oppose a man with one foot in\nthe grave?\n\n\"Then, Hugh, the sooner I am at Monkhams the better,\" said Nora, who\nhad again been subjected to inuendoes which had been unendurable to\nher. This was on the 7th of August, and it still wanted three days to\nthat on which the journey to Monkhams was to be made.\n\n\"He never says anything to me on the subject,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Because you have made him afraid of you. I almost think that Emily\nand the doctor are wrong in their treatment, and that it would be\nbetter to stand up to him and tell him the truth.\" But the three days\npassed away, and Nora was not driven to any such vindication of her\nsister's character towards her sister's husband.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVI.\n\nMONKHAMS.\n\n\n   [Illustration]\n\nOn the 10th of August Nora Rowley left the cottage by the river-side\nat Twickenham, and went down to Monkhams. The reader need hardly be\ntold that Hugh brought her up from Twickenham and sent her off in the\nrailway carriage. They agreed that no day could be fixed for their\nmarriage till something further should be known of Trevelyan's state.\nWhile he was in his present condition such a marriage could not have\nbeen other than very sad. Nora, when she left the cottage, was still\nvery bitter against her brother-in-law, quoting the doctor's opinion\nas to his sanity, and expressing her own as to his conduct under that\nsupposition. She also believed that he would rally in health, and was\ntherefore, on that account, less inclined to pity him than was his\nwife. Emily Trevelyan of course saw more of him than did her sister,\nand understood better how possible it was that a man might be in such\na condition as to be neither mad nor sane;--not mad, so that all\npower over his own actions need be taken from him; nor sane, so\nthat he must be held to be accountable for his words and thoughts.\nTrevelyan did nothing, and attempted to do nothing, that could injure\nhis wife and child. He submitted himself to medical advice. He did\nnot throw away his money. He had no Bozzle now waiting at his heels.\nHe was generally passive in his wife's hands as to all outward\nthings. He was not violent in rebuke, nor did he often allude to\ntheir past unhappiness. But he still maintained, by a word spoken\nevery now and then, that he had been right throughout in his contest\nwith his wife,--and that his wife had at last acknowledged that it\nwas so. She never contradicted him, and he became bolder and bolder\nin his assertions, endeavouring on various occasions to obtain some\nexpression of an assent from Nora. But Nora would not assent, and he\nwould scowl at her, saying words, both in her presence and behind her\nback, which implied that she was his enemy. \"Why not yield to him?\"\nher sister said the day before she went. \"I have yielded, and your\ndoing so cannot make it worse.\"\n\n\"I can't do it. It would be false. It is better that I should go\naway. I cannot pretend to agree with him, when I know that his mind\nis working altogether under a delusion.\" When the hour for her\ndeparture came, and Hugh was waiting for her, she thought that it\nwould be better that she should go, without seeing Trevelyan. \"There\nwill only be more anger,\" she pleaded. But her sister would not be\ncontented that she should leave the house in this fashion, and urged\nat last, with tears running down her cheeks, that this might possibly\nbe the last interview between them.\n\n\"Say a word to him in kindness before you leave us,\" said Mrs.\nTrevelyan. Then Nora went up to her brother-in-law's bed-side, and\ntold him that she was going, and expressed a hope that he might be\nstronger when she returned. And as she did so she put her hand upon\nthe bed-side, intending to press his in token of affection. But his\nface was turned from her, and he seemed to take no notice of her.\n\"Louis,\" said his wife, \"Nora is going to Monkhams. You will say\ngood-bye to her before she goes?\"\n\n\"If she be not my enemy, I will,\" said he.\n\n\"I have never been your enemy, Louis,\" said Nora, \"and certainly I am\nnot now.\"\n\n\"She had better go,\" he said. \"It is very little more that I expect\nof any one in this world;--but I will recognise no one as my friend\nwho will not acknowledge that I have been sinned against during the\nlast two years;--sinned against cruelly and utterly.\" Emily, who\nwas standing at the bed-head, shuddered as she heard this, but made\nno reply. Nor did Nora speak again, but crept silently out of the\nroom;--and in half a minute her sister followed her.\n\n\"I feared how it would be,\" said Nora.\n\n\"We can only do our best. God knows that I try to do mine.\"\n\n\"I do not think you will ever see him again,\" said Hugh to her in the\ntrain.\n\n\"Would you have had me act otherwise? It is not that it would have\nbeen a lie. I would not have minded that to ease the shattered\nfeelings of one so infirm and suffering as he. In dealing with mad\npeople I suppose one must be false. But I should have been accusing\nher; and it may be that he will get well, and it might be that he\nwould then remember what I had said.\"\n\nAt the station near Monkhams she was met by Lady Peterborough in the\ncarriage. A tall footman in livery came on to the platform to shew\nher the way and to look after her luggage, and she could not fail to\nremember that the man might have been her own servant, instead of\nbeing the servant of her who now sat in Lord Peterborough's carriage.\nAnd when she saw the carriage, and her ladyship's great bay horses,\nand the glittering harness, and the respectably responsible coachman,\nand the arms on the panel, she smiled to herself at the sight of\nthese first outward manifestations of the rank and wealth of the man\nwho had once been her lover. There are men who look as though they\nwere the owners of bay horses and responsible coachmen and family\nblazons,--from whose outward personal appearance, demeanour, and tone\nof voice, one would expect a following of liveries and a magnificence\nof belongings; but Mr. Glascock had by no means been such a man. It\nhad suited his taste to keep these things in abeyance, and to place\nhis pride in the oaks and elms of his park rather than in any of\nthose appanages of grandeur which a man may carry about with him. He\ncould talk of his breed of sheep on an occasion, but he never talked\nof his horses; and though he knew his position and all its glories as\nwell as any nobleman in England, he was ever inclined to hang back a\nlittle in going out of a room, and to bear himself as though he were\na small personage in the world. Some perception of all this came\nacross Nora's mind as she saw the equipage, and tried to reflect, at\na moment's notice, whether the case might have been different with\nher, had Mr. Glascock worn a little of his tinsel outside when she\nfirst met him. Of course she told herself that had he worn it all on\nthe outside, and carried it ever so gracefully, it could have made no\ndifference.\n\nIt was very plain, however, that, though Mr. Glascock did not like\nbright feathers for himself, he chose that his wife should wear them.\nNothing could be prettier than the way in which Caroline Spalding,\nwhom we first saw as she was about to be stuck into the interior\nof the diligence, at St. Michel, now filled her carriage as Lady\nPeterborough. The greeting between them was very affectionate, and\nthere was a kiss in the carriage, even though the two pretty hats,\nperhaps, suffered something. \"We are so glad to have you at last,\"\nsaid Lady Peterborough. \"Of course we are very quiet; but you won't\nmind that.\" Nora declared that no house could be too quiet for her,\nand then said something of the melancholy scene which she had just\nleft. \"And no time is fixed for your own marriage? But of course it\nhas not been possible. And why should you be in a hurry? We quite\nunderstand that this is to be your home till everything has arranged\nitself.\" There was a drive of four or five miles before they reached\nthe park gates, and nothing could be kinder or more friendly than was\nthe new peeress; but Nora told herself that there was no forgetting\nthat her friend was a peeress. She would not be so ill-conditioned as\nto suggest to herself that her friend patronised her;--and, indeed,\nhad she done so, the suggestion would have been false;--but she could\nnot rid herself of a certain sensation of external inferiority, and\nof a feeling that the superiority ought to be on her side, as all\nthis might have been hers,--only that she had not thought it worth\nher while to accept it. As these ideas came into her mind, she hated\nherself for entertaining them; and yet, come they would. While she\nwas talking about her emblematic beef-steak with Hugh, she had no\nregret, no uneasiness, no conception that any state of life could be\nbetter for her than that state in which an emblematic beef-steak was\nof vital importance; but she could not bring her mind to the same\ncondition of unalloyed purity while sitting with Lady Peterborough in\nLord Peterborough's carriage. And for her default in this respect she\nhated herself.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the park,\" said her friend.\n\n\"And where is the house?\"\n\n\"You can't see the house for ever so far yet; it is two miles off.\nThere is about a mile before you come to the gates, and over a mile\nafterwards. One has a sort of feeling when one is in that one can't\nget out,--it is so big.\" In so speaking, it was Lady Peterborough's\nspecial endeavour to state without a boast facts which were\nindifferent, but which must be stated.\n\n\"It is very magnificent,\" said Nora. There was in her voice the\nslightest touch of sarcasm, which she would have given the world not\nto have uttered; but it had been irrepressible.\n\nLady Peterborough understood it instantly, and forgave it, not\nattributing to it more than its true meaning, acknowledging to\nherself that it was natural. \"Dear Nora,\" she said,--not knowing what\nto say, blushing as she spoke,--\"the magnificence is nothing; but the\nman's love is everything.\"\n\nNora shook herself, and determined that she would behave well. The\neffort should be made, and the required result should be produced by\nit. \"The magnificence, as an adjunct, is a great deal,\" she said;\n\"and for his sake, I hope that you enjoy it.\"\n\n\"Of course I enjoy it.\"\n\n\"Wallachia's teachings and preachings have all been thrown to the\nwind, I hope.\"\n\n\"Not quite all. Poor dear Wally! I got a letter from her the\nother day, which she began by saying that she would attune her\ncorrespondence to my changed condition in life. I understood the\nreproach so thoroughly! And, when she told me little details of\nindividual men and women, and of things she had seen, and said not a\nword about the rights of women, or even of politics generally, I felt\nthat I was a degraded creature in her sight. But, though you laugh at\nher, she did me good,--and will do good to others. Here we are inside\nMonkhams, and now you must look at the avenue.\"\n\nNora was now rather proud of herself. She had made the effort, and\nit had been successful; and she felt that she could speak naturally,\nand express her thoughts honestly. \"I remember his telling me about\nthe avenue the first time I ever saw him;--and here it is. I did not\nthink then that I should ever live to see the glories of Monkhams.\nDoes it go all the way like this to the house?\"\n\n\"Not quite;--where you see the light at the end the road turns to the\nright, and the house is just before you. There are great iron gates,\nand terraces, and wondrous paraphernalia before you get up to the\ndoor. I can tell you Monkhams is quite a wonder. I have to shut\nmyself up every Wednesday morning, and hand the house over to Mrs.\nCrutch, the housekeeper, who comes out in a miraculous brown silk\ngown, to shew it to visitors. On other days, you'll find Mrs. Crutch\nquite civil and useful;--but on Wednesdays, she is majestic. Charles\nalways goes off among his sheep on that day, and I shut myself up\nwith a pile of books in a little room. You will have to be imprisoned\nwith me. I do so long to peep at the visitors.\"\n\n\"And I dare say they want to peep at you.\"\n\n\"I proposed at first to shew them round myself;--but Charles wouldn't\nlet me.\"\n\n\"It would have broken Mrs. Crutch's heart.\"\n\n\"That's what Charles said. He thinks that Mrs. Crutch tells them\nthat I'm locked up somewhere, and that that gives a zest to the\nsearch. Some people from Nottingham once did break into old Lady\nPeterborough's room, and the shew was stopped for a year. There was\nsuch a row about it! It prevented Charles coming up for the county.\nBut he wouldn't have got in; and therefore it was lucky, and saved\nmoney.\"\n\nBy this time Nora was quite at her ease; but still there was before\nher the other difficulty, of meeting Lord Peterborough. They were\ndriven out of the avenue, and round to the right, and through the\niron gate, and up to the huge front door. There, upon the top step,\nwas standing Lord Peterborough, with a billycock hat and a very old\nshooting coat, and nankeen trousers, which were considerably too\nshort for him. It was one of the happinesses of his life to dress\njust as he pleased as he went about his own place; and it certainly\nwas his pleasure to wear older clothes than any one else in his\nestablishment. \"Miss Rowley,\" he said, coming forward to give her\na hand out of the carriage, \"I am delighted that you should see\nMonkhams at last.\"\n\n\"You see I have kept you to your promise. Caroline has been telling\nme everything about it; but she is not quite a complete guide as yet.\nShe does not know where the seven oaks are. Do you remember telling\nme of the seven oaks?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. They are five miles off;--at Clatton farm, Carry.\nI don't think you have been near Clatton yet. We will ride there\nto-morrow.\" And thus Nora Rowley was made at home at Monkhams.\n\nShe was made at home, and after a week or two she was very happy. She\nsoon perceived that her host was a perfect gentleman, and as such,\na man to be much loved. She had probably never questioned the fact,\nwhether Mr. Glascock was a gentleman or not, and now she did not\nanalyse it. It probably never occurred to her, even at the present\ntime, to say to herself that he was certainly that thing, so\nimpossible of definition, and so capable of recognition; but she knew\nthat she had to do with one whose presence was always pleasant to\nher, whose words and acts towards her extorted her approbation, whose\nthoughts seemed to her to be always good and manly. Of course she\nhad not loved him, because she had previously known Hugh Stanbury.\nThere could be no comparison between the two men. There was a\nbrightness about Hugh which Lord Peterborough could not rival.\nOtherwise,--except for this reason,--it seemed to her to be\nimpossible that any young woman should fail to love Lord Peterborough\nwhen asked to do so.\n\nAbout the middle of September there came a very happy time for her,\nwhen Hugh was asked down to shoot partridges,--in the doing of which,\nhowever, all his brightness did not bring him near in excellence to\nhis host. Lord Peterborough had been shooting partridges all his\nlife, and shot them with a precision which excited Hugh's envy. To\nown the truth, Stanbury did not shoot well, and was treated rather\nwith scorn by the gamekeeper; but in other respects he spent three or\nfour of the happiest days of his life. He had his work to do, and\nafter the second day over the stubbles, declared that the exigencies\nof the D. R. were too severe to enable him to go out with his gun\nagain; but those rambles about the park with Nora, for which, among\nthe exigencies of the D. R., he did find opportunity, were never to\nbe forgotten.\n\n\"Of course I remember that it might have been mine,\" she said,\nsitting with him under an old, hollow, withered sloping stump of an\noak, which still, however, had sufficient of a head growing from one\nedge of the trunk to give them the shade they wanted; \"and if you\nwish me to own to regrets,--I will.\"\n\n\"It would kill me, I think, if you did; and yet I cannot get it out\nof my head that if it had not been for me your rank and position in\nlife might have been so--so suitable to you.\"\n\n\"No, Hugh; there you're wrong. I have thought about it a good deal,\ntoo; and I know very well that the cold beef-steak in the cupboard is\nthe thing for me. Caroline will do very well here. She looks like a\npeeress, and bears her honours grandly; but they will never harden\nher. I, too, could have been magnificent with fine feathers. Most\nbirds are equal to so much as that. I fancy that I could have\nlooked the part of the fine English lady, and could have patronised\nclergymen's wives in the country, could have held my own among my\npeers in London, and could have kept Mrs. Crutch in order; but it\nwould have hardened me, and I should have learned to think that to be\na lady of fashion was everything.\"\n\n\"I do not believe a bit of it.\"\n\n\"It is better as it is, Hugh;--for me at least. I had always a sort\nof conviction that it would be better, though I had a longing to play\nthe other part. Then you came, and you have saved me. Nevertheless,\nit is very nice, Hugh, to have the oaks to sit under.\" Stanbury\ndeclared that it was very nice.\n\n\n   [Illustration: Monkhams.]\n\n\nBut still nothing was settled about the wedding. Trevelyan's\ncondition was so uncertain that it was very difficult to settle\nanything. Though nothing was said on the subject between Stanbury\nand Mrs. Trevelyan, and nothing written between Nora and her sister,\nit could not but be remembered that should Trevelyan die, his widow\nwould require a home with them. They were deterred from choosing a\nhouse by this reflection, and were deterred from naming a day also by\nthe consideration that were they to do so, Trevelyan's state might\nstill probably prevent it. But this was arranged, that if Trevelyan\nlived through the winter, or even if he should not live, their\nmarriage should not be postponed beyond the end of March. Till\nthat time Lord Peterborough would remain at Monkhams, and it was\nunderstood that Nora's invitation extended to that period.\n\n\"If my wife does not get tired of you, I shall not,\" Lord\nPeterborough said to Nora. \"The thing is that when you do go we shall\nmiss you so terribly.\" In September, too, there happened another\nevent which took Stanbury to Exeter, and all needful particulars as\nto that event shall be narrated in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVII.\n\nMRS. BROOKE BURGESS.\n\n\nIt may be doubted whether there was a happier young woman in England\nthan Dorothy Stanbury when that September came which was to make\nher the wife of Mr. Brooke Burgess, the new partner in the firm of\nCropper and Burgess. Her early aspirations in life had been so low,\nand of late there had come upon her such a succession of soft showers\nof success,--mingled now and then with slight threatenings of storms\nwhich had passed away,--that the Close at Exeter seemed to her to\nhave become a very Paradise. Her aunt's temper had sometimes been to\nher as the threat of a storm, and there had been the Gibson marriage\ntreaty, and the short-lived opposition to the other marriage treaty\nwhich had seemed to her to be so very preferable; but everything had\ngone at last as though she had been Fortune's favourite,--and now\nhad come this beautiful arrangement about Cropper and Burgess, which\nwould save her from being carried away to live among strangers in\nLondon! When she first became known to us on her coming to Exeter,\nin compliance with her aunt's suggestion, she was timid, silent,\nand altogether without self-reliance. Even they who knew her best\nhad never guessed that she possessed a keen sense of humour, a nice\nappreciation of character, and a quiet reticent wit of her own, under\nthat staid and frightened demeanour. Since her engagement with Brooke\nBurgess it seemed to those who watched her that her character had\nbecome changed, as does that of a flower when it opens itself in its\ngrowth. The sweet gifts of nature within became visible, the petals\nsprang to view, and the leaves spread themselves, and the sweet scent\nwas felt upon the air. Had she remained at Nuncombe, it is probable\nthat none would ever have known her but her sister. It was necessary\nto this flower that it should be warmed by the sun of life, and\nstrengthened by the breezes of opposition, and filled by the showers\nof companionship, before it could become aware of its own loveliness.\nDorothy was one who, had she remained ever unseen in the retirement\nof her mother's village cottage, would have lived and died ignorant\nof even her own capabilities for enjoyment. She had not dreamed that\nshe could win a man's love,--had hardly dreamed till she had lived at\nExeter that she had love of her own to give back in return. She had\nnot known that she could be firm in her own opinion, that she could\nlaugh herself and cause others to laugh, that she could be a lady and\nknow that other women were not so, that she had good looks of her own\nand could be very happy when told of them by lips that she loved. The\nflower that blows the quickest is never the sweetest. The fruit that\nripens tardily has ever the finest flavour. It is often the same with\nmen and women. The lad who talks at twenty as men should talk at\nthirty, has seldom much to say worth the hearing when he is forty;\nand the girl who at eighteen can shine in society with composure, has\ngenerally given over shining before she is a full-grown woman. With\nDorothy the scent and beauty of the flower, and the flavour of the\nfruit, had come late; but the fruit will keep, and the flower will\nnot fall to pieces with the heat of an evening.\n\n\"How marvellously your bride has changed since she has been here,\"\nsaid Mrs. MacHugh to Miss Stanbury. \"We thought she couldn't say boo\nto a goose at first; but she holds her own now among the best of\n'em.\"\n\n\"Of course she does;--why shouldn't she? I never knew a Stanbury yet\nthat was a fool.\"\n\n\"They are a wonderful family, of course,\" said Mrs. MacHugh; \"but I\nthink that of all of them she is the most wonderful. Old Barty said\nsomething to her at my house yesterday that wasn't intended to be\nkind.\"\n\n\"When did he ever intend to be kind?\"\n\n\"But he got no change out of her. 'The Burgesses have been in Exeter\na long time,' she said, 'and I don't see why we should not get on at\nany rate as well as those before us.' Barty grunted and growled and\nslunk away. He thought she would shake in her shoes when he spoke to\nher.\"\n\n\"He has never been able to make a Stanbury shake in her shoes yet,\"\nsaid the old lady.\n\nEarly in September, Dorothy went to Nuncombe Putney to spend a week\nwith her mother and sister at the cottage. She had insisted on this,\nthough Priscilla had hinted, somewhat unnecessarily, that Dorothy,\nwith her past comforts and her future prospects, would find the\naccommodation at the cottage very limited. \"I suppose you and I,\nPris, can sleep in the same bed, as we always did,\" she said, with a\ntear in each eye. Then Priscilla had felt ashamed of herself, and had\nbade her come.\n\n\"The truth is, Dolly,\" said the elder sister, \"that we feel so unlike\nmarrying and giving in marriage at Nuncombe, that I'm afraid you'll\nlose your brightness and become dowdy, and grim, and misanthropic, as\nwe are. When mamma and I sit down to what we call dinner, I always\nfeel that there is a grace hovering in the air different to that\nwhich she says.\"\n\n\"And what is it, Pris?\"\n\n\"Pray, God, don't quite starve us, and let everybody else have\nindigestion. We don't say it out loud, but there it is; and the\nspirit of it might damp the orange blossoms.\"\n\nShe went of course, and the orange blossoms were not damped. She had\nlong walks with her sister round by Niddon and Ridleigh, and even as\nfar distant as Cockchaffington, where much was said about that wicked\nColonel as they stood looking at the porch of the church. \"I shall be\nso happy,\" said Dorothy, \"when you and mother come to us. It will be\nsuch a joy to me that you should be my guests.\"\n\n\"But we shall not come.\"\n\n\"Why not, Priscilla?\"\n\n\"I know it will be so. Mamma will not care for going, if I do not\ngo.\"\n\n\"And why should you not come?\"\n\n\"For a hundred reasons, all of which you know, Dolly. I am stiff,\nimpracticable, ill-conditioned, and very bad at going about visiting.\nI am always thinking that other people ought to have indigestion, and\nperhaps I might come to have some such feeling about you and Brooke.\"\n\n\"I should not be at all afraid of that.\"\n\n\"I know that my place in the world is here, at Nuncombe Putney. I\nhave a pride about myself, and think that I never did wrong but\nonce,--when I let mamma go into that odious Clock House. It is a bad\npride, and yet I'm proud of it. I haven't got a gown fit to go and\nstay with you, when you become a grand lady in Exeter. I don't doubt\nyou'd give me any sort of gown I wanted.\"\n\n\"Of course I would. Ain't we sisters, Pris?\"\n\n\"I shall not be so much your sister as he will be your husband.\nBesides, I hate to take things. When Hugh sends money, and for\nmamma's sake it is accepted, I always feel uneasy while it lasts, and\nthink that that plague of an indigestion ought to come upon me also.\nDo you remember the lamb that came when you went away? It made me so\nsick.\"\n\n\"But, Priscilla;--isn't that morbid?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. You don't suppose I really think it grand. I am\nmorbid. But I am strong enough to live on, and not get killed by the\nmorbidity. Heaven knows how much more there may be of it;--forty\nyears, perhaps, and probably the greater portion of that absolutely\nalone;--\"\n\n\"No;--you'll be with us then,--if it should come.\"\n\n\"I think not, Dolly. Not to have a hole of my own would be\nintolerable to me. But, as I was saying, I shall not be unhappy. To\nenjoy life, as you do, is I suppose out of the question for me. But\nI have a satisfaction when I get to the end of the quarter and find\nthat there is not half-a-crown due to any one. Things get dearer and\ndearer, but I have a comfort even in that. I have a feeling that I\nshould like to bring myself to the straw a day.\" Of course there\nwere offers made of aid,--offers which were rather prayers,--and\nplans suggested of what might be done between Brooke and Hugh; but\nPriscilla declared that all such plans were odious to her. \"Why\nshould you be unhappy about us?\" she continued. \"We will come and see\nyou,--at least I will,--perhaps once in six months, and you shall pay\nfor the railway ticket; only I won't stay, because of the gown.\"\n\n\"Is not that nonsense, Pris?\"\n\n\"Just at present it is, because mamma and I have both got new gowns\nfor the wedding. Hugh sent them, and ever so much money to buy\nbonnets and gloves.\"\n\n\"He is to be married himself soon,--down at a place called Monkhams.\nNora is staying there.\"\n\n\"Yes;--with a lord,\" said Priscilla. \"We sha'n't have to go there, at\nany rate.\"\n\n\"You liked Nora when she was here?\"\n\n\"Very much;--though I thought her self-willed. But she is not\nworldly, and she is conscientious. She might have married that lord\nherself if she would. I do like her. When she comes to you at Exeter,\nif the wedding gown isn't quite worn out, I shall come and see her. I\nknew she liked him when she was here, but she never said so.\"\n\n\"She is very pretty, is she not? He sent me her photograph.\"\n\n\"She is handsome rather than pretty. I wonder why it is that you two\nshould be married, and so grandly married, and that I shall never,\nnever have any one to love.\"\n\n\"Oh, Priscilla, do not say that. If I have a child will you not love\nit?\"\n\n\"It will be your child;--not mine. Do not suppose that I complain.\nI know that it is right. I know that you ought to be married and I\nought not. I know that there is not a man in Devonshire who would\ntake me, or a man in Devonshire whom I would accept. I know that I am\nquite unfit for any other kind of life than this. I should make any\nman wretched, and any man would make me wretched. But why is it so? I\nbelieve that you would make any man happy.\"\n\n\"I hope to make Brooke happy.\"\n\n\"Of course you will, and therefore you deserve it. We'll go home now,\ndear, and get mamma's things ready for the great day.\"\n\nOn the afternoon before the great day all the visitors were to come,\nand during the forenoon old Miss Stanbury was in a great fidget.\nLuckily for Dorothy, her own preparations were already made, so that\nshe could give her time to her aunt without injury to herself. Miss\nStanbury had come to think of herself as though all the reality of\nher life had passed away from her. Every resolution that she had\nformed had been broken. She had had the great enemy of her life,\nBarty Burgess, in the house with her upon terms that were intended\nto be amicable, and had arranged with him a plan for the division of\nthe family property. Her sister-in-law, whom in the heyday of her\nstrength she had chosen to regard as her enemy, and with whom even as\nyet there had been no reconciliation, was about to become her guest,\nas was also Priscilla,--whom she had ever disliked almost as much as\nshe had respected. She had quarrelled utterly with Hugh,--in such a\nmanner as to leave no possible chance of a reconciliation,--and he\nalso was about to be her guest. And then, as to her chosen heir, she\nwas now assisting him in doing the only thing, as to which she had\ndeclared that if he did do it, he should not be her heir. As she went\nabout the house, under an idea that such a multiplicity of persons\ncould not be housed and fed without superhuman exertion, she thought\nof all this, and could not help confessing to herself that her life\nhad been very vain. It was only when her eyes rested on Dorothy, and\nshe saw how supremely happy was the one person whom she had taken\nmost closely to her heart, that she could feel that she had done\nanything that should not have been left undone. \"I think I'll sit\ndown now, Dorothy,\" she said, \"or I sha'n't be able to be with you\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Do, aunt. Everything is all ready, and nobody will be here for an\nhour yet. Nothing can be nicer than the rooms, and nothing ever was\ndone so well before. I'm only thinking how lonely you'll be when\nwe're gone.\"\n\n\"It'll be only for six weeks.\"\n\n\"But six weeks is such a long time.\"\n\n\"What would it have been if he had taken you up to London, my pet?\nAre you sure your mother wouldn't like a fire in her room, Dorothy?\"\n\n\"A fire in September, aunt?\"\n\n\"People live so differently. One never knows.\"\n\n\"They never have but one fire at Nuncombe, aunt, summer or winter.\"\n\n\"That's no reason they shouldn't be comfortable here.\" However, she\ndid not insist on having the fire lighted.\n\nMrs. Stanbury and Priscilla came first, and the meeting was certainly\nvery uncomfortable. Poor Mrs. Stanbury was shy, and could hardly\nspeak a word. Miss Stanbury thought that her visitor was haughty,\nand, though she endeavoured to be gracious, did it with a struggle.\nThey called each other ma'am, which made Dorothy uneasy. Each of them\nwas so dear to her, that it was a pity that they should glower at\neach other like enemies. Priscilla was not at all shy; but she was\ncombative, and, as her aunt said of her afterwards, would not keep\nher prickles in. \"I hope, Priscilla, you like weddings,\" said Miss\nStanbury to her, not knowing where to find a subject for\nconversation.\n\n\"In the abstract I like them,\" said Priscilla. Miss Stanbury did not\nknow what her niece meant by liking weddings in the abstract, and was\nangry.\n\n\"I suppose you do have weddings at Nuncombe Putney sometimes,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I hope they do,\" said Priscilla, \"but I never saw one. To-morrow\nwill be my first experience.\"\n\n\"Your own will come next, my dear,\" said Miss Stanbury.\n\n\"I think not,\" said Priscilla. \"It is quite as likely to be yours,\naunt.\" This, Miss Stanbury thought, was almost an insult, and she\nsaid nothing more on the occasion.\n\nThen came Hugh and the bridegroom. The bridegroom, as a matter of\ncourse, was not accommodated in the house, but he was allowed to\ncome there for his tea. He and Hugh had come together; and for Hugh\na bed-room had been provided. His aunt had not seen him since he\nhad been turned out of the house, because of his bad practices, and\nDorothy had anticipated the meeting between them with alarm. It was,\nhowever, much more pleasant than had been that between the ladies.\n\"Hugh,\" she said stiffly, \"I am glad to see you on such an occasion\nas this.\"\n\n\"Aunt,\" he said, \"I am glad of any occasion that can get me an\nentrance once more into the dear old house. I am so pleased to see\nyou.\" She allowed her hand to remain in his a few moments, and\nmurmured something which was intended to signify her satisfaction.\n\"I must tell you that I am going to be married myself, to one of the\ndearest, sweetest, and loveliest girls that ever were seen, and you\nmust congratulate me.\"\n\n\"I do, I do; and I hope you may be happy.\"\n\n\"We mean to try to be; and some day you must let me bring her to you,\nand shew her. I shall not be satisfied, if you do not know my wife.\"\nShe told Martha afterwards that she hoped that Mr. Hugh had sown his\nwild oats, and that matrimony would sober him. When, however, Martha\nremarked that she believed Mr. Hugh to be as hardworking a young man\nas any in London, Miss Stanbury shook her head sorrowfully. Things\nwere being very much changed with her; but not even yet was she to be\nbrought to approve of work done on behalf of a penny newspaper.\n\nOn the following morning, at ten o'clock, there was a procession from\nMiss Stanbury's house into the Cathedral, which was made entirely on\nfoot;--indeed, no assistance could have been given by any carriage,\nfor there is a back entrance to the Cathedral, near to the Lady\nChapel, exactly opposite Miss Stanbury's house. There were many\nof the inhabitants of the Close there, to see the procession, and\nthe cathedral bells rang out their peals very merrily. Brooke, the\nbridegroom, gave his arm to Miss Stanbury, which was, no doubt, very\nimproper,--as he should have appeared in the church as coming from\nquite some different part of the world. Then came the bride, hanging\non her brother, then two bridesmaids,--friends of Dorothy's, living\nin the town; and, lastly, Priscilla with her mother, for nothing\nwould induce Priscilla to take the part of a bridesmaid. \"You might\nas well ask an owl to sing to you,\" she said. \"And then all the\nfrippery would be thrown away upon me.\" But she stood close to\nDorothy, and when the ceremony had been performed, was the first,\nafter Brooke, to kiss her.\n\nEverybody acknowledged that the bride was a winsome bride. Mrs.\nMacHugh was at the breakfast, and declared afterwards that Dorothy\nBurgess,--as she then was pleased to call her,--was a girl very hard\nto be understood. \"She came here,\" said Mrs. MacHugh, \"two years ago,\na plain, silent, shy, dowdy young woman, and we all said that Miss\nStanbury would be tired of her in a week. There has never come a time\nin which there was any visible difference in her, and now she is one\nof our city beauties, with plenty to say to everybody, with a fortune\nin one pocket and her aunt in the other, and everybody is saying what\na fortunate fellow Brooke Burgess is to get her. In a year or two\nshe'll be at the top of everything in the city, and will make her way\nin the county too.\"\n\nThe compiler of this history begs to add his opinion to that of\n\"everybody,\" as quoted above by Mrs. MacHugh. He thinks that Brooke\nBurgess was a very fortunate fellow to get his wife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVIII.\n\nACQUITTED.\n\n\nDuring this time, while Hugh was sitting with his love under the oak\ntrees at Monkhams, and Dorothy was being converted into Mrs. Brooke\nBurgess in Exeter Cathedral, Mrs. Trevelyan was living with her\nhusband in the cottage at Twickenham. Her life was dreary enough,\nand there was but very little of hope in it to make its dreariness\nsupportable. As often happens in periods of sickness, the single\nfriend who could now be of service to the one or to the other was\nthe doctor. He came daily to them, and with that quick growth of\nconfidence which medical kindness always inspires, Trevelyan told\nto this gentleman all the history of his married life,--and all\nthat Trevelyan told to him he repeated to Trevelyan's wife. It may\ntherefore be understood that Trevelyan, between them, was treated\nlike a child.\n\nDr. Nevill had soon been able to tell Mrs. Trevelyan that her\nhusband's health had been so shattered as to make it improbable that\nhe should ever again be strong either in body or in mind. He would\nnot admit, even when treating his patient like a child, that he had\never been mad, and spoke of Sir Marmaduke's threat as unfortunate.\n\"But what could papa have done?\" asked the wife.\n\n\"It is often, no doubt, difficult to know what to do; but threats are\nseldom of avail to bring a man back to reason. Your father was angry\nwith him, and yet declared that he was mad. That in itself was hardly\nrational. One does not become angry with a madman.\"\n\nOne does not become angry with a madman; but while a man has power\nin his hands over others, and when he misuses that power grossly\nand cruelly, who is there that will not be angry? The misery of the\ninsane more thoroughly excites our pity than any other suffering\nto which humanity is subject; but it is necessary that the madness\nshould be acknowledged to be madness before the pity can be felt. One\ncan forgive, or, at any rate, make excuses for any injury when it is\ndone; but it is almost beyond human nature to forgive an injury when\nit is a-doing, let the condition of the doer be what it may. Emily\nTrevelyan at this time suffered infinitely. She was still willing to\nyield in all things possible, because her husband was ill,--because\nperhaps he was dying; but she could no longer satisfy herself with\nthinking that all that she admitted,--all that she was still ready to\nadmit,--had been conceded in order that her concessions might tend to\nsoften the afflictions of one whose reason was gone. Dr. Nevill said\nthat her husband was not mad;--and indeed Trevelyan seemed now to be\nso clear in his mind that she could not doubt what the doctor said to\nher. She could not think that he was mad,--and yet he spoke of the\nlast two years as though he had suffered from her almost all that a\nhusband could suffer from a wife's misconduct. She was in doubt about\nhis health. \"He may recover,\" the doctor said; \"but he is so weak\nthat the slightest additional ailment would take him off.\" At this\ntime Trevelyan could not raise himself from his bed, and was carried,\nlike a child, from one room to another. He could eat nothing solid,\nand believed himself to be dying. In spite of his weakness,--and of\nhis savage memories in regard to the past,--he treated his wife on\nall ordinary subjects with consideration. He spoke much of his money,\ntelling her that he had not altered, and would not alter, the will\nthat he had made immediately on his marriage. Under that will all his\nproperty would be hers for her life, and would go to their child when\nshe was dead. To her this will was more than just,--it was generous\nin the confidence which it placed in her; and he told his lawyer, in\nher presence, that, to the best of his judgment, he need not change\nit. But still there passed hardly a day in which he did not make some\nallusion to the great wrong which he had endured, throwing in her\nteeth the confessions which she had made,--and almost accusing her\nof that which she certainly never had confessed, even when, in the\nextremity of her misery at Casalunga, she had thought that it little\nmattered what she said, so that for the moment he might be appeased.\nIf he died, was he to die in this belief? If he lived, was he to live\nin this belief? And if he did so believe, was it possible that he\nshould still trust her with his money and with his child?\n\n\"Emily,\" he said one day, \"it has been a terrible tragedy, has it\nnot?\" She did not answer his question, sitting silent as it was her\ncustom to do when he addressed her after such fashion as this. At\nsuch times she would not answer him; but she knew that he would\npress her for an answer. \"I blame him more than I do you,\" continued\nTrevelyan,--\"infinitely more. He was a serpent intending to sting me\nfrom the first,--not knowing perhaps how deep the sting would go.\"\nThere was no question in this, and the assertion was one which had\nbeen made so often that she could let it pass. \"You are young, Emily,\nand it may be that you will marry again.\"\n\n\"Never,\" she said, with a shudder. It seemed to her then that\nmarriage was so fearful a thing that certainly she could never\nventure upon it again.\n\n\"All I ask of you is, that should you do so, you will be more careful\nof your husband's honour.\"\n\n\"Louis,\" she said, getting up and standing close to him, \"tell me\nwhat it is that you mean.\" It was now his turn to remain silent,\nand hers to demand an answer. \"I have borne much,\" she continued,\n\"because I would not vex you in your illness.\"\n\n\"You have borne much?\"\n\n\"Indeed and indeed, yes. What woman has ever borne more!\"\n\n\"And I?\" said he.\n\n\"Dear Louis, let us understand each other at last. Of what do you\naccuse me? Let us, at any rate, know each other's thoughts on this\nmatter, of which each of us is ever thinking.\"\n\n\"I make no new accusation.\"\n\n\"I must protest then against your using words which seem to convey\naccusation. Since marriages were first known upon earth, no woman has\never been truer to her husband than I have been to you.\"\n\n\"Were you lying to me then at Casalunga when you acknowledged that\nyou had been false to your duties?\"\n\n\"If I acknowledged that, I did lie. I never said that; but yet I did\nlie,--believing it to be best for you that I should do so. For your\nhonour's sake, for the child's sake, weak as you are, Louis, I must\nprotest that it was so. I have never injured you by deed or thought.\"\n\n\"And yet you have lied to me! Is a lie no injury;--and such a lie!\nEmily, why did you lie to me? You will tell me to-morrow that you\nnever lied, and never owned that you had lied.\"\n\nThough it should kill him, she must tell him the truth now. \"You were\nvery ill at Casalunga,\" she said, after a pause.\n\n\"But not so ill as I am now. I could breathe that air. I could live\nthere. Had I remained I should have been well now,--but what of\nthat?\"\n\n\"Louis, you were dying there. Pray, pray listen to me. We thought\nthat you were dying; and we knew also that you would be taken from\nthat house.\"\n\n\"That was my affair. Do you mean that I could not keep a house over\nmy head?\" At this moment he was half lying, half sitting, in a large\neasy chair in the little drawing-room of their cottage, to which he\nhad been carried from the adjoining bed-room. When not excited, he\nwould sit for hours without moving, gazing through the open window,\nsometimes with some pretext of a book lying within the reach of his\nhand; but almost without strength to lift it, and certainly without\npower to read it. But now he had worked himself up to so much energy\nthat he almost raised himself up in his chair, as he turned towards\nhis wife. \"Had I not the world before me, to choose a house in?\"\n\n\"They would have put you somewhere, and I could not have reached\nyou.\"\n\n\"In a madhouse, you mean. Yes;--if you had told them.\"\n\n\"Will you listen, dear Louis? We knew that it was our duty to bring\nyou home; and as you would not let me come to you, and serve you, and\nassist you to come here where you are safe,--unless I owned that you\nhad been right, I said that you had been right.\"\n\n\"And it was a lie,--you say now?\"\n\n\"All that is nothing. I cannot go through it; nor should you. There\nis the only question. You do not think that I have been--? I need not\nsay the thing. You do not think that?\" As she asked the question, she\nknelt beside him, and took his hand in hers, and kissed it. \"Say that\nyou do not think that, and I will never trouble you further about the\npast.\"\n\n\"Yes;--that is it. You will never trouble me!\" She glanced up into\nhis face and saw there the old look which he used to wear when he was\nat Willesden and at Casalunga; and there had come again the old tone\nin which he had spoken to her in the bitterness of his wrath:--the\nlook and the tone, which had made her sure that he was a madman. \"The\ncraft and subtlety of women passes everything!\" he said. \"And so at\nlast I am to tell you that from the beginning it has been my doing. I\nwill never say so, though I should die in refusing to do it.\"\n\nAfter that there was no possibility of further conversation, for\nthere came upon him a fit of coughing, and then he swooned; and in\nhalf-an-hour he was in bed, and Dr. Nevill was by his side. \"You must\nnot speak to him at all on this matter,\" said the doctor. \"But if he\nspeaks to me?\" she asked. \"Let it pass,\" said the doctor. \"Let the\nsubject be got rid of with as much ease as you can. He is very ill\nnow, and even this might have killed him.\" Nevertheless, though this\nseemed to be stern, Dr. Nevill was very kind to her, declaring that\nthe hallucination in her husband's mind did not really consist of a\nbelief in her infidelity, but arose from an obstinate determination\nto yield nothing. \"He does not believe it; but he feels that were he\nto say as much, his hands would be weakened and yours strengthened.\"\n\n\"Can he then be in his sane mind?\"\n\n\"In one sense all misconduct is proof of insanity,\" said the doctor.\n\"In his case the weakness of the mind has been consequent upon the\nweakness of the body.\"\n\nThree days after that Nora visited Twickenham from Monkhams in\nobedience to a telegram from her sister. \"Louis,\" she said, \"had\nbecome so much weaker, that she hardly dared to be alone with him.\nWould Nora come to her?\" Nora came of course, and Hugh met her at the\nstation, and brought her with him to the cottage. He asked whether\nhe might see Trevelyan, but was told that it would be better that\nhe should not. He had been almost continually silent since the last\ndispute which he had with his wife; but he had given little signs\nthat he was always thinking of the manner in which he had been\nbrought home by her from Italy, and of the story she had told him\nof her mode of inducing him to come. Hugh Stanbury had been her\npartner in that struggle, and would probably be received, if not with\nsullen silence, then with some attempt at rebuke. But Hugh did see\nDr. Nevill, and learned from him that it was hardly possible that\nTrevelyan should live many hours. \"He has worn himself out,\" said the\ndoctor, \"and there is nothing left in him by which he can lay hold of\nlife again.\" Of Nora her brother-in-law took but little notice, and\nnever again referred in her hearing to the great trouble of his life.\nHe said to her a word or two about Monkhams, and asked a question now\nand again as to Lord Peterborough,--whom, however, he always called\nMr. Glascock; but Hugh Stanbury's name was never mentioned by him.\nThere was a feeling in his mind that at the very last he had been\nduped in being brought to England, and that Stanbury had assisted in\nthe deception. To his wife he would whisper little petulant regrets\nfor the loss of the comforts of Casalunga, and would speak of the air\nof Italy and of Italian skies and of the Italian sun, as though he\nhad enjoyed at his Sienese villa all the luxuries which climate can\ngive, and would have enjoyed them still had he been allowed to remain\nthere. To all this she would say nothing. She knew now that he was\nfailing quickly, and there was only one subject on which she either\nfeared or hoped to hear him speak. Before he left her for ever and\never would he tell her that he had not doubted her faith?\n\nShe had long discussions with Nora on the matter, as though all the\nfuture of her life depended on it. It was in vain that Nora tried to\nmake her understand that if hereafter the spirit of her husband could\nknow anything of the troubles of his mortal life, could ever look\nback to the things which he had done in the flesh, then would he\ncertainly know the truth, and all suspicion would be at an end. And\nif not, if there was to be no such retrospect, what did it matter\nnow, for these few last hours before the coil should be shaken off,\nand all doubt and all sorrow should be at an end? But the wife, who\nwas soon to be a widow, yearned to be acquitted in this world by him\nto whom her guilt or her innocence had been matter of such vital\nimportance. \"He has never thought it,\" said Nora.\n\n\"But if he would say so! If he would only look it! It will be all in\nall to me as long as I live in this world.\" And then, though they had\ndetermined between themselves in spoken words never to regard him\nagain as one who had been mad, in all their thoughts and actions\ntowards him they treated him as though he were less responsible than\nan infant. And he was mad;--mad though every doctor in England had\ncalled him sane. Had he not been mad he must have been a fiend,--or\nhe could not have tortured, as he had done, the woman to whom he owed\nthe closest protection which one human being can give to another.\n\nDuring these last days and nights she never left him. She had done\nher duty to him well, at any rate since the time when she had been\nenabled to come near him in Italy. It may be that in the first days\nof their quarrel, she had not been regardful, as she should have\nbeen, of a husband's will,--that she might have escaped this tragedy\nby submitting herself to the man's wishes, as she had always been\nready to submit herself to his words. Had she been able always to\nkeep her neck in the dust under his foot, their married life might\nhave been passed without outward calamity, and it is possible that\nhe might still have lived. But if she erred, surely she had been\nscourged for her error with scorpions. As she sat at his bedside\nwatching him, she thought of her wasted youth, of her faded beauty,\nof her shattered happiness, of her fallen hopes. She had still her\nchild,--but she felt towards him that she herself was so sad a\ncreature, so sombre, so dark, so necessarily wretched from this time\nforth till the day of her death, that it would be better for the boy\nthat she should never be with him. There could be nothing left for\nher but garments dark with woe, eyes red with weeping, hours sad from\nsolitude, thoughts weary with memory. And even yet,--if he would only\nnow say that he did not believe her to have been guilty, how great\nwould be the change in her future life!\n\nThen came an evening in which he seemed to be somewhat stronger than\nhe had been. He had taken some refreshment that had been prepared\nfor him, and, stimulated by its strength, had spoken a word or two\nboth to Nora and to his wife. His words had been of no especial\ninterest,--alluding to some small detail of his own condition, such\nas are generally the chosen topics of conversation with invalids.\nBut he had been pronounced to be better, and Nora spoke to him\ncheerfully, when he was taken into the next room by the man who\nwas always at hand to move him. His wife followed him, and soon\nafterwards returned, and bade Nora good night. She would sit by her\nhusband, and Nora was to go to the room below, that she might receive\nher lover there. He was expected out that evening, but Mrs. Trevelyan\nsaid that she would not see him. Hugh came and went, and Nora took\nherself to her chamber. The hours of the night went on, and Mrs.\nTrevelyan was still sitting by her husband's bed. It was still\nSeptember, and the weather was very warm. But the windows had been\nall closed since an hour before sunset. She was sitting there\nthinking, thinking, thinking. Dr. Nevill had told her that the time\nnow was very near. She was not thinking now how very near it might\nbe, but whether there might yet be time for him to say that one word\nto her.\n\n\"Emily,\" he said, in the lowest whisper.\n\n\"Darling!\" she answered, turning round and touching him with her\nhand.\n\n\"My feet are cold. There are no clothes on them.\"\n\nShe took a thick shawl and spread it double across the bottom of\nthe bed, and put her hand upon his arm. Though it was clammy with\nperspiration, it was chill, and she brought the warm clothes up close\nround his shoulders. \"I can't sleep,\" he said. \"If I could sleep,\nI shouldn't mind.\" Then he was silent again, and her thoughts went\nharping on, still on the same subject. She told herself that if ever\nthat act of justice were to be done for her, it must be done that\nnight. After a while she turned round over him ever so gently, and\nsaw that his large eyes were open and fixed upon the wall.\n\nShe was kneeling now on the chair close by the bed head, and her hand\nwas on the rail of the bedstead supporting her. \"Louis,\" she said,\never so softly.\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"Can you say one word for your wife, dear, dear, dearest husband?\"\n\n\"What word?\"\n\n\"I have not been a harlot to you;--have I?\"\n\n\"What name is that?\"\n\n\"But what a thing, Louis! Kiss my hand, Louis, if you believe me.\"\nAnd very gently she laid the tips of her fingers on his lips. For a\nmoment or two she waited, and the kiss did not come. Would he spare\nher in this the last moment left to him either for justice or for\nmercy? For a moment or two the bitterness of her despair was almost\nunendurable. She had time to think that were she once to withdraw\nher hand, she would be condemned for ever;--and that it must be\nwithdrawn. But at length the lips moved, and with struggling ear she\ncould hear the sound of the tongue within, and the verdict of the\ndying man had been given in her favour. He never spoke a word more\neither to annul it or to enforce it.\n\nSome time after that she crept into Nora's room. \"Nora,\" she said,\nwaking the sleeping girl, \"it is all over.\"\n\n\"Is he--dead?\"\n\n\"It is all over. Mrs. Richards is there. It is better than an hour\nsince now. Let me come in.\" She got into her sister's bed, and there\nshe told the tale of her tardy triumph. \"He declared to me at last\nthat he trusted me,\" she said,--almost believing that real words had\ncome from his lips to that effect. Then she fell into a flood of\ntears, and after a while she also slept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIX.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nAt last the maniac was dead, and in his last moments he had made such\nreparation as was in his power for the evil that he had done. With\nthat slight touch of his dry fevered lips he had made the assertion\non which was to depend the future peace and comfort of the woman whom\nhe had so cruelly misused. To her mind the acquittal was perfect;\nbut she never explained to human ears,--not even to those of her\nsister,--the manner in which it had been given. Her life, as far as\nwe are concerned with it, has been told. For the rest, it cannot be\nbut that it should be better than that which was passed. If there be\nany retribution for such sufferings in money, liberty, and outward\ncomfort, such retribution she possessed;--for all that had been his,\nwas now hers. He had once suggested what she should do, were she\never to be married again; and she felt that of such a career there\ncould be no possibility. Anything but that! We all know that widows'\npractices in this matter do not always tally with wives' vows; but,\nas regards Mrs. Trevelyan, we are disposed to think that the promise\nwill be kept. She has her child, and he will give her sufficient\ninterest to make life worth having.\n\nEarly in the following spring Hugh Stanbury was married to Nora\nRowley in the parish church of Monkhams,--at which place by that time\nNora found herself to be almost as much at home as she might have\nbeen under other circumstances. They had prayed that the marriage\nmight be very private;--but when the day arrived there was no\nvery close privacy. The parish church was quite full, there were\nhalf-a-dozen bridesmaids, there was a great breakfast, Mrs. Crutch\nhad a new brown silk gown given to her, there was a long article\nin the county gazette, and there were short paragraphs in various\nmetropolitan newspapers. It was generally thought among his compeers\nthat Hugh Stanbury had married into the aristocracy, and that the\nfact was a triumph for the profession to which he belonged. It shewed\nwhat a Bohemian could do, and that men of the press in England might\ngradually hope to force their way almost anywhere. So great was the\nname of Monkhams! He and his wife took for themselves a very small\nhouse near the Regent's Park, at which they intend to remain until\nHugh shall have enabled himself to earn an additional two hundred\na-year. Mrs. Trevelyan did not come to live with them, but kept the\ncottage near the river at Twickenham. Hugh Stanbury was very averse\nto any protracted connection with comforts to be obtained from poor\nTrevelyan's income, and told Nora that he must hold her to her\npromise about the beef-steak in the cupboard. It is our opinion that\nMr. and Mrs. Hugh Stanbury will never want for a beef-steak and all\ncomfortable additions until the inhabitants of London shall cease to\nrequire newspapers on their breakfast tables.\n\nBrooke and Mrs. Brooke established themselves in the house in the\nClose on their return from their wedding tour, and Brooke at once put\nhimself into intimate relations with the Messrs. Croppers, taking\nhis fair share of the bank work. Dorothy was absolutely installed as\nmistress in her aunt's house with many wonderful ceremonies, with\nthe unlocking of cupboards, the outpouring of stores, the giving\nup of keys, and with many speeches made to Martha. This was all\nvery painful to Dorothy, who could not bring herself to suppose it\npossible that she should be the mistress of that house, during her\naunt's life. Miss Stanbury, however, of course persevered, speaking\nof herself as a worn-out old woman, with one foot in the grave, who\nwould soon be carried away and put out of sight. But in a very few\ndays things got back into their places, and Aunt Stanbury had the\nkeys again. \"I knew how it would be, miss,\" said Martha to her young\nmistress, \"and I didn't say nothing, 'cause you understand her so\nwell.\"\n\nMrs. Stanbury and Priscilla still live at the cottage, which,\nhowever, to Priscilla's great disgust, has been considerably improved\nand prettily furnished. This was done under the auspices of Hugh, but\nwith funds chiefly supplied from the house of Brooke, Dorothy, and\nCo. Priscilla comes into Exeter to see her sister, perhaps, every\nother week; but will never sleep away from home, and very rarely will\neat or drink at her sister's table. \"I don't know why, I don't,\" she\nsaid to Dorothy, \"but somehow it puts me out. It delays me in my\nefforts to come to the straw a day.\" Nevertheless, the sisters are\ndear friends.\n\nI fear that in some previous number a half promise was made that a\nhusband should be found for Camilla French. That half-promise cannot\nbe treated in the manner in which any whole promise certainly would\nhave been handled. There is no husband ready for Cammy French. The\nreader, however, will be delighted to know that she made up her\nquarrel with her sister and Mr. Gibson, and is now rather fond\nof being a guest at Mr. Gibson's house. On her first return to\nExeter after the Gibsons had come back from their little Cornish\nrustication, Camilla declared that she could not and would not bring\nherself to endure a certain dress of which Bella was very fond;--and\nas this dress had been bought for Camilla with special reference\nto the glories of her anticipated married life, this objection was\nalmost natural. But Bella treated it as absurd, and Camilla at last\ngave way.\n\nIt need only further be said that though Giles Hickbody and Martha\nare not actually married as yet,--men and women in their class of\nlife always moving towards marriage with great precaution,--it is\nquite understood that the young people are engaged, and are to be\nmade happy together at some future time.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 5140-8.txt or 5140-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/5\/1\/4\/5140\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":634,"split":"train"}
