{"ori_id":"e8f4c55b6eed0c4e0e6b34b48651bafa884ae1b5","title":"Something Fresh","context":"Something Fresh\n Young neighbours and fellow-writers Ashe Marson and Joan Valentine, newly met and both in need of a change of direction, find themselves drawn down to Blandings, for various reasons attempting to retrieve a scarab belonging to an American millionaire, absent-mindedly purloined by Lord Emsworth. Once within the Castle's idyllic walls, despite impersonating servants, romance cannot help but blossom; meanwhile, Freddie Threepwood, engaged to the millionaire's daughter, is worried about some incriminating letters.The novel begins with Ashe Marson, a young writer employed by the Mammoth Publishing Company, the creator of the popular \"Gridley Quayle\" detective novels, doing his daily exercises. Joan Valentine, a young girl living in the same apartment building, looks on and laughs at him. Thus she and Ashe meet, discover that they work for the same publishing house, and Ashe is encouraged to look for a new opportunity among the newspaper ads.\nMeanwhile, Freddie Threepwood, the younger son of the 9th Earl of Emsworth, is engaged to be married to Aline Peters, the daughter of American millionaire J. Preston Peters. Freddie pays a visit to his friend R. Jones, hoping to \"recover\" some letters he sent in the past to a certain chorus girl, feeling they might be dangerous in her hands, especially following the recent embarrassment of his cousin Lord Percy Stockheath. He pays Jones \u00c2\u0141500 to sort things out for him.\nClarence Threepwood, the elderly Earl of Emsworth, and Freddie Threepwood's father, calls on J. Preston Peters, Aline's father, who is a passionate collector of Egyptian scarabs. Peters shows him the most precious piece in his collection: a 4th dynasty Cheops. Mr. Peters is called to the telephone, and Lord Emsworth absently-mindedly puts the scarab into his pocket.\nAline Peters has lunch with her old friend George Emerson, a Hong Kong police officer who wishes to marry her. He proposes to her once more, and tells her that, having befriended Freddie Threepwood, he has been invited to Blandings.\nMr Peters discovers the disappearance of his scarab, and suspects the Earl, but cannot confront him for fear of endangering his daughter's marriage. The Earl has already forgotten everything that happened, and thinks the scarab was a gift of Mr Peters.\nR. Jones finds the address of Freddie's ex-sweetheart, Joan Valentine, who tells him she has long since destroyed any letters she may have had from Freddie. As he is leaving, Aline Peters, a close friend of Joan, arrives on a visit, allowing the suspicious Jones to listen at the door. He hears Aline's father is offering \u00c2\u01411,000 to anybody that can retrieve his scarab. Joan decides that she will go herself to Blandings Castle, posing as Aline's maid, recover the scarab and scoop the reward.\nAshe, following Joan's advice, scours the adverts in the newspaper, and seeing one which grabs his attention, he goes along to an interview with Mr. Peters, who is looking for somebody to pose as his valet and steal the scarab. Ashe, showing Peters some pep, gets the job.\nAshe tells Joan about this, and they both take the train to Blandings. During the trip Joan warns Ashe of the highly complicated system of etiquette observed among servants of a large house. She hopes her words will persuade him to give up his quest and remove himself as her competitor for the reward, but he resolves to do his best.\nAfter their arrival, Ashe meets Baxter, the Earl's efficient and suspicious secretary, on the way to Mr Peters' room, addressing him in a highly un-valet-like manner. He finds that Mr Peters, like Beach, the butler at the castle, has problems with his stomach, so persuades him to do some exercise and stop smoking cigars.\nAt night, Ashe and Joan are both trying to get at the scarab when the watchful Baxter hears them. Ashe, with his prepared excuse of reading to the insomniac Mr Peters, helps Joan escape. Next morning, Ashe and Joan decide to become allies and, after flipping a coin, that Ashe will take first try at steaing the scarab.\nAline is following the same diet as her father, composed mainly of legumes, and George, worrying she is suffering from malnutrition, prepares a feast to bring to her at night. As he makes his way to her room, he and Ashe collide in the dark hall of the castle and start a noisy fight. Baxter rushes in, but by the time the lights come on, Ashe and George have fled, leaving Baxter surrounded by food and broken china. He is blamed for waking everyone, and roundly criticised by his employer, Lord Emsworth, for sneaking food in the middle of the night.\nThe next night is Joan's turn, but she finds the scarab is already gone. The following morning, Ashe finds that Freddie needs money to pay R. Jones for the letters to Joan; he confronts Freddie, who confesses to the theft, and Ashe gets the scarab and gives it to the rightful owner, Mr Peters.\nGeorge Emerson, recalled to Hong Kong, sadly wishes Aline good luck with Freddie; Aline, her mothering instinct finally aroused by his disappointment, decides to leave Freddie and elope with him. Ashe and Joan finally realise they are made for each other, and enter Mr Peters' employ. Lord Emsworth agrees to let Freddie return to London, on condition he doesn't make a fool of himself again.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Something New, by P. G.

Out in Piccadilly its heartening warmth seemed to infuse\ninto traffic and pedestrians alike a novel jauntiness, so that\nbus drivers jested and even the lips of chauffeurs uncurled into\nnot unkindly smiles. Policemen whistled at their posts--clerks,\non their way to work; beggars approached the task of trying to\npersuade perfect strangers to bear the burden of their\nmaintenance with that optimistic vim which makes all the\ndifference. It was one of those happy mornings.\n\nAt nine o'clock precisely the door of Number Seven Arundell\nStreet, Leicester Square, opened and a young man stepped out.\n\nOf all the spots in London which may fairly be described as\nbackwaters there is none that answers so completely to the\ndescription as Arundell Street, Leicester Square. Passing along\nthe north sidewalk of the square, just where it joins Piccadilly,\nyou hardly notice the bottleneck opening of the tiny cul-de-sac.\nDay and night the human flood roars past, ignoring it. Arundell\nStreet is less than forty yards in length; and, though there are\ntwo hotels in it, they are not fashionable hotels. It is just a\nbackwater.\n\nIn shape Arundell Street is exactly like one of those flat stone\njars in which Italian wine of the cheaper sort is stored. The\nnarrow neck that leads off Leicester Square opens abruptly into a\nsmall court. Hotels occupy two sides of this; the third is at\npresent given up to rooming houses for the impecunious. These are\nalways just going to be pulled down in the name of progress to\nmake room for another hotel, but they never do meet with that\nfate; and as they stand now so will they in all probability stand\nfor generations to come.\n\nThey provide single rooms of moderate size, the bed modestly\nhidden during the day behind a battered screen. The rooms contain\na table, an easy-chair, a hard chair, a bureau, and a round tin\nbath, which, like the bed, goes into hiding after its useful work\nis performed. And you may rent one of these rooms, with breakfast\nthrown in, for five dollars a week.\n\nAshe Marson had done so. He had rented the second-floor front of\nNumber Seven.\n\nTwenty-six years before this story opens there had been born to\nJoseph Marson, minister, and Sarah his wife, of Hayling,\nMassachusetts, in the United States of America, a son. This son,\nchristened Ashe after a wealthy uncle who subsequently\ndouble-crossed them by leaving his money to charities, in due\ncourse proceeded to Harvard to study for the ministry. So far as\ncan be ascertained from contemporary records, he did not study a\ngreat deal for the ministry; but he did succeed in running the\nmile in four minutes and a half and the half mile at a\ncorrespondingly rapid speed, and his researches in the art of\nlong jumping won him the respect of all.\n\nThat he should be awarded, at the conclusion of his Harvard\ncareer, one of those scholarships at Oxford University instituted\nby the late Cecil Rhodes for the encouragement of the liberal\narts, was a natural sequence of events.\n\nThat was how Ashe came to be in England.\n\nThe rest of Ashe's history follows almost automatically. He won\nhis blue for athletics at Oxford, and gladdened thousands by\nwinning the mile and the half mile two years in succession\nagainst Cambridge at Queen's Club. But owing to the pressure of\nother engagements he unfortunately omitted to do any studying,\nand when the hour of parting arrived he was peculiarly unfitted\nfor any of the learned professions. Having, however, managed to\nobtain a sort of degree, enough to enable him to call himself a\nBachelor of Arts, and realizing that you can fool some of the\npeople some of the time, he applied for and secured a series of\nprivate tutorships.\n\nA private tutor is a sort of blend of poor relation and\nnursemaid, and few of the stately homes of England are without\none. He is supposed to instill learning and deportment into the\nsmall son of the house; but what he is really there for is to\nprevent the latter from being a nuisance to his parents when he\nis home from school on his vacation.\n\nHaving saved a little money at this dreadful trade, Ashe came to\nLondon and tried newspaper work. After two years of moderate\nsuccess he got in touch with the Mammoth Publishing Company.\n\nThe Mammoth Publishing Company, which controls several important\nnewspapers, a few weekly journals, and a number of other things,\ndoes not disdain the pennies of the office boy and the junior\nclerk. One of its many profitable ventures is a series of\npaper-covered tales of crime and adventure. It was here that Ashe\nfound his niche. Those adventures of Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator, which are so popular with a certain section of the\nreading public, were his work.\n\nUntil the advent of Ashe and Mr. Quayle, the British Pluck\nLibrary had been written by many hands and had included the\nadventures of many heroes: but in Gridley Quayle the proprietors\nheld that the ideal had been reached, and Ashe received a\ncommission to conduct the entire British Pluck\nLibrary--monthly--himself. On the meager salary paid him for\nthese labors he had been supporting himself ever since.\n\nThat was how Ashe came to be in Arundell Street, Leicester Square,\non this May morning.\n\nHe was a tall, well-built, fit-looking young man, with a clear\neye and a strong chin; and he was dressed, as he closed the front\ndoor behind him, in a sweater, flannel trousers, and rubber-soled\ngymnasium shoes. In one hand he bore a pair of Indian clubs, in\nthe other a skipping rope.\n\nHaving drawn in and expelled the morning air in a measured and\nsolemn fashion, which the initiated observer would have\nrecognized as that scientific deep breathing so popular nowadays,\nhe laid down his clubs, adjusted his rope and began to skip.\n\nWhen he had taken the second-floor front of Number Seven, three\nmonths before, Ashe Marson had realized that he must forego those\nmorning exercises which had become a second nature to him, or\nelse defy London's unwritten law and brave London's mockery. He\nhad not hesitated long. Physical fitness was his gospel. On the\nsubject of exercise he was confessedly a crank. He decided to\ndefy London.\n\nThe first time he appeared in Arundell Street in his sweater and\nflannels he had barely whirled his Indian clubs once around his\nhead before he had attracted the following audience:\n\n  a) Two cabmen--one intoxicated;\n  b) Four waiters from the Hotel Mathis;\n  c) Six waiters from the Hotel Previtali;\n  d) Six chambermaids from the Hotel Mathis;\n  e) Five chambermaids from the Hotel Previtali;\n  f) The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis;\n  g) The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali;\n  h) A street cleaner;\n  i) Eleven nondescript loafers;\n  j) Twenty-seven children;\n  k) A cat.\n\nThey all laughed--even the cat--and kept on laughing. The\nintoxicated cabman called Ashe \"Sunny Jim.\" And Ashe kept on\nswinging his clubs.\n\nA month later, such is the magic of perseverance, his audience\nhad narrowed down to the twenty-seven children. They still\nlaughed, but without that ringing conviction which the\nsympathetic support of their elders had lent them.\n\nAnd now, after three months, the neighborhood, having accepted\nAshe and his morning exercises as a natural phenomenon, paid him\nno further attention.\n\nOn this particular morning Ashe Marson skipped with even more\nthan his usual vigor. This was because he wished to expel by\nmeans of physical fatigue a small devil of discontent, of whose\npresence within him he had been aware ever since getting out of\nbed. It is in the Spring that the ache for the larger life comes\non us, and this was a particularly mellow Spring morning. It was\nthe sort of morning when the air gives us a feeling of\nanticipation--a feeling that, on a day like this, things surely\ncannot go jogging along in the same dull old groove; a\npremonition that something romantic and exciting is about to\nhappen to us.\n\nBut the southwest wind of Spring brings also remorse. We catch\nthe vague spirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent\nyouth.\n\nAshe was doing this. Even as he skipped, he was conscious of a\nwish that he had studied harder at college and was now in a\nposition to be doing something better than hack work for a\nsoulless publishing company. Never before had he been so\ncompletely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into\nwhich he had fallen.\n\nSkipping brought no balm. He threw down his rope and took up the\nIndian clubs. Indian clubs left him still unsatisfied. The\nthought came to him that it was a long time since he had done his\nLarsen Exercises. Perhaps they would heal him.\n\nThe Larsen Exercises, invented by a certain Lieutenant Larsen, of\nthe Swedish Army, have almost every sort of merit. They make a\nman strong, supple, and slender. But they are not dignified.\nIndeed, to one seeing them suddenly and without warning for the\nfirst time, they are markedly humorous. The only reason why King\nHenry, of England, whose son sank with the White Ship, never\nsmiled again, was because Lieutenant Larsen had not then invented\nhis admirable exercises.\n\nSo complacent, so insolently unselfconscious had Ashe become in\nthe course of three months, owing to his success in inducing the\npopulace to look on anything he did with the indulgent eye of\nunderstanding, that it simply did not occur to him, when he\nabruptly twisted his body into the shape of a corkscrew, in\naccordance with the directions in the lieutenant's book for the\nconsummation of Exercise One, that he was doing anything funny.\n\nAnd the behavior of those present seemed to justify his\nconfidence. The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis regarded him\nwithout a smile. The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali might have\nbeen in a trance, for all the interest he displayed. The hotel\nemployees continued their tasks impassively. The children were\nblind and dumb. The cat across the way stropped its backbone\nagainst the railings unheeding.\n\nBut, even as he unscrambled himself and resumed a normal posture,\nfrom his immediate rear there rent the quiet morning air a clear\nand musical laugh. It floated out on the breeze and hit him like\na bullet.\n\nThree months ago Ashe would have accepted the laugh as\ninevitable, and would have refused to allow it to embarrass him;\nbut long immunity from ridicule had sapped his resolution. He\nspun round with a jump, flushed and self-conscious.\n\nFrom the window of the first-floor front of Number Seven a girl\nwas leaning. The Spring sunshine played on her golden hair and\nlit up her bright blue eyes, fixed on his flanneled and sweatered\nperson with a fascinated amusement. Even as he turned, the laugh\nsmote him afresh.\n\nFor the space of perhaps two seconds they stared at each other,\neye to eye. Then she vanished into the room.\n\nAshe was beaten. Three months ago a million girls could have\nlaughed at his morning exercises without turning him from his\npurpose. Today this one scoffer, alone and unaided, was\nsufficient for his undoing. The depression which exercise had\nbegun to dispel surged back on him. He had no heart to continue.\nSadly gathering up his belongings, he returned to his room, and\nfound a cold bath tame and uninspiring.\n\nThe breakfasts--included in the rent--provided by Mrs. Bell, the\nlandlady of Number Seven, were held by some authorities to be\nspecially designed to quell the spirits of their victims, should\nthey tend to soar excessively. By the time Ashe had done his best\nwith the disheveled fried egg, the chicory blasphemously called\ncoffee, and the charred bacon, misery had him firmly in its grip.\nAnd when he forced himself to the table, and began to try to\nconcoct the latest of the adventures of Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator, his spirit groaned within him.\n\nThis morning, as he sat and chewed his pen, his loathing for\nGridley seemed to have reached its climax. It was his habit, in\nwriting these stories, to think of a good title first, and then\nfit an adventure to it. And overnight, in a moment of\ninspiration, he had jotted down on an envelope the words: \"The\nAdventure of the Wand of Death.\"\n\nIt was with the sullen repulsion of a vegetarian who finds a\ncaterpillar in his salad that he now sat glaring at them.\n\nThe title had seemed so promising overnight--so full of strenuous\npossibilities. It was still speciously attractive; but now that\nthe moment had arrived for writing the story its flaws became\nmanifest.\n\nWhat was a wand of death? It sounded good; but, coming down to\nhard facts, what was it? You cannot write a story about a wand of\ndeath without knowing what a wand of death is; and, conversely,\nif you have thought of such a splendid title you cannot jettison\nit offhand. Ashe rumpled his hair and gnawed his pen.\n\nThere came a knock at the door.\n\nAshe spun round in his chair. This was the last straw! If he had\ntold Mrs. Ball once that he was never to be disturbed in the\nmorning on any pretext whatsoever, he had told her twenty times.\nIt was simply too infernal to be endured if his work time was to\nbe cut into like this. Ashe ran over in his mind a few opening\nremarks.\n\n\"Come in!\" he shouted, and braced himself for battle.\n\nA girl walked in--the girl of the first-floor front; the girl\nwith the blue eyes, who had laughed at his Larsen Exercises.\n\nVarious circumstances contributed to the poorness of the figure\nAshe cut in the opening moments of this interview. In the first\nplace, he was expecting to see his landlady, whose height was\nabout four feet six, and the sudden entry of somebody who was\nabout five feet seven threw the universe temporarily out of\nfocus. In the second place, in anticipation of Mrs. Bell's entry,\nhe had twisted his face into a forbidding scowl, and it was no\nslight matter to change this on the spur of the moment into a\npleasant smile. Finally, a man who has been sitting for half an\nhour in front of a sheet of paper bearing the words: \"The\nAdventure of the Wand of Death,\" and trying to decide what a wand\nof death might be, has not his mind under proper control.\n\nThe net result of these things was that, for perhaps half a\nminute, Ashe behaved absurdly. He goggled and he yammered. An\nalienist, had one been present, would have made up his mind about\nhim without further investigation. For an appreciable time he did\nnot think of rising from his seat. When he did, the combined leap\nand twist he executed practically amounted to a Larsen Exercise.\n\nNor was the girl unembarrassed. If Ashe had been calmer he would\nhave observed on her cheek the flush which told that she, too,\nwas finding the situation trying. But, woman being ever better\nequipped with poise than man, it was she who spoke first.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm disturbing you.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Ashe. \"Oh, no; not at all--not at all! No. Oh,\nno--not at all--no!\" And would have continued to play on the\ntheme indefinitely had not the girl spoken again.\n\n\"I wanted to apologize,\" she said, \"for my abominable rudeness in\nlaughing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know\nwhy I did it. I'm sorry.\"\n\nScience, with a thousand triumphs to her credit, has not yet\nsucceeded in discovering the correct reply for a young man to\nmake who finds himself in the appalling position of being\napologized to by a pretty girl. If he says nothing he seems\nsullen and unforgiving. If he says anything he makes a fool of\nhimself. Ashe, hesitating between these two courses, suddenly\ncaught sight of the sheet of paper over which he had been poring\nso long.\n\n\"What is a wand of death?\" he asked.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"A wand of death?\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\nThe delirium of the conversation was too much for Ashe. He burst\nout laughing. A moment later the girl did the same. And\nsimultaneously embarrassment ceased to be.\n\n\"I suppose you think I'm mad?\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Well, I should have been if you hadn't come in.\"\n\n\"Why was that?\"\n\n\"I was trying to write a detective story.\"\n\n\"I was wondering whether you were a writer.\"\n\n\"Do you write?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you ever read Home Gossip?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"You are quite right to speak in that thankful tone. It's a\nhorrid little paper--all brown-paper patterns and advice to the\nlovelorn and puzzles. I do a short story for it every week, under\nvarious names. A duke or an earl goes with each story. I loathe\nit intensely.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for your troubles,\" said Ashe firmly; \"but we are\nwandering from the point. What is a wand of death?\"\n\n\"A wand of death?\"\n\n\"A wand of death.\"\n\nThe girl frowned reflectively.\n\n\"Why, of course; it's the sacred ebony stick stolen from the\nIndian temple, which is supposed to bring death to whoever\npossesses it. The hero gets hold of it, and the priests dog him\nand send him threatening messages. What else could it be?\"\n\nAshe could not restrain his admiration.\n\n\"This is genius!\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Absolute genius. I see it all. The hero calls in Gridley Quayle,\nand that patronizing ass, by the aid of a series of wicked\ncoincidences, solves the mystery; and there am I, with another\nmonth's work done.\"\n\nShe looked at him with interest.\n\n\"Are you the author of Gridley Quayle?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you read him!\"\n\n\"I do not read him! But he is published by the same firm that\npublishes Home Gossip, and I can't help seeing his cover\nsometimes while I am waiting in the waiting room to see the\neditress.\"\n\nAshe felt like one who meets a boyhood's chum on a desert island.\nHere was a real bond between them.\n\n\"Does the Mammoth publish you, too? Why, we are comrades in\nmisfortune--fellow serfs! We should be friends. Shall we be\nfriends?\"\n\n\"I should be delighted.\"\n\n\"Shall we shake hands, sit down, and talk about ourselves a\nlittle?\"\n\n\"But I am keeping you from your work.\"\n\n\"An errand of mercy.\"\n\nShe sat down. It is a simple act, this of sitting down; but, like\neverything else, it may be an index to character. There was\nsomething wholly satisfactory to Ashe in the manner in which this\ngirl did it. She neither seated herself on the extreme edge of\nthe easy-chair, as one braced for instant flight; nor did she\nwallow in the easy-chair, as one come to stay for the week-end.\nShe carried herself in an unconventional situation with an\nunstudied self-confidence that he could not sufficiently admire.\n\nEtiquette is not rigid in Arundell Street; but, nevertheless, a\ngirl in a first-floor front may be excused for showing surprise\nand hesitation when invited to a confidential chat with a\nsecond-floor front young man whom she has known only five\nminutes. But there is a freemasonry among those who live in large\ncities on small earnings.\n\n\"Shall we introduce ourselves?\" said Ashe. \"Or did Mrs. Bell tell\nyou my name? By the way, you have not been here long, have you?\"\n\n\"I took my room day before yesterday. But your name, if you are\nthe author of Gridley Quayle, is Felix Clovelly, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no! Surely you don't think anyone's name could\nreally be Felix Clovelly? That is only the cloak under which I\nhide my shame. My real name is Marson--Ashe Marson. And yours?\"\n\n\"Valentine--Joan Valentine.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me the story of your life, or shall I tell mine\nfirst?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I have any particular story. I am an\nAmerican.\"\n\n\"Not American!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is too extraordinary, too much like a Gridley Quayle\ncoincidence. I am an American!\"\n\n\"Well, so are a good many other people.\"\n\n\"You miss the point. We are not only fellow serfs--we are fellow\nexiles. You can't round the thing off by telling me you were born\nin Hayling, Massachusetts, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I was born in New York.\"\n\n\"Surely not! I didn't know anybody was.\"\n\n\"Why Hayling, Massachusetts?\"\n\n\"That was where I was born.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I never heard of it.\"\n\n\"Strange. I know your home town quite well. But I have not yet\nmade my birthplace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall.\nI am beginning to realize that I am one of the failures.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Twenty-six.\"\n\n\"You are only twenty-six and you call yourself a failure? I think\nthat is a shameful thing to say.\"\n\n\"What would you call a man of twenty-six whose only means of\nmaking a living was the writing of Gridley Quayle stories--an\nempire builder?\"\n\n\"How do you know it's your only means of making a living? Why\ndon't you try something new?\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"How should I know? Anything that comes along. Good gracious, Mr.\nMarson; here you are in the biggest city in the world, with\nchances for adventure simply shrieking to you on every side.\"\n\n\"I must be deaf. The only thing I have heard shrieking to me on\nevery side has been Mrs. Bell--for the week's rent.\"\n\n\"Read the papers. Read the advertisement columns. I'm sure you\nwill find something sooner or later. Don't get into a groove. Be\nan adventurer. Snatch at the next chance, whatever it is.\"\n\nAshe nodded.\n\n\"Continue,\" he said. \"Proceed. You are stimulating me.\"\n\n\"But why should you want a girl like me to stimulate you? Surely\nLondon is enough to do it without my help? You can always find\nsomething new, surely? Listen, Mr. Marson. I was thrown on my own\nresources about five years ago--never mind how. Since then I have\nworked in a shop, done typewriting, been on the stage, had a\nposition as governess, been a lady's maid--\"\n\n\"A what! A lady's maid?\"\n\n\"Why not? It was all experience; and I can assure you I would\nmuch rather be a lady's maid than a governess.\"\n\n\"I think I know what you mean. I was a private tutor once. I\nsuppose a governess is the female equivalent. I have often\nwondered what General Sherman would have said about private\ntutoring if he expressed himself so breezily about mere war. Was\nit fun being a lady's maid?\"\n\n\"It was pretty good fun; and it gave me an opportunity of\nstudying the aristocracy in its native haunts, which has made me\nthe Gossip's established authority on dukes and earls.\"\n\nAshe drew a deep breath--not a scientific deep breath, but one of\nadmiration.\n\n\"You are perfectly splendid!\"\n\n\"Splendid?\"\n\n\"I mean, you have such pluck.\"\n\n\"Oh, well; I keep on trying. I'm twenty-three and I haven't\nachieved anything much yet; but I certainly don't feel like\nsitting back and calling myself a failure.\"\n\nAshe made a grimace.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I've got it.\"\n\n\"I meant you to,\" said Joan placidly. \"I hope I haven't bored you\nwith my autobiography, Mr. Marson. I'm not setting myself up as a\nshining example; but I do like action and hate stagnation.\"\n\n\"You are absolutely wonderful!\" said Ashe. \"You are a human\ncorrespondence course in efficiency, one of the ones you see\nadvertised in the back pages of the magazines, beginning, 'Young\nman, are you earning enough?' with a picture showing the dead\nbeat gazing wistfully at the boss' chair. You would galvanize a\njellyfish.\"\n\n\"If I have really stimulated you-----\"\n\n\"I think that was another slam,\" said Ashe pensively. \"Well, I\ndeserve it. Yes, you have stimulated me. I feel like a new man.\nIt's queer that you should have come to me right on top of\neverything else. I don't remember when I have felt so restless\nand discontented as this morning.\"\n\n\"It's the Spring.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is. I feel like doing something big and\nadventurous.\"\n\n\"Well, do it then. You have a Morning Post on the table. Have you\nread it yet?\"\n\n\"I glanced at it.\"\n\n\"But you haven't read the advertisement pages? Read them. They\nmay contain just the opening you want.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll do it; but my experience of advertisement pages is\nthat they are monopolized by philanthropists who want to lend you\nany sum from ten to a hundred thousand pounds on your note of\nhand only. However, I will scan them.\"\n\nJoan rose and held out her hand.\n\n\"Good-by, Mr. Marson. You've got your detective story to write,\nand I have to think out something with a duke in it by to-night;\nso I must be going.\" She smiled. \"We have traveled a good way\nfrom the point where we started, but I may as well go back to it\nbefore I leave you. I'm sorry I laughed at you this morning.\"\n\nAshe clasped her hand in a fervent grip.\n\n\"I'm not. Come and laugh at me whenever you feel like it. I like\nbeing laughed at. Why, when I started my morning exercises, half\nof London used to come and roll about the sidewalks in\nconvulsions. I'm not an attraction any longer and it makes me\nfeel lonesome. There are twenty-nine of those Larsen Exercises\nand you saw only part of the first. You have done so much for me\nthat if I can be of any use to you, in helping you to greet the\nday with a smile, I shall be only too proud. Exercise Six is a\nsure-fire mirth-provoker; I'll start with it to-morrow morning. I\ncan also recommend Exercise Eleven--a scream! Don't miss it.\"\n\n\"Very well. Well, good-by for the present.\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\nShe was gone; and Ashe, thrilling with new emotions, stared at\nthe door which had closed behind her. He felt as though he had\nbeen wakened from sleep by a powerful electric shock.\n\nClose beside the sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now\nluminous and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay\nthe Morning Post, the advertisement columns of which he had\npromised her to explore. The least he could do was to begin at\nonce.\n\nHis spirits sank as he did so. It was the same old game. A Mr.\nBrian MacNeill, though doing no business with minors, was\nwilling--even anxious--to part with his vast fortune to anyone\nover the age of twenty-one whose means happened to be a trifle\nstraitened. This good man required no security whatever; nor did\nhis rivals in generosity, the Messrs. Angus Bruce, Duncan\nMacfarlane, Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They, too,\nshowed a curious distaste for dealing with minors; but anyone of\nmaturer years could simply come round to the office and help\nhimself.\n\nAshe threw the paper down wearily. He had known all along that it\nwas no good. Romance was dead and the unexpected no longer\nhappened. He picked up his pen and began to write \"The Adventure\nof the Wand of Death.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIn a bedroom on the fourth floor of the Hotel Guelph in\nPiccadilly, the Honorable Frederick Threepwood sat in bed, with\nhis knees drawn up to his chin, and glared at the day with the\nglare of mental anguish. He had very little mind, but what he had\nwas suffering.\n\nHe had just remembered. It is like that in this life. You wake\nup, feeling as fit as a fiddle; you look at the window and see\nthe sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you begin to plan a\nperfectly corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you\nmet last night at the National Sporting Club; and then--you\nremember.\n\n\"Oh, dash it!\" said the Honorable Freddie. And after a moment's\npause: \"And I was feeling so dashed happy!\"\n\nFor the space of some minutes he remained plunged in sad\nmeditation; then, picking up the telephone from the table at his\nside, he asked for a number.\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"Hello!\" responded a rich voice at the other end of the wire.\n\n\"Oh, I say! Is that you, Dickie?\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"This is Freddie Threepwood. I say, Dickie, old top, I want to\nsee you about something devilish important. Will you be in at\ntwelve?\"\n\n\"Certainly. What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"I can't explain over the wire; but it's deuced serious.\"\n\n\"Very well. By the way, Freddie, congratulations on the\nengagement.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old man. Thanks very much, and so on--but you won't\nforget to be in at twelve, will you? Good-by.\"\n\nHe replaced the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed, for he\nhad heard the door handle turn. When the door opened he was\ngiving a correct representation of a young man wasting no time in\nbeginning his toilet for the day.\n\nAn elderly, thin-faced, bald-headed, amiably vacant man entered.\nHe regarded the Honorable Freddie with a certain disfavor.\n\n\"Are you only just getting up, Frederick?\"\n\n\"Hello, gov'nor. Good morning. I shan't be two ticks now.\"\n\n\"You should have been out and about two hours ago. The day is\nglorious.\"\n\n\"Shan't be more than a minute, gov'nor, now. Just got to have a\ntub and then chuck on a few clothes.\"\n\nHe disappeared into the bathroom. His father, taking a chair,\nplaced the tips of his fingers together and in this attitude\nremained motionless, a figure of disapproval and suppressed\nannoyance.\n\nLike many fathers in his rank of life, the Earl of Emsworth had\nsuffered much through that problem which, with the exception of\nMr. Lloyd-George, is practically the only fly in the British\naristocratic amber--the problem of what to do with the younger\nsons.\n\nIt is useless to try to gloss over the fact--in the aristocratic\nfamilies of Great Britain the younger son is not required.\n\nApart, however, from the fact that he was a younger son, and, as\nsuch, a nuisance in any case, the honorable Freddie had always\nannoyed his father in a variety of ways. The Earl of Emsworth was\nso constituted that no man or thing really had the power to\ntrouble him deeply; but Freddie had come nearer to doing it than\nanybody else in the world. There had been a consistency, a\nperseverance, about his irritating performances that had acted on\nthe placid peer as dripping water on a stone. Isolated acts of\nannoyance would have been powerless to ruffle his calm; but\nFreddie had been exploding bombs under his nose since he went to\nEton.\n\nHe had been expelled from Eton for breaking out at night and\nroaming the streets of Windsor in a false mustache. He had been\nsent down from Oxford for pouring ink from a second-story window\non the junior dean of his college. He had spent two years at an\nexpensive London crammer's and failed to pass into the army. He\nhad also accumulated an almost record series of racing debts,\nbesides as shady a gang of friends--for the most part vaguely\nconnected with the turf--as any young man of his age ever\ncontrived to collect.\n\nThese things try the most placid of parents; and finally Lord\nEmsworth had put his foot down. It was the only occasion in his\nlife when he had acted with decision, and he did it with the\naccumulated energy of years. He stopped his son's allowance,\nhaled him home to Blandings Castle, and kept him there so\nrelentlessly that until the previous night, when they had come up\ntogether by an afternoon train, Freddie had not seen London for\nnearly a year.\n\nPossibly it was the reflection that, whatever his secret\ntroubles, he was at any rate once more in his beloved metropolis\nthat caused Freddie at this point to burst into discordant song.\nHe splashed and warbled simultaneously.\n\nLord Emsworth's frown deepened and he began to tap his fingers\ntogether irritably. Then his brow cleared and a pleased smile\nflickered over his face. He, too, had remembered.\n\nWhat Lord Emsworth remembered was this: Late in the previous\nautumn the next estate to Blandings had been rented by an\nAmerican, a Mr. Peters--a man with many millions, chronic\ndyspepsia, and one fair daughter--Aline. The two families had\nmet. Freddie and Aline had been thrown together; and, only a few\ndays before, the engagement had been announced. And for Lord\nEmsworth the only flaw in this best of all possible worlds had\nbeen removed.\n\nYes, he was glad Freddie was engaged to be married to Aline\nPeters. He liked Aline. He liked Mr. Peters. Such was the relief\nhe experienced that he found himself feeling almost affectionate\ntoward Freddie, who emerged from the bathroom at this moment,\nclad in a pink bathrobe, to find the paternal wrath evaporated,\nand all, so to speak, right with the world.\n\nNevertheless, he wasted no time about his dressing. He was always\nill at ease in his father's presence and he wished to be\nelsewhere with all possible speed. He sprang into his trousers\nwith such energy that he nearly tripped himself up. As he\ndisentangled himself he recollected something that had slipped\nhis memory.\n\n\"By the way, gov'nor, I met an old pal of mine last night and\nasked him down to Blandings this week. That's all right, isn't\nit? He's a man named Emerson, an American. He knows Aline quite\nwell, he says--has known her since she was a kid.\"\n\n\"I do not remember any friend of yours named Emerson.\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I met him last night for the first\ntime. But it's all right. He's a good chap, don't you know!\n--and all that sort of rot.\"\n\nLord Emsworth was feeling too benevolent to raise the objections\nhe certainly would have raised had his mood been less sunny.\n\n\"Certainly; let him come if he wishes.\"\n\n\"Thanks, gov'nor.\"\n\nFreddie completed his toilet.\n\n\"Doing anything special this morning, gov'nor? I rather thought\nof getting a bit of breakfast and then strolling round a bit.\nHave you had breakfast?\"\n\n\"Two hours ago. I trust that in the course of your strolling you\nwill find time to call at Mr. Peters' and see Aline. I shall be\ngoing there directly after lunch. Mr. Peters wishes to show me\nhis collection of--I think scarabs was the word he used.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll look in all right! Don't you worry! Or if I don't I'll\ncall the old boy up on the phone and pass the time of day. Well,\nI rather think I'll be popping off and getting that bit of\nbreakfast--what?\"\n\nSeveral comments on this speech suggested themselves to Lord\nEmsworth. In the first place, he did not approve of Freddie's\nallusion to one of America's merchant princes as \"the old boy.\"\nSecond, his son's attitude did not strike him as the ideal\nattitude of a young man toward his betrothed. There seemed to be\na lack of warmth. But, he reflected, possibly this was simply\nanother manifestation of the modern spirit; and in any case it\nwas not worth bothering about; so he offered no criticism.\n\nPresently, Freddie having given his shoes a flick with a silk\nhandkerchief and thrust the latter carefully up his sleeve, they\npassed out and down into the main lobby of the hotel, where they\nparted--Freddie to his bit of breakfast; his father to potter\nabout the streets and kill time until luncheon. London was always\na trial to the Earl of Emsworth. His heart was in the country and\nthe city held no fascinations for him.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nOn one of the floors in one of the buildings in one of the\nstreets that slope precipitously from the Strand to the Thames\nEmbankment, there is a door that would be all the better for a\nlick of paint, which bears what is perhaps the most modest and\nunostentatious announcement of its kind in London. The grimy\nground-glass displays the words:\n\n                  R. JONES\n\nSimply that and nothing more. It is rugged in its simplicity.\nYou wonder, as you look at it--if you have time to look at and\nwonder about these things--who this Jones may be; and what is the\nbusiness he conducts with such coy reticence.\n\nAs a matter of fact, these speculations had passed through\nsuspicious minds at Scotland Yard, which had for some time taken\nnot a little interest in R. Jones. But beyond ascertaining that\nhe bought and sold curios, did a certain amount of bookmaking\nduring the flat-racing season, and had been known to lend money,\nScotland Yard did not find out much about Mr. Jones and presently\ndismissed him from its thoughts.\n\nOn the theory, given to the world by William Shakespeare, that it\nis the lean and hungry-looking men who are dangerous, and that\nthe \"fat, sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights,\" are\nharmless, R. Jones should have been above suspicion. He was\ninfinitely the fattest man in the west-central postal district of\nLondon. He was a round ball of a man, who wheezed when he walked\nupstairs, which was seldom, and shook like jelly if some tactless\nfriend, wishing to attract his attention, tapped him unexpectedly\non the shoulder. But this occurred still less frequently than his\nwalking upstairs; for in R. Jones' circle it was recognized that\nnothing is a greater breach of etiquette and worse form than to\ntap people unexpectedly on the shoulder. That, it was felt,\nshould be left to those who are paid by the government to do it.\n\nR. Jones was about fifty years old, gray-haired, of a mauve\ncomplexion, jovial among his friends, and perhaps even more\njovial with chance acquaintances. It was estimated by envious\nintimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances, specially\nwith young men of the upper classes, with large purses and small\nforeheads--was worth hundreds of pounds a year to him. There was\nsomething about his comfortable appearance and his jolly manner\nthat irresistibly attracted a certain type of young man. It was\nhis good fortune that this type of young man should be the type\nfinancially most worth attracting.\n\nFreddie Threepwood had fallen under his spell during his short\nbut crowded life in London. They had met for the first time at\nthe Derby; and ever since then R. Jones had held in Freddie's\nestimation that position of guide, philosopher and friend which\nhe held in the estimation of so many young men of Freddie's\nstamp.\n\nThat was why, at twelve o'clock punctually on this Spring day, he\ntapped with his cane on R. Jones' ground glass, and showed such\nsatisfaction and relief when the door was opened by the\nproprietor in person.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" said R. Jones rollickingly. \"Whom have we\nhere? The dashing bridegroom-to-be, and no other!\"\n\nR. Jones, like Lord Emsworth, was delighted that Freddie was\nabout to marry a nice girl with plenty of money. The sudden\nturning off of the tap from which Freddie's allowance had flowed\nhad hit him hard. He had other sources of income, of course; but\nfew so easy and unfailing as Freddie had been in the days of his\nprosperity.\n\n\"The prodigal son, by George! Creeping back into the fold after\nall this weary time! It seems years since I saw you, Freddie.\nThe old gov'nor put his foot down--didn't he?--and stopped the\nfunds. Damned shame! I take it that things have loosened up a bit\nsince the engagement was announced--eh?\"\n\nFreddie sat down and chewed the knob of his cane unhappily.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, Dickie, old top,\" he said, \"not so\nthat you could notice it, don't you know! Things are still pretty\nmuch the same. I managed to get away from Blandings for a night,\nbecause the gov'nor had to come to London; but I've got to go\nback with him on the three-o'clock train. And, as for money, I\ncan't get a quid out of him. As a matter of fact, I'm in the\ndeuce of a hole; and that's why I've come to you.\"\n\nEven fat, jovial men have their moments of depression. R. Jones'\nface clouded, and jerky remarks about hardness of times and\nlosses on the Stock Exchange began to proceed from him. As\nScotland Yard had discovered, he lent money on occasion; but he\ndid not lend it to youths in Freddie's unfortunate position.\n\n\"Oh, I don't want to make a touch, you know,\" Freddie hastened to\nexplain. \"It isn't that. As a matter of fact, I managed to raise\nfive hundred of the best this morning. That ought to be enough.\"\n\n\"Depends on what you want it for,\" said R. Jones, magically genial\nonce more.\n\nThe thought entered his mind, as it had so often, that the world\nwas full of easy marks. He wished he could meet the money-lender\nwho had been rash enough to advance the Honorable Freddie five\nhundred pounds. Those philanthropists cross our path too seldom.\n\nFreddie felt in his pocket, produced a cigarette case, and from\nit extracted a newspaper clipping.\n\n\"Did you read about poor old Percy in the papers? The case, you\nknow?\"\n\n\"Percy?\"\n\n\"Lord Stockheath, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Stockheath breach-of-promise case? I did more than that.\nI was in court all three days.\" R. Jones emitted a cozy chuckle.\n\"Is he a pal of yours? A cousin, eh? I wish you had seen him in\nthe witness box, with Jellicoe-Smith cross-examining him! The\nfunniest thing I ever heard! And his letters to the girl! They\nread them out in court; and of all--\"\n\n\"Don't, old man! Dickie, old top--please! I know all about it. I\nread the reports. They made poor old Percy look like an absolute\nass.\"\n\n\"Well, Nature had done that already; but I'm bound to say they\nimproved on Nature's work. I should think your Cousin Percy must\nhave felt like a plucked chicken.\"\n\nA spasm of pain passed over the Honorable Freddie's vacant face.\nHe wriggled in his chair.\n\n\"Dickie, old man, I wish you wouldn't talk like that. It makes me\nfeel ill.\"\n\n\"Why, is he such a pal of yours as all that?\"\n\n\"It's not that. It's--the fact is, Dickie, old top, I'm in\nexactly the same bally hole as poor old Percy was, myself!\"\n\n\"What! You have been sued for breach of promise?\"\n\n\"Not absolutely that--yet. Look here; I'll tell you the whole\nthing. Do you remember a show at the Piccadilly about a year ago\ncalled \"The Baby Doll\"? There was a girl in the chorus.\"\n\n\"Several--I remember noticing.\"\n\n\"No; I mean one particular girl--a girl called Joan Valentine.\nThe rotten part is that I never met her.\"\n\n\"Pull yourself together, Freddie. What exactly is the trouble?\"\n\n\"Well--don't you see?--I used to go to the show every other\nnight, and I fell frightfully in love with this girl--\"\n\n\"Without having met her?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, I was rather an ass in those days.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said R. Jones handsomely.\n\n\"I must have been or I shouldn't have been such an ass, don't you\nknow! Well, as I was saying, I used to write this girl letters,\nsaying how much I was in love with her; and--and--\"\n\n\"Specifically proposing marriage?\"\n\n\"I can't remember. I expect I did. I was awfully in love.\"\n\n\"How was that if you never met her?\"\n\n\"She wouldn't meet me. She wouldn't even come out to luncheon.\nShe didn't even answer my letters--just sent word down by the\nJohnny at the stage door. And then----\"\n\nFreddie's voice died away. He thrust the knob of his cane into\nhis mouth in a sort of frenzy.\n\n\"What then?\" inquired R. Jones.\n\nA scarlet blush manifested itself on Freddie's young face. His\neyes wandered sidewise. After a long pause a single word escaped\nhim, almost inaudible:\n\n\"Poetry!\"\n\nR. Jones trembled as though an electric current had been passed\nthrough his plump frame. His little eyes sparkled with merriment.\n\n\"You wrote her poetry!\"\n\n\"Yards of it, old boy--yards of it!\" groaned Freddie. Panic\nfilled him with speech. \"You see the frightful hole I'm in? This\ngirl is bound to have kept the letters. I don't remember whether\nI actually proposed to her or not; but anyway she's got enough\nmaterial to make it worth while to have a dash at an\naction--especially after poor old Percy has just got soaked for\nsuch a pile of money and made breach-of-promise cases the\nfashion, so to speak.\n\n\"And now that the announcement of my engagement is out she's\ncertain to get busy. Probably she has been waiting for something\nof the sort. Don't you see that all the cards are in her hands?\nWe couldn't afford to let the thing come into court. That poetry\nwould dish my marriage for a certainty. I'd have to emigrate or\nsomething! Goodness knows what would happen at home! My old\ngov'nor would murder me! So you see what a frightful hole I'm in,\ndon't you, Dickie, old man?\"\n\n\"And what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Why, to get hold of this girl and get back the letters--don't\nyou see? I can't do it myself, cooped up miles away in the\ncountry. And besides, I shouldn't know how to handle a thing\nlike that. It needs a chappie with a lot of sense and a\npersuasive sort of way with him.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the compliment, Freddie; but I should imagine that\nsomething a little more solid than a persuasive way would be\nrequired in a case like this. You said something a while ago\nabout five hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"Here it is, old man--in notes. I brought it on purpose. Will you\nreally take the thing on? Do you think you can work it for five\nhundred?\"\n\n\"I can have a try.\"\n\nFreddie rose, with an expression approximating to happiness on\nhis face. Some men have the power of inspiring confidence in some\nof their fellows, though they fill others with distrust. Scotland\nYard might look askance at R. Jones, but to Freddie he was all\nthat was helpful and reliable. He shook R. Jones' hand several\ntimes in his emotion.\n\n\"That's absolutely topping of you, old man!\" he said. \"Then I'll\nleave the whole thing to you. Write me the moment you have done\nanything, won't you? Good-by, old top, and thanks ever so much!\"\n\nThe door closed. R. Jones remained where he sat, his fingers\nstraying luxuriously among the crackling paper. A feeling of\ncomplete happiness warmed R. Jones' bosom. He was uncertain\nwhether or not his mission would be successful; and to be\ntruthful he was not letting that worry him much. What he was\ncertain of was the fact that the heavens had opened unexpectedly\nand dropped five hundred pounds into his lap.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth stood in the doorway of the Senior\nConservative Club's vast diningroom, and beamed with a vague\nsweetness on the two hundred or so Senior Conservatives who, with\nmuch clattering of knives and forks, were keeping body and soul\ntogether by means of the coffee-room luncheon. He might have been\nposing for a statue of Amiability. His pale blue eyes shone with\na friendly light through their protecting glasses; the smile of a\nman at peace with all men curved his weak mouth; his bald head,\nreflecting the sunlight, seemed almost to wear a halo.\n\nNobody appeared to notice him. He so seldom came to London these\ndays that he was practically a stranger in the club; and in any\ncase your Senior Conservative, when at lunch, has little leisure\nfor observing anything not immediately on the table in front of\nhim. To attract attention in the dining-room of the Senior\nConservative Club between the hours of one and two-thirty, you\nhave to be a mutton chop--not an earl.\n\nIt is possible that, lacking the initiative to make his way down\nthe long aisle and find a table for himself, he might have stood\nthere indefinitely, but for the restless activity of Adams, the\nhead steward. It was Adams' mission in life to flit to and fro,\nhauling would-be lunchers to their destinations, as a St. Bernard\ndog hauls travelers out of Alpine snowdrifts. He sighted Lord\nEmsworth and secured him with a genteel pounce.\n\n\"A table, your lordship? This way, your lordship.\" Adams\nremembered him, of course. Adams remembered everybody.\n\nLord Emsworth followed him beamingly and presently came to anchor\nat a table in the farther end of the room. Adams handed him the\nbill of fare and stood brooding over him like a providence.\n\n\"Don't often see your lordship in the club,\" he opened chattily.\n\nIt was business to know the tastes and dispositions of all the\nfive thousand or so members of the Senior Conservative Club and\nto suit his demeanor to them. To some he would hand the bill of\nfare swiftly, silently, almost brusquely, as one who realizes\nthat there are moments in life too serious for talk. Others, he\nknew, liked conversation; and to those he introduced the subject\nof food almost as a sub-motive.\n\nLord Emsworth, having examined the bill of fare with a mild\ncuriosity, laid it down and became conversational.\n\n\"No, Adams; I seldom visit London nowadays. London does not\nattract me. The country--the fields--the woods--the birds----\"\n\nSomething across the room seemed to attract his attention and his\nvoice trailed off. He inspected this for some time with bland\ninterest, then turned to Adams once more.\n\n\"What was I saying, Adams?\"\n\n\"The birds, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Birds! What birds? What about birds?\"\n\n\"You were speaking of the attractions of life in the country,\nyour lordship. You included the birds in your remarks.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes, yes! Oh, yes--to be sure. Do you\never go to the country, Adams?\"\n\n\"Generally to the seashore, your lordship--when I take my annual\nvacation.\"\n\nWhatever was the attraction across the room once more exercised\nits spell. His lordship concentrated himself on it to the\nexclusion of all other mundane matters. Presently he came out of\nhis trance again.\n\n\"What were you saying, Adams?\"\n\n\"I said that I generally went to the seashore, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Eh? When?\"\n\n\"For my annual vacation, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Your what?\"\n\n\"My annual vacation, your lordship.\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\nAdams never smiled during business hours--unless professionally,\nas it were, when a member made a joke; but he was storing up in\nthe recesses of his highly respectable body a large laugh, to be\nshared with his wife when he reached home that night. Mrs. Adams\nnever wearied of hearing of the eccentricities of the members of\nthe club. It occurred to Adams that he was in luck to-day. He was\nexpecting a little party of friends to supper that night, and he\nwas a man who loved an audience.\n\nYou would never have thought it, to look at him when engaged in\nhis professional duties, but Adams had built up a substantial\nreputation as a humorist in his circle by his imitations of\ncertain members of the club; and it was a matter of regret to him\nthat he got so few opportunities nowadays of studying the\nabsent-minded Lord Emsworth. It was rare luck--his lordship\ncoming in to-day, evidently in his best form.\n\n\"Adams, who is the gentleman over by the window--the gentleman in\nthe brown suit?\"\n\n\"That is Mr. Simmonds, your lordship. He joined us last year.\"\n\n\"I never saw a man take such large mouthfuls. Did you ever see a\nman take such large mouthfuls, Adams?\"\n\nAdams refrained from expressing an opinion, but inwardly he was\nthrilling with artistic fervor. Mr. Simmonds eating, was one of\nhis best imitations, though Mrs. Adams was inclined to object to\nit on the score that it was a bad example for the children. To be\nprivileged to witness Lord Emsworth watching and criticizing Mr.\nSimmonds was to collect material for a double-barreled character\nstudy that would assuredly make the hit of the evening.\n\n\"That man,\" went on Lord Emsworth, \"is digging his grave with his\nteeth. Digging his grave with his teeth, Adams! Do you take large\nmouthfuls, Adams?\"\n\n\"No, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Quite right. Very sensible of you, Adams--very sensible of you.\nVery sen---- What was I saying, Adams?\"\n\n\"About my not taking large mouthfuls, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Quite right--quite right! Never take large mouthfuls, Adams.\nNever gobble. Have you any children, Adams?\"\n\n\"Two, your lordship.\"\n\n\"I hope you teach them not to gobble. They pay for it in later\nlife. Americans gobble when young and ruin their digestions. My\nAmerican friend, Mr. Peters, suffers terribly from indigestion.\"\n\nAdams lowered his voice to a confidential murmur: \"If you will\npardon the liberty, your lordship--I saw it in the paper--\"\n\n\"About Mr. Peters' indigestion?\"\n\n\"About Miss Peters, your lordship, and the Honorable Frederick.\nMay I be permitted to offer my congratulations?\"\n\n\"Eh, Oh, yes--the engagement. Yes, yes, yes! Yes--to be sure.\nYes; very satisfactory in every respect. High time he settled\ndown and got a little sense. I put it to him straight. I cut off\nhis allowance and made him stay at home. That made him\nthink--lazy young devil!\"\n\nLord Emsworth had his lucid moments; and in the one that occurred\nnow it came home to him that he was not talking to himself, as he\nhad imagined, but confiding intimate family secrets to the head\nsteward of his club's dining-room. He checked himself abruptly,\nand with a slight decrease of amiability fixed his gaze on the\nbill of fare and ordered cold beef. For an instant he felt\nresentful against Adams for luring him on to soliloquize; but the\nnext moment his whole mind was gripped by the fascinating\nspectacle of Mr. Simmonds dealing with a wedge of Stilton cheese,\nand Adams was forgotten.\n\nThe cold beef had the effect of restoring his lordship to\ncomplete amiability, and when Adams in the course of his\nwanderings again found himself at the table he was once more\ndisposed for light conversation.\n\n\"So you saw the news of the engagement in the paper, did you,\nAdams?\"\n\n\"Yes, your lordship, in the Mail. It had quite a long piece about\nit. And the Honorable Frederick's photograph and the young lady's\nwere in the Mirror. Mrs. Adams clipped them out and put them in\nan album, knowing that your lordship was a member of ours. If I\nmay say so, your lordship--a beautiful young lady.\"\n\n\"Devilish attractive, Adams--and devilish rich. Mr. Peters is a\nmillionaire, Adams.\"\n\n\"So I read in the paper, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Damme! They all seem to be millionaires in America. Wish I knew\nhow they managed it. Honestly, I hope. Mr. Peters is an honest\nman, but his digestion is bad. He used to bolt his food. You\ndon't bolt your food, I hope, Adams?\"\n\n\"No, your lordship; I am most careful.\"\n\n\"The late Mr. Gladstone used to chew each mouthful thirty-three\ntimes. Deuced good notion if you aren't in a hurry. What cheese\nwould you recommend, Adams?\"\n\n\"The gentlemen are speaking well of the Gorgonzola.\"\n\n\"All right, bring me some. You know, Adams, what I admire about\nAmericans is their resource. Mr. Peters tells me that as a boy of\neleven he earned twenty dollars a week selling mint to saloon\nkeepers, as they call publicans over there. Why they wanted mint\nI cannot recollect. Mr. Peters explained the reason to me and it\nseemed highly plausible at the time; but I have forgotten it.\nPossibly for mint sauce. It impressed me, Adams. Twenty dollars\nis four pounds. I never earned four pounds a week when I was a\nboy of eleven; in fact, I don't think I ever earned four pounds a\nweek. His story impressed me, Adams. Every man ought to have an\nearning capacity. I was so struck with what he told me that I\nbegan to paint.\"\n\n\"Landscapes, your lordship?\"\n\n\"Furniture. It is unlikely that I shall ever be compelled to\npaint furniture for a living, but it is a consolation to me to\nfeel that I could do so if called on. There is a fascination\nabout painting furniture, Adams. I have painted the whole of my\nbedroom at Blandings and am now engaged on the museum. You would\nbe surprised at the fascination of it. It suddenly came back to\nme the other day that I had been inwardly longing to mess about\nwith paints and things since I was a boy. They stopped me when I\nwas a boy. I recollect my old father beating me with a walking\nstick--Tell me, Adams, have I eaten my cheese?\"\n\n\"Not yet, your lordship. I was about to send the waiter for it.\"\n\n\"Never mind. Tell him to bring the bill instead. I remember that\nI have an appointment. I must not be late.\"\n\n\"Shall I take the fork, your lordship?\"\n\n\"The fork?\"\n\n\"Your lordship has inadvertently put a fork in your coat pocket.\"\n\nLord Emsworth felt in the pocket indicated, and with the air of\nan inexpert conjurer whose trick has succeeded contrary to his\nexpectations produced a silver-plated fork. He regarded it with\nsurprise; then he looked wonderingly at Adams.\n\n\"Adams, I'm getting absent-minded. Have you ever noticed any\ntraces of absent-mindedness in me before?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, it's deuced peculiar! I have no recollection whatsoever of\nplacing that fork in my pocket . . . Adams, I want a taxicab.\" He\nglanced round the room, as though expecting to locate one by the\nfireplace.\n\n\"The hall porter will whistle one for you, your lordship.\"\n\n\"So he will, by George!--so he will! Good day, Adams.\"\n\n\"Good day, your lordship.\"\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth ambled benevolently to the door, leaving\nAdams with the feeling that his day had been well-spent. He gazed\nalmost with reverence after the slow-moving figure.\n\n\"What a nut!\" said Adams to his immortal soul.\n\nWafted through the sunlit streets in his taxicab, the Earl of\nEmsworth smiled benevolently on London's teeming millions. He was\nas completely happy as only a fluffy-minded old man with\nexcellent health and a large income can be. Other people worried\nabout all sorts of things--strikes, wars, suffragettes, the\ndiminishing birth rate, the growing materialism of the age, a\nscore of similar subjects.\n\nWorrying, indeed, seemed to be the twentieth-century specialty.\nLord Emsworth never worried. Nature had equipped him with a mind\nso admirably constructed for withstanding the disagreeableness of\nlife that if an unpleasant thought entered it, it passed out\nagain a moment later. Except for a few of life's fundamental\nfacts, such as that his check book was in the right-hand top\ndrawer of his desk; that the Honorable Freddie Threepwood was a\nyoung idiot who required perpetual restraint; and that when in\ndoubt about anything he had merely to apply to his secretary,\nRupert Baxter--except for these basic things, he never remembered\nanything for more than a few minutes.\n\nAt Eton, in the sixties, they had called him Fathead.\n\nHis was a life that lacked, perhaps, the sublimer emotions which\nraise man to the level of the gods; but undeniably it was an\nextremely happy one. He never experienced the thrill of ambition\nfulfilled; but, on the other hand, he never knew the agony of\nambition frustrated. His name, when he died, would not live\nforever in England's annals; he was spared the pain of worrying\nabout this by the fact that he had no desire to live forever in\nEngland's annals. He was possibly as nearly contented as a human\nbeing could be in this century of alarms and excursions.\n\nIndeed, as he bowled along in his cab and reflected that a really\ncharming girl, not in the chorus of any West End theater, a girl\nwith plenty of money and excellent breeding, had--in a moment,\ndoubtless, of mental aberration--become engaged to be married to\nthe Honorable Freddie, he told himself that life at last was\nabsolutely without a crumpled rose leaf.\n\nThe cab drew up before a house gay with flowered window boxes.\nLord Emsworth paid the driver and stood on the sidewalk looking\nup at this cheerful house, trying to remember why on earth he had\ntold the man to drive there.\n\nA few moments' steady thought gave him the answer to the riddle.\nThis was Mr. Peters' town house, and he had come to it by\ninvitation to look at Mr. Peters' collection of scarabs. To be\nsure! He remembered now--his collection of scarabs. Or was it\nArabs?\n\nLord Emsworth smiled. Scarabs, of course. You couldn't collect\nArabs. He wondered idly, as he rang the bell, what scarabs might\nbe; but he was interested in a fluffy kind of way in all forms of\ncollecting, and he was very pleased to have the opportunity of\nexamining these objects; whatever they were. He rather thought\nthey were a kind of fish.\n\nThere are men in this world who cannot rest; who are so\nconstituted that they can only take their leisure in the shape of\na change of work. To this fairly numerous class belonged Mr. J.\nPreston Peters, father of Freddie's Aline. And to this merit--or\ndefect--is to be attributed his almost maniacal devotion to that\nrather unattractive species of curio, the Egyptian scarab.\n\nFive years before, a nervous breakdown had sent Mr. Peters to a\nNew York specialist. The specialist had grown rich on similar\ncases and his advice was always the same. He insisted on Mr.\nPeters taking up a hobby.\n\n\"What sort of a hobby?\" inquired Mr. Peters irritably. His\ndigestion had just begun to trouble him at the time, and his\ntemper now was not of the best.\n\n\"Now my hobby,\" said the specialist, \"is the collecting of\nscarabs. Why should you not collect scarabs?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Mr. Peters, \"I shouldn't know one if you brought\nit to me on a plate. What are scarabs?\"\n\n\"Scarabs,\" said the specialist, warming to his subject, \"the\nEgyptian hieroglyphs.\"\n\n\"And what,\" inquired Mr. Peters, \"are Egyptian hieroglyphs?\"\n\nThe specialist began to wonder whether it would not have been\nbetter to advise Mr. Peters to collect postage stamps.\n\n\"A scarab,\" he said--\"derived from the Latin scarabeus--is\nliterally a beetle.\"\n\n\"I will not collect beetles!\" said Mr. Peters definitely. \"They\ngive me the Willies.\"\n\n\"Scarabs are Egyptian symbols in the form of beetles,\" the\nspecialist hurried on. \"The most common form of scarab is in the\nshape of a ring. Scarabs were used for seals. They were also\nemployed as beads or ornaments. Some scarabaei bear inscriptions\nhaving reference to places; as, for instance: 'Memphis is mighty\nforever.'\"\n\nMr. Peters' scorn changed to active interest.\n\n\"Have you got one like that?\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"A scarab boosting Memphis. It's my home town.\"\n\n\"I think it possible that some other Memphis was alluded to.\"\n\n\"There isn't any other except the one in Tennessee,\" said Mr.\nPeters patriotically.\n\nThe specialist owed the fact that he was a nerve doctor instead\nof a nerve patient to his habit of never arguing with his\nvisitors.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, \"you would care to glance at my collection.\nIt is in the next room.\"\n\nThat was the beginning of Mr. Peters' devotion to scarabs. At\nfirst he did his collecting without any love of it, partly\nbecause he had to collect something or suffer, but principally\nbecause of a remark the specialist made as he was leaving the\nroom.\n\n\"How long would it take me to get together that number of the\nthings?\" Mr. Peters inquired, when, having looked his fill on the\ndullest assortment of objects he remembered ever to have seen, he\nwas preparing to take his leave.\n\nThe specialist was proud of his collection. \"How long? To make a\ncollection as large as mine? Years, Mr. Peters. Oh, many, many\nyears.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you a hundred dollars I'll do it in six months!\"\n\nFrom that moment Mr. Peters brought to the collecting of scarabs\nthe same furious energy which had given him so many dollars and\nso much indigestion. He went after scarabs like a dog after rats.\nHe scooped in scarabs from the four corners of the earth, until\nat the end of a year he found himself possessed of what, purely\nas regarded quantity, was a record collection.\n\nThis marked the end of the first phase of--so to speak--the\nscarabaean side of his life. Collecting had become a habit with\nhim, but he was not yet a real enthusiast. It occurred to him\nthat the time had arrived for a certain amount of pruning and\nelimination. He called in an expert and bade him go through the\ncollection and weed out what he felicitously termed the \"dead\nones.\" The expert did his job thoroughly. When he had finished,\nthe collection was reduced to a mere dozen specimens.\n\n\"The rest,\" he explained, \"are practically valueless. If you are\nthinking of making a collection that will have any value in the\neyes of archeologists I should advise you to throw them away. The\nremaining twelve are good.\"\n\n\"How do you mean--good? Why is one of these things valuable and\nanother so much punk? They all look alike to me.\"\n\nAnd then the expert talked to Mr. Peters for nearly two hours\nabout the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, Osiris, Ammon, Mut,\nBubastis, dynasties, Cheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels,\nAmenophis III, Queen Taia, the Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the\nlake of Zarukhe, Naucratis, and the Book of the Dead. He did it\nwith a relish. He liked to do it.\n\nWhen he had finished, Mr. Peters thanked him and went to the\nbathroom, where he bathed his temples with eau de Cologne.\n\nThat talk changed J. Preston Peters from a supercilious\nscooper-up of random scarabs to what might be called a genuine\nscarab fan. It does not matter what a man collects; if Nature has\ngiven him the collector's mind he will become a fanatic on the\nsubject of whatever collection he sets out to make. Mr. Peters\nhad collected dollars; he began to collect scarabs with precisely\nthe same enthusiasm. He would have become just as enthusiastic\nabout butterflies or old china if he had turned his thoughts to\nthem; but it chanced that what he had taken up was the collecting\nof the scarab, and it gripped him more and more as the years went\non.\n\nGradually he came to love his scarabs with that love, surpassing\nthe love of women, which only collectors know. He became an\nexpert on those curious relics of a dead civilization. For a time\nthey ran neck and neck in his thoughts with business. When he\nretired from business he was free to make them the master passion\nof his life. He treasured each individual scarab in his\ncollection as a miser treasures gold.\n\nCollecting, as Mr. Peters did it, resembles the drink habit. It\nbegins as an amusement and ends as an obsession. He was gloating\nover his treasures when the maid announced Lord Emsworth.\n\nA curious species of mutual toleration--it could hardly be\ndignified by the title of friendship--had sprung up between these\ntwo men, so opposite in practically every respect. Each regarded\nthe other with that feeling of perpetual amazement with which we\nencounter those whose whole viewpoint and mode of life is foreign\nto our own.\n\nThe American's force and nervous energy fascinated Lord Emsworth.\nAs for Mr. Peters, nothing like the earl had ever happened to him\nbefore in a long and varied life. Each, in fact, was to the other\na perpetual freak show, with no charge for admission. And if\nanything had been needed to cement the alliance it would have\nbeen supplied by the fact that they were both collectors.\n\nThey differed in collecting as they did in everything else. Mr.\nPeters' collecting, as has been shown, was keen, furious,\nconcentrated; Lord Emsworth's had the amiable dodderingness that\nmarked every branch of his life. In the museum at Blandings\nCastle you could find every manner of valuable and valueless\ncurio. There was no central motive; the place was simply an\namateur junk shop. Side by side with a Gutenberg Bible for which\nrival collectors would have bidden without a limit, you would\ncome on a bullet from the field of Waterloo, one of a consignment\nof ten thousand shipped there for the use of tourists by a\nBirmingham firm. Each was equally attractive to its owner.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Peters,\" said Lord Emsworth sunnily, advancing into\nthe room, \"I trust I am not unpunctual. I have been lunching at\nmy club.\"\n\n\"I'd have asked you to lunch here,\" said Mr. Peters, \"but you\nknow how it is with me . . . I've promised the doctor I'll give\nthose nuts and grasses of his a fair trial, and I can do it\npretty well when I'm alone with Aline; but to have to sit by and\nsee somebody else eating real food would be trying me too high.\"\n\nLord Emsworth murmured sympathetically. The other's digestive\ntribulations touched a ready chord. An excellent trencherman\nhimself, he understood what Mr. Peters must suffer.\n\n\"Too bad!\" he said.\n\nMr. Peters turned the conversation into other channels.\n\n\"These are my scarabs,\" he said.\n\nLord Emsworth adjusted his glasses, and the mild smile\ndisappeared from his face, to be succeeded by a set look. A stage\ndirector of a moving-picture firm would have recognized the look.\nLord Emsworth was registering interest--interest which he\nperceived from the first instant would have to be completely\nsimulated; for instinct told him, as Mr. Peters began to talk,\nthat he was about to be bored as he had seldom been bored in his\nlife.\n\nMr. Peters, in his character of showman, threw himself into his\nwork with even more than his customary energy. His flow of speech\nnever faltered. He spoke of the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom,\nOsiris and Ammon; waxed eloquent concerning Mut, Bubastis,\nCheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels and Amenophis III;\nand became at times almost lyrical when touching on Queen Taia,\nthe Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis\nand the Book of the Dead. Time slid by.\n\n\"Take a look at this, Lord Emsworth.\"\n\nAs one who, brooding on love or running over business projects in\nhis mind, walks briskly into a lamppost and comes back to the\nrealities of life with a sense of jarring shock, Lord Emsworth\nstarted, blinked and returned to consciousness. Far away his mind\nhad been--seventy miles away--in the pleasant hothouses and shady\ngarden walks of Blandings Castle. He came back to London to find\nthat his host, with a mingled air of pride and reverence, was\nextending toward him a small, dingy-looking something.\n\nHe took it and looked at it. That, apparently, was what he was\nmeant to do. So far, all was well.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said--that blessed word; covering everything! He\nrepeated it, pleased at his ready resource.\n\n\"A Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty,\" said Mr. Peters fervently.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"A Cheops--of the Fourth Dynasty.\"\n\nLord Emsworth began to feel like a hunted stag. He could not go\non saying \"Ah!\" indefinitely; yet what else was there to say to\nthis curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thing?\n\n\"Dear me! A Cheops!\"\n\n\"Of the Fourth Dynasty!\"\n\n\"Bless my soul! The Fourth Dynasty!\"\n\n\"What do you think of that--eh?\"\n\nStrictly speaking, Lord Emsworth thought nothing of it; and he\nwas wondering how to veil this opinion in diplomatic words, when\nthe providence that looks after all good men saved him by causing\na knock at the door to occur. In response to Mr. Peters'\nirritated cry a maid entered.\n\n\"If you please, sir, Mr. Threepwood wishes to speak with you on\nthe telephone.\"\n\nMr. Peters turned to his guest. \"Excuse me for one moment.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lord Emsworth gratefully. \"Certainly,\ncertainly, certainly! By all means.\"\n\nThe door closed behind Mr. Peters. Lord Emsworth was alone. For\nsome moments he stood where he had been left, a figure with small\nsigns of alertness about it. But Mr. Peters did not return\nimmediately. The booming of his voice came faintly from some\ndistant region. Lord Emsworth strolled to the window and looked\nout.\n\nThe sun still shone brightly on the quiet street. Across the road\nwere trees. Lord Emsworth was fond of trees; he looked at these\napprovingly. Then round the corner came a vagrom man, wheeling\nflowers in a barrow.\n\nFlowers! Lord Emsworth's mind shot back to Blandings like a\nhoming pigeon. Flowers! Had he or had he not given Head Gardener\nThorne adequate instructions as to what to do with those\nhydrangeas? Assuming that he had not, was Thorne to be depended\non to do the right thing by them by the light of his own\nintelligence? Lord Emsworth began to brood on Head Gardener\nThorne.\n\nHe was aware of some curious little object in his hand. He\naccorded it a momentary inspection. It had no message for him.\nIt was probably something; but he could not remember what. He put\nit in his pocket and returned to his meditations.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAt about the hour when the Earl of Emsworth was driving to keep\nhis appointment with Mr. Peters, a party of two sat at a corner\ntable at Simpson's Restaurant, in the Strand. One of the two was\na small, pretty, good-natured-looking girl of about twenty; the\nother, a thick-set young man, with a wiry crop of red-brown hair\nand an expression of mingled devotion and determination. The girl\nwas Aline Peters; the young man's name was George Emerson. He,\nalso, was an American, a rising member in a New York law firm. He\nhad a strong, square face, with a dogged and persevering chin.\n\nThere are all sorts of restaurants in London, from the restaurant\nwhich makes you fancy you are in Paris to the restaurant which\nmakes you wish you were. There are palaces in Piccadilly, quaint\nlethal chambers in Soho, and strange food factories in Oxford\nStreet and Tottenham Court Road. There are restaurants which\nspecialize in ptomaine and restaurants which specialize in\nsinister vegetable messes. But there is only one Simpson's.\n\nSimpson's, in the Strand, is unique. Here, if he wishes, the\nBriton may for the small sum of half a dollar stupefy himself\nwith food. The god of fatted plenty has the place under his\nprotection. Its keynote is solid comfort.\n\nIt is a pleasant, soothing, hearty place--a restful temple of\nfood. No strident orchestra forces the diner to bolt beef in\nragtime. No long central aisle distracts his attention with its\nstream of new arrivals. There he sits, alone with his food, while\nwhite-robed priests, wheeling their smoking trucks, move to and\nfro, ever ready with fresh supplies.\n\nAll round the room--some at small tables, some at large tables\n--the worshipers sit, in their eyes that resolute, concentrated\nlook which is the peculiar property of the British luncher,\nex-President Roosevelt's man-eating fish, and the American army\nworm.\n\nConversation does not flourish at Simpson's. Only two of all\nthose present on this occasion showed any disposition toward\nchattiness. They were Aline Peters and her escort.\n\n\"The girl you ought to marry,\" Aline was saying, \"is Joan\nValentine.\"\n\n\"The girl I am going to marry,\" said George Emerson, \"is Aline\nPeters.\"\n\nFor answer, Aline picked up from the floor beside her an\nillustrated paper and, having opened it at a page toward the end,\nhanded it across the table.\n\nGeorge Emerson glanced at it disdainfully. There were two\nphotographs on the page. One was of Aline; the other of a heavy,\nloutish-looking youth, who wore that expression of pained\nglassiness which Young England always adopts in the face of a\ncamera.\n\nUnder one photograph were printed the words: \"Miss Aline Peters,\nwho is to marry the Honorable Frederick Threepwood in June\";\nunder the other: \"The Honorable Frederick Threepwood, who is to\nmarry Miss Aline Peters in June.\" Above the photographs was the\nlegend: \"Forthcoming International Wedding. Son of the Earl of\nEmsworth to marry American heiress.\" In one corner of the picture\na Cupid, draped in the Stars and Stripes, aimed his bow at the\ngentleman; in the other another Cupid, clad in a natty Union\nJack, was drawing a bead on the lady.\n\nThe subeditor had done his work well. He had not been ambiguous.\nWhat he intended to convey to the reader was that Miss Aline\nPeters, of America, was going to marry the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood, son of the Earl of Emsworth; and that was exactly the\nimpression the average reader got.\n\nGeorge Emerson, however, was not an average reader. The\nsubeditor's work did not impress him.\n\n\"You mustn't believe everything you see in the papers,\" he said.\n\"What are the stout children in the one-piece bathing suits\nsupposed to be doing?\"\n\n\"Those are Cupids, George, aiming at us with their little bow--\na pretty and original idea.\"\n\n\"Why Cupids?\"\n\n\"Cupid is the god of love.\"\n\n\"What has the god of love got to do with it?\"\n\nAline placidly devoured a fried potato. \"You're simply trying to\nmake me angry,\" she said; \"and I call it very mean of you. You\nknow perfectly well how fatal it is to get angry at meals. It was\neating while he was in a bad temper that ruined father's\ndigestion. George, that nice, fat carver is wheeling his truck\nthis way. Flag him and make him give me some more of that\nmutton.\"\n\nGeorge looked round him morosely.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"is England--this restaurant, I mean. You don't\nneed to go any farther. Just take a good look at this place and\nyou have seen the whole country and can go home again. You may\njudge a country by its meals. A people with imagination will eat\nwith imagination. Look at the French; look at ourselves. The\nEnglishman loathes imagination. He goes to a place like this and\nsays: 'Don't bother me to think. Here's half a dollar. Give me\nfood--any sort of food--until I tell you to stop.' And that's the\nprinciple on which he lives his life. 'Give me anything, and\ndon't bother me!' That's his motto.\"\n\n\"If that was meant to apply to Freddie and me, I think you're\nvery rude. Do you mean that any girl would have done for him, so\nlong as it was a girl?\"\n\nGeorge Emerson showed a trace of confusion. Being honest with\nhimself, he had to admit that he did not exactly know what he did\nmean--if he meant anything. That, he felt rather bitterly, was\nthe worst of Aline. She would never let a fellow's good things go\npurely as good things; she probed and questioned and spoiled the\nwhole effect. He was quite sure that when he began to speak he\nhad meant something, but what it was escaped him for the moment.\nHe had been urged to the homily by the fact that at a neighboring\ntable he had caught sight of a stout young Briton, with a red\nface, who reminded him of the Honorable Frederick Threepwood. He\nmentioned this to Aline.\n\n\"Do you see that fellow in the gray suit--I think he has been\nsleeping in it--at the table on your right? Look at the stodgy\nface. See the glassy eye. If that man sandbagged your Freddie and\ntied him up somewhere, and turned up at the church instead of\nhim, can you honestly tell me you would know the difference?\nCome, now, wouldn't you simply say, 'Why, Freddie, how natural\nyou look!' and go through the ceremony without a suspicion?\"\n\n\"He isn't a bit like Freddie.\"\n\n\"My dear girl, there isn't a man in this restaurant under the age\nof thirty who isn't just like Freddie. All Englishmen look\nexactly alike, talk exactly alike, and think exactly alike.\"\n\n\"And you oughtn't to speak of him as Freddie. You don't know\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. And, what is more, he expressly asked me to call him\nFreddie. 'Oh, dash it, old top, don't keep on calling me\nThreepwood! Freddie to pals!' Those were his very words.\"\n\n\"George, you're making this up.\"\n\n\"Not at all. We met last night at the National Sporting Club.\nPorky Jones was going twenty rounds with Eddie Flynn. I offered\nto give three to one on Eddie. Freddie, who was sitting next to\nme, took me in fivers. And if you want any further proof of your\nyoung man's pin-headedness; mark that! A child could have seen\nthat Eddie had him going. Eddie comes from Pittsburgh--God bless\nit! My own home town!\"\n\n\"Did your Eddie win?\"\n\n\"You don't listen--I told you he was from Pittsburgh. And\nafterward Threepwood chummed up with me and told me that to real\npals like me he was Freddie. I was a real pal, as I understood\nit, because I would have to wait for my money. The fact was, he\nexplained, his old governor had cut off his bally allowance.\"\n\n\"You're simply trying to poison my mind against him; and I don't\nthink it's very nice of you, George.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--poison your mind? I'm not poisoning your mind;\nI'm simply telling you a few things about him. You know perfectly\nwell that you don't love him, and that you aren't going to marry\nhim--and that you are going to marry me.\"\n\n\"How do you know I don't love my Freddie?\"\n\n\"If you can look me straight in the eyes and tell me you do, I\nwill drop the whole thing and put on a little page's dress and\ncarry your train up the aisle. Now, then!\"\n\n\"And all the while you're talking you're letting my carver get\naway,\" said Aline.\n\nGeorge called to the willing priest, who steered his truck toward\nthem. Aline directed his dissection of the shoulder of mutton by\nword and gesture.\n\n\"Enjoy yourself!\" said Emerson coldly.\n\n\"So I do, George; so I do. What excellent meat they have in\nEngland!\"\n\n\"It all comes from America,\" said George patriotically. \"And,\nanyway, can't you be a bit more spiritual? I don't want to sit\nhere discussing food products.\"\n\n\"If you were in my position, George, you wouldn't want to talk\nabout anything else. It's doing him a world of good, poor dear;\nbut there are times when I'm sorry Father ever started this\nfood-reform thing. You don't know what it means for a healthy\nyoung girl to try and support life on nuts and grasses.\"\n\n\"And why should you?\" broke out Emerson. \"I'll tell you what it\nis, Aline--you are perfectly absurd about your father. I don't\nwant to say anything against him to you, naturally; but--\"\n\n\"Go ahead, George. Why this diffidence? Say what you like.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I will. I'll give it to you straight. You know\nquite well that you have let your father bully you since you were\nin short frocks. I don't say it is your fault or his fault, or\nanybody's fault; I just state it as a fact. It's temperament, I\nsuppose. You are yielding and he is aggressive; and he has taken\nadvantage of it.\n\n\"We now come to this idiotic Freddie-marriage business. Your\nfather has forced you into that. It's all very well to say that\nyou are a free agent and that fathers don't coerce their\ndaughters nowadays. The trouble is that your father does. You let\nhim do what he likes with you. He has got you hypnotized; and you\nwon't break away from this Freddie foolishness because you can't\nfind the nerve. I'm going to help you find the nerve. I'm coming\ndown to Blandings Castle when you go there on Friday.\"\n\n\"Coming to Blandings!\"\n\n\"Freddie invited me last night. I think it was done by way of\ninterest on the money he owed me; but he did it and I accepted.\"\n\n\"But, George, my dear boy, do you never read the etiquette books\nand the hints in the Sunday papers on how to be the perfect\ngentleman? Don't you know you can't be a man's guest and take\nadvantage of his hospitality to try to steal his fiancee away\nfrom him?\"\n\n\"Watch me.\"\n\nA dreamy look came into Aline's eyes. \"I wonder what it feels\nlike, being a countess,\" she said.\n\n\"You will never know.\" George looked at her pityingly. \"My poor\ngirl,\" he said, \"have you been lured into this engagement in the\nbelief that pop-eyed Frederick, the Idiot Child, is going to be\nan earl some day? You have been stung! Freddie is not the heir.\nHis older brother, Lord Bosham, is as fit as a prize-fighter and\nhas three healthy sons. Freddie has about as much chance of\ngetting the title as I have.\"\n\n\"George, your education has been sadly neglected. Don't you know\nthat the heir to the title always goes on a yachting cruise, with\nhis whole family, and gets drowned--and the children too? It\nhappens in every English novel you read.\"\n\n\"Listen, Aline! Let us get this thing straight: I have been in\nlove with you since I wore knickerbockers. I proposed to you at\nyour first dance--\"\n\n\"Very clumsily.\"\n\n\"But sincerely. Last year, when I found that you had gone to\nEngland, I came on after you as soon as the firm could spare me.\nAnd I found you engaged to this Freddie excrescence.\"\n\n\"I like the way you stand up for Freddie. So many men in your\nposition might say horrid things about him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've nothing against Freddie. He is practically an imbecile\nand I don't like his face; outside of that he's all right. But\nyou will be glad later that you did not marry him. You are much\ntoo real a person. What a wife you will make for a hard-working\nman!\"\n\n\"What does Freddie work hard at?\"\n\n\"I am alluding at the moment not to Freddie but to myself. I\nshall come home tired out. Maybe things will have gone wrong\ndowntown. I shall be fagged, disheartened. And then you will come\nwith your cool, white hands and, placing them gently on my\nforehead--\"\n\nAline shook her head. \"It's no good, George. Really, you had\nbetter realize it. I'm very fond of you, but we are not suited!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You are too overwhelming--too much like a bomb. I think you must\nbe one of the supermen one reads about. You would want your own\nway and nothing but your own way. Now, Freddie will roll through\nhoops and sham dead, and we shall be the happiest pair in the\nworld. I am much too placid and mild to make you happy. You want\nsomebody who would stand up to you--somebody like Joan\nValentine.\"\n\n\"That's the second time you have mentioned this Joan Valentine.\nWho is she?\"\n\n\"She is a girl who was at school with me. We were the greatest\nchums--at least, I worshiped her and would have done anything for\nher; and I think she liked me. Then we lost touch with one\nanother and didn't meet for years. I met her on the street\nyesterday, and she is just the same. She has been through the\nmost awful times. Her father was quite rich; he died suddenly\nwhile he and Joan were in Paris, and she found that he hadn't\nleft a cent. He had been living right up to his income all the\ntime. His life wasn't even insured. She came to London; and, so\nfar as I could make out from the short talk we had, she has done\npretty nearly everything since we last met. She worked in a shop\nand went on the stage, and all sorts of things. Isn't it awful,\nGeorge!\"\n\n\"Pretty tough,\" said Emerson. He was but faintly interested in\nMiss Valentine.\n\n\"She is so plucky and full of life. She would stand up to you.\"\n\n\"Thanks! My idea of marriage is not a perpetual scrap. My notion\nof a wife is something cozy and sympathetic and soothing. That\nis why I love you. We shall be the happiest--\"\n\nAline laughed.\n\n\"Dear old George! Now pay the check and get me a taxi. I've\nendless things to do at home. If Freddie is in town I suppose he\nwill be calling to see me. Who is Freddie, do you ask? Freddie is\nmy fiance, George. My betrothed. My steady. The young man I'm\ngoing to marry.\"\n\nEmerson shook his head resignedly. \"Curious how you cling to that\nFreddie idea. Never mind! I'll come down to Blandings on Friday\nand we shall see what happens. Bear in mind the broad fact that\nyou and I are going to be married, and that nothing on earth is\ngoing to stop us.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIt was Aline Peters who had to bear the brunt of her father's\nmental agony when he discovered, shortly after Lord Emsworth had\nleft him, that the gem of his collection of scarabs had done the\nsame. It is always the innocent bystander who suffers.\n\n\"The darned old sneak thief!\" said Mr. Peters.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"Don't sit there saying 'Father!' What's the use of saying\n'Father!'? Do you think it is going to help--your saying\n'Father!'? I'd rather the old pirate had taken the house and lot\nthan that scarab. He knows what's what! Trust him to walk off\nwith the pick of the whole bunch! I did think I could leave the\nfather of the man who's going to marry my daughter for a second\nalone with the things. There's no morality among\ncollectors--none! I'd trust a syndicate of Jesse James, Captain\nKidd and Dick Turpin sooner than I would a collector. My Cheops\nof the Fourth Dynasty! I wouldn't have lost it for five thousand\ndollars!\"\n\n\"But, father, couldn't you write him a letter, asking for it\nback? He's such a nice old man! I'm sure he didn't mean to steal\nthe scarab.\"\n\nMr. Peters' overwrought soul blew off steam in the shape of a\npassionate snort.\n\n\"Didn't mean to steal it! What do you think he meant to do--take\nit away and keep it safe for me for fear I should lose it? Didn't\nmean to steal it! Bet you he's well-known in society as a\nkleptomaniac. Bet you that when his name is announced his friends\npick up their spoons and send in a hurry call to police\nheadquarters for a squad to come and see that he doesn't sneak\nthe front door. Of course he meant to steal it! He has a museum\nof his own down in the country. My Cheops is going to lend tone\nto that. I'd give five thousand dollars to get it back. If\nthere's a man in this country with the spirit to break into that\ncastle and steal that scarab and hand it back to me, there's five\nthousand waiting for him right here; and if he wants to he can\nknock that old safe blower on the head with a jimmy into the\nbargain.\"\n\n\"But, father, why can't you simply go to him and say it's yours\nand that you must have it back?\"\n\n\"And have him come back at me by calling off this engagement of\nyours? Not if I know it! You can't go about the place charging a\nman with theft and ask him to go on being willing to have his son\nmarry your daughter, can you? The slightest suggestion that I\nthought he had stolen this scarab and he would do the Proud Old\nEnglish Aristocrat and end everything. He's in the strongest\nposition a thief has ever been in. You can't get at him.\"\n\n\"I didn't think of that.\"\n\n\"You don't think at all. That's the trouble with you,\" said Mr.\nPeters.\n\nYears of indigestion had made Mr. Peters' temper, even when in a\nnormal mood, perfectly impossible; in a crisis like this it ran\namuck. He vented it on Aline because he had always vented his\nirritabilities on Aline; because the fact of her sweet, gentle\ndisposition, combined with the fact of their relationship, made\nher the ideal person to receive the overflow of his black moods.\nWhile his wife had lived he had bullied her. On her death Aline\nhad stepped into the vacant position.\n\nAline did not cry, because she was not a girl who was given to\ntears; but, for all her placid good temper, she was wounded. She\nwas a girl who liked everything in the world to run smoothly and\neasily, and these scenes with her father always depressed her.\nShe took advantage of a lull in Mr. Peters' flow of words and\nslipped from the room.\n\nHer cheerfulness had received a shock. She wanted sympathy. She\nwanted comforting. For a moment she considered George Emerson in\nthe role of comforter; but there were objections to George in\nthis character. Aline was accustomed to tease and chat with\nGeorge, but at heart she was a little afraid of him; and instinct\ntold her that, as comforter, he would be too volcanic and\nsupermanly for a girl who was engaged to marry another man in\nJune. George, as comforter, would be far too prone to trust to\naction rather than to the soothing power of the spoken word.\nGeorge's idea of healing the wound, she felt, would be to push\nher into a cab and drive to the nearest registrar's.\n\nNo; she would not go to George. To whom, then? The vision of Joan\nValentine came to her--of Joan as she had seen her yesterday,\nstrong, cheerful, self-reliant, bearing herself, in spite of\nadversity, with a valiant jauntiness. Yes; she would go and see\nJoan. She put on her hat and stole from the house.\n\nCuriously enough, only a quarter of an hour before, R. Jones had\nset out with exactly the same object in view.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAt almost exactly the hour when Aline Peters set off to visit her\nfriend, Miss Valentine, three men sat in the cozy smoking-room of\nBlandings Castle.\n\nThey were variously occupied. In the big chair nearest the door\nthe Honorable Frederick Threepwood--Freddie to pals--was reading.\nNext to him sat a young man whose eyes, glittering through\nrimless spectacles, were concentrated on the upturned faces of\nseveral neat rows of playing cards--Rupert Baxter, Lord\nEmsworth's invaluable secretary, had no vices, but he sometimes\nrelaxed his busy brain with a game of solitaire. Beyond Baxter, a\ncigar in his mouth and a weak highball at his side, the Earl of\nEmsworth took his ease.\n\nThe book the Honorable Freddie was reading was a small\npaper-covered book. Its cover was decorated with a color scheme\nin red, black and yellow, depicting a tense moment in the lives\nof a man with a black beard, a man with a yellow beard, a man\nwithout any beard at all, and a young woman who, at first sight,\nappeared to be all eyes and hair. The man with the black beard,\nto gain some private end, had tied this young woman with ropes to\na complicated system of machinery, mostly wheels and pulleys. The\nman with the yellow beard was in the act of pushing or pulling a\nlever. The beardless man, protruding through a trapdoor in the\nfloor, was pointing a large revolver at the parties of the second\npart.\n\nBeneath this picture were the words: \"Hands up, you scoundrels!\"\n\nAbove it, in a meandering scroll across the page, was: \"Gridley\nQuayle, Investigator. The Adventure of the Secret Six. By Felix\nClovelly.\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie did not so much read as gulp the adventure\nof the Secret Six. His face was crimson with excitement; his hair\nwas rumpled; his eyes bulged. He was absorbed.\n\nThis is peculiarly an age in which each of us may, if we do but\nsearch diligently, find the literature suited to his mental\npowers. Grave and earnest men, at Eton and elsewhere, had tried\nFreddie Threepwood with Greek, with Latin and with English; and\nthe sheeplike stolidity with which he declined to be interested\nin the masterpieces of all three tongues had left them with the\nconviction that he would never read anything.\n\nAnd then, years afterward, he had suddenly blossomed out as a\nstudent--only, it is true, a student of the Adventures of Gridley\nQuayle; but still a student. His was a dull life and Gridley\nQuayle was the only person who brought romance into it. Existence\nfor the Honorable Freddie was simply a sort of desert, punctuated\nwith monthly oases in the shape of new Quayle adventures. It was\nhis ambition to meet the man who wrote them.\n\nLord Emsworth sat and smoked, and sipped and smoked again, at\npeace with all the world. His mind was as nearly a blank as it is\npossible for the human mind to be. The hand that had not the task\nof holding the cigar was at rest in his trousers pocket. The\nfingers of it fumbled idly with a small, hard object.\n\nGradually it filtered into his lordship's mind that this small,\nhard object was not familiar. It was something new--something\nthat was neither his keys nor his pencil; nor was it his small\nchange. He yielded to a growing curiosity and drew it out. He\nexamined it. It was a little something, rather like a fossilized\nbeetle. It touched no chord in him. He looked at it with amiable\ndistaste.\n\n\"Now how in the world did that get there?\" he said.\n\nThe Honorable Freddie paid no attention to the remark. He was now\nat the very crest of his story, when every line intensified the\nthrill. Incident was succeeding incident. The Secret Six were\nhere, there and everywhere, like so many malignant June bugs.\n\nAnnabel, the heroine, was having a perfectly rotten\ntime--kidnapped, and imprisoned every few minutes. Gridley\nQuayle, hot on the scent, was covering somebody or other with his\nrevolver almost continuously. Freddie Threepwood had no time for\nchatting with his father. Not so Rupert Baxter. Chatting with\nLord Emsworth was one of the things for which he received his\nsalary. He looked up from his cards.\n\n\"Lord Emsworth?\"\n\n\"I have found a curious object in my pocket, Baxter. I was\nwondering how it got there.\"\n\nHe handed the thing to his secretary. Rupert Baxter's eyes lit up\nwith sudden enthusiasm. He gasped.\n\n\"Magnificent!\" he cried. \"Superb!\"\n\nLord Emsworth looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"It is a scarab, Lord Emsworth; and unless I am mistaken--and I\nthink I may claim to be something of an expert--a Cheops of the\nFourth Dynasty. A wonderful addition to your museum!\"\n\n\"Is it? By Gad! You don't say so, Baxter!\"\n\n\"It is, indeed. If it is not a rude question, how much did you\ngive for it, Lord Emsworth? It must have been the gem of\nsomebody's collection. Was there a sale at Christie's this\nafternoon?\"\n\nLord Emsworth shook his head. \"I did not get it at Christie's,\nfor I recollect that I had an important engagement which\nprevented my going to Christie's. To be sure; yes--I had promised\nto call on Mr. Peters and examine his collection of--Now I wonder\nwhat it was that Mr. Peters said he collected!\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters is one of the best-known living collectors of\nscarabs.\"\n\n\"Scarabs! You are quite right, Baxter. Now that I recall the\nepisode, this is a scarab; and Mr. Peters gave it to me.\"\n\n\"Gave it to you, Lord Emsworth?\"\n\n\"Yes. The whole scene comes back to me. Mr. Peters, after telling\nme a great many exceedingly interesting things about scarabs,\nwhich I regret to say I cannot remember, gave me this. And you\nsay it is really valuable, Baxter?\"\n\n\"It is, from a collector's point of view, of extraordinary\nvalue.\"\n\n\"Bless my soul!\" Lord Emsworth beamed. \"This is extremely\ninteresting, Baxter. One has heard so much of the princely\nhospitality of Americans. How exceedingly kind of Mr. Peters! I\nshall certainly treasure it, though I must confess that from a\npurely spectacular standpoint it leaves me a little cold.\nHowever, I must not look a gift horse in the mouth--eh, Baxter?\"\n\nFrom afar came the silver booming of a gong. Lord Emsworth rose.\n\n\"Time to dress for dinner? I had no idea it was so late. Baxter,\nyou will be going past the museum door. Will you be a good fellow\nand place this among the exhibits? You will know what to do with\nit better than I. I always think of you as the curator of my\nlittle collection, Baxter--ha-ha! Mind how you step when you are\nin the museum. I was painting a chair there yesterday and I think\nI left the paint pot on the floor.\"\n\nHe cast a less amiable glance at his studious son.\n\n\"Get up, Frederick, and go and dress for dinner. What is that\ntrash you are reading?\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie came out of his book much as a sleepwalker\nwakes--with a sense of having been violently assaulted. He looked\nup with a kind of stunned plaintiveness.\n\n\"Eh, gov'nor?\"\n\n\"Make haste! Beach rang the gong five minutes ago. What is that\nyou are reading?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, gov'nor--just a book.\"\n\n\"I wonder you can waste your time on such trash. Make haste!\"\n\nHe turned to the door, and the benevolent expression once more\nwandered athwart his face.\n\n\"Extremely kind of Mr. Peters!\" he said. \"Really, there is\nsomething almost Oriental in the lavish generosity of our\nAmerican cousins.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIt had taken R. Jones just six hours to discover Joan Valentine's\naddress. That it had not taken him longer is a proof of his\nenergy and of the excellence of his system of obtaining\ninformation; but R. Jones, when he considered it worth his while,\ncould be extremely energetic, and he was a past master at the art\nof finding out things.\n\nHe poured himself out of his cab and rang the bell of Number\nSeven. A disheveled maid answered the ring.\n\n\"Miss Valentine in?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nR. Jones produced his card.\n\n\"On important business, tell her. Half a minute--I'll write it.\"\n\nHe wrote the words on the card and devoted the brief period of\nwaiting to a careful scrutiny of his surroundings. He looked out\ninto the court and he looked as far as he could down the dingy\npassage; and the conclusions he drew from what he saw were\ncomplimentary to Miss Valentine.\n\n\"If this girl is the sort of girl who would hold up Freddie's\nletters,\" he mused, \"she wouldn't be living in a place like this.\nIf she were on the make she would have more money than she\nevidently possesses. Therefore, she is not on the make; and I am\nprepared to bet that she destroyed the letters as fast as she got\nthem.\"\n\nThose were, roughly, the thoughts of R. Jones as he stood in the\ndoorway of Number Seven; and they were important thoughts\ninasmuch as they determined his attitude toward Joan in the\napproaching interview. He perceived that this matter must be\nhandled delicately--that he must be very much the gentleman. It\nwould be a strain, but he must do it.\n\nThe maid returned and directed him to Joan's room with a brief\nword and a sweeping gesture.\n\n\"Eh?\" said R. Jones. \"First floor?\"\n\n\"Front,\" said the maid.\n\nR. Jones trudged laboriously up the short flight of stairs. It\nwas very dark on the stairs and he stumbled. Eventually, however,\nlight came to him through an open door. Looking in, he saw a girl\nstanding at the table. She had an air of expectation; so he\ndeduced that he had reached his journey's end.\n\n\"Miss Valentine?\"\n\n\"Please come in.\"\n\nR. Jones waddled in.\n\n\"Not much light on your stairs.\"\n\n\"No. Will you take a seat?\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nOne glance at the girl convinced R. Jones that he had been right.\nCircumstances had made him a rapid judge of character, for in the\nprofession of living by one's wits in a large city the first\nprinciple of offense and defense is to sum people up at first\nsight. This girl was not on the make.\n\nJoan Valentine was a tall girl with wheat-gold hair and eyes as\nbrightly blue as a November sky when the sun is shining on a\nfrosty world. There was in them a little of November's cold\nglitter, too, for Joan had been through much in the last few\nyears; and experience, even though it does not harden, erects a\ndefensive barrier between its children and the world.\n\nHer eyes were eyes that looked straight and challenged. They\ncould thaw to the satin blue of the Mediterranean Sea, where it\npurrs about the little villages of Southern France; but they did\nnot thaw for everybody. She looked what she was--a girl of\naction; a girl whom life had made both reckless and wary--wary of\nfriendly advances, reckless when there was a venture afoot.\n\nHer eyes, as they met R. Jones' now, were cold and challenging.\nShe, too, had learned the trick of swift diagnosis of character,\nand what she saw of R. Jones in that first glance did not impress\nher favorably.\n\n\"You wished to see me on business?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said R. Jones. \"Yes. . . . Miss Valentine, may I begin by\nbegging you to realize that I have no intention of insulting\nyou?\"\n\nJoan's eyebrows rose. For an instant she did her visitor the\ninjustice of suspecting that he had been dining too well.\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Let me explain: I have come here,\" R. Jones went on, getting\nmore gentlemanly every moment, \"on a very distasteful errand, to\noblige a friend. Will you bear in mind that whatever I say is\nsaid entirely on his behalf?\"\n\nBy this time Joan had abandoned the idea that this stout person\nwas a life-insurance tout, and was inclining to the view that he\nwas collecting funds for a charity.\n\n\"I came here at the request of the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"You never met him, Miss Valentine; but when you were in the\nchorus at the Piccadilly Theatre, I believe, he wrote you some\nvery foolish letters. Possibly you have forgotten them?\"\n\n\"I certainly have.\"\n\n\"You have probably destroyed them---eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly! I never keep letters. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, Miss Valentine, the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood is about to be married; and he thought that possibly,\non the whole, it would be better that the letters--and\npoetry--which he wrote you were nonexistent.\"\n\nNot all R. Jones' gentlemanliness--and during this speech he\ndiffused it like a powerful scent in waves about him--could hide\nthe unpleasant meaning of the words.\n\n\"He was afraid I might try to blackmail him?\" said Joan, with\nformidable calm.\n\nR. Jones raised and waved a fat hand deprecatingly.\n\n\"My dear Miss Valentine!\"\n\nJoan rose and R. Jones followed her example. The interview was\nplainly at an end.\n\n\"Please tell Mr. Threepwood to make his mind quite easy. He is in\nno danger.\"\n\n\"Exactly--exactly; precisely! I assured Threepwood that my visit\nhere would be a mere formality. I was quite sure you had no\nintention whatever of worrying him. I may tell him definitely,\nthen, that you have destroyed the letters?\"\n\n\"Yes. Good-evening.\"\n\n\"Good-evening, Miss Valentine.\"\n\nThe closing of the door behind him left him in total darkness,\nbut he hardly liked to return and ask Joan to reopen it in order\nto light him on his way. He was glad to be out of her presence.\nHe was used to being looked at in an unfriendly way by his\nfellows, but there had been something in Joan's eyes that had\ncuriously discomfited him.\n\nR. Jones groped his way down, relieved that all was over and had\nended well. He believed what she had told him, and he could\nconscientiously assure Freddie that the prospect of his sharing\nthe fate of poor old Percy was nonexistent. It is true that he\nproposed to add in his report that the destruction of the letters\nhad been purchased with difficulty, at a cost of just five\nhundred pounds; but that was a mere business formality.\n\nHe had almost reached the last step when there was a ring at the\nfront door. With what he was afterward wont to call an\ninspiration, he retreated with unusual nimbleness until he had\nalmost reached Joan's door again. Then he leaned over the\nbanister and listened.\n\nThe disheveled maid opened the door. A girl's voice spoke:\n\n\"Is Miss Valentine in?\"\n\n\"She's in; but she's engaged.\"\n\n\"I wish you would go up and tell her that I want to see her. Say\nit's Miss Peters--Miss Aline Peters.\"\n\nThe banister shook beneath R. Jones' sudden clutch. For a moment\nhe felt almost faint. Then he began to think swiftly. A great\nlight had dawned on him, and the thought outstanding in his mind\nwas that never again would he trust a man or woman on the\nevidence of his senses. He could have sworn that this Valentine\ngirl was on the level. He had been perfectly satisfied with her\nstatement that she had destroyed the letters. And all the while\nshe had been playing as deep a game as he had come across in the\nwhole course of his professional career! He almost admired her.\nHow she had taken him in!\n\nIt was obvious now what her game was. Previous to his visit she\nhad arranged a meeting with Freddie's fiancee, with the view of\nopening negotiations for the sale of the letters. She had held\nhim, Jones, at arm's length because she was going to sell the\nletters to whoever would pay the best price. But for the accident\nof his happening to be here when Miss Peters arrived, Freddie and\nhis fiancee would have been bidding against each other and\nraising each other's price. He had worked the same game himself a\ndozen times, and he resented the entry of female competition into\nwhat he regarded as essentially a male field of enterprise.\n\nAs the maid stumped up the stairs he continued his retreat. He\nheard Joan's door open, and the stream of light showed him the\ndisheveled maid standing in the doorway.\n\n\"Ow, I thought there was a gentleman with you, miss.\"\n\n\"He left a moment ago. Why?\"\n\n\"There's a lady wants to see you. Miss Peters, her name is.\"\n\n\"Will you ask her to come up?\"\n\nThe disheveled maid was no polished mistress of ceremonies. She\nleaned down into the void and hailed Aline.\n\n\"She says will you come up?\"\n\nAline's feet became audible on the staircase. There were\ngreetings.\n\n\"Whatever brings you here, Aline?\"\n\n\"Am I interrupting you, Joan, dear?\"\n\n\"No. Do come in! I was only surprised to see you so late. I\ndidn't know you paid calls at this hour. Is anything wrong? Come\nin.\"\n\nThe door closed, the maid retired to the depths, and R. Jones\nstole cautiously down again. He was feeling absolutely\nbewildered. Apparently his deductions, his second thoughts, had\nbeen all wrong, and Joan was, after all, the honest person he had\nimagined at first sight. Those two girls had talked to each other\nas though they were old friends; as though they had known each\nother all their lives. That was the thing which perplexed R.\nJones.\n\nWith the tread of a red Indian, he approached the door and put\nhis ear to it. He found he could hear quite comfortably.\n\nAline, meantime, inside the room, had begun to draw comfort from\nJoan's very appearance, she looked so capable.\n\nJoan's eyes had changed the expression they had contained during\nthe recent interview. They were soft now, with a softness that\nwas half compassionate, half contemptuous. It is the compensation\nwhich life gives to those whom it has handled roughly in order\nthat they shall be able to regard with a certain contempt the\nsmall troubles of the sheltered. Joan remembered Aline of old,\nand knew her for a perennial victim of small troubles. Even in\ntheir schooldays she had always needed to be looked after and\ncomforted. Her sweet temper had seemed to invite the minor slings\nand arrows of fortune. Aline was a girl who inspired\nprotectiveness in a certain type of her fellow human beings. It\nwas this quality in her that kept George Emerson awake at nights;\nand it appealed to Joan now.\n\nJoan, for whom life was a constant struggle to keep the wolf\nwithin a reasonable distance from the door, and who counted that\nday happy on which she saw her way clear to paying her weekly\nrent and possibly having a trifle over for some coveted hat or\npair of shoes, could not help feeling, as she looked at Aline,\nthat her own troubles were as nothing, and that the immediate\nneed of the moment was to pet and comfort her friend. Her\nknowledge of Aline told her the probable tragedy was that she had\nlost a brooch or had been spoken to crossly by somebody; but it\nalso told her that such tragedies bulked very large on Aline's\nhorizon.\n\nTrouble, after all, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder;\nand Aline was far less able to endure with fortitude the loss of\na brooch than she herself to bear the loss of a position the\nemoluments of which meant the difference between having just\nenough to eat and starving.\n\n\"You're worried about something,\" she said. \"Sit down and tell me\nall about it.\"\n\nAline sat down and looked about her at the shabby room. By that\ncurious process of the human mind which makes the spectacle of\nanother's misfortune a palliative for one's own, she was feeling\noddly comforted already. Her thoughts were not definite and she\ncould not analyze them; but what they amounted to was that,\nthough it was an unpleasant thing to be bullied by a dyspeptic\nfather, the world manifestly held worse tribulations, which her\nfather's other outstanding quality, besides dyspepsia--wealth, to\nwit--enabled her to avoid.\n\nIt was at this point that the dim beginnings of philosophy began\nto invade her mind. The thing resolved itself almost into an\nequation. If father had not had indigestion he would not have\nbullied her. But, if father had not made a fortune he would not\nhave had indigestion. Therefore, if father had not made a fortune\nhe would not have bullied her. Practically, in fact, if father\ndid not bully her he would not be rich. And if he were not rich--\n\nShe took in the faded carpet, the stained wall paper and the\nsoiled curtains with a comprehensive glance. It certainly cut\nboth ways. She began to be a little ashamed of her misery.\n\n\"It's nothing at all; really,\" she said. \"I think I've been\nmaking rather a fuss about very little.\"\n\nJoan was relieved. The struggling life breeds moods of\ndepression, and such a mood had come to her just before Aline's\narrival. Life, at that moment, had seemed to stretch before her\nlike a dusty, weary road, without hope. She was sick of fighting.\nShe wanted money and ease, and a surcease from this perpetual\nrace with the weekly bills. The mood had been the outcome partly\nof R. Jones' gentlemanly-veiled insinuations, but still more,\nthough she did not realize it, of her yesterday's meeting with\nAline.\n\nMr. Peters might be unguarded in his speech when conversing with\nhis daughter--he might play the tyrant toward her in many ways;\nbut he did not stint her in the matter of dress allowance, and,\non the occasion when she met Joan, Aline had been wearing so\nParisian a hat and a tailor-made suit of such obviously expensive\nsimplicity that green-eyed envy had almost spoiled Joan's\npleasure at meeting this friend of her opulent days.\n\nShe had suppressed the envy, and it had revenged itself by\nassaulting her afresh in the form of the worst fit of the blues\nshe had had in two years.\n\nShe had been loyally ready to sink her depression in order to\nalleviate Aline's, but it was a distinct relief to find that the\nfeat would not be necessary.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said. \"Tell me what the very little thing was.\"\n\n\"It was only father,\" said Aline simply.\n\nJoan cast her mind back to the days of school and placed father\nas a rather irritable person, vaguely reputed to be something of\nan ogre in his home circle.\n\n\"Was he angry with you about something?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not exactly angry with me; but--well, I was there.\"\n\nJoan's depression lifted slightly. She had forgotten, in the\nstunning anguish of the sudden spectacle of that hat and that\ntailor-made suit, that Paris hats and hundred-and-twenty-dollar\nsuits not infrequently had what the vulgar term a string attached\nto them. After all, she was independent. She might have to murder\nher beauty with hats and frocks that had never been nearer Paris\nthan the Tottenham Court Road; but at least no one bullied her\nbecause she happened to be at hand when tempers were short.\n\n\"What a shame!\" she said. \"Tell me all about it.\"\n\nWith a prefatory remark that it was all so ridiculous, really,\nAline embarked on the narrative of the afternoon's events.\n\nJoan heard her out, checking a strong disposition to giggle. Her\nviewpoint was that of the average person, and the average person\ncannot see the importance of the scarab in the scheme of things.\nThe opinion she formed of Mr. Peters was of his being an\neccentric old gentleman, making a great to-do about nothing at\nall. Losses had to have a concrete value before they could\nimpress Joan. It was beyond her to grasp that Mr. Peters would\nsooner have lost a diamond necklace, if he had happened to\npossess one, than his Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty.\n\nIt was not until Aline, having concluded her tale, added one more\nstrand to it that she found herself treating the matter\nseriously.\n\n\"Father says he would give five thousand dollars to anyone who\nwould get it back for him.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\nThe whole story took on a different complexion for Joan. Money\ntalks. Mr. Peters' words might have been merely the rhetorical\noutburst of a heated moment; but, even discounting them, there\nseemed to remain a certain exciting substratum. A man who shouts\nthat he will give five thousand dollars for a thing may very well\nmean he will give five hundred, and Joan's finances were\nperpetually in a condition which makes five hundred dollars a sum\nto be gasped at.\n\n\"He wasn't serious, surely!\"\n\n\"I think he was,\" said Aline.\n\n\"But five thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"It isn't really very much to father, you know. He gave away a\nhundred thousand a year ago to a university.\"\n\n\"But for a grubby little scarab!\"\n\n\"You don't understand how father loves his scarabs. Since he\nretired from business, he has been simply wrapped up in them. You\nknow collectors are like that. You read in the papers about men\ngiving all sorts of money for funny things.\"\n\nOutside the door R. Jones, his ear close to the panel, drank in\nall these things greedily. He would have been willing to remain\nin that attitude indefinitely in return for this kind of special\ninformation; but just as Aline said these words a door opened on\nthe floor above, and somebody came out, whistling, and began to\ndescend the stairs.\n\nR. Jones stood not on the order of his going. He was down in the\nhall and fumbling with the handle of the front door with an\nagility of which few casual observers of his dimensions would\nhave deemed him capable. The next moment he was out in the\nstreet, walking calmly toward Leicester Square, pondering over\nwhat he had heard.\n\nMuch of R. Jones' substantial annual income was derived from\npondering over what he had heard.\n\nIn the room Joan was looking at Aline with the distended eyes of\none who sees visions or has inspirations. She got up. There are\noccasions when one must speak standing.\n\n\"Then you mean to say that your father would really give five\nthousand dollars to anyone who got this thing back for him?\"\n\n\"I am sure he would. But who could do it?\"\n\n\"I could,\" said Joan. \"And what is more, I'm going to!\"\n\nAline stared at her helplessly. In their schooldays, Joan had\nalways swept her off her feet. Then, she had always had the\nfeeling that with Joan nothing was impossible. Heroine worship,\nlike hero worship, dies hard. She looked at Joan now with the\nstricken sensation of one who has inadvertently set powerful\nmachinery in motion.\n\n\"But, Joan!\" It was all she could say.\n\n\"My dear child, it's perfectly simple. This earl of yours has\ntaken the thing off to his castle, like a brigand. You say you\nare going down there on Friday for a visit. All you have to do is\nto take me along with you, and sit back and watch me get busy.\"\n\n\"But, Joan!\"\n\n\"Where's the difficulty?\"\n\n\"I don't see how I could take you down very well.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.\"\n\n\"But what is your objection?\"\n\n\"Well--don't you see?--if you went down there as a friend of mine\nand were caught stealing the scarab, there would be just the\ntrouble father wants to avoid--about my engagement, you see, and\nso on.\"\n\nIt was an aspect of the matter that had escaped Joan. She frowned\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"I see. Yes, there is that; but there must be a way.\"\n\n\"You mustn't, Joan--really! don't think any more about it.\"\n\n\"Not think any more about it! My child, do you even faintly\nrealize what five thousand dollars--or a quarter of five thousand\ndollars--means to me? I would do anything for it--anything! And\nthere's the fun of it. I don't suppose you can realize that,\neither. I want a change. I've been grubbing away here on nothing\na week for years, and it's time I had a vacation. There must be a\nway by which you could get me down--Why, of course! Why didn't I\nthink of it before! You shall take me on Friday as your lady's\nmaid!\"\n\n\"But, Joan, I couldn't!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I--I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\"\n\nJoan advanced on her where she sat and grasped her firmly by the\nshoulders. Her face was inflexible.\n\n\"Aline, my pet, it's no good arguing. You might just as well\nargue with a wolf on the trail of a fat Russian peasant. I need\nthat money. I need it in my business. I need it worse than\nanybody has ever needed anything. And I'm going to have it! From\nnow on, until further notice, I am your lady's maid. You can give\nyour present one a holiday.\"\n\nAline met her eyes waveringly. The spirit of the old schooldays,\nwhen nothing was impossible where Joan was concerned, had her in\nits grip. Moreover, the excitement of the scheme began to attract\nher.\n\n\"But, Joan,\" she said, \"you know it's simply ridiculous. You\ncould never pass as a lady's maid. The other servants would find\nyou out. I expect there are all sorts of things a lady's maid has\ngot to do and not do.\"\n\n\"My dear Aline, I know them all. You can't stump me on\nbelow-stairs etiquette. I've been a lady's maid!\"\n\n\"Joan!\"\n\n\"It's quite true--three years ago, when I was more than usually\nimpecunious. The wolf was glued to the door like a postage stamp;\nso I answered an advertisement and became a lady's maid.\"\n\n\"You seem to have done everything.\"\n\n\"I have--pretty nearly. It's all right for you idle rich,\nAline--you can sit still and contemplate life; but we poor\nworking girls have got to hustle.\"\n\nAline laughed.\n\n\"You know, you always could make me do anything you wanted in the\nold days, Joan. I suppose I have got to look on this as quite\nsettled now?\"\n\n\"Absolutely settled! Oh, Aline, there's one thing you must\nremember: Don't call me Joan when I'm down at the castle. You\nmust call me Valentine.\"\n\nShe paused. The recollection of the Honorable Freddie had come to\nher. No; Valentine would not do!\n\n\"No; not Valentine,\" she went on--\"it's too jaunty. I used it\nonce years ago, but it never sounded just right. I want something\nmore respectable, more suited to my position. Can't you suggest\nsomething?\"\n\nAline pondered.\n\n\"Simpson?\"\n\n\"Simpson! It's exactly right. You must practice it. Simpson! Say\nit kindly and yet distantly, as though I were a worm, but a worm\nfor whom you felt a mild liking. Roll it round your tongue.\"\n\n\"Simpson.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Now once again--a little more haughtily.\"\n\n\"Simpson--Simpson--Simpson.\"\n\nJoan regarded her with affectionate approval.\n\n\"It's wonderful!\" she said. \"You might have been doing it all\nyour life.\"\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" asked Aline.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Joan. \"I was just thinking of something. There's\na young man who lives on the floor above this, and I was\nlecturing him yesterday on enterprise. I told him to go and find\nsomething exciting to do. I wonder what he would say if he knew\nhow thoroughly I am going to practice what I preach!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIn the morning following Aline's visit to Joan Valentine, Ashe\nsat in his room, the Morning Post on the table before him. The\nheady influence of Joan had not yet ceased to work within him;\nand he proposed, in pursuance of his promise to her, to go\ncarefully through the columns of advertisements, however\npessimistic he might feel concerning the utility of that action.\n\nHis first glance assured him that the vast fortunes of the\nphilanthropists, whose acquaintance he had already made in print,\nwere not yet exhausted. Brian MacNeill still dangled his gold\nbefore the public; so did Angus Bruce; so did Duncan Macfarlane\nand Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They still had the\nmoney and they still wanted to give it away.\n\nAshe was reading listlessly down the column when, from the mass\nof advertisements, one of an unusual sort detached itself.\n\n   WANTED: Young Man of good appearance, who is poor and\n   reckless, to undertake a delicate and dangerous enterprise.\n   Good pay for the right man. Apply between the hours of ten\n   and twelve at offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole,\n   3, Denvers Street, Strand.\n\nAnd as he read it, half past ten struck on the little clock on\nhis mantelpiece. It was probably this fact that decided Ashe. If\nhe had been compelled to postpone his visit to the offices of\nMessrs. Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole until the afternoon, it is\npossible that barriers of laziness might have reared themselves\nin the path of adventure; for Ashe, an adventurer at heart, was\nalso uncommonly lazy. As it was, however, he could make an\nimmediate start.\n\nPausing but to put on his shoes, and having satisfied himself by\na glance in the mirror that his appearance was reasonably good,\nhe seized his hat, shot out of the narrow mouth of Arundell Street\nlike a shell, and scrambled into a taxicab, with the feeling\nthat--short of murder--they could not make it too delicate and\ndangerous for him.\n\nHe was conscious of strange thrills. This, he told himself, was\nthe only possible mode of life with spring in the air. He had\nalways been partial to those historical novels in which the\ncharacters are perpetually vaulting on chargers and riding across\ncountry on perilous errands. This leaping into taxicabs to answer\nstimulating advertisements in the Morning Post was very much the\nsame sort of thing. It was with fine fervor animating him that he\nentered the gloomy offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole. His\nbrain was afire and he felt ready for anything.\n\n\"I have come in ans--\" he began, to the diminutive office boy,\nwho seemed to be the nearest thing visible to a Mainprice or a\nBoole.\n\n\"Siddown. Gottatakeyerturn,\" said the office boy; and for the\nfirst time Ashe perceived that the ante-room in which he stood\nwas crowded to overflowing.\n\nThis, in the circumstances, was something of a damper. He had\npictured himself, during his ride in the cab, striding into the\noffice and saying. \"The delicate and dangerous enterprise. Lead\nme to it!\" He had not realized until now that he was not the only\nman in London who read the advertisement columns of the Morning\nPost, and for an instant his heart sank at the sight of all this\ncompetition. A second and more comprehensive glance at his rivals\ngave him confidence.\n\nThe Wanted column of the morning paper is a sort of dredger,\nwhich churns up strange creatures from the mud of London's\nunderworld. Only in response to the dredger's operations do they\ncome to the surface in such numbers as to be noticeable, for as a\nrule they are of a solitary habit and shun company; but when they\ndo come they bring with them something of the horror of the\ndepths.\n\nIt is the saddest spectacle in the world--that of the crowd\ncollected by a Wanted advertisement. They are so palpably not\nwanted by anyone for any purpose whatsoever; yet every time they\ngather together with a sort of hopeful hopelessness. What they\nwere originally--the units of these collections--Heaven knows.\nFate has battered out of them every trace of individuality. Each\nnow is exactly like his neighbor--no worse; no better.\n\nAshe, as he sat and watched them, was filled with conflicting\nemotions. One-half of him, thrilled with the glamour of\nadventure, was chafing at the delay, and resentful of these poor\ncreatures as of so many obstacles to the beginning of all the\nbrisk and exciting things that lay behind the mysterious brevity\nof the advertisement; the other, pitifully alive to the tragedy\nof the occasion, was grateful for the delay.\n\nOn the whole, he was glad to feel that if one of these derelicts\ndid not secure the \"good pay for the right man,\" it would not be\nhis fault. He had been the last to arrive, and he would be the\nlast to pass through that door, which was the gateway of\nadventure--the door with Mr. Boole inscribed on its ground glass,\nbehind which sat the author of the mysterious request for\nassistance, interviewing applicants. It would be through their\nown shortcomings--not because of his superior attractions--if\nthey failed to please that unseen arbiter.\n\nThat they were so failing was plain. Scarcely had one scarred\nvictim of London's unkindness passed through before the bell\nwould ring; the office boy, who, in the intervals of frowning\nsternly on the throng, as much as to say that he would stand no\nnonsense, would cry, \"Next!\" and another dull-eyed wreck would\ndrift through, to be followed a moment later by yet another. The\none fact at present ascertainable concerning the unknown searcher\nfor reckless young men of good appearance was that he appeared to\nbe possessed of considerable decision of character, a man who did\nnot take long to make up his mind. He was rejecting applicants\nnow at the rate of two a minute.\n\nExpeditious though he was, he kept Ashe waiting for a\nconsiderable time. It was not until the hands of the fat clock\nover the door pointed to twenty minutes past eleven that the\noffice boy's \"Next!\" found him the only survivor. He gave his\nclothes a hasty smack with the palm of his hand and his hair a\nfleeting dab to accentuate his good appearance, and turned the\nhandle of the door of fate.\n\nThe room assigned by the firm to their Mr. Boole for his personal\nuse was a small and dingy compartment, redolent of that\natmosphere of desolation which lawyers alone know how to achieve.\nIt gave the impression of not having been swept since the\nfoundation of the firm, in the year 1786. There was one small\nwindow, covered with grime. It was one of those windows you see\nonly in lawyers' offices. Possibly some reckless Mainprice or\nharebrained Boole had opened it in a fit of mad excitement\ninduced by the news of the Battle of Waterloo, in 1815, and had\nbeen instantly expelled from the firm. Since then, no one had\ndared to tamper with it.\n\nGazing through this window--or, rather, gazing at it, for X-rays\ncould hardly have succeeded in actually penetrating the alluvial\ndeposits on the glass--was a little man. As Ashe entered, he\nturned and looked at him as though he hurt him rather badly in\nsome tender spot.\n\nAshe was obliged to own to himself that he felt a little nervous.\nIt is not every day that a young man of good appearance, who has\nled a quiet life, meets face to face one who is prepared to pay\nhim well for doing something delicate and dangerous. To Ashe the\nsensation was entirely novel. The most delicate and dangerous act\nhe had performed to date had been the daily mastication of Mrs.\nBell's breakfast--included in the rent. Yes, he had to admit\nit--he was nervous: and the fact that he was nervous made him hot\nand uncomfortable.\n\nTo judge him by his appearance, the man at the window was also\nhot and uncomfortable. He was a little, truculent-looking man,\nand his face at present was red with a flush that sat unnaturally\non a normally lead-colored face. His eyes looked out from under\nthick gray eyebrows with an almost tortured expression. This was\npartly owing to the strain of interviewing Ashe's preposterous\npredecessors, but principally to the fact that the little man had\nsuddenly been seized with acute indigestion, a malady to which he\nwas peculiarly subject.\n\nHe removed from his mouth the black cigar he was smoking,\ninserted a digestive tabloid, and replaced the cigar. Then he\nconcentrated his attention on Ashe. As he did so the hostile\nexpression of his face became modified. He looked surprised\nand--grudgingly--pleased.\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\" he said.\n\n\"I came in answer to--\"\n\n\"In answer to my advertisement? I had given up hope of seeing\nanything part human. I thought you must be one of the clerks.\nYou're certainly more like what I advertised for. Of all the\nseedy bunches of dead beats I ever struck, the aggregation I've\njust been interviewing was the seediest! When I spend good money\nin advertising for a young man of good appearance, I want a young\nman of good appearance--not a tramp of fifty-five.\"\n\nAshe was sorry for his predecessors, but he was bound to admit\nthat they certainly had corresponded somewhat faithfully to the\ndescription just given. The comparative cordiality of his own\nreception removed the slight nervousness that had been troubling\nhim. He began to feel confident--almost jaunty.\n\n\"I'm through,\" said the little man wearily. \"I've had enough of\ninterviewing applicants. You're the last one I'll see. Are there\nany more hobos outside?\"\n\n\"Not when I came in.\"\n\n\"Then we'll get down to business. I'll tell you what I want done,\nand if you are willing you can do it; if you are not willing you\ncan leave it--and go to the devil! Sit down.\"\n\nAshe sat down. He resented the little man's tone, but this was\nnot the moment for saying so. His companion scrutinized him\nnarrowly.\n\n\"So far as appearance goes,\" he said, \"you are what I want.\" Ashe\nfelt inclined to bow. \"Whoever takes on this job has got to act\nas my valet, and you look like a valet.\" Ashe felt less inclined\nto bow.\n\n\"You're tall and thin and ordinary-looking. Yes; so far as\nappearance goes, you fill the bill.\"\n\nIt seemed to Ashe that it was time to correct an impression the\nlittle man appeared to have formed.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"if all you want is a valet, you will\nhave to look elsewhere. I got the idea from your advertisement\nthat something rather more exciting was in the air. I can\nrecommend you to several good employment agencies if you wish.\"\nHe rose. \"Good-morning!\" he said.\n\nHe would have liked to fling the massive pewter inkwell at this\nlittle creature who had so keenly disappointed him.\n\n\"Sit down!\" snapped the other.\n\nAshe resumed his seat. The hope of adventure dies hard on a\nSpring morning when one is twenty-six, and he had the feeling\nthat there was more to come.\n\n\"Don't be a damned fool!\" said the little man. \"Of course I'm not\nasking you to be a valet and nothing else.\"\n\n\"You would want me to do some cooking and plain sewing on the\nside, perhaps?\"\n\nTheir eyes met in a hostile glare. The flush on the little man's\nface deepened.\n\n\"Are you trying to get fresh with me?\" he demanded dangerously.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ashe.\n\nThe answer seemed to disconcert his adversary. He was silent for\na moment.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"maybe it's all for the best. If you\nweren't full of gall probably you wouldn't have come here at all;\nand whoever takes on this job of mine has got to have gall if he\nhas nothing else. I think we shall suit each other.\"\n\n\"What is the job?\"\n\nThe little man's face showed doubt and perplexity.\n\n\"It's awkward. If I'm to make the thing clear to you I've got to\ntrust you. And I don't know a thing about you. I wish I had\nthought of that before I inserted the advertisement.\"\n\nAshe appreciated the difficulty.\n\n\"Couldn't you make an A--B case out of it?\"\n\n\"Maybe I could if I knew what an A--B case was.\"\n\n\"Call the people mixed up in it A and B.\"\n\n\"And forget, halfway through, who was which! No; I guess I'll\nhave to trust you.\"\n\n\"I'll play square.\"\n\nThe little man fastened his eyes on Ashe's in a piercing stare.\nAshe met them smilingly. His spirits, always fairly cheerful, had\nrisen high by now. There was something about the little man, in\nspite of his brusqueness and ill temper, which made him feel\nflippant.\n\n\"Pure white!\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"My soul! And this\"--he thumped the left section of his\nwaistcoat--\"solid gold. You may fire when ready, Gridley.\nProceed, professor.\"\n\n\"I don't know where to begin.\"\n\n\"Without presuming to dictate, why not at the beginning?\"\n\n\"It's all so darned complicated that I don't rightly know which\nis the beginning. Well, see here . . . I collect scarabs. I'm\ncrazy about scarabs. Ever since I quit business, you might say\nthat I have practically lived for scarabs.\"\n\n\"Though it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone,\" said\nAshe. \"Incidentally, what are scarabs?\" He held up his hand.\n\"Wait! It all comes back to me. Expensive classical education,\nnow bearing belated fruit. Scarabaeus--Latin; noun, nominative--a\nbeetle. Scarabaee--vocative--O you beetle! Scarabaeum--\naccusative--the beetle. Scarabaei--of the beetle. Scarabaeo--to\nor for the beetle. I remember now. Egypt--Rameses--pyramids--\nsacred scarabs! Right!\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I've gotten together the best collection of\nscarabs outside the British Museum, and some of them are worth\nwhat you like to me. I don't reckon money when it comes to a\nquestion of my scarabs. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Sure, Mike!\"\n\nDispleasure clouded the little man's face.\n\n\"My name is not Mike.\"\n\n\"I used the word figuratively, as it were.\"\n\n\"Well, don't do it again. My name is J. Preston Peters, and Mr.\nPeters will do as well as anything else when you want to attract\nmy attention.\"\n\n\"Mine is Marson. You were saying, Mr. Peters--?\"\n\n\"Well, it's this way,\" said the little man.\n\nShakespeare and Pope have both emphasized the tediousness of a\ntwice-told tale; the Episode Of the Stolen Scarab need not be\nrepeated at this point, though it must be admitted that Mr.\nPeters' version of it differed considerably from the calm,\ndispassionate description the author, in his capacity of official\nhistorian, has given earlier in the story.\n\nIn Mr. Peters' version the Earl of Emsworth appeared as a smooth\nand purposeful robber, a sort of elderly Raffles, worming his way\ninto the homes of the innocent, and only sparing that portion of\ntheir property which was too heavy for him to carry away. Mr.\nPeters, indeed, specifically described the Earl of Emsworth as an\noily old second-story man.\n\nIt took Ashe some little time to get a thorough grasp of the\ntangled situation; but he did it at last.\n\nOnly one point perplexed him.\n\n\"You want to hire somebody to go to this castle and get this\nscarab back for you. I follow that. But why must he go as your\nvalet?\"\n\n\"That's simple enough. You don't think I'm asking him to buy a\nblack mask and break in, do you? I'm making it as easy for him as\npossible. I can't take a secretary down to the castle, for\neverybody knows that, now I've retired, I haven't got a\nsecretary; and if I engaged a new one and he was caught trying to\nsteal my scarab from the earl's collection, it would look\nsuspicious. But a valet is different. Anyone can get fooled by a\ncrook valet with bogus references.\"\n\n\"I see. There's just one other point: Suppose your accomplice\ndoes get caught--what then?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Peters, \"is the catch; and it's just because of\nthat I am offering good pay to my man. We'll suppose, for the\nsake of argument, that you accept the contract and get caught.\nWell, if that happens you've got to look after yourself. I\ncouldn't say a word. If I did it would all come out, and so far\nas the breaking off of my daughter's engagement to young\nThreepwood is concerned, it would be just as bad as though I had\ntried to get the thing back myself.\n\n\"You've got to bear that in mind. You've got to remember it if\nyou forget everything else. I don't appear in this business in\nany way whatsoever. If you get caught you take what's coming to\nyou without a word. You can't turn round and say: 'I am innocent.\nMr. Peters will explain all'--because Mr. Peters certainly won't.\nMr. Peters won't utter a syllable of protest if they want to hang\nyou.\n\n\"No; if you go into this, young man, you go into it with your\neyes open. You go into it with a full understanding of the\nrisks--because you think the reward, if you are successful, makes\nthe taking of those risks worth while. You and I know that what\nyou are doing isn't really stealing; it's simply a tactful way of\ngetting back my own property. But the judge and jury will have\ndifferent views.\"\n\n\"I am beginning to understand,\" said Ashe thoughtfully, \"why you\ncalled the job delicate and dangerous.\"\n\nCertainly it had been no overstatement. As a writer of detective\nstories for the British office boy, he had imagined in his time\nmany undertakings that might be so described, but few to which\nthe description was more admirably suited.\n\n\"It is,\" said Mr. Peters; \"and that is why I'm offering good pay.\nWhoever carries this job through gets one thousand pounds.\"\n\nAshe started.\n\n\"One thousand pounds--five thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"Five thousand.\"\n\n\"When do I begin?\"\n\n\"You'll do it?\"\n\n\"For five thousand dollars I certainly will.\"\n\n\"With your eyes open?\"\n\n\"Wide open!\"\n\nA look of positive geniality illuminated Mr. Peters' pinched\nfeatures. He even went so far as to pat Ashe on the shoulder.\n\n\"Good boy!\" he said. \"Meet me at Paddington Station at four\no'clock on Friday. And if there's anything more you want to know\ncome round to this address.\"\n\nThere remained the telling of Joan Valentine; for it was\nobviously impossible not to tell her. When you have\nrevolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot\nwell conceal the fact, as though nothing had happened. Ashe had\nnot the slightest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, he\nwas glad to have such a capital excuse for renewing the\nacquaintance.\n\nHe could not tell her, of course, the secret details of the\nthing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go\nairily in and say:\n\n\"You know what you told me about doing something new? Well, I've\njust got a job as a valet.\"\n\nSo he went airily in and said it.\n\n\"To whom?\" said Joan.\n\n\"To a man named Peters--an American.\"\n\nWomen are trained from infancy up to conceal their feelings. Joan\ndid not start or otherwise express emotion.\n\n\"Not Mr. J. Preston Peters?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you know him? What a remarkable thing.\"\n\n\"His daughter,\" said Joan, \"has just engaged me as a lady's\nmaid.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"It will not be quite the same thing as three years ago,\" Joan\nexplained. \"It is just a cheap way of getting a holiday. I used\nto know Miss Peters very well, you see. It will be more like\ntraveling as her guest.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" Ashe had not yet overcome his amazement.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"But what an extraordinary coincidence!\"\n\n\"Yes. By the way, how did you get the situation? And what put it\ninto your head to be a valet at all? It seems such a curious\nthing for you to think of doing.\"\n\nAshe was embarrassed.\n\n\"I--I--well, you see, the experience will be useful to me, of\ncourse, in my writing.\"\n\n\"Oh! Are you thinking of taking up my line of work? Dukes?\"\n\n\"No, no--not exactly that.\"\n\n\"It seems so odd. How did you happen to get in touch with Mr.\nPeters?\"\n\n\"Oh, I answered an advertisement.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nAshe was becoming conscious of an undercurrent of something not\naltogether agreeable in the conversation. It lacked the gay ease\nof their first interview. He was not apprehensive lest she might\nhave guessed his secret. There was, he felt, no possible means by\nwhich she could have done that. Yet the fact remained that those\nkeen blue eyes of hers were looking at him in a peculiar and\npenetrating manner. He felt damped.\n\n\"It will be nice, being together,\" he said feebly.\n\n\"Very!\" said Joan.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I thought I would come and tell you.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n\"It seems so funny that you should be going out as a lady's\nmaid.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"But, of course, you have done it before.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The really extraordinary thing is that we should be going to the\nsame people.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It--it's remarkable, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAshe reflected. No; he did not appear to have any further remarks\nto make.\n\n\"Good-by for the present,\" he said.\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\nAshe drifted out. He was conscious of a wish that he understood\ngirls. Girls, in his opinion, were odd.\n\nWhen he had gone Joan Valentine hurried to the door and, having\nopened it an inch, stood listening. When the sound of his door\nclosing came to her she ran down the stairs and out into Arundell\nStreet. She went to the Hotel Mathis.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said to the sad-eyed waiter, \"if you have a copy\nof the Morning Post?\"\n\nThe waiter, a child of romantic Italy, was only too anxious to\noblige youth and beauty. He disappeared and presently returned\nwith a crumpled copy. Joan thanked him with a bright smile.\n\nBack in her room, she turned to the advertisement pages. She knew\nthat life was full of what the unthinking call coincidences; but\nthe miracle of Ashe having selected by chance the father of Aline\nPeters as an employer was too much of a coincidence for her.\nSuspicion furrowed her brow.\n\nIt did not take her long to discover the advertisement that had\nsent Ashe hurrying in a taxicab to the offices of Messrs.\nMainprice, Mainprice & Boole. She had been looking for something\nof the kind.\n\nShe read it through twice and smiled. Everything was very clear\nto her. She looked at the ceiling above her and shook her head.\n\n\"You are quite a nice young man, Mr. Marson,\" she said softly;\n\"but you mustn't try to jump my claim. I dare say you need that\nmoney too; but I'm afraid you must go without. I am going to have\nit--and nobody else!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe four-fifteen express slid softly out of Paddington Station\nand Ashe Marson settled himself in the corner seat of his\nsecond-class compartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had begun\nto read a magazine. Along the corridor, in a first-class smoking\ncompartment, Mr. Peters was lighting a big black cigar. Still\nfarther along the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking\ncompartment, Aline Peters looked through the window and thought\nof many things.\n\nIn English trains the tipping classes travel first; valets,\nlady's maids, footmen, nurses, and head stillroom maids, second;\nand housemaids, grooms, and minor and inferior stillroom maids,\nthird. But for these social distinctions, the whole fabric of\nsociety would collapse and anarchy stalk naked through the\nland--as in the United States.\n\nAshe was feeling remarkably light-hearted. He wished he had not\nbought Joan that magazine and thus deprived himself temporarily\nof the pleasure of her conversation; but that was the only flaw\nin his happiness. With the starting of the train, which might be\nconsidered the formal and official beginning of the delicate and\ndangerous enterprise on which he had embarked, he had definitely\ncome to the conclusion that the life adventurous was the life for\nhim. He had frequently suspected this to be the case, but it had\nrequired the actual experiment to bring certainty.\n\nAlmost more than physical courage, the ideal adventurer needs a\ncertain lively inquisitiveness, the quality of not being content\nto mind his own affairs; and in Ashe this quality was highly\ndeveloped. From boyhood up he had always been interested in\nthings that were none of his business. And it is just that\nattribute which the modern young man, as a rule, so sadly lacks.\n\nThe modern young man may do adventurous things if they are thrust\non him; but left to himself he will edge away uncomfortably and\nlook in the other direction when the goddess of adventure smiles\nat him. Training and tradition alike pluck at his sleeve and urge\nhim not to risk making himself ridiculous. And from sheer horror\nof laying himself open to the charge of not minding his own\nbusiness he falls into a stolid disregard of all that is out of\nthe ordinary and exciting. He tells himself that the shriek from\nthe lonely house he passed just now was only the high note of\nsome amateur songstress, and that the maiden in distress whom he\nsaw pursued by the ruffian with a knife was merely earning the\nsalary paid her by some motion-picture firm. And he proceeds on\nhis way, looking neither to left nor right.\n\nAshe had none of this degenerate coyness toward adventure. Though\nborn within easy distance of Boston and deposited by\ncircumstances in London, he possessed, nevertheless, to a\nremarkable degree, that quality so essentially the property of\nthe New Yorker--the quality known, for want of a more polished\nword, as rubber. It is true that it had needed the eloquence of\nJoan Valentine to stir him from his groove; but that was because\nhe was also lazy. He loved new sights and new experiences. Yes;\nhe was happy. The rattle of the train shaped itself into a lively\nmarch. He told himself that he had found the right occupation for\na young man in the Spring.\n\nJoan, meantime, intrenched behind her magazine, was also busy\nwith her thoughts. She was not reading the magazine; she held it\nbefore her as a protection, knowing that if she laid it down Ashe\nwould begin to talk. And just at present she had no desire for\nconversation. She, like Ashe, was contemplating the immediate\nfuture, but, unlike him, was not doing so with much pleasure. She\nwas regretting heartily that she had not resisted the temptation\nto uplift this young man and wishing that she had left him to\nwallow in the slothful peace in which she had found him.\n\nIt is curious how frequently in this world our attempts to\nstimulate and uplift swoop back on us and smite us like\nboomerangs. Ashe's presence was the direct outcome of her lecture\non enterprise, and it added a complication to an already\ncomplicated venture.\n\nShe did her best to be fair to Ashe. It was not his fault that he\nwas about to try to deprive her of five thousand dollars, which\nshe looked on as her personal property; but illogically she found\nherself feeling a little hostile.\n\nShe glanced furtively at him over the magazine, choosing by ill\nchance a moment when he had just directed his gaze at her. Their\neyes met and there was nothing for it but to talk; so she tucked\naway her hostility in a corner of her mind, where she could find\nit again when she wanted it, and prepared for the time being to\nbe friendly. After all, except for the fact that he was her\nrival, this was a pleasant and amusing young man, and one for\nwhom, until he made the announcement that had changed her whole\nattitude toward him, she had entertained a distinct feeling of\nfriendship--nothing warmer.\n\nThere was something about him that made her feel that she would\nhave liked to stroke his hair in a motherly way and straighten\nhis tie, and have cozy chats with him in darkened rooms by the\nlight of open fires, and make him tell her his inmost thoughts,\nand stimulate him to do something really worth while with his\nlife; but this, she held, was merely the instinct of a generous\nnature to be kind and helpful even to a comparative stranger.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Marson,\" she said, \"Here we are!\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was thinking,\" said Ashe.\n\nHe was conscious of a marked increase in the exhilaration the\nstarting of the expedition had brought to him. At the back of his\nmind he realized there had been all along a kind of wistful\nresentment at the change in this girl's manner toward him.\nDuring the brief conversation when he had told her of his having\nsecured his present situation, and later, only a few minutes\nback, on the platform of Paddington Station, he had sensed a\ncoldness, a certain hostility--so different from her pleasant\nfriendliness at their first meeting.\n\nShe had returned now to her earlier manner and he was surprised\nat the difference it made. He felt somehow younger, more alive.\nThe lilt of the train's rattle changed to a gay ragtime. This was\ncurious, because Joan was nothing more than a friend. He was not\nin love with her. One does not fall in love with a girl whom one\nhas met only three times. One is attracted--yes; but one does not\nfall in love.\n\nA moment's reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations\ncorrectly. This odd impulse to leap across the compartment and\nkiss Joan was not love. It was merely the natural desire of a\ngood-hearted young man to be decently chummy with his species.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of it all, Mr. Marson?\" said Joan. \"Are\nyou sorry or glad that you let me persuade you to do this\nperfectly mad thing? I feel responsible for you, you know. If it\nhad not been for me you would have been comfortably in Arundell\nStreet, writing your Wand of Death.\"\n\n\"I'm glad.\"\n\n\"You don't feel any misgivings now that you are actually\ncommitted to domestic service?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\nJoan, against her will, smiled approval on this uncompromising\nattitude. This young man might be her rival, but his demeanor on\nthe eve of perilous times appealed to her. That was the spirit\nshe liked and admired--that reckless acceptance of whatever might\ncome. It was the spirit in which she herself had gone into the\naffair and she was pleased to find that it animated Ashe\nalso--though, to be sure, it had its drawbacks. It made his\nrivalry the more dangerous. This reflection injected a touch of\nthe old hostility into her manner.\n\n\"I wonder whether you will continue to feel so brave.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nJoan perceived that she was in danger of going too far. She had\nno wish to unmask Ashe at the expense of revealing her own\nsecret. She must resist the temptation to hint that she had\ndiscovered his.\n\n\"I meant,\" she said quickly, \"that from what I have seen of him\nMr. Peters seems likely to be a rather trying man to work for.\"\n\nAshe's face cleared. For a moment he had almost suspected that\nshe had guessed his errand.\n\n\"Yes. I imagine he will be. He is what you might call\nquick-tempered. He has dyspepsia, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"What he wants is plenty of fresh air and no cigars, and a\nregular course of those Larsen Exercises that amused you so\nmuch.\"\n\nJoan laughed.\n\n\"Are you going to try and persuade Mr. Peters to twist himself\nabout like that? Do let me see it if you do.\"\n\n\"I wish I could.\"\n\n\"Do suggest it to him.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he would resent it from a valet?\"\n\n\"I keep forgetting that you are a valet. You look so unlike one.\"\n\n\"Old Peters didn't think so. He rather complimented me on my\nappearance. He said I was ordinary-looking.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have called you that. You look so very strong and\nfit.\"\n\n\"Surely there are muscular valets?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I suppose there are.\"\n\nAshe looked at her. He was thinking that never in his life had he\nseen a girl so amazingly pretty. What it was that she had done to\nherself was beyond him; but something, some trick of dress, had\ngiven her a touch of the demure that made her irresistible. She\nwas dressed in sober black, the ideal background for her\nfairness.\n\n\"While on the subject,\" he said, \"I suppose you know you don't\nlook in the least like a lady's maid? You look like a disguised\nprincess.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"That's very nice of you, Mr. Marson, but you're quite wrong.\nAnyone could tell I was a lady's maid, a mile away. You aren't\ncriticizing the dress, surely?\"\n\n\"The dress is all right. It's the general effect. I don't think\nyour expression is right. It's--it's--there's too much attack in\nit. You aren't meek enough.\"\n\nJoan's eyes opened wide.\n\n\"Meek! Have you ever seen an English lady's maid, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"Why, no; now that I come to think of it, I don't believe I\nhave.\"\n\n\"Well, let me tell you that meekness is her last quality. Why\nshould she be meek? Doesn't she go in after the groom of the\nchambers?\"\n\n\"Go in? Go in where?\"\n\n\"In to dinner.\" She smiled at the sight of his bewildered face.\n\"I'm afraid you don't know much about the etiquette of the new\nworld you have entered so rashly. Didn't you know that the rules\nof precedence among the servants of a big house in England are\nmore rigid and complicated than in English society?\"\n\n\"You're joking!\"\n\n\"I'm not joking. You try going in to dinner out of your proper\nplace when we get to Blandings and see what happens. A public\nrebuke from the butler is the least you could expect.\"\n\nA bead of perspiration appeared on Ashe's forehead.\n\n\"Heavens!\" he whispered. \"If a butler publicly rebuked me I think\nI should commit suicide. I couldn't survive it.\"\n\nHe stared, with fallen jaw, into the abyss of horror into which\nhe had leaped so light-heartedly. The servant problem, on this\nlarge scale, had been nonexistent for him until now. In the days\nof his youth, at Mayling, Massachusetts, his needs had been\nministered to by a muscular Swede. Later, at Oxford, there had\nbeen his \"scout\" and his bed maker, harmless persons both,\nprovided you locked up your whisky. And in London, his last\nphase, a succession of servitors of the type of the disheveled\nmaid at Number Seven had tended him.\n\nThat, dotted about the land of his adoption, there were houses in\nwhich larger staffs of domestics were maintained, he had been\nvaguely aware. Indeed, in \"Gridley Quayle, Investigator; the\nAdventure of the Missing Marquis\"--number four of the series--he\nhad drawn a picture of the home life of a duke, in which a butler\nand two powdered footmen had played their parts; but he had had\nno idea that rigid and complicated rules of etiquette swayed the\nprivate lives of these individuals. If he had given the matter a\nthought he had supposed that when the dinner hour arrived the\nbutler and the two footmen would troop into the kitchen and\nsquash in at the table wherever they found room.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said. \"Tell me all you know. I feel as though I had\nescaped a frightful disaster.\"\n\n\"You probably have. I don't suppose there is anything so terrible\nas a snub from a butler.\"\n\n\"If there is I can't think of it. When I was at Oxford I used to\ngo and stay with a friend of mine who had a butler that looked\nlike a Roman emperor in swallowtails. He terrified me. I used to\ngrovel to the man. Please give me all the pointers you can.\"\n\n\"Well, as Mr. Peters' valet, I suppose you will be rather a big\nman.\"\n\n\"I shan't feel it.\"\n\n\"However large the house party is, Mr. Peters is sure to be the\nprincipal guest; so your standing will be correspondingly\nmagnificent. You come after the butler, the housekeeper, the\ngroom of the chambers, Lord Emsworth's valet, Lady Ann\nWarblington's lady's maid--\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"Lady Ann? Lord Emsworth's sister. She has lived with him since\nhis wife died. What was I saying? Oh, yes! After them come the\nhonorable Frederick Threepwood's valet and myself--and then you.\"\n\n\"I'm not so high up then, after all?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. There's a whole crowd who come after you. It all\ndepends on how many other guests there are besides Mr. Peters.\"\n\n\"I suppose I charge in at the head of a drove of housemaids and\nscullery maids?\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Marson, if a housemaid or a scullery maid tried to\nget into the steward's room and have her meals with us, she would\nbe--\"\n\n\"Rebuked by the butler?\"\n\n\"Lynched, I should think. Kitchen maids and scullery maids eat in\nthe kitchen. Chauffeurs, footmen, under-butler, pantry boys, hall\nboy, odd man and steward's-room footman take their meals in the\nservants' hall, waited on by the hall boy. The stillroom maids\nhave breakfast and tea in the stillroom, and dinner and supper in\nthe hall. The housemaids and nursery maids have breakfast and tea\nin the housemaid's sitting-room, and dinner and supper in the\nhall. The head housemaid ranks next to the head stillroom maid.\nThe laundry maids have a place of their own near the laundry, and\nthe head laundry maid ranks above the head housemaid. The chef\nhas his meals in a room of his own near the kitchen. Is there\nanything else I can tell you, Mr. Marson?\"\n\nAshe was staring at her with vacant eyes. He shook his head\ndumbly.\n\n\"We stop at Swindon in half an hour,\" said Joan softly. \"Don't\nyou think you would be wise to get out there and go straight back\nto London, Mr. Marson? Think of all you would avoid!\"\n\nAshe found speech.\n\n\"It's a nightmare!\"\n\n\"You would be far happier in Arundell Street. Why don't you get\nout at Swindon and go back?\"\n\nAshe shook his head.\n\n\"I can't. There's--there's a reason.\"\n\nJoan picked up her magazine again. Hostility had come out from\nthe corner into which she had tucked it away and was once more\nfilling her mind. She knew it was illogical, but she could not\nhelp it. For a moment, during her revelations of servants'\netiquette, she had allowed herself to hope that she had\nfrightened her rival out of the field, and the disappointment\nmade her feel irritable. She buried herself in a short story, and\ncountered Ashe's attempts at renewing the conversation with cold\nmonosyllables, until he ceased his efforts and fell into a moody\nsilence.\n\nHe was feeling hurt and angry. Her sudden coldness, following on\nthe friendliness with which she had talked so long, puzzled and\ninfuriated him. He felt as though he had been snubbed, and for no\nreason.\n\nHe resented the defensive magazine, though he had bought it for\nher himself. He resented her attitude of having ceased to\nrecognize his existence. A sadness, a filmy melancholy, crept\nover him. He brooded on the unutterable silliness of humanity,\nespecially the female portion of it, in erecting artificial\nbarriers to friendship. It was so unreasonable.\n\nAt their first meeting, when she might have been excused for\nshowing defensiveness, she had treated him with unaffected ease.\nWhen that meeting had ended there was a tacit understanding\nbetween them that all the preliminary awkwardnesses of the first\nstages of acquaintanceship were to be considered as having been\npassed; and that when they met again, if they ever did, it would\nbe as friends. And here she was, luring him on with apparent\nfriendliness, and then withdrawing into herself as though he had\npresumed.\n\nA rebellious spirit took possession of him. He didn't care! Let\nher be cold and distant. He would show her that she had no\nmonopoly of those qualities. He would not speak to her until she\nspoke to him; and when she spoke to him he would freeze her with\nhis courteous but bleakly aloof indifference.\n\nThe train rattled on. Joan read her magazine. Silence reigned in\nthe second-class compartment. Swindon was reached and passed.\nDarkness fell on the land. The journey began to seem interminable\nto Ashe; but presently there came a creaking of brakes and the\ntrain jerked itself to another stop. A voice on the platform made\nitself heard, calling:\n\n\"Market Blandings! Market Blandings Station!\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe village of Market Blandings is one of those sleepy English\nhamlets that modern progress has failed to touch; except by the\naddition of a railroad station and a room over the grocer's shop\nwhere moving pictures are on view on Tuesdays and Fridays. The\nchurch is Norman and the intelligence of the majority of the\nnatives Paleozoic. To alight at Market Blandings Station in the\ndusk of a rather chilly Spring day, when the southwest wind has\nshifted to due east and the thrifty inhabitants have not yet lit\ntheir windows, is to be smitten with the feeling that one is at\nthe edge of the world with no friends near.\n\nAshe, as he stood beside Mr. Peters' baggage and raked the\nunsympathetic darkness with a dreary eye, gave himself up to\nmelancholy. Above him an oil lamp shed a meager light. Along the\nplatform a small but sturdy porter was juggling with a milk can.\nThe east wind explored Ashe's system with chilly fingers.\n\nSomewhere out in the darkness into which Mr. Peters and Aline had\nalready vanished in a large automobile, lay the castle, with its\nbutler and its fearful code of etiquette. Soon the cart that was\nto convey him and the trunks thither would be arriving. He\nshivered.\n\nOut of the gloom and into the feeble rays of the oil lamp came\nJoan Valentine. She had been away, tucking Aline into the car.\nShe looked warm and cheerful. She was smiling in the old friendly\nway.\n\nIf girls realized their responsibilities they would be so careful\nwhen they smiled that they would probably abandon the practice\naltogether. There are moments in a man's life when a girl's smile\ncan have as important results as an explosion of dynamite.\n\nIn the course of their brief acquaintance Joan had smiled at Ashe\nmany times, but the conditions governing those occasions had not\nbeen such as to permit him to be seriously affected. He had been\npleased on such occasions; he had admired her smile in a detached\nand critical spirit; but he had not been overwhelmed by it. The\nframe of mind necessary for that result had been lacking.\n\nNow, however, after five minutes of solitude on the depressing\nplatform of Market Blandings Station, he was what the\nspiritualists call a sensitive subject. He had reached that depth\nof gloom and bodily discomfort when a sudden smile has all the\neffect of strong liquor and good news administered\nsimultaneously, warming the blood and comforting the soul, and\ngenerally turning the world from a bleak desert into a land\nflowing with milk and honey.\n\nIt is not too much to say that he reeled before Joan's smile. It\nwas so entirely unexpected. He clutched Mr. Peters' steamer trunk\nin his emotion. All his resolutions to be cold and distant were\nswept away. He had the feeling that in a friendless universe here\nwas somebody who was fond of him and glad to see him.\n\nA smile of such importance demands analysis, and in this case\nrepays it; for many things lay behind this smile of Joan\nValentine's on the platform of Market Blandings Station.\n\nIn the first place, she had had another of her swift changes of\nmood, and had once again tucked away hostility into its corner.\nShe had thought it over and had come to the conclusion that as\nshe had no logical grievance against Ashe for anything he had\ndone to be distant to him was the behavior of a cat. Consequently\nshe resolved, when they should meet again, to resume her attitude\nof good-fellowship. That in itself would have been enough to make\nher smile.\n\nThere was another reason, however, which had nothing to do with\nAshe. While she had been tucking Aline into the automobile she\nmet the eye of the driver of that vehicle and had perceived a\ncurious look in it--a look of amazement and sheer terror. A\nmoment, later, when Aline called the driver Freddie, she had\nunderstood. No wonder the Honorable Freddie had looked as though\nhe had seen a ghost.\n\nIt would be a relief to the poor fellow when, as he undoubtedly\nwould do in the course of the drive, he inquired of Aline the\nname of her maid and was told that it was Simpson. He would\nmutter something about \"Reminds me of a girl I used to know,\" and\nwould brood on the remarkable way in which Nature produces\ndoubles. But he had a bad moment, and it was partly at the\nrecollection of his face that Joan smiled.\n\nA third reason was because the sight of the Honorable Freddie had\nreminded her that R. Jones had said he had written her poetry.\nThat thought, too, had contributed toward the smile which so\ndazzled Ashe.\n\nAshe, not being miraculously intuitive, accepted the easier\nexplanation that she smiled because she was glad to be in his\ncompany; and this thought, coming on top of his mood of despair\nand general dissatisfaction with everything mundane, acted on him\nlike some powerful chemical.\n\nIn every man's life there is generally one moment to which in\nlater years he can look back and say: \"In this moment I fell in\nlove!\" Such a moment came to Ashe now.\n\n          Betwixt the stirrup and the ground,\n          Mercy I asked; mercy I found.\n\nSo sings the poet and so it was with Ashe.\n\nIn the almost incredibly brief time it took the small but sturdy\nporter to roll a milk can across the platform and hump it, with a\nclang, against other milk cans similarly treated a moment before,\nAshe fell in love.\n\nThe word is so loosely used, to cover a thousand varying shades\nof emotion--from the volcanic passion of an Antony for a\nCleopatra to the tepid preference of a grocer's assistant for the\nIrish maid at the second house on Main Street, as opposed to the\nNorwegian maid at the first house past the post office--the mere\nstatement that Ashe fell in love is not a sufficient description\nof his feelings as he stood grasping Mr. Peters' steamer trunk.\nAnalysis is required.\n\nFrom his fourteenth year onward Ashe had been in love many times.\nHis sensations in the case of Joan were neither the terrific\nupheaval that had caused him, in his fifteenth year, to collect\ntwenty-eight photographs of the heroine of the road company of a\nmusical comedy which had visited the Hayling Opera House, nor the\nmilder flame that had caused him, when at college, to give up\nsmoking for a week and try to read the complete works of Ella\nWheeler Wilcox.\n\nHis love was something that lay between these two poles.\n\nHe did not wish the station platform of Market Blandings to\nbecome suddenly congested with red Indians so that he might save\nJoan's life; and he did not wish to give up anything at all. But\nhe was conscious--to the very depths of his being--that a future\nin which Joan did not figure would be so insupportable as not to\nbear considering; and in the immediate present he very strongly\nfavored the idea of clasping Joan in his arms and kissing her\nuntil further notice.\n\nMingled with these feelings was an excited gratitude to her for\ncoming to him like this, with that electric smile on her face; a\nstunned realization that she was a thousand times prettier than\nhe had ever imagined; and a humility that threatened to make him\nloose his clutch on the steamer trunk and roll about at her feet,\nyapping like a dog.\n\nGratitude, so far as he could dissect his tangled emotion was the\npredominating ingredient of his mood. Only once in his life had\nhe felt so passionately grateful to any human being. On that\noccasion, too, the object of his gratitude had been feminine.\n\nYears before, when a boy in his father's home in distant Hayling,\nMassachusetts, those in authority had commanded that he--in his\neleventh year and as shy as one can be only at that interesting\nage--should rise in the presence of a roomful of strangers, adult\nguests, and recite \"The Wreck of the Hesperus.\"\n\nHe had risen. He had blushed. He had stammered. He had contrived\nto whisper: \"It was the Schooner Hesperus.\" And then, in a corner\nof the room, a little girl, for no properly explained reason, had\nburst out crying. She had yelled, she had bellowed, and would not\nbe comforted; and in the ensuing confusion Ashe had escaped to\nthe woodpile at the bottom of the garden, saved by a miracle.\n\nAll his life he had remembered the gratitude he had felt for that\nlittle timely girl, and never until now had he experienced any\nother similar spasm. But as he looked at Joan he found himself\nrenewing that emotion of fifteen years ago.\n\nShe was about to speak. In a sort of trance he watched her lips\npart. He waited almost reverently for the first words she should\nspeak to him in her new role of the only authentic goddess.\n\n\"Isn't it a shame?\" she said. \"I've just put a penny in the\nchocolate slot machine--and it's empty! I've a good mind to write\nto the company.\"\n\nAshe felt as though he were listening to the strains of some\ngrand sweet anthem.\n\nThe small but sturdy porter, weary of his work among the milk\ncans, or perhaps--let us not do him an injustice even in\nthought--having finished it, approached them.\n\n\"The cart from the castle's here.\"\n\nIn the gloom beyond him there gleamed a light which had not been\nthere before. The meditative snort of a horse supported his\nstatement. He began to deal as authoritatively with Mr. Peters'\nsteamer trunk as he had dealt with the milk cans.\n\n\"At last!\" said Joan. \"I hope it's a covered cart. I'm frozen.\nLet's go and see.\"\n\nAshe followed her with the gait of an automaton.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nCold is the ogre that drives all beautiful things into hiding.\nBelow the surface of a frost-bound garden there lurk hidden\nbulbs, which are only biding their time to burst forth in a riot\nof laughing color; but shivering Nature dare not put forth her\nflowers until the ogre has gone. Not otherwise does cold suppress\nlove. A man in an open cart on an English Spring night may\ncontinue to be in love; but love is not the emotion uppermost in\nhis bosom. It shrinks within him and waits for better times.\n\nThe cart was not a covered cart. It was open to the four winds of\nheaven, of which the one at present active proceeded from the\nbleak east. To this fact may be attributed Ashe's swift recovery\nfrom the exalted mood into which Joan's smile had thrown him, his\nalmost instant emergence from the trance. Deep down in him he was\naware that his attitude toward Joan had not changed, but his\nconscious self was too fully occupied with the almost hopeless\ntask of keeping his blood circulating, to permit of thoughts of\nlove. Before the cart had traveled twenty yards he was a mere\nchunk of frozen misery.\n\nAfter an eternity of winding roads, darkened cottages, and black\nfields and hedges, the cart turned in at a massive iron gate,\nwhich stood open giving entrance to a smooth gravel drive. Here\nthe way ran for nearly a mile through an open park of great trees\nand was then swallowed in the darkness of dense shrubberies.\nPresently to the left appeared lights, at first in ones and twos,\nshining out and vanishing again; then, as the shrubberies ended\nand the smooth lawns and terraces began, blazing down on the\ntravelers from a score of windows, with the heartening effect of\nfires on a winter night.\n\nAgainst the pale gray sky Blandings Castle stood out like a\nmountain. It was a noble pile, of Early Tudor building. Its\nhistory is recorded in England's history books and Viollet-le-Duc\nhas written of its architecture. It dominated the surrounding\ncountry.\n\nThe feature of it which impressed Ashe most at this moment,\nhowever, was the fact that it looked warm; and for the first time\nsince the drive began he found himself in a mood that\napproximated cheerfulness. It was a little early to begin feeling\ncheerful, he discovered, for the journey was by no means over.\nArrived within sight of the castle, the cart began a detour,\nwhich, ten minutes later, brought it under an arch and over\ncobblestones to the rear of the building, where it eventually\npulled up in front of a great door.\n\nAshe descended painfully and beat his feet against the cobbles.\nHe helped Joan to climb down. Joan was apparently in a gentle\nglow. Women seem impervious to cold.\n\nThe door opened. Warm, kitcheny scents came through it. Strong\nmen hurried out to take down the trunks, while fair women, in the\nshape of two nervous scullery maids, approached Joan and Ashe,\nand bobbed curtsies. This under more normal conditions would have\nbeen enough to unman Ashe; but in his frozen state a mere\ncurtsying scullery maid expended herself harmlessly on him. He\neven acknowledged the greeting with a kindly nod.\n\nThe scullery maids, it seemed, were acting in much the same\ncapacity as the attaches of royalty. One was there to conduct\nJoan to the presence of Mrs. Twemlow, the housekeeper; the other\nto lead Ashe to where Beach, the butler, waited to do honor to\nthe valet of the castle's most important guest.\n\nAfter a short walk down a stone-flagged passage Joan and her\nescort turned to the right. Ashe's objective appeared to be\nlocated to the left. He parted from Joan with regret. Her moral\nsupport would have been welcome.\n\nPresently his scullery maid stopped at a door and tapped thereon.\nA fruity voice, like old tawny port made audible, said: \"Come\nin!\" Ashe's guide opened the door.\n\n\"The gentleman, Mr. Beach,\" said she, and scuttled away to the\nless rarefied atmosphere of the kitchen.\n\nAshe's first impression of Beach, the butler, was one of tension.\nOther people, confronted for the first time with Beach, had felt\nthe same. He had that strained air of being on the very point of\nbursting that one sees in bullfrogs and toy balloons. Nervous and\nimaginative men, meeting Beach, braced themselves involuntarily,\nstiffening their muscles for the explosion. Those who had the\npleasure of more intimate acquaintance with him soon passed this\nstage, just as people whose homes are on the slopes of Mount\nVesuvius become immune to fear of eruptions.\n\nAs far back as they could remember Beach had always looked as\nthough an apoplectic fit were a matter of minutes; but he never\nhad apoplexy and in time they came to ignore the possibility of\nit. Ashe, however, approaching him with a fresh eye, had the\nfeeling that this strain could not possibly continue and that\nwithin a very short space of time the worst must happen. The\nprospect of this did much to rouse him from the coma into which\nhe had been frozen by the rigors of the journey.\n\nButlers as a class seem to grow less and less like anything human\nin proportion to the magnificence of their surroundings. There is\na type of butler employed in the comparatively modest homes of\nsmall country gentlemen who is practically a man and a brother;\nwho hobnobs with the local tradesmen, sings a good comic song at\nthe village inn, and in times of crisis will even turn to and\nwork the pump when the water supply suddenly fails.\n\nThe greater the house the more does the butler diverge from this\ntype. Blandings Castle was one of the more important of England's\nshow places, and Beach accordingly had acquired a dignified\ninertia that almost qualified him for inclusion in the vegetable\nkingdom. He moved--when he moved at all--slowly. He distilled\nspeech with the air of one measuring out drops of some precious\ndrug. His heavy-lidded eyes had the fixed expression of a\nstatue's.\n\nWith an almost imperceptible wave of a fat white hand, he\nconveyed to Ashe that he desired him to sit down. With a stately\nmovement of his other hand, he picked up a kettle, which simmered\non the hob. With an inclination of his head, he called Ashe's\nattention to a decanter on the table.\n\nIn another moment Ashe was sipping a whisky toddy, with the\nfeeling that he had been privileged to assist at some mystic\nrite. Mr. Beach, posting himself before the fire and placing his\nhands behind his back, permitted speech to drip from him.\n\n\"I have not the advantage of your name, Mr.----\"\n\nAshe introduced himself. Beach acknowledged the information with\na half bow.\n\n\"You must have had a cold ride, Mr. Marson. The wind is in the\neast.\"\n\nAshe said yes; the ride had been cold.\n\n\"When the wind is in the east,\" continued Mr. Beach, letting each\nsyllable escape with apparent reluctance, \"I suffer from my\nfeet.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"I suffer from my feet,\" repeated the butler, measuring out the\ndrops. \"You are a young man, Mr. Marson. Probably you do not know\nwhat it is to suffer from your feet.\" He surveyed Ashe, his\nwhisky toddy and the wall beyond him, with heavy-lidded\ninscrutability. \"Corns!\" he said.\n\nAshe said he was sorry.\n\n\"I suffer extremely from my feet--not only corns. I have but\nrecently recovered from an ingrowing toenail. I suffered greatly\nfrom my ingrowing toenail. I suffer from swollen joints.\"\n\nAshe regarded this martyr with increasing disfavor. It is the\nflaw in the character of many excessively healthy young men that,\nthough kind-hearted enough in most respects, they listen with a\nregrettable feeling of impatience to the confessions of those\nless happily situated as regards the ills of the flesh. Rightly\nor wrongly, they hold that these statements should be reserved\nfor the ear of the medical profession, and other and more general\ntopics selected for conversation with laymen.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said hastily. \"You must have had a bad time. Is\nthere a large house party here just now?\"\n\n\"We are expecting,\" said Mr. Beach, \"a number of guests. We shall\nin all probability sit down thirty or more to dinner.\"\n\n\"A responsibility for you,\" said Ashe ingratiatingly, well\npleased to be quit of the feet topic.\n\nMr. Beach nodded.\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Marson. Few persons realize the\nresponsibilities of a man in my position. Sometimes, I can assure\nyou, it preys on my mind, and I suffer from nervous headaches.\"\n\nAshe began to feel like a man trying to put out a fire which, as\nfast as he checks it at one point, breaks out at another.\n\n\"Sometimes when I come off duty everything gets blurred. The\noutlines of objects grow indistinct and misty. I have to sit down\nin a chair. The pain is excruciating.\"\n\n\"But it helps you to forget the pain in your feet.\"\n\n\"No, no. I suffer from my feet simultaneously.\"\n\nAshe gave up the struggle.\n\n\"Tell me all about your feet,\" he said.\n\nAnd Mr. Beach told him all about his feet.\n\nThe pleasantest functions must come to an end, and the moment\narrived when the final word on the subject of swollen joints was\nspoken. Ashe, who had resigned himself to a permanent\ncontemplation of the subject, could hardly believe he heard\ncorrectly when, at the end of some ten minutes, his companion\nchanged the conversation.\n\n\"You have been with Mr. Peters some time, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh! Oh, no only since last Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Might I inquire whom you assisted before that?\"\n\nFor a moment Ashe did what he would not have believed himself\ncapable of doing--regretted that the topic of feet was no longer\nunder discussion. The question placed him in an awkward position.\nIf he lied and credited himself with a lengthy experience as a\nvalet, he risked exposing himself. If he told the truth and\nconfessed that this was his maiden effort in the capacity of\ngentleman's gentleman, what would the butler think? There were\nobjections to each course, but to tell the truth was the easier\nof the two; so he told it.\n\n\"Your first situation?\" said Mr. Beach. \"Indeed!\"\n\n\"I was--er--doing something else before I met Mr. Peters,\" said\nAshe.\n\nMr. Beach was too well-bred to be inquisitive, but his eyebrows\nwere not.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"?\" cried his eyebrows. \"?--?--?\"\n\nAshe ignored the eyebrows.\n\n\"Something different,\" he said.\n\nThere was an awkward silence. Ashe appreciated its awkwardness.\nHe was conscious of a grievance against Mr. Peters. Why could not\nMr. Peters have brought him down here as his secretary? To be\nsure, he had advanced some objection to that course in their\nconversation at the offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole; but\nmerely a silly, far-fetched objection. He wished he had had the\nsense to fight the point while there was time; but at the moment\nwhen they were arranging plans he had been rather tickled by the\nthought of becoming a valet. The notion had a pleasing\nmusical-comedy touch about it. Why had he not foreseen the\ncomplications that must ensue? He could tell by the look on his\nface that this confounded butler was waiting for him to give a\nfull explanation. What would he think if he withheld it? He would\nprobably suppose that Ashe had been in prison.\n\nWell, there was nothing to be done about it. If Beach was\nsuspicious, he must remain suspicious. Fortunately the suspicions\nof a butler do not matter much.\n\nMr. Beach's eyebrows were still mutely urging him to reveal all,\nbut Ashe directed his gaze at that portion of the room which Mr.\nBeach did not fill. He would be hanged if he was going to let\nhimself be hypnotized by a pair of eyebrows into incriminating\nhimself! He glared stolidly at the pattern of the wallpaper,\nwhich represented a number of birds of an unknown species seated\non a corresponding number of exotic shrubs.\n\nThe silence was growing oppressive. Somebody had to break it\nsoon. And as Mr. Beach was still confining himself to the\nlanguage of the eyebrow and apparently intended to fight it out\non that line if it took all Summer, Ashe himself broke it.\n\nIt seemed to him as he reconstructed the scene in bed that night\nthat Providence must have suggested the subject to Mr. Peters'\nindigestion; for the mere mention of his employer's sufferings\nacted like magic on the butler.\n\n\"I might have had better luck while I was looking for a place,\"\nsaid Ashe. \"I dare say you know how bad-tempered Mr. Peters is.\nHe is dyspeptic.\"\n\n\"So,\" responded Mr. Beach, \"I have been informed.\" He brooded for\na space. \"I, too,\" he proceeded, \"suffer from my stomach. I have\na weak stomach. The lining of my stomach is not what I could wish\nthe lining of my stomach to be.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Ashe gratefully, leaning forward in an attitude\nof attention, \"all about the lining of your stomach.\"\n\nIt was a quarter of an hour later when Mr. Beach was checked in\nhis discourse by the chiming of the little clock on the\nmantelpiece. He turned round and gazed at it with surprise not\nunmixed with displeasure.\n\n\"So late?\" he said. \"I shall have to be going about my duties.\nAnd you, also, Mr. Marson, if I may make the suggestion. No doubt\nMr. Peters will be wishing to have your assistance in preparing\nfor dinner. If you go along the passage outside you will come to\nthe door that separates our portion of the house from the other.\nI must beg you to excuse me. I have to go to the cellar.\"\n\nFollowing his directions Ashe came after a walk of a few yards to\na green-baize door, which, swinging at his push, gave him a view\nof what he correctly took to be the main hall of the castle--a\nwide, comfortable space, ringed with settees and warmed by a log\nfire burning in a mammoth fireplace. On the right a broad\nstaircase led to the upper regions.\n\nIt was at this point that Ashe realized the incompleteness of Mr.\nBeach's directions. Doubtless, the broad staircase would take him\nto the floor on which were the bedrooms; but how was he to\nascertain, without the tedious process of knocking and inquiring\nat each door, which was the one assigned to Mr. Peters? It was\ntoo late to go back and ask the butler for further guidance;\nalready he was on his way to the cellar in quest of the evening's\nwine.\n\nAs he stood irresolute a door across the hall opened and a man of\nhis own age came out. Through the doorway, which the young man\nheld open for an instant while he answered a question from\nsomebody within, Ashe had a glimpse of glass-topped cases.\n\nCould this be the museum--his goal? The next moment the door,\nopening a few inches more, revealed the outlying portions of an\nEgyptian mummy and brought certainty. It flashed across Ashe's\nmind that the sooner he explored the museum and located Mr.\nPeters' scarab, the better. He decided to ask Beach to take him\nthere as soon as he had leisure.\n\nMeantime the young man had closed the museum door and was\ncrossing the hall. He was a wiry-haired, severe-looking young\nman, with a sharp nose and eyes that gleamed through rimless\nspectacles--none other, in fact than Lord Emsworth's private\nsecretary, the Efficient Baxter. Ashe hailed him:\n\n\"I say, old man, would you mind telling me how I get to Mr.\nPeters' room? I've lost my bearings.\"\n\nHe did not reflect that this was hardly the way in which valets\nin the best society addressed their superiors. That is the worst\nof adopting what might be called a character part. One can manage\nthe business well enough; it is the dialogue that provides the\npitfalls.\n\nMr. Baxter would have accorded a hearty agreement to the\nstatement that this was not the way in which a valet should have\nspoken to him; but at the moment he was not aware that Ashe was a\nvalet. From his easy mode of address he assumed that he was one\nof the numerous guests who had been arriving at the castle all\nday. As he had asked for Mr. Peters, he fancied that Ashe must be\nthe Honorable Freddie's American friend, George Emerson, whom he\nhad not yet met. Consequently he replied with much cordiality\nthat Mr. Peters' room was the second at the left on the second\nfloor.\n\nHe said Ashe could not miss it. Ashe said he was much obliged.\n\n\"Awfully good of you,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Baxter.\n\n\"You lose your way in a place like this,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"You certainly do,\" said Mr. Baxter.\n\nAshe went on his upward path and in a few moments was knocking at\nthe door indicated. And sure enough it was Mr. Peters' voice that\ninvited him to enter.\n\nMr. Peters, partially arrayed in the correct garb for gentlemen\nabout to dine, was standing in front of the mirror, wrestling\nwith his evening tie. As Ashe entered he removed his fingers and\nanxiously examined his handiwork. It proved unsatisfactory. With\na yelp and an oath, he tore the offending linen from his neck.\n\n\"Damn the thing!\"\n\nIt was plain to Ashe that his employer was in no sunny mood.\nThere are few things less calculated to engender sunniness in a\nnaturally bad-tempered man than a dress tie that will not let\nitself be pulled and twisted into the right shape. Even when\nthings went well, Mr. Peters hated dressing for dinner. Words\ncannot describe his feelings when they went wrong.\n\nThere is something to be said in excuse for this impatience: It\nis a hollow mockery to be obliged to deck one's person as for a\nfeast when that feast is to consist of a little asparagus and a\nfew nuts.\n\nMr. Peters' eye met Ashe's in the mirror.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it? Come in, then. Don't stand staring. Close\nthat door quick! Hustle! Don't scrape your feet on the floor.\nTry to look intelligent. Don't gape. Where have you been all this\nwhile? Why didn't you come before? Can you tie a tie? All right,\nthen--do it!\"\n\nSomewhat calmed by the snow-white butterfly-shaped creation that\ngrew under Ashe's fingers, he permitted himself to be helped into\nhis coat. He picked up the remnant of a black cigar from the\ndressing-table and relit it.\n\n\"I've been thinking about you,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Have you located the scarab yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What the devil have you been doing with yourself then? You've\nhad time to collar it a dozen times.\"\n\n\"I have been talking to the butler.\"\n\n\"What the devil do you waste time talking to butlers for? I\nsuppose you haven't even located the museum yet?\"\n\n\"Yes; I've done that.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have, have you? Well, that's something. And how do you\npropose setting about the job?\"\n\n\"The best plan would be to go there very late at night.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't propose to stroll in in the afternoon, did you?\nHow are you going to find the scarab when you do get in?\"\n\nAshe had not thought of that. The deeper he went into this\nbusiness the more things did there seem to be in it of which he\nhad not thought.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he confessed.\n\n\"You don't know! Tell me, young man, are you considered pretty\nbright, as Englishmen go?\"\n\n\"I am not English. I was born near Boston.\"\n\n\"Oh, you were, were you? You blanked bone-headed, bean-eating\nboob!\" cried Mr. Peters, frothing over quite unexpectedly and\nwaving his arms in a sudden burst of fury. \"Then if you are an\nAmerican why don't you show a little more enterprise? Why don't\nyou put something over? Why do you loaf about the place as though\nyou were supposed to be an ornament? I want results--and I want\nthem quick!\n\n\"I'll tell you how you can recognize my scarab when you get into\nthe museum. That shameless old green-goods man who sneaked it\nfrom me has had the gall, the nerve, to put it all by itself,\nwith a notice as big as a circus poster alongside of it saying\nthat it is a Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty, presented\"--Mr. Peters\nchoked--\"presented by J. Preston Peters, Esquire! That's how\nyou're going to recognize it.\"\n\nAshe did not laugh, but he nearly dislocated a rib in his effort\nto abstain from doing so. It seemed to him that this act on Lord\nEmsworth's part effectually disposed of the theory that Britons\nhave no sense of humor. To rob a man of his choicest possession\nand then thank him publicly for letting you have it appealed to\nAshe as excellent comedy.\n\n\"The thing isn't even in a glass case,\" continued Mr. Peters.\n\"It's lying on an open tray on top of a cabinet of Roman coins.\nAnybody who was left alone for two minutes in the place could\ntake it! It's criminal carelessness to leave a valuable scarab\nabout like that. If Lord Jesse James was going to steal my Cheops\nhe might at least have had the decency to treat it as though it\nwas worth something.\"\n\n\"But it makes it easier for me to get it,\" said Ashe consolingly.\n\n\"It's got to be made easy if you are to get it!\" snapped Mr.\nPeters. \"Here's another thing: You say you are going to try for\nit late at night. Well, what are you going to do if anyone\ncatches you prowling round at that time? Have you considered\nthat?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You would have to say something, wouldn't you? You wouldn't chat\nabout the weather, would you? You wouldn't discuss the latest\nplay? You would have to think up some mighty good reason for\nbeing out of bed at that time, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do admit that, do you? Well, what you would say is this:\nYou would explain that I had rung for you to come and read me to\nsleep. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"You think that would be a satisfactory explanation of my being\nin the museum?\"\n\n\"Idiot! I don't mean that you're to say it if you're caught\nactually in the museum. If you're caught in the museum the best\nthing you can do is to say nothing, and hope that the judge will\nlet you off light because it's your first offense. You're to say\nit if you're found wandering about on your way there.\"\n\n\"It sounds thin to me.\"\n\n\"Does it? Well, let me tell you that it isn't so thin as you\nsuppose, for it's what you will actually have to do most nights.\nTwo nights out of three I have to be read to sleep. My\nindigestion gives me insomnia.\" As though to push this fact home,\nMr. Peters suddenly bent double. \"Oof!\" he said. \"Wow!\" He\nremoved the cigar from his mouth and inserted a digestive\ntabloid. \"The lining of my stomach is all wrong,\" he added.\n\nIt is curious how trivial are the immediate causes that produce\nrevolutions. If Mr. Peters had worded his complaint differently\nAshe would in all probability have borne it without active\nprotest. He had been growing more and more annoyed with this\nlittle person who buzzed and barked and bit at him, yet the idea\nof definite revolt had not occurred to him. But his sufferings at\nthe hands of Beach, the butler, had reduced him to a state where\nhe could endure no further mention of stomachic linings. There\ncomes a time when our capacity for listening to detailed data\nabout the linings of other people's stomachs is exhausted.\n\nHe looked at Mr. Peters sternly. He had ceased to be intimidated\nby the fiery little man and regarded him simply as a\nhypochondriac, who needed to be told a few useful facts.\n\n\"How do you expect not to have indigestion? You take no exercise\nand you smoke all day long.\"\n\nThe novel sensation of being criticized--and by a beardless youth\nat that--held Mr. Peters silent. He started convulsively, but he\ndid not speak. Ashe, on his pet subject, became eloquent. In his\nopinion dyspeptics cumbered the earth. To his mind they had the\nchoice between health and sickness, and they deliberately chose\nthe latter.\n\n\"Your sort of man makes me angry. I know your type inside out.\nYou overwork and shirk exercise, and let your temper run away\nwith you, and smoke strong cigars on an empty stomach; and when\nyou get indigestion as a natural result you look on yourself as a\nmartyr, nourish a perpetual grouch, and make the lives of\neverybody you meet miserable. If you would put yourself into my\nhands for a month I would have you eating bricks and thriving on\nthem. Up in the morning, Larsen Exercises, cold bath, a brisk\nrubdown, sharp walk--\"\n\n\"Who the devil asked your opinion, you impertinent young hound?\"\ninquired Mr. Peters.\n\n\"Don't interrupt--confound you!\" shouted Ashe. \"Now you have made\nme forget what I was going to say.\"\n\nThere was a tense silence. Then Mr. Peters began to speak:\n\n\"You--infernal--impudent--\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me like that!\"\n\n\"I'll talk to you just--\"\n\nAshe took a step toward the door. \"Very well, then,\" he said.\n\"I'll quit! I'm through! You can get somebody else to do this job\nof yours for you.\"\n\nThe sudden sagging of Mr. Peters' jaw, the look of consternation\nthat flashed on his face, told Ashe he had found the right\nweapon--that the game was in his hands. He continued with a\nfeeling of confidence:\n\n\"If I had known what being your valet involved I wouldn't have\nundertaken the thing for a hundred thousand dollars. Just because\nyou had some idiotic prejudice against letting me come down here\nas your secretary, which would have been the simple and obvious\nthing, I find myself in a position where at any moment I may be\npublicly rebuked by the butler and have the head stillroom maid\nlooking at me as though I were something the cat had brought in.\"\n\nHis voice trembled with self-pity.\n\n\"Do you realize a fraction of the awful things you have let me in\nfor? How on earth am I to remember whether I go in before the\nchef or after the third footman? I shan't have a peaceful minute\nwhile I'm in this place. I've got to sit and listen by the hour\nto a bore of a butler who seems to be a sort of walking hospital.\nI've got to steer my way through a complicated system of\netiquette.\n\n\"And on top of all that you have the nerve, the insolence, to\nimagine that you can use me as a punching bag to work your bad\ntemper off! You have the immortal rind to suppose that I will\nstand for being nagged and bullied by you whenever your suicidal\nway of living brings on an attack of indigestion! You have the\nsupreme gall to fancy that you can talk as you please to me!\n\n\"Very well! I've had enough of it. I resign! If you want this\nscarab of yours recovered let somebody else do it. I've retired\nfrom business.\"\n\nHe took another step toward the door. A shaking hand clutched at\nhis sleeve.\n\n\"My boy--my dear boy--be reasonable!\"\n\nAshe was intoxicated with his own oratory. The sensation of\nbullyragging a genuine millionaire was new and exhilarating. He\nexpanded his chest and spread his feet like a colossus.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" he said, coldly disentangling himself\nfrom the hand. \"You can't get out of it like that. We have got to\ncome to an understanding. The point is that if I am to be\nsubjected to your--your senile malevolence every time you have a\ntwinge of indigestion, no amount of money could pay me to stop\non.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, it shall not occur again. I was hasty.\"\n\nMr. Peters, with agitated fingers, relit the stump of his cigar.\n\n\"Throw away that cigar!\"\n\n\"My boy!\"\n\n\"Throw it away! You say you were hasty. Of course you were hasty;\nand as long as you abuse your digestion you will go on being\nhasty. I want something better than apologies. If I am to stop\nhere we must get to the root of things. You must put yourself in\nmy hands as though I were your doctor. No more cigars. Every\nmorning regular exercises.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\n\"No; stop! Stop! What sort of exercises?\"\n\n\"I'll show you to-morrow morning. Brisk walks.\"\n\n\"I hate walking.\"\n\n\"Cold baths.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\n\"No; stop! A cold bath would kill me at my age.\"\n\n\"It would put new life into you. Do you consent to the cold\nbaths? No? Very well!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"You promise?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"All right, then.\"\n\nThe distant sound of the dinner gong floated in.\n\n\"We settled that just in time,\" said Ashe.\n\nMr. Peters regarded him fixedly.\n\n\"Young man,\" he said slowly, \"if, after all this, you fail to\nrecover my Cheops for me I'll--I'll--By George, I'll skin you!\"\n\n\"Don't talk like that,\" said Ashe. \"That's another thing you have\ngot to remember. If my treatment is to be successful you must not\nlet yourself think in that way. You must exercise self-control\nmentally. You must think beautiful thoughts.\"\n\n\"The idea of skinning you is a beautiful thought!\" said Mr.\nPeters wistfully.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIn order that their gayety might not be diminished--and the food\nturned to ashes in their mouths by the absence from the festive\nboard of Mr. Beach, it was the custom for the upper servants at\nBlandings to postpone the start of their evening meal until\ndinner was nearly over above-stairs. This enabled the butler to\ntake his place at the head of the table without fear of\ninterruption, except for the few moments when coffee was being\nserved.\n\nEvery night shortly before half-past eight--at which hour Mr.\nBeach felt that he might safely withdraw from the dining-room and\nleave Lord Emsworth and his guests to the care of Merridew, the\nunder-butler, and James and Alfred, the footmen, returning only\nfor a few minutes to lend tone and distinction to the\ndistribution of cigars and liqueurs--those whose rank entitled\nthem to do so made their way to the housekeeper's room, to pass\nin desultory conversation the interval before Mr. Beach should\narrive, and a kitchen maid, with the appearance of one who has\nbeen straining at the leash and has at last managed to get free,\nopened the door, with the announcement: \"Mr. Beach, if you please,\ndinner is served.\" On which Mr. Beach, extending a crooked elbow\ntoward the housekeeper, would say, \"Mrs. Twemlow!\" and lead the\nway, high and disposedly, down the passage, followed in order of\nrank by the rest of the company, in couples, to the steward's\nroom.\n\nFor Blandings was not one of those houses--or shall we say\nhovels?--where the upper servants are expected not only to feed\nbut to congregate before feeding in the steward's room. Under the\nauspices of Mr. Beach and of Mrs. Twemlow, who saw eye to eye\nwith him in these matters, things were done properly at the\ncastle, with the correct solemnity. To Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow\nthe suggestion that they and their peers should gather together\nin the same room in which they were to dine would have been as\nrepellent as an announcement from Lady Ann Warblington, the\nchatelaine, that the house party would eat in the drawing-room.\n\nWhen Ashe, returning from his interview with Mr. Peters, was\nintercepted by a respectful small boy and conducted to the\nhousekeeper's room, he was conscious of a sensation of shrinking\ninferiority akin to his emotions on his first day at school. The\nroom was full and apparently on very cordial terms with itself.\nEverybody seemed to know everybody and conversation was\nproceeding in a manner reminiscent of an Old Home Week.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the house party at Blandings being in the\nmain a gathering together of the Emsworth clan by way of honor\nand as a means of introduction to Mr. Peters and his daughter,\nthe bride-of-the-house-to-be, most of the occupants of the\nhousekeeper's room were old acquaintances and were renewing\ninterrupted friendships at the top of their voices.\n\nA lull followed Ashe's arrival and all eyes, to his great\ndiscomfort, were turned in his direction. His embarrassment was\nrelieved by Mrs. Twemlow, who advanced to do the honors. Of Mrs.\nTwemlow little need be attempted in the way of pen portraiture\nbeyond the statement that she went as harmoniously with Mr.\nBeach as one of a pair of vases or one of a brace of pheasants\ngoes with its fellow. She had the same appearance of imminent\napoplexy, the same air of belonging to some dignified and haughty\nbranch of the vegetable kingdom.\n\n\"Mr. Marson, welcome to Blandings Castle!\"\n\nAshe had been waiting for somebody to say this, and had been a\nlittle surprised that Mr. Beach had not done so. He was also\nsurprised at the housekeeper's ready recognition of his identity,\nuntil he saw Joan in the throng and deduced that she must have\nbeen the source of information.\n\nHe envied Joan. In some amazing way she contrived to look not out\nof place in this gathering. He himself, he felt, had impostor\nstamped in large characters all over him.\n\nMrs. Twemlow began to make the introductions--a long and tedious\nprocess, which she performed relentlessly, without haste and\nwithout scamping her work. With each member of the aristocracy of\nhis new profession Ashe shook hands, and on each member he\nsmiled, until his facial and dorsal muscles were like to crack\nunder the strain. It was amazing that so many high-class\ndomestics could be collected into one moderate-sized room.\n\n\"Miss Simpson you know,\" said Mrs. Twemlow, and Ashe was about to\ndeny the charge when he perceived that Joan was the individual\nreferred to. \"Mr. Judson, Mr. Marson. Mr. Judson is the Honorable\nFrederick's gentleman.\"\n\n\"You have not the pleasure of our Freddie's acquaintance as yet,\nI take it, Mr. Marson?\" observed Mr. Judson genially, a\nsmooth-faced, lazy-looking young man. \"Freddie repays\ninspection.\"\n\n\"Mr. Marson, permit me to introduce you to Mr. Ferris, Lord\nStockheath's gentleman.\"\n\nMr. Ferris, a dark, cynical man, with a high forehead, shook Ashe\nby the hand.\n\n\"Happy to meet you, Mr. Marson.\"\n\n\"Miss Willoughby, this is Mr. Marson, who will take you in to\ndinner. Miss Willoughby is Lady Mildred Mant's lady. As of course\nyou are aware, Lady Mildred, our eldest daughter, married Colonel\nHorace Mant, of the Scots Guards.\"\n\nAshe was not aware, and he was rather surprised that Mrs. Twemlow\nshould have a daughter whose name was Lady Mildred; but reason,\ncoming to his rescue, suggested that by our she meant the\noffspring of the Earl of Emsworth and his late countess. Miss\nWilloughby was a light-hearted damsel, with a smiling face and\nchestnut hair, done low over her forehead.\n\nSince etiquette forbade that he should take Joan in to dinner,\nAshe was glad that at least an apparently pleasant substitute had\nbeen provided. He had just been introduced to an appallingly\nstatuesque lady of the name of Chester, Lady Ann Warblington's\nown maid, and his somewhat hazy recollections of Joan's lecture\non below-stairs precedence had left him with the impression that\nthis was his destined partner. He had frankly quailed at the\nprospect of being linked to so much aristocratic hauteur.\n\nWhen the final introduction had been made conversation broke out\nagain. It dealt almost exclusively, so far as Ashe could follow\nit, with the idiosyncrasies of the employers of those present. He\ntook it that this happened down the entire social scale below\nstairs. Probably the lower servants in the servants' hall\ndiscussed the upper servants in the room, and the still lower\nservants in the housemaids' sitting-room discussed their\nsuperiors of the servants' hall, and the stillroom gossiped about\nthe housemaids' sitting-room.\n\nHe wondered which was the bottom circle of all, and came to the\nconclusion that it was probably represented by the small\nrespectful boy who had acted as his guide a short while before.\nThis boy, having nobody to discuss anybody with, presumably sat\nin solitary meditation, brooding on the odd-job man.\n\nHe thought of mentioning this theory to Miss Willoughby, but\ndecided that it was too abstruse for her, and contented himself\nwith speaking of some of the plays he had seen before leaving\nLondon. Miss Willoughby was an enthusiast on the drama; and,\nColonel Mant's military duties keeping him much in town, she had\nhad wide opportunities of indulging her tastes. Miss Willoughby\ndid not like the country. She thought it dull.\n\n\"Don't you think the country dull, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"I shan't find it dull here,\" said Ashe; and he was surprised to\ndiscover, through the medium of a pleased giggle, that he was\nconsidered to have perpetrated a compliment.\n\nMr. Beach appeared in due season, a little distrait, as becomes a\nman who has just been engaged on important and responsible\nduties.\n\n\"Alfred spilled the hock!\" Ashe heard him announce to Mrs.\nTwemlow in a bitter undertone. \"Within half an inch of his\nlordship's arm he spilled it.\"\n\nMrs. Twemlow murmured condolences. Mr. Beach's set expression was\nof one who is wondering how long the strain of existence can be\nsupported.\n\n\"Mr. Beach, if you please, dinner is served.\"\n\nThe butler crushed down sad thoughts and crooked his elbow.\n\n\"Mrs. Twemlow!\"\n\nAshe, miscalculating degrees of rank in spite of all his caution,\nwas within a step of leaving the room out of his proper turn; but\nthe startled pressure of Miss Willoughby's hand on his arm warned\nhim in time. He stopped, to allow the statuesque Miss Chester to\nsail out under escort of a wizened little man with a horseshoe\npin in his tie, whose name, in company with nearly all the others\nthat had been spoken to him since he came into the room, had\nescaped Ashe's memory.\n\n\"You were nearly making a bloomer!\" said Miss Willoughby\nbrightly. \"You must be absent-minded, Mr. Marson--like his\nlordship.\"\n\n\"Is Lord Emsworth absent-minded?\"\n\nMiss Willoughby laughed.\n\n\"Why, he forgets his own name sometimes! If it wasn't for Mr.\nBaxter, goodness knows what would happen to him.\"\n\n\"I don't think I know Mr. Baxter.\"\n\n\"You will if you stay here long. You can't get away from him if\nyou're in the same house. Don't tell anyone I said so; but he's\nthe real master here. His lordship's secretary he calls himself;\nbut he's really everything rolled into one--like the man in the\nplay.\"\n\nAshe, searching in his dramatic memories for such a person in a\nplay, inquired whether Miss Willoughby meant Pooh-Bah, in \"The\nMikado,\" of which there had been a revival in London recently.\nMiss Willoughby did mean Pooh-Bah.\n\n\"But Nosy Parker is what I call him,\" she said. \"He minds\neverybody's business as well as his own.\"\n\nThe last of the procession trickled into the steward's room.\nMr. Beach said grace somewhat patronizingly. The meal began.\n\n\"You've seen Miss Peters, of course, Mr. Marson?\" said Miss\nWilloughby, resuming conversation with the soup.\n\n\"Just for a few minutes at Paddington.\"\n\n\"Oh! You haven't been with Mr. Peters long, then?\"\n\nAshe began to wonder whether everybody he met was going to ask\nhim this dangerous question.\n\n\"Only a day or so.\"\n\n\"Where were you before that?\"\n\nAshe was conscious of a prickly sensation. A little more of this\nand he might as well reveal his true mission at the castle and\nhave done with it.\n\n\"Oh, I was--that is to say----\"\n\n\"How are you feeling after the journey, Mr. Marson?\" said a voice\nfrom the other side of the table; and Ashe, looking up\ngratefully, found Joan's eyes looking into his with a curiously\namused expression.\n\nHe was too grateful for the interruption to try to account for\nthis. He replied that he was feeling very well, which was not the\ncase. Miss Willoughby's interest was diverted to a discussion of\nthe defects of the various railroad systems of Great Britain.\n\nAt the head of the table Mr. Beach had started an intimate\nconversation with Mr. Ferris, the valet of Lord Stockheath, the\nHonorable Freddie's \"poor old Percy\"--a cousin, Ashe had\ngathered, of Aline Peters' husband-to-be. The butler spoke in\nmore measured tones even than usual, for he was speaking of\ntragedy.\n\n\"We were all extremely sorry, Mr. Ferris, to read of your\nmisfortune.\"\n\nAshe wondered what had been happening to Mr. Ferris.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Beach,\" replied the valet, \"it's a fact we made a\npretty poor show.\" He took a sip from his glass. \"There is no\nconcealing the fact--I have never tried to conceal it--that poor\nPercy is not bright.\"\n\nMiss Chester entered the conversation.\n\n\"I couldn't see where the girl--what's her name? was so very\npretty. All the papers had pieces where it said she was\nattractive, and what not; but she didn't look anything special to\nme from her photograph in the Mirror. What his lordship could see\nin her I can't understand.\"\n\n\"The photo didn't quite do her justice, Miss Chester. I was\npresent in court, and I must admit she was svelte--decidedly\nsvelte. And you must recollect that Percy, from childhood up, has\nalways been a highly susceptible young nut. I speak as one who\nknows him.\"\n\nMr. Beach turned to Joan.\n\n\"We are speaking of the Stockheath breach-of-promise case, Miss\nSimpson, of which you doubtless read in the newspapers. Lord\nStockheath is a nephew of ours. I fancy his lordship was greatly\nshocked at the occurrence.\"\n\n\"He was,\" chimed in Mr. Judson from down the table. \"I happened\nto overhear him speaking of it to young Freddie. It was in the\nlibrary on the morning when the judge made his final summing up\nand slipped it into Lord Stockheath so proper. 'If ever anything\nof this sort happens to you, you young scalawag,' he says to\nFreddie--\"\n\nMr. Beach coughed. \"Mr. Judson!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right, Mr. Beach; we're all in the family here, in\na manner of speaking. It wasn't as though I was telling it to a\nlot of outsiders. I'm sure none of these ladies or gentlemen\nwill let it go beyond this room?\"\n\nThe company murmured virtuous acquiescence.\n\n\"He says to Freddie: 'You young scalawag, if ever anything of\nthis sort happens to you, you can pack up and go off to Canada,\nfor I'll have nothing more to do with you!'--or words to that\neffect. And Freddie says: 'Oh, dash it all, gov'nor, you\nknow--what?'\"\n\nHowever short Mr. Judson's imitation of his master's voice may\nhave fallen of histrionic perfection, it pleased the company. The\nroom shook with mirth.\n\n\"Mr. Judson is clever, isn't he, Mr. Marson?\" whispered Miss\nWilloughby, gazing with adoring eyes at the speaker.\n\nMr. Beach thought it expedient to deflect the conversation. By\nthe unwritten law of the room every individual had the right to\nspeak as freely as he wished about his own personal employer; but\nJudson, in his opinion, sometimes went a trifle too far.\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Ferris,\" he said, \"does his lordship seem to bear\nit well?\"\n\n\"Oh, Percy is bearing it well enough.\"\n\nAshe noted as a curious fact that, though the actual valet of any\nperson under discussion spoke of him almost affectionately by his\nChristian name, the rest of the company used the greatest\nceremony and gave him his title with all respect. Lord Stockheath\nwas Percy to Mr. Ferris, and the Honorable Frederick Threepwood\nwas Freddie to Mr. Judson; but to Ferris, Mr. Judson's Freddie\nwas the Honorable Frederick, and to Judson Mr. Ferris' Percy was\nLord Stockheath. It was rather a pleasant form of etiquette, and\nstruck Ashe as somehow vaguely feudal.\n\n\"Percy,\" went on Mr. Ferris, \"is bearing it like a little\nBriton--the damages not having come out of his pocket! It's his\nold father--who had to pay them--that's taking it to heart. You\nmight say he's doing himself proud. He says it's brought on his\ngout again, and that's why he's gone to Droitwich instead of\ncoming here. I dare say Percy isn't sorry.\"\n\n\"It has been,\" said Mr. Beach, summing up, \"a most unfortunate\noccurrence. The modern tendency of the lower classes to get above\nthemselves is becoming more marked every day. The young female in\nthis case was, I understand, a barmaid. It is deplorable that our\nyoung men should allow themselves to get into such\nentanglements.\"\n\n\"The wonder to me,\" said the irrepressible Mr. Judson, \"is that\nmore of these young chaps don't get put through it. His lordship\nwasn't so wide of the mark when he spoke like that to Freddie in\nthe library that time. I give you my word, it's a mercy young\nFreddie hasn't been up against it! When we were in London,\nFreddie and I,\" he went on, cutting through Mr. Beach's\ndisapproving cough, \"before what you might call the crash, when\nhis lordship cut off supplies and had him come back and live\nhere, Freddie was asking for it--believe me! Fell in love with a\ngirl in the chorus of one of the theaters. Used to send me to the\nstage door with notes and flowers every night for weeks, as\nregular as clockwork.\n\n\"What was her name? It's on the tip of my tongue. Funny how you\nforget these things! Freddie was pretty far gone. I recollect\nonce, happening to be looking round his room in his absence,\ncoming on a poem he had written to her. It was hot stuff--very\nhot! If that girl has kept those letters it's my belief we shall\nsee Freddie following in Lord Stockheath's footsteps.\"\n\nThere was a hush of delighted horror round the table.\n\n\"Goo',\" said Miss Chester's escort with unction. \"You don't say\nso, Mr. Judson! It wouldn't half make them look silly if the\nHonorable Frederick was sued for breach just now, with the\nwedding coming on!\"\n\n\"There is no danger of that.\"\n\nIt was Joan's voice, and she had spoken with such decision that\nshe had the ear of the table immediately. All eyes looked in her\ndirection. Ashe was struck with her expression. Her eyes were\nshining as though she were angry; and there was a flush on her\nface. A phrase he had used in the train came back to him. She\nlooked like a princess in disguise.\n\n\"What makes you say that, Miss Simpson?\" inquired Judson,\nannoyed. He had been at pains to make the company's flesh creep,\nand it appeared to be Joan's aim to undo his work.\n\nIt seemed to Ashe that Joan made an effort of some sort as though\nshe were pulling herself together and remembering where she was.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, almost lamely, \"I don't think it at all likely\nthat he proposed marriage to this girl.\"\n\n\"You never can tell,\" said Judson. \"My impression is that Freddie\ndid. It's my belief that there's something on his mind these\ndays. Before he went to London with his lordship the other day he\nwas behaving very strange. And since he came back it's my belief\nthat he has been brooding. And I happen to know he followed the\naffair of Lord Stockheath pretty closely, for he clipped the\nclippings out of the paper. I found them myself one day when I\nhappened to be going through his things.\"\n\nBeach cleared his throat--his mode of indicating that he was\nabout to monopolize the conversation.\n\n\"And in any case, Miss Simpson,\" he said solemnly, \"with things\ncome to the pass they have come to, and the juries--drawn from\nthe lower classes--in the nasty mood they're in, it don't seem\nhardly necessary in these affairs for there to have been any\ndefinite promise of marriage. What with all this socialism\nrampant, they seem so happy at the idea of being able to do one\nof us an injury that they give heavy damages without it. A few\nardent expressions, and that's enough for them. You recollect the\nHavant case, and when young Lord Mount Anville was sued? What it\ncomes to is that anarchy is getting the upper hand, and the lower\nclasses are getting above themselves. It's all these here cheap\nnewspapers that does it. They tempt the lower classes to get\nabove themselves.\n\n\"Only this morning I had to speak severe to that young fellow,\nJames, the footman. He was a good young fellow once and did his\nwork well, and had a proper respect for people; but now he's gone\nall to pieces. And why? Because six months ago he had the\nrheumatism, and had the audacity to send his picture and a\ntestimonial, saying that it had cured him of awful agonies, to\nWalkinshaw's Supreme Ointment, and they printed it in half a\ndozen papers; and it has been the ruin of James. He has got above\nhimself and don't care for nobody.\"\n\n\"Well, all I can say is,\" resumed Judson, \"that I hope to\ngoodness nothing won't happen to Freddie of that kind; for it's\nnot every girl that would have him.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of assent to this truth.\n\n\"Now your Miss Peters,\" said Judson tolerantly--\"she seems a nice\nlittle thing.\"\n\n\"She would be pleased to hear you say so,\" said Joan.\n\n\"Joan Valentine!\" cried Judson, bringing his hands down on the\ntablecloth with a bang. \"I've just remembered it. That was the\nname of the girl Freddie used to write the letters and poems to;\nand that's who it is I've been trying all along to think you\nreminded me of, Miss Simpson. You're the living image of\nFreddie's Miss Joan Valentine.\"\n\nAshe was not normally a young man of particularly ready wit; but\non this occasion it may have been that the shock of this\nrevelation, added to the fact that something must be done\nspeedily if Joan's discomposure was not to become obvious to all\npresent, quickened his intelligence. Joan, usually so sure of\nherself, so ready of resource, had gone temporarily to pieces.\nShe was quite white, and her eyes met Ashe's with almost a hunted\nexpression.\n\nIf the attention of the company was to be diverted, something\ndrastic must be done. A mere verbal attempt to change the\nconversation would be useless. Inspiration descended on Ashe.\n\nIn the days of his childhood in Hayling, Massachusetts, he had\nplayed truant from Sunday school again and again in order to\nfrequent the society of one Eddie Waffles, the official bad boy\nof the locality. It was not so much Eddie's charm of conversation\nwhich had attracted him--though that had been great--as the fact\nthat Eddie, among his other accomplishments, could give a\nlifelike imitation of two cats fighting in a back yard; and Ashe\nfelt that he could never be happy until he had acquired this gift\nfrom the master.\n\nIn course of time he had done so. It might be that his absences\nfrom Sunday school in the cause of art had left him in later\nyears a trifle shaky on the subject of the Kings of Judah, but\nhis hard-won accomplishment had made him in request at every\nsmoking concert at Oxford; and it saved the situation now.\n\n\"Have you ever heard two cats fighting in a back yard?\" he\ninquired casually of his neighbor, Miss Willoughby.\n\nThe next moment the performance was in full swing. Young Master\nWaffles, who had devoted considerable study to his subject, had\nconceived the combat of his imaginary cats in a broad, almost\nHomeric, vein. The unpleasantness opened with a low gurgling\nsound, answered by another a shade louder and possibly more\nquerulous. A momentary silence was followed by a long-drawn note,\nlike rising wind, cut off abruptly and succeeded by a grumbling\nmutter. The response to this was a couple of sharp howls. Both\nparties to the contest then indulged in a discontented whining,\ngrowing louder and louder until the air was full of electric\nmenace. And then, after another sharp silence, came war, noisy\nand overwhelming.\n\nStanding at Master Waffles' side, you could follow almost every\nmovement of that intricate fray, and mark how now one and now the\nother of the battlers gained a short-lived advantage. It was a\ngreat fight. Shrewd blows were taken and given, and in the eye of\nthe imagination you could see the air thick with flying fur.\nLouder and louder grew the din; and then, at its height, it\nceased in one crescendo of tumult, and all was still, save for a\nfaint, angry moaning.\n\nSuch was the cat fight of Master Eddie Waffles; and Ashe, though\nfalling short of the master, as a pupil must, rendered it\nfaithfully and with energy.\n\nTo say that the attention of the company was diverted from Mr.\nJudson and his remarks by the extraordinary noises which\nproceeded from Ashe's lips would be to offer a mere shadowy\nsuggestion of the sensation caused by his efforts. At first,\nstunned surprise, then consternation, greeted him. Beach, the\nbutler, was staring as one watching a miracle, nearer apparently\nto apoplexy than ever. On the faces of the others every shade of\nemotion was to be seen.\n\nThat this should be happening in the steward's room at Blandings\nCastle was scarcely less amazing than if it had taken place in a\ncathedral. The upper servants, rigid in their seats, looked at\neach other, like Cortes' soldiers--\"with a wild surmise.\"\n\nThe last faint moan of feline defiance died away and silence fell\non the room. Ashe turned to Miss Willoughby.\n\n\"Just like that!\" he said. \"I was telling Miss Willoughby,\" he\nadded apologetically to Mrs. Twemlow, \"about the cats in London.\nThey were a great trial.\"\n\nFor perhaps three seconds his social reputation swayed to and fro\nin the balance, while the company pondered on what he had done.\nIt was new; but it was humorous--or was it vulgar? There is\nnothing the English upper servant so abhors as vulgarity. That\nwas what the steward's room was trying to make up its mind about.\n\nThen Miss Willoughby threw her shapely head back and the squeal\nof her laughter smote the ceiling. And at that the company made\nits decision. Everybody laughed. Everybody urged Ashe to give an\nencore. Everybody was his friend and admirer---everybody but\nBeach, the butler. Beach, the butler, was shocked to his very\ncore. His heavy-lidded eyes rested on Ashe with disapproval. It\nseemed to Beach, the butler, that this young man Marson had got\nabove himself.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAshe found Joan at his side. Dinner was over and the diners were\nmaking for the housekeeper's room.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Marson. That was very good of you and very\nclever.\" Her eyes twinkled. \"But what a terrible chance you took!\nYou have made yourself a popular success, but you might just as\neasily have become a social outcast. As it is, I am afraid Mr.\nBeach did not approve.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he didn't. In a minute or so I'm going to fawn on him\nand make all well.\"\n\nJoan lowered her voice.\n\n\"It was quite true, what that odious little man said. Freddie\nThreepwood did write me letters. Of course I destroyed them long\nago.\"\n\n\"But weren't you running the risk in coming here that he might\nrecognize you? Wouldn't that make it rather unpleasant for you?\"\n\n\"I never met him, you see. He only wrote to me. When he came to\nthe station to meet us this evening he looked startled to see me;\nso I suppose he remembers my appearance. But Aline will have told\nhim that my name is Simpson.\"\n\n\"That fellow Judson said he was brooding. I think you ought to\nput him out of his misery.\"\n\n\"Mr. Judson must have been letting his imagination run away with\nhim. He is out of his misery. He sent a horrid fat man named\nJones to see me in London about the letters, and I told him I had\ndestroyed them. He must have let him know that by this time.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nThey went into the housekeeper's room. Mr. Beach was standing\nbefore the fire. Ashe went up to him. It was not an easy matter\nto mollify Mr. Beach. Ashe tried the most tempting topics. He\nmentioned swollen feet--he dangled the lining of Mr. Beach's\nstomach temptingly before his eyes; but the butler was not to be\nsoftened. Only when Ashe turned the conversation to the subject\nof the museum did a flicker of animation stir him.\n\nMr. Beach was fond and proud of the Blandings Castle museum. It\nhad been the means of getting him into print for the first and\nonly time in his life. A year before, a representative of the\nIntelligencer and Echo, from the neighboring town of Blatchford,\nhad come to visit the castle on behalf of his paper; and he had\nbegun one section of his article with the words: \"Under the\nauspices of Mr. Beach, my genial cicerone, I then visited his\nlordship's museum--\" Mr. Beach treasured the clipping in a\nspecial writing-desk.\n\nHe responded almost amiably to Ashe's questions. Yes; he had seen\nthe scarab--he pronounced it scayrub--which Mr. Peters had\npresented to his lordship. He understood that his lordship\nthought very highly of Mr. Peters' scayrub. He had overheard Mr.\nBaxter telling his lordship that it was extremely valuable.\n\n\"Mr. Beach,\" said Ashe, \"I wonder whether you would take me to\nsee Lord Emsworth's museum?\"\n\nMr. Beach regarded him heavily.\n\n\"I shall be pleased to take you to see his lordship's museum,\" he\nreplied.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nOne can attribute only to the nervous mental condition following\nthe interview he had had with Ashe in his bedroom the rash act\nMr. Peters attempted shortly after dinner.\n\nMr. Peters, shortly after dinner, was in a dangerous and reckless\nmood. He had had a wretched time all through the meal. The\nBlandings chef had extended himself in honor of the house party,\nand had produced a succession of dishes, which in happier days\nMr. Peters would have devoured eagerly. To be compelled by\nconsiderations of health to pass these by was enough to damp the\nliveliest optimist. Mr. Peters had suffered terribly. Occasions\nof feasting and revelry like the present were for him so many\nbattlefields, on which greed fought with prudence.\n\nAll through dinner he brooded on Ashe's defiance and the horrors\nwhich were to result from that defiance. One of Mr. Peters' most\npainful memories was of a two weeks' visit he had once paid to\nMr. Muldoon in his celebrated establishment at White Plains. He\nhad been persuaded to go there by a brother millionaire whom,\nuntil then, he had always regarded as a friend. The memory of Mr.\nMuldoon's cold shower baths and brisk system of physical exercise\nstill lingered.\n\nThe thought that under Ashe's rule he was to go through privately\nvery much what he had gone through in the company of a gang of\nother unfortunates at Muldoon's froze him with horror. He knew\nthose health cranks who believed that all mortal ailments could\nbe cured by cold showers and brisk walks. They were all alike and\nthey nearly killed you. His worst nightmare was the one where he\ndreamed he was back at Muldoon's, leading his horse up that\nendless hill outside the village.\n\nHe would not stand it! He would be hanged if he'd stand it! He\nwould defy Ashe. But if he defied Ashe, Ashe would go away; and\nthen whom could he find to recover his lost scarab?\n\nMr. Peters began to appreciate the true meaning of the phrase\nabout the horns of a dilemma. The horns of this dilemma occupied\nhis attention until the end of the dinner. He shifted uneasily\nfrom one to the other and back again. He rose from the table in a\nthoroughly overwrought condition of mind. And then, somehow, in\nthe course of the evening, he found himself alone in the hall,\nnot a dozen feet from the unlocked museum door.\n\nIt was not immediately that he appreciated the significance of\nthis fact. He had come to the hall because its solitude suited\nhis mood. It was only after he had finished a cigar--Ashe could\nnot stop his smoking after dinner--that it suddenly flashed on\nhim that he had ready at hand a solution of all his troubles. A\nbrief minute's resolute action and the scarab would be his again,\nand the menace of Ashe a thing of the past. He glanced about him.\nYes; he was alone.\n\nNot once since the removal of the scarab had begun to exercise\nhis mind had Mr. Peters contemplated for an instant the\npossibility of recovering it himself. The prospect of the\nunpleasantness that would ensue had been enough to make him\nregard such an action as out of the question. The risk was too\ngreat to be considered for a moment; but here he was, in a\nposition where the risk was negligible!\n\nLike Ashe, he had always visualized the recovery of his scarab as\na thing of the small hours, a daring act to be performed when\nsleep held the castle in its grip. That an opportunity would be\npresented to him of walking in quite calmly and walking out again\nwith the Cheops in his pocket, had never occurred to him as a\npossibility.\n\nYet now this chance was presenting itself in all its simplicity,\nand all he had to do was to grasp it. The door of the museum was\nnot even closed. He could see from where he stood that it was\najar.\n\nHe moved cautiously in its direction--not in a straight line as\none going to a museum, but circuitously as one strolling without\nan aim. From time to time he glanced over his shoulder. He\nreached the door, hesitated, and passed it. He turned, reached\nthe door again--and again passed it. He stood for a moment\ndarting his eyes about the hall; then, in a burst of resolution,\nhe dashed for the door and shot in like a rabbit.\n\nAt the same moment the Efficient Baxter, who, from the shelter of\na pillar on the gallery that ran around two-thirds of the hall,\nhad been eyeing the peculiar movements of the distinguished guest\nwith considerable interest for some minutes, began to descend the\nstairs.\n\nRupert Baxter, the Earl of Emsworth's indefatigable private\nsecretary, was one of those men whose chief characteristic is a\nvague suspicion of their fellow human beings. He did not suspect\nthem of this or that definite crime; he simply suspected them. He\nprowled through life as we are told the hosts of Midian prowled.\n\nHis powers in this respect were well-known at Blandings Castle.\nThe Earl of Emsworth said: \"Baxter is invaluable--positively\ninvaluable.\" The Honorable Freddie said: \"A chappie can't take a\nstep in this bally house without stumbling over that damn feller,\nBaxter!\" The manservant and the maidservant within the gates,\nlike Miss Willoughby, employing that crisp gift for\ncharacterization which is the property of the English lower\norders, described him as a Nosy Parker.\n\nPeering over the railing of the balcony and observing the curious\nmovements of Mr. Peters, who, as a matter of fact, while making\nup his mind to approach the door, had been backing and filling\nabout the hall in a quaint serpentine manner like a man trying to\ninvent a new variety of the tango, the Efficient Baxter had found\nhimself in some way--why, he did not know--of what, he could not\nsay--but in some nebulous way, suspicious.\n\nHe had not definitely accused Mr. Peters in his mind of any\nspecific tort or malfeasance. He had merely felt that something\nfishy was toward. He had a sixth sense in such matters.\n\nBut when Mr. Peters, making up his mind, leaped into the museum,\nBaxter's suspicions lost their vagueness and became crystallized.\nCertainty descended on him like a bolt from the skies. On oath,\nbefore a notary, the Efficient Baxter would have declared that J.\nPreston Peters was about to try to purloin the scarab.\n\nLest we should seem to be attributing too miraculous powers of\nintuition to Lord Emsworth's secretary, it should be explained\nthat the mystery which hung about that curio had exercised his\nmind not a little since his employer had given it to him to place\nin the museum. He knew Lord Emsworth's power of forgetting and he\ndid not believe his account of the transaction. Scarab maniacs\nlike Mr. Peters did not give away specimens from their\ncollections as presents. But he had not divined the truth of what\nhad happened in London.\n\nThe conclusion at which he had arrived was that Lord Emsworth had\nbought the scarab and had forgotten all about it. To support this\ntheory was the fact that the latter had taken his check book to\nLondon with him. Baxter's long acquaintance with the earl had\nleft him with the conviction that there was no saying what he\nmight not do if left loose in London with a check book.\n\nAs to Mr. Peters' motive for entering the museum, that, too,\nseemed completely clear to the secretary. He was a curio\nenthusiast himself and he had served collectors in a secretarial\ncapacity; and he knew, both from experience and observation, that\nstrange madness which may at any moment afflict the collector,\nblotting out morality and the nice distinction between meum and\ntuum, as with a sponge. He knew that collectors who would not\nsteal a loaf if they were starving might--and did--fall before\nthe temptation of a coveted curio.\n\nHe descended the stairs three at a time, and entered the museum\nat the very instant when Mr. Peters' twitching fingers were about\nto close on his treasure. He handled the delicate situation with\neminent tact. Mr. Peters, at the sound of his step, had executed a\nbackward leap, which was as good as a confession of guilt, and\nhis face was rigid with dismay; but the Efficient Baxter\npretended not to notice these phenomena. His manner, when he\nspoke, was easy and unembarrassed.\n\n\"Ah! Taking a look at our little collection, Mr. Peters? You will\nsee that we have given the place of honor to your Cheops. It is\ncertainly a fine specimen--a wonderfully fine specimen.\"\n\nMr. Peters was recovering slowly. Baxter talked on, to give him\ntime. He spoke of Mut and Bubastis, of Ammon and the Book of the\nDead. He directed the other's attention to the Roman coins.\n\nHe was touching on some aspects of the Princess Gilukhipa of\nMitanni, in whom his hearer could scarcely fail to be interested,\nwhen the door opened and Beach, the butler, came in, accompanied\nby Ashe. In the bustle of the interruption Mr. Peters escaped,\nglad to be elsewhere, and questioning for the first time in his\nlife the dictum that if you want a thing well done you must do it\nyourself.\n\n\"I was not aware, sir,\" said Beach, the butler, \"that you were in\noccupation of the museum. I would not have intruded; but this\nyoung man expressed a desire to examine the exhibits, and I took\nthe liberty of conducting him.\"\n\n\"Come in, Beach--come in,\" said Baxter.\n\nThe light fell on Ashe's face, and he recognized him as the\ncheerful young man who had inquired the way to Mr. Peters' room\nbefore dinner and who, he had by this time discovered, was not\nthe Honorable Freddie's friend, George Emerson--or, indeed, any\nother of the guests of the house. He felt suspicious.\n\n\"Oh, Beach!\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Just a moment.\"\n\nHe drew the butler into the hall, out of earshot.\n\n\"Beach, who is that man?\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters' valet, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters' valet!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Has he been in service long?\" asked Baxter, remembering that a\nmere menial had addressed him as \"old man.\"\n\nBeach lowered his voice. He and the Efficient Baxter were old\nallies, and it seemed right to Beach to confide in him.\n\n\"He has only just joined Mr. Peters, sir; and he has never been\nin service before. He told me so himself, and I was unable to\nelicit from him any information as to his antecedents. His manner\nstruck me, sir, as peculiar. It crossed my mind to wonder whether\nMr. Peters happened to be aware of this. I should dislike to do\nany young man an injury; but it might be anyone coming to a\ngentleman without a character, like this young man. Mr. Peters\nmight have been deceived, sir.\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter's manner became distraught. His mind was\nworking rapidly.\n\n\"Should he be informed, sir?\"\n\n\"Eh! Who?\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters, sir--in case he should have been deceived?\"\n\n\"No, no; Mr. Peters knows his own business.\"\n\n\"Far from me be it to appear officious, sir; but--\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters probably knows all about him. Tell me, Beach, who was\nit suggested this visit to the museum? Did you?\"\n\n\"It was at the young man's express desire that I conducted him,\nsir.\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter returned to the museum without a word.\nAshe, standing in the middle of the room, was impressing the\ntopography of the place on his memory. He was unaware of the\npiercing stare of suspicion that was being directed at him from\nbehind.\n\nHe did not see Baxter. He was not even thinking of Baxter; but\nBaxter was on the alert. Baxter was on the warpath. Baxter knew!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAmong the compensations of advancing age is a wholesome\npessimism, which, though it takes the fine edge off of whatever\ntriumphs may come to us, has the admirable effect of preventing\nFate from working off on us any of those gold bricks, coins with\nstrings attached, and unhatched chickens, at which ardent youth\nsnatches with such enthusiasm, to its subsequent disappointment.\nAs we emerge from the twenties we grow into a habit of mind that\nlooks askance at Fate bearing gifts. We miss, perhaps, the\noccasional prize, but we also avoid leaping light-heartedly into\ntraps.\n\nAshe Marson had yet to reach the age of tranquil mistrust; and\nwhen Fate seemed to be treating him kindly he was still young\nenough to accept such kindnesses on their face value and rejoice\nat them.\n\nAs he sat on his bed at the end of his first night in Castle\nBlandings, he was conscious to a remarkable degree that Fortune\nwas treating him well. He had survived--not merely without\ndiscredit, but with positive triumph--the initiatory plunge into\nthe etiquette maelstrom of life below stairs. So far from doing\nthe wrong thing and drawing down on himself the just scorn of the\nsteward's room, he had been the life and soul of the party. Even\nif to-morrow, in an absent-minded fit, he should anticipate the\ngroom of the chambers in the march to the table, he would be\nforgiven; for the humorist has his privileges.\n\nSo much for that. But that was only a part of Fortune's\nkindnesses. To have discovered on the first day of their\nassociation the correct method of handling and reducing to\nsubjection his irascible employer was an even greater boon. A\nprolonged association with Mr. Peters on the lines in which their\nacquaintance had begun would have been extremely trying. Now, by\nvirtue of a fortunate stand at the outset, he had spiked the\nmillionaire's guns.\n\nThirdly, and most important of all, he had not only made himself\nfamiliar with the locality and surroundings of the scarab, but he\nhad seen, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the removal of it\nand the earning of the five thousand dollars would be the\nsimplest possible task. Already he was spending the money in his\nmind. And to such lengths had optimism led him that, as he sat on\nhis bed reviewing the events of the day, his only doubt was\nwhether to get the scarab at once or to let it remain where it\nwas until he had the opportunity of doing Mr. Peters' interior\ngood on the lines he had mapped out in their conversation; for,\nof course, directly he had restored the scarab to its rightful\nowner and pocketed the reward, his position as healer and trainer\nto the millionaire would cease automatically.\n\nHe was sorry for that, because it troubled him to think that a\nsick man would not be made well; but, on the whole, looking at it\nfrom every aspect, it would be best to get the scarab as soon as\npossible and leave Mr. Peters' digestion to look after itself.\nBeing twenty-six and an optimist, he had no suspicion that Fate\nmight be playing with him; that Fate might have unpleasant\nsurprises in store; that Fate even now was preparing to smite him\nin his hour of joy with that powerful weapon, the Efficient\nBaxter.\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was five minutes to one. He had no\nidea whether they kept early hours at Blandings Castle or not,\nbut he deemed it prudent to give the household another hour in\nwhich to settle down. After which he would just trot down and\ncollect the scarab.\n\nThe novel he had brought down with him from London fortunately\nproved interesting. Two o'clock came before he was ready for it.\nHe slipped the book into his pocket and opened the door.\n\nAll was still--still and uncommonly dark. Along the corridor on\nwhich his room was situated the snores of sleeping domestics\nexploded, growled and twittered in the air. Every menial on the\nlist seemed to be snoring, some in one key, some in another, some\ndefiantly, some plaintively; but the main fact was that they were\nall snoring somehow, thus intimating that, so far as this side of\nthe house was concerned, the coast might be considered clear and\ninterruption of his plans a negligible risk.\n\nResearches made at an earlier hour had familiarized him with the\ngeography of the place. He found his way to the green-baize door\nwithout difficulty and, stepping through, was in the hall, where\nthe remains of the log fire still glowed a fitful red. This,\nhowever, was the only illumination, and it was fortunate that he\ndid not require light to guide him to the museum.\n\nHe knew the direction and had measured the distance. It was\nprecisely seventeen steps from where he stood. Cautiously, and\nwith avoidance of noise, he began to make the seventeen steps.\n\nHe was beginning the eleventh when he bumped into somebody--\nsomebody soft--somebody whose hand, as it touched his, felt small\nand feminine.\n\nThe fragment of a log fell on the ashes and the fire gave a dying\nspurt. Darkness succeeded the sudden glow. The fire was out.\nThat little flame had been its last effort before expiring, but\nit had been enough to enable him to recognize Joan Valentine.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he gasped.\n\nHis astonishment was short-lived. Next moment the only thing that\nsurprised him was the fact that he was not more surprised. There\nwas something about this girl that made the most bizarre\nhappenings seem right and natural. Ever since he had met her his\nlife had changed from an orderly succession of uninteresting days\nto a strange carnival of the unexpected, and use was accustoming\nhim to it. Life had taken on the quality of a dream, in which\nanything might happen and in which everything that did happen was\nto be accepted with the calmness natural in dreams.\n\nIt was strange that she should be here in the pitch-dark hall in\nthe middle of the night; but--after all--no stranger than that he\nshould be. In this dream world in which he now moved it had to be\ntaken for granted that people did all sorts of odd things from\nall sorts of odd motives.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"I think we are both here for the same reason.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say--\"\n\n\"Yes; I have come here to earn the five thousand dollars, too,\nMr. Marson. We are rivals.\"\n\nIn his present frame of mind it seemed so simple and intelligible\nto Ashe that he wondered whether he was really hearing it the\nfirst time. He had an odd feeling that he had known this all\nalong.\n\n\"You are here to get the scarab?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nAshe was dimly conscious of some objection to this, but at first\nit eluded him. Then he pinned it down.\n\n\"But you aren't a young man of good appearance,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean. But Aline Peters is an old friend of\nmine. She told me her father would give a large reward to whoever\nrecovered the scarab; so I--\"\n\n\"Look out!\" whispered Ashe. \"Run! There's somebody coming!\"\n\nThere was a soft footfall on the stairs, a click, and above\nAshe's head a light flashed out. He looked round. He was alone,\nand the green-baize door was swaying gently to and fro.\n\n\"Who's that? Who's there?\" said a voice.\n\nThe Efficient Baxter was coming down the broad staircase.\n\nA general suspicion of mankind and a definite and particular\nsuspicion of one individual made a bad opiate. For over an hour\nsleep had avoided the Efficient Baxter with an unconquerable\ncoyness. He had tried all the known ways of wooing slumber, but\nthey had failed him, from the counting of sheep downward. The\nevents of the night had whipped his mind to a restless activity.\nTry as he might to lose consciousness, the recollection of the\nplot he had discovered surged up and kept him wakeful.\n\nIt is the penalty of the suspicious type of mind that it suffers\nfrom its own activity. From the moment he detected Mr. Peters in\nthe act of rifling the museum and marked down Ashe as an\naccomplice, Baxter's repose was doomed. Nor poppy nor mandragora,\nnor all the drowsy sirups of the world, could ever medicine him\nto that sweet sleep which he owed yesterday.\n\nBut it was the recollection that on previous occasions of\nwakefulness hot whisky and water had done the trick, which had\nnow brought him from his bed and downstairs. His objective was\nthe decanter on the table of the smoking-room, which was one of\nthe rooms opening on the gallery that looked down on the hall.\nHot water he could achieve in his bedroom by means of his stove.\n\nSo out of bed he had climbed and downstairs he had come; and here\nhe was, to all appearances, just in time to foil the very plot on\nwhich he had been brooding. Mr. Peters might be in bed, but there\nin the hall below him stood the accomplice, not ten paces from\nthe museum's door. He arrived on the spot at racing speed and\nconfronted Ashe.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\nAnd then, from the Baxter viewpoint, things began to go wrong. By\nall the rules of the game, Ashe, caught, as it were, red-handed,\nshould have wilted, stammered and confessed all; but Ashe was\nfortified by that philosophic calm which comes to us in dreams,\nand, moreover, he had his story ready.\n\n\"Mr. Peters rang for me, sir.\"\n\nHe had never expected to feel grateful to the little firebrand\nwho employed him, but he had to admit that the millionaire, in\ntheir late conversation, had shown forethought. The thought\nstruck him that but for Mr. Peters' advice he might by now be in\nan extremely awkward position; for his was not a swiftly\ninventive mind.\n\n\"Rang for you? At half-past two in the morning!\"\n\n\"To read to him, sir.\"\n\n\"To read to him at this hour?\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters suffers from insomnia, sir. He has a weak digestion\nand pain sometimes prevents him from sleeping. The lining of his\nstomach is not at all what it should be.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\nWith that meekness which makes the good man wronged so impressive\na spectacle, Ashe produced and exhibited his novel.\n\n\"Here is the book I am about to read to him. I think, sir, if you\nwill excuse me, I had better be going to his room. Good night,\nsir.\"\n\nHe proceeded to mount the stairs. He was sorry for Mr. Peters, so\nshortly about to be roused from a refreshing slumber; but these\nwere life's tragedies and must be borne bravely.\n\nThe Efficient Baxter dogged him the whole way, sprinting silently\nin his wake and dodging into the shadows whenever the light of an\noccasional electric bulb made it inadvisable to keep to the open.\nThen abruptly he gave up the pursuit. For the first time his\ncomparative impotence in this silent conflict on which he had\nembarked was made manifest to him, and he perceived that on mere\nsuspicion, however strong, he could do nothing. To accuse Mr.\nPeters of theft or to accuse him of being accessory to a theft\nwas out of the question.\n\nYet his whole being revolted at the thought of allowing the\nsanctity of the museum to be violated. Officially its contents\nbelonged to Lord Emsworth, but ever since his connection with the\ncastle he had been put in charge of them, and he had come to look\non them as his own property. If he was only a collector by proxy\nhe had, nevertheless, the collector's devotion to his curios,\nbeside which the lioness' attachment to her cubs is tepid; and he\nwas prepared to do anything to retain in his possession a scarab\ntoward which he already entertained the feelings of a life\nproprietor.\n\nNo--not quite anything! He stopped short at the idea of causing\nunpleasantness between the father of the Honorable Freddie and\nthe father of the Honorable Freddie's fiancee. His secretarial\nposition at the castle was a valuable one and he was loath to\njeopardize it.\n\nThere was only one way in which this delicate affair could be\nbrought to a satisfactory conclusion. It was obvious from what he\nhad seen that night that Mr. Peters' connection with the attempt\non the scarab was to be merely sympathetic, and that the actual\ntheft was to be accomplished by Ashe. His only course, therefore,\nwas to catch Ashe actually in the museum. Then Mr. Peters need\nnot appear in the matter at all. Mr. Peters' position in those\ncircumstances would be simply that of a man who had happened to\nemploy, through no fault of his own, a valet who happened to be a\nthief.\n\nHe had made a mistake, he perceived, in locking the door of the\nmuseum. In future he must leave it open, as a trap is open;\nand he must stay up nights and keep watch. With these\nreflections, the Efficient Baxter returned to his room.\n\nMeantime Ashe had entered Mr. Peters' bedroom and switched on the\nlight. Mr. Peters, who had just succeeded in dropping off to\nsleep, sat up with a start.\n\n\"I've come to read to you,\" said Ashe.\n\nMr. Peters emitted a stifled howl, in which wrath and self-pity\nwere nicely blended.\n\n\"You fool, don't you know I have just managed to get to sleep?\"\n\n\"And now you're awake again,\" said Ashe soothingly. \"Such is\nlife! A little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep, and\nthen bing!--off we go again. I hope you will like this novel. I\ndipped into it and it seems good.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by coming in here at this time of night? Are\nyou crazy?\"\n\n\"It was your suggestion; and, by the way, I must thank you for\nit. I apologize for calling it thin. It worked like a charm. I\ndon't think he believed it--in fact, I know he didn't; but it\nheld him. I couldn't have thought up anything half so good in an\nemergency.\"\n\nMr. Peters' wrath changed to excitement.\n\n\"Did you get it? Have you been after my--my Cheops?\"\n\n\"I have been after your Cheops, but I didn't get it. Bad men were\nabroad. That fellow with the spectacles, who was in the museum\nwhen I met you there this evening, swooped down from nowhere, and\nI had to tell him that you had rung for me to read to you.\nFortunately I had this novel on me. I think he followed me\nupstairs to see whether I really did come to your room.\"\n\nMr. Peters groaned miserably.\n\n\"Baxter,\" he said; \"He's a man named Baxter--Lord Emsworth's\nprivate secretary; and he suspects us. He's the man we--I mean\nyou--have got to look out for.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind. Let's be happy while we can. Make yourself\ncomfortable and I'll start reading. After all, what could be\npleasanter than a little literature in the small hours? Shall I\nbegin?\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAshe Marson found Joan Valentine in the stable yard after\nbreakfast the next morning, playing with a retriever puppy. \"Will\nyou spare me a moment of your valuable time?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Marson.\"\n\n\"Shall we walk out into the open somewhere--where we can't be\noverheard?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would be better.\"\n\nThey moved off.\n\n\"Request your canine friend to withdraw,\" said Ashe. \"He prevents\nme from marshaling my thoughts.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he won't withdraw.\"\n\n\"Never mind. I'll do my best in spite of him. Tell me, was I\ndreaming or did I really meet you in the hall this morning at\nabout twenty minutes after two?\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"And did you really tell me that you had come to the castle to\nsteal--\"\n\n\"Recover.\"\n\n\"--Recover Mr. Peters' scarab?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Then it's true?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nAshe scraped the ground with a meditative toe.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"seems to me to complicate matters somewhat.\"\n\n\"It complicates them abominably!\"\n\n\"I suppose you were surprised when you found that I was on the\nsame game as yourself.\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"You weren't!\"\n\n\"I knew it directly I saw the advertisement in the Morning Post.\nAnd I hunted up the Morning Post directly you had told me that\nyou had become Mr. Peters' valet.\"\n\n\"You have known all along!\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\nAshe regarded her admiringly.\n\n\"You're wonderful!\"\n\n\"Because I saw through you?\"\n\n\"Partly that; but chiefly because you had the pluck to undertake\na thing like this.\"\n\n\"You undertook it.\"\n\n\"But I'm a man.\"\n\n\"And I'm a woman. And my theory, Mr. Marson, is that a woman can\ndo nearly everything better than a man. What a splendid test case\nthis would make to settle the Votes-for-Women question once and\nfor all! Here we are--you and I--a man and a woman, each trying\nfor the same thing and each starting with equal chances. Suppose\nI beat you? How about the inferiority of women then?\"\n\n\"I never said women were inferior.\"\n\n\"You did with your eyes.\"\n\n\"Besides, you're an exceptional woman.\"\n\n\"You can't get out of it with a compliment. I'm an ordinary woman\nand I'm going to beat a real man.\"\n\nAshe frowned.\n\n\"I don't like to think of ourselves as working against each\nother.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I like you.\"\n\n\"I like you, Mr. Marson; but we must not let sentiment interfere\nwith business. You want Mr. Peters' five thousand dollars. So do\nI.\"\n\n\"I hate the thought of being the instrument to prevent you from\ngetting the money.\"\n\n\"You won't be. I shall be the instrument to prevent you from\ngetting it. I don't like that thought, either; but one has got to\nface it.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel mean.\"\n\n\"That's simply your old-fashioned masculine attitude toward the\nfemale, Mr. Marson. You look on woman as a weak creature, to be\nshielded and petted. We aren't anything of the sort. We're\nterrors! We're as hard as nails. We're awful creatures. You\nmustn't let my sex interfere with your trying to get this reward.\nThink of me as though I were another man. We're up against each\nother in a fair fight, and I don't want any special privileges.\nIf you don't do your best from now onward I shall never forgive\nyou. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"And we shall need to do our best. That little man with the\nglasses is on his guard. I was listening to you last night from\nbehind the door. By the way, you shouldn't have told me to run\naway and then have stayed yourself to be caught. That is an\nexample of the sort of thing I mean. It was chivalry--not\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"I had a story ready to account for my being there. You had not.\"\n\n\"And what a capital story it was! I shall borrow it for my own\nuse. If I am caught I shall say I had to read Aline to sleep\nbecause she suffers from insomnia. And I shouldn't wonder if she\ndid--poor girl! She doesn't get enough to eat. She is being\nstarved--poor child! I heard one of the footmen say that she\nrefused everything at dinner last night. And, though she vows it\nisn't, my belief is that it's all because she is afraid to make a\nstand against her old father. It's a shame!\"\n\n\"She is a weak creature, to be shielded and petted,\" said Ashe\nsolemnly.\n\nJoan laughed.\n\n\"Well, yes; you caught me there. I admit that poor Aline is not a\nshining example of the formidable modern woman; but--\" She\nstopped. \"Oh, bother! I've just thought of what I ought to have\nsaid--the good repartee that would have crushed you. I suppose\nit's too late now?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I'm like that myself--only it is generally the next\nday when I hit the right answer. Shall we go back? . . . She is a\nweak creature, to be shielded and petted.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" said Joan gratefully. \"And why is she a weak\ncreature? Because she has allowed herself to be shielded and\npetted; because she has permitted man to give her special\nprivileges, and generally--No; it isn't so good as I thought it\nwas going to be.\"\n\n\"It should be crisper,\" said Ashe critically. \"It lacks the\npunch.\"\n\n\"But it brings me back to my point, which is that I am not going\nto imitate her and forfeit my independence of action in return\nfor chivalry. Try to look at it from my point of view, Mr.\nMarson. I know you need the money just as much as I do. Well,\ndon't you think I should feel a little mean if I thought you were\nnot trying your hardest to get it, simply because you didn't\nthink it would be fair to try your hardest against a woman? That\nwould cripple me. I should not feel as though I had the right to\ndo anything. It's too important a matter for you to treat me like\na child and let me win to avoid disappointing me. I want the\nmoney; but I don't want it handed to me.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" said Ashe earnestly, \"it will not be handed to you.\nI have studied the Baxter question more deeply than you have, and\nI can assure you that Baxter is a menace. What has put him so\nfirmly on the right scent I don't know; but he seems to have\ndivined the exact state of affairs in its entirety--so far as I\nam concerned, that is to say. Of course he has no idea you are\nmixed up in the business; but I am afraid his suspicion of me\nwill hit you as well. What I mean is that, for some time to come,\nI fancy that man proposes to camp out on the rug in front of the\nmuseum door. It would be madness for either of us to attempt to\ngo there at present.\"\n\n\"It is being made very hard for us, isn't it? And I thought it\nwas going to be so simple.\"\n\n\"I think we should give him at least a week to simmer down.\"\n\n\"Fully that.\"\n\n\"Let us look on the bright side. We are in no hurry. Blandings\nCastle is quite as comfortable as Number Seven Arundell Street,\nand the commissariat department is a revelation to me. I had no\nidea English servants did themselves so well. And, as for the\nsocial side, I love it; I revel in it. For the first time in my\nlife I feel as though I am somebody. Did you observe my manner\ntoward the kitchen maid who waited on us at dinner last night? A\ntouch of the old noblesse about it, I fancy. Dignified but not\nunkind, I think. And I can keep it up. So far as I am concerned,\nlet this life continue indefinitely.\"\n\n\"But what about Mr. Peters? Don't you think there is danger he\nmay change his mind about that five thousand dollars if we keep\nhim waiting too long?\"\n\n\"Not a chance of it. Being almost within touch of the scarab has\nhad the worst effect on him. It has intensified the craving. By\nthe way, have you seen the scarab?\"\n\n\"Yes; I got Mrs. Twemlow to take me to the museum while you were\ntalking to the butler. It was dreadful to feel that it was lying\nthere in the open waiting for somebody to take it, and not be\nable to do anything.\"\n\n\"I felt exactly the same. It isn't much to look at, is it? If it\nhadn't been for the label I wouldn't have believed it was the\nthing for which Peters was offering five thousand dollars'\nreward. But that's his affair. A thing is worth what somebody\nwill give for it. Ours not to reason why; ours but to elude\nBaxter and gather it in.\"\n\n\"Ours, indeed! You speak as though we were partners instead of\nrivals.\"\n\nAshe uttered an exclamation. \"You've hit it! Why not? Why any\ncutthroat competition? Why shouldn't we form a company? It would\nsolve everything.\"\n\nJoan looked thoughtful.\n\n\"You mean divide the reward?\"\n\n\"Exactly--into two equal parts.\"\n\n\"And the labor?\"\n\n\"The labor?\"\n\n\"How shall we divide that?\"\n\nAshe hesitated.\n\n\"My idea,\" he said, \"was that I should do what I might call the\nrough work; and--\"\n\n\"You mean you should do the actual taking of the scarab?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I would look after that end of it.\"\n\n\"And what would my duties be?\"\n\n\"Well, you--you would, as it were--how shall I put it? You would,\nso to speak, lend moral support.\"\n\n\"By lying snugly in bed, fast asleep?\"\n\nAshe avoided her eye.\n\n\"Well, yes--er--something on those lines.\"\n\n\"While you ran all the risks?\"\n\n\"No, no. The risks are practically nonexistent.\"\n\n\"I thought you said just now that it would be madness for either\nof us to attempt to go to the museum at present.\" Joan laughed.\n\"It won't do, Mr. Marson. You remind me of an old cat I once had.\nWhenever he killed a mouse he would bring it into the\ndrawing-room and lay it affectionately at my feet. I would reject\nthe corpse with horror and turn him out, but back he would come\nwith his loathsome gift. I simply couldn't make him understand\nthat he was not doing me a kindness. He thought highly of his\nmouse and it was beyond him to realize that I did not want it.\n\n\"You are just the same with your chivalry. It's very kind of you\nto keep offering me your dead mouse; but honestly I have no use\nfor it. I won't take favors just because I happen to be a female.\nIf we are going to form this partnership I insist on doing my\nfair share of the work and running my fair share of the\nrisks--the practically nonexistent risks.\"\n\n\"You're very--resolute.\"\n\n\"Say pig-headed; I shan't mind. Certainly I am! A girl has got to\nbe, even nowadays, if she wants to play fair. Listen, Mr.\nMarson; I will not have the dead mouse. I do not like dead mice.\nIf you attempt to work off your dead mouse on me this partnership\nceases before it has begun. If we are to work together we are\ngoing to make alternate attempts to get the scarab. No other\narrangement will satisfy me.\"\n\n\"Then I claim the right to make the first one.\"\n\n\"You don't do anything of the sort. We toss up for first chance,\nlike little ladies and gentlemen. Have you a coin? I will spin,\nand you call.\"\n\nAshe made a last stand.\n\n\"This is perfectly--\"\n\n\"Mr. Marson!\"\n\nAshe gave in. He produced a coin and handed it to her gloomily.\n\n\"Under protest,\" he said.\n\n\"Head or tail?\" said Joan, unmoved.\n\nAshe watched the coin gyrating in the sunshine.\n\n\"Tail!\" he cried.\n\nThe coin stopped rolling.\n\n\"Tail it is,\" said Joan. \"What a nuisance! Well, never mind--\nI'll get my chance if you fail.\"\n\n\"I shan't fail,\" said Ashe fervently. \"If I have to pull the\nmuseum down I won't fail. Thank heaven, there's no chance now of\nyour doing anything foolish!\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure. Well, good luck, Mr. Marson!\"\n\n\"Thank you, partner.\"\n\nThey shook hands.\n\nAs they parted at the door, Joan made one further remark:\n\"There's just one thing, Mr. Marson.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"If I could have accepted the mouse from anyone I should\ncertainly have accepted it from you.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIt is worthy of record, in the light of after events, that at the\nbeginning of their visit it was the general opinion of the guests\ngathered together at Blandings Castle that the place was dull.\nThe house party had that air of torpor which one sees in the\nsaloon passengers of an Atlantic liner--that appearance of\nresignation to an enforced idleness and a monotony to be broken\nonly by meals. Lord Emsworth's guests gave the impression,\ncollectively, of being just about to yawn and look at their\nwatches.\n\nThis was partly the fault of the time of year, for most house\nparties are dull if they happen to fall between the hunting and\nthe shooting seasons, but must be attributed chiefly to Lord\nEmsworth's extremely sketchy notions of the duties of a host.\n\nA host has no right to interne a regiment of his relations in his\nhouse unless he also invites lively and agreeable outsiders to\nmeet them. If he does commit this solecism the least he can do is\nto work himself to the bone in the effort to invent amusements\nand diversions for his victims. Lord Emsworth had failed badly in\nboth these matters. With the exception of Mr. Peters, his\ndaughter Aline and George Emerson, there was nobody in the house\nwho did not belong to the clan; and, as for his exerting himself\nto entertain, the company was lucky if it caught a glimpse of its\nhost at meals.\n\nLord Emsworth belonged to the people-who-like-to-be-left-alone-\nto-amuse-themselves-when-they-come-to-a-place school of hosts. He\npottered about the garden in an old coat--now uprooting a weed,\nnow wrangling with the autocrat from Scotland, who was\ntheoretically in his service as head gardener---dreamily\nsatisfied, when he thought of them at all, that his guests were\nas perfectly happy as he was.\n\nApart from his son Freddie, whom he had long since dismissed as a\nyouth of abnormal tastes, from whom nothing reasonable was to be\nexpected, he could not imagine anyone not being content merely to\nbe at Blandings when the buds were bursting on the trees.\n\nA resolute hostess might have saved the situation; but Lady Ann\nWarblington's abilities in that direction stopped short at\nleaving everything to Mrs. Twemlow and writing letters in her\nbedroom. When Lady Ann Warblington was not writing letters in her\nbedroom--which was seldom, for she had an apparently\ninexhaustible correspondence--she was nursing sick headaches in\nit. She was one of those hostesses whom a guest never sees except\nwhen he goes into the library and espies the tail of her skirt\nvanishing through the other door.\n\nAs for the ordinary recreations of the country house, the guests\ncould frequent the billiard room, where they were sure to find\nLord Stockheath playing a hundred up with his cousin, Algernon\nWooster--a spectacle of the liveliest interest--or they could, if\nfond of golf, console themselves for the absence of links in the\nneighborhood with the exhilarating pastime of clock golf; or they\ncould stroll about the terraces with such of their relations as\nthey happened to be on speaking terms with at the moment, and\nabuse their host and the rest of their relations.\n\nThis was the favorite amusement; and after breakfast, on a\nmorning ten days after Joan and Ashe had formed their compact,\nthe terraces were full of perambulating couples. Here, Colonel\nHorace Mant, walking with the Bishop of Godalming, was soothing\nthat dignitary by clothing in soldierly words thoughts that the\nlatter had not been able to crush down, but which his holy office\nscarcely permitted him to utter.\n\nThere, Lady Mildred Mant, linked to Mrs. Jack Hale, of the\ncollateral branch of the family, was saying things about her\nfather in his capacity of host and entertainer, that were making\nher companion feel like another woman. Farther on, stopping\noccasionally to gesticulate, could be seen other Emsworth\nrelations and connections. It was a typical scene of quiet,\npeaceful English family life.\n\nLeaning on the broad stone balustrade of the upper terrace, Aline\nPeters and George Emerson surveyed the malcontents. Aline gave a\nlittle sigh, almost inaudible; but George's hearing was good.\n\n\"I was wondering when you are going to admit it,\" he said,\nshifting his position so that he faced her.\n\n\"Admit what?\"\n\n\"That you can't stand the prospect; that the idea of being stuck\nfor life with this crowd, like a fly on fly paper, is too much\nfor you; that you are ready to break off your engagement to\nFreddie and come away and marry me and live happily ever after.\"\n\n\"George!\"\n\n\"Well, wasn't that what it meant? Be honest!\"\n\n\"What what meant?\"\n\n\"That sigh.\"\n\n\"I didn't sigh. I was just breathing.\"\n\n\"Then you can breathe in this atmosphere! You surprise me!\" He\nraked the terraces with hostile eyes. \"Look at them! Look at\nthem--crawling round like doped beetles. My dear girl, it's no\nuse your pretending that this sort of thing wouldn't kill you.\nYou're pining away already. You're thinner and paler since you\ncame here. Gee! How we shall look back at this and thank our\nstars that we're out of it when we're back in old New York, with\nthe elevated rattling and the street cars squealing over the\npoints, and something doing every step you take. I shall call you\non the 'phone from the office and have you meet me down town\nsomewhere, and we'll have a bite to eat and go to some show, and\na bit of supper afterward and a dance or two; and then go home to\nour cozy---\"\n\n\"George, you mustn't--really!\"\n\n\"Why mustn't I?\"\n\n\"It's wrong. You can't talk like that when we are both enjoying\nthe hospitality--\"\n\nA wild laugh, almost a howl, disturbed the talk of the most\nadjacent of the perambulating relations. Colonel Horace Mant,\nchecked in mid-sentence, looked up resentfully at the cause of\nthe interruption.\n\n\"I wish somebody would tell me whether it's that American fellow,\nEmerson, or young Freddie who's supposed to be engaged to Miss\nPeters. Hanged if you ever see her and Freddie together, but she\nand Emerson are never to be found apart. If my respected\nfather-in-law had any sense I should have thought he would have\nhad sense enough to stop that.\"\n\n\"You forget, my dear Horace,\" said the bishop charitably; \"Miss\nPeters and Mr. Emerson have known each other since they were\nchildren.\"\n\n\"They were never nearly such children as Emsworth is now,\"\nsnorted the colonel. \"If that girl isn't in love with Emerson\nI'll be--I'll eat my hat.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the bishop. \"No, no! Surely not, Horace. What were\nyou saying when you broke off?\"\n\n\"I was saying that if a man wanted his relations never to speak\nto each other again for the rest of their lives the best thing he\ncould do would be to herd them all together in a dashed barrack\nof a house a hundred miles from anywhere, and then go off and\nspend all his time prodding dashed flower beds with a spud--dash\nit!\"\n\n\"Just so; just so. So you were. Go on, Horace; I find a curious\ncomfort in your words.\"\n\nOn the terrace above them Aline was looking at George with\nstartled eyes.\n\n\"George!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry; but you shouldn't spring these jokes on me so\nsuddenly. You said enjoying! Yes--reveling in it, aren't we!\"\n\n\"It's a lovely old place,\" said Aline defensively.\n\n\"And when you've said that you've said everything. You can't live\non scenery and architecture for the rest of your life. There's\nthe human element to be thought of. And you're beginning--\"\n\n\"There goes father,\" interrupted Aline. \"How fast he is walking!\nGeorge, have you noticed a sort of difference in father these\nlast few days?\"\n\n\"I haven't. My specialty is keeping an eye on the rest of the\nPeters family.\"\n\n\"He seems better somehow. He seems to have almost stopped\nsmoking--and I'm very glad, for those cigars were awfully bad for\nhim. The doctor expressly told him he must stop them, but he\nwouldn't pay any attention to him. And he seems to take so much\nmore exercise. My bedroom is next to his, you know, and every\nmorning I can hear things going on through the wall--father\ndancing about and puffing a good deal. And one morning I met his\nvalet going in with a pair of Indian clubs. I believe father is\nreally taking himself in hand at last.\"\n\nGeorge Emerson exploded.\n\n\"And about time, too! How much longer are you to go on starving\nyourself to death just to give him the resolution to stick to his\ndieting? It maddens me to see you at dinner. And it's killing\nyou. You're getting pale and thin. You can't go on like this.\"\n\nA wistful look came over Aline's face.\n\n\"I do get a little hungry sometimes--late at night generally.\"\n\n\"You want somebody to take care of you and look after you. I'm\nthe man. You may think you can fool me; but I can tell. You're\nweakening on this Freddie proposition. You're beginning to see\nthat it won't do. One of these days you're going to come to me\nand say: 'George, you were right. I take the count. Me for the\nquiet sneak to the station, without anybody knowing, and the\nbreak for London, and the wedding at the registrar's.' Oh, I\nknow! I couldn't have loved you all this time and not know.\nYou're weakening.\"\n\nThe trouble with these supermen is that they lack reticence. They\ndo not know how to omit. They expand their chests and whoop. And\na girl, even the mildest and sweetest of girls--even a girl like\nAline Peters--cannot help resenting the note of triumph. But\nsupermen despise tact. As far as one can gather, that is the\nchief difference between them and the ordinary man.\n\nA little frown appeared on Aline's forehead and she set her mouth\nmutinously.\n\n\"I'm not weakening at all,\" she said, and her voice was--for\nher--quite acid. \"You--you take too much for granted.\"\n\nGeorge was contemplating the landscape with a conqueror's eye.\n\n\"You are beginning to see that it is impossible--this Freddie\nfoolishness.\"\n\n\"It is not foolishness,\" said Aline pettishly, tears of annoyance\nin her eyes. \"And I wish you wouldn't call him Freddie.\"\n\n\"He asked me to. He asked me to!\"\n\nAline stamped her foot.\n\n\"Well, never mind. Please don't do it.\"\n\n\"Very well, little girl,\" said George softly. \"I wouldn't do\nanything to hurt you.\"\n\nThe fact that it never even occurred to George Emerson he was\nbeing offensively patronizing shows the stern stuff of which\nthese supermen are made.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe Efficient Baxter bicycled broodingly to Market Blandings for\ntobacco. He brooded for several reasons. He had just seen Aline\nPeters and George Emerson in confidential talk on the upper\nterrace, and that was one thing which exercised his mind, for he\nsuspected George Emerson. He suspected him nebulously as a snake\nin the grass; as an influence working against the orderly\nprogress of events concerning the marriage that had been arranged\nand would shortly take place between Miss Peters and the\nHonorable Frederick Threepwood.\n\nIt would be too much to say that he had any idea that George was\nputting in such hard and consistent work in his serpentine role;\nindeed if he could have overheard the conversation just recorded\nit is probable that Rupert Baxter would have had heart failure;\nbut he had observed the intimacy between the two as he observed\nmost things in his immediate neighborhood, and he disapproved of\nit. It was all very well to say that George Emerson had known\nAline Peters since she was a child. If that was so, then in the\nopinion of the Efficient Baxter he had known her quite long\nenough and ought to start making the acquaintance of somebody\nelse.\n\nHe blamed the Honorable Freddie. If the Honorable Freddie had\nbeen a more ardent lover he would have spent his time with Aline,\nand George Emerson would have taken his proper place as one of\nthe crowd at the back of the stage. But Freddie's view of the\nmatter seemed to be that he had done all that could be expected\nof a chappie in getting engaged to the girl, and that now he\nmight consider himself at liberty to drop her for a while.\n\nSo Baxter, as he bicycled to Market Blandings for tobacco,\nbrooded on Freddie, Aline Peters and George Emerson. He also\nbrooded on Mr. Peters and Ashe Marson. Finally he brooded in a\ngeneral way, because he had had very little sleep the past week.\n\nThe spectacle of a young man doing his duty and enduring\nconsiderable discomforts while doing it is painful; but there is\nsuch uplift in it, it affords so excellent a moral picture, that\nI cannot omit a short description of the manner in which Rupert\nBaxter had spent the nights which had elapsed since his meeting\nwith Ashe in the small hours in the hall.\n\nIn the gallery which ran above the hall there was a large chair,\nsituated a few paces from the great staircase. On this, in an\novercoat--for the nights were chilly--and rubber-soled shoes, the\nEfficient Baxter had sat, without missing a single night, from\none in the morning until daybreak, waiting, waiting, waiting. It\nhad been an ordeal to try the stoutest determination. Nature had\nnever intended Baxter for a night bird. He loved his bed. He knew\nthat doctors held that insufficient sleep made a man pale and\nsallow, and he had always aimed at the peach-bloom complexion\nwhich comes from a sensible eight hours between the sheets.\n\nOne of the King Georges of England--I forget which--once said\nthat a certain number of hours' sleep each night--I cannot recall\nat the moment how many--made a man something, which for the time\nbeing has slipped my memory. Baxter agreed with him. It went\nagainst all his instincts to sit up in this fashion; but it was\nhis duty and he did it.\n\nIt troubled him that, as night after night went by and Ashe, the\nsuspect, did not walk into the trap so carefully laid for him, he\nfound an increasing difficulty in keeping awake. The first two or\nthree of his series of vigils he had passed in an unimpeachable\nwakefulness, his chin resting on the rail of the gallery and his\nears alert for the slightest sound; but he had not been able to\nmaintain this standard of excellence.\n\nOn several occasions he had caught himself in the act of dropping\noff, and the last night he had actually wakened with a start to\nfind it quite light. As his last recollection before that was of\nan inky darkness impenetrable to the eye, dismay gripped him with\na sudden clutch and he ran swiftly down to the museum. His\nrelief on finding that the scarab was still there had been\ntempered by thoughts of what might have been.\n\nBaxter, then, as he bicycled to Market Blandings for tobacco, had\ngood reason to brood. Having bought his tobacco and observed the\nlife and thought of the town for half an hour--it was market day\nand the normal stagnation of the place was temporarily relieved\nand brightened by pigs that eluded their keepers, and a bull calf\nwhich caught a stout farmer at the psychological moment when he\nwas tying his shoe lace and lifted him six feet--he made his way\nto the Emsworth Arms, the most respectable of the eleven inns the\ncitizens of Market Blandings contrived in some miraculous way to\nsupport.\n\nIn English country towns, if the public houses do not actually\noutnumber the inhabitants, they all do an excellent trade. It is\nonly when they are two to one that hard times hit them and set\nthe innkeepers to blaming the government.\n\nIt was not the busy bar, full to overflowing with honest British\nyeomen--many of them in a similar condition--that Baxter sought.\nHis goal was the genteel dining-room on the first floor, where a\nbald and shuffling waiter, own cousin to a tortoise, served\nluncheon to those desiring it. Lack of sleep had reduced Baxter\nto a condition where the presence and chatter of the house party\nwere insupportable. It was his purpose to lunch at the Emsworth\nArms and take a nap in an armchair afterward.\n\nHe had relied on having the room to himself, for Market Blandings\ndid not lunch to a great extent; but to his annoyance and\ndisappointment the room was already occupied by a man in brown\ntweeds.\n\nOccupied is the correct word, for at first sight this man seemed\nto fill the room. Never since almost forgotten days when he used\nto frequent circuses and side shows, had Baxter seen a fellow\nhuman being so extraordinarily obese. He was a man about fifty\nyears old, gray-haired, of a mauve complexion, and his general\nappearance suggested joviality.\n\nTo Baxter's chagrin, this person engaged him in conversation\ndirectly he took his seat at the table. There was only one table\nin the room, as is customary in English inns, and it had the\ndisadvantage that it collected those seated at it into one party.\nIt was impossible for Baxter to withdraw into himself and ignore\nthis person's advances.\n\nIt is doubtful whether he could have done it, however, had they\nbeen separated by yards of floor, for the fat man was not only\nnaturally talkative but, as appeared from his opening remarks,\nspeech had been dammed up within him for some time by lack of a\nsuitable victim.\n\n\"Morning!\" he began; \"nice day. Good for the farmers. I'll move\nup to your end of the table if I may, sir. Waiter, bring my beef\nto this gentleman's end of the table.\"\n\nHe creaked into a chair at Baxter's side and resumed:\n\n\"Infernally quiet place, this, sir. I haven't found a soul to\nspeak to since I arrived yesterday afternoon except deaf-and-dumb\nrustics. Are you making a long stay here?\"\n\n\"I live outside the town.\"\n\n\"I pity you. Wouldn't care to do it myself. Had to come here on\nbusiness and shan't be sorry when it's finished. I give you my\nword I couldn't sleep a wink last night because of the quiet. I\nwas just dropping off when a beast of a bird outside the window\ngave a chirrup, and it brought me up with a jerk as though\nsomebody had fired a gun. There's a damned cat somewhere near my\nroom that mews. I lie in bed waiting for the next mew, all worked\nup.\n\n\"Heaven save me from the country! It may be all right for you, if\nyou've got a comfortable home and a pal or two to chat with after\ndinner; but you've no conception what it's like in this infernal\ntown--I suppose it calls itself a town. What a hole! There's a\nchurch down the street. I'm told it's Norman or something.\nAnyway, it's old. I'm not much of a man for churches as a rule,\nbut I went and took a look at it.\n\n\"Then somebody told me there was a fine view from the end of High\nStreet; so I went and took a look at that. And now, so far as I\ncan make out, I've done the sights and exhausted every\npossibility of entertainment the town has to provide--unless\nthere's another church. I'm so reduced that I'll go and see the\nMethodist Chapel, if there is one.\"\n\nFresh air, want of sleep and the closeness of the dining-room\ncombined to make Baxter drowsy. He ate his lunch in a torpor,\nhardly replying to his companion's remarks, who, for his part,\ndid not seem to wish or to expect replies. It was enough for him\nto be talking.\n\n\"What do people do with themselves in a place like this? When\nthey want amusement, I mean. I suppose it's different if you've\nbeen brought up to it. Like being born color-blind or something.\nYou don't notice. It's the visitor who suffers. They've no\nenterprise in this sort of place. There's a bit of land just\noutside here that would make a sweet steeplechase course; natural\nbarriers; everything. It hasn't occurred to 'em to do anything\nwith it. It makes you despair of your species--that sort of\nthing. Now if I--\"\n\nBaxter dozed. With his fork still impaling a piece of cold beef,\nhe dropped into that half-awake, half-asleep state which is\nNature's daytime substitute for the true slumber of the night.\nThe fat man, either not noticing or not caring, talked on. His\nvoice was a steady drone, lulling Baxter to rest.\n\nSuddenly there was a break. Baxter sat up, blinking. He had a\ncurious impression that his companion had said \"Hello, Freddie!\"\nand that the door had just opened and closed.\n\n\"Eh?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\" said the fat man.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I was speaking of--\"\n\n\"I thought you said, 'Hello, Freddie!'\"\n\nHis companion eyed him indulgently.\n\n\"I thought you were dropping off when I looked at you. You've\nbeen dreaming. What should I say, 'Hello, Freddie!' for?\"\n\nThe conundrum was unanswerable. Baxter did not attempt to answer\nit. But there remained at the back of his mind a quaint idea that\nhe had caught sight, as he woke, of the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood, his face warningly contorted, vanishing through the\ndoorway. Yet what could the Honorable Freddie be doing at the\nEmsworth Arms?\n\nA solution of the difficulty occurred to him: he had dreamed he\nhad seen Freddie and that had suggested the words which, reason\npointed out, his companion could hardly have spoken. Even if the\nHonorable Freddie should enter the room, this fat man, who was\napparently a drummer of some kind, would certainly not know who\nhe was, nor would he address him so familiarly.\n\nYes, that must be the explanation. After all, the quaintest\nthings happened in dreams. Last night, when he had fallen asleep\nin his chair, he had dreamed that he was sitting in a glass case\nin the museum, making faces at Lord Emsworth, Mr. Peters, and\nBeach, the butler, who were trying to steal him, under the\nimpression that he was a scarab of the reign of Cheops of the\nFourth Dynasty--a thing he would never have done when awake. Yes;\nhe must certainly have been dreaming.\n\nIn the bedroom into which he had dashed to hide himself, on\ndiscovering that the dining-room was in possession of the\nEfficient Baxter, the Honorable Freddie sat on a rickety chair,\nscowling. He elaborated a favorite dictum of his:\n\n\"You can't take a step anywhere without stumbling over that damn\nfeller, Baxter!\"\n\nHe wondered whether Baxter had seen him. He wondered whether\nBaxter had recognized him. He wondered whether Baxter had heard\nR. Jones say, \"Hello, Freddie!\"\n\nHe wondered, if such should be the case, whether R. Jones'\npresence of mind and native resource had been equal to explaining\naway the remark.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"'Put the butter or drippings in a kettle on the range, and when\nhot add the onions and fry them; add the veal and cook until\nbrown. Add the water, cover closely, and cook very slowly until\nthe meat is tender; then add the seasoning and place the potatoes\non top of the meat. Cover and cook until the potatoes are tender,\nbut not falling to pieces.'\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Mr. Peters--\"not falling to pieces. That's right.\nGo on.\"\n\n\"'Then add the cream and cook five minutes longer'\" read Ashe.\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"That's all of that one.\"\n\nMr. Peters settled himself more comfortably in bed.\n\n\"Read me the piece where it tells about curried lobster.\"\n\nAshe cleared his throat.\n\n\"'Curried Lobster,'\" he read. \"'Materials: Two one-pound\nlobsters, two teaspoonfuls lemon juice, half a spoonful curry\npowder, two tablespoonfuls butter, a tablespoonful flour, one\ncupful scalded milk, one cupful cracker crumbs, half teaspoonful\nsalt, quarter teaspoonful pepper.'\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"'Way of Preparing: Cream the butter and flour and add the\nscalded milk; then add the lemon juice, curry powder, salt and\npepper. Remove the lobster meat from the shells and cut into\nhalf-inch cubes.'\"\n\n\"Half-inch cubes,\" sighed Mr. Peters wistfully. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"'Add the latter to the sauce.'\"\n\n\"You didn't say anything about the latter. Oh, I see; it means\nthe half-inch cubes. Yes?\"\n\n\"'Refill the lobster shells, cover with buttered crumbs, and bake\nuntil the crumbs are brown. This will serve six persons.'\"\n\n\"And make them feel an hour afterward as though they had\nswallowed a live wild cat,\" said Mr. Peters ruefully.\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Ashe. \"I could eat two portions of that\nat this very minute and go off to bed and sleep like a little\nchild.\"\n\nMr. Peters raised himself on his elbow and stared at him. They\nwere in the millionaire's bedroom, the time being one in the\nmorning, and Mr. Peters had expressed a wish that Ashe should\nread him to sleep. He had voted against Ashe's novel and produced\nfrom the recesses of his suitcase a much-thumbed cookbook. He\nexplained that since his digestive misfortunes had come on him he\nhad derived a certain solace from its perusal.\n\nIt may be that to some men sorrow's crown of sorrow is\nremembering happier things; but Mr. Peters had not found that to\nbe the case. In his hour of affliction it soothed him to read of\nHungarian Goulash and escaloped brains, and to remember that he,\ntoo, the nut-and-grass eater of today, had once dwelt in Arcadia.\n\nThe passage of the days, which had so sapped the stamina of the\nefficient Baxter, had had the opposite effect on Mr. Peters. His\nwas one of those natures that cannot deal in half measures.\nWhatever he did, he did with the same driving energy. After the\nfirst passionate burst of resistance he had settled down into a\nmodel pupil in Ashe's one-man school of physical culture. It had\nbeen the same, now that he came to look back on it, at Muldoon's.\n\nNow that he remembered, he had come away from White Plains\nhoping, indeed, never to see the place again, but undeniably a\ndifferent man physically. It was not the habit of Professor\nMuldoon to let his patients loaf; but Mr. Peters, after the\ninitial plunge, had needed no driving. He had worked hard at his\ncure then, because it was the job in hand. He worked hard now,\nunder the guidance of Ashe, because, once he had begun, the thing\ninterested and gripped him.\n\nAshe, who had expected continued reluctance, had been astonished\nand delighted at the way in which the millionaire had behaved.\nNature had really intended Ashe for a trainer; he identified\nhimself so thoroughly with his man and rejoiced at the least\nsigns of improvement.\n\nIn Mr. Peters' case there had been distinct improvement already.\nMiracles do not happen nowadays, and it was too much to expect\none who had maltreated his body so consistently for so many years\nto become whole in a day; but to an optimist like Ashe signs were\nnot wanting that in due season Mr. Peters would rise on\nstepping-stones of his dead self to higher things, and though\nnever soaring into the class that devours lobster a la Newburg\nand smiles after it, might yet prove himself a devil of a fellow\namong the mutton chops.\n\n\"You're a wonder!\" said Mr. Peters. \"You're fresh, and you have\nno respect for your elders and betters; but you deliver the\ngoods. That's the point. Why, I'm beginning to feel great! Say,\ndo you know I felt a new muscle in the small of my back this\nmorning? They are coming out on me like a rash.\"\n\n\"That's the Larsen Exercises. They develop the whole body.\"\n\n\"Well, you're a pretty good advertisement for them if they need\none. What were you before you came to me--a prize-fighter?\"\n\n\"That's the question everybody I have met since I arrived here\nhas asked me. I believe it made the butler think I was some sort\nof crook when I couldn't answer it. I used to write stories--\ndetective stories.\"\n\n\"What you ought to be doing is running a place over here in\nEngland like Muldoon has back home. But you will be able to write\none more story out of this business here, if you want to. When\nare you going to have another try for my scarab?\"\n\n\"To-night.\"\n\n\"To-night? How about Baxter?\"\n\n\"I shall have to risk Baxter.\"\n\nMr. Peters hesitated. He had fallen out of the habit of being\nmagnanimous during the past few years, for dyspepsia brooks no\ndivided allegiance and magnanimity has to take a back seat when\nit has its grip on you.\n\n\"See here,\" he said awkwardly; \"I've been thinking this over\nlately--and what's the use? It's a queer thing; and if anybody\nhad told me a week ago that I should be saying it I wouldn't have\nbelieved him; but I am beginning to like you. I don't want to get\nyou into trouble. Let the old scarab go. What's a scarab anyway?\nForget about it and stick on here as my private Muldoon. If it's\nthe five thousand that's worrying you, forget that too. I'll give\nit to you as your fee.\"\n\nAshe was astounded. That it could really be his peppery employer\nwho spoke was almost unbelievable. Ashe's was a friendly nature\nand he could never be long associated with anyone without trying\nto establish pleasant relations; but he had resigned himself in\nthe present case to perpetual warfare.\n\nHe was touched; and if he had ever contemplated abandoning his\nventure, this, he felt, would have spurred him on to see it\nthrough. This sudden revelation of the human in Mr. Peters was\nlike a trumpet call.\n\n\"I wouldn't think of it,\" he said. \"It's great of you to suggest\nsuch a thing; but I know just how you feel about the thing, and\nI'm going to get it for you if I have to wring Baxter's neck.\nProbably Baxter will have given up waiting as a bad job by now if\nhe has been watching all this while. We've given him ten nights\nto cool off. I expect he is in bed, dreaming pleasant dreams.\nIt's nearly two o'clock. I'll wait another ten minutes and then\ngo down.\" He picked up the cookbook. \"Lie back and make yourself\ncomfortable, and I'll read you to sleep first.\"\n\n\"You're a good boy,\" said Mr. Peters drowsily.\n\n\"Are you ready? 'Pork Tenderloin Larded. Half pound fat pork--'\"\nA faint smile curved Mr. Peters' lips. His eyes were closed and\nhe breathed softly. Ashe went on in a low voice: \"'four large\npork tenderloins, one cupful cracker crumbs, one cupful boiling\nwater, two tablespoonfuls butter, one teaspoonful salt, half\nteaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful poultry seasoning.'\"\n\nA little sigh came from the bed.\n\n\"'Way of Preparing: Wipe the tenderloins with a damp cloth. With\na sharp knife make a deep pocket lengthwise in each tenderloin.\nCut your pork into long thin strips and, with a needle, lard each\ntenderloin. Melt the butter in the water, add the seasoning and\nthe cracker crumbs, combining all thoroughly. Now fill each\npocket in the tenderloin with this stuffing. Place the\ntenderloins--'\"\n\nA snore sounded from the pillows, punctuating the recital like a\nmark of exclamation. Ashe laid down the book and peered into the\ndarkness beyond the rays of the bed lamp. His employer slept.\n\nAshe switched off the light and crept to the door. Out in the\npassage he stopped and listened. All was still. He stole\ndownstairs.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nGeorge Emerson sat in his bedroom in the bachelors' wing of the\ncastle smoking a cigarette. A light of resolution was in his\neyes. He glanced at the table beside his bed and at what was on\nthat table, and the light of resolution flamed into a glare of\nfanatic determination. So might a medieval knight have looked on\nthe eve of setting forth to rescue a maiden from a dragon.\n\nHis cigarette burned down. He looked at his watch, put it back,\nand lit another cigarette. His aspect was the aspect of one\nwaiting for the appointed hour. Smoking his second cigarette, he\nresumed his meditations. They had to do with Aline Peters.\n\nGeorge Emerson was troubled about Aline Peters. Watching over\nher, as he did, with a lover's eye, he had perceived that about\nher which distressed him. On the terrace that morning she had\nbeen abrupt to him--what in a girl of less angelic disposition\none might have called snappy. Yes, to be just, she had snapped at\nhim. That meant something. It meant that Aline was not well. It\nmeant what her pallor and tired eyes meant--that the life she was\nleading was doing her no good.\n\nEleven nights had George dined at Blandings Castle, and on each\nof the eleven nights he had been distressed to see the manner in\nwhich Aline, declining the baked meats, had restricted herself to\nthe miserable vegetable messes which were all that doctor's\norders permitted to her suffering father. George's pity had its\nlimits. His heart did not bleed for Mr. Peters. Mr. Peters' diet\nwas his own affair. But that Aline should starve herself in this\nfashion, purely by way of moral support for her parent, was\nanother matter.\n\nGeorge was perhaps a shade material. Himself a robust young man\nand taking what might be called an outsize in meals, he attached\nperhaps too much importance to food as an adjunct to the perfect\nlife. In his survey of Aline he took a line through his own\nrequirements; and believing that eleven such dinners as he had\nseen Aline partake of would have killed him he decided that his\nloved one was on the point of starvation.\n\nNo human being, he held, could exist on such Barmecide feasts.\nThat Mr. Peters continued to do so did not occur to him as a flaw\nin his reasoning. He looked on Mr. Peters as a sort of machine.\nSuccessful business men often give that impression to the young.\nIf George had been told that Mr. Peters went along on gasoline,\nlike an automobile, he would not have been much surprised. But\nthat Aline--his Aline--should have to deny herself the exercise\nof that mastication of rich meats which, together with the gift\nof speech, raises man above the beasts of the field---- That was\nwhat tortured George.\n\nHe had devoted the day to thinking out a solution of the problem.\nSuch was the overflowing goodness of Aline's heart that not even\nhe could persuade her to withdraw her moral support from her\nfather and devote herself to keeping up her strength as she\nshould do. It was necessary to think of some other plan.\n\nAnd then a speech of hers had come back to him. She had\nsaid--poor child:\n\n\"I do get a little hungry sometimes--late at night generally.\"\n\nThe problem was solved. Food should be brought to her late at\nnight.\n\nOn the table by his bed was a stout sheet of packing paper. On\nthis lay, like one of those pictures in still life that one sees\non suburban parlor walls, a tongue, some bread, a knife, a fork,\nsalt, a corkscrew and a small bottle of white wine.\n\nIt is a pleasure, when one has been able hitherto to portray\nGeorge's devotion only through the medium of his speeches, to\nproduce these comestibles as Exhibit A, to show that he loved\nAline with no common love; for it had not been an easy task to\nget them there. In a house of smaller dimensions he would have\nraided the larder without shame, but at Blandings Castle there\nwas no saying where the larder might be. All he knew was that it\nlay somewhere beyond that green-baize door opening on the hall,\npast which he was wont to go on his way to bed. To prowl through\nthe maze of the servants' quarters in search of it was\nimpossible. The only thing to be done was to go to Market\nBlandings and buy the things.\n\nFortune had helped him at the start by arranging that the\nHonorable Freddie, also, should be going to Market Blandings in\nthe little runabout, which seated two. He had acquiesced in\nGeorge's suggestion that he, George, should occupy the other\nseat, but with a certain lack of enthusiasm it seemed to George.\nHe had not volunteered any reason as to why he was going to\nMarket Blandings in the little runabout, and on arrival there had\nbetrayed an unmistakable desire to get rid of George at the\nearliest opportunity.\n\nAs this had suited George to perfection, he being desirous of\ngetting rid of the Honorable Freddie at the earliest opportunity,\nhe had not been inquisitive, and they had parted on the outskirts\nof the town without mutual confidences.\n\nGeorge had then proceeded to the grocer's, and after that to\nanother of the Market Blandings inns, not the Emsworth Arms,\nwhere he had bought the white wine. He did not believe in the\nlocal white wine, for he was a young man with a palate and\nmistrusted country cellars, but he assumed that, whatever its\nquality, it would cheer Aline in the small hours.\n\nHe had then tramped the whole five miles back to the castle with\nhis purchases. It was here that his real troubles began and the\nquality of his love was tested. The walk, to a heavily laden man,\nwas bad enough; but it was as nothing compared with the ordeal of\nsmuggling the cargo up to his bedroom. Superhuman though he was,\nGeorge was alive to the delicacy of the situation. One cannot\nconvey food and drink to one's room in a strange house without,\nif detected, seeming to cast a slur on the table of the host. It\nwas as one who carries dispatches through an enemy's lines that\nGeorge took cover, emerged from cover, dodged, ducked and ran;\nand the moment when he sank down on his bed, the door locked\nbehind him, was one of the happiest of his life.\n\nThe recollection of that ordeal made the one he proposed to\nembark on now seem slight in comparison. All he had to do was to\ngo to Aline's room on the other side of the house, knock softly\non the door until signs of wakefulness made themselves heard from\nwithin, and then dart away into the shadows whence he had come,\nand so back to bed. He gave Aline credit for the intelligence\nthat would enable her, on finding a tongue, some bread, a knife,\na fork, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine on the mat,\nto know what to do with them--and perhaps to guess whose was the\nloving hand that had laid them there.\n\nThe second clause, however, was not important, for he proposed to\ntell her whose was the hand next morning. Other people might hide\ntheir light under a bushel--not George Emerson.\n\nIt only remained now to allow time to pass until the hour should\nbe sufficiently advanced to insure safety for the expedition. He\nlooked at his watch again. It was nearly two. By this time the\nhouse must be asleep.\n\nHe gathered up the tongue, the bread, the knife, the fork, the\nsalt, the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine, and left the\nroom. All was still. He stole downstairs.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nOn his chair in the gallery that ran round the hall, swathed in\nan overcoat and wearing rubber-soled shoes, the Efficient Baxter\nsat and gazed into the darkness. He had lost the first fine\ncareless rapture, as it were, which had helped him to endure\nthese vigils, and a great weariness was on him. He found\ndifficulty in keeping his eyes open, and when they were open the\ndarkness seemed to press on them painfully. Take him for all in\nall, the Efficient Baxter had had about enough of it.\n\nTime stood still. Baxter's thoughts began to wander. He knew that\nthis was fatal and exerted himself to drag them back. He tried to\nconcentrate his mind on some one definite thing. He selected the\nscarab as a suitable object, but it played him false. He had\nhardly concentrated on the scarab before his mind was straying\noff to ancient Egypt, to Mr. Peters' dyspepsia, and on a dozen\nother branch lines of thought.\n\nHe blamed the fat man at the inn for this. If the fat man had not\nthrust his presence and conversation on him he would have been\nable to enjoy a sound sleep in the afternoon, and would have come\nfresh to his nocturnal task. He began to muse on the fat man.\nAnd by a curious coincidence whom should he meet a few moments\nlater but this same man!\n\nIt happened in a somewhat singular manner, though it all seemed\nperfectly logical and consecutive to Baxter. He was climbing up\nthe outer wall of Westminster Abbey in his pyjamas and a tall\nhat, when the fat man, suddenly thrusting his head out of a\nwindow which Baxter had not noticed until that moment, said,\n\"Hello, Freddie!\"\n\nBaxter was about to explain that his name was not Freddie when he\nfound himself walking down Piccadilly with Ashe Marson. Ashe said\nto him: \"Nobody loves me. Everybody steals my grapefruit!\" And\nthe pathos of it cut the Efficient Baxter like a knife. He was on\nthe point of replying; when Ashe vanished and Baxter discovered\nthat he was not in Piccadilly, as he had supposed, but in an\naeroplane with Mr. Peters, hovering over the castle.\n\nMr. Peters had a bomb in his hand, which he was fondling with\nloving care. He explained to Baxter that he had stolen it from\nthe Earl of Emsworth's museum. \"I did it with a slice of cold\nbeef and a pickle,\" he explained; and Baxter found himself\nrealizing that that was the only way. \"Now watch me drop it,\"\nsaid Mr. Peters, closing one eye and taking aim at the castle.\n\"I have to do this by the doctor's orders.\"\n\nHe loosed the bomb and immediately Baxter was lying in bed\nwatching it drop. He was frightened, but the idea of moving did\nnot occur to him. The bomb fell very slowly, dipping and\nfluttering like a feather. It came closer and closer. Then it\nstruck with a roar and a sheet of flame.\n\nBaxter woke to a sound of tumult and crashing. For a moment he\nhovered between dreaming and waking, and then sleep passed from\nhim, and he was aware that something noisy and exciting was in\nprogress in the hall below.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nComing down to first causes, the only reason why collisions of\nany kind occur is because two bodies defy Nature's law that a\ngiven spot on a given plane shall at a given moment of time be\noccupied by only one body.\n\nThere was a certain spot near the foot of the great staircase\nwhich Ashe, coming downstairs from Mr. Peters' room, and George\nEmerson, coming up to Aline's room, had to pass on their\nrespective routes. George reached it at one minute and three\nseconds after two a.m., moving silently but swiftly; and Ashe,\nalso maintaining a good rate of speed, arrived there at one\nminute and four seconds after the hour, when he ceased to walk\nand began to fly, accompanied by George Emerson, now going down.\nHis arms were round George's neck and George was clinging to his\nwaist.\n\nIn due season they reached the foot of the stairs and a small\ntable, covered with occasional china and photographs in frames,\nwhich lay adjacent to the foot of the stairs. That--especially\nthe occasional china--was what Baxter had heard.\n\nGeorge Emerson thought it was a burglar. Ashe did not know what\nit was, but he knew he wanted to shake it off; so he insinuated a\nhand beneath George's chin and pushed upward. George, by this\ntime parted forever from the tongue, the bread, the knife, the\nfork, the salt, the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine, and\nhaving both hands free for the work of the moment, held Ashe with\nthe left and punched him in the ribs with the right.\n\nAshe, removing his left arm from George's neck, brought it up as\na reinforcement to his right, and used both as a means of\nthrottling George. This led George, now permanently underneath,\nto grasp Ashe's ears firmly and twist them, relieving the\npressure on his throat and causing Ashe to utter the first vocal\nsound of the evening, other than the explosive Ugh! that both had\nemitted at the instant of impact.\n\nAshe dislodged George's hands from his ears and hit George in the\nribs with his elbow. George kicked Ashe on the left ankle. Ashe\nrediscovered George's throat and began to squeeze it afresh; and\na pleasant time was being had by all when the Efficient Baxter,\nwhizzing down the stairs, tripped over Ashe's legs, shot forward\nand cannoned into another table, also covered with occasional\nchina and photographs in frames.\n\nThe hall at Blandings Castle was more an extra drawing-room than\na hall; and, when not nursing a sick headache in her bedroom,\nLady Ann Warblington would dispense afternoon tea there to her\nguests. Consequently it was dotted pretty freely with small\ntables. There were, indeed, no fewer than five more in various\nspots, waiting to be bumped into and smashed.\n\nThe bumping into and smashing of small tables, however, is a task\nthat calls for plenty of time, a leisured pursuit; and neither\nGeorge nor Ashe, a third party having been added to their little\naffair, felt a desire to stay on and do the thing properly. Ashe\nwas strongly opposed to being discovered and called on to account\nfor his presence there at that hour; and George, conscious of the\ntongue and its adjuncts now strewn about the hall, had a similar\nprejudice against the tedious explanations that detection must\ninvolve.\n\nAs though by mutual consent each relaxed his grip. They stood\npanting for an instant; then, Ashe in the direction where he\nsupposed the green-baize door of the servants' quarters to be,\nGeorge to the staircase that led to his bedroom, they went away\nfrom that place.\n\nThey had hardly done so when Baxter, having disassociated himself\nfrom the contents of the table he had upset, began to grope his\nway toward the electric-light switch, the same being situated\nnear the foot of the main staircase. He went on all fours, as a\nsafer method of locomotion, though slower, than the one he had\nattempted before.\n\nNoises began to make themselves heard on the floors above. Roused\nby the merry crackle of occasional china, the house party was\nbestirring itself to investigate. Voices sounded, muffled and\ninquiring.\n\nMeantime Baxter crawled steadily on his hands and knees toward\nthe light switch. He was in much the same condition as one White\nHope of the ring is after he has put his chin in the way of the\nfist of a rival member of the Truck Drivers' Union. He knew that\nhe was still alive. More he could not say. The mists of sleep,\nwhich still shrouded his brain, and the shake-up he had had from\nhis encounter with the table, a corner of which he had rammed\nwith the top of his head, combined to produce a dreamlike state.\n\nAnd so the Efficient Baxter crawled on; and as he crawled his\nhand, advancing cautiously, fell on something--something that was\nnot alive; something clammy and ice-cold, the touch of which\nfilled him with a nameless horror.\n\nTo say that Baxter's heart stood still would be physiologically\ninexact. The heart does not stand still. Whatever the emotions of\nits owner, it goes on beating. It would be more accurate to say\nthat Baxter felt like a man taking his first ride in an express\nelevator, who has outstripped his vital organs by several floors\nand sees no immediate prospect of their ever catching up with him\nagain. There was a great cold void where the more intimate parts\nof his body should have been. His throat was dry and contracted.\nThe flesh of his back crawled, for he knew what it was he had\ntouched.\n\nPainful and absorbing as had been his encounter with the table,\nBaxter had never lost sight of the fact that close beside him a\nfurious battle between unseen forces was in progress. He had\nheard the bumping and the thumping and the tense breathing even\nas he picked occasional china from his person. Such a combat, he\nhad felt, could hardly fail to result in personal injury to\neither the party of the first part or the party of the second\npart, or both. He knew now that worse than mere injury had\nhappened, and that he knelt in the presence of death.\n\nThere was no doubt that the man was dead. Insensibility alone\ncould never have produced this icy chill. He raised his head in\nthe darkness, and cried aloud to those approaching. He meant to\ncry: \"Help! Murder!\" But fear prevented clear articulation. What\nhe shouted was: \"Heh! Mer!\" On which, from the neighborhood of\nthe staircase, somebody began to fire a revolver.\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth had been sleeping a sound and peaceful sleep\nwhen the imbroglio began downstairs. He sat up and listened. Yes;\nundoubtedly burglars! He switched on his light and jumped out of\nbed. He took a pistol from a drawer, and thus armed went to look\ninto the matter. The dreamy peer was no poltroon.\n\nIt was quite dark when he arrived on the scene of conflict, in\nthe van of a mixed bevy of pyjamaed and dressing-gowned\nrelations. He was in the van because, meeting these relations in\nthe passage above, he had said to them: \"Let me go first. I have\na pistol.\" And they had let him go first. They were, indeed,\nawfully nice about it, not thrusting themselves forward or\njostling or anything, but behaving in a modest and self-effacing\nmanner that was pretty to watch.\n\nWhen Lord Emsworth said, \"Let me go first,\" young Algernon\nWooster, who was on the very point of leaping to the fore, said,\n\"Yes, by Jove! Sound scheme, by Gad!\"--and withdrew into the\nbackground; and the Bishop of Godalming said: \"By all means,\nClarence undoubtedly; most certainly precede us.\"\n\nWhen his sense of touch told him he had reached the foot of the\nstairs, Lord Emsworth paused. The hall was very dark and the\nburglars seemed temporarily to have suspended activities. And\nthen one of them, a man with a ruffianly, grating voice, spoke.\nWhat it was he said Lord Emsworth could not understand. It\nsounded like \"Heh! Mer!\"--probably some secret signal to his\nconfederates. Lord Emsworth raised his revolver and emptied it in\nthe direction of the sound.\n\nExtremely fortunately for him, the Efficient Baxter had not\nchanged his all-fours attitude. This undoubtedly saved Lord\nEmsworth the worry of engaging a new secretary. The shots sang\nabove Baxter's head one after the other, six in all, and found\nother billets than his person. They disposed themselves as\nfollows: The first shot broke a window and whistled out into the\nnight; the second shot hit the dinner gong and made a perfectly\nextraordinary noise, like the Last Trump; the third, fourth and\nfifth shots embedded themselves in the wall; the sixth and final\nshot hit a life-size picture of his lordship's grandmother in the\nface and improved it out of all knowledge.\n\nOne thinks no worse of Lord Emsworth's grandmother because she\nlooked like Eddie Foy, and had allowed herself to be painted,\nafter the heavy classic manner of some of the portraits of a\nhundred years ago, in the character of Venus--suitably draped, of\ncourse, rising from the sea; but it was beyond the possibility of\ndenial that her grandson's bullet permanently removed one of\nBlandings Castle's most prominent eyesores.\n\nHaving emptied his revolver, Lord Emsworth said, \"Who is there?\nSpeak!\" in rather an aggrieved tone, as though he felt he had\ndone his part in breaking the ice, and it was now for the\nintruder to exert himself and bear his share of the social\namenities.\n\nThe Efficient Baxter did not reply. Nothing in the world could\nhave induced him to speak at that moment, or to make any sound\nwhatsoever that might betray his position to a dangerous maniac\nwho might at any instant reload his pistol and resume the\nfusillade. Explanations, in his opinion, could be deferred until\nsomebody had the presence of mind to switch on the lights. He\nflattened himself on the carpet and hoped for better things. His\ncheek touched the corpse beside him; but though he winced and\nshuddered he made no outcry. After those six shots he was through\nwith outcries.\n\nA voice from above, the bishop's voice, said: \"I think you have\nkilled him, Clarence.\"\n\nAnother voice, that of Colonel Horace Mant, said: \"Switch on\nthose dashed lights! Why doesn't somebody? Dash it!\"\n\nThe whole strength of the company began to demand light.\n\nWhen the lights came, it was from the other side of the hall.\nSix revolver shots, fired at quarter past two in the morning,\nwill rouse even sleeping domestics. The servants' quarters were\nbuzzing like a hive. Shrill feminine screams were puncturing the\nair. Mr. Beach, the butler, in a suit of pink silk pajamas, of\nwhich no one would have suspected him, was leading a party of men\nservants down the stairs--not so much because he wanted to lead\nthem as because they pushed him.\n\nThe passage beyond the green-baize door became congested, and\nthere were cries for Mr. Beach to open it and look through and\nsee what was the matter; but Mr. Beach was smarter than that and\nwriggled back so that he no longer headed the procession. This\ndone, he shouted:\n\n\"Open that door there! Open that door! Look and see what the\nmatter is.\"\n\nAshe opened the door. Since his escape from the hall he had been\nlurking in the neighborhood of the green-baize door and had been\nengulfed by the swirling throng. Finding himself with elbowroom\nfor the first time, he pushed through, swung the door open and\nswitched on the lights.\n\nThey shone on a collection of semi-dressed figures, crowding the\nstaircase; on a hall littered with china and glass; on a dented\ndinner gong; on an edited and improved portrait of the late\nCountess of Emsworth; and on the Efficient Baxter, in an overcoat\nand rubber-soled shoes, lying beside a cold tongue. At no great\ndistance lay a number of other objects--a knife, a fork, some\nbread, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine.\n\nUsing the word in the sense of saying something coherent, the\nEarl of Emsworth was the first to speak. He peered down at his\nrecumbent secretary and said:\n\n\"Baxter! My dear fellow--what the devil?\"\n\nThe feeling of the company was one of profound disappointment.\nThey were disgusted at the anticlimax. For an instant, when the\nEfficient one did not move, a hope began to stir; but as soon as\nit was seen that he was not even injured, gloom reigned. One of\ntwo things would have satisfied them--either a burglar or a\ncorpse. A burglar would have been welcome, dead or alive; but, if\nBaxter proposed to fill the part adequately it was imperative\nthat he be dead. He had disappointed them deeply by turning out\nto be the object of their quest. That he should not have been\neven grazed was too much.\n\nThere was a cold silence as he slowly raised himself from the\nfloor. As his eyes fell on the tongue, he started and remained\ngazing fixedly at it. Surprise paralyzed him.\n\nLord Emsworth was also looking at the tongue and he leaped to a\nnot unreasonable conclusion. He spoke coldly and haughtily; for\nhe was not only annoyed, like the others, at the anticlimax, but\noffended. He knew that he was not one of your energetic hosts who\nexert themselves unceasingly to supply their guests with\nentertainment; but there was one thing on which, as a host, he\ndid pride himself--in the material matters of life he did his\nguests well; he kept an admirable table.\n\n\"My dear Baxter,\" he said in the tones he usually reserved for\nthe correction of his son Freddie, \"if your hunger is so great\nthat you are unable to wait for breakfast and have to raid my\nlarder in the middle of the night, I wish to goodness you would\ncontrive to make less noise about it. I do not grudge you the\nfood--help yourself when you please--but do remember that people\nwho have not such keen appetites as yourself like to sleep during\nthe night. A far better plan, my dear fellow, would be to have\nsandwiches or buns--or whatever you consider most sustaining--\nsent up to your bedroom.\"\n\nNot even the bullets had disordered Baxter's faculties so much as\nthis monstrous accusation. Explanations pushed and jostled one\nanother in his fermenting brain, but he could not utter them. On\nevery side he met gravely reproachful eyes. George Emerson was\nlooking at him in pained disgust. Ashe Marson's face was the face\nof one who could never have believed this had he not seen it with\nhis own eyes. The scrutiny of the knife-and-shoe boy was\nunendurable.\n\nHe stammered. Words began to proceed from him, tripping and\nstumbling over each other. Lord Emsworth's frigid disapproval did\nnot relax.\n\n\"Pray do not apologize, Baxter. The desire for food is human. It\nis your boisterous mode of securing and conveying it that I\ndeprecate. Let us all go to bed.\"\n\n\"But, Lord Emsworth-----\"\n\n\"To bed!\" repeated his lordship firmly.\n\nThe company began to stream moodily upstairs. The lights were\nswitched off. The Efficient Baxter dragged himself away. From the\ndarkness in the direction of the servants' door a voice spoke.\n\n\"Greedy pig!\" said the voice scornfully.\n\nIt sounded like the fresh young voice of the knife-and-shoe boy,\nbut Baxter was too broken to investigate. He continued his\nretreat without pausing.\n\n\"Stuffin' of 'isself at all hours!\" said the voice.\n\nThere was a murmur of approval from the unseen throng of\ndomestics.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAs we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of\nhuman happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding\npleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people. One must\nassume that the Efficient Baxter had not reached the age when\nthis comes home to a man, for the fact that he had given genuine\npleasure to some dozens of his fellow-men brought him no balm.\n\nThere was no doubt about the pleasure he had given. Once they had\ngot over their disappointment at finding that he was not a dead\nburglar, the house party rejoiced whole-heartedly at the break in\nthe monotony of life at Blandings Castle. Relations who had not\nbeen on speaking terms for years forgot their quarrels and\nstrolled about the grounds in perfect harmony, abusing Baxter.\nThe general verdict was that he was insane.\n\n\"Don't tell me that young fellow's all there,\" said Colonel\nHorace Mant; \"because I know better. Have you noticed his eye?\nFurtive! Shifty! Nasty gleam in it. Besides--dash it!--did you\nhappen to take a look at the hall last night after he had been\nthere? It was in ruins, my dear sir--absolute dashed ruins. It\nwas positively littered with broken china and tables that had\nbeen bowled over. Don't tell me that was just an accidental\ncollision in the dark.\n\n\"My dear sir, the man must have been thrashing about--absolutely\nthrashing about, like a dashed salmon on a dashed hook. He must\nhave had a paroxysm of some kind--some kind of a dashed fit. A\ndoctor could give you the name for it. It's a well-known form of\ninsanity. Paranoia--isn't that what they call it? Rush of blood\nto the head, followed by a general running amuck.\n\n\"I've heard fellows who have been in India talk of it. Natives\nget it. Don't know what they're doing, and charge through the\nstreets taking cracks at people with dashed whacking great\nknives. Same with this young man, probably in a modified form at\npresent. He ought to be in a home. One of these nights, if this\ngrows on him, he will be massacring Emsworth in his bed.\"\n\n\"My dear Horace!\" The Bishop of Godalming's voice was properly\nhorror-stricken; but there was a certain unctuous relish in it.\n\n\"Take my word for it! Though, mind you, I don't say they aren't\nwell suited. Everyone knows that Emsworth has been, to all\npractical intents and purposes, a dashed lunatic for years. What\nwas it that young fellow Emerson, Freddie's American friend, was\nsaying, the other day about some acquaintance of his who is not\nquite right in the head? Nobody in the house--is that it?\nSomething to that effect, at any rate. I felt at the time it was\na perfect description of Emsworth.\"\n\n\"My dear Horace! Your father-in-law! The head of the family!\"\n\n\"A dashed lunatic, my dear sir--head of the family or no head of\nthe family. A man as absent-minded as he is has no right to call\nhimself sane. Nobody in the house--I recollect it now--nobody in\nthe house except gas, and that has not been turned on. That's\nEmsworth!\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter, who had just left his presence, was feeling\nmuch the same about his noble employer. After a sleepless night\nhe had begun at an early hour to try and corner Lord Emsworth in\norder to explain to him the true inwardness of last night's\nhappenings. Eventually he had tracked him to the museum, where he\nfound him happily engaged in painting a cabinet of birds' eggs.\nHe was seated on a small stool, a large pot of red paint on the\nfloor beside him, dabbing at the cabinet with a dripping brush.\nHe was absorbed and made no attempt whatever to follow his\nsecretary's remarks.\n\nFor ten minutes Baxter gave a vivid picture of his vigil and the\nmanner in which it had been interrupted.\n\n\"Just so; just so, my dear fellow,\" said the earl when he had\nfinished. \"I quite understand. All I say is, if you do require\nadditional food in the night let one of the servants bring it to\nyour room before bedtime; then there will be no danger of these\ndisturbances. There is no possible objection to your eating a\nhundred meals a day, my good Baxter, provided you do not rouse\nthe whole house over them. Some of us like to sleep during the\nnight.\"\n\n\"But, Lord Emsworth! I have just explained--It was not--I was\nnot--\"\n\n\"Never mind, my dear fellow; never mind. Why make such an\nimportant thing of it? Many people like a light snack before\nactually retiring. Doctors, I believe, sometimes recommend it.\nTell me, Baxter, how do you think the museum looks now? A little\nbrighter? Better for the dash of color? I think so. Museums are\ngenerally such gloomy places.\"\n\n\"Lord Emsworth, may I explain once again?\"\n\nThe earl looked annoyed.\n\n\"My dear Baxter, I have told you that there is nothing to\nexplain. You are getting a little tedious. What a deep, rich red\nthis is, and how clean new paint smells! Do you know, Baxter, I\nhave been longing to mess about with paint ever since I was a\nboy! I recollect my old father beating me with a walking stick.\n. . . That would be before your time, of course. By the way, if\nyou see Freddie, will you tell him I want to speak to him? He\nprobably is in the smoking-room. Send him to me here.\"\n\nIt was an overwrought Baxter who delivered the message to the\nHonorable Freddie, who, as predicted, was in the smoking-room,\nlounging in a deep armchair.\n\nThere are times when life presses hard on a man, and it pressed\nhard on Baxter now. Fate had played him a sorry trick. It had put\nhim in a position where he had to choose between two courses,\neach as disagreeable as the other. He must either face a possible\nsecond fiasco like that of last night, or else he must abandon\nhis post and cease to mount guard over his threatened treasure.\n\nHis imagination quailed at the thought of a repetition of last\nnight's horrors. He had been badly shaken by his collision with\nthe table and even more so by the events that had followed it.\nThose revolver shots still rang in his ears.\n\nIt was probably the memory of those shots that turned the scale.\nIt was unlikely he would again become entangled with a man\nbearing a tongue and the other things--he had given up in despair\nthe attempt to unravel the mystery of the tongue; it completely\nbaffled him--but it was by no means unlikely that if he spent\nanother night in the gallery looking on the hall he might not\nagain become a target for Lord Emsworth's irresponsible firearm.\nNothing, in fact, was more likely; for in the disturbed state of\nthe public mind the slightest sound after nightfall would be\nsufficient cause for a fusillade.\n\nHe had actually overheard young Algernon Wooster telling Lord\nStockheath he had a jolly good mind to sit on the stairs that\nnight with a shotgun, because it was his opinion that there was a\njolly sight more in this business than there seemed to be; and\nwhat he thought of the bally affair was that there was a gang of\nsome kind at work, and that that feller--what's-his-name?--that\nfeller Baxter was some sort of an accomplice.\n\nWith these things in his mind Baxter decided to remain that night\nin the security of his bedroom. He had lost his nerve. He formed\nthis decision with the utmost reluctance, for the thought of\nleaving the road to the museum clear for marauders was bitter in\nthe extreme. If he could have overheard a conversation between\nJoan Valentine and Ashe Marson it is probable he would have\nrisked Lord Emsworth's revolver and the shotgun of the Honorable\nAlgernon Wooster.\n\nAshe, when he met Joan and recounted the events of the night, at\nwhich Joan, who was a sound sleeper, had not been present, was\ninclined to blame himself as a failure. True, fate had been\nagainst him, but the fact remained that he had achieved nothing.\nJoan, however, was not of this opinion.\n\n\"You have done wonders,\" she said. \"You have cleared the way for\nme. That is my idea of real teamwork. I'm so glad now that we\nformed our partnership. It would have been too bad if I had got\nall the advantage of your work and had jumped in and deprived you\nof the reward. As it is, I shall go down and finish the thing off\nto-night with a clear conscience.\"\n\n\"You can't mean that you dream of going down to the museum\nto-night!\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"But it's madness!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, to-night is the one night when there ought to\nbe no risk at all.\"\n\n\"After what happened last night?\"\n\n\"Because of what happened last night. Do you imagine Mr. Baxter\nwill dare to stir from his bed after that? If ever there was a\nchance of getting this thing finished, it will be to-night.\"\n\n\"You're quite right. I never looked at it in that way. Baxter\nwouldn't risk a second disaster. I'll certainly make a success of\nit this time.\"\n\nJoan raised her eyebrows.\n\n\"I don't quite understand you, Mr. Marson. Do you propose to try\nto get the scarab to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes. It will be as easy as--\"\n\n\"Are you forgetting that, by the terms of our agreement, it is my\nturn?\"\n\n\"You surely don't intend to hold me to that?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"But, good heavens, consider my position! Do you seriously expect\nme to lie in bed while you do all the work, and then to take a\nhalf share in the reward?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"It's ridiculous!\"\n\n\"It's no more ridiculous than that I should do the same. Mr.\nMarson, there's no use in our going over all this again. We\nsettled it long ago.\"\n\nJoan refused to discuss the matter further, leaving Ashe in a\ncondition of anxious misery comparable only to that which, as\nnight began to draw near, gnawed the vitals of the Efficient\nBaxter.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nBreakfast at Blandings Castle was an informal meal. There was\nfood and drink in the long dining-hall for such as were energetic\nenough to come down and get it; but the majority of the house\nparty breakfasted in their rooms, Lord Emsworth, whom nothing in\nthe world would have induced to begin the day in the company of a\ncrowd of his relations, most of whom he disliked, setting them\nthe example.\n\nWhen, therefore, Baxter, yielding to Nature after having remained\nawake until the early morning, fell asleep at nine o'clock,\nnobody came to rouse him. He did not ring his bell, so he was not\ndisturbed; and he slept on until half past eleven, by which time,\nit being Sunday morning and the house party including one bishop\nand several of the minor clergy, most of the occupants of the\nplace had gone off to church.\n\nBaxter shaved and dressed hastily, for he was in state of nervous\napprehension. He blamed himself for having lain in bed so long.\nWhen every minute he was away might mean the loss of the scarab,\nhe had passed several hours in dreamy sloth. He had wakened with\na presentiment. Something told him the scarab had been stolen in\nthe night, and he wished now that he had risked all and kept\nguard.\n\nThe house was very quiet as he made his way rapidly to the hall.\nAs he passed a window he perceived Lord Emsworth, in an\nun-Sabbatarian suit of tweeds and bearing a garden fork--which\nmust have pained the bishop--bending earnestly over a flower bed;\nbut he was the only occupant of the grounds, and indoors there\nwas a feeling of emptiness. The hall had that Sunday-morning air\nof wanting to be left to itself, and disapproving of the entry of\nanything human until lunch time, which can be felt only by a\nguest in a large house who remains at home when his fellows have\ngone to church.\n\nThe portraits on the walls, especially the one of the Countess of\nEmsworth in the character of Venus rising from the sea, stared at\nBaxter as he entered, with cold reproof. The very chairs seemed\ndistant and unfriendly; but Baxter was in no mood to appreciate\ntheir attitude. His conscience slept. His mind was occupied, to\nthe exclusion of all other things, by the scarab and its probable\nfate. How disastrously remiss it had been of him not to keep\nguard last night! Long before he opened the museum door he was\nfeeling the absolute certainty that the worst had happened.\n\nIt had. The card which announced that here was an Egyptian scarab\nof the reign of Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty, presented by J.\nPreston Peters, Esquire, still lay on the cabinet in its wonted\nplace; but now its neat lettering was false and misleading. The\nscarab was gone.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nFor all that he had expected this, for all his premonition of\ndisaster, it was an appreciable time before the Efficient Baxter\nrallied from the blow. He stood transfixed, goggling at the empty\nplace.\n\nThen his mind resumed its functions. All, he perceived, was not\nyet lost. Baxter the watchdog must retire, to be succeeded by\nBaxter the sleuthhound. He had been unable to prevent the theft\nof the scarab, but he might still detect the thief.\n\nFor the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock\nHolmeses, success in the province of detective work must always\nbe, to a very large extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes\ncan extract a clew from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash;\nbut Doctor Watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted,\nand exhibited clearly, with a label attached.\n\nThe average man is a Doctor Watson. We are wont to scoff in a\npatronizing manner at that humble follower of the great\ninvestigator; but as a matter of fact we should have been just as\ndull ourselves. We should not even have risen to the modest\nheight of a Scotland Yard bungler.\n\nBaxter was a Doctor Watson. What he wanted was a clew; but it is\nso hard for the novice to tell what is a clew and what is not.\nAnd then he happened to look down--and there on the floor was a\nclew that nobody could have overlooked.\n\nBaxter saw it, but did not immediately recognize it for what it\nwas. What he saw, at first, was not a clew, but just a mess. He\nhad a tidy soul and abhorred messes, and this was a particularly\nmessy mess. A considerable portion of the floor was a sea of red\npaint. The can from which it had flowed was lying on its\nside--near the wall. He had noticed that the smell of paint had\nseemed particularly pungent, but had attributed this to a new\nfreshet of energy on the part of Lord Emsworth. He had not\nperceived that paint had been spilled.\n\n\"Pah!\" said Baxter.\n\nThen suddenly, beneath the disguise of the mess, he saw the clew.\nA footmark! No less. A crimson footmark on the polished wood! It\nwas as clear and distinct as though it had been left there for\nthe purpose of assisting him. It was a feminine footmark, the\nprint of a slim and pointed shoe.\n\nThis perplexed Baxter. He had looked on the siege of the scarab\nas an exclusively male affair. But he was not perplexed long.\nWhat could be simpler than that Mr. Peters should have enlisted\nfemale aid? The female of the species is more deadly than the\nmale. Probably she makes a better purloiner of scarabs. At any\nrate, there the footprint was, unmistakably feminine.\n\nInspiration came to him. Aline Peters had a maid! What more\nlikely than that secretly she should be a hireling of Mr. Peters,\non whom he had now come to look as a man of the blackest and most\nsinister character? Mr. Peters was a collector; and when a\ncollector makes up his mind to secure a treasure, he employs,\nBaxter knew, every possible means to that end.\n\nBaxter was now in a state of great excitement. He was hot on the\nscent and his brain was working like a buzz saw in an ice box.\nAccording to his reasoning, if Aline Peters' maid had done this\nthing there should be red paint in the hall marking her retreat,\nand possibly a faint stain on the stairs leading to the servants'\nbedrooms.\n\nHe hastened from the museum and subjected the hall to a keen\nscrutiny. Yes; there was red paint on the carpet. He passed\nthrough the green-baize door and examined the stairs. On the\nbottom step there was a faint but conclusive stain of crimson!\n\nHe was wondering how best to follow up this clew when he\nperceived Ashe coming down the stairs. Ashe, like Baxter, and as\nthe result of a night disturbed by anxious thoughts, had also\noverslept himself.\n\nThere are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the\ntrail causes the amateur--or Watsonian--detective to be\nincautious. If Baxter had been wise he would have achieved his\nobject--the getting a glimpse of Joan's shoes--by a devious and\nsnaky route. As it was, zeal getting the better of prudence, he\nrushed straight on. His early suspicion of Ashe had been\ntemporarily obscured. Whatever Ashe's claims to be a suspect, it\nhad not been his footprint Baxter had seen in the museum.\n\n\"Here, you!\" said the Efficient Baxter excitedly.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"The shoes!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"I wish to see the servants' shoes. Where are they?\"\n\n\"I expect they have them on, sir.\"\n\n\"Yesterday's shoes, man--yesterday's shoes. Where are they?\"\n\n\"Where are the shoes of yesteryear?\" murmured Ashe. \"I should say\nat a venture, sir, that they would be in a large basket somewhere\nnear the kitchen. Our genial knife-and-shoe boy collects them, I\nbelieve, at early dawn.\"\n\n\"Would they have been cleaned yet?\"\n\n\"If I know the lad, sir--no.\"\n\n\"Go and bring that basket to me. Bring it to me in this room.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe room to which he referred was none other than the private\nsanctum of Mr. Beach, the butler, the door of which, standing\nopen, showed it to be empty. It was not Baxter's plan, excited as\nhe was, to risk being discovered sifting shoes in the middle of a\npassage in the servants' quarters.\n\nAshe's brain was working rapidly as he made for the shoe\ncupboard, that little den of darkness and smells, where Billy,\nthe knife-and-shoe boy, better known in the circle in which he\nmoved as Young Bonehead, pursued his menial tasks. What exactly\nwas at the back of the Efficient Baxter's mind prompting these\nmaneuvers he did not know; but that there was something he was\ncertain.\n\nHe had not yet seen Joan this morning, and he did not know\nwhether or not she had carried out her resolve of attempting to\nsteal the scarab on the previous night; but this activity and\nmystery on the part of their enemy must have some sinister\nsignificance. He gathered up the shoe basket thoughtfully. He\nstaggered back with it and dumped it down on the floor of Mr.\nBeach's room. The Efficient Baxter stooped eagerly over it.\nAshe, leaning against the wall, straightened the creases in his\nclothes and flicked disgustedly at an inky spot which the journey\nhad transferred from the basket to his coat.\n\n\"We have here, sir,\" he said, \"a fair selection of our various\nfoot coverings.\"\n\n\"You did not drop any on your way?\"\n\n\"Not one, sir.\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter uttered a grunt of satisfaction and bent\nonce more to his task. Shoes flew about the room. Baxter knelt on\nthe floor beside the basket, and dug like a terrier at a rat\nhole. At last he made a find and with an exclamation of triumph\nrose to his feet. In his hand he held a shoe.\n\n\"Put those back,\" he said.\n\nAshe began to pick up the scattered footgear.\n\n\"That's the lot, sir,\" he said, rising.\n\n\"Now come with me. Leave the basket there. You can carry it back\nwhen you return.\"\n\n\"Shall I put back that shoe, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I shall take this one with me.\"\n\n\"Shall I carry it for you, sir?\"\n\nBaxter reflected.\n\n\"Yes. I think that would be best.\"\n\nTrouble had shaken his nerve. He was not certain that there might\nnot be others besides Lord Emsworth in the garden; and it\noccurred to him that, especially after his reputation for\neccentric conduct had been so firmly established by his\nmisfortunes that night in the hall, it might cause comment should\nhe appear before them carrying a shoe.\n\nAshe took the shoe and, doing so, understood what before had\npuzzled him. Across the toe was a broad splash of red paint.\nThough he had nothing else to go on, he saw all. The shoe he held\nwas a female shoe. His own researches in the museum had made him\naware of the presence there of red paint. It was not difficult to\nbuild up on these data a pretty accurate estimate of the position\nof affairs.\n\n\"Come with me,\" said Baxter.\n\nHe left the room. Ashe followed him.\n\nIn the garden Lord Emsworth, garden fork in hand, was dealing\nsummarily with a green young weed that had incautiously shown its\nhead in the middle of a flower bed. He listened to Baxter's\nstatement with more interest than he usually showed in anybody's\nstatements. He resented the loss of the scarab, not so much on\naccount of its intrinsic worth as because it had been the gift of\nhis friend Mr. Peters.\n\n\"Indeed!\" he said, when Baxter had finished. \"Really? Dear me!\nIt certainly seems--It is extremely suggestive. You are certain\nthere was red paint on this shoe?\"\n\n\"I have it with me. I brought it on purpose to show you.\" He\nlooked at Ashe, who stood in close attendance. \"The shoe!\"\n\nLord Emsworth polished his glasses and bent over the exhibit.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"Now let me look at--This, you say, is the--Just\nso; just so! Just--My dear Baxter, it may be that I have not\nexamined this shoe with sufficient care, but--Can you point out\nto me exactly where this paint is that you speak of?\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter stood staring at the shoe with wild, fixed\nstare. Of any suspicion of paint, red or otherwise, it was\nabsolutely and entirely innocent!\n\nThe shoe became the center of attraction, the center of all eyes.\nThe Efficient Baxter fixed it with the piercing glare of one who\nfeels that his brain is tottering. Lord Emsworth looked at it\nwith a mildly puzzled expression. Ashe Marson examined it with a\nsort of affectionate interest, as though he were waiting for it\nto do a trick of some kind. Baxter was the first to break the\nsilence.\n\n\"There was paint on this shoe,\" he said vehemently. \"I tell you\nthere was a splash of red paint across the toe. This man here\nwill bear me out in this. You saw paint on this shoe?\"\n\n\"Paint, sir?\"\n\n\"What! Do you mean to tell me you did not see it?\"\n\n\"No, sir; there was no paint on this shoe.\"\n\n\"This is ridiculous. I saw it with my own eyes. It was a broad\nsplash right across the toe.\"\n\nLord Emsworth interposed.\n\n\"You must have made a mistake, my dear Baxter. There is certainly\nno trace of paint on this shoe. These momentary optical delusions\nare, I fancy, not uncommon. Any doctor will tell you--\"\n\n\"I had an aunt, your lordship,\" said Ashe chattily, \"who was\nremarkably subject--\"\n\n\"It is absurd! I cannot have been mistaken,\" said Baxter. \"I am\npositively certain the toe of this shoe was red when I found it.\"\n\n\"It is quite black now, my dear Baxter.\"\n\n\"A sort of chameleon shoe,\" murmured Ashe.\n\nThe goaded secretary turned on him.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\nBaxter's old suspicion of this smooth young man came surging back\nto him.\n\n\"I strongly suspect you of having had something to do with this.\"\n\n\"Really, Baxter,\" said the earl, \"that is surely the least\nprobable of solutions. This young man could hardly have cleaned\nthe shoe on his way from the house. A few days ago, when painting\nin the museum, I inadvertently splashed some paint on my own\nshoe. I can assure you it does not brush off. It needs a very\nsystematic cleaning before all traces are removed.\"\n\n\"Exactly, your lordship,\" said Ashe. \"My theory, if I may--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"My theory, your lordship, is that Mr. Baxter was deceived by the\nlight-and-shade effects on the toe of the shoe. The morning sun,\nstreaming in through the window, must have shone on the shoe in\nsuch a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious aspect of\nredness. If Mr. Baxter recollects, he did not look long at the\nshoe. The picture on the retina of the eye consequently had not\ntime to fade. I myself remember thinking at the moment that the\nshoe appeared to have a certain reddish tint. The mistake--\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Baxter shortly.\n\nLord Emsworth, now thoroughly bored with the whole affair and\ndesiring nothing more than to be left alone with his weeds and\nhis garden fork, put in his word. Baxter, he felt, was curiously\nirritating these days. He always seemed to be bobbing up. The\nEarl of Emsworth was conscious of a strong desire to be free from\nhis secretary's company. He was efficient, yes--invaluable\nindeed--he did not know what he should do without Baxter; but\nthere was no denying that his company tended after a while to\nbecome a trifle tedious. He took a fresh grip on his garden fork\nand shifted it about in the air as a hint that the interview had\nlasted long enough.\n\n\"It seems to me, my dear fellow,\" he said, \"the only explanation\nthat will square with the facts. A shoe that is really smeared\nwith red paint does not become black of itself in the course of a\nfew minutes.\"\n\n\"You are very right, your lordship,\" said Ashe approvingly. \"May\nI go now, your lordship?\"\n\n\"Certainly--certainly; by all means.\"\n\n\"Shall I take the shoe with me, your lordship?\"\n\n\"If you do not want it, Baxter.\"\n\nThe secretary passed the fraudulent piece of evidence to Ashe\nwithout a word; and the latter, having included both gentlemen in\na kindly smile, left the garden.\n\nOn returning to the butler's room, Ashe's first act was to remove\na shoe from the top of the pile in the basket. He was about to\nleave the room with it, when the sound of footsteps in the\npassage outside halted him.\n\n\"I do not in the least understand why you wish me to come here,\nmy dear Baxter,\" said a voice, \"and you are completely spoiling\nmy morning, but--\"\n\nFor a moment Ashe was at a loss. It was a crisis that called for\nswift action, and it was a little hard to know exactly what to\ndo. It had been his intention to carry the paint-splashed shoe\nback to his own room, there to clean it at his leisure; but it\nappeared that his strategic line of retreat was blocked. Plainly,\nthe possibility--nay, the certainty--that Ashe had substituted\nanother shoe for the one with the incriminating splash of paint\non it had occurred to the Efficient Baxter almost directly the\nformer had left the garden.\n\nThe window was open. Ashe looked out. There were bushes below.\nIt was a makeshift policy, and one which did not commend itself\nto him as the ideal method, but it seemed the only thing to be\ndone, for already the footsteps had reached the door. He threw\nthe shoe out of window, and it sank beneath the friendly surface\nof the long grass round a wisteria bush.\n\nAshe turned, relieved, and the next moment the door opened and\nBaxter walked in, accompanied--with obvious reluctance---by his\nbored employer.\n\nBaxter was brisk and peremptory.\n\n\"I wish to look at those shoes again,\" he said coldly.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"I can manage without your assistance,\" said Baxter.\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nLeaning against the wall, Ashe watched him with silent interest,\nas he burrowed among the contents of the basket, like a terrier\ndigging for rats. The Earl of Emsworth took no notice of the\nproceedings. He yawned plaintively, and pottered about the room.\nHe was one of Nature's potterers.\n\nThe scrutiny of the man whom he had now placed definitely as a\nmalefactor irritated Baxter. Ashe was looking at him in an\ninsufferably tolerant manner, as if he were an indulgent father\nbrooding over his infant son while engaged in some childish\nfrolic. He lodged a protest.\n\n\"Don't stand there staring at me!\"\n\n\"I was interested in what you were doing, sir.\"\n\n\"Never mind! Don't stare at me in that idiotic way.\"\n\n\"May I read a book, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, read if you like.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nAshe took a volume from the butler's slenderly stocked shelf. The\nshoe-expert resumed his investigations in the basket. He went\nthrough it twice, but each time without success. After the second\nsearch he stood up and looked wildly about the room. He was as\ncertain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of\nevidence was somewhere within those four walls. There was very\nlittle cover in the room, even for so small a fugitive as a shoe.\nHe raised the tablecloth and peered beneath the table.\n\n\"Are you looking for Mr. Beach, sir?\" said Ashe. \"I think he has\ngone to church.\"\n\nBaxter, pink with his exertions, fastened a baleful glance upon\nhim.\n\n\"You had better be careful,\" he said.\n\nAt this point the Earl of Emsworth, having done all the pottering\npossible in the restricted area, yawned like an alligator.\n\n\"Now, my dear Baxter--\" he began querulously.\n\nBaxter was not listening. He was on the trail. He had caught\nsight of a small closet in the wall, next to the mantelpiece, and\nit had stimulated him.\n\n\"What is in this closet?\"\n\n\"That closet, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, this closet.\" He rapped the door irritably.\n\n\"I could not say, sir. Mr. Beach, to whom the closet belongs,\npossibly keeps a few odd trifles there. A ball of string,\nperhaps. Maybe an old pipe or something of that kind. Probably\nnothing of value or interest.\"\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\n\"It appears to be locked, sir--\"\n\n\"Unlock it.\"\n\n\"But where is the key?\"\n\nBaxter thought for a moment.\n\n\"Lord Emsworth,\" he said, \"I have my reasons for thinking that\nthis man is deliberately keeping the contents of this closet from\nme. I am convinced that the shoe is in there. Have I your leave\nto break open the door?\"\n\nThe earl looked a little dazed, as if he were unequal to the\nintellectual pressure of the conversation.\n\n\"Now, my dear Baxter,\" said the earl impatiently, \"please tell me\nonce again why you have brought me in here. I cannot make head or\ntail of what you have been saying. Apparently you accuse this\nyoung man of keeping his shoes in a closet. Why should you\nsuspect him of keeping his shoes in a closet? And if he wishes to\ndo so, why on earth should not he keep his shoes in a closet?\nThis is a free country.\"\n\n\"Exactly, your lordship,\" said Ashe approvingly. \"You have\ntouched the spot.\"\n\n\"It all has to do with the theft of your scarab, Lord Emsworth.\nSomebody got into the museum and stole the scarab.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; ah, yes--so they did. I remember now. You told me.\nBad business that, my dear Baxter. Mr. Peters gave me that\nscarab. He will be most deucedly annoyed if it's lost. Yes,\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Whoever stole it upset the can of red paint and stepped in it.\"\n\n\"Devilish careless of them. It must have made the dickens of a\nmess. Why don't people look where they are walking?\"\n\n\"I suspect this man of shielding the criminal by hiding her shoe\nin this closet.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not his own shoes that this young man keeps in\nclosets?\"\n\n\"It is a woman's shoe, Lord Emsworth.\"\n\n\"The deuce it is! Then it was a woman who stole the scarab? Is\nthat the way you figure it out? Bless my soul, Baxter, one\nwonders what women are coming to nowadays. It's all this\nmovement, I suppose. The Vote, and all that--eh? I recollect\nhaving a chat with the Marquis of Petersfield some time ago. He\nis in the Cabinet, and he tells me it is perfectly infernal the\nway these women carry on. He said sometimes it got to such a\npitch, with them waving banners and presenting petitions, and\nthrowing flour and things at a fellow, that if he saw his own\nmother coming toward him, with a hand behind her back, he would\nrun like a rabbit. Told me so himself.\"\n\n\"So,\" said the Efficient Baxter, cutting in on the flow of\nspeech, \"what I wish to do is to break open this closet.\"\n\n\"Eh? Why?\"\n\n\"To get the shoe.\"\n\n\"The shoe? . . . Ah, yes, I recollect now. You were telling me.\"\n\n\"If your lordship has no objection.\"\n\n\"Objection, my dear fellow? None in the world. Why should I have\nany objection? Let me see! What is it you wish to do?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Baxter shortly.\n\nHe seized the poker from the fireplace and delivered two rapid\nblows on the closet door. The wood was splintered. A third blow\nsmashed the flimsy lock. The closet, with any skeletons it might\ncontain, was open for all to view.\n\nIt contained a corkscrew, a box of matches, a paper-covered copy\nof a book entitled \"Mary, the Beautiful Mill-Hand,\" a bottle of\nembrocation, a spool of cotton, two pencil-stubs, and other\nuseful and entertaining objects. It contained, in fact, almost\neverything except a paint-splashed shoe, and Baxter gazed at the\ncollection in dumb disappointment.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now, my dear Baxter,\" said the earl, \"or is\nthere any more furniture that you would like to break? You know,\nthis furniture breaking is becoming a positive craze with you, my\ndear fellow. You ought to fight against it. The night before\nlast, I don't know how many tables broken in the hall; and now\nthis closet. You will ruin me. No purse can stand the constant\ndrain.\"\n\nBaxter did not reply. He was still trying to rally from the blow.\nA chance remark of Lord Emsworth's set him off on the trail once\nmore. Lord Emsworth, having said his say, had dismissed the\naffair from his mind and begun to potter again. The course of his\npottering had brought him to the fireplace, where a little pile\nof soot on the fender caught his eye. He bent down to inspect it.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he said. \"I must remember to tell Beach to have his\nchimney swept. It seems to need it badly.\"\n\nNo trumpet-call ever acted more instantaneously on old war-horse\nthan this simple remark on the Efficient Baxter. He was still\nconvinced that Ashe had hidden the shoe somewhere in the room,\nand, now that the closet had proved an alibi, the chimney was the\nonly spot that remained unsearched. He dived forward with a rush,\nnearly knocking Lord Emsworth off his feet, and thrust an arm up\ninto the unknown. The startled peer, having recovered his\nbalance, met Ashe's respectfully pitying gaze.\n\n\"We must humor him,\" said the gaze, more plainly than speech.\n\nBaxter continued to grope. The chimney was a roomy chimney, and\nneeded careful examination. He wriggled his hand about\nclutchingly. From time to time soot fell in gentle showers.\n\n\"My dear Baxter!\"\n\nBaxter was baffled. He withdrew his hand from the chimney, and\nstraightened himself. He brushed a bead of perspiration from his\nface with the back of his hand. Unfortunately, he used the sooty\nhand, and the result was too much for Lord Emsworth's politeness.\nHe burst into a series of pleased chuckles.\n\n\"Your face, my dear Baxter! Your face! It is positively covered\nwith soot--positively! You must go and wash it. You are quite\nblack. Really, my dear fellow, you present rather an\nextraordinary appearance. Run off to your room.\"\n\nAgainst this crowning blow the Efficient Baxter could not stand\nup. It was the end.\n\n\"Soot!\" he murmured weakly. \"Soot!\"\n\n\"Your face is covered, my dear fellow--quite covered.\"\n\n\"It certainly has a faintly sooty aspect, sir,\" said Ashe.\n\nHis voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit.\n\n\"You will hear more of this,\" he said. \"You will--\"\n\nAt this moment, slightly muffled by the intervening door and\npassageway, there came from the direction of the hall a sound\nlike the delivery of a ton of coal. A heavy body bumped down the\nstairs, and a voice which all three recognized as that of the\nHonorable Freddie uttered an oath that lost itself in a final\ncrash and a musical splintering sound, which Baxter for one had\nno difficulty in recognizing as the dissolution of occasional\nchina.\n\nEven if they had not so able a detective as Baxter with them,\nLord Emsworth and Ashe would have been at no loss to guess what\nhad happened. Doctor Watson himself could have deduced it from\nthe evidence. The Honorable Freddie had fallen downstairs.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nWith a little ingenuity this portion of the story of Mr. Peters'\nscarab could be converted into an excellent tract, driving home\nthe perils, even in this world, of absenting one's self from\nchurch on Sunday morning. If the Honorable Freddie had gone to\nchurch he would not have been running down the great staircase at\nthe castle at this hour; and if he had not been running down the\ngreat staircase at the castle at that hour he would not have\nencountered Muriel.\n\nMuriel was a Persian cat belonging to Lady Ann Warblington. Lady\nAnn had breakfasted in bed and lain there late, as she rather\nfancied she had one of her sick headaches coming on. Muriel had\nleft her room in the wake of the breakfast tray, being anxious to\nbe present at the obsequies of a fried sole that had formed Lady\nAnn's simple morning meal, and had followed the maid who bore it\nuntil she had reached the hall.\n\nAt this point the maid, who disliked Muriel, stopped and made a\nnoise like an exploding pop bottle, at the same time taking a\nlittle run in Muriel's direction and kicking at her with a\nmenacing foot. Muriel, wounded and startled, had turned in her\ntracks and sprinted back up the staircase at the exact moment\nwhen the Honorable Freddie, who for some reason was in a great\nhurry, ran lightly down.\n\nThere was an instant when Freddie could have saved himself by\nplanting a number-ten shoe on Muriel's spine, but even in that\ncrisis he bethought him that he hardly stood solid enough with\nthe authorities to risk adding to his misdeeds the slaughter of\nhis aunt's favorite cat, and he executed a rapid swerve. The\nspared cat proceeded on her journey upstairs, while Freddie,\ntouching the staircase at intervals, went on down.\n\nHaving reached the bottom, he sat amid the occasional china, like\nMarius among the ruins of Carthage, and endeavored to ascertain\nthe extent of his injuries. He had a dazed suspicion that he was\nirretrievably fractured in a dozen places. It was in this\nattitude that the rescue party found him. He gazed up at them\nwith silent pathos.\n\n\"In the name of goodness, Frederick,\" said Lord Emsworth\npeevishly, \"what do you imagine you are doing?\"\n\nFreddie endeavored to rise, but sank back again with a stifled\nhowl.\n\n\"It was that bally cat of Aunt Ann's,\" he said. \"It came legging\nit up the stairs. I think I've broken my leg.\"\n\n\"You have certainly broken everything else,\" said his father\nunsympathetically. \"Between you and Baxter, I wonder there's a\nstick of furniture standing in the house.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old chap,\" said Freddie gratefully as Ashe stepped\nforward and lent him an arm. \"I think my bally ankle must have\ngot twisted. I wish you would give me a hand up to my room.\"\n\n\"And, Baxter, my dear fellow,\" said Lord Emsworth, \"you might\ntelephone to Doctor Bird, in Market Blandings, and ask him to be\ngood enough to drive out. I am sorry, Freddie,\" he added, \"that\nyou should have met with this accident; but--but everything is\nso--so disturbing nowadays that I feel--I feel most disturbed.\"\n\nAshe and the Honorable Freddie began to move across the\nhall--Freddie hopping, Ashe advancing with a sort of polka step.\nAs they reached the stairs there was a sound of wheels outside\nand the vanguard of the house party, returned from church,\nentered the house.\n\n\"It's all very well to give it out officially that Freddie has\nfallen downstairs and sprained his ankle,\" said Colonel Horace\nMant, discussing the affair with the Bishop of Godalming later in\nthe afternoon; \"but it's my firm belief that that fellow Baxter\ndid precisely as I said he would--ran amuck and inflicted dashed\nfrightful injuries on young Freddie. When I got into the house\nthere was Freddie being helped up the stairs, while Baxter, with\nhis face covered with soot, was looking after him with a sort of\nevil grin. What had he smeared his face with soot for, I should\nlike to know, if he were perfectly sane?\n\n\"The whole thing is dashed fishy and mysterious and the sooner I\ncan get Mildred safely out of the place, the better I shall be\npleased. The fellow's as mad as a hatter!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWhen Lord Emsworth, sighting Mr. Peters in the group of returned\nchurchgoers, drew him aside and broke the news that the valuable\nscarab, so kindly presented by him to the castle museum, had been\nstolen in the night by some person unknown, he thought the\nmillionaire took it exceedingly well. Though the stolen object no\nlonger belonged to him, Mr. Peters no doubt still continued to\ntake an affectionate interest in it and might have been excused\nhad he shown annoyance that his gift had been so carelessly\nguarded.\n\nMr. Peters was, however, thoroughly magnanimous about the matter.\nHe deprecated the notion that the earl could possibly have\nprevented this unfortunate occurrence. He quite understood. He\nwas not in the least hurt. Nobody could have foreseen such a\ncalamity. These things happened and one had to accept them. He\nhimself had once suffered in much the same way, the gem of his\ncollection having been removed almost beneath his eyes in the\nsmoothest possible fashion.\n\nAltogether, he relieved Lord Emsworth's mind very much; and when\nhe had finished doing so he departed swiftly and rang for Ashe.\nWhen Ashe arrived he bubbled over with enthusiasm. He was lyrical\nin his praise. He went so far as to slap Ashe on the back. It was\nonly when the latter disclaimed all credit for what had occurred\nthat he checked the flow of approbation.\n\n\"It wasn't you who got it? Who was it, then?\"\n\n\"It was Miss Peters' maid. It's a long story; but we were working\nin partnership. I tried for the thing and failed, and she\nsucceeded.\"\n\nIt was with mixed feelings that Ashe listened while Mr. Peters\ntransferred his adjectives of commendation to Joan. He admired\nJoan's courage, he was relieved that her venture had ended\nwithout disaster, and he knew that she deserved whatever anyone\ncould find to say in praise of her enterprise: but, at first,\nthough he tried to crush it down, he could not help feeling a\ncertain amount of chagrin that a girl should have succeeded where\nhe, though having the advantage of first chance, had failed. The\nterms of his partnership with Joan had jarred on him from the\nbeginning.\n\nA man may be in sympathy with the modern movement for the\nemancipation of woman and yet feel aggrieved when a mere girl\nproves herself a more efficient thief than himself. Woman is\ninvading man's sphere more successfully every day; but there are\nstill certain fields in which man may consider that he is\nrightfully entitled to a monopoly--and the purloining of scarabs\nin the watches of the night is surely one of them. Joan, in\nAshe's opinion, should have played a meeker and less active part.\n\nThese unworthy emotions did not last long. Whatever his other\nshortcomings, Ashe possessed a just mind. By the time he had\nfound Joan, after Mr. Peters had said his say, and dispatched him\nbelow stairs for that purpose, he had purged himself of petty\nregrets and was prepared to congratulate her whole-heartedly. He\nwas, however, resolved that nothing should induce him to share in\nthe reward. On that point, he resolved, he would refuse to be\nshaken.\n\n\"I have just left Mr. Peters,\" he began. \"All is well. His check\nbook lies before him on the table and he is trying to make his\nfountain pen work long enough to write a check. But there is just\none thing I want to say--\"\n\nShe interrupted him. To his surprise, she was eyeing him coldly\nand with disapproval.\n\n\"And there is just one thing I want to say,\" she said; \"and that\nis, if you imagine I shall consent to accept a penny of the\nreward--\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was going to say. Of course I couldn't dream of\ntaking any of it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you. You are certainly going to have it all.\nI told you when we made our agreement that I should only take my\nshare if you let me do my share of the work. Now that you have\nbroken that agreement, nothing could induce me to take it. I know\nyou meant it kindly, Mr. Marson, but I simply can't feel\ngrateful. I told you that ours was a business contract and that I\nwouldn't have any chivalry; and I thought that after you had\ngiven me your promise--\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Ashe, bewildered. \"I can't follow this. What\ndo you mean?\"\n\n\"What do I mean? Why, that you went down to the museum last night\nbefore me and took the scarab, though you had promised to stay\naway and give me my chance.\"\n\n\"But I didn't do anything of the sort.\"\n\nIt was Joan's turn to look bewildered.\n\n\"But you have got the scarab, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"Why, you have got it!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"But--but it has gone!\"\n\n\"I know. I went down to the museum last night, as we had\narranged; and when I got there there was no scarab. It had\ndisappeared.\"\n\nThey looked at each other in consternation. Ashe was the first to\nspeak.\n\n\"It was gone when you got to the museum?\"\n\n\"There wasn't a trace of it. I took it for granted that you had\nbeen down before me. I was furious!\"\n\n\"But this is ridiculous!\" said Ashe. \"Who can have taken it?\nThere was nobody beside ourselves who knew Mr. Peters was\noffering the reward. What exactly happened last night?\"\n\n\"I waited until one o'clock. Then I slipped down, got into the\nmuseum, struck a match, and looked for the scarab. It wasn't\nthere. I couldn't believe it at first. I struck some more\nmatches--quite a number--but it was no good. The scarab was gone;\nso I went back to bed and thought hard thoughts about you. It was\nsilly of me. I ought to have known you would not break your word;\nbut there didn't seem any other solution of the thing's\ndisappearance.\n\n\"Well, somebody must have taken it; and the question is, what are\nwe to do?\" She laughed. \"It seems to me that we were a little\npremature in quarreling about how we are to divide that reward.\nIt looks as though there wasn't going to be any reward.\"\n\n\"Meantime,\" said Ashe gloomily, \"I suppose I have got to go back\nand tell Peters. I expect it will break his heart.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nBlandings Castle dozed in the calm of an English Sunday\nafternoon. All was peace. Freddie was in bed, with orders from\nthe doctor to stay there until further notice. Baxter had washed\nhis face. Lord Emsworth had returned to his garden fork. The rest\nof the house party strolled about the grounds or sat in them, for\nthe day was one of those late spring days that are warm with a\npremature suggestion of midsummer.\n\nAline Peters was sitting at the open window of her bedroom, which\ncommanded an extensive view of the terraces. A pile of letters\nlay on the table beside her, for she had just finished reading\nher mail. The postman came late to the castle on Sundays and she\nhad not been able to do this until luncheon was over.\n\nAline was puzzled. She was conscious of a fit of depression for\nwhich she could in no way account. She had a feeling that all was\nnot well with the world, which was the more remarkable in that\nshe was usually keenly susceptible to weather conditions and\nreveled in sunshine like a kitten. Yet here was a day nearly as\nfine as an American day--and she found no solace in it.\n\nShe looked down on the terrace; as she looked the figure of\nGeorge Emerson appeared, walking swiftly. And at the sight of him\nsomething seemed to tell her that she had found the key to her\ngloom.\n\nThere are many kinds of walk. George Emerson's was the walk of\nmental unrest. His hands were clasped behind his back, his eyes\nstared straight in front of him from beneath lowering brows, and\nbetween his teeth was an unlighted cigar. No man who is not a\nprofessional politician holds an unlighted cigar in his mouth\nunless he wishes to irritate and baffle a ticket chopper in the\nsubway, or because unpleasant meditations have caused him to\nforget he has it there. Plainly, then, all was not well with\nGeorge Emerson.\n\nAline had suspected as much at luncheon; and looking back she\nrealized that it was at luncheon her depression had begun. The\ndiscovery startled her a little. She had not been aware, or she\nhad refused to admit to herself, that George's troubles bulked so\nlarge on her horizon. She had always told herself that she liked\nGeorge, that George was a dear old friend, that George amused and\nstimulated her; but she would have denied she was so wrapped up\nin George that the sight of him in trouble would be enough to\nspoil for her the finest day she had seen since she left America.\n\nThere was something not only startling but shocking in the\nthought; for she was honest enough with herself to recognize that\nFreddie, her official loved one, might have paced the grounds of\nthe castle chewing an unlighted cigar by the hour without\nstirring any emotion in her at all.\n\nAnd she was to marry Freddie next month! This was surely a matter\nthat called for thought. She proceeded, gazing down the while at\nthe perambulating George, to give it thought.\n\nAline's was not a deep nature. She had never pretended to herself\nthat she loved the Honorable Freddie in the sense in which the\nword is used in books. She liked him and she liked the idea of\nbeing connected with the peerage; her father liked the idea and\nshe liked her father. And the combination of these likings had\ncaused her to reply \"Yes\" when, last Autumn, Freddie, swelling\nhimself out like an embarrassed frog and gulping, had uttered\nthat memorable speech beginning, \"I say, you know, it's like\nthis, don't you know!\"--and ending, \"What I mean is, will you\nmarry me--what?\"\n\nShe had looked forward to being placidly happy as the Honorable\nMrs. Frederick Threepwood. And then George Emerson had reappeared\nin her life, a disturbing element.\n\nUntil to-day she would have resented the suggestion that she was\nin love with George. She liked to be with him, partly because he\nwas so easy to talk to, and partly because it was exciting to be\ncontinually resisting the will power he made no secret of trying\nto exercise. But to-day there was a difference. She had suspected\nit at luncheon and she realized it now. As she looked down at him\nfrom behind the curtain, and marked his air of gloom, she could\nno longer disguise it from herself.\n\nShe felt maternal--horribly maternal. George was in trouble and\nshe wanted to comfort him.\n\nFreddie, too, was in trouble. But did she want to comfort\nFreddie? No. On the contrary, she was already regretting her\npromise, so lightly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him\nthat afternoon. A well-marked feeling of annoyance that he should\nhave been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle\nwas her chief sentiment respecting Freddie.\n\nGeorge Emerson continued to perambulate and Aline continued to\nwatch him. At last she could endure it no longer. She gathered up\nher letters, stacked them in a corner of the dressing-table and\nleft the room. George had reached the end of the terrace and\nturned when she began to descend the stone steps outside the\nfront door. He quickened his pace as he caught sight of her. He\nhalted before her and surveyed her morosely.\n\n\"I have been looking for you,\" he said.\n\n\"And here I am. Cheer up, George! Whatever is the matter? I've\nbeen sitting in my room looking at you, and you have been simply\nprowling. What has gone wrong?\"\n\n\"Everything!\"\n\n\"How do you mean--everything?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I say. I'm done for. Read this.\"\n\nAline took the yellow slip of paper. \"A cable,\" added George. \"I\ngot it this morning--mailed on from my rooms in London. Read it.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to. It doesn't seem to make sense.\"\n\nGeorge laughed grimly.\n\n\"It makes sense all right.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can say that. 'Meredith elephant\nkangaroo--?'\"\n\n\"Office cipher; I was forgetting. 'Elephant' means 'Seriously ill\nand unable to attend to duty.' Meredith is one of the partners in\nmy firm in New York.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you think he is very sick? Are you very\nfond of Mr. Meredith?\"\n\n\"Meredith is a good fellow and I like him; but if it was simply a\nmatter of his being ill I'm afraid I could manage to bear up\nunder the news. Unfortunately 'kangaroo' means 'Return, without\nfail, by the next boat.'\"\n\n\"You must return by the next boat?\" Aline looked at him, in her\neyes a slow-growing comprehension of the situation. \"Oh!\" she\nsaid at length.\n\n\"I put it stronger than that,\" said George.\n\n\"But--the next boat---- That means on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Wednesday morning, from Southampton. I shall have to leave here\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAline's eyes were fixed on the blue hills across the valley, but\nshe did not see them. There was a mist between. She was feeling\ncrushed and ill-treated and lonely. It was as though George was\nalready gone and she left alone in an alien land.\n\n\"But, George!\" she said; she could find no other words for her\nprotest against the inevitable.\n\n\"It's bad luck,\" said Emerson quietly; \"but I shouldn't wonder if\nit is not the best thing that really could have happened. It\nfinishes me cleanly, instead of letting me drag on and make both\nof us miserable. If this cable hadn't come I suppose I should\nhave gone on bothering you up to the day of your wedding. I\nshould have fancied, to the last moment, that there was a chance\nfor me; but this ends me with one punch.\n\n\"Even I haven't the nerve to imagine that I can work a miracle in\nthe few hours before the train leaves to-morrow. I must just make\nthe best of it. If we ever meet again--and I don't see why we\nshould--you will be married. My particular brand of mental\nsuggestion doesn't work at long range. I shan't hope to influence\nyou by telepathy.\"\n\nHe leaned on the balustrade at her side and spoke in a low, level\nvoice.\n\n\"This thing,\" he said, \"coming as a shock, coming out of the blue\nsky without warning--Meredith is the last man in the world you\nwould expect to crack up; he looked as fit as a dray horse the\nlast time I saw him--somehow seems to have hammered a certain\namount of sense into me. Odd it never struck me before; but I\nsuppose I have been about the most bumptious, conceited fool that\never happened.\n\n\"Why I should have imagined that there was a sort of irresistible\nfascination in me, which was bound to make you break off your\nengagement and upset the whole universe simply to win the\nwonderful reward of marrying me, is more than I can understand. I\nsuppose it takes a shock to make a fellow see exactly what he\nreally amounts to. I couldn't think any more of you than I do;\nbut, if I could, the way you have put up with my mouthing and\nswaggering and posing as a sort of superman, would make me do it.\nYou have been wonderful!\"\n\nAline could not speak. She felt as though her whole world had\nbeen turned upside down in the last quarter of an hour. This was\na new George Emerson, a George at whom it was impossible to\nlaugh, but an insidiously attractive George. Her heart beat\nquickly. Her mind was not clear; but dimly she realized that he\nhad pulled down her chief barrier of defense and that she was\nmore open to attack than she had ever been. Obstinacy, the\nautomatic desire to resist the pressure of a will that attempted\nto overcome her own, had kept her cool and level-headed in the\npast. With masterfulness she had been able to cope. Humility was\nanother thing altogether.\n\nSoft-heartedness was Aline's weakness. She had never clearly\nrecognized it, but it had been partly pity that had induced her\nto accept Freddie; he had seemed so downtrodden and sorry for\nhimself during those Autumn days when they had first met.\nPrudence warned her that strange things might happen if once she\nallowed herself to pity George Emerson.\n\nThe silence lengthened. Aline could find nothing to say. In her\npresent mood there was danger in speech.\n\n\"We have known each other so long,\" said Emerson, \"and I have\ntold you so often that I love you, we have come to make almost a\njoke of it, as though we were playing some game. It just happens\nthat that is our way--to laugh at things; but I am going to say\nit once again, even though it has come to be a sort of catch\nphrase. I love you! I'm reconciled to the fact that I am done\nfor, out of the running, and that you are going to marry somebody\nelse; but I am not going to stop loving you.\n\n\"It isn't a question of whether I should be happier if I forgot\nyou. I can't do it. It's just an impossibility--and that's all\nthere is to it. Whatever I may be to you, you are part of me, and\nyou always will be part of me. I might just as well try to go on\nliving without breathing as living without loving you.\"\n\nHe stopped and straightened himself.\n\n\"That's all! I don't want to spoil a perfectly good Spring\nafternoon for you by pulling out the tragic stop. I had to say\nall that; but it's the last time. It shan't occur again. There\nwill be no tragedy when I step into the train to-morrow. Is there\nany chance that you might come and see me off?\"\n\nAline nodded.\n\n\"You will? That will be splendid! Now I'll go and pack and break\nit to my host that I must leave him. I expect, it will be news to\nhim to learn that I am here. I doubt if he knows me by sight.\"\n\nAline stood where he had left her, leaning on the balustrade. In\nthe fullness of time there came to her the recollection she had\npromised Freddie that shortly after luncheon she would sit with\nhim.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe Honorable Freddie, draped in purple pyjamas and propped up\nwith many pillows, was lying in bed, reading Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator. Aline's entrance occurred at a peculiarly poignant\nmoment in the story and gave him a feeling of having been brought\nviolently to earth from a flight in the clouds. It is not often\nan author has the good fortune to grip a reader as the author of\nGridley Quayle gripped Freddie.\n\nOne of the results of his absorbed mood was that he greeted Aline\nwith a stare of an even glassier quality than usual. His eyes\nwere by nature a trifle prominent; and to Aline, in the\noverstrung condition in which her talk with George Emerson had\nleft her, they seemed to bulge at her like a snail's. A man\nseldom looks his best in bed, and to Aline, seeing him for the\nfirst time at this disadvantage, the Honorable Freddie seemed\nquite repulsive. It was with a feeling of positive panic that she\nwondered whether he would want her to kiss him.\n\nFreddie made no such demand. He was not one of your demonstrative\nlovers. He contented himself with rolling over in bed and\ndropping his lower jaw.\n\n\"Hello, Aline!\"\n\nAline sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\n\"Well, Freddie?\"\n\nHer betrothed improved his appearance a little by hitching up his\njaw. As though feeling that would be too extreme a measure, he\ndid not close his mouth altogether; but he diminished the abyss.\nThe Honorable Freddie belonged to the class of persons who move\nthrough life with their mouths always restfully open.\n\nIt seemed to Aline that on this particular afternoon a strange\ndumbness had descended on her. She had been unable to speak to\nGeorge and now she could not think of anything to say to Freddie.\nShe looked at him and he looked at her; and the clock on the\nmantel-piece went on ticking.\n\n\"It was that bally cat of Aunt Ann's,\" said Freddie at length,\nessaying light conversation. \"It came legging it up the stairs\nand I took the most frightful toss. I hate cats! Do you hate\ncats? I knew a fellow in London who couldn't stand cats.\"\n\nAline began to wonder whether there was not something permanently\nwrong with her organs of speech. It should have been a simple\nmatter to develop the cat theme, but she found herself unable to\ndo so. Her mind was concentrated, to the exclusion of all else,\non the repellent nature of the spectacle provided by her loved\none in pyjamas. Freddie resumed the conversation.\n\n\"I was just reading a corking book. Have you ever read these\nthings? They come out every month, and they're corking. The\nfellow who writes them must be a corker. It beats me how he\nthinks of these things. They are about a detective--a chap called\nGridley Quayle. Frightfully exciting!\"\n\nAn obvious remedy for dumbness struck Aline.\n\n\"Shall I read to you, Freddie?\"\n\n\"Right-ho! Good scheme! I've got to the top of this page.\"\n\nAline took the paper-covered book.\n\n\"'Seven guns covered him with deadly precision.' Did you get as\nfar as that?\"\n\n\"Yes; just beyond. It's a bit thick, don't you know! This chappie\nQuayle has been trapped in a lonely house, thinking he was going\nto see a pal in distress; and instead of the pal there pop out a\nwhole squad of masked blighters with guns. I don't see how he's\ngoing to get out of it, myself; but I'll bet he does. He's a\ncorker!\"\n\nIf anybody could have pitied Aline more than she pitied herself,\nas she waded through the adventures of Mr. Quayle, it would have\nbeen Ashe Marson. He had writhed as he wrote the words and she\nwrithed as she read them. The Honorable Freddie also writhed, but\nwith tense excitement.\n\n\"What's the matter? Don't stop!\" he cried as Aline's voice\nceased.\n\n\"I'm getting hoarse, Freddie.\"\n\nFreddie hesitated. The desire to remain on the trail with Gridley\nstruggled with rudimentary politeness.\n\n\"How would it be--Would you mind if I just took a look at the\nrest of it myself? We could talk afterward, you know. I shan't be\nlong.\"\n\n\"Of course! Do read if you want to. But do you really like this\nsort of thing, Freddie?\"\n\n\"Me? Rather! Why--don't you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It seems a little--I don't know.\"\n\nFreddie had become absorbed in his story. Aline did not attempt\nfurther analysis of her attitude toward Mr. Quayle; she relapsed\ninto silence.\n\nIt was a silence pregnant with thought. For the first time in\ntheir relations, she was trying to visualize to herself exactly\nwhat marriage with this young man would mean. Hitherto, it struck\nher, she had really seen so little of Freddie that she had\nscarcely had a chance of examining him. In the crowded world\noutside he had always seemed a tolerable enough person. To-day,\nsomehow, he was different. Everything was different to-day.\n\nThis, she took it, was a fair sample of what she might expect\nafter marriage. Marriage meant--to come to essentials--that two\npeople were very often and for lengthy periods alone together,\ndependent on each other for mutual entertainment. What exactly\nwould it be like, being alone often and for lengthy periods with\nFreddie? Well, it would, she assumed, be like this.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Freddie without looking up. \"He did get\nout! He had a bomb on him, and he threatened to drop it and blow\nthe place to pieces unless the blighters let him go. So they\ncheesed it. I knew he had something up his sleeve.\"\n\nLike this! Aline drew a deep breath. It would be like\nthis--forever and ever and ever--until she died. She bent forward\nand stared at him.\n\n\"Freddie,\" she said, \"do you love me?\" There was no reply.\n\"Freddie, do you love me? Am I a part of you? If you hadn't me\nwould it be like trying to go on living without breathing?\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie raised a flushed face and gazed at her with\nan absent eye.\n\n\"Eh? What?\" he said. \"Do I--Oh; yes, rather! I say, one of the\nblighters has just loosed a rattlesnake into Gridley Quayle's\nbedroom through the transom!\"\n\nAline rose from her seat and left the room softly. The Honorable\nFreddie read on, unheeding.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAshe Marson had not fallen far short of the truth in his estimate\nof the probable effect on Mr. Peters of the information that his\nprecious scarab had once more been removed by alien hands and was\nnow farther from his grasp than ever. A drawback to success in\nlife is that failure, when it does come, acquires an exaggerated\nimportance. Success had made Mr. Peters, in certain aspects of\nhis character, a spoiled child.\n\nAt the moment when Ashe broke the news he would have parted with\nhalf his fortune to recover the scarab. Its recovery had become a\npoint of honor. He saw it as the prize of a contest between his\nwill and that of whatever malignant powers there might be ranged\nagainst him in the effort to show him that there were limits to\nwhat he could achieve. He felt as he had felt in the old days\nwhen people sneaked up on him in Wall Street and tried to loosen\nhis grip on a railroad or a pet stock. He was suffering from that\nform of paranoia which makes men multimillionaires. Nobody would\nbe foolish enough to become a multimillionaire if it were not for\nthe desire to prove himself irresistible.\n\nMr. Peters obtained a small relief for his feelings by doubling\nthe existing reward, and Ashe went off in search of Joan, hoping\nthat this new stimulus, acting on their joint brains, might\ndevelop inspiration.\n\n\"Have any fresh ideas been vouchsafed to you?\" he asked. \"You may\nlook on me as baffled.\"\n\nJoan shook her head.\n\n\"Don't give up,\" she urged. \"Think again. Try to realize what\nthis means, Mr. Marson. Between us we have lost ten thousand\ndollars in a single night. I can't afford it. It is like losing a\nlegacy. I absolutely refuse to give in without an effort and go\nback to writing duke-and-earl stories for Home Gossip.\"\n\n\"The prospect of tackling Gridley Quayle again--\"\n\n\"Why, I was forgetting that you were a writer of detective\nstories. You ought to be able to solve this mystery in a moment.\nAsk yourself, 'What would Gridley Quayle have done?'\"\n\n\"I can answer that. Gridley Quayle would have waited helplessly\nfor some coincidence to happen to help him out.\"\n\n\"Had he no methods?\"\n\n\"He was full of methods; but they never led him anywhere without\nthe coincidence. However, we might try to figure it out. What\ntime did you get to the museum?\"\n\n\"One o'clock.\"\n\n\"And you found the scarab gone. What does that suggest to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. What does it suggest to you?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing. Let us try again. Whoever took the scarab\nmust have had special information that Peters was offering the\nreward.\"\n\n\"Then why hasn't he been to Mr. Peters and claimed it?\"\n\n\"True! That would seem to be a flaw in the reasoning. Once again:\nWhoever took it must have been in urgent and immediate need of\nmoney.\"\n\n\"And how are we to find out who was in urgent and immediate need\nof money?\"\n\n\"Exactly! How indeed?\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I should think your Mr. Quayle must have been a great comfort to\nhis clients, wasn't he?\" said Joan.\n\n\"Inductive reasoning, I admit, seems to have fallen down to a\ncertain extent,\" said Ashe. \"We must wait for the coincidence. I\nhave a feeling that it will come.\" He paused. \"I am very\nfortunate in the way of coincidences.\"\n\n\"Are you?\"\n\nAshe looked about him and was relieved to find that they appeared\nto be out of earshot of their species. It was not easy to achieve\nthis position at the castle if you happened to be there as a\ndomestic servant. The space provided for the ladies and gentlemen\nattached to the guests was limited, and it was rarely that you\ncould enjoy a stroll without bumping into a maid, a valet or a\nfootman; but now they appeared to be alone. The drive leading to\nthe back regions of the castle was empty. As far as the eye could\nreach there were no signs of servants--upper or lower.\nNevertheless, Ashe lowered his voice.\n\n\"Was it not a strange coincidence,\" he said, \"that you should\nhave come into my life at all?\"\n\n\"Not very,\" said Joan prosaically. \"It was quite likely that we\nshould meet sooner or later, as we lived on different floors of\nthe same house.\"\n\n\"It was a coincidence that you should have taken that room.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nAshe felt damped. Logically, no doubt, she was right; but surely\nshe might have helped him out a little in this difficult\nsituation. Surely her woman's intuition should have told her that\na man who has been speaking in a loud and cheerful voice does\nnot lower it to a husky whisper without some reason. The\nhopelessness of his task began to weigh on him.\n\nEver since that evening at Market Blandings Station, when he\nrealized that he loved her, he had been trying to find an\nopportunity to tell her so; and every time they had met, the talk\nhad seemed to be drawn irresistibly into practical and\nunsentimental channels. And now, when he was doing his best to\nreason it out that they were twin souls who had been brought\ntogether by a destiny it would be foolish to struggle against;\nwhen he was trying to convey the impression that fate had designed\nthem for each other--she said, \"Why?\" It was hard.\n\nHe was about to go deeper into the matter when, from the\ndirection of the castle, he perceived the Honorable Freddie's\nvalet--Mr. Judson--approaching. That it was this repellent young\nman's object to break in on them and rob him of his one small\nchance of inducing Joan to appreciate, as he did, the mysterious\nworkings of Providence as they affected herself and him, was\nobvious. There was no mistaking the valet's desire for\nconversation. He had the air of one brimming over with speech.\nHis wonted indolence was cast aside; and as he drew nearer he\npositively ran. He was talking before he reached them.\n\n\"Miss Simpson, Mr. Marson, it's true--what I said that night.\nIt's a fact!\"\n\nAshe regarded the intruder with a malevolent eye. Never fond of\nMr. Judson, he looked on him now with positive loathing. It had\nnot been easy for him to work himself up to the point where he\ncould discuss with Joan the mysterious ways of Providence, for\nthere was that about her which made it hard to achieve sentiment.\nThat indefinable something in Joan Valentine which made for\nnocturnal raids on other people's museums also rendered her a\nsomewhat difficult person to talk to about twin souls and\ndestiny. The qualities that Ashe loved in her--her strength, her\ncapability, her valiant self-sufficingness--were the very\nqualities which seemed to check him when he tried to tell her\nthat he loved them.\n\nMr. Judson was still babbling.\n\n\"It's true. There ain't a doubt of it now. It's been and happened\njust as I said that night.\"\n\n\"What did you say? Which night?\" inquired Ashe.\n\n\"That night at dinner--the first night you two came here. Don't\nyou remember me talking about Freddie and the girl he used to\nwrite letters to in London--the girl I said was so like you, Miss\nSimpson? What was her name again? Joan Valentine. That was it.\nThe girl at the theater that Freddie used to send me with letters\nto pretty nearly every evening. Well, she's been and done it,\nsame as I told you all that night she was jolly likely to go and\ndo. She's sticking young Freddie up for his letters, just as he\nought to have known she would do if he hadn't been a young\nfathead. They're all alike, these girls--every one of them.\"\n\nMr. Judson paused, subjected the surrounding scenery to a\ncautious scrutiny and resumed.\n\n\"I took a suit of Freddie's clothes away to brush just now; and\nhappening\"--Mr. Judson paused and gave a little cough--\"happening\nto glance at the contents of his pockets I come across a letter.\nI took a sort of look at it before setting it aside, and it was\nfrom a fellow named Jones; and it said that this girl, Valentine,\nwas sticking onto young Freddie's letters what he'd written her,\nand would see him blowed if she parted with them under another\nthousand. And, as I made it out, Freddie had already given her\nfive hundred.\n\n\"Where he got it is more than I can understand; but that's what\nthe letter said. This fellow Jones said he had passed it to her\nwith his own hands; but she wasn't satisfied, and if she didn't\nget the other thousand she was going to bring an action for\nbreach. And now Freddie has given me a note to take to this\nJones, who is stopping in Market Blandings.\"\n\nJoan had listened to this remarkable speech with a stunned\namazement. At this point she made her first comment:\n\n\"But that can't be true.\"\n\n\"Saw the letter with my own eyes, Miss Simpson.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\nShe looked at Ashe helplessly. Their eyes met--hers wide with\nperplexity, his bright with the light of comprehension.\n\n\"It shows,\" said Ashe slowly, \"that he was in immediate and\nurgent need of money.\"\n\n\"You bet it does,\" said Mr. Judson with relish. \"It looks to me\nas though young Freddie had about reached the end of his tether\nthis time. My word! There won't half be a kick-up if she does sue\nhim for breach! I'm off to tell Mr. Beach and the rest. They'll\njump out of their skins.\" His face fell. \"Oh, Lord, I was\nforgetting this note. He told me to take it at once.\"\n\n\"I'll take it for you,\" said Ashe. \"I'm not doing anything.\"\n\nMr. Judson's gratitude was effusive.\n\n\"You're a good fellow, Marson,\" he said. \"I'll do as much for you\nanother time. I couldn't hardly bear not to tell a bit of news\nlike this right away. I should burst or something.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Judson, with shining face, hurried off to the\nhousekeeper's room.\n\n\"I simply can't understand it,\" said Joan at length. \"My head is\ngoing round.\"\n\n\"Can't understand it? Why, it's perfectly clear. This is the\ncoincidence for which, in my capacity of Gridley Quayle, I was\nwaiting. I can now resume inductive reasoning. Weighing the\nevidence, what do we find? That young sweep, Freddie, is the man.\nHe has the scarab.\"\n\n\"But it's all such a muddle. I'm not holding his letters.\"\n\n\"For Jones' purposes you are. Let's get this Jones element in the\naffair straightened out. What do you know of him?\"\n\n\"He was an enormously fat man who came to see me one night and\nsaid he had been sent to get back some letters. I told him I had\ndestroyed them ages ago and he went away.\"\n\n\"Well, that part of it is clear, then. He is working a simple but\ningenious game on Freddie. It wouldn't succeed with everybody, I\nsuppose; but from what I have seen and heard of him Freddie isn't\nstrong on intellect. He seems to have accepted the story without\na murmur. What does he do? He has to raise a thousand pounds\nimmediately, and the raising of the first five hundred has\nexhausted his credit. He gets the idea of stealing the scarab!\"\n\n\"But why? Why should he have thought of the scarab at all? That\nis what I can't understand. He couldn't have meant to give it to\nMr. Peters and claim the reward. He couldn't have known that Mr.\nPeters was offering a reward. He couldn't have known that Lord\nEmsworth had not got the scarab quite properly. He couldn't have\nknown--he couldn't have known anything!\"\n\nAshe's enthusiasm was a trifle damped.\n\n\"There's something in that. But--I have it! Jones must have known\nabout the scarab and told him.\"\n\n\"But how could he have known?\"\n\n\"Yes; there's something in that, too. How could Jones have\nknown?\"\n\n\"He couldn't. He had gone by the time Aline came that night.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand. Which night?\"\n\n\"It was the night of the day I first met you. I was wondering for\na moment whether he could by any chance have overheard Aline\ntelling me about the scarab and the reward Mr. Peters was\noffering for it.\"\n\n\"Overheard! That word is like a bugle blast to me. Nine out of\nten of Gridley Quayle's triumphs were due to his having overheard\nsomething. I think we are now on the right track.\"\n\n\"I don't. How could he have overheard us? The door was closed and\nhe was in the street by that time.\"\n\n\"How do you know he was in the street? Did you see him out?\"\n\n\"No; but he went.\"\n\n\"He might have waited on the stairs--you remember how dark they\nare at Number Seven--and listened.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nAshe reflected.\n\n\"Why? Why? What a beast of a word that is--the detective's\nbugbear. I thought I had it, until you said--Great Scott! I'll\ntell you why. I see it all. I have him with the goods. His object\nin coming to see you about the letters was because Freddie wanted\nthem back owing to his approaching marriage with Miss\nPeters--wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You tell him you have destroyed the letters. He goes off. Am I\nright?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Before he is out of the house Miss Peters is giving her name at\nthe front door. Put yourself in Jones' place. What does he think?\nHe is suspicious. He thinks there is some game on. He skips\nupstairs again, waits until Miss Peters has gone into your room,\nthen stands outside and listens. How about that?\"\n\n\"I do believe you are right. He might quite easily have done\nthat.\"\n\n\"He did do exactly that. I know it as though I had been there; in\nfact, it is highly probable I was there. You say all this\nhappened on the night we first met? I remember coming downstairs\nthat night--I was going out to a vaudeville show--and hearing\nvoices in your room. I remember it distinctly. In all probability\nI nearly ran into Jones.\"\n\n\"It does all seem to fit in, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It's a clear case. There isn't a flaw in it. The only question\nis, can I, on the evidence, go to young Freddie and choke the\nscarab out of him? On the whole, I think I had better take this\nnote to Jones, as I promised Judson, and see whether I can't work\nsomething through him. Yes; that's the best plan. I'll be\nstarting at once.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nPerhaps the greatest hardship in being an invalid is the fact\nthat people come and see you and keep your spirits up. The\nHonorable Freddie Threepwood suffered extremely from this. His\nwas not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain\npowers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors.\nAll he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of\nGridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his back\nand look at the ceiling and think of nothing.\n\nIt is your dynamic person, your energetic world's worker, who\nchafes at being laid up with a sprained ankle. The Honorable\nFreddie enjoyed it. From boyhood up he had loved lying in bed;\nand now that fate had allowed him to do this without incurring\nrebuke he objected to having his reveries broken up by officious\nrelations.\n\nHe spent his rare intervals of solitude in trying to decide in\nhis mind which of his cousins, uncles and aunts was, all things\nconsidered, the greatest nuisance. Sometimes he would give the\npalm to Colonel Horace Mant, who struck the soldierly note--\"I\nrecollect in a hill campaign in the winter of the year '93 giving\nmy ankle the deuce of a twist.\" Anon the more spiritual attitude\nof the Bishop of Godalming seemed to annoy him more keenly.\n\nSometimes he would head the list with the name of his Cousin\nPercy--Lord Stockheath--who refused to talk of anything except\nhis late breach-of-promise case and the effect the verdict had\nhad on his old governor. Freddie was in no mood just now to be\nsympathetic with others on their breach-of-promise cases.\n\nAs he lay in bed reading on Monday morning, the only flaw in his\nenjoyment of this unaccustomed solitude was the thought that\npresently the door was bound to open and some kind inquirer\ninsinuate himself into the room.\n\nHis apprehensions proved well founded. Scarcely had he got well\ninto the details of an ingenious plot on the part of a secret\nsociety to eliminate Gridley Quayle by bribing his cook--a bad\nlot--to sprinkle chopped-up horsehair in his chicken fricassee,\nwhen the door-knob turned and Ashe Marson came in.\n\nFreddie was not the only person who had found the influx of\nvisitors into the sick room a source of irritation. The fact that\nthe invalid seemed unable to get a moment to himself had annoyed\nAshe considerably. For some little time he had hung about the\npassage in which Freddie's room was situated, full of enterprise,\nbut unable to make a forward move owing to the throng of\nsympathizers. What he had to say to the sufferer could not be\nsaid in the presence of a third party.\n\nFreddie's sensation, on perceiving him, was one of relief. He had\nbeen half afraid it was the bishop. He recognized Ashe as the\nvalet chappie who had helped him to bed on the occasion of his\naccident. It might be that he had come in a respectful way to\nmake inquiries, but he was not likely to stop long. He nodded and\nwent on reading. And then, glancing up, he perceived Ashe\nstanding beside the bed, fixing him with a piercing stare.\n\nThe Honorable Freddie hated piercing stares. One of the reasons\nwhy he objected to being left alone with his future\nfather-in-law, Mr. J. Preston Peters, was that Nature had given\nthe millionaire a penetrating pair of eyes, and the stress of\nbusiness life in New York had developed in him a habit of boring\nholes in people with them. A young man had to have a stronger\nnerve and a clearer conscience than the Honorable Freddie to\nenjoy a tete-a-tete with Mr. Peters.\n\nThough he accepted Aline's father as a necessary evil and\nrecognized that his position entitled him to look at people as\nsharply as he liked, whatever their feelings, he would be hanged\nif he was going to extend this privilege to Mr. Peters' valet.\nThis man standing beside him was giving him a look that seemed to\nhis sensitive imagination to have been fired red-hot from a gun;\nand this annoyed and exasperated Freddie.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he said querulously. \"What are you staring at\nme like that for?\"\n\nAshe sat down, leaned his elbows on the bed, and applied the look\nagain from a lower elevation.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said.\n\nWhatever may have been Ashe's defects, so far as the handling of\nthe inductive-reasoning side of Gridley Quayle's character was\nconcerned, there was one scene in each of his stories in which he\nnever failed. That was the scene in the last chapter where\nQuayle, confronting his quarry, unmasked him. Quayle might have\nfloundered in the earlier part of the story, but in his big scene\nhe was exactly right. He was curt, crisp and mercilessly\ncompelling.\n\nAshe, rehearsing this interview in the passage before his entry,\nhad decided that he could hardly do better than model himself on\nthe detective. So he began to be curt, crisp and mercilessly\ncompelling to Freddie; and after the first few sentences he had\nthat youth gasping for air.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" he said. \"If you can spare me a few moments of\nyour valuable time I will put the facts before you. Yes; press\nthat bell if you wish--and I will put them before witnesses. Lord\nEmsworth will no doubt be pleased to learn that his son, whom he\ntrusted, is a thief!\"\n\nFreddie's hand fell limply. The bell remained un-touched. His\nmouth opened to its fullest extent. In the midst of his panic he\nhad a curious feeling that he had heard or read that last\nsentence somewhere before. Then he remembered. Those very words\noccurred in Gridley Quayle, Investigator--The Adventure of the\nBlue Ruby.\n\n\"What--what do you mean?\" he stammered.\n\n\"I will tell you what I mean. On Saturday night a valuable scarab\nwas stolen from Lord Emsworth's private museum. The case was put\ninto my hands----\"\n\n\"Great Scott! Are you a detective?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ashe.\n\nLife, as many a worthy writer has pointed out, is full of\nironies. It seemed to Freddie that here was a supreme example of\nthis fact. All these years he had wanted to meet a detective; and\nnow that his wish had been gratified the detective was detecting\nhim!\n\n\"The case,\" continued Ashe severely, \"was placed in my hands. I\ninvestigated it. I discovered that you were in urgent and\nimmediate need of money.\"\n\n\"How on earth did you do that?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ashe. \"I further discovered that you were in\ncommunication with an individual named Jones.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! How?\"\n\nAshe smiled quietly.\n\n\"Yesterday I had a talk with this man Jones, who is staying in\nMarket Blandings. Why is he staying in Market Blandings? Because\nhe had a reason for keeping in touch with you; because you were\nabout to transfer to his care something you could get possession\nof, but which only he could dispose of--the scarab.\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie was beyond speech. He made no comment on\nthis statement. Ashe continued:\n\n\"I interviewed this man Jones. I said to him: 'I am in the\nHonorable Frederick Threepwood's confidence. I know everything.\nHave you any instructions for me?' He replied: 'What do you\nknow?' I answered: 'I know that the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood has something he wishes to hand to you, but which he\nhas been unable to hand to you owing to having had an accident\nand being confined to his room.' He then told me to tell you to\nlet him have the scarab by messenger.\"\n\nFreddie pulled himself together with an effort. He was in sore\nstraits, but he saw one last chance. His researches in detective\nfiction had given him the knowledge that detectives occasionally\nrelaxed their austerity when dealing with a deserving case. Even\nGridley Quayle could sometimes be softened by a hard-luck story.\nFreddie could recall half a dozen times when a detected criminal\nhad been spared by him because he had done it all from the best\nmotives. He determined to throw himself on Ashe's mercy.\n\n\"I say, you know,\" he said ingratiatingly, \"I think it's bally\nmarvelous the way you've deduced everything, and so on.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"But I believe you would chuck it if you heard my side of the\ncase.\"\n\n\"I know your side of the case. You think you are being\nblackmailed by a Miss Valentine for some letters you once wrote\nher. You are not. Miss Valentine has destroyed the letters. She\ntold the man Jones so when he went to see her in London. He kept\nyour five hundred pounds and is trying to get another thousand\nout of you under false pretenses.\"\n\n\"What? You can't be right.\"\n\n\"I am always right.\"\n\n\"You must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"I am never mistaken.\"\n\n\"But how do you know?\"\n\n\"I have my sources of information.\"\n\n\"She isn't going to sue me for breach of promise?\"\n\n\"She never had any intention of doing so.\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie sank back on the pillows.\n\n\"Good egg!\" he said with fervor. He beamed happily. \"This,\" he\nobserved, \"is a bit of all right.\"\n\nFor a space relief held him dumb. Then another aspect of the\nmatter struck him, and he sat up again with a jerk.\n\n\"I say, you don't mean to say that that rotter Jones was such a\nrotter as to do a rotten thing like that?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nFreddie grew plaintive.\n\n\"I trusted that man,\" he said. \"I jolly well trusted him\nabsolutely.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Ashe. \"There is one born every minute.\"\n\n\"But\"--the thing seemed to be filtering slowly into Freddie's\nintelligence \"what I mean to say is, I--I--thought he was such a\ngood chap.\"\n\n\"My short acquaintance with Mr. Jones,\" said Ashe \"leads me to\nthink that he probably is--to himself.\"\n\n\"I won't have anything more to do with him.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Dash it, I'll tell you what I'll do. The very next time I meet\nthe blighter, I'll cut him dead. I will! The rotter! Five hundred\nquid he's had off me for nothing! And, if it hadn't been for you,\nhe'd have had another thousand! I'm beginning to think that my\nold governor wasn't so far wrong when he used to curse me for\ngoing around with Jones and the rest of that crowd. He knew a\nbit, by Gad! Well, I'm through with them. If the governor ever\nlets me go to London again, I won't have anything to do with\nthem. I'll jolly well cut the whole bunch! And to think that, if\nit hadn't been for you . . .\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" said Ashe. \"Give me the scarab. Where is it?\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\"Restore it to its rightful owner.\"\n\n\"Are you going to give me away to the governor?\"\n\n\"I am not.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" said Freddie gratefully, \"that you are a dashed\ngood sort. You seem to me to have the making of an absolute\ntopper! It's under the mattress. I had it on me when I fell\ndownstairs and I had to shove it in there.\"\n\nAshe drew it out. He stood looking at it, absorbed. He could\nhardly believe his quest was at an end and that a small fortune\nlay in the palm of his hand. Freddie was eyeing him admiringly.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I've always wanted to meet a detective.\nWhat beats me is how you chappies find out things.\"\n\n\"We have our methods.\"\n\n\"I believe you. You're a blooming marvel! What first put you on\nmy track?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Ashe, \"would take too long to explain. Of course I\nhad to do some tense inductive reasoning; but I cannot trace\nevery link in the chain for you. It would be tedious.\"\n\n\"Not to me.\"\n\n\"Some other time.\"\n\n\"I say, I wonder whether you've ever read any of these\nthings--these Gridley Quayle stories? I know them by heart.\"\n\nWith the scarab safely in his pocket, Ashe could contemplate the\nbrightly-colored volume the other extended toward him without\nactive repulsion. Already he was beginning to feel a sort of\nsentiment for the depressing Quayle, as something that had once\nformed part of his life.\n\n\"Do you read these things?\"\n\n\"I should say not. I write them.\"\n\nThere are certain supreme moments that cannot be adequately\ndescribed. Freddie's appreciation of the fact that such a moment\nhad occurred in his life expressed itself in a startled cry and a\nconvulsive movement of all his limbs. He shot up from the pillows\nand gaped at Ashe.\n\n\"You write them? You don't mean, write them!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\"\n\nHe would have gone on, doubtless, to say more; but at this moment\nvoices made themselves heard outside the door. There was a\nmovement of feet. Then the door opened and a small procession\nentered.\n\nIt was headed by the Earl of Emsworth. Following him came Mr.\nPeters. And in the wake of the millionaire were Colonel Horace\nMant and the Efficient Baxter. They filed into the room and stood\nby the bedside. Ashe seized the opportunity to slip out.\n\nFreddie glanced at the deputation without interest. His mind was\noccupied with other matters. He supposed they had come to inquire\nafter his ankle and he was mildly thankful that they had come in\na body instead of one by one. The deputation grouped itself about\nthe bed and shuffled its feet. There was an atmosphere of\nawkwardness.\n\n\"Er--Frederick!\" said Lord Emsworth. \"Freddie, my boy!\"\n\nMr. Peters fiddled dumbly with the coverlet. Colonel Mant cleared\nhis throat. The Efficient Baxter scowled. \"Er--Freddie, my dear\nboy, I fear we have a painful--er--task to perform.\"\n\nThe words struck straight home at the Honorable Freddie's guilty\nconscience. Had they, too, tracked him down? And was he now to be\naccused of having stolen that infernal scarab? A wave of relief\nswept over him as he realized that he had got rid of the thing. A\ndecent chappie like that detective would not give him away. All\nhe had to do was to keep his head and stick to stout denial. That\nwas the game--stout denial.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" he said defensively.\n\n\"Of course you don't--dash it!\" said Colonel Mant. \"We're coming\nto that. And I should like to begin by saying that, though in a\nsense it was my fault, I fail to see how I could have acted---\"\n\n\"Horace!\"\n\n\"Oh, very well! I was only trying to explain.\"\n\nLord Emsworth adjusted his pince-nez and sought inspiration from\nthe wall paper.\n\n\"Freddie, my boy,\" he began, \"we have a somewhat unpleasant--a\nsomewhat er--disturbing--We are compelled to break it to you. We\nare all most pained and astounded; and--\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter spoke. It was plain he was in a bad temper.\n\n\"Miss Peters,\" he snapped, \"has eloped with your friend Emerson.\"\n\nLord Emsworth breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Exactly, Baxter. Precisely! You have put the thing in a\nnutshell. Really, my dear fellow, you are invaluable.\"\n\nAll eyes searched Freddie's face for signs of uncontrollable\nemotion. The deputation waited anxiously for his first\ngrief-stricken cry.\n\n\"Eh? What?\" said Freddie.\n\n\"It is quite true, Freddie, my dear boy. She went to London with\nhim on the ten-fifty.\"\n\n\"And if I had not been forcibly restrained,\" said Baxter acidly,\ncasting a vindictive look at Colonel Mant, \"I could have\nprevented it.\"\n\nColonel Mant cleared his throat again and put a hand to his\nmustache.\n\n\"I'm afraid that is true, Freddie. It was a most unfortunate\nmisunderstanding. I'll tell you how it happened: I chanced to be\nat the station bookstall when the train came in. Mr. Baxter was\nalso in the station. The train pulled up and this young fellow\nEmerson got in--said good-by to us, don't you know, and got in.\nJust as the train was about to start, Miss Peters exclaiming,\n'George dear, I'm going with you---, dash it,' or some such\nspeech--proceeded to go--hell for leather--to the door of young\nEmerson's compartment. On which---\"\n\n\"On which,\" interrupted Baxter, \"I made a spring to try and catch\nher. Apart from any other consideration, the train was already\nmoving and Miss Peters ran considerable risk of injury. I had\nhardly moved when I felt a violent jerk at my ankle and fell to\nthe ground. After I had recovered from the shock, which was not\nimmediately, I found--\"\n\n\"The fact is, Freddie, my boy,\" the colonel went on, \"I acted\nunder a misapprehension. Nobody can be sorrier for the mistake\nthan I; but recent events in this house had left me with the\nimpression that Mr. Baxter here was not quite responsible for his\nactions--overwork or something, I imagined. I have seen it happen\nso often in India, don't you know, where fellows run amuck and\nkick up the deuce's own delight. I am bound to admit that I have\nbeen watching Mr. Baxter rather closely lately in the expectation\nthat something of this very kind might happen.\n\n\"Of course I now realize my mistake; and I have apologized--\napologized humbly--dash it! But at the moment I was firmly under\nthe impression that our friend here had an attack of some kind\nand was about to inflict injuries on Miss Peters. If I've seen it\nhappen once in India, I've seen it happen a dozen times.\n\n\"I recollect, in the hot weather of the year '99---or was it\n'93?--I think '93---one of my native bearers--However, I sprang\nforward and caught the crook of my walking stick on Mr. Baxter's\nankle and brought him down. And by the time explanations were\nmade it was too late. The train had gone, with Miss Peters in\nit.\"\n\n\"And a telegram has just arrived,\" said Lord Emsworth, \"to say\nthat they are being married this afternoon at a registrar's. The\nwhole occurrence is most disturbing.\"\n\n\"Bear it like a man, my boy!\" urged Colonel Mant.\n\nTo all appearances Freddie was bearing it magnificently. Not a\nsingle exclamation, either of wrath or pain, had escaped his\nlips. One would have said the shock had stunned him or that he\nhad not heard, for his face expressed no emotion whatever.\n\nThe fact was, the story had made very little impression on the\nHonorable Freddie of any sort. His relief at Ashe's news about\nJoan Valentine; the stunning joy of having met in the flesh the\nauthor of the adventures of Gridley Quayle; the general feeling\nthat all was now right with the world--these things deprived him\nof the ability to be greatly distressed.\n\nAnd there was a distinct feeling of relief--actual relief--that\nnow it would not be necessary for him to get married. He had\nliked Aline; but whenever he really thought of it the prospect of\ngetting married rather appalled him. A chappie looked such an ass\ngetting married! It appeared, however, that some verbal comment\non the state of affairs was required of him. He searched his mind\nfor something adequate.\n\n\"You mean to say Aline has bolted with Emerson?\"\n\nThe deputation nodded pained nods. Freddie searched in his mind\nagain. The deputation held its breath.\n\n\"Well, I'm blowed!\" said Freddie. \"Fancy that!\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nMr. Peters walked heavily into his room. Ashe Marson was waiting\nfor him there. He eyed Ashe dully.\n\n\"Pack!\" he said.\n\n\"Pack?\"\n\n\"Pack! We're getting out of here by the afternoon train.\"\n\n\"Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"My daughter has eloped with Emerson.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Don't stand there saying, 'What!' Pack.\"\n\nAshe put his hand in his pocket.\n\n\"Where shall I put this?\" he asked.\n\nFor a moment Mr. Peters looked without comprehension at what Ashe\nwas holding out; then his whole demeanor altered. His eyes lit\nup. He uttered a howl of pure rapture:\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\n\"I got it.\"\n\n\"Where was it? Who took it? How did you choke it out of them?\nHow did you find it? Who had it?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I ought to say. I don't want to start\nanything. You won't tell anyone?\"\n\n\"Tell anyone! What do you take me for? Do you think I am going\nabout advertising this? If I can sneak out without that fellow\nBaxter jumping on my back I shall be satisfied. You can take it\nfrom me that there won't be any sensational exposures if I can\nhelp it. Who had it?\"\n\n\"Young Threepwood.\"\n\n\"Threepwood? Why did he want it?\"\n\n\"He needed money and he was going to raise it on--\"\n\nMr. Peters exploded.\n\n\"And I have been kicking because Aline can't marry him and has\ngone off with a regular fellow like young Emerson! He's a good\nboy--young Emerson. I knew his folks. He'll make a name for\nhimself one of these days. He's got get-up in him. And I have\nbeen waiting to shoot him because he has taken Aline away from\nthat goggle-eyed chump up in bed there!\n\n\"Why, if she had married Threepwood I should have had\ngrandchildren who would have sneaked my watch while I was dancing\nthem on my knee! There is a taint of some sort in the whole\nfamily. Father sneaks my Cheops and sonny sneaks it from father.\nWhat a gang! And the best blood in England! If that's England's\nidea of good blood give me Hoboken! This settles it. I was a\nchump ever to come to a country like this. Property isn't safe\nhere. I'm going back to America on the next boat.\n\n\"Where's my check book? I'm going to write you that check right\naway. You've earned it. Listen, young man; I don't know what your\nideas are, but if you aren't chained to this country I'll make it\nworth your while to stay on with me. They say no one's\nindispensable, but you come mighty near it. If I had you at my\nelbow for a few years I'd get right back into shape. I'm feeling\nbetter now than I have felt in years--and you've only just\nstarted in on me.\n\n\"How about it? You can call yourself what you like--secretary or\ntrainer, or whatever suits you best. What you will be is the\nfellow who makes me take exercise and stop smoking cigars, and\ngenerally looks after me. How do you feel about it?\"\n\nIt was a proposition that appealed both to Ashe's commercial and\nto his missionary instincts. His only regret had been that, the\nscarab recovered, he and Mr. Peters would now, he supposed, part\ncompany. He had not liked the idea of sending the millionaire\nback to the world a half-cured man. Already he had begun to look\non him in the light of a piece of creative work to which he had\njust set his hand.\n\nBut the thought of Joan gave him pause. If this meant separation\nfrom Joan it was not to be considered.\n\n\"Let me think it over,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, think quick!\" said Mr. Peters.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIt has been said by those who have been through fires,\nearthquakes and shipwrecks that in such times of stress the\nsocial barriers are temporarily broken down, and the spectacle\nmay be seen of persons of the highest social standing speaking\nquite freely to persons who are not in society at all; and of\nquite nice people addressing others to whom they have never been\nintroduced. The news of Aline Peters' elopement with George\nEmerson, carried beyond the green-baize door by Slingsby, the\nchauffeur, produced very much the same state of affairs in the\nservants' quarters at Blandings Castle.\n\nIt was not only that Slingsby was permitted to penetrate into the\nhousekeeper's room and tell his story to his social superiors\nthere, though that was an absolutely unprecedented occurrence;\nwhat was really extraordinary was that mere menials discussed the\naffair with the personal ladies and gentlemen of the castle\nguests, and were allowed to do so uncrushed. James, the\nfootman--that pushing individual--actually shoved his way into\nthe room, and was heard by witnesses to remark to no less a\nperson than Mr. Beach that it was a bit thick.\n\nAnd it is on record that his fellow footman, Alfred, meeting the\ngroom of the chambers in the passage outside, positively prodded\nhim in the lower ribs, winked, and said: \"What a day we're\nhaving!\" One has to go back to the worst excesses of the French\nRevolution to parallel these outrages. It was held by Mr. Beach\nand Mrs. Twemlow afterward that the social fabric of the castle\nnever fully recovered from this upheaval. It may be they took an\nextreme view of the matter, but it cannot be denied that it\nwrought changes. The rise of Slingsby is a case in point. Until\nthis affair took place the chauffeur's standing had never been\nsatisfactorily settled. Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow led the party\nwhich considered that he was merely a species of coachman; but\nthere was a smaller group which, dazzled by Slingsby's\npersonality, openly declared it was not right that he should take\nhis meals in the servants' hall with such admitted plebeians as\nthe odd man and the steward's-room footman.\n\nThe Aline-George elopement settled the point once and for all.\nSlingsby had carried George's bag to the train. Slingsby had been\nstanding a few yards from the spot where Aline began her dash for\nthe carriage door. Slingsby was able to exhibit the actual half\nsovereign with which George had tipped him only five minutes\nbefore the great event. To send such a public man back to the\nservants' hall was impossible. By unspoken consent the chauffeur\ndined that night in the steward's room, from which he was never\ndislodged.\n\nMr. Judson alone stood apart from the throng that clustered about\nthe chauffeur. He was suffering the bitterness of the supplanted.\nA brief while before and he had been the central figure, with his\nstory of the letter he had found in the Honorable Freddie's coat\npocket. Now the importance of his story had been engulfed in that\nof this later and greater sensation, Mr. Judson was learning, for\nthe first time, on what unstable foundations popularity stands.\n\nJoan was nowhere to be seen. In none of the spots where she might\nhave been expected to be at such a time was she to be found. Ashe\nhad almost given up the search when, going to the back door and\nlooking out as a last chance, he perceived her walking slowly on\nthe gravel drive.\n\nShe greeted Ashe with a smile, but something was plainly\ntroubling her. She did not speak for a moment and they walked\nside by side.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Ashe at length. \"What is the matter?\"\n\nShe looked at him gravely.\n\n\"Gloom,\" she said. \"Despondency, Mr. Marson--A sort of flat\nfeeling. Don't you hate things happening?\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"Well, this affair of Aline, for instance. It's so big it makes\none feel as though the whole world had altered. I should like\nnothing to happen ever, and life just to jog peacefully along.\nThat's not the gospel I preached to you in Arundell Street, is it!\nI thought I was an advanced apostle of action; but I seem to have\nchanged. I'm afraid I shall never be able to make clear what I do\nmean. I only know I feel as though I have suddenly grown old.\nThese things are such milestones. Already I am beginning to look\non the time before Aline behaved so sensationally as terribly\nremote. To-morrow it will be worse, and the day after that worse\nstill. I can see that you don't in the least understand what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Yes; I do--or I think I do. What it comes to, in a few words, is\nthat somebody you were fond of has gone out of your life. Is that\nit?\"\n\nJoan nodded.\n\n\"Yes--at least, that is partly it. I didn't really know Aline\nparticularly well, beyond having been at school with her, but\nyou're right. It's not so much what has happened as what it\nrepresents that matters. This elopement has marked the end of a\nphase of my life. I think I have it now. My life has been such a\nseries of jerks. I dash along--then something happens which stops\nthat bit of my life with a jerk; and then I have to start over\nagain--a new bit. I think I'm getting tired of jerks. I want\nsomething stodgy and continuous.\n\n\"I'm like one of the old bus horses that could go on forever if\npeople got off without making them stop. It's the having to get\nthe bus moving again that wears one out. This little section of\nmy life since we came here is over, and it is finished for good.\nI've got to start the bus going again on a new road and with a\nnew set of passengers. I wonder whether the old horses used to be\nsorry when they dropped one lot of passengers and took on a lot\nof strangers?\"\n\nA sudden dryness invaded Ashe's throat. He tried to speak, but\nfound no words. Joan went on:\n\n\"Do you ever get moods when life seems absolutely meaningless?\nIt's like a badly-constructed story, with all sorts of characters\nmoving in and out who have nothing to do with the plot. And when\nsomebody comes along that you think really has something to do\nwith the plot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you begin to\nwonder what the story is about, and you feel that it's about\nnothing--just a jumble.\"\n\n\"There is one thing,\" said Ashe, \"that knits it together.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The love interest.\"\n\nTheir eyes met and suddenly there descended on Ashe confidence.\nHe felt cool and alert, sure of himself, as in the old days he\nhad felt when he ran races and, the nerve-racking hours of\nwaiting past, he listened for the starter's gun. Subconsciously\nhe was aware he had always been a little afraid of Joan, and that\nnow he was no longer afraid.\n\n\"Joan, will you marry me?\"\n\nHer eyes wandered from his face. He waited.\n\n\"I wonder!\" she said softly. \"You think that is the solution?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How can you tell?\" she broke out. \"We scarcely know each other.\nI shan't always be in this mood. I may get restless again. I may\nfind it is the jerks that I really like.\"\n\n\"You won't!\"\n\n\"You're very confident.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely confident.\"\n\n\"'She travels fastest who travels alone,'\" misquoted Joan.\n\n\"What is the good,\" said Ashe, \"of traveling fast if you're going\nround in a circle? I know how you feel. I've felt the same\nmyself. You are an individualist. You think there is something\ntremendous just round the corner and that you can get it if you\ntry hard enough. There isn't--or if there is it isn't worth\ngetting. Life is nothing but a mutual aid association. I am going\nto help old Peters--you are going to help me--I am going to help\nyou.\"\n\n\"Help me to do what?\"\n\n\"Make life coherent instead of a jumble.\"\n\n\"Mr. Marson---\"\n\n\"Don't call me Mr. Marson.\"\n\n\"Ashe, you don't know what you are doing. You don't know me.\nI've been knocking about the world for five years and I'm\nhard--hard right through. I should make you wretched.\"\n\n\"You are not in the least hard--and you know it. Listen to me,\nJoan. Where's your sense of fairness? You crash into my life,\nturn it upside down, dig me out of my quiet groove, revolutionize\nmy whole existence; and now you propose to drop me and pay no\nfurther attention to me. Is it fair?\"\n\n\"But I don't. We shall always be the best of friends.\"\n\n\"We shall--but we will get married first.\"\n\n\"You are determined?\"\n\n\"I am!\"\n\nJoan laughed happily.\n\n\"How perfectly splendid! I was terrified lest I might have made\nyou change your mind. I had to say all I did to preserve my\nself-respect after proposing to you. Yes; I did. How strange it\nis that men never seem to understand a woman, however plainly she\ntalks! You don't think I was really worrying because I had lost\nAline, do you? I thought I was going to lose you, and it made me\nmiserable. You couldn't expect me to say it in so many words; but\nI thought--I was hoping--you guessed. I practically said it.\nAshe! What are you doing?\"\n\nAshe paused for a moment to reply.\n\n\"I am kissing you,\" he said.\n\n\"But you mustn't! There's a scullery maid or somebody looking\nthrough the kitchen window. She will see us.\"\n\nAshe drew her to him.\n\n\"Scullery maids have few pleasures,\" he said. \"Theirs is a dull\nlife. Let her see us.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth sat by the sick bed and regarded the\nHonorable Freddie almost tenderly.\n\n\"I fear, Freddie, my dear boy, this has been a great shock to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Eh? What? Yes--rather! Deuce of a shock, gov'nor.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking it over, my boy, and perhaps I have been a\nlittle hard on you. When your ankle is better I have decided to\nrenew your allowance; and you may return to London, as you do not\nseem happy in the country. Though how any reasonable being can\nprefer--\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie started, pop-eyed, to a sitting posture.\n\n\"My word! Not really?\"\n\nHis father nodded.\n\n\"I say, gov'nor, you really are a topper! You really are, you\nknow! I know just how you feel about the country and the jolly\nold birds and trees and chasing the bally slugs off the young\ngeraniums and all that sort of thing, but somehow it's never\nquite hit me the same way. It's the way I'm built, I suppose. I\nlike asphalt streets and crowds and dodging taxis and meeting\nchappies at the club and popping in at the Empire for half an\nhour and so forth. And there's something about having an\nallowance--I don't know . . . sort of makes you chuck your chest\nout and feel you're someone. I don't know how to thank you,\ngov'nor! You're--you're an absolute sportsman! This is the most\npriceless bit of work you've ever done. I feel like a\ntwo-year-old. I don't know when I've felt so braced.\nI--I--really, you know, gov'nor, I'm most awfully grateful.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lord Emsworth. \"Ah--precisely. But, Freddie, my\nboy,\" he added, not without pathos, \"there is just one thing\nmore. Do you think that--with an effort--for my sake--you could\nendeavor this time not to make a--a damned fool of yourself?\"\n\nHe eyed his offspring wistfully.\n\n\"Gov'nor,\" said the Honorable Freddie firmly, \"I'll have a jolly\ngood stab at it!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Something New, by P.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1011,"split":"train"}
