{"ori_id":"d77afdf7d65249464b16a9643ff88ce36f6ef781","title":"Paradise Lost","context":"Paradise Lost\n The poem is separated into twelve \"books\" or sections, the lengths of which vary greatly (the longest is Book IX, with 1,189 lines, and the shortest Book VII, with 640). The Arguments at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition. Originally published in ten books, a fully \"Revised and Augmented\" edition reorganized into twelve books was issued in 1674, and this is the edition generally used today.\nThe poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res (Latin for in the midst of things), the background story being recounted later.\nMilton's story has two narrative arcs, one about Satan (Lucifer) and the other following Adam and Eve. It begins after Satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or, as it is also called in the poem, Tartarus. In Pand\u0102\u015amonium, Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers; he is aided by Mammon and Beelzebub. Belial and Moloch are also present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to poison the newly created Earth and God's new and most favoured creation, Mankind. He braves the dangers of the Abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus or Aeneas. After an arduous traversal of the Chaos outside Hell, he enters God's new material World, and later the Garden of Eden.\nAt several points in the poem, an Angelic War over Heaven is recounted from different perspectives. Satan's rebellion follows the epic convention of large-scale warfare. The battles between the faithful angels and Satan's forces take place over three days. At the final battle, the Son of God single-handedly defeats the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishes them from Heaven. Following this purge, God creates the World, culminating in his creation of Adam and Eve. While God gave Adam and Eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation, he gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death.\nThe story of Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented for the first time in Christian literature as having a full relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another \u00e2\u0080\u0092 if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong.\nAfter eating the fruit, Adam and Eve have lustful sex. At first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience guilt and shame for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination.\nMeanwhile, Satan returns triumphantly to Hell, amidst the praise of his fellow fallen angels. He tells them about how their scheme worked and human kind has fallen, giving them complete dominion over Paradise. As he finishes his speech, however, the fallen angels around him become hideous snakes, and soon enough, Satan himself turned into a snake, deprived of limbs and unable to talk. Thus, they share the same punishment, as they shared the same guilt.\nEve appeals to Adam for reconciliation of their actions. Her encouragement enables them to approach God, and sue for grace, bowing on suppliant knee, to receive forgiveness. In a vision shown to him by the angel Michael, Adam witnesses everything that will happen to mankind until the Great Flood. Adam is very upset by this vision of the future, so Michael also tells him about humankind's potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls \"King Messiah\").\nAdam and Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find \"a paradise within thee, happier far\". Adam and Eve also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden).\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Paradise Lost, by John Milton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Him the Almighty Power\n  Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie\n  With hideous ruine and combustion down\n  To bottomless perdition, there to dwell\n  In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,\n  Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.\n  Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night\n  To mortal men, he with his horrid crew\n  Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe\n  Confounded though immortal: But his doom\n  Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought\n  Both of lost happiness and lasting pain\n  Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes\n  That witness'd huge affliction and dismay\n  Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:\n  At once as far as Angels kenn he views\n  The dismal Situation waste and wilde,\n  A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round\n  As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames\n  No light, but rather darkness visible\n  Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,\n  Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\n  And rest can never dwell, hope never comes\n  That comes to all; but torture without end\n  Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed\n  With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:\n  Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd\n  For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd\n  In utter darkness, and their portion set\n  As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n\n  As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.\n  O how unlike the place from whence they fell!\n  There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd\n  With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,\n  He soon discerns, and weltring by his side\n  One next himself in power, and next in crime,\n  Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd\n  BEELZEBUB.  To whom th' Arch-Enemy,\n  And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words\n  Breaking the horrid silence thus began.\n\n    If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd\n  From him, who in the happy Realms of Light\n  Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine\n  Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,\n  United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,\n  And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,\n  Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd\n  In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest\n  From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd\n  He with his Thunder: and till then who knew\n  The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those\n  Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage\n  Can else inflict do I repent or change,\n  Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind\n  And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,\n  That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,\n  And to the fierce contention brought along\n  Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd\n  That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,\n  His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd\n  In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,\n  And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?\n  All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\n  And study of revenge, immortal hate,\n  And courage never to submit or yield:\n  And what is else not to be overcome?\n  That Glory never shall his wrath or might\n  Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace\n  With suppliant knee, and deifie his power\n  Who from the terrour of this Arm so late\n  Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\n  That were an ignominy and shame beneath\n  This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\n  And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\n  Since through experience of this great event\n  In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,\n  We may with more successful hope resolve\n  To wage by force or guile eternal Warr\n  Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\n  Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy\n  Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.\n\n    So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,\n  Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:\n  And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.\n\n    O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\n  That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\n  Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\n  Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;\n  And put to proof his high Supremacy,\n  Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\n  Too well I see and rue the dire event,\n  That with sad overthrow and foul defeat\n  Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host\n  In horrible destruction laid thus low,\n  As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences\n  Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains\n  Invincible, and vigour soon returns,\n  Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state\n  Here swallow'd up in endless misery.\n  But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\n  Of force believe Almighty, since no less\n  Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)\n  Have left us this our spirit and strength intire\n  Strongly to suffer and support our pains,\n  That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\n  Or do him mightier service as his thralls\n  By right of Warr, what e're his business be\n  Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\n  Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\n  What can it then avail though yet we feel\n  Strength undiminisht, or eternal being\n  To undergo eternal punishment?\n  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.\n\n    Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable\n  Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,\n  To do ought good never will be our task,\n  But ever to do ill our sole delight,\n  As being the contrary to his high will\n  Whom we resist.  If then his Providence\n  Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,\n  Our labour must be to pervert that end,\n  And out of good still to find means of evil;\n  Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps\n  Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb\n  His inmost counsels from their destind aim.\n  But see the angry Victor hath recall'd\n  His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit\n  Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail\n  Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid\n  The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice\n  Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,\n  Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,\n  Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now\n  To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\n  Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,\n  Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\n  Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,\n  The seat of desolation, voyd of light,\n  Save what the glimmering of these livid flames\n  Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend\n  From off the tossing of these fiery waves,\n  There rest, if any rest can harbour there,\n  And reassembling our afflicted Powers,\n  Consult how we may henceforth most offend\n  Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,\n  How overcome this dire Calamity,\n  What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,\n  If not what resolution from despare.\n\n    Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate\n  With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\n  That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides\n  Prone on the Flood, extended long and large\n  Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\n  As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\n  TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,\n  BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den\n  By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast\n  LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works\n  Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:\n  Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam\n  The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,\n  Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,\n  With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\n  Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night\n  Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\n  So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\n  Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence\n  Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will\n  And high permission of all-ruling Heaven\n  Left him at large to his own dark designs,\n  That with reiterated crimes he might\n  Heap on himself damnation, while he sought\n  Evil to others, and enrag'd might see\n  How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth\n  Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\n  On Man by him seduc't, but on himself\n  Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.\n  Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\n  His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\n  Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld\n  In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.\n  Then with expanded wings he stears his flight\n  Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\n  That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\n  He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd\n  With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\n  And such appear'd in hue, as when the force\n  Of subterranean wind transports a Hill\n  Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side\n  Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible\n  And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,\n  Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,\n  And leave a singed bottom all involv'd\n  With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\n  Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,\n  Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood\n  As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,\n  Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.\n\n    Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,\n  Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat\n  That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom\n  For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee\n  Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid\n  What shall be right: fardest from him is best\n  Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream\n  Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields\n  Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail\n  Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell\n  Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings\n  A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.\n  The mind is its own place, and in it self\n  Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.\n  What matter where, if I be still the same,\n  And what I should be, all but less then hee\n  Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least\n  We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built\n  Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:\n  Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce\n  To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:\n  Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.\n  But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,\n  Th' associates and copartners of our loss\n  Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,\n  And call them not to share with us their part\n  In this unhappy Mansion, or once more\n  With rallied Arms to try what may be yet\n  Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?\n\n    So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB\n  Thus answer'd.  Leader of those Armies bright,\n  Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,\n  If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge\n  Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft\n  In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge\n  Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults\n  Their surest signal, they will soon resume\n  New courage and revive, though now they lye\n  Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,\n  As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,\n  No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.\n\n    He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend\n  Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield\n  Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,\n  Behind him cast; the broad circumference\n  Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb\n  Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views\n  At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,\n  Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,\n  Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.\n  His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine\n  Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast\n  Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,\n  He walkt with to support uneasie steps\n  Over the burning Marle, not like those steps\n  On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime\n  Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;\n  Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach\n  Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd\n  His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't\n  Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks\n  In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades\n  High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge\n  Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd\n  Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew\n  BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,\n  VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd\n  The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld\n  From the safe shore their floating Carkases\n  And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown\n  Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,\n  Under amazement of their hideous change.\n  He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep\n  Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,\n  Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,\n  If such astonishment as this can sieze\n  Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place\n  After the toyl of Battel to repose\n  Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find\n  To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?\n  Or in this abject posture have ye sworn\n  To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds\n  Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood\n  With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon\n  His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern\n  Th' advantage, and descending tread us down\n  Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts\n  Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.\n  Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.\n\n    They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\n  Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch\n  On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\n  Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\n  Nor did they not perceave the evil plight\n  In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\n  Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\n  Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod\n  Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day\n  Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud\n  Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,\n  That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung\n  Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:\n  So numberless were those bad Angels seen\n  Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell\n  'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\n  Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear\n  Of their great Sultan waving to direct\n  Thir course, in even ballance down they light\n  On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;\n  A multitude, like which the populous North\n  Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass\n  RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons\n  Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread\n  Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.\n  Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band\n  The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\n  Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms\n  Excelling human, Princely Dignities,\n  And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;\n  Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now\n  Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd\n  By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\n  Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE\n  Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,\n  Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\n  By falsities and lyes the greatest part\n  Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake\n  God their Creator, and th' invisible\n  Glory of him, that made them, to transform\n  Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd\n  With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\n  And Devils to adore for Deities:\n  Then were they known to men by various Names,\n  And various Idols through the Heathen World.\n  Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,\n  Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\n  At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth\n  Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,\n  While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?\n  The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\n  Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix\n  Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,\n  Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd\n  Among the Nations round, and durst abide\n  JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd\n  Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd\n  Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,\n  Abominations; and with cursed things\n  His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,\n  And with their darkness durst affront his light.\n  First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood\n  Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,\n  Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\n  Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\n  To his grim Idol.  Him the AMMONITE\n  Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,\n  In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream\n  Of utmost ARNON.  Nor content with such\n  Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\n  Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build\n  His Temple right against the Temple of God\n  On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\n  The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence\n  And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.\n  Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,\n  From AROER to NEBO, and the wild\n  Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON\n  And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond\n  The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,\n  And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.\n  PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd\n  ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE\n  To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\n  Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd\n  Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove\n  Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;\n  Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.\n  With these came they, who from the bordring flood\n  Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts\n  EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names\n  Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,\n  These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please\n  Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft\n  And uncompounded is their Essence pure,\n  Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,\n  Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\n  Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\n  Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,\n  Can execute their aerie purposes,\n  And works of love or enmity fulfill.\n  For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook\n  Their living strength, and unfrequented left\n  His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\n  To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low\n  Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\n  Of despicable foes.  With these in troop\n  Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd\n  ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;\n  To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon\n  SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,\n  In SION also not unsung, where stood\n  Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built\n  By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\n  Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell\n  To Idols foul.  THAMMUZ came next behind,\n  Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd\n  The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate\n  In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\n  While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock\n  Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood\n  Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale\n  Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,\n  Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\n  EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led\n  His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries\n  Of alienated JUDAH.  Next came one\n  Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark\n  Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off\n  In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,\n  Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:\n  DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\n  And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\n  Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast\n  Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,\n  And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.\n  Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat\n  Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks\n  Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.\n  He also against the house of God was bold:\n  A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,\n  AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\n  Gods Altar to disparage and displace\n  For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn\n  His odious offrings, and adore the Gods\n  Whom he had vanquisht.  After these appear'd\n  A crew who under Names of old Renown,\n  OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train\n  With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd\n  Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek\n  Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms\n  Rather then human.  Nor did ISRAEL scape\n  Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd\n  The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King\n  Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,\n  Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\n  JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd\n  From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke\n  Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.\n  BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\n  Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\n  Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood\n  Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee\n  In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\n  Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd\n  With lust and violence the house of God.\n  In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\n  And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\n  Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\n  And injury and outrage: And when Night\n  Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\n  Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.\n  Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night\n  In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores\n  Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\n  These were the prime in order and in might;\n  The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,\n  Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held\n  Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth\n  Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born\n  With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd\n  By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE\n  His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;\n  So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET\n  And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top\n  Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air\n  Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,\n  Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds\n  Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old\n  Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,\n  And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.\n  All these and more came flocking; but with looks\n  Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd\n  Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\n  Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost\n  In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast\n  Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\n  Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore\n  Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd\n  Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.\n  Then strait commands that at the warlike sound\n  Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\n  His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd\n  AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:\n  Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\n  Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't\n  Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\n  With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,\n  Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\n  Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\n  At which the universal Host upsent\n  A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\n  Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.\n  All in a moment through the gloom were seen\n  Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air\n  With Orient Colours waving: with them rose\n  A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\n  Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array\n  Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move\n  In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood\n  Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd\n  To highth of noblest temper Hero's old\n  Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage\n  Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd\n  With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\n  Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage\n  With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase\n  Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\n  From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they\n  Breathing united force with fixed thought\n  Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd\n  Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now\n  Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front\n  Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\n  Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,\n  Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief\n  Had to impose: He through the armed Files\n  Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse\n  The whole Battalion views, thir order due,\n  Thir visages and stature as of Gods,\n  Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart\n  Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength\n  Glories: For never since created man,\n  Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these\n  Could merit more then that small infantry\n  Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\n  Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd\n  That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side\n  Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\n  In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son\n  Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;\n  And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel\n  Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,\n  DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,\n  Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore\n  When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell\n  By FONTARABBIA.  Thus far these beyond\n  Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd\n  Thir dread Commander: he above the rest\n  In shape and gesture proudly eminent\n  Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\n  All her Original brightness, nor appear'd\n  Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess\n  Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n\n  Looks through the Horizontal misty Air\n  Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\n  In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\n  On half the Nations, and with fear of change\n  Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark'n'd so, yet shon\n  Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face\n  Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\n  Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes\n  Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\n  Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast\n  Signs of remorse and passion to behold\n  The fellows of his crime, the followers rather\n  (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd\n  For ever now to have their lot in pain,\n  Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't\n  Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung\n  For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\n  Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire\n  Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,\n  With singed top their stately growth though bare\n  Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar'd\n  To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend\n  From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round\n  With all his Peers: attention held them mute.\n  Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,\n  Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last\n  Words interwove with sighs found out their way.\n\n    O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers\n  Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife\n  Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,\n  As this place testifies, and this dire change\n  Hateful to utter: but what power of mind\n  Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth\n  Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,\n  How such united force of Gods, how such\n  As stood like these, could ever know repulse?\n  For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,\n  That all these puissant Legions, whose exile\n  Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend\n  Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.\n  For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,\n  If counsels different, or danger shun'd\n  By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns\n  Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure\n  Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,\n  Consent or custome, and his Regal State\n  Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,\n  Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.\n  Henceforth his might we know, and know our own\n  So as not either to provoke, or dread\n  New warr, provok't; our better part remains\n  To work in close design, by fraud or guile\n  What force effected not: that he no less\n  At length from us may find, who overcomes\n  By force, hath overcome but half his foe.\n  Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife\n  There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long\n  Intended to create, and therein plant\n  A generation, whom his choice regard\n  Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:\n  Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps\n  Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:\n  For this Infernal Pit shall never hold\n  Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse\n  Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts\n  Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,\n  For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr\n  Open or understood must be resolv'd.\n\n    He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew\n  Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\n  Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze\n  Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd\n  Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's\n  Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,\n  Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.\n\n    There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top\n  Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire\n  Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign\n  That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,\n  The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing'd with speed\n  A numerous Brigad hasten'd.  As when bands\n  Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd\n  Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,\n  Or cast a Rampart.  MAMMON led them on,\n  MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell\n  From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks & thoughts\n  Were always downward bent, admiring more\n  The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,\n  Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd\n  In vision beatific: by him first\n  Men also, and by his suggestion taught,\n  Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands\n  Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth\n  For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew\n  Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound\n  And dig'd out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire\n  That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best\n  Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those\n  Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell\n  Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,\n  Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,\n  And Strength and Art are easily outdone\n  By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour\n  What in an age they with incessant toyle\n  And hands innumerable scarce perform\n  Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,\n  That underneath had veins of liquid fire\n  Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude\n  With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,\n  Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:\n  A third as soon had form'd within the ground\n  A various mould, and from the boyling cells\n  By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,\n  As in an Organ from one blast of wind\n  To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.\n  Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge\n  Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound\n  Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,\n  Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round\n  Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid\n  With Golden Architrave; nor did there want\n  Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,\n  The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not BABILON,\n  Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence\n  Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine\n  BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat\n  Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove\n  In wealth and luxurie.  Th' ascending pile\n  Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores\n  Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide\n  Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth\n  And level pavement: from the arched roof\n  Pendant by suttle Magic many a row\n  Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed\n  With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light\n  As from a sky.  The hasty multitude\n  Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise\n  And some the Architect: his hand was known\n  In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,\n  Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,\n  And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King\n  Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,\n  Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.\n  Nor was his name unheard or unador'd\n  In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land\n  Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell\n  From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE\n  Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn\n  To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,\n  A Summers day; and with the setting Sun\n  Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,\n  On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,\n  Erring; for he with this rebellious rout\n  Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now\n  To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape\n  By all his Engins, but was headlong sent\n  With his industrious crew to build in hell.\n  Mean while the winged Haralds by command\n  Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony\n  And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim\n  A solemn Councel forthwith to be held\n  At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital\n  Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd\n  From every and Band squared Regiment\n  By place or choice the worthiest; they anon\n  With hundreds and with thousands trooping came\n  Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates\n  And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall\n  (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold\n  Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair\n  Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry\n  To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)\n  Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,\n  Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees\n  In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,\n  Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive\n  In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\n  Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,\n  The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,\n  New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer\n  Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd\n  Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,\n  Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd\n  In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons\n  Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room\n  Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race\n  Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,\n  Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side\n  Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,\n  Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon\n  Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth\n  Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance\n  Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;\n  At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.\n  Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms\n  Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,\n  Though without number still amidst the Hall\n  Of that infernal Court.  But far within\n  And in thir own dimensions like themselves\n  The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim\n  In close recess and secret conclave sat\n  A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,\n  Frequent and full.  After short silence then\n  And summons read, the great consult began.\n\n      THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK II.\n\n  High on a Throne of Royal State, which far\n  Outshon the wealth of ORMUS and of IND,\n  Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand\n  Showrs on her Kings BARBARIC Pearl & Gold,\n  Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd\n  To that bad eminence; and from despair\n  Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires\n  Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue\n  Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught\n  His proud imaginations thus displaid.\n\n    Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n,\n  For since no deep within her gulf can hold\n  Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n,\n  I give not Heav'n for lost.  From this descent\n  Celestial vertues rising, will appear\n  More glorious and more dread then from no fall,\n  And trust themselves to fear no second fate:\n  Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n\n  Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,\n  With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,\n  Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss\n  Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more\n  Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne\n  Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state\n  In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw\n  Envy from each inferior; but who here\n  Will envy whom the highest place exposes\n  Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime\n  Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share\n  Of endless pain? where there is then no good\n  For which to strive, no strife can grow up there\n  From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell\n  Precedence, none, whose portion is so small\n  Of present pain, that with ambitious mind\n  Will covet more.  With this advantage then\n  To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,\n  More then can be in Heav'n, we now return\n  To claim our just inheritance of old,\n  Surer to prosper then prosperity\n  Could have assur'd us; and by what best way,\n  Whether of open Warr or covert guile,\n  We now debate; who can advise, may speak.\n\n    He ceas'd, and next him MOLOC, Scepter'd King\n  Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit\n  That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair:\n  His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd\n  Equal in strength, and rather then be less\n  Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost\n  Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse\n  He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.\n\n    My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,\n  More unexpert, I boast not: them let those\n  Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.\n  For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,\n  Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait\n  The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here\n  Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place\n  Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,\n  The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns\n  By our delay? no, let us rather choose\n  Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once\n  O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way,\n  Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms\n  Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise\n  Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear\n  Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see\n  Black fire and horror shot with equal rage\n  Among his Angels; and his Throne it self\n  Mixt with TARTAREAN Sulphur, and strange fire,\n  His own invented Torments.  But perhaps\n  The way seems difficult and steep to scale\n  With upright wing against a higher foe.\n  Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench\n  Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,\n  That in our proper motion we ascend\n  Up to our native seat: descent and fall\n  To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late\n  When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear\n  Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep,\n  With what compulsion and laborious flight\n  We sunk thus low?  Th' ascent is easie then;\n  Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke\n  Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find\n  To our destruction: if there be in Hell\n  Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse\n  Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd\n  In this abhorred deep to utter woe;\n  Where pain of unextinguishable fire\n  Must exercise us without hope of end\n  The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge\n  Inexorably, and the torturing houre\n  Calls us to Penance?  More destroy'd then thus\n  We should be quite abolisht and expire.\n  What fear we then? what doubt we to incense\n  His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd,\n  Will either quite consume us, and reduce\n  To nothing this essential, happier farr\n  Then miserable to have eternal being:\n  Or if our substance be indeed Divine,\n  And cannot cease to be, we are at worst\n  On this side nothing; and by proof we feel\n  Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n,\n  And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,\n  Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:\n  Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.\n\n    He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd\n  Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous\n  To less then Gods.  On th' other side up rose\n  BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;\n  A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd\n  For dignity compos'd and high exploit:\n  But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue\n  Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear\n  The better reason, to perplex and dash\n  Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;\n  To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds\n  Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare,\n  And with perswasive accent thus began.\n\n    I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,\n  As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd\n  Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,\n  Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast\n  Ominous conjecture on the whole success:\n  When he who most excels in fact of Arms,\n  In what he counsels and in what excels\n  Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\n  And utter dissolution, as the scope\n  Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.\n  First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd\n  With Armed watch, that render all access\n  Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep\n  Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing\n  Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,\n  Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way\n  By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\n  With blackest Insurrection, to confound\n  Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie\n  All incorruptible would on his Throne\n  Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould\n  Incapable of stain would soon expel\n  Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire\n  Victorious.  Thus repuls'd, our final hope\n  Is flat despair: we must exasperate\n  Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\n  And that must end us, that must be our cure,\n  To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\n  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,\n  Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,\n  To perish rather, swallowd up and lost\n  In the wide womb of uncreated night,\n  Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\n  Let this be good, whether our angry Foe\n  Can give it, or will ever? how he can\n  Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.\n  Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\n  Belike through impotence, or unaware,\n  To give his Enemies thir wish, and end\n  Them in his anger, whom his anger saves\n  To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\n  Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,\n  Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;\n  Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,\n  What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\n  Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\n  What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook\n  With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought\n  The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd\n  A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay\n  Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\n  What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires\n  Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage\n  And plunge us in the Flames? or from above\n  Should intermitted vengeance Arme again\n  His red right hand to plague us? what if all\n  Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament\n  Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\n  Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall\n  One day upon our heads; while we perhaps\n  Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,\n  Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd\n  Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey\n  Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\n  Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;\n  There to converse with everlasting groans,\n  Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,\n  Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.\n  Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike\n  My voice disswades; for what can force or guile\n  With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\n  Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth\n  All these our motions vain, sees and derides;\n  Not more Almighty to resist our might\n  Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\n  Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n\n  Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here\n  Chains & these Torments? better these then worse\n  By my advice; since fate inevitable\n  Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,\n  The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,\n  Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust\n  That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,\n  If we were wise, against so great a foe\n  Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.\n  I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\n  And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear\n  What yet they know must follow, to endure\n  Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\n  The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now\n  Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\n  Our Supream Foe in time may much remit\n  His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd\n  Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd\n  With what is punish't; whence these raging fires\n  Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.\n  Our purer essence then will overcome\n  Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,\n  Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd\n  In temper and in nature, will receive\n  Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\n  This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,\n  Besides what hope the never-ending flight\n  Of future days may bring, what chance, what change\n  Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers\n  For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\n  If we procure not to our selves more woe.\n\n    Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb\n  Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,\n  Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake.\n\n    Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n\n  We warr, if warr be best, or to regain\n  Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then\n  May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild\n  To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:\n  The former vain to hope argues as vain\n  The latter: for what place can be for us\n  Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream\n  We overpower?  Suppose he should relent\n  And publish Grace to all, on promise made\n  Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we\n  Stand in his presence humble, and receive\n  Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne\n  With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\n  Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits\n  Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes\n  Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,\n  Our servile offerings.  This must be our task\n  In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom\n  Eternity so spent in worship paid\n  To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue\n  By force impossible, by leave obtain'd\n  Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state\n  Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek\n  Our own good from our selves, and from our own\n  Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,\n  Free, and to none accountable, preferring\n  Hard liberty before the easie yoke\n  Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear\n  Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,\n  Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\n  We can create, and in what place so e're\n  Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\n  Through labour and endurance.  This deep world\n  Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst\n  Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire\n  Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,\n  And with the Majesty of darkness round\n  Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar\n  Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?\n  As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light\n  Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile\n  Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;\n  Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise\n  Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?\n  Our torments also may in length of time\n  Become our Elements, these piercing Fires\n  As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd\n  Into their temper; which must needs remove\n  The sensible of pain.  All things invite\n  To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State\n  Of order, how in safety best we may\n  Compose our present evils, with regard\n  Of what we are and where, dismissing quite\n  All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.\n\n    He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\n  Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\n  The sound of blustring winds, which all night long\n  Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\n  Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\n  Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\n  After the Tempest: Such applause was heard\n  As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,\n  Advising peace: for such another Field\n  They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\n  Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL\n  Wrought still within them; and no less desire\n  To found this nether Empire, which might rise\n  By pollicy, and long process of time,\n  In emulation opposite to Heav'n.\n  Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,\n  SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave\n  Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd\n  A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\n  Deliberation sat and publick care;\n  And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\n  Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood\n  With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear\n  The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\n  Drew audience and attention still as Night\n  Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\n\n    Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n,\n  Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now\n  Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd\n  Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote\n  Inclines, here to continue, and build up here\n  A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,\n  And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd\n  This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\n  Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\n  From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League\n  Banded against his Throne, but to remaine\n  In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,\n  Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd\n  His captive multitude: For he, be sure,\n  In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign\n  Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part\n  By our revolt, but over Hell extend\n  His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule\n  Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.\n  What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?\n  Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss\n  Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none\n  Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n\n  To us enslav'd, but custody severe,\n  And stripes, and arbitrary punishment\n  Inflicted? and what peace can we return,\n  But to our power hostility and hate,\n  Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,\n  Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least\n  May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce\n  In doing what we most in suffering feel?\n  Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need\n  With dangerous expedition to invade\n  Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\n  Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find\n  Some easier enterprize?  There is a place\n  (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n\n  Err not) another World, the happy seat\n  Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time\n  To be created like to us, though less\n  In power and excellence, but favour'd more\n  Of him who rules above; so was his will\n  Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,\n  That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.\n  Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\n  What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,\n  Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,\n  And where thir weakness, how attempted best,\n  By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,\n  And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure\n  In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd\n  The utmost border of his Kingdom, left\n  To their defence who hold it: here perhaps\n  Som advantagious act may be achiev'd\n  By sudden onset, either with Hell fire\n  To waste his whole Creation, or possess\n  All as our own, and drive as we were driven,\n  The punie habitants, or if not drive,\n  Seduce them to our Party, that thir God\n  May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand\n  Abolish his own works.  This would surpass\n  Common revenge, and interrupt his joy\n  In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise\n  In his disturbance; when his darling Sons\n  Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse\n  Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,\n  Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth\n  Attempting, or to sit in darkness here\n  Hatching vain Empires.  Thus BEELZEBUB\n  Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd\n  By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence,\n  But from the Author of all ill could Spring\n  So deep a malice, to confound the race\n  Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\n  To mingle and involve, done all to spite\n  The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves\n  His glory to augment.  The bold design\n  Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy\n  Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent\n  They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\n\n    Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,\n  Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\n  Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep\n  Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\n  Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\n  Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\n  And opportune excursion we may chance\n  Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone\n  Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light\n  Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam\n  Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\n  To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\n  Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send\n  In search of this new world, whom shall we find\n  Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\n  The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss\n  And through the palpable obscure find out\n  His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\n  Upborn with indefatigable wings\n  Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\n  The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then\n  Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe\n  Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick\n  Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need\n  All circumspection, and we now no less\n  Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\n  The weight of all and our last hope relies.\n\n    This said, he sat; and expectation held\n  His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd\n  To second, or oppose, or undertake\n  The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,\n  Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each\n  In others count'nance red his own dismay\n  Astonisht: none among the choice and prime\n  Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found\n  So hardie as to proffer or accept\n  Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last\n  SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais'd\n  Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride\n  Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake.\n\n    O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones,\n  With reason hath deep silence and demurr\n  Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way\n  And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;\n  Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,\n  Outrageous to devour, immures us round\n  Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant\n  Barr'd over us prohibit all egress.\n  These past, if any pass, the void profound\n  Of unessential Night receives him next\n  Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being\n  Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf.\n  If thence he scape into what ever world,\n  Or unknown Region, what remains him less\n  Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.\n  But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,\n  And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd\n  With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd\n  And judg'd of public moment, in the shape\n  Of difficulty or danger could deterre\n  Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume\n  These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,\n  Refusing to accept as great a share\n  Of hazard as of honour, due alike\n  To him who Reigns, and so much to him due\n  Of hazard more, as he above the rest\n  High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,\n  Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home,\n  While here shall be our home, what best may ease\n  The present misery, and render Hell\n  More tollerable; if there be cure or charm\n  To respite or deceive, or slack the pain\n  Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch\n  Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad\n  Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek\n  Deliverance for us all: this enterprize\n  None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose\n  The Monarch, and prevented all reply,\n  Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd\n  Others among the chief might offer now\n  (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard;\n  And so refus'd might in opinion stand\n  His rivals, winning cheap the high repute\n  Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they\n  Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice\n  Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;\n  Thir rising all at once was as the sound\n  Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend\n  With awful reverence prone; and as a God\n  Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n:\n  Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd,\n  That for the general safety he despis'd\n  His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd\n  Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast\n  Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,\n  Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal.\n  Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark\n  Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:\n  As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds\n  Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread\n  Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element\n  Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre;\n  If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet\n  Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive,\n  The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds\n  Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.\n  O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn'd\n  Firm concord holds, men onely disagree\n  Of Creatures rational, though under hope\n  Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,\n  Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife\n  Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,\n  Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:\n  As if (which might induce us to accord)\n  Man had not hellish foes anow besides,\n  That day and night for his destruction waite.\n\n    The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth\n  In order came the grand infernal Peers,\n  Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd\n  Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less\n  Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,\n  And God-like imitated State; him round\n  A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd\n  With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.\n  Then of thir Session ended they bid cry\n  With Trumpets regal sound the great result:\n  Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim\n  Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie\n  By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss\n  Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell\n  With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim.\n  Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd\n  By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers\n  Disband, and wandring, each his several way\n  Pursues, as inclination or sad choice\n  Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find\n  Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain\n  The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.\n  Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime\n  Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,\n  As at th' Olympian Games or PYTHIAN fields;\n  Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal\n  With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.\n  As when to warn proud Cities warr appears\n  Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush\n  To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van\n  Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears\n  Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms\n  From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns.\n  Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell\n  Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air\n  In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.\n  As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown'd\n  With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore\n  Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines,\n  And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw\n  Into th' EUBOIC Sea.  Others more milde,\n  Retreated in a silent valley, sing\n  With notes Angelical to many a Harp\n  Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall\n  By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate\n  Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.\n  Thir song was partial, but the harmony\n  (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)\n  Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment\n  The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet\n  (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)\n  Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd,\n  In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high\n  Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,\n  Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\n  And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.\n  Of good and evil much they argu'd then,\n  Of happiness and final misery,\n  Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,\n  Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:\n  Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm\n  Pain for a while or anguish, and excite\n  Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest\n  With stubborn patience as with triple steel.\n  Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,\n  On bold adventure to discover wide\n  That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps\n  Might yeild them easier habitation, bend\n  Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks\n  Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge\n  Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;\n  Abhorred STYX the flood of deadly hate,\n  Sad ACHERON of sorrow, black and deep;\n  COCYTUS, nam'd of lamentation loud\n  Heard on the ruful stream; fierce PHLEGETON\n  Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\n  Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,\n  LETHE the River of Oblivion roules\n  Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,\n  Forthwith his former state and being forgets,\n  Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.\n  Beyond this flood a frozen Continent\n  Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms\n  Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land\n  Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems\n  Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,\n  A gulf profound as that SERBONIAN Bog\n  Betwixt DAMIATA and mount CASIUS old,\n  Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air\n  Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire.\n  Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd,\n  At certain revolutions all the damn'd\n  Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change\n  Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,\n  From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice\n  Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine\n  Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,\n  Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.\n  They ferry over this LETHEAN Sound\n  Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,\n  And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach\n  The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose\n  In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,\n  All in one moment, and so neer the brink;\n  But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt\n  MEDUSA with GORGONIAN terror guards\n  The Ford, and of it self the water flies\n  All taste of living wight, as once it fled\n  The lip of TANTALUS.  Thus roving on\n  In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands\n  With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast\n  View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found\n  No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile\n  They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous,\n  O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,\n  Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,\n  A Universe of death, which God by curse\n  Created evil, for evil only good,\n  Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,\n  Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,\n  Abominable, inutterable, and worse\n  Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,\n  GORGONS and HYDRA'S, and CHIMERA'S dire.\n\n    Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,\n  SATAN with thoughts inflam'd of highest design,\n  Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell\n  Explores his solitary flight; som times\n  He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,\n  Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares\n  Up to the fiery concave touring high.\n  As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd\n  Hangs in the Clouds, by AEQUINOCTIAL Winds\n  Close sailing from BENGALA, or the Iles\n  Of TERNATE and TIDORE, whence Merchants bring\n  Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood\n  Through the wide ETHIOPIAN to the Cape\n  Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem'd\n  Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer\n  Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,\n  And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass\n  Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,\n  Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire,\n  Yet unconsum'd.  Before the Gates there sat\n  On either side a formidable shape;\n  The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair,\n  But ended foul in many a scaly fould\n  Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd\n  With mortal sting: about her middle round\n  A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd\n  With wide CERBEREAN mouths full loud, and rung\n  A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\n  If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb,\n  And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd\n  Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these\n  Vex'd SCYLLA bathing in the Sea that parts\n  CALABRIA from the hoarce TRINACRIAN shore:\n  Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd\n  In secret, riding through the Air she comes\n  Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance\n  With LAPLAND Witches, while the labouring Moon\n  Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,\n  If shape it might be call'd that shape had none\n  Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,\n  Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,\n  For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night,\n  Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\n  And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head\n  The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.\n  SATAN was now at hand, and from his seat\n  The Monster moving onward came as fast,\n  With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.\n  Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd,\n  Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except,\n  Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd;\n  And with disdainful look thus first began.\n\n    Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,\n  That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance\n  Thy miscreated Front athwart my way\n  To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\n  That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee:\n  Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\n  Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n.\n\n    To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd,\n  Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,\n  Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then\n  Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms\n  Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons\n  Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou\n  And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd\n  To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?\n  And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n,\n  Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,\n  Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,\n  Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,\n  False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,\n  Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue\n  Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart\n  Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.\n\n    So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,\n  So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold\n  More dreadful and deform: on th' other side\n  Incenc't with indignation SATAN stood\n  Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd,\n  That fires the length of OPHIUCUS huge\n  In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair\n  Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head\n  Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands\n  No second stroke intend, and such a frown\n  Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds\n  With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on\n  Over the CASPIAN, then stand front to front\n  Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow\n  To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:\n  So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell\n  Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;\n  For never but once more was either like\n  To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\n  Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung,\n  Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat\n  Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,\n  Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between.\n\n    O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,\n  Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son,\n  Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart\n  Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom;\n  For him who sits above and laughs the while\n  At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute\n  What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,\n  His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.\n\n    She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest\n  Forbore, then these to her SATAN return'd:\n\n    So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\n  Thou interposest, that my sudden hand\n  Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds\n  What it intends; till first I know of thee,\n  What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why\n  In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st\n  Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son?\n  I know thee not, nor ever saw till now\n  Sight more detestable then him and thee.\n\n    T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd;\n  Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem\n  Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair\n  In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight\n  Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd\n  In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King,\n  All on a sudden miserable pain\n  Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm\n  In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast\n  Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide,\n  Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright,\n  Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd\n  Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd\n  All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid\n  At first, and call'd me SIN, and for a Sign\n  Portentous held me; but familiar grown,\n  I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won\n  The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft\n  Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing\n  Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st\n  With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd\n  A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,\n  And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind\n  (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe\n  Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout\n  Through all the Empyrean: down they fell\n  Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down\n  Into this Deep, and in the general fall\n  I also; at which time this powerful Key\n  Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep\n  These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass\n  Without my op'ning.  Pensive here I sat\n  Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb\n  Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown\n  Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.\n  At last this odious offspring whom thou seest\n  Thine own begotten, breaking violent way\n  Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain\n  Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew\n  Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie\n  Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart\n  Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out DEATH;\n  Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd\n  From all her Caves, and back resounded DEATH.\n  I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems,\n  Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far,\n  Me overtook his mother all dismaid,\n  And in embraces forcible and foule\n  Ingendring with me, of that rape begot\n  These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry\n  Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd\n  And hourly born, with sorrow infinite\n  To me, for when they list into the womb\n  That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw\n  My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth\n  Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,\n  That rest or intermission none I find.\n  Before mine eyes in opposition sits\n  Grim DEATH my Son and foe, who sets them on,\n  And me his Parent would full soon devour\n  For want of other prey, but that he knows\n  His end with mine involvd; and knows that I\n  Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,\n  When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd.\n  But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun\n  His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope\n  To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,\n  Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint,\n  Save he who reigns above, none can resist.\n\n    She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore\n  Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.\n  Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire,\n  And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge\n  Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys\n  Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change\n  Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know\n  I come no enemie, but to set free\n  From out this dark and dismal house of pain,\n  Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host\n  Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd\n  Fell with us from on high: from them I go\n  This uncouth errand sole, and one for all\n  My self expose, with lonely steps to tread\n  Th' unfounded deep, & through the void immense\n  To search with wandring quest a place foretold\n  Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now\n  Created vast and round, a place of bliss\n  In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't\n  A race of upstart Creatures, to supply\n  Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd,\n  Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude\n  Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught\n  Then this more secret now design'd, I haste\n  To know, and this once known, shall soon return,\n  And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death\n  Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\n  Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd\n  With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd\n  Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.\n  He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death\n  Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear\n  His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe\n  Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd\n  His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.\n\n    The key of this infernal Pit by due,\n  And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King\n  I keep, by him forbidden to unlock\n  These Adamantine Gates; against all force\n  Death ready stands to interpose his dart,\n  Fearless to be o'rematcht by living might.\n  But what ow I to his commands above\n  Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down\n  Into this gloom of TARTARUS profound,\n  To sit in hateful Office here confin'd,\n  Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born,\n  Here in perpetual agonie and pain,\n  With terrors and with clamors compasst round\n  Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:\n  Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou\n  My being gav'st me; whom should I obey\n  But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon\n  To that new world of light and bliss, among\n  The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign\n  At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems\n  Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.\n\n    Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,\n  Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;\n  And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,\n  Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,\n  Which but her self not all the STYGIAN powers\n  Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns\n  Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar\n  Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease\n  Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie\n  With impetuous recoile and jarring sound\n  Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges great\n  Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\n  Of EREBUS.  She op'nd, but to shut\n  Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood,\n  That with extended wings a Bannerd Host\n  Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through\n  With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;\n  So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth\n  Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.\n  Before thir eyes in sudden view appear\n  The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark\n  Illimitable Ocean without bound,\n  Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,\n  And time and place are lost; where eldest Night\n  And CHAOS, Ancestors of Nature, hold\n  Eternal ANARCHIE, amidst the noise\n  Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.\n  For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce\n  Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring\n  Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag\n  Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,\n  Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,\n  Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands\n  Of BARCA or CYRENE'S torrid soil,\n  Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise\n  Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,\n  Hee rules a moment; CHAOS Umpire sits,\n  And by decision more imbroiles the fray\n  By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter\n  CHANCE governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,\n  The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,\n  Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,\n  But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt\n  Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,\n  Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain\n  His dark materials to create more Worlds,\n  Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend\n  Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,\n  Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith\n  He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal'd\n  With noises loud and ruinous (to compare\n  Great things with small) then when BELLONA storms,\n  With all her battering Engines bent to rase\n  Som Capital City, or less then if this frame\n  Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements\n  In mutinie had from her Axle torn\n  The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes\n  He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak\n  Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League\n  As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides\n  Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets\n  A vast vacuitie: all unawares\n  Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops\n  Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour\n  Down had been falling, had not by ill chance\n  The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud\n  Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him\n  As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd,\n  Quencht in a Boggie SYRTIS, neither Sea,\n  Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,\n  Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,\n  Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.\n  As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness\n  With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,\n  Pursues the ARIMASPIAN, who by stelth\n  Had from his wakeful custody purloind\n  The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend\n  Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\n  With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,\n  And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:\n  At length a universal hubbub wilde\n  Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd\n  Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare\n  With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,\n  Undaunted to meet there what ever power\n  Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss\n  Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask\n  Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes\n  Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne\n  Of CHAOS, and his dark Pavilion spread\n  Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd\n  Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,\n  The consort of his Reign; and by them stood\n  ORCUS and ADES, and the dreaded name\n  Of DEMOGORGON; Rumor next and Chance,\n  And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,\n  And Discord with a thousand various mouths.\n\n    T' whom SATAN turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers\n  And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,\n  CHAOS and ANCIENT NIGHT, I come no Spie,\n  With purpose to explore or to disturb\n  The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint\n  Wandring this darksome desart, as my way\n  Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,\n  Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek\n  What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds\n  Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place\n  From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King\n  Possesses lately, thither to arrive\n  I travel this profound, direct my course;\n  Directed, no mean recompence it brings\n  To your behoof, if I that Region lost,\n  All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce\n  To her original darkness and your sway\n  (Which is my present journey) and once more\n  Erect the Standerd there of ANCIENT NIGHT;\n  Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge.\n\n    Thus SATAN; and him thus the Anarch old\n  With faultring speech and visage incompos'd\n  Answer'd.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art,\n  That mighty leading Angel, who of late\n  Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown.\n  I saw and heard, for such a numerous host\n  Fled not in silence through the frighted deep\n  With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,\n  Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates\n  Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands\n  Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here\n  Keep residence; if all I can will serve,\n  That little which is left so to defend\n  Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles\n  Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell\n  Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;\n  Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World\n  Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain\n  To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell:\n  If that way be your walk, you have not farr;\n  So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;\n  Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.\n\n    He ceas'd; and SATAN staid not to reply,\n  But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,\n  With fresh alacritie and force renew'd\n  Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire\n  Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock\n  Of fighting Elements, on all sides round\n  Environ'd wins his way; harder beset\n  And more endanger'd, then when ARGO pass'd\n  Through BOSPORUS betwixt the justling Rocks:\n  Or when ULYSSES on the Larbord shunnd\n  CHARYBDIS, and by th' other whirlpool steard.\n  So he with difficulty and labour hard\n  Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee;\n  But hee once past, soon after when man fell,\n  Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain\n  Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n,\n  Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way\n  Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf\n  Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length\n  From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe\n  Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse\n  With easie intercourse pass to and fro\n  To tempt or punish mortals, except whom\n  God and good Angels guard by special grace.\n  But now at last the sacred influence\n  Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n\n  Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night\n  A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins\n  Her fardest verge, and CHAOS to retire\n  As from her outmost works a brok'n foe\n  With tumult less and with less hostile din,\n  That SATAN with less toil, and now with ease\n  Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light\n  And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds\n  Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;\n  Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,\n  Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold\n  Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide\n  In circuit, undetermind square or round,\n  With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd\n  Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;\n  And fast by hanging in a golden Chain\n  This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr\n  Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.\n  Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,\n  Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.\n\n      THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK III\n\n\n    Hail holy light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born,\n  Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam\n  May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,\n  And never but in unapproached light\n  Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,\n  Bright effluence of bright essence increate.\n  Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,\n  Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,\n  Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice\n  Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest\n  The rising world of waters dark and deep,\n  Won from the void and formless infinite.\n  Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,\n  Escap't the STYGIAN Pool, though long detain'd\n  In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight\n  Through utter and through middle darkness borne\n  With other notes then to th' ORPHEAN Lyre\n  I sung of CHAOS and ETERNAL NIGHT,\n  Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down\n  The dark descent, and up to reascend,\n  Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,\n  And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou\n  Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain\n  To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;\n  So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,\n  Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more\n  Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt\n  Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,\n  Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief\n  Thee SION and the flowrie Brooks beneath\n  That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,\n  Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget\n  Those other two equal'd with me in Fate,\n  So were I equal'd with them in renown,\n  Blind THAMYRIS and blind MAEONIDES,\n  And TIRESIAS and PHINEUS Prophets old.\n  Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move\n  Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird\n  Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid\n  Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year\n  Seasons return, but not to me returns\n  Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn,\n  Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,\n  Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;\n  But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark\n  Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men\n  Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair\n  Presented with a Universal blanc\n  Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd,\n  And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.\n  So much the rather thou Celestial light\n  Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers\n  Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence\n  Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell\n  Of things invisible to mortal sight.\n\n    Now had the Almighty Father from above,\n  From the pure Empyrean where he sits\n  High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye,\n  His own works and their works at once to view:\n  About him all the Sanctities of Heaven\n  Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd\n  Beatitude past utterance; on his right\n  The radiant image of his Glory sat,\n  His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld\n  Our two first Parents, yet the onely two\n  Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't,\n  Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,\n  Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love\n  In blissful solitude; he then survey'd\n  Hell and the Gulf between, and SATAN there\n  Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night\n  In the dun Air sublime, and ready now\n  To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet\n  On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd\n  Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament,\n  Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.\n  Him God beholding from his prospect high,\n  Wherein past, present, future he beholds,\n  Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.\n\n    Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage\n  Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds\n  Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains\n  Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss\n  Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems\n  On desperat revenge, that shall redound\n  Upon his own rebellious head.  And now\n  Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way\n  Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light,\n  Directly towards the new created World,\n  And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay\n  If him by force he can destroy, or worse,\n  By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;\n  For man will heark'n to his glozing lyes,\n  And easily transgress the sole Command,\n  Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall\n  Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?\n  Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee\n  All he could have; I made him just and right,\n  Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.\n  Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers\n  And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild;\n  Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.\n  Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere\n  Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,\n  Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,\n  Not what they would? what praise could they receive?\n  What pleasure I from such obedience paid,\n  When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)\n  Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,\n  Made passive both, had servd necessitie,\n  Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,\n  So were created, nor can justly accuse\n  Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;\n  As if Predestination over-rul'd\n  Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree\n  Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed\n  Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,\n  Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,\n  Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown.\n  So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,\n  Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,\n  They trespass, Authors to themselves in all\n  Both what they judge and what they choose; for so\n  I formd them free, and free they must remain,\n  Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change\n  Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree\n  Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd\n  Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall.\n  The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,\n  Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd\n  By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,\n  The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,\n  Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,\n  But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.\n\n    Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd\n  All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect\n  Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd:\n  Beyond compare the Son of God was seen\n  Most glorious, in him all his Father shon\n  Substantially express'd, and in his face\n  Divine compassion visibly appeerd,\n  Love without end, and without measure Grace,\n  Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.\n\n    O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd\n  Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;\n  For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll\n  Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound\n  Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne\n  Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.\n  For should Man finally be lost, should Man\n  Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son\n  Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd\n  With his own folly? that be from thee farr,\n  That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge\n  Of all things made, and judgest onely right.\n  Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain\n  His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill\n  His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,\n  Or proud return though to his heavier doom,\n  Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell\n  Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,\n  By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self\n  Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,\n  For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?\n  So should thy goodness and thy greatness both\n  Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence.\n\n    To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd.\n  O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,\n  Son of my bosom, Son who art alone\n  My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,\n  All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all\n  As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:\n  Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will,\n  Yet not of will in him, but grace in me\n  Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew\n  His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd\n  By sin to foul exorbitant desires;\n  Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand\n  On even ground against his mortal foe,\n  By me upheld, that he may know how frail\n  His fall'n condition is, and to me ow\n  All his deliv'rance, and to none but me.\n  Some I have chosen of peculiar grace\n  Elect above the rest; so is my will:\n  The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd\n  Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes\n  Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace\n  Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,\n  What may suffice, and soft'n stonie hearts\n  To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.\n  To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,\n  Though but endevord with sincere intent,\n  Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.\n  And I will place within them as a guide\n  My Umpire CONSCIENCE, whom if they will hear,\n  Light after light well us'd they shall attain,\n  And to the end persisting, safe arrive.\n  This my long sufferance and my day of grace\n  They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;\n  But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more,\n  That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;\n  And none but such from mercy I exclude.\n  But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,\n  Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns\n  Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n,\n  Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,\n  To expiate his Treason hath naught left,\n  But to destruction sacred and devote,\n  He with his whole posteritie must die,\n  Die hee or Justice must; unless for him\n  Som other able, and as willing, pay\n  The rigid satisfaction, death for death.\n  Say Heav'nly Powers, where shall we find such love,\n  Which of ye will be mortal to redeem\n  Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save,\n  Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?\n\n    He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute,\n  And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf\n  Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,\n  Much less that durst upon his own head draw\n  The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.\n  And now without redemption all mankind\n  Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell\n  By doom severe, had not the Son of God,\n  In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,\n  His dearest mediation thus renewd.\n\n    Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;\n  And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,\n  The speediest of thy winged messengers,\n  To visit all thy creatures, and to all\n  Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought,\n  Happie for man, so coming; he her aide\n  Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;\n  Attonement for himself or offering meet,\n  Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:\n  Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life\n  I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;\n  Account mee man; I for his sake will leave\n  Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee\n  Freely put off, and for him lastly die\n  Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage;\n  Under his gloomie power I shall not long\n  Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess\n  Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,\n  Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due\n  All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,\n  Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave\n  His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule\n  For ever with corruption there to dwell;\n  But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue\n  My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;\n  Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop\n  Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd.\n  I through the ample Air in Triumph high\n  Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show\n  The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight\n  Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,\n  While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes,\n  Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:\n  Then with the multitude of my redeemd\n  Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,\n  Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud\n  Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd,\n  And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more\n  Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.\n\n    His words here ended, but his meek aspect\n  Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love\n  To mortal men, above which only shon\n  Filial obedience: as a sacrifice\n  Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will\n  Of his great Father.  Admiration seis'd\n  All Heav'n, what this might mean, & whither tend\n  Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd:\n\n    O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace\n  Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou\n  My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear,\n  To me are all my works, nor Man the least\n  Though last created, that for him I spare\n  Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,\n  By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.\n  Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,\n  Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;\n  And be thy self Man among men on Earth,\n  Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,\n  By wondrous birth: Be thou in ADAMS room\n  The Head of all mankind, though ADAMS Son.\n  As in him perish all men, so in thee\n  As from a second root shall be restor'd,\n  As many as are restor'd, without thee none.\n  His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit\n  Imputed shall absolve them who renounce\n  Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,\n  And live in thee transplanted, and from thee\n  Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,\n  Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die,\n  And dying rise, and rising with him raise\n  His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.\n  So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,\n  Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,\n  So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate\n  So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes\n  In those who, when they may, accept not grace.\n  Nor shalt thou by descending to assume\n  Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne.\n  Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss\n  Equal to God, and equally enjoying\n  God-like fruition, quitted all to save\n  A World from utter loss, and hast been found\n  By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,\n  Found worthiest to be so by being Good,\n  Farr more then Great or High; because in thee\n  Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,\n  Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt\n  With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;\n  Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne\n  Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,\n  Anointed universal King; all Power\n  I give thee, reign for ever, and assume\n  Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream\n  Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:\n  All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide\n  In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;\n  When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n\n  Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send\n  The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime\n  Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes\n  The living, and forthwith the cited dead\n  Of all past Ages to the general Doom\n  Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.\n  Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge\n  Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink\n  Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,\n  Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while\n  The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring\n  New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell\n  And after all thir tribulations long\n  See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,\n  With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.\n  Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,\n  For regal Scepter then no more shall need,\n  God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,\n  Adore him, who to compass all this dies,\n  Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.\n\n    No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all\n  The multitude of Angels with a shout\n  Loud as from numbers without number, sweet\n  As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung\n  With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's fill'd\n  Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent\n  Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground\n  With solemn adoration down they cast\n  Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,\n  Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once\n  In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life\n  Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence\n  To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows,\n  And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,\n  And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn\n  Rowls o're ELISIAN Flours her Amber stream;\n  With these that never fade the Spirits Elect\n  Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams,\n  Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright\n  Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon\n  Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd.\n  Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took,\n  Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side\n  Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet\n  Of charming symphonie they introduce\n  Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;\n  No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine\n  Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n.\n\n    Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,\n  Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,\n  Eternal King; thee Author of all being,\n  Fountain of Light, thy self invisible\n  Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st\n  Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st\n  The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud\n  Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,\n  Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,\n  Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim\n  Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.\n  Thee next they sang of all Creation first,\n  Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,\n  In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud\n  Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines,\n  Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee\n  Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,\n  Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests.\n  Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein\n  By thee created, and by thee threw down\n  Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day\n  Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,\n  Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook\n  Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks\n  Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid.\n  Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime\n  Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,\n  To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,\n  Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n,\n  Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome\n  So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:\n  No sooner did thy dear and onely Son\n  Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man\n  So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd,\n  He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife\n  Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern'd,\n  Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat\n  Second to thee, offerd himself to die\n  For mans offence.  O unexampl'd love,\n  Love no where to be found less then Divine!\n  Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name\n  Shall be the copious matter of my Song\n  Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise\n  Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.\n\n    Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear,\n  Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.\n  Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe\n  Of this round World, whose first convex divides\n  The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd\n  From CHAOS and th' inroad of Darkness old,\n  SATAN alighted walks: a Globe farr off\n  It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent\n  Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night\n  Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms\n  Of CHAOS blustring round, inclement skie;\n  Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n\n  Though distant farr som small reflection gaines\n  Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:\n  Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field.\n  As when a Vultur on IMAUS bred,\n  Whose snowie ridge the roving TARTAR bounds,\n  Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey\n  To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids\n  On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs\n  Of GANGES or HYDASPES, INDIAN streams;\n  But in his way lights on the barren plaines\n  Of SERICANA, where CHINESES drive\n  With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:\n  So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend\n  Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey,\n  Alone, for other Creature in this place\n  Living or liveless to be found was none,\n  None yet, but store hereafter from the earth\n  Up hither like Aereal vapours flew\n  Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin\n  With vanity had filld the works of men:\n  Both all things vain, and all who in vain things\n  Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,\n  Or happiness in this or th' other life;\n  All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits\n  Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,\n  Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find\n  Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;\n  All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,\n  Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,\n  Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,\n  Till final dissolution, wander here,\n  Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;\n  Those argent Fields more likely habitants,\n  Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold\n  Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde:\n  Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born\n  First from the ancient World those Giants came\n  With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:\n  The builders next of BABEL on the Plain\n  Of SENNAAR, and still with vain designe\n  New BABELS, had they wherewithall, would build:\n  Others came single; hee who to be deemd\n  A God, leap'd fondly into AETNA flames,\n  EMPEDOCLES, and hee who to enjoy\n  PLATO'S ELYSIUM, leap'd into the Sea,\n  CLEOMBROTUS, and many more too long,\n  Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers\n  White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.\n  Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek\n  In GOLGOTHA him dead, who lives in Heav'n;\n  And they who to be sure of Paradise\n  Dying put on the weeds of DOMINIC,\n  Or in FRANCISCAN think to pass disguis'd;\n  They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,\n  And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs\n  The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd;\n  And now Saint PETER at Heav'ns Wicket seems\n  To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot\n  Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe\n  A violent cross wind from either Coast\n  Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry\n  Into the devious Air; then might ye see\n  Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost\n  And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,\n  Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,\n  The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft\n  Fly o're the backside of the World farr off\n  Into a LIMBO large and broad, since calld\n  The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown\n  Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod;\n  All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd,\n  And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame\n  Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste\n  His travell'd steps; farr distant hee descries\n  Ascending by degrees magnificent\n  Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,\n  At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd\n  The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate\n  With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold\n  Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes\n  The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth\n  By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.\n  The Stairs were such as whereon JACOB saw\n  Angels ascending and descending, bands\n  Of Guardians bright, when he from ESAU fled\n  To PADAN-ARAM in the field of LUZ,\n  Dreaming by night under the open Skie,\n  And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n.\n  Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood\n  There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes\n  Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd\n  Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon\n  Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd,\n  Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake\n  Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.\n  The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare\n  The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate\n  His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.\n  Direct against which op'nd from beneath,\n  Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise,\n  A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide,\n  Wider by farr then that of after-times\n  Over Mount SION, and, though that were large,\n  Over the PROMIS'D LAND to God so dear,\n  By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,\n  On high behests his Angels to and fro\n  Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard\n  From PANEAS the fount of JORDANS flood\n  To BEERSABA, where the HOLY LAND\n  Borders on AEGYPT and the ARABIAN shoare;\n  So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set\n  To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.\n  SATAN from hence now on the lower stair\n  That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate\n  Looks down with wonder at the sudden view\n  Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout\n  Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone\n  All night; at last by break of chearful dawne\n  Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,\n  Which to his eye discovers unaware\n  The goodly prospect of some forein land\n  First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis\n  With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,\n  Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.\n  Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen,\n  The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd\n  At sight of all this World beheld so faire.\n  Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood\n  So high above the circling Canopie\n  Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point\n  Of LIBRA to the fleecie Starr that bears\n  ANDROMEDA farr off ATLANTICK Seas\n  Beyond th' HORIZON; then from Pole to Pole\n  He views in bredth, and without longer pause\n  Down right into the Worlds first Region throws\n  His flight precipitant, and windes with ease\n  Through the pure marble Air his oblique way\n  Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon\n  Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,\n  Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,\n  Like those HESPERIAN Gardens fam'd of old,\n  Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,\n  Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there\n  He stayd not to enquire: above them all\n  The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven\n  Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends\n  Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe\n  By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,\n  Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie\n  Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,\n  That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,\n  Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move\n  Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute\n  Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp\n  Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd\n  By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms\n  The Univers, and to each inward part\n  With gentle penetration, though unseen,\n  Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:\n  So wondrously was set his Station bright.\n  There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps\n  Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe\n  Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw.\n  The place he found beyond expression bright,\n  Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;\n  Not all parts like, but all alike informd\n  With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;\n  If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;\n  If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,\n  Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon\n  In AARONS Brest-plate, and a stone besides\n  Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,\n  That stone, or like to that which here below\n  Philosophers in vain so long have sought,\n  In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde\n  Volatil HERMES, and call up unbound\n  In various shapes old PROTEUS from the Sea,\n  Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.\n  What wonder then if fields and regions here\n  Breathe forth ELIXIR pure, and Rivers run\n  Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch\n  Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote\n  Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt\n  Here in the dark so many precious things\n  Of colour glorious and effect so rare?\n  Here matter new to gaze the Devil met\n  Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands,\n  For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,\n  But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon\n  Culminate from th' AEQUATOR, as they now\n  Shot upward still direct, whence no way round\n  Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,\n  No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray\n  To objects distant farr, whereby he soon\n  Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,\n  The same whom JOHN saw also in the Sun:\n  His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;\n  Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar\n  Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind\n  Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings\n  Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd\n  Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.\n  Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope\n  To find who might direct his wandring flight\n  To Paradise the happie seat of Man,\n  His journies end and our beginning woe.\n  But first he casts to change his proper shape,\n  Which else might work him danger or delay:\n  And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,\n  Not of the prime, yet such as in his face\n  Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb\n  Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd;\n  Under a Coronet his flowing haire\n  In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore\n  Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold,\n  His habit fit for speed succinct, and held\n  Before his decent steps a Silver wand.\n  He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,\n  Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,\n  Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known\n  Th' Arch-Angel URIEL, one of the seav'n\n  Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne\n  Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes\n  That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth\n  Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,\n  O're Sea and Land: him SATAN thus accostes;\n\n    URIEL, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand\n  In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright,\n  The first art wont his great authentic will\n  Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring,\n  Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;\n  And here art likeliest by supream decree\n  Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye\n  To visit oft this new Creation round;\n  Unspeakable desire to see, and know\n  All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,\n  His chief delight and favour, him for whom\n  All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,\n  Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim\n  Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell\n  In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man\n  His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,\n  But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;\n  That I may find him, and with secret gaze,\n  Or open admiration him behold\n  On whom the great Creator hath bestowd\n  Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;\n  That both in him and all things, as is meet,\n  The Universal Maker we may praise;\n  Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes\n  To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss\n  Created this new happie Race of Men\n  To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.\n\n    So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;\n  For neither Man nor Angel can discern\n  Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks\n  Invisible, except to God alone,\n  By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth:\n  And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps\n  At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie\n  Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill\n  Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd\n  URIEL, though Regent of the Sun, and held\n  The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n;\n  Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule\n  In his uprightness answer thus returnd.\n  Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know\n  The works of God, thereby to glorifie\n  The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess\n  That reaches blame, but rather merits praise\n  The more it seems excess, that led thee hither\n  From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,\n  To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps\n  Contented with report heare onely in heav'n:\n  For wonderful indeed are all his works,\n  Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all\n  Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;\n  But what created mind can comprehend\n  Thir number, or the wisdom infinite\n  That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.\n  I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,\n  This worlds material mould, came to a heap:\n  Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar\n  Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd;\n  Till at his second bidding darkness fled,\n  Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:\n  Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then\n  The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,\n  And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n\n  Flew upward, spirited with various forms,\n  That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs\n  Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;\n  Each had his place appointed, each his course,\n  The rest in circuit walles this Universe.\n  Look downward on that Globe whose hither side\n  With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;\n  That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light\n  His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere\n  Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon\n  (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide\n  Timely interposes, and her monthly round\n  Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n;\n  With borrowd light her countenance triform\n  Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth,\n  And in her pale dominion checks the night.\n  That spot to which I point is PARADISE,\n  ADAMS abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.\n  Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.\n\n    Thus said, he turnd, and SATAN bowing low,\n  As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,\n  Where honour due and reverence none neglects,\n  Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,\n  Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success,\n  Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,\n  Nor staid, till on NIPHATES top he lights.\n\n       THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK IV.\n\n  O For that warning voice, which he who saw\n  Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud,\n  Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,\n  Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,\n  WO TO THE INHABITANTS ON EARTH! that now,\n  While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd\n  The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd\n  Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now\n  SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,\n  The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,\n  To wreck on innocent frail man his loss\n  Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:\n  Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,\n  Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,\n  Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth\n  Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,\n  And like a devillish Engine back recoiles\n  Upon himself; horror and doubt distract\n  His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr\n  The Hell within him, for within him Hell\n  He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell\n  One step no more then from himself can fly\n  By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair\n  That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie\n  Of what he was, what is, and what must be\n  Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.\n  Sometimes towards EDEN which now in his view\n  Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,\n  Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,\n  Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:\n  Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.\n\n    O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,\n  Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God\n  Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs\n  Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,\n  But with no friendly voice, and add thy name\n  O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams\n  That bring to my remembrance from what state\n  I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;\n  Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down\n  Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King:\n  Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return\n  From me, whom he created what I was\n  In that bright eminence, and with his good\n  Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.\n  What could be less then to afford him praise,\n  The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,\n  How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,\n  And wrought but malice; lifted up so high\n  I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher\n  Would set me highest, and in a moment quit\n  The debt immense of endless gratitude,\n  So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;\n  Forgetful what from him I still receivd,\n  And understood not that a grateful mind\n  By owing owes not, but still pays, at once\n  Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?\n  O had his powerful Destiny ordaind\n  Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood\n  Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd\n  Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power\n  As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean\n  Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great\n  Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within\n  Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.\n  Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?\n  Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,\n  But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all?\n  Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,\n  To me alike, it deals eternal woe.\n  Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will\n  Chose freely what it now so justly rues.\n  Me miserable! which way shall I flie\n  Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?\n  Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;\n  And in the lowest deep a lower deep\n  Still threatning to devour me opens wide,\n  To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.\n  O then at last relent: is there no place\n  Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?\n  None left but by submission; and that word\n  DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame\n  Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd\n  With other promises and other vaunts\n  Then to submit, boasting I could subdue\n  Th' Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know\n  How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,\n  Under what torments inwardly I groane;\n  While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,\n  With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd\n  The lower still I fall, onely Supream\n  In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.\n  But say I could repent and could obtaine\n  By Act of Grace my former state; how soon\n  Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay\n  What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant\n  Vows made in pain, as violent and void.\n  For never can true reconcilement grow\n  Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep:\n  Which would but lead me to a worse relapse\n  And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare\n  Short intermission bought with double smart.\n  This knows my punisher; therefore as farr\n  From granting hee, as I from begging peace:\n  All hope excluded thus, behold in stead\n  Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,\n  Mankind created, and for him this World.\n  So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,\n  Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;\n  Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least\n  Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold\n  By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;\n  As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.\n\n    Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face\n  Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair,\n  Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid\n  Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.\n  For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule\n  Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware,\n  Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme,\n  Artificer of fraud; and was the first\n  That practisd falshood under saintly shew,\n  Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge:\n  Yet not anough had practisd to deceive\n  URIEL once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down\n  The way he went, and on th' ASSYRIAN mount\n  Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall\n  Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce\n  He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,\n  As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen.\n  So on he fares, and to the border comes\n  Of EDEN, where delicious Paradise,\n  Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,\n  As with a rural mound the champain head\n  Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides\n  With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,\n  Access deni'd; and over head up grew\n  Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,\n  Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,\n  A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend\n  Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre\n  Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops\n  The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:\n  Which to our general Sire gave prospect large\n  Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.\n  And higher then that Wall a circling row\n  Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,\n  Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue\n  Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:\n  On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams\n  Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,\n  When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd\n  That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire\n  Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires\n  Vernal delight and joy, able to drive\n  All sadness but despair: now gentle gales\n  Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense\n  Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole\n  Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile\n  Beyond the CAPE OF HOPE, and now are past\n  MOZAMBIC, off at Sea North-East windes blow\n  SABEAN Odours from the spicie shoare\n  Of ARABIE the blest, with such delay\n  Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League\n  Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.\n  So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend\n  Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd\n  Then ASMODEUS with the fishie fume,\n  That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse\n  Of TOBITS Son, and with a vengeance sent\n  From MEDIA post to AEGYPT, there fast bound.\n\n    Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill\n  SATAN had journied on, pensive and slow;\n  But further way found none, so thick entwin'd,\n  As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth\n  Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext\n  All path of Man or Beast that past that way:\n  One Gate there onely was, and that look'd East\n  On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw\n  Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,\n  At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound\n  Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within\n  Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe,\n  Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,\n  Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve\n  In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure,\n  Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:\n  Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash\n  Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,\n  Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,\n  In at the window climbes, or o're the tiles;\n  So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:\n  So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.\n  Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,\n  The middle Tree and highest there that grew,\n  Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life\n  Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death\n  To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought\n  Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd\n  For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge\n  Of immortalitie.  So little knows\n  Any, but God alone, to value right\n  The good before him, but perverts best things\n  To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.\n  Beneath him with new wonder now he views\n  To all delight of human sense expos'd\n  In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,\n  A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise\n  Of God the Garden was, by him in the East\n  Of EDEN planted; EDEN stretchd her Line\n  From AURAN Eastward to the Royal Towrs\n  Of great SELEUCIA, built by GRECIAN Kings,\n  Or where the Sons of EDEN long before\n  Dwelt in TELASSAR: in this pleasant soile\n  His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;\n  Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow\n  All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;\n  And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,\n  High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit\n  Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life\n  Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,\n  Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.\n  Southward through EDEN went a River large,\n  Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill\n  Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown\n  That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd\n  Upon the rapid current, which through veins\n  Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,\n  Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill\n  Waterd the Garden; thence united fell\n  Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,\n  Which from his darksom passage now appeers,\n  And now divided into four main Streams,\n  Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme\n  And Country whereof here needs no account,\n  But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,\n  How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,\n  Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,\n  With mazie error under pendant shades\n  Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed\n  Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art\n  In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon\n  Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,\n  Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote\n  The open field, and where the unpierc't shade\n  Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,\n  A happy rural seat of various view;\n  Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,\n  Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde\n  Hung amiable, HESPERIAN Fables true,\n  If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:\n  Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks\n  Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd,\n  Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap\n  Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,\n  Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:\n  Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves\n  Of coole recess, o're which the mantling Vine\n  Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps\n  Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall\n  Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,\n  That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,\n  Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.\n  The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,\n  Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune\n  The trembling leaves, while Universal PAN\n  Knit with the GRACES and the HOURS in dance\n  Led on th' Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field\n  Of ENNA, where PROSERPIN gathring flours\n  Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie DIS\n  Was gatherd, which cost CERES all that pain\n  To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove\n  Of DAPHNE by ORONTES, and th' inspir'd\n  CASTALIAN Spring might with this Paradise\n  Of EDEN strive; nor that NYSEIAN Ile\n  Girt with the River TRITON, where old CHAM,\n  Whom Gentiles AMMON call and LIBYAN JOVE,\n  Hid AMALTHEA and her Florid Son\n  Young BACCHUS from his Stepdame RHEA'S eye;\n  Nor where ABASSIN Kings thir issue Guard,\n  Mount AMARA, though this by som suppos'd\n  True Paradise under the ETHIOP Line\n  By NILUS head, enclos'd with shining Rock,\n  A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote\n  From this ASSYRIAN Garden, where the Fiend\n  Saw undelighted all delight, all kind\n  Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:\n  Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,\n  Godlike erect, with native Honour clad\n  In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,\n  And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine\n  The image of thir glorious Maker shon,\n  Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,\n  Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't;\n  Whence true autoritie in men; though both\n  Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;\n  For contemplation hee and valour formd,\n  For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,\n  Hee for God only, shee for God in him:\n  His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd\n  Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks\n  Round from his parted forelock manly hung\n  Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:\n  Shee as a vail down to the slender waste\n  Her unadorned golden tresses wore\n  Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd\n  As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd\n  Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway,\n  And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,\n  Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,\n  And sweet reluctant amorous delay.\n  Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,\n  Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame\n  Of natures works, honor dishonorable,\n  Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind\n  With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,\n  And banisht from mans life his happiest life,\n  Simplicitie and spotless innocence.\n  So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight\n  Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:\n  So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair\n  That ever since in loves imbraces met,\n  ADAM the goodliest man of men since borne\n  His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters EVE.\n  Under a tuft of shade that on a green\n  Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side\n  They sat them down, and after no more toil\n  Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd\n  To recommend coole ZEPHYR, and made ease\n  More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite\n  More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,\n  Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes\n  Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline\n  On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:\n  The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde\n  Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;\n  Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles\n  Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems\n  Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,\n  Alone as they.  About them frisking playd\n  All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase\n  In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;\n  Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw\n  Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards\n  Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant\n  To make them mirth us'd all his might, & wreathd\n  His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly\n  Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine\n  His breaded train, and of his fatal guile\n  Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass\n  Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,\n  Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun\n  Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer\n  To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale\n  Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:\n  When SATAN still in gaze, as first he stood,\n  Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.\n\n    O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,\n  Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't\n  Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,\n  Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright\n  Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue\n  With wonder, and could love, so lively shines\n  In them Divine resemblance, and such grace\n  The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.\n  Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh\n  Your change approaches, when all these delights\n  Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,\n  More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;\n  Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd\n  Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n\n  Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe\n  As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe\n  To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne\n  Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,\n  And mutual amitie so streight, so close,\n  That I with you must dwell, or you with me\n  Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please\n  Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such\n  Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,\n  Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,\n  To entertain you two, her widest Gates,\n  And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,\n  Not like these narrow limits, to receive\n  Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,\n  Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge\n  On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.\n  And should I at your harmless innocence\n  Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,\n  Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd,\n  By conquering this new World, compels me now\n  To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.\n\n    So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,\n  The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.\n  Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree\n  Down he alights among the sportful Herd\n  Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,\n  Now other, as thir shape servd best his end\n  Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd\n  To mark what of thir state he more might learn\n  By word or action markt: about them round\n  A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,\n  Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi'd\n  In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,\n  Strait couches close, then rising changes oft\n  His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground\n  Whence rushing he might surest seise them both\n  Grip't in each paw: when ADAM first of men\n  To first of women EVE thus moving speech,\n  Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.\n\n    Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,\n  Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power\n  That made us, and for us this ample World\n  Be infinitly good, and of his good\n  As liberal and free as infinite,\n  That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here\n  In all this happiness, who at his hand\n  Have nothing merited, nor can performe\n  Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires\n  From us no other service then to keep\n  This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees\n  In Paradise that beare delicious fruit\n  So various, not to taste that onely Tree\n  Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,\n  So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,\n  Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst\n  God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree,\n  The only sign of our obedience left\n  Among so many signes of power and rule\n  Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n\n  Over all other Creatures that possesse\n  Earth, Aire, and Sea.  Then let us not think hard\n  One easie prohibition, who enjoy\n  Free leave so large to all things else, and choice\n  Unlimited of manifold delights:\n  But let us ever praise him, and extoll\n  His bountie, following our delightful task\n  To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours,\n  Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.\n\n    To whom thus Eve repli'd.  O thou for whom\n  And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,\n  And without whom am to no end, my Guide\n  And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.\n  For wee to him indeed all praises owe,\n  And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy\n  So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee\n  Preeminent by so much odds, while thou\n  Like consort to thy self canst no where find.\n  That day I oft remember, when from sleep\n  I first awak't, and found my self repos'd\n  Under a shade on flours, much wondring where\n  And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.\n  Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound\n  Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread\n  Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd\n  Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went\n  With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe\n  On the green bank, to look into the cleer\n  Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.\n  As I bent down to look, just opposite,\n  A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd\n  Bending to look on me, I started back,\n  It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,\n  Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks\n  Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt\n  Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,\n  Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,\n  What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,\n  With thee it came and goes: but follow me,\n  And I will bring thee where no shadow staies\n  Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee\n  Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy\n  Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare\n  Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd\n  Mother of human Race: what could I doe,\n  But follow strait, invisibly thus led?\n  Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall,\n  Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,\n  Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,\n  Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,\n  Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair EVE,\n  Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art,\n  His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent\n  Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart\n  Substantial Life, to have thee by my side\n  Henceforth an individual solace dear;\n  Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim\n  My other half: with that thy gentle hand\n  Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see\n  How beauty is excelld by manly grace\n  And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.\n\n    So spake our general Mother, and with eyes\n  Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd,\n  And meek surrender, half imbracing leand\n  On our first Father, half her swelling Breast\n  Naked met his under the flowing Gold\n  Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight\n  Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms\n  Smil'd with superior Love, as JUPITER\n  On JUNO smiles, when he impregns the Clouds\n  That shed MAY Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip\n  With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd\n  For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne\n  Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind.\n\n    Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two\n  Imparadis't in one anothers arms\n  The happier EDEN, shall enjoy thir fill\n  Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,\n  Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,\n  Among our other torments not the least,\n  Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines;\n  Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd\n  From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:\n  One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd,\n  Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n?\n  Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord\n  Envie them that? can it be sin to know,\n  Can it be death? and do they onely stand\n  By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,\n  The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?\n  O fair foundation laid whereon to build\n  Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds\n  With more desire to know, and to reject\n  Envious commands, invented with designe\n  To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt\n  Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,\n  They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?\n  But first with narrow search I must walk round\n  This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd;\n  A chance but chance may lead where I may meet\n  Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side,\n  Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw\n  What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,\n  Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,\n  Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.\n\n    So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd,\n  But with sly circumspection, and began\n  Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam.\n  Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n\n  With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun\n  Slowly descended, and with right aspect\n  Against the eastern Gate of Paradise\n  Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock\n  Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds,\n  Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent\n  Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;\n  The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung\n  Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.\n  Betwixt these rockie Pillars GABRIEL sat\n  Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night;\n  About him exercis'd Heroic Games\n  Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand\n  Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares\n  Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.\n  Thither came URIEL, gliding through the Eeven\n  On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr\n  In AUTUMN thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd\n  Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner\n  From what point of his Compass to beware\n  Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.\n\n    GABRIEL, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n\n  Charge and strict watch that to this happie place\n  No evil thing approach or enter in;\n  This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare\n  A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know\n  More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man\n  Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way\n  Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;\n  But in the Mount that lies from EDEN North,\n  Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks\n  Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd:\n  Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade\n  Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew\n  I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise\n  New troubles; him thy care must be to find.\n\n    To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:\n  URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight,\n  Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,\n  See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass\n  The vigilance here plac't, but such as come\n  Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour\n  No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,\n  So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds\n  On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude\n  Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.\n  But if within the circuit of these walks\n  In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom\n  Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.\n\n    So promis'd hee, and URIEL to his charge\n  Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd\n  Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n\n  Beneath th' AZORES; whither the prime Orb,\n  Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd\n  Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth\n  By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there\n  Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold\n  The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:\n  Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray\n  Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;\n  Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,\n  They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests\n  Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;\n  She all night long her amorous descant sung;\n  Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament\n  With living Saphirs: HESPERUS that led\n  The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon\n  Rising in clouded Majestie, at length\n  Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,\n  And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw.\n\n    When ADAM thus to EVE: Fair Consort, th' hour\n  Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest\n  Mind us of like repose, since God hath set\n  Labour and rest, as day and night to men\n  Successive, and the timely dew of sleep\n  Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines\n  Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long\n  Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;\n  Man hath his daily work of body or mind\n  Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,\n  And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies;\n  While other Animals unactive range,\n  And of thir doings God takes no account.\n  Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East\n  With first approach of light, we must be ris'n,\n  And at our pleasant labour, to reform\n  Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,\n  Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,\n  That mock our scant manuring, and require\n  More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:\n  Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,\n  That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,\n  Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;\n  Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.\n\n    To whom thus EVE with perfet beauty adornd.\n  My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst\n  Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains,\n  God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more\n  Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.\n  With thee conversing I forget all time,\n  All seasons and thir change, all please alike.\n  Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,\n  With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun\n  When first on this delightful Land he spreads\n  His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,\n  Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth\n  After soft showers; and sweet the coming on\n  Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night\n  With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,\n  And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train:\n  But neither breath of Morn when she ascends\n  With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun\n  On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,\n  Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,\n  Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night\n  With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,\n  Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.\n  But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom\n  This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?\n\n    To whom our general Ancestor repli'd.\n  Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht EVE,\n  Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,\n  By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land\n  In order, though to Nations yet unborn,\n  Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise;\n  Least total darkness should by Night regaine\n  Her old possession, and extinguish life\n  In Nature and all things, which these soft fires\n  Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate\n  Of various influence foment and warme,\n  Temper or nourish, or in part shed down\n  Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow\n  On Earth, made hereby apter to receive\n  Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.\n  These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,\n  Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,\n  That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise;\n  Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth\n  Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:\n  All these with ceasless praise his works behold\n  Both day and night: how often from the steep\n  Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard\n  Celestial voices to the midnight air,\n  Sole, or responsive each to others note\n  Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands\n  While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk\n  With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds\n  In full harmonic number joind, thir songs\n  Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.\n\n    Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd\n  On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place\n  Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd\n  All things to mans delightful use; the roofe\n  Of thickest covert was inwoven shade\n  Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew\n  Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side\n  ACANTHUS, and each odorous bushie shrub\n  Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,\n  IRIS all hues, Roses, and Gessamin\n  Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought\n  Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,\n  Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay\n  Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone\n  Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here\n  Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;\n  Such was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower\n  More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,\n  PAN or SILVANUS never slept, nor Nymph,\n  Nor FAUNUS haunted.  Here in close recess\n  With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs\n  Espoused EVE deckt first her Nuptial Bed,\n  And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,\n  What day the genial Angel to our Sire\n  Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd,\n  More lovely then PANDORA, whom the Gods\n  Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like\n  In sad event, when to the unwiser Son\n  Of JAPHET brought by HERMES, she ensnar'd\n  Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd\n  On him who had stole JOVES authentic fire.\n\n    Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood,\n  Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd\n  The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav'n\n  Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe\n  And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night,\n  Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,\n  Which we in our appointed work imployd\n  Have finisht happie in our mutual help\n  And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss\n  Ordain'd by thee, and this delicious place\n  For us too large, where thy abundance wants\n  Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.\n  But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race\n  To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll\n  Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,\n  And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.\n\n    This said unanimous, and other Rites\n  Observing none, but adoration pure\n  Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower\n  Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off\n  These troublesom disguises which wee wear,\n  Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene\n  ADAM from his fair Spouse, nor EVE the Rites\n  Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd:\n  Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk\n  Of puritie and place and innocence,\n  Defaming as impure what God declares\n  Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.\n  Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain\n  But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?\n  Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source\n  Of human ofspring, sole proprietie,\n  In Paradise of all things common else.\n  By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men\n  Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee\n  Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,\n  Relations dear, and all the Charities\n  Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.\n  Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,\n  Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,\n  Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,\n  Whose Bed is undefil'd and chast pronounc't,\n  Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd.\n  Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights\n  His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,\n  Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile\n  Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,\n  Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours\n  Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,\n  Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings\n  To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.\n  These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,\n  And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof\n  Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd.  Sleep on,\n  Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek\n  No happier state, and know to know no more.\n\n    Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone\n  Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,\n  And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim\n  Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd\n  To thir night watches in warlike Parade,\n  When GABRIEL to his next in power thus spake.\n\n    UZZIEL, half these draw off, and coast the South\n  With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,\n  Our circuit meets full West.  As flame they part\n  Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.\n  From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld\n  That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.\n\n    ITHURIEL and ZEPHON, with wingd speed\n  Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook,\n  But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,\n  Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.\n  This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd\n  Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen\n  Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd\n  The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:\n  Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.\n\n    So saying, on he led his radiant Files,\n  Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct\n  In search of whom they sought: him there they found\n  Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of EVE;\n  Assaying by his Devilish art to reach\n  The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge\n  Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,\n  Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint\n  Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise\n  Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise\n  At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,\n  Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires\n  Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.\n  Him thus intent ITHURIEL with his Spear\n  Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure\n  Touch of Celestial temper, but returns\n  Of force to its own likeness: up he starts\n  Discoverd and surpriz'd.  As when a spark\n  Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid\n  Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store\n  Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine\n  With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire:\n  So started up in his own shape the Fiend.\n  Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd\n  So sudden to behold the grieslie King;\n  Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.\n\n    Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell\n  Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd,\n  Why satst thou like an enemie in waite\n  Here watching at the head of these that sleep?\n\n    Know ye not then said SATAN, filld with scorn,\n  Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate\n  For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;\n  Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,\n  The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,\n  Why ask ye, and superfluous begin\n  Your message, like to end as much in vain?\n  To whom thus ZEPHON, answering scorn with scorn.\n  Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,\n  Or undiminisht brightness, to be known\n  As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure;\n  That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,\n  Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now\n  Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.\n  But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account\n  To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep\n  This place inviolable, and these from harm.\n\n    So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke\n  Severe in youthful beautie, added grace\n  Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,\n  And felt how awful goodness is, and saw\n  Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd\n  His loss; but chiefly to find here observd\n  His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd\n  Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,\n  Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,\n  Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,\n  Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said ZEPHON bold,\n  Will save us trial what the least can doe\n  Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.\n\n    The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage;\n  But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,\n  Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie\n  He held it vain; awe from above had quelld\n  His heart, not else dismai'd.  Now drew they nigh\n  The western point, where those half-rounding guards\n  Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind\n  Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief\n  GABRIEL from the Front thus calld aloud.\n\n    O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet\n  Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne\n  ITHURIEL and ZEPHON through the shade,\n  And with them comes a third of Regal port,\n  But faded splendor wan; who by his gate\n  And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,\n  Not likely to part hence without contest;\n  Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.\n\n    He scarce had ended, when those two approachd\n  And brief related whom they brought, wher found,\n  How busied, in what form and posture coucht.\n\n    To whom with stern regard thus GABRIEL spake.\n  Why hast thou, SATAN, broke the bounds prescrib'd\n  To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge\n  Of others, who approve not to transgress\n  By thy example, but have power and right\n  To question thy bold entrance on this place;\n  Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those\n  Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?\n\n    To whom thus SATAN with contemptuous brow.\n  GABRIEL, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,\n  And such I held thee; but this question askt\n  Puts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?\n  Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,\n  Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,\n  And boldly venture to whatever place\n  Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change\n  Torment with ease, & soonest recompence\n  Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;\n  To thee no reason; who knowst only good,\n  But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object\n  His will who bound us? let him surer barr\n  His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay\n  In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.\n  The rest is true, they found me where they say;\n  But that implies not violence or harme.\n\n    Thus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov'd,\n  Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd.\n  O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise,\n  Since SATAN fell, whom follie overthrew,\n  And now returns him from his prison scap't,\n  Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise\n  Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither\n  Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd;\n  So wise he judges it to fly from pain\n  However, and to scape his punishment.\n  So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,\n  Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight\n  Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,\n  Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain\n  Can equal anger infinite provok't.\n  But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee\n  Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them\n  Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they\n  Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,\n  The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd\n  To thy deserted host this cause of flight,\n  Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.\n\n    To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.\n  Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,\n  Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood\n  Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide\n  The blasting volied Thunder made all speed\n  And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.\n  But still thy words at random, as before,\n  Argue thy inexperience what behooves\n  From hard assaies and ill successes past\n  A faithful Leader, not to hazard all\n  Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd.\n  I therefore, I alone first undertook\n  To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie\n  This new created World, whereof in Hell\n  Fame is not silent, here in hope to find\n  Better abode, and my afflicted Powers\n  To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;\n  Though for possession put to try once more\n  What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;\n  Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord\n  High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne,\n  And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight.\n\n    To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd.\n  To say and strait unsay, pretending first\n  Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,\n  Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't,\n  SATAN, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,\n  O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd!\n  Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?\n  Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;\n  Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd,\n  Your military obedience, to dissolve\n  Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream?\n  And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem\n  Patron of liberty, who more then thou\n  Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd\n  Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope\n  To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?\n  But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;\n  Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre\n  Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,\n  Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind,\n  And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne\n  The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.\n\n    So threatn'd hee, but SATAN to no threats\n  Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd.\n\n    Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,\n  Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then\n  Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel\n  From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King\n  Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,\n  Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels\n  In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd.\n\n    While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright\n  Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes\n  Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round\n  With ported Spears, as thick as when a field\n  Of CERES ripe for harvest waving bends\n  Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind\n  Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands\n  Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves\n  Prove chaff.  On th' other side SATAN allarm'd\n  Collecting all his might dilated stood,\n  Like TENERIFF or ATLAS unremov'd:\n  His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest\n  Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe\n  What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds\n  Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise\n  In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope\n  Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements\n  At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne\n  With violence of this conflict, had not soon\n  Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray\n  Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen\n  Betwixt ASTREA and the SCORPION signe,\n  Wherein all things created first he weighd,\n  The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire\n  In counterpoise, now ponders all events,\n  Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights\n  The sequel each of parting and of fight;\n  The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;\n  Which GABRIEL spying, thus bespake the Fiend.\n\n    SATAN, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,\n  Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then\n  To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more\n  Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now\n  To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,\n  And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign\n  Where thou art weigh'd, & shown how light, how weak,\n  If thou resist.  The Fiend lookt up and knew\n  His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled\n  Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.\n\n       THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK V.\n\n  Now Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern Clime\n  Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearle,\n  When ADAM wak't, so customd, for his sleep\n  Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,\n  And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound\n  Of leaves and fuming rills, AURORA's fan,\n  Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song\n  Of Birds on every bough; so much the more\n  His wonder was to find unwak'nd EVE\n  With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek,\n  As through unquiet rest: he on his side\n  Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love\n  Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld\n  Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,\n  Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice\n  Milde, as when ZEPHYRUS on FLORA breathes,\n  Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake\n  My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found,\n  Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight,\n  Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field\n  Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring\n  Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,\n  What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed,\n  How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee\n  Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.\n\n    Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye\n  On ADAM, whom imbracing, thus she spake.\n\n    O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\n  My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see\n  Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night,\n  Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd,\n  If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee,\n  Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe,\n  But of offence and trouble, which my mind\n  Knew never till this irksom night; methought\n  Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk\n  With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,\n  Why sleepst thou EVE? now is the pleasant time,\n  The cool, the silent, save where silence yields\n  To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake\n  Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes\n  Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light\n  Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,\n  If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes,\n  Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,\n  In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\n  Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.\n  I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\n  To find thee I directed then my walk;\n  And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways\n  That brought me on a sudden to the Tree\n  Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd,\n  Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:\n  And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood\n  One shap'd & wing'd like one of those from Heav'n\n  By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd\n  Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd;\n  And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd,\n  Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,\n  Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd?\n  Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?\n  Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold\n  Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?\n  This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme\n  He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd\n  At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:\n  But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine,\n  Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,\n  Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit\n  For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\n  And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more\n  Communicated, more abundant growes,\n  The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?\n  Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic EVE,\n  Partake thou also; happie though thou art,\n  Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:\n  Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\n  Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,\n  But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes\n  Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see\n  What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.\n  So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\n  Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part\n  Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell\n  So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought,\n  Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds\n  With him I flew, and underneath beheld\n  The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide\n  And various: wondring at my flight and change\n  To this high exaltation; suddenly\n  My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,\n  And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd\n  To find this but a dream!  Thus EVE her Night\n  Related, and thus ADAM answerd sad.\n\n    Best Image of my self and dearer half,\n  The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\n  Affects me equally; nor can I like\n  This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;\n  Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\n  Created pure.  But know that in the Soule\n  Are many lesser Faculties that serve\n  Reason as chief; among these Fansie next\n  Her office holds; of all external things,\n  Which the five watchful Senses represent,\n  She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,\n  Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames\n  All what we affirm or what deny, and call\n  Our knowledge or opinion; then retires\n  Into her private Cell when Nature rests.\n  Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes\n  To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,\n  Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,\n  Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.\n  Som such resemblances methinks I find\n  Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,\n  But with addition strange; yet be not sad.\n  Evil into the mind of God or Man\n  May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave\n  No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope\n  That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,\n  Waking thou never wilt consent to do.\n  Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks\n  That wont to be more chearful and serene\n  Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,\n  And let us to our fresh imployments rise\n  Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours\n  That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells\n  Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.\n\n    So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,\n  But silently a gentle tear let fall\n  From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;\n  Two other precious drops that ready stood,\n  Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell\n  Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\n  And pious awe, that feard to have offended.\n\n    So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.\n  But first from under shadie arborous roof,\n  Soon as they forth were come to open sight\n  Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen\n  With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim,\n  Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,\n  Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East\n  Of Paradise and EDENS happie Plains,\n  Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began\n  Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid\n  In various style, for neither various style\n  Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise\n  Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung\n  Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence\n  Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,\n  More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp\n  To add more sweetness, and they thus began.\n\n    These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\n  Almightie, thine this universal Frame,\n  Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!\n  Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens\n  To us invisible or dimly seen\n  In these thy lowest works, yet these declare\n  Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:\n  Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,\n  Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs\n  And choral symphonies, Day without Night,\n  Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n,\n  On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll\n  Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.\n  Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,\n  If better thou belong not to the dawn,\n  Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn\n  With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare\n  While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.\n  Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,\n  Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise\n  In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,\n  And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst.\n  Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st\n  With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,\n  And yee five other wandring Fires that move\n  In mystic Dance not without Song, resound\n  His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light.\n  Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth\n  Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run\n  Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix\n  And nourish all things, let your ceasless change\n  Varie to our great Maker still new praise.\n  Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise\n  From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,\n  Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,\n  In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,\n  Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,\n  Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,\n  Rising or falling still advance his praise.\n  His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,\n  Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,\n  With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.\n  Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,\n  Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\n  Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,\n  That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,\n  Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;\n  Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk\n  The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\n  Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,\n  To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade\n  Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.\n  Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still\n  To give us onely good; and if the night\n  Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,\n  Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.\n\n    So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts\n  Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.\n  On to thir mornings rural work they haste\n  Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row\n  Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr\n  Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check\n  Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine\n  To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines\n  Her mariageable arms, and with her brings\n  Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn\n  His barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld\n  With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd\n  RAPHAEL, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd\n  To travel with TOBIAS, and secur'd\n  His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.\n\n    RAPHAEL, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth\n  SATAN from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf\n  Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd\n  This night the human pair, how he designes\n  In them at once to ruin all mankind.\n  Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend\n  Converse with ADAM, in what Bowre or shade\n  Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd,\n  To respit his day-labour with repast,\n  Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,\n  As may advise him of his happie state,\n  Happiness in his power left free to will,\n  Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,\n  Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware\n  He swerve not too secure: tell him withall\n  His danger, and from whom, what enemie\n  Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now\n  The fall of others from like state of bliss;\n  By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,\n  But by deceit and lies; this let him know,\n  Least wilfully transgressing he pretend\n  Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.\n\n    So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld\n  All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint\n  After his charge receivd, but from among\n  Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood\n  Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light\n  Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires\n  On each hand parting, to his speed gave way\n  Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate\n  Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide\n  On golden Hinges turning, as by work\n  Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd.\n  From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\n  Starr interpos'd, however small he sees,\n  Not unconform to other shining Globes,\n  Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd\n  Above all Hills.  As when by night the Glass\n  Of GALILEO, less assur'd, observes\n  Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:\n  Or Pilot from amidst the CYCLADES\n  DELOS or SAMOS first appeering kenns\n  A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\n  He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie\n  Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing\n  Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann\n  Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare\n  Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems\n  A PHOENIX, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird\n  When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's\n  Bright Temple, to AEGYPTIAN THEB'S he flies.\n  At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise\n  He lights, and to his proper shape returns\n  A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade\n  His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad\n  Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest\n  With regal Ornament; the middle pair\n  Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round\n  Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold\n  And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet\n  Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile\n  Skie-tinctur'd grain.  Like MAIA'S son he stood,\n  And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld\n  The circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands\n  Of Angels under watch; and to his state,\n  And to his message high in honour rise;\n  For on som message high they guessd him bound.\n  Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come\n  Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,\n  And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;\n  A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\n  Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will\n  Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,\n  Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.\n  Him through the spicie Forrest onward com\n  ADAM discernd, as in the dore he sat\n  Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun\n  Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme\n  Earths inmost womb, more warmth then ADAM need;\n  And EVE within, due at her hour prepar'd\n  For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please\n  True appetite, and not disrelish thirst\n  Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,\n  Berrie or Grape: to whom thus ADAM call'd.\n\n    Haste hither EVE, and worth thy sight behold\n  Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape\n  Comes this way moving; seems another Morn\n  Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n\n  To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe\n  This day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed,\n  And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure\n  Abundance, fit to honour and receive\n  Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford\n  Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow\n  From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies\n  Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows\n  More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\n\n    To whom thus EVE. ADAM, earths hallowd mould,\n  Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store,\n  All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\n  Save what by frugal storing firmness gains\n  To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\n  But I will haste and from each bough and break,\n  Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice\n  To entertain our Angel guest, as hee\n  Beholding shall confess that here on Earth\n  God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n.\n\n    So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\n  She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\n  What choice to chuse for delicacie best,\n  What order, so contriv'd as not to mix\n  Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring\n  Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,\n  Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\n  Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds\n  In INDIA East or West, or middle shoare\n  In PONTUS or the PUNIC Coast, or where\n  ALCINOUS reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,\n  Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell\n  She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board\n  Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape\n  She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes\n  From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest\n  She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold\n  Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground\n  With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.\n  Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet\n  His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train\n  Accompani'd then with his own compleat\n  Perfections, in himself was all his state,\n  More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits\n  On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long\n  Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold\n  Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.\n  Neerer his presence ADAM though not awd,\n  Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\n  As to a superior Nature, bowing low,\n\n    Thus said.  Native of Heav'n, for other place\n  None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain;\n  Since by descending from the Thrones above,\n  Those happie places thou hast deignd a while\n  To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us\n  Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess\n  This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre\n  To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears\n  To sit and taste, till this meridian heat\n  Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.\n\n    Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.\n  ADAM, I therefore came, nor art thou such\n  Created, or such place hast here to dwell,\n  As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n\n  To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre\n  Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise\n  I have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge\n  They came, that like POMONA'S Arbour smil'd\n  With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but EVE\n  Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair\n  Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd\n  Of three that in Mount IDA naked strove,\n  Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile\n  Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme\n  Alterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel HAILE\n  Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd\n  Long after to blest MARIE, second EVE.\n\n    Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb\n  Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons\n  Then with these various fruits the Trees of God\n  Have heap'd this Table.  Rais'd of grassie terf\n  Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,\n  And on her ample Square from side to side\n  All AUTUMN pil'd, though SPRING and AUTUMN here\n  Danc'd hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\n  No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began\n  Our Authour.  Heav'nly stranger, please to taste\n  These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom\n  All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends,\n  To us for food and for delight hath caus'd\n  The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps\n  To spiritual Natures; only this I know,\n  That one Celestial Father gives to all.\n\n    To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\n  (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part\n  Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\n  No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure\n  Intelligential substances require\n  As doth your Rational; and both contain\n  Within them every lower facultie\n  Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\n  Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\n  And corporeal to incorporeal turn.\n  For know, whatever was created, needs\n  To be sustaind and fed; of Elements\n  The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\n  Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires\n  Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;\n  Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd\n  Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.\n  Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale\n  From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.\n  The Sun that light imparts to all, receives\n  From all his alimental recompence\n  In humid exhalations, and at Even\n  Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees\n  Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines\n  Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn\n  We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground\n  Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here\n  Varied his bounty so with new delights,\n  As may compare with Heaven; and to taste\n  Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\n  And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly\n  The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\n  Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch\n  Of real hunger, and concoctive heate\n  To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires\n  Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire\n  Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist\n  Can turn, or holds it possible to turn\n  Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold\n  As from the Mine.  Mean while at Table EVE\n  Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups\n  With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence\n  Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,\n  Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin\n  Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts\n  Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie\n  Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell.\n\n    Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd,\n  Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose\n  In ADAM, not to let th' occasion pass\n  Given him by this great Conference to know\n  Of things above his World, and of thir being\n  Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw\n  Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms\n  Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far\n  Exceeded human, and his wary speech\n  Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd.\n\n    Inhabitant with God, now know I well\n  Thy favour, in this honour done to man,\n  Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't\n  To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\n  Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,\n  As that more willingly thou couldst not seem\n  At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?\n\n     To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd.\n  O ADAM, one Almightie is, from whom\n  All things proceed, and up to him return,\n  If not deprav'd from good, created all\n  Such to perfection, one first matter all,\n  Indu'd with various forms, various degrees\n  Of substance, and in things that live, of life;\n  But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure,\n  As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending\n  Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,\n  Till body up to spirit work, in bounds\n  Proportiond to each kind.  So from the root\n  Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\n  More aerie, last the bright consummate floure\n  Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit\n  Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd\n  To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,\n  To intellectual, give both life and sense,\n  Fansie and understanding, whence the soule\n  Reason receives, and reason is her being,\n  Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse\n  Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\n  Differing but in degree, of kind the same.\n  Wonder not then, what God for you saw good\n  If I refuse not, but convert, as you,\n  To proper substance; time may come when men\n  With Angels may participate, and find\n  No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:\n  And from these corporal nutriments perhaps\n  Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit\n  Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend\n  Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice\n  Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell;\n  If ye be found obedient, and retain\n  Unalterably firm his love entire\n  Whose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy\n  Your fill what happiness this happie state\n  Can comprehend, incapable of more.\n\n    To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd.\n  O favourable spirit, propitious guest,\n  Well hast thou taught the way that might direct\n  Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set\n  From center to circumference, whereon\n  In contemplation of created things\n  By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\n  What meant that caution joind, IF YE BE FOUND\n  OBEDIENT? can wee want obedience then\n  To him, or possibly his love desert\n  Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here\n  Full to the utmost measure of what bliss\n  Human desires can seek or apprehend?\n\n    To whom the Angel.  Son of Heav'n and Earth,\n  Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;\n  That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,\n  That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\n  This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd.\n  God made thee perfet, not immutable;\n  And good he made thee, but to persevere\n  He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will\n  By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate\n  Inextricable, or strict necessity;\n  Our voluntarie service he requires,\n  Not our necessitated, such with him\n  Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how\n  Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve\n  Willing or no, who will but what they must\n  By Destinie, and can no other choose?\n  My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand\n  In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state\n  Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\n  On other surety none; freely we serve.\n  Because wee freely love, as in our will\n  To love or not; in this we stand or fall:\n  And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n,\n  And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall\n  From what high state of bliss into what woe!\n\n    To whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words\n  Attentive, and with more delighted eare\n  Divine instructer, I have heard, then when\n  Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills\n  Aereal Music send: nor knew I not\n  To be both will and deed created free;\n  Yet that we never shall forget to love\n  Our maker, and obey him whose command\n  Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts\n  Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst\n  Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move,\n  But more desire to hear, if thou consent,\n  The full relation, which must needs be strange,\n  Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;\n  And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun\n  Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins\n  His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n.\n\n    Thus ADAM made request, and RAPHAEL\n  After short pause assenting, thus began.\n\n    High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,\n  Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate\n  To human sense th' invisible exploits\n  Of warring Spirits; how without remorse\n  The ruin of so many glorious once\n  And perfet while they stood; how last unfould\n  The secrets of another world, perhaps\n  Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\n  This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach\n  Of human sense, I shall delineate so,\n  By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms,\n  As may express them best, though what if Earth\n  Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein\n  Each to other like, more then on earth is thought?\n\n    As yet this world was not, and CHAOS wilde\n  Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests\n  Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day\n  (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd\n  To motion, measures all things durable\n  By present, past, and future) on such day\n  As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host\n  Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd,\n  Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne\n  Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd\n  Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright\n  Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd,\n  Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare\n  Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve\n  Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;\n  Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd\n  Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love\n  Recorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes\n  Of circuit inexpressible they stood,\n  Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,\n  By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son,\n  Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop\n  Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.\n\n    Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,\n  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\n  Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand.\n  This day I have begot whom I declare\n  My onely Son, and on this holy Hill\n  Him have anointed, whom ye now behold\n  At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;\n  And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow\n  All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord:\n  Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide\n  United as one individual Soule\n  For ever happie: him who disobeyes\n  Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day\n  Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls\n  Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place\n  Ordaind without redemption, without end.\n\n    So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words\n  All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all.\n  That day, as other solem dayes, they spent\n  In song and dance about the sacred Hill,\n  Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare\n  Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles\n  Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,\n  Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular\n  Then most, when most irregular they seem:\n  And in thir motions harmonie Divine\n  So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear\n  Listens delighted.  Eevning approachd\n  (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,\n  We ours for change delectable, not need)\n  Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\n  Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,\n  Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd\n  With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:\n  In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,\n  Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n.\n  They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet\n  Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd\n  With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.\n  Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd\n  From that high mount of God, whence light & shade\n  Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd\n  To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there\n  In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd\n  All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,\n  Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr\n  Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,\n  (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng\n  Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend\n  By living Streams among the Trees of Life,\n  Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,\n  Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept\n  Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course\n  Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne\n  Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd\n  SATAN, so call him now, his former name\n  Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first,\n  If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,\n  In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught\n  With envie against the Son of God, that day\n  Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd\n  MESSIAH King anointed, could not beare\n  Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.\n  Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain,\n  Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre\n  Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd\n  With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave\n  Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream\n  Contemptuous, and his next subordinate\n  Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake.\n\n    Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close\n  Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree\n  Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips\n  Of Heav'ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts\n  Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\n  Both waking we were one; how then can now\n  Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd;\n  New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\n  In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate\n  What doubtful may ensue, more in this place\n  To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\n  Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;\n  Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night\n  Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\n  And all who under me thir Banners wave,\n  Homeward with flying march where we possess\n  The Quarters of the North, there to prepare\n  Fit entertainment to receive our King\n  The great MESSIAH, and his new commands,\n  Who speedily through all the Hierarchies\n  Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.\n\n    So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd\n  Bad influence into th' unwarie brest\n  Of his Associate; hee together calls,\n  Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,\n  Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,\n  That the most High commanding, now ere Night,\n  Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n,\n  The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;\n  Tells the suggested cause, and casts between\n  Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound\n  Or taint integritie; but all obey'd\n  The wonted signal, and superior voice\n  Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed\n  His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n;\n  His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides\n  The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes\n  Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host:\n  Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes\n  Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount\n  And from within the golden Lamps that burne\n  Nightly before him, saw without thir light\n  Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred\n  Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes\n  Were banded to oppose his high Decree;\n  And smiling to his onely Son thus said.\n\n    Son, thou in whom my glory I behold\n  In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\n  Neerly it now concernes us to be sure\n  Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms\n  We mean to hold what anciently we claim\n  Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe\n  Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne\n  Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;\n  Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie\n  In battel, what our Power is, or our right.\n  Let us advise, and to this hazard draw\n  With speed what force is left, and all imploy\n  In our defence, lest unawares we lose\n  This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.\n\n    To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer\n  Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene,\n  Made answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes\n  Justly hast in derision, and secure\n  Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,\n  Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate\n  Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power\n  Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event\n  Know whether I be dextrous to subdue\n  Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n.\n\n    So spake the Son, but SATAN with his Powers\n  Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host\n  Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,\n  Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun\n  Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.\n  Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies\n  Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones\n  In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which\n  All thy Dominion, ADAM, is no more\n  Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,\n  And all the Sea, from one entire globose\n  Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd\n  At length into the limits of the North\n  They came, and SATAN to his Royal seat\n  High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount\n  Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs\n  From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold,\n  The Palace of great LUCIFER, (so call\n  That Structure in the Dialect of men\n  Interpreted) which not long after, hee\n  Affecting all equality with God,\n  In imitation of that Mount whereon\n  MESSIAH was declar'd in sight of Heav'n,\n  The Mountain of the Congregation call'd;\n  For thither he assembl'd all his Train,\n  Pretending so commanded to consult\n  About the great reception of thir King,\n  Thither to come, and with calumnious Art\n  Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.\n\n    Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,\n  If these magnific Titles yet remain\n  Not meerly titular, since by Decree\n  Another now hath to himself ingross't\n  All Power, and us eclipst under the name\n  Of King anointed, for whom all this haste\n  Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,\n  This onely to consult how we may best\n  With what may be devis'd of honours new\n  Receive him coming to receive from us\n  Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,\n  Too much to one, but double how endur'd,\n  To one and to his image now proclaim'd?\n  But what if better counsels might erect\n  Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?\n  Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend\n  The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust\n  To know ye right, or if ye know your selves\n  Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before\n  By none, and if not equal all, yet free,\n  Equally free; for Orders and Degrees\n  Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.\n  Who can in reason then or right assume\n  Monarchie over such as live by right\n  His equals, if in power and splendor less,\n  In freedome equal? or can introduce\n  Law and Edict on us, who without law\n  Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,\n  And look for adoration to th' abuse\n  Of those Imperial Titles which assert\n  Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve?\n\n    Thus farr his bold discourse without controule\n  Had audience, when among the Seraphim\n  ABDIEL, then whom none with more zeale ador'd\n  The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd,\n  Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe\n  The current of his fury thus oppos'd.\n\n    O argument blasphemous, false and proud!\n  Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n\n  Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate\n  In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.\n  Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne\n  The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn,\n  That to his only Son by right endu'd\n  With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n\n  Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due\n  Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist\n  Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,\n  And equal over equals to let Reigne,\n  One over all with unsucceeded power.\n  Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute\n  With him the points of libertie, who made\n  Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n\n  Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being?\n  Yet by experience taught we know how good,\n  And of our good, and of our dignitie\n  How provident he is, how farr from thought\n  To make us less, bent rather to exalt\n  Our happie state under one Head more neer\n  United.  But to grant it thee unjust,\n  That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:\n  Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count,\n  Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,\n  Equal to him begotten Son, by whom\n  As by his Word the mighty Father made\n  All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n\n  By him created in thir bright degrees,\n  Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd\n  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers\n  Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd,\n  But more illustrious made, since he the Head\n  One of our number thus reduc't becomes,\n  His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done\n  Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\n  And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease\n  Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son,\n  While Pardon may be found in time besought.\n\n    So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale\n  None seconded, as out of season judg'd,\n  Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd\n  Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.\n  That we were formd then saist thou? & the work\n  Of secondarie hands, by task transferd\n  From Father to his Son? strange point and new!\n  Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw\n  When this creation was? rememberst thou\n  Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\n  We know no time when we were not as now;\n  Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd\n  By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course\n  Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature\n  Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons.\n  Our puissance is our own, our own right hand\n  Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\n  Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold\n  Whether by supplication we intend\n  Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne\n  Beseeching or besieging.  This report,\n  These tidings carrie to th' anointed King;\n  And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\n\n    He said, and as the sound of waters deep\n  Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause\n  Through the infinite Host, nor less for that\n  The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\n  Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold.\n\n    O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,\n  Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall\n  Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd\n  In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred\n  Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth\n  No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke\n  Of Gods MESSIAH; those indulgent Laws\n  Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees\n  Against thee are gon forth without recall;\n  That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject\n  Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake\n  Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise,\n  Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly\n  These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth\n  Impendent, raging into sudden flame\n  Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel\n  His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\n  Then who created thee lamenting learne,\n  When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\n\n    So spake the Seraph ABDIEL faithful found,\n  Among the faithless, faithful only hee;\n  Among innumerable false, unmov'd,\n  Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd\n  His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;\n  Nor number, nor example with him wrought\n  To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind\n  Though single.  From amidst them forth he passd,\n  Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind\n  Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught;\n  And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd\n  On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.\n\n       THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK VI.\n\n  All night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd\n  Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,\n  Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand\n  Unbarr'd the gates of Light.  There is a Cave\n  Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,\n  Where light and darkness in perpetual round\n  Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n\n  Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;\n  Light issues forth, and at the other dore\n  Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre\n  To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well\n  Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn\n  Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold\n  Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,\n  Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain\n  Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,\n  Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds\n  Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:\n  Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found\n  Already known what he for news had thought\n  To have reported: gladly then he mixt\n  Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd\n  With joy and acclamations loud, that one\n  That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one\n  Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill\n  They led him high applauded, and present\n  Before the seat supream; from whence a voice\n  From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.\n\n    Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought\n  The better fight, who single hast maintaind\n  Against revolted multitudes the Cause\n  Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;\n  And for the testimonie of Truth hast born\n  Universal reproach, far worse to beare\n  Then violence: for this was all thy care\n  To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds\n  Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now\n  Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,\n  Back on thy foes more glorious to return\n  Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue\n  By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,\n  Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King\n  MESSIAH, who by right of merit Reigns.\n  Goe MICHAEL of Celestial Armies Prince,\n  And thou in Military prowess next\n  GABRIEL, lead forth to Battel these my Sons\n  Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints\n  By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight;\n  Equal in number to that Godless crew\n  Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms\n  Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n\n  Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,\n  Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf\n  Of TARTARUS, which ready opens wide\n  His fiery CHAOS to receave thir fall.\n\n    So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began\n  To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl\n  In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe\n  Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud\n  Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:\n  At which command the Powers Militant,\n  That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn'd\n  Of Union irresistible, mov'd on\n  In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound\n  Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd\n  Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds\n  Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause\n  Of God and his MESSIAH.  On they move\n  Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,\n  Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides\n  Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground\n  Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore\n  Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind\n  Of Birds in orderly array on wing\n  Came summond over EDEN to receive\n  Thir names of thee; so over many a tract\n  Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide\n  Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last\n  Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd\n  From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht\n  In battailous aspect, and neerer view\n  Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable\n  Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields\n  Various, with boastful Argument portraid,\n  The banded Powers of SATAN hasting on\n  With furious expedition; for they weend\n  That self same day by fight, or by surprize\n  To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne\n  To set the envier of his State, the proud\n  Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain\n  In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd\n  At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,\n  And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet\n  So oft in Festivals of joy and love\n  Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire\n  Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout\n  Of Battel now began, and rushing sound\n  Of onset ended soon each milder thought.\n  High in the midst exalted as a God\n  Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate\n  Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd\n  With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;\n  Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now\n  'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,\n  A dreadful interval, and Front to Front\n  Presented stood in terrible array\n  Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,\n  On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd,\n  SATAN with vast and haughtie strides advanc't,\n  Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;\n  ABDIEL that sight endur'd not, where he stood\n  Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,\n  And thus his own undaunted heart explores.\n\n    O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest\n  Should yet remain, where faith and realtie\n  Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might\n  There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove\n  Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?\n  His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide,\n  I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd\n  Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,\n  That he who in debate of Truth hath won,\n  Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike\n  Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,\n  When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so\n  Most reason is that Reason overcome.\n\n    So pondering, and from his armed Peers\n  Forth stepping opposite, half way he met\n  His daring foe, at this prevention more\n  Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd.\n\n    Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht\n  The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd,\n  The Throne of God unguarded, and his side\n  Abandond at the terror of thy Power\n  Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain\n  Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms;\n  Who out of smallest things could without end\n  Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat\n  Thy folly; or with solitarie hand\n  Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow\n  Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd\n  Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest\n  All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith\n  Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then\n  To thee not visible, when I alone\n  Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent\n  From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late\n  How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.\n\n      Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance\n  Thus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre\n  Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst\n  From flight, seditious Angel, to receave\n  Thy merited reward, the first assay\n  Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue\n  Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose\n  A third part of the Gods, in Synod met\n  Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel\n  Vigour Divine within them, can allow\n  Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst\n  Before thy fellows, ambitious to win\n  From me som Plume, that thy success may show\n  Destruction to the rest: this pause between\n  (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;\n  At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n\n  To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now\n  I see that most through sloth had rather serve,\n  Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;\n  Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n,\n  Servilitie with freedom to contend,\n  As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove.\n\n    To whom in brief thus ABDIEL stern repli'd.\n  Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find\n  Of erring, from the path of truth remote:\n  Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name\n  Of SERVITUDE to serve whom God ordains,\n  Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,\n  When he who rules is worthiest, and excells\n  Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,\n  To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld\n  Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,\n  Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd;\n  Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid.\n  Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve\n  In Heav'n God ever blessed, and his Divine\n  Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd,\n  Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while\n  From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,\n  This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.\n\n    So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,\n  Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell\n  On the proud Crest of SATAN, that no sight,\n  Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield\n  Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge\n  He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee\n  His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth\n  Winds under ground or waters forcing way\n  Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat\n  Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis'd\n  The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see\n  Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,\n  Presage of Victorie and fierce desire\n  Of Battel: whereat MICHAEL bid sound\n  Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav'n\n  It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung\n  HOSANNA to the Highest: nor stood at gaze\n  The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd\n  The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,\n  And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now\n  Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd\n  Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles\n  Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise\n  Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss\n  Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,\n  And flying vaulted either Host with fire.\n  Sounder fierie Cope together rush'd\n  Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault\n  And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n\n  Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth\n  Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when\n  Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought\n  On either side, the least of whom could weild\n  These Elements, and arm him with the force\n  Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power\n  Armie against Armie numberless to raise\n  Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,\n  Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;\n  Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent\n  From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd\n  And limited thir might; though numberd such\n  As each divided Legion might have seemd\n  A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand\n  A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd\n  Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert\n  When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway\n  Of Battel, open when, and when to close\n  The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,\n  None of retreat, no unbecoming deed\n  That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd,\n  As onely in his arm the moment lay\n  Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame\n  Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred\n  That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground\n  A standing fight, then soaring on main wing\n  Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then\n  Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale\n  The Battel hung; till SATAN, who that day\n  Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes\n  No equal, raunging through the dire attack\n  Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length\n  Saw where the Sword of MICHAEL smote, and fell'd\n  Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway\n  Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down\n  Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand\n  He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb\n  Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield\n  A vast circumference: At his approach\n  The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile\n  Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end\n  Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd\n  Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown\n  And visage all enflam'd first thus began.\n\n    Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,\n  Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest\n  These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,\n  Though heaviest by just measure on thy self\n  And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd\n  Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought\n  Miserie, uncreated till the crime\n  Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd\n  Thy malice into thousands, once upright\n  And faithful, now prov'd false.  But think not here\n  To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out\n  From all her Confines.  Heav'n the seat of bliss\n  Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.\n  Hence then, and evil go with thee along\n  Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,\n  Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,\n  Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,\n  Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God\n  Precipitate thee with augmented paine.\n\n    So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus\n  The Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind\n  Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds\n  Thou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these\n  To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise\n  Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee\n  That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats\n  To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end\n  The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style\n  The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,\n  Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell\n  Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,\n  If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,\n  And join him nam'd ALMIGHTIE to thy aid,\n  I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.\n\n    They ended parle, and both addrest for fight\n  Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue\n  Of Angels, can relate, or to what things\n  Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift\n  Human imagination to such highth\n  Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,\n  Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms\n  Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n.\n  Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire\n  Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields\n  Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood\n  In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd\n  Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng,\n  And left large field, unsafe within the wind\n  Of such commotion, such as to set forth\n  Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,\n  Among the Constellations warr were sprung,\n  Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne\n  Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,\n  Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.\n  Together both with next to Almightie Arme,\n  Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd\n  That might determine, and not need repeate,\n  As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd\n  In might or swift prevention; but the sword\n  Of MICHAEL from the Armorie of God\n  Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen\n  Nor solid might resist that edge: it met\n  The sword of SATAN with steep force to smite\n  Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,\n  But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd\n  All his right side; then SATAN first knew pain,\n  And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore\n  The griding sword with discontinuous wound\n  Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd\n  Not long divisible, and from the gash\n  A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd\n  Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,\n  And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.\n  Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run\n  By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd\n  Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields\n  Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd\n  From off the files of warr; there they him laid\n  Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame\n  To find himself not matchless, and his pride\n  Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath\n  His confidence to equal God in power.\n  Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout\n  Vital in every part, not as frail man\n  In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,\n  Cannot but by annihilating die;\n  Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound\n  Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:\n  All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,\n  All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,\n  They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size\n  Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.\n\n    Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd\n  Memorial, where the might of GABRIEL fought,\n  And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array\n  Of MOLOC furious King, who him defi'd,\n  And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound\n  Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n\n  Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon\n  Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes\n  And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing\n  URIEL and RAPHAEL his vaunting foe,\n  Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,\n  Vanquish'd ADRAMELEC, and ASMADAI,\n  Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods\n  Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,\n  Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.\n  Nor stood unmindful ABDIEL to annoy\n  The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow\n  ARIEL and ARIOC, and the violence\n  Of RAMIEL scorcht and blasted overthrew.\n  I might relate of thousands, and thir names\n  Eternize here on Earth; but those elect\n  Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n\n  Seek not the praise of men: the other sort\n  In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,\n  Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome\n  Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie,\n  Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.\n  For strength from Truth divided and from Just,\n  Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise\n  And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires\n  Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:\n  Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.\n\n    And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd,\n  With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout\n  Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground\n  With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap\n  Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd\n  And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld\n  Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host\n  Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd,\n  Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine\n  Fled ignominious, to such evil brought\n  By sinne of disobedience, till that hour\n  Not liable to fear or flight or paine.\n  Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints\n  In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire,\n  Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd:\n  Such high advantages thir innocence\n  Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,\n  Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood\n  Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd\n  By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd.\n\n    Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n\n  Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd,\n  And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:\n  Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd,\n  Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field\n  MICHAEL and his Angels prevalent\n  Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round,\n  Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part\n  SATAN with his rebellious disappeerd,\n  Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest,\n  His Potentates to Councel call'd by night;\n  And in the midst thus undismai'd began.\n\n    O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes\n  Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,\n  Found worthy not of Libertie alone,\n  Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,\n  Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,\n  Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight,\n  (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)\n  What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send\n  Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd\n  Sufficient to subdue us to his will,\n  But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,\n  Of future we may deem him, though till now\n  Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly arm'd,\n  Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine,\n  Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,\n  Since now we find this our Empyreal forme\n  Incapable of mortal injurie\n  Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound,\n  Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd.\n  Of evil then so small as easie think\n  The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,\n  Weapons more violent, when next we meet,\n  May serve to better us, and worse our foes,\n  Or equal what between us made the odds,\n  In Nature none: if other hidden cause\n  Left them Superiour, while we can preserve\n  Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,\n  Due search and consultation will disclose.\n\n    He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood\n  NISROC, of Principalities the prime;\n  As one he stood escap't from cruel fight,\n  Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn,\n  And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.\n  Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free\n  Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard\n  For Gods, and too unequal work we find\n  Against unequal armes to fight in paine,\n  Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil\n  Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes\n  Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain\n  Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands\n  Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well\n  Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,\n  But live content, which is the calmest life:\n  But pain is perfet miserie, the worst\n  Of evils, and excessive, overturnes\n  All patience.  He who therefore can invent\n  With what more forcible we may offend\n  Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme\n  Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves\n  No less then for deliverance what we owe.\n\n    Whereto with look compos'd SATAN repli'd.\n  Not uninvented that, which thou aright\n  Beleivst so main to our success, I bring;\n  Which of us who beholds the bright surface\n  Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,\n  This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd\n  With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold,\n  Whose Eye so superficially surveyes\n  These things, as not to mind from whence they grow\n  Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,\n  Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht\n  With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth\n  So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light.\n  These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep\n  Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame,\n  Which into hallow Engins long and round\n  Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire\n  Dilated and infuriate shall send forth\n  From far with thundring noise among our foes\n  Such implements of mischief as shall dash\n  To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands\n  Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd\n  The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.\n  Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,\n  Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;\n  Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind\n  Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.\n  He ended, and his words thir drooping chere\n  Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd.\n  Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee\n  To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd\n  Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought\n  Impossible: yet haply of thy Race\n  In future dayes, if Malice should abound,\n  Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd\n  With dev'lish machination might devise\n  Like instrument to plague the Sons of men\n  For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.\n  Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,\n  None arguing stood, innumerable hands\n  Were ready, in a moment up they turnd\n  Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath\n  Th' originals of Nature in thir crude\n  Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame\n  They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art,\n  Concocted and adusted they reduc'd\n  To blackest grain, and into store conveyd:\n  Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth\n  Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,\n  Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls\n  Of missive ruin; part incentive reed\n  Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.\n  So all ere day spring, under conscious Night\n  Secret they finish'd, and in order set,\n  With silent circumspection unespi'd.\n  Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd\n  Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms\n  The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood\n  Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,\n  Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills\n  Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,\n  Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,\n  Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight,\n  In motion or in alt: him soon they met\n  Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow\n  But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail\n  ZEPHIEL, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,\n  Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd.\n\n    Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,\n  Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit\n  This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud\n  He comes, and settl'd in his face I see\n  Sad resolution and secure: let each\n  His Adamantine coat gird well, and each\n  Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,\n  Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,\n  If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,\n  But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.\n  So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon\n  In order, quit of all impediment;\n  Instant without disturb they took Allarm,\n  And onward move Embattelld; when behold\n  Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe\n  Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube\n  Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd\n  On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,\n  To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood\n  A while, but suddenly at head appeerd\n  SATAN: And thus was heard Commanding loud.\n\n    Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;\n  That all may see who hate us, how we seek\n  Peace and composure, and with open brest\n  Stand readie to receive them, if they like\n  Our overture, and turn not back perverse;\n  But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,\n  Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge\n  Freely our part: yee who appointed stand\n  Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch\n  What we propound, and loud that all may hear.\n\n    So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce\n  Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front\n  Divided, and to either Flank retir'd.\n  Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,\n  A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid\n  On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd\n  Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr\n  With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd)\n  Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes\n  With hideous orifice gap't on us wide,\n  Portending hollow truce; at each behind\n  A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed\n  Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,\n  Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd,\n  Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds\n  Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd\n  With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,\n  But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd,\n  From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar\n  Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,\n  And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule\n  Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail\n  Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host\n  Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote,\n  That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,\n  Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell\n  By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd;\n  The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might\n  Have easily as Spirits evaded swift\n  By quick contraction or remove; but now\n  Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout;\n  Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files.\n  What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse\n  Repeated, and indecent overthrow\n  Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd,\n  And to thir foes a laughter; for in view\n  Stood rankt of Seraphim another row\n  In posture to displode thir second tire\n  Of Thunder: back defeated to return\n  They worse abhorr'd.  SATAN beheld thir plight,\n  And to his Mates thus in derision call'd.\n\n    O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?\n  Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,\n  To entertain them fair with open Front\n  And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms\n  Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds,\n  Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,\n  As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd\n  Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps\n  For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose\n  If our proposals once again were heard\n  We should compel them to a quick result.\n\n    To whom thus BELIAL in like gamesom mood.\n  Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,\n  Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home,\n  Such as we might perceive amus'd them all,\n  And stumbl'd many, who receives them right,\n  Had need from head to foot well understand;\n  Not understood, this gift they have besides,\n  They shew us when our foes walk not upright.\n\n    So they among themselves in pleasant veine\n  Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond\n  All doubt of Victorie, eternal might\n  To match with thir inventions they presum'd\n  So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,\n  And all his Host derided, while they stood\n  A while in trouble; but they stood not long,\n  Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms\n  Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.\n  Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power\n  Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd)\n  Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills\n  (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n\n  Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)\n  Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,\n  From thir foundations loosning to and fro\n  They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,\n  Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops\n  Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,\n  Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host,\n  When coming towards them so dread they saw\n  The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd,\n  Till on those cursed Engins triple-row\n  They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence\n  Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,\n  Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads\n  Main Promontories flung, which in the Air\n  Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd,\n  Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd\n  Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain\n  Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,\n  Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind\n  Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,\n  Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.\n  The rest in imitation to like Armes\n  Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;\n  So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills\n  Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire,\n  That under ground they fought in dismal shade;\n  Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game\n  To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt\n  Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n\n  Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,\n  Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits\n  Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure,\n  Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen\n  This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd:\n  That his great purpose he might so fulfill,\n  To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd\n  Upon his enemies, and to declare\n  All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son\n  Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began.\n\n    Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd,\n  Son in whose face invisible is beheld\n  Visibly, what by Deitie I am,\n  And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,\n  Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,\n  Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n,\n  Since MICHAEL and his Powers went forth to tame\n  These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,\n  As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd;\n  For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,\n  Equal in their Creation they were form'd,\n  Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought\n  Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;\n  Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last\n  Endless, and no solution will be found:\n  Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do,\n  And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines,\n  With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes\n  Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine.\n  Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;\n  For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr\n  Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine\n  Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou\n  Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace\n  Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know\n  In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare,\n  And this perverse Commotion governd thus,\n  To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir\n  Of all things, to be Heir and to be King\n  By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.\n  Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,\n  Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles\n  That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,\n  My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms\n  Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;\n  Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out\n  From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep:\n  There let them learn, as likes them, to despise\n  God and MESSIAH his anointed King.\n\n    He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct\n  Shon full, he all his Father full exprest\n  Ineffably into his face receiv'd,\n  And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.\n\n    O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones,\n  First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst\n  To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,\n  As is most just; this I my Glorie account,\n  My exaltation, and my whole delight,\n  That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will\n  Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss.\n  Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,\n  And gladlier shall resign, when in the end\n  Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee\n  For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st:\n  But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on\n  Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,\n  Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,\n  Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd,\n  To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down\n  To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm,\n  That from thy just obedience could revolt,\n  Whom to obey is happiness entire.\n  Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure\n  Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount\n  Unfained HALLELUIAHS to thee sing,\n  Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.\n  So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose\n  From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,\n  And the third sacred Morn began to shine\n  Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound\n  The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,\n  Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,\n  It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd\n  By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each\n  Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all\n  And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels\n  Of Beril, and careering Fires between;\n  Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,\n  Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure\n  Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.\n  Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd\n  Of radiant URIM, work divinely wrought,\n  Ascended, at his right hand Victorie\n  Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow\n  And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd,\n  And from about him fierce Effusion rowld\n  Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;\n  Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,\n  He onward came, farr off his coming shon,\n  And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)\n  Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:\n  Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime\n  On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd.\n  Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own\n  First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd,\n  When the great Ensign of MESSIAH blaz'd\n  Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n:\n  Under whose Conduct MICHAEL soon reduc'd\n  His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing,\n  Under thir Head imbodied all in one.\n  Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd;\n  At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd\n  Each to his place, they heard his voice and went\n  Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd,\n  And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd.\n  This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd,\n  And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers\n  Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.\n  In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?\n  But to convince the proud what Signs availe,\n  Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent?\n  They hard'nd more by what might most reclame,\n  Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight\n  Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,\n  Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud\n  Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile\n  Against God and MESSIAH, or to fall\n  In universal ruin last, and now\n  To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,\n  Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God\n  To all his Host on either hand thus spake.\n\n    Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand\n  Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest;\n  Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God\n  Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,\n  And as ye have receivd, so have ye don\n  Invincibly; but of this cursed crew\n  The punishment to other hand belongs,\n  Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;\n  Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd\n  Nor multitude, stand onely and behold\n  Gods indignation on these Godless pourd\n  By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd,\n  Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,\n  Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream\n  Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,\n  Hath honourd me according to his will.\n  Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd;\n  That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee\n  In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,\n  Or I alone against them, since by strength\n  They measure all, of other excellence\n  Not emulous, nor care who them excells;\n  Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.\n\n    So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd\n  His count'nance too severe to be beheld\n  And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.\n  At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings\n  With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes\n  Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound\n  Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.\n  Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,\n  Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles\n  The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,\n  All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon\n  Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand\n  Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent\n  Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd\n  Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,\n  All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd;\n  O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode\n  Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,\n  That wish'd the Mountains now might be again\n  Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.\n  Nor less on either side tempestuous fell\n  His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure,\n  Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,\n  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,\n  One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye\n  Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire\n  Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,\n  And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,\n  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.\n  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd\n  His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant\n  Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:\n  The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard\n  Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd\n  Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd\n  With terrors and with furies to the bounds\n  And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide,\n  Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd\n  Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight\n  Strook them with horror backward, but far worse\n  Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw\n  Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth\n  Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.\n\n    Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw\n  Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled\n  Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep\n  Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.\n  Nine dayes they fell; confounded CHAOS roard,\n  And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall\n  Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout\n  Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last\n  Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd,\n  Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire\n  Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.\n  Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird\n  Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.\n  Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes\n  MESSIAH his triumphal Chariot turnd:\n  To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood\n  Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,\n  With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went,\n  Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,\n  Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,\n  Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n,\n  Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode\n  Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts\n  And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd\n  On high; who into Glorie him receav'd,\n  Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.\n\n    Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth\n  At thy request, and that thou maist beware\n  By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd\n  What might have else to human Race bin hid;\n  The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n\n  Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall\n  Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld\n  With SATAN, hee who envies now thy state,\n  Who now is plotting how he may seduce\n  Thee also from obedience, that with him\n  Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake\n  His punishment, Eternal miserie;\n  Which would be all his solace and revenge,\n  As a despite don against the most High,\n  Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.\n  But list'n not to his Temptations, warne\n  Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard\n  By terrible Example the reward\n  Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,\n  Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.\n\n       THE END OF THE SIXTH BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST.\n\n  BOOK VII.\n\n  Descend from Heav'n URANIA, by that name\n  If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine\n  Following, above th' OLYMPIAN Hill I soare,\n  Above the flight of PEGASEAN wing.\n  The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou\n  Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top\n  Of old OLYMPUS dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne,\n  Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd,\n  Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,\n  Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play\n  In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd\n  With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee\n  Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd,\n  An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,\n  Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down\n  Return me to my Native Element:\n  Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once\n  BELLEROPHON, though from a lower Clime)\n  Dismounted, on th' ALEIAN Field I fall\n  Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.\n  Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound\n  Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;\n  Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,\n  More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd\n  To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes,\n  On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues;\n  In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,\n  And solitude; yet not alone, while thou\n  Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn\n  Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,\n  URANIA, and fit audience find, though few.\n  But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance\n  Of BACCHUS and his Revellers, the Race\n  Of that wilde Rout that tore the THRACIAN Bard\n  In RHODOPE, where Woods and Rocks had Eares\n  To rapture, till the savage clamor dround\n  Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend\n  Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:\n  For thou art Heav'nlie, shee an empty dreame.\n\n    Say Goddess, what ensu'd when RAPHAEL,\n  The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn'd\n  ADAM by dire example to beware\n  Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven\n  To those Apostates, least the like befall\n  In Paradise to ADAM or his Race,\n  Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree,\n  If they transgress, and slight that sole command,\n  So easily obeyd amid the choice\n  Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,\n  Though wandring.  He with his consorted EVE\n  The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd\n  With admiration, and deep Muse to heare\n  Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought\n  So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n,\n  And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss\n  With such confusion: but the evil soon\n  Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those\n  From whom it sprung, impossible to mix\n  With Blessedness.  Whence ADAM soon repeal'd\n  The doubts that in his heart arose: and now\n  Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know\n  What neerer might concern him, how this World\n  Of Heav'n and Earth conspicuous first began,\n  When, and whereof created, for what cause,\n  What within EDEN or without was done\n  Before his memorie, as one whose drouth\n  Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame,\n  Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,\n  Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest.\n\n    Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,\n  Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd\n  Divine Interpreter, by favour sent\n  Down from the Empyrean to forewarne\n  Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,\n  Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:\n  For which to the infinitly Good we owe\n  Immortal thanks, and his admonishment\n  Receave with solemne purpose to observe\n  Immutably his sovran will, the end\n  Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf't\n  Gently for our instruction to impart\n  Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd\n  Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,\n  Deign to descend now lower, and relate\n  What may no less perhaps availe us known,\n  How first began this Heav'n which we behold\n  Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd\n  Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills\n  All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd\n  Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause\n  Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest\n  Through all Eternitie so late to build\n  In CHAOS, and the work begun, how soon\n  Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould\n  What wee, not to explore the secrets aske\n  Of his Eternal Empire, but the more\n  To magnifie his works, the more we know.\n  And the great Light of Day yet wants to run\n  Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n\n  Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,\n  And longer will delay to heare thee tell\n  His Generation, and the rising Birth\n  Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:\n  Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon\n  Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring\n  Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,\n  Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song\n  End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.\n\n    Thus ADAM his illustrous Guest besought:\n\n    And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.\n  This also thy request with caution askt\n  Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works\n  What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,\n  Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?\n  Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve\n  To glorifie the Maker, and inferr\n  Thee also happier, shall not be withheld\n  Thy hearing, such Commission from above\n  I have receav'd, to answer thy desire\n  Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain\n  To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope\n  Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King,\n  Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,\n  To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:\n  Anough is left besides to search and know.\n  But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less\n  Her Temperance over Appetite, to know\n  In measure what the mind may well contain,\n  Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns\n  Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.\n\n    Know then, that after LUCIFER from Heav'n\n  (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host\n  Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)\n  Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep\n  Into his place, and the great Son returnd\n  Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent\n  Eternal Father from his Throne beheld\n  Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.\n\n    At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought\n  All like himself rebellious, by whose aid\n  This inaccessible high strength, the seat\n  Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,\n  He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud\n  Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;\n  Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,\n  Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines\n  Number sufficient to possess her Realmes\n  Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent\n  With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:\n  But least his heart exalt him in the harme\n  Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n,\n  My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire\n  That detriment, if such it be to lose\n  Self-lost, and in a moment will create\n  Another World, out of one man a Race\n  Of men innumerable, there to dwell,\n  Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd\n  They open to themselves at length the way\n  Up hither, under long obedience tri'd,\n  And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, & Heav'n to Earth,\n  One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.\n  Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n,\n  And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee\n  This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:\n  My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee\n  I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep\n  Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth,\n  Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill\n  Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.\n  Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire,\n  And put not forth my goodness, which is free\n  To act or not, Necessitie and Chance\n  Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.\n\n    So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake\n  His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.\n  Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift\n  Then time or motion, but to human ears\n  Cannot without process of speech be told,\n  So told as earthly notion can receave.\n  Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n\n  When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will;\n  Glorie they sung to the most High, good will\n  To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:\n  Glorie to him whose just avenging ire\n  Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight\n  And th' habitations of the just; to him\n  Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd\n  Good out of evil to create, in stead\n  Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring\n  Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse\n  His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.\n  So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son\n  On his great Expedition now appeer'd,\n  Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd\n  Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love\n  Immense, and all his Father in him shon.\n  About his Chariot numberless were pour'd\n  Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,\n  And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd,\n  From the Armoury of God, where stand of old\n  Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd\n  Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,\n  Celestial Equipage; and now came forth\n  Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,\n  Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide\n  Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound\n  On golden Hinges moving, to let forth\n  The King of Glorie in his powerful Word\n  And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.\n  On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore\n  They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss\n  Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,\n  Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes\n  And surging waves, as Mountains to assault\n  Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.\n\n    Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace,\n  Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end:\n\n    Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim\n  Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode\n  Farr into CHAOS, and the World unborn;\n  For CHAOS heard his voice: him all his Traine\n  Follow'd in bright procession to behold\n  Creation, and the wonders of his might.\n  Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand\n  He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd\n  In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe\n  This Universe, and all created things:\n  One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd\n  Round through the vast profunditie obscure,\n  And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,\n  This be thy just Circumference, O World.\n  Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth,\n  Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound\n  Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme\n  His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,\n  And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth\n  Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd\n  The black tartareous cold infernal dregs\n  Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd\n  Like things to like, the rest to several place\n  Disparted, and between spun out the Air,\n  And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung.\n\n    Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light\n  Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure\n  Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East\n  To journie through the airie gloom began,\n  Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun\n  Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle\n  Sojourn'd the while.  God saw the Light was good;\n  And light from darkness by the Hemisphere\n  Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night\n  He nam'd.  Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn:\n  Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung\n  By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light\n  Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;\n  Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout\n  The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd,\n  And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd\n  God and his works, Creatour him they sung,\n  Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.\n\n    Again, God said, let ther be Firmament\n  Amid the Waters, and let it divide\n  The Waters from the Waters: and God made\n  The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,\n  Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd\n  In circuit to the uttermost convex\n  Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,\n  The Waters underneath from those above\n  Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World\n  Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide\n  Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule\n  Of CHAOS farr remov'd, least fierce extreames\n  Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:\n  And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n\n  And Morning CHORUS sung the second Day.\n\n    The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet\n  Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd,\n  Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth\n  Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme\n  Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe,\n  Fermented the great Mother to conceave,\n  Satiate with genial moisture, when God said\n  Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n\n  Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.\n  Immediately the Mountains huge appeer\n  Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave\n  Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:\n  So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low\n  Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,\n  Capacious bed of Waters: thither they\n  Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld\n  As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;\n  Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,\n  For haste; such flight the great command impress'd\n  On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call\n  Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)\n  Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,\n  Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,\n  If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,\n  Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,\n  But they, or under ground, or circuit wide\n  With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,\n  And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;\n  Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie,\n  All but within those banks, where Rivers now\n  Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.\n  The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle\n  Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas:\n  And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth\n  Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,\n  And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;\n  Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.\n  He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then\n  Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd,\n  Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad\n  Her Universal Face with pleasant green,\n  Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd\n  Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay\n  Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,\n  Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept\n  The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed\n  Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub,\n  And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last\n  Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred\n  Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd\n  Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,\n  With tufts the vallies & each fountain side,\n  With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now\n  Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell,\n  Or wander with delight, and love to haunt\n  Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd\n  Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground\n  None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist\n  Went up and waterd all the ground, and each\n  Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth\n  God made, and every Herb, before it grew\n  On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:\n  So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day.\n\n    Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights\n  High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide\n  The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,\n  For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,\n  And let them be for Lights as I ordaine\n  Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n\n  To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.\n  And God made two great Lights, great for thir use\n  To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,\n  The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,\n  And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n\n  To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day\n  In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,\n  And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,\n  Surveying his great Work, that it was good:\n  For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun\n  A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first,\n  Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon\n  Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,\n  And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field:\n  Of Light by farr the greater part he took,\n  Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd\n  In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive\n  And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine\n  Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light.\n  Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs\n  Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light,\n  And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;\n  By tincture or reflection they augment\n  Thir small peculiar, though from human sight\n  So farr remote, with diminution seen.\n  First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,\n  Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round\n  Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run\n  His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray\n  Dawn, and the PLEIADES before him danc'd\n  Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,\n  But opposite in leveld West was set\n  His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light\n  From him, for other light she needed none\n  In that aspect, and still that distance keepes\n  Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,\n  Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign\n  With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,\n  With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd\n  Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd\n  With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,\n  Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day.\n\n    And God said, let the Waters generate\n  Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:\n  And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings\n  Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n.\n  And God created the great Whales, and each\n  Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously\n  The waters generated by thir kindes,\n  And every Bird of wing after his kinde;\n  And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying,\n  Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas\n  And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;\n  And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth.\n  Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay\n  With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales\n  Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales\n  Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft\n  Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate\n  Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves\n  Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance\n  Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold,\n  Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend\n  Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food\n  In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,\n  And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk\n  Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate\n  Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan\n  Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep\n  Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,\n  And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles\n  Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.\n  Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares\n  Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon\n  Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd\n  Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge\n  They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime\n  With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud\n  In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork\n  On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:\n  Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise\n  In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way,\n  Intelligent of seasons, and set forth\n  Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's\n  Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing\n  Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane\n  Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire\n  Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes:\n  From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song\n  Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings\n  Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal\n  Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes:\n  Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd\n  Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck\n  Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes\n  Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit\n  The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre\n  The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground\n  Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds\n  The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine\n  Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue\n  Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus\n  With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,\n  Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day.\n\n    The Sixt, and of Creation last arose\n  With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,\n  Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,\n  Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,\n  Each in their kinde.  The Earth obey'd, and strait\n  Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth\n  Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,\n  Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose\n  As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns\n  In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;\n  Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd:\n  The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:\n  Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks\n  Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:\n  The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd\n  The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free\n  His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,\n  And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,\n  The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale\n  Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw\n  In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground\n  Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould\n  BEHEMOTH biggest born of Earth upheav'd\n  His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose,\n  As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land\n  The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.\n  At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,\n  Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans\n  For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact\n  In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride\n  With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:\n  These as a line thir long dimension drew,\n  Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all\n  Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde\n  Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd\n  Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept\n  The Parsimonious Emmet, provident\n  Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd,\n  Pattern of just equalitie perhaps\n  Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes\n  Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd\n  The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone\n  Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells\n  With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless,\n  And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names,\n  Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown\n  The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,\n  Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes\n  And hairie Main terrific, though to thee\n  Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.\n  Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld\n  Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand\n  First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire\n  Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth,\n  By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt\n  Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd;\n  There wanted yet the Master work, the end\n  Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone\n  And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd\n  With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect\n  His Stature, and upright with Front serene\n  Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence\n  Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n,\n  But grateful to acknowledge whence his good\n  Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes\n  Directed in Devotion, to adore\n  And worship God Supream, who made him chief\n  Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent\n  Eternal Father (For where is not hee\n  Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.\n\n    Let us make now Man in our image, Man\n  In our similitude, and let them rule\n  Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,\n  Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,\n  And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.\n  This said, he formd thee, ADAM, thee O Man\n  Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd\n  The breath of Life; in his own Image hee\n  Created thee, in the Image of God\n  Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul.\n  Male he created thee, but thy consort\n  Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said,\n  Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,\n  Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold\n  Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,\n  And every living thing that moves on the Earth.\n  Wherever thus created, for no place\n  Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st\n  He brought thee into this delicious Grove,\n  This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,\n  Delectable both to behold and taste;\n  And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food\n  Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds,\n  Varietie without end; but of the Tree\n  Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,\n  Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st;\n  Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware,\n  And govern well thy appetite, least sin\n  Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.\n  Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made\n  View'd, and behold all was entirely good;\n  So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day:\n  Yet not till the Creator from his work\n  Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd\n  Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode,\n  Thence to behold this new created World\n  Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd\n  In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,\n  Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode\n  Followd with acclamation and the sound\n  Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd\n  Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire\n  Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst)\n  The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung,\n  The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood,\n  While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.\n  Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,\n  Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in\n  The great Creator from his work returnd\n  Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;\n  Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne\n  To visit oft the dwellings of just Men\n  Delighted, and with frequent intercourse\n  Thither will send his winged Messengers\n  On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung\n  The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n,\n  That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led\n  To Gods Eternal house direct the way,\n  A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold\n  And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,\n  Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way\n  Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest\n  Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh\n  Eev'ning arose in EDEN, for the Sun\n  Was set, and twilight from the East came on,\n  Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount\n  Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne\n  Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,\n  The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down\n  With his great Father (for he also went\n  Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge\n  Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd,\n  Author and end of all things, and from work\n  Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day,\n  As resting on that day from all his work,\n  But not in silence holy kept; the Harp\n  Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,\n  And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,\n  All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire\n  Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice\n  Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds\n  Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.\n  Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,\n  Great are thy works, JEHOVAH, infinite\n  Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue\n  Relate thee; greater now in thy return\n  Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day\n  Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create\n  Is greater then created to destroy.\n  Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound\n  Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt\n  Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine\n  Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought\n  Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw\n  The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes\n  To lessen thee, against his purpose serves\n  To manifest the more thy might: his evil\n  Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.\n  Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n\n  From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view\n  On the cleer HYALINE, the Glassie Sea;\n  Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's\n  Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World\n  Of destind habitation; but thou know'st\n  Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,\n  Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,\n  Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,\n  And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't,\n  Created in his Image, there to dwell\n  And worship him, and in reward to rule\n  Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,\n  And multiply a Race of Worshippers\n  Holy and just: thrice happie if they know\n  Thir happiness, and persevere upright.\n\n    So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,\n  With HALLELUIAHS: Thus was Sabbath kept.\n  And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd\n  How first this World and face of things began,\n  And what before thy memorie was don\n  From the beginning, that posteritie\n  Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst\n  Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.\n\n    To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.\n  What thanks sufficient, or what recompence\n  Equal have I to render thee, Divine\n  Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd\n  The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't\n  This friendly condescention to relate\n  Things else by me unsearchable, now heard\n  VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,\n  With glorie attributed to the high\n  Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,\n  VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.\n  VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld\n  Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute,\n  Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,\n  An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd\n  And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle\n  Spaces incomprehensible (for such\n  Thir distance argues and thir swift return\n  Diurnal) meerly to officiate light\n  Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,\n  One day and night; in all thir vast survey\n  Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,\n  How Nature wise and frugal could commit\n  Such disproportions, with superfluous hand\n  So many nobler Bodies to create,\n  Greater so manifold to this one use,\n  For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose\n  Such restless revolution day by day\n  Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,\n  That better might with farr less compass move,\n  Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines\n  Her end without least motion, and receaves,\n  As Tribute such a sumless journey brought\n  Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;\n  Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.\n\n    So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd\n  Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which EVE\n  Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight,\n  With lowliness Majestic from her seat,\n  And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,\n  Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,\n  To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom,\n  Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung\n  And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.\n  Yet went she not, as not with such discourse\n  Delighted, or not capable her eare\n  Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd,\n  ADAM relating, she sole Auditress;\n  Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd\n  Before the Angel, and of him to ask\n  Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix\n  Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute\n  With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip\n  Not Words alone pleas'd her.  O when meet now\n  Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd?\n  With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;\n  Not unattended, for on her as Queen\n  A pomp of winning Graces waited still,\n  And from about her shot Darts of desire\n  Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.\n  And RAPHAEL now to ADAM's doubt propos'd\n  Benevolent and facil thus repli'd.\n\n    To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n\n  Is as the Book of God before thee set,\n  Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne\n  His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:\n  This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth,\n  Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest\n  From Man or Angel the great Architect\n  Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge\n  His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought\n  Rather admire; or if they list to try\n  Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns\n  Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move\n  His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide\n  Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n\n  And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild\n  The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive\n  To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear\n  With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're,\n  Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:\n  Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,\n  Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest\n  That Bodies bright and greater should not serve\n  The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run,\n  Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves\n  The benefit: consider first, that Great\n  Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth\n  Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small,\n  Nor glistering, may of solid good containe\n  More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,\n  Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,\n  But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd\n  His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.\n  Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries\n  Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.\n  And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak\n  The Makers high magnificence, who built\n  So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;\n  That Man may know he dwells not in his own;\n  An Edifice too large for him to fill,\n  Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest\n  Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.\n  The swiftness of those Circles attribute,\n  Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,\n  That to corporeal substances could adde\n  Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,\n  Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n\n  Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd\n  In EDEN, distance inexpressible\n  By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,\n  Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew\n  Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd;\n  Not that I so affirm, though so it seem\n  To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.\n  God to remove his wayes from human sense,\n  Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,\n  If it presume, might erre in things too high,\n  And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun\n  Be Center to the World, and other Starrs\n  By his attractive vertue and thir own\n  Incited, dance about him various rounds?\n  Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,\n  Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,\n  In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these\n  The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,\n  Insensibly three different Motions move?\n  Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,\n  Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities,\n  Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift\n  Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd,\n  Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele\n  Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,\n  If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day\n  Travelling East, and with her part averse\n  From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part\n  Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light\n  Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,\n  To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr\n  Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night\n  This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,\n  Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest\n  As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce\n  Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate\n  Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps\n  With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie\n  Communicating Male and Femal Light,\n  Which two great Sexes animate the World,\n  Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live.\n  For such vast room in Nature unpossest\n  By living Soule, desert and desolate,\n  Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute\n  Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr\n  Down to this habitable, which returnes\n  Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.\n  But whether thus these things, or whether not,\n  Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n\n  Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,\n  Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,\n  Or Shee from West her silent course advance\n  With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps\n  On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n,\n  And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,\n  Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,\n  Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;\n  Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,\n  Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou\n  In what he gives to thee, this Paradise\n  And thy faire EVE; Heav'n is for thee too high\n  To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:\n  Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;\n  Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there\n  Live, in what state, condition or degree,\n  Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd\n  Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n.\n\n    To whom thus ADAM cleerd of doubt, repli'd.\n  How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure\n  Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene,\n  And freed from intricacies, taught to live,\n  The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts\n  To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which\n  God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,\n  And not molest us, unless we our selves\n  Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.\n  But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave\n  Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;\n  Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne,\n  That not to know at large of things remote\n  From use, obscure and suttle, but to know\n  That which before us lies in daily life,\n  Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,\n  Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,\n  And renders us in things that most concerne\n  Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek.\n  Therefore from this high pitch let us descend\n  A lower flight, and speak of things at hand\n  Useful, whence haply mention may arise\n  Of somthing not unseasonable to ask\n  By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd.\n  Thee I have heard relating what was don\n  Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate\n  My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;\n  And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest\n  How suttly to detaine thee I devise,\n  Inviting thee to hear while I relate,\n  Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:\n  For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n,\n  And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare\n  Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst\n  And hunger both, from labour, at the houre\n  Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,\n  Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine\n  Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.\n\n    To whom thus RAPHAEL answer'd heav'nly meek.\n  Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,\n  Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee\n  Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd,\n  Inward and outward both, his image faire:\n  Speaking or mute all comliness and grace\n  Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.\n  Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth\n  Then of our fellow servant, and inquire\n  Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:\n  For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set\n  On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;\n  For I that Day was absent, as befell,\n  Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,\n  Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;\n  Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had)\n  To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie,\n  Or enemie, while God was in his work,\n  Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,\n  Destruction with Creation might have mixt.\n  Not that they durst without his leave attempt,\n  But us he sends upon his high behests\n  For state, as Sovran King, and to enure\n  Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut\n  The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong;\n  But long ere our approaching heard within\n  Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,\n  Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.\n  Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light\n  Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge.\n  But thy relation now; for I attend,\n  Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine.\n\n    So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.\n  For Man to tell how human Life began\n  Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?\n  Desire with thee still longer to converse\n  Induc'd me.  As new wak't from soundest sleep\n  Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid\n  In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun\n  Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed.\n  Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd,\n  And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd\n  By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,\n  As thitherward endevoring, and upright\n  Stood on my feet; about me round I saw\n  Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,\n  And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,\n  Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew,\n  Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd,\n  With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd.\n  My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb\n  Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran\n  With supple joints, as lively vigour led:\n  But who I was, or where, or from what cause,\n  Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake,\n  My Tongue obey'd and readily could name\n  What e're I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,\n  And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,\n  Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,\n  And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,\n  Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?\n  Not of my self; by some great Maker then,\n  In goodness and in power praeeminent;\n  Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,\n  From whom I have that thus I move and live,\n  And feel that I am happier then I know.\n  While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither,\n  From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld\n  This happie Light, when answer none return'd,\n  On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours\n  Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep\n  First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd\n  My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought\n  I then was passing to my former state\n  Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:\n  When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,\n  Whose inward apparition gently mov'd\n  My Fancy to believe I yet had being,\n  And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,\n  And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise,\n  First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd\n  First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide\n  To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.\n  So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd,\n  And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire\n  Smooth sliding without step, last led me up\n  A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,\n  A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees\n  Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw\n  Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree\n  Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye\n  Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite\n  To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found\n  Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream\n  Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun\n  My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide\n  Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd,\n  Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw\n  In adoration at his feet I fell\n  Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,\n  Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest\n  Above, or round about thee or beneath.\n  This Paradise I give thee, count it thine\n  To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:\n  Of every Tree that in the Garden growes\n  Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:\n  But of the Tree whose operation brings\n  Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set\n  The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,\n  Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,\n  Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,\n  And shun the bitter consequence: for know,\n  The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command\n  Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;\n  From that day mortal, and this happie State\n  Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World\n  Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc'd\n  The rigid interdiction, which resounds\n  Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice\n  Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect\n  Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd.\n  Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth\n  To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords\n  Possess it, and all things that therein live,\n  Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.\n  In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold\n  After thir kindes; I bring them to receave\n  From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie\n  With low subjection; understand the same\n  Of Fish within thir watry residence,\n  Not hither summond, since they cannot change\n  Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.\n  As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold\n  Approaching two and two, These cowring low\n  With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing.\n  I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood\n  Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd\n  My sudden apprehension: but in these\n  I found not what me thought I wanted still;\n  And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd.\n\n    O by what Name, for thou above all these,\n  Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,\n  Surpassest farr my naming, how may I\n  Adore thee, Author of this Universe,\n  And all this good to man, for whose well being\n  So amply, and with hands so liberal\n  Thou hast provided all things: but with mee\n  I see not who partakes.  In solitude\n  What happiness, who can enjoy alone,\n  Or all enjoying, what contentment find?\n  Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,\n  As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd.\n\n    What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth\n  With various living creatures, and the Aire\n  Replenisht, and all these at thy command\n  To come and play before thee, know'st thou not\n  Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,\n  And reason not contemptibly; with these\n  Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.\n  So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd\n  So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor'd,\n  And humble deprecation thus repli'd.\n\n    Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power,\n  My Maker, be propitious while I speak.\n  Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,\n  And these inferiour farr beneath me set?\n  Among unequals what societie\n  Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?\n  Which must be mutual, in proportion due\n  Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie\n  The one intense, the other still remiss\n  Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove\n  Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak\n  Such as I seek, fit to participate\n  All rational delight, wherein the brute\n  Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce\n  Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;\n  So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd;\n  Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle\n  So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;\n  Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.\n\n    Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd.\n  A nice and suttle happiness I see\n  Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice\n  Of thy Associates, ADAM, and wilt taste\n  No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.\n  What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,\n  Seem I to thee sufficiently possest\n  Of happiness, or not? who am alone\n  From all Eternitie, for none I know\n  Second to mee or like, equal much less.\n  How have I then with whom to hold converse\n  Save with the Creatures which I made, and those\n  To me inferiour, infinite descents\n  Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?\n\n    He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd.  To attaine\n  The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes\n  All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;\n  Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee\n  Is no deficience found; not so is Man,\n  But in degree, the cause of his desire\n  By conversation with his like to help,\n  Or solace his defects.  No need that thou\n  Shouldst propagat, already infinite;\n  And through all numbers absolute, though One;\n  But Man by number is to manifest\n  His single imperfection, and beget\n  Like of his like, his Image multipli'd,\n  In unitie defective, which requires\n  Collateral love, and deerest amitie.\n  Thou in thy secresie although alone,\n  Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not\n  Social communication, yet so pleas'd,\n  Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt\n  Of Union or Communion, deifi'd;\n  I by conversing cannot these erect\n  From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.\n  Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd\n  Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd\n  This answer from the gratious voice Divine.\n\n    Thus farr to try thee, ADAM, I was pleas'd,\n  And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,\n  Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self,\n  Expressing well the spirit within thee free,\n  My Image, not imparted to the Brute,\n  Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee\n  Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,\n  And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st,\n  Knew it not good for Man to be alone,\n  And no such companie as then thou saw'st\n  Intended thee, for trial onely brought,\n  To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet:\n  What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd,\n  Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,\n  Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.\n\n    Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now\n  My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd,\n  Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth\n  In that celestial Colloquie sublime,\n  As with an object that excels the sense,\n  Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair\n  Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd\n  By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes.\n  Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell\n  Of Fancie my internal sight, by which\n  Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,\n  Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape\n  Still glorious before whom awake I stood;\n  Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took\n  From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,\n  And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,\n  But suddenly with flesh fill'd up & heal'd:\n  The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;\n  Under his forming hands a Creature grew,\n  Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,\n  That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now\n  Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd\n  And in her looks, which from that time infus'd\n  Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,\n  And into all things from her Aire inspir'd\n  The spirit of love and amorous delight.\n  She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd\n  To find her, or for ever to deplore\n  Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:\n  When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,\n  Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd\n  With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow\n  To make her amiable: On she came,\n  Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen,\n  And guided by his voice, nor uninformd\n  Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:\n  Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye,\n  In every gesture dignitie and love.\n  I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.\n\n    This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd\n  Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,\n  Giver of all things faire, but fairest this\n  Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see\n  Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self\n  Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man\n  Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe\n  Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;\n  And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.\n\n    She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,\n  Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,\n  Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,\n  That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won,\n  Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd,\n  The more desirable, or to say all,\n  Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,\n  Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd;\n  I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew,\n  And with obsequious Majestie approv'd\n  My pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre\n  I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n,\n  And happie Constellations on that houre\n  Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth\n  Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;\n  Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires\n  Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings\n  Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,\n  Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night\n  Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr\n  On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.\n  Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought\n  My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss\n  Which I enjoy, and must confess to find\n  In all things else delight indeed, but such\n  As us'd or not, works in the mind no change,\n  Nor vehement desire, these delicacies\n  I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours,\n  Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here\n  Farr otherwise, transported I behold,\n  Transported touch; here passion first I felt,\n  Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else\n  Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake\n  Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.\n  Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part\n  Not proof enough such Object to sustain,\n  Or from my side subducting, took perhaps\n  More then enough; at least on her bestow'd\n  Too much of Ornament, in outward shew\n  Elaborate, of inward less exact.\n  For well I understand in the prime end\n  Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind\n  And inward Faculties, which most excell,\n  In outward also her resembling less\n  His Image who made both, and less expressing\n  The character of that Dominion giv'n\n  O're other Creatures; yet when I approach\n  Her loveliness, so absolute she seems\n  And in her self compleat, so well to know\n  Her own, that what she wills to do or say,\n  Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;\n  All higher knowledge in her presence falls\n  Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her\n  Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes;\n  Authoritie and Reason on her waite,\n  As one intended first, not after made\n  Occasionally; and to consummate all,\n  Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat\n  Build in her loveliest, and create an awe\n  About her, as a guard Angelic plac't.\n  To whom the Angel with contracted brow.\n\n    Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;\n  Do thou but thine, and be not diffident\n  Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou\n  Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,\n  By attributing overmuch to things\n  Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st.\n  For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so,\n  An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well\n  Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,\n  Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;\n  Then value: Oft times nothing profits more\n  Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right\n  Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st,\n  The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,\n  And to realities yeild all her shows;\n  Made so adorn for thy delight the more,\n  So awful, that with honour thou maist love\n  Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.\n  But if the sense of touch whereby mankind\n  Is propagated seem such dear delight\n  Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't\n  To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be\n  To them made common & divulg'd, if aught\n  Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue\n  The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.\n  What higher in her societie thou findst\n  Attractive, human, rational, love still;\n  In loving thou dost well, in passion not,\n  Wherein true Love consists not; love refines\n  The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat\n  In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale\n  By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend,\n  Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause\n  Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.\n\n    To whom thus half abash't ADAM repli'd.\n  Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught\n  In procreation common to all kindes\n  (Though higher of the genial Bed by far,\n  And with mysterious reverence I deem)\n  So much delights me, as those graceful acts,\n  Those thousand decencies that daily flow\n  From all her words and actions, mixt with Love\n  And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd\n  Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;\n  Harmonie to behold in wedded pair\n  More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.\n  Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose\n  What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,\n  Who meet with various objects, from the sense\n  Variously representing; yet still free\n  Approve the best, and follow what I approve.\n  To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist\n  Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide;\n  Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;\n  Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love\n  Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix\n  Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?\n\n    To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd\n  Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,\n  Answer'd.  Let it suffice thee that thou know'st\n  Us happie, and without Love no happiness.\n  Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st\n  (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy\n  In eminence, and obstacle find none\n  Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:\n  Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,\n  Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure\n  Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need\n  As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.\n  But I can now no more; the parting Sun\n  Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles\n  HESPEREAN sets, my Signal to depart.\n  Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all\n  Him whom to love is to obey, and keep\n  His great command; take heed least Passion sway\n  Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will\n  Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons\n  The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware.\n  I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,\n  And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall\n  Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.\n  Perfet within, no outward aid require;\n  And all temptation to transgress repel.\n\n    So saying, he arose; whom ADAM thus\n  Follow'd with benediction.  Since to part,\n  Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,\n  Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.\n  Gentle to me and affable hath been\n  Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever\n  With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind\n  Be good and friendly still, and oft return.\n\n    So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n\n  From the thick shade, and ADAM to his Bowre.\n\n       THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK VIII.\n\n  No more of talk where God or Angel Guest\n  With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd\n  To sit indulgent, and with him partake\n  Rural repast, permitting him the while\n  Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change\n  Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach\n  Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt\n  And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n\n  Now alienated, distance and distaste,\n  Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n,\n  That brought into this World a world of woe,\n  Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie\n  Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument\n  Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth\n  Of stern ACHILLES on his Foe pursu'd\n  Thrice Fugitive about TROY Wall; or rage\n  Of TURNUS for LAVINIA disespous'd,\n  Or NEPTUN'S ire or JUNO'S, that so long\n  Perplex'd the GREEK and CYTHEREA'S Son;\n  If answerable style I can obtaine\n  Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes\n  Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,\n  And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires\n  Easie my unpremeditated Verse:\n  Since first this subject for Heroic Song\n  Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;\n  Not sedulous by Nature to indite\n  Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument\n  Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect\n  With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights\n  In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude\n  Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom\n  Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,\n  Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields,\n  Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;\n  Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights\n  At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast\n  Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;\n  The skill of Artifice or Office mean,\n  Not that which justly gives Heroic name\n  To Person or to Poem.  Mee of these\n  Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument\n  Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise\n  That name, unless an age too late, or cold\n  Climat, or Years damp my intended wing\n  Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,\n  Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.\n\n    The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr\n  Of HESPERUS, whose Office is to bring\n  Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter\n  Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end\n  Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:\n  When SATAN who late fled before the threats\n  Of GABRIEL out of EDEN, now improv'd\n  In meditated fraud and malice, bent\n  On mans destruction, maugre what might hap\n  Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd.\n  By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd\n  From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,\n  Since URIEL Regent of the Sun descri'd\n  His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim\n  That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n,\n  The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode\n  With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line\n  He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night\n  From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;\n  On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse\n  From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth\n  Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,\n  Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\n  Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise\n  Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\n  Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\n  In with the River sunk, and with it rose\n  Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\n  Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\n  From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole\n  MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;\n  Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\n  West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd\n  At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes\n  GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd\n  With narrow search; and with inspection deep\n  Consider'd every Creature, which of all\n  Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\n  The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\n  Him after long debate, irresolute\n  Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\n  Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\n  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\n  From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\n  Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\n  As from his wit and native suttletie\n  Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\n  Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\n  Active within beyond the sense of brute.\n  Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\n  His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\n\n    O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd\n  More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\n  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\n  For what God after better worse would build?\n  Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\n  That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\n  Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\n  In thee concentring all thir precious beams\n  Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n\n  Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\n  Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\n  Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\n  Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\n  Of Creatures animate with gradual life\n  Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\n  With what delight could I have walkt thee round\n  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\n  Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\n  Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\n  Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\n  Find place or refuge; and the more I see\n  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\n  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\n  Of contraries; all good to me becomes\n  Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\n  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\n  To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\n  Nor hope to be my self less miserable\n  By what I seek, but others to make such\n  As I though thereby worse to me redound:\n  For onely in destroying I finde ease\n  To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\n  Or won to what may work his utter loss,\n  For whom all this was made, all this will soon\n  Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\n  In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\n  To mee shall be the glorie sole among\n  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\n  What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days\n  Continu'd making, and who knows how long\n  Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\n  Not longer then since I in one Night freed\n  From servitude inglorious welnigh half\n  Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\n  Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\n  And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\n  Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\n  More Angels to Create, if they at least\n  Are his Created or to spite us more,\n  Determin'd to advance into our room\n  A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\n  Exalted from so base original,\n  With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\n  He effected; Man he made, and for him built\n  Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\n  Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\n  Subjected to his service Angel wings,\n  And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\n  Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\n  I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\n  Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\n  In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\n  The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\n  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\n  O foul descent! that I who erst contended\n  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\n  Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\n  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\n  That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\n  But what will not Ambition and Revenge\n  Descend to? who aspires must down as low\n  As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\n  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\n  Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\n  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\n  Since higher I fall short, on him who next\n  Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\n  Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\n  Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\n  From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\n\n    So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\n  Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\n  His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\n  The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\n  In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,\n  His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\n  Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\n  Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\n  Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\n  The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\n  In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\n  With act intelligential; but his sleep\n  Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\n  Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne\n  In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd\n  Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\n  From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\n  To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\n  With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\n  And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\n  Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\n  The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\n  Then commune how that day they best may ply\n  Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\n  The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\n  And EVE first to her Husband thus began.\n\n    ADAM, well may we labour still to dress\n  This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\n  Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\n  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\n  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\n  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\n  One night or two with wanton growth derides\n  Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\n  Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\n  Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\n  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\n  The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\n  The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\n  In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\n  With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\n  For while so near each other thus all day\n  Our task we choose, what wonder if no near\n  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\n  Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\n  Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\n  Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\n\n    To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd.\n  Sole EVE, Associate sole, to me beyond\n  Compare above all living Creatures deare,\n  Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd\n  How we might best fulfill the work which here\n  God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass\n  Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found\n  In woman, then to studie houshold good,\n  And good workes in her Husband to promote.\n  Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd\n  Labour, as to debarr us when we need\n  Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,\n  Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse\n  Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,\n  To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,\n  Love not the lowest end of human life.\n  For not to irksom toile, but to delight\n  He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.\n  These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt\n  Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide\n  As we need walk, till younger hands ere long\n  Assist us: But if much converse perhaps\n  Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.\n  For solitude somtimes is best societie,\n  And short retirement urges sweet returne.\n  But other doubt possesses me, least harm\n  Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst\n  What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe\n  Envying our happiness, and of his own\n  Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame\n  By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand\n  Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find\n  His wish and best advantage, us asunder,\n  Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each\n  To other speedie aide might lend at need;\n  Whether his first design be to withdraw\n  Our fealtie from God, or to disturb\n  Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss\n  Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;\n  Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side\n  That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.\n  The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\n  Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,\n  Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.\n\n    To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE,\n  As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,\n  With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd.\n\n    Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,\n  That such an enemie we have, who seeks\n  Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,\n  And from the parting Angel over-heard\n  As in a shadie nook I stood behind,\n  Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.\n  But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt\n  To God or thee, because we have a foe\n  May tempt it, I expected not to hear.\n  His violence thou fearst not, being such,\n  As wee, not capable of death or paine,\n  Can either not receave, or can repell.\n  His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs\n  Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love\n  Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;\n  Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,\n  ADAM, misthought of her to thee so dear?\n\n    To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd.\n  Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE,\n  For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:\n  Not diffident of thee do I dissuade\n  Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid\n  Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe.\n  For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses\n  The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd\n  Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff\n  Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne\n  And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,\n  Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,\n  If such affront I labour to avert\n  From thee alone, which on us both at once\n  The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,\n  Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.\n  Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;\n  Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce\n  Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.\n  I from the influence of thy looks receave\n  Access in every Vertue, in thy sight\n  More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were\n  Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,\n  Shame to be overcome or over-reacht\n  Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.\n  Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel\n  When I am present, and thy trial choose\n  With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.\n\n    So spake domestick ADAM in his care\n  And Matrimonial Love, but EVE, who thought\n  Less attributed to her Faith sincere,\n  Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.\n\n    If this be our condition, thus to dwell\n  In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,\n  Suttle or violent, we not endu'd\n  Single with like defence, wherever met,\n  How are we happie, still in fear of harm?\n  But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe\n  Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem\n  Of our integritie: his foul esteeme\n  Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns\n  Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard\n  By us? who rather double honour gaine\n  From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within,\n  Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.\n  And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid\n  Alone, without exterior help sustaind?\n  Let us not then suspect our happie State\n  Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,\n  As not secure to single or combin'd.\n  Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,\n  And EDEN were no EDEN thus expos'd.\n\n    To whom thus ADAM fervently repli'd.\n  O Woman, best are all things as the will\n  Of God ordaind them, his creating hand\n  Nothing imperfet or deficient left\n  Of all that he Created, much less Man,\n  Or ought that might his happie State secure,\n  Secure from outward force; within himself\n  The danger lies, yet lies within his power:\n  Against his will he can receave no harme.\n  But God left free the Will, for what obeyes\n  Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,\n  But bid her well beware, and still erect,\n  Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd\n  She dictate false, and missinforme the Will\n  To do what God expresly hath forbid.\n  Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,\n  That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.\n  Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,\n  Since Reason not impossibly may meet\n  Some specious object by the Foe subornd,\n  And fall into deception unaware,\n  Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.\n  Seek not temptation then, which to avoide\n  Were better, and most likelie if from mee\n  Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.\n  Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve\n  First thy obedience; th' other who can know,\n  Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?\n  But if thou think, trial unsought may finde\n  Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,\n  Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;\n  Go in thy native innocence, relie\n  On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,\n  For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.\n\n    So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but EVE\n  Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.\n\n    With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd\n  Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words\n  Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,\n  May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,\n  The willinger I goe, nor much expect\n  A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;\n  So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.\n  Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand\n  Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light\n  OREAD or DRYAD, or of DELIA's Traine,\n  Betook her to the Groves, but DELIA's self\n  In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,\n  Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,\n  But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,\n  Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,\n  To PALES, or POMONA, thus adornd,\n  Likest she seemd, POMONA when she fled\n  VERTUMNUS, or to CERES in her Prime,\n  Yet Virgin of PROSERPINA from JOVE.\n  Her long with ardent look his EYE pursu'd\n  Delighted, but desiring more her stay.\n  Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,\n  Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd\n  To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,\n  And all things in best order to invite\n  Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.\n  O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless EVE,\n  Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!\n  Thou never from that houre in Paradise\n  Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose;\n  Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades\n  Waited with hellish rancor imminent\n  To intercept thy way, or send thee back\n  Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.\n  For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,\n  Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,\n  And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde\n  The onely two of Mankinde, but in them\n  The whole included Race, his purposd prey.\n  In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft\n  Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,\n  Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,\n  By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet\n  He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find\n  EVE separate, he wish'd, but not with hope\n  Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,\n  Beyond his hope, EVE separate he spies,\n  Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,\n  Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round\n  About her glowd, oft stooping to support\n  Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay\n  Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,\n  Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies\n  Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,\n  Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,\n  From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.\n  Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers'd\n  Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,\n  Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen\n  Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours\n  Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE:\n  Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd\n  Or of reviv'd ADONIS, or renownd\n  ALCINOUS, host of old LAERTES Son,\n  Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King\n  Held dalliance with his faire EGYPTIAN Spouse.\n  Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.\n  As one who long in populous City pent,\n  Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,\n  Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe\n  Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes\n  Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,\n  The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,\n  Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;\n  If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,\n  What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,\n  She most, and in her look summs all Delight.\n  Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold\n  This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE\n  Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme\n  Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,\n  Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire\n  Of gesture or lest action overawd\n  His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd\n  His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:\n  That space the Evil one abstracted stood\n  From his own evil, and for the time remaind\n  Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,\n  Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;\n  But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,\n  Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,\n  And tortures him now more, the more he sees\n  Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon\n  Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts\n  Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.\n\n    Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet\n  Compulsion thus transported to forget\n  What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope\n  Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste\n  Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,\n  Save what is in destroying, other joy\n  To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass\n  Occasion which now smiles, behold alone\n  The Woman, opportune to all attempts,\n  Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,\n  Whose higher intellectual more I shun,\n  And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb\n  Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,\n  Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,\n  I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine\n  Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.\n  Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,\n  Not terrible, though terrour be in Love\n  And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,\n  Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,\n  The way which to her ruin now I tend.\n\n    So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd\n  In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward EVE\n  Address'd his way, not with indented wave,\n  Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,\n  Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd\n  Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head\n  Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;\n  With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect\n  Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass\n  Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,\n  And lovely, never since of Serpent kind\n  Lovelier, not those that in ILLYRIA chang'd\n  HERMIONE and CADMUS, or the God\n  In EPIDAURUS; nor to which transformd\n  AMMONIAN JOVE, or CAPITOLINE was seen,\n  Hee with OLYMPIAS, this with her who bore\n  SCIPIO the highth of ROME.  With tract oblique\n  At first, as one who sought access, but feard\n  To interrupt, side-long he works his way.\n  As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought\n  Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind\n  Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;\n  So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine\n  Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE,\n  To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound\n  Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd\n  To such disport before her through the Field,\n  From every Beast, more duteous at her call,\n  Then at CIRCEAN call the Herd disguis'd.\n  Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;\n  But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd\n  His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,\n  Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.\n  His gentle dumb expression turnd at length\n  The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he glad\n  Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue\n  Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,\n  His fraudulent temptation thus began.\n\n    Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps\n  Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm\n  Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,\n  Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze\n  Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard\n  Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.\n  Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,\n  Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine\n  By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore\n  With ravishment beheld, there best beheld\n  Where universally admir'd; but here\n  In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,\n  Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne\n  Half what in thee is fair, one man except,\n  Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen\n  A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd\n  By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.\n\n    So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;\n  Into the Heart of EVE his words made way,\n  Though at the voice much marveling; at length\n  Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.\n  What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc't\n  By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?\n  The first at lest of these I thought deni'd\n  To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day\n  Created mute to all articulat sound;\n  The latter I demurre, for in thir looks\n  Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.\n  Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field\n  I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;\n  Redouble then this miracle, and say,\n  How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how\n  To me so friendly grown above the rest\n  Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?\n  Say, for such wonder claims attention due.\n\n    To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.\n  Empress of this fair World, resplendent EVE,\n  Easie to mee it is to tell thee all\n  What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:\n  I was at first as other Beasts that graze\n  The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,\n  As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd\n  Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:\n  Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd\n  A goodly Tree farr distant to behold\n  Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,\n  Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;\n  When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,\n  Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense\n  Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats\n  Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,\n  Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.\n  To satisfie the sharp desire I had\n  Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd\n  Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,\n  Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent\n  Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.\n  About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,\n  For high from ground the branches would require\n  Thy utmost reach or ADAMS: Round the Tree\n  All other Beasts that saw, with like desire\n  Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.\n  Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung\n  Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill\n  I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour\n  At Feed or Fountain never had I found.\n  Sated at length, ere long I might perceave\n  Strange alteration in me, to degree\n  Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech\n  Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.\n  Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep\n  I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind\n  Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,\n  Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;\n  But all that fair and good in thy Divine\n  Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray\n  United I beheld; no Fair to thine\n  Equivalent or second, which compel'd\n  Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come\n  And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd\n  Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.\n\n    So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and EVE\n  Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd.\n\n    Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt\n  The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:\n  But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?\n  For many are the Trees of God that grow\n  In Paradise, and various, yet unknown\n  To us, in such abundance lies our choice,\n  As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,\n  Still hanging incorruptible, till men\n  Grow up to thir provision, and more hands\n  Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.\n\n    To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.\n  Empress, the way is readie, and not long,\n  Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,\n  Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past\n  Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept\n  My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.\n\n    Lead then, said EVE.  Hee leading swiftly rowld\n  In tangles, and make intricate seem strait,\n  To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy\n  Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire\n  Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night\n  Condenses, and the cold invirons round,\n  Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,\n  Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,\n  Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,\n  Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way\n  To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole,\n  There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.\n  So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud\n  Led EVE our credulous Mother, to the Tree\n  Of prohibition, root of all our woe;\n  Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.\n\n    Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,\n  Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,\n  The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,\n  Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.\n  But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;\n  God so commanded, and left that Command\n  Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live\n  Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.\n\n    To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.\n  Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit\n  Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,\n  Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire?\n\n    To whom thus EVE yet sinless.  Of the Fruit\n  Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,\n  But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst\n  The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate\n  Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.\n\n    She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold\n  The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love\n  To Man, and indignation at his wrong,\n  New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,\n  Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act\n  Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.\n  As when of old som Orator renound\n  In ATHENS or free ROME, where Eloquence\n  Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,\n  Stood in himself collected, while each part,\n  Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,\n  Somtimes in highth began, as no delay\n  Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.\n  So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown\n  The Tempter all impassiond thus began.\n\n    O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,\n  Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power\n  Within me cleere, not onely to discerne\n  Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes\n  Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.\n  Queen of this Universe, doe not believe\n  Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:\n  How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life\n  To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,\n  Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,\n  And life more perfet have attaind then Fate\n  Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.\n  Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast\n  Is open? or will God incense his ire\n  For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise\n  Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain\n  Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,\n  Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade\n  To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;\n  Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil\n  Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?\n  God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;\n  Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:\n  Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.\n  Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,\n  Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,\n  His worshippers; he knows that in the day\n  Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,\n  Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then\n  Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,\n  Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.\n  That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,\n  Internal Man, is but proportion meet,\n  I of brute human, yee of human Gods.\n  So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off\n  Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,\n  Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring\n  And what are Gods that Man may not become\n  As they, participating God-like food?\n  The Gods are first, and that advantage use\n  On our belief, that all from them proceeds,\n  I question it, for this fair Earth I see,\n  Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,\n  Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd\n  Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,\n  That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains\n  Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies\n  Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?\n  What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree\n  Impart against his will if all be his?\n  Or is it envie, and can envie dwell\n  In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more\n  Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.\n  Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.\n\n    He ended, and his words replete with guile\n  Into her heart too easie entrance won:\n  Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold\n  Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound\n  Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd\n  With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;\n  Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd\n  An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell\n  So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,\n  Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,\n  Sollicited her longing eye; yet first\n  Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd.\n\n    Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,\n  Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd,\n  Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay\n  Gave elocution to the mute, and taught\n  The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:\n  Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,\n  Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree\n  Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;\n  Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding\n  Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good\n  By thee communicated, and our want:\n  For good unknown, sure is not had, or had\n  And yet unknown, is as not had at all.\n  In plain then, what forbids he but to know,\n  Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?\n  Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death\n  Bind us with after-bands, what profits then\n  Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate\n  Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.\n  How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,\n  And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,\n  Irrational till then.  For us alone\n  Was death invented? or to us deni'd\n  This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?\n  For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first\n  Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy\n  The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,\n  Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.\n  What fear I then, rather what know to feare\n  Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,\n  Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?\n  Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,\n  Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,\n  Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then\n  To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?\n\n    So saying, her rash hand in evil hour\n  Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:\n  Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat\n  Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,\n  That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk\n  The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for EVE\n  Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else\n  Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,\n  In Fruit she never tasted, whether true\n  Or fansied so, through expectation high\n  Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.\n  Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,\n  And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,\n  And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,\n  Thus to her self she pleasingly began.\n\n    O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\n  In Paradise, of operation blest\n  To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\n  And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\n  Created; but henceforth my early care,\n  Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\n  Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\n  Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\n  Till dieted by thee I grow mature\n  In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\n  Though others envie what they cannot give;\n  For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\n  Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\n  Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\n  In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\n  And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\n  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\n  High and remote to see from thence distinct\n  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\n  May have diverted from continual watch\n  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\n  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort\n  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\n  As yet my change, and give him to partake\n  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\n  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\n  Without Copartner? so to add what wants\n  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\n  And render me more equal, and perhaps\n  A thing not undesireable, somtime\n  Superior; for inferior who is free?\n  This may be well: but what if God have seen,\n  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\n  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,\n  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\n  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,\n  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:\n  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\n  I could endure; without him live no life.\n\n    So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\n  But first low Reverence don, as to the power\n  That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\n  Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\n  From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while\n  Waiting desirous her return, had wove\n  Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\n  Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown\n  As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\n  Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\n  Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\n  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\n  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\n  And forth to meet her went, the way she took\n  That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\n  Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\n  Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\n  A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\n  New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\n  To him she hasted, in her face excuse\n  Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\n  Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\n\n    Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?\n  Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\n  Thy presence, agonie of love till now\n  Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\n  Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\n  The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\n  Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\n  This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\n  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\n  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\n  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\n  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\n  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\n  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\n  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\n  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\n  Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\n  Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\n  Have also tasted, and have also found\n  Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\n  Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\n  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\n  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\n  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\n  Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\n  Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\n  May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\n  Least thou not tasting, different degree\n  Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\n  Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\n\n    Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;\n  But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\n  On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard\n  The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,\n  Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\n  Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\n  From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE\n  Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\n  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\n  First to himself he inward silence broke.\n\n    O fairest of Creation, last and best\n  Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd\n  Whatever can to fight or thought be found,\n  Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!\n  How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,\n  Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?\n  Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress\n  The strict forbiddance, how to violate\n  The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud\n  Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,\n  And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee\n  Certain my resolution is to Die;\n  How can I live without thee, how forgoe\n  Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,\n  To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?\n  Should God create another EVE, and I\n  Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee\n  Would never from my heart; no no, I feel\n  The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,\n  Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State\n  Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.\n\n    So having said, as one from sad dismay\n  Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd\n  Submitting to what seemd remediless,\n  Thus in calme mood his Words to EVE he turnd.\n\n    Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous EVE,\n  And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd\n  Had it bin onely coveting to Eye\n  That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,\n  Much more to taste it under banne to touch.\n  But past who can recall, or don undoe?\n  Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so\n  Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact\n  Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,\n  Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first\n  Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;\n  Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,\n  Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man\n  Higher degree of Life, inducement strong\n  To us, as likely tasting to attaine\n  Proportional ascent, which cannot be\n  But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.\n  Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,\n  Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy\n  Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,\n  Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,\n  For us created, needs with us must faile,\n  Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,\n  Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,\n  Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power\n  Creation could repeate, yet would be loath\n  Us to abolish, least the Adversary\n  Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God\n  Most Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first\n  He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?\n  Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.\n  However I with thee have fixt my Lot,\n  Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death\n  Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;\n  So forcible within my heart I feel\n  The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,\n  My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;\n  Our State cannot be severd, we are one,\n  One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.\n\n    So ADAM, and thus EVE to him repli'd.\n  O glorious trial of exceeding Love,\n  Illustrious evidence, example high!\n  Ingaging me to emulate, but short\n  Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,\n  ADAM, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,\n  And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,\n  One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff\n  This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,\n  Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread\n  Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,\n  To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,\n  If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,\n  Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,\n  Direct, or by occasion hath presented\n  This happie trial of thy Love, which else\n  So eminently never had bin known.\n  Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue\n  This my attempt, I would sustain alone\n  The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die\n  Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact\n  Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd\n  Remarkably so late of thy so true,\n  So faithful Love unequald; but I feel\n  Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life\n  Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,\n  Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before\n  Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.\n  On my experience, ADAM, freely taste,\n  And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.\n\n    So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy\n  Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love\n  Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr\n  Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.\n  In recompence (for such compliance bad\n  Such recompence best merits) from the bough\n  She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit\n  With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat\n  Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,\n  But fondly overcome with Femal charm.\n  Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again\n  In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,\n  Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops\n  Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin\n  Original; while ADAM took no thought,\n  Eating his fill, nor EVE to iterate\n  Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe\n  Him with her lov'd societie, that now\n  As with new Wine intoxicated both\n  They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel\n  Divinitie within them breeding wings\n  Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit\n  Farr other operation first displaid,\n  Carnal desire enflaming, hee on EVE\n  Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him\n  As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:\n  Till ADAM thus 'gan EVE to dalliance move.\n\n    EVE, now I see thou art exact of taste,\n  And elegant, of Sapience no small part,\n  Since to each meaning savour we apply,\n  And Palate call judicious; I the praise\n  Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.\n  Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd\n  From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now\n  True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be\n  In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,\n  For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.\n  But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,\n  As meet is, after such delicious Fare;\n  For never did thy Beautie since the day\n  I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd\n  With all perfections, so enflame my sense\n  With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now\n  Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.\n\n    So said he, and forbore not glance or toy\n  Of amorous intent, well understood\n  Of EVE, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.\n  Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,\n  Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd\n  He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,\n  Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,\n  And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.\n  There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport\n  Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,\n  The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep\n  Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.\n  Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,\n  That with exhilerating vapour bland\n  About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers\n  Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep\n  Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams\n  Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose\n  As from unrest, and each the other viewing,\n  Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds\n  How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile\n  Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,\n  Just confidence, and native righteousness,\n  And honour from about them, naked left\n  To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe\n  Uncover'd more.  So rose the DANITE strong\n  HERCULEAN SAMSON from the Harlot-lap\n  Of PHILISTEAN DALILAH, and wak'd\n  Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare\n  Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face\n  Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute,\n  Till ADAM, though not less then EVE abasht,\n  At length gave utterance to these words constraind.\n\n    O EVE, in evil hour thou didst give care\n  To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught\n  To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,\n  False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes\n  Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know\n  Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,\n  Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,\n  Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,\n  Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,\n  Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,\n  And in our Faces evident the signes\n  Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;\n  Even shame, the last of evils; of the first\n  Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face\n  Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy\n  And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes\n  Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze\n  Insufferably bright.  O might I here\n  In solitude live savage, in some glad\n  Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable\n  To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,\n  And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,\n  Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs\n  Hide me, where I may never see them more.\n  But let us now, as in bad plight, devise\n  What best may for the present serve to hide\n  The Parts of each from other, that seem most\n  To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,\n  Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,\n  And girded on our loyns, may cover round\n  Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,\n  There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.\n\n    So counsel'd hee, and both together went\n  Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose\n  The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,\n  But such as at this day to INDIANS known\n  In MALABAR or DECAN spreds her Armes\n  Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground\n  The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow\n  About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade\n  High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;\n  There oft the INDIAN Herdsman shunning heate\n  Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds\n  At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves\n  They gatherd, broad as AMAZONIAN Targe,\n  And with what skill they had, together sowd,\n  To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide\n  Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike\n  To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late\n  COLUMBUS found th' AMERICAN to girt\n  With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde\n  Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.\n  Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part\n  Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,\n  They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares\n  Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within\n  Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,\n  Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore\n  Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once\n  And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:\n  For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will\n  Heard not her lore, both in subjection now\n  To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe\n  Usurping over sovran Reason claimd\n  Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,\n  ADAM, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,\n  Speech intermitted thus to EVE renewd.\n\n    Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd\n  With me, as I besought thee, when that strange\n  Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,\n  I know not whence possessd thee; we had then\n  Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild\n  Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.\n  Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve\n  The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek\n  Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.\n\n    To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus EVE.\n  What words have past thy Lips, ADAM severe,\n  Imput'st thou that to my default, or will\n  Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows\n  But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,\n  Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,\n  Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd\n  Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;\n  No ground of enmitie between us known,\n  Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.\n  Was I to have never parted from thy side?\n  As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.\n  Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head\n  Command me absolutely not to go,\n  Going into such danger as thou saidst?\n  Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,\n  Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.\n  Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,\n  Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee.\n\n    To whom then first incenst ADAM repli'd.\n  Is this the Love, is the recompence\n  Of mine to thee, ingrateful EVE, exprest\n  Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,\n  Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,\n  Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:\n  And am I now upbraided, as the cause\n  Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,\n  It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?\n  I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold\n  The danger, and the lurking Enemie\n  That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,\n  And force upon free Will hath here no place.\n  But confidence then bore thee on, secure\n  Either to meet no danger, or to finde\n  Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps\n  I also err'd in overmuch admiring\n  What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought\n  No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue\n  That errour now, which is become my crime,\n  And thou th' accuser.  Thus it shall befall\n  Him who to worth in Women overtrusting\n  Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,\n  And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,\n  Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.\n\n    Thus they in mutual accusation spent\n  The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning\n  And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.\n\n       THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST\n\n  BOOK IX.\n\n\n    Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act\n  Of SATAN done in Paradise, and how\n  Hee in the Serpent had perverted EVE,\n  Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,\n  Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye\n  Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart\n  Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,\n  Hinder'd not SATAN to attempt the minde\n  Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm'd,\n  Complete to have discover'd and repulst\n  Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.\n  For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd\n  The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,\n  Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,\n  Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie,\n  And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall.\n  Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast\n  Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad\n  For Man, for of his state by this they knew,\n  Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln\n  Entrance unseen.  Soon as th' unwelcome news\n  From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd\n  All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare\n  That time Celestial visages, yet mixt\n  With pitie, violated not thir bliss.\n  About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes\n  Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know\n  How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream\n  Accountable made haste to make appear\n  With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,\n  And easily approv'd; when the most High\n  Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,\n  Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice.\n\n    Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd\n  From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,\n  Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth,\n  Which your sincerest care could not prevent,\n  Foretold so lately what would come to pass,\n  When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell.\n  I told ye then he should prevail and speed\n  On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't\n  And flatter'd out of all, believing lies\n  Against his Maker; no Decree of mine\n  Concurring to necessitate his Fall,\n  Or touch with lightest moment of impulse\n  His free Will, to her own inclining left\n  In eevn scale.  But fall'n he is, and now\n  What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass\n  On his transgression, Death denounc't that day,\n  Which he presumes already vain and void,\n  Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd,\n  By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find\n  Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.\n  Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd.\n  But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee\n  Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd\n  All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth; or Hell.\n  Easie it may be seen that I intend\n  Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee\n  Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd\n  Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,\n  And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n.\n\n    So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright\n  Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son\n  Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full\n  Resplendent all his Father manifest\n  Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde.\n\n    Father Eternal, thine is to decree,\n  Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will\n  Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd\n  Mayst ever rest well pleas'd.  I go to judge\n  On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,\n  Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light,\n  When time shall be, for so I undertook\n  Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine\n  Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom\n  On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so\n  Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most\n  Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.\n  Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none\n  Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd,\n  Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd,\n  Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law\n  Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.\n\n    Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose\n  Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,\n  Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant\n  Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence\n  EDEN and all the Coast in prospect lay.\n  Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods\n  Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd.\n  Now was the Sun in Western cadence low\n  From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour\n  To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in\n  The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole\n  Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both\n  To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard\n  Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes\n  Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard\n  And from his presence hid themselves among\n  The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God\n  Approaching, thus to ADAM call'd aloud.\n\n    Where art thou ADAM, wont with joy to meet\n  My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,\n  Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude,\n  Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught:\n  Or come I less conspicuous, or what change\n  Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.\n  He came, and with him EVE, more loth, though first\n  To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd;\n  Love was not in thir looks, either to God\n  Or to each other, but apparent guilt,\n  And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,\n  Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.\n  Whence ADAM faultring long, thus answer'd brief.\n\n    I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice\n  Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom\n  The gracious Judge without revile repli'd.\n\n    My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd,\n  But still rejoyc't, how is it now become\n  So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who\n  Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree\n  Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?\n\n    To whom thus ADAM sore beset repli'd.\n  O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand\n  Before my Judge, either to undergoe\n  My self the total Crime, or to accuse\n  My other self, the partner of my life;\n  Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,\n  I should conceal, and not expose to blame\n  By my complaint; but strict necessitie\n  Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,\n  Least on my head both sin and punishment,\n  However insupportable, be all\n  Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou\n  Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.\n  This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,\n  And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good,\n  So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,\n  That from her hand I could suspect no ill,\n  And what she did, whatever in it self,\n  Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed;\n  Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.\n\n    To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd.\n  Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey\n  Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,\n  Superior, or but equal, that to her\n  Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place\n  Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,\n  And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd\n  Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd\n  She was indeed, and lovely to attract\n  Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts\n  Were such as under Government well seem'd,\n  Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part\n  And person, had'st thou known thy self aright.\n\n    So having said, he thus to EVE in few:\n  Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?\n\n    To whom sad EVE with shame nigh overwhelm'd,\n  Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge\n  Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd.\n\n    The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate.\n\n    Which when the Lord God heard, without delay\n  To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd\n  Serpent though brute, unable to transferre\n  The Guilt on him who made him instrument\n  Of mischief, and polluted from the end\n  Of his Creation; justly then accurst,\n  As vitiated in Nature: more to know\n  Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew)\n  Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last\n  To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd,\n  Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best:\n  And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.\n\n    Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst\n  Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;\n  Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,\n  And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.\n  Between Thee and the Woman I will put\n  Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;\n  Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.\n\n    So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd\n  When JESUS son of MARY second EVE,\n  Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n,\n  Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave\n  Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht\n  In open shew, and with ascention bright\n  Captivity led captive through the Aire,\n  The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,\n  Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;\n  Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,\n  And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd.\n\n    Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie\n  By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring\n  In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will\n  Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.\n\n    On ADAM last thus judgement he pronounc'd.\n  Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife,\n  And eaten of the Tree concerning which\n  I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,\n  Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow\n  Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;\n  Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth\n  Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field,\n  In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,\n  Till thou return unto the ground, for thou\n  Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,\n  For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.\n\n     So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,\n  And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day\n  Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood\n  Before him naked to the aire, that now\n  Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin\n  Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,\n  As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now\n  As Father of his Familie he clad\n  Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,\n  Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;\n  And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:\n  Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins\n  Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more\n  Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,\n  Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight.\n  To him with swift ascent he up returnd,\n  Into his blissful bosom reassum'd\n  In glory as of old, to him appeas'd\n  All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man\n  Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.\n  Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth,\n  Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,\n  In counterview within the Gates, that now\n  Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame\n  Farr into CHAOS, since the Fiend pass'd through,\n  Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.\n\n    O Son, why sit we here each other viewing\n  Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives\n  In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides\n  For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be\n  But that success attends him; if mishap,\n  Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n\n  By his Avenger, since no place like this\n  Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.\n  Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,\n  Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large\n  Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,\n  Or sympathie, or som connatural force\n  Powerful at greatest distance to unite\n  With secret amity things of like kinde\n  By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade\n  Inseparable must with mee along:\n  For Death from Sin no power can separate.\n  But least the difficultie of passing back\n  Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe\n  Impassable, impervious, let us try\n  Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine\n  Not unagreeable, to found a path\n  Over this Maine from Hell to that new World\n  Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument\n  Of merit high to all th' infernal Host,\n  Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,\n  Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.\n  Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn\n  By this new felt attraction and instinct.\n\n    Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.\n  Goe whither Fate and inclination strong\n  Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre\n  The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw\n  Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste\n  The savour of Death from all things there that live:\n  Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest\n  Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.\n\n    So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell\n  Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock\n  Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,\n  Against the day of Battel, to a Field,\n  Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd\n  With sent of living Carcasses design'd\n  For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.\n  So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd\n  His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,\n  Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.\n  Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste\n  Wide Anarchie of CHAOS damp and dark\n  Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)\n  Hovering upon the Waters; what they met\n  Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea\n  Tost up and down, together crowded drove\n  From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.\n  As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse\n  Upon the CRONIAN Sea, together drive\n  Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way\n  Beyond PETSORA Eastward, to the rich\n  CATHAIAN Coast.  The aggregated Soyle\n  Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,\n  As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm\n  As DELOS floating once; the rest his look\n  Bound with GORGONIAN rigor not to move,\n  And with ASPHALTIC slime; broad as the Gate,\n  Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach\n  They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on\n  Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge\n  Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall\n  Immoveable of this now fenceless world\n  Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,\n  Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.\n  So, if great things to small may be compar'd,\n  XERXES, the Libertie of GREECE to yoke,\n  From SUSA his MEMNONIAN Palace high\n  Came to the Sea, and over HELLESPONT\n  Bridging his way, EUROPE with ASIA joyn'd,\n  And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves.\n  Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art\n  Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock\n  Over the vext Abyss, following the track\n  Of SATAN, to the selfsame place where hee\n  First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe\n  From out of CHAOS to the outside bare\n  Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant\n  And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made\n  And durable; and now in little space\n  The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n\n  And of this World, and on the left hand Hell\n  With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes\n  In sight, to each of these three places led.\n  And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd,\n  To Paradise first tending, when behold\n  SATAN in likeness of an Angel bright\n  Betwixt the CENTAURE and the SCORPION stearing\n  His ZENITH, while the Sun in ARIES rose:\n  Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear\n  Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise.\n  Hee, after EVE seduc't, unminded slunk\n  Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape\n  To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act\n  By EVE, though all unweeting, seconded\n  Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought\n  Vain covertures; but when he saw descend\n  The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd\n  Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun\n  The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth\n  Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd\n  By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire\n  Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,\n  Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood\n  Not instant, but of future time.  With joy\n  And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd,\n  And at the brink of CHAOS, neer the foot\n  Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't\n  Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.\n  Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight\n  Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd.\n  Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire\n  Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.\n\n    O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,\n  Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own,\n  Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:\n  For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd,\n  My Heart, which by a secret harmonie\n  Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet,\n  That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks\n  Now also evidence, but straight I felt\n  Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt\n  That I must after thee with this thy Son;\n  Such fatal consequence unites us three:\n  Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,\n  Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure\n  Detain from following thy illustrious track.\n  Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd\n  Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd\n  To fortifie thus farr, and overlay\n  With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.\n  Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won\n  What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd\n  With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd\n  Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,\n  There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,\n  As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World\n  Retiring, by his own doom alienated,\n  And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide\n  Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds,\n  His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,\n  Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne.\n\n    Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.\n  Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,\n  High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race\n  Of SATAN (for I glorie in the name,\n  Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King)\n  Amply have merited of me, of all\n  Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore\n  Triumphal with triumphal act have met,\n  Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm\n  Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent\n  Of easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I\n  Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease\n  To my associate Powers, them to acquaint\n  With these successes, and with them rejoyce,\n  You two this way, among those numerous Orbs\n  All yours, right down to Paradise descend;\n  There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth\n  Dominion exercise and in the Aire,\n  Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd,\n  Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.\n  My Substitutes I send ye, and Create\n  Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might\n  Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now\n  My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,\n  Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit.\n  If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell\n  No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.\n\n    So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed\n  Thir course through thickest Constellations held\n  Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,\n  And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips\n  Then sufferd.  Th' other way SATAN went down\n  The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side\n  Disparted CHAOS over built exclaimd,\n  And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,\n  That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate,\n  Wide open and unguarded, SATAN pass'd,\n  And all about found desolate; for those\n  Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,\n  Flown to the upper World; the rest were all\n  Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls\n  Of PANDEMONIUM, Citie and proud seate\n  Of LUCIFER, so by allusion calld,\n  Of that bright Starr to SATAN paragond.\n  There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand\n  In Council sate, sollicitous what chance\n  Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee\n  Departing gave command, and they observ'd.\n  As when the TARTAR from his RUSSIAN Foe\n  By ASTRACAN over the Snowie Plaines\n  Retires, or BACTRIAN Sophi from the hornes\n  Of TURKISH Crescent, leaves all waste beyond\n  The Realme of ALADULE, in his retreate\n  To TAURIS or CASBEEN.  So these the late\n  Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell\n  Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch\n  Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting\n  Each hour their great adventurer from the search\n  Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,\n  In shew plebeian Angel militant\n  Of lowest order, past; and from the dore\n  Of that PLUTONIAN Hall, invisible\n  Ascended his high Throne, which under state\n  Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end\n  Was plac't in regal lustre.  Down a while\n  He sate, and round about him saw unseen:\n  At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head\n  And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad\n  With what permissive glory since his fall\n  Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd\n  At that so sudden blaze the STYGIAN throng\n  Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld,\n  Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime:\n  Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers,\n  Rais'd from thir dark DIVAN, and with like joy\n  Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand\n  Silence, and with these words attention won.\n\n    Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\n  For in possession such, not onely of right,\n  I call ye and declare ye now, returnd\n  Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth\n  Triumphant out of this infernal Pit\n  Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,\n  And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,\n  As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven\n  Little inferiour, by my adventure hard\n  With peril great atchiev'd.  Long were to tell\n  What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine\n  Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep\n  Of horrible confusion, over which\n  By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd\n  To expedite your glorious march; but I\n  Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride\n  Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb\n  Of unoriginal NIGHT and CHAOS wilde,\n  That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd\n  My journey strange, with clamorous uproare\n  Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found\n  The new created World, which fame in Heav'n\n  Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful\n  Of absolute perfection, therein Man\n  Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile\n  Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd\n  From his Creator, and the more to increase\n  Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat\n  Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up\n  Both his beloved Man and all his World,\n  To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,\n  Without our hazard, labour or allarme,\n  To range in, and to dwell, and over Man\n  To rule, as over all he should have rul'd.\n  True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather\n  Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape\n  Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs,\n  Is enmity, which he will put between\n  Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;\n  His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:\n  A World who would not purchase with a bruise,\n  Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th' account\n  Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,\n  But up and enter now into full bliss.\n\n    So having said, a while he stood, expecting\n  Thir universal shout and high applause\n  To fill his eare, when contrary he hears\n  On all sides, from innumerable tongues\n  A dismal universal hiss, the sound\n  Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long\n  Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;\n  His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,\n  His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining\n  Each other, till supplanted down he fell\n  A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,\n  Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power\n  Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,\n  According to his doom: he would have spoke,\n  But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue\n  To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd\n  Alike, to Serpents all as accessories\n  To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din\n  Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now\n  With complicated monsters, head and taile,\n  Scorpion and Asp, and AMPHISBAENA dire,\n  CERASTES hornd, HYDRUS, and ELLOPS drear,\n  And DIPSAS (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil\n  Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle\n  OPHIUSA) but still greatest hee the midst,\n  Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun\n  Ingenderd in the PYTHIAN Vale on slime,\n  Huge PYTHON, and his Power no less he seem'd\n  Above the rest still to retain; they all\n  Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,\n  Where all yet left of that revolted Rout\n  Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,\n  Sublime with expectation when to see\n  In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;\n  They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd\n  Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,\n  And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,\n  They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,\n  Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,\n  And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form\n  Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,\n  As in thir crime.  Thus was th' applause they meant,\n  Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame\n  Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood\n  A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,\n  His will who reigns above, to aggravate\n  Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that\n  VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE\n  Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange\n  Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining\n  For one forbidden Tree a multitude\n  Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;\n  Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,\n  Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,\n  But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees\n  Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks\n  That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd\n  The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew\n  Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd;\n  This more delusive, not the touch, but taste\n  Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay\n  Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit\n  Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste\n  VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,\n  Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,\n  VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws\n  VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell\n  Into the same illusion, not as Man\n  Whom they triumph'd once lapst.  Thus were they plagu'd\n  And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,\n  Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,\n  Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo\n  This annual humbling certain number'd days,\n  To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.\n  However some tradition they dispers'd\n  Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,\n  And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld\n  OPHION with EURYNOME, the wide-\n  Encroaching EVE perhaps, had first the rule\n  Of high OLYMPUS, thence by SATURN driv'n\n  And OPS, ere yet DICTAEAN JOVE was born.\n  Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair\n  Too soon arriv'd, SIN there in power before,\n  Once actual, now in body, and to dwell\n  Habitual habitant; behind her DEATH\n  Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet\n  On his pale Horse: to whom SIN thus began.\n\n    Second of SATAN sprung, all conquering Death,\n  What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd\n  With travail difficult, not better farr\n  Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,\n  Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd?\n\n    Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.\n  To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,\n  Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,\n  There best, where most with ravin I may meet;\n  Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems\n  To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.\n\n    To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd.\n  Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours\n  Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,\n  No homely morsels, and whatever thing\n  The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd,\n  Till I in Man residing through the Race,\n  His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,\n  And season him thy last and sweetest prey.\n\n    This said, they both betook them several wayes,\n  Both to destroy, or unimmortal make\n  All kinds, and for destruction to mature\n  Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing,\n  From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,\n  To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.\n\n    See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance\n  To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I\n  So fair and good created, and had still\n  Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man\n  Let in these wastful Furies, who impute\n  Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell\n  And his Adherents, that with so much ease\n  I suffer them to enter and possess\n  A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem\n  To gratifie my scornful Enemies,\n  That laugh, as if transported with some fit\n  Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,\n  At random yeilded up to their misrule;\n  And know not that I call'd and drew them thither\n  My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth\n  Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed\n  On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst\n  With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling\n  Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,\n  Both SIN, and DEATH, and yawning GRAVE at last\n  Through CHAOS hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell\n  For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.\n  Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure\n  To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:\n  Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes.\n\n    Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud\n  Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas,\n  Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\n  Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\n  Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\n  Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\n  Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five\n  Thir planetarie motions and aspects\n  In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,\n  Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\n  In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\n  Thir influence malignant when to showre,\n  Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\n  Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\n  Thir corners, when with bluster to confound\n  Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\n  With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\n  Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\n  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\n  From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd\n  Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\n  Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode\n  Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n\n  ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins\n  Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine\n  By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,\n  As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change\n  Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\n  Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,\n  Equal in Days and Nights, except to those\n  Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\n  Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\n  To recompence his distance, in thir sight\n  Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known\n  Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow\n  From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr\n  Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\n  His course intended; else how had the World\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\n\n    O miserable of happie! is this the end\n  Of this new glorious World, and mee so late\n  The Glory of that Glory, who now becom\n  Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face\n  Of God, whom to behold was then my highth\n  Of happiness: yet well, if here would end\n  The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare\n  My own deservings; but this will not serve;\n  All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,\n  Is propagated curse.  O voice once heard\n  Delightfully, ENCREASE AND MULTIPLY,\n  Now death to heare! for what can I encrease\n  Or multiplie, but curses on my head?\n  Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling\n  The evil on him brought by me, will curse\n  My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,\n  For this we may thank ADAM; but his thanks\n  Shall be the execration; so besides\n  Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee\n  Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,\n  On mee as on thir natural center light\n  Heavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes\n  Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!\n  Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay\n  To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee\n  From darkness to promote me, or here place\n  In this delicious Garden? as my Will\n  Concurd not to my being, it were but right\n  And equal to reduce me to my dust,\n  Desirous to resigne, and render back\n  All I receav'd, unable to performe\n  Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold\n  The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,\n  Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added\n  The sense of endless woes? inexplicable\n  Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,\n  I thus contest; then should have been refusd\n  Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd:\n  Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,\n  Then cavil the conditions? and though God\n  Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son\n  Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort,\n  Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:\n  Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee\n  That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,\n  But Natural necessity begot.\n  God made thee of choice his own, and of his own\n  To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,\n  Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.\n  Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,\n  That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:\n  O welcom hour whenever! why delayes\n  His hand to execute what his Decree\n  Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,\n  Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out\n  To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet\n  Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth\n  Insensible, how glad would lay me down\n  As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest\n  And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more\n  Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse\n  To mee and to my ofspring would torment me\n  With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt\n  Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,\n  Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man\n  Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish\n  With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,\n  Or in some other dismal place, who knows\n  But I shall die a living Death?  O thought\n  Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath\n  Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life\n  And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.\n  All of me then shall die: let this appease\n  The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.\n  For though the Lord of all be infinite,\n  Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,\n  But mortal doom'd.  How can he exercise\n  Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?\n  Can he make deathless Death? that were to make\n  Strange contradiction, which to God himself\n  Impossible is held, as Argument\n  Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,\n  For angers sake, finite to infinite\n  In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour\n  Satisfi'd never; that were to extend\n  His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,\n  By which all Causes else according still\n  To the reception of thir matter act,\n  Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare.  But say\n  That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd,\n  Bereaving sense, but endless miserie\n  From this day onward, which I feel begun\n  Both in me, and without me, and so last\n  To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear\n  Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution\n  On my defensless head; both Death and I\n  Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,\n  Nor I on my part single, in mee all\n  Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie\n  That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able\n  To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!\n  So disinherited how would ye bless\n  Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind\n  For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd,\n  If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,\n  But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd,\n  Not to do onely, but to will the same\n  With me? how can they acquitted stand\n  In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes\n  Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain\n  And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still\n  But to my own conviction: first and last\n  On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring\n  Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;\n  So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support\n  That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,\n  Then all the world much heavier, though divided\n  With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir'st,\n  And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope\n  Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable\n  Beyond all past example and future,\n  To SATAN onely like both crime and doom.\n  O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears\n  And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which\n  I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd!\n\n    Thus ADAM to himself lamented loud\n  Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,\n  Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air\n  Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,\n  Which to his evil Conscience represented\n  All things with double terror: On the ground\n  Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft\n  Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd\n  Of tardie execution, since denounc't\n  The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,\n  Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke\n  To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,\n  Justice Divine not hast'n to be just?\n  But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine\n  Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.\n  O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,\n  VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades\n  To answer, and resound farr other Song.\n  VVhom thus afflicted when sad EVE beheld,\n  Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,\n  Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd:\n  But her with stern regard he thus repell'd.\n\n    Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best\n  Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false\n  And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,\n  Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew\n  Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee\n  Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended\n  To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee\n  I had persisted happie, had not thy pride\n  And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,\n  Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd\n  Not to be trusted, longing to be seen\n  Though by the Devil himself, him overweening\n  To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting\n  Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee,\n  To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise,\n  Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,\n  And understood not all was but a shew\n  Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib\n  Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,\n  More to the part sinister from me drawn,\n  Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie\n  To my just number found.  O why did God,\n  Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n\n  With Spirits Masculine, create at last\n  This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect\n  Of Nature, and not fill the World at once\n  With Men as Angels without Feminine,\n  Or find some other way to generate\n  Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n,\n  And more that shall befall, innumerable\n  Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,\n  And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either\n  He never shall find out fit Mate, but such\n  As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,\n  Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain\n  Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind\n  By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld\n  By Parents, or his happiest choice too late\n  Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound\n  To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:\n  Which infinite calamitie shall cause\n  To humane life, and houshold peace confound.\n\n    He added not, and from her turn'd, but EVE\n  Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing,\n  And tresses all disorderd, at his feet\n  Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught\n  His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.\n\n    Forsake me not thus, ADAM, witness Heav'n\n  What love sincere, and reverence in my heart\n  I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,\n  Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant\n  I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,\n  Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,\n  Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,\n  My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,\n  Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?\n  While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,\n  Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,\n  As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie\n  Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us,\n  That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not\n  Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n,\n  On me already lost, mee then thy self\n  More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou\n  Against God onely, I against God and thee,\n  And to the place of judgement will return,\n  There with my cries importune Heaven, that all\n  The sentence from thy head remov'd may light\n  On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,\n  Mee mee onely just object of his ire.\n\n    She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,\n  Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault\n  Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in ADAM wraught\n  Commiseration; soon his heart relented\n  Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,\n  Now at his feet submissive in distress,\n  Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,\n  His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide;\n  As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost,\n  And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon.\n\n    Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,\n  So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st\n  The punishment all on thy self; alas,\n  Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine\n  His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,\n  And my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers\n  Could alter high Decrees, I to that place\n  Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,\n  That on my head all might be visited,\n  Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n,\n  To me committed and by me expos'd.\n  But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame\n  Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive\n  In offices of Love, how we may light'n\n  Each others burden in our share of woe;\n  Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see,\n  Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill,\n  A long days dying to augment our paine,\n  And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd.\n\n    To whom thus EVE, recovering heart, repli'd.\n  ADAM, by sad experiment I know\n  How little weight my words with thee can finde,\n  Found so erroneous, thence by just event\n  Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,\n  Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place\n  Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine\n  Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,\n  Living or dying from thee I will not hide\n  What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n,\n  Tending to som relief of our extremes,\n  Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,\n  As in our evils, and of easier choice.\n  If care of our descent perplex us most,\n  Which must be born to certain woe, devourd\n  By Death at last, and miserable it is\n  To be to others cause of misery,\n  Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring\n  Into this cursed World a woful Race,\n  That after wretched Life must be at last\n  Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power\n  It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent\n  The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.\n  Childless thou art, Childless remaine:\n  So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two\n  Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw.\n  But if thou judge it hard and difficult,\n  Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain\n  From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,\n  And with desire to languish without hope,\n  Before the present object languishing\n  With like desire, which would be miserie\n  And torment less then none of what we dread,\n  Then both our selves and Seed at once to free\n  From what we fear for both, let us make short,\n  Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply\n  With our own hands his Office on our selves;\n  Why stand we longer shivering under feares,\n  That shew no end but Death, and have the power,\n  Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,\n  Destruction with destruction to destroy.\n\n    She ended heer, or vehement despaire\n  Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts\n  Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.\n  But ADAM with such counsel nothing sway'd,\n  To better hopes his more attentive minde\n  Labouring had rais'd, and thus to EVE repli'd.\n\n    EVE, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems\n  To argue in thee somthing more sublime\n  And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;\n  But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes\n  That excellence thought in thee, and implies,\n  Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret\n  For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd.\n  Or if thou covet death, as utmost end\n  Of miserie, so thinking to evade\n  The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God\n  Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so\n  To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death\n  So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine\n  We are by doom to pay; rather such acts\n  Of contumacie will provoke the highest\n  To make death in us live: Then let us seek\n  Som safer resolution, which methinks\n  I have in view, calling to minde with heed\n  Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise\n  The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless\n  Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe\n  SATAN, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd\n  Against us this deceit: to crush his head\n  Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost\n  By death brought on our selves, or childless days\n  Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe\n  Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee\n  Instead shall double ours upon our heads.\n  No more be mention'd then of violence\n  Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,\n  That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely\n  Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,\n  Reluctance against God and his just yoke\n  Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild\n  And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd\n  Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected\n  Immediate dissolution, which we thought\n  Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee\n  Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,\n  And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy,\n  Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope\n  Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne\n  My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;\n  My labour will sustain me; and least Cold\n  Or Heat should injure us, his timely care\n  Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands\n  Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd;\n  How much more, if we pray him, will his ear\n  Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,\n  And teach us further by what means to shun\n  Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,\n  Which now the Skie with various Face begins\n  To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds\n  Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks\n  Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek\n  Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish\n  Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr\n  Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams\n  Reflected, may with matter sere foment,\n  Or by collision of two bodies grinde\n  The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds\n  Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock\n  Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down\n  Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,\n  And sends a comfortable heat from farr,\n  Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,\n  And what may else be remedie or cure\n  To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,\n  Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace\n  Beseeching him, so as we need not fear\n  To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd\n  By him with many comforts, till we end\n  In dust, our final rest and native home.\n  What better can we do, then to the place\n  Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall\n  Before him reverent, and there confess\n  Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears\n  VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air\n  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\n  Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.\n  Undoubtedly he will relent and turn\n  From his displeasure; in whose look serene,\n  VVhen angry most he seem'd and most severe,\n  VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?\n\n    So spake our Father penitent, nor EVE\n  Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place\n  Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell\n  Before him reverent, and both confess'd\n  Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears\n  VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air\n  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\n  Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.\n\n       THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK.\n\n\n  PARADISE LOST.\n\n  BOOK X.\n\n  Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood\n  Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above\n  Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd\n  The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh\n  Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd\n  Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer\n  Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight\n  Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port\n  Not of mean suiters, nor important less\n  Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair\n  In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,\n  DEUCALION and chaste PYRRHA to restore\n  The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine\n  Of THEMIS stood devout.  To Heav'n thir prayers\n  Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes\n  Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd\n  Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad\n  With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,\n  By thir great Intercessor, came in sight\n  Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son\n  Presenting, thus to intercede began.\n\n    See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung\n  From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs\n  And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt\n  With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,\n  Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed\n  Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those\n  Which his own hand manuring all the Trees\n  Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n\n  From innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare\n  To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;\n  Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee\n  Interpret for him, mee his Advocate\n  And propitiation, all his works on mee\n  Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those\n  Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.\n  Accept me, and in mee from these receave\n  The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live\n  Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days\n  Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I\n  To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)\n  To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee\n  All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,\n  Made one with me as I with thee am one.\n\n    To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.\n  All thy request for Man, accepted Son,\n  Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:\n  But longer in that Paradise to dwell,\n  The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:\n  Those pure immortal Elements that know\n  No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,\n  Eject him tainted now, and purge him off\n  As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,\n  And mortal food, as may dispose him best\n  For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first\n  Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt\n  Corrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts\n  Created him endowd, with Happiness\n  And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,\n  This other serv'd but to eternize woe;\n  Till I provided Death; so Death becomes\n  His final remedie, and after Life\n  Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd\n  By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,\n  Wak't in the renovation of the just,\n  Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.\n  But let us call to Synod all the Blest\n  Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide\n  My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,\n  As how with peccant Angels late they saw;\n  And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.\n\n    He ended, and the Son gave signal high\n  To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew\n  His Trumpet, heard in OREB since perhaps\n  When God descended, and perhaps once more\n  To sound at general Doom.  Th' Angelic blast\n  Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs\n  Of AMARANTIN Shade, Fountain or Spring,\n  By the waters of Life, where ere they sate\n  In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light\n  Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,\n  And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream\n  Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.\n\n    O Sons, like one of us Man is become\n  To know both Good and Evil, since his taste\n  Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast\n  His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,\n  Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known\n  Good by it self, and Evil not at all.\n  He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,\n  My motions in him, longer then they move,\n  His heart I know, how variable and vain\n  Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand\n  Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,\n  And live for ever, dream at least to live\n  Forever, to remove him I decree,\n  And send him from the Garden forth to Till\n  The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.\n\n    MICHAEL, this my behest have thou in charge,\n  Take to thee from among the Cherubim\n  Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend\n  Or in behalf of Man, or to invade\n  Vacant possession som new trouble raise:\n  Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God\n  Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,\n  From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce\n  To them and to thir Progenie from thence\n  Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint\n  At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,\n  For I behold them soft'nd and with tears\n  Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.\n  If patiently thy bidding they obey,\n  Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\n  To ADAM what shall come in future dayes,\n  As I shall thee enlighten, intermix\n  My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;\n  So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:\n  And on the East side of the Garden place,\n  Where entrance up from EDEN easiest climbes,\n  Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame\n  Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,\n  And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:\n  Least Paradise a receptacle prove\n  To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,\n  With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.\n\n    He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd\n  For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright\n  Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each\n  Had, like a double JANUS, all thir shape\n  Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those\n  Of ARGUS, and more wakeful then to drouze,\n  Charm'd with ARCADIAN Pipe, the Pastoral Reed\n  Of HERMES, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile\n  To resalute the World with sacred Light\n  LEUCOTHEA wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd\n  The Earth, when ADAM and first Matron EVE\n  Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,\n  Strength added from above, new hope to spring\n  Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;\n  Which thus to EVE his welcome words renewd.\n\n    EVE, easily may Faith admit, that all\n  The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends\n  But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n\n  So prevalent as to concerne the mind\n  Of God high blest, or to incline his will,\n  Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,\n  Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne\n  Ev'n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught\n  By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,\n  Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,\n  Methought I saw him placable and mild,\n  Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew\n  That I was heard with favour; peace returnd\n  Home to my brest, and to my memorie\n  His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;\n  Which then not minded in dismay, yet now\n  Assures me that the bitterness of death\n  Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,\n  EVE rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,\n  Mother of all things living, since by thee\n  Man is to live, and all things live for Man.\n\n    To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek.\n  Ill worthie I such title should belong\n  To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\n  A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\n  Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\n  But infinite in pardon was my Judge,\n  That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't\n  The sourse of life; next favourable thou,\n  Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,\n  Farr other name deserving.  But the Field\n  To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,\n  Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\n  All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins\n  Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\n  I never from thy side henceforth to stray,\n  Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\n  Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\n  What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\n  Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.\n\n    So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate\n  Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest\n  On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd\n  After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight\n  The Bird of JOVE, stoopt from his aerie tour,\n  Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:\n  Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,\n  First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,\n  Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;\n  Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.\n  ADAM observ'd, and with his Eye the chase\n  Pursuing, not unmov'd to EVE thus spake.\n\n    O EVE, some furder change awaits us nigh,\n  Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews\n  Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn\n  Us haply too secure of our discharge\n  From penaltie, because from death releast\n  Some days; how long, and what till then our life,\n  Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,\n  And thither must return and be no more.\n  VVhy else this double object in our sight\n  Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground\n  One way the self-same hour? why in the East\n  Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light\n  More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws\n  O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,\n  And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.\n\n    He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands\n  Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now\n  In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,\n  A glorious Apparition, had not doubt\n  And carnal fear that day dimm'd ADAMS eye.\n  Not that more glorious, when the Angels met\n  JACOB in MAHANAIM, where he saw\n  The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;\n  Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd\n  In DOTHAN, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,\n  Against the SYRIAN King, who to surprize\n  One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,\n  Warr unproclam'd.  The Princely Hierarch\n  In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise\n  Possession of the Garden; hee alone,\n  To finde where ADAM shelterd, took his way,\n  Not unperceav'd of ADAM, who to EVE,\n  While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.\n\n    EVE, now expect great tidings, which perhaps\n  Of us will soon determin, or impose\n  New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie\n  From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill\n  One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate\n  None of the meanest, some great Potentate\n  Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie\n  Invests him coming; yet not terrible,\n  That I should fear, nor sociably mild,\n  As RAPHAEL, that I should much confide,\n  But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,\n  With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.\n  He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,\n  Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man\n  Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes\n  A militarie Vest of purple flowd\n  Livelier then MELIBOEAN, or the graine\n  Of SARRA, worn by Kings and Hero's old\n  In time of Truce; IRIS had dipt the wooff;\n  His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime\n  In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side\n  As in a glistering ZODIAC hung the Sword,\n  Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.\n  ADAM bowd low, hee Kingly from his State\n  Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.\n\n    ADAM, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:\n  Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,\n  Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,\n  Defeated of his seisure many dayes\n  Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,\n  And one bad act with many deeds well done\n  Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd\n  Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;\n  But longer in this Paradise to dwell\n  Permits not; to remove thee I am come,\n  And send thee from the Garden forth to till\n  The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.\n\n    He added not, for ADAM at the newes\n  Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,\n  That all his senses bound; EVE, who unseen\n  Yet all had heard, with audible lament\n  Discover'd soon the place of her retire.\n\n    O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!\n  Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave\n  Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,\n  Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,\n  Quiet though sad, the respit of that day\n  That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,\n  That never will in other Climate grow,\n  My early visitation, and my last\n  At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand\n  From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,\n  Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke\n  Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?\n  Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd\n  With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee\n  How shall I part, and whither wander down\n  Into a lower World, to this obscure\n  And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire\n  Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?\n\n    Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.\n  Lament not EVE, but patiently resigne\n  What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,\n  Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;\n  Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes\n  Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;\n  Where he abides, think there thy native soile.\n\n    ADAM by this from the cold sudden damp\n  Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,\n  To MICHAEL thus his humble words addressd.\n\n    Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd\n  Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem\n  Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould\n  Thy message, which might else in telling wound,\n  And in performing end us; what besides\n  Of sorrow and dejection and despair\n  Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,\n  Departure from this happy place, our sweet\n  Recess, and onely consolation left\n  Familiar to our eyes, all places else\n  Inhospitable appeer and desolate,\n  Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer\n  Incessant I could hope to change the will\n  Of him who all things can, I would not cease\n  To wearie him with my assiduous cries:\n  But prayer against his absolute Decree\n  No more availes then breath against the winde,\n  Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:\n  Therefore to his great bidding I submit.\n  This most afflicts me, that departing hence,\n  As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd\n  His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,\n  With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd\n  Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;\n  On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree\n  Stood visible, among these Pines his voice\n  I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:\n  So many grateful Altars I would reare\n  Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone\n  Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,\n  Or monument to Ages, and thereon\n  Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:\n  In yonder nether World where shall I seek\n  His bright appearances, or footstep trace?\n  For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd\n  To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now\n  Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts\n  Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL with regard benigne.\n  ADAM, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth\n  Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills\n  Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,\n  Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:\n  All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,\n  No despicable gift; surmise not then\n  His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd\n  Of Paradise or EDEN: this had been\n  Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred\n  All generations, and had hither come\n  From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate\n  And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.\n  But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down\n  To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:\n  Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine\n  God is as here, and will be found alike\n  Present, and of his presence many a signe\n  Still following thee, still compassing thee round\n  With goodness and paternal Love, his Face\n  Express, and of his steps the track Divine.\n  Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,\n  Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent\n  To shew thee what shall come in future dayes\n  To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad\n  Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending\n  With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn\n  True patience, and to temper joy with fear\n  And pious sorrow, equally enur'd\n  By moderation either state to beare,\n  Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead\n  Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure\n  Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend\n  This Hill; let EVE (for I have drencht her eyes)\n  Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,\n  As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.\n\n    To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.\n  Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path\n  Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,\n  However chast'ning, to the evil turne\n  My obvious breast, arming to overcom\n  By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,\n  If so I may attain.  So both ascend\n  In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill\n  Of Paradise the highest, from whose top\n  The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken\n  Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.\n  Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,\n  Whereon for different cause the Tempter set\n  Our second ADAM in the Wilderness,\n  To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.\n  His Eye might there command wherever stood\n  City of old or modern Fame, the Seat\n  Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls\n  Of CAMBALU, seat of CATHAIAN CAN\n  And SAMARCHAND by OXUS, TEMIRS Throne,\n  To PAQUIN of SINAEAN Kings, and thence\n  To AGRA and LAHOR of great MOGUL\n  Down to the golden CHERSONESE, or where\n  The PERSIAN in ECBATAN sate, or since\n  In HISPAHAN, or where the RUSSIAN KSAR\n  In MOSCO, or the Sultan in BIZANCE,\n  TURCHESTAN-born; nor could his eye not ken\n  Th' Empire of NEGUS to his utmost Port\n  ERCOCO and the less Maritine Kings\n  MOMBAZA, and QUILOA, and MELIND,\n  And SOFALA thought OPHIR, to the Realme\n  Of CONGO, and ANGOLA fardest South;\n  Or thence from NIGER Flood to ATLAS Mount\n  The Kingdoms of ALMANSOR, FEZ, and SUS,\n  MAROCCO and ALGIERS, and TREMISEN;\n  On EUROPE thence, and where ROME was to sway\n  The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw\n  Rich MEXICO the seat of MOTEZUME,\n  And CUSCO in PERU, the richer seat\n  Of ATABALIPA, and yet unspoil'd\n  GUIANA, whose great Citie GERYONS Sons\n  Call EL DORADO: but to nobler sights\n  MICHAEL from ADAMS eyes the Filme remov'd\n  VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight\n  Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue\n  The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;\n  And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd.\n  So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,\n  Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,\n  That ADAM now enforc't to close his eyes,\n  Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:\n  But him the gentle Angel by the hand\n  Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.\n\n    ADAM, now ope thine eyes, and first behold\n  Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought\n  In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd\n  Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,\n  Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive\n  Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.\n\n    His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,\n  Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves\n  New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;\n  Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood\n  Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon\n  A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought\n  First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,\n  Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next\n  More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock\n  Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid\n  The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,\n  On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.\n  His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n\n  Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;\n  The others not, for his was not sincere;\n  Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,\n  Smote him into the Midriff with a stone\n  That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale\n  Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.\n  Much at that sight was ADAM in his heart\n  Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.\n\n    O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n\n  To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;\n  Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?\n\n    T' whom MICHAEL thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.\n  These two are Brethren, ADAM, and to come\n  Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,\n  For envie that his Brothers Offering found\n  From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact\n  Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd\n  Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,\n  Rowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire.\n\n    Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!\n  But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way\n  I must return to native dust?  O sight\n  Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,\n  Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Death thou hast seen\n  In his first shape on man; but many shapes\n  Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead\n  To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\n  More terrible at th' entrance then within.\n  Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,\n  By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\n  In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring\n  Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\n  Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\n  What miserie th' inabstinence of EVE\n  Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place\n  Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\n  A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\n  Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies\n  Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\n  Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\n  Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\n  Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\n  Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.\n  Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\n  Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\n  And over them triumphant Death his Dart\n  Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't\n  With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\n  Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long\n  Drie-ey'd behold?  ADAM could not, but wept,\n  Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd\n  His best of Man, and gave him up to tears\n  A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\n  And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.\n\n    O miserable Mankind, to what fall\n  Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd?\n  Better end heer unborn.  Why is life giv'n\n  To be thus wrested from us? rather why\n  Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew\n  What we receive, would either not accept\n  Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,\n  Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus\n  Th' Image of God in man created once\n  So goodly and erect, though faultie since,\n  To such unsightly sufferings be debas't\n  Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,\n  Retaining still Divine similitude\n  In part, from such deformities be free,\n  And for his Makers Image sake exempt?\n\n    Thir Makers Image, answerd MICHAEL, then\n  Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd\n  To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took\n  His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,\n  Inductive mainly to the sin of EVE.\n  Therefore so abject is thir punishment,\n  Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,\n  Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't\n  While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules\n  To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they\n  Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.\n\n    I yeild it just, said ADAM, and submit.\n  But is there yet no other way, besides\n  These painful passages, how we may come\n  To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?\n\n    There is, said MICHAEL, if thou well observe\n  The rule of not too much, by temperance taught\n  In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence\n  Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\n  Till many years over thy head return:\n  So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop\n  Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease\n  Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:\n  This is old age; but then thou must outlive\n  Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change\n  To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then\n  Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,\n  To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth\n  Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne\n  A melancholly damp of cold and dry\n  To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume\n  The Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.\n\n    Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong\n  Life much, bent rather how I may be quit\n  Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,\n  Which I must keep till my appointed day\n  Of rendring up.  MICHAEL to him repli'd.\n\n    Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst\n  Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:\n  And now prepare thee for another sight.\n\n    He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon\n  Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds\n  Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound\n  Of Instruments that made melodious chime\n  Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd\n  Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch\n  Instinct through all proportions low and high\n  Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.\n  In other part stood one who at the Forge\n  Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass\n  Had melted (whether found where casual fire\n  Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,\n  Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot\n  To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream\n  From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind\n  Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd\n  First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought\n  Fulfil or grav'n in mettle.  After these,\n  But on the hether side a different sort\n  From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,\n  Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise\n  Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent\n  To worship God aright, and know his works\n  Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve\n  Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain\n  Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold\n  A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay\n  In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung\n  Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:\n  The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes\n  Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net\n  Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;\n  And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star\n  Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat\n  They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke\n  Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;\n  With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.\n  Such happy interview and fair event\n  Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,\n  And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart\n  Of ADAM, soon enclin'd to admit delight,\n  The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.\n\n    True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,\n  Much better seems this Vision, and more hope\n  Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;\n  Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,\n  Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Judg not what is best\n  By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\n  Created, as thou art, to nobler end\n  Holie and pure, conformitie divine.\n  Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\n  Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\n  Who slew his Brother; studious they appere\n  Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\n  Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\n  Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.\n  Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\n  For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\n  Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\n  Yet empty of all good wherein consists\n  Womans domestic honour and chief praise;\n  Bred onely and completed to the taste\n  Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,\n  To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\n  To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\n  Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,\n  Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame\n  Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles\n  Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\n  (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which\n  The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\n\n    To whom thus ADAM of short joy bereft.\n  O pittie and shame, that they who to live well\n  Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread\n  Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!\n  But still I see the tenor of Mans woe\n  Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.\n\n    From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,\n  Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place\n  By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.\n  But now prepare thee for another Scene.\n\n    He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred\n  Before him, Towns, and rural works between,\n  Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,\n  Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,\n  Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;\n  Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,\n  Single or in Array of Battel rang'd\n  Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;\n  One way a Band select from forage drives\n  A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine\n  From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,\n  Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,\n  Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,\n  But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;\n  With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;\n  Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies\n  With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field\n  Deserted: Others to a Citie strong\n  Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,\n  Assaulting; others from the Wall defend\n  With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;\n  On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.\n  In other part the scepter'd Haralds call\n  To Council in the Citie Gates: anon\n  Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,\n  Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon\n  In factious opposition, till at last\n  Of middle Age one rising, eminent\n  In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,\n  Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,\n  And Judgement from above: him old and young\n  Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,\n  Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence\n  Unseen amid the throng: so violence\n  Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law\n  Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.\n  ADAM was all in tears, and to his guide\n  Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,\n  Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death\n  Inhumanly to men, and multiply\n  Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew\n  His Brother; for of whom such massacher\n  Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?\n  But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n\n  Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product\n  Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st;\n  Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\n  Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\n  Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\n  Such were these Giants, men of high renown;\n  For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,\n  And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;\n  To overcome in Battel, and subdue\n  Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite\n  Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\n  Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done\n  Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,\n  Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\n  Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.\n  Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth,\n  And what most merits fame in silence hid.\n  But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\n  The onely righteous in a World perverse,\n  And therefore hated, therefore so beset\n  With Foes for daring single to be just,\n  And utter odious Truth, that God would come\n  To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\n  Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\n  Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\n  High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\n  Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\n  Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;\n  Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\n\n    He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd;\n  The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,\n  All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,\n  To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,\n  Marrying or prostituting, as befell,\n  Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire\n  Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.\n  At length a Reverend Sire among them came,\n  And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,\n  And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft\n  Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,\n  Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd\n  Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls\n  In prison under Judgements imminent:\n  But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd\n  Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;\n  Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,\n  Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,\n  Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,\n  Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore\n  Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large\n  For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!\n  Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small\n  Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught\n  Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons\n  With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.\n  Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings\n  Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove\n  From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie\n  Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,\n  Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie\n  Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain\n  Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth\n  No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum\n  Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow\n  Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else\n  Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp\n  Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,\n  Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces\n  Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd\n  And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,\n  All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.\n  How didst thou grieve then, ADAM, to behold\n  The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,\n  Depopulation; thee another Floud,\n  Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,\n  And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard\n  By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,\n  Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns\n  His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;\n  And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.\n\n    O Visions ill foreseen! better had I\n  Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne\n  My part of evil onely, each dayes lot\n  Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst\n  The burd'n of many Ages, on me light\n  At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth\n  Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,\n  With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek\n  Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall\n  Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,\n  Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,\n  And hee the future evil shall no less\n  In apprehension then in substance feel\n  Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,\n  Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't\n  Famin and anguish will at last consume\n  Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope\n  When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,\n  All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd\n  With length of happy days the race of man;\n  But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see\n  Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.\n  How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,\n  And whether here the Race of man will end.\n  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Those whom last thou sawst\n  In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they\n  First seen in acts of prowess eminent\n  And great exploits, but of true vertu void;\n  Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste\n  Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby\n  Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,\n  Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,\n  Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride\n  Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.\n  The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr\n  Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose\n  And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd\n  In sharp contest of Battel found no aide\n  Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale\n  Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,\n  Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords\n  Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear\n  More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:\n  So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,\n  Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;\n  One Man except, the onely Son of light\n  In a dark Age, against example good,\n  Against allurement, custom, and a World\n  Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,\n  Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes\n  Shall them admonish, and before them set\n  The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,\n  And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come\n  On thir impenitence; and shall returne\n  Of them derided, but of God observd\n  The one just Man alive; by his command\n  Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,\n  To save himself and houshold from amidst\n  A World devote to universal rack.\n  No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast\n  Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,\n  And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts\n  Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre\n  Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep\n  Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp\n  Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise\n  Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount\n  Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd\n  Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,\n  With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift\n  Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,\n  And there take root an Iland salt and bare,\n  The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.\n  To teach thee that God attributes to place\n  No sanctitie, if none be thither brought\n  By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.\n  And now what further shall ensue, behold.\n\n    He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,\n  Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,\n  Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie\n  Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;\n  And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass\n  Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,\n  As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink\n  From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole\n  With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt\n  His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.\n  The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground\n  Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.\n  And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;\n  With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive\n  Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.\n  Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,\n  And after him, the surer messenger,\n  A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie\n  Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;\n  The second time returning, in his Bill\n  An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:\n  Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke\n  The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;\n  Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,\n  Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds\n  A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow\n  Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,\n  Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.\n  Whereat the heart of ADAM erst so sad\n  Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.\n\n    O thou that future things canst represent\n  As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive\n  At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live\n  With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.\n  Farr less I now lament for one whole World\n  Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce\n  For one Man found so perfet and so just,\n  That God voutsafes to raise another World\n  From him, and all his anger to forget.\n  But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,\n  Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,\n  Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde\n  The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,\n  Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?\n\n    To whom th' Archangel.  Dextrously thou aim'st;\n  So willingly doth God remit his Ire,\n  Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,\n  Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw\n  The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh\n  Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,\n  Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,\n  That he relents, not to blot out mankind,\n  And makes a Covenant never to destroy\n  The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea\n  Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World\n  With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings\n  Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set\n  His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look\n  And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,\n  Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost\n  Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,\n  Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.\n  Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;\n  And Man as from a second stock proceed.\n  Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave\n  Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine\n  Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:\n  Henceforth what is to com I will relate,\n  Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.\n  This second sours of Men, while yet but few,\n  And while the dread of judgement past remains\n  Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,\n  With some regard to what is just and right\n  Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,\n  Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,\n  Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,\n  Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,\n  With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast\n  Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell\n  Long time in peace by Families and Tribes\n  Under paternal rule; till one shall rise\n  Of proud ambitious heart, who not content\n  With fair equalitie, fraternal state,\n  Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd\n  Over his brethren, and quite dispossess\n  Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;\n  Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)\n  With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse\n  Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:\n  A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd\n  Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,\n  Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;\n  And from Rebellion shall derive his name,\n  Though of Rebellion others he accuse.\n  Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns\n  With him or under him to tyrannize,\n  Marching from EDEN towards the West, shall finde\n  The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge\n  Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;\n  Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build\n  A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;\n  And get themselves a name, least far disperst\n  In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,\n  Regardless whether good or evil fame.\n  But God who oft descends to visit men\n  Unseen, and through thir habitations walks\n  To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,\n  Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower\n  Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets\n  Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase\n  Quite out thir Native Language, and instead\n  To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:\n  Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud\n  Among the Builders; each to other calls\n  Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,\n  As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n\n  And looking down, to see the hubbub strange\n  And hear the din; thus was the building left\n  Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd.\n\n    Whereto thus ADAM fatherly displeas'd.\n  O execrable Son so to aspire\n  Above his Brethren, to himself affirming\n  Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:\n  He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl\n  Dominion absolute; that right we hold\n  By his donation; but Man over men\n  He made not Lord; such title to himself\n  Reserving, human left from human free.\n  But this Usurper his encroachment proud\n  Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends\n  Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food\n  Will he convey up thither to sustain\n  Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire\n  Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,\n  And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Justly thou abhorr'st\n  That Son, who on the quiet state of men\n  Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue\n  Rational Libertie; yet know withall,\n  Since thy original lapse, true Libertie\n  Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells\n  Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:\n  Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,\n  Immediately inordinate desires\n  And upstart Passions catch the Government\n  From Reason, and to servitude reduce\n  Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits\n  Within himself unworthie Powers to reign\n  Over free Reason, God in Judgement just\n  Subjects him from without to violent Lords;\n  Who oft as undeservedly enthrall\n  His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\n  Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\n  Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low\n  From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\n  But Justice, and some fatal curse annext\n  Deprives them of thir outward libertie,\n  Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son\n  Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame\n  Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\n  SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race.\n  Thus will this latter, as the former World,\n  Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last\n  Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw\n  His presence from among them, and avert\n  His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\n  To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\n  And one peculiar Nation to select\n  From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,\n  A Nation from one faithful man to spring:\n  Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing,\n  Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men\n  (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\n  While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,\n  As to forsake the living God, and fall\n  To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\n  For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\n  To call by Vision from his Fathers house,\n  His kindred and false Gods, into a Land\n  Which he will shew him, and from him will raise\n  A mightie Nation, and upon him showre\n  His benediction so, that in his Seed\n  All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\n  Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\n  I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\n  He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\n  UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford\n  To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train\n  Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\n  Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\n  With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.\n  CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents\n  Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine\n  Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves\n  Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;\n  From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South\n  (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)\n  From HERMON East to the great Western Sea,\n  Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold\n  In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\n  Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream\n  JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\n  Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills.\n  This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\n  Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\n  Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\n  The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\n  Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,\n  Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call,\n  A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\n  Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\n  The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\n  From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call'd\n  EGYPT, divided by the River NILE;\n  See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\n  Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\n  He comes invited by a yonger Son\n  In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\n  Raise him to be the second in that Realme\n  Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race\n  Growing into a Nation, and now grown\n  Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks\n  To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests\n  Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\n  Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\n  Till by two brethren (those two brethren call\n  MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime\n  His people from enthralment, they return\n  With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.\n  But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\n  To know thir God, or message to regard,\n  Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\n  To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\n  Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\n  With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;\n  His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\n  Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\n  And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\n  Haile mixt with fire must rend th' EGYPTIAN Skie\n  And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;\n  What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\n  A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\n  Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\n  Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,\n  Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\n  Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born\n  Of EGYPT must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\n  This River-dragon tam'd at length submits\n  To let his sojourners depart, and oft\n  Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\n  More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage\n  Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\n  Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\n  As on drie land between two christal walls,\n  Aw'd by the rod of MOSES so to stand\n  Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:\n  Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\n  Though present in his Angel, who shall goe\n  Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\n  To guide them in thir journey, and remove\n  Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:\n  All night he will pursue, but his approach\n  Darkness defends between till morning Watch;\n  Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\n  God looking forth will trouble all his Host\n  And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\n  MOSES once more his potent Rod extends\n  Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\n  On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\n  And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\n  Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance\n  Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\n  Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd\n  Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\n  Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather\n  Inglorious life with servitude; for life\n  To noble and ignoble is more sweet\n  Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\n  This also shall they gain by thir delay\n  In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\n  Thir government, and thir great Senate choose\n  Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\n  God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top\n  Shall tremble, he descending, will himself\n  In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\n  Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\n  To civil Justice, part religious Rites\n  Of sacrifice, informing them, by types\n  And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\n  The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\n  Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God\n  To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\n  That MOSES might report to them his will,\n  And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\n  Instructed that to God is no access\n  Without Mediator, whose high Office now\n  MOSES in figure beares, to introduce\n  One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\n  And all the Prophets in thir Age the times\n  Of great MESSIAH shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites\n  Establisht, such delight hath God in Men\n  Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes\n  Among them to set up his Tabernacle,\n  The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\n  By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd\n  Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\n  An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\n  The Records of his Cov'nant, over these\n  A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\n  Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn\n  Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\n  The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\n  Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\n  Save when they journie, and at length they come,\n  Conducted by his Angel to the Land\n  Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest\n  Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,\n  How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\n  Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still\n  A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\n  Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand,\n  And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON,\n  Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third\n  From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him\n  His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win.\n\n    Here ADAM interpos'd.  O sent from Heav'n,\n  Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things\n  Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne\n  Just ABRAHAM and his Seed: now first I finde\n  Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,\n  Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom\n  Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see\n  His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,\n  Favour unmerited by me, who sought\n  Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.\n  This yet I apprehend not, why to those\n  Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth\n  So many and so various Laws are giv'n;\n  So many Laws argue so many sins\n  Among them; how can God with such reside?\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Doubt not but that sin\n  Will reign among them, as of thee begot;\n  And therefore was Law given them to evince\n  Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up\n  Sin against Law to fight; that when they see\n  Law can discover sin, but not remove,\n  Save by those shadowie expiations weak,\n  The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude\n  Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,\n  Just for unjust, that in such righteousness\n  To them by Faith imputed, they may finde\n  Justification towards God, and peace\n  Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies\n  Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part\n  Perform, and not performing cannot live.\n  So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n\n  With purpose to resign them in full time\n  Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd\n  From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,\n  From imposition of strict Laws, to free\n  Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear\n  To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.\n  And therefore shall not MOSES, though of God\n  Highly belov'd, being but the Minister\n  Of Law, his people into CANAAN lead;\n  But JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call,\n  His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell\n  The adversarie Serpent, and bring back\n  Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man\n  Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.\n  Meanwhile they in thir earthly CANAAN plac't\n  Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins\n  National interrupt thir public peace,\n  Provoking God to raise them enemies:\n  From whom as oft he saves them penitent\n  By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom\n  The second, both for pietie renownd\n  And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive\n  Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne\n  For ever shall endure; the like shall sing\n  All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock\n  Of DAVID (so I name this King) shall rise\n  A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,\n  Foretold to ABRAHAM, as in whom shall trust\n  All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings\n  The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.\n  But first a long succession must ensue,\n  And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,\n  The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents\n  Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.\n  Such follow him, as shall be registerd\n  Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,\n  Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults\n  Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense\n  God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,\n  Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark\n  With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey\n  To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st\n  Left in confusion, BABYLON thence call'd.\n  There in captivitie he lets them dwell\n  The space of seventie years, then brings them back,\n  Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn\n  To DAVID, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.\n  Returnd from BABYLON by leave of Kings\n  Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God\n  They first re-edifie, and for a while\n  In mean estate live moderate, till grown\n  In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;\n  But first among the Priests dissension springs,\n  Men who attend the Altar, and should most\n  Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings\n  Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise\n  The Scepter, and regard not DAVIDS Sons,\n  Then loose it to a stranger, that the true\n  Anointed King MESSIAH might be born\n  Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr\n  Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,\n  And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire\n  His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;\n  His place of birth a solemn Angel tells\n  To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;\n  They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire\n  Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.\n  A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire\n  The Power of the most High; he shall ascend\n  The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign\n  With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns.\n\n    He ceas'd, discerning ADAM with such joy\n  Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,\n  Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.\n\n    O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher\n  Of utmost hope! now clear I understand\n  What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,\n  Why our great expectation should be call'd\n  The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,\n  High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes\n  Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son\n  Of God most High; So God with man unites.\n  Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise\n  Expect with mortal paine: say where and when\n  Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.\n\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Dream not of thir fight,\n  As of a Duel, or the local wounds\n  Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son\n  Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil\n  Thy enemie; nor so is overcome\n  SATAN, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,\n  Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:\n  Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,\n  Not by destroying SATAN, but his works\n  In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,\n  But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,\n  Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd\n  On penaltie of death, and suffering death,\n  The penaltie to thy transgression due,\n  And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:\n  So onely can high Justice rest appaid.\n  The Law of God exact he shall fulfill\n  Both by obedience and by love, though love\n  Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment\n  He shall endure by coming in the Flesh\n  To a reproachful life and cursed death,\n  Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe\n  In his redemption, and that his obedience\n  Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits\n  To save them, not thir own, though legal works.\n  For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,\n  Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd\n  A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross\n  By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;\n  But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,\n  The Law that is against thee, and the sins\n  Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,\n  Never to hurt them more who rightly trust\n  In this his satisfaction; so he dies,\n  But soon revives, Death over him no power\n  Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light\n  Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise\n  Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,\n  Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,\n  His death for Man, as many as offerd Life\n  Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace\n  By Faith not void of works: this God-like act\n  Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,\n  In sin for ever lost from life; this act\n  Shall bruise the head of SATAN, crush his strength\n  Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,\n  And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings\n  Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,\n  Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,\n  A gentle wafting to immortal Life.\n  Nor after resurrection shall he stay\n  Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer\n  To his Disciples, Men who in his Life\n  Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge\n  To teach all nations what of him they learn'd\n  And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve\n  Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe\n  Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life\n  Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,\n  For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.\n  All Nations they shall teach; for from that day\n  Not onely to the Sons of ABRAHAMS Loines\n  Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons\n  Of ABRAHAMS Faith wherever through the world;\n  So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.\n  Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend\n  With victory, triumphing through the aire\n  Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise\n  The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines\n  Through all his realme, & there confounded leave;\n  Then enter into glory, and resume\n  His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high\n  Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,\n  When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,\n  With glory and power to judge both quick & dead,\n  To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward\n  His faithful, and receave them into bliss,\n  Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth\n  Shall all be Paradise, far happier place\n  Then this of EDEN, and far happier daies.\n\n    So spake th' Archangel MICHAEL, then paus'd,\n  As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire\n  Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd.\n\n    O goodness infinite, goodness immense!\n  That all this good of evil shall produce,\n  And evil turn to good; more wonderful\n  Then that which by creation first brought forth\n  Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,\n  Whether I should repent me now of sin\n  By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce\n  Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,\n  To God more glory, more good will to Men\n  From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.\n  But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n\n  Must reascend, what will betide the few\n  His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,\n  The enemies of truth; who then shall guide\n  His people, who defend? will they not deale\n  Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?\n\n    Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n\n  Hee to his own a Comforter will send,\n  The promise of the Father, who shall dwell\n  His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith\n  Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,\n  To guide them in all truth, and also arme\n  With spiritual Armour, able to resist\n  SATANS assaults, and quench his fierie darts\n  What Man can do against them, not affraid,\n  Though to the death, against such cruelties\n  With inward consolations recompenc't,\n  And oft supported so as shall amaze\n  Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit\n  Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends\n  To evangelize the Nations, then on all\n  Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue\n  To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,\n  As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win\n  Great numbers of each Nation to receave\n  With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length\n  Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,\n  Thir doctrine and thir story written left,\n  They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,\n  Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,\n  Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n\n  To thir own vile advantages shall turne\n  Of lucre and ambition, and the truth\n  With superstitions and traditions taint,\n  Left onely in those written Records pure,\n  Though not but by the Spirit understood.\n  Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,\n  Places and titles, and with these to joine\n  Secular power, though feigning still to act\n  By spiritual, to themselves appropriating\n  The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n\n  To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,\n  Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force\n  On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde\n  Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within\n  Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then\n  But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde\n  His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild\n  His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,\n  Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth\n  Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard\n  Infallible? yet many will presume:\n  Whence heavie persecution shall arise\n  On all who in the worship persevere\n  Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,\n  Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes\n  Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire\n  Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith\n  Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,\n  To good malignant, to bad men benigne,\n  Under her own waight groaning, till the day\n  Appeer of respiration to the just,\n  And vengeance to the wicked, at return\n  Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid,\n  The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,\n  Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,\n  Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald\n  In glory of the Father, to dissolve\n  SATAN with his perverted World, then raise\n  From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,\n  New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date\n  Founded in righteousness and peace and love,\n  To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.\n\n    He ended; and thus ADAM last reply'd.\n  How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,\n  Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,\n  Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,\n  Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.\n  Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,\n  Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill\n  Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;\n  Beyond which was my folly to aspire.\n  Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,\n  And love with feare the onely God, to walk\n  As in his presence, ever to observe\n  His providence, and on him sole depend,\n  Merciful over all his works, with good\n  Still overcoming evil, and by small\n  Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak\n  Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise\n  By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake\n  Is fortitude to highest victorie,\n  And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;\n  Taught this by his example whom I now\n  Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\n\n    To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:\n  This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe\n  Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs\n  Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,\n  All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,\n  Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea,\n  And all the riches of this World enjoydst,\n  And all the rule, one Empire; onely add\n  Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,\n  Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,\n  By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul\n  Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath\n  To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess\n  A Paradise within thee, happier farr.\n  Let us descend now therefore from this top\n  Of Speculation; for the hour precise\n  Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,\n  By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect\n  Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,\n  In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;\n  We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;\n  Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd\n  Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd\n  To meek submission: thou at season fit\n  Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,\n  Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,\n  The great deliverance by her Seed to come\n  (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.\n  That ye may live, which will be many dayes,\n  Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,\n  With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd\n  With meditation on the happie end.\n\n    He ended, and they both descend the Hill;\n  Descended, ADAM to the Bowre where EVE\n  Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;\n  And thus with words not sad she him receav'd.\n\n    Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;\n  For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,\n  Which he hath sent propitious, some great good\n  Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress\n  VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;\n  In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,\n  Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,\n  Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee\n  Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou,\n  VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.\n  This further consolation yet secure\n  I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,\n  Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,\n  By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore.\n\n    So spake our Mother EVE, and ADAM heard\n  VVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh\n  Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill\n  To thir fixt Station, all in bright array\n  The Cherubim descended; on the ground\n  Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist\n  Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,\n  And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel\n  Homeward returning.  High in Front advanc't,\n  The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd\n  Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,\n  And vapour as the LIBYAN Air adust,\n  Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat\n  In either hand the hastning Angel caught\n  Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate\n  Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast\n  To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd.\n  They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld\n  Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,\n  Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate\n  With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes:\n  Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon;\n  The World was all before them, where to choose\n  Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:\n  They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,\n  Through EDEN took thir solitarie way.\n\n\n\n\n  THE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Paradise Lost, by John Milton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARADISE LOST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 20.txt or 20.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/20\/\n\nProduced by Judy Boss\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":934,"split":"train"}
