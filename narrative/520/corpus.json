{"ori_id":"7a62a3ec3bf145c16d244dc44648220d13c05e50","title":"Ninety-Three","context":"Ninety-Three\n The year is 1793. In Brittany during the Royalist insurrection of the Chouannerie, a troop of \u201cBlues\u201d (soldiers of the French Republic) encounter in the bocage Michelle Fl\u00e9chard, a peasant woman, and her three young children, who are fleeing from the conflict. She explains that her husband and parents have been killed in the peasant revolt that started the insurrection. The troop\u2019s commander, Sergeant Radoub, convinces them to look after the family.\nMeanwhile, at sea, a group of Royalist \u201cWhites\u201d are planning to land the Marquis de Lantenac, a Breton aristocrat whose leadership could transform the fortunes of the rebellion. While at sea, a sailor fails to properly secure his cannon, which rolls out of control and damages the ship. The sailor risks his life to secure the cannon and save their ship. Lantenac awards the man a medal for his bravery and then executes him (without trial) for failing in his duty. Their corvette is spotted by ships of the Republic. Lantenac slips away in a boat with one supporter, and the corvette distracts the Republican ships by provoking a battle the damaged ship cannot win. The corvette is destroyed, but Lantenac lands safely in Brittany.\nLantenac is hunted by the Blues, but is protected by a local beggar, to whom he gave alms in the past. He meets up with his supporters, and they immediately launch an attack on the Blues. Part of the troop with the family is captured. Lantenac orders them all to be shot, including Michelle. He takes the children with him as hostages. The beggar finds the bodies, and discovers that Michelle is still alive. He nurses her back to health.\nLantenac\u2019s ruthless methods have turned the revolt into a major threat to the Republic. In Paris, Danton, Robespierre and Marat argue about the threat, while also sniping at each other. They promulgate a decree that all rebels and anyone who helps them will be executed. Cimourdain, a committed revolutionary and former priest, is deputed to carry out their orders in Brittany. He is also told to keep an eye on Gauvain, the commander of the Republican troops there, who is related to Lantenac and thought to be too lenient to rebels. Unknown to the revolutionary leaders, Cimourdain was Gauvain\u2019s childhood tutor, and thinks of him as a son.\nLantenac has taken control of Dol-de-Bretagne, in order to secure a landing place for British troops to be sent to support the Royalists. Gauvain launches a surprise attack and uses deception to dislodge and disperse them. Forced to retreat, Lantenac is constantly kept from the coast by Gauvain. With British troops unavailable his supporters melt away. Eventually he and a last few fanatical followers are trapped in his castle.\nMeanwhile Michelle has recovered and goes in search of her children. She wanders aimlessly, but eventually hears that they are being held hostage in Lantenac\u2019s castle. At the castle Sergeant Radoub, fighting with the besiegers, spots the children. He persuades Gauvain to let him lead an assault. He manages to break through the defences and kill several rebels, but Lantenac and a few survivors escape through a secret passage after setting fire to the building. As the fire takes hold, Michelle arrives, and sees that her children are trapped. Her hysterical cries of despair are heard by Lantenac. Struck with guilt, he returns through the passage to the castle and rescues the children, helped by Radoub. He then gives himself up.\nGauvain knows that Cimourdain will guillotine Lantenac after a show trial. He visits him in prison, where Lantenac expresses his uncompromising conservative vision of society ordered by hierarchy, deference and duty. Gauvain insists that humane values transcend tradition. To prove it, he allows Lantenac to escape and then gives himself up to the tribunal that was convened to try him. Gauvain's forgiveness after Lantenac's courageous act contrasts with Lantenac's executing the sailor at the beginning of the novel. Gauvain is then tried for treason. The tribunal comprises Cimourdain, Radoub and Gauvain\u2019s deputy, Gu\u00e9champ. Radoub votes to acquit, but the others vote to condemn Gauvain to be executed, with Cimourdain casting the deciding vote. Visited by Cimourdain in prison, Gauvain outlines his own vision of a future society with minimal government, no taxes, technological progress and sexual equality. The following morning he is executed by guillotine. At the same moment, Cimourdain shoots himself.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Ninety-Three, by Victor Hugo\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

Decimated by this cruel war, the\nbattalion was reduced to about three hundred men. This was at the time\nwhen, after Argonne, Jemmapes, and Valmy, of the first battalion of\nParis, which had numbered six hundred volunteers, only twenty-seven\nmen remained, thirty-three of the second, and fifty-seven of the\nthird,--a time of epic combats. The battalion sent from Paris into La\nVend\u00c3\u00a9e numbered nine hundred and twelve men. Each regiment had three\npieces of cannon. They had been quickly mustered. On the 25th of April,\nGohier being Minister of Justice, and Bouchotte Minister of War, the\nsection of Bon Conseil had offered to send volunteer battalions into\nLa Vend\u00c3\u00a9e; the report was made by Lubin, a member of the Commune. On\nthe 1st of May, Santerre was ready to send off twelve thousand men,\nthirty field-pieces, and one battalion of gunners. These battalions,\nnotwithstanding they were so quickly formed, serve as models even at\nthe present day, and regiments of the line are formed on the same plan;\nthey altered the former proportion between the number of soldiers and\nthat of non-commissioned officers.\n\nOn the 28th of April the Paris Commune had given to the volunteers of\nSanterre the following order: \"No mercy, no quarter.\" Of the twelve\nthousand that had left Paris, at the end of May eight thousand were\ndead. The battalion which was engaged in La Saudraie held itself on its\nguard. There was no hurrying: every man looked at once to right and to\nleft, before him, behind him. Kl\u00c3\u00a9ber has said: \"The soldier has an eye\nin his back.\" They had been marching a long time. What o'clock could it\nbe? What time of the day was it? It would have been hard to say; for\nthere is always a sort of dusk in these wild thickets, and it was never\nlight in that wood. The forest of La Saudraie was a tragic one. It was\nin this coppice that from the month of November, 1792, civil war began\nits crimes; Mousqueton, the fierce cripple, had come forth from those\nfatal thickets; the number of murders that had been committed there\nmade one's hair stand on end. No spot was more terrible.\n\nThe soldiers forced cautiously. Everything was in full bloom; they\nwere surrounded by a quivering wall of branches, whose leaves diffused\na delicious freshness. Here and there sunbeams pierced, these green\nshades. At their feet the gladiolus, the German iris, the wild\nnarcissus, the wood-daisy, that tiny flower, forerunner of the warm\nweather, the spring crocus,--all these embroidered and adorned a thick\ncarpet of vegetation, abounding in every variety of moss, from the kind\nthat looks like a caterpillar to that resembling a star.\n\nThe soldiers advanced silently, step by step, gently pushing aide the\nunderbrush. The birds twittered above the bayonets.\n\nLa Saudraie was one of those thickets where formerly, in time of peace,\nthey had pursued the Houicheba,--the the hunting of birds by night; now\nit was a place for hunting men.\n\nThe coppice consisted entirely of birch-trees, beeches, and oaks; the\nground was level; the moss and the thick grass deadened the noise of\nfootsteps; no paths at all, or paths no sooner found than lost; holly,\nwild sloe, brakes, hedges of rest-harrow, and tall brambles; it was\nimpossible to see a man ten paces distant.\n\nNow and then a heron or a moor-hen flew through the branches, showing\nthe vicinity of a swamp. They marched along at haphazard, uneasy, and\nfearing lest they might find what they sought.\n\nFrom time to time they encountered traces of encampments,--a burnt\nplace, trampled grass, sticks arranged in the form of a cross, or\nbranches spattered with blood. Here, soup had been made; there, Mass\nhad been said; yonder, wounds had been dressed. But whoever had passed\nthat way had vanished. Where were they? Far away, perhaps; and yet\nthey might be very near, hiding, blunderbuss in hand. The wood seemed\ndeserted. The battalion redoubled its precaution. Solitude, therefore\ndistrust. No one was to be seen; all the more reason to fear some one.\nThey had to do with a forest of ill-repute.\n\n[Illustration 005]\n\nAn ambush was probable.\n\nThirty grenadiers, detached as scouts and commanded by a sergeant,\nmarched ahead, at a considerable distance from the main body. The\nvivandi\u00c3\u00a8re of the battalion accompanied them. The vivandi\u00c3\u00a8res like to\njoin the vanguard; they run risks, but then they stand a chance of\nseeing something. Curiosity is one of the forms of feminine courage.\n\nSuddenly the soldiers of this little advanced guard received that shock\nfamiliar to hunters, which shows them that they are close upon the lair\nof their prey. They heard something like breathing in the middle of the\nthicket, and it seemed as if they caught sight of some commotion among\nthe leaves. The soldiers made signs to each other.\n\nWhen this mode of watching and reconnoitring is confided to the scouts,\nofficers have no need to interfere; what has to be done is done\ninstinctively.\n\nIn less than a minute the spot where the movement had been observed\nwas surrounded by a circle of levelled muskets, aimed simultaneously\nfrom every side at the dusky centre of the thicket; and the soldiers,\nwith finger on trigger and eye on the suspected spot, awaited only the\nsergeant's command to fire.\n\nMeanwhile, the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re ventured to peer through the underbush;\nand just as the sergeant was about to cry, \"Fire!\" this woman cried,\n\"Halt!\"\n\nAnd turning to the soldiers, \"Do not fire!\" she cried, and rushed into\nthe thicket, followed by the men.\n\nThere was indeed some one there.\n\nIn the thickest part of the copse on the edge of one of those small\ncircular clearings made in the woods by the charcoal-furnaces that\nare used to burn the roots of trees, in a sort of hole formed by\nthe branches,--a bower of foliage, so to speak, half-open, like an\nalcove,--sat a woman on the moss, with a nursing child at her breast\nand the fair heads of two sleeping children resting against her knees.\n\n[Illustration 006]\n\nThis was the ambush.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" called out the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\nThe woman raised her head, and the former added angrily,--\n\n\"Are you insane to remain there!\"\n\nShe went on,--\n\n\"A little more, and you would have been blown to atoms!\" Then\naddressing the soldiers, she said, \"It's a woman.\"\n\n\"Pardieu! That's plain to be seen,\" replied a grenadier.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re continued,--\"To come into the woods to get oneself\nmassacred. Can you conceive of any one so stupid as that?\"\n\nThe woman, surprised, bewildered, and stunned, was gazing around, as\nthough in a dream, at these muskets, sabres, bayonets, and savage\nfaces. The two children awoke and began to cry.\n\n\"I am hungry,\" said one.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said the other.\n\nThe baby went on nursing.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re addressed it.\n\n\"You are the wise one,\" she said.\n\nThe mother was dumb with terror.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" exclaimed the sergeant, \"we are the battalion of the\nBonnet Rouge.\"\n\nThe woman trembled from head to foot. She looked at the sergeant, of\nwhose rough face she could see only the eyebrows, moustache, and eyes\nlike two coals of fire.\n\n\"The battalion formerly known as the Red-Cross,\" added the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\nThe sergeant continued,--\n\n\"Who are you, madam?\"\n\nThe woman looked at him in terror. She was thin, young, pale, and\nin tatters. She wore the large hood and woollen cloak of the Breton\npeasants, fastened by a string around her neck. She left her bosom\nexposed with the indifference of an animal. Her feet, without shoes or\nstockings, were bleeding.\n\n\"It's a beggar,\" said the sergeant.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re continued in her martial yet womanly voice,--a gentle\nvoice withal,--\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\nThe woman stammered in a scarce audible whisper:\n\n\"Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard.\"\n\nMeanwhile the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re stroked the little head of the nursing baby\nwith her large hand.\n\n\"How old is this midget?\" she asked.\n\nThe mother did not understand. The vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re repeated,--\"I ask you how\nold it is?\"\n\n\"Oh, eighteen months,\" said the mother.\n\n\"That's quite old,\" said the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re; \"it ought not to nurse any\nlonger, you must wean it. We will give him soup.\"\n\nThe mother began to feel more at ease. The two little ones, who had\nawakened, were rather interested than frightened; they admired the\nplumes of the soldiers.\n\n\"Ah, they are very hungry!\" said the mother.\n\nAnd she added,--\n\n\"I have no more milk.\"\n\n\"We will give them food,\" cried the sergeant, \"and you also. But there\nis something more to be settled. What are your political opinions?\"\n\nThe woman looked at him and made no reply.\n\n\"Do you understand my question?\"\n\nShe stammered,--\n\n\"I was put into a convent when I was quite young, but I married; I am\nnot a nun. The Sisters taught me to speak French. The village was set\non fire. We escaped in such haste that I had no time to put my shoes\non.\"\n\n\"I ask you what are your political opinions?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that.\"\n\nThe sergeant continued,--\n\n\"There are female spies. That kind of person we shoot. Come, speak. You\nare not a gypsy, are you? What is your native land?\"\n\nShe still looked at him as though unable to comprehend.\n\nThe sergeant repeated,--\n\n\"What is your native land?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said.\n\n\"How is that? You do not know your country?\"\n\n\"Ah! Do you mean my country? I know that.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your country?\"\n\nThe woman replied,--\n\n\"It is the farm of Siscoignard, in the parish of Az\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nIt was the sergeant's turn to be surprised. He paused for a moment,\nlost in thought; then he went on,--\n\n\"What was it you said?\"\n\n\"Siscoignard.\"\n\n\"You cannot call that your native land.\"\n\n\"That is my country.\"\n\nThen after a minute's consideration she added,--\n\n\"I understand you, sir. You are from France, but I am from Brittany.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It is not the same country.\"\n\n\"But it is the same native land,\" exclaimed the sergeant.\n\nThe woman only replied,--\n\n\"I am from Siscoignard.\"\n\n\"Let it be. Siscoignard, then,\" said the sergeant. \"Your family belong\nthere, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"What is their business?\"\n\n\"They are all dead. I have no one left.\"\n\nThe sergeant, who was quite loquacious, continued to question her.\n\n\"Devil take it, every one has relations, or one has had them! Who are\nyou? Speak!\"\n\nThe woman listened bewildered; this \"or one has had them\" sounded more\nlike the cry of a wild beast than the speech of a human being.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re felt obliged to interfere. She began to caress the\nnursing child, and patted the other two on the cheeks.\n\n\"What is the baby's name? It's a little girl, isn't it?\"\n\nThe mother replied, \"Georgette.\"\n\n\"And the oldest one? For he is a man, the rogue!\"\n\n\"Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\"\n\n\"And the younger one? For he is a man too, and a chubby one into the\nbargain.\"\n\n\"Gros-Alain,\" replied the mother.\n\n\"They are pretty children,\" said the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re. \"They look already as\nif they were somebody.\"\n\nMeanwhile the sergeant persisted.\n\n\"Come! Speak, madam! Have you a house?\"\n\n\"I had one once.\"\n\n\"Where was it?\"\n\n\"At Az\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Why are you not at home?\"\n\n\"Because my house was burned.\"\n\n\"Who burned it?\"\n\n\"I do not know. There was a battle.\"\n\n\"Were do you come from?\"\n\n\"From over there.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Come, to the point! Who are you?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Don't know who you are?\"\n\n\"We are people running away.\"\n\n\"To what party do you belong?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"To the Blues, or the Whites? Which side are you on?\"\n\n\"I am with my children.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re spoke.\n\n\"For my part I never had any children. I have not had time.\"\n\nThe sergeant began again.\n\n\"But what about your parents? See here, madam, tell me the facts about\nyour parents. Now, my name is Radoub. I am a sergeant. I live on the\nRue Cherche-Midi. My father and my mother lived there. I can talk of my\nparents. Tell us about yours. Tell us who your parents were.\"\n\n\"Their name was Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard. That's all.\"\n\n\"Yes. The Fl\u00c3\u00a9chards are the Fl\u00c3\u00a9chards, just as the Radoubs are the\nRadoubs. But people have a trade. What was your parents' trade? What\ndid they do, these Fl\u00c3\u00a9chards of yours?\"[1]\n\n\"They were laborers. My father was feeble and could not work, on\naccount of a beating which the lord, his lord, our lord, gave him: it\nwas really a mercy, for my father had poached a rabbit, a crime of\nwhich the penalty is death; but the lord was merciful and said, 'You\nmay give him only a hundred blows with a stick;' and my father was\nleft a cripple.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"My grandfather was a Huguenot. The cur\u00c3\u00a9 had him sent to the galleys. I\nwas very young then.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"My husband's father was a salt smuggler. The king had him hung.\"\n\n\"And what did your husband do?\"\n\n\"He used to fight in those times.\"\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"For the king.\"\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\n\"Ah! For his lord.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"For the cur\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"By all the names of beasts!\" cried the grenadier. The woman jumped in\nterror.\n\n\"You see, madam, we are Parisians,\" said the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re, affably.\n\nThe woman clasped her hands, exclaiming,--\n\n\"Oh, my God and Lord Jesus!\"\n\n\"No superstitions here!\" rejoined the sergeant.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re sat down beside the woman and drew the oldest child\nbetween her knees; he yielded readily. Children are quite as easily\nreassured as they are frightened, with no apparent reason. They seem\nto possess instinctive perceptions. \"My poor worthy woman of this\nneighborhood, you have pretty little children, at all events. One can\nguess their age. The big one is four years, and his brother is three.\nJust see how greedily the little rascal sucks. The wretch! Stop eating\nup your mother! Come madam, do not be frightened. You ought to join the\nbattalion. You should do as I do. My name is Housarde. It's a nickname,\nbut I had rather be called Housarde than Mamzelle Bicorneau, like my\nmother. I am the canteen woman, which is the same as saying, she who\ngives the men to drink when they are firing grape-shot and killing each\nother. The devil and all his train. Our feet are about the same size. I\nwill give you a pair of my shoes. I was in Paris on the 10th of August.\nI gave Westerman a drink. Everything went with a rush in those days! I\nsaw Louis XVI. guillotined,--Louis Capet, as they call him. I tell you\nhe didn't like it. You just listen now. To think that on the 13th of\nJanuary he was roasting chestnuts and enjoying himself with his family!\nWhen he was made to lie down on what is called the see-saw, he wore\nneither coat nor shoes; only a shirt, a quilted waistcoat, gray cloth\nbreeches, and gray silk stockings. I saw all that with my own eyes.\nThe fiacre which he rode in was painted green. Now then, you come with\nus; they are kind lads in the battalion; you will be canteen number\ntwo; I will teach you the trade. Oh, it's very simple! You will have\na can and a bell; you are right in the racket, amid the firing of the\nplatoons and the cannons, in all that hubbub, calling out, 'Who wants\na drink, my children?' It is no harder task than that. I offer a drink\nto all, you may take my word for it,--to the Whites as well as to the\nBlues, although I am a Blue, and a true Blue at that. But I serve them\nall alike. Wounded men are thirsty. People die without difference of\nopinions. Dying men ought to shake hands. How foolish to fight! Come\nwith us. If I am killed you will fill my place. You see I am not much\nto look at, but I am a kind woman, and a good fellow. Don't be afraid.\"\n\nWhen the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re ceased speaking, the woman muttered to herself,--\n\n\"Our neighbor's name was Marie-Jeanne, and it was our servant who was\nMarie-Claude.\"\n\nMeanwhile Sergeant Radoub was reprimanding the grenadier.\n\n\"Silence! You frighten madam. A man should not swear before ladies.\"\n\n\"I say this is a downright butchery for an honest man to hear\nabout,\" replied the grenadier; \"and to see Chinese Iroquois, whose\nfather-in-law was crippled by the lord, whose grandfather was sent to\nthe galleys by the cur\u00c3\u00a9, and whose father was hung by the king, and who\nfight,--zounds!--and who get entangled in revolts, and are crushed for\nthe sake of the lord, the cur\u00c3\u00a9, and the king!\"\n\n\"Silence in the ranks!\" exclaimed the sergeant.\n\n\"One may be silent, sergeant,\" continued the grenadier; \"but it is all\nthe same provoking to see a pretty woman like that running the risk of\ngetting her neck broken for the sake of a calotin.\"[2]\n\n\"Grenadier,\" said the sergeant, \"we are not in the Pike Club. Save your\neloquence!\" And turning to the woman, \"And your husband, madam? What\ndoes he do? What has become of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing; since he was killed.\"\n\n\"Where was that?\"\n\n\"In the hedge.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Three days ago.\"\n\n\"Who killed him?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"How is that? You don't know who killed your husband?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Was it a Blue, or a White?\"\n\n\"It was a bullet.\"\n\n\"Was that three days ago?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In what direction?\"\n\n\"Towards Ern\u00c3\u00a9e. My husband fell. That was all.\"\n\n\"And since your husband died, what have you been doing?\"\n\n\"I have been taking my little ones along.\"\n\n\"Where are you taking them?\"\n\n\"Straight along.\"\n\n\"Where do you sleep?\"\n\n\"On the ground.\"\n\n\"What do you eat?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThe sergeant made that military grimace which elevates the moustache to\nthe nose. \"Nothing?\"\n\n\"Well, nothing but sloes, blackberries when I found any left over from\nlast year, whortle-berries, and fern-shoots.\"\n\n\"Yes, you may well call it nothing.\"\n\nThe oldest child, who seemed to understand, said:\n\n\"I am hungry.\"\n\nThe sergeant pulled from his pocket a piece of ration bread, and handed\nit to the mother.\n\nTaking the bread, she broke, it in two and gave it to the children, who\nbit into it greedily.\n\n\"She has not saved any for herself,\" growled the sergeant.\n\n\"Because she is not hungry,\" remarked a soldier.\n\n\"Because she is a mother,\" said the sergeant.\n\nThe children broke in.\n\n\"Give me something to drink,\" said one.\n\n\"To drink,\" repeated the other.\n\n\"Is there no brook in this cursed wood?\" said the sergeant.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re took the copper goblet suspended at her belt together\nwith a bell, turned the cock of the can that was strapped across her\nshoulder, and pouring several drops into the goblet, held it to the\nchildren's lips.\n\nThe first drank and made a grimace.\n\nThe second drank and spit it out\n\n\"It is good, all the same,\" said the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\n\"Is that some of the old cut-throat?\" asked the sergeant.\n\n\"Yes, some of the best. But they are peasants.\"\n\nShe wiped the goblet.\n\n\"And so, madam, you are running away?\" resumed the sergeant.\n\n\"I couldn't help it.\"\n\n\"Across the fields? With no particular object?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I run with all my might, and then I walk, and once in a\nwhile I fall.\"\n\n\"Poor countrywoman!\" said the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\n\"They were fighting,\" stammered the woman. \"I was in the middle of the\nfiring. I don't know what they want. They killed my husband,--that was\nall I know about it.\"\n\nThe sergeant banged the butt of his musket on the ground, exclaiming,--\n\n\"What a beast of a war! In the name of all that is idiotic!\"\n\nThe woman continued,---\n\n\"Last night we went to bed in an _\u00c3\u00a9mousse._\"\n\n\"All four of you?\"\n\n\"All four.\"\n\n\"Went to bed?\"\n\n\"Went to bed.\"\n\n\"Then you must have gone to bed standing.\" And he turned to the\nsoldiers.\n\n\"Comrades, a dead tree, old and hollow, wherein a man can sheathe\nhimself like a sword in a scabbard, is what these savages call\nan _\u00c3\u00a9mousse._ But what would you have? All are not obliged to be\nParisians.\"\n\n\"The idea of sleeping in the hollow of a tree,--and with three\nchildren!\" exclaimed the vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\n\"And when the little one bawled, it must have seemed queer to the\npassers-by, who could see nothing, to hear the tree calling out, 'Papa!\nmamma!'\"\n\n\"Fortunately, it is summer-time,\" said the woman, with a sigh.\n\nShe looked down resigned, with an expression in her eyes of one who had\nknown surprising calamities.\n\nThe silent soldiers surrounded this wretched group. A widow, three\norphans, flight, desolation, solitude, the rumblings of war on the\nhorizon, hunger, thirst, no food but herbs, no roof but the sky.\n\nThe sergeant drew near the woman and gazed upon the nursing infant. The\nbaby left the breast, turned her head, and looked with her lovely blue\neyes on the dreadful hairy face, bristling and fierce, that was bending\nover her, and began to smile.\n\nThe sergeant drew back, and a large tear was seen to roll down his\ncheek, clinging to the end of his moustache like a pearl.\n\nHe raised his voice.\n\n\"Comrades, I have come to the conclusion that this battalion is about\nto become a father. Are you willing? We adopt these three children.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the Republic!\" shouted the grenadiers.\n\n\"So be it!\" exclaimed the sergeant; and he stretched out both hands\nover the mother and the children.\n\n\"Behold the children of the battalion of the Bonnet-Rouge!\" he said.\n\nThe vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re jumped for joy.\n\n\"Three heads under one cap!\" she cried.\n\nThen she burst out sobbing, and embraced the widow excitedly, saying,--\n\n\"She looks like a rogue already, that little girl!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the Republic!\" repeated the soldiers.\n\n\"Come, citizeness,\" said the sergeant to the mother.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: The sergeant makes a pun on the name Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard which is\nuntranslatable.

In Jersey, one evening on the first of June,\nabout an hour before sunset, from the lovely little Bay of Bonnenuit,\na corvette set sail in that foggy kind of weather dangerous for\nnavigation, and for that very reason better suited for escape than for\npursuit. The ship, although it was manned by a French crew, belonged\nto the English squadron which had been stationed to watch the eastern\npoint of the island. The prince of Tour d'Auvergne, of the house of\nBouillon, commanded the English fleet, and it was by his order, and for\na special and pressing service, that the corvette had been detached.\n\nThis corvette entered at the Trinity House under the name of the\n\"Claymore,\" and, apparently a freight vessel, was in point of fact a\nman-of-war. She looked like a heavy and peaceable merchant-ship; but\nit would not have been wise to trust to that, for she had been built\nto serve two purposes,--cunning and strength; to deceive if possible,\nto fight if necessary. For the service on hand that night the freight\nbetween decks had been replaced by thirty carronades of heavy caliber.\nEither for the sake of giving the ship a peaceable appearance, or\npossibly because a storm was anticipated, these thirty carronades were\nhoused; that is, they were firmly fastened inside by triple chains,\nwith their muzzles tightly braced against the port-holes. Nothing could\nbe seen from the outside. The port-holes were closed. It was as though\nthe corvette wore a mask. These guns were mounted on old-fashioned\nbronzed wheels, called the \"radiating model.\" The regular naval\ncorvettes carry their guns on the upper deck; but this ship, built\nfor surprise and ambush, had its decks clear, having been arranged,\nas we have just seen, to carry a masked battery between decks.\nThe \"Claymore,\" although built in a heavy and clumsy fashion, was\nnevertheless a good sailer, her hull being one of the strongest in the\nEnglish Navy; and in an engagement she was almost equal to a frigate,\nalthough her mizzen-mast was only a small one, with a fore and aft\nrig. Her rudder, of an odd and scientific shape, had a curved frame,\nquite unique, which had cost fifty pounds sterling in the Southampton\nshipyards. The crew, entirely French, was composed of refugee officers\nand sailors who were deserters. They were experienced men; there was\nnot one among them who was not a good sailor, a good soldier, and a\ngood royalist. A threefold fanaticism possessed them,--for the ship,\nthe sword, and the king.\n\nHalf a battalion of marines, which could in case of necessity be\ndisembarked, was added to the crew.\n\nThe captain of the \"Claymore\" was a chevalier of Saint-Louis, Count\nBoisberthelot, one of the best officers of the old Royal Navy; the\nfirst officer was the Chevalier de la Vieuville, who had commanded in\nthe French Guards the company of which Hoche was sergeant; and the\npilot, Philip Gacquoil, was one of the most experienced in Jersey.\n\nIt was easy to guess that the ship had some unusual work to do.\nIn fact, a man had just stepped on board, who had the look of one\nstarting out for an adventure. He was an old man, tall, upright, and\nstrong, with a severe countenance,--a man whose age it would have been\ndifficult to determine, for he seemed both young and old, advanced\nin years yet abounding in vigor; one of those men whose eyes flash\nlightning though the hair is white. Judging from his energy, he was\nabout forty years old; his air of authority was that of a man of eighty.\n\nAt the moment when he stepped on board the corvette, his sea-cloak\nwas half-open, revealing beneath wide breeches called _bragoubras_,\nhigh boots, and a goat-skin waistcoat embroidered with silk on the\nright side, while the rough and bristling fur was left on the wrong\nside,--the complete costume of a Breton peasant. These old-fashioned\nBreton waist-coats answered two purposes, being worn both on holidays\nand week-days, and could be reversed at the option of the wearer,\nwith either the hairy or the smooth side out,--fur on a week-day, and\ngala attire for holidays. And as if to increase a carefully studied\nresemblance, the peasant dress worn by the old man was well worn on the\nknees and elbows, showing signs of long usage, and his cloak, made of\ncoarse cloth, looked like the garb of a fisherman. He wore the round\nhat of the period, tall and broad-brimmed, which when turned down looks\ncountrified, but when caught up on one side by a loop and a cockade has\nquite a military effect. He wore it turned down, country fashion, with\nneither loop nor cockade.\n\nLord Balcarras, the governor of the island, and the Prince de La Tour\nd'Auvergne had in person escorted him on board. The secret agent of\nthe Prince G\u00c3\u00a9lambre, an old body-guard of the Count d'Artois, himself\na nobleman, had personally superintended the arrangement of his cabin,\nshowing his attention and courtesy even so far as to carry the old\nman's valise. When about to leave him, to return to the land, M. de\nG\u00c3\u00a9lambre had made a deep bow to this peasant; Lord Balcarras exclaimed,\n\"Good luck to you, general;\" and the Prince de La Tour d'Auvergne said,\n\"Au revoir, cousin.\"\n\n\"The peasant\" was the name by which the sailors at once called their\npassenger in the short dialogues which sailors hold among themselves;\nyet, without further information on the subject, they understood that\nthis peasant was no more a genuine peasant than the man-of-war was a\nmerchantman.\n\nThere was scarcely any wind. The \"Claymore\" left Bonnenuit, passed\nBoulay Bay, remaining for some time in sight, tacking, gradually\ndiminishing in the gathering darkness, and finally disappeared.\n\nAll hour later, G\u00c3\u00a9lambre, having returned home to Saint-H\u00c3\u00a9lier, sent\nto the Count d'Artois, at the headquarters of the Duke of York, by the\nSouthampton express, the following lines:--\n\n\"MY LORD,--The departure has just taken place. Success is certain. In\neight days the whole coast, from Granville to St. Malo, will be ablaze.\"\n\nFour days previously the representative of the Marne, Prieur, on a\nmission to the army on the coast of Cherbourg, and just then stopping\nat Granville, received by a secret emissary the following message, in\nthe same handwriting as the previous one:--\n\n\"CITIZEN REPRESENTATIVE,--The 1st of June, at high tide, the war\ncorvette 'Claymore,' with a masked battery, will set sail, to land on\nthe coast of France a man who answers to the following description:\nTall, aged, gray-haired, dressed like a peasant, and with the hands of\nan aristocrat. To-morrow I will send you further details. He will land\non the morning of the 2d. Communicate this to the cruiser, capture the\ncorvette, guillotine the man.\"\n\n\n[Illustration 008b]\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nNIGHT WITH THE SHIP AND THE PASSENGER.\n\n\n[Illustration 009]\n\n\nThe corvette, instead of sailing south, in the direction of St.\nCatherine, headed to the north, then, veering towards the west, had\nboldly entered that arm of the sea between Sark and Jersey called the\nPassage of the D\u00c3\u00a9route. There was then no lighthouse, at any point\non either coast. It had been a clear sunset: the night was darker\nthan summer nights usually are; it was moonlight, but large clouds,\nrather of the equinox than of the solstice, overspread the sky, and,\njudging by appearances the moon would not be visible until she reached\nthe horizon at the moment of setting. A few clouds hung low near the\nsurface of the sea and covered it with vapor.\n\nAll this darkness was favorable. Gacquoil, the pilot, intended to\nleave Jersey on the left, Guernsey on the right, and by boldly sailing\nbetween Hanois and Dover, to reach some bay on the coast near St. Malo,\na longer but safer route than the one through Minquiers; for the French\ncoaster had standing orders to keep an unusually sharp lookout between\nSt. H\u00c3\u00a9lier and Granville.\n\nIf the wind were favorable, and nothing happened, by dint of setting\nall sail Gacquoil hoped to reach the coast of France at daybreak.\n\nAll went well. The corvette had just passed Gros Nez. Towards nine\no'clock the weather looked sullen, as the sailors express it, both wind\nand sea rising; but the wind was favorable, and the sea was rough, yet\nnot heavy, waves now and then dashing over the bow of the corvette.\n\"The peasant,\" whom Lord Balcarras had called general, and whom the\nPrince de La Tour d'Auvergne had addressed as cousin, was a good\nsailor, and paced the deck of the corvette with calm dignity. He did\nnot seem to notice that she rocked considerably. From time to time he\ntook out of his waistcoat pocket a cake of chocolate, and breaking off\na piece, munched it. Though his hair was gray, his teeth were sound.\n\nHe spoke to no one, except that from time to time he made a few\nconcise remarks in an undertone to the captain, who listened to him\ndeferentially, apparently regarding his passenger as the commander,\nrather than himself. Unobserved in the fog, and skilfully piloted,\nthe \"Claymore\" coasted along the steep shore to the north of Jersey,\nhugging the land to avoid the formidable reef of Pierres-de-Leeq, which\nlies in the middle of the strait between Jersey and Sark. Gacquoil, at\nthe helm, sighting in turn Grove de Leeq, Gros Nez, and Pl\u00c3\u00a9mont, making\nthe corvette glide in among those chains of reefs, felt his way along\nto a certain extent, but with the self-confidence of one familiar with\nthe ways of the sea.\n\nThe corvette had no light forward, fearing to betray its passage\nthrough these guarded waters. They congratulated themselves on the fog.\nThe Grande \u00c3\u0089tape was reached; the mist was so dense that the lofty\noutlines of the Pinnacle were scarcely visible. They heard it strike\nten from the belfry of Saint-Ouen,--a sign that the wind was still aft.\nAll was going well; the sea grew rougher, because they were drawing\nnear La Corbi\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\nA little after ten, the Count Boisberthelot and the Chevalier de la\nVieuville escorted the man in the peasant garb to the door of his\ncabin, which was the captain's own room. As he was about to enter, he\nremarked, lowering his voice:--\n\n\"You understand the importance of keeping the secret, gentlemen.\nSilence up to the moment of explosion. You are the only ones here who\nknow my name.\"\n\n\"We will carry it to the grave,\" replied Boisberthelot.\n\n\"And for my part, I would not reveal it were I face to face with\ndeath,\" remarked the old man.\n\nAnd he entered his state-room.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nPATRICIAN AND PLEBEIAN UNITED.\n\n\nThe commander and the first officer returned on deck, and began to\npace up and down side by side, talking as they walked. The theme\nwas evidently their passenger; and this was the substance of the\nconversation which the wind wafted through the darkness. Boisberthelot\ngrumbled half audibly to La Vieuville,--\n\n\"It remains to be seen whether or no he is a leader.\"\n\nLa Vieuville replied,--\n\n\"Meanwhile he is a prince.\"\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\n\"A nobleman in France, but a prince in Brittany.\"\n\n\"Like the Tr\u00c3\u00a9moilles and the Rohans.\"\n\n\"With whom he is connected.\"\n\nBoisberthelot resumed,--\n\n\"In France and in the carriages of the king he is a marquis,--as I am a\ncount, and you a chevalier.\"\n\n\"The carriages are far away!\" exclaimed Vieuville. \"We are living in\nthe time of the tumbril.\"\n\nA silence ensued.\n\nBoisberthelot went on,--\n\n\"For lack of a French prince we take one from Brittany.\"\n\n\"For lack of thrushes--No: since an eagle is not to be found, we take a\ncrow.\"\n\n\"I should prefer a vulture,\" remarked Boisberthelot.\n\nLa Vieuville replied,---\n\n\"Yes, indeed, with a beak and talons.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Vieuville, \"it is time there was a leader. I agree\nwith Tint\u00c3\u00a9niac,--a leader and gun-power! See here, commander, I know\nnearly all the possible and impossible leaders,--those of yesterday,\nthose of to-day, and those of to-morrow. Not one of them has the head\nrequired for war. In this cursed Vend\u00c3\u00a9e a general is needed who would\nbe a lawyer as well as a leader. He must harass the enemy, dispute\nevery bush, ditch, and stone; he must force unlucky quarrels upon him,\nand take advantage of everything; vigilant and pitiless, he must watch\nincessantly, slaughter freely, and make examples. Now, in this army of\npeasants there are heroes, but no captains. D'Elb\u00c3\u00a9e is a nonentity,\nLescure an invalid; Bonchamps is merciful,--he is kind, and that\nimplies folly; La Rochejaquelein is a superb sub-lieutenant; Silz\nis an officer good for the open field, but not suited for a war that\nneeds a man of expedients; Cathelineau is a simple teamster; Stofflet\nis a crafty game-keeper; B\u00c3\u00a9rard is inefficient; Boulainvilliers is\nabsurd; Charette is horrible. I make no mention of Gaston the barber.\nMordemonbleu! what is the use of opposing revolution, and what is the\ndifference between ourselves and the republicans, if we set barbers\nover the heads of noblemen! The fact is, that this beastly revolution\nhas contaminated all of us.\"\n\n\"It is the itch of France.\"\n\n\"It is the itch of the Tiers \u00c3\u0089tat,\" rejoined Boisberthelot. \"England\nalone can help us.\"\n\n\"And she will, captain, undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile it is an ugly state of affairs.\"\n\n\"Yes,--rustics everywhere. A monarchy that has Stofflet, the\ngame-keeper of M. de Maulevrier, for a commander has no reason to envy\na republic whose minister is Pache, the son of the Duke de Castries'\nporter. What men this Vendean war brings face to face,--.on one side\nSanterre the brewer; on the other Gaston the hairdresser!\"\n\n\"My dear La Vieuville, I feel some respect for this Gaston. He behaved\nwell in his command of Gu\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9e. He had three hundred Blues neatly shot\nafter making them dig their own graves.\"\n\n\"Well enough done; but I could have done quite as well as he.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, to be sure; and I too.\"\n\n\"The great feats of war,\" said Vieuville, \"require noble blood in\nthose who perform them. These are matters for knights, and not for\nhairdressers.\"\n\n\"But yet there are estimable men in this 'Third Estate,'\" rejoined\nVieuville. \"Take that watchmaker, Joly, for instance. He was formerly\na sergeant in a Flanders regiment; he becomes a Vendean chief and\ncommander of a coast band. He has a son, a republican; and while the\nfather serves in the ranks of the Whites, the son serves in those of\nthe Blues. An encounter, a battle: the father captures the son and\nblows out his brains.\"\n\n[Illustration 010]\n\n\"He did well,\" said La Vieuville.\n\n\"A royalist Brutus,\" answered Boisberthelot. \"Nevertheless, it is\nunendurable to be under the command of a Coquereau, a Jean-Jean, a\nMoulin, a Focart, a Bouju, a Chouppes!\"\n\n\"My dear chevalier, the opposite party is quite as indignant. We are\ncrowded with plebeians; they have an excess of nobles. Do you think\nthe sans-culottes like to be commanded by the Count de Canclaux, the\nViscount de Miranda, the Viscount de Beauharnais, the Count de Valence,\nthe Marquis de Custine, and the Duke de Biron?\"\n\n\"What a combination!\"\n\n\"And the Duke de Chartres!\"\n\n\"Son of \u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9. By the way, when will he be king?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"He aspires to the throne, and his very crimes serve to promote his\ninterests.\"\n\n\"And his vices will injure his cause,\" said Boisberthelot.\n\nThen, after another pause, he continued,--\n\n\"Nevertheless, he was anxious to be reconciled. He came to see the\nking. I was at Versailles when some one spit on his back.\"\n\n\"From the top of the grand staircase?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it.\"\n\n\"We called him Bourbon le Bourbeux.\"\n\n\"He is bald-headed; he has pimples; he is a regicide. Poh!\"\n\nAnd La Vieuville added:--\n\n\"I was with him at Ouessant.\"\n\n\"On the 'Saint Esprit'?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Had he obeyed Admiral d'Orvillier's signal to keep to the windward, he\nwould have prevented the English from passing.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"Was he really hidden in the bottom of the hold?\"\n\n\"No; but we must say so all the same.\"\n\nAnd La Vieuville burst out laughing.\n\nBoisberthelot continued:--\n\n\"Fools are plentiful. Look here, I have known this Boulainvilliers of\nwhom you were speaking; I knew him well. At first the peasants were\narmed with pikes; would you believe it, he took it into his head to\nform them into pike-men. He wanted to drill them in crossing pikes\nand repelling a charge. He dreamed of transforming these barbarians\ninto regular soldiers. He undertook to teach them how to round in the\ncorners of their squares, and to mass battalions with hollow squares.\nHe jabbered the antiquated military dialect to them; he called the\nchief of a squad a 'cap d'escade'--which was what corporals under\nLouis XIV. were called. He persisted in forming a regiment of all\nthose poachers. He had regular companies whose sergeants ranged\nthemselves in a circle every evening, and, receiving the sign and\ncountersign from the colonel's sergeant, repeated it in a whisper to\nthe lieutenant's sergeant, who repeated it to his next neighbor, who\nin his turn transmitted it to the next man, and so on from ear to ear\nuntil it reached the last man. He cashiered an officer for not standing\nbareheaded to receive the watchword from the sergeant. You may imagine\nhow he succeeded. This simpleton could not understand that peasants\nhave to be led peasant fashion, and that it is impossible to transform\nrustics into soldiers. Yes, I have known Boulainvilliers.\"\n\nThey walked along a few steps, each one engrossed in his own thoughts.\n\nThen the conversation was resumed:--\n\n\"By the way, has the report of Dampierre's death been confirmed?\"\n\n\"Yes, commander.\"\n\n\"Before Cond\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"At the camp of Pamars; he was hit by a cannon-ball.\"\n\nBoisberthelot sighed.\n\n\"Count Dampierre,--another of our men, who took sides with them.\"\n\n\"May he prosper wherever he may be!\" said Vieuville.\n\n\"And the ladies,--where are they?\"\n\n\"At Trieste.\"\n\n\"Still there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah, this republic!\" exclaimed La Vieuville. \"What havoc from so slight\na cause! To think that this revolution was the result of a deficit of\nonly a few millions!\"\n\n\"Insignificant beginnings are not always to be trusted.\"\n\n\"Everything goes wrong,\" replied La Vieuville.\n\n\"Yes; La Rouarie is dead. Du Dresnay is an idiot. What wretched leaders\nare all those bishops,--this Coucy, bishop of La Rochelle; Beaupoil\nSaint-Aulaire, bishop of Poitiers; Mercy, bishop of Luzon, a lover of\nMadame de l'Eschasserie--\"\n\n\"Whose name is Servanteau, you know, commander. Eschasserie is the name\nof an estate.\"\n\n\"And that false bishop of Agra, who is a cur\u00c3\u00a9 of I know not what!\"\n\n\"Of Dol. His name is Guillot de Folleville. But then he is brave, and\nknows how to fight.\"\n\n\"Priests when one needs soldiers! bishops who are no bishops at all!\ngenerals who are no generals!\"\n\nLa Vieuville interrupted Boisberthelot.\n\n\"Have you the 'Moniteur' in your state-room, commander?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What are they giving now in Paris?\"\n\n\"'Ad\u00c3\u00a8le and Pauline' and 'La Caverne.'\"\n\n\"I should like to see that.\"\n\n\"You may. We shall be in Paris in a month.\" Boisberthelot thought a\nmoment, and then added:\n\n\"At the latest,--so Mr. Windham told Lord Hood.\"\n\n\"Then, commander, I take it affairs are not going so very badly?\"\n\n\"All would go well, provided that the Breton war were well managed.\"\n\nDe Vieuville shook his head.\n\n\"Commander,\" he said, \"are we to land the marines?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if the coast is friendly, but not otherwise. In some cases\nwar must force the gates; in others it can slip through them. Civil war\nmust always keep a false key in its pocket. We will do all we can; but\none must have a chief.\"\n\nAnd Boisberthelot added thoughtfully,--\n\n\"What do you think of the Chevalier de Dieuzie, La Vieuville?\"\n\n\"Do you mean the younger?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For a commander?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He is only good for a pitched battle in the open field. It is only the\npeasant who knows the underbrush.\"\n\n\"In that case, you may as well resign yourself to Generals Stofflet and\nCathelineau.\"\n\nLa Vieuville meditated for a moment; then he said,--\n\n\"What we need is a prince,--a French prince, a prince of the blood, a\nreal prince.\"\n\n\"How can that be? He who says 'prince'--\"\n\n\"Says 'coward.' I know it, commander. But we need him for the\nimpression he would produce upon the herd.\"\n\n\"My dear chevalier, the princes don't care to come.\"\n\n\"We will do without them.\"\n\nBoisberthelot pressed his hand mechanically against his forehead, as if\nstriving to evoke an idea. He resumed,--\n\n\"Then let us try this general.\"\n\n\"He is a great nobleman.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will do?\"\n\n\"If he is one of the right sort,\" said La Vieuville.\n\n\"You mean relentless?\" said Boisberthelot.\n\nThe count and the chevalier looked at each other.\n\n\"Monsieur Boisberthelot, you have defined the meaning of the word.\nRelentless,--yes, that's what we need. This is a war that shows no\nmercy. The bloodthirsty are in the ascendant The regicides have\nbeheaded Louis XVI.; we will quarter the regicides. Yes, the general\nwe need is General Relentless. In Anjou and Upper Poitou the leaders\nplay the magnanimous; they trifle with generosity, and they are always\ndefeated. In the Marais and the country of Retz, where the leaders are\nferocious, everything goes bravely forward. It is because Charette is\nfierce that he stands his ground against Parrein,--hyena pitted against\nhyena.\"\n\nBoisberthelot had no time to answer. Vieuville's words were suddenly\ncut short by a desperate cry, and at the same instant they heard a\nnoise unlike all other sounds. This cry and the unusual sounds came\nfrom the interior of the vessel.\n\nThe captain and the lieutenant rushed to the gun-deck, but were unable\nto enter. All the gunners came running up, beside themselves with\nterror.\n\nA frightful thing had just happened.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nTORMENTUM BELLI.\n\n\n[Illustration 011]\n\n\nOne of the carronades of the battery, a twenty-four pound cannon, had\nbecome loose.\n\nThis is perhaps the most dreadful thing that can take place at sea.\nNothing more terrible can happen to a man-of-war under full sail.\n\nA cannon that breaks loose from its fastenings is suddenly transformed\ninto a supernatural beast. It is a monster developed from a machine.\nThis mass runs along on its wheels as easily as a billiard ball; it\nrolls with the rolling, pitches with the pitching, comes and goes,\nstops, seems to meditate, begins anew, darts like an arrow from one end\nof the ship to the other, whirls around, turns aside, evades, rears,\nhits out, crushes, kills, exterminates. It is a ram battering a wall\nat its own pleasure. Moreover, the battering-ram is iron, the wall is\nwood. It is matter set free; one might say that this eternal slave is\nwreaking its vengeance; it would seem as though the evil in what we\ncall inanimate objects had found vent and suddenly burst forth; it has\nthe air of having lost its patience, and of taking a mysterious, dull\nrevenge; nothing is so inexorable as the rage of the inanimate. The\nmad mass leaps like a panther; it has the weight of an elephant, the\nagility of a mouse, the obstinacy of the axe; it takes one by surprise,\nlike the surge of the sea; it flashes like lightning; it is deaf as the\ntomb; it weighs ten thousand pounds, and it bounds like a child's ball;\nit whirls as it advances, and the circles it describes are intersected\nby right angles. And what help is there? How can it be overcome? A\ncalm succeeds the tempest, a cyclone passes over, a wind dies away, we\nreplace the broken mass, we check the leak, we extinguish the fire;\nbut what is to be done with this enormous bronze beast? How can it\nbe subdued? You can reason with a mastiff, take a bull by surprise,\nfascinate a snake, frighten a tiger, mollify a lion; but there is no\nresource with the monster known as a loosened gun. You cannot kill\nit,--it is already dead; and yet it lives. It breathes a sinister life\nbestowed on it by the Infinite. The plank beneath sways it to and fro;\nit is moved by the ship; the sea lifts the ship, and the wind keeps the\nsea in motion. This destroyer is a toy. Its terrible vitality is fed\nby the ship, the waves, and the wind, each lending its aid. What is to\nbe done with this complication? How fetter this monstrous mechanism of\nshipwreck? How foresee its comings and goings, its recoils, its halts,\nits shocks? Any one of those blows may stave in the side of the vessel.\nHow can one guard against these terrible gyrations? One has to do with\na projectile that reflects, that has ideas, and changes its direction\nat any moment. How can one arrest an object in its course, whose\nonslaught must be avoided? The dreadful cannon rushes about, advances,\nrecedes, strikes to right and to left, flies here and there, baffles\ntheir attempts at capture, sweeps away obstacles, crushing men like\nflies.\n\n[Illustration 012]\n\nThe extreme danger of the situation comes from the unsteadiness of\nthe deck. How is one to cope with the caprices of an inclined plane?\nThe ship had within its depths, so to speak, imprisoned lightning\nstruggling for escape; something like the rumbling of thunder during\nan earthquake. In an instant the crew was on its feet. It was the\nchief gunner's fault, who had neglected to fasten the screw-nut of\nthe breeching chain, and had not thoroughly chocked the four trucks\nof the carronade, which allowed play to the frame and bottom of the\ngun-carriage, thereby disarranging the two platforms and parting the\nbreeching. The lashings were broken, so that the gun was no longer firm\non its carriage. The stationary breeching which prevents the recoil was\nnot in use at that time. As a wave struck the ship's side the cannon,\ninsufficiently secured, had receded, and having broken its chain, began\nto wander threatningly over the deck. In order to get an idea of this\nstrange sliding, fancy a drop of water sliding down a pane of glass.\n\nWhen the fastening broke, the gunners were in the battery, singly and\nin groups, clearing the ship for action. The carronade, thrown forward\nby the pitching, dashed into a group of men, killing four of them at\nthe first blow; then, hurled back by the rolling, it cut in two an\nunfortunate fifth man, and struck and dismounted one of the guns of the\nlarboard battery. Hence the cry of distress which had been heard. All\nthe men rushed to the ladder. The gun-deck was empty in the twinkling\nof an eye.\n\nThe monstrous gun was left to itself. It was its own mistress, and\nmistress of the ship. It could do with it whatsoever it wished.\nThis crew, accustomed to laugh in battle, now trembled. It would be\nimpossible to describe their terror.\n\nCaptain Boisberthelot and Lieutenant la Vieuville, brave men though\nthey were, paused at the top of the ladder, silent, pale, and\nundecided, looking down on the deck. Some one pushed them aside with\nhis elbow, and descended. It was their passenger, the peasant, the man\nabout whom they were talking a moment ago.\n\nHaving reached the bottom of the ladder he halted.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nVIS ET VIR.\n\n\n[Illustration 013]\n\n\nThe cannon was rolling to and fro on the deck. It might have been\ncalled the living chariot of the Apocalypse. A dim wavering of lights\nand shadows was added to this spectacle by the marine lantern, swinging\nunder the deck. The outlines of the cannon were indistinguishable, by\nreason of the rapidity of its motion; sometimes it looked black when\nthe light shone upon it, then again it would cast pale, glimmering\nreflections in the darkness.\n\nIt was still pursuing its work of destruction. It had already\nshattered four other pieces, and made two breaches in the ship's side,\nfortunately above the water-line, but which would leak in case of rough\nweather. It rushed frantically against the timbers; the stout riders\nresisted,--curved timbers have great strength; but one could hear them\ncrack under this tremendous assault brought to bear simultaneously on\nevery side, with a certain omnipresence truly appalling.\n\nA bullet shaken in a bottle could not produce sharper or more rapid\nsounds. The four wheels were passing and repassing over the dead\nbodies, cutting and tearing them to pieces, and the five corpses had\nbecome five trunks rolling hither and thither; the heads seemed to cry\nout; streams of blood flowed over the deck, following the motion of the\nship. The ceiling, damaged in several places, had begun to give way.\nThe whole ship was filled with a dreadful tumult.\n\nThe captain, who had rapidly recovered his self-possession, had given\norders to throw down the hatchway all that could abate the rage and\ncheck the mad onslaught of this infuriated gun; mattresses, hammocks,\nspare sails, coils of rope, the bags of the crew, and bales of false\nassignats, with which the corvette was laden,--that infamous stratagem\nof English origin being considered a fair trick in war.\n\nBut what availed these rags? No one dared to go down to arrange them,\nand in a few moments they were reduced to lint.\n\nThere was just sea enough to render this accident as complete as\npossible. A tempest would have been welcome. It might have upset the\ncannon, and with its four wheels once in the air, it could easily have\nbeen mastered. Meanwhile the havoc increased. There were even incisions\nand fractures in the masts, that stood like pillars grounded firmly in\nthe keel, and piercing the several decks of the vessel. The mizzen-mast\nwas split, and even the main-mast was damaged by the convulsive blows\nof the cannon. The destruction of the battery still went on. Ten out of\nthe thirty pieces were useless. The fractures in the side increased,\nand the corvette began to leak.\n\nThe old passenger, who had descended to the gun-deck, looked like one\ncarved in stone as he stood motionless at the foot of the stairs and\nglanced sternly over the devastation. It would have been impossible to\nmove a step upon the deck.\n\nEach bound of the liberated carronade seemed to threaten the\ndestruction of the ship. But a few moments longer, and shipwreck would\nbe inevitable.\n\nThey must either overcome this calamity or perish; some decisive action\nmust be taken. But what?\n\nWhat a combatant was this carronade!\n\nHere was this mad creature to be arrested, this flash of lightning\nto be seized, this thunderbolt to be crushed. Boisberthelot said to\nVieuville:--\n\n\"Do you believe in God, chevalier?\"\n\n\"Yes and no, sometimes I do!\" replied La Vieuville.\n\n\"In a tempest?\"\n\n\"Yes, and in moments like these.\"\n\n\"Truly God alone can save us,\" said Boisberthelot.\n\nAll were silent, leaving the carronade to its horrible uproar.\n\nThe waves beating the ship from without answered the blows of the\ncannon within, very much like a couple of hammers striking in turn.\n\nSuddenly in the midst of this inaccessible circus, where the escaped\ncannon was tossing from side to side, a man appeared, grasping an iron\nbar. It was the author of the catastrophe, the chief gunner, whose\ncriminal negligence had caused the accident,--the captain of the gun.\nHaving brought about the evil, his intention was to repair it. Holding\na handspike in one hand, and in the other a tiller rope with the\nslip-noose in it, he had jumped through the hatchway to the deck below.\n\nThen began a terrible struggle; a titanic spectacle; a combat between\ncannon and cannoneer; a contest between mind and matter; a duel between\nman and the inanimate. The man stood in one corner in an attitude of\nexpectancy, leaning on the rider and holding in his hands the bar and\nthe rope; calm, livid, and tragic, he stood firmly on his legs, that\nwere like two pillars of steel.\n\nHe was waiting for the cannon to approach him.\n\nThe gunner knew his piece, and he felt as though it must know him. They\nhad lived together a long time. How often had he put his hand in its\nmouth. It was his domestic monster. He began to talk to it as he would\nto a dog. \"Come,\" said he. Possibly he loved it.\n\nHe seemed to wish for its coming, and yet its approach meant sure\ndestruction for him. How to avoid being crushed was the question. All\nlooked on in terror.\n\nNot a breath was drawn freely, except perhaps by the old man, who\nremained on the gun-deck gazing sternly on the two combatants.\n\nHe himself was in danger of being crushed by the piece; still he did\nnot move.\n\nBeneath them the blind sea had command of the battle. When, in the act\nof accepting this awful hand-to-hand struggle, the gunner approached\nto challenge the cannon, it happened that the surging sea held the gun\nmotionless for an instant, as though stupefied. \"Come on!\" said the\nman. It seemed to listen.\n\nSuddenly it leaped towards him. The man dodged. Then the struggle\nbegan,--a contest unheard of; the fragile wrestling with the\ninvulnerable; the human warrior attacking the brazen beast; blind force\non the one side, soul on the other.\n\nAll this was in the shadow. It was like an indistinct vision of a\nmiracle.\n\nA soul!--strangely enough it seemed as if a soul existed within the\ncannon, but one consumed with hate and rage. The blind thing seemed\nto have eyes. It appeared as though the monster were watching the\nman. There was, or at least one might have supposed it, cunning in\nthis mass. It also chose its opportunity. It was as though a gigantic\ninsect of iron was endowed with the will of a demon. Now and then this\ncolossal grasshopper would strike the low ceiling of the gun-deck, then\nfalling back on its four wheels, like a tiger on all fours, rush upon\nthe man. He--supple, agile, adroit--writhed like a serpent before these\nlightning movements. He avoided encounters; but the blows from which he\nescaped fell with destructive force upon the vessel. A piece of broken\nchain remained attached to the carronade. This bit of chain had twisted\nin some incomprehensible way around the breech-button.\n\nOne end of the chain was fastened to the gun-carriage; the other end\nthrashed wildly around, aggravating the danger with every bound of\nthe cannon. The screw held it as in a clenched hand, and this chain,\nmultiplying the strokes of the battering-ram by those of the thong,\nmade a terrible whirlwind around the gun,--a lash of iron in a fist of\nbrass. This chain complicated the combat.\n\nDespite all this, the man fought. He even attacked the cannon at times,\ncrawling along by the side of the ship and clutching his handspike and\nthe rope; the cannon seemed to understand his movements, and fled as\nthough suspecting a trap. The man, nothing daunted, pursued his chase.\n\nSuch a struggle must necessarily be brief. Suddenly the cannon seemed\nto say to itself: Now, then, there must be an end to this. And it\nstopped. A crisis was felt to be at hand. The cannon, as if in\nsuspense, seemed to meditate, or--for to all intents and purposes it\nwas a living creature--it really did meditate, some furious design.\nAll at once it rushed on the gunner, who sprang aside with a laugh,\ncrying out, \"Try it again!\" as the cannon passed him. The gun in its\nfury smashed one of the larboard carronades; then, by the invisible\nsling in which it seemed to be held, it was thrown to the starboard,\ntowards the man, who escaped. Three carronades were crushed by its\nonslaught; then, as though blind and beside itself, it turned from the\nman, and rolled from stern to stem, splintering the latter, and causing\na breach in the walls of the prow. The gunner took refuge at the foot\nof the ladder, a short distance from the old man, who stood watching.\nHe held his handspike in readiness. The cannon seemed aware of it, and\nwithout taking the trouble to turn, it rushed backward on the man, as\nswift as the blow of an axe. The gunner, if driven up against the side\nof the ship, would be lost.\n\nOne cry arose from the crew.\n\nThe old passenger--who until this moment had stood motionless--sprang\nforward more swiftly than all those mad whirls. He had seized a bale\nof the false assignats, and at the risk of being crushed succeeded in\nthrowing it between the wheels of the carronade. This decisive and\nperilous manoeuvre could not have been executed with more precision\nand adroitness by an adept in all the exercises given in the work of\nDurosel's \"Manual of Naval Gunnery.\"\n\nThe bale had the effect of a plug. A pebble may block a log; a branch\nsometimes changes the course of an avalanche. The carronade stumbled,\nand the gunner, availing himself of the perilous opportunity, thrust\nhis iron bar between the spokes of the back wheels. Pitching forward,\nthe cannon stopped; and the man, using his bar for a lever, rocked it\nbackward and forward. The heavy mass upset, with the resonant sound of\na bell that crashes in its fall. The man, reeking with perspiration,\nthrew himself upon it, and passed the slip-noose of the tiller-rope\naround the neck of the defeated monster.\n\nThe combat was ended. The man had conquered. The ant had overcome the\nmastodon; the pygmy had imprisoned the thunderbolt.\n\nThe soldiers and sailors applauded.\n\nThe crew rushed forward with chains and cables, and in an instant the\ncannon was secured.\n\nSaluting the passenger, the gunner exclaimed,--\n\n\"Sir, you have saved my life!\"\n\nThe old man had resumed his impassible attitude, and made no reply.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTHE TWO ENDS OF THE SCALE.\n\n\nThe man had conquered; but it might be affirmed that the cannon also\nhad gained a victory. Immediate shipwreck was averted; but the corvette\nwas still in danger. The injuries the ship had sustained seemed\nirreparable. There were five breaches in the sides, one of them--a\nvery large one--in the bow, and twenty carronades out of thirty lay\nshattered in their frames. The recaptured gun, which had been secured\nby a chain, was itself disabled. The screw of the breech-button being\nwrenched, it would consequently be impossible to level the cannon. The\nbattery was reduced to nine guns; there was a leakage in the hold. All\nthese damages must be repaired without loss of time, and the pumps\nset in operation. Now that the gun-deck had become visible, it was\nfrightful to look upon. The interior of a mad elephant's cage could not\nhave been more thoroughly devastated. However important it might be for\nthe corvette to avoid observation, the care for its immediate safety\nwas still more imperative. They were obliged to light the deck with\nlanterns placed at intervals along the sides.\n\nIn the mean time, while this tragic entertainment had lasted, the crew,\nentirely absorbed by a question of life and death, had not noticed what\nwas going on outside of the ship. The fog had thickened, the weather\nhad changed, the wind had driven the vessel at will; they were out of\ntheir course, in full sight of Jersey and Guernsey, much farther to\nthe south than they ought to have been, and confronting a tumultuous\nsea. The big waves kissed the wounded sides of the corvette with kisses\nthat savored of danger. The heaving of the sea grew threatening; the\nwind had risen to a gale; a squall, perhaps a tempest, was brewing. One\ncould not see four oars' length before one.\n\nWhile the crew made haste with their temporary repairs on the gun-deck,\nstopping the leaks and setting up the cannons that had escaped\nuninjured, the old passenger returned to the deck.\n\nHe stood leaning against the main-mast.\n\nHe had taken no notice of what was going on in the ship. The Chevalier\nde la Vieuville had drawn up the marines on either side of the\nmain-mast, and at a signal-whistle of the boatswain the sailors,\nwho had been busy in the rigging, stood up on the yards. Count\nBoisberthelot approached the passenger. The captain was followed by a\nman, who, haggard and panting, with his dress in disorder, still wore\non his countenance an expression of content.\n\nIt was the gunner who had so opportunely displayed his power as a tamer\nof monsters, and gained the victory over the cannon.\n\nThe count made a military salute to the old man in the peasant garb,\nand said to him:--\n\n\"Here is the man, general.\"\n\nThe gunner, with downcast eyes, stood erect in a military attitude.\n\n\"General,\" resumed Count Boisberthelot, \"considering what this man has\ndone, do you not think that his superiors have a duty to perform?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" replied the old man.\n\n\"Be so good as to give your orders,\" resumed Boisberthelot.\n\n\"It is for you to give them; you are the captain.\"\n\n\"But you are the general,\" answered Boisberthelot.\n\nThe old man looked at the gunner.\n\n\"Step forward,\" he said.\n\nThe gunner advanced a step.\n\nTurning to Count Boisberthelot, the old man removed the cross of Saint\nLouis from the captain's breast, and fastened it on the jacket of the\ngunner. The sailors cheered, and the marines presented arms.\n\nThen pointing to the bewildered gunner he added:\n\n\"Now let the man be shot!\"\n\nStupor took the place of applause.\n\nThen, amid a tomb-like silence, the old man, raising his voice, said:--\n\n[Illustration 014]\n\n\"The ship has been endangered by an act of carelessness, and may even\nyet be lost. It is all the same whether one be at sea or face to face\nwith the enemy. A ship at sea is like an army in battle. The tempest,\nthough unseen, is ever present; the sea is an ambush. Death is the fit\npenalty for every fault committed when facing the enemy. There is no\nfault that can be retrieved. Courage must be rewarded and negligence\npunished.\"\n\nThese words fell one after the other slowly and gravely, with a certain\nimplacable rhythm, like the strokes of the axe upon an oak-tree.\nLooking at the soldiers, the old man added,--\n\n\"Do your duty!\"\n\nThe man on whose breast shone the cross of Saint Louis bowed his\nhead, and at a sign of Count Boisberthelot two sailors went down to\nthe gun-deck, and presently returned bringing the hammock-shroud; the\ntwo sailors were accompanied by the ship's chaplain, who since the\ndeparture had been engaged in saying prayers in the officers' quarters.\nA sergeant detached from the ranks twelve soldiers, whom he arranged\nin two rows, six men in a row. The gunner placed himself between the\ntwo lines. The chaplain, holding a crucifix, advanced and took his\nplace beside the man. \"March!\" came from the lips of the sergeant;\nand the platoon slowly moved towards the bow, followed by two sailors\ncanning the shroud.\n\nA gloomy silence fell on the corvette. In the distance a hurricane was\nblowing. A few moments later, a report echoed through the gloom; one\nflash, and all was still. Then came the splash of a body falling into\nthe water. The old passenger, still leaning against the main-mast, his\nhands crossed on his breast, seemed lost in thought. Boisberthelot,\npointing towards him with the forefinger of his left hand, remarked in\nan undertone to La Vieuville,--\n\n\"The Vend\u00c3\u00a9e has found a leader.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nHE WHO SETS SAIL INVESTS IN A LOTTERY.\n\n\nBut what was to become of the corvette? The clouds that had mingled all\nnight with the waves had now fallen so low that they overspread the\nsea like a mantle, and completely shut out the horizon. Nothing but\nfog,--always a dangerous situation, even for a seaworthy vessel.\n\nA heavy swell was added to the mist.\n\nThey had improved their time; the corvette had been lightened by\nthrowing into the sea everything that they had been able to clear\naway after the havoc caused by the carronade,--dismantled cannons,\ngun-carriages, twisted or loosened timbers, splintered pieces of wood\nand iron; the port-holes were opened, and the corpses and parts of\nhuman bodies, wrapped in tarpaulin, were slid down on planks into the\nsea.\n\nThe sea was running high. Not that the tempest was imminent. On the\nother hand, it seemed as if the hurricane, that was rumbling afar off\non the horizon, and the wind were both decreasing and moving northward;\nbut the waves were still high, showing an angry sea, and the corvette\nin its disabled condition could with difficulty resist the shocks, so\nthat the high waves might prove fatal to it. Gacquoil, absorbed in\nthought, remained at the helm. To show a bold front in the presence of\ndanger is the habit of commanders.\n\nLa Vieuville, whose spirits rose in time of trouble, addressed Gacquoil.\n\n\"Well, pilot,\" he said, \"the squall has subsided. Its sneezing-fit came\nto naught. We shall pull through. We shall get some wind, and nothing\nmore.\"\n\n\"We can't have wind without waves.\"\n\nA true sailor, neither gay nor sad; and his reply was charged with\nan anxious significance. For a leaking ship a high sea means a rapid\nsinking. Gacquoil had emphasized this prediction by frowning. Perhaps\nhe thought that after the catastrophe with the cannon and the gunner,\nLa Vieuville had been too quick to use light-hearted, almost cheerful,\nwords. Certain things bring ill-luck at sea. The sea is reticent; one\nnever knows its intentions, and it is well to be on one's guard.\n\nLa Vieuville felt obliged to resume his gravity.\n\n\"Where are we, pilot?\" he asked.\n\n\"In the hands of God,\" replied the pilot.\n\nA pilot is a master; he must always be allowed to do what pleases him,\nand often to say what he chooses. That kind of man is not apt to be\nloquacious. La Vieuville left him, after asking a question to which the\nhorizon soon replied.\n\nThe sea had suddenly cleared.\n\nThe trailing fogs were rent; the dusky heaving waves stretched as far\nas the eye could penetrate into the dim twilight, and this was the\nsight that lay before them.\n\nThe sky was shut in by clouds, although they no longer touched the\nwater. The dawn had begun to illumine the east, while in the west\nthe setting moon still cast a pale glimmering light These two pallid\npresences in opposite quarters of the sky outlined the horizon in two\nnarrow bands of light between the dark sea and the gloomy sky. Black\nsilhouettes were sketched against them, upright and motionless.\n\nIn the west, against the moonlit sky, three high cliffs stood forth,\nlike Celtic cromlechs.\n\nIn the east, against the pale horizon of the morning, eight sails drawn\nup in a row in formidable array came in view. The three cliffs were a\nreef, the eight sails a squadron. Behind them was Minquiers, a cliff\nof ill-repute, and in front were the French cruisers. With an abyss on\nthe left hand, and carnage on the right, they had to choose between\nshipwreck and a battle. The corvette must either encounter the cliffs\nwith a damaged hull, a shattered rigging, and broken masts, or face\na battle, knowing that twenty out of the thirty cannons of which her\nartillery consisted were disabled, and the best of her gunners dead.\n\nThe dawn was still feint, and the night not yet ended. This darkness\nmight possibly last for quite a long time, as it was caused mostly by\nthe clouds that hung high in the air, thick and dense, looking like a\nsolid vault.\n\nThe wind had scattered the sea-fog, driving the corvette on Minquiers.\n\nIn her extreme weakness, and dilapidated as she was, she hardly obeyed\nthe helm as she rolled helplessly along, lashed onward by the force of\nthe waves.\n\nThe Minquiers--that tragic reef!--was more dangerous at that time\nthan it is now. Several of the turrets of this marine fortress have\nbeen worn away by the incessant action of the sea. The form of reefs\nchanges; waves are fitly likened unto swords; each tide is like the\nstroke of a saw. At that time, to be stranded on the Minquiers meant\ncertain death. The cruisers composed the squadron of Cancale,--the one\nthat afterwards became so famous under the command of Captain Duchesne,\ncalled by Lequinio \"P\u00c3\u00a8re Duchesne.\"\n\nThe situation was critical. During the struggle with the carronade the\nship had wandered unconsciously from her course, sailing more in the\ndirection of Granville than of St. Malo. Even had her sailing power\nbeen unimpaired, the Minquiers would have barred her return to Jersey,\nwhile the cruisers hindered her passage towards France. Although there\nwas no storm, yet, as the pilot had said, the sea was rough. Rolled by\nthe heavy wind over a rocky bottom, it had grown savage.\n\nThe sea never tells what it wants at the first onset. Everything lies\nconcealed in its abyss, even trickery. One might almost affirm that\nit has a scheme. It advances and recedes; it offers and refuses; it\narranges for a storm, and suddenly gives up its intention; it promises\nan abyss, and fails to keep its agreement; it threatens the north, and\nstrikes the south. All night long the corvette \"Claymore\" labored with\nthe fog and feared the storm; the sea had disappointed them in a savage\nsort of way. It had drawn a storm in outline, and filled in the picture\nwith a reef.\n\n[Illustration 015]\n\nIt was to be a shipwreck in any event, but it had assumed another form,\nand with one enemy to supplement the work of the other, it was to\ncombine a wreck on the surf with destruction by battle.\n\n\"A shipwreck on the one hand and a fight on the other!\" exclaimed\nVieuville amid his gallant laughter. \"We have thrown double fives on\nboth sides!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n9:380.\n\n\n[Illustration 016]\n\n\nThe corvette was little better than a wreck.\n\nA sepulchral solemnity pervaded the dim twilight, the darkness of\nthe clouds, the confused changes of the horizon, and the mysterious\nsullenness of the waves. There was no sound except the hostile blasts\nof the wind. The catastrophe rose majestic from the abyss. It looked\nmore like an apparition than an attack. No stir on the rocks, no stir\non the ships. The silence was overpowering beyond description. Were\nthey dealing with reality? It was like a dream passing over the sea.\nThere are legends that tell of such visions. The corvette lay, so to\nspeak, between a demon reef and a phantom fleet.\n\nCount Boisberthelot in a low voice gave orders to La Vieuville, who\nwent down to the gun-deck, while the captain, seizing his telescope,\nstationed himself behind the pilot. Gacquoil's sole effort was to keep\nup the corvette to the wind; for if struck on her side by the sea and\nthe wind, she would inevitably capsize.\n\n\"Pilot, where are we?\" said the captain.\n\n\"On the Minquiers.\"\n\n\"On which side?\"\n\n\"On the worst one.\"\n\n\"What kind of bottom?\"\n\n\"Small rocks.\"\n\n\"Can we turn broadside on?\"\n\n\"We can always die.\"\n\nThe captain turned his spy-glass towards the west and examined the\nMinquiers; then turning it to the east he watched the sails that were\nin sight.\n\nThe pilot went on, as though speaking to himself:\n\n\"Yonder is the Minquiers. That is where the laughing sea-mew and the\ngreat black-hooded gull stop to rest when they migrate from Holland.\"\n\nMeanwhile the captain had counted the sails.\n\nThere were, indeed, eight ships drawn up in line, their warlike\nprofiles rising above the water. In the centre was seen the stately\noutline of a three-decker.\n\nThe captain questioned the pilot.\n\n\"Do you know those ships?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"That's the squadron.\"\n\n\"Of the French?\"\n\n\"Of the Devil.\"\n\nA silence ensued; and again the captain resumed his questions.\n\n\"Are all the cruisers there?\"\n\n\"No, not all.\"\n\nIn fact, on the 2d of April, Valaz\u00c3\u00a9 had reported to the Convention that\nten frigates and six ships of the line were cruising in the Channel.\nThe captain remembered this.\n\n\"You are right,\" he said; \"the squadron numbers sixteen ships, and only\neight are here.\"\n\n\"The others are straggling along the coast down below, on the lookout,\"\nsaid Gacquoil.\n\nStill gazing through his spy-glass the captain murmured,--\n\n\"One three-decker, two first-class and five second-class frigates.\"\n\n\"I too have seen them close at hand,\" muttered Gacquoil. \"I know them\ntoo well to mistake one for the other.\"\n\nThe captain passed his glass to the pilot.\n\n\"Pilot, can you make out distinctly the largest ship?\"\n\n\"Yes, commander. It is the 'C\u00c3\u00b4te-d'Or.'\"\n\n\"They have given it a new name. It used to be the '\u00c3\u0089tats de\nBourgogne,'--a new ship of a hundred and twenty-eight cannon.\"\n\nHe took a memorandum-book and pencil from his pocket, and wrote down\nthe number \"128.\"\n\n\"Pilot, what is the first ship on the port?\"\n\n\"The 'Exp\u00c3\u00a9riment\u00c3\u00a9e.'\"\n\n\"A frigate of the first class; fifty-two guns. She was fitting out at\nBrest two months ago.\"\n\nThe captain put down on his note-book the number \"52.\"\n\n\"What is the second ship to port, pilot?\"\n\n\"The 'Dryade.'\"\n\n\"A frigate of the first class; forty eighteen-pounders. She has been in\nIndia, and has a glorious military record.\"\n\nAnd below the \"52\" he wrote the number \"40.\" Then, raising his head, he\nsaid,--\n\n\"Now, on the starboard?\"\n\n\"They are all second-class frigates, commander; there are five of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Which is the first one from the ship?\"\n\n\"The 'R\u00c3\u00a9solue.'\"\n\n\"Thirty-two eighteen-pounders. The second?\"\n\n\"The 'Richmond.'\"\n\n\"Same. Next?\"\n\n\"The 'Ath\u00c3\u00a9e.'\"\n\n\"A queer name to sail under. Next?\"\n\n\"The 'Calypso.'\"\n\n\"Next?\"\n\n\"The 'Preneuse.'\"\n\n\"Five frigates, each of thirty-two guns.\"\n\nThe captain wrote \"160\" under the first numbers.\n\n\"You are sure you recognize them, pilot?\" he asked.\n\n\"You also know them well, commander. It is something to recognize them;\nbut it is better to know them.\"\n\nThe captain, with his eyes on the note-book, was adding up the column\nto himself.\n\n\"One hundred and twenty-eight, fifty-two, forty, one hundred and sixty.\"\n\nJust then La Vieuville came up on deck.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" exclaimed the captain, \"we are facing three hundred and\neighty cannon.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" replied La Vieuville.\n\n\"You have just been making an inspection, La Vieuville: how many guns\nhave we fit for service?\"\n\n\"Nine.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" responded Boisberthelot in his turn; and taking the\ntelescope from the pilot, he scanned the horizon.\n\nThe eight black and silent ships, though they appeared immovable,\ncontinued to increase in size.\n\nThey were gradually drawing nearer.\n\nLa Vieuville saluted the captain.\n\n\"Commander,\" he said, \"here is my report. I mistrusted this corvette\n'Claymore.' It is never pleasant to be suddenly ordered on board a\nship that neither knows nor loves you. An English ship is a traitor\nto the French. That slut of a carronade proved this. I have made the\ninspection. The anchors are good; they are not made of inferior iron,\nbut hammered out of solid bars; the flukes are solid; the cables are\nexcellent, easy to pay out, and have the requisite length of one\nhundred and twenty fathoms. Plenty of ammunition; six gunners dead;\neach gun has one hundred and seventy-one rounds.\"\n\n\"Because there are only nine cannon left,\" grumbled the captain.\n\nBoisberthelot levelled his glass to the horizon. The squadron continued\nits slow approach. Carronades have one advantage: three men are\nsufficient to man them. But they also have a disadvantage: they do\nnot carry as far, and shoot with less precision than cannon. It was\ntherefore necessary to let the squadron approach within the range of\nthe carronades.\n\nThe captain gave his orders in a low voice. Silence reigned on the\nship. No signal to clear the decks for action had been given, but still\nit had been done. The corvette was as helpless to cope with men as with\nthe sea. They did their best with this remnant of a war-ship. Near\nthe tiller-ropes on the gangway were piled spare hawsers and cables,\nto strengthen the mast in case of need. The quarters for the wounded\nwere put in order. According to the naval practice of those days, they\nbarricaded the deck,--which is a protection against balls, but not\nagainst bullets. The ball-gauges were brought, although it was rather\nlate to ascertain the caliber; but they had not anticipated so many\nincidents. Cartridge-boxes were distributed among the sailors, and\neach one secured a pair of pistols and a dirk in his belt. Hammocks\nwere stowed away, guns were pointed, and muskets, axes, and grapplings\nprepared. The cartridge and bullet stores were put in readiness; the\npowder-magazine was opened; every man stood at his post. Not a word was\nspoken while these preparations went on amid haste and gloom; and it\nseemed like the room of a dying person.\n\nThen the corvette was turned broadside on. She carried six anchors,\nlike a frigate, and all of them were cast,--the spare anchor forward,\nthe kedger aft, the sea-anchor towards the open, the ebb-anchor towards\nthe breakers, the bower-anchor to starboard, and the sheet-anchor to\nport. The nine uninjured carronades were placed as a battery on the\nside towards the enemy.\n\nThe squadron, equally silent, had also finished its evolutions. The\neight ships now stood in a semicircle, of which Minquiers formed\nthe chord. The \"Claymore\" enclosed within this semicircle, and held\nfurthermore by its own anchors, was backed by the reef,--signifying\nshipwreck. It was like a pack of hounds surrounding a wild boar, not\ngiving tongue, but showing its teeth.\n\nIt seemed as if each side were waiting for something.\n\nThe gunners of the \"Claymore\" stood to their guns.\n\nBoisberthelot said to La Vieuville,--\n\n\"I should like to be the first to open fire.\"\n\n\"A coquette's fancy,\" replied La Vieuville.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nSOME ONE ESCAPES.\n\n\nThe passenger had not left the deck; he watched all that was going on\nwith his customary impassibility.\n\nBoisberthelot went up to him.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"the preparations are completed. We are now clinging to\nour grave; we shall not relax our hold. We must succumb either to the\nsquadron or to the reef. The alternative is before us: either shipwreck\namong the breakers or surrender to the enemy. But the resource of death\nis still left; better to fight than be wrecked. I would rather be shot\nthan drowned; fire before water, if the choice be left to me. But\nwhere it is our duty to die it is not yours. You are the man chosen by\nprinces. You have an important mission,--that of directing the Vendean\nwar. Your death might result in the failure of monarchy; therefore\nyou must live. While honor requires us to stand by the ship, it calls\non you to escape. You must leave us, General; I will provide you with\na boat and a man. You may succeed in reaching the shore, by making a\nd\u00c3\u00a9tour. It is not yet daylight; the waves are high and the sea dark.\nYou will probably escape. There are occasions when to flee means to\nconquer.\"\n\nThe old man bent his stately head in token of acquiescence.\n\nCount Boisberthelot raised his voice.\n\n\"Soldiers and sailors!\" he called.\n\nEvery movement ceased, and from all sides faces were turned in the\ndirection of the captain.\n\nHe continued:--\n\n\"This man who is among us represents the king. He has been intrusted to\nour care; we must save him. He is needed for the throne of France. As\nwe have no prince, he is to be,--at least we hope so,--the leader of\nthe Vend\u00c3\u00a9e. He is a great general. He was to land with us in France;\nnow he must land without us. If we save the head we save all.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" cried the voices of all the crew.\n\nThe captain went on:--\n\n\"He too is about to face a serious danger. It is not easy to reach the\ncoast. The boat must be large enough to live in this sea, and small\nenough to escape the cruisers. He must land at some safe point, and\nit will be better to do so nearer Foug\u00c3\u00a8res than Coutances. We want a\nhardy sailor, a good oars-man and a strong swimmer, a man from that\nneighborhood, and one who knows the straits. It is still so dark that\na boat can put off from the corvette without attracting attention; and\nlater there will be smoke enough to hide it from view. Its size will be\nan advantage in the shallows. Where the panther is caught, the weasel\nescapes. Although there is no outlet for us, there may be for a small\nrowboat; the enemy's ships will not see it, and, what is more, about\nthat time we shall be giving them plenty of diversion. Is it decided?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" cried the crew.\n\n\"Then there is not a moment to be lost,\" continued the captain. \"Is\nthere a man among you willing to undertake the business?\"\n\nIn the darkness, a sailor stepped out of the ranks and said,--\n\n\"I am the man.\"\n\n[Illustration 017]\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nDOES HE ESCAPE?\n\n\n[Illustration 018]\n\n\nA few minutes later, one of those small boats called a gig, which are\nalways devoted to the use of the captain, pushed off from the ship.\nThere were two men in this boat,--the passenger in the stern, and the\nvolunteer sailor in the bow. The night was still very dark. The sailor,\naccording to the captain's instructions, rowed energetically towards\nthe Minquiers. For that matter, it was the only direction in which\nhe could row. Some provisions had been placed in the bottom of the\nboat,--a bag of biscuits, a smoked tongue, and a barrel of water.\n\nJust as they were lowering the gig, La Vieuville, a very scoffer in the\npresence of destruction, leaning over the stern-post of the corvette,\ncried out in his cool sneering voice a parting word:--\n\n\"Very good for escaping, and still better for drowning.\"\n\n\"Sir, let us joke no more,\" said the pilot.\n\nThey pushed off rapidly, and soon left the corvette far behind. Both\nwind and tide were in the oars-man's favor, and the small skiff flew\nrapidly along, wavering to and fro in the twilight, and hidden by the\nhigh crests of the waves.\n\nA gloomy sense of expectation brooded over the sea.\n\nSuddenly amid this illimitable, tumultuous silence a voice was heard;\nexaggerated by the speaking-trumpet, as by the brazen mask of ancient\ntragedy, it seemed almost superhuman.\n\nIt was Captain Boisberthelot speaking.\n\n\"Royal marines,\" he exclaimed, \"nail the white flag to the mizzen-mast!\nWe are about to look upon our last sunrise!\"\n\nAnd the corvette fired a shot.\n\n\"Long live the King!\" shouted the crew.\n\nThen from the verge of the horizon was heard another shout, stupendous,\nremote, confused, and yet distinct,--\n\n\"Long live the Republic!\"\n\nAnd a din like unto the roar of three hundred thunderbolts exploded in\nthe depths of the sea.\n\nThe conflict began. The sea was covered with fire and smoke.\n\nJets of spray thrown up by the balls as they struck the water rose from\nthe sea on all sides.\n\nThe \"Claymore\" was pouring forth flame on the eight vessels; the\nsquadron, ranged in a semicircle around her, opened fire from all\nits batteries. The horizon was in a blaze. A volcano seemed to have\nsprung from the sea. The wind swept to and fro this stupendous crimson\ndrapery of battle through which the vessels appeared and disappeared\nlike phantoms. Against the red sky in the foreground were sketched the\noutlines of the corvette.\n\nThe fleur-de-lis flag could be seen floating from the main-mast.\n\nThe two men in the boat were silent. The triangular shoal of the\nMinquiers, a kind of submarine Trinacrium, is larger than the isle of\nJersey. The sea covers it. Its culminating point is a plateau that is\nnever submerged, even at the highest tide, and from which rise, towards\nthe northeast, six mighty rocks standing in a line, producing the\neffect of a massive wall which has crumbled here and there. The strait\nbetween the plateau and the six reefs is accessible only to vessels\ndrawing very little water. Beyond this strait is the open sea.\n\n[Illustration 019]\n\nThe sailor who had volunteered to manage the boat headed for the\nstrait. Thus he had put Minquiers between the boat and the battle.\nHe navigated skilfully in the narrow channel, avoiding rocks to\nstarboard and port. The cliff now hid the battle from their view. The\nflaming horizon and the furious din of the cannonade were growing less\ndistinct, by reason of the increased distance; but judging from the\ncontinued explosions one could guess that the corvette still held its\nown, and that it meant to use its hundred and ninety-one rounds to\nthe very last. The boat soon found itself in smooth waters beyond the\ncliffs and the battle, and out of the reach of missiles. Gradually the\nsurface of the sea lost something of its gloom; the rays of light that\nhad been swallowed up in the shadows began to widen; the curling foam\nleaped forth in jets of light, and the broken waves sent back their\npale reflections. Daylight appeared.\n\nThe boat was beyond reach of the enemy, but the principal difficulty\nstill remained to be overcome. It was safe from grape-shot, but the\ndanger of shipwreck was not yet past. It was on the open sea, a mere\nshell, with neither deck, sail, mast, nor compass, entirely dependent\non its oars, face to face with the ocean and the hurricane,--a pygmy at\nthe mercy of giants.\n\nThen amid this infinite solitude, his face whitened by the morning\nlight, the man in the bow of the boat raised his head and gazed\nsteadily at the man in the stern as he said,--\n\n\"I am the brother of him whom you ordered to be shot.\"\n\n[Illustration 020]\n\n[Illustration: Halmalo 021]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\n\nHALMALO.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nSPEECH IS WORD.\n\n\n[Illustration 022]\n\n\nThe old man slowly lifted his head.\n\nHe who had addressed him was about thirty years of age. The tan of the\nsea was upon his brow; there was something unusual about his eyes, as\nif the simple pupils of the peasant had taken on the keen expression\nof the sailor; he held his oars firmly in his hands. He looked gentle\nenough. In his belt he wore a dirk, two pistols, and a rosary.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said the old man.\n\n\"I have just told you.\"\n\n\"What do you wish?\"\n\nThe man dropped the oars, folded his arms, and replied,--\n\n\"To kill you.\"\n\n\"As you please!\" replied the old man.\n\nThe man raised his voice.\n\n\"Prepare yourself.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"To die.\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired the old man.\n\nA silence followed. For a moment the question seemed to abash the man.\nHe continued,--\n\n\"I tell you that I mean to kill you.\"\n\n\"And I ask of you the reason.\"\n\nThe sailor's eyes flashed.\n\n\"Because you killed my brother.\"\n\nThe old man answered quietly,--\n\n\"I saved his life at first.\"\n\n\"True. You saved him first, but you killed him afterwards.\"\n\n\"It was not I who killed him.\"\n\n\"Who was it, then?\"\n\n\"His own fault.\"\n\nThe sailor gazed on the old man open-mouthed; then once more his brows\ncontracted savagely.\n\n\"What is your name?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"My name is Halmalo, but I can kill you all the same, whether you know\nmy name or not.\"\n\nJust then the sun rose; a ray struck the sailor full in the face,\nvividly illumining that wild countenance.\n\nThe old man studied it closely. The cannonading, though not yet ended,\nwas no longer continuous. A dense smoke had settled upon the horizon.\nThe boat, left to itself, was drifting to leeward.\n\nWith his right hand the sailor seized one of the pistols at his belt,\nwhile in his left he held his rosary.\n\nThe old man rose to his feet.\n\n\"Do you believe in God?\" he asked.\n\n\"'Our Father who art in heaven.'\" replied the sailor.\n\nThen he made the sign of the cross.\n\n\"Have you a mother?\"\n\nHe crossed himself again, saying,--\n\n\"I have said all I have to say. I give you one minute longer, my lord.\"\n\nAnd he cocked the pistol.\n\n\"Why do you call me 'My lord'?\"\n\n\"Because you are one. That is evident enough.\"\n\n\"Have you a lord yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, and a grand one too. Is one likely to be without a lord?\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"I do not know. He has left the country. His name is Marquis de\nLantenac, Viscount de Fontenay, Prince in Brittany; he is lord of the\nSept-For\u00c3\u00aats. I never saw him, but he is my master all the same.\"\n\n\"If you were to see him, would you obey him?\"\n\n\"Of course I should be a heathen were I not to obey him! We owe\nobedience to God, and after that to the king, who is like unto God, and\nthen to the lord, who is like the king. But that has nothing to do with\nthe question; you have killed my brother, and I must kill you.\"\n\nThe old man replied,--\n\n\"Let us say, then, that I did kill your brother; I did well.\"\n\nThe sailor had closed more firmly upon his pistol.\n\n\"Come!\" he said.\n\n\"So be it,\" said the old man.\n\nAnd he added composedly,--\n\n\"Where is the priest?\"\n\nThe sailor looked at him.\n\n\"The priest?\"\n\n\"Yes. I gave your brother a priest; therefore it is your duty to\nprovide one for me.\"\n\n\"But I have none,\" replied the sailor.\n\nAnd he continued,--\n\n\"How do you expect to find a priest here on the open sea?\"\n\nThe convulsive explosions of the battle sounded more and more distant.\n\n\"Those who are dying yonder have their priest,\" said the old man.\n\n\"I know it,\" muttered the sailor; \"they have the chaplain.\"\n\nThe old man went on,--\n\n\"If you make me lose my soul, it will be a serious matter.\"\n\nThe sailor thoughtfully bent his head.\n\n\"And if my soul is lost,\" continued the old man, \"yours will be lost\nalso. Listen to me; I feel pity for you. You shall do as you like. For\nmy part, I only fulfilled my duty when I first saved your brother's\nlife and afterwards took it from him; and at the present moment I am\ndoing my duty in trying to save your soul. Reflect; for it is a matter\nthat concerns you. Do you hear the cannon-shots? Men are dying over\nyonder; desperate men, in their last agony, husbands who will never\nsee their wives, fathers who will never see their children, brothers\nwho, like yourself, will never see their brothers. And who is to blame\nfor it? Your own brother. You believe in God, do you not? If so, you\nknow that God is suffering now. He is suffering in the person of his\nson, the most Christian king of France, who is a child like the child\nJesus, and who is now imprisoned in the Temple; God is suffering in\nhis Church of Brittany, in his desecrated cathedrals, in his Gospels\ntorn to fragments, in his violated houses of prayer, in his murdered\npriests. What were we about to do with that ship which is perishing\nat this moment? We were going to the relief of the Lord. If your\nbrother had been a trustworthy servant, if he had performed his duties\nfaithfully, like a good and useful man, no misfortune would have\nhappened to the carronade, the corvette would not have been disabled,\nshe would not have got out of her course and fallen into the hands of\nthat cursed fleet, and we should all now be landing in France, brave\nsailors and soldiers as we were, sword in hand, with our white banner\nunfurled, a multitude of contented, happy men, advancing to the rescue\nof the brave Vendean peasants, on our way to save France, the king, and\nAlmighty God. That is what we were intending to do, what we should have\ndone, and what I, the only one remaining, still propose to do. But you\nintend to prevent me. In this struggle of impious men against priests,\nin this conflict of regicides against the king, of Satan against God,\nyou range yourself in the ranks of Satan. Your brother was the Devil's\nfirst assistant, you are his second. What he began you mean to finish.\nYou are for the regicides against the throne; you take sides with the\nimpious against the Church. You take away the Lord's last resource.\nFor, as I shall not be there,--I, who represent the king,--villages\nwill continue to burn, families to mourn, priests to bleed, Brittany\nto suffer, the king to remain imprisoned, and Jesus Christ to grieve\nover his people. And who will have caused all this? You. Well, you are\ncarrying out your own plans. I expected far different things from you,\nbut I was mistaken. It is true that I killed your brother. He played\na brave part, for that I rewarded him; he was guilty, therefore I\npunished him. He failed in his duty; I have not failed in mine. What I\ndid I would do again; and I swear by the great Saint Anne of Auray, who\nlooks down on us, that under like circumstances I would shoot my own\nson just as I shot your brother. Now you are the master. Indeed, I pity\nyou. You have broken your word to the captain,--you, Christian without\nfaith; you, Breton without honor. I was intrusted to your loyalty, and\nyou accepted the trust meaning to betray it; you offer my death to\nthose to whom you have promised my life. Do you realize whom you are\ndestroying here? It is your own self. You rob the king of my life, and\nyou consign yourself forever to the Devil. Go on, commit your crime.\nYou set a low value on your share in Paradise. Thanks to you, the Devil\nwill conquer; thanks to you, the churches will fall; thanks to you, the\nheathen will go on turning bells into cannon,--men will be shot with\nthe very instrument that once brought to mind the salvation of their\nsouls. Perhaps at this moment, while I still speak to you, the same\nbell that pealed for your baptism is killing your mother. Go on with\nthe Devil's work. Do not pause. Yes, I have condemned your brother; but\nlearn this,--I am but a tool in the hands of God. Ah I you pretend to\njudge God's ways? You will next sit in judgment on the thunderbolt in\nthe heavens. Wretched man, you will be judged by it. Beware what you\ndo. Do you even know whether I am in a state of grace? No. Never mind,\ngo on; do your will. You have the power to hurl me to perdition, and\nyourself likewise. Your own damnation, as well as mine, rests in your\nhands. You will be answerable before God. We are alone, face to face\nwith the abyss; complete your work, make an end of it. I am old, and\nyou are young; I have no weapons, you are armed: kill me.\"\n\nWhile the old man, standing erect, was uttering these words in a voice\nthat rang above the tumult of the sea, the undulations of the waves\nshowed him now in shadow, now in light. The sailor had turned ghostly\npale; large drops of moisture fell from his brow; he trembled like a\nleaf; now and then he kissed his rosary. When the old man finished, he\nthrew away his pistol and fell on his knees.\n\n\"Pardon, my lord! forgive me!\" he cried. \"You speak like our Lord\nhimself. I have been wrong. My brother was guilty. I will do all I can\nto make amends for his crime. Dispose of me; command me: I will obey.\"\n\n\"I forgive you,\" said the old man.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nA PEASANT'S MEMORY IS WORTH AS MUCH AS THE CAPTAIN'S SCIENCE.\n\n\nThe provisions with which the boat had been stocked were far from\nsuperfluous; for the two fugitives were forced to make long d\u00c3\u00a9tours,\nand were thirty-six hours in reaching the coast. They passed the night\nat sea; but the night was fine, with more moonlight than is pleasing to\npeople who wish to escape observation.\n\nAt first they were obliged to keep away from the French coast, and gain\nthe open sea in the direction of Jersey. They heard the final volley\nfrom the unfortunate corvette, and it sounded like the roar of a lion\nwhom the hunters are killing in the forest. Then a silence fell upon\nthe sea.\n\nThe corvette \"Claymore\" perished like the \"Vengeur;\" but glory has kept\nno record of its deeds. One can win no laurels who fights against his\nnative land.\n\nHalmalo was a remarkable sailor. He performed miracles of skill and\nsagacity. The route that he improvised amid the reefs, the waves, and\nthe vigilance of the enemy was a masterpiece. The wind had abated, and\nthe struggle with the sea was over. Halmalo had avoided the Caux des\nMinquiers, and having rounded the Chauss\u00c3\u00a9e aux Boeufs, took refuge\nthere, so as to get a few hours of rest in the little creek formed\nby the sea at low tide; then rowing southward, he continued to pass\nbetween Granville and the Chausey Islands without being noticed by\nthe lookout either of Chausey or Granville. He entered the Bay of\nSaint-Michel,--a daring feat, considering that the cruising squadron\nwas anchored at Cancale.\n\nOn the evening of the second day, about an hour before sunset, he\npassed the hill of Saint-Michel, and landed on a shore that is always\navoided on account of the danger from its shifting sand.\n\n[Illustration 023]\n\nFortunately the tide was high.\n\nHalmalo pushed the boat as far as he could, tried the sand, and,\nfinding it firm, grounded the boat and jumped ashore, the old man\nfollowing, with eyes turned anxiously towards the horizon.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Halmalo, \"this is the mouth of the Couesnon. We have\nBeauvoir to starboard, and Huisnes to port. The belfry before us is\nArdevon.\"\n\nThe old man bent over the boat, took from it a biscuit, which he put in\nhis pocket, and said to Halmalo,--\n\n\"You may take the rest.\"\n\nHalmalo put what remained of meat and biscuit in the bag, and hoisted\nit on his shoulder. Having done this, he said,--\n\n\"My lord, am I to lead the way, or to follow you?\"\n\n\"You will do neither.\"\n\nHalmalo looked at the old man in amazement.\n\nThe latter went on,--\n\n\"We are about to separate, Halmalo. Two men are of no use whatever.\nUnless they are a thousand, it is better for one man to be alone.\"\n\nHe stopped and pulled out of his pocket a knot of green silk resembling\na cockade; with a fleur-de-lis embroidered in gold in the centre.\n\n\"Can you read?\" he asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That is fortunate. A man who knows how to read is embarrassing. Have\nyou a good memory?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very well. Listen, Halmalo. You will follow the road on the right, and\nI the one on the left. You are to turn in the direction of Bazouges,\nand I shall go towards Foug\u00c3\u00a8res. Keep your bag, because it makes you\nlook like a peasant; hide your weapons; cut yourself a stick from the\nhedge; creep through the tall rye; glide behind the hedges; climb over\nfences and cross the fields: you will thus avoid the passers-by, as\nwell as roads and bridges. Do not enter Pontorson. Ah! you will have to\ncross the Couesnon. How will you manage that?\"\n\n\"I shall swim across.\"\n\n\"Excellent. Then you will come to a ford. Do you know where it is?\"\n\n\"Between Nancy and Vieux-Viel.\"\n\n\"Correct. You are evidently familiar with the country.\"\n\n\"But night is coming on. Where will my lord sleep?\"\n\n\"I can take care of myself. And where will you sleep?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of _\u00c3\u00a9mousses._ I was a peasant before I was a sailor.\"\n\n\"Throw away your sailor hat; it would betray you. You can surely find\nsome worsted head-covering.\"\n\n\"Oh, a cap is easily found. The first fisherman I meet will sell me\nhis.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now listen. You are familiar with the woods?\"\n\n\"All of them.\"\n\n\"Throughout this entire neighborhood?\"\n\n\"From Noirmoutier to Laval.\"\n\n\"Do you know their names too?\"\n\n\"I know the woods and their names; I know all about them.\"\n\n\"You will forget nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Good. Now mind. How many leagues can you walk in a day?\"\n\n\"Ten, fifteen, eighteen, twenty, if need be.\"\n\n\"It will have to be done. Do not miss a word of what I am about to tell\nyou. You will go to the woods of Saint-Aubin.\"\n\n\"Near Lamballe?\"\n\n\"Yes. On the edge of a ravine between Saint-Rieul and Pl\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9liac there\nis a large chestnut-tree. You will stop there. No one will be in sight.\"\n\n\"But a man will be there nevertheless. On that I can depend.\"\n\n\"You will give the call. Do you know it?\"\n\nHalmalo puffed out his cheeks, turned towards the sea, and there rang\nthe \"to-whit-to-hoo\" of the owl.\n\nOne would have supposed it came from the depths of a forest, so\nowl-like and sinister was the sound.\n\n\"Good!\" said the old man. \"You have it.\"\n\nHe extended to Halmalo the green silk knot.\n\n\"This is my commander's badge. Take it. No one must know my name at\npresent; but this knot is sufficient. The fleur-de-lis was embroidered\nby Madame Royale in the Temple prison.\"\n\nHalmalo knelt. Trembling with awe he received the knot embroidered with\nthe fleur-de-lis, and in the act of raising it to his lips, he paused\nas if in fear.\n\n\"May I?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, since you kiss the crucifix.\"\n\nHalmalo kissed the fleur-de-lis.\n\n\"Rise,\" said the old man.\n\nHalmalo obeyed him, placing the knot in his bosom.\n\n\"Listen carefully to what I am about to say. This is the order:\n'Revolt! Give no quarter.' On the edge of the forest of Saint-Aubin you\nwill give the call, repeating it three times. After the third time you\nwill see a man rise from the ground.\"\n\n\"I know, from a hole under the trees.\"\n\n\"That man will be Planchenault, sometimes called Coeur-de-Roi. To him\nyou will show this knot. He will know what it means. Then you are\nto go by ways that you must discover for yourself to the woods of\nAstill\u00c3\u00a9, where you will see a cripple surnamed Mousqueton, a man who\nshows mercy to no human being. You are to tell him that I love him,\nand that he must stir up the parishes in his neighborhood. Thence you\nwill go to the wood of Couesbon, which is one mile from Plo\u00c3\u00abrmel.\nWhen you give the owl-cry, a man will come out of a hole; that will\nbe M. Thuault, seneschal of Plo\u00c3\u00abrmel, who formerly belonged to the\nConstitutional Assembly, but on the royalist side. You will direct\nhim to fortify the castle of Couesbon, that belongs to the Marquis de\nGuer, a refugee. Ravines, woods of moderate extent, uneven soil, a good\nspot. M. Thuault is an able and upright man. From there you will go to\nSaint-Guen-les-Toits, and speak to Jean Chouan, whom I look upon as the\nactual leader, and then to the woods of Ville-Anglose, where you will\nsee Guitter, called Saint-Martin; you will tell him to keep his eye on\na certain Courmesnil, son-in-law of the old Goupil de Pr\u00c3\u00a9feln, and who\nis the head of the Jacobins of Argentan. Remember all this. I write\nnothing, because writing must be avoided. La Rouarie made out a list,\nwhich ruined everything. Thence you will go to the wood of Rougefeu,\nwhere Mi\u00c3\u00a9lette lives, he who leaps across ravines by the help of a long\npole.\"\n\n\"They call it a leaping-pole.\"\n\n\"Do you know how to use it?\"\n\n\"Am I not a Breton peasant? The leaping-pole is our friend. It makes\nour arms bigger, our legs longer.\"\n\n\"That is to say, it reduces the enemy and shortens the way. An\nexcellent machine.\"\n\n[Illustration 024]\n\n\"Once, with my leaping-pole, I stood my ground against three salt-tax\nmen armed with sabres.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"Ten years ago.\"\n\n\"Under the king?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Against whom?\"\n\n\"I really do not know. I was a salt-smuggler.\"\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\n\"It was called fighting against the collectors of the salt-tax. Is the\ntax on salt the same thing as the king?\"\n\n\"Yes, and no. But it is not necessary for you to understand this.\"\n\n\"I ask monseigneur's pardon for having put a question to monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Let us go on. Do you know the Tourgue?\"\n\n\"Do I know it! I came from there.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Why, because I come from Parign\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"To be sure, the Tourgue borders on Parign\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Do I know the Tourgue! The great round castle belongs to the family\nof my lords. A large iron door separates the old building from the new\npart, which a cannon could not destroy. In the new building they keep\nthe famous book on Saint-Barth\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9my, which people come to see as a\ncuriosity. The grass is full of frogs. When I was a boy I used to play\nwith those frogs. And the underground passage, too. Perhaps I am the\nonly one left who knows about that.\"\n\n\"What underground passage? I don't know what you are talking about.\"\n\n\"That was in old times, when the Tourgue was besieged. The people\ninside could escape through an underground passage which opened into\nthe woods.\"\n\n\"I know there are subterranean passages of that kind in the ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux of\nJupelli\u00c3\u00a8re and Hunaudaye, and in the tower of Champ\u00c3\u00a9on; but there is\nnothing like it in the Tourgue.\"\n\n\"But indeed there is, monseigneur. I do not know the passages of which\nmonseigneur speaks; I only know the one in the Tourgue because I belong\nin the neighborhood; and besides, I am the only one who does know of\nit. It was never spoken of. It was forbidden, because this passage had\nbeen used in the wars of M. de Rohan. My father knew the secret and\nshowed it to me. I know both the secret entrance and the outlet. If I\nam in the forest I can go into the tower; and if I am in the tower I\ncan go into the forest without being seen, so that when the enemies\nenter there is no one to be found. That is the passage of the Tourgue.\nOh, I know it well.\"\n\nThe old man remained silent for a moment.\n\n\"You must be mistaken. If there had been any such secret I should have\nknown it.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I am sure of it. There is a stone that turns.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! You peasants believe in turning-stones, in singing-stones,\nand in stones that go by night down to a neighboring brook to drink. A\npack of idle tales!\"\n\n\"But when I turned the stone myself--\"\n\n\"Yes, just as others have heard it sing. My friend, the Tourgue is\na Bastille, safe and strong, and easily defended; but he would be a\nsimpleton indeed who depended for escape on a subterranean passage.\"\n\n\"But, monseigneur--\"\n\nThe old man shrugged his shoulders,--\n\n\"Let us waste no more time, but speak of business.\"\n\nThis peremptory tone checked Halmalo's persistence.\n\nThe old man resumed:--\n\n\"Let us go on. Listen. From Rougefeu you are to go into the wood of\nMontchevrier, where you will find B\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9dicit\u00c3\u00a9, the leader of the Twelve.\nHe is another good man. He recites his _B\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9dicite_ while he has people\nshot. There is no room for sensibility in warfare. From Montchevrier\nyou will go--\"\n\nHe broke off.\n\n\"I had forgotten about the money.\"\n\nHe took from his pocket a purse and a pocket-book, which he put into\nHalmalo's hands.\n\n\"In this pocket-book you will find thirty thousand francs in paper\nmoney, which is worth about three livres and ten sous. The assignats\nare false, to be sure, but the real ones are no more valuable; and in\nthis purse, mind, you will find one hundred louis d'ors. I give you all\nI have, because I have no need of anything here, and it is better that\nno money should be found on me. Now I will go on. From Montchevrier you\nare to go to Antrain, where you will meet M. de Frott\u00c3\u00a9; from Antrain\nto Jupelli\u00c3\u00a8re, where you Will see M. de Rochecotte; from Jupelli\u00c3\u00a8re to\nNoirieux, where you will find the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Baudoin. Will you remember all\nthis?\"\n\n\"As I do my Pater Noster.\"\n\n\"You will see M. Dubois-Guy at Saint-Brice-en-Cogle, M. de Turpin\nat Morannes, which is a fortified town, and the Prince de Talmont at\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teau-Gonthier.\"\n\n\"Will a prince speak to me?\"\n\n\"Am I not speaking to you?\"\n\nHalmalo took off his hat.\n\n\"You need but to show Madam's fleur-de-lis, and your welcome is\nassured. Remember that you will have to go to places where there are\nmountaineers and _patauds._[1] You will disguise yourself. That is\nan easy matter, since the republicans are so stupid that with a blue\ncoat, a three-cornered hat, and a cockade, you may go anywhere. The\nday of regiments and uniforms has gone by; the regiments are not even\nnumbered, and every man is at liberty to wear any rag he fancies. You\nwill go to Saint-Mherv\u00c3\u00a9. You will see Gaulier, called Grand-Pierre.\nYou will go to the cantonment of Parn\u00c3\u00a9, where all the men have swarthy\nfaces. They put gravel in their muskets and use a double charge of\npowder to make more noise. They do well; but be sure and tell them\nto kill, kill, and kill. You will go to the camp of the Vache-Noire,\nwhich is an elevation in the midst of the forest of La Charnie, from\nVache-Noire to the camp of l'Avoine, then to the camp Vert, and\nafterwards to the camp of the Fourmis. You will go to Grand-Bordage,\nalso called Haut-du-Pr\u00c3\u00a9, where lives the widow whose daughter married\nTreton the Englishman; that is in the parish of Quelaines. You will\nvisit \u00c3\u0089pineux-le-Chevreuil, Sill\u00c3\u00a9-le-Guillaume, Guillaume, Parannes,\nand all the men in hiding throughout the woods. You will make friends\nand you will send them to the borders of upper and lower Maine; you\nwill see Jean Treton in the parish of Vaisges, Sans-Regret in Bignon,\nChambord in Bonchamps, the Corbin brothers at Maisoncelles, and\nPetit-Sans-Peur at Saint-Jean-sur-Evre. He is the one who is called\nBourdoiseau. Having done this, and uttered the watchwords, 'Revolt!'\n'No quarter!' in all these places, you will join the royal and catholic\ngrand army, wherever it may be. You will see d'Elb\u00c3\u00a9e, de Lescure, de\nla Rochejaquelein, and such leaders as may still be living. You will\nshow them my commander's knot. They know what it means. You are only a\nsailor, but Cathelineau is nothing but a teamster. You will give them\nthis message from me: It is time to join the two wars, the great and\nthe small. The great one makes more noise, but the small one does the\nwork. The Vend\u00c3\u00a9e does fairly well, but Chouannerie goes farther, and in\ncivil war cruelty is a powerful agent. The success of a war depends on\nthe amount of evil that it causes.\"\n\nHe broke off.\n\n\"Halmalo, I tell you all this, not that you can understand the words,\nbut because your perceptions are keen, and you will comprehend the\nmatters themselves. I have trusted you since I saw you managing that\nboat. Without knowing anything of geometry you execute wonderful sea\nmanoeuvres. He who can pilot a boat can guide an insurrection. Judging\nfrom the way in which you managed our affair at sea, I feel sure that\nyou will execute my instructions equally well. But to resume: So you\nwill repeat to the chiefs all that I have told you, or words to the\nsame effect, as near as you can remember; I am confident that you\nwill convey to them my meaning. I prefer the warfare of the forest to\nthat of the open field. I have no intention of exposing one hundred\nthousand peasants to the grape-shot of the soldiers in blue and the\nartillery of M. Carnot. In a month's time I expect to have five hundred\nsharp-shooters hidden in the woods. The republican army is my game.\nPoaching is one method of warfare. The strategy of the thickets for me!\nAh, that is probably another word which you will not understand; but\nnever mind,--you know what I mean when I say, No quarter! and ambushes\non every side! Give me more Chouannerie rather than the regular Vendean\nwarfare. You will add that the English are on our side. Let us catch\nthe republic between two fires. Europe helps us: let us put down\nrevolution. Kings are waging a war of kingdoms: we will wage a war of\nparishes. You will say all this. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes: put all to fire and sword.\"\n\n\"That is it,\"\n\n\"No quarter.\"\n\n\"None whatever. You understand?\"\n\n\"I will go everywhere.\"\n\n\"And be always on your guard; for in these parts it is an easy matter\nto lose one's life.\"\n\n\"Death I have no fear of. He who takes his first step may be wearing\nhis last shoes.\"\n\n\"You are a brave fellow.\"\n\n\"And if I am asked monseigneur's name?\"\n\n\"It is not to be made known yet. You are to say that you do not know\nit, and you will say the truth.\"\n\n\"Where shall I see monseigneur again?\"\n\n\"At the place where I am going.\"\n\n\"How shall I know where that is?\"\n\n\"All the world will know it. Before eight days have gone by you\nwill hear of me. I shall make examples; I shall avenge the king and\nreligion; and you will know well enough that it is I of whom they are\nspeaking.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"Do not forget anything.\"\n\n\"You may rest assured of that.\"\n\n\"Now go, and may God guide you! Go!\"\n\n\"I will do all you bid me. I will go; I will speak; I will obey; I will\ncommand.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"And if I succeed--\"\n\n\"I will make you a knight of Saint-Louis.\"\n\n\"Like my brother. And if I fail, you will have me shot?\"\n\n\"Like your brother.\"\n\n\"So be it, monseigneur.\"\n\nThe old man bent his head, and seemed to fall into a gloomy reverie.\nWhen he raised his eyes he was alone. Halmalo was only a black speck\nvanishing on the horizon.\n\nThe sun had just set; the sea-mews and hooded gulls were flying\nhomeward from the ocean, and the atmosphere was charged with that\nwell-known restlessness that precedes the night; the tree-frogs\ncroaked, the kingfishers flew whistling from the pools, the gulls and\nrooks kept up their usual evening clamor, and the shore-birds called\nto each other, but not a human sound was to be heard. It was absolute\nsolitude,--not a sail on the bay, not a peasant in the fields; only a\nbleak expanse as far as the eye could reach. The tall sand-thistles\nquivered; the pale twilight sky shed a livid light over all the shore;\nand the ponds far away on the dark plain looked like sheets of pewter\nlaid flat upon the ground. A sea-wind was blowing.\n\n[Illustration 025]\n\n[Footnote 1: A name given by the Chouans to the republicans, a\ncorruption of patriot.--TR.]\n\n[Illustration: Tellmarch 026]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV.\n\n\nTELLMARCH.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nON THE TOP OF THE DUNE.\n\n\n[Illustration 027]\n\n\nThe old man waited until Halmalo was out of sight; then drawing his\nsea-cloak more closely around him, he started walking slowly, wrapt in\nthought. He took the direction of Huisnes; Halmalo had gone towards\nBeauvoir.\n\nBehind him rose the enormous triangle of Mont Saint-Michel, with its\ncathedral tiara and its cuirass-like fortress, whose two great eastern\ntowers--the one round, the other square--help the mountain to bear\nup under the burden of the church and the village. As the pyramid of\nCheops is a landmark in the desert, so is Mont-Saint Michel a beacon to\nthe sea.\n\nThe quicksands in the bay of Mont Saint-Michel act imperceptibly\nupon the dunes. At that time between Huisnes and Ardevon there was a\nvery high one, which is no longer in existence. This dune, levelled\nby an equinoctial gale, was unusually old, and on its summit stood a\nmilestone, erected in the twelfth century in memory of the council held\nat Avranches against the assassins of Saint Thomas of Canterbury. From\nits top one could see all the surrounding country, and ascertain the\npoints of the compass.\n\nThe old man directed his steps to this dune, and ascended it.\n\nWhen he reached the summit, he seated himself on one of the four\nprojecting stones, and leaning back against the monument, began to\nexamine the land that lay spread out like a geographical map at his\nfeet. He seemed to be looking for a route in a country that had\nonce been familiar to him. In this broad landscape, obscured by the\ntwilight, nothing was distinctly visible but the dark line of the\nhorizon against the pale sky.\n\nOne could see the clustered roofs of eleven hamlets and villages; and\nall the belfries of the coast were visible several miles away, standing\nhigh that they might serve as beacons to the sailors in time of need.\n\nSome minutes later the old man seemed to have found what he was looking\nfor in this dim light; his eye rested on an enclosure of trees, walls,\nand roofs, partially visible between the valley and the wood: it was a\nfarm. He nodded his head with an expression of satisfaction, like one\nwho says to himself, \"There it is!\" and began to trace with his finger\nthe outlines of a route across the hedges and the fields. From time to\ntime he gazed intently at a shapeless and somewhat indistinct object\nthat was moving above the principal roof of the farm, and seemed to ask\nhimself what it could be. It was colorless and dim, in consequence of\nthe time of day. It was not a weather-vane, because it was floating;\nand there seemed to be no reason why it should be a flag.\n\nHe felt weary; and grateful to rest on the stone where he was sitting,\nhe yielded to that vague sense of oblivion which the first moment of\nrepose brings to weary men. There is one hour of the day which may\nbe called noiseless,--the peaceful hour of early evening; that hour\nhad come, and he was enjoying it. He gazed, he listened. To what?\nTo perfect tranquillity. Even savage natures have their moments of\nmelancholy. Suddenly this tranquillity was--not exactly disturbed, but\nsharply defined by the voices of those who were passing below. They\nwere the voices of women and children. It was like a joyous chime of\nbells heard unexpectedly in the darkness. The group from which the\nvoices came could not be distinguished, on account of the underbrush;\nbut it was evident that the persons were walking along the foot of the\ndune, in the direction of the plain and the forest. As those clear,\nfresh voices reached the old man where he sat absorbed in thought, they\nwere so near that he lost not a word.\n\nA woman's voice said,--\n\n\"Let us hurry, Fl\u00c3\u00a9charde. Is this the way?\"\n\n\"No; it is over yonder.\"\n\nAnd the dialogue went on between the two voices, the one high and\nshrill, the other low and timid.\n\n\"What is the name of this farm where we are living now?\"\n\n\"Herbe-en-Pail.\"\n\n\"Are we still far from it?\"\n\n\"Fully a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Let us make haste and get there in time for the soup.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know we are late.\"\n\n\"We ought to run; but your mites are tired. We are only two women, and\ncannot carry three brats. And then, you, Fl\u00c3\u00a9charde, you are carrying\none as it is,--a perfect lump of lead. You have weaned that little\ngormandizer, and you still carry it. That is a bad habit; you had\nbetter make it walk. Well, the soup will be cold,--worse luck!\"\n\n\"Ah, what good shoes you gave me! They fit as though they were made for\nme.\"\n\n\"It's better than going barefooted.\"\n\n\"Do hurry, Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\"\n\n\"He is the one who makes us late; he has had to stop and speak to all\nthe little village girls that we meet He behaves like a man already.\"\n\n\"Of course he does; he is going on five years old.\"\n\n\"Tell us, Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, why did you speak to that little girl in the\nvillage?\"\n\nA child's voice, that of a boy, replied,--\n\n\"Because I know her.\"\n\n\"How is that? You know her?\" said the woman.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the boy; \"because we played games this morning.\"\n\n[Illustration 028]\n\n\"Well, I must say!\" exclaimed the woman. \"We have been here only three\ndays; a boy no bigger than your fist, and he has found a sweetheart\nalready!\"\n\nAnd the voices grew fainter in the distance, and every sound died away.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAURES HABET, ET NON AUDIET.\n\n\nThe old man sat motionless. He was not consciously thinking, nor yet\nwas he dreaming. Around him was peace, repose, assurance of safety,\nsolitude. Although night had shut down upon the woods, and in the\nvalley below it was nearly dark, broad daylight still rested on the\ndune. The moon was rising in the east, and several stars pricked the\npale blue of the zenith. This man, although intensely absorbed in his\nown interests, surrendered himself to the unutterable peacefulness of\nnature. He felt the vague dawn of hope rising in his breast,--if the\nword \"hope\" may fitly be applied to projects of civil warfare. For the\nmoment it seemed to him that in escaping from the inexorable sea he had\nleft all danger behind him. No one knew his name; he was alone,--lost,\nas far as concerned the enemy; he had left no traces behind him, for\nthe surface of the sea preserves no trace; all is hidden, ignored, and\nnever even suspected. He felt unspeakably calm. A little more, and he\nwould have fallen asleep.\n\nIt was the deep silence pervading both heaven and earth that lent to\nthe hour a subtle charm to soothe the imagination of this man, stirred\nas he was by inward and outward agitations.\n\nThere was nothing to be heard but the wind blowing in from the sea, a\nprolonged monotonous bass, to which the ear becomes so used that it\nalmost ceases to be noticed as a sound.\n\nAll at once he rose to his feet\n\nHis attention was suddenly awakened. An object on the horizon seemed to\narrest his glance.\n\nHe was gazing at the belfry of Cormeray, at the farther end of the\nvalley. Something unusual was going on in this belfry.\n\nIts dark silhouette was clearly defined against the sky; the tower\nsurmounted by the spire could be seen distinctly, and between the tower\nand the spire was the square cage for the bell, without a penthouse,\nand open on the four sides, after the fashion of Breton belfries. Now\nthis cage seemed to open and shut by turns, and at regular intervals;\nits lofty aperture looked now perfectly white, and the next moment\nblack, the sky constantly appearing and vanishing, eclipse following\nthe light, as the opening and shutting succeeded each other with the\nregularity of a hammer striking an anvil.\n\nThis belfry of Cormeray lay before him at a distance of some two\nleagues. He looked towards the right in the direction of the belfry\nof Baguer-Pican, which also rose straight against the horizon, and\nthe cage of that belfry was opening and closing like the belfry of\nCormeray. He looked towards the left at the belfry of Tanis; the cage\nof Tanis opened and closed like that of Baguer-Pican. He examined\nall the belfries on the horizon, one after another,--the belfries of\nCourtils, of Pr\u00c3\u00a9cey, of Crollon, and of Croix-Avranchin on his right\nhand, those of Raz-sur-Couesnon, of Mordray, and of the Pas on his\nleft, and before him the belfry of Pontorson. Every belfry cage was\nchanging alternately from white to black.\n\nWhat could it mean?\n\nIt meant that all the bells were ringing, and they must be ringing\nviolently to cause the light to change so rapidly.\n\nWhat was it, then? The tocsin, beyond a doubt. They were ringing, and\nfrantically too, from all the belfries, in every parish, and in every\nvillage, and yet not a sound could be heard.\n\nThis was owing to the distance, combined with the sea-wind, which,\nblowing from the opposite direction, carried all sounds from the shore\naway beyond the horizon.\n\nAll these frantic bells ringing on every side, and at the same time\nthis silence; what could be more appalling?\n\nThe old man looked and listened.\n\nHe could not hear the tocsin, but he could see it. Seeing the tocsin is\nrather a strange sensation.\n\nAgainst whom was this fury directed?\n\nAgainst whom was the tocsin ringing?\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTHE USEFULNESS OF BIG LETTERS.\n\n\nSome one was surely caught in a trap.\n\nWho could it be?\n\nA shudder shook this man of steel.\n\nIt could not be he. His arrival could not have been discovered. It was\nimpossible for the representatives to have learned it already, for he\nhad but just stepped on shore. The corvette had surely foundered with\nall on board; and even on the corvette Boisberthelot and La Vieuville\nwere the only men who knew his name.\n\nThe bells kept up their savage sport. He counted them mechanically,\nand in the abrupt transition from the assurance of perfect safety to\na terrible sense of danger, his thoughts wandered restlessly from\none conjecture to another. However, after all, this ringing might be\naccounted for in many different ways, and he finally reassured himself\nby repeating, \"In short, no one knows of my arrival here, or even my\nname.\"\n\nFor several minutes there had been a slight noise overhead and behind\nhim,--a sound resembling the rustling of a leaf; at first he took no\nnotice of it, but as it continued, persisted, one might almost say, he\nfinally turned. It was really a leaf,--a leaf of paper. The wind was\nstruggling to tear off a large placard that was pasted on the milestone\nabove his head. The placard had but just been pasted; for it was still\nmoist, and had become a prey to the wind, which in its sport had partly\ndetached it.\n\nThe old man had not perceived it, because he had ascended the dune on\nthe opposite side.\n\nHe stepped up on the stone where he had been sitting, and placed his\nhand on the corner of the placard that fluttered in the wind. The sky\nwas clear; in June the twilight lasts a long time, and although it was\ndark at the foot of the dune, the summit was still light. A part of the\nnotice was printed in large letters; it was yet sufficiently light to\nread it, and this was what he read:--\n\n      THE FRENCH REPUBLIC, ONE AND INDIVISIBLE.\n\n      We, Prieur of the Marne, representative of the people,\n      in command of the army on the coast of Cherbourg, give\n      notice, That the ci-devant Marquis of Lantenac, Viscount\n      of Fontenay, calling himself a Breton prince, and who has\n      secretly landed on the coast of Granville, is outlawed.\n      A price has been set upon his head. Whoever captures him\n      dead or alive will receive sixty thousand livres. This sum\n      will be paid in gold, and not in paper money. A battalion\n      of the army of the coast guards of Cherbourg will be at\n      once despatched for the apprehension of the former Marquis\n      of Lantenac. The inhabitants of the parishes are ordered\n      to lend their aid.\n\n      Given at the Town Hall of Granville the second of June,\n      1793.\n\n      Signed: PRIEUR, DE LA MARNE.\n\nBelow this name there was another signature written in smaller\ncharacters, which the fading light prevented him from deciphering.\nPulling his hat down over his eyes, and muffling himself in his\nsea-cape up to his chin, the old man hastily descended the dune.\nEvidently it was not safe to tarry any longer on this lighted summit.\n\nPerhaps he had stayed there too long already. The top of the dune was\nthe only point of the landscape that still remained visible.\n\nWhen he had descended and found himself in the darkness he slackened\nhis pace.\n\nHe took the road leading to the farm which he had traced out, evidently\nbelieving himself safe in that direction. It was absolute solitude.\nThere were no passers-by at this hour.\n\nStopping behind a clump of bushes, he unfastened his cloak, turned his\nwaistcoat with the hairy side out, refastened his cloak, that was but a\nrag held by a string around his neck, and resumed his journey.\n\nIt was bright moonlight.\n\nHe came to a place where two roads forked, and on the pedestal\nof the old stone cross which stood there a white square could be\ndistinguished,--undoubtedly another placard like the one he had lately\nread. As he drew near to it he heard a voice.\n\n[Illustration 029]\n\n\"Where are you going?\" it said; and turning he beheld a man in the\nhedge-row, tall like himself, and of about the same age, with hair as\nwhite and garments even more ragged than his own,--almost his very\ndouble.\n\nThe man stood leaning on a long staff.\n\n\"I asked you where you were going? he repeated.\n\n\"In the first place, tell me where I am,\" was the reply, uttered in\ntones of almost haughty composure.\n\nAnd the man answered,--\n\n\"You are in the seigneury of Tanis, of which I am the beggar and you\nthe lord.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you,--monsieur le marquis de Lantenac.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\nTHE CAIMAND.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac (henceforth we shall call him by his name)\nreplied gravely,--\n\n\"Very well. Then deliver me up.\"\n\nThe man continued,--\n\n\"We are both at home here,--you in the castle, I in the bushes.\"\n\n\"Let us put an end to this. Do what you have to do. Deliver me to the\nauthorities,\" said the Marquis.\n\nThe man went on,--\n\n\"You were going to the farm Herbe-en-Pail, were you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Don't go there.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because the Blues are there.\"\n\n\"How long have they been there?\"\n\n\"These three days past.\"\n\n\"Did the inhabitants of the farm and village resist?\"\n\n\"No; they opened all the doors.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Marquis.\n\nThe man indicated with his finger the roof of the farm, which was\nvisible in the distance above the trees.\n\n\"Do you see that roof, Marquis?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you see what there is above it?\"\n\n\"Something waving?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is a flag.\"\n\n\"The tricolor,\" said the man.\n\nIt was the object that had attracted the attention of the Marquis when\nhe stood on the top of the dune.\n\n\"Isn't the tocsin ringing?\" inquired the Marquis.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"On what account?\"\n\n\"Evidently on yours.\"\n\n\"But one cannot hear it?\"\n\n\"The wind prevents it from being heard.\"\n\nThe man continued,--\n\n\"Did you see that notice about yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They are searching for you.\"\n\nThen glancing towards the farm, he added,--\n\n\"They have a demi-battalion over there.\"\n\n\"Of republicans?\"\n\n\"Of Parisians.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Marquis, \"let us go on.\"\n\nAnd he made a step in the direction of the farm. The man seized him by\nthe arm.\n\n\"Don't go there!\"\n\n\"Where would you have me go?\"\n\n\"With me.\"\n\nThe Marquis looked at the beggar.\n\n\"Listen to me, Marquis: My home is not a fine one, but it is safe,--a\nhut lower than a cellar, seaweed for a floor, and for a ceiling a roof\nof branches and of grass. Come. They would shoot you at the farm,\nand at my house you will have a chance to sleep; you must be weary.\nTo-morrow the Blues start out again, and you can go where you choose.\"\n\nThe Marquis studied the man.\n\n\"On which side are you, then?\" asked the Marquis. \"Are you a royalist,\nor a republican?\"\n\n\"I am a beggar.\"\n\n\"Neither royalist nor republican?\"\n\n\"I believe not.\"\n\n\"Are you for or against the king?\"\n\n\"I have no time for that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"What do you think of what is transpiring?\"\n\n\"I think that I have not enough to live on.\"\n\n\"Yet you come to my aid.\"\n\n\"I knew that you were outlawed. What is this law, then, that one can be\noutside of it? I do not understand. Am I inside the law, or outside of\nit? I have no idea. Does dying of hunger mean being inside the law?\"\n\n\"How long have you been dying of hunger?\"\n\n\"All my life.\"\n\n\"And you propose to save me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I said to myself, 'There is a man who is poorer than I, for he\nhas not even the right to breathe.'\"\n\n\"True. And so you mean to save me?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Now we are brothers, my lord,--beggars both; I for bread,\nand you for life.\"\n\n\"But do you know there is a price set on my head?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How did you know it?\"\n\n\"I have read the notice.\"\n\n\"Then you can read?\"\n\n\"Yes, and write also. Did you think I was like the beasts of the field?\"\n\n\"But since you can read, and have seen the notice, you must know that\nhe who delivers me up will receive sixty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"Not in assignats.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,--in gold.\"\n\n\"You realize that sixty thousand francs is a fortune?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that the man who arrests me will make his fortune?\"\n\n\"Yes; and what then?\"\n\n\"His fortune!\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I thought. When I saw you, I said to myself, 'To\nthink that whoever arrests this man will earn sixty thousand francs,\nand make his fortune! Let us make haste to hide him.'\"\n\nThe Marquis followed the beggar.\n\nThey entered a thicket. There was the beggar's den, a sort of chamber\nin which a large and ancient oak had allowed the man to take up his\nabode; it was hollowed out under its roots, and covered with its\nbranches,--dark, low, hidden, actually invisible,--and in it there was\nroom for two.\n\n\"I foresaw that I might have a guest,\" said the beggar.\n\nThis kind of subterranean lodging, less rare in Brittany than one\nmight imagine, is called a _carnichot._ The same name is also given to\nhiding-places built in thick walls. The place was furnished with a few\njugs, a bed of straw or sea-weed, washed and dried, a coarse kersey\nblanket, and a few tallow dips, together with a flint and steel, and\ntwigs of furze to be used as matches.\n\nThey stooped, crawling for a moment, and penetrated into a chamber\ndivided by the thick roots of the tree into fantastic compartments, and\nseated themselves on the heap of dry sea-weed that served as a bed. The\nspace between the two roots through which they had entered, and which\nserved as a door, admitted a certain amount of light. Night had fallen;\nbut the human eye adapts itself to the change of light, and even in\nthe darkness it sometimes seems as if the daylight lingered still. The\nreflection of a moonbeam illumined the entrance. In the corner was a\njug of water, a loaf of buckwheat bread, and some chestnuts.\n\n\"Let us sup,\" said the beggar.\n\nThey divided the chestnuts; the Marquis gave his bit of hard-tack; they\nate of the same black loaf, and drank in turn out of the same jug of\nwater, meanwhile conversing.\n\n[Illustration 030]\n\nThe Marquis questioned the man.\n\n\"So it is all one to you, whatever happens?\"\n\n\"Pretty much. It is for you who are lords to look out for that sort of\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"But then, what is going on now, for instance--\"\n\n\"It is all going on over my head.\"\n\nThe beggar added,--\n\n\"Besides, there are things happening still higher; the sun rises, the\nmoon waxes and wanes. That is the kind of thing that interests me.\"\n\nHe took a swallow from the jug and said,--\n\n\"Good fresh water!\"\n\nThen he continued,--\n\n\"How do you like this water, my lord?\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" asked the Marquis.\n\n\"My name is Tellmarch, but they call me the Caimand.\"\n\n\"I understand. _Caimand_ is a local word.\"\n\n\"Which means beggar. I am also called Le Vieux.\"\n\nHe went on,--\n\n\"I have been called Le Vieux for forty years.\"\n\n\"Forty years! But you must have been young then!\"\n\n\"I was never young. You are young still, Marquis. You have the legs\nof a man of twenty; you can climb the great dune, while I can hardly\nwalk. A quarter of a mile tires me out. Yet we are of the same age;\nbut the rich have an advantage over us,--they eat every day. Eating\nkeeps up one's strength.\"\n\nAfter a silence the beggar went on:--\n\n\"Wealth and poverty,--there's the mischief; it seems to me that that is\nthe cause of all these catastrophes. The poor want to be rich, and the\nrich do not want to become poor. I think that is at the bottom of it\nall, but I do not trouble myself about such matters; let come what may,\nI am neither for the creditor nor for the debtor. I know that there is\na debt, and somebody is paying it; that is all. I would rather they had\nnot killed the king, and yet I hardly know why. And then one says to\nme, 'Think how they used to hang people for nothing at all! Think of\nit! For a miserable shot fired at one of the king's deer, I once saw a\nman hung: he had a wife and seven children.' There is something to be\nsaid on both sides.\"\n\nHe was silent again, then resumed:--\n\n\"Of course you understand. I do not pretend to know just how matters\nstand; men go to and fro, changes take place, while I live beneath the\nstars.\"\n\nAgain Tellmarch became thoughtful, then went on:--\n\n\"I know something of bone-setting and medicine. I am familiar with\nherbs and the use of plants; the peasants see me preoccupied for no\napparent reason, and so I pass for a wizard. Because I dream, they\nthink that I am wise.\"\n\n\"Do you belong to the neighborhood?\" asked the Marquis.\n\n\"I have never left it.\"\n\n\"Do you know me?\"\n\n\"Certainly. The last time I saw you, you were passing through this part\nof the country on your way to England; that was two years ago. Just\nnow I saw a man on the top of the dune,--a tall man. Tall men are not\ncommon hereabouts; Brittany is a country of short men. I looked more\nclosely; I had read the notice, and I said to myself, 'See here!' And\nwhen you came down, the moon was up and I recognized you.\"\n\n\"But I do not know you,\"\n\n\"You have looked at me, but you never saw me.\" And Tellmarch the\nCaimand added,--\n\n\"I saw you. The passer-by and the beggar look with different eyes.\"\n\n\"Have I ever met you before?\"\n\n\"Often, for I am your beggar. I used to beg on the road, below your\ncastle. Sometimes you gave me alms; he who gives takes no notice, but\nhe who receives looks anxiously and observes well. A beggar is a born\nspy. But though I am often sad, I try not to be a malicious spy. I used\nto hold out my hand, and you saw nothing but that, into which you threw\nthe alms that I needed in the morning to keep me from dying of hunger\nat night. Frequently I went twenty-four hours without food. Sometimes a\npenny means life itself. I am paying you now for the life I owe you.\"\n\n\"True, you are saving my life.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am saving your life, monseigneur.\"\n\nThe voice of Tellmarch grew solemn:--\n\n\"On one condition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That you have not come here to do harm.\"\n\n\"I have come here to do good.\"\n\n\"Let us sleep,\" said the beggar.\n\nThey lay down side by side on the bed of sea-weed. The beggar dropped\nto sleep at once. The Marquis, although much fatigued, remained awake\nfor some time, thinking and watching his companion in the darkness;\nfinally he lay back. Lying upon the bed was equivalent to lying on the\nearth, and he took advantage of this to put his ear to the ground and\nlisten. He could hear a hollow subterranean rumbling. It is a fact that\nsound is transmitted into the bowels of the earth; he could hear the\nringing of the bells.\n\nThe tocsin continued.\n\nThe Marquis fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nWHEN HE AWOKE IT WAS DAYLIGHT.\n\n\nThe beggar was standing up,--not in his den, for it was impossible to\nstand erect there, but outside on the threshold. He was leaning on his\nstaff, and the sunshine fell upon his face.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Tellmarch, \"it has just struck four from the\nbelfry of Tanis. I heard it strike,--therefore the wind has changed; it\ncomes from the land, and as I heard no other sound the tocsin must have\nceased. All is quiet at the farm and in the village of Herbe-en-Pail.\nThe Blues are either sleeping or gone. The worst of the danger is over;\nit will be prudent for us to separate. This is my time for going out.\"\n\nHe indicated a point in the horizon.\n\n\"I am going this way;\" then pointing in the opposite direction, he\nsaid,--\n\n\"You are to go that way.\"\n\nThe beggar gravely waved his hand to the Marquis.\n\n\"Take those chestnuts with you, if you are hungry,\" he added, pointing\nto the remains of the supper.\n\nA moment after he had disappeared among the trees.\n\nThe Marquis rose and went in the direction indicated by Tellmarch.\n\nIt was that charming hour called in the old Norman peasant dialect the\n\"peep of day.\" The chirping of the finches and of the hedge-sparrows\nwas heard. The Marquis followed the path that they had traversed\nthe day before, and as he emerged from the thicket he found himself\nat the fork of the roads marked by the stone cross. The placard was\nstill there, looking white and almost festive in the rising sun. He\nremembered that there was something at the foot of this notice that he\nhad not been able to read the evening before, on account of the small\ncharacters and the fading light. He went up to the pedestal of the\ncross. Below the signature \"Prieur, de la Marne,\" the notice ended\nwith the following lines in small characters:--\n\n      The identity of the ci-devant Marquis of Lantenac having\n      been established, he will be executed without delay.\n\n      Signed: GAUVAIN,\n\n      _Chief of Battalion in Command of Exploring Column._\n\n\"Gauvain!\" said the Marquis.\n\nHe paused, wrapt in deep thought, his eyes fixed on the placard.\n\n\"Gauvain!\" he repeated.\n\nHe started once more, turned, looked at the cross, came back, and read\nthe placard over again.\n\nThen he slowly walked away. Had any one been near, he might have heard\nhim mutter to himself in an undertone:--\n\n\"Gauvain!\"\n\nThe roofs of the farm on his left were not visible from the sunken\npaths through which he was stealing. He skirted a precipitous hill,\ncovered with blossoming furze, of the species known as the thorny\nfurze. This eminence was crowned by one of those points of land called\nin this district a _hure_,[1] and at its base the trees cut off the\nview at once. The foliage seemed bathed in light. All Nature felt the\ndeep joy of morning.\n\nSuddenly this landscape became terrible. It was like the explosion of\nan ambuscade. An indescribable tornado of wild cries and musket-shots\nfell upon these fields and woods all radiant with the morning light,\nand from the direction of the farm rose a dense smoke mingled with\nbright flames, as though the village and the farm were but a truss\nof burning straw. It was not only startling but awful,--this sudden\nchange from peace to wrath; like an explosion of hell in the very midst\nof dawn, a horror without transition. A fight was going on in the\ndirection of Herbe-en-Pail. The Marquis paused.\n\nNo man in a case like this could have helped feeling as he did;\ncuriosity is more powerful than fear. One must find out what is\ngoing on, even at the risk of life. He climbed the hill at the foot\nof which lay the sunken path. From there, although the chances were\nthat he would be discovered, he could at least see what was taking\nplace. In a few moments he stood on the _hure_ and looked about him.\nIn fact, there was both a fusillade and a fire. One could hear the\ncries and see the fire. The farm was evidently the centre of some\nmysterious catastrophe. What could it be? Was it attacked? And if so,\nby whom? Could it be a battle? Was it not more likely to be a military\nexecution? By the orders of a revolutionary decree the Blues frequently\npunished refractory farms and villages by setting them on fire. For\ninstance, every farm and hamlet which had neglected to fell the trees\nas prescribed by law, and had not opened roads in the thickets for the\npassage of republican cavalry, was burned. It was not long since the\nparish of Bourgon near Ern\u00c3\u00a9e had been thus punished. Was Herbe-en-Pail\na case in point? It was evident that none of those strategic openings\nordered by the decree had been cut, either in the thickets or in the\nenvirons of Tanis and Herbe-en-Pail. Was this the punishment thereof?\nHad an order been received by the advanced guard occupying the farm?\nDid not this advanced guard form a part of one of those exploring\ncolumns called _colonnes infernales_?\n\nThe eminence on which the Marquis had stationed himself was surrounded\non all sides by a wild and bristling thicket called the grove of\nHerbe-en-Pail; it was about as large as a forest, however, and extended\nto the farm, concealing, as all Breton thickets do, a network of\nravines, paths, and sunken roads,--labyrinths wherein the republican\narmies frequently went astray.\n\nThis execution, if execution it were, must have been a fierce one,\nfor it had been rapid. Like all brutal deeds, it had been done like a\nflash. The atrocity of civil war admits of these savage deeds. While\nthe Marquis, vainly conjecturing, and hesitating whether to descend or\nto remain, listened and watched, this crash of extermination ceased,\nor, to speak more accurately, vanished. The Marquis could see the\nfierce and jubilant troop as it scattered through the grove. There was\na dreadful rushing to and fro beneath the trees. From the farm they\nhad entered the woods. Drums beat an attack, but there was no more\nfiring. It was like a _battue_; they seemed to be following a scent.\nThey were evidently looking for some one; the noise was wide-spread\nand far-reaching. There were confused outcries of wrath and triumph, a\nclamor of indistinct sounds. Suddenly, as an outline is revealed in a\ncloud of smoke, one sound became clearly defined and audible in this\ntumult. It was a name, repeated by thousands of voices, and the Marquis\ndistinctly heard the cry,--\n\n\"Lantenac, Lantenac! The Marquis of Lantenac!\" They were looking for\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTHE VICISSITUDES OF CIVIL WAR.\n\n\nAround him suddenly, from all directions, the thicket was filled with\nmuskets, bayonets, and sabres, a tricolored banner was unfurled in the\ndim light, and the cry, \"Lantenac!\" burst forth on his ears, while at\nhis feet through the brambles and branches savage faces appeared.\n\nThe Marquis was standing alone on the top of the height, visible from\nevery part of the wood. He could scarcely distinguish those who shouted\nhis name, but he could be seen by all. Had there been a thousand\nmuskets in the wood, he offered them a target. He could distinguish\nnothing in the coppice, but the fiery eyes of all were directed upon\nhim.\n\nHe took off his hat, turned back the brim, and drawing from his pocket\na white cockade, he pulled out a long dry thorn from a furze-bush, with\nwhich he fastened the cockade to the brim of his hat, then replaced it\non his head, the upturned brim revealing his forehead and the cockade,\nand in a loud voice, as though addressing the wide forest, he said:--\n\n\"I am the man you seek. I am the Marquis de Lantenac, Viscount de\nFontenay, Breton Prince, Lieutenant-General of the armies of the king.\nMake an end of it. Aim! Fire!\"\n\nAnd opening with both hands his goat-skin waistcoat, he bared his\nbreast.\n\nLowering his eyes to see the levelled guns, he beheld himself\nsurrounded by kneeling men.\n\nA great shout went up,--\"Long live Lantenac! Long live our lord! Long\nlive the General!\"\n\nAt the same time hats were thrown up and sabres whirled joyously, while\nfrom all sides brown woollen caps hoisted on long poles were waving in\nthe air.\n\nA Vendean band surrounded him.\n\n[Illustration 031]\n\nAt the sight of him they fell on their knees.\n\nLegends tell us that the ancient Thuringian forests were inhabited by\nstrange beings,--a race of giants, at once superior and inferior to\nmen,--whom the Romans regarded as horrible beasts, and the Germans\nas divine incarnations, and who might chance to be exterminated or\nworshipped according to the race they encountered.\n\nA sensation similar to that which may have been felt by one of those\nbeings was experienced by the Marquis when, expecting to be treated\nlike a monster, he was suddenly worshipped as a deity.\n\nAll those flashing eyes were fastened upon him with a kind of savage\nlove.\n\nThe crowd were armed with guns, sabres, scythes, poles, and sticks. All\nwore large felt hats or brown caps, with white cockades, a profusion\nof rosaries and charms, wide breeches left open at the knee, jackets of\nskin, and leather gaiters; the calves of their legs were bare, and they\nwore their hair long; some looked fierce, but all had frank and open\ncountenances.\n\nA young man of noble bearing passed through the crowd of kneeling men\nand hastily approached the Marquis. He wore a felt hat with an upturned\nbrim, a white cockade, and a skin jacket, like the peasants; but his\nhands were delicate and his linen was fine, and over his waistcoat was\na white silk scarf, from which hung a sword with a golden hilt.\n\nHaving reached the _hure_, he threw aside his hat, unfastened his\nscarf, and kneeling, presented to the Marquis both scarf and sword.\n\n\"Indeed we were seeking for you,\" he said, \"and we have found you.\nReceive the sword of command. These men are yours now. I was their\ncommander; now am I promoted, since I become your soldier. Accept our\ndevotion, my lord. General, give me your orders.\"\n\nAt a sign from him, men carrying the tricolored banner came forth from\nthe woods, and going up to the Marquis, placed it at his feet. It was\nthe one he had seen through the trees.\n\n\"General,\" said the young man who presented the sword and the scarf,\n\"this is the flag which we took from the Blues who held the farm\nHerbe-en-Pail. My name is Gavard, my lord. I was with the Marquis de la\nRouarie.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Marquis.\n\n[Illustration 032]\n\nAnd calm and composed he girded on the scarf.\n\nThen he pulled out his sword, and waving it above his head, he cried,--\n\n\"Rise! And long live the king!\"\n\nAll started to their feet. Then from the depth of the woods arose a\ntumultuous and triumphant cry,--\n\n\"Long live the king! Long live our Marquis! Long live Lantenac!\"\n\nThe Marquis turned towards Gavard.\n\n\"How many are you?\"\n\n\"Seven thousand.\"\n\nWhile they were descending the hill, the peasants clearing away the\nfurze-bushes to make a path for the Marquis de Lantenac, Gavard\ncontinued:--\n\n\"All this may be explained in a word, my lord: nothing could be more\nsimple. It needed but a spark. The republican placard in revealing your\npresence has roused the country for the king. Besides, we have been\nsecretly notified by the mayor of Granville, who is one of us,--the\nsame who saved the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Ollivier. They rang the tocsin last night.\"\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"For you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Marquis.\n\n\"And here we are,\" continued Gavard.\n\n\"And you number seven thousand?\"\n\n\"To-day. But we shall be fifteen thousand to-morrow. It is the Breton\ncontingent. When Monsieur Henri de la Rochejaquelein went to join\nthe catholic army they sounded the tocsin, and in one night six\nparishes--Isernay, Corqueux, \u00c3\u0089chaubroignes, Aubiers, Sainte Aubin, and\nNueil--sent him ten thousand men. They had no munitions of war, but\nhaving found at a quarryman's house sixty pounds of blasting-powder,\nMonsieur de la Rochejaquelein took his departure with that. We felt\nsure you must be somewhere in these woods, and we were looking for you.\"\n\n\"And you attacked the Blues at the farm Herbe-en-Pail?\"\n\n\"The wind prevented them from hearing the tocsin, and they mistrusted\nnothing; the population of the hamlet, a set of clowns, received them\nwell. This morning we invested the farm while the Blues were sleeping,\nand the thing was over in a trice. I have a horse here; will you deign\nto accept it, general?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA peasant led up a white horse with military housings. The Marquis\nmounted him without accepting Gavard's proffered assistance.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the peasants. The English fashion of cheering is much\nin vogue on the Breton coast, for the people have continual dealings\nwith the Channel islands.\n\nGavard made the military salute, asking, as he did so, \"Where will you\nestablish your headquarters, my lord?\"\n\n\"At first, in the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res.\"\n\n\"It is one of the seven forests belonging to you.\"\n\n\"We need a priest.\"\n\n\"We have one.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"The curate of the Chapelle-Erbr\u00c3\u00a9e.\"\n\n\"I know him. He has made the trip to Jersey.\" A priest stepped out from\nthe ranks and said,--\n\n\"Three times.\"\n\nThe Marquis turned his head.\n\n\"Good morning, Monsieur le Cur\u00c3\u00a9. There is work in store for you.\"\n\n\"So much the better, Monsieur le Marquis.\"\n\n\"You will have to hear the confessions of such as desire your services.\nNo one will be forced.\"\n\n\"Marquis,\" said the priest, \"at Gu\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9e, Gaston compels the\nrepublicans to confess.\"\n\n\"He is a hairdresser. The dying should be allowed free choice in such a\nmatter.\"\n\nGavard, who had gone away to give certain orders, now returned.\n\n\"I await your commands, general.\"\n\n\"In the first place, the rendez-vous is in the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res.\nDirect the men to separate and meet there.\"\n\n\"The order has been given.\"\n\n\"Did you not say that the people of Herbe-en-Pail were friendly to the\nBlues?\"\n\n\"Yes, general.\"\n\n\"Was the farm burned?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you burn the hamlet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Burn it.\"\n\n\"The Blues tried to defend themselves.

We will decide what Is to be done with them.\"\n\nAnd the Marquis spurred his horse forward.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nNO MERCY![2]NO QUARTER![3]\n\n\nWhile these events were transpiring in the vicinity of Tanis, the\nbeggar had gone towards Crollon. He plunged into the ravines, under\nwide leafy bowers, heedless of all things, noticing nothing; as he\nhimself had expressed it, dreaming rather than thinking,--for the\nthinker has an object, but the dreamer has none; wandering, rambling,\npausing, munching here and there a sprig of wild sorrel, drinking at\nthe springs, raising his head from time to time as distant sounds\nattracted his attention, then yielding again to the irresistible\nfascination of nature; presenting his rags to the sunlight, hearing\nhuman sounds, by chance, but listening to the singing of birds.\n\nHe was old and slow; as he told the Marquis of Lantenac, he could not\ngo far; a quarter of a mile fatigued him; he made a short circuit\ntowards Croix-Avranchin, and it was evening when he returned.\n\nA little beyond Macey, the path he followed led him to a sort of\nelevation, destitute of trees, which commanded a wide expanse of\ncountry, including the entire horizon from the west as far as the sea.\n\nA smoke attracted his attention.\n\nThere is nothing more delightful than a smoke, and nothing more\nalarming. There are smokes signifying peace, and smokes that mean\nmischief. In the density and color of a column of smoke lies all\nthe difference between war and peace, brotherly love and hatred,\nhospitality and the grave, life and death. A smoke rising among the\ntrees may mean the sweetest thing in all the world,--the family hearth,\nor the most dreadful of calamities,--a conflagration. And the entire\nhappiness or misery of a human being is sometimes centred in a vapor,\nscattered by the wind. The smoke which Tellmarch saw was of a kind to\nexcite anxiety.\n\nIt was black with sudden flashes of red light, as though the furnace\nfrom whence it sprung burned fitfully and was gradually dying out, and\nit rose above Herbe-en-Pail. Tellmarch hurried along, walking towards\nthe smoke. He was tired, but he wanted to know what it meant.\n\nHe reached the top of a hillock, behind which nestled a hamlet and the\nfarm.\n\nNeither farm nor hamlet was to be seen.\n\nA heap of ruins was still burning, all that remained of Herbe-en-Pail.\n\nIt is much more heart-rending to see a cottage burn than a palace. A\ncottage in flames is a pitiful sight. Devastation swooping down on\npoverty, a vulture pouncing upon an earth-worm,--there is a sense of\nrepugnance about it that makes one shudder.\n\nIf we believe the Biblical legend, the sight of a conflagration once\nturned a human being into a statue. For an instant a similar change\ncame over Tellmarch. The sight before his eyes transfixed him to the\nspot. The work of destruction went on in silence. Not a cry was heard;\nnot a human sigh mingled with the smoke. That furnace pursued its task\nof devouring the village with no other sound than the splitting of\ntimbers and the crackling of thatch. From time to time the clouds of\nsmoke were rent, the falling roofs revealed the gaping chambers, the\nfiery furnace displayed all its rubies, the poor rags turned scarlet,\nand the wretched old furniture, tinged with purple, stood out amid\nthese dull red interiors; Tellmarch was dazed by the terrible calamity.\n\nSeveral trees of a neighboring chestnut-grove had caught fire and were\nin a blaze.\n\nHe listened, trying to hear a voice, a call, or some kind of a noise.\nNothing stirred but the flames; all was still save the fire. Had all\nthe inhabitants fled?\n\nWhere was the community that lived and labored at Herbe-en-Pail? What\nhad become of this little family?\n\nTellmarch descended the hillock.\n\nA gloomy enigma lay before him. He approached it slowly, gazing at\nit steadily. He advanced towards the ruin with the deliberation of a\nshadow, feeling like a ghost in this tomb.\n\nHaving reached what had formerly been the door of the farm, he looked\ninto the yard, whose ruined walls no longer separated it from the\nsurrounding hamlet.\n\nWhat he had seen before was nothing as compared with what he now\nbeheld. From afar he had seen the terror of it; now all its horrors lay\nbefore him.\n\nIn the middle of the yard was a dark mass, vaguely outlined on one side\nby the flames, and on the other by the moonlight. It was a heap of\nmen; and these men were dead. Around this mound lay a wide pool, still\nsmoking, whose surface reflected the flames; but it needed not the fire\nto redden it; it was of blood.\n\nTellmarch went up to it. He examined, one after another, these\nprostrate bodies; all were corpses. Both the moon and the\nconflagration lighted up the scene.\n\nThe dead bodies were those of soldiers. Every man had bare feet; both\ntheir shoes and their weapons had been taken from them, but they\nstill wore their blue uniforms. Here and there one could distinguish,\namid the confusion of the limbs and heads, hats bearing the tricolor\ncockades riddled with bullets. They were republicans,--the same\nParisians who the previous evening had been living, active men,\ngarrisoned at the farm Herbe-en-Pail. The symmetrical arrangement of\nthe fallen bodies proved the affair to have been an execution. They had\nbeen shot on the spot, and with precision. They were all dead. Not a\nsound came from the mass.\n\nTellmarch examined each individual corpse, and every man was riddled\nwith shot.\n\nTheir executioners, doubtless in haste to depart, had not taken time to\nbury them.\n\nJust as he was about to leave the place, his attention was attracted by\nthe sight of four feet protruding beyond the corner of a low wall in\nthe yard.\n\nThese feet were smaller than those which he had previously seen; there\nwere shoes upon them, and as he drew near he perceived that they were\nthe feet of women.\n\nTwo women were lying side by side behind the wall, also shot.\n\nTellmarch stooped over them. One of them wore a kind of uniform; beside\nher was a jug, broken and empty. She was a vivandi\u00c3\u00a8re. She had four\nballs in her head. She was dead.\n\n[Illustration 033]\n\nTellmarch examined the other, who was a peasant woman. Her eyes were\nclosed, her mouth open, her face discolored; but there were no wounds\nin her head. Her dress, undoubtedly worn to shreds by long marches, was\nrent by her fall, exposing her bosom. Tellmarch pushed it still further\naside, and discovered on her shoulder a round wound made by a ball; the\nshoulder-blade was broken. He gazed upon her livid breast.\n\n\"A nursing mother,\" he murmured.\n\nHe touched her. She was not cold.\n\nThe broken bone and the wound in the shoulder were her only injuries.\nHe placed his hand on her breast, and felt a faint throb. She was not\ndead.\n\nTellmarch raised himself, and cried out in a terrible voice,--\n\n\"Is there no one here?\"\n\n\"Is that you, Caimand?\" replied a voice, so low that it could scarcely\nbe heard.\n\nAt the same time a head emerged from a hole in the ruin, and the next\nmoment a second one peered forth from another aperture.\n\nThese were the sole survivors,--two peasants who had managed to hide\nthemselves, and who now, reassured by the familiar voice of the\nCaimand, crept out of the hiding-places where they had been crouching.\n\nThey approached Tellmarch, still trembling violently.\n\nThe latter had found strength to utter his cry, but he could not speak;\ndeep emotions always produce this effect.\n\nHe pointed to the woman lying at his feet.\n\n\"Is she still alive?\" asked one of the peasants.\n\nTellmarch nodded.\n\n\"And the other woman,--is she living too?\" asked the second peasant.\n\nTellmarch shook his head.\n\nThe peasant who had been the first to show himself continued:--\n\n\"All the others are dead, are they not? I saw it all. I was in my\ncellar. How grateful one is to God, in times like these, to have no\nfamily! My house was burned. Lord Jesus! everybody was killed. This\nwoman had children,--three little ones! The children cried, 'Mother!'\nThe mother cried, 'Oh, my children!' They killed the mother and carried\naway the children. I saw all,--oh, my God! my God! Those who murdered\nthem went off well pleased. They carried away the little ones, and\nkilled the mother. But she is not dead, is she? I say, Caimand, do you\nthink you could save her? Don't you want us to help you carry her to\nyour _carnichot?_\"\n\n[Illustration 034]\n\nTellmarch nodded.\n\nThe woods were near the farm. They quickly made a litter with branches\nand ferns, and placing the woman, still motionless, upon it, they\nstarted towards the grove, the two peasants bearing the litter, one at\nthe head, the other at the foot, while Tellmarch supported the woman's\narm and constantly felt her pulse.\n\nOn the way the two peasants talked; and over the body of the bleeding\nwoman, whose pale face was lighted by the moon, they exchanged their\nfrightened exclamations.\n\n\"To kill all!\"\n\n\"To burn all!\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lord! Is that the way they are going to do now?\"\n\n\"It was that tall old man who ordered it.\"\n\n\"Yes; he was the commander.\"\n\n\"I did not see him while the shooting went on. Was he there?\"\n\n\"No, he was gone. But it was done by his order, all the same.\"\n\n\"Then it was he who did this.\"\n\n\"He said, 'Kill, burn! No quarter!'\"\n\n\"Is he a marquis?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; he is our marquis.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"It is Monsieur de Lantenac.\"\n\nTellmarch raised his eyes to heaven, murmuring between his teeth,--\n\n\"Had I but known!\"\n\n\n[Footnote 1: A head.--TR.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Watchword of the Commune.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Watchword of the Princes.]\n\n[Illustration: At Paris. 035]\n\n\n\n\nPART II.\n\n\nAT PARIS.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I.\n\n\nCIMOURDAIN.\n\n\n[Illustration: Cimourdain. 036]\n\nI.\n\n\nTHE STREETS OF PARIS AT THAT TIME.\n\n\nPeople lived in public; they ate at tables spread outside the doors;\nwomen sat on the church steps, making lint to the accompaniment of the\nMarseillaise; the park of Monceaux and the Luxembourg were turned into\nparade-grounds; at every street-corner there was a gun-maker's shop,\nwhere muskets were manufactured before the eyes of the passers-by,\nto their great admiration. \"Patience: this is revolution\" was on\nevery lip. People smiled heroically. They went to the theatre as in\nAthens during the Peloponnesian war. At street-corners were seen such\nplaybills as these, advertising: \"The Siege of Thionville;\" \"A Mother\nsaved from the Flames;\" \"The Club of Sans-Soucis;\" \"The oldest of the\nPopes Joan;\" \"The Military Philosophers;\" \"The Art of Love-making in\nthe Village.\" The Germans were at the gates; it was rumored that\nthe King of Prussia had secured boxes for the opera. Everything was\nterrible, yet no one was frightened. The grewsome law against the\nsuspected, which was the crime of Merlin de Douai, held a vision of\nthe guillotine suspended over every head. A lawyer, S\u00c3\u00a9ran by name,\nlearning that he had been denounced, calmly awaited his arrest, arrayed\nin his dressing-gown and slippers, playing the flute at his window.\nNo one seemed to have any spare time, every one was in a hurry; all\nthe hats bore their cockades, and the women cried, \"Are not red caps\nbecoming to us?\" All Paris seemed in the act of changing its abode.\nThe curiosity shops were filled with crowns, mitres, gilded sceptres,\nand fleur-de-lis, spoils from royal dwellings,--the signs of the\ndestruction of monarchy. Copes and surplices might be seen hanging on\nhooks offered for sale at the old-clothes shops. At the Porcherons\nand at Ramponneau's men decked out in surplices and stoles bestrode\ndonkeys caparisoned with chasubles, and drank wine from ecclesiastical\nciboria. In the Rue Saint-Jacques barefooted street-pavers once stopped\nthe wheelbarrow of a shoe-pedler and clubbing together bought fifteen\npairs of shoes to send to the Convention \"for our soldiers.\" Busts of\nRousseau, Franklin, Brutus, and even, be it added, of Marat, abounded.\nIn the Rue Cloche-Perce, below one of Marat's busts, in a black wooden\nframe under glass, hung a formula of prosecution against Malouet, with\nfacts in support of the charges and the following lines inscribed on\nthe margin:--\n\n      These details were given to me by the mistress of Sylvain\n      Bailly, a good patriot, and who had a liking for me.\n\n      Signed: MARAT.\n\nThe inscription on the Palais Royal fountain, \"Quantos effundit in\nusus!\" was hidden under two large canvases painted in distemper, one\nrepresenting Cahier de Gerville denouncing to the National Assembly\nthe rallying-cry of the \"Chiffonistes\" of Arles; the other, Louis\nXVI. brought back from Varennes in his royal carriage, and under the\ncarriage a plank fastened by cords bearing on each end a grenadier\nwith levelled bayonet. Very few large shops were open; perambulating\ncarts containing haberdashery and toys, lighted by tallow candles,\nwhich, melting, dripped upon the merchandise, were dragged through the\nstreets by women. Ex-nuns adorned with blond wigs kept open shop; this\nwoman, darning stockings in a stall, was a countess; that dressmaker,\na marchioness; Madame de Boufflers lived in an attic from which she\nhad a view of her own hotel. Venders ran about offering the news\nbulletins. People who muffled their chins in their neck-cloths were\ncalled \"\u00c3\u00a9crouelleux.\" Street singers swarmed. The crowd hooted Pitou,\nthe royalist song-writer, a brave man, to boot, for he was imprisoned\ntwenty-two times and was brought before the revolutionary tribunal for\nslapping himself behind when he uttered the word \"civism;\" seeing that\nhis head was in danger, he exclaimed, \"But my head is not the offending\nmember!\" which made the judges laugh, and saved his life. This Pitou\nridiculed the fashion of Greek and Latin names; his favorite song\nwas about a cobbler and his wife whom he called Cujus and Cujusdam.\nThe Carmagnole was danced in circles; they no longer said \"lady\"\nand \"gentleman,\" but \"citizen\" and \"citizeness.\" They danced in the\nruined cloisters, beneath a chandelier made of two sticks fastened\ncrosswise to the vaulted roof, bearing four candles, while the church\nlamps burned upon the altar, and tombs lay beneath the dancers' feet.\nThey wore \"tyrant-blue\" waistcoats, and shirt-pins called \"liberty's\ncap,\" composed of red, white, and blue stones. The Rue de Richelieu\nwas called Rue de la Loi; the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the Faubourg de\nGloire; a statue of Nature stood in the Place de la Bastille. People\npointed out to each other well-known personages,--Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, Didier,\nNicolas, and Gamier-Delaunay, who mounted guard at the doors of the\njoiner Duplay; Voullant, who never missed a day of guillotining, and\nwho followed the tumbrils of the condemned, calling it \"going to the\nred mass;\" Montflabert, a revolutionary juryman and marquis whom they\ncalled _Dix-Ao\u00c3\u00bbt._ They watched the pupils of the \u00c3\u0089cole Militaire file\npast, called \"aspirants to the school of Mars\" by the decrees of the\nConvention, and nicknamed by the people \"Robespierre's pages.\" They\nread the proclamations of Fr\u00c3\u00a9ron, denouncing those suspected of the\ncrime of \"n\u00c3\u00a9gotiantisime.\" Young scapegraces gathered about the doors\nof the mayoralties crowding the brides and grooms as they came in\nsight, and shouting, \"Municipal marriages,\" in derision of the civil\nceremony. The statues of the saints and kings at the Invalides were\ncrowned with Phrygian caps. They played cards on curbstones at the\ncrossings, and the very cards themselves were totally revolutionized;\nkings were replaced by genii, queens by the Goddess of Liberty, knaves\nby Equality, aces by emblems of Law. The public gardens were tilled;\nthey ploughed the Tuileries.\n\nWith all this was intermingled, especially among the conquered\nparty, an indescribably haughty weariness of living. A man wrote to\nFouquier-Tinville, \"Be so kind as to lift from me the burden of life.\nThis is my address.\" Champcenetz was arrested for exclaiming at the\nPalais Royal: \"When are we to have a Turkish revolution? I should\nlike to see the republic _\u00c3\u00a0 la Porte.\"_[1] Newspapers abounded.\nHair-dressers' apprentices curled the women's wigs in public while the\nmaster read the \"Moniteur\" aloud; others, surrounded by listeners,\ncommented with expressive gesticulations on the journal \"Entendons\nnous,\" of Dubois Cranc\u00c3\u00a9, or the \"Trompette du p\u00c3\u00a8re Bellerose.\"\nSometimes a man was both a barber and a pork-dealer; and hams and\nchitterlings would hang side by side with a golden-haired doll. The\nwines of the \u00c3\u0089migr\u00c3\u00a9s were sold by dealers on the streets. One merchant\nadvertised wine of fifty-two different brands; others retailed\nlyre-shaped clocks and sofas _\u00c3\u00a0 la duchesse._ A hairdresser had the\nfollowing notice printed on his sign: \"I shave the clergy; I dress\nthe hair of the nobility; I wait upon the Tiers-\u00c3\u0089tat.\" People went to\nMartin, at No. 173 in the Rue d'Anjou, formerly called Rue Dauphine,\nto have their fortune told. Bread, coal, and soap were scarce. Herds\nof milch-cows on their way from the provinces were constantly passing.\nAt La Vall\u00c3\u00a9e, lamb was sold at fifteen francs a pound. An order of the\nCommune assigned to each person a pound of meat for every ten days.\nPeople stood in files at the shop-doors; one file that reached from the\ndoor of a grocer's shop in the Rue du Petit-Carreau to the middle of\nthe Rue Montorgueil has become a matter of tradition. Forming a queue\nwas called \"holding the string,\" on account of the long cord held by\nthose who stood in line one behind the other.\n\nIn the midst of all this wretchedness women were brave and gentle. They\npassed whole nights waiting their turn to be served at the baker's.\nThe revolution was successful in its expedients. It alleviated this\nwide-spread misery by two dangerous measures,--the assignat and\nthe maximum; in other words, the lever and the fulcrum. France was\nactually saved by empiricism. The enemy, both in Coblentz and in\nLondon, speculated in assignats.\n\n[Illustration 038]\n\nGirls went hither and thither offering lavender-water, garters,\nand false hair, and selling stocks at the same time; there were\nstock-jobbers on the steps of the Rue Vivienne, with muddy shoes,\ngreasy hair, woollen caps with fox-tails, and the dandies of the Rue\nde Valois, with their polished boots, a toothpick in their mouths, and\nbeaver hats on their heads, to whom the girls said \"thee and thou.\" The\npeople hunted them down as they did thieves, whom the royalists called\n\"active citizens.\" Robbery, however, seldom occurred; the fearful\ndestitution was matched by a stoical honesty. With downcast eyes the\nbarefooted and the hungry went gravely past the shop-windows of the\njewellers of the Palais \u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9. During a domiciliary visit made by the\nSection Antoine at Beaumarchais' house, a woman plucked a flower in\nthe garden: the crowd boxed her ears. A cord of wood cost four hundred\nfrancs in coin. People were to be seen in the streets sawing up their\nwooden beds. In the winter the fountains froze, and two pails of water\ncost twenty sous; every man was his own water-carrier. A gold louis was\nworth three thousand nine hundred and fifty francs. A ride in a fiacre\ncost six hundred francs. After a day's ride the following dialogue\nmight be heard: \"How much do I owe you, coachman?\" \"Six thousand\nlivres.\" The trade of a greengrocer woman amounted to twenty thousand\nfrancs a day. A beggar was known to have said: \"Help me, for charity's\nsake! I want two hundred and thirty livres to pay for my shoes.\" At the\nentrance of the bridges might be seen colossal figures, sculptured and\npainted by David, which Mercier insultingly called \"enormous wooden\nPunchinellos.\" These figures represented Federalism and Coalition\noverthrown. No infirmity of purpose among the people. There was a\ngloomy sense of pleasure in having put an end to thrones. No lack of\nvolunteers ready to lay down their lives: every street furnished a\nbattalion. The flags of the district went hither and thither, each one\nwith its own device. On the banner of the Capuchin District might be\nread, \"No one will shave us;\" on another, \"No other nobility save that\nof the heart.\" On the walls were placards, large and small, white,\nyellow, green, and red, printed and written, on all which might be read\nthis war-cry: \"Long live the Republic!\" Little children lisped, \"\u00c3\u0087a\nira.\"\n\nThese little children were the nucleus of a great future.\n\nLater on, a cynical city took the place of the tragical one;\nthe streets of Paris have displayed two distinct revolutionary\naspects,--the one preceding the 9th Thermidor, and that which followed\nit. After the Paris of Saint-Just came the Paris of Tallien. Such are\nthe constant antitheses of Almighty God. Immediately after Sinai, the\nCourtille appeared.\n\nParoxysms of popular folly may always be expected. The same thing had\ntaken place eighty years before. After Louis XIV., as well as after\nRobespierre, the people needed breathing space; hence the Regency at\nthe opening of the century and the Directory at its close, each reign\nof terror ending in a Saturnalia. France fled from the Puritan as well\nas from the monarchical cloister with the joy of a nation escaping from\nbondage.\n\nAfter the 9th Thermidor, Paris was like one gone mad with gayety.\nAn unwholesome joy prevailed, exceeding all bounds. The frenzy of\nlife followed the frenzy of death, and grandeur eclipsed itself.\nThey had a Trimalcion whom they called Grimod de la Reyni\u00c3\u00a8re; also\nan \"Almanach des Gourmands.\" People dined to the accompaniment\nof trumpets in the entresols of the Palais Royal; the orchestras\nwere composed of women beating drums and blowing trumpets; the\n\"rigadooner,\" bow in hand, reigned over all; they supped after the\nOriental fashion at M\u00c3\u00a9ot's, surrounded by censers of perfume. The\nartist Boze painted his daughters, innocent and charming heads of\nsixteen, \"en guillotin\u00c3\u00a9s,\"--that is, bare-necked and in red chemises.\nThe wild dances in ruined churches were followed by the balls of\nRuggieri, Luquet Wenzel, Mauduit, and the Montansier; to the dignified\n_citoyennes_ making lint, succeeded sultanas, savages, and nymphs; to\nthe bare feet of the soldiers, disfigured by blood, mud, and dust,\nsucceeded the bare feet of women adorned with diamonds; and together\nwith shamelessness came dishonesty,--which had its purveyors in high\nplaces, and their imitators in the lower ranks. Paris was infested by\nswarms of sharpers, and every man had to watch his \"luc,\" or in other\nwords, his pocket-book. One of the amusements was to go to the Place\nof the Palais de Justice to see the female acrobats on the tabouret;\nthey were forced to tie their skirts down. At the doors of the theatres\nstreet-urchins offered cabs, crying, \"Citizen and Citizeness, there is\nroom enough for two.\" They sold no more copies of \"The Old Cordelier\"\nor of \"L'Ami du peuple;\" but in their stead they offered \"Punch's\nLetter\" and \"The Rogues' Petition.\" The Marquis de Sade presided at\nthe section of the Pikes, Place Vend\u00c3\u00b4me. The reaction was both jovial\nand ferocious. The Dragons of Liberty of '92 were revived under the\nname of Knights of the Dagger. At the same time there appeared on the\nstage the type Jocrisse. There were the \"Merveilleuses,\" and after the\n\"Merveilleuses,\" the \"Inconcevables.\" People swore fantastic oaths\nby \"sa paole victim\u00c3\u00a9e\" and by \"sa paole verte.\" This was the recoil\nfrom Mirabeau to Bob\u00c3\u00a8che. Paris vibrates like an enormous pendulum\nof civilization; now it touches one pole, now the other,--Thermopyl\u00c3\u00a6\nand Gomorrah. After '93, Revolution suffered a singular eclipse: the\ncentury apparently forgot to finish what it had begun; a strange orgie,\ninterposing, took possession of the foreground, and thrusting the\ndread Apocalypse behind, it drew a veil over the monstrous vision, and\nshouted with laughter after its fright; tragedy vanished in parody;\nand rising from the horizon's edge the smoke of carnival obscured the\noutlines of Medusa.\n\nBut in the year '93 the streets of Paris still retained the imposing\nand fierce aspect of the beginning. They had their orators, like Varlot\nfor instance, who travelled about in a booth on wheels, from the top\nof which he harangued the passers-by; their heroes, one of whom was\ncalled \"the Captain of iron-shod poles;\" their favorites, like Guffroy,\nthe author of the pamphlet \"Rougiff.\" Some of these celebrities were\nmischievous, others exerted a wholesome influence. One among all the\nrest was honest and filial,--it was Cimourdain.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nCIMOURDAIN.\n\n\n[Illustration 039]\n\n\nCimourdain had a pure but gloomy soul. There was something of the\nabsolute within him. He had been a priest, which is a serious matter.\nA man may, like the heavens, enjoy a gloomy serenity,--it needs only\nan influence powerful enough to create night within his soul; and the\npriesthood had done this thing for Cimourdain. To be once a priest is\nto be a priest forever.\n\nThough there be night within us, we may still possess the stars.\nCimourdain was a man of many virtues and truths, but they shone amid\nthe darkness.\n\nHis story may be told in a few words. He had been a village curate, and\ntutor in an influential family; but falling heir to a small legacy, he\nhad thereby gained his freedom.\n\nHe was obstinate to the last degree. He employed meditation as the\nartisan uses his pincers. He believed it wrong to abandon an idea until\nhe had fully developed it. His method of thought was intense. He was\nfamiliar with all the European languages, and had some acquaintance\nwith other tongues. His devotion to study was a great help towards the\npreservation of his chastity. But there is nothing more dangerous than\nsuch a system of repression.\n\nEither from pride, circumstances, or loftiness of soul, he had been\ntrue to his priestly vows; but his faith he had not been able to keep.\nScience had crushed it; all his dogmas had gone from him. Then, looking\ninto his own soul, he saw therein a mutilated being, and having no\npower to rid himself of his priesthood, he tried, after an austere\nfashion, to remould the man. For want of a family he adopted his\ncountry; a wife had been refused him,--he had wedded humanity. There is\na certain sense of emptiness in this all-embracing zeal.\n\nHis parents, who were peasants, had thought to lift him above the\ncommon people by consecrating him to the priesthood; he had returned\namong them of his own accord, and with a feeling of passionate\ndevotion watched the suffering with intense sympathy. From a priest\nhe had become a philosopher, and from a philosopher an athlete. Even\nduring the life of Louis XV., Cimourdain had vaguely fancied himself\na republican. But of what republic? Perhaps of the Republic of Plato,\nand it might be of Draco also. Forbidden to love, he devoted himself\nto hating. He detested lies, monarchy, theocracy, and his priestly\ngarb; he hated the present, and eagerly invoked the future; he had a\npresentiment of what it would be, he foresaw it, he pictured it, both\nterrible and grand. In order to put an end to this deplorable human\nmisery, he felt the need of a leader who would appear not only as an\navenger but also as a liberator. He worshipped the catastrophe from\nafar.\n\nIn 1789 this catastrophe came and found him ready. Cimourdain flung\nhimself into that gigantic scheme for human regeneration on logical\nprinciples, which, for a mind constituted like his, is equivalent\nto saying with inexorable determination. Logic is not a softening\ninfluence. He had survived the great revolutionary years, and had been\nshaken by the blasts thereof,--in '89, the fall of the Bastille, the\nend of the martyrdom of people; in.'90, on the 19th of June, the end of\nthe feudal system; in '91, Varennes, and the end of royalty; in '92,\nthe birth of the Republic. He had seen the rise of Revolution. He was\nnot the man to fear that giant; on the contrary, the universal growth\nhad given him new life, and though already advanced in years,--for\nhe was fifty, and a priest ages faster than other men,--he too began\nto develop. From year to year he had watched and kept pace with the\nprogress of events. At first he had feared lest Revolution might fail;\nhe watched it. Since it had both logic and justice on its side, he\nexpected its success, and his confidence increased in proportion to the\nfear it inspired; he would have this Minerva crowned with the stars\nof the future,--a Pallas likewise bearing the Gorgon's head for her\nbuckler. In case of need he would have wished an infernal glare to\nflash from her divine eyes upon the demons, paying them back in their\nown coin.\n\nThus he reached '93.\n\n'93 is the war of Europe against France, and of France against Paris.\nWhat then is Revolution? It is the victory of France over Europe, and\nof Paris over France. Hence the immensity of that terrible moment '93,\ngrander than all the rest of the century.\n\nNothing could be more tragic. Europe attacking France, and France\nattacking Paris,--a drama with the proportions of an epic.\n\n'93 is a year of intense action. The tempest is there in all its wrath\nand grandeur. Cimourdain felt himself in his element. This scene of\ndistraction, wild and magnificent, suited the compass of his outspread\nwings. Like a sea-eagle, he united a profound inward calm with a relish\nfor external danger. Certain winged natures, souls of the tempest,\nferocious yet tranquil, seem eminently fitted for combatting the storms\nof life.\n\nHis sense of pity was never kindled, save in behalf of the wretched. He\ndevoted himself to those forms of suffering that are most repulsive.\nFor him nothing was abhorrent. That was his kind of goodness. He\nwas divine in his zeal to relieve the most loathsome sufferers. He\nsearched for ulcers that he might kiss them. Those noble actions\nwhich are hideous to look upon are the most difficult to perform; for\nsuch he had a preference. One day at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-Dieu a man was at the\npoint of death, suffocating with a tumor in the throat,--a putrid,\nmalignant, and perhaps contagious abscess, which must be opened at\nonce. Cimourdain was there; he put his lips to the abscess, sucked\nit, spitting it out as his mouth filled, emptied the tumor and saved\nthe man. As he still was wearing his priestly garb at the time, some\none said to him: \"Had you done that for the king you would be made a\nbishop.\" \"I would not do it for the king,\" replied Cimourdain. The act\nand the answer made him popular in the gloomy quarters of Paris to\na degree that won for him unbounded influence over the classes that\nsuffer, weep, and struggle for vengeance. When the public indignation,\nthat fruitful source of blunders, rose high against the monopolists, it\nwas Cimourdain who by a word prevented the sacking of a boat laden with\nsoap at the Saint-Nicolas quay, and who dispersed the furious crowds\nthat were stopping the carriages at the barrier Saint-Lazare.\n\n[Illustration 040]\n\nHe it was who ten days after the 10th of August marshalled the people\nwho went forth to overthrow the statues of kings, which as they fell\ncost some of them their lives. On the Place Vend\u00c3\u00b4me, a woman, Reine\nViolet, pulling at the rope she had fastened around the neck of Louis\nXIV., was crushed to death beneath its weight. This statue had been\nstanding for a hundred years: it was erected on the 12th of August,\n1692; it was overthrown on the 12th of August, 1793. On the Place de la\nConcorde one Guinguerlot, having called the demolishers \"canaille,\" was\nbutchered on the pedestal of the statue of Louis XV. The statue itself\nwas hacked to pieces; later, it was melted into sous. One arm alone\nescaped,--the right arm, which Louis XV. held outstretched with the\ngesture of a Roman emperor. By request of Cimourdain the people sent a\ndeputation to offer this arm to Latude, a man who had been buried alive\nin the Bastille for forty years. When Latude with an iron collar round\nhis neck and a chain round his loins was rotting alive in that prison\nat the bidding of the king whose statue overlooked Paris, who could\nhave prophesied to him that both prison and statue would fall, and that\nhe would come forth from his tomb,--he, the prisoner, would be the\nmaster of that hand of bronze which had signed his warrant, and that\nnothing would be left of this monarch of clay save his brazen arm?\n\nCimourdain was one of those men who possess an inward monitor, and who\nwhen they appear absent-minded are simply listening to its voice.\n\nCimourdain was both learned and ignorant. He was versed in science,\nand knew nothing whatever of life; hence his severity. His eyes were\nbandaged like those of Homer's Themis: he possessed the blind certainty\nof an arrow,--that, seeing naught besides, flies straight to the goal.\nIn revolution there is nothing so formidable as the straight line.\nCimourdain went straight ahead, with fatal results. He believed that\nin these social geneses the farthest point is solid ground,--an error\ncommon to minds in which logic occupies the place of reason. He went\nbeyond the Convention, beyond the Commune: he belonged to the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe society called the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9 because it held its meetings in a hall\nof the old episcopal palace was rather a medley of men than a society.\nThere were present, as in the Commune, those silent but important\nspectators who, as Garat expressed it, \"had about them as many\npistols as they had pockets.\" The \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9 was a queer mixture, both\ncosmopolitan and Parisian,--no contradiction in terms, since Paris is\nthe place where throbs the heart of all nations. There at the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9\nwas the great plebeian incandescence. As compared with the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9, the\nConvention was cold and the Commune lukewarm. It was one of those\nrevolutionary formations which partake of the nature of a volcano. The\n\u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9 combined everything,--ignorance, stupidity, honesty, heroism,\nwrath, and policy. Brunswick had agents therein. It held men worthy of\nSparta, and others fit only for the galleys. The greater number of them\nwere mad and honest. The Gironde, speaking in the person of Isnard,\ntemporary president of the Convention, had uttered this appalling\nprophecy: \"Parisians, beware! for in your city not one stone shall\nbe left resting upon another, and the day will come when men will\nsearch for the place where Paris once stood.\" This speech had given\nBirth to the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9. Certain men--and as we have just said, men of\nall nations--had felt the need of drawing closer to Paris. Cimourdain\njoined this group.\n\nThe party reacted against the reactionists. It sprang from that public\nnecessity for violence which constitutes the formidable and mysterious\nside of revolutions. Strong in this strength, the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9 at once\ndefined its position. In the disturbances of Paris it was the Commune\nthat fired the cannon, and the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9 that sounded the alarm.\n\nIn his inexorable sincerity Cimourdain believed that all means are fair\nwhen devoted to the service of truth,--a conviction which eminently\nfitted him for the control of extremists of all parties. Scoundrels\nperceived him to be honest, and were satisfied. Crime is flattered to\nfeel that virtue has taken it in charge. It is rather embarrassing, but\npleasing nevertheless. Palloy the architect, who had taken advantage\nof the destruction of the Bastille to sell the stones for his own\nbenefit, and who, being appointed to paint the cell of Louis XVI.,\nhad in his zeal covered the wall with bars, chains, and iron collars;\nGonchon, the suspected orator of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, whose\nreceipts were found later; the American Fournier, who on the 17th of\nJuly fired a pistol-shot at Lafayette,--an act for which, they said,\nLafayette himself had paid; Henriot, who had come from Bic\u00c3\u00aatre, and\nwho had been a lackey, a juggler, a thief, and a spy before he turned\ngeneral and levelled his guns on the Convention; La Reynie, formerly\ngrand-vicar of Chartres, who had substituted \"P\u00c3\u00a8re Duchesne\" for his\nbreviary,--all these men were respected by Cimourdain, and all that\nwas needed to keep the worst of them from stumbling occasionally was\nto feel that really formidable and determined candor like a judgment\nbefore them. It was thus that Saint-Just terrified Schneider. At the\nsame time the majority in the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9, consisting for the most part of\npoor and violent men, sincere in their purposes, believed in Cimourdain\nand followed him. His vicar or aide-de-camp, whichever you choose\nto call him, was Danjou,--that other republican priest, whose lofty\nstature endeared him to the people, who called him the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Six-Pieds.\nCimourdain could have led whithersoever he chose that fearless chief\ncalled G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral la Pique and the bold Truchon (surnamed Grand-Nicolas),\nwho tried to save Madame de Lamballe, offering her his arm to assist\nher in leaping over the corpses,--an attempt which would have proved\nsuccessful had it not been for the barbarous joke of Chariot the\nbarber.\n\nThe Commune kept watch over the Convention, and the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9 over\nthe Commune. Cimourdain, an upright man, despising intrigues, had\nbroken more than one mysterious thread in the hands of Pache, whom\nBeurnonville called \"the black man.\" At the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9, Cimourdain was\non good terms with all. He was consulted by Dobsent and Momoro. He\nspoke Spanish to Gusman, Italian to Pio, English to Arthur, Flemish\nto Pereyra, German to the Austrian Proly, the bastard of a prince.\nHe reconciled all these discordant elements: hence his strong though\nobscure position. H\u00c3\u00a9bert feared him.\n\nIn those times and over those tragic assemblies Cimourdain possessed\nthe power of the inexorable. He was a faultless man, who believed\nhimself to be infallible. He had never been seen to weep. His was an\ninaccessible and frigid virtue; a just, but awful, man.\n\nThere are no half measures possible for a revolutionary priest. A\npriest who embarks in an adventure so portentous in its aims, is\ninfluenced either by the highest or the lowest motives; he must be\neither infamous or sublime. Cimourdain was sublime, but isolated\nin rugged inaccessibility, inhospitably repellent,--sublime in his\nsurrounding of precipices. Lofty mountains possess this forbidding\npurity.\n\nCimourdain looked like an ordinary man, clothed in whatever happened\nto be convenient, rather poor in aspect. In his youth he had received\nthe tonsure, and later in life had become bald. His few remaining\nlocks were gray. Looking upon his forehead, expansive as it was, an\nobserving eye could read his character. Cimourdain had an abrupt way\nof speaking, at once passionate and solemn; his utterance was rapid,\nhis tone peremptory, the expression of his mouth sad and bitter; his\neyes were clear and deep, and his whole face bore the impress of an\nunspeakable indignation. Such was Cimourdain.\n\nTo-day his name is unknown.\n\nHistory possesses these terrible incognitos.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nA CORNER NOT DIPPED INTO THE STYX.\n\n\nWas such a man in very deed a man? Could the servant of all men feel a\npersonal affection? Was he not too much of a soul to possess a heart?\nThat vast embrace, enfolding everything and everybody, could it be\nlimited to one? Could Cimourdain love? We answer, yes.\n\nIn his youth, when he was a tutor in an almost princely family, he\nhad a pupil, the son and heir of the house, whom he loved. It is easy\nto love a child. What is there that one cannot forgive a child? One\nforgives him for being a lord, a prince, a king. His innocent age and\nhis weakness make one forget the crimes of his race and the arrogance\nof his rank. He is so little that one pardons him for being great,\nthe slave forgives him for being the master. The old negro idolizes\nthe white nursling. Cimourdain had conceived a passionate love for\nhis pupil. Childhood is so ineffably charming, it absorbs all love.\nAll the power of loving in Cimourdain's nature had, so to speak,\nconcentrated itself upon that child; the heart, condemned to solitude,\nfed upon this sweet and innocent creature, which it loved with the\ncombined tenderness of a father, a brother, a friend, and a creator. To\nhim he was indeed a son,--not of the flesh, but of the soul; he was not\nhis father, the author of his being, but he was his master, and this\nwas his masterpiece. He had made a man of this little lord,--possibly a\ngreat man, who knows? Thus run our dreams. Without the knowledge of the\nfamily,--for does one require permission to create an intelligence, a\nwell-directed will, and an upright character?--he had communicated to\nthe young viscount, his pupil, all the advanced ideas that he himself\nheld; he had inoculated him with the dread virus of his own virtue; he\nhad infused into his veins his belief, his conscience, his ideal; into\nthe brain of this aristocrat, as into a mould, he had poured the soul\nof the people. Mind seeks nourishment; intelligence is a breast. There\nis an analogy between the nurse who gives her milk and the tutor who\ngives his thought. Sometimes the tutor is more of a father than the\nactual father himself, just as the nurse is more like a mother than\nthe natural mother. Cimourdain was closely bound to his pupil by the\nprofound paternity of the soul. The very sight of the child touched him.\n\nLet us add this: it was an easy matter to replace the father, since the\nchild had none, he was an orphan; his father and mother were both dead;\nthere was only a blind grandmother, and a great-uncle who did not live\nat home to watch over him. The grandmother died; the great-uncle, who\nwas the head of the family, was a military man, a member of the high\nnobility, who held various appointments at Court; he avoided the old\nfamily dungeon, living at Versailles, changing his quarters with the\narmy, and leaving the orphan alone in the solitary castle. Thus the\npreceptor was the master in every sense of the word. Furthermore, let\nus add, Cimourdain had witnessed the birth of his pupil. When almost\na baby, the child had a serious illness; during the crisis Cimourdain\nhad watched over him night and day. The doctor prescribes, but it is\nthe nurse who saves, and Cimourdain had saved the child. Not only was\nhis pupil indebted to him for his instruction, his education, and his\nknowledge, he also owed him his convalescence and his health; over\nand above the development of his mind he owed him his very life. We\nworship those who are indebted to us for everything; hence Cimourdain\nworshipped the child.\n\nIn the course of time the natural separation between them took place.\nHaving finished his education, Cimourdain was obliged to leave the\nchild, who had now become a young man. With what cold and careless\ncruelty such separations are planned! How calmly do families discharge\nthe tutor, who leaves his soul behind him with the child, and the\nnurse who leaves her heart's blood! Cimourdain, having received his\nsalary and his dismissal, had left the higher for the lower sphere;\nthe partition that separates the great from the little had closed\nonce more. The young lord, an officer by birth, received a captain's\ncommission at the outset, and had departed to join some garrison. The\nhumble tutor, already a rebellious priest in his secret heart, had lost\nno time in returning to the obscure ground-floor of the church, among\nthe inferior clergy, and thus lost sight of his pupil.\n\nRevolution came. The recollection still brooding within him of that\ncreature whom he had transformed into a man was by no means lost,\nalthough buried beneath the immense accumulation of public affairs.\n\nIt is a noble deed to model a statue and breathe into it the breath of\nlife; but to mould an intelligence and inspire it with the spirit of\ntruth is far nobler. Cimourdain was the Pygmalion of a soul.\n\nThe mind may possess its offspring.\n\nThe only being on earth whom he loved was this pupil,--child and orphan\nas he was. Is such a man vulnerable to the influence of any affection\nwhatsoever? We shall see.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: A pan meaning a Turkish republic, and the republic\nexpelled.--TR.]\n\n\n[Illustration: Le cabaret de la Rue de Paon 041]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II.\n\n\nTHE POT-HOUSE OF THE RUE DU PAON\n\n\nI.\n\n\nMINOS, \u00c3\u0086ACUS, AND RHADAMANTHUS.\n\n\n[Illustration 042]\n\n\nIn the Rue du Paon there was an ale-house called by courtesy a caf\u00c3\u00a9,\nand in this caf\u00c3\u00a9 a back-room which has since become famous in history.\nIt was there that from time to time those men, so powerful and so\nclosely watched that they dared not venture to speak to one another in\npublic, held their secret meetings.\n\nIt was there, on the 23d day of October, 1792, that the Mountain and\nthe Gironde exchanged their famous kiss. There, too, Garat--although\nhe does not admit it in his memoirs--came for information during that\nrueful night when, after having placed Clavi\u00c3\u00a8re in safety in the Rue\nde Beaune, he stopped his carriage on the Pont-Royal to listen to the\ntocsin. On the 28th of June, 1793, in this back-room, three men were\ngathered around a table. Their chairs did not touch. Each man occupied\none of the three sides of the table, leaving the fourth one vacant. It\nwas about eight o'clock in the evening. Although it was still light\nin the street, the back-room was dark, and a lamp--a luxury in those\ntimes--hanging from the ceiling threw its light upon the table. The\nfirst of those men was pale, young, and grave, with thin lips and a\ncold unsympathetic expression. There was a nervous twitching in his\ncheek, which must have been a drawback to the act of smiling. He was\npowdered and gloved, and his well-brushed and carefully-buttoned\nlight-blue coat fitted him without a wrinkle. He wore nankeen breeches,\nwhite stockings, a high cravat, a plaited shirt-frill, and silver\nbuckles on his shoes. Of the two other men, one was, so to speak, a\ngiant, the other a dwarf. The tall man was negligently dressed in a\nloose coat of scarlet, with his neck bare, and a half-untied cravat\nhanging carelessly below his shirt-frill; his waistcoat was unfastened\nfor want of buttons; he wore top-boots; and his hair, although\ndishevelled and bristling, still showed signs of former dressing;\nhis wig looked very much like a mane, and his face was marked by the\nsmall-pox. Between his eyebrows was a line betokening a fierce temper,\nand at the corner of his mouth another, rather suggestive of a kindly\nnature. His lips were thick, his teeth large; he had the fist of a\nporter, and flashing eyes. The short personage was a yellow-looking\nman, who when seated had the effect of one deformed. His head was\nthrown back, his eyes blood-shot; livid patches covered his face; a\nhandkerchief was tied over his straight, greasy hair; no forehead to\nspeak of, but a monstrous and terrible mouth. He wore long trousers,\nslippers, a waistcoat that seemed originally to have been made of\nwhite satin, and over it a loose jacket, in the folds of which a hard\nstraight line revealed the presence of a poniard. The first of these\nmen was Robespierre, the second Danton, the third Marat.\n\nThey were alone in this room. Before Danton stood a bottle of wine\ncovered with dust,--reminding one of Luther's half pint of beer,--a cup\nof coffee before Marat, and papers were spread in front of Robespierre.\n\nNear the papers stood one of those round, heavy, ridged, leaden\ninkstands, which will be remembered by all who were schoolboys at the\nbeginning of this century, and a pen had been thrown down beside it.\nA large brass seal bearing the words \"Palloy fecit,\" and representing\nan exact miniature model of the Bastille, rested upon these papers. A\nmap of France lay outspread in the middle of the table. Outside the\ndoor stood Marat's watchdog, one Laurent Basse, the same who was an\nagent at No. 18 Rue des Cordeliers, and who on the 13th of July, nearly\na fortnight after this 28th of June, was to deal a blow with a chair\nupon the head of a woman named Charlotte Corday, who at this time was\nvaguely dreaming at Caen. Laurent Basse was the proof-carrier of \"L'Ami\ndu Peuple.\" On that evening, having been brought by his master to the\ncaf\u00c3\u00a9 of the Rue du Paon, he was ordered to keep the room closed where\nMarat, Danton, and Robespierre were seated, and to admit no one, unless\nit were some person from the Committee of Public Safety, the Commune,\nor the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nRobespierre would not have it closed against Saint-Just, neither would\nDanton refuse admittance to Pache, or Marat to Gusman.\n\nThe subject of the conference, which had already lasted a long time,\nlay in the papers spread out on the table, which Robespierre had been\nreading aloud. The voices were gradually rising higher and higher.\nSomething very like anger was developing between these three men.\nFrom without one could catch, from time to time, fragments of excited\nspeech. In those days the custom of public tribunals seemed to have\ncreated a certain right to listen. It was at the time when the copying\nclerk, Fabricius P\u00c3\u00a2ris, watched through the key-hole the proceedings\nof the Committee of Public Safety; not an act of supererogation, be it\nobserved, for it was this very P\u00c3\u00a2ris who notified Danton on the night\nof the 31st of March, 1794. Laurent Basse had his ear at the door of\nthe back-room in which Danton, Marat, and Robespierre were seated; he\nserved Marat, but he belonged to the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nMAGNA TESTANTUR VOCE PER UMBRAS.\n\n\nDanton had just risen, pushing back his chair impetuously. \"Listen!\" he\ncried. \"There is but one urgent business,--the Republic is in danger. I\nhave but a single purpose, that is, to deliver France from the enemy.\nAnd to accomplish this, all means are fair. All! All! All! I have to\ndeal with every form of danger. I employ every variety of expedient,\nand when all is to be feared, then I venture all. My thought is a\nlioness. No half measures, no squeamishness in revolution. Nemesis\nis not a haughty prude. Let us make ourselves terrible and likewise\nuseful. Does the elephant stop to see where he puts his foot? Let us\ncrush the enemy.\"\n\nRobespierre replied mildly,--\n\n\"I am willing.\"\n\nThen he added,--\n\n\"The question is, to learn the whereabouts of the enemy.\"\n\n\"He is without, and it is I who have driven him there,\" said Danton.\n\n\"He is within, and I am watching him,\" said Robespierre.\n\n\"I will drive him out again,\" replied Danton.\n\n\"One cannot so easily expel an internal enemy.\"\n\n\"What, then, is to be done?\"\n\n\"He must be exterminated.\"\n\n\"I agree to that,\" said Danton, in his turn.\n\nAnd he continued,--\n\n\"But I tell you he is outside, Robespierre.\"\n\n\"And I tell you that he is within, Danton.\"\n\n\"Robespierre, he is on the frontier.\"\n\n\"He is in the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, Danton.\"\n\n\"Calm yourselves,\" remarked a third voice; \"he is everywhere, and you\nare lost.\"\n\nIt was Marat who spoke.\n\nRobespierre looked at Marat, and quietly retorted,--\n\n\"A truce to generalizations. Let us come to particulars. Here are the\nfacts.\"\n\n\"Pedant!\" growled Marat.\n\nPlacing his hand on the paper spread out before him, Robespierre\ncontinued:--\n\n\"I have just read you the despatches of Prieur de la Marne, and also\ncommunicated the information given by G\u00c3\u00a9lambre. Listen, Danton; foreign\nwar is as nothing compared with the dangers of civil war. A foreign war\nis like a scratch on the elbow, but civil war is an ulcer which eats\naway your liver. Here is the sum and substance of all that I have just\nread to you: the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, which has hitherto been divided among many\nchiefs, is about to concentrate its forces. Henceforth it is to have\none leader--\"\n\n\"A sort of central brigand,\" muttered Danton.\n\n\"It is the man who landed near Pontorson on the 2d of June. You have\nseen what he is. Observe, that this landing was contemporary with the\narrest of the representatives, Prieur de la C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Or and Romme, at\nBayeux, by that treacherous district of Calvados, which took place on\nthe very same day, the 2d of June.\"\n\n\"And their transfer to the castle of Caen,\" said Danton.\n\nRobespierre replied:--\n\n\"I will proceed to sum up the despatches. They are organizing the\nwarfare of the forest on a vast scale. At the same time an English\ninvasion is in preparation,--Vendeans and Englishmen; Brittany joining\nhands with Britain. The Hurons of Finist\u00c3\u00a8re speak the same language\nas the Topinambes of Cornwall. I showed you an intercepted letter of\nPuisaye, where he says that 'twenty thousand red coats distributed\namong the insurgents will be the means of raising one hundred thousand\nmore.' When the peasant insurrection is fully organized, the English\ndescent will take place. Here is the plan; follow it on the map.\" And\nputting his finger on the map, Robespierre continued:--\n\n\"The English have the choice of landing place, from Cancale to Paimpol.\nCraig would prefer the Bay of Saint-Brieuc, Cornwallis the Bay of\nSaint-Cast. But this is simply a matter of detail. The left shore\nof the Loire is guarded by the rebel Vendean army, and as to the\ntwenty-eight miles of open country between Ancenis and Pontorson, forty\nNorman parishes have promised their assistance. The descent will be\nmade at three points, Pl\u00c3\u00a9rin, Iffiniac, and Pl\u00c3\u00a9neuf; from Pl\u00c3\u00a9rin they\nwill go to Saint-Brieuc, and from Pl\u00c3\u00a9neuf to Lamballe; on the second\nday they intend to reach Dinan, where there are nine hundred English\nprisoners, thus simultaneously occupying Saint-Jouan and Saint-M\u00c3\u00a9en,\nwhere they, are to leave the cavalry; on the third day two columns\nwill march,--one to Jouan on B\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9e, the other to Dinan on Becherel,\na natural fortress, and where they propose to set up two batteries;\non the fourth day they expect to be at Rennes, which is the key to\nBrittany. Whoever has Rennes is master of the situation. Rennes once\ntaken, Ch\u00c3\u00a2teauneuf and Saint-Malo are sure to fall. There are one\nmillion cartridges and fifty field-pieces at Rennes.\"\n\n\"Which they will sweep away,\" muttered Danton.\n\nRobespierre continued:--\n\n\"To conclude. From Rennes three columns will descend, one upon\nFoug\u00c3\u00a8res, and the second and third upon Vitr\u00c3\u00a9 and Redon. As the bridges\nare destroyed, the enemy will be provided, as has already been stated,\nwith pontoons and planks, and they will also have guides for such\nplaces as are fordable by cavalry. From Foug\u00c3\u00a8res they will diverge to\nAvranches, from Redon to Ancenis, from Vitr\u00c3\u00a9 to Laval. Nantes will\nsurrender, Brest likewise. Redon opens the way to Vilaine, as Foug\u00c3\u00a8res\nto Normandy and Vitr\u00c3\u00a9 to Paris. In fifteen days they will have a\nbrigand army of three hundred thousand men, and the whole of Brittany\nwill belong to the King of France.\"\n\n\"You mean to the King of England,\" said Danton. \"No, to the King of\nFrance,\" replied Robespierre, adding: \"the King of France is worse; it\ntakes fifteen days to expel a foreign foe, and eighteen hundred years\nto destroy a monarchy.\"\n\nDanton, who had reseated himself with his elbows resting on the table,\nsupported hip head on his hands and remained buried in thought.\n\n\"You perceive the danger,\" said Robespierre. \"Vitr\u00c3\u00a9 opens for the\nEnglish the way to Paris.\"\n\nRaising his head, Danton brought his two clenched fists down upon the\nmap as though it were an anvil.\n\n\"Robespierre, did not Verdun open the way to Paris for the Prussians?\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Well, we will drive the English as we drove the Prussians.\"\n\nAnd Danton rose again.\n\nRobespierre placed his cold hand on Danton's burning wrist.\n\n\"Danton, Champagne did not take sides with the Prussians, as Brittany\ndoes with the English. Retaking Verdun was foreign war; but to\nrecapture Vitr\u00c3\u00a9 will be civil war.\"\n\nAnd Robespierre murmured in a cold, sepulchral tone,--\n\n\"A serious difference.\"\n\nThen he continued,--\n\n\"Sit down, Danton, and look at the map, instead of battering it with\nyour fists.\"\n\nBut Danton was wholly carried away with his own ideas.\n\n\"Well, this goes beyond everything!\" he exclaimed; \"to be on the alert\nfor a catastrophe in the west, when it is actually in the east! I\ngrant you, Robespierre, that England looms up on the ocean; but Spain\nrises from behind the Pyrenees, Italy from the Alps, Germany from\nthe Rhine, and the big Russian bear is behind them all. Robespierre,\ndanger surrounds us like a circle, and we are in its centre. Coalition\nabroad, treason at home. In the south, Servant holds the door of\nFrance ajar for the King of Spain; in the north, Dumouriez goes over\nto the enemy. However, he always threatened Holland less than Paris.\nNerwinde has wiped out Jemmapes and Valmy. The philosopher Rabaut\nSaint-\u00c3\u0089tienne, a traitor, like the Protestant he is, corresponds with\nthe courtier Montesquiou. The army is decimated. No battalion has\nnow over four hundred men, and the brave regiment of Deux-Ponts is\nreduced to one hundred and fifty; the camp of Pamars has surrendered;\nGivet has but five hundred bags of flour left. We are falling back\non Landau; Wurmser presses Kl\u00c3\u00a9ber; Mayence makes a valiant defence;\nCond\u00c3\u00a9 yields ignobly, and Valenciennes likewise, but this in no way\nalters the fact that their defenders F\u00c3\u00a9raud and Chancel are two heroes,\nnot to mention Meunier, who defended Mayence; but all the others\nare betraying us. Dharville plays the traitor at Aix-la-Chapelle,\nMouton at Brussels, Valence at Br\u00c3\u00a9da, Neuilly at Limbourg, Miranda\nat Ma\u00c3\u00abstricht; Stengel, Lanoue, Ligonnier, Menou, Dillon, traitors\nall,--hideous coin of Dumouriez. Examples are needed. I am suspicious\nof Custine's countermarches. I am inclined to believe that he preferred\nthe lucrative capture of Frankfort to the more useful one of Coblentz.\nSuppose that Frankfort is able to pay a war indemnity of four\nmillions,--what is that in comparison with crushing a nest of \u00c3\u0089migr\u00c3\u00a9s?\nI call it treason. Meunier died on the 13th of June, and Kl\u00c3\u00a9ber is\nnow alone. Meanwhile Brunswick gains strength and marches onward.\nHe raises the German flag in every French place that he captures.\nThe Margrave of Brandenburg is to-day the arbiter of Europe; he is\npocketing our provinces; you will soon see him appropriating Belgium;\none might think that we were working for Berlin; and if this continues,\nand we take no means to prevent it, the French Revolution will result\nin the aggrandizement of Potsdam. Its chief consequence will be the\nadvancement of the little State of Frederick II., and we shall have\nkilled the King of France for the benefit of the King of Prussia.\"\n\n[Illustration 043]\n\nHere Danton, terrible in his wrath, burst into a fit of laughter, which\nmade Marat smile.\n\n\"You have each your hobby. Yours, Danton, is Prussia, and yours,\nRobespierre, is the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e. I will also mention a few facts. You\ndo not see the real danger which is centred in the caf\u00c3\u00a9s and the\ngaming-houses: the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Choiseul is Jacobin; the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Patin,\nroyalist; the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Rendez-Vous attacks the National Guard, and the Caf\u00c3\u00a9\nde la Porte Saint-Martin defends it; the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de la R\u00c3\u00a9gence is opposed\nto Brissot, the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Corazza favors him; the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Procope swears by\nDiderot, and the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 du Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais by Voltaire; at the Rotonde\nthey tear up the assignats; the Caf\u00c3\u00a9s Saint-Marceau are in a state of\nperfect fury; the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Manouri is agitating the flour problem; at the\nCaf\u00c3\u00a9 de Foy there is a perpetual racket and brawling, and at the Perron\nthe hornets of finance are buzzing. All this is a serious matter.\"\n\n[Illustration 044]\n\nDanton no longer laughed, but Marat still continued to smile. The smile\nof a dwarf is worse than the laugh of a giant.\n\n\"Are you sneering, Marat?\" growled Danton.\n\n[Illustration 045]\n\nMarat twitched his hip convulsively,--that motion peculiar to himself\nwhich has been so often described,--and his smile died away.\n\n\"Ah, I recognize you, Citizen Danton. You are the man who in full\nconvention called me 'that individual Marat.' Listen: I forgive you.\nWe are in times when men play the fool. Sneering, did you say? What\nkind of a man do you think I am? I have denounced Chazot, P\u00c3\u00a9tion,\nKersaint, Mouton, Dufriche-Valaz\u00c3\u00a9, Ligonnier, Menou, Banneville,\nGensonn\u00c3\u00a9, Biron, Lidon, and Chambon. Was I wrong? I scent the treason\nof the traitor before the deed is done, and I find it useful to\ndenounce the criminal in advance. It is my habit to say in the evening\nwhat the rest of you say the next day. I am the man who proposed to\nthe Assembly a complete scheme for criminal legislation. What have I\ndone up to the present moment? I asked to have the sections instructed\nthat they might be disciplined for revolution; I had the seals of\nthirty-two boxes broken; I reclaimed the diamonds placed in the hands\nof Roland; I proved that the Brissotins had given to the Committee of\nGeneral Safety blank warrants; I noted certain omissions in Lindet's\nreport concerning the crimes of Capet; I voted for the execution\nof the tyrant in the course of twenty-four hours; I defended the\nbattalions of Mauconseil and the R\u00c3\u00a9publicain; I prevented the reading\nof Narbonne's and Malouet's letters; I motioned in favor of the wounded\nsoldiers; I caused the suppression of the Committee of Six; I foresaw\nthe treason of Dumouriez in the affair of Mons; I demanded to have one\nhundred thousand relatives of the refugees taken as hostages for the\ncommissioners delivered to the enemy; I proposed to declare traitor\nany representative who crossed the frontier; I unmasked the faction\nof Roland in the disturbances at Marseilles; I insisted that a price\nshould be set on the head of \u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9's son; I defended Bouchotte; I\ncalled for a nominal vote to expel Isnard from the chair.\n\n[Illustration 046]\n\nIt was I who instigated the declaration that Parisians had deserved\nwell of their country; that is why Louvet calls me a dancing puppet,\nand why Finist\u00c3\u00a8re demands my expulsion. For this the city of Loudun\nwishes me to be exiled, and the city of Amiens proposes to muzzle\nme, Coburg requires my arrest, and Lecointe-Puiraveau suggests to\nthe Convention that it would be well to pronounce me insane. Bah!\nCitizen Danton, why did you ask me to come to your Conventicle if\nyou did not wish for my advice? Did I ask permission to belong to\nit? Far from it. I have no inclination for a t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate with such\ncounter-revolutionists as Robespierre and yourself. However, I might\nhave expected this. You have not understood me,--neither you nor\nRobespierre. Are there then no statesmen here? You need a spelling\nlesson in politics, and some one to dot your _i_'s for you. This is\nthe meaning of what I told you,--you are both mistaken. The danger\ncomes neither from London nor from Berlin, as you two believe. It is\nin Paris. It is in the absence of unity; in the right of every man to\npull his own way, beginning with you yourselves; in the levelling of\nintellects; in the anarchy of will--\"\n\n[Illustration 047]\n\n\"Anarchy!\" interrupted Danton. \"Who is it that causes anarchy if not\nyourself?\"\n\nMarat paid no attention.\n\n\"Robespierre, Danton, the danger is in this multitude of caf\u00c3\u00a9s, in\nthese countless gaming-houses, this crowd of clubs,--Club des Noirs,\nClub des F\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s, Club des Dames, Club des Impartiaux (which dates\nfrom Clermont-Tonnerre, and which was the Monarchical Club of 1790,--a\nsocial circle originated by the priest Claude Fauchet), the Club des\nBonnets de Laine, founded by the journalist Prudhomme, etc.; without\ncounting your Jacobin Club, Robespierre, and your Club of Cordeliers,\nDanton. The danger is in the famine that made the porte-sacs Blin\nhang Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Denis, the baker of Palu market, to the lamp-post of\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, and likewise in the justice that hung porte-sacs\nBlin for hanging baker Denis. The danger lies in the depreciation of\nthe currency. One day on the Rue du Temple an assignat of a hundred\nfrancs fell to the ground, and a passer-by, a man of the lower class,\nremarked, 'It is not worth while to pick it up.' The danger comes from\nthe stock-brokers and the monopolists. Fine progress we have made when\nwe hoist the black flag over the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville! You have arrested\nBaron Trenck; but that is not sufficient. I want to see you wring the\nneck of that old prison intriguer. Do you think that the business is\naccomplished because the President of the Convention places a civic\ncrown on the head of Labert\u00c3\u00a8che, who received forty-one sabre-thrusts\nat Jemmapes, and of whom Ch\u00c3\u00a9nier makes himself the showman? Comedies\nand idle shows! Ah, you take no heed of Paris! You are looking for\ndanger at a distance, when it is close at hand. Of what use are your\npolice, Robespierre? You have your spies,--Payan in the Commune,\nCoffinhal at the Revolutionary Tribunal, David in the Committee of\nPublic Safety, Couthon in the Committee of Public Well-being. You\nperceive that I am well informed. Now, then, learn this: The danger\nis hanging over your heads and rising beneath your feet. Conspiracies!\nconspiracies! conspiracies! The people passing along the streets read\nthe papers to one another, and nod their heads significantly; six\nthousand men having no civic papers--the returned \u00c3\u0089migr\u00c3\u00a9s, Muscadins,\nand Mathevons--are hidden in the cellars and garrets and in the wooden\ngalleries of the Palais Royal; they are ranged in files in front of the\nbake-shops; women stand on the door-sills, and clasping their hands,\ncry, 'When shall we have peace?' It is of no use to close the doors\nof the Executive Committee against the public. Every word you utter\nis known; and as a proof, Robespierre, I will repeat the words you\nspoke last night to Saint-Just: 'Barbaroux's paunch grows apace; that\nwill inconvenience him in his flight.' Danger, I tell you, lurks on\nevery side, but chiefly in the centre. In Paris, while the ci-devants\nare weaving their plots the patriots go barefoot; the aristocrats\narrested on the 9th of March are already released; the fine private\nhorses that bespatter us with mud in the streets ought to be harnessed\nto the cannons on the frontier; a loaf of bread weighing four pounds\nis sold for three francs and twelve sous; indecent plays are given on\nthe stage; and Robespierre will sooner or later send Danton to the\nguillotine.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" exclaimed Danton.\n\nRobespierre was attentively studying the map.\n\n\"What we need is a dictator!\" cried Marat, fiercely. \"You know,\nRobespierre, that I want a dictator.\"\n\nRobespierre raised his head. \"Yes, I know, Marat, it must be either you\nor I.\"\n\n\"I or you, you mean,\" retorted Marat.\n\n\"The dictatorship,--I advise you to try it!\" grumbled Danton between\nhis closed teeth.\n\nMarat perceived Danton's frown.\n\n\"Stop,\" he said. \"Let us make one last effort to come to an agreement.\nThe situation is well worth it. Was there not an understanding for the\n31st of May? The question of mutual agreement is even more important\nthan Girondism, which is a matter of detail. There is a certain amount\nof truth in your statements; but truth itself, the whole truth, the\nreal truth, lies in, I say, Federalism in the south, Royalism in the\nWest, a deadly struggle between the Convention and the Commune in\nParis, and on the frontier the backsliding of Custine and the treason\nof Dumouriez. What will be the result? The end will be nothing less\nthan dismemberment. And what do we require? Unity. Therein lies our\nsalvation. But we have no time to lose. Paris must undertake the\ncontrol of the Revolution. If we waste one hour, the Vendeans may be\nin Orleans to-morrow, and the Prussians in Paris. I grant one thing to\nyou, Danton, and another to Robespierre. So be it. And the conclusion\nmust be dictatorship. Let us, we three who represent the Revolution,\ngrasp the dictatorship. We are the three heads of Cerberus. One is a\ntalking head, and that is you, Robespierre; the second head does the\nroaring, and that is you, Danton--\"\n\n\"And the other bites, and that is you, Marat,\" said Danton.\n\n\"All three bite,\" said Robespierre.\n\nFor a time there was silence; then this dialogue full of gloomy and\nviolent utterances proceeded.\n\n\"Listen, Marat; people should know each other before they marry. How\ndid you find out what I said to Saint-Just yesterday?\"\n\n\"That is my affair, Robespierre.\"\n\n\"Marat!\"\n\n\"It is my duty to gain information.\"\n\n\"Marat!\"\n\n\"I like to know what is going on.\"\n\n\"Marat!\"\n\n\"Robespierre, I know what you say to Saint-Just, as I know what Danton\nsays to Lacroix; I know what happens on the quay of the Th\u00c3\u00a9atins, at\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel Labriffe, a den frequented by the nymphs of the Emigration,\nas well as I know what is going on at the house of Thilles, near\nGonesse, which now belongs to Valmerange, the former administrator\nof the postal service, where Maury and Cazal\u00c3\u00a8s were in the habit of\ngoing,--a house which Siey\u00c3\u00a8s and Vergniaud have since frequented, and\nwhere at the present time a certain person goes once a week.\"\n\nIn saying a certain person, Marat looked significantly at Danton.\n\n\"If I had but two farthings' worth of power, this would be terrible,\"\ncried Danton.\n\n[Illustration 048]\n\n\"I know what you say, Robespierre,\" continued Marat, \"just as I knew\nwhat was going on in the tower of the Temple when they were fattening\nLouis XVI.; and the wolf, the she-wolf, and the cubs, during the month\nof September alone, devoured eighty-six baskets of peaches. At that\ntime the nation was starving. I know it, as I know that Roland was\nconcealed in a lodging looking out on a back-yard, in the Rue de la\nHarpe; as I know that six hundred pikes used on the 14th of July were\nmanufactured by Faure, the locksmith of the Duke of Orleans; as I know\nwhat they do at the house of Saint-Hilaire, the mistress of Sillery.\nOn the days when there is to be a ball, old Sillery himself chalks the\nparquet floors of the yellow salon in the Rue Neuve-des-Mathurins;\nBuzot and Kersaint dined there; Saladin dined there on the 27th, and\nwith whom do you guess, Robespierre? With your friend Lasource.\"\n\n\"Idle talk,\" muttered Robespierre; \"Lasource is not my friend.\"\n\nHe added thoughtfully,--\n\n\"In the mean time there are eighteen manufactories of false assignats\nin London.\"\n\nMarat went on in a voice calm but somewhat tremulous, an ominous sign\nwith him,--\n\n\"You are the faction of the All-Importants. Yes, I know everything, in\nspite of what Saint-Just calls the silence of State--\"\n\nMarat emphasized this word, looked at Robespierre, and continued:--\n\n\"I know the conversation that takes place at your table on the days\nwhen Lebas invites David to eat the food prepared by his betrothed,\n\u00c3\u0089lisabeth Duplay, your future sister-in-law, Robespierre. I am the\nall-seeing eye of the people, and from the depths of my cave I observe.\nYes, I hear, I see, and I know. You are contented with small things.\nYou admire yourself. Robespierre shows himself off before his Madame de\nChalabre, the daughter of the Marquis who played whist with Louis XV.\non the evening of Damiens' execution. Yes, heads are carried high in\nthese days. Saint-Just never unbends; Legendre is a scrupulous devotee\nto fashion, with his new frock-coat and white waistcoat, and a frill,\nthat people may forget his apron. Robespierre imagines that history\nwill be interested to know that he wore an olive-colored coat _\u00c3\u00a0 la\nConstitution_, and a sky-blue coat _\u00c3\u00a0 la Convention._ He hangs his\nportrait on every wall around his room--\"\n\nRobespierre interrupted him in a voice even more quiet than that of\nMarat himself:--\n\n\"And you drag yours through all the sewers, Marat.\"\n\nThey continued this conversation in tones whose very deliberation\nemphasized the violence of the attacks and retorts, and added a certain\nirony to the implied threats.\n\n\"Robespierre, you called those who are in favor of the abolition of\nmonarchy the Don Quixotes of mankind.\"\n\n\"And you, Marat, after the 4th of August, in No. 559 of your 'Ami du\nPeuple,'--you see, I remember the number, a useful item,--you requested\nto have the titles of the nobles restored to them. You said: 'Once a\nDuke, always a Duke.'\"\n\n\"Robespierre, in the session of the 7th of December you defended\nRoland's wife against Viard.\"\n\n\"Just as my brother defended you, Marat, when you were attacked at the\nJacobins'. What does that prove? Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Robespierre! we all know the cabinet at the Tuileries where you said\nto Garas: 'I am tired of the Revolution.'\"\n\n\"Marat, in this very ale-house, on the 20th of October, you embraced\nBarbaroux.\"\n\n\"And you said to Buzot, Robespierre, 'What does the Republic signify?'\"\n\n\"Marat, you invited three men from Marseilles to breakfast with you\nhere in this ale-house.\"\n\n\"Robespierre, you go about escorted by a strong fellow from the market\narmed with a club.\"\n\n\"And you, Marat, on the eve of the 10th of August,--you asked Buzot to\nassist you in escaping to Marseilles disguised as a jockey.\"\n\n\"During the prosecutions of September you took good care to hide\nyourself, Robespierre.\"\n\n\"And you, Marat, were not backward in making a display of yourself.\"\n\n\"Robespierre, you flung the red cap on the ground.\"\n\n\"Yes, when a traitor hoisted it. Dumouriez defiles Robespierre.\"\n\n\"Robespierre, you refused to throw a veil over the head of Louis XVI.\nwhen Chateauvieux' soldiers were passing.\"\n\n\"I did better than veil his head; I cut it off.\"\n\nDanton interposed, but it was like pouring oil upon the flames.\n\n\"Robespierre, Marat, calm yourselves,\" he said. Marat did not like to\nbe mentioned in the second place. He turned round.\n\n\"What affair is this of Danton?\"\n\n\"What affair of mine? I will tell you. There must be no fratricides;\nwe must have no strife between two men, both of whom serve the people.\nIt is enough to have to deal with foreign and civil wars, and it would\nbe too much if we were to have a family conflict. It is I who made the\nRevolution, and I do not choose to have it destroyed. This is why I\nfeel called upon to interfere.\"\n\nMarat replied, without raising his voice,--\n\n\"You had better be attending to the settlement of your own accounts.\"\n\n\"My accounts!\" cried Danton. \"Go ask for them in the passes of Argonne,\nin Champagne delivered, in Belgium conquered, in the armies where I\nhave exposed my breast four times already to the grape-shot! Inquire in\nthe Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution, on the scaffold of the 21st of January, of\nthe throne lying on the ground, of the guillotine, that widow--\"\n\nHere Marat broke forth, interrupting Danton,--\n\n\"The guillotine is a virgin who gives death unto men, but not life.\"\n\n\"What do you know about it? I will make her fruitful.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\nAnd he smiled.\n\nDanton saw the smile.\n\n\"Marat,\" he cried, \"you are the man who prefers to hide; I am a man who\nrejoices in broad daylight, in the open air. I despise the life of a\nreptile. It would not suit me to be a woodlouse. You live in a cave; I\nlive in the street. You hold no communication with mankind; the chance\npasser-by may see and speak with me.\"\n\n\"Handsome youth! Will you ascend to my abode?\" growled Marat.\n\nAnd no longer smiling, he continued in a peremptory tone:--\n\n\"Danton, give an account of the thirty-three thousand crowns cash, that\nwere paid you by that Montmorin in the name of the king, under the\npretext of indemnifying you for the post of solicitor of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet.\"\n\n\"I belonged to the 14th of July,\" said Danton, haughtily.\n\n\"And the Garde-meuble? And the crown diamonds?\"\n\n\"I was also of the 6th of October.\"\n\n\"And the thefts of your _alter ego_, Lacroix, in Belgium?\"\n\n\"I was of the 20th of June.\"\n\n\"And the loans to Montansier?\"\n\n\"I influenced the people to bring about the return from Varennes.\"\n\n\"And the Opera House built with the money that you furnished?\"\n\n\"I armed the sections of Paris.\"\n\n\"And the hundred thousand livres in secret funds of the Minist\u00c3\u00a8re de la\nJustice?\"\n\n\"The 10th of August was my work.\"\n\n\"And the two millions secret expenses of the Assembly, a quarter of\nwhich fell to your share?\"\n\n\"I arrested the progress of the enemy, and barred the road to the\nallied kings.\"\n\n\"Prostitute!\" cried Marat.\n\nDanton was terrible in his wrath.\n\n\"Yes,\" he cried; \"you have spoken the word! I have sold my virtue, but\nI saved the world!\"\n\nRobespierre meanwhile continued to bite his nails. He could neither\nlaugh nor smile. He possessed not the lightning-like laughter of\nDanton, nor the sting of Marat's smile.\n\nDanton continued,--\n\n\"I am like the ocean: I have my flood and ebb. When the tide is low you\ncan see the shoals; but at high tide you see only the waves.\"\n\n\"What one might call your froth,\" said Marat.\n\n\"My tempest, rather,\" replied Danton.\n\nThey both sprang to their feet, and Marat burst forth; the adder\nsuddenly assumed the shape of a dragon.\n\n\"Ah, Robespierre! ah, Danton!\" he exclaimed, \"you will not listen to\nme. I tell you, you are lost! Your policy brings you up against a wall!\nEvery issue is closed to you, and you go on committing deeds that will\nfinally leave you with no outlet save that of the grave.\"\n\n\"In that lies the very essence of our greatness,\" said Danton,\nshrugging his shoulders.\n\nMarat went on:--\n\n\"Danton, beware! Vergniaud has a wide mouth, thick lips, and frowning\nbrows, like yourself. He is also pitted, like you and Mirabeau. Yet\nthis did not prevent the 31st of May. Ah, you shrug your shoulders! A\nshrug of the shoulders has been known to cost a man his head. I tell\nyou, Danton, your loud voice, your loose cravat, your top-boots, your\nlate suppers, your ample pockets,--Louisette will have something to say\nabout all that.\"\n\nLouisette was Marat's pet name for the guillotine.\n\nHe continued:--\n\n\"And as for you, Robespierre, you are a Moderate; but that will avail\nyou nothing. Go on; powder and dress your hair, brush your clothes,\nplay the coxcomb, wear fine linen, be a model of propriety, frizzed\nand bedizened; sooner or later you will go to the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve; read\nBrunswick's proclamation, and make up your mind to be treated like the\nregicide Damiens, and you are arrayed in fine style to be drawn and\nquartered.\"\n\n\"Echo of Coblentz!\" muttered Robespierre between his teeth.\n\n\"Robespierre, I echo no one. I am the cry of the whole world. Ah, you\nare young, both of you! How old are you, Danton? Thirty-four. And you,\nRobespierre? Thirty-three. Well, as for myself, I have lived from\nthe beginning of time. I am the embodiment of the ancient misery of\nmankind. I am six thousand years old.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Danton; \"for six thousand years Cain has been\npreserved in hatred, like a toad in a stone. The stone breaks, and Cain\nleaps forth among men, to be known as Marat.\"\n\n\"Danton!\" cried Marat; and a livid glare shone in his eyes.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" said Danton.\n\nThus conversed these three terrible men,--conflicting thunderbolts!\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nA QUIVERING OF THE INMOST FIBRES.\n\n\n[Illustration 050]\n\n\nThe conversation ceased for a time. Each Titan betook himself to his\nown reflections.\n\nLions are disturbed by hydras. Robespierre had grown very pale, and\nDanton very much flushed. Both shuddered. Marat's wild glare had died\nout; calmness, imperious calmness, now rested on the face of that man,\nfeared by those who were themselves objects of awe.\n\nDanton felt himself conquered, but was unwilling to yield.\n\nHe continued,--\n\n\"Marat talks loudly of dictatorship and unity, possessing all the while\na talent for destroying.\"\n\nRobespierre opened his thin lips, and by way of supplementing Danton's\nspeech remarked,--\n\n\"I agree with Anacharsis Cloots. Give me neither Roland nor Marat.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Marat,--\"I say neither Danton nor Robespierre.\"\n\nHe gazed steadily at the two men, and then added:\n\n\"Let me advise you, Danton. You are in love, and think of marrying\nagain; let politics alone,--be wise.\"\n\nAnd taking a step towards the door, he was about to take his departure,\nwith the ominous salutation,--\n\n\"Farewell, gentlemen.\"\n\nDanton and Robespierre shuddered.\n\nAt that moment a voice was heard at the farther end of the room,\nsaying,--\n\n\"You are wrong, Marat.\"\n\nAll turned. During Marat's outbreak some one had entered, unperceived,\nthrough the door at the back of the room.\n\n\"Is that you, citizen Cimourdain?\" said Marat \"Good-day.\"\n\nIt was Cimourdain.\n\n\"I tell you that you are wrong, Marat,\" he repeated.\n\nMarat turned green, which was his way of growing pale, and Cimourdain\nadded:--\n\n\"You are useful, but Robespierre and Danton are indispensable. Why do\nyou threaten them? Let us have union, citizens. The people wish us to\nbe united.\"\n\nThis entrance was like a dash of cold water, or the arrival of a\nstranger upon the scene of a family quarrel; it produced a calming\neffect upon the surface, if it did not reach the depths.\n\nCimourdain advanced towards the table.\n\nBoth Danton and Robespierre knew him. They had often noticed, in the\npublic tribunals of the Convention, this obscure but influential man,\nwhom the people greeted with respect. Robespierre, however, always\nceremonious, inquired,--\n\n\"How did you get in, citizen?\"\n\n\"He belongs to the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9,\" replied Marat, in an unusually meek tone of\nvoice.\n\nMarat braved the Convention and led the Commune, but he feared the\n\u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThis is a law.\n\nMirabeau, in some mysterious far-away depth, is conscious of the\nexistence of Robespierre. Marat, too, is aware of H\u00c3\u00a9bert,--H\u00c3\u00a9bert\nof Babeuf. So long as the subterranean strata remain quiet, the\npolitician can move at his ease. But there is a sub-soil under the most\nrevolutionary, and the boldest men will quail when they feel beneath\ntheir feet the movement which they themselves have started overhead.\n\n[Illustration 051]\n\nTo be able to distinguish between the disturbance that springs from\ncovetousness and that which is founded on principle, to combat the\none and to aid the other, constitutes the genius and merit of great\nrevolutionists.\n\n\"Oh, citizen Cimourdain is not unwelcome,\" he said, as he extended his\nhand to Cimourdain, adding:\n\n\"Parbleu! Let us explain the situation to citizen Cimourdain. He comes\nin just in time. I represent the Mountain, Robespierre the Committee of\nPublic Safety, Marat the Commune; and Cimourdain represents the \u00c3\u0089v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9.\nHe will give us the casting vote.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" replied Cimourdain, in his serious and simple manner. \"What\nis the subject under consideration?\"\n\n\"The Vend\u00c3\u00a9e,\" replied Robespierre.\n\n\"The Vend\u00c3\u00a9e,\" echoed Cimourdain, then went on:\n\n\"There lies the great danger. If Revolution expires, the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e will\nhave given it its death-blow. One Vend\u00c3\u00a9e is more to be feared than ten\nGermanys. If France is to be saved, we must destroy the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e.\"\n\nThese words won Robespierre to his side; but still the latter put the\nquestion,--\n\n\"Were you not formerly a priest?\"\n\nFor the priestly aspect had not escaped his observation. He recognized\nin another what he had within himself.\n\n\"Yes, citizen,\" replied Cimourdain.\n\n\"What does that matter?\" cried Danton. \"When priests are good they\nare better than other men. In time of revolution priests are melted\ninto citizens, just as bells are melted into sous and cannon. Danjou\nand Danon are both priests. Thomas Lindet is Bishop of \u00c3\u0089vreux. At the\nConvention, Robespierre, you sit side by side with Massieu, Bishop\nof Beauvais. The Vicar-General Vaugeois belonged to the Insurrection\nCommittee of the 10th of August. Chabot is a capuchin. Dom Gerle\ndevised the oath of the Tennis-Court. The Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Audran declared the\nNational Assembly superior to the king; the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Goutte asked the\nLegislature to remove the da\u00c3\u00afs from the chair of Louis XVI., and the\nAbb\u00c3\u00a9 Gr\u00c3\u00a9goire instigated the abolition of royalty.\"\n\n\"A motion seconded by the comedian Collot d'Herbois. They two did the\nbusiness; the priest overturned the throne, the comedian deposed the\nking!\"\n\n\"Let us return to the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e,\" said Robespierre.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked Cimourdain; \"what is the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e doing now?\"\n\n\"This,\" replied Robespierre. \"It has found a leader; it will become\nterrible.\"\n\n\"Who is this leader, citizen Robespierre?\"\n\n\"He is a ci-devant Marquis de Lantenac, who styles himself a Breton\nprince.\"\n\nCimourdain made a movement.\n\n\"I know him,\" he said. \"I was chaplain at his house.\"\n\nHe reflected for a moment, and then continued:\n\n\"He was fond of women before he became active in military affairs.\"\n\n\"Like Biron, who was a Lauzun,\" said Danton. Cimourdain added\nthoughtfully,--\n\n\"Yes, formerly a man devoted to pleasure. He must be terrible.\"\n\n\"Frightful!\" said Robespierre. \"He burns villages, kills the wounded,\nmassacres prisoners, and shoots women.\"\n\n\"Women?\"\n\n\"Yes. Among others he ordered a woman to be shot who was the mother of\nthree children. No one knows what became of the children. Moreover, he\nis really a leader. He understands the art of warfare.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Cimourdain. \"When he was in the Hanoverian war the\nsoldiers used to say, 'Richelieu above, Lantenac below;' but the latter\nwas the actual general. Ask your colleague Dussaulx about it.\"\n\nRobespierre remained for a moment absorbed in thought; then the\nconversation between Cimourdain and himself was renewed.\n\n\"Well, citizen Cimourdain, this man is in the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e.\"\n\n\"How long since?\"\n\n\"Three weeks ago.\"\n\n\"He must be outlawed.\"\n\n\"That has been done.\"\n\n\"A price must be set upon his head.\"\n\n\"That also has been done.\"\n\n\"A large sum of money must be offered for his capture.\"\n\n\"The offer has been made,\"\n\n\"It must not be in assignats.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"But in gold.\"\n\n\"It has been so promised.\"\n\n\"And he must be guillotined.\"\n\n\"That shall be done.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By you!\"\n\n\"By me?\"\n\n\"Yes; you will be delegated by the Committee of Public Safety with\nample powers.\"\n\n\"I accept,\" said Cimourdain.\n\nRobespierre was rapid in his decisions,--a states-manlike quality. He\ntook from the portfolio that lay before him a sheet of white paper, at\nthe head of which the following words were printed: \"French Republic,\none and indivisible: Committee of Public Safety.\"\n\n\"I accept,\" continued Cimourdain. \"Let the terrible encounter the\nterrible. Lantenac is ferocious; I will be equally so. It shall be war\nunto death with that man; I shall rid the Republic of him, if it be\nGod's will.\"\n\nHe stopped, then continued,--\n\n\"I am a priest; I believe in God.\"\n\n\"God has grown antiquated,\" said Danton.\n\n\"I believe in God,\" repeated Cimourdain, unmoved.\n\nRobespierre gloomily nodded his approval, and Cimourdain continued,--\n\n\"To whom shall I be delegated?\"\n\nRobespierre replied,--\n\n\"To the commandant of the exploring division sent against Lantenac. But\nI give you warning that he is a nobleman.\"\n\n\"That is another thing that excites my contempt,\" cried Danton. \"A\nnobleman? Well, what of that? It is all the same whether a man be a\npriest or a nobleman; if he is a good man, he is excellent. Nobility\nis a prejudice; but we ought to deal impartially with it, granting\nboth its merits and its demerits. Is not Saint-Just a nobleman,\nRobespierre? Florelle de Saint-Just,--parbleu! Anacharsis Cloots is\na baron. Our friend Charles Hesse, who never misses a single session\nof the Cordeliers, is a prince, brother to the reigning Landgrave of\nHesse-Rothenbourg. Montaut, Marat's intimate friend, is Marquis de\nMontaut. In the revolutionary tribunal there is one juror Vilate,\nwho is a priest, and another Leroy, Marquis de Montflabert. Both are\ntrustworthy men.\"\n\n\"And you forget,\" added Robespierre, \"the foreman of the revolutionary\njury--\"\n\n\"Antonelle!\"\n\n\"Marquis Antonelle,\" corrected Robespierre.\n\n\"And that Dampierre, who was lately killed before Cond\u00c3\u00a9 by the\nRepublic,\" rejoined Danton, \"was a nobleman; and Beaurepaire too,\nwho blew his brains out rather than open the gates of Verdun to the\nPrussians.\"\n\n\"And in spite of all that,\" grumbled Marat, \"on the day when Condorcet\nexclaimed, 'The Gracchi were nobles!' Danton cried out, 'All nobles are\ntraitors,--beginning with Mirabeau, and ending with thee!'\"\n\nHere the serious voice of Cimourdain rose above the others:--\n\n\"Citizen Danton, citizen Robespierre, you may perhaps be justified in\nyour confidence; but the nation distrusts, and it has reason to do\nso. When a priest is charged with the surveillance of a nobleman, the\nresponsibility is a double one, and it is the duty of the priest to be\ninflexible.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Robespierre.\n\n\"And inexorable,\" added Cimourdain.\n\n\"Well said, citizen Cimourdain!\" rejoined Robespierre. \"It is a young\nman with whom you will have to deal, and you will have the advantage\nover him, from the fact that you are twice his age. He must be\nguided, but with the utmost discretion, that he may not suspect it.\nIt seems that he has military ability; all reports are unanimous on\nthat point. He forms part of a corps which has been detached from the\narmy of the Rhine and sent into the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e. He has lately returned\nfrom the frontier, where he distinguished himself by his bravery and\nintelligence, and is now in command of the exploring division, which he\nhandles like an expert. For fifteen days he has held the old Marquis\nde Lantenac in check. He restrains him, and at the same time compels\nhim to give way. He will end by forcing him to the sea and pitching\nhim into it. Lantenac has the cunning of an old general, while his\nopponent possesses the boldness of a young captain. This young man has\nalready won for himself enemies and detractors, who are envious of him.\nAdjutant-General L\u00c3\u00a9chelle is jealous of him.\"\n\n\"This L\u00c3\u00a9chelle wants to be commander-in-chief,\" interrupted Danton. \"He\nhas only a pun in his favor,--it needs a ladder to mount into a cart.\nMeanwhile, Charette defeats him.\"\n\n\"And he is not willing that any one else should defeat Lantenac,\" added\nRobespierre. \"The misfortune of the Vendean war is the existence of\nthese rivalries. Our soldiers are heroes led by inferior commanders.\nCh\u00c3\u00a9rin, a mere captain of hussars, enters Saumur with trumpets,\nplaying _\u00c3\u0087a ira_; he takes Saumur; he might go on and take Cholet,\nbut having received no orders, he pauses. Every position of command\nin the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e ought to be reconstructed; the garrisons are scattered,\nthe forces dispersed; an army that is scattered is paralyzed; it is\nlike a rock crumbling into dust. Nothing but tents are left at Camp\nde Param\u00c3\u00a9. Between Tr\u00c3\u00a9guier and Dinan there are a hundred useless\nlittle encampments out of which a division could be formed to cover\nthe entire coast. L\u00c3\u00a9chelle, supported by Parrein, robs the northern\ncoast under the pretext of protecting the southern, and thus exposes\nFrance to the English. Half a million of peasants in revolt, and a\ndescent of England upon France,--such is Lantenac's plan. The young\ncommander of the exploring column presses his resistless sword against\nLantenac's loins, until he forces him to yield, and this without\nasking leave of L\u00c3\u00a9chelle. Now, L\u00c3\u00a9chelle is his chief, therefore he\ndenounces him. Opinions are divided regarding this young man. L\u00c3\u00a9chelle\nwould like to have him shot, and Prieur de la Marne wishes to make him\nAdjutant-General.\"\n\n\"He seems to me to possess great qualities,\" observed Cimourdain.\n\n\"But he has one defect!\"\n\nThis interruption came from Marat.\n\n\"And what is that?\" asked Cimourdain.\n\n\"Clemency,\" replied Marat; and he went on: \"He is firm in the assault,\nbut after the victory he shows his weakness. He grants indulgences,\nhe is too merciful and forgiving, he protects _religieuses_ and nuns,\nhe saves the wives and daughters of the aristocrats, he releases\nprisoners, and lets the priests go free.\"\n\n\"A grave fault,\" murmured Cimourdain.\n\n\"A crime, you would do better to call it,\" said Marat.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Danton.\n\n\"Often,\" said Robespierre.\n\n\"Almost always,\" insisted. Marat.\n\n\"Yes, when one has to deal with the enemies of one's country it may\nalways be called a crime,\" said Cimourdain.\n\nMarat turned towards the latter.\n\n\"And what then would you do with a Republican chief who would set a\nRoyalist leader at liberty?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I should agree with L\u00c3\u00a9chelle; I would have him shot.\"\n\n\"Or guillotined,\" said Marat.\n\n\"He might take his choice,\" said Cimourdain. Danton began to laugh.\n\n\"The one seems to me as good as the other.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure to have one or the other,\" muttered Marat; and\naverting his eyes from Danton, he fixed them again on Cimourdain.\n\n\"So, citizen Cimourdain, if you caught a Republican chief stumbling,\nyou would have him beheaded?\"\n\n\"Within twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Marat, \"I agree with Robespierre; citizen Cimourdain\nmust be sent as a delegate from the Committee of Public Safety to the\ncommander of the exploring division of the coast army. What is this\ncommander's name, by the way?\"\n\nRobespierre, beginning to turn over his papers, replied,--\n\n\"He is a ci-devant nobleman.\"\n\n\"It is an excellent plan to set a priest to guard a nobleman,\" said\nDanton. \"Either one of them, singly and alone, I am inclined to\ndistrust; but when taken together, I have no fear of them: they keep a\nmutual watch over each other, and go on very well.\"\n\nThe expression of indignation peculiar to Cimourdain's face grew more\npronounced; but doubtless aware that the observation was based upon\ntruth, he did not turn towards Danton as he lifted his severe voice.\n\n\"If the Republican commander intrusted to my care makes a false step,\nhe will suffer the penalty of death.\"\n\nRobespierre, with his eyes still resting on his portfolio, said:--\n\n\"Here is the name; the commander in charge of whom you will be placed,\nto conduct yourself in his regard at your own discretion, is a former\nViscount called Gauvain.\"\n\nCimourdain turned pale.\n\n\"Gauvain!\" he exclaimed.\n\nMarat observed Cimourdain's pallor.\n\n\"The Viscount Gauvain!\" repeated Cimourdain.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Robespierre.\n\n\"Well?\" exclaimed Marat, gazing steadfastly at Cimourdain.\n\nThere was a brief silence, broken by Marat.\n\n\"Citizen Cimourdain, do you accept the appointment of commissioner\ndelegate to the commander Gauvain, with the condition which you\nyourself have laid down? Is it agreed?\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Cimourdain, with increasing pallor.\n\nRobespierre took the pen that lay beside him, and in his slow and\nregular handwriting traced four lines on the sheet of paper headed\n\"Committee of Public Safety.\" After signing it, he passed the pen and\npaper to Danton, who signed; and the signature of Marat, who had not\nonce removed his eyes from the pale face of Cimourdain, was added to\nthe others.\n\nRobespierre, taking back the sheet, dated it and gave it to Cimourdain,\nwho read on it the following:--\n\n      YEAR II. OF THE REPUBLIC.\n\n      Full powers are granted to citizen Cimourdain,\n      commissioner delegated from the Committee of Public Safety\n      to the citizen Gauvain, in command of the exploring\n      division of the army of the coast. ROBESPIERRE. DANTON.\n      MARAT.\n\nAnd below the signatures: \"June 29, 1793.\"\n\nThe revolutionary calendar, called the civil calendar, had no legal\nexistence at that time, and was only adopted by the Convention on the\n5th of October, 1793, in response to the proposition of Romme.\n\nWhile Cimourdain was reading, Marat continued to watch him. Then, in a\ntone half-inaudible, as though speaking to himself, he said,--\n\n\"All this must be confirmed by a decree from the Convention, or by a\nspecial resolution of the Committee of Public Safety. Something still\nremains to be done.\"\n\n\"Citizen Cimourdain, where do you live?\" asked Robespierre.\n\n\"Cour du Commerce.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Then you are a neighbor of mine. I live there also,\" said\nDanton.\n\nRobespierre continued:--\n\n\"There is not a moment to lose. To-morrow you will receive your formal\ncommission, signed by all the members of the Committee of Public\nSafety. This is a confirmation of the commission accrediting you\nspecially to the acting representatives Philippeaux, Prieur de la\nMarne, Lecointre, Alquier, and others. We know you; your powers are\nunlimited. It rests with you to make Gauvain a general or send him\nto the scaffold. You will receive your commission to-morrow at three\no'clock. When will you start?\"\n\n\"At four o'clock,\" said Cimourdain; and they separated.\n\nOn returning home, Marat informed Simonne \u00c3\u0089vrard that he should go to\nthe Convention to-morrow.\n\n\n[Illustration: The Convention. 052]\n\nBOOK III.\n\n\nTHE CONVENTION.\n\n\n[Illustration 053]\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nTHE CONVENTION.\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWe are approaching the summit.\n\nThe Convention is before our eyes, and in the presence of this lofty\neminence the gaze grows steady.\n\nNothing more towering ever rose above the human horizon. There is but\none Himalaya, but one Convention.\n\nThe Convention may perhaps be called the culminating point in history.\n\nDuring its lifetime--an assembly actually lives--one did not realize\nwhat it was. Its supreme grandeur was not appreciated by its\ncontemporaries, who were too much terrified to be dazzled. Mediocrities\nand moderate hills levy no severe tax on one's admiration; but the\nmajestic inspires a holy horror, whether it be the majesty of genius\nor of a mountain, an assembly or a masterpiece. Too close proximity\nexcites alarm; every peak seems exaggerated, the ascent is fatiguing,\nand one loses breath in climbing its sharp acclivities, misses his\nfooting on the slopes, and is wounded by the cragged surfaces, which\nin themselves are beauties; the foaming torrent indicates the presence\nof the chasm, the summit is veiled in clouds; whether ascending or\ndescending, it is equally frightful, hence one feels the influence of\nterror rather than of admiration,--a kind of aversion to grandeur,\nwhich is a strange enough sensation. While gazing on the abyss, one\ncannot always appreciate its sublimity; the monster is more evident\nthan the miracle. It was thus that men first judged the Convention.\nThe purblind undertook to fathom an abyss whose depths could only be\nsounded by the eagle.\n\nTo-day we behold it in the perspective outlining the granite profile\nof the French Revolution against the calm and tragic background of the\nfar-away heavens.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe 14th of July set the nation free.\n\nThe 10th of August hurled its thunderbolts.\n\nThe 21st of September founded a new era; for the 21st of September\nwas the equinox, the equilibrium, _Libra_,--the balance-scales of\nJustice. According to the remark of Romme, the Republic was proclaimed\nbeneath this sign of Equality and Justice,--heralded, so to speak, by a\nconstellation.\n\nThe Convention is the first avatar of the people. It was the\nConvention that turned the new and glorious page, introducing the\nfuture of to-day.\n\nEvery idea requires a visible embodiment; every principle needs a\nhabitation; a church means the four walls within which the Almighty\nhas his dwelling-place; every dogma must have its temple. When the\nConvention became a fact, the first problem was to locate it.\n\nAt first it was established in the Man\u00c3\u00a8ge, but afterwards at the\nTuileries. Here they raised a platform and arranged scenery, painted\nin gray, by David; also, rows of benches and a square tribune; there\nwere parallel pilasters, with massive plinths, and long rectangular\nstems, and square enclosures, into which the multitude crowded, and\nwhich were called public tribunes; a Roman velarium, and Grecian\ndraperies; and amid these right angles and straight lines the\nConvention was installed,--a tempest confined within geometrical\nlimits. On the tribune the red cap was painted in gray. At first the\nRoyalists ridiculed this gray _bonnet-rouge_, this artificial hall,\nthis pasteboard monument, this sanctuary of papier-m\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9, this pantheon\nof mud and spittle. How quickly it was destined to vanish! The pillars\nwere made of barrel-staves, the arches of thin deal boards, the\nbas-reliefs were mastic, the entablature was of pine, the statues were\nof plaster, the marble was painted, the walls were of canvas; and in\nthis provisional shelter France has recorded deeds that can never be\nforgotten.\n\nDuring the early sessions of the Convention the walls of the Hall\nof the Man\u00c3\u00a8ge were covered with the advertisements with which Paris\nswarmed at the time of the return from Varennes. On one might be read:\n\"The King returns. Whoever applauds him will be chastised; whoever\ninsults him will be hung.\" On another: \"Peace. Keep your hats on your\nheads. He is about to pass before his judges.\" On another: \"The King\ntook aim at the nation, but his weapon hung fire. Now the nation has\nits turn.\" On another: \"The law! the law!\" It was within these walls\nthat the Convention sat in judgment on Louis XVI.\n\nAt the Tuileries, now called the Palais National, where the Convention\nhad held its sessions from the 10th of May, 1793, the Assembly\nHall occupied the space between the Pavillon de l'Horloge, called\nPavillon Unit\u00c3\u00a9, and the Pavillon Marsan, called Pavillon Libert\u00c3\u00a9. The\nPavillon de Flore was now called Pavillon-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9. The Assembly Hall\nwas accessible by the grand staircase of Jean Bullant. The entire\nground-floor of the palace below the first story, occupied by the\nAssembly, was a kind of long guardroom, littered with the luggage and\ncamp-beds of the various troops mounting guard over the Convention. The\nAssembly had a special guard of honor, called \"the Grenadiers of the\nConvention.\"\n\nA tricolored ribbon divided the palace occupied by the Assembly from\nthe garden where the people passed in and out.\n\n\nIII.\n\nLet us finish our description of the Assembly Hall. Everything\nconcerning this terrible place is of interest. The first object to\nattract one's attention on entering was a tall statue of Liberty,\nplaced between two large windows. This hall, which was formerly\nthe king's theatre, had now become the stage of Revolution. It was\nforty-two metres long, ten metres in width, and eleven in height. This\nelegant and superb hall built by Vigarani for the use of the courtiers\nwas hidden beneath the rude timber-work which served to support the\nweight of the people in '93. The only point of support upon which\nthis timber-work of the public tribunes rested, was a single post,\nwhich well deserves honorable mention. This post consisted of one\nsolid piece, ten metres in circumference, and few caryatides have done\nan equal amount of work; for years it bore the severe pressure of\nrevolution. It has supported applause, enthusiasm, insult, clamors and\ntumults, the tremendous chaos of wrath, the fury of insurrection, and\nnever given way beneath its burden. After the Convention it witnessed\nthe council of the Ancients. On the 18th Brumaire it was relieved. At\nthat time Percier replaced this wooden pillar by columns of marble that\ndid not last so long.\n\nAn architect's ideal is sometimes peculiar; that of the architect\nof the Rue de Rivoli was the curved path of a cannon-ball in its\nflight; the architect of Carlsruhe conceived the ideal of a fan;\nand the conception of the architect who built the hall where\nthe Convention established itself on the 10th of May, 1793, was\napparently a huge bureau drawer, for it was long as well as high and\nflat. A great semicircle had been added to one of the long sides\nof the parallelogram; this was the amphitheatre with seats for\nthe representatives, but neither tables nor desks; Garan-Coulon,\nwho wrote a great deal, used to write, resting his paper on his\nknee; facing the benches was the tribune,--before it the bust of\nLepelletier-Saint-Fargeau, and behind it the president's arm-chair.\nThe head of the bust projected slightly above the edge of the tribune,\nwhich afterwards was the cause of its removal.\n\nThe amphitheatre consisted of nineteen semicircular benches, rising one\nabove the other, some of which had been lengthened in order to fit into\nthe corners, by means of other benches cut off for the purpose.\n\nIn the semicircle beneath, at the foot of the tribunal, were the places\nof the ushers, and on the other side of the tribune hung a placard\nnine feet high, set in a black wooden frame, and bearing on its two\npages, separated by a kind of sceptre, the Declaration of the rights\nof man. On the other side was an empty space which was afterwards\noccupied by a similar frame, containing the Constitution of the year\nII., with the two pages separated by a sword. Above the tribune, over\nthe head of the orator, from a deep loge divided into two compartments\nand filled with People, floated three immense tricolored banners,\narranged in a horizontal position, resting on an altar upon which\ncould be read the following words: \"The Law.\" Behind this altar rose,\nlike the sentinel of freedom of speech, an enormous Roman fasces as\ntall as a column. Two colossal statues, placed erect against the wall,\nfaced the representatives,--Lycurgus on the president's right hand,\nSolon on his left, with Plato towering above the Mountain. The statues\nstood on simple wooden blocks, resting on a long projecting cornice\nthat encircled the hall, separating the people from the Assembly. The\nspectators leaned their elbows on this cornice.\n\nThe black wooden frame enclosing the proclamation of the Rights of\nMan reached to the cornice, interfering with the symmetry of the\nentablature,--an infraction of the straight line that made Chabot\ngrowl. \"It is ugly,\" he said to Vadier.\n\nThe heads of the statues were decorated with wreaths of oak and laurel.\n\nGreen curtains, on which similar wreaths were painted in a deeper shade\nof the same color, fell in heavy folds from the surrounding cornice,\ndraping the entire lower floor of the hall occupied by the Assembly.\nAbove this drapery the wall was white and bare. In this wall, as if\ncarved by a chisel, without moulding or ornament, were two stories of\npublic tribunes, the square ones below, the round ones above; according\nto the rule-for the influence of Vitruvius was still acknowledge--the\narchivolts were superimposed upon the architraves. There were ten\ntribunes on each of the long sides of the hall, and two huge boxes at\nboth ends; twenty-four in all. There sat the assembled crowd.\n\nThe spectators in the lower tribunes overflowed their bounds, grouping\nthemselves on every projection along the cornice. A long iron bar,\nfirmly fastened at the point of support, served as a rail to the upper\ntribunes, and protected the spectators from the pressure of the crowds\nthat ascended the stairs. Once, however, a man who was pitched suddenly\ninto the Assembly below escaped death by falling partly upon Massieu,\nBishop of Beauvais; whereupon he exclaimed, \"Really, a bishop has his\nuse, then, after all!\"\n\nThe hall of the Convention was large enough to contain two thousand\npersons, and on the days of insurrections even three thousand.\n\nThe Convention held two sessions,--one during the day and one in the\nevening.\n\nThe back of the president's chair was round, studded with gilt nails.\nHis table was supported by four winged monsters with a single foot,\nwho might have been supposed to have come forth from the Apocalypse\nto witness the Revolution. They seemed to have been unharnessed from\nEzekiel's chariot to drag the tumbril of Samson.\n\nOn the president's table stood a huge bell, almost as large as a\nchurch-bell, a big copper inkstand, and a parchment portfolio, which\ncontained the record of proceedings. The blood from many a severed\nhead, borne aloft on the end of a pike, has dripped upon this table.\n\nNine steps led to the tribune. These steps were high, steep, and\ndifficult of ascent; Gensonn\u00c3\u00a9 once tripped in the act of mounting them.\n\"It is like the staircase of a scaffold!\" he said. \"It is well to serve\nyour apprenticeship!\" cried Carrier.\n\nIn the corners of the hall, where the walls seemed rather bare, the\narchitect had placed Roman fasces as ornaments, with the axe bound on\nthe outside.\n\nOn the right and left of the tribune pedestals supported two candelabra\ntwelve feet high, each bearing four pairs of Argand lamps. For each\npublic box there was a similar candelabra; and on the pedestals\nof these candelabra circles were carved, which the people called\n\"guillotine collars.\"\n\nThe seats of the Assembly, rising almost to the cornice of the\ntribunes, gave the representatives and the people an opportunity to\nchat with one another.\n\nThe exits of the tribunes opened into a labyrinth of corridors, often\nechoing with wild and tumultuous sounds.\n\nThe Convention, outgrowing the limits of the palace, ace, overflowed\ninto the neighboring hotels of Longueville and Coigny. If we may credit\nLord Bradford's letter, it was to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Coigny that the royal\nfurniture was removed after the 10th of August. It took two entire\nmonths to empty the Tuileries.\n\nThe committees were lodged in the vicinity of the hall: those of\nlegislation, agriculture, and commerce at the Pavillon-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9; those\nof the navy, the colonies, finance, assignats, and public safety, at\nthe Pavillon Libert\u00c3\u00a9; the Committee of War was at the Pavillon-Unit\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe lodgings of the Committee of General Safety were accessible to\nthose of the Public Safety through a dark corridor, lighted night and\nday by a lantern,--a passage-way for the spies of all parties, who came\nand went, talking in whispers.\n\nThe bar of the Convention had been changed several times. Usually it\nwas at the right hand of the president.\n\nAt both ends of the hall the two vertical partitions that shut off the\nconcentric semicircles of the amphitheatre on the right hand and on the\nleft, allowed space enough between partition and wall for two long and\nnarrow passages closed at either end by square doors, which afforded\nentrance and exit.\n\nA door opening upon the Terrasse des Feuillants, and leading directly\ninto the hall, served for the admittance of the representatives.\n\nThis hall, ineffectually lighted during the day by windows, whose\ninsufficient glimmer was replaced by livid torches when twilight fell,\nseemed ever shrouded in night. The lamplight sessions were lugubrious,\nthe artificial light seeming really to increase rather than diminish\nthe darkness. No man could see his neighbor; from all parts of the hall\nindistinct groups of faces seemed to be mocking each other. People\npassed one another without recognition. One day Laignelot, hastening to\nthe tribune, jostled some one in the descending passage. \"I beg pardon,\nRobespierre,\" he said. \"For whom do you take me?\" replied a hoarse\nvoice. \"Excuse me, Marat,\" said Laignelot.\n\nBelow, one tribune on either Bide of the president was reserved; for,\nstrange to say, privileged spectators were admitted to the Convention.\nThe draperies of these tribunes--the only ones thus adorned--were\ncaught back to the middle of the architrave by golden cords and\ntassels. The tribunes of the people were bare. The general effect\nwas stern, unconventional, and yet correct. The union of propriety\nand fierceness is the essence of a revolutionary life. The Hall of\nthe Convention presented a perfect example of what artists have\nsince called the \"messidor architecture.\" It was at once massive and\nfrail. The builders of that period mistook symmetry for beauty. The\nRenaissance had said its last word under Louis XV., and a reaction had\nset in. The standards of nobility and purity had been so exaggerated\nthat that which was really noble had degenerated into insipidity, and\npurity itself had become inexpressibly wearisome. Prudery may exist\nin architecture. After the dazzling orgies of form and color of the\neighteenth century, art had begun a system of diet, and allowed itself\nonly a straight line. This style of improvement resulted in ugliness,\nand art was thereby reduced to a skeleton,--a phenomenal condition\nwhich is the drawback to this kind of wisdom and abstinence; the style\nis so strict that it becomes meagre. Apart from all political emotion,\nthe mere sight of this architecture made one shiver. Dimly recalling\nthe old theatre, with its garlanded boxes, its ceiling of azure and\ncrimson, its chandelier and girandoles with their prismatic reflections\nglittering like diamonds, its dove-colored upholstery, the profusion\nof cupids and nymphs on its curtain and draperies,--all that royal and\namorous idyl, painted, sculptured, and gilded, which once irradiated\nthis gloomy place with its smile,--and then casting one's eyes upon\nthese severe rectangular lines, cold and sharp as steel, made one think\nof Boucher guillotined by David.\n\n\nIV.\n\nHe who looked upon the Assembly utterly forgot the hall. He who\nwitnessed the drama was oblivious to the theatre. Nothing more\nmisshapen and at the same time sublime. A crowd of heroes, a herd of\ncowards; wild beasts on the mountain, reptiles in the swamp. There all\nthose combatants, the ghosts of to-day, swarmed, elbowed each other,\nquarrelling, threatening, fighting, and living out their lives.\n\nA convocation of Titans!\n\n[Illustration 054]\n\nOn the right the Gironde,--a legion of thinkers; on the left the\nMountain,--a group of athletes.

Beneath all these passions, this heroism\nand devotion, this rage, might be seen the gloomy multitude of the\nanonymous. The shoals of the Assembly were called the Plain, comprising\nthe entire floating element,--men who are in doubt, who hesitate,\nretreat, temporize, mistrustfully watching one another. The Mountain\nand the Gironde were the chosen few, the Plain was the crowd. The Plain\nwas summed up and expressed in Siey\u00c3\u00a8s.\n\nSiey\u00c3\u00a8s was a man of a naturally profound mind, full of chimerical\nprojects. He had paused at the Third Estate, and had never been able\nto rise as high as the people. Certain minds are constituted to rest\nmidway. Siey\u00c3\u00a8s called Robespierre a tiger, who returned the compliment\nby calling him a mole. He was a philosopher who had attained prudence\nif not wisdom. He was a courtier, rather than the servant of the\nRevolution. He took a spade and went to work with the people in the\nChamps de Mars, hauling the same cart with Alexander de Beauharnais. He\nurged others to energetic labors which he never performed himself. He\nsaid to the Girondists: \"Put the cannon on your own side.\" There are\nphilosophers who are natural wrestlers, and they like Condorcet joined\nthe party of Vergniaud, or like Camille Desmoulins that of Danton.\nThere are philosophers who value their lives, and those who belonged to\nthis class followed Siey\u00c3\u00a8s.\n\nThe best vats have their dregs. Still lower even than the Plain was\nthe Marsh, whose stagnation was hideous to look upon, revealing\nas it did transparent egotism. There shivered the timid in silent\nexpectation. Nothing could be more wretched. Ignominious to the last\ndegree, and yet feeling no shame, hiding their indignation, living in\nservitude, cherishing covert rebellion, possessed by a certain cynical\nterror, they had all the desperation peculiar to cowardice; they\nreally preferred the Gironde, and yet they chose the Mountain; when\nthe final result depended on them, they went over to the successful\nside; they surrendered Louis XVI. to Vergniaud, Danton to Robespierre,\nand Robespierre to Tallien. They put Marat in the pillory during his\nlifetime, and deified him after his death. They showed themselves the\npartisans of the very cause which they suddenly turned against. They\nseemed to possess an instinct for jostling the infirm. Since they had\njoined the cause with the understanding that it was a strong one, any\nsign of wavering seemed to them equivalent to treason. They were the\nmajority, the power, and the fear. Hence springs the audacity of the\nbase.\n\nHence the 31st of May, the 11th Germinal, the 9th Thermidor,--tragedies\nwhere dwarfs untied the knots of giants.\n\n\nVI.\n\nAnd among these passionate men were to be found others, fanciful\ndreamers. Utopia was there in all its varied forms,--from the warlike,\nwhich admitted the scaffold, to the mild, which would fain abolish\nthe penalty of death; a spectre or an angel, according as one viewed\nit from the throne or from the side of the common people. Men eager\nfor the fray stood face to face with others who were contented\nto brood over their dreams of peace. The brain of Carnot created\nfourteen armies while Jean Debry was revolving in his head a scheme\nof universal democratic federation. Amid this furious eloquence, amid\nthese howling and thundering voices, some men there were who preserved\na fruitful silence. Lakanal was silent, preoccupied with his system\nfor national public education; Lanthenas held his peace, absorbed in\nhis plans for primary schools; Revelli\u00c3\u00a8re-Lepaux was silent, dreaming\nof philosophy when it should attain the dignity of religion. Others\nbusied themselves with matters of minor importance and the details\nof every-day life. Guyton-Morveaux was interested in the improvement\nof the sanitary condition of hospitals; Maire in the abolishment of\nexisting servitudes; Jean-Bon-Saint-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 in the suppression of arrest\nand imprisonment for debt; Romme in Chappe's proposition; Dub\u00c3\u00b6e in\nthe filing of the archives; Coren-Fustier in the foundation of the\nCabinet of Anatomy and the Museum of Natural History; Guyomard in\nthe navigation of rivers and the damming of the Scheldt. Men were\nfanatical about art, even monomaniacs on the subject; on the 21st of\nJanuary, at the very time when the head of monarchy was falling on the\nPlace de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution, B\u00c3\u00a9zard, the representative of the Oise, went\nto see a picture of Rubens which had been found in a garret in the\nRue Saint-Lazare. Artists, orators, and prophets, giants like Danton,\nand men as childlike as Cloots, gladiators and philosophers, were all\nstraining for the same goal,--progress. Nothing disconcerted them. The\ngreatness of the Convention consisted in its efforts to discover what\ndegree of reality there might be in that which men call the impossible.\nAt one end stood Robespierre with his eyes fixed upon the Law, and at\nthe other Condorcet gazing with equal steadiness on Duty.\n\n[Illustration 058]\n\nCondorcet was a man enlightened, but given to dreaming. Robespierre\npossessed executive ability; and sometimes, in the final crises of\nworn-out conditions, execution signifies extermination. Revolutions\nhave two slopes,--the one ascending, the other descending,--whereon we\nmeet at different stages each season in its turn, from the freezing to\nthe flowery; and each zone produces men suited to the climate, from\nthose who live under the hot rays of the sun, to those who dwell with\nthe thunderbolt.\n\n\n[Illustration 059]\n\n\nVII.\n\nPeople pointed out to each other the bend in the left-hand passage,\nwhere Robespierre whispered to Clavi\u00c3\u00a8re's friend Garat that terrible\nepigram, \"Clavi\u00c3\u00a8re a conspir\u00c3\u00a9 partout o\u00c3\u00b9 il a respir\u00c3\u00a9.\" In this\nsame bend, well adapted for privacy and suppressed indignation,\nFabre d'\u00c3\u0089glantine quarrelled with Romme, reproaching him for having\ndisfigured his calendar by changing Fervidor into Thermidor.\nPeople pointed out the corner where, elbow to elbow, sat the seven\nrepresentatives of Haute-Garonne, who, being the first called upon to\npronounce their verdict upon Louis XVI., had thus answered, one after\nthe other: Mailhe, \"death;\" Delmas, \"death;\" Projean, \"death;\" Cal\u00c3\u00a8s,\n\"death;\" Ayral, \"death;\" Julien, \"death;\" Desaby, \"death,\"--eternal\nreverberation that fills all history, and since the birth of human\njustice has continued to send forth a funereal echo from the walls of\nthe tribunal. Amid this stormy sea of faces one man would point out\nto another the individuals whose tragic votes had caused that fearful\ndin: Paganel, who cried, \"Death. A king serves no purpose save by his\ndeath.\" Millaud, who said, \"If death had never been known, we must\nto-day have invented it.\" Old Raffron du Trouillet, who exclaimed,\n\"A speedy death!\" Goupilleau, who cried, \"The scaffold, at once.\nDelay but aggravates the pain of death.\" Siey\u00c3\u00a8s, who with solemn\nbrevity uttered the single word, \"Death.\" Thuriot, who, rejecting\nthe appeal to the people proposed by Buzot, said, \"What! The primary\nassemblies! forty-four thousand tribunals! an endless trial! The\nhead of Louis XVI. would have time to grow gray before it fell.\"\nAugustin-Bon-Robespierre, who exclaimed, after his brother, \"I ignore\nthat humanity which massacres the people and pardons despots! Death!\nThe demand for a reprieval means a substitution of the appeal to\ntyrants for the appeal to the people.\" Foussedoire, who took the place\nof Bernardin-de-Saint-Pierre, saying, \"The shedding of human blood is\nabhorrent to me; but the blood of a king is not human blood. Death!\"\nJean-Bon-Saint-Andr\u00c3\u00a9, who said, \"No nation can be free until the tyrant\ndies.\" Lavicomterie, who expressed himself in this formula: \"So long as\nthe tyrant breathes, liberty is strangled. Death!\" Ch\u00c3\u00a2teauneuf-Randon,\nwho cried, \"The death of Louis the Last!\" Guyardin, who suggested, \"Let\nhim be executed at the Barri\u00c3\u00a8re-Renvers\u00c3\u00a9e.\" The Barri\u00c3\u00a8re-Renvers\u00c3\u00a9e was\nthe Barri\u00c3\u00a8re du Tr\u00c3\u00b4ne. Tellier, who said, \"Let us forge a cannon of the\ncalibre of Louis XVI.'s head, to fire upon the enemy.\" And among those\ninclined to mercy, Gentil was one, who said, \"I vote for imprisonment.\nHe who makes a Charles I. makes a Cromwell likewise.\" Bancal, who said,\n\"Exile. I should like to see the first king of the earth sentenced to\nearn his living at a trade.\" Albouys, who said, \"Exile. Let this living\nspectre wander round among the thrones.\" Zangiacomi, who said, \"I vote\nfor imprisonment; let us keep Capet alive for a scarecrow.\" Chaillon,\nwho said, \"Let him live! I do not approve of killing a man for Rome to\ncanonize.\" While sentences like these fell one after the other from\nthese severe lips, making their way into history, bedizened women in\nlow-necked dresses sat in the boxes, and with list in hand counted the\nvotes as they were given, pricking each name with a pin.\n\n[Illustration 060]\n\nWhere tragedy has entered in, horror and pity remain. To see the\nConvention, at whatsoever epoch of its reign, was to witness anew the\njudgment of the last of the Capets; the legend of the 21st of January\nseemed to be interwoven with all its acts; the formidable Assembly was\ncomposed of those men whose fatal breath put out the ancient torch of\nmonarchy, which had burned for eighteen centuries; the decisive trial\nof all kings in the person of one seemed to be the starting-point of\nthe great war which it waged against the past. At whatsoever session of\nthe Convention one might be present, the shadow cast by the scaffold\nof Louis XVI. never failed to make itself evident. The spectators\ntold each other about the resignations of Kersaint and Roland, and\nalso about Duch\u00c3\u00a2tel the deputy of the Deux-S\u00c3\u00a8vres, who, being ill,\ncaused himself to be carried to the Assembly, and on his death-bed\nvoted against the execution of the king,--an act which excited Marat\nto laughter. People looked for the representative forgotten to-day,\nwho, after a session that had lasted thirty-seven hours, overcome by\nfatigue, fell asleep on his bench, and being roused by the usher when\nhis turn came to vote, half-opened his eyes, murmured, \"Death,\" and\nfell asleep again.\n\nAt the time when the death-sentence of Louis XVI. was passed,\nRobespierre had eighteen months to live, Danton fifteen, Vergniaud\nnine, Marat five months and three weeks, and Lepelletier-Saint-Fargeau\none day! Brief and terrible was the breath of life in those days.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThe people had a window, opening on the Convention in the shape of the\npublic tribunes, and when this window proved inadequate, they opened\nthe door, and the street-population poured in upon the Assembly. The\ninvasions of the crowd into this senate presented one of the most\nstriking spectacles known to history. Generally these irruptions\nwere amicable. The street fraternized with the curule chair. But\nfriendship with a people who had once, in the course of three hours,\ntaken the cannon of the Invalides and forty thousand muskets besides,\nwas a somewhat formidable relationship. At every moment a procession\ninterrupted the session. There were deputations admitted to the bar,\npetitions, expressions of respect, offerings. The pike of honor of the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine was brought in, borne by women. The English\noffered twenty thousand pairs of shoes for our barefooted soldiers.\n\"Citizen Arnoux,\" said the \"Moniteur,\" \"the cur\u00c3\u00a9 of Aubignan, in\ncommand of the battalion of the Dr\u00c3\u00b4me, requests permission to march\nto the frontier, and begs that his parish may be kept for him.\" The\ndelegates from the Sections came, bringing in wheelbarrows, dishes,\npatens, chalices, monstrances, heaps of gold, silver, and gilt,\nofferings to the country from this ragged crowd, who asked, as a\nreward, permission to dance the Carmagnole before the Convention.\n\n[Illustration 061]\n\nChenard, Narbonne, and Valli\u00c3\u00a8re came to sing stanzas in honor of the\nMountain. The section of Mont-Blanc brought the bust of Lepelletier,\nand a woman placed a red cap on the head of the president, who embraced\nher; \"the citoyennes of the section du Mail\" strewed flowers \"before\nthe legislators;\" the \"pupils of the country,\" escorted by music, came\nto thank the Convention for having \"paved the way for the prosperity\nof the century;\" the women of the section of the Gardes-Fran\u00c3\u00a7aises\nbrought roses; the women of the section of the Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es presented\na crown of oak-leaves; the women of the section of the Temple came to\nthe bar and took an oath \"to wed only true Republicans;\" the section of\nMoli\u00c3\u00a8re presented a medal of Franklin which, by a formal decree, was\nsuspended from the wreath of the statue of Liberty; the Foundlings,\nwho had been declared the Children of the Republic, filed by, dressed\nin the national uniform; young girls of the ninety-third section came\narrayed in long white gowns, and the next day the \"Moniteur\" contained\nthis line: \"The president receives a bouquet from the innocent hands\nof a fair young girl.\" The orators saluted the crowds and sometimes\nflattered them, saying to the multitude; \"Thou art infallible; thou\nart irreproachable; thou art sublime.\" The lower classes are childlike;\nthey are fond of sugar-plums. Sometimes a riot would invade the\nAssembly, entering in a fury and departing pacified, like the Rhone\nflowing through Lake Leman, which is muddy enough on its entrance, but\nflows out as blue as the sky.\n\n[Illustration 062]\n\nIf it continued turbulent, Henriot would now and then order his\nfurnaces for heating the bullets to be brought up to the entrance of\nthe Tuileries.\n\n\nIX.\n\nWhile this assembly was throwing off the shackles of revolution, it was\nalso promoting civilization. It was a furnace, to be sure, but it was\nlikewise a forge. In this caldron where terror was bubbling, progress\nalso fermented. From that chaos of shadows and tempestuous whirlwind\nof clouds spread immense rays of light parallel with the eternal\nlaws,--rays that have since rested on the horizon, forever visible\nin the sky of the nations, and which are called justice, tolerance,\ngoodness, reason, truth, and love. The Convention proclaimed this\ngrand axiom: \"The liberty of one citizen ends where that of another\nbegins;\" thus summing up in two lines the essence of social science.\nIt proclaimed the sanctity of the poor, as well as of the infirm in\nthe persons of the blind, and of the mutes, whose guardianship had\nbeen assumed by the State; it honored maternity in the person of the\ngirl-mother, whom it comforted and lifted up, childhood in the orphans\nadopted by the State, and innocence in the accused, who was indemnified\nby the government after his acquittal. It branded the traffic in\nblacks and abolished slavery. It proclaimed civil consolidation. It\ndecreed gratuitous instruction. It organized national education by\nthe establishment of the normal school in Paris, the central school\nin the cities, and the primary school in the communes. It founded\nconservatories and museums. It systematized the Code as well as the\nweights and measures, and the method of calculation by decimals. It\nestablished the finances of France upon a firm basis, and brought about\nan era of public credit after the long monarchical bankruptcy. It\nestablished communication by telegraph, it provided almshouses for old\nage and the improved hospitals for sickness; it gave the Polytechnic\nSchool to the cause of education, the Bureau of Longitude to science,\nand the Institute to the domain of human intellect. It was at once\ncosmopolitan and national. Of the eleven thousand two hundred and ten\ndecrees issued by the Convention, the proportion of philanthropic as\ncompared with the political was as two to one. It proclaimed universal\nmorality to be the basis of society, and universal conscience the basis\nof the law. And it must be remembered that all these reforms--the\nabolition of slavery, the proclamation of universal brotherhood, the\nprotection of humanity, the elevation of the human conscience, the law\nof labor changed into a privilege, thus transforming the burden into a\ncomfort, the consolidation of the national wealth, the enlightenment\nand protection of children, the dissemination of knowledge and\nscience, a light set upon all the mountain-tops, help proffered to the\nsuffering, and the promulgation of all principle--were accomplished by\nthe Convention, with the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e gnawing like hydra at its entrails, and\nthe kings of the world leaping like tigers upon its shoulders.\n\n[Illustration 063]\n\n\nX.\n\nAstonishing assembly! The human, the inhuman, and the\nsuperhuman,--every type in short might be found there. An epic\naccumulation of antagonisms,--Guillotin avoiding David, Bazire\ninsulting Chabot, Gaudet mocking Saint-Just, Vergniaud despising\nDanton, Louvet attacking Robespierre, Buzot denouncing \u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9, Chambon\nbranding Pache: all hating Marat. And how many more names might yet be\nregistered! Armonville,--called Bonnet-Rouge, because at the sessions\nhe invariably wore a Phrygian cap,--a friend of Robespierre, who\ndemanded that the latter should be \"guillotined after Louis XVI.\" to\nrestore the equilibrium; Massieu, a colleague and counterpart of the\nkindly Lamourette, the bishop, destined to leave his name to a kiss;\nLehardy du Morbihan, stigmatizing the priests of Brittany; Bar\u00c3\u00a8re,\nthe man of majorities, who presided when Louis XVI. appeared at the\nbar, and who bore the same relation to Pam\u00c3\u00a9la as Louvet to Lodo\u00c3\u00afska;\nthe orator Daunou, who said, \"Let us gain time;\" Dubois-Cranc\u00c3\u00a9, who\nlistened to Marat's whispered confidences; the Marquis de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teauneuf;\nLaclos; Herault de S\u00c3\u00a9chelle, who fell back before Henriot, crying,\n\"Gunners, to your pieces!\" Julien, who compared the Mountain to\nThermopyl\u00c3\u00a6; Gamon, who demanded that a public tribune should be\nreserved exclusively for women; Laloy, who awarded the honors of\nthe session to Bishop Gobel, who came to the Convention to exchange\nhis mitre for the red cap; Lecomte, who cried, \"So we pay homage to\nthe priest who unfrocks himself;\" F\u00c3\u00a9raud, whose head was saluted by\nBoissy-d'Anglas, leaving to history the solution of the query, \"Did\nBoissy-d'Anglas salute the victim in the person of the head, or the\nassassins in the form of the pike?\" the two brothers Duprat, one a\nmember of the Mountain, the other a Girondist, who hated each other, as\ndid the two brothers Ch\u00c3\u00a9nier.\n\n[Illustration 064]\n\nMany a word has been uttered in this tribune in moments of excitement\nwhich has sometimes unconsciously to the speaker aroused the fatal\nspirit of revolution, and so influenced the existing circumstances\nthat a sense of discontent and passion suddenly sprang to life. As if\ndispleased with what they heard, events seemed to take offence at the\nwords of men, and catastrophes were precipitated by human speech. The\nreverberation of a voice in the mountain is sufficient to start an\navalanche. The utterance of one superfluous word may be followed by a\nlandslide, which might not have happened had no word been spoken. One\nmight almost fancy that events develop a certain irascibility.\n\nThus a mistaken word falling by chance from the lips of an orator cost\nMme. \u00c3\u0089lisabeth her head.\n\nIntemperance of language was the rule at the Convention. In the\ndiscussions threats flew back and forth, crossing one another, like\nsparks from a conflagration.\n\n_P\u00c3\u00a9tion._ \"Come to the point, Robespierre.\"\n\n_Robespierre._ \"You are the point, P\u00c3\u00a9tion. I shall come; you need have\nno fear.\"\n\n_A Voice._ \"Death to Marat!\"\n\n_Marat._ \"When Marat dies, the city of Paris will be no more; and when\nParis is gone, there is an end to the Republic.\"\n\nBillaud-Varennes rose to say, \"We wish to--\"\n\nBar\u00c3\u00a8re interrupted him: \"You speak in the plural, like a king.\"\n\nAnd another day:--\n\n_Philippeaux._ \"One of the members drew his sword upon me.\"\n\n_Audouin._ \"President, call the assassin to order.\"\n\n_The President._ \"Wait.\"\n\n_Panis._ \"President, I call you to order,\"--a sally followed by an\noutburst of rude laughter.\n\n_Lecointre._ \"The Cur\u00c3\u00a9 of Chant-de-Bout complains that his Bishop\nFauchet forbids him to marry.\"\n\n_A Voice._ \"I see no reason why Fauchet, who has mistresses, should try\nto prevent other men from having wives.\"\n\n_Another Voice._ \"Priest, take to thyself a wife.\"\n\nThe tribunes mingled in the conversation, and said \"Thou\" to the\nmembers.\n\nOne day the representative Ruamps mounted to the tribune, and, one\nof his hips being much larger than the other, a spectator called out\nto him: \"Turn that one towards the Right, since you have a cheek _\u00c3\u00a0\nla David!_\" Such were the liberties that the people took with the\nConvention. Once, however, during the uproar of the 11th of April,\n1793, the president caused a disorderly person in the tribunes to be\narrested.\n\nOne day, during a session at which the venerable Buonarotti was\npresent, Robespierre had the floor, and spoke for two hours, never\nremoving his eyes from Danton,--sometimes looking straight at him,\nwhich was unpleasant enough, but when he looked at him sideways, it\nwas even more disagreeable. His thunders of eloquence were not without\neffect, ending by an indignant outburst full of ominous words: \"We\nknow the intriguers, and those who strive to corrupt, as well as\nthose who are corrupted; we know the traitors also. They are present\nin this Assembly. They hear our voice, our eyes are upon them, and\nour gaze pursues them. Let them look above their heads, and they will\ndiscover the sword of the law; let them look into their conscience, and\nthere behold their own infamy. Let them beware!\" When Robespierre had\nfinished, Danton, with his half-closed eyes turned upwards and one arm\nhanging over the back of his chair, threw himself back and began to\nhum,--\n\n      \"Cadet Roussel fait des discours\n       Qui ne sont pas longs quand ils sont courts.\"\n\nImprecations fell thick on every side,--\"Conspirator!\" \"Assassin!\"\n\"Scoundrel!\" \"Seditious!\"\n\n\"Moderate!\" They denounced one another in the presence of the bust of\nBrutus standing there. Exclamations, insults, challenges! Angry glances\ninterchanged, much shaking of fists, flashing of pistols and half-drawn\ndaggers. An awful outblazing from the tribune. Some talked as if\nthey were pushed up against the guillotine. Heads waved to and fro,\nfrightened yet terrible. The multitude was like a volume of smoke blown\nall ways at once,--men of the Mountain, Girondists, Feuillantists,\nModerates, Terrorists, Jacobins, Cordeliers, and the eighteen regicide\npriests.\n\nAll these men!--a mass of smoke driven about in every direction.\n\n\nXI.\n\nSpirits at the mercy of the wind,--but a wind of preternatural power!\n\nIt might be truthfully said, even of the chief among them, that to be\na member of the Convention was like being a wave of the ocean. The\nimpetus came from above. There was an inherent force in the Convention,\nwhich might be called a will,--not in the sense of an individual\nquality, but belonging to the Assembly as a body; and this will was an\nidea, indomitable and boundless, which from the heavens above descended\ninto the darkness below. Men called it Revolution, and wherever it\npassed, some men were overthrown and others exalted; one would be\nscattered like foam, while another was dashed to pieces against the\nrocks. It kept its goal well in mind as it drove the maelstrom before\nit. To impute revolution to men is like attributing the tides to the\nwaves.\n\nRevolution is a manifestation of the unknown. You may call it good\nor evil, according as you aspire to the future or cling to the past;\nbut leave it to its authors. It would seem to be the joint product\nof great events and great individualities, but is in reality the\nresult of events alone. Events plan the expenditures for which men pay\nthe bills. Events dictate, men sign. The 14th of July was signed by\nCamille Desmoulins, the 10th of August by Danton, the 2d September by\nMarat, the 21st of September by Gr\u00c3\u00a9goire, and the 21st of January by\nRobespierre; but Desmoulins, Danton, Marat, Gr\u00c3\u00a9goire, and Robespierre\nare merely clerks. The majestic and mysterious compiler of those grand\npages was Almighty God, wearing the mask of destiny. Robespierre\nbelieved in God,--he did indeed.\n\nRevolution is one form of the eternal phenomenon that circumscribes us\non all sides, and which we call Necessity.\n\nIn the presence of this mysterious complication of benefits and\nwretchedness rises the wherefore of history.\n\n_Because._ This answer may be the reply of one who knows nothing, as\nwell as that of one who knows all.\n\nIn the presence of these monstrous catastrophes which both devastate\nand revivify civilization, one hesitates to sit in judgment on the\ndetails. To blame or to praise men on account of the result is very\nmuch like praising or criticising the ciphers on account of the sum\ntotal. The inevitable is sure to happen; if the wind is to blow, it\nwill blow, but the eternal serenity remains untouched by these blasts.\nLike the starlit sky above the tempest, truth and justice sit enthroned\nabove all revolutions.\n\n\nXII.\n\nSuch was this immeasurable Convention, like an intrenched encampment of\nthe human race attacked simultaneously by all the powers of darkness;\nthe camp-fires of an army of ideas besieged by its foes, an immense\nbivouac of human intellect on the slope of a precipice. Nothing in\nhistory can be compared to this Assembly, which contained within itself\nsenate and people, conclave and street-crossing, Areopagus and public\nsquare, tribunal and accused.\n\nThe Convention always yielded to the wind; but this wind came from the\nmouth of the people, and it was the breath of God.\n\nAnd to-day, after the lapse of eighty years, every time the Convention\npresents itself to the mind of any man whomsoever, whether philosopher\nor historian, he cannot but pause and meditate; since no man can be\nindifferent to that grand procession of shadows.\n\n\n[Illustration 069]\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nMARAT IN THE GREEN-ROOM.\n\n\nOn the day following the interview in the Rue du Paon, Marat, according\nto the intention which he had announced to Simonne \u00c3\u0089vrard, went to the\nConvention.\n\nThere chanced to be present a certain marquis, Louis de Montaut, an\nadmirer of Marat,--the same who afterwards presented to the Convention\na decimal clock surmounted by a bust of Marat.\n\nJust as Marat entered, Chabot approached Montant. \"Ci-devant--\" he said.\n\nMontaut looked up.\n\n\"Why do you call me ci-devant?\"\n\n\"Because that's what you are.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Of course, since you were once a marquis.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"My father was a soldier; my grandfather was a weaver.\"\n\n\"What folly is this, Montaut?\"\n\n\"My name is not Montaut.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"My name is Maribon.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" declared Chabot; \"it is all one to me.\"\n\nAnd he added, between his teeth,--\n\n\"Every man, nowadays, pretends that he is no marquis.\"\n\nMarat stopped in the left-hand corridor and looked at Montaut and\nChabot.\n\nWhenever he came in, a murmur would pass through the crowd, but always\nat a respectful distance; it was quiet in his immediate vicinity. Marat\npaid no attention whatever. He scorned the croaking of the frogs.\n\nIn this dim shadow obscuring the lower benches, Conp\u00c3\u00a9 de l'Oise,\nPrunelle, Villars,--a bishop who afterwards became a member of the\nFrench Academy,--Boutroue, Petit, Plaichard, Bonet, Thibaudeau,\nValdruche, pointed him out to one another.\n\n\"Look! There is Marat!\"\n\n\"He is not ill, then?\"\n\n\"Probably he is, since he is here in a dressing-gown.\"\n\n\"In a dressing-gown?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"What liberties he allows himself!\"\n\n\"That he should dare to come to the Convention in such a garb!\"\n\n\"Since he came one day crowned with laurels, he might be expected to\nappear in a dressing-gown.\"\n\n\"With his face of copper, and teeth of verdigris.\"\n\n\"His dressing-gown seems new.\"\n\n\"What is it made of?\"\n\n\"A kind of rep.\"\n\n\"Striped?\"\n\n\"Just see the lapels!\"\n\n\"They are made of fur.\"\n\n\"Tiger-skin?\"\n\n\"No, ermine.\"\n\n\"Imitation.\"\n\n\"He has stockings on.\"\n\n\"Remarkable!\"\n\n\"And shoes with buckles.\"\n\n\"Silver buckles!\"\n\n\"Camboulas' sabots will not soon forgive him that.\"\n\nOn the opposite benches they pretended not to see Marat, but continued\nto talk of other matters. Santhonax accosted Dussaulx.\n\n\"Have you heard, Dussaulx?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The ci-devant Count de Brienne.\"\n\n\"The one who was at La Force with the ci-devant Duke de Villeroy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I knew them both. What about them?\"\n\n\"You know they were so frightened that they saluted all the red caps of\nthe turnkeys, and one day refused to take a hand at _piquet_ because a\npack of cards with kings and queens was offered them.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"They were guillotined yesterday.\"\n\n\"Both of them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, how did they behave in prison?\"\n\n\"Like cowards!\"\n\n\"And what sort of a figure did they cut on the scaffold?\"\n\n\"Intrepid.\"\n\nWhereupon Dussaulx exclaimed,--\n\n\"It's easier to die than to live.\"\n\nBar\u00c3\u00a8re had begun to read a report on the subject of the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e. Nine\nhundred men from Morbihan had started with cannon to relieve Nantes.\nRedon was threatened by the peasants, and Paimboeuf had been attacked.\nA fleet was cruising in the vicinity of Maindrin to prevent invasions.\nFrom Ingrande to Maure the entire left bank of the Loire bristled\nwith Royalist batteries. Three thousand peasants had taken possession\nof Pornic. They cried: \"Vive les Anglais!\" Bar\u00c3\u00a8re read a letter from\nSanterre to the Convention ending with the following words:\n\n      \"Seven thousand peasants attacked Vannes. We repulsed\n      them, and they retreated, leaving four cannon in our\n      hands.\"\n\n\"And how many prisoners?\" interrupted a voice. Bar\u00c3\u00a8re went on,--\n\n      \"Postscript. We have no prisoners, because we have ceased\n      to take them.\"[1]\n\nMarat, as usual, stood motionless, paying no attention to what was\ngoing on, apparently absorbed in deep preoccupation.\n\nHe held a paper in his hand, crumpling it between his fingers. Had it\nbeen unfolded, certain words in the handwriting of Momoro, in answer,\nno doubt, to some question of Marat, might have been read:--\n\n      \"Nothing can be done in opposition to the supreme\n      authority of the delegated commissioners, especially\n      those of the Committee of Public Safety. Although\n      G\u00c3\u00a9nissieux said in the session of May 6th, 'Each\n      commissioner is more than a king,' it had no effect. Life\n      and death are in their hands. Massade at Angers, Trullard\n      at Saint-Amand, Nyon with General Marc\u00c3\u00a9, Parrein in the\n      army of the 'Sables,' Millier in the army of Niort, are\n      all-powerful. The Jacobin Club has gone so far as to\n      appoint Parrein brigadier-general. Circumstances excuse\n      everything. A delegate of the Committee of Public Safety\n      may hold in check a commander-in-chief.\"\n\nMarat ceased crumpling the paper, put it in his pocket, and walked\nslowly towards Montaut and Chabot, who had continued their conversation\nand had not seen him enter.\n\nChabot was just saying,--\n\n\"Maribon, or Montaut, listen to this: I have just left the Committee of\nPublic Safety.\"\n\n\"And what are they doing there?\"\n\n\"They are setting a priest to watch a noble.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"A noble like yourself--\"\n\n\"I am not a noble,\" said Montaut.\n\n\"To be watched by a priest--\"\n\n\"Like you.\"\n\n\"I am not a priest,\" said Chabot.\n\nAnd both men began to laugh.\n\n\"Please give us a more definite account.\"\n\n\"Well, here is the tale: a priest, Cimourdain by name, has been\ndelegated with full powers to a Viscount Gauvain, who is in command of\nthe exploring division of the army of the coast. Now, the difficulty\nis, to prevent the nobleman from cheating and the priest from\nbetraying.\"\n\n\"There will be no trouble about that. You have only to make death the\nthird party.\"\n\n\"That is what I came for,\" said Marat They looked up.\n\n\"Good-day, Marat,\" said Chabot; \"we seldom see you at our sessions.\"\n\n\"My doctor has ordered baths,\" replied Marat.\n\n\"Ah, you had better beware of baths,\" continued Chabot. \"Seneca died in\na bath.\"\n\nMarat smiled.\n\n\"There is no Nero here, Chabot.\"\n\n\"I should say there was, since you are here,\" said a gruff voice.\n\nIt was Danton, who was passing on his way towards his seat.\n\nMarat did not turn round.\n\nHe thrust his head in between the faces of Montaut and Chabot.\n\n\"Listen, I have come on serious business; one of us three must propose\nthe draft of a decree to the Convention to-day.\"\n\n\"I am not the man,\" said Montaut. \"They pay no attention to me; I am a\nmarquis.\"\n\n\"Neither will they listen to me; I am a Capuchin,\" said Chabot.\n\n\"Nor to me, for I am Marat\"\n\nA silence ensued.\n\nMarat, absorbed in his own thoughts, was not accessible to questions;\nstill, Montaut ventured upon one.\n\n\"What decree would you like the Assembly to pass, Marat?\"\n\n\"A decree inflicting the penalty of death on any military chief who\nallows a rebel prisoner to escape.\"\n\nChabot interposed.\n\n\"There is such a decree already; it was made a law at the end of April.\"\n\n\"That amounts to nothing whatever,\" said Marat. \"Everywhere throughout\nthe Vend\u00c3\u00a9e prisoners are helped to escape, and any man may shelter them\nwith impunity.\"\n\n\"That is because the decree is no longer in force, Marat.\"\n\n\"It must be revived, Chabot.\"\n\n\"No doubt it needs to be revived.\"\n\n\"And to accomplish this we must address the Convention.\"\n\n\"There will be no need to do that, Marat; the Committee of Public\nSafety will suffice.\"\n\n\"The object will be attained,\" added Montaut, \"if the Committee of\nPublic Safety order the decree to be placarded in every Commune of the\nVend\u00c3\u00a9e, and make two or three suitable examples.\"\n\n\"Of men in authority,\" rejoined Chabot. \"Of the generals.\"\n\nMarat mumbled between his teeth, \"Yes, I suppose that will answer.\"\n\n\"Marat,\" continued Chabot, \"go and say that to the Committee of Public\nSafety yourself.\"\n\nMarat gazed steadily at him, which was not pleasant, even for a Chabot.\n\n\"Chabot,\" he said, \"the Committee of Public Safety meets at\nRobespierre's house; I do not visit Robespierre.\"\n\n\"Then I will go myself,\" said Montaut.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Marat.\n\nThe next day a mandate from the Committee of Public Safety was sent in\nall directions, ordering the authorities of the cities and villages of\nthe Vend\u00c3\u00a9e not only to publish, but also strictly to execute, a decree\nawarding the penalty of death to all who were known to aid and abet the\nescape of brigands and rebel prisoners.\n\nThis decree was but the first step. The Convention was to go still\nfarther than that. Several months later, on the 11th Brumaire, in the\nyear II. (November, 1793), when Laval opened its gates to the Vendean\nfugitives, it decreed that every city that sheltered rebels should be\ndemolished and destroyed.\n\nThe princes of Europe, on their side, in the manifesto of the Duke of\nBrunswick, suggested by the \u00c3\u0089migr\u00c3\u00a9s and drawn up by the Marquis of\nLinnon, steward to the Duke of Orleans, declared that every Frenchman\ntaken with arms in his hand should be shot, and if but a hair fell from\nthe head of the king, Paris should be razed to the ground.\n\nCruelty against barbarity.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Moniteur, vol. xix. p. 81.]\n\n\n[Illustration: In the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e 066]\n\n\n\n\nPART III.\n\n\nIN THE VEND\u00c3\u0089E.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I.\n\n\nTHE VEND\u00c3\u0089E.\n\n\n[Illustration 067]\n\n\nI.\n\n\nTHE FORESTS.\n\n\n[Illustration 068]\n\n\nThere were in Brittany at that time seven much-dreaded forests. The\nVendean war was a rebellion among priests, and the forest was their\nauxiliary. The spirits of darkness help one another.\n\nThe seven Black Forests of Brittany were the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, which\nbars the passage between Dol and Avranches; the forest of Princ\u00c3\u00a9, eight\nmiles in circumference; the forest of Paimpont, abounding in ravines\nand brooks, and almost inaccessible in the direction of Baignon, with\nan easy retreat towards Concornet, which was a Royalist town; the\nforest of Rennes, whence could be heard the tocsin of the Republican\nparishes, always numerous in the neighborhood of cities,--there it\nwas that Puysaye lost Focard; the forest of Machecoul, where Charette\ndwelt like a wild beast; the forest of La Garnache, belonging to\nthe Tr\u00c3\u00a9moilles, the Gauvains, and the Rohans; and the forest of\nBroc\u00c3\u00a9liande, that had been appropriated by the fairies.\n\nOne nobleman in Brittany was called the _Seigneur des Sept-For\u00c3\u00aats_, and\nhe was the Viscount de Fontenay, a Breton prince.\n\nFor the Breton prince was a creation quite distinct from the French\nprince. The Rohans were Breton princes. Gamier de Saintes, in his\nreport to the Convention of the 15th Niv\u00c3\u00b4se, year II., thus describes\nthe Prince de Talmont,--\"That Capet of brigands, the sovereign of Maine\nand Normandy.\"\n\nThe events that transpired in Breton forests from 1792 to 1800\nwould form a history in themselves, blending like a legend with the\nstupendous affair of the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nThere is truth in legend as well as in history, but the nature of\nlegendary truth differs from that of historic truth. The former may be\ninvention; but its result is reality. Both, however, have the same aim,\ninasmuch as each strives to depict the eternal type of mankind under\nthe transitory specimen.\n\nThe Vend\u00c3\u00a9e cannot be fully understood unless legend is allowed to\nsupplement history; history must present the total effect, legend\ndescribe the details.\n\nWe cannot refuse to acknowledge that the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e is well worth the\ntrouble, for it is a prodigy.\n\nThat War of the Ignorant, so dull and yet so splendid, so detestable\nand at the same time so magnificent, was at once the despair and the\npride of the nation. In the act of wounding France, the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e covered\nher with glory. There are times when human society presents enigmas\nwhose meaning becomes evident to the wise, while for the ignorant it\nremains obscure, signifying nothing more than violence and barbarism.\nA philosopher is slow to accuse. He takes into consideration the\ndisturbances caused by these problems, which never pass without casting\na shadow like a cloud.\n\nHe who would understand the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e must picture the antagonism of the\nFrench Revolution on the one hand, and the Breton peasant on the other.\n\nFace to face with these unparalleled events,--this tremendous\npromise of every advantage at once, this fit of rage on the part of\ncivilization, this excess of infuriated progress, to be accompanied by\nan improvement that could neither be measured nor understood,--stands\nthis serious and peculiar savage, this man with the keen eyes and long\nhair, who lives on milk and chestnuts; whose ideas are bounded by his\nroof, by his hedge, and by his ditch; who can distinguish each village\nby the sound of its bells; who drinks nothing but water, yet wears a\nleather waistcoat worked with silken arabesques,--a man uncultivated,\ndressed in embroidered garments, who tattoes his clothes as his\nancestors the Celts used to tattoo their faces; who respects his master\nin the person of his executioner; who speaks a dead language, which is\nequivalent to keeping his mind in a tomb, goading his oxen, sharpening\nhis scythe, hoeing his black grain, kneading his buckwheat cake;\nreverencing, first his plough, and secondly his grandmother; believing\nin the Blessed Virgin, and in the White Lady no less; worshipping\nbefore the altar, and also before the tall mysterious stone set up in\nthe midst of the moor,--a laborer in the plain, a fisherman on the\ncoast, a poacher in the thicket, devoted to his kings, his priests,\nhis lords, and to his very lice; a man of pensive mood, often standing\nmotionless for hours on the wide deserted shore, listening gloomily to\nthe sounding sea.\n\nIs it then strange that this blind man failed to appreciate the light?\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nMEN.\n\n\nThe peasant has confidence in the field that nourishes him, no less\nthan in the wood that serves to hide him. It is no easy matter to\nconceive an idea of the forests of Brittany. They were cities in\nthemselves. Nothing could be more secret, more silent, or more\nimpenetrable than those tangled thickets of briers and branches\noffering shelter, repose, and silence. No solitude could seem more\ndeath-like and sepulchral; if one could, like a flash of lightning,\nhave felled the entire forest at a single stroke, a swarm of human\nbeings would have stood forth revealed within those shades.\n\nConcealed on the outside by coverings of stones and branches were\nwells, round and narrow, sinking at first vertically and then\nhorizontally, widening under the ground like funnels, and ending in\ndark chambers. Wells like these discovered by Westermann in Brittany\nwere also found in Egypt by Cambyses,--with this difference, that\nwhile the Egyptian caves in the desert held dead men only, those in the\nforests of Brittany contained living human beings. One of the wildest\nglades in the woods of Misdon, intersected by subterranean passages and\ncells, wherein a mysterious population moved to and fro, was called \"la\nGrande Ville.\" Another glade, just as deserted above ground, and no\nless populous below, was called \"la Place Royale.\"\n\nThis subterranean life in Brittany had existed from time immemorial.\nMan had there sought refuge from his brother man. Hence these\nhiding-places, like the dens of reptiles, hollowed out under the trees.\nThey dated from the times of the Druids, and some of the crypts were as\nold as the dolmens. All the evil spirits of legend and the monsters of\nhistory passed over this gloomy land,--Teutates, C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Ho\u00c3\u00abl, N\u00c3\u00a9om\u00c3\u00a8ne,\nGeoffrey of England, Alain of the iron glove, Pierre Mauclerc, the\nFrench house of Blois and the English house of Montfort, kings and\ndukes, the nine barons of Brittany, the judges of the Great Days, the\ncounts of Nantes who wrangled with the counts of Rennes, highwaymen,\nbanditti, Free Lances, Ren\u00c3\u00a9 II., the Viscount de Rohan, the king's\ngovernors, the \"good Duke de Chaulnes\" who hung the peasants under\nthe windows of Madame de S\u00c3\u00a9vign\u00c3\u00a9, the seignorial butcheries in the\nfifteenth century, religious wars in the sixteenth and seventeenth,\nand the thirty thousand dogs trained to hunt men in the eighteenth.\nDuring this wild trampling, the people made up their minds that it\nwould be better for them to disappear. One after the other, the\ntroglodytes seeking to escape from the Celts, the Celts from the\nRomans, the Bretons from the Normans, the Huguenots from the Catholics,\nand the smugglers from the excise officers, had sought refuge first\nin the forests, then underground. It is thus that tyranny forces the\nnations to the last resource of the hunted beast. For two thousand\nyears had despotism, in all its varied forms,--of conquest, vassalage,\nfanaticism, and taxation,--hunted down this unfortunate and distracted\nBrittany; it was like an inexorable _battue_ constantly changing its\nmethod of attack. Men disappeared underground. While that terror which\nis a sort of rage was brooding in human souls, and the dens in the\nforests were in waiting for them, the French Republic sprang into\nexistence. Brittany, thinking this compulsory deliverance but a new\nform of oppression, broke into open rebellion,--a mistake usually made\nby enslaved peoples.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nCONNIVANCE OF MEN AND FORESTS.\n\n\nThus the tragic forests of Brittany once more resumed their ancient\nr\u00c3\u00b4le of servant and accomplice to revolution.\n\nThe subsoil of such a forest was like a madrepore pierced and\nintersected in all directions by a secret labyrinth of mines, cells,\nand galleries. Each of these hidden cells was large enough to shelter\nfive or six men; the only difficulty was in breathing. Certain\nmysterious ciphers have been preserved that give us a clew to this\npowerful organization of the peasant rebellion. In Ille-et-Vilaine, in\nthe forest of Pertre, where the Prince de Talmont had taken refuge,\nnot a breath could be heard, not a trace of human life was visible;\nand yet Focard had there mustered six thousand men. In Morbihan,\nin the forest of Meulac, not a man of all the eight thousand there\nwas to be seen. These two forests, le Pertre and Meulac, are not,\nhowever, to be reckoned among the great Breton forests. It would have\nbeen dangerous walking over their explosive soil. These treacherous\ncopses, with their multitudes of combatants lurking in a sort of\nsubterranean labyrinth, were like great black sponges, from which,\nbeneath the pressure of Revolution's giant foot, civil war gushed\nforth. Invisible battalions were lying in wait. This army, unknown to\nthe world, wound its way along under the feet of the Republican armies,\nleaping out of the ground at times in vast numbers, and disappearing\nas suddenly,--possessing the power of vanishing at will no less than\nthe gift of ubiquity. It was like the descending avalanche that leaves\nbut a cloud of dust behind, colossi with a marvellous genius for\ncontraction, giants in warfare, dwarfs in flight, jaguars with the\nhabits of moles. Moreover, there were woods as well as forests. As the\nvillage ranks below the city, so the woods, bear a similar relation\nto the forests, which they serve to connect after the fashion of a\nlabyrinth. Old castles, fortresses once upon a time, hamlets that had\nbeen camps, farms covered with ambushes and snares, divided by ditches\nand fenced in by trees, formed the meshes of the net in which the\nRepublican armies were caught.\n\nAll this was called the Bocage.\n\nThere was the wood of Misdon, with a pond in its midst, held by\nJean Chouan; the wood of Gennes, held by Taillefer; the wood of La\nHuisserie, held by Gouge-le-Bruant; the wood of La Charnie, held by\nCourtill\u00c3\u00a9-le-B\u00c3\u00a2tard, called the apostle Saint Paul, chief of the\ncamp of the Vache-Noire; the wood of Burgault, in possession of that\nenigmatical Monsieur Jacques, who was to meet with a mysterious death\nin the vault of Juvardeil; the wood of Charreau, where Pimousse and\nPetit-Prince, when attacked by the garrison of Ch\u00c3\u00a2teauneuf, captured\nthe grenadiers from the ranks of the Republicans in a hand-to-hand\nencounter; the wood of La Heureuserie, which witnessed the defeat of\nthe military post of Longue-Faye; the wood of L'Aulne, whence the road\nbetween Rennes and Laval could be watched; the wood of La Gravelle,\nwon by a Prince of La Tremoille in a bowling-match; the wood of Lorges\nin the C\u00c3\u00b4tes-du-Nord, where Charles de Boishardy succeeded Bernard de\nVilleneuve; the wood of Bagnard, near Fontenay, where Lescure offered\nbattle to Chalbos,--a challenge accepted by the latter although they\nwere five to one against him; the wood of La Durondais, over which\nAlain le Redru and H\u00c3\u00a9rispoux, sons of Charles the Bald, quarrelled in\nformer times; the wood of Croque-loup, on the edge of that moor where\nCoupereau used to shear the prisoners; the wood of La Croix-Bataille,\nwitness to the Homeric insults hurled against each other by Jambe\nd'Argent and Mori\u00c3\u00a8re; the wood of La Saudraie, which the reader will\nremember was reconnoitred by the Paris battalion; and many others\nbesides.\n\nIn several of these forests and woods there were not only subterranean\nvillages grouped around the burrow-like headquarters of the chief,\nbut actual hamlets composed of low cabins hidden under the trees in\nsuch numbers that the forest was often filled with them. Sometimes the\nsmoke betrayed their presence. Two among these hamlets in the forest\nof Misdon have become famous,--Lorri\u00c3\u00a8re, near L\u00c3\u00a9tang, and the group of\nhuts called La Rue-de-Bau, in the direction of Saint-Ouen-les-Toits.\n\n[Illustration 069]\n\nThe women lived in the huts, and the men in the caves. The galleries\nof the fairies and the old Celtic mines were utilized for purposes\nof warfare. Food was conveyed to the dwellers underground, and some\nthere were who, forgotten, died of hunger. They, however, were awkward\nfellows, who had not sense enough to uncover their wells. This cover,\nusually made of moss and branches, and arranged so skilfully that it\nwas impossible to distinguish it on the outside from the surrounding\ngrass, was yet easily opened and closed from the inside. A den like\nthis, known under the name of \"la loge,\" was hollowed out with great\ncare, and the earth taken therefrom thrown into some neighboring pond.\nThe inside walls and the floor were afterwards lined with ferns and\nmoss. It was fairly comfortable, save for the lack of light, fire,\nbread, and air.\n\nTo rise from underground and appear among the living without due\nprecaution, possibly to disinter themselves at an inappropriate\nmoment, would be a serious business. They might chance to encounter an\narmy on the march. Those were dangerous woods, snares with a double\ntrap. The Blues dared not enter, and the Whites dared not come out.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nTHEIR LIFE UNDER GROUND.\n\n\nThe men, wearied of living in these beasts' lairs, would sometimes\nventure to come out by night and dance on the neighboring moor; or else\nthey said prayers, by way of killing time. \"Jean Chouan made us say our\nbeads from morning till night,\" says Bourdoiseau.\n\nIt was almost impossible, when the season arrived, to prevent the men\nof Bas-Maine from going to the F\u00c3\u00aate de la Gerbe. They clung to their\nown ideas. Tranche-Montagne says that Denys disguised himself as a\nwoman, to go to the play at Laval; after which he returned to his den.\n\nAll at once they would rush out in search of death, changing one tomb\nfor another.\n\nSometimes they would lift the cover of their grave and listen for any\nchance sounds of battle in the distance, following it with their ears,\nguided by the steady fire of the Republicans and the intermittent\nshots of the Royalists. When the platoon-firing suddenly ceased, they\nknew that the Royalists had lost the day; but if the scattering shots\ncontinued, receding into the distance, it was a sign that the victory\nwas theirs. The Whites always pursued; the Blues never did so, because\nthe country was against them.\n\nThese underground belligerents were wonderfully well-informed.\nNothing could be more rapid or more mysterious than their means of\ncommunication. The bridges and wagons had all been destroyed, yet they\nfound means to keep one another informed of all that went on, and to\nsend timely warning. Messenger-stations of danger were established from\nforest to forest, from village to village, from hut to hut, from bush\nto bush.\n\nA stupid-looking peasant might be seen passing along; he carried\ndespatches in his hollow staff.\n\nFurnished by Bo\u00c3\u00a9tidoux, a former constituent, with the modern\nRepublican passport, in which a blank space is left for the name,\nbundles of which were in the possession of that traitor, they were\nenabled to travel from one end of Brittany to the other.\n\nIt was impossible to take them by surprise. Puysaye[1] states that\n\"secrets confided to upwards of four thousand individuals have been\nreligiously kept.\"\n\nIt seemed as though this quadrilateral, closed on the south by the line\nfrom Sables to Thouars, on the east by that from Thouars to Saumur as\nwell as by the river of Thou\u00c3\u00a9, on the north by the Loire, and on the\nwest by the ocean, possessed a system of nerves in common, and that no\nsingle part of the ground could stir without shaking the whole. In\nthe twinkling of an eye, they learned in Lu\u00c3\u00a7on what was going on in\nNoirmoutier, and the camp of La Lou\u00c3\u00a9 knew what was passing in the camp\nLa Croix-Morineau. It was as if the birds had carried the news. On the\n7th Messidor, in the year III., Hoche wrote: \"One might have supposed\nthey had telegraphs.\"\n\nThey formed clans, as in Scotland, and each parish had its own captain.\nMy father fought in this war, and I know whereof I am speaking.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nTHEIR LIFE IN WARFARE.\n\n\n[Illustration 070]\n\n\nMany of them had nothing but pikes; but good hunting-rifles were\nplentiful, and no marksmen were more expert than the poachers of the\nBocage and the smugglers of Loroux. They were eccentric, terrible, and\nintrepid fighters. The proclamation of a decree to levy three hundred\nthousand men was the signal for ringing the tocsin in six hundred\nvillages. The flames burst forth in all directions at once. Poitou\nand the Anjou revolted on the same day. Let us remark that the first\nrumbling was heard on the 8th of July, 1792, a month previous to the\n10th of August, on the moor of Kerbader. Alain Redeler, whose name is\nnow forgotten, was the forerunner of La Rochejaquelein and Jean Chouan.\nThe Royalists forced all able-bodied men to march, under penalty of\ndeath. They confiscated harnesses, wagons, and provisions. Sapinaud\nat once assembled three thousand soldiers, Cathelineau ten thousand,\nStofflet twenty thousand, and Charette took possession of Noirmoutier.\nThe Viscount de Sc\u00c3\u00a9peaux roused the Haut-Anjou, the Chevalier de\nDieuzie the Entre-Vilaine-et-Loire, Tristan l'Hermite the Bas-Maine,\nthe barber Gaston the city of Gu\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9e, and the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Bernier all the\nothers.\n\nIt required but little to excite the masses. A great black cat was\nplaced in the tabernacle of a priest who had taken the civil oath,--a\n\"priest-juror,\" as he was called,--whence it suddenly leaped forth in\nthe middle of the Mass. \"It's the Devil!\" cried the peasants, and a\nwhole district rose in revolt. Sometimes flames would be seen issuing\nfrom the confessionals. For assailing the Blues and crossing the\nravines, they had sticks fifteen feet long, called the \"ferte,\"--a\nweapon of defence, which was likewise available for flight. In the very\nheat of the conflict, when the peasants were attacking the Republican\nsquares, if they chanced to see on the battlefield a cross or a chapel,\nall fell on their knees and said their prayers under the fire of the\nenemy; and after finishing the rosary, those who had not been killed\nrushed upon the enemy. Alas! what giants were these! They loaded their\nmuskets on the run; that was their special talent. They could be made\nto believe anything. Their priests showed them other priests whose\nnecks had been reddened by a tightly drawn cord, saying to them:\n\"These are the guillotined come to life again.\" They had their fits of\nchivalrous emotion; they paid military honors to Fesque, a Republican\nstandard-bearer, who had allowed himself to be sabred without once\nlosing hold of his banner. These peasants were at times derisive;\nthey called the married Republican priests \"sans-calottes devenus\nsans-culottes.\"[2] At first they stood in awe of the cannon; but after\na while they dashed upon them with no other weapons than their sticks,\nand captured several. The first one they took was a fine bronze cannon,\nwhich they baptized \"le Missionnaire;\" another gun, dating from the\ntimes of the Catholic wars, and which had Richelieu's arms and an\nimage of the Virgin engraved upon it, they named Marie-Jeanne. When\nthey lost Fontenay, they lost Marie-Jeanne, around which six hundred\npeasants fell fighting with unflinching courage.\n\n[Illustration 071]\n\nLater, they recaptured Fontenay in order to recover Marie-Jeanne,\nwhich they brought back under the fleur-de-lis flag, covering it with\nflowers, and making the women who passed by kiss it. But two cannon\nwere insufficient. It was Stofflet who had captured Marie-Jeanne;\nCathelineau, envying him, left Pin-en-Mange, attacked Jallais, and took\npossession of a third one. Forest fell on Saint-Florent and captured\na fourth. Two other commanders, Chouppes and Saint-Paul, were still\nmore successful. They manufactured imitation-cannon from the trunks\nof trees, using manikins for gunners; and with this artillery, over\nwhich they made merry, they forced the Blues to retreat to Mareuil.\nAt that time they were in the height of their glory. Later, when\nChalbos defeated La Marsonni\u00c3\u00a8re, the peasants left behind them on the\ndishonored battlefield two cannon, bearing the arms of England. At\nthat time the French princes were paid by England, who, as Nantiat\nwrites on the 10th of May, 1794, \"remitted funds to Monseigneur because\nMr. Pitt was told that it was the proper thing to do.\" Mellinet, in\na report of the 31st of March, says: \"The cry of the rebels is,'Long\nlive the English!'\" The peasants tarried for purposes of pillage, for\nthese devotees were thieves. Savages have their vices, and it is to\nthese that civilization appeals. Puysaye says: \"Several times I have\nsaved the town of Pl\u00c3\u00a9lan from pillage.\" And again he says that he\nrefrained from entering Montfort: \"I made a circuit in order to avoid\nthe sacking of the houses of the Jacobins.\"[3] They pillaged Cholet;\nthey sacked Chalans; passing by Granville, they robbed Ville-Dieu. They\ncalled the country-people who joined the Blues the \"Jacobin herd,\" and\nexterminated them more fiercely than they did their other foes. They\nenjoyed carnage like soldiers, and revelled in massacre like brigands.\nTo shoot the _patauds_ was their delight. They called it breaking their\nfast.\n\nAt Fontenay one of their priests, named Barbotin, killed an old man\nwith a blow from his sabre. At Saint-Germain-sur-Ille [4] one of their\ncaptains, a nobleman, shot the solicitor of the Commune, and took his\nwatch. At Machecoul for the space of five weeks they made a practice of\nslaughtering the Republicans at the rate of thirty a day. Each string\nof thirty they called a rosary. Behind this row of men there was a\ntrench prepared, into which the men fell back as they were shot; and\nwhen, as sometimes happened, a man was still alive, he was buried as if\nhe were dead. Such acts have been witnessed in our own times. Joubert,\npresident of the district, had his wrists sawed off. They had handcuffs\nfor the Blues made expressly to cut the flesh. They slaughtered them\nin the public squares, sounding the halloo. Charette, who signed\nhimself, \"Fraternity, Chevalier Charette,\" and who, like Marat, wore a\nhandkerchief knotted around his brows, burned the city of Pornic, with\nthe inhabitants in their dwellings.\n\nMeanwhile Carrier was frightful. Terror answered unto terror. The\nBreton rebel looked very much like the Greek insurgent, clad as he was\nin a short jacket, with a gun slung across his shoulders, leggings,\nwide trousers of a material not unlike fustian. The lads resembled a\nGreek klepht. Henri de la Rochejaquelein went into this war at the age\nof twenty-one, armed with a pair of pistols and a stick. There were one\nhundred and fifty-four divisions in the Vendean army. They laid regular\nsieges. The city of Bressuire was invested by them for three days. On\na Good Friday ten thousand peasants bombarded the city of des Sables\nwith red-hot cannon-balls. They succeeded in destroying in one day the\nfourteen Republican cantonments from Montign\u00c3\u00a9 to Courbeveilles. On\nthe high wall at Thouars the following astonishing dialogue was heard\nbetween La Rochejaquelein and a lad: \"Fellow!\" \"Here I am.\"--\"Lend me\nyour shoulders to climb up on.\" \"Take them.\"--\"Give me your gun.\" \"Here\nit is.\" And La Rochejaquelein leaped into the city, and thus without\nthe aid of scaling-ladders they captured the very towers once besieged\nby Duguesclin. They valued a cartridge far beyond a gold louis. They\nburst into tears whenever they lost sight of their village belfry.\nTo run away seemed to them the simplest affair in the world. At such\ntimes their leaders would exclaim, \"Throw away your sabots, but keep\nyour guns!\" When munitions failed, they said their beads, and proceeded\nto take the powder from the caissons of the Republican artillery; and\nafterwards d'Elb\u00c3\u00a9e demanded powder from the English. On the approach\nof the enemy they concealed their wounded in the tall grain, or among\nthe brakes, and came back for them after the engagement was over. They\nwore no uniform, and their clothing was falling to pieces. Noblemen as\nwell as peasants wore any rags that came to hand. Roger Mouliniers was\narrayed in a turban and dolman taken from the ward-robe of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre\nde La Fl\u00c3\u00a8che; the Chevalier de Beauvilliers had a barrister's gown,\nand a lady's bonnet over a woollen cap. All wore the white belt and\nscarf. The different grades were indicated by a knot. Stofflet wore a\nred knot, La Rochejaquelein a black one. Wimpfen, a semi-Girondist, and\nwho moreover had never been out of Normandy, wore the armlets of the\nCarabots of Caen.\n\nThey had women in their ranks,--Madame de Lescure, who afterwards\nbecame Madame de la Rochejaquelein; Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se de Mollien, mistress\nof La Rouarie, she who burned the list of parishes; Madame de la\nRochefoucauld, young and beautiful, who sabre in hand rallied the\npeasants at the foot of the Tower of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Puy-Rousseau; and\nAntoinette Adams, styled the Chevalier Adams, so brave that when\ncaptured she was shot standing, out of respect for her courage. This\nepic period was a cruel one. Men behaved like maniacs. Madame de\nLescure deliberately walked her horse over the Republicans who lay\ndisabled on the battle-ground. She said they were dead, but very\npossibly they may have been only wounded. There was occasionally\na traitor among the men, but never among the women. It is true,\nMademoiselle Fleury of the French Theatre forsook La Rouarie for Marat;\nbut that was for love's sake. The commanders were often as ignorant as\nthe soldiers. M. de Sapinaud could not spell correctly; he wrote, \"Nous\n_orions_ de notre _caut\u00c3\u00a9._\"\n\n[Illustration 072]\n\nThe leaders hated one another. The captains of the Marais cried, \"Down\nwith the Mountaineers!\" Their cavalry was few in numbers, and difficult\nto form. Puysaye writes: \"A man who would cheerfully give me his two\nsons grows cool when I ask for one of his horses.\" Poles, pitchforks,\nscythes, muskets, old and new, poacher's knives, spits, iron-pointed\ncud-gels studded with nails,--such were their weapons. Some carried\na cross made of two human bones. They rushed to the attack with\nshouts, springing up at once from all quarters,--from woods, hills,\nunderbrush, and hollow roads,--ranging themselves in a circle, killing,\nexterminating, striking terror, and then disappearing. Whenever they\npassed a Republican town they cut down the liberty-pole, set it on\nfire, and forming in a circle, danced around it. All their activity\nwas displayed by night. The rule of the Vendean is to be always\nunexpected. They would march fifteen leagues in utter silence, without\nso much as stirring a blade of grass. At night, their chiefs having\ndetermined in a council of war at what point the Republican posts were\nto be surprised the next day, they loaded their muskets, mumbled their\nprayers, and taking off their sabots, filed through the woods in long\ncolumns, barefoot across the heather and moss, noiseless, without\nuttering a sound or drawing a breath, like a procession of cats in the\ndarkness.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTHE SOUL OF THE EARTH PASSES INTO MAN.\n\n\nThe number of the rebels in the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, including men, women, and\nchildren, cannot be estimated at less than five hundred thousand.\nTuffin de la Rouarie states the sum total of the combatants to have\nbeen half a million.\n\nThe federalists helped them, and the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e had the Gironde on its\nside also. Loz\u00c3\u00a8re sent thirty thousand men into the Bocage. Eight\ndepartments formed a coalition: five in Brittany, three in Normandy.\n\u00c3\u0089vreux, who fraternized with Caen, was represented in the rebellion\nby Chaumont, its mayor, and Gardembas, a man of note. Buzot, Gorsas,\nand Barbaroux at Caen, Brissot at Moulins, Chassan at Lyons,\nRabaut-Saint-\u00c3\u0089tienne at Nismes, Meillan and Duch\u00c3\u00a2tel in Brittany, all\nfanned the flames of the furnace. There were two Vend\u00c3\u00a9es,--the great\narmy fighting in the forests, and the smaller one carrying on the war\nin the bushes. And this marks the difference between Charette and Jean\nChouan. The little Vend\u00c3\u00a9e was simple-minded and true; the great Vend\u00c3\u00a9e\nwas corrupt. The little Vend\u00c3\u00a9e was the better of the two. The rank of\nMarquis, lieutenant-general of the king's armies, was bestowed upon\nCharette, and he received the grand cross of Saint-Louis. Jean Chouan\nremained Jean Chouan. Charette resembles a bandit, Jean Chouan is more\nlike a paladin of old.\n\nAs to those magnanimous chiefs, Bonchamps, Lescure, La Rochejaquelein,\nthey were mistaken; the great Catholic army was an insane attempt,\nupon whose heels disaster was sure to follow; imagine a crowd of\npeasants storming Paris, a coalition of villages besieging the\nPantheon, a chorus of Christmas hymns and prayers striving to drown the\nMarseillaise, a cohort of rustics rushing upon a legion of enlightened\nminds. Mans and Savenay chastised this folly. The Vend\u00c3\u00a9e could not\ncross the Loire; that was a stride beyond its power. Civil war can\nmake no conquests. Crossing the Rhine confirms the power of C\u00c3\u00a6sar and\nadds to that of Napoleon; crossing the Loire kills La Rochejaquelein.\nThe genuine Vend\u00c3\u00a9e is the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e at home: there it is more than\ninvulnerable; it is unconquerable. At home the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e is smuggler,\nlaborer, soldier, shepherd, poacher, sharpshooter, goat-herd,\nbell-ringer, peasant, spy, assassin, sacristan, and wild beast.\n\nLa Rochejaquelein is only an Achilles, while Jean Chouan is a Proteus.\n\nThe Vend\u00c3\u00a9e failed. Other revolts have been successful, that in\nSwitzerland for instance. The difference between mountain insurgents\nlike the Swiss and forest insurgents like the Vendean, exists in the\nfact that almost invariably, owing to some fatal influence of his\nsurroundings, the former fights for an ideal, while the latter fights\nfor a prejudice. The one soars, the other crawls. The one fights for\nhumanity, the other for solitude; the one demands liberty, the other\nisolation; the one defends the commune, the other the parish. \"The\nCommons! The Commons!\" cried the heroes of Morat. The one has to do\nwith precipices, the other with quagmires; the one is the man of\ntorrents and foaming streams, the other of stagnant pools whence fever\nrises; one has the blue sky above his head, the other a thicket; one is\non the mountain-top, the other among the shadows.\n\nAn education that is gained upon the heights is quite a different\naffair from that of the shallows.\n\nA mountain is a fortress; a forest is an ambush; the former inspires\ncourage, the latter teaches trickery. The ancients placed their gods\nupon a pinnacle, and their satyrs within copses. The satyr is a savage,\nhalf man, half beast. Free countries have their Apennines, Alps,\nPyrenees, an Olympus. Parnassus is a mountain. Mont Blanc was the\ngigantic auxiliary of William Tell. Looking beyond and above those\ntitanic contests between human intellect and the darkness of night,\nwhich form the subjects of the poems of India, one sees Himalaya\ntowering overhead. Greece, Spain, Italy, Helvetia have the mountains\nfor their inspiration. Cimmeria, whether it be Germany or Brittany, has\nbut the woods. The forest tends to barbarism.\n\nThe formation of the soil influences man in many of his actions. It\nis more of an accomplice than one might imagine. When we consider\ncertain wild scenery, we feel tempted to exonerate man and accuse\nNature; we are conscious of an occult provocation on the part of\nNature; the desert has sometimes an unwholesome influence upon the\nconscience, especially on one that is not enlightened. A conscience\nmay be gigantic,--take for example Socrates or the Christ; it may be\ndwarf-like, in which case we find Atreus and Judas. A narrow conscience\nsoon displays the attributes of the reptile; it delights to haunt the\ndim forests, it is attracted by the brambles, the thorns, the marshes\nunderneath the branches, and absorbs the evil influences of the place.\nOptical illusions, mysterious mirages, the terrors of the hour and the\nplace, inspire a man with that sort of half-religious, half-animal\nfear which in every-day life begets superstition, and in times of wild\nexcitements degenerates into brutality. Hallucination holds the torch\nthat lights the path to murder. A vertigo seizes the brigand. Nature,\nmarvellous as she is, holds a double meaning that dazzles great minds\nand blinds the savage soul. When man is ignorant, and the desert is\nalive with visions, the gloom of solitude is added to the blindness\nof the intelligence; hence the abyss that sometimes yawns in the human\nsoul. There are certain rocks, ravines, copses, weird spaces between\nthe trees, revealing the blackness of the night, that incite man to\nmad and cruel deeds. One might say that the evil fiend possesses such\nspots. What tragic scenes has not the gloomy hill between Baignon and\nPl\u00c3\u00a9lan beheld!\n\nWide horizons tend to enlarge the mind; limited horizons, on the\ncontrary, circumscribe it; hence men naturally kind-hearted, such, for\ninstance, as Jean Chouan, grow narrow-minded.\n\nIt is the hatred of narrow minds for liberal ideas that fetters the\nmarch of progress. The Vendean war, a quarrel between the local and the\nuniversal idea, the contest of peasant and patriot, may be summed up in\ntwo words,--the village community and the fatherland.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nTHE VEND\u00c3\u0089E HAS RUINED BRITTANY.\n\n\n[Illustration 073]\n\n\nBrittany is an old rebel. In all her revolts in the past two\nthousand years she has had the right on her side until now; in\nher last rebellion she was wrong. And yet, after all, whether she\nwas fighting against revolution or against monarchy, against the\nacting representative or against the ruling dukes and peers, against\nthe financial resource of the assignats or the oppression of the\nsalt-tax,--whoever might be fighting, whether it were Nicolas Rapin,\nFran\u00c3\u00a7ois de La Noue, Captain Pluviaut, and The Lady of La Garnache, or\nStofflet, Coquereau, and Lechandelier de Pierreville, and whether they\nwere fighting under M. de Rohan against the king, or under M. de La\nRochejaquelein for the king, it was practically the same war, that of\nlocal government against centralization.\n\nThese ancient provinces might be compared with a pond; stagnant water\nis not inclined to flow; the wind, instead of rousing it to life,\nsimply irritates it. France ended at Finist\u00c3\u00a8re; that was the limit of\nthe space granted to man, and there the forward march of generations\nceased. \"Pause!\" cries the ocean to the land, and barbarism to\ncivilization. Whenever it feels the influence of any excitement in\nParis, whatever may be the occasion thereof, monarchy or republic,\ndespotism or liberty, it is an innovation, and Brittany bristles\nwith alarm, and says, \"Let us alone! What do you want of us?\" The\nMarais seizes its pitchfork, and the Bocage grasps its musket. All\nour attempts at reform in matters of education and legislation, our\nphilosophical systems, our men of genius, our triumphs, fail before the\nHouroux; the tocsin of Bazouges holds the French Revolution in awe;\nthe moor of Faou defies the stormy assemblies on our public squares;\nand the belfry of Haut-des-Pr\u00c3\u00a8s declares war against the Tower of the\nLouvre. Terrible blindness!\n\nThe Vendean insurrection was a melancholy misunderstanding.\n\nAn affray on a gigantic scale, wrangling among Titans, a colossal\nrebellion, fated to bequeath but one word to history, _The Vend\u00c3\u00a9e_,--a\nglorious though melancholy word, devoting itself to death for the\nabsent, sacrificing itself to egotism, squandering its dauntless\ncourage, offering itself in the cause of cowards, with neither\nforesight nor strategy, without tactics, plan, or aim, following no\nleader, accepting no responsibility, showing how powerless the human\nwill may become, uniting the spirit of chivalry with the deeds of the\nsavage, absurdity at its height, darkness screening itself from the\nlight, ignorance offering a determined resistance to truth, justice,\nright, reason, and deliverance, the terror of eight years, the\ndevastation of fourteen departments, the ravages in the fields, the\ndestruction of crops, the burning of villages, the ruin of cities, the\nmassacre of women and children, the torch applied to the thatch, the\nsword plunged into the heart, the terror of civilization, the hope of\nMr. Pitt,--such was this war, an unreasoning attempt at parricide.\n\nOn the whole, the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e has served the cause of progress by\nshowing the necessity of scattering the ancient shadows of Brittany\nby discharging into its thickets all the arrows of enlightenment\nCatastrophes have a gloomy way of settling affairs.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Vol. ii. p. 35.]\n\n[Footnote 2: The uncapped become unbreeched.--TR.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Puysaye, vol. ii. pp. 187, 434.]\n\n[Footnote 4: Ibid., p. 35.]\n\n\n[Illustration: The Three Children 074]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II.\n\n\nTHE THREE CHILDREN.\n\n\n[Illustration 075]\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nPLUS QUAM CIVILIA BELLA.\n\n\nThe summer of 1792 had been a very rainy one; but that of 1793 was\nso extremely warm that, although the civil war had gone far towards\nruining the roads in Brittany, the people--thanks to the fine\nweather--were able to travel from place to place, for a dry soil makes\nthe best road.\n\nAt the close of a clear July day, about an hour after sunset, a man\non horseback, riding from the direction of Avranches, stopped before\nthe little inn called the Croix-Blanchard, situated at the entrance of\nPontorson. For some years its sign had borne the following inscription:\n\"Good cider obtained here.\" The day had been a very warm one, but now\nthe wind was beginning to rise.\n\nThe traveller was wrapped in an ample cloak that fell over his horse's\nback. He wore a broad-brimmed hat, ornamented with a tricolored\ncockade, which was rather a bold thing to do in a country like this,\nwith its hedges and sharpshooting, for which a cockade offered an\nexcellent target. The cloak fastened around his neck was pushed back,\nleaving his arms free, and revealing at the same time a tricolored\nbelt and the butts of two pistols protruding from it, while a sabre\nhung down below the cloak. At the sound of the horses hoofs stopping\nbefore the inn the door opened, and the landlord came out, holding a\nlantern in his hand. It was just at twilight, when it is still light\nout of doors, although dark within.\n\nThe host glanced at the cockade.\n\n\"Do you mean to stop here, citizen?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, then?\"\n\n\"To Dol.\"\n\n\"In that case, you would do better to return to Avranches, or else\nremain at Pontorson.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because they are fighting at Dol.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the rider; then he continued, \"Give my horse some oats.\"\n\nThe host, having brought the trough and poured the oats into it,\nproceeded to unbridle the horse, which began at once snuffing and\nchamping, while the dialogue went on.\n\n\"Is this one of the requisition horses, citizen?\" \"No.\"\n\n\"Does it belong to you?\"\n\n\"Yes. I bought him and paid for him.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"From Paris.\"\n\n\"Not directly?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I should say not. The roads are blocked; but the post still runs.\"\n\n\"As far as Alen\u00c3\u00a7on. I left it there.\"\n\n\"Ah, it will not be long before we shall have no more posts in France.\nThe horses are all gone; one worth three hundred francs costs six\nhundred, and the price of fodder is beyond all reason. I used to be a\npostmaster; and now, you see, I keep a tavern. Out of thirteen hundred\nand thirteen postmasters, two hundred have resigned. Have you been\ntravelling according to the new tariff, citizen?\"\n\n\"You mean the tariff of the 1st of May? Yes.\"\n\n\"Twenty sous a post for a carriage, twelve for a gig, five for a van.\nDid you not buy this horse at Alen\u00c3\u00a7on?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you have been travelling all day?\"\n\n\"Yes, since dawn.\"\n\n\"And yesterday?\"\n\n\"And the day before.\"\n\n\"I should think so. You came by the way of Domfront and Mortain.\"\n\n\"And Avranches.\"\n\n\"You had better take my advice, and rest, citizen. Are you not tired?\nYour horse certainly is.\"\n\n\"Horses may be tired, but men have no right to give way to fatigue.\"\n\nAgain the host gazed at the traveller, whose face, grave, calm, and\nsevere, was framed by gray hair.\n\nCasting a glance along the road, that was deserted as far as the eye\ncould reach, he said,--\n\n\"And so you are travelling alone.\"\n\n\"I have an escort.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"My sabre and pistols.\"\n\nThe innkeeper went for a pail of water; and while he was watering the\nhorse he contemplated the traveller, saying to himself, \"He looks like\na priest, all the same.\"\n\nThe rider continued,--\n\n\"You say there is fighting at Dol?\"\n\n\"Yes. They are just about ready to begin.\"\n\n\"Who is fighting?\"\n\n\"One ci-devant against another.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"I mean that the ci-devant who is a Republican is fighting against\nanother who takes sides with the king.\"\n\n\"But there is no longer a king.\"\n\n\"There is the little fellow. But the strangest part is that the two\nci-devants are related to each other.\"\n\nHere the rider listened attentively, while the innkeeper continued:--\n\n\"One is a young man, and the other an old one. It is the grand-nephew\nfighting against his great-uncle. The uncle is a Royalist, while the\nnephew is a patriot; the uncle commands the Whites, the nephew the\nBlues. Ah! they will show no mercy to each other, you may be sure! It\nis a war to death!\"\n\n\"Death?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen. Perhaps you might like to see the polite speeches they\nfling at each other's head. Here is a placard, which the old man has\nmanaged to post on all the houses and trees, and which I found had been\nstuck on my very door.\"\n\nThe host held up his lantern to a square bit of paper glued upon one of\nthe panels of his door, and as it was written in very large characters,\nthe rider was able to read it as he sat in his saddle:--\n\n\"The Marquis de Lantenac has the honor to inform his grand-nephew the\nViscount Gauvain that if the Marquis is so fortunate as to take him\nprisoner, M. le Viscount may rest assured that he will be speedily\nshot.\"\n\n\"And here is the reply,\" continued the innkeeper.\n\nHe turned so as to throw the light of his lantern upon a second placard\non the other panel of the door, directly opposite the first one.\n\n      \"Gauvain warns Lantenac that if he catches him he will\n      have him shot.\"\n\n\"Yesterday the first placard was posted on my door,\" said the host,\n\"and this morning came the second. He was not kept waiting for his\nanswer.\"\n\nThe traveller, in an undertone, as though speaking to himself, uttered\ncertain words which the innkeeper caught without fully understanding\ntheir meaning:--\n\n\"Yes, this is more than waging war against one's native land; it\nis carrying it into the family. And it must needs be done; great\nregenerations are only to be purchased at this price.\"\n\nAnd the traveller, with his eyes still riveted to the second placard,\nlifted his hand to his hat and saluted it.\n\nThe host continued:--\n\n\"You see, citizen, this is the way matters stand. In the cities and in\nlarger towns we are in favor of revolution, but in the country they are\nopposed to it; which amounts to saying that we are Frenchmen in the\ncities, and Bretons in the villages. It is a war between the peasants\nand the townspeople. They call us _patauds_,[1] and we call them\n_rustauds._[2] They have the nobles and the priests on their side.\"\n\n\"Not all of them,\" interrupted the rider.\n\n\"That is true, citizen, for here we have a Viscount fighting against a\nMarquis; and I verily believe,\" he added aside, \"that I am speaking to\na priest at this minute.\"\n\n\"Which of the two is likely to gain the day?\"\n\n\"I should say the Viscount, so far. But he has a hard time of it. The\nold man is a tough customer. They belong to the Gauvains, a noble\nfamily in these parts, of which there are two branches; the Marquis\nde Lantenac is the head of the older, and the Viscount Gauvain of\nthe younger branch. To-day the two branches are fighting each other.\nYou never see this among trees, but often among men. This Marquis de\nLantenac is all-powerful in Brittany; the peasants regard him as a\nprince. On the very day he landed he rallied eight thousand men; in\na week three hundred parishes had risen. If he had only been able\nto establish a foothold on the coast, the English would have made a\ndescent. Luckily Gauvain, who, strange to say, is his grand-nephew,\nwas on the spot. He is a Republican commander, and has got the upper\nhand of his great-uncle. And then, as good luck would have it, this\nLantenac at the time of his arrival, when he was massacring a multitude\nof prisoners, gave orders to have two women shot, one of whom had three\nchildren, who had been adopted by a Paris battalion. This roused the\nrage of the battalion, which is called the Bonnet-Rouge. There are but\nfew of the original Parisians left, but they are desperate fighters.\nThey have been incorporated into Commandant Gauvain's division.\nNothing can resist them. Their great object is to avenge the women and\nrecapture the children. No one knows what the old Marquis did with\nthe little ones, and that is what infuriates the Parisian grenadiers.\nHad not these children been mixed up in it, this war would not have\nbeen what it is. The Viscount is a good and brave young fellow; but\nthe old man is a terrible Marquis. The peasants call this the war of\nSaint Michel against Beelzebub. You know, maybe, that Saint Michel is\nthe patron of these parts. There is a mountain named after him in the\nmiddle of the bay. They give him credit for conquering the Devil and\nburying him under another hill not far away, called Tombelaine.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured the rider. \"Tumba Beleni,--the tomb of Belenus, Belus,\nBel, Belial, Beelzebub.\"\n\n\"I see that you are well informed.\" And the host said to himself,--\n\n\"He knows Latin; surely he must be a priest.\" Then he added:--\n\n\"Well, citizen, this war is beginning all over again for the peasants.\nNo doubt they think the Royalist general is Saint Michel, and the\npatriot commander Beelzebub; but if there is a devil it is Lantenac,\nand Gauvain is an angel if there ever was one. Will you take nothing,\ncitizen?\"\n\n\"I have my gourd and a bit of bread. But you have not told me what is\ngoing on at Dol.\"\n\n\"To be sure; well, Gauvain is in command of the exploring division of\nthe coast. Now, Lantenac's plan was to stir up a general insurrection,\nto bring Lower Normandy to the aid of Lower Brittany, to throw open\nthe door to Pitt, and to lend a helping hand to the great Vendean\narmy in the shape of twenty thousand English and two hundred thousand\npeasants. Gauvain has checkmated this plan. He holds the coast and\ndrives Lantenac back into the interior and the English into the sea.\nLantenac was here, but Gauvain dislodged him, recaptured Pont-au-Beau,\ndrove him out from Avranches and Villedieu, and prevented him from\nreaching Granville. He is manoeuvring now to force him to retreat into\nthe forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, and there to surround him. Yesterday everything\nwas favorable, and Gauvain was here with his division. All at once,\nmind you, the old man, who is a shrewd one, made a point; the news\ncame that he had marched on Dol. If he should take it, and succeeds in\nestablishing a battery on Mont-Dol,--for he has artillery,--that will\ngive the English a chance to land, and then all is lost. That is the\nreason why Gauvain, who has a head on his shoulders, knowing there was\nnot a moment to be lost, consulted no one; nor did he wait for orders,\nbut giving the signal to saddle, and harnessing his artillery, he\ncollected his troops, drew his sabre, and while Lantenac is hurrying\ntowards Dol, Gauvain is all ready to pounce upon Lantenac; and Dol is\nto be the place where these two Breton heads will clash, and a famous\ncrash it will be. They are at it now.\"\n\n\"How long does it take to reach Dol?\"\n\n\"For troops with artillery carriages, at least three hours; but they\nare there now.\"\n\nThe traveller, as he listened, said,--\n\n\"You are right; I think I can hear the cannon.\" The host, too, was\nlistening.\n\n\"Yes, citizen, and the firing is steady. You had better spend the night\nhere. There is nothing to be gained by going over there.\"\n\n\"I cannot stop. I must continue my journey.\"\n\n\"You are wrong. I do not know anything about your business, but the\nrisk is great, and unless all that you hold dearest in the world is at\nstake--\"\n\n\"That is precisely the state of things,\" replied the rider.\n\n\"Now, supposing your son--\"\n\n\"You are very near the truth,\" said the rider.\n\nThe innkeeper raised his head as he said to himself,--\n\n\"And yet I thought this citizen was a priest.\" Then, after a moment's\nreflection, he added: \"But a priest may have children, after all.\"\n\n\"Put the bridle back on my horse,\" said the traveller. \"How much do I\nowe you?\"\n\nAfter receiving his pay, the host put the trough and bucket against the\nwall, and came back to the traveller.\n\n\"Since you are determined to go, take my advice. You must be going\nto Saint-Malo. Now, then, do not go by the way of Dol. There are\ntwo roads,--one leading through Dol, and the other along the coast.\nThere is very little difference in their length. The road along\nthe coast passes through Saint-Georges-de-Brehaigne, Cherrueix,\nand Hirelle-Vivier. You leave Dol to the south, and Cancale to the\nnorth, and at the end of this street, citizen, you will come to a\nplace where the two roads fork,--that of Dol to the left, that of\nSaint-Georges-de-Brehaigne to the right. Mark my words: if you go to\nDol, you will plunge headlong into the massacre; so do not take the\nleft-hand turning, but keep to the right.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the traveller.\n\nAnd he set spurs to his horse.\n\nAs it was now quite dark, he soon vanished in the gloom, and the\ninnkeeper lost sight of him.\n\nWhen the traveller reached the end of the street where the two roads\nforked, he heard the voice of the innkeeper calling to him from the\ndistance,--\n\n\"Turn to your right!\"\n\nHe turned to the left.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nDOL.\n\n\n[Illustration 076]\n\n\nDol, a Franco-Spanish city in Brittany, as the old records call it,\nis not really a city; it is a street,--a grand old Gothic street,\nwith rows of houses supported by pillars on both sides of it. These\nhouses are not built in straight lines, but stand irregularly, now\nand then elbowing into the street, which is, to be sure, a very wide\none. The rest of the town is a mere network of lanes, all leading\ninto this great diametrical street,--emptying into it, one might\nsay, like streams into a river, with Mont-Dol towering above it. The\ncity, with neither gates nor walls, could not have withstood a siege;\nbut the street was quite capable of sustaining one. The houses, like\npromontories, which but fifty years ago were still standing, and the\ntwo pillared galleries bordering the street, made it a strong and\nwell-nigh impregnable redoubt. Each of the houses was a fortress in\nitself, and the enemy would have found himself forced to capture them\none by one. Almost in the middle of the street stood the old market.\n\nThe innkeeper of the Croix-Branchard had told the truth; a furious\nbattle was raging in Dol even while he was speaking. A nocturnal\nduel between the Whites who arrived in the morning and the Blues who\nappeared at night had burst suddenly upon the town. The forces were\nunequal, the Whites numbering six thousand, while the Blues were only\nfifteen hundred; but they fought with equal fury. Surprising as it may\nseem, it was the fifteen hundred who attacked the six thousand.\n\nA mob pitted against a phalanx. On one side were six thousand peasants,\nwith images of the Sacred Heart upon their leathern waistcoats, white\nribbons on their round hats, Christian emblems on their leather cuffs,\nrosaries hanging from their belts, carrying pitchforks oftener than\nsabres, and carbines without bayonets, dragging along cannon by means\nof ropes, wretchedly equipped, undisciplined, with no suitable weapons,\nyet mad with rage. On the other side were fifteen thousand soldiers,\nwearing three-cornered hats with the tricolored cockade, long-tailed\ncoats, with broad lapels, and shoulder-belts crossed, short sabres with\ncopper hilts, muskets with long bayonets, well-drilled and disciplined,\nobedient though savage, knowing how to obey like men who could at need\ncommand, volunteers like the others, but patriots withal, although\nbarefooted and in rags; paladins in the shape of peasants fighting in\ndefence of Monarchy; barefooted heroes in the ranks of the Revolution;\nwhile the life and soul of both Royalists and Republicans was centred\nin their leaders,--Lantenac, the man advanced in years, and the young\nGauvain.\n\nStanding side by side in the Revolution with young giants like Danton,\nSaint-Just, and Robespierre, were the ideal and youthful forms of Hoche\nand Marceau, and like unto them was Gauvain.\n\nGauvain was thirty years of age, with the chest of Hercules, the\nsolemn eye of a prophet, and the laugh of a child. He never smoked; he\nneither drank nor swore. He carried a dressing-case with him throughout\nthe entire war, and took great care of his nails, his teeth, and his\nluxuriant brown hair. Whenever they halted, it was his habit carefully\nto shake his commander's uniform, riddled with balls and whitened with\ndust as it was. Though always rushing headlong into the thickest of the\nfray, he had never been wounded. His voice, unusually melodious, could\nassume at need the imperative ring of command. He set the example of\nsleeping on the ground, in the wind, the rain, and the snow, wrapped\nin his cloak, with his charming head resting on a stone. His was a\nheroic and innocent soul. Let him but take a sabre in his hand, he was\nstraightway transformed. He had that effeminate aspect that changes to\nsomething formidable in battle.\n\nA thinker and philosopher withal; in short, a youthful sage. Beautiful\nto look upon as Alcibiades, his speech showed the wisdom of Socrates.\n\nIn that grand improvisation which men called the French Revolution,\nthis young man at once became a leader.\n\nThe division which he had formed was like a Roman legion; an army on a\nsmall scale, complete in itself; it consisted of infantry and cavalry;\nit had its scouts, its pioneers, its sappers, its engineers; and as\nthe Roman legion had its catapults, this army had its cannon. Three\nwell-mounted pieces strengthened the division, while leaving it easy to\nhandle.\n\nLantenac was also a military leader, but a more accomplished one,--more\ncautious, and at the same time more daring. The veritable old hero\nis cooler than a younger man, because he is farther removed from the\nheyday of life, and more daring from the consciousness that he is\nnearer death. What has he to lose? So slight a matter. This explains\nthe bold and yet scientific manoeuvres of Lantenac. Yet on the whole,\nin this obstinate wrestling-match between the old and the young,\nGauvain almost always had the advantage, and he owed this rather to\nchance than to anything in himself. Every sort of good-fortune, even\nthough it may be terrible, falls to the lot of youth. Victory has\nsomething feminine in its nature.\n\nLantenac was exasperated with Gauvain; first, because his nephew had\ndefeated him, and second, because he was his nephew. What possessed him\nto be Jacobin?--a Gauvain! Unruly youngster that he was. His heir,--for\nthe Marquis had no children,--a great-nephew, almost a grandchild!\n\"Ah!\" cried this quasi grandfather, \"if he falls into my hands, I will\nkill him like a dog.\"\n\nThe Republic, moreover, had good reason to feel uneasy about this\nMarquis de Lantenac. He had no sooner landed than its terror began.\nThe mere utterance of his name was like a powder-train spread through\nthe Vendean insurrection, of which he straightway became the centre.\nIn a revolt of this kind, where each one is jealous of his neighbor,\nwhere each has his bush or his ravine, if a superior leader appears,\nthe separate chiefs who have been on a level will rally round him and\nsubmit themselves to his authority. Nearly all the forest captains\nhad joined Lantenac, and whether near or remote, they all obeyed him.\nOnly Gavard, who had been the first to join him, had departed. And why\nwas this? Because he had enjoyed the confidence of the Republic and\nbeen in a position of authority. Gavard had held all the secrets and\nhad adopted the old-fashioned system of civil war, which Lantenac had\ncome to change and replace. A successor can hardly agree with a man of\nthat stamp. The shoe of La Rouarie was not a fit for Lantenac, and so\nGavard had gone to join Bonchamp.\n\nLantenac belonged to the military school of Frederic II.; he understood\nthe art of warfare, which consists of combining the greater with the\nlesser; he favored neither the great Catholic and Royal army, that\n\"mass of confusion\" destined to be crushed, nor the guerilla troops\nscattered through the thickets and hedges, useful to harass, but\npowerless to crush. There is either no end to guerilla warfare, or else\nit comes to an unfortunate one: it begins by attacking the Republic and\nends by robbing a diligence. Lantenac did not propose to carry on the\nBreton war altogether in the open country like La Rochejaquelein, nor\nyet in the forest like Chouan. He neither approved of the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e nor\nof the Chouannerie; he believed in real warfare; he was willing to use\nthe peasant, but he wished to support him by the soldier. He required\nbands for strategy and regiments for tactics. The village armies so\neasily disbanded he considered excellent for an attack, an ambush,\nor a surprise, but he felt that they lacked solidity; they were like\nwater in his hands; he sought a solid foundation for this unstable\nand diffusive warfare; to the savage army of the forest he proposed\nto add regular troops as a sort of pivot about which to manoeuvre the\npeasants. Had this scheme, deep-laid and terrible as it was, proved\nsuccessful, the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e would never have been conquered.\n\nBut where could regular troops be found? Where look for soldiers? Where\nseek for regiments, and find a ready-made army? In England. Hence\nLantenac's determination that the English should effect a landing. Thus\ndo parties compromise with their consciences. He quite lost sight of\nthe red coat, eclipsed as it was by the white cockade. Lantenac had but\none idea,--first to seize upon some point on the coast, and then to\ndeliver it into the hands of Pitt. It was with this object that, seeing\nDol unprotected, he had thrown himself upon it, knowing that once in\npossession of Dol, he could readily gain Mont-Dol, and by means of the\nlatter gain a footing on the coast.\n\nThe spot was well chosen. From Mont-Dol the cannon would sweep Fresnois\non one side; and Saint-Brelade, on the other, would keep the fleet of\nCancale at a distance, and leave the whole beach, from Raz-sur-Couesnon\nto Saint-M\u00c3\u00aaloir-des-Ondes, open to an attack.\n\nIn order to insure success, Lantenac had brought with him six thousand\nof the most active men in the regiment at his disposal, together with\nall his artillery,--ten sixteen-pound culverins, one demi-culverin,\nand one four-pounder. He proposed to establish a strong battery on\nMont-Dol, on the principle that a thousand shots fired from ten cannon\ndo more execution than fifteen hundred fired from five cannon.\n\nWith six thousand men, he felt sure of success. In the direction of\nAvranches they had nothing to fear but Gauvain with his fifteen hundred\nmen. Towards Dina there was L\u00c3\u00a9chelle, to be sure, with twenty-five\nthousand; but he was twenty leagues away. In regard to the latter,\nLantenac felt quite safe, the distance offsetting the numbers; and\nas for Gauvain though he was quite near, his force was very small.\nWE may here remark that L\u00c3\u00a9chelle was a fool, who afterwards allowed\nhis twenty-five thousand men to be slaughtered on the moors of\nCroix-Bataille,--a mistake for which he strove to atone by suicide.\n\nSo Lantenac felt quite safe. His entrance into Dol had been sudden and\nstern. The Marquis de Lantenac enjoyed a hard reputation; and knowing\nhim to be merciless, the terrified inhabitants shut themselves up\nin their houses without attempting resistance, and the six thousand\nVendeans installed themselves in the city after the disorderly fashion\nof a band of rustics. It was almost like a market-ground; in default of\nquartermasters, they chose their own quarters, camping at haphazard,\ncooking, in the open air, dispersing hither and yonder through the\nchurches, dropping their muskets to take up their rosaries. Lantenac,\naccompanied by a few artillery officers, proceeded without delay to\nreconnoitre Mont-Dol, leaving Gouge-le-Bruant, whom he had appointed\nfield-sergeant, in command. This Gouge-le-Bruant has left but an\nindistinct trace in history. He had two nicknames,-_Brise-Bleu_ in\ntoken of his massacre of the patriots, and _Im\u00c3\u00a2nus_, because there was\nsomething indescribably horrible about him. _Im\u00c3\u00a2nus_ is derived from\n_immanis_, and old Low-Norman word, which expresses a superhuman degree\nof ugliness, almost godlike in its terror,--a demon, a satyr, an ogre.\nAn old manuscript says, \"With my own eyes I beheld Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\" To-day the\nold people in Brittany no longer know who Gouge-le-Bruant was, nor what\nBrise-Bleu means; but they have a vague idea of the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, whose name\nis interwoven with all the local superstitions. He still is spoken of\nin Tr\u00c3\u00a9morel and Plumaugat,--the two villages where Gouge-le-Bruant has\nleft the impress of his ill-omened footstep. In the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, where all\nthe inhabitants were savages, Gouge-le-Bruant was the barbarian. He was\na sort of Cacique tattooed all over with crucifixes and fleurs-de-lis.\nUpon his face was the hideous, almost supernatural glow of a soul\nunlike that of any other human being. He was as brave in battle as\nSatan himself, and atrociously cruel when the battle was over. His\nheart, full of mysterious determinations, now urged him to acts of\ndevotion, now to deeds of wildest fury. Did he use his reason? Yes,\nafter a serpentine fashion. Heroism was his starting-point, murder his\ngoal. It was impossible to conceive how his resolutions, often grand in\ntheir very monstrosity, could have entered his mind. He was capable of\nany horror, when least expected. His ferocity was on a scale of epic\ngrandeur.\n\nHence his peculiar surname, Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac relied upon his cruelty; but while none could\ndispute the fact that he excelled in cruelty, in matters of strategy\nand tactics he was less efficient, and it may perhaps have been a\nmistake on the part of the Marquis when he made him his field-sergeant.\nBut however that may be, he left him behind in charge, with the\ninjunction to look after matters in general.\n\nGouge-le-Bruant was more of a fighter than a soldier, and guarding\na town was not so much in his line as massacring a clan would have\nbeen; still, he posted sentries. When at nightfall the Marquis, having\ndecided upon the position of his battery, was returning to Dol, he\nsuddenly caught the sound of cannon. Looking in the direction of\nthe sound, he saw a red smoke rising from the street. This meant a\nsurprise, an invasion, an attack; fighting was going on in the town.\n\nAlthough not easily taken by surprise, he was now utterly amazed, for\nhe had anticipated nothing of the sort. What could it mean? Evidently\nnot Gauvain, for a man would hardly attack an enemy outnumbering him\nfour to one. Could it be L\u00c3\u00a9chelle? But was it possible for him to have\nmade such a forced march? L\u00c3\u00a9chelle was improbable, Gauvain impossible.\n\nLantenac urged on his horse. On the way he met some of the inhabitants\nin the act of flight; but when he questioned them, they seemed beside\nthemselves with terror, crying, \"The Blues! the Blues!\" And on his\narrival he found the situation a bad one.\n\nThis is what had happened.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nSMALL ARMIES AND GREAT BATTLES.\n\n\n[Illustration 077]\n\n\nOn their arrival at Dol, the peasants, as we have seen, had dispersed\nthrough town, each man guided by his own fancy, as it often happens\nwhen \"on ob\u00c3\u00a9it d'amiti\u00c3\u00a9,\" as the Vendeans expressed it,--a form of\nobedience that may produce heroes, but not well-disciplined soldiers.\nThey had stored their artillery, together with the baggage, under\nthe arches of the old market, and feeling weary, when they had eaten\nand drunk and said their beads, they stretched themselves out in\nthe middle of the principal street, that was encumbered rather than\nguarded. As night came on most of them fell asleep, pillowing their\nheads on their knapsacks, some having their wives beside them; for it\noften happened that the peasant women followed the men. In the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e,\nwomen about to become mothers frequently acted as spies. It was a mild\nJuly night The constellations shone forth against the deep-blue sky.\nThe entire bivouac, which might have been mistaken for the halt of a\ncaravan rather than for a military encampment, gave itself up to quiet\nslumber. Suddenly by the glimmering twilight those who were still awake\nperceived three cannon levelled at the entrance of the principal street.\n\nIt was Gauvain. He had surprised the guard, had entered the town, and\nwith his division held the entrance of the street.\n\nA peasant started up, crying, \"Who goes there?\" and fired off his\nmusket. A cannon-shot, followed by a terrific volley of musketry, was\nthe reply. The whole sleeping crowd sprang up with a start. It was a\nrude shock to be roused by a volley of grape-shot from a peaceful sleep\nbeneath the stars.\n\nThe first moment was terrific. There is nothing more tragic than the\nconfusion of a panic-stricken crowd. They snatched their weapons.\nMany fell as they ran yelling to and fro. Confused by the unexpected\nassault, the lads lost their heads and fired madly at one another.\nThe townspeople, bewildered by all this confusion, rushed in and out\nof their houses, shouting to each other as they wandered helplessly\nabout,--a dismal struggle in which women and children played a part.\nThe balls whistling through the air left streaks of light in the\ndarkness behind them. Amid the smoke and tumult a constant firing\nissued from every dark corner. The entanglement of the baggage-wagons\nand cannon-carriages was added to the general confusion. The horses,\nrearing, trampled upon the wounded, whose groans could be heard on\nevery side. Some were horror-stricken, others stupefied. Officers were\nlooking for their men, and soldiers for their officers. In the midst\nof all this some there were who displayed a stolid indifference. One\nwoman, seated on the fragment of a wall, was nursing her new-born\nbabe, while her husband, with bleeding wounds and a broken leg, leaned\nagainst it as he calmly loaded his musket and fired at random in the\ndarkness, killing or not, as it happened. Men lying flat on the ground\nfired between the spokes of the wagon-wheels. At times there rose a\nhideous din of clamors, and again the thundering voice of the cannon\nwould overwhelm all. It was frightful,--like the felling of trees when\none falls upon the other.\n\n[Illustration 078]\n\nGauvain from his ambush aimed with precision, and lost but few men.\nBut at last the peasants, intrepid in spite of the disaster, ended by\ntaking the defensive. They fell back on the market, which was like\na great dark fortress, with its forest of stone pillars. There they\nmade a stand; anything that resembled a forest inspired them with\ncourage. The Im\u00c3\u00a2nus did his best to atone for the absence of Lantenac.\nThey had cannon; but, to the great surprise of Gauvain, they made no\nuse of them. This was due to the fact that the artillery officers had\ngone with the Marquis to reconnoitre Mont-Dol, and the peasants did\nnot know how to manage the culverins and demi-culverins; but they\nriddled with balls the Blues who cannonaded them. The peasants answered\nthe grape-shot by a volley of musketry. They now had the advantage\nof a shelter, having heaped up the drays, the carts, the baggage,\nand all the small casks that were lying about in the old market,\nthus improvising a high barricade, with openings through which they\ncould pass their muskets, and from which they opened a deadly fire.\nSo rapidly had they worked, that in a quarter of an hour the market\npresented an impregnable front.\n\nMatters were beginning to look serious for Gauvain. The sudden\ntransformation of a market into a fortress, and the peasants assembled\nin a solid mass within, was a condition of affairs which he had not\nanticipated. He had taken them by surprise, it is true; but he had not\nsucceeded in routing them. He had dismounted, and holding his sword\nby the hilt, he stood with folded arms, gazing steadfastly into the\ngloom, his own figure distinctly revealed by the flame of the torch\nthat lighted the battery,--a target for the men of the barricade; of\nwhich fact he took no heed, as he stood there lost in thought, while a\nshower of balls from the barricade fell around him.\n\nHe set his cannon against their rifles; and victory is ever on the side\nof the cannon-ball. He who has artillery is sure to win the day, and\nhis well-manned battery gave him the advantage.\n\nSuddenly a flash of lightning burst forth from the dark market; there\ncame a report like a peal of thunder, and a bullet went crashing\nthrough a house over Gauvain's head.\n\nThe barricade was paying him back in his own coin.\n\nWhat was going on? This was a new development. The artillery was no\nlonger confined to one side.\n\nA second ball followed the first, embedding itself in the wall close to\nGauvain; and a third ball knocked off his hat.\n\nThese balls were of a calibre so heavy that they must have been fired\nfrom a sixteen-pounder.\n\n\"They are aiming at you, commander,\" cried the gunners, as they put out\nthe torch; and Gauvain, still absorbed in his reverie, stooped to pick\nup his hat.\n\nSome one was indeed aiming at Gauvain, and it was Lantenac.\n\nThe Marquis had just reached the barricade from the opposite side.\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus hastened to meet him.\n\n\"Monseigneur, we have been taken by surprise.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Is the road to Dinan open?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"We must begin to retreat.\"\n\n\"We have done so. Many have already fled.\"\n\n\"I am not speaking of flight, but of retreat. Why did you not use the\nartillery?\"\n\n\"The men were beside themselves, and then the officers were absent.\"\n\n\"I was to be here.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I sent everything I could on to Foug\u00c3\u00a8res,--the women, the\nbaggage, and all useless incumbrances; but what is to be done with the\nthree little prisoners?\"\n\n\"Do you mean the children?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They are our hostages. Send them on to the Tourgue.\"\n\nSo saying, the Marquis started for the barricade, and directly after\nhis arrival things took on another aspect. The barricade was not\nwell constructed for artillery; there was room for but two cannon;\nthe Marquis placed in position the two sixteen-pounders for which\nembrasures were made. As he was leaning on one of the cannon, watching\nthe enemy's battery through the embrasure, he caught sight of Gauvain.\n\n\"It is he!\" he cried.\n\nThen, taking the swab and the ramrod, he loaded the piece, adjusted the\nsight, and took aim.\n\nThree times he aimed at Gauvain and missed him, but the third shot\nknocked off his hat.\n\n\"Bungler!\" murmured Lantenac. \"A little lower, and I should have had\nhis head.\"\n\nSuddenly the torch went out, and he had only darkness before him.\n\n\"Well, let it go,\" he said.\n\nAnd turning to the peasant gunners, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Let them have the grape-shot!\"\n\nGauvain for his part was also in deadly earnest. The situation had\nbecome a serious one since the development of this new phase of the\nconflict, and the barricade was now cannonading him. Who could tell\nhow soon it might pass from the defensive to the offensive? The enemy\nnumbered at least five thousand, even allowing for the dead and the\nfugitives, while he had no more than twelve hundred service-able men\nat his command. What would happen to the Republicans if the enemy\nshould become aware of their limited number? Their r\u00c3\u00b4les would soon\nbe reversed; from playing the part of assailants, he would become the\nobject of assault. If the barricade were to make a sortie, all would be\nlost.\n\nWhat was to be done? It was out of the question to think of attacking\nthe barricade in front; an attempt to capture it by main strength\nwould be folly; twelve hundred men could not dislodge five thousand.\nImperative as it was to make an end of it, knowing as he did that delay\nwas fatal, still he realized that to force the enemy's hand would be\nimpossible. What was he to do?\n\nGauvain belonged to this neighborhood; he was familiar with the\ntown, and knew that behind the old market, where the Vendeans were\nintrenched, was a labyrinth of narrow and crooked streets.\n\nHe turned to his lieutenant, the brave Captain Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, who afterwards\nbecame famous for clearing the forest of Concise, where Jean Chouan was\nborn, and who prevented the capture of Bourgneuf by cutting the rebels\noff from the highway that led to the pond of La Chaine.\n\n\"Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ,\" said Gauvain, \"I intrust you with the command. Fire as\nrapidly as possible. Riddle the barricade with cannon-balls, and keep\nthem busy over yonder.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ.\n\n\"Mass the whole column with their guns loaded, and hold them in\nreadiness for an attack.\"\n\nHe whispered a few words in Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ's ear.\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said the latter.\n\nGauvain continued,--\n\n\"Are all our drummers ready?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"We have nine. Keep two and give me seven.\"\n\nThe seven drummers silently ranged themselves in front of Gauvain.\n\n\"Step forward, battalion of the Bonnet-Rouge!\" exclaimed Gauvain.\n\nTwelve soldiers, one of whom was a sergeant, stepped from the ranks.\n\n\"I called for the whole battalion,\" said Gauvain.\n\n\"Here it is,\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"Are there but twelve?\"\n\n\"Only twelve of us left.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Gauvain.\n\nThis sergeant was that very Radoub, the rough and kindly soldier who in\nthe name of the battalion had adopted the three children found in the\nforest of La Saudraie.\n\nIt will be remarked that only half that battalion was massacred at\nHerbe-en-Pail, and Radoub, by good luck, was not among them.\n\nA forage-wagon was standing near, and Gauvain pointed it out to the\nsergeant.\n\n\"Let your men weave ropes of straw and bind them around their muskets\nto deaden the noise when they clash against each other.\"\n\nA minute went by; the order was silently executed in the darkness.\n\n\"It is done,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Take off your shoes, soldiers,\" continued Gauvain.\n\n\"We have none,\" replied the sergeant.\n\nIncluding the drummers, they numbered nineteen men; Gauvain was the\ntwentieth.\n\n\"Follow me, in single file!\" cried Gauvain. \"Let the drummers go before\nthe battalion. You will command the battalion, sergeant!\"\n\nHe placed himself at the head of this column, and while the cannonading\nstill continued on both sides, these twenty men glided along like\nshadows and plunged into the deserted lanes.\n\nThus they proceeded for some time, skirting along the fronts of the\nhouses. It seemed as though the whole town were dead; the citizens had\ntaken refuge in their cellars. Every door was barred and every shutter\nclosed. Not a light was to be seen anywhere.\n\nBut through this silence they still heard the awful din on the\nprincipal street: the cannonading went on; the Republican battery and\nthe Royal barricade spit out their grape-shot with unabated fury.\n\n[Illustration 079]\n\nAfter marching twenty minutes, winding in and out, Gauvain, who had led\nthe way unerringly through this darkness, reached the end of a lane\nthat led into the principal street; they were now, however, on the\nother side of the market.\n\nThe position was changed. On that side there was no intrenchment,--a\ncommon mistake of barricade builders; the market was open, and one\ncould walk in under the pillars, where several baggage-wagons stood\nready to leave. Gauvain and his nineteen men were in the presence of\nthe five thousand Vendeans as before, only instead of facing them they\nfound themselves in their rear.\n\nGauvain whispered to the sergeant; the straw was unwound from the\nmuskets, and the twelve grenadiers ranged themselves in a line behind\nthe corner of the lane, while the seven drummers, with uplifted\ndrumstick, waited for the signal.\n\nThe artillery firing was intermittent, when suddenly, during the\ninterval between two discharges, Gauvain raised his sword, and in a\nvoice that rang out like a clarion upon the silence, exclaimed,--\n\n\"Two hundred men to the right, two hundred to the left, the rest in the\ncentre.\"\n\nThe drums beat and the twelve musket-shots were fired.\n\nThen Gauvain uttered the formidable battle-cry of the Blues,--\n\n\"Charge! Bayonets!\"\n\nThe effect was wonderful.\n\nAll this crowd of peasants finding themselves assailed in the rear,\nimagined that another army had come up from behind. At the same time,\non hearing the beating of the drums, the column which held the upper\npart of the street and was commanded by Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ began to move,\nsounding the charge in its turn, and starting on the run, attacked\nthe barricade; the peasants saw themselves between two fires. A panic\nmagnifies, and at such moments a pistol-shot sounds like the report of\na cannon; imagination distorts every sound, and the barking of a dog\nseems like the roar of a lion. Let us add, moreover, that the peasant\ntakes fright as easily as a thatch catches fire, and as quickly as a\nburning thatch becomes a conflagration, a panic among peasants grows\ninto a rout; and on this occasion the flight was beyond description.\n\nIn a few moments the market was deserted; the terrified lads scattered\nin all directions, and the officers were helpless. The Im\u00c3\u00a2nus killed\ntwo or three of the fugitives, but it was of no avail. Nothing could be\nheard save the cry, \"Sauve qui peut,\" and with the rapidity of a cloud\ndriven onward by a hurricane, the entire army scattered through the\nstreets as through the meshes of a sieve and vanished into the country.\n\nSome fled towards Ch\u00c3\u00a2teauneuf, some towards Plerguer, and others in the\ndirection of Antrain.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac, who was the last man to leave the scene,\nspiked the guns with his own hands, and then quietly and calmly took\nhis departure, saying as he went,--\n\n\"It is evident that the peasants cannot be depended upon to stand their\nground. We need the English.\"\n\n\n[Illustration 080]\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nA SECOND TIME.\n\n\n[Illustration 081]\n\n\nThey had won the victory, and, turning to the men of the battalion of\nthe Bonnet-Rouge, Gauvain exclaimed,--\n\n\"Though you are but twelve, you are equal to a thousand.\"\n\nOne word from the chief in times like these was as good as the cross of\nhonor.\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9champ, who had been sent by Gauvain outside the city in pursuit of\nthe fugitives, captured many of them.\n\nTorches were lighted, and the town was searched.\n\nAll those who had not been able to escape, surrendered themselves. The\nprincipal street, illuminated by _pots-\u00c3\u00a0-feu_, was strewn with the\ndead and the wounded. The fierce struggle that always terminates a\nbattle was still continued by a few groups of desperate fighters, who,\nhowever, on being surrounded, threw down their arms and surrendered.\n\nGauvain had observed amid the wild tumult of the flight a fearless man,\nvigorous and agile as a faun, who stood his own ground while covering\nthe flight of the others. This peasant, after handling his musket like\nan expert, alternately firing: and Rising the butt as a club, until\nhe had broken it, now stood grasping a pistol in one hand and a sabre\nin the other, and no man dared approach him. Suddenly Gauvain saw him\nreel, and lean against one of the pillars of the principal street. He\nwas evidently wounded, but he still held his sabre and his pistols.\nGauvain put his sword under his arm and came up to him. As he called\nupon him to surrender, the man gazed steadily at him, while the blood\noozing from his wound formed a pool at his feet.\n\n\"You are my prisoner,\" said Gauvain. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Danse-\u00c3\u00a0-l'Ombre,\" was the reply.\n\n\"You are a brave fellow,\" said Gauvain, extending his hand.\n\n\"Long live the King!\" cried the man.\n\nThen gathering all his strength, and raising both hands simultaneously,\nhe fired his pistol at Gauvain's heart, at the same time aiming a blow\nat his head with the sabre.\n\nThis movement, tiger-like in its rapidity, was yet forestalled by the\naction of another. A horseman had appeared on the scene; he had been\nthere for some moments without attracting attention, and when he saw\nthe Vendean lift his sabre and pistol, he threw himself between the\nlatter and Gauvain, intercepting the sabre-thrust by his own person,\nwhile his horse was struck by the pistol-shot, and both horse and rider\nfell to the ground. Thus Gauvain's life was saved. All this took place\nas quickly as one would utter a cry.\n\nThe Vendean also sank to the pavement.\n\nThe blow from the sabre struck the man full in the face; he lay on the\nground in a swoon. The horse was killed.\n\n[Illustration 082]\n\nGauvain drew near, asking, as he approached, if any could tell who he\nwas.\n\nOn looking at him more closely he saw that the blood was gushing over\nthe face of the wounded man, covering it as with a red mask, and\nrendering it impossible to distinguish his features. One could see that\nhis hair was gray.\n\n\"He has saved my life,\" said Gauvain. \"Does any one here know him?\"\n\n\"Commander,\" said a soldier, \"he has but just arrived in town. I saw\nhim coming from the direction of Pontorson.\"\n\nThe surgeon-in-chief of the division hurried up with his\ninstrument-case.\n\nThe wounded man was still unconscious, but after examining him the\nsurgeon said,--\n\n\"Oh, this is nothing but a simple cut. It can be sewed, and in eight\ndays he will be on his feet again. That was a fine sabre-cut.\"\n\nThe wounded man wore a cloak and a tricolored belt, with pistols and\na sabre. They placed him on a stretcher, and after undressing him, a\nbucket of water was brought, and the surgeon washed the wound. As the\nface began to appear, Gauvain studied it attentively.\n\n\"Has he any papers about him?\" he asked.\n\nThe surgeon felt in his side pocket and drew out a pocket-book, which\nhe handed to Gauvain.\n\nMeanwhile the wounded man, revived by the cold water, was regaining\nhis consciousness. His eyelids quivered slightly.\n\nGauvain was looking over the pocket-book, in which he discovered a\nsheet of paper folded four times; he opened it and read,--\n\n\"Committee of Public Safety. Citizen Cimourdain--\"\n\n\"Cimourdain!\" he cried; whereupon the wounded man opened his eyes.\n\nGauvain was beside himself.\n\n\"It is you, Cimourdain! For the second time you have saved my life.\"\n\nCimourdain looked at Gauvain, while a sudden burst of joy, impossible\nto describe, lit up his bleeding face.\n\nGauvain fell on his knees before him, exclaiming:\n\n\"My master!\"\n\n\"Thy father!\" said Cimourdain.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nA DROP OF COLD WATER.\n\n\nIt was many a year since last they met, but their hearts had never been\nseparated, and they knew each other again as if they had parted but\nyesterday.\n\nA hospital had been improvised in the town hall of Dol, and Cimourdain\nwas placed on a bed in a small room adjoining the large hall devoted to\nthe other wounded men. The surgeon who had sewed up his wound put a\nstop to all exciting conversation between the two men, considering it\nwiser to leave Cimourdain to sleep. Besides, Gauvain was called away by\nthe thousand duties and cares incident to victory. Cimourdain was left\nalone, but he could not sleep, excited as he was by the double fever of\nhis wound and of his joy.\n\nHe knew he was not sleeping, and yet he hardly felt sure that he was\nawake. Could it be possible that his dream had come to pass? Cimourdain\nwas one of those men who have no faith in good luck, and yet it had\nfallen to his lot. He had found Gauvain. He had left him a child, he\nfound him a man,--a grand, brave, awe-inspiring conqueror, and that in\nthe cause of the people. In the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, Gauvain was the pillar of the\nRevolution, and it was really Cimourdain himself who had bestowed this\nsupport upon the Republic. This conqueror was his pupil. Cimourdain\nbeheld his own thought illumining the youthful countenance of this man,\nfor whom a niche in the Republican Pantheon was perhaps reserved; his\ndisciple, the child of his mind, was a hero from this time forth, and\nwould soon become famous; it seemed to Cimourdain like seeing his own\nsoul transformed into a genius. As he watched Gauvain in the battle\nhe had felt like Chiron watching Achilles. There is a certain analogy\nbetween the priest and the Centaur, since a priest is but half a man.\n\nThe incidents of this day's adventure, added to the sleeplessness\ncaused by his wound, filled Cimourdain with a strange sort of\nintoxication. He seemed to see a youthful destiny rising before him in\nall its splendor, and the knowledge of his own absolute control of\nthis destiny contributed to increase his deep joy. It needed but one\nmore triumph like that which he had just witnessed, and at a word from\nCimourdain, the Republic would place Gauvain at the head of an army.\nNothing dazzles one so much as an unexpected success. This was the\nepoch of military dreams. Every man had a longing to create a general;\nWestermann was the hero of Danton's dream, Rossignol of Marat's, Ronsin\nof H\u00c3\u00a9bert's; and Robespierre would have liked to ruin them all. So\nwhy not Gauvain? Cimourdain asked himself; and thereupon he proceeded\nto lose himself in dreams. There were no limits to his imaginings;\nas he passed from one hypothesis to another, all obstacles vanished\nbefore him. For this is a ladder on which, having once set foot, one\nnever pauses; the ascent is a long one, starting from man and ending\nat the stars. A great general is only the commander of an army; a\ngreat captain is also a leader of thought; Cimourdain pictured Gauvain\nas a great captain. It seemed to him--for fancies travel fast--that\nhe saw him on the sea, pursuing the English; on the Rhine, driving\nbefore him the kings of the North; in the Pyrenees, repulsing Spain;\non the Alps, setting the signal for insurrection before the eyes of\nRome. Cimourdain was a man who possessed two distinct natures,--the\none tender, the other gloomy,--both of which were satisfied; for since\nthe inexorable was his ideal, it gratified him to see Gauvain at once\nglorious and terrible. Cimourdain thought of all he had to pull down\nbefore he could build up. \"And certainly,\" he said to himself, \"this\nis no time to indulge in tender emotions. Gauvain will be up _\u00c3\u00a0 la\nhauteur_,\"[3]--an expression of the day. Cimourdain pictured Gauvain\nto himself with a sword in his hand, girded in light, a flaming meteor\non his brow, spreading the grand ideal wings of justice, right, and\nprogress, and, like an angel of extermination, crushing the darkness\nbeneath his heel.\n\nJust at the crisis of this reverie, which one might almost have called\nan ecstasy, through the half-open door he heard men talking in the\ngreat ambulance-hall adjoining his room, and he recognized Gauvain's\nvoice, which, in spite of years of absence, had always rung in his\nears; for the voice of the man often retains something of its childish\ntones. He listened. There was a sound of footsteps, and he heard the\nsoldiers saying,--\n\n\"Here is the man who fired at you, commander. He had crawled into a\ncellar when no one was watching; but we found him, and here he is.\"\n\nThen Cimourdain heard the following conversation between Gauvain and\nthe man:--\n\n\"Are you wounded?\"\n\n\"I am well enough to be shot.\"\n\n\"Put this man to bed, dress his wounds, take good care of him until he\nrecovers.\"\n\n\"I want to die.\"\n\n\"But you are going to live. You tried to kill me in the name of the\nKing; I pardon you in the name of the Republic.\"\n\nA shadow crossed Cimourdain's brow. He seemed to wake as with a start,\nand whispered to himself in a tone of gloomy dejection,--\n\n\"Yes, he has a merciful nature, there can be no doubt.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nA HEALED BREAST, BUT A BLEEDING HEART.\n\n\nA Gash is quickly healed; but there was elsewhere one more seriously\nwounded than Cimourdain. This was the woman who had been shot, and whom\nthe beggar Tellmarch had rescued from the great pool of blood at the\nfarm Herbe-en-Pail.\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard was in a more critical condition than Tellmarch\nhad supposed. There was a wound in the shoulder-blade corresponding\nto that above her breast; one ball had broken her collar-bone, while\nanother had entered her shoulder; but as the lung was uninjured, she\nmight recover. Tellmarch was what in peasant language is called a\n\"philosopher,\" that is to say, a combination of doctor, surgeon, and\nwizard. Upon the bed of seaweed in his underground den he nursed the\nwounded woman, using those mysterious remedies called \"simples;\" end\nthanks to his care, she lived.\n\nThe collar-bone knitted together, the wounds in the breast and the\nshoulder closed, and after a few weeks the wounded woman became\nconvalescent.\n\nOne morning she was able to walk out of the _carnichot_, leaning on\nTellmarch; she seated herself under the trees, in the sun. Tellmarch\nknew very little about her; for a wound in the breast necessitates\nsilence, and during the death-like agony which preceded her recovery\nshe had hardly spoken a word. Whenever she seemed about to open\nher lips, Tellmarch would prevent her; but he could not control\nher thoughts, and he observed by the expression in her eyes the\nheart-rending nature of her ever-recurring fancies. This morning she\nfelt strong, and could almost walk alone. The doctor who has cured his\npatient enjoys a sense of fatherhood; and as he watched her, Tellmarch\nfelt happy. The good old man began to smile as he addressed her.\n\n\"Well, it seems we are up; our wounds are healed.\"\n\n\"All but those of the heart.\"\n\nAnd presently she added,--\n\n\"Then you don't know where they are?\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\" asked Tellmarch.\n\n\"My children.\"\n\nThe word \"then\" revealed a whole world of meaning; it seemed to say:\n\"Since you do not speak of them to me, since you have been with me for\nso many days without opening your lips to me on the subject, since you\nsilence me every time I try to speak, since you seem to fear that I\nam going to talk about them,--it must mean that you have nothing to\ntell me.\" During the course of her fever she had often noticed that\nwhenever, in her delirious ramblings, she had called for her children\n(the perceptions of delirium are sometimes acute), the old man would\nmake no reply.\n\nThe truth was that Tellmarch did not know what to tell her. It is not\neasy to speak to a mother of her lost children; and besides, what did\nhe know? Nothing at all, in fact,--that a mother had been shot, that he\nhad found this mother on the ground, that when he had lifted her up she\nwas nearly dead, that this dying woman had three children, and lastly,\nthat the Marquis de Lantenac, after ordering the mother to be shot, had\ncarried away the children; and here his information ceased. What had\nbecome of the children? Were they still living? Having made inquiries,\nhe had learned that there were two boys, and a little girl barely\nweaned; and this was the extent of his knowledge. He asked himself more\nquestions than he could answer in regard to this unhappy family; but\nthe neighbors whom he had asked only shook their heads. M. de Lantenac\nwas a man of whom no one cared to talk.\n\nThey were equally reluctant either to speak about Lantenac or to talk\nto Tellmarch. Peasants have their own peculiar superstitions. They\ndisliked Tellmarch. Tellmarch le Caimand was a perplexing man. Why was\nhe always looking up at the sky? What was he doing, what could he be\nthinking about, when he stood motionless for hours at a time? Surely he\nmust be a very odd sort of man. While the district was in a state of\ncombustion and conflagration, when warfare, devastation, and carnage\nwere the sole occupations of life, when every man was doing his best to\nburn houses, murder families, massacre outposts, and plunder villages,\nthinking of nothing but setting ambushes and traps and killing one\nanother, here was this hermit absorbed in nature, enjoying absolute\npeace of mind, gathering plants and herbs, interested only in flowers,\nbirds, and stars,--of course he was a dangerous character! He must be\ninsane. He never hid behind a bush to fire at his fellow-men. \"The man\nis mad!\" said the passers-by. Hence he inspired a certain awe, and men\navoided him, thus increasing the isolation of his life.\n\n[Illustration 087]\n\nThey asked him no questions, and seldom vouchsafed replies; therefore\nhe had been unable to get the information he wanted. The conflict had\nbeen transferred to other districts, and the fighting was more remote.\nThe Marquis de Lantenac had vanished from the horizon; and war must set\nits foot on a man of Tellmarch's character before he becomes aware of\nits existence.\n\nAfter hearing these words, \"My children!\" Tellmarch ceased to smile,\nand the mother sank into deep thought. What was passing in her soul?\nShe seemed to have plunged into the depths. Suddenly she looked up at\nTellmarch, and repeated her demand almost angrily,--\n\n\"My children!\"\n\nTellmarch bent his head like a culprit.\n\nHe was thinking of the Marquis de Lantenac, who, so far from returning\nhis thought, had probably forgotten his very existence. He realized the\nfact as he said to himself, \"When a nobleman is in danger he reckons\nyou among his acquaintance; but let the danger pass, and he forgets\nthat he ever saw you.\"\n\nAnd he asked himself, \"Why, then, did I save him?\" To which question he\nmade reply, \"Because he was a man.\"\n\nFor some moments he dwelt upon this thought; then he resumed the thread\nof his meditations,--\n\n\"Am I sure of this?\"\n\nAnd presently he repeated those bitter words: \"Had I but known!\"\n\nThis whole experience gave him a sense of oppression, for his own\naction in the affair was enigmatical to him. His thoughts were sad,\nsince a sense of guilt had crept into them. A kindly act may prove\nin the end to have been an evil one. He who saves the wolf kills the\nsheep; he who sets the vulture's wing is responsible for his talons.\nThe unreasoning anger of this mother was therefore justified.\n\nStill he felt a certain consolation in the knowledge that he had saved\nthe mother, which partly balanced his regret for having saved the\nMarquis.\n\n\"But the children?\"\n\nThe mother was also thinking; and these two currents of thoughts moved\nside by side, perhaps to mingle unawares in the shadowy land of reverie.\n\nMeanwhile her eyes, gloomy as the night, rested again on Tellmarch.\n\n\"We cannot go on like this,\" she said.\n\n\"Hush!\" rejoined Tellmarch, putting his finger on his lips.\n\nShe continued,--\n\n\"I am angry with you for saving me; you did wrong. I would rather have\ndied, for then I should surely see them and know where they are. They\nwould not see me, but I should be near them. The dead must have power\nto protect.\"\n\nHe took her by the arm, and felt her pulse.\n\n\"You must calm yourself, or you will have a relapse.\"\n\nShe asked him almost harshly,--\n\n\"When can I go away?\"\n\n\"Go away?\"\n\n\"Yes. When shall I be fit for tramping?\"\n\n\"Never, if you are unreasonable; to-morrow, if you are good.\"\n\n\"What do you call being good?\"\n\n\"Trusting in God.\"\n\n\"God? What has He done with my children?\"\n\nShe seemed to be wandering. Her voice had grown very gentle.\n\n\"You must see,\" she went on to say, \"that I cannot stay like this. You\nnever had any children; but I am a mother: that makes a difference. One\ncannot judge of a thing unless he knows what it is like. Did you ever\nhave any children?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Tellmarch.\n\n\"But I have. Can I live without my children? I should like to be told\nwhy my children are not here. Something is happening, but what it is I\ncannot understand.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Tellmarch, \"you are feverish again. You mustn't talk any\nmore.\"\n\nShe looked at him and was silent.\n\nAnd from that day she kept silence again.\n\nThis implicit obedience was more than Tellmarch desired. She spent hour\nafter hour crouching at the foot of the old tree, like one stupefied.\nShe pondered in silence,--that refuge of simple souls who have sounded\nthe gloomy depths of woe. She seemed to give up trying to understand.\nAfter a certain point despair becomes unintelligible to the despairing.\n\nAs Tellmarch watched her, his sympathy increased. The sight of her\nsuffering excited in this old man thoughts such as a woman might have\nknown. \"She may close her lips,\" he said to himself, \"but her eyes will\nspeak, and I see what ails her. She has but one idea; she cannot be\nresigned to the thought that she is no longer a mother. Her mind dwells\nconstantly on the image of her youngest, whom she was nursing not long\nago. How charming it must be to feel a tiny rosy mouth drawing ones\nsoul from out one's body, feeding its own little life on the life of\nits mother!\"\n\nHe too was silent, realizing the impotence of speech in the presence of\nsuch sorrow.\n\nThere is something really terrible in the silence of an unchanging\nthought, and how can one expect that a mother will listen to reason?\nMaternity sees but one side. It is useless to argue with it. One\nsublime characteristic of a mother is her resemblance to a wild animal.\nThe maternal instinct is divine animalism. The mother ceases to be a\nwoman; she becomes a female, and her children are her cubs.\n\nHence we find in the mother something above reason and at the same time\nbelow it,--a something which we call instinct. Guided as she is by the\ninfinite and mysterious will of the universe, her very blindness is\ncharged with penetration.\n\nHowever anxious to make this unfortunate woman speak, Tellmarch could\nnot succeed. One day he said to her:--\n\n\"Unfortunately I am old, and can no longer walk. My strength is\nexhausted before I reach my journey's end. I would go with you, only\nthat my legs give out in about fifteen minutes and I have to stop\nand rest. However, it may be just as well for you that I cannot walk\nfar, as my company might be more dangerous than useful. Here, I am\ntolerated; but the Blues suspect me because I am a peasant, and the\npeasants because they believe me to be a wizard.\"\n\nHe waited for an answer, but she did not even raise her eyes.\n\nA fixed idea ends either in madness or heroism. But what heroism can\nbe expected from a poor peasant woman? None whatever. She can be a\nmother, and that is all. Each day she grew more and more absorbed in\nher reverie. Tellmarch was watching her.\n\nHe tried to keep her busy. He bought her needles, thread, and a\nthimble, and to the delight of the poor Caimand, she really began\nto busy herself with sewing; she still dreamed, it is true, but she\nworked also,--a sure sign of health,--and by degrees her strength\nreturned. She mended her underwear, her dress, and her shoes, her\neyes all the while preserving a strange, far-away look. As she sewed\nshe hummed to herself unintelligible songs. She would mutter names,\nprobably children's names, but not distinctly enough for Tellmarch to\nunderstand. Sometimes she paused and listened to the birds, as though\nshe expected a message from them. She watched the weather, and he could\nsee her lips move as she talked to herself in a low voice. She had made\na bag and filled it with chestnuts, and one morning Tellmarch found her\ngazing vaguely into the depths of the forest, and he saw that she was\nall ready to start.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n\nAnd she replied,--\n\n\"I am going to look for them.\"\n\nHe made no effort to detain her.\n\n\n[Illustration 084]\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nTHE TWO POLES OF TRUTH.\n\n\nAfter a few weeks, crowded with the vicissitudes of civil war\nthroughout the district of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, the talk ran for the most part\nupon two men, wholly unlike in character, who were nevertheless engaged\nin the same work, fighting side by side in the great revolutionary\nstruggle. The savage duel still continued, but the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e was losing\nground,--especially in Ille-et-Vilaine, where, thanks to the young\ncommander who at Dol had so opportunely confronted the audacity of\nsix thousand Royalists with that of fifteen hundred patriots, the\ninsurrection, if not suppressed, was at least far less active, and\nrestricted to certain limits. Several successful attacks had followed\nthat exploit, and from these repeated victories a new state of affairs\nhad sprung into existence. Matters had assumed a different aspect, but\na singular complication had arisen.\n\nThat the Republic was in the ascendant throughout this region of the\nVend\u00c3\u00a9e was beyond a doubt; but which Republic? Amidst the dawning\nof triumph, two republics confronted each other,--that of terror,\ndetermined to conquer by severity, and that of mercy, striving to\nwin the victory by mildness. Which was to prevail? The visible\nrepresentatives of these two forms, one of which was conciliatory and\nthe other implacable, were two men, each possessing influence and\nauthority,--one a military commander, the other a civil delegate.\nWhich of the two would win the day? The delegate was supported by\na tremendous influence; he came bringing with him the threatening\nwatchword from the Paris Commune to the battalion of Santerre: \"No\nmercy, no quarter!\" As a means of compelling implicit obedience to his\nauthority, he had the decree of the Convention reading as follows:\n\"Penalty of death to whomsoever shall set at liberty or connive at\nthe escape of a rebel chief,\" and also full powers from the Committee\nof Public Safety, with an injunction commanding obedience to him as a\ndelegate, signed by Robespierre, Danton, and Marat. The soldier, for\nhis part, had but the power that is born of pity.\n\nHis weapons of defence were his right arm to chastise the enemy, and\nhis heart to pardon them. As a conqueror, he felt that he had a right\nto spare the conquered.\n\nHence a conflict, deep but as yet unacknowledged, between these\ntwo men. They lived in different atmospheres, both wrestling with\nrebellion,--the one armed with the thunderbolts of victory, the other\nwith those of terror.\n\nThroughout the Bocage, men talked of nothing else; and the extreme\nintimacy of two men of such utterly opposite natures contributed to\nincrease the anxiety of those who were watching them on every side.\nThese two antagonists were friends. Never were two hearts drawn\ntogether by a deeper or a nobler sympathy. The man of ungentle nature\nhad saved the life of him who was merciful; the scar on his face bore\nwitness to the fact. These men represented in their own persons the\nimages of death and of life, embodying the principle of destruction and\nthat of peace, and they loved each other. Conceive, if you can, Orestes\nmerciful and Pylades pitiless. Try to imagine Arimanes the brother of\nOrmus!\n\nLet us also add that of these two men, the one who was called ferocious\nshowed himself at the same time the most brotherly of men. He dressed\nwounds, nursed the sick, spent his days and nights in the ambulances\nand hospitals, took pity on the barefooted children, kept nothing\nfor himself, but gave all he had to the poor. He never missed a\nbattle,--always marching at the head of the columns; was ever in the\nthickest of the fight,--armed, it is true, for he always wore in his\nbelt a sabre and two pistols, yet practically unarmed, for no one had\never seen him draw his sword or raise his pistols. He faced blows, but\nnever returned them. It was said that he had been a priest.\n\nThese two men were Gauvain and Cimourdain,--at variance in principles,\nthough united in friendship: it was like a soul cleft in twain; and\nGauvain had in truth received the gentler half of Cimourdain's nature.\nOne might say that the latter has bestowed the white ray upon Gauvain,\nand kept the black one for himself. Hence a secret discord. Sooner or\nlater this suppressed disagreement could hardly fail to explode; and\none morning the contest began as follows.\n\nCimourdain said to Gauvain,--\n\n\"What have we accomplished?\"\n\nTo which the latter replied,--\n\n\"You know as well as I. I have dispersed Lantenac's bands. He has but a\nfew men left, and has been driven to the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res. In eight\ndays he will be surrounded.\"\n\n\"And in fifteen?\"\n\n\"He will be captured.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"You have seen my notice?\"\n\n\"Yes; and what then?\"\n\n\"He is to be shot.\"\n\n\"A truce to clemency. He must be guillotined.\"\n\n\"I approve of a military death.\"\n\n\"And I of a revolutionary one.\"\n\nLooking Gauvain full in the face, Cimourdain said,--\n\n\"Why did you order those nuns of the convent of Saint-Marc-le-Blanc to\nbe set at liberty?\"\n\n\"I do not wage war against women,\" replied Gauvain.\n\n\"Those women hate the people; and when there is a question of hatred,\none woman is equal to ten men. Why did you refuse to send that band\nof fanatical old priests, whom you took at Louvign\u00c3\u00a9, before the\nrevolutionary tribunal?\"\n\n\"Neither do I wage war against old men.\"\n\n\"An old priest is worse than a young one. The rebellion that is\nadvocated by white hair is so much the more dangerous. People have\nfaith in wrinkles. Do not indulge in false pity, Gauvain. The regicide\nis the true liberator. Keep your eye on the tower of the Temple.\"\n\n\"The Temple Tower! I would have the Dauphin out of it. I am not making\nwar against children.\"\n\nCimourdain's eye grew stern.\n\n\"Learn then, Gauvain, that one must make war on a woman when her name\nis Marie-Antoinette, on an old man if he happens to be Pope Pius VI.,\nand upon a child who goes by the name of Louis Capet.\"\n\n\"I am no politician, master.\"\n\n\"Try, then, not to be a dangerous man. Why was it that during the\nattack of the post of Coss\u00c3\u00a9, when the rebel Jean Treton, repulsed and\ndefeated, rushed alone, sabre in hand, against your entire division,\nyou cried, 'Open the ranks! Let him pass through!'\"\n\n\"Because it is not fit that fifteen hundred men should be allowed to\nkill one man.\"\n\n\"And why at Cailleterie d'Astill\u00c3\u00a9, when you saw that your soldiers were\nabout to kill the Vendean Joseph B\u00c3\u00a9zier, who was wounded and just able\nto drag himself along, did you cry, 'Forward! leave this man to me!'\nand directly afterwards fire your pistol in the air?\"\n\n\"Because one shrinks from killing a fallen enemy.\"\n\n\"There you were wrong. Both of these men are leaders at this present\nmoment. Joseph B\u00c3\u00a9zier is known as Moustache, and Jean Treton as\nJambe-d'Argent. By saving their lives you presented the Republic with\ntwo enemies.\"\n\n[Illustration 095]\n\n\"I should prefer to make friends for her rather than enemies.\"\n\n\"After the victory of Land\u00c3\u00a9an, why did you not shoot the three hundred\npeasant prisoners?\"\n\n\"Because Bonchamp pardoned the Republican prisoners, and I wished it to\nbe known that the Republic pardons the Royalist prisoners.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose you will pardon Lantenac if you take him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not,--since you pardoned three hundred peasants?\"\n\n\"The peasants are only ignorant men. Lantenac knows what he is about.\"\n\n\"But Lantenac is your kinsman.\"\n\n\"And France nearer than he.\"\n\n\"Lantenac is an old man.\"\n\n\"To me Lantenac is a stranger; he has no age. He is ready to summon the\nEnglish, he represents invasion, he is the country's enemy, and the\nduel between us can only be ended by his death or mine.\"\n\n\"Remember these words, Gauvain.\"\n\n\"I have said them.\"\n\nFor a while both men remained silent, gazing at each other; then\nGauvain continued,--\n\n\"This will be a bloody year,--this '93.\"\n\n\"Tate care,\" cried Cimourdain. \"There are terrible duties to be\nperformed, and we must beware of accusing the innocent instrument.\nHow long since we have blamed the doctor for his patient's illness?\nYes, the chief characteristic of this stupendous year is its pitiless\nseverity. And why is this? Because it is the great revolutionary\nyear,--the year which is the very incarnation of revolution. Revolution\nfeels no more pity for its enemy, the old world, than the surgeon\nfeels for the gangrene against which he is fighting. The business\nof revolution is to extirpate royalty in the person of the king,\naristocracy in that of the nobleman, despotism in that of the soldier,\nand superstition and barbarism in the persons of the priest and the\njudge,--in one word, of every form of tyranny in the image of the\ntyrant. The operation is a fearful one, but revolution performs it\nwith a steady hand. As to the amount of sound flesh that must be\nsacrificed, ask a Boerhave what he thinks of it. Do you suppose it\npossible to remove a tumor without loss of blood? Can a conflagration\nbe extinguished without violent efforts? These terrible necessities are\nthe very condition of success. A surgeon may be compared to a butcher,\nor a healer may seem like an executioner. Revolution is devoted to its\nfatal work. It mutilates that it may save. What! can you expect it to\ntake pity on the virus? Would you have it merciful to poison? It will\nnot listen. It holds the past within its grasp, and it means to make an\nend of it. It cuts deeply into civilization, that it may promote the\nhealth of mankind. You suffer, no doubt; but consider for how short a\ntime it will endure,--only so long as the operation requires; and after\nthat is over you will live. Revolution is amputating the world; hence\nthis hemorrhage,--'93.\"\n\n\"A surgeon is calm,\" said Gauvain, \"and the men I see are violent.\"\n\n\"Revolution requires the aid of savage workmen,\" replied Cimourdain;\n\"it repulses all trembling hands; it trusts only such as are\ninexorable. Danton is the impersonation of the terrible, Robespierre\nof the inflexible, Saint-Just of the immovable, and Marat of the\nimplacable. Take note of it, Gauvain. We need these names. They are\nworth as much as armies to us. They will terrify Europe.\"\n\n\"And possibly the future also,\" replied Gauvain. He paused, and then\ncontinued,--\n\n\"But really, master, you are mistaken. I accuse no one. My idea of\nrevolution is that it shall be irresponsible. We ought not to say this\nman is innocent, or that one is guilty. Louis XVI. is like a sheep cast\namong lions. He wishes to escape, and in trying to defend himself he\nwould bite if he could; but one cannot turn into a lion at will. His\nweakness is regarded as a crime; and when the angry sheep shows his\nteeth, 'Ah, the traitor!' cry the lions, and they proceed straightway\nto devour him, and afterwards fall to fighting among themselves.\"\n\n\"The sheep is a brute.\"\n\n\"And what are the lions?\"\n\nThis answer set Cimourdain thinking.\n\n\"The lions,\" he replied, \"represent the human conscience, principles,\nideas.\"\n\n\"It is they who have caused the Reign of Terror.\"\n\n\"Some day the Revolution will justify all that.\"\n\n\"Take care lest Terror should prove the calumny of the Revolution.\"\n\nGauvain continued,--\n\n\"Liberty, equality, fraternity,--these are the dogmas of peace and\nharmony. Why give them so terrible an aspect? What are we striving to\naccomplish? To bring all nations under one universal republic. Well,\nthen, let us not terrify them. Of what use is intimidation? Neither\nnations nor birds can be attracted by fear. We must not do evil that\ngood may come. We have not overturned the throne to leave the scaffold\nstanding. Death to the king, and life to the nations. Let us strike\noff the crowns, but spare the heads. Revolution means concord, and\nnot terror. Schemes of benevolence are but poorly served by merciless\nmen. Amnesty is to me the grandest word in human language. I am\nopposed to the shedding of blood, save as I risk my own. Still, I am\nbut a soldier; I can do no more than fight. Yet if we are to lose\nthe privilege of pardoning, of what use is it to conquer? Let us be\nenemies, if you will, in battle; but when victory is ours, then is the\ntime to be brothers.\"\n\n\"Take care!\" repeated Cimourdain for the third time; \"take care,\nGauvain! You are dearer to me than a son.\"\n\nAnd he added, thoughtfully,--\n\n\"In times like these pity may be nothing less than treason in another\nform.\"\n\nListening to these two men, one might have fancied himself hearing a\ndialogue between a sword and all axe.\n\n\n[Illustration 086]\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nDOLOROSA.\n\n\nMeanwhile the mother was searching for her little ones, walking\nstraight onward; and how she subsisted we cannot tell, since she did\nnot know herself. She walked day and night, begging as she went, often\nliving on herbs and sleeping upon the ground in the open air, among\nthe bushes, under the stars, and sometimes mid the rain and the wind.\nThus she wandered from village to village and from farm to farm,\nmaking inquiries as she went along, but, tattered and torn as she was,\nnever venturing beyond the threshold. Sometimes she found a welcome,\nsometimes she was turned away; and when they refused to let her come\nin, she would go into the woods.\n\nUnfamiliar as she was with the country beyond Siscoignard and the\nparish of Az\u00c3\u00a9, and having nothing to serve as guide, she would retrace\nher steps, going over and over the same ground, thus wasting both\ntime and strength. Sometimes she followed the highway, sometimes the\ncart-ruts, and then again she would turn into the paths in the woods.\nIn this wandering life she had worn out her wretched garments. At first\nshe had her shoes, then she went barefoot, and it was not long before\nher feet were bleeding.\n\nUnconsciously she travelled on, mid bloodshed and warfare, neither\nhearing, seeing, nor trying to shield herself, simply looking for her\nchildren. As the entire country was in rebellion, there were no longer\nany gendarmes, or mayors, or authorities of any kind. Only such persons\nas she encountered on the way would she stop to ask.\n\n\"Have you seen three little children anywhere?\"\n\nAnd when the passers-by lifted their heads she would say,--\n\n\"Two boys and a girl,\" and go on to name them:\n\n\"Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, Gros-Alain, Georgette. Have you not seen them?\"\n\nAnd again,--\n\n\"The oldest one was four and a half and the youngest twenty months.\"\n\nPresently she would add,--\n\n\"Do you know where they are? They have been taken from me.\"\n\n[Illustration 087]\n\nPeople gazed at her, and that was all.\n\nPerceiving that she was not understood, she would explain,--\n\n\"It is because they are mine. That is the reason.\"\n\nAnd then seeing the passers-by continue their way, she would stand\nspeechless, tearing her breast with her nails. One day, however, a\npeasant stopped to listen to her. The worthy man set his wits at work.\n\n\"Let us see. Did you say three children?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Two boys?\"\n\n\"And a girl.\"\n\n\"And you are looking for them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was told that a nobleman had carried off three little children and\nkeeps them with him.\"\n\n\"Where is that man? Where are they?\" she cried.\n\n\"Yon must go to the Tourgue,\" answered the peasant.\n\n\"And shall I find my children there?\"\n\n\"Very likely you will.\"\n\n\"What did you say the name was?\"\n\n\"The Tourgue.\"\n\n\"What is the Tourgue?\"\n\n\"It is a place.\"\n\n\"Is it a village, a castle, or a farm?\"\n\n\"I never was there.\"\n\n\"Is it far?\"\n\n\"I should say so.\"\n\n\"In what direction?\"\n\n\"In the direction of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res.\"\n\n\"Which way shall I go?\"\n\n\"You are now at Ventortes,\" replied the peasant. \"You will leave\nErn\u00c3\u00a9e on your left and Coxelles on your right; you must pass through\nLongchamps, and cross the Leroux.\"\n\nThe peasant raised his hand and pointed westward.\n\n\"Keep straight ahead, facing the sunset.\"\n\nShe had already started before he had time to lower his arm.\n\nHe called out to her.\n\n\"You must be careful; they are fighting over there.\"\n\nShe never turned to reply, but walked straight ahead without pausing.\n\n\n[Illustration 088]\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nA PROVINCIAL BASTILE.\n\n\n[Illustration 089]\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nLA TOURGUE.\n\n\nThe traveller who forty years ago entered the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res from\nthe direction of Laignelet and came out towards Parign\u00c3\u00a9, might have\nbeheld on the edge of this dense forest a sinister sight, for emerging\nfrom the thicket he would come directly upon the Tourgue, and not the\nliving Tourgue, but the dead one.\n\nThe Tourgue cracked, battered, scarred, dismantled. A ruin may be\ncalled the ghost of an edifice. Nothing could be more lugubrious\nthan the aspect of the Tourgue. A high circular tower stood alone\nlike a malefactor on the edge of the wood, and rising as it did from\na precipitous rock, its severe and solid architecture gave it the\nappearance of a Roman structure, combining within itself the elements\nof power and of decay. In fact, it might in one sense be called Roman,\nsince it was Romance. It was begun in the ninth century and finished\nin the twelfth, after the time of the third crusade. The style of the\nimposts of its embrasures indicated its period. If one approached\nit and cared to climb the slope, he might perceive a breach in the\nwall; and if he ventured to enter in, he would find a vacant space\nand nothing more. It was not unlike the inside of a stone trumpet set\nupright on the ground. From top to bottom there were no partitions,\nand neither ceilings nor floors; here and there arches and chimneys\nhad evidently been torn away, and falconet embrasures were still seen;\nat different heights, rows of granite corbels and a few cross-beams\ncovered with the ordure of the night birds marked the separate stories;\na colossal wall, fifteen feet thick at its base and twelve at its\nsummit; cracks here and there, and holes which once were doors, and\nthrough which one caught glimpses of staircases within the gloomy\nwalls. One who passing by at evening might venture in, would hear the\ncry of the wood-owl, the goat-suckers, and the night-herons; would find\nbrambles, stones, and reptiles beneath his feet; and overhead, through\na dark circular opening at the top of the tower which looked like the\nmouth of an enormous well, he might see the stars.\n\nLocal tradition relates that there were secret doors in the upper\nstories of this tower, like those in the tombs of the kings of Judah,\ncomposed of one large stone turning on a pivot, which when closed could\nnot be distinguished from the wall itself,--a fashion in architecture\nbrought home by the crusaders, together with the pointed arch. When\nthese doors were closed, it was impossible to discover them, so\nskilfully were they fitted into the rest of the stones. Such doors can\nbe found to-day in those mysterious Libyan cities which escaped the\nearthquakes that buried the twelve cities in the time of Tiberius.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nTHE BREACH.\n\nThe breach by which one gained access to the ruin was the opening of\na mine. A connoisseur familiar with Errard, Sardi, and Pagan would\nhave appreciated the skill with which this mine was planned. The\nfire-chamber, in the shape of a biretta, was of a size accurately\nproportioned to the strength of the keep which it was intended to\ndestroy. It was capable of containing at least two hundred-weight of\npowder. The winding passage which led to it was more effective than\na straight one. The saucisse, laid bare among the broken stones as\nthe result of the crumbling caused by the mine, was seen to have the\nrequisite diameter of a hen's-egg. The explosion had made a deep rent\nin the wall, by which the assailants were enabled to enter. It was\nevident that this tower must have sustained formal sieges from time to\ntime. It was riddled with balls, and these were not all of the same\nepoch; every missile has its own special way of marking a rampart, and\neach one, from the stone bullets of the fourteenth century to the iron\nones of the eighteenth, had left a scar upon this donjon-keep.\n\nThe breach opened into what must have been the ground-floor; and\ndirectly opposite, in the wall of the tower, was the gateway of a\ncrypt, cut in the rock and extending under the hall of the lower floor\nthroughout the foundation of the tower.\n\nThis crypt, three-fourths filled up, was cleared out in 1835, under the\ndirection of Auguste Le Provost, the antiquary of Bernay.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTHE OUBLIETTE.\n\nThis crypt was the oubliette. Every keep possessed one, and this, like\nmany other penal dungeons of the same period, had two stories. The\nfirst story, accessible through the gate, consisted of a good-sized\nvaulted chamber, on a level with the hall of the ground-floor. On the\nwalls of this room might be seen two vertical furrows, parallel with\neach other, reaching from wall to wall and passing along the vault,\nwhere they had left a deep rut, reminding one of wheel-tracks,--and\nsuch in fact they were; for these two furrows were hollowed out by\ntwo wheels. In old feudal times men had been torn limb from limb here\nin this very room, by a process less noisy than that of being drawn\nand quartered. They had a pair of wheels so large and powerful that\nthey filled the entire room, touching both walls and ceiling, and to\neach wheel was attached an arm and a leg of the victim; and when these\nwheels were turned in opposite directions, the man was torn asunder. It\nrequired great power; hence the ruts worn in the stone by the grazing\nof the wheels. A room of this kind may be seen at Vianden.\n\n[Illustration 090]\n\nAbove this room there was another, the actual oubliette, whose only\nentrance was a hole which served the purpose of a door; the victim,\nstripped of his clothes, was let down, by means of a rope tied under\nhis armpits, into the room below, through an opening made in the middle\nof the flagging of the upper room. If he persisted in living, food was\nthrown to him through this aperture. A similar hole may still be seen\nat Bouillon.\n\nThis chamber below, excavated under the hall of the ground-floor to\nsuch a depth that it reached water, and constantly swept by an icy\nwind, was more like a well than a room. But the wind so fatal to the\nprisoner in the depths was, on the other hand, favorable to the one\noverhead, groping about beneath the vault, who could breathe the\neasier on account of it; indeed, all the air he had, came up through\nthis hole. But then any man who entered, or rather fell, into this\ntomb, never came out again. It behooved the prisoner to look out for\nhimself in the darkness, for it needed but one false step to change the\nscene of his sufferings. That, however, was his own affair. If he were\ntenacious of life, this hole was his danger; but if he were weary of\nit, it was his resource. The upper story was the dungeon, the lower one\nthe tomb,--a superposition not unlike that of the society of the period.\n\nThis is what our ancestors called a moat-dungeon; but since the thing\nitself has disappeared, the name has no longer any meaning for us.\nThanks to the Revolution, we can listen with indifference to the sound\nof these words. On the outside of the tower, and above the breach,\nwhich forty years ago was its only entrance, might be seen an embrasure\nsomewhat wider than the other loopholes, from which hung an iron\ngrating, loosened and broken.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nTHE BRIDGE-CASTLE.\n\nA stone bridge whose three arches were but slightly damaged, was\nconnected with this tower on the side opposite to the breach. This\nbridge had once supported a building whose few remaining fragments bore\nthe traces of a conflagration; it was only the framework that was left\nstanding, and as the light shone through its interstices as it rose\nside by side with the tower, it had the effect of a skeleton beside a\nphantom.\n\nTo-day this ruin is utterly demolished, leaving no trace whatever\nbehind. A single peasant can destroy in one day structures that\nkings have labored for centuries to erect. La Tourgue, a peasant\nabbreviation, signifies La Tour-Gauvain, just as La Jupelle stands for\nLa Jupelli\u00c3\u00a8re, and Pinson le Tort, the name of a hunchback leader, for\nPinson le Tortu.\n\nLa Tourgue, which even forty years ago was a ruin, and which to-day is\nbut a shadow, was a fortress in 1793. It was the old Bastile of the\nGauvains, and served to guard, towards the west, the entrance of the\nforest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, which is now little more than a grove.\n\nThis fortress was built on one of those great blocks of slate which\nare found in abundance between Mayence and Dinan, scattered in all\ndirections among the copses and along the heath like the missiles\nof some Titanic combat. The tower composed the entire fortress; and\nbelow the tower stood the rock at whose base flowed one of those\nwater-courses which swells into a torrent in January and dries up in\nJune.\n\nSimple as were its means of defence, this tower was almost impregnable\nin the Middle Ages, but the bridge had proved a source of weakness.\nThe Gauvains of Gothic times had built it without a bridge. It was\nformerly accessible by means of one of those swinging bridges that\ncould be instantly severed by the stroke of an axe. So long as the\nGauvains remained Viscounts it pleased them just as it was, and they\nwere satisfied with it. But when they became Marquises and exchanged\nthe keep for the Court, they spanned the stream with three arches and\nthus offered access in the direction of the plain very much as they had\nyielded to the advances of the king. The marquises of the seventeenth\ncentury and the marchionesses of the seventeenth no longer prided\nthemselves on their impregnability. They abandoned the traditions of\ntheir ancestors to follow the fashions of Versailles.\n\nFacing the tower towards the west was a somewhat elevated plateau\nadjoining two plains; this plateau was very near the tower, only\nseparated from it by a deep ravine through which flowed a stream\ntributary to the Couesnon. The bridge that connected the fortress with\nthe plateau stood on lofty piles, and on these piles was constructed\nas at Chenonceaux a building in the Mansard style of architecture, but\nmore comfortable than the tower. Customs were still very rude, and the\nlords continued to occupy chambers in the keep that were more like\ndungeons than bedrooms. As to the building on the bridge, which was a\ndiminutive kind of castle, a long corridor had been added to it, by\nway of entrance, which was called the hall of the guards. Over this\nhall, which was like an entresol, was the library, and above that a\ngranary. Separated by pillars stood the long windows with their small\npanes of Bohemian glass; medallions were sculptured on the walls. The\nfortress was three stories high; halberds and muskets were to be found\nbelow, books in the middle, and over all the bags of oats,--a somewhat\nbarbarous arrangement, but princely to the last degree.\n\nThe tower loomed above this coquettish building presenting a stern and\ngloomy contrast.\n\nThe platform offered a point of attack from which the bridge could be\ndestroyed.\n\nBetween these two buildings there was no harmony whatsoever; the\nroughness of the one jarred against the elegance of the other. It would\nseem as if two semicircles ought to be identical; yet no two styles\nhave less in common than that of a Roman semicircle and a classic\narchivolt. That tower, a worthy companion for the forest, was a strange\nneighbor for the bridge, which might have come from Versailles. Fancy\nLouis XIV. leaning on the arm of Alain Barbe-Torte. There was something\nappalling in this juxtaposition. An inexpressible spirit of terror\npervaded the combined majesty of these structures.\n\nLet us repeat, that from a military point of view the bridge went\nfar towards betraying the tower; for while it added to its beauty it\ndiminished its strength, ornamenting it on the one hand and weakening\nit on the other; by placing it on a level with the plateau, it had\nexposed it to attacks from that direction, although it still remained\nimpregnable in the direction of the forest. Formerly it had commanded\nthe plateau, but matters were now reversed. An enemy installed on the\nplain would speedily become master of the bridge. The library and\nthe granary were advantageous to the besiegers rather than to the\nbesieged, since the contents of both are of a combustible nature. For\nan assailant who knows how to avail himself of fire as a means of\nassault, it matters but little whether it be a Homer or a bundle of\nhay, provided it burns. The French offered a proof of this fact to the\nGermans when they burned the library at Heidelberg, as did the Germans\nin burning that of Strasbourg. In short, this bridge built on to the\nTourgue was a strategic mistake; but in the seventeenth century, under\nColbert and Louvois, the Princes Gauvain, like the Princes de Rohan or\nLa Tremoille, believed themselves henceforth safe from assault. Still,\nthe builders of the bridge had taken certain precautions. In the first\nplace, anticipating the chances of fire, they had fastened crosswise\nbelow the three windows looking towards the stream, by iron clamps\nwhich no longer than fifty years ago were still to be seen, a strong\nladder, equal in length to the height of the first two stories of the\nbridge,--a height surpassing that of three ordinary stories; secondly,\nforeseeing the possibility of a siege, they had isolated the bridge\nfrom the tower by means of a low and heavy iron door, arched at the top\nand locked with a large key, whose hiding-place was known to the master\nalone; once closed, it could defy the battering-ram and almost brave\nthe cannon-ball.\n\nOne must cross the bridge to reach this door, which was the only means\nof access to the tower.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nTHE IRON DOOR.\n\nAs a result of the elevation of this castle on the bridge by means of\npiles, its second story was on a level with the corresponding story of\nthe tower; and here, for greater safety, the iron door had been placed.\n\nThis iron door led from the bridge into the library, and from the\ntower into a large vaulted hall with a pillar in the centre. As\nalready stated, this hall was in the second story of the keep. Like\nthe tower itself, it was circular in its form, and was lighted by deep\nembrasures overlooking the fields. The stones of its rough and naked\nwalls, unhidden from the view, were, however, symmetrically adjusted.\nThis hall was reached by a spiral staircase built in the wall,--quite\na simple matter when walls are fifteen feet thick. In the Middle Ages\nthey used to capture a city by streets, a street by houses, and a\nhouse by rooms; and thus a fortress was besieged story by story. In\nthis respect La Tourgue was very skilfully arranged, and very difficult\nto cope with. An uncomfortable staircase connected one story with\nanother; the doors were sloping, and not high enough to admit a man\nunless he bent his head; and where at every door the besieged stood in\nwaiting for their assailants, a bowed head was certain death.\n\nBelow the circular hall with the pillar were two similar rooms,\ncomposing the first story and the ground-floor, and above these three\nmore. The tower was closed, so to speak, by a platform which rested on\nthese six rooms like a stone cover, and a narrow watch-tower led up to\nthe platform.\n\nAs they were obliged to pierce this wall in which the iron door was\nsealed to a depth of fifteen feet, it was thereby framed in a deep\narchway, which when the door was closed formed a porch six or seven\nfeet deep, towards the bridge as well as towards the tower, and when\nit was open these two porches united to form the entrance arch. Set in\nthe wall under the porch, towards the bridge, was a low gate with a\nSaint-Gilles bolt, leading into the corridor of the first story under\nthe library. This was another difficulty for the besiegers. That side\nof the castle on the bridge looking towards the plateau ended in a\nperpendicular wall, and there the bridge was severed. The drawbridge\nset up against a low gate to connect it with the plateau, and which\non account of the height of the latter could only be lowered like an\ninclined plane, led into the long corridor called the guard-room. The\nbesiegers who found themselves in possession of this corridor would\nhave been obliged to carry by main force the Saint-Gilles winding\nstairway that led to the second story, in order to reach the iron gate.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTHE LIBRARY.\n\nAs to the library, it was an oblong room of the same length and width\nas the bridge, with a single door, and that the iron one. A false\nfolding-door covered with green cloth, which only needed to be pushed,\nconcealed within the entrance arch of the tower. The walls of the\nlibrary were lined from floor to ceiling with glass bookcases in the\nfine taste of the seventeenth century cabinet-work, and lighted by six\nlarge windows, three on a side,--that is, one over each arch. Through\nthese windows the interior of the room was visible from the height of\nthe platform. Between the windows stood six marble busts on pedestals\nof carved oak,--Hermola\u00c3\u00bcs of Byzantium, the grammarian Athen\u00c3\u00a6us\nof Naucratis, Suidas, Casaubon, Clovis, King of France, and his\nchancellor, Anachalus,--who for that matter was no more a chancellor\nthan Clovis was a king.\n\nThere were various books in the library. One has remained famous.\nIt was an ancient quarto, enriched with prints, with the title\n\"Saint Bartholomew\" in large letters, together with the sub-title,\n\"Gospel according to Saint Bartholomew, preceded by a dissertation by\nPantoenus, Christian philosopher, on the question as to whether this\nGospel should be considered apocryphal, and whether Saint Bartholomew\nis identical with Nathanal.\" This book, supposed to be a unique copy,\nwas placed on a reading-desk in the middle of the library. In the last\ncentury people came to see it as a curiosity.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nTHE GRANARY.\n\nAs for the granary, which, like the library, followed the oblong form\nof the bridge, it was merely the space under the woodwork of the roof.\nIt consisted of a large room filled with hay and straw, and lighted by\nsix Mansard windows, with no other ornament than the statue of Saint\nBarnabas sculptured on the door, and below it the following verse:--\n\n      \"Barnabus sanctus falcem jubet ire per herbam.\"\n\nA lofty and massive tower, six stories in height, pierced here and\nthere by a few embrasures, its sole means of entrance and egress an\niron door opening into a bridge-castle closed by a drawbridge; behind\nthe tower a forest, before it a heath-covered plateau, higher than the\nbridge, lower than the tower; below the bridge, between the tower and\nthe plateau, a deep narrow ravine filled with underbrush, a torrent in\nwinter, a stream in the springtime, and a rocky bed in summer,--such\nwas the Tour-Gauvain, called La Tourgue.\n\n\n[Illustration 091]\n\n[Illustration: The Hostages 092]\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nTHE HOSTAGES.\n\n\nJuly passed away, and August came. A blast, fierce and heroic,\nhad swept over France; two spectres had but just crossed the\nhorizon,--Marat with a dagger in his side, and Charlotte Corday\nheadless: events looked threatening. As to the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, defeated in\nher grand strategic schemes, she turned her attention to others on a\nsmaller scale, which, as we have already said, were likely to prove\nmore dangerous. This war had now become one monstrous battle scattered\nabout in the woods: the disasters of the grand army, Royal and\nCatholic, so called, had begun. A decree had been passed to send the\narmy of Mayence into the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e; eight thousand Vendeans were killed\nat Ancenis; they were repulsed from Nantes, dislodged from Montaigu,\nexpelled from Thouars, driven out of Noirmoutier, pitched headlong\nout of Cholet, Mortagne, and Saumur; they had evacuated Parthenay,\nabandoned Clisson, and lost ground at Ch\u00c3\u00a2tillon; at Saint-Hilaire their\nflag was captured; they were defeated at Pornic, Sables, Fontenay,\nDoui, Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau-d'Eau, and Ponts-de-C\u00c3\u00a9; they were checkmated at Lu\u00c3\u00a7on,\nretreated from Ch\u00c3\u00a2taigneraye, and were routed at the Roche-sur-Yon;\nat present, while they threatened La Rochelle on the one hand, on the\nother an English fleet riding in the waters of Guernsey, commanded by\nGeneral Craig, and carrying several regiments of the English army,\ntogether with some of the best officers of the French navy, was only\nwaiting for the signal of the Marquis de Lantenac to disembark,--a\ndescent which might once more turn the tide of victory in favor of the\nRoyalists. Pitt was but a political malefactor. As the dagger to an\narmament, even so is treason to political warfare. Pitt stabbed our\ncountry, and betrayed his own, since to dishonor is to betray. Through\nhis influence and under his administration England waged Punic warfare.\nShe spied, cheated, and deceived. Poacher and forger, she stopped at\nnothing, stooping to the petty details of hatred. She established\na monopoly of tallow that cost five francs a pound. A letter from\nPrigent, Pitt's agent in the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, which was seized on the person of\nan Englishman at Lille, contained the following lines: \"I beg you to\nspare no money. In regard to the assassinations, we hope that prudence\nwill be exercised; disguised priests and women are the most suitable\nfor this work. Send sixty thousand livres to Rouen, and fifty thousand\nto Caen.\" This letter was read by Bar\u00c3\u00a8re at the Convention on the first\nday of August. As a retaliation for these acts of treachery witness the\ncruelties of Parrein, and still later the atrocities of Carrier. The\nRepublicans of Metz and those of the South were eager to march against\nthe rebels. A decree was passed ordering the formation of twenty-four\ncompanies of sappers, who were to burn the fences and enclosures of the\nBocage. Here was a crisis without parallel. War was suspended in one\ndirection only to break out in another. \"No mercy! No prisoners!\" was\nthe war-cry of both parties. Dark and terrible shadows fall across the\npages of history in these times.\n\nIn this very month of August the Tourgue was besieged.\n\nOne evening, just as the stars were rising in the calm twilight\npeculiar to dog-day weather, when not a leaf stirred in the woods, nor\na blade of grass quivered on the plain, the sound of a horn was heard\nthrough the silence of the approaching night. It came from the summit\nof the tower.\n\nThis peal was answered by the ring of a clarion from below. On the top\nof the tower stood an armed man, and in the shadow below lay a camp.\n\nIn the obscurity around the Tour-Gauvain one could dimly distinguish\nthe moving to and fro of dark figures. This was the bivouac. A few\nfires had been kindled beneath the forest-trees and among the heather\nof the plateau, their shining points of light pricking through the\ndarkness here and there, as if earth as well as sky would deck itself\nout with stars, though it were but with the lurid stars of war. Towards\nthe plateau the bivouac stretched as far as the plain, and in the\ndirection of the forest it extended into the thicket. The Tourgue was\ninvested.\n\nThe extent of the besiegers' bivouac indicated a numerous force.\n\nThe camp pressed hard upon the fortress, reaching to the rock in the\ndirection of the tower, and as far as the ravine on the side of the\nbridge.\n\nAnother peal from the horn was heard, followed by a second blast from\nthe clarion.\n\nThe horn asked the question, and the clarion made reply.\n\nThe horn was the voice of the tower asking the camp, \"May we speak with\nyou?\" To which the clarion, speaking for the camp, answered, \"Yes.\"\n\nAt that time the Convention did not regard the Vendeans in the light\nof belligerents, and it being forbidden by a decree to exchange flags\nof truce with \"the brigands,\" they supplemented as best they could the\nusual means of communication which international law authorizes in\nordinary warfare, but interdicts in civil conflicts. Consequently in\ntime of need a certain understanding existed between the peasant horn\nand the military clarion. The first call simply broached the subject;\nthe second asked the question, \"Will you listen?\" If the clarion made\nno reply to the second question, it meant refusal. If, on the other\nhand, the clarion replied, it was consent, and signified a truce for a\nfew minutes.\n\nWhen the clarion answered this second call, the man who stood on the\ntop of the tower spoke, and these were his words:--\n\n\"Be it known to all ye who hear me, I am Gouge-le-Bruant, surnamed\nBrise-Bleu because I have killed many of your people, and also\nsurnamed the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus because I mean to kill many more; in the attack\nat Granville, while my finger rested on the barrel of my gun, it was\nchopped off by a sabre-stroke; at Laval you guillotined my father, my\nmother, and my eighteen-year-old sister Jacqueline. And now you know me.\n\n\"I speak to you in the name of my master, Monseigneur le Marquis\nGauvain de Lantenac, Vicomte de Fontenay, Breton Prince, and owner of\nthe Seven Forests.\n\n\"It is well for you to learn that before shutting himself up in this\ntower, where you hold him blockaded, Monsieur le Marquis distributed\nthe command among six chiefs, his lieutenants. To Deli\u00c3\u00a8re he assigned\nthe country between the woods of Brest and Erne\u00c3\u00a9; to Treton, that\nwhich lies between the Ro\u00c3\u00ab and Laval; to Jacquet, called Taillefer,\nthe border of the Haut-Maine; to Gaulier, called Grand-Pierre,\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teau-Gontier; to Lecomte, Craon; to Monsieur Dubois-Guy, Foug\u00c3\u00a8res;\nand to Monsieur de Rochambeau, all Mayenne; so that the capture of this\nfortress by no means ends the war for you, and even were Monsieur le\nMarquis to die, the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e of God and the king will still live.\n\n\"I say this for your information. Monseigneur is here beside me; I am\nbut his mouthpiece. Silence, besiegers!\n\n\"It will be well for you to consider my words.\n\n\"Remember that the war you are waging against us is unjust; we are men\nliving in our own land and fighting honestly. Submissive to the will\nof God, we are as simple and upright as the grass beneath the dew. It\nis the Republic who has attacked us: she comes to trouble us in our\nfields; she has burned our houses and our harvests and destroyed our\nfarms, and our women and children have been forced to run barefoot in\nthe woods while the hedge-sparrow was still singing.\n\n\"You who are down there listening to me,--you have pursued us through\nthe forest and surrounded us in this tower; you have killed or\nscattered our allies; you have cannon, and you have added to your\ndivision the garrisons and the posts of Mortain, Barenton, Teilleul,\nLandivy, Evran, Tint\u00c3\u00a9niac, and Vitr\u00c3\u00a9,--which gives you four thousand\nfive hundred men with which to attack us.\n\n\"We, who are nineteen for the defence, are supplied with provisions and\nmunitions.\n\n\"You have succeeded in undermining and blowing up a part of our rock\nand wall, thus making a breach at the foot of the tower, through which\nyou can enter, although it is not open, while the tower stands strong\nand upright, forming an arch above it.\n\n\"Now you are preparing for the assault.\n\n\"And we--first of all, Monseigneur le Marquis, who is a Breton prince\nand the secular prior of the Abbey of Sainte-Marie de Lantenac, where\na daily Mass was instituted by Queen Jeanne, and the other defenders\nof this tower, who are: Monsieur l'Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Turmeau, whose military name\nis Grand-Francoeur; my comrades, Guinoiseau, captain of the Camp-Vert;\nChante-en-Hiver, captain of the camp of Avoine; Musette, captain of the\ncamp Fourmis; and myself, a peasant, born in the town of Daon, through\nwhich runs the brook Moriandre,--we have one thing to tell you.\n\n\"Listen, now, ye men at the foot of this tower!\n\n\"We hold three prisoners,--the same children who were adopted by one of\nyour battalions, and they are yours. We offer to give them back to you\non one condition,--that we be allowed to go free.\n\n\"If you refuse,--listen to this. There are but two points of\nattack,--either the breach or the bridge, according as you advance from\nthe fortress or the plateau. There are three stories in the building\non the bridge; in the lower one I, the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, who speak to you, have\nplaced six casks of tar and one hundred bundles of dry heather; there\nis straw in the upper, and there are books and papers in the middle\nstory; the iron door communicating with the tower is closed, and\nmonseigneur carries the key on his person; I have made a hole under\nthe door, through which is passed a sulphur slow-match; one end of it\nis in a cask of tar, and the other within reach of my hand, inside the\ntower; I can set it on fire whenever I choose. If you refuse to let us\ngo free, the children will be placed on the second floor of the bridge,\nbetween the story where the sulphur-match ends in the barrel and the\none which is filled with straw, and the iron door will be closed on\nthem. If you attack us by way of the bridge, you will be the ones to\nset the building on fire; if by the breach, it will be left to us; and\nif you attack us from both sides at once, we shall both be kindling the\nfire at the same instant; at all events, the three children will perish.\n\n\"It rests with you, now, either to accept or refuse.\n\n\"If you accept, we depart; if you refuse, the children die.\n\n\"I have finished,\"\n\nAnd the man who had been speaking from the top of the tower was silent.\n\n\"We refuse!\" cried a voice from below, in tones abrupt and severe.\nAnother voice, quite as firm, although less harsh, added,--\n\n\"We give you twenty-four hours to surrender at discretion.\"\n\nA silence ensued, and then the same voice continued,--\n\n\"If to-morrow at this hour you have not surrendered, we begin the\nassault.\"\n\n\"And give no quarter,\" resumed the first speaker; and then a voice\nfrom the top of the tower made reply to the savage one. Between two\nbattlements a tall figure, in which, by the light of the stars,\none might have recognized the awe-inspiring form of the Marquis de\nLantenac, leaned forward; his glance, piercing the shadows, seemed\nsearching for some one.\n\n\"Ah, it is thou, priest!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, it is I, traitor!\" replied the harsh voice from below.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nTERRIBLE AS THE ANTIQUE.\n\n\nThis implacable voice was in truth the voice of Cimourdain; the younger\nand less imperative one was that of Gauvain.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac had not been mistaken in his recognition of the\nAbb\u00c3\u00a9 Cimourdain.\n\nIn this district, ensanguined by civil war, Cimourdain, as we have\nsaid, had in a few weeks become famous. No man had won a more baleful\nnotoriety. Men would say: \"Marat in Paris, Ch\u00c3\u00a2lier at Lyons, Cimourdain\nin the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e.\" All the veneration which the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Cimourdain had\nformerly enjoyed was now turned to his dishonor. This is what a priest\nwho unfrocks himself may fairly expect.\n\nCimourdain excited a feeling of horror. The austere are unfortunate,\ninasmuch as their own acts seem to condemn them. Could their\nconsciences be revealed, men might perhaps absolve them. A Lycurgus\nmisunderstood may seem like a Tiberius. However, the fact remains that\nthese two men--the Marquis de Lantenac and the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Cimourdain--were\nequally matched in regard to the hatred they inspired. The maledictions\nhurled at Cimourdain by the Royalists were counterbalanced by the\nexecrations which the Republicans heaped upon Lantenac. Each of those\nmen seemed a monster in the eyes of the opposite camp. In fact, by\na singular coincidence it chanced that while Prieur de la Marne\nat Granville had set a price on the head of Lantenac, Charette at\nNoirmoutier had likewise set one on that of Cimourdain.\n\nWe may observe that these two men--the Marquis and the\npriest--represented in a certain degree one and the same man. The\nbronze mask of civil war has a double profile, one of which looks\ntowards the past, the other towards the future. Lantenac wore the\nformer, Cimourdain the latter; only the bitter sneer of Lantenac was\nshrouded in darkness, whereas on Cimourdain's fatal brow might be\ndiscerned a glimmer of the dawn.\n\nMeanwhile the besieged Tourgue was enjoying a respite.\n\nThanks to the intervention of Gauvain, they had agreed upon a sort of\ntruce for twenty-four hours.\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus had indeed been well informed. In consequence of\nCimourdain's requisitions Gauvain was now in command of four thousand\nfive hundred men, national guards as well as troops of the line, with\nwhich he surrounded Lantenac in the Tourgue, and could, moreover, bring\nto bear against the fortress a masked battery of six cannon, planted on\nthe edge of the forest towards the tower, together with an open battery\nof six on the plateau towards the bridge. He had succeeded in springing\nthe mine, and a breach had been made at the foot of the tower.\n\nThus on the expiration of the twenty-four hours' truce, the struggle\nwould begin again under the following conditions:--\n\nOn the plateau and in the forest were four thousand five hundred men\nagainst nineteen in the tower.\n\nHistory may find the names of the nineteen besieged in the placards\nposted against outlaws. We may possibly come across them.\n\nIt would have pleased Cimourdain had Gauvain consented to accept the\nrank of adjutant-general, in order to command these four thousand five\nhundred men, which was practically an army. But the latter refused,\nsaying: \"We will consider that matter after Lantenac is taken; I have\nwon no promotion as yet.\"\n\nThese important commands, held by officers of subordinate rank, were,\nmoreover, in accordance with Republican customs. Bonaparte, later\non, while as yet only a colonel of artillery, was at the same time\ncommander-in-chief of the army of Italy.\n\nIt was a strange fate for the Tour-Gauvain to be attacked by one\nGauvain, while defended by another member of the same family. Hence a\ncertain reluctance in the attack, but none in the defence; for M. de\nLantenac was a man who spared nothing. Accustomed as he had been to\nlive at Versailles, he had no feeling of regard for the Tourgue, which\nhe scarcely knew. He had sought refuge there, simply because he had\nno other resource; but he would have destroyed it without a scruple.\nGauvain felt more respect for it.\n\nThe bridge was the weak point of the fortress, but in the library\nabove it were the family records. Now, if the assault began there, the\nburning of the bridge would be inevitable, and it seemed to Gauvain\nthat to burn the records would be like attacking his ancestors. The\nTourgue was the ancestral manor of the Gauvain family; from this tower\nstarted all their fiefs of Brittany, as those of France from the tower\nof the Louvre. It was the centre round which clustered the family\nassociations of the Gauvains. He himself was born there; and now, led\nby the tortuous chances of fate, the grown man had come to attack the\nvenerable walls that had protected his childhood.\n\n[Illustration 093]\n\nWas it an impious act to lay this dwelling in ashes? Perhaps his own\ncradle was stored away in some corner of the granary over the library.\nCertain trains of thought assume the nature of emotions. Before the\nold family mansion Gauvain felt himself deeply moved, and it was in\nconsequence of this feeling that he had spared the bridge. Contenting\nhimself with making it impossible for the enemy to sally forth or\nattempt an escape at this point of egress, he held the bridge in check\nby a battery, and chose the opposite side for the attack. Hence the\nmining and sapping at the foot of the tower.\n\nCimourdain had allowed him to take his own course, meanwhile\nreproaching himself; for these Gothic antiquities were odious to his\nsevere soul, and he was no more indulgent towards buildings than\ntowards human beings. Sparing a castle was the first step in the\ndirection of mercy; and he knew that mercy was Gauvain's weak point.\nCimourdain, as we are aware, kept watch over him, and arrested his\nprogress down this slope, so fatal in his eyes. And yet even he--and he\nacknowledged it to himself with a sort of indignation--had been unable\nto see the Tourgue again without a secret emotion: he was affected by\nthe sight of that schoolroom containing the first books in which he\nhad taught Gauvain to read. He had been the cur\u00c3\u00a9 of the neighboring\nvillage Parign\u00c3\u00a9; had occupied an upper room in the castle on the\nbridge; it was in the library that he held little Gauvain between\nhis knees, and taught him the alphabet; within these four old walls\nhe had seen his beloved pupil, the child of his soul, growing up to\nmanhood, and watched the development of his mind. Was he about to burn\nand destroy this library, this castle, these walls, wherein he had so\noften blessed the child? He had spared them, but it had not been done\nwithout compunction.\n\nHe had allowed Gauvain to begin the siege from the opposite point. The\ntower might have been called the savage side of the Tourgue, and the\nlibrary its civilized side. Cimourdain had allowed Gauvain to make the\nbreach only in the former.\n\nThis ancient castle in the midst of the Revolution had, after all, only\nresumed its feudal customs, in being at the same time attacked and\ndefended by a Gauvain. The history of the Middle Ages is but a record\nof wars between kinsmen. \u00c3\u0089t\u00c3\u00a9ocles and Polynices are Gothic as well as\nGrecian; and Hamlet but repeats in Elsinore what Orestes did in Argos.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nTHE RESCUE PLANNED.\n\n\nThe entire night was spent by both parties in preparations. As soon as\nthe gloomy parley to which we lately listened was over, Gauvain's first\nact was to summon his lieutenant.\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9champ, with whom we must become acquainted, was a man of the\nsecondary order, honest, brave, commonplace, a better soldier than\ncommander, strictly intelligent up to the point when it becomes a duty\nnot to understand, never moved to tenderness, proof against corruption\nin whatsoever shape it might present itself,--whether in the form of\nbribery, that taints the conscience, or in that of pity, that corrupts\njustice. As the eyes of a horse are shaded by his blinders, so were his\nheart and soul protected by the two screens of discipline and the order\nof command, and he walked straight ahead in the space they allowed him\nto see. His course was direct, but his path was narrow.\n\nA man to be depended on, withal,--stern in command, exact in obedience.\n\nGauvain spoke in rapid tones,--\n\n\"We need a ladder, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ.\"\n\n\"We have none, commander.\"\n\n\"One must be found.\"\n\n\"For scaling?\"\n\n\"No; for rescue.\"\n\nAfter a moments reflection, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ replied,--\n\n\"I understand. But to serve your purpose a very long one is needed.\"\n\n\"The length of three stories.\"\n\n\"Yes, commander, that's about the height.\"\n\n\"It ought to be longer than that, for we must be sure of success.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"How is it that you have no ladder?\"\n\n[Illustration 094]\n\n\"Commander, you did not think it best to besiege the Tourgue from the\nplateau; you were satisfied to blockade it on that side; you planned\nthe attack by way of the tower, and not from the bridge. So we gave our\nattention to the mine, and thought no more about the scaling. That is\nwhy we have no ladder.\"\n\n\"Have one made at once.\"\n\n\"A ladder of the length of three stories cannot be made at once.\"\n\n\"Then fasten several short ones together.\"\n\n\"But we must first get our ladders.\"\n\n\"Find them.\"\n\n\"There are none to be found. All through the country the peasants\ndestroy ladders, just as they break up the carts and cut the bridges.\"\n\n\"True, they intend to paralyze the Republic.\"\n\n\"They mean that we shall neither transport baggage, cross a river, nor\nscale a wall.\"\n\n\"But I must have a ladder, in spite of all that.\"\n\n\"I was thinking, commander, that at Javen\u00c3\u00a9, near Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, there is a\nlarge carpenter's shop. We might get one there.\"\n\n\"There is not a moment to lose.\"\n\n\"When do you want the ladder?\"\n\n\"By this time to-morrow, at the latest.\"\n\n\"I will send a messenger at full speed to Javen\u00c3\u00a9 to carry the order\nfor a requisition. A post of cavalry stationed there will furnish an\nescort. The ladder may be here to-morrow before sunset.\"\n\n\"Very well; that will answer,\" said Gauvain; \"only be quick about it.\nGo!\"\n\nTen minutes later, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ returned, and said to Gauvain,--\n\n\"The messenger has started for Javen\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nGauvain ascended the plateau, and for a long time stood gazing intently\non the bridge-castle across the ravine. The gable of the castle, with\nno other opening than the low entrance closed by the raised drawbridge,\nfaced the escarpment of the ravine. In order to reach the plateau at\nthe foot of the bridge one roust climb down the face of the ravine,\nwhich might be accomplished by clinging to the bushes. But once in the\nmoat, the assailants would be exposed to a shower of missiles from the\nthree stories. Gauvain became convinced that at this stage of the siege\nthe proper way to attack was through the breach of the tower.\n\nHe took every precaution to render flight impossible; he perfected the\nstrict blockade of the Tourgue. Drawing the meshes of his battalions\nmore and more closely, so that nothing could pass between them,\nGauvain and Cimourdain divided the investment of the fortress between\nthem,--the former reserving for himself the forest side, and leaving\nthe plateau to Cimourdain. It was agreed that while Gauvain, aided by\nGu\u00c3\u00a9champ, should conduct the assault through the mine, Cimourdain, with\nall the matches of the upper battery lighted, should watch the bridge\nand the ravine.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nWHAT THE MARQUIS IS DOING.\n\n\nWhile all these preparations for the attack were going on outside, they\nwere also making ready for resistance inside the tower.\n\nA tower may be entered by a mine as a cask is bored by an auger; hence\na tower is sometimes called a _douve_,[4] and it was the fate of the\nTourgue to have its walls pierced by a bung-hole.\n\nThe powerful boring of two or three hundred-weight of powder had driven\na hole through the mighty wall from one side to the other. Beginning at\nthe foot of the tower, it had made a breach in the thickest part of the\nwall, in a sort of shapeless arch in the lower story of the fortress,\nand in order to make this hole more practicable for assault from\nwithout, the besiegers had enlarged it by cannon-shot.\n\nThe ground-floor where this breach had penetrated was a large, empty\nhall of a circular form, with a pillar in the centre, supporting the\nkeystone of the vaulted ceiling. The hall, which was the largest in\nthe keep, was no less than forty feet in diameter. Each story of the\ntower had a similar room, only on a smaller scale, with guards to the\nembrasures of the loop-holes. The hall on the ground-floor had neither\nembrasures, ventilators, nor dormer windows. There was about as much\nair and light in it as in a tomb.\n\nThe door of the oubliettes, the greater part of which was iron, was in\nthe lower hall. Another door opened on a staircase leading to the upper\nrooms. All the staircases were built in the wall itself.\n\nIt was to the lower hall that the besieged had gained access by the\nbreach they had made; but even after gaining possession of it, the\ntower would still remain to be taken.\n\nOne could scarcely breathe in this lower hall, and formerly no one\ncould remain in it twenty-four hours without suffocating; but now,\nthanks to the breach, one could exist there.\n\nFor this reason the besieged had not closed the breach. Besides, what\npurpose would it have served? The guns would have reopened it.\n\nThey had fastened an iron torch-holder into the wall, wherein they set\na torch, and that lighted the lower floor.\n\nBut how were they to defend themselves?\n\nTo stop up the hole would have been easy enough, but useless. A\n_retirade_ would be more effective. A _retirade_ is an intrenchment\nwith a retreating angle,--a kind of barricade composed of rafters,\nby means of which the fire may be concentrated on the assailants,\nand which while leaving the breach open from without closes it\nfrom within. There was no lack of materials, and they proceeded to\nconstruct a barricade of this description with clefts for the passage\nof gun-barrels. The corner of the _retirade_ was supported by the\nmiddle pillar, the two wings touching the walls on either side. Having\ncompleted this they placed _fugades_ in safe places.\n\nThe Marquis directed everything. Inspirer, commander, guide, and\nmaster,--a terrible spirit!\n\nLantenac was one of those soldiers of the eighteenth century who save\ncities at the age of eighty. He resembled the Count d'Alberg, who, when\nalmost a centenarian, drove the King of Poland from Riga.\n\n\"Courage, friends!\" he said; \"in 1713, at the beginning of this\ncentury, Charles XII., shut up in a house at Bender, with three hundred\nSwedes, held his own against twenty thousand Turks.\"\n\nThey barricaded the two lower stories, fortified the chambers,\nconverted the alcoves into battlements, supported the doors with\nbeams driven in by a mallet, thus forming buttresses; but the spiral\nstaircase connecting the different stories they were obliged to leave\nfree, since if they blockaded it against the besieger, their own\npassage would be obstructed. Thus a fortification always has its weak\npoint.\n\nThe Marquis, indefatigable, vigorous as a young man, set example for\nthe others by putting his own hands to the work, raising beams and\ncarrying stones; he gave his orders, helped, fraternized, and laughed\nwith this savage band, yet always remaining their lord and master,\nhaughty even while familiar, elegant although fierce.\n\nHe allowed no one to contradict him. Once he said: \"If half of you were\nto revolt, I would have you shot by the other half, and still defend\nthe place with the rest.\"\n\nThis is the sort of thing for which men worship a commander.\n\n\n[Illustration 095]\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nWHAT THE IM\u00c3\u0082NUS IS DOING.\n\n\nWhile the Marquis occupied himself with the breach and tower, the\nIm\u00c3\u00a2nus attended to the bridge. At the beginning of the siege the\nescape-ladder suspended crosswise below the windows of the second story\nhad been removed by order of the Marquis and placed by the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus in\nthe library. Probably this was the very ladder whose place Gauvain\nwished to supply. The windows of the entresol on the first story,\ncalled the guard-room, were defended by a triple bracing of iron bars\nset in the stones, so that one could neither come nor go that way.\n\nThe library windows, which were high, had no bars.\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus was accompanied by three men as resolute and daring as\nhimself. These men were Hoisnard, called Branche-d'Or, and the two\nbrothers Pique-en-Bois. Taking with him a dark-lantern, he opened\nthe iron door, and made a careful inspection of the three stories\nof the bridge-castle. Hoisnard Branche-d'Or, whose brother had been\nkilled by the Republicans, was as implacable as the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus. The latter\ninvestigated the upper story, filled with hay and straw, as well as the\nlower one, into which he had several _pots-\u00c3\u00a0-feu_ brought, which he\nplaced near the tar-barrels; he ordered bundles of dry heather to be\nso arranged that they would touch the tar-casks, after which he made\nsure that the sulphur-match, one end of which was on the bridge and the\nother in the tower, was in good working order. Over the floor, under\nthe casks and the bundles, he poured a pool of tar into which he dipped\nthe end of the sulphur-match; then he ordered his men to bring into the\nlibrary, between the ground-floor and the attic, with tar beneath and\nstraw overhead, three cradles containing Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, Gros-Alain, and\nGeorgette, who were all sound asleep. The cradles were brought in very\ngently, that the children might not be roused.\n\nThey were simple little village cribs, something like an osier basket,\nwhich when placed on the floor were low enough for a child to climb\nin and out without help. Beside each cradle the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus ordered them\nto place a porringer of soup, together with a wooden spoon. The\nescape-ladder, taken off its hooks, was laid on the floor against the\nwall, and the three cradles were placed end to end along the opposite\nwall, facing the ladder; then, thinking that a current of air might be\nuseful, he flung wide open the six windows of the library. It was a\nwarm and clear summer night.\n\nHe sent the brothers Pique-en-Bois to open the windows in the stories\nabove and below. On the eastern fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the building he had observed\na large ivy, old and withered, about the color of tinder, which\nentirely covered one side of the bridge, framing the windows of the\nthree stories, and thought that this ivy would do no harm. After\nbestowing a last glance on everything, the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus and his men left the\nch\u00c3\u00a2telet and returned into the keep. Double locking the heavy iron\ndoor, he examined attentively this immense and awe-inspiring lock,\nnodded approvingly at the sulphur-match, passed through the hole he\nhad drilled, which was henceforth the only channel of communication\nbetween the tower and the bridge. This match, starting from the round\nroom, passed beneath the iron door and entered under the arch, coiled\nsnake-like over the spiral stairs, crept across the floor of the\ncorridor below, and ended in the pool of tar under the dry heath. The\nIm\u00c3\u00a2nus had calculated that it would take a quarter of an hour from the\ntime this sulphur-match was lighted from the interior of the tower, to\nset on fire the pool of tar under the library. Having completed and\nreviewed all these preparations, he carried the key of the iron door to\nthe Marquis de Lantenac, who put it in his pocket.\n\nEvery movement of the besiegers must be watched; so with his cowherd\nhorn in his belt he stood sentinel in the watch-tower of the platform\non the summit of the tower. While keeping his eye on both the forest\nand the plateau, he had beside him in the embrasure of the watch-tower\na powder-horn, and a canvas bag filled with good-sized balls and old\nnewspapers, which he tore up to make cartridges. When the sun rose, it\nrevealed in the forest eight battalions, with sabres at their sides,\ncartridge-boxes on their backs, and fixed bayonets, ready for the\nassault; on the plateau a battery with caissons, cartridges, and boxes\nof grape-shot; within the fortress nineteen men loading their muskets,\npistols, and blunderbusses, and three children asleep in their cradles.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: A corruption of the word \"patriot.\"--Tr.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Rustics.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Equal to the occasion.]\n\n[Footnote 4: Stave, cask.]\n\n\n[Illustration: The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew. 096]\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nTHE MASSACRE OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n[Illustration 097]\n\n\nThe children awoke.\n\nThe little girl was the first to open her eyes.\n\nThe waking of children is like the opening of flowers; and like the\nflowers, these pure little souls seem to exhale fragrance.\n\nGeorgette, the youngest of the three, who last May was but a nursing\ninfant, and now only twenty months old, lifted her little head, sat up\nin her cradle, looked at her toes, and began her baby-talk.\n\nA ray of light fell upon the crib; it would have been difficult to say\nwhich was the rosier,--Georgette's foot, or the dawn.\n\nThe other two children still slept,--boys always sleep more soundly\nthan girls,--while Georgette, contented and peaceful, began to prattle.\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean's hair was brown, Gros-Alain's auburn, and Georgette's\nblond,--all shades peculiar to their ages, which would change as the\nchildren grew older. Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean looked like an infant Hercules as he\nlay there on his stomach fast asleep, with his two fists in his eyes.\nGros-Alain had thrust his legs outside his little bed.\n\nAll three were in rags. The clothes given them by the battalion of the\nBonnet-Rouge were in tatters; they had not even a shirt between them.\nThe two boys were almost naked, and Georgette was bundled up in a rag\nwhich had formerly been a petticoat, but which now served the purpose\nof a jacket. Who had taken care of these little ones? It would be\nimpossible to tell. Certainly not a mother. Those savage peasants who\nhad carried them along as they fought their way from forest to forest,\ngave them their share of the soup, and nothing more. The little ones\nlived as best they could; they had masters in plenty, but no father.\nYet childhood is enveloped by an atmosphere of enchantment that lends a\ncharm to its very rags; and these three tiny beings were delightful.\n\nGeorgette chattered away.\n\nThe child prattles as the bird sings; but it is always the same\nhymn,--indistinct, inarticulate, and yet full of deep meaning; only the\nchild, unlike the bird, has the dark fate of humanity before it. None\ncan listen to the joyous song of a child without a sense of sadness.\nThe lisping of a human soul from the lips of childhood may well be\ncalled the most sublime of earthly songs. This confused murmuring of\nthought, which is as yet mere instinct, contains an unconscious appeal\nto eternal justice. Perhaps it is a protest uttered on the threshold of\nlife,--an unconscious protest, distressing to hear; ignorance, smiling\non the infinite, seems to make all creation responsible for the fate\nallotted to a weak and defenceless being. Should misfortune befall, it\nwould seem like an abuse of confidence.\n\nThe prattle of a child is more and less than speech; it is a song\nwithout notes, a language without syllables, a murmur that begins in\nheaven but is not to end on earth. As it began before birth, so it\nwill go on after death. As the lispings are the continuance of what\nthe child said when he was an angel, they are likewise a foreshadowing\nof what he will say in eternity. The cradle has its Yesterday, as the\ngrave has its Morrow; and the double mystery of both mingles with this\nunintelligible babble. There is no such proof of God, of eternity, of\nresponsibility, and of the duality of destiny, as is this awe-inspiring\nshadow which we see resting upon a bright young soul.\n\nStill, there was nothing melancholy about Georgette's chatter, for her\nsweet face was wreathed in smiles. Her mouth, her eyes, the dimples in\nher cheeks, all smiled in concert; and by this smile she seemed to show\nher delight in the morning. The human soul believes in sunshine. The\nsky was blue, the weather warm and beautiful; and this frail creature,\nneither knowing nor comprehending the meaning of life,--living in a\ndream, as it were,--felt safe amid the loveliness of Nature, with its\nfriendly trees and its pure verdure, the serene and peaceful landscape,\nwith the noises of birds, springs, insects, and leaves, and above all,\nthe intense purity of the sunshine.\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, the oldest of the children, a boy over four years old, was\nthe next one to wake. He stood up, jumped out of his cradle like a\nlittle man, discovered his porringer, as the most natural thing that\ncould happen, seated himself on the floor, and began to eat his soup.\n\nGeorgette's prattle had not roused Gros-Alain, but at the sound of the\nspoon in the porringer he started and opened his eyes. Gros-Alain was\nthe three-year-old boy. He too saw his bowl, and as it was within reach\nof his arm, he seized it, and without getting out of bed, with his dish\non his knees and his spoon in his fist, he straightway followed the\nexample of Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\n\nGeorgette did not hear them; the modulations of her voice seemed to\nkeep time with the cradling of a dream. Her large eyes, gazing upward,\nwere divine; however gloomy may be the vault over a child's head,\nheaven is always reflected in its eyes.\n\nWhen Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean had finished, he scraped the bottom of the porringer\nwith the spoon, sighed, and remarked with dignity,--\n\n\"I have eaten my soup.\"\n\nThis roused Georgette from her dreaming.\n\n\"Thoup,\" said she.\n\nAnd seeing that Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean had finished his, and that Gros-Alain was\nstill eating, she took the bowl of soup which stood beside her, and\nbegan to eat, carding the spoon quite as often to her ear as she did to\nher mouth.\n\nFrom time to time she renounced civilization and ate with her fingers.\n\nWhen Gros-Alain had scraped the bottom of his porringer he jumped out\nof bed and trotted after his brother.\n\n\nII.\n\nSuddenly from below rang the blast of a clarion, stern and loud, coming\nfrom the direction of the forest, to which a trumpet from the summit of\nthe tower made reply.\n\nThis time the clarion called, and the trumpet answered. And again came\nthe summons from the clarion, followed by the reply of the trumpet.\n\nThen from the edge of the forest rose a voice, distant but clear,\nshouting distinctly,--\n\n\"Brigands, a summons! If by sunset you have not surrendered at\ndiscretion, we shall begin the assault.\"\n\nA voice that sounded like the roar of a wild beast answered from the\ntop of the tower,--\n\n\"Attack.\"\n\nThe voice from below replied,--\n\n\"A cannon will be fired as a last warning half an hour before the\nassault.\"\n\nAnd the voice from above repeated,--\n\n\"Attack.\"\n\nThe children did not hear these voices, but the clarion and the horn\nechoed louder and more distinctly, and at the first sound Georgette\ncraned her neck and ceased eating; she had dropped her spoon into the\nporringer, and at the second blast from the clarion she lifted the tiny\nforefinger of her right hand, and alternately raising and letting it\nfall, she marked the time of the trumpet, that was prolonged by the\nsecond call of the horn; when the horn and the clarion were silent,\nwith her finger still uplifted, she paused dreamily, and then murmured\nto herself, \"Muthic.\"\n\nShe probably meant \"music,\"\n\nThe two older ones, Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean and Gros-Alain, had paid no attention\nto the horn and the clarion; they were absorbed by another object.\nGros-Alain, who had spied a woodlouse in the act of crawling across the\nlibrary floor, exclaimed,--\n\n\"A creature!\"\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean ran up to him.\n\n\"It pricks,\" continued Gros-Alain.\n\n\"Don't hurt it,\" said Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\n\nAnd both the children set themselves to watch the traveller.\n\nMeanwhile Georgette, having finished her soup, was looking about for\nher brothers, who, crouching in the embrasure of a window, hung gravely\nover the woodlouse, their heads so close together that their hair\nintermingled; holding their breath, they gazed in astonishment at the\ncreature, which, far from appreciating so much admiration, had stopped\ncrawling, and no longer attempted to move.\n\nGeorgette, seeing that her brothers were watching something, desired\nto know what it might be. It was no easy matter to reach them,\nbut she undertook it nevertheless. The journey fairly bristled\nwith difficulties; all sorts of things were scattered over the\nfloor,--stools turned upside down, bundles of papers, packing-cases\nwhich had been opened and left empty, trunks, all sorts of\nrubbish,--around which she had to make her way: a very archipelago\nof reefs; but Georgette took the risk. Her first achievement was to\ncrawl out of the crib; then she plunged among the reefs. Winding her\nway through the straits, and pushing aside a footstool, she crawled\nbetween two boxes and over a bundle of papers, climbing up on one\nside, rolling down on the other, innocently exposing her poor little\nnaked body, and finally reached what a sailor would call the open\nsea,--that is to say, quite an expanse of floor unencumbered by rubbish\nand free from perils. Here she made a rush, and with the agility of\na cat she crept across the room on all fours as far as the window,\nwhere she encountered a formidable obstacle in the shape of the long\nladder, which lying against the wall ended at this window, reaching\na little beyond the corner of the embrasure, thus forming a sort of\npromontory between Georgette and her brothers. She paused, and seemed\nto consider the subject; and when she had solved the problem to her\nsatisfaction, she resolutely clasped her rosy fingers about one of the\nrungs, which, as the ladder rested on its side, were not horizontal\nbut vertical, and tried to pull herself up on to her feet; and when,\nafter two unsuccessful attempts, she at last succeeded, she walked\nthe entire length of the ladder, catching one rung after the other.\nOn reaching the end her support failed, she stumbled and fell; but,\nnothing daunted, she caught at the end of one of its enormous poles\nwith her tiny hands, pulled herself up, doubled the promontory, looked\nat Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean and Gros-Alain, and burst out laughing.\n\n\n[Illustration 098]\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n[Illustration 099]\n\nJust then Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, satisfied with the result of his investigations of\nthe woodlouse, raised his head and affirmed,--\n\n\"It is a female.\"\n\nGeorgette's laughter made Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean laugh, and Gros-Alain laughed\nbecause his brother did.\n\nGeorgette having effected her object and joined her brothers, they sat\nround upon the floor as in a sort of diminutive chamber, but their\nfriend the woodlouse had vanished.\n\nIt had taken advantage of Georgette's laughter and hidden itself away\nin a crack.\n\nOther events followed the visit of the woodlouse.\n\nFirst some swallows flew by.\n\nTheir nests were probably under the eaves. They flew quite close to\nthe window, somewhat startled at the sight of the children, describing\ngreat circles in the air, and uttering their sweet spring note. This\nmade the three children look up, and the woodlouse was forgotten.\n\nGeorgette pointed her finger at the swallows, crying,--\n\n\"Biddies!\"\n\n[Illustration 100]\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean reprimanded her,--\n\nI \"You mustn't say 'biddies,' missy; you must say 'birds.'\"\n\n\"'Bir's,'\" said Georgette.\n\nAnd, all three watched the swallows.\n\nThen a bee flew in.\n\nNothing reminds one of the human soul more than the bee, which goes\nfrom flower to flower as a soul from star to star, gathering honey as\nthe soul absorbs the light.\n\nThis one came buzzing in with an air of great stir, as if it said:\n\"Here I am; I have just seen the roses, and now I have come to see the\nchildren. What is going on here, I should like to know?\"\n\nA bee is a housekeeper, scolding as it hums.\n\nAs long as the bee stayed, the children never once moved their eyes\nfrom it.\n\nIt explored the entire library, rummaging in every corner, flying\nabout quite as if it were at home in its hive; winged and melodious,\nit darted from case to case, peering through the glass at the titles\nof the books, just as if it had a brain, and having paid its visit, it\nflew away.\n\n\"It has gone home,\" said Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\n\n\"It is an animal,\" remarked Gros-Alain.\n\n\"No,\" replied Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, \"it is a fly.\"\n\n\"A f'y,'\" said Georgette.\n\nThen Gros-Alain, who had just found a string on the floor with a knot\nin the end, took the other end between his thumb and his forefinger,\nand having made a sort of windmill of the string, he was deeply\nabsorbed in watching its whirling.\n\nGeorgette on her part, having returned to her former character of\nquadruped, and started again on her capricious journeys across\nthe floor, had discovered a venerable arm-chair, with moth-eaten\nupholstery, from which the horse-hair was falling out in several\nplaces. She had stopped before this arm-chair, and was carefully\nenlarging the holes and pulling out the horse-hair.\n\nSuddenly she raised her finger to attract her brothers' attention and\nmake them listen.\n\nThey turned their heads.\n\nA vague far-away sound could be heard outside: probably the attacking\ncamp executing some strategic manoeuvre in the forest; there was\na neighing of horses, a beating of drums, a rolling to and fro of\ncaissons, a clanking of chains, and military calls and responses echoed\non every side,--a confusion of wild sounds, whose combination resulted\nin a sort of harmony; the children listened in delight.\n\n\"It is the good God who does that,\" said Gros-Alain.\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe noise ceased.\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean had fallen into a dream.\n\nHow are ideas formed and scattered in those little minds? What is\nthe mysterious action of those memories, so faint and evanescent?\nIn this dreamy little head there was a confused vision of the good\nGod, of prayer, of clasped hands, of a certain tender smile that had\nonce rested on him, and which now he missed, and Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean whispered\nhalf-aloud, \"Mamma!\"\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Gros-Alain.\n\n\"Mma,\" repeated Georgette.\n\nThereupon Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean began to jump, and Gros-Alain lost no time in\nfollowing his example, imitating all the movements and gestures of his\nbrother; not so Georgette. Three years may copy four, but twenty months\npreserves its independence.\n\nGeorgette remained seated, uttering a word now and then; she had as yet\nachieved no success in sentences.\n\nShe was a thinker, and only uttered monosyllabic apothegms. After a\nfew moments, however, she succumbed to the influence of example, and\nbegan her attempts to imitate her brothers, and these three pairs of\nnaked little feet began to dance, run, and totter about in the dust\nthat covered the old oaken floor, under the serious eyes of the marble\nbusts, towards which Georgette from to time threw an uneasy glance,\nwhispering,--\n\n\"The Momommes!\"\n\nIn the language of Georgette a \"momomme\" was anything that looked like\na man without really being one. Living beings are strangely confused\nwith ghosts in the minds of children.\n\nAs Georgette tottered along after her brothers she was always on the\nverge of descending to all fours.\n\nSuddenly Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, who had gone near the window, raised his head, but\ndropped it the next moment, and ran to hide in a corner formed by\nthe embrasure of the window. He had caught sight of some one looking\nat him. It was one of the Blues, a soldier from the encampment on the\nplateau, who, taking advantage of the armistice and perhaps somewhat\ninfringing thereon, had ventured to the edge of the escarpment from\nwhence he had gained a view of the interior of the library. Seeing\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean hide, Gros-Alain hid also; he cuddled down close by his\nbrother's side, and Georgette hid herself behind them, and there they\nstayed silent and motionless, Georgette laying her finger on her\nlips. After a few moments Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean ventured to put out his head, but\nfinding the soldier still there, he quickly drew it back, and the three\nchildren hardly dared to breathe. This lasted for quite a long time,\nbut finally Georgette grew tired of it; she plucked up the courage to\nlook out, and behold the soldier had gone, and once more they began to\nrun and play.\n\n[Illustration 101]\n\nGros-Alain, although an imitator and admirer of Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, possessed a\ntalent peculiarly his own, that of making discoveries; and his brother\nand sister now beheld him prancing in wild delight, dragging along a\nlittle four-wheeled cart, which he had unexpectedly discovered.\n\nThis doll-carriage had been lying there for years, forgotten in the\ndust, side by side with works of genius and the busts of sages. Perhaps\nGauvain may have played with it when he was a child.\n\nGros-Alain had converted his bit of string into a whip, which he\ncracked with great exultation. Thus it is with discoverers. If one\ncannot discover America, one can at least find a small cart. It\namounts to much the same thing.\n\nBut he must share his treasure; Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean was eager to harness himself\nto the wagon, and Georgette tried to get in and sit down.\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean was the horse, Gros-Alain the coachman.\n\nBut the coachman did not know his business, and the horse felt obliged\nto give him a few lessons.\n\n\"Say, 'Get up!'\" cried Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\n\n\"'Get up!'\" repeated Gros-Alain.\n\nThe carriage upset, and Georgette fell out, whereupon she proceeded to\nmake it known that angels can shriek,--and after that she had half a\nmind to cry.\n\n\"You are too big, missy,\" said Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\n\n\"I big,\" stammered Georgette; and her vanity seemed to console her for\nher fall.\n\nThe cornice under the windows was very wide, and the dust of the fields\nfrom the heath-covered plateau had collected there. After the rains had\nchanged this dust into soil, among the seeds wafted thither by the wind\nwas a bramble, which, making the most of this shallow soil, had taken\nroot therein; it was of the hardy variety known as the fox-blackberry,\nand now in August it was covered with berries, and one of its branches,\npushing its way through the window, hung down almost to the floor.\n\nGros-Alain to the discovery of the string and the cart added that of\nthe blackberry-vine. He went up to it, picked off a berry, and ate it.\n\n\"I am hungry,\" said Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean. And Georgette, galloping on her hands\nand knees, lost no time in making her appearance on the scene.\n\nThe three together soon stripped the branch and devoured all the fruit;\nstaining their faces and hands with the purple juices and laughing\naloud in their glee, these three little seraphs were speedily turned\ninto three little fauns, who would have horrified Dante and charmed\nVirgil.\n\nOccasionally the thorns pricked their fingers. Every pleasure has its\nprice.\n\nPointing to the bush, and holding out her finger, on which stood a tiny\ndrop of blood, Georgette said to Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean,--\n\n\"Prick.\"\n\nGros-Alain, who had also pricked himself, looked suspiciously at the\nbush, and cried out,--\n\n\"It is a beast.\"\n\n\"No, it's a stick,\" replied Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean.\n\n\"Sticks are wicked, then,\" remarked Gros-Alain.\n\nAgain Georgette would have liked to cry, but she decided to laugh.\n\n\n[Illustration 102]\n\n\nV.\n\nMeanwhile Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, jealous perhaps of the discoveries of his younger\nbrother Gros-Alain, had conceived a grand project. For some time past,\nwhile he had been gathering the berries and pricking his fingers, his\neyes had turned frequently towards the reading-desk, which, raised on\na pivot, stood alone like a monument in the middle of the library. On\nthis desk was displayed the famous volume of Saint Bartholomew.\n\nIt was really a magnificent and remarkable quarto. It had been\npublished at Cologne by Bloeuw, or Coesius, as he was called in Latin,\nthe famous publisher of the Bible of 1682. It was printed, not on Dutch\npaper, but on that fine Arabian paper, so much admired by \u00c3\u0089drisi,\nmanufactured from silk and cotton, which always retains its whiteness;\nthe binding was of gilded leather, and the clasps of silver; the\nfly-leaves were of that parchment which the Parisian parchment-sellers\nswore to buy at the hall Saint-Mathurin \"and nowhere else.\" This\nvolume was full of wood-cuts, engravings on copper, and geographical\nmaps of many countries; it contained a preface consisting of a protest\nfrom the printers, paper-manufacturers, and book-sellers against the\nedict of 1635, which imposed a tax on \"leather, beer, cloven-footed\nanimals, sea-fish, and paper,\" and on the back of the frontispiece was\na dedication to the Gryphs, who rank in Lyons with the Elz\u00c3\u00a9virs in\nAmsterdam. And all this had combined to produce a famous copy almost as\nrare as the \"Apostol\" of Moscow.\n\nIt was a beautiful book, and for that reason Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean gazed at\nit--too long, perhaps. The volume lay open just at the large engraving\nwhich represented Saint Bartholomew carrying his skin on his arm.\nThis print could be seen from below, and when the berries were eaten,\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean gazed steadily at it with all his longing and greedy eyes;\nand Georgette, whose eyes had taken the same direction, spied the\nengraving, and exclaimed,--\n\n\"Picsure.\"\n\nThis word seemed to decide Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean. Then to the unbounded surprise of\nGros-Alain a most remarkable proceeding took place.\n\nIn one corner of the library stood a large oaken chair. Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean went\nup to this chair, seized it, and dragged it across the room all alone\nby himself to the desk, then pushing it close up to the latter, he\nclimbed upon it and put both his fists on the book.\n\nHaving reached the height of his ambition, he felt that it behooved\nhim to be generous; so taking the \"picsure\" by the upper corner he\ncarefully tore it in two,--the tear crossing the saint diagonally,\nwhich was a pity; but that was no fault of Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean. The entire left\nside, one eye, and a fragment of the halo of this old apocryphal\nevangelist were left in the book; he offered Georgette the other half\nof the saint and the whole of his skin. Georgette, as she received it,\nremarked,--\n\n\"Momomme.\"\n\n\"Me too!\" cried Gros-Alain.\n\nThe tearing out of the first page is like the first shedding of blood\nin battle; it decides the carnage.\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean turned over the page; next to the saint came the commentator,\nPantoenus; he bestowed Pantoenus upon Gros-Alain.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgette had torn her large piece into two smaller ones,\nand then the two into four; thus it might have been recorded in history\nthat Saint-Bartholomew, after being flayed in Armenia, was quartered in\nBrittany.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe execution finished, Georgette held out her hand to Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean for\nmore.\n\nAfter the saint and his commentator came the frowning portraits of the\nglossarists. First came Gavantus; Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean tore him out and placed him\nin Georgettes hand.\n\nA similar fate befell all the commentators of Saint-Bartholomew.\n\nThe act of giving imparts a sense of superiority. Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean kept\nnothing for himself. He knew that Gros-Alain and Georgette were\nwatching him, and that was enough for him; he was satisfied with the\nadmiration of his audience. Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, inexhaustible in his magnificent\ngenerosity, offered Fabricius and Pignatelli to Gros-Alain, and Father\nStilting to Georgette; Alphonse Tostat to Gros-Alain, _Cornelius a\nLapide_ to Georgette; Gros-Alain had Henry Hammond, and Georgette\nFather Roberti, together with an old view of the city of Douai, where\nthe latter was born in 1619; Gros-Alain received the protest of the\npaper-manufacturers, while Georgette obtained the dedication to the\nGryphs. And then came the maps, which Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean also distributed. He\ngave Ethiopia to Gros-Alain, and Lycaonia to Georgette; after which he\nthrew the book on the floor.\n\nThis was an awful moment. With mingled feelings of ecstasy and awe,\nGros-Alain and Georgette saw Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean frown, stiffen his limbs,\nclench his fists, and push the massive quarto off the desk. It is\nreally quite tragical to see a stably old book treated with such\ndisrespect. The heavy volume, pushed from its resting-place, hung a\nmoment on the edge of the desk, hesitating, as if it were trying to\nkeep its balance; then it fell, crumpled and torn, with disjointed\nclasps and loosened from its binding, all flattened out upon the floor.\nLuckily, it did not fall on the children.\n\nThey were startled, but not crushed. The results of conquest have\nsometimes proved more fatal.\n\nLike all glories, it was accompanied by a loud noise and a cloud of\ndust.\n\nHaving upset the book, Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean now came down from the chair.\n\nFor a moment, silence and dismay prevailed; for victory has its\nterrors. The three children clung to one another's hands and gazed from\na distance upon the ruins of this monstrous volume.\n\nAfter a brief pause, However, Gros-Alain went up to it with an air of\ndetermination and gave it a kick.\n\nThis was quite enough; the appetite for destruction is never sated.\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean gave it a kick too, and Georgette gave it another, which\nlanded her on the floor, but in a sitting position, of which she at\nonce took advantage to throw herself on Saint Bartholomew. All respect\nwas now at an end. Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean and Gros-Alain pounced upon it, jubilant,\nwild with excitement, triumphant, and pitiless, tearing the prints,\nslashing the leaves, tearing out the markers, scratching the binding,\ndetaching the gilded leather, pulling the nails from the silver\ncorners, breaking the parchment, defacing the noble text,--working with\nhands, feet, nails, and teeth; rosy, laughing, and fierce, they fell\nupon the defenceless evangelist like three angels of prey.\n\nThey annihilated Armenia, Judea, and Benevento, where the relics of the\nsaint are to be found; Nathanael, who is supposed by some authorities\nto be the same as Bartholomew; Pope Gelasius, who declared the Gospel\nof Nathanael-Bartholomew apocryphal; and every portrait and map.\nIndeed, they were so utterly engrossed in their pitiless destruction of\nthe old book, that a mouse ran by unobserved.\n\nIt might well be called extermination.\n\nTo cut to pieces history, legend, science, miracles true or false,\necclesiastical Latin, superstition, fanaticism, and mysteries,--thus\nto tear a whole religion to tatters,--might be considered a work of\ntime for three giants. And even for three children it was no small\nmatter; they labored for hours, but at last they conquered, and nothing\nremained of Saint-Bartholomew.\n\nWhen they came to the end, when the last page was detached and the\nlast print thrown on the floor, when all that was left in the skeleton\nbinding were fragments of text and tattered portraits, Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean rose\nto his feet, looked at the floor all strewn with scattered leaves, and\nclapped his hands in triumph.\n\nGros-Alain immediately did the same.\n\nGeorgette rose, picked up a leaf from the floor, leaned against the\nwindow-sill, that was just on a level with her chin, and began to tear\nthe big page into tiny bits and throw them out of the window.\n\nWhen Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean and Gros-Alain saw what she was doing, they were at once\neager to follow her example; and picking up the pages, they tore them\nover and over again, page by page, and threw the fragments outside the\nwindow as she had done. Thus almost the whole of that ancient book,\ntorn by those destructive little fingers, went flying to the winds.\nGeorgette dreamily watched the fluttering groups of tiny white papers\nblown about by every wind, and cried,--\n\n\"Butterflies.\"\n\nAnd here ended the massacre, its last traces vanishing in thin air.\n\n\n[Illustration 103]\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nThus for the second time was Saint Bartholomew put to death,--he who\nhad already suffered martyrdom in the year of our Lord 49.\n\nMeanwhile the evening was drawing on, and as the heat increased a\ncertain drowsiness pervaded the atmosphere. Georgette's eyes were\ngrowing heavy; Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean went to his crib, pulled out the sack of\nstraw that served him for a mattress, dragged it to the window, and\nstretching himself out upon it, said, \"Let us go to bed.\"\n\nGros-Alain leaned his head against Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, Georgette laid hers on\nGros-Alain, and thus the three culprits fell sound asleep.\n\nWarm breezes stole in at the open windows; the scent of wild-flowers\nborne upon the wind from the ravines and hills mingled with the\nbreath of evening; Nature lay calm and sympathetic; radiance, peace,\nand love pervaded the world; the sunlight touched each object with a\nsoft caress; and one felt in every pore of his being the harmony that\nsprings from the profound tenderness of inanimate things. Infinity\nholds within itself the essence of motherhood; creation is a miracle in\nfull bloom, whose magnitude is perfected by its benevolence. One seemed\nto be conscious of an invisible presence exercising its mysterious\ninfluence in the dread conflict between created beings, protecting\nthe helpless against the powerful; beauty meanwhile on every side,\nits splendor only to be equalled by its tenderness. The landscape,\ncalm and peaceful, displayed the enchanting hazy effects of light and\nshade over the fields and river; the smoke rose upwards to the clouds,\nlike reveries melting into dreams; flocks of birds circled above the\nTourgue; the swallows peeped in at the windows, as much as to say,\n\"We have come to see if the children are sleeping comfortably.\" And\npure and lovable they looked as they lay motionless, prettily grouped,\nlike little half-naked Cupids, their united ages amounting to less\nthan nine years. Vague smiles hovered round their lips, reflecting\ndreams of Paradise. Perchance Almighty God was whispering in their\nears, since they were of those whom all human tongues unite to call\nthe weak and the blessed. Theirs was the innocence that commands\nveneration. All was silent, as if the breath that stirred those tender\nbosoms were the business of the universe, and all creation paused to\nlisten; not a leaf rustled, not a blade of grass quivered. It seemed\nas if the wide starry universe held its breath lest these three lowly\nbut angelic slumberers should be disturbed; and nothing could be more\nsublime than the impressive reverence of Nature in the presence of this\ninsignificance.\n\nThe declining sun had nearly reached the horizon, when suddenly, amid\nthis profound peace, lightning flashed from the forest, followed by a\nsavage report. A cannon had just been fired. The echoes seized this\nsound, and magnified it to a dreadful din, and so frightful was the\nprolonged reverberation from hill to hill that it roused Georgette.\n\nShe raised her head a little, lifted her finger, listened, then said,--\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nThe noise ceased, and silence returned again. Georgette put her head\nback on Gros-Alain, and fell asleep again.\n\n\n[Illustration 104]\n\n[Illustration: The Mother 105]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER.\n\n\n[Illustration 106]\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nDEATH PASSES.\n\n\nThat evening the mother, whom we have seen wandering onward with no\nsettled plan, had walked all day long. This was, to be sure, a matter\nof every-day occurrence. She kept on her way without pause or rest; for\nthe sleep of exhaustion in some chance corner could no more be called\nrest than could the stray crumbs that she picked up here and there like\nthe birds be considered nourishment. She ate and slept just enough to\nkeep her alive.\n\nShe had spent the previous night in a forsaken barn,--a wreck such as\ncivil wars leave behind them. In a deserted field she had found four\nwalls, an open door, a little straw, and the remains of a roof, and on\nthis straw beneath the roof she threw herself down, feeling the rats\nglide under as she lay there, and watching the stars rise through the\nroof. She slept several hours; then waking in the middle of the night,\nshe resumed her journey, so as to get over as much ground as possible\nbefore the excessive heat of the day came on. For the summer pedestrian\nmidnight is more favorable than noon.\n\nShe followed as best she could the brief directions given her by the\nVautortes peasant, and kept as far as possible toward the west. Had\nthere been any one near, he might have heard her incessantly muttering\nhalf aloud, \"La Tourgue.\" She seemed to know no other word, save the\nnames of her children.\n\nAnd as she walked she dreamed. She thought of the adventures that had\nbefallen her, of all she had suffered and endured, of the encounters,\nthe indignities, the conditions imposed, the bargains offered and\naccepted, now for a shelter, now for a bit of bread, or simply to\nbe directed on her way. A wretched woman is more unfortunate than a\nwretched man, inasmuch as she is the instrument of pleasure. Terrible\nindeed was this wandering journey! But all this would count for nothing\nif she could but find her children.\n\nOn that day her first adventure was in a village through which her\nroute lay; the dawn was barely breaking, and the dusk of night still\nshrouded all the surrounding objects; but in the principal village\nstreet a few doors were half open, and curious faces peeped out of\nthe windows. The inhabitants seemed restless like a startled hive of\nbees,--a disturbance due to the noise of wheels and the clanking of\niron, which had reached their ears.\n\nOn the square in front of the church, a frightened group was staring at\nsome object that was descending the hill towards the village. It was\na four-wheeled wagon drawn by five horses, whose harness was composed\nof chains, and upon which could be seen something that looked like a\npile of long joists, in the middle of which lay an object whose vague\noutlines were hidden by a large canvas resembling a pall. Ten horsemen\nrode in front of the wagon, and ten behind. They wore three-cornered\nhats, and above their shoulders rose what seemed like the points of\nnaked sabres. The whole procession advanced slowly, its dark outlines\nsharply defined against the horizon; everything looked black,--the\nwagon, the harness, and the riders. On entering the village they\napproached the square with the pale glimmer of the dawn behind them.\n\nIt had grown somewhat lighter while the wagon was descending the hill,\nand now the escort was plainly to be seen,--a procession of ghosts to\nail intents, for no man uttered a word.\n\nThe horsemen were gendarmes; they really were carrying drawn sabres,\nand the canvas that covered the wagon was black.\n\nThe wretched wandering mother, entering the village from the opposite\ndirection, just as the wagon and the gendarmes reached the square,\napproached the crowd of peasants and heard voices whispering the\nfollowing questions and answers,--\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"It's the guillotine.\"\n\n\"Where does it come from?\"\n\n\"From Foug\u00c3\u00a8res.\"\n\n\"Where is it going?\"\n\n\"I don't know. They say it is going to some castle near Parign\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Parign\u00c3\u00a9!\"\n\n\"Let it go wherever it will, so that it does not stop here.\"\n\nThere was something ghostlike in the combination of this great wagon\nwith its shrouded burden, the gendarmes, the clanking chains of the\nteam, and the silent men, in the early dawn.\n\nThe group crossed the square and passed out from the village, which lay\nin a hollow between two hills. In a quarter of an hour the peasants who\nhad stood there like men petrified saw the funereal procession reappear\non the summit of the western hill. The great wheels jolted in the ruts,\nthe chains of the harness rattled as they were shaken by the early\nmorning wind, the sabres shone; the sun was rising, and at a bend of\nthe road all vanished from the sight.\n\nIt was at this very moment that Georgette woke up in the library beside\nher still sleeping brothers, and wished her rosy feet good-morning.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nDEATH SPEAKS.\n\n\nThe mother had watched this dark object as it passed by, but she\nneither understood nor tried to understand it, absorbed as she was in\nthe vision that pictured her children lost in the darkness.\n\nShe too left the village soon after the procession which had just\npassed, and followed the same road at some distance behind the second\nsquad of gendarmes. Suddenly the word \"guillotine\" came back to her,\nand she repeated it to herself; now, this untaught peasant woman,\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard, had no idea of its meaning, but her instinct warned\nher; she shuddered involuntarily, and it seemed dreadful to her to be\nwalking behind it,--so she turned to the left, quitting the highway,\nand entered a wood, which was the Forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res.\n\nAfter roaming about for some time she spied a belfry and the roofs of\nhouses,--evidently a village on the edge of the forest; and she went\ntowards it, for she was hungry.\n\nIt was one of those hamlets where the Republicans had established a\nmilitary outpost.\n\nShe went as far as the square in front of the mayoralty-house.\n\nHere, too, there was agitation and anxiety. A crowd had gathered in\nfront of the flight of steps leading to the hall, and here, standing on\none of these steps was a man accompanied by soldiers, who held in his\nhand a large unfolded placard. A drummer stood on his right, and on his\nleft a bill-sticker, with his brush and paste-pot. Upon the balcony,\nover the door, stood the mayor, wearing a tricolored scarf over his\npeasant's dress.\n\n[Illustration 107]\n\nThe man with the placard was a public crier.\n\nHe wore a shoulder-belt from which hung a small wallet, in token\nthat he was going from village to village proclaiming certain news\nthroughout the district.\n\nJust as Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard arrived, he had unfolded the placard and was\nbeginning to read in a loud voice,--\n\n      \"THE FRENCH REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE.\"\n\nThe drum beat. There was a stir in the crowd. A few took off their\ncaps, others jammed their hats more firmly on their heads; in those\ntimes one could almost recognize a man's political views, throughout\nthat district, by the fashion of his head-gear; hats were worn by\nRoyalists, caps by Republicans. The confused murmur of voices ceased,\nand all listened as the crier proceeded to read:--\n\n      \"By virtue of the orders given to as, and of the authority\n      vested in us by the Committee of Public Safety,--\"\n\nAgain the drum beat, and again the crier continued:--\n\n      \"--and in execution of the decree of the National\n      Convention, that outlaws all rebels taken with arms in\n      their hands, and declares that capital punishment shall be\n      inflicted on any man who harbors them or aids and abets in\n      their escape,--\"\n\nOne peasant whispered to his neighbor,--\n\n\"What does capital punishment mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" the neighbor replied.\n\nThe crier waved the placard:--\n\n      \"--in accordance with Article 17 of the law of the 30th of\n      April, that gives to the delegates and sub-delegates full\n      authority over the rebels,--\"\n\nHere he made a pause, then resumed:--\n\n      \"--the individuals designated under the following names\n      and surnames are declared outlawed:--\"\n\nThe audience listened with a close attention.\n\nThe voice of the crier sounded like thunder:--\n\n      \"--Lantenac, brigand,--\"\n\n\"That's Monseigneur,\" muttered a peasant.\n\nAnd the whisper ran through the crowd, \"It's Monseigneur.\"\n\nAnd the crier pursued,--\n\n      \"--Lantenac, ci-devant Marquis, brigand; the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus,\n      brigand;--\"\n\nTwo peasants looked askance at each other.\n\n\"That's Gouge-le-Bruant.\"\n\n\"Yes; that's Brise-Bleu.\"\n\nThe crier went on reading the list:--\n\n      \"Grand-Francoeur, brigand;--\"\n\nA murmur-ran through the crowd.\n\n\"He's a priest.\"\n\n\"Yes,--the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Turmeau.\"\n\n\"I know; he is a cur\u00c3\u00a9 somewhere near the forest of La Chapelle.\"\n\n\"And a brigand,\" added a man in a cap.\n\nThe crier went on:--\n\n      \"--Boisnouveau, brigand; the two brothers Pique-en-bois,\n      brigands; Houzard, brigand;--\"\n\n\"That's Monsieur de Qu\u00c3\u00a9len,\" said a peasant.\n\n      \"--Panier, brigand;--\"\n\n\"That's Monsieur Sepher.\"\n\n      \"--Place-Nette, brigand;--\"\n\n\"That's Monsieur Jamois.\"\n\nPaying no heed to these remarks, the crier continued:--\n\n\n      \"--Guinoiseau, brigand; Chatenay, called Robi, brigand;--\"\n\nOne peasant whispered, \"Guinoiseau is the same person we call Le Blond;\nChatenay comes from Saint-Ouen.\"\n\n      \"--Hoisnard, brigand;--\" continued the crier.\n\n\"He is from Ruill\u00c3\u00a9,\" some one in the crowd was heard to say.\n\n\"Yes, that's Branche-d'Or.\"\n\n\"His brother was killed at the attack of Pontorson.\"\n\n\"Yes, Hoisnard-Malonni\u00c3\u00a8re.\"\n\n\"A fine-looking fellow of nineteen.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" called out the crier; \"here is the end of the list:--\n\n      \"--Belle-Vigne, brigand; La Musette, brigand; Sabre-tout,\n      brigand; Brin-d'Amour, brigand;--\"\n\nHere a lad jogged the elbow of a young girl; she smiled.\n\nThe crier continued,--\n\n      \"--Chante-en-hiver, brigand; Le Chat, brigand--\"\n\n\"That's Moulard,\" said a peasant.\n\n      \"--Tabouze, brigand.--\"\n\n\"That's Gauffre,\" said another.\n\n\"There are two of the Gauffres,\" added some woman.\n\n\"Good fellows, both of them,\" muttered a lad.\n\nThe crier waved the placard, the drum beat to command silence, and then\nhe resumed the reading:\n\n      \"--And the above-named, wheresoever they may be taken, as\n      soon as their identity is proved, will be put to death\n      upon the spot;--\"\n\nThere was a movement in the crowd.\n\nThe crier pursued,--\n\n      \"--and any man who protects them, or aids them to escape,\n      will be brought before a court-martial and forthwith put\n      to death.

They are signed by the chief of the exploring column of\nthe C\u00c3\u00b4tes-du-Nord, Commander Gauvain.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" cried voices in the crowd.\n\nThe crier read,--\n\n      \"Under penalty of death,--\"\n\nAll were silent.\n\n      \"--it is forbidden, in pursuance with the above, to lend\n      aid or succor to the nineteen rebels herein named, who are\n      at present shut up and besieged in the Tourgue.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried a voice.\n\nIt was a woman's voice,--the voice of the mother.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nMUTTERINGS AMONG THE PEASANTS.\n\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard had mingled with the crowd. She had not listened,\nbut some things one may hear without listening. She had heard the word\n\"Tourgue,\" and raised her head.\n\n\"What's that? Did he say La Tourgue?\"\n\nPeople looked at her. The ragged woman seemed like one dazed.\n\nVoices were heard to murmur, \"She looks like a brigand.\"\n\nA peasant woman, carrying a basket of buckwheat cakes, went up to her\nand whispered,--\n\n\"Keep still.\"\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard stared stupidly; again she had lost all power\nof comprehension. That name, \"La Tourgue\" passed like a flash of\nlightning, and night closed once more. Had she no right to ask for\ninformation? What made the people look at her so strangely?\n\nMeanwhile the drum had beaten for the last time, the bill-poster pasted\nup the notice, the mayor went back into the house, the crier started\nfor some other village, and the crowd dispensed.\n\nOne group was still standing in front of the notice. Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard\ndrew near.\n\nThey were commenting on the names of the outlaws.\n\nBoth peasants and townsmen were there; that is to say, both Whites and\nBlues.\n\n\"After all, they have not caught everybody,\" said a peasant. \"Nineteen\nis just nineteen, and no more. They have not got Riou, nor Benjamin\nMoulins, nor Goupil from the parish of Andouill\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"Nor Lorieul, of Monjean,\" remarked another.\n\nAnd thus they went on:--\n\n\"Nor Brice-Denys.\"\n\n\"Nor Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Dudouet.\"\n\n\"Yes, they have the one from Laval.\"\n\n\"Nor Huet, from Launey-Villiers.\"\n\n\"Nor Gr\u00c3\u00a9gis.\"\n\n\"Nor Pilon.\"\n\n\"Nor Filleul.\"\n\n\"Nor M\u00c3\u00a9nicent.\"\n\n\"Nor Gu\u00c3\u00a9harr\u00c3\u00a9e.\"\n\n\"Nor the three brothers Logerais.\"\n\n\"Nor Monsieur Lechandellier de Pierreville.\"\n\n\"Idiots!\" exclaimed a stern-looking, white-haired man. \"They have them\nall, if they have Lantenac.\"\n\n\"They have not got him yet,\" muttered one of the young fellows.\n\n\"Lantenac once captured, the soul is gone. The death of Lantenac means\ndeath to the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Who is this Lantenac?\" asked a townsman.\n\n\"He is a ci-devant,\" replied another.\n\nAnd another added,--\n\n\"He is one of those who shoot women.\"\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard heard this, and said,--\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\nWhen people turned to look at her she added,--\n\n\"Because he shot me.\"\n\nIt was an odd thing to say; as if a living woman were to call herself\ndead. People looked at her suspiciously.\n\nAnd truly she was a startling object, trembling at every sound,\nwild-looking, shivering, with an animal-like fear; so terrified was she\nthat she frightened other people. There is a certain weakness in the\ndespair of a woman that is dreadful to witness. It is like looking upon\na being against whom destiny has done its worst. But peasants are not\nanalytical; they see nothing below the surface. One of them muttered,\n\"She might be a spy.\"\n\n\"Keep still and go away,\" whispered the kind-hearted woman who had\nspoken to her before.\n\n\"I am doing no harm,\" replied Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard; \"I am only looking for\nmy children.\"\n\nThe kind woman winked at those who were starring at Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard,\nand touching her forehead with her finger, said,--\n\n\"She is a simpleton.\"\n\nThen drawing her aside, she gave her a buckwheat cake.\n\nWithout even stopping to thank her, Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard began to devour\nthe cake like one ravenous for food.\n\n\"You see, she eats just like an animal: she must be a simpleton;\" and\none by one the crowd gradually dispersed.\n\nAfter she had eaten, Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard said to the peasant woman,--\n\n\"Well, I have finished my cake; now, where is the Tourgue?\"\n\n\"There she is at it again!\" cried the peasant woman.\n\n\"I must go the Tourgue. Show me the road to La Tourgue.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried the peasant woman. \"You would like to be killed, I\nsuppose; but whether you would or not, I don't know the way myself. You\nmust surely be insane. Listen to me, my poor woman. You look tired;\nwill you come to my house and rest?\"\n\n\"I never test,\" replied the mother.\n\n\"And her feet are all torn,\" muttered the peasant woman.\n\n\"Didn't you hear me telling you that my children were stolen from me,\none little girl and two little boys? I came from the _carnichot_ in the\nforest. You can ask Tellmarch le Caimand about me, and also the man I\nmet in the field down yonder. The Caimand cared me. It seems I had\nsomething broken. All those things really happened. Besides, there is\nSergeant Radoub; you may ask him; he will tell you, for it was he who\nmet us in the forest. Three,--I tell you there were three children,\nand the oldest one's name was Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean: I can prove it to you; and\nGros-Alain and Georgette were the two others. My husband is dead; they\nkilled him. He was a farmer at Siscoignard. You look like a kind woman.\nShow me the way. I am not mad, I am a mother. I have lost my children,\nand am looking for them. I do not know exactly where I came from. I\nslept last night on the straw in a barn. I am going to the Tourgue.\nI am not a thief. You can't help seeing that I am telling you the\ntruth. You ought to help me to find my children. I don't belong to this\nneighborhood. I have been shot, but I do not know where it happened.\"\n\nThe peasant woman shook her head, saying,--\n\n\"Listen, traveller; in times of revolution you must not say things that\ncannot be understood, for you might be arrested.\"\n\n\"But the Tourgue,\" cried the mother; \"madam, for the love of the Infant\nJesus and of the Blessed Virgin in Paradise I pray you, I beg of you, I\nbeseech you, madam, tell me how I can find the road to the Tourgue!\"\n\nThen the peasant woman grew angry.\n\n\"I don't know! And if I did, I would not tell you! It is a bad place.\nPeople don't go there.\"\n\n\"But I am going there,\" said the mother.\n\nAnd once more she started on her way.\n\nThe woman, as she watched her depart, muttered to herself:--\n\n\"She must have something to eat, whatever she does;\" and running after\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard, she put a dark-looking cake in her hand, saying,--\n\n\"There is something for your supper.\"\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard took the buckwheat-cake, but she neither turned nor\nmade reply as she pursued her way.\n\nShe went forth from the village, and just as she reached the last\nhouses she met three little ragged and barefooted children trotting\nalong. She went up to them and said,--\n\n\"Here are two boys and a girl;\" and when she saw them looking at her\nbread, she gave it to them.\n\nThe children took the bread, but they were evidently frightened.\n\nShe entered the forest.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nA MISTAKE.\n\n\nMeanwhile, on this very day, before dawn, amid the dim shadows of the\nforest, the following scene took place on the bit of road that leads\nfrom Javen\u00c3\u00a9 to L\u00c3\u00a9cousse.\n\nAll the roads of the Bocage are shut in between high banks, and those\nenclosing the one that runs from Javen\u00c3\u00a9 to Parign\u00c3\u00a9 by way of L\u00c3\u00a9cousse\nare even higher than usual; indeed the road, winding as it does, might\nwell be called a ravine. It leads from Vitr\u00c3\u00a9, and has had the honor of\njolting Madame de S\u00c3\u00a9vign\u00c3\u00a9's carriage. Shut in as it is by hedges on the\nright and on the left, no better spot for an ambush could well be found.\n\nThat morning, one hour before Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard, starting from a\ndifferent part of the forest, had reached the first village, where she\nbeheld the funereal apparition of the wagon escorted by the gendarmes,\na crowd of unseen men, concealed by the branches, crouched in the\nthickets through which the road from Javen\u00c3\u00a9 runs after it crosses the\nbridge over the Couesnon. They were, peasants dressed in coats of skin,\nsuch as were worn by the kings of Brittany in the sixteenth century\nand by the peasants in the eighteenth. Some were armed with muskets,\nothers with axes. Those who had axes had just built in a glade a kind\nof funeral pile of dry fagots and logs, which was only waiting to be\nset on fire. Those who had muskets were posted on both sides of the\nroad, in the attitude of expectancy. Could one have seen through the\nleaves, he might have discovered on every side fingers resting on\ntriggers and guns aimed through the openings made by the interlacing of\nthe branches. These men were lying in wait. All the muskets converged\ntowards the road, which had begun to whiten in the rising dawn.\n\nAmid this twilight low voices were carrying on a dialogue:--\n\n\"Are you sure of this?\"\n\n\"Well, that's what they say.\"\n\n\"She is about to go by?\"\n\n\"They say she is in this neighborhood.\"\n\n\"She must not leave it.\"\n\n\"She must be burned.\"\n\n\"We three villages have come out for that very purpose.\"\n\n\"And how about the escort?\"\n\n\"It is to be killed.\"\n\n\"But will she come by this road?\"\n\n\"So they say.\"\n\n\"Then she is coming from Vitr\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't she?\"\n\n\"Because they said she was coming from Foug\u00c3\u00a8res.\"\n\n\"Whether she comes from Foug\u00c3\u00a8res or from Vitr\u00c3\u00a9, she certainly comes\nfrom the devil.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"And she must go back to him.\"\n\n\"I agree to that.\"\n\n\"Then she is going to Parign\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"So it seems.\"\n\n\"She will not get there.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\"\n\n\"Attention!\"\n\nIt was the part of prudence to be silent now, since it was growing\nquite light.\n\nSuddenly these men lurking in ambush held their breath, as they heard\nthe sound of wheels and horses' feet. Peering through the branches,\nthey caught an indistinct glimpse of a long wagon, a mounted escort,\nand something on the top of the wagon, all of which was coming towards\nthem along the hollow road.\n\n\"There she is,\" cried the one who appeared to be the leader.\n\n\"Yes, and the escort too,\" said one of the men who lay in wait.\n\n\"How many are there?\"\n\n\"Twelve.\"\n\n\"It was said that there were to be twenty.\"\n\n\"Twelve or twenty, let us kill them all.\"\n\n\"Wait till they are within our reach.\"\n\n[Illustration 108]\n\nA little later and the wagon with its escort appeared at a turn of the\nroad.\n\n\"Long live the King!\" cried the peasant leader; and as he spoke,\na hundred muskets were fired at the same instant. When the smoke\nscattered, the escort was scattered likewise. Seven horsemen had\nfallen, and the other five had made their escape. The peasants rushed\nto the wagon. \"Hallo! this is not the guillotine,\" cried the leader;\n\"it's a ladder.\"\n\nIn fact, there was nothing whatever in the wagon but a long ladder.\n\nThe two wounded horses had fallen, and the driver had been killed by\naccident.\n\n\"There is something suspicious about a ladder with an escort, all the\nsame,\" said the leader. \"It was going in the direction of Parign\u00c3\u00a9. No\ndoubt it was intended for scaling the Tourgue.\"\n\n\"Let us burn the ladder,\" cried the peasants.\n\nAs to the funereal wagon for which they were watching, it had taken\nanother road, and was already two miles farther away, in the village\nwhere Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard had seen it pass at sunrise.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nVOX IN DESERTO.\n\n\nAfter leaving the three children to whom she had given her bread,\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard started at random through the woods.\n\nSince no one would show her the way, she must find it without help.\nFrom time to time she paused, and sat down to rest; then up and away\nagain. She was overcome by that intense weariness which one feels first\nin the muscles, then in the bones,--like the fatigue of a slave. And\na slave indeed she was,--the slave of her lost children. They must be\nfound; each passing moment might be fatal to them. A duty like this\ndebars one from the right to breathe freely; yet she was very weary.\nWhen one has reached this stage of fatigue it becomes a question\nwhether another step can be taken. Could she do it? She had been\nwalking since morning without finding either a village or a house. When\nshe first started she had followed the right path, but soon wandered\ninto the wrong one, and at last quite lost her way among the thick\nbranches, where one tree looked just like another. Was she drawing\nnear her goal? Were her sufferings almost over? She was following the\nway of the Cross, and felt all the languor and exhaustion of the final\nstation. Was she doomed to fall dead on the road? At one time it seemed\nto her impossible to take another step: the sun was low, the forest\ndark, the paths no longer visible in the grass, and God only knew what\nwas to become of her. She began to call, but there was no reply.\n\nLooking around, she perceived an opening among the branches, and no\nsooner had she started in that direction than she found herself out of\nthe wood.\n\nBefore her lay a valley no wider than a trench, across whose stony\nbottom flowed a slender stream of clear water. Then she realized that\nshe was excessively thirsty, and approaching it knelt to drink; and\nwhile thus kneeling she thought she would say her prayers.\n\nWhen she rose she tried to get her bearings, and crossed the brook.\n\nAs far as the eye could reach on the farther side of the little valley\nstretched a limitless plain overgrown with a stubbly underbrush, which\nrose from the brook like an inclined plane, occupying the entire\nhorizon. If the forest were a solitude, this plateau might be called\na desert. In the forest there was a chance that one might encounter\na human being behind any bush; but across the plateau not an object\ncould be descried within reach of human vision. A few birds were flying\nacross the heather, as if making an effort to escape.\n\nThen, in the presence of this utter desolation, feeling her knees\ngive way beneath her, the poor bewildered mother cried out amid the\nsolitude, like one suddenly gone mad,--\n\n\"Is there no one here?\"\n\nShe paused for an answer, and the answer came.\n\nA deep and muffled voice burst forth from the distant horizon, caught\nand repeated by echo upon echo. It was like a thunderbolt; but it might\nhave been the firing of a cannon, or a voice answering the mother's\nquestion, and replying, \"Yes.\"\n\nThen silence reigned once more.\n\nThe mother rose with renewed energy. She felt reassured by a sense of\ncompanionship. Having quenched her thirst and said her prayers, her\nstrength returned, and she began to climb the plateau in the direction\nfrom whence the voice of distant thunder had reached her ears. Suddenly\nshe caught sight of a lofty tower looming up against the far-away\nhorizon. It stood alone amid this wild landscape, and a ray of the\nsetting sun cast a crimson glow across it. It was more than a league\naway. Beyond it stretched the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, its vast expanse of\nverdure half hidden by the mist.\n\nCould it have been this tower that made the noise?--for it seemed to\nher to stand on the very spot whence came the thundering sound that had\nrung in her ears like a call.\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard had now reached the summit of the plateau, and the\nplain alone lay before her.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nTHE SITUATION.\n\n\nThe moment had finally come when Cimourdain held Lantenac in his grasp.\nThe inexorable had conquered the pitiless. The old rebel Royalist\nwas caught in his own lair, with no possible chance of escape; and\nCimourdain had determined to behead the Marquis in the home of his\nancestors, on his own estate, upon his very hearthstone, so to speak,\nthat the feudal mansion might look upon the downfall of its feudal\nlord, and thus present an example not soon to be forgotten.\n\nFor this reason he sent to Foug\u00c3\u00a8res for the guillotine, which we saw on\nits way.\n\nTo kill Lantenac was to kill the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e; the death of the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e meant\nsafety for France. Cimourdain was a man utterly calm in the performance\nof duty, however ferocious it might be, and not for a moment did he\nhesitate.\n\n[Illustration 109]\n\nIn regard to the ruin of the Marquis he felt quite at ease; but he had\nanother cause for anxiety. The struggle would no doubt be a fearful\none; Gauvain would direct the assault, and perhaps take part in it.\nThis young chief had all the fire of a soldier; he was the very man\nto throw himself headlong into this hand-to-hand encounter. And what\nif he were killed,--Gauvain, his child, the only being on earth whom\nhe loved! Gauvain had been fortunate thus far; but fortune sometimes\ngrows weary. Cimourdain trembled. Strange enough was his destiny, thus\nplaced between these two Gauvains, longing for the death of the one,\nand praying for the life of the other.\n\nThe cannon that had started Georgette in her cradle and summoned the\nmother from the depths of the woods, did more than that. Whether by\naccident or intentionally on the part of the man who pointed the\ngun, the ball, though intended only as a warning, struck, broke, and\npartly wrenched away the iron bars that defended and closed the great\nloop-hole on the first floor of the tower, and the besieged had had no\ntime to repair this damage.\n\nThe truth was that, in spite of their loud boasting, their ammunition\nwas nearly exhausted; and their situation, let it be remembered, was\nmore critical than the besiegers suspected. Their dream had been to\nblow up the Tourgue when the enemy was once fairly within the walls;\nbut their store of powder was running low,--not more than thirty\nrounds left for each man. They had plenty of muskets, blunderbusses,\nand pistols, but few cartridges. All the guns were loaded, that they\nmight keep up a steady fire. But how long could this last? To keep\nup the firing and economize their resources at one and the same time\nwould be a somewhat difficult combination. Fortunately (a gloomy kind\nof fortune) it would be for the most part a hand-to-hand encounter,\nin which the cold steel of sabre and dagger would take the place of\nfirearms. They would have a chance to hack the enemy in pieces, and\ntherein lay their chief hope.\n\nThe interior of the tower seemed impregnable. In the low hall where\nthe breach had been made the entrance was defended by that barricade\nso skilfully constructed by Lantenac, called that _retirade._ Behind\nit stood a long table covered with loaded weapons, blunderbusses,\ncarbines, muskets, sabres, hatchets, and daggers. Having been unable\nto make use of the oubliette prison communicating with the lower hall,\nfor the purpose of blowing up the tower, the Marquis had ordered the\ndoor of this dungeon to be closed. Above the hall was the round chamber\nof the first story, which could only be reached by a very narrow\nspiral staircase. This room, provided like the lower hall with a table\ncovered with weapons ready for use, was lighted by the wide embrasure\nwhose grating had just been crushed by a cannon-ball. Below this room\nthe spiral staircase led to the round chamber on the second story,\nfrom which the iron door opened into the bridge-castle. This room on\nthe second floor was called indiscriminately \"the room with the iron\ndoor,\" or \"the mirror room\", on account of the numerous little mirrors\nhung from rusty old nails against the naked stone walls,--an odd\nmedley of elegance and barbarism. As there were no means by which the\nupper rooms could be successfully defended, this mirror-room was what\nManesson-Mallet, the authority on fortifications, calls \"the last post\nwhere the besieged may capitulate.\" The object was, as we have already\nstated, to prevent the besiegers from reaching it.\n\nThis round chamber on the second floor was lighted by embrasures,\nbut a torch was burning there also. This torch, stuck in an iron\ntorch-holder, like the one in the lower hall, had been lighted by the\nIm\u00c3\u00a2nus and placed quite near the end of the sulphur-match. Appalling\nsolicitude.\n\nAt the end of the hall, on a long board raised on trestles, food had\nbeen placed as in a Homeric cavern; great dishes of rice, a porridge of\nsome kind of dark grain, hashed veal, a boiled pudding made of flour\nand fruit, and jugs of cider. Whoever wished to eat and drink could do\nso.\n\nThe cannon had set them all on the alert, and now they had but half an\nhour of repose before them.\n\nFrom the top of the tower the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus kept watch of the enemy's\napproach. Lantenac had given orders that the besiegers should be\nallowed to advance unmolested.\n\n\"They are four thousand five hundred,\" he said; \"it would be useless to\nkill them outside. Wait till they are within the walls, where we shall\nbe equal to them.\" And he added, laughing, \"Equality, Fraternity.\"\n\nIt had been agreed that when the enemy began to advance, the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus\nshould give warning on his horn.\n\nPosted behind the _retirade_ and on the steps of the staircase, they\nwaited in silence, with a musket in one hand and a rosary in the other.\n\nThe situation might be summed up as follows:--\n\nOn one side of the besiegers a breach to scale, a barricade to carry,\nthree rooms in succession, one above the other, to be taken by main\nforce, two spiral staircases to be climbed, step by step, under a\nshower of bullets; the besieged meanwhile standing face to face with\ndeath.\n\n\n[Illustration 110]\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nPRELIMINARIES.\n\n\n[Illustration 111]\n\n\nGauvain on his side was preparing for the attack. He had given his last\ninstructions to Cimourdain, who, it will be remembered, was to guard\nthe plateau, taking no part in the action, as well as to Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, who\nwith the main body of the army was to be stationed in the forest camp.\nIt was agreed that neither the lower battery of the wood nor the higher\none of the plateau was to fire, unless a sortie or an attempt to escape\nwere made. Gauvain reserved for himself the command of the storming\ncolumn, and this it was that troubled Cimourdain.\n\nThe sun had just set.\n\nA tower in the open country is like a ship in mid-ocean, and must be\nattacked in the same way. It is more like boarding than assaulting.\nCannon is of no avail, for of what use would it be to cannonade walls\nfifteen feet thick? A port-hole through which men struggle to force\na way, while others defend the entrance with axes, knives, pistols,\nfists, and teeth,--this was the kind of combat that might be expected,\nand Gauvain knew that by no other means could the Tourgue be taken.\nNothing can be more deadly than an attack where the combatants can look\ninto one another's eyes. He was familiar with the formidable interior\nof the tower, having lived there as a child.\n\nHe stood wrapped in deep thought.\n\nA few paces from him, his lieutenant, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, with a spy-glass in his\nhand, was scanning the horizon in the direction of Parign\u00c3\u00a9. Suddenly he\ncried,--\n\n\"Ah! At last!\"\n\nThis exclamation roused Gauvain from his reverie.\n\n\"What is it, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ?\"\n\n\"The ladder is coming, commander.\"\n\n\"The escape-ladder?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that it has not arrived till now?\"\n\n\"No, commander; and I felt anxious about it. The courier whom I sent to\nJaven\u00c3\u00a9 returned.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that.\"\n\n\"He reported that he had found in a carpenter-shop at Javen\u00c3\u00a9 a ladder\nof the required dimensions, that he had taken possession of it, and\nhaving had it put on a wagon, demanded an escort of twelve horsemen;\nthat he had waited to see them set out for Parign\u00c3\u00a9,--the wagon, the\nescort, and the ladder,--and had then started for home at full speed.\"\n\n\"And reported the same to us, adding that the team was a good one and\nhad started about two o'clock in the morning, and would therefore be\nhere before sunset. Yes, I know all that. What else?\"\n\n\"Well, commander, the sun has just set and the wagon that is to bring\nthe ladder has not yet arrived.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? But we must begin the attack. The hour has come. If we\nare late, the besieged will think that we have retreated.\"\n\n\"We can attack, commander.\"\n\n\"But we must have the escape-ladder.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"But we have not got it\"\n\n\"Yes, we have.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"That's what made me say, 'Ah! at last!' As the wagon had not arrived,\nI took my spy-glass and have been watching the road from Parign\u00c3\u00a9 to the\nTourgue, and now I am content; for the wagon and the escort are yonder\ndescending the hill. You can see them.\"\n\nGauvain took the spy-glass and looked.\n\n\"Yes, there it is. It is hardly light enough to see it all distinctly,\nbut I can distinguish the escort; it is certainly that. Only it seems\nto me larger than you said, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ?\"\n\n\"Yes, it does.\"\n\n\"They are about a quarter of a league distant.\"\n\n\"The escape-ladder will be here in a quarter of an hour, commander.\"\n\n\"Then we can attack.\"\n\nIt was indeed a wagon approaching, but not the one they supposed it to\nbe.\n\nAs he turned, Gauvain saw behind him Sergeant Radoub standing with\ndowncast eyes, in the attitude of military salute.\n\n\"What is it, Sergeant Radoub?\"\n\n\"Citizen commander, we, the men of the battalion of the Bonnet-Rouge,\nhave a favor to ask of you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"To be killed.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Gauvain.\n\n\"Will you grant us this favor?\"\n\n\"Well, that depends,\" said Gauvain.\n\n\"It is just this, commander. Since the affair at Dol, you have been too\ncareful of us. There are twelve of us still.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It humiliates us.\"\n\n\"You are the reserved force.\"\n\n\"We would rather be in the vanguard.\"\n\n\"I need you to insure success at the close of the engagement. That is\nwhy I keep you back.\"\n\n\"There is too much of this keeping back.\"\n\n\"It is all the same. You are in the column. You march.\"\n\n\"In the rear. Paris has a right to march at the head.\"\n\n\"I will consider the matter, Sergeant Radoub.\"\n\n\"Consider it to-day, commander. The occasion is at hand. Hard knocks\nwill be given on both sides; it will be lively work. He who lays a\nfinger on the Tourgue will get himself burned; we request the favor of\nbeing in the thick of it.\"\n\nThe sergeant paused, twisted his moustache, and continued in a changed\nvoice:--\n\n\"And then you know, commander, our little ones are in this tower.\nOur children are there,--the children of the battalion, our three\nchildren. That abominable wretch Brise-Bleu, called the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, that\nGouge-le-Bruand, Bouge-le-Gruand, Fouge-le-Truand, that thundering\ndevil of a man, threatens our children,--our children, our puppets,\ncommander! No harm must come to them, whatever convulsion shakes the\nTourgue. Do you understand that, commander? We will not endure it.\nJust now I took advantage of the truce, and climbing up the plateau, I\nlooked at them through the window. Yes, they are certainly there,--you\ncan see them from the edge of the ravine; I saw them, and frightened\nthe darlings. Commander, if a single hair falls from the heads of\nthose little cherubs,--I swear it by the thousand names of all that is\nsacred,--I, Sergeant Radoub, will demand an account of God Almighty!\nAnd this is what the battalion says: we want the babies to be saved,\nor else we all want to be killed. We have a right to ask it. Yes,\nthat every man of us be killed! And now I salute you, and present my\nrespects.\"\n\nGauvain held out his hand to Radoub as he exclaimed:--\n\n\"You are brave fellows! You will join the attacking column. I shall\ndivide you into two parties; six of you I shall place in the vanguard\nto insure the advance, and six in the rear-guard to prevent a retreat.\"\n\n\"And am I still to command the twelve?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Thank you, commander. In that case, I join the vanguard.\"\n\nRadoub made the military salute, and returned to the ranks. Gauvain\ndrew out his watch, whispered a few words to Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, and the\nattacking column began to form.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nTHE SPEECH AND THE ROAR.\n\n\n[Illustration 112]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Cimourdain who had not yet taken his position on the\nplateau, and who stood beside Gauvain, approached a trumpeter.\n\n\"Sound the trumpet!\" he said to him.\n\nThe clarion sounded, the horn replied.\n\nAgain the clarion and the trumpet exchanged calls.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Gauvain of Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ. \"What does Cimourdain\nwant?\"\n\nCimourdain, with a white handkerchief in his hand, approached the\ntower; and as he drew near, he cried aloud,--\n\n\"You men in the tower, do you know me?\"\n\nAnd the voice of the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus made answer from the heights,--\n\n\"We do.\"\n\nThese two voices were now heard exchanging question and reply as\nfollows:--\n\n\"I am the ambassador of the Republic,'\n\n\"You are the former cur\u00c3\u00a9 of Parign\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"I am a delegate of the Committee of Public Safety.\"\n\n\"You are a priest.\"\n\n\"I am a representative of the law.\"\n\n\"You are a renegade.\"\n\n\"I am a commissioner of the Revolution.\"\n\n\"You are an apostate.\"\n\n\"I am Cimourdain.\"\n\n\"You are a demon.\"\n\n\"Do you know me?\"\n\n\"We abominate you.\"\n\n\"Would you like to have me in your power?\"\n\n\"There are eighteen of us here who would give our heads to have yours.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I have come to give myself up to you.\"\n\nA burst of savage laughter rang out from the top of the tower, with the\nderisive cry,--\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nA deep silence of expectancy reigned in the camp.\n\nCimourdain continued,--\n\n\"On one condition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"You hate me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And I love you; I am your brother.\"\n\nThe voice from above replied,--\n\n\"Yes--our brother Cain.\"\n\nCimourdain went on, with a peculiar inflection of voice,--soft, but\npenetrating:--\n\n\"Insult me, if you will, but listen to my words. I come here protected\nby a flag of truce. Poor misguided men, you are in very truth my\nbrothers, and I am your friend. I am the light, trying to illumine your\nignorance. Light is the essence of brotherhood. Moreover, have we not\nall one common mother,--our native land? Then listen to me. Sooner or\nlater, you--or at least your children or grandchildren--will know that\nevery event of this present time is the result of the higher law, and\nthat this revolution is the work of God himself. But while we wait for\nthe time when, to the inner sense of every man, even unto yours, all\nthese things will be made plain, and when all fanaticisms, including\nour own, will vanish before the powerful light that is to dawn, is\nthere none to take pity on your ignorance? Behold, I come to you, and I\noffer you my head; more than this, I hold out my hand. I beg of you to\ntake my life and spare your own. All power is vested in me, and what I\npromise I can fulfil. I make one final effort in this decisive moment.\nHe who speaks to you is both citizen and priest. The citizen contends\nwith you, but the priest implores you. I beseech you to hear me. Many\namong you have wives and children. It is in their behalf that I entreat\nyou. Oh, my brothers--\"\n\n\"Go on with your preaching!\" sneered the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\nCimourdain continued:--\n\n\"My brethren, avert this fatal hour. There will be frightful slaughter\nhere. Many of us who stand before you will not see to-morrow's sun;\nyes, many indeed will perish, and you,--you will all die. Have mercy on\nyourselves. Why shed all this blood to no avail? Why kill so many men\nwhen two would suffice?\"\n\n\"Two?\" asked the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\n\"Yes, two.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Lantenac and myself.\"\n\nHere Cimourdain raised his voice.\n\n\"We are the two men whose deaths would be most pleasing to our\nrespective parties. This is my offer; accept it and you are saved. Give\nLantenac to us and take me in his place; he will be guillotined, and\nwith me you may do what you will.\"\n\n\"Priest,\" howled the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, \"if we but had you, we would roast you\nover a slow fire.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Cimourdain; and he went on:--\n\n[Illustration 113]\n\n\"You, the condemned who are in this tower, in one hour may all be safe\nand free. I offer you salvation. Will you accept?\"\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus burst out:--\n\n\"You are a fool as well as a villain. Why do you interfere with us? Who\ninvited you to come here with your speeches? You expect us to deliver\nup Monseigneur, do you? What do you want to do with him?\"\n\n\"I want his head, and I offer you--\"\n\n\"Your skin, for we would flay you like a dog, cur\u00c3\u00a9; but no, your skin\nis not worth his head. Begone!\"\n\n\"The slaughter will be terrible. Once more I beseech you to reflect.\"\n\nNight had come on during the progress of this gloomy conference,\nwhich had been heard both within and without the tower. The Marquis\nde Lantenac listened in silence, letting the affair take its course;\nleaders sometimes exhibit this self-absorbed indifference, as a kind of\nprerogative of responsibility.\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus raised his voice above that of Cimourdain, exclaiming:--\n\n\"You men who are about to attack us, we have declared our intentions.\nYou have heard our offers; we shall make no change in them, and woe be\nunto you if you refuse them. But if you consent, we will give you back\nthe three children whom we now hold, on condition that each one of us\nis allowed to depart in safety.\"\n\n\"You may all go free, save one,\" replied Cimourdain.\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Lantenac.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur! Deliver Monseigneur! Never!\"\n\n\"We must have Lantenac.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"We can treat with you on no other condition.\"\n\n\"Then you had better begin the attack.\"\n\nSilence ensued.\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus having given the signal on his horn, came down, the Marquis\ngrasped his sword, the nineteen besieged silently gathered in the lower\nhall behind the _retirade_, and fell upon their knees; they heard the\nmeasured tread of the attacking column as it advanced towards the\ntower, drawing nearer and nearer in the darkness, until suddenly the\nsound was close upon them, at the very mouth of the breach. Then every\nman knelt and adjusted his musket or blunderbuss in an opening of\nthe retirade, while one of their number, Grand-Francoeur, the former\npriest Turmeau, rose, and holding in his right hand a drawn sabre, and\nin his left a crucifix, solemnly uttered the blessing.\n\n\"In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost!\"\n\nAll fired at once, and the conflict began.\n\n\n[Illustration 114]\n\n\n[Illustration 115]\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nTITANS AGAINST GIANTS.\n\n\n[Illustration 116]\n\n\nIt was indeed a fearful scene.\n\nThis hand-to-hand struggle surpassed all conception.\n\nTo find its parallel one must have recourse to the great duels of\n\u00c3\u0086schylus, or to the butcheries of old feudal times; to those \"attacks\nwith short arms\" that continued in vogue until the seventeenth century,\nwhen men penetrated into fortified places by way of concealed breaches;\ntragic assaults, where, says an old sergeant of the province of\nAlentejo, \"the mines having done their work, the besiegers will now\nadvance, carrying boards covered with sheets of tin, armed with round\nshields and bucklers, and supplied with an abundance of grenades; and\nas they force those who hold the intrenchments and _retirades_ to\ngive way, they will take possession of them, vigorously expelling the\nbesieged.\"\n\nThe scene of the attack was terrible; it was one of those breaches\ntechnically termed \"a covered breach,\" and was, it must be remembered,\nnot a wide breach opened to daylight, but a mere crack, traversing the\nwall from side to side. The powder had worked like an auger. The effect\nof the explosion had been so tremendous that the tower was cracked for\nmore than forty feet above the chamber of the mine; but it was only a\nfissure, and the practicable rent that served as a breach and afforded\nan entrance into the lower hall, had the effect of having been pierced\nby the thrust of a lance rather than cleft by a blow from an axe.\n\nIt was a puncture in the side of the tower, a long, deep cut, not\nunlike a well, horizontal with the ground, a narrow passage twisting\nand turning like an intestine through a wall fifteen feet thick, a\nshapeless cylinder, abounding in obstacles, pitfalls, and all the\nd\u00c3\u00a9bris of past explosions, where a man, blinded by the darkness and\nstumbling over the rubbish beneath his feet, would surely dash his head\nagainst the granite rock.\n\nBefore the assailants yawned this black portal, like a cavernous mouth,\nwhose upper and lower jaws, closely set with jagged rocks, rivalled\na shark's mouth in the number of its teeth. This cavity was the only\nmeans of entrance or exit, and while the grape-shot was raining\nwithin, on the other side--that is to say, in the lower hall of the\nground-floor--rose the _retirade._\n\nThe ferocity of the encounter can only be compared with the encounters\nof sappers in underground passages when a counter-mine has just cut\nacross a mine, or with the cutlass butcheries that take place when in\na naval battle a man-of-war is boarded. Fighting in the depths of a\ngrave reaches the very climax of all that is dreadful. The fact that\na ceiling is overhead seems to increase the horror of human slaughter.\nJust as the first of the assailants came surging in, the _retirade_ was\nwrapped in a sheet of lightning, and it seemed like the bursting of a\nsubterranean thunder-clap, report answering report as the besiegers\nreturned the thunder of the ambuscade. Above the uproar rose the voice\nof Gauvain, shouting, \"Break them in!\" then Lantenac's cry, \"Stand\nfirm against the enemy!\" then the cry of the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, \"Stand by me, men\nof Maine!\" then the clang of sabres clashing one against the other,\nand terrible discharges following in swift succession, dealing death\non every hand. The torch fastened to the wall but dimly lighted this\nscene of horror. A lurid glare enveloped all objects, amid which\nnothing could be clearly distinguished; and those who entered were\nstraightway struck deaf and blind,--deafened by the uproar, blinded by\nthe smoke. The disabled lay here and there among the rubbish; while the\ncombatants trampled upon the corpses, crushing the wounds and bruising\nthe broken limbs of the injured men, who groaned aloud in their wild\nagony, and sometimes set their teeth in the feet of those who were\ntorturing them. Now and then a silence more appalling than sound would\nsettle over all. Men seized each other by the throat, and then were\nheard fierce pantings, followed by gnashings of teeth, death-rattles\nand imprecations, and directly all the din returned again. A stream\nof blood flowed through the breach in the tower, and spreading in the\ngloom, formed a dark, smoking pool outside upon the grass.\n\n[Illustration 117]\n\nOne might have said that the tower herself was bleeding like a wounded\ngiantess.\n\nSurprising to relate, all this tumult was hardly audible on the\noutside. The night was very dark, and around the besieged fortress\nan almost funereal sense of peace rested on forest and plain. Hell\nwas within, a sepulchre without. This life-and-death struggle in the\ndarkness, these volleys of musketry, this clamor and fury,--all this\ntumult and confusion was subdued by the massive walls and arches. There\nwas not air enough for reverberation, and a sense of suffocation was\nadded to the carnage. Outside the tower the noise was scarcely audible;\nand meanwhile the three little children still slumbered.\n\nThe fury of the combat deepened; the _retirade_ held its own.\n\nThere is nothing more difficult to force than this kind of barricade,\nwith a re-entering angle. If the besieged were at a disadvantage in\nnumbers, their position was in their favor. The attacking column had\nsuffered serious loss of men. Formed in a long line outside the tower,\nit gradually worked its way through the breach, shortening as it\ndisappeared, like a snake twisting itself into its hole.\n\nGauvain, with the rashness peculiar to a youthful leader, was in the\nlower hall, in the thickest of the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e, with the bullets flying in\nall directions. Let us add, however, that he felt all the confidence of\na man who had never been wounded.\n\nAs he turned to give an order, the flash from a volley of musketry\nlighted up a face close beside him.\n\n\"Cimourdain!\" he-cried, \"why are you here?\"\n\n\"I came to be near you,\" replied the man, who was indeed Cimourdain.\n\n\"But you will be killed.\"\n\n\"What of that? Are you not in the same danger?\"\n\n\"But I am needed here, and you are not.\"\n\n\"Since you are here, my place is by your side.\"\n\n\"No, my master.\"\n\n\"Yes, my child.\"\n\nAnd Cimourdain remained near Gauvain.\n\nThe dead lay in heaps on the pavement of the lower hall. Although the\n_retirade_ had not as yet been carried, the majority would sooner or\nlater gain the day. The assailants, it is true, were not protected,\nwhile the assailed were under cover; and ten of the besiegers fell to\none of the besieged; but the latter were constantly replaced.\n\nIn proportion as the besieged diminished the besiegers increased.\n\nThe nineteen besieged were collected behind the _retirade_, since that\nwas the centre of attack; and among them were their dead and wounded;\nnot more than fifteen of them were in fighting condition. One of the\nfiercest, Chante-en-hiver, had been fright-fully mutilated. He was a\nthick-set Breton, with curling hair, and short of stature, but full\nof life and energy. Although his jaw was broken and one of his eyes\nblown out, he could still walk, and he dragged himself up the winding\nstaircase into the room on the first story, hoping there to be able to\nsay his prayers and die.\n\nHe leaned against the wall near the loop-hole trying to get a breath of\nair.\n\nThe butchery down below in front of the _retirade_ had grown more\nand more horrible. Once when there was a pause between two volleys\nCimourdain raised his voice.\n\n\"Besieged,\" he cried, \"why continue this bloodshed? You are conquered.\nSurrender! Remember we are four thousand five hundred against nineteen,\nwhich is over two hundred to one. Surrender!\"\n\n\"Let us put an end to that idle babble,\" replied the Marquis de\nLantenac.\n\nAnd twenty balls responded to Cimourdain's appeal.\n\nThe _retirade_ did not reach as high as the vaulted ceiling, thus\nthe besieged were enabled to fire over it; but at the same time it\npresented to the besiegers an opportunity for an escalade.\n\n\"An assault on the _retirade_!\" cried Gauvain. \"Is there a man among\nyou who will volunteer to scale it?\"\n\n\"I,\" replied Sergeant Radoub.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nRADOUB.\n\n\nA sudden stupor fell upon the assailants. Radoub had been the sixth to\nenter the breach at the head of the attacking column, and of these six\nmen of the Parisian battalion four had already fallen. After uttering\nthe exclamation \"I,\" he was seen to draw back instead of advancing, and\nbending over, in a crouching attitude, he crawled between the legs of\nthe combatants, until, reaching the opening of the breach, he rushed\nout. Was this flight? Was it possible for such a man to flee? What\ncould it mean?\n\nHaving escaped from the breach, Radoub, still blinded by the smoke,\nrubbed his eyes, as though to dispel the horror and gloom of the night,\nand by the faint glimmer of the stars began to scrutinize the wall of\nthe tower. He nodded with an air of satisfaction, as much as to say,\n\"So I was not mistaken.\"\n\nRadoub had noticed that the deep fissure caused by the explosion of\nthe mine extended from the breach to that loop-hole on the first story\nwhose iron grating had been shattered and partially torn off by a\ncannon-ball, and thus hanging, the network of broken bars left just\nroom enough for a man to pass through,--provided he could climb up to\nit; and that was the question. Possibly it might be done by following\nthe crack, supposing the man to be a cat; and Radoub was precisely like\na cat. He was of the race which Pindar calls \"the agile athletes.\"\nAlthough a man may be an old soldier, it by no means follows that he is\nno longer young. Radoub, who had been in the French Guards, was not yet\nforty years of age, and he was as active as Hercules.\n\nLaying his musket on the ground, he removed his shoulder-belt, threw\noff his coat and waistcoat, keeping only his two pistols, which he\nstuck in the belt of his trousers, and his drawn sabre, which he held\nbetween his teeth. The butts of his pistols projected from above his\nbelt.\n\nThus burdened by no unnecessary weight, and followed in the darkness\nby the eyes of all those of the attacking column who had not as yet\nentered the breach, he began the ascent, climbing the stones of the\ncracked wall as though they had been the steps of a staircase. It was\nan advantage to him that he wore no shoes; there is nothing like a\nnaked foot for clinging, and he twisted his toes into the holes between\nthe stones. While hoisting himself by means of his fists, he used his\nknees for support. It was a hard pull, not unlike climbing up the teeth\nof a saw. \"Luckily,\" he thought to himself, \"there is no one in the\nroom on the first story; for if there were, I should never have been\nallowed to climb up in this way.\"\n\nHe had about forty feet to climb after this fashion, and, as he\nadvanced, somewhat inconvenienced by the projecting butts of his\npistols, the crack grew narrower and the ascent more and more\ndifficult. The increasing depth of the precipice beneath his feet added\nconstantly to the danger of a fall; but at last he reached the edge of\nthe loop-hole, and on pushing aside the twisted and broken grating he\nfound that he had ample room to pass through. Then raising himself by a\npowerful effort, he braced his knees against the cornices of the ledge,\ncaught hold of a fragment of the grating on either hand, and holding\nhis sabre between his teeth, he drew himself up as high as his waist\nin front of the embrasure of the loop-hole; there, with his entire\nweight resting on his two fists, he hung suspended over the abyss.\n\nNow, with a single bound, he had but to leap into the hall of the first\nstory.\n\nSuddenly he beheld in the gloom a horrible object; a face appeared in\nthe embrasure, like a bleeding mask with its jaw crushed and one eye\ntorn out, and this one-eyed mask was gazing steadily at him.\n\nThe two hands belonging to this mask were seen to reach forth from the\ndarkness in the direction of Radoub; one of them instantly caught the\npistols from his belt, and the other pulled the sabre from his teeth,\nand thus Radoub was disarmed.\n\nHe felt his knee slipping from the sloping cornice, the grasp of his\nhands on fragments of the grating barely sufficed to support him, while\nbehind him yawned an abyss of forty feet.\n\n[Illustration 118]\n\nThat mask and those hands belonged to Chante-en-hiver.\n\nSuffocated by the smoke that rose from below, Chante-en-hiver had made\nhis way into the embrasure of this loop-hole, where the out-door air\nhad revived him, the freshness of the night had checked the bleeding of\nhis wounds, and he had begun to feel somewhat stronger, when suddenly\nin the opening before him appeared the form of Radoub; then, while the\nlatter hung there, clinging with both hands to the railing, with no\nchoice but to drop or suffer himself to be disarmed, Chante-en-hiver,\nwith an awful calmness, snatched the two pistols from big belt and the\nsabre from his teeth.\n\nWhereupon ensued a duel between the unarmed and the wounded,--a duel\nwithout a parallel.\n\nThere could be no doubt that the dying man would come off victorious;\none shot would be enough to hurl Radoub into the yawning gulf below.\n\nLuckily for Radoub, Chante-en-hiver, in consequence of holding the two\npistols in one hand, was unable to fire either, and was forced to use\nthe sabre, with which he gave Radoub a thrust in the shoulder,--a blow\nwhich wounded him and at the same time saved his life.\n\nAlthough unarmed, Radoub, in full possession of his strength and\nheedless of his injury, which was simply a flesh-wound, suddenly swung\nhimself forward, and releasing his hold on the bars, leaped into the\nembrasure, where he found himself face to face with Chante-en-hiver,\nwho had thrown the sabre behind him, as he knelt clutching a pistol in\neither hand.\n\nAs he took aim at Radoub, the muzzle of his pistol was so close as\nnearly to touch him; but his enfeebled arm trembled, and a minute\npassed before he could fire.\n\nRadoub availed himself of this respite to burst out laughing.\n\n\"Look here, you hideous object!\" he cried, \"do you think you can\nfrighten me with your jaw like beef _\u00c3\u00a0 la mode?_ Sapristi! how they\nhave spoiled your face for you.\"\n\nChante-en-hiver was aiming at him.\n\n\"I suppose it is rather rude to say so,\" continued Radoub, \"but the\ngrape-shot has made a pretty ragged piece of work of your head.\nBellona spoiled your beauty, my poor fellow. Come, come, spit out your\nlittle pistol-shot, my friend.\"\n\nThe pistol went off, and the ball, grazing Radoub's head, tore away\nhalf his ear. Chante-en-hiver, still grasping the second pistol, raised\nhis other arm, but Radoub gave him no time to take aim.\n\n\"It's quite enough to lose one ear,\" he cried. \"You have wounded me\ntwice, and now my turn has come.\"\n\nThrowing himself on Chante-en-hiver, he gave his arm so powerful a blow\nthat the pistol went off in the air; then seizing him by his wounded\njaw, he twisted it until Chante-en-hiver uttered a howl of agony and\nfainted.\n\nRadoub stepped over his prostrate form and left him lying in the\nembrasure.\n\n\"Now that I have made known to you my ultimatum, don't you dare to\nstir,\" he said. \"Lie there, base reptile that you are! You may be very\nsure that I shall not amuse myself at present by killing you. Crawl\nat your leisure over the ground, under my feet You will have to die,\nanyhow. And then you will find out what nonsense your cur\u00c3\u00a9 has been\ntelling you. Away with you into the great mystery, peasant!\"\n\nAnd he sprang into the hall of the lower story.\n\n\"One can't see his hand before him,\" he grumbled.\n\nChante-en-hiver was convulsively writhing and moaning in his agony.\nRadoub looked back.\n\n\"Silence! Will you please to keep still, citizen without knowing it? I\nhave nothing more to do with you; for I should scorn to put an end to\nyour life. Now, leave me in peace.\"\n\nAnd as he stood watching Chante-en-hiver, he plunged his hands\nrestlessly into his hair.\n\n\"What am I to do? This is all very well, but here I am disarmed. I\nhad two shots to fire, and you have wasted them, animal that you are.\nAnd besides, the smoke is so thick that it makes my eyes water;\" and\naccidentally touching his tom ear, he cried out with pain.\n\n\"You have not gained much by getting my ear,\" he continued; \"in fact,\nI would rather lose that than any other member; it's only an ornament,\nany way. You have scratched my shoulder, too, but that's of no\nconsequence. You may die in peace, rustic; I forgive you.\"\n\nHe listened. The noise in the lower hall was frightful. The fight was\nraging more wildly than ever.\n\n\"Things are progressing downstairs. Hear them yelling 'Long live the\nKing!' It must be acknowledged that they die nobly.\"\n\nHe stumbled over his sabre that lay on the floor, and as he picked it\nup, he said to Chante-en-hiver, who had ceased to moan, and who might\nvery possibly be dead:--\n\n\"You see, man of the woods, my sabre is not of the slightest use for\nwhat I intended to do. However, I take it as a keepsake from you. But I\nneeded my pistols. Devil take you, savage! What am I to do here? I am\nof no use at all.\"\n\nAs he advanced into the hall, tiding to see where he was and to get\nhis bearings, he suddenly discovered in the shadow behind the central\npillar a long table, and upon this table something faintly gleaming. He\nfelt of the objects. They were muskets, pistols, and carbines, a whole\nrow of fire-arms arranged in order and apparently only waiting for\nhands to seize them. This was the reserve prepared by the besieged for\nthe second stage of the assault; indeed, it was a complete arsenal.\n\n\"This is a treasure indeed!\" exclaimed Radoub; and half dazed with joy\nhe flung himself upon them.\n\n[Illustration 119]\n\nThen it was that he became formidable.\n\nNear the table covered with fire-arms could be seen the wide-open door\nof the staircase leading to the upper and lower stories. Radoub dropped\nhis sabre, seized a double-barrelled pistol in each hand, and instantly\nfired at random through the door leading to the spiral staircase; then\nhe grasped a blunderbuss, firing that also, and directly afterwards a\ngun loaded with buckshot, whose fifteen balls made as much noise as a\nvolley of grape-shot. After which, pausing to take breath, he shouted\nin thundering tones down the staircase, \"Long live Paris!\"\n\nSeizing another blunderbuss bigger than the first he aimed it towards\nthe vault of the winding staircase and paused again.\n\nThe uproar that ensued in the lower hall baffles description.\nResistance is shattered by such unlooked for surprises.\n\nTwo of the balls of Radoub's triple discharge had taken effect, killing\nthe older of the brothers Pique-en-bois and Houzard, who was M. de\nQu\u00c3\u00a9len.\n\n\"They are upstairs,\" cried the Marquis.\n\nAt this exclamation; the men determined to abandon the _retirade_ and\nno flock of birds could have surpassed the rapidity of their flight, as\nthey rushed pell-mell towards the staircase, the Marquis urging them\nonward.\n\n\"Make haste!\" he cried; \"now we must show our courage by flight. Let us\nall go up to the second floor and there begin anew!\"\n\nHe himself was the last man to leave the _retirade_, and to this act of\nbravery he owed his life.\n\nRadoub, with his finger on the trigger, was concealed on the first\nlanding of the staircase, watching the rout. The first men who appeared\nat the turn of the staircase received the discharge full in their faces\nand fell, and if the Marquis had been among them he would have been a\ndead man. Before Radoub had time to seize another weapon they had all\npassed, and the Marquis, moving more deliberately than the others,\nbrought up the rear. Supposing as they did that the room on the first\nstory was filled with the besiegers, they never paused until they\nreached the mirror room on the second story,--the room with the iron\ndoor and the sulphur match, where they must either capitulate or die.\n\nGauvain, quite as much surprised as any one of the besieged at the\nsound of the shots from the staircase, and having no idea of the source\nof this unexpected assistance, but availing himself of it without\ntrying to understand, had leaped over the _retirade_, followed by his\nmen, and, sword in hand, had driven the fugitives to the first story.\nThere he found Radoub, who, with a military salute, said to him,--\n\n\"One moment, commander. It was I who did that. I had not forgotten Dol,\nso I followed your example, and took the enemy between two fires.\"\n\n\"You are a clever scholar,\" replied Gauvain with a smile.\n\nOne's eyes, like those of night birds, grow accustomed to a dim light\nafter a certain time, and Gauvain discovered that Radoub was covered\nwith blood.\n\n\"But you are wounded, comrade!\"\n\n\"Oh, that is nothing, commander. What is an ear more or less? I got\na sabre-thrust, too, but I don't mind it. When one breaks a pane of\nglass, of course one gets a few cuts; it is only a question of a little\nblood.\"\n\nIn the room in the first story conquered by Radoub the men halted. A\nlantern was brought, and Cimourdain rejoined Gauvain; whereupon they\nboth took counsel together, and well they might. The besiegers were\nnot in the confidence of the besieged; they had no means of knowing\ntheir scarcity of ammunition nor their want of powder; the second story\nwas their very last intrenchment, and the assailants thought it not\nunlikely that the staircase might be mined.\n\nOne thing was certain,--the enemy could not escape. Those who were not\nkilled, were like men locked in a prison. Lantenac was caught in the\ntrap.\n\nResting upon this assurance, they felt that it would be well to devote\na short time to considering the matter of bringing the affair to a\ncrisis. Many of their men had already been killed. They must take\nmeasures to prevent too great a loss of life in the final assault.\n\nThere would be serious danger in this last attack. At the first onset\nthey would no doubt find themselves exposed to a heavy fire.\n\nHostilities had ceased. The besiegers in possession of the ground-floor\nand the first story waited for orders from their chief to renew the\nfight. While Gauvain and Cimourdain held counsel together, Radoub\nlistened in silence to their deliberations.\n\nAt last he timidly ventured another military salute.\n\n\"Commander!\"\n\n\"What is it, Radoub?\"\n\n\"Have I earned a small reward?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Ask what you will.\"\n\n\"Then I ask to be the first one to go up.\"\n\nIt was impossible to refuse him; besides, he would have gone without\npermission.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nTHE DESPERATE.\n\n\nWhile these deliberations were in progress on the first floor, a\nbarricade was going up overhead. If success inspires fury, defeat fills\nmen with rage. The two stories were about to clash in wild frenzy.\nThere is a sense of intoxication in the assurance of victory. The\nassailants below were buoyed up by hope, that most powerful incentive\nto human effort when it is not counteracted by despair. All the\ndespair was above,--calm, cold, and gloomy despair. When they reached\nthis hall of refuge, their last resource, they proceeded first of\nall to bar the entrance, and in order to accomplish this object they\ndecided that the blockading of the staircase would be more effectual\nthan barring the door. Under such circumstances an obstacle through\nwhich one can both see what is going on and fight at the same time is a\nbetter defence than a closed door.\n\nAll the light they had, came from the torch which Im\u00c3\u00a2nus had stuck in\nthe holder on the wall near the sulphur match.\n\nOne of those great heavy oaken chests such as formerly served the\npurpose of holding clothing and linen, before the invention of chests\nof drawers, stood in the hall, and this trunk they dragged out, and set\nup on end in the doorway of the staircase.\n\nIt fitted so closely into the space that it blocked up the entrance,\nleaving just room enough for the passage of a single man, thus\naffording them an excellent chance to kill their assailants one by one.\nIt seemed somewhat doubtful whether any of them would attempt to enter.\n\nMeanwhile, the obstructed entrance gave them a respite, during which\nthey counted the men.\n\nOf the original nineteen, but seven remained, including the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus; and\nhe and the Marquis were the only ones who had not been wounded.\n\nThe five wounded men, who were still active,--for in the excitement of\nbattle no man would succumb to anything less than a mortal wound,---\nwere Chatenay, called Robi, Guinoiseau, Hoisnard, Branche-d'Or,\nBrin-d'Amour, and Grand-Francoeur. All the others were dead.\n\nTheir ammunition was exhausted, and their cartridge-boxes were empty.\nOn counting the cartridges, they found that there were just four rounds\napiece among the seven men.\n\nDeath was now their only resource. Behind them yawned the dreadful\nprecipice. They could hardly have been nearer to the edge.\n\nMeanwhile, the attack had just begun again,--slowly, it is true, but\nnone the less determined. As the assailants advanced, they could hear\nthe butt-end of their muskets strike on each stair by way of testing\nits security.\n\nAll means of escape were cut off. By way of the library? Six guns stood\non the plateau, with matches lighted. Through the rooms overhead? To\nwhat avail? Opening on to the platform as they did, they simply offered\nan opportunity to hurl themselves from the summit of the tower into the\ndepths below.\n\nAnd now the seven survivors of this epic band realized the hopelessness\nof their position; within that solid wall, which, though protecting for\nthe moment, would in the end betray, they were practically prisoners,\nalthough not as yet really captured.\n\nThe voice of the Marquis broke the silence.\n\n\"My friends, all is over,\" he said.\n\nThen, after a pause, he added,--\n\n\"Grand-Francoeur will for the time being resume the duties of the Abb\u00c3\u00a9\nTurmeau.\"\n\nAll knelt, rosary in hand. The sounds of the butt-ends of the\nbesiegers' guns came nearer and nearer.\n\nGrand-Francoeur, bleeding from a gunshot wound which had grazed his\nskull and torn away his hairy leathern cap, raised a crucifix in his\nright hand; the Marquis, a thorough sceptic, knelt on one knee.\n\n\"Let each one confess his sins aloud. Speak, Monseigneur.\"\n\nAnd the Marquis replied, \"I have killed my fellow-men.\"\n\n\"And I the same,\" said Hoisnard.\n\n\"And I,\" said Guinoiseau.\n\n\"And I,\" said Brin-d'Amour.\n\n\"And I,\" said Chatenay.\n\n\"And I,\" said the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\nThen Grand-Francoeur repeated: \"In the name of the Most Holy Trinity I\nabsolve you. May your souls depart in peace.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" replied all the voices.\n\nThe Marquis rose.\n\n\"Now let us die,\" he said.\n\n\"And kill, as well,\" said the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\nThe blows from the butt-ends of the muskets already shook the chest\nthat stood within the door, barring the entrance.\n\n\"Turn your thoughts to God,\" said the priest; \"earth no longer exists\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" rejoined the Marquis, \"we are in the tomb.\"\n\nAll bowed their heads and smote their breasts. The priest and the\nMarquis alone remained standing. All eyes were fixed on the ground,--the\npriest and the peasants absorbed in prayer, the Marquis buried in his\nown thoughts. The chest, under the hammer-like strokes of the guns,\nsent forth its dismal reverberations.\n\nAt that moment a powerful, resonant voice suddenly rang out behind\nthem, exclaiming,--\n\n\"I told you so, Monseigneur!\"\n\nAll the heads turned in amazement.\n\nA hole had just opened in the wall.\n\nA stone, fitting perfectly with the others, but left without cement\nand provided with a pivot above and below, had revolved on itself like\na turnstile, and, as it turned, had opened the wall. In revolving on\nits axis it opened a double passage to the right and left,--narrow,\nit is true, yet wide enough to allow a man to pass; and through this\nunexpected door could be seen the first steps of a spiral staircase. A\nman's face appeared in the opening, and the Marquis recognized Halmalo.\n\n\n[Illustration 120]\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nTHE DELIVERER.\n\n\n\"Is that you, Halmalo?\"\n\n\"It is I, Monseigneur. You see I was right about the turning stones,\nand that there is a way of escape. I have come just in time. But you\nmust make haste; ten minutes more, and you will be in the heart of the\nforest.\"\n\n\"God is great!\" said the priest.\n\n\"Save yourself, Monseigneur!\" cried the men.\n\n\"Not until I have seen every one of you in safety,\" said the Marquis.\n\n\"But you must lead the way, Monseigneur,\" said the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Turmeau.\n\n\"Not so,\" replied the Marquis; \"I shall be the last man to leave.\"\n\nAnd in a severe tone he continued:--\n\n\"Let there be no strife in this matter of generosity. We have no time\nfor a display of magnanimity; your only chance for life is in escape.\nYou hear my commands: make haste now, and take advantage of this\noutlet,--for which I thank you, Halmalo.\"\n\n\"Are we, then, to separate, Monsieur le Marquis?\" asked the Abb\u00c3\u00a9\nTurmeau.\n\n\"Certainly, after we have left the tower; otherwise, there would be\nsmall chance for escape.\"\n\n\"Will Monseigneur appoint some place of rendez-vous?\"\n\n\"Yes; a glade in the forest,--the Pierre-Gauvaine. Do you know the\nspot?\"\n\n\"We all know it.\"\n\n\"All those who are able to walk will find me there to-morrow at\nnoonday.\"\n\n\"Every man will be on the spot.\"\n\n\"And then we will begin the war over again,\" said the Marquis.\n\nMeanwhile Halmalo, bringing all his strength to bear on the turning\nstone, found that it would not stir, and therefore the opening could\nnot be closed.\n\n\"Let us make haste, Monseigneur,\" he cried; \"the stone will not move. I\nmanaged to open the passage, but now I cannot close it.\"\n\nIn fact, the stone, from a long disuse, had stiffened, so to speak, in\nits groove, and it was impossible to start it again.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Halmalo, \"I hoped to close the passage, so that\nwhen the Blues came in and found no one here they would not know what\nto make of it, and might imagine that you had all vanished in smoke.\nBut the stone is not to be moved, and the enemy will find the outlet\nand probably pursue us; so let us lose not a minute, but reach the\nstaircase as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus laid his hand on Halmalo's shoulder.\n\n\"Comrade,\" he said, \"how long will it take to go through this passage\nand reach the woods in safety?\"\n\n\"Are any of the men seriously wounded?\" asked Halmalo.\n\n\"None,\" they answered.\n\n\"In that case, a quarter of an hour will be sufficient.\"\n\n\"So if the enemy does not get in here for a quarter of an hour--\"\nrejoined the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\n\"He might pursue, but he could not overtake us.\"\n\n\"But they will be upon us in five minutes,\" said the Marquis; \"that old\nchest cannot keep them out much longer. A few blows from their muskets\nwill settle the affair. A quarter of an hour! Who could hold them at\nbay for a quarter of an hour?\"\n\n\"I,\" said the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\n\"You, Gouge-le-Bruant?\"\n\n\"Yes, I, Monseigneur. Listen. Out of six men five of us are wounded. I\nhave not even a scratch.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said the Marquis.\n\n\"Yes, but you are the chief, Monseigneur. I am a soldier. The chief and\nthe soldier are two different persons.\"\n\n\"Our duties are not alike, it is true.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, at this moment we have but one duty between us, and that\nis to save your life.\"\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus turned to his companions.\n\n\"Comrades,\" he said, \"we must hold the enemy in check and delay pursuit\nuntil the last moment. Listen. I have not lost a drop of blood; not\nhaving been wounded, I am as strong as ever, and can hold out longer\nthan any of the others. Go now, but leave me your weapons, and I\npromise to make good use of them. I will undertake to keep the enemy at\nbay a good half-hour. How many loaded pistols are there?\"\n\n\"Four.\"\n\n\"Put them down on the floor.\"\n\nThey did as he required.\n\n\"That is well. I remain here, and they will find some one to entertain\nthem. Now, get away as fast as you can.\"\n\nIn moments of imminent peril gratitude finds but brief expression.\nHardly had they time to press his hand.\n\n\"We shall soon meet again,\" said the Marquis.\n\n\"I hope not, Monseigneur,--not quite at once, for I am about to die.\"\n\nOne by one they made their way down the narrow staircase, the wounded\nin advance; and as they went, the Marquis drew a pencil from his\nnote-book and wrote a few words on the stone that, refusing to turn,\nhad thus left an open passage-way.\n\n\"Come, Monseigneur, you are the only one left,\" said Halmalo, as he\nwent down.\n\nThe Marquis followed him, and Im\u00c3\u00a2nus remained alone.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nTHE EXECUTIONER.\n\n\nUpon the flagstones which formed the only floor of the hall the four\npistols had been placed, and the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, taking two of them, one in\neach hand, advanced stealthily towards the entrance of the staircase,\nobstructed and concealed by the chest.\n\nThe assailants evidently suspected a snare. They might be on the verge\nof one of those decisive explosions that overwhelm both conquerer and\nconquered in one common ruin. In proportion as the first attack had\nbeen impetuous, the last was cautious and deliberate. They could not,\nor perhaps did not care to batter down the chest by main force; they\nhad destroyed the bottom of it with the butts of their muskets and\npierced its lid with their bayonets; and now through these holes they\nattempted to see the interior of the hall before venturing within it.\n\nThe glimmer of the lanterns, by means of which the staircase was\nlighted, fell through these chinks, and the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, catching sight of\nan eye peering through one of them, instantly adjusted the barrel\nof his pistol to the spot and pulled the trigger. No sooner had he\nfired than to his great joy he heard a terrible cry. The ball passed\nthrough the head by way of the eye, and the soldier, interrupted in his\ngazing, fell backward down the staircase. The assailants had broken\nopen the lower part of the lid in two places, forming something not\nunlike loop-holes; and the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, availing himself of one of these\napertures, thrust his arm in it and fired his second pistol at random\namong the mass of the besiegers. The ball probably rebounded, for\nseveral cries were heard, as though three or four had been killed or\nwounded, and a great tumult ensued as the men, losing their footing,\nfell back in confusion. The Im\u00c3\u00a2nus threw down the two pistols which he\nhad discharged, and caught up the remaining ones; grasping one in each\nhand, he peered through the holes in the chest and beheld the result of\nhis first assault.\n\nThe besiegers had retreated down the stairs and the dying lay writhing\nin agony upon the steps; the form of the spiral staircase prevented him\nfrom seeing beyond three or four steps.\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"So much time gained,\" he thought to himself.\n\nMeanwhile, he saw a man crawling up the steps flat on his stomach,\nand just at that moment, a little farther down, the head of a soldier\nemerged from behind the central pillar of the winding stairs. The\nIm\u00c3\u00a2nus aimed at this head and fired. The soldier fell back with a cry,\nand as the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus was transferring his last pistol from his left hand\ninto his right, he himself felt a horrible pain, and in his turn\nuttered a yell of agony. Some tone had thrust a sabre into his vitals,\nand it was the very man whom he had seen crawling along the stair,\nwhose hand, entering the other hole in the bottom of the chest, had\nplunged a sabre into the body of the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\nThe wound was frightful. The abdomen was pierced through and through.\n\nThe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus did not fall. He ground his teeth as he muttered, \"That is\ngood!\"\n\nThen, tottering, and with great effort, he dragged himself back to the\ntorch still burning near the iron door; this he seized, after putting\ndown his pistol, and then, supporting with his left hand the protruding\nintestines, with his right he lowered the torch until it touched the\nsulphur-match, which caught fire, and the wick blazed up in an instant.\n\nDropping the still burning torch upon the ground, he grasped his\npistol, and although he had fallen on the flags, he lifted himself\nand used the scanty breath that was left him to fan the flame, which,\nstarting, ran along until it passed under the iron door and reached the\nbridge-castle.\n\nWhen he beheld the triumph of his villanous scheme, taking to himself\nmore credit for this crime than for his self-sacrifice, the man who had\nacted the part of a hero and who now degraded himself to the level of\nan assassin smiled as he was about to die, and muttered:--\n\n\"They will remember me. I take vengeance on their little ones, in\nbehalf of our own little king shut up in the Temple.\"\n\n\n[Illustration 121]\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nTHE IM\u00c3\u0082NUS ALSO ESCAPES.\n\n\n[Illustration 122]\n\n\nAt that moment a loud voice was heard, and the chest, violently hurled\naside, was shattered into fragments,--giving passage to a man, who,\nsabre in hand, rushed into the hall.\n\n\"It is I, Radoub!\" he cried. \"Who wants to fight me? I am bored to\ndeath with waiting, and I must run the risk. I don't care what happens;\nat all events, I have disembowelled one of you, and now I come to\nattack you all. Follow me or not, as you like; but here I am. How many\nare you?\"\n\nIt was indeed Radoub himself, and he alone. After the slaughter that\nthe Im\u00c3\u00a2nus had made on the staircase, Gauvain, suspecting some hidden\nmine, had withdrawn his men and was taking counsel with Cimourdain.\n\nAmid the darkness, where the expiring torch cast but a feeble glimmer,\nRadoub, sabre in hand, stood on the threshold and repeated his\nquestion,--\n\n\"I am alone. How many are you?\"\n\nReceiving no reply, he advanced. Just then one of those sudden flashes,\nemitted from time to time by a dying fire,--a kind of throbbing light,\nwhich might be compared with a human sob,--burst from the torch and\nilluminated the entire hall.\n\nRadoub caught sight of one of the little mirrors hung on the wall, and\napproaching it, inspected his bloody face and lacerated ear, saying as\nhe did so,--\n\n\"What a horrible mutilation!\"\n\nThen he turned, surprised to see the hall empty, and cried,--\n\n\"No one here! not a soul!\"\n\nHis eyes lighted on the revolving stone, the passage, and the staircase.\n\n\"Ah, I understand! they have taken to their heels! Come on, comrades!\ncome on! They have all run away; they have gone, evaporated, dissolved,\nvanished. There was a crack in this old jug of a tower; there is the\nhole through which they got out, the rascals! How are we ever to get\nthe better of Pitt and Coburg, when men play tricks like these? The\nDevil himself must have come to their aid. There is no one here!\"\n\nA pistol-shot was fired, and a ball, grazing his elbow, flattened\nitself against the wall.\n\n\"Ah! some one is here, then! To whom do I owe this delicate attention?\"\n\n\"To me,\" replied a voice.\n\nRadoub, peering through the shadows, at last descried the form of\nIm\u00c3\u00a2nus.\n\n\"Aha!\" he cried, \"I have got one of you! The others have escaped, but\nyou will not get off.\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\" replied the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus. Radoub made one step\nforward and paused.\n\n\"Hey I who are you, lying on the ground there?\"\n\n\"I am a man on the ground, who laughs at those who are on the feet.\"\n\n\"What is that in your right hand?\"\n\n\"A pistol.\"\n\n\"And in your left hand?\"\n\n\"My intestines.\"\n\n\"I take you prisoner.\"\n\n\"I defy you to do it.\"\n\nAnd the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, stooping over the burning wick, blew feebly upon its\nflame, and with that breath expired.\n\nA few moments later, Gauvain and Cimourdain, followed by the others,\nentered the hall. They all saw the opening, and after searching every\ncorner and exploring the staircase which led down into the ravine, they\nfelt very sure that the enemy had escaped. They shook the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, but\nhe was dead. Gauvain, with lantern in hand, examined the stone which\nhad furnished the fugitives with a means of escape. He had heard of\nthis revolving stone, but he too had always regarded it as a fable.\nWhile he was examining the stone he noticed certain words written with\na pencil; and holding the lantern nearer, he read as follows:--\n\n      \"Au revoir, Monsieur le Vicomte.\n\n      \"LANTENAC.\"\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9champ had joined Gauvain. Pursuit was manifestly out of the\nquestion; the escape had been successful; everything was in favor of\nthe fugitives,--the entire country, the underbrush, the ravines, the\ncopses, and even the inhabitants themselves. No doubt they were far\nenough away by this time; there was no possibility of finding them,\nand the entire forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res was one vast hiding-place. What was\nto be done? They saw themselves forced to begin the whole affair over\nagain. Gauvain and Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ exchanged their regrets and conjectures.\n\nCimourdain listened gravely without uttering a word.\n\n\"By the way, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, how was it about the ladder?\"\n\n\"It has not come, commander.\"\n\n\"But we saw a wagon with an escort of gendarmes.\"\n\n\"It was not bringing the ladder,\" replied Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ.\n\n\"What, then, was it bringing?\"\n\n\"The guillotine,\" said Cimourdain.\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nNEVER PUT A WATCH AND KEY IN THE SAME POCKET.\n\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac was not so far away as they supposed, although\nhe was in perfect safety, and beyond their reach.\n\nHe had followed Halmalo.\n\nThe staircase by which they had descended, following the other\nfugitives, ended in a narrow passage quite near the ravine and the\narches of the bridge. This passage led into a deep natural fissure\nin the ground which formed a connecting link between the ravine and\nthe forest. In this fissure, twisting and turning as it did through\nimpenetrable thickets and utterly hidden from the human eye, no man\ncould ever have been captured; he had but to follow the example of a\nsnake, and his safety was assured. The entrance to this secret passage\nwas so overgrown with brambles, that its constructors had deemed it\nunnecessary to provide it with any other screen.\n\nThe Marquis had now no further need even to consider the matter of\ndisguise. Since his arrival in Brittany he had continued to wear the\npeasant dress, feeling himself to be more truly a grand seigneur when\nthus attired. He had contented himself with taking off his sword,\nunfastening and throwing aside the belt.\n\nWhen Halmalo and the Marquis emerged from the passage into the fissure,\nnothing was to be seen of the five others,--Guinoiseau, Hoisnard\nBranche-d'Or, Brin d'Amour, Chatenay, and the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Turmeau.\n\n\"They have lost no time,\" said Halmalo.\n\n\"Follow their example,\" replied the Marquis.\n\n\"Does Monseigneur wish me to leave him?\"\n\n\"Of course; I have told you so already. A man who is trying to escape\nmust remain alone if he would insure success; one man can often pass\nwhere two would find it impossible. Were we together, we should attract\nattention and imperil each other.\"\n\n\"Does Monseigneur know the neighborhood?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the rendez-vous is still to be the same,--at the Pierre-Gauvaine?\"\n\n\"To-morrow at noon.\"\n\n\"I will be there. We shall all be there.\"\n\nHalmalo paused.\n\n\"Ah, Monseigneur, when I remember the time we were alone together on\nthe open sea, when I wanted to kill you, you who were my lord and\nmaster and might have told me, but did not! What a man you are!\"\n\nThe sole reply of the Marquis was, \"England is our only resource. In\nfifteen days the English must be in France.\"\n\n\"I have a great many things to tell Monseigneur. I have given all his\nmessages.\"\n\n\"We will attend to all that to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Farewell till then, Monseigneur.\"\n\n\"By the way, are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am, Monseigneur. I was in such a hurry to get here, that I\nhave forgotten whether I had anything to eat to-day or not.\"\n\nThe Marquis drew from his pocket a cake of chocolate, broke it in two,\nand giving one half to Halmalo, he began to eat the other himself.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Halmalo, \"you will find the ravine on your right,\nand the forest on your left.\"\n\n\"Very well. Leave me now. Go your own way.\"\n\nHalmalo obeyed, and was at once lost in the darkness. At first there\nwas a rustling of the underbrush soon followed by silence, and in a\nfew moments every trace of his passage had disappeared. This land of\nthe Bocage, bristling with forests and labyrinths, was the fugitives'\nbest ally. Men vanished before one's very eyes. It was this facility\nfor rapid disappearance that made our armies pause before this\never-retreating Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, and rendered its combatants so formidable in\ntheir flight.\n\n[Illustration 123]\n\nThe Marquis stood motionless. Although he was a man who kept his\nfeelings under perfect control, he was not insensible to the joy of\nbreathing the fresh air, after having lived so long in an atmosphere of\nblood and carnage. To be rescued at a moment when all seemed utterly\nlost, to find one's self in safety after gazing into one's own grave,\nto be snatched from death to life, is a severe shock even for such a\nman as Lantenac; and although this was by no means his only experience\nof the kind, he could not at once subdue his agitation. For a moment he\nadmitted to himself his own satisfaction, but straightway suppressed an\nemotion that was akin to joy.\n\nDrawing out his watch he struck the hour. He wondered what time it\nmight be, and to his great surprise discovered that it was but ten\no'clock.\n\nWhen one has just passed through some terrible crisis wherein life and\ndeath have hung in the balance it is always astonishing to discover\nthat those minutes so crowded with action were no longer than any\nothers. The warning cannon had been fired shortly before sunset, and\nhalf an hour later, just at dusk, between seven and eight o'clock, the\nassault on the Tourgue began; hence this tremendous combat beginning at\neight and ending at ten, this epic, as one might call it, had consumed\njust one hundred and twenty minutes. Catastrophes often descend like\na flash of lightning, and events are marvellously fore-shortened, and\nwhen one pauses to reflect, it would be surprising were it otherwise;\ntwo hours' resistance offered by so small a band against a force\nvastly superior to itself was extraordinary, and this struggle of\nnineteen against four thousand could not be called a brief one.\n\nBut it was time to go. Halmalo must by this time be far away, and the\nMarquis felt that prudence no longer required him to remain there. He\nput his watch back into his waistcoat pocket, but not into the one\nfrom which he had taken it, for he noticed that in that one it came in\ncontact with the key of the iron door which the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus had brought him,\nand there was danger of breaking the crystal. Just as he was on the\npoint of taking the left-hand turning towards the forest, he fancied he\nsaw a feint ray of light.\n\nHe turned, and through the underbrush which all at once stood out\nagainst a red background, thus revealing its minutest details with\nabsolute distinctness, he beheld a bright glare along the ravine very\nnear the spot where he was standing. At first, he turned in that\ndirection, then changed his mind as the folly of exposing himself to\nthat light occurred to him; whatever it might be, it was really no\naffair of his in any event. Once more he started to follow Halmalo's\ndirections, and advanced several steps towards the forest.\n\nAll at once, buried and hidden by the brambles as he was, he heard\nabove his head a terrible cry; it seemed to come from the very edge of\nthe plateau, above the ravine. The Marquis raised his eyes and paused.\n\n\n[Illustration: In D\u00c3\u00a6mone Deus. 124]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V.\n\nIN D\u00c3\u0086MONE DEUS.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nFOUND, BUT LOST.\n\n\n[Illustration 125]\n\n\nWhen Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard first perceived the tower reddened by the rays\nof the setting sun, it was more than a league away; and this woman,\nnothing daunted by the distance, though scarcely able to put one foot\nbefore the other, kept bravely on her way. Women may be weak, but\nmothers are strong.\n\nThe sun had set: twilight came on, followed by the darkness of night;\nas she walked along, far away in the distance, from some invisible\nbelfry, probably that of Parign\u00c3\u00a9, she heard the clock strike eight,\nthen nine. From time to time she paused to listen to something that\nsounded like heavy blows; but it might have been only the uncertain\nnoises peculiar to the night.\n\nShe walked straight onward, crushing the furze and prickly heather\nbeneath her bleeding feet. She was guided by a faint light issuing from\nthe distant keep, which bathed the tower in a mysterious glow while it\ndefined its outlines against the surrounding gloom. This light changed\nin measure as the sounds grew loud or faint.\n\nThe vast plateau across which Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard made her way was\ncompletely covered with grass and heather; neither house nor tree was\nto be seen. Its rise was almost imperceptible, and as far as the eye\ncould reach, its long line was clearly defined against the dark horizon\ndotted with stars. She was supported, as she climbed, by the sight\nof the tower constantly before her eyes, and as she drew nearer, it\ngradually increased in size.\n\nAs we have just remarked, the muffled reports and the pallid gleams of\nlight that issued from the tower were intermittent; dying away and then\nreturning as they did, it seemed to the wretched mother in her distress\nlike some agonizing enigma.\n\nSuddenly they ceased, and with the sound, the light too died away;\nthere was a moment of absolute silence, an appalling tranquillity, and\nthen it was that Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard reached the edge of the plateau.\n\nShe saw beneath her feet a ravine, whose depths were hidden by the\ndim shadows of night; at a short distance, on the top of the plateau,\nthe confused mass of wheels, slopes; and embrasures which formed the\nbattery; and before her, indistinctly lighted by the burning matches of\nthe guns, an enormous edifice that seemed built of shadows blacker than\nthose that surrounded it.\n\nThis building consisted of a bridge, whose arches rested in the ravine,\ntogether with a kind of castle erected on the bridge, both castle and\nbridge supported by a round and lofty mass of masonry; this was the\ntower which had been that mother's distant goal. One could see the\nlights moving to and fro behind the loop-holes of the tower, and it was\nevident, from the noise issuing therefrom, that it was crowded with\nmen, whose shadows were projected even as high as platform.\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard could distinguish the vedettes of the camp near the\nbattery, but the darkness and the underbrush concealed her from their\nview.\n\nShe had reached the edge of the plateau, and was so close to the bridge\nthat it seemed as if she could almost touch it with her hand. The deep\nravine alone separated her from it. She could distinguish even in the\ndarkness the three stories of the bridge-castle.\n\nShe knew not how long she had been standing there, having lost all\nconsciousness of time, absorbed in a silent contemplation of that\nyawning chasm and the gloomy building. What was it that was going\non within. Was this the Tourgue? She felt that restless sense of\nexpectation peculiar to travellers who have either just arrived or are\non the eve of departure. As she stood listening and gazing around, she\ntried to think why she was there. Suddenly all objects vanished before\nher eyes.\n\nA veil of smoke had suddenly obscured the object she was watching. A\nsharp pain forced her to close her eyes; but she had no sooner done so,\nthan a light flashed upon them so intensely brilliant that her eyelids\nseemed transparent, and when she opened them again, the night had\nchanged into day, but the light of that day, dreadful to look upon, was\nborn of fire. What she saw was the outburst of a conflagration.\n\nThe smoke had changed from black to scarlet, from which at times a\nmighty flame leaped forth, with those fierce contortions peculiar to\nthe lightning and the serpent. It darted forth like a tongue from some\nmonstrous jaw; but it was really a window filled with fire, whose\niron bars were already red hot,--a casement in the lower story of the\nbridge-castle, and the only part of the entire building that could now\nbe seen. Even the plateau was shrouded in the smoke, and the edge of\nthe ravine alone could be distinguished against the crimson flames.\n\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard looked on in amazement. Smoke is a cloud; dreams come\nfrom the clouds; hardly realizing what she saw, she knew not what to\ndo. Should she stay, or try to make her escape? She almost felt herself\ntransported beyond the actual world.\n\nThere came a gust of wind, that rent the curtain of smoke and revealed\nthrough this gap the tragic Bastile, in all its grandeur, with its\nkeep, its bridge, and its castle, dazzling and terrible, magnificently\ngilded by the light of the flames which were reflected upon it from\nsummit to base. Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard could see everything by the awful\nglare of the flames.\n\nOnly the lower story of the bridge-castle was as yet burning.\n\nAbove it could be seen the two other stories, still intact, though\nresting as it were upon a bed of flames. From the edge of the plateau\nwhere she stood, through the smoke and fire, Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard caught\nan occasional glimpse of the interior. All the windows were open.\nThrough those of the second story, which were very large, she could\nsee cases along the walls, which seemed to her to be filled with books;\nand in front of one of the windows, lying on the floor in the shadow,\nshe noticed a little group whose outline had no definite form; it lay\nin a heap, like a nest or brood of young birds, and from time to time\nshe thought she saw it stir.\n\nShe watched it.\n\nWhat could this little group of shadows be?\n\nSometimes she fancied it was composed of living forms. She was feverish\nand exhausted, for she had not eaten a mouthful since morning, had\nwalked incessantly, and she felt as if she were the victim of some sort\nof hallucination which she instinctively mistrusted. But her eyes were\nnow riveted upon this dark group of objects, whatsoever they might be;\ndoubtless it was something inanimate lying there upon the floor in the\nhall directly over the conflagration.\n\nSuddenly, as though inspired by a will of its own, the fire flung forth\na jet of flame upon the dead ivy that mantled the very wall on which\nMichelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard stood gazing. It was as if it had just discovered\nthis network of withered branches; a spark greedily seized upon it, and\nthe fire began to rise from twig to twig with the frightful rapidity of\na powder-train. In the twinkling of an eye the flame reached the second\nstory, and from thence a light was thrown into the one below. A vivid\nglare brought into instantaneous relief three little sleeping children.\n\nIt was a charming group, their little legs and arms intertwined, their\neyelids closed, their faces sweetly smiling.\n\nThe mother knew her children.\n\nShe uttered a terrible cry.\n\nThat cry of inexpressible anguish is given only to mothers. No sound\ncan be more savage and yet pathetic. Uttered by a woman, it is like the\ncry of a she-wolf; and when one hears it from a wolf it might well come\nfrom a woman.\n\nThis cry of Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard was a howl. Hecuba howled, Homer tells us.\n\nAnd this was the cry just heard by the Marquis de Lantenac.\n\nWe saw him pause to listen.\n\nHe was between the outlet of the passage through which Halmalo had\nguided him in his escape, and the ravine. Through the tangled wildwood\nabout him he saw the burning bridge, and the Tourgue reddened by\nthe reflection; he pushed aside the branches, and discovered on the\nopposite side, above his head, on the edge of the plateau, in front of\nthe burning castle, and in the full light of the conflagration, the\nhaggard and woful face of a woman bending over the ravine.\n\nThis face was no longer the face of Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard; it was a Medusa.\nThere is something formidable in intense agony. This peasant woman had\nchanged into one of the Eumenides. The unknown rustic, low, ignorant,\nstupid, had suddenly taken on the epic proportions of despair. Great\nsorrows expand the soul to gigantic proportions. This mother was the\nembodiment of maternity. A summary of humanity rises to the superhuman;\nshe stood towering above the edge of the ravine, within sight of the\nconflagration, in presence of that crime like a power from beyond\nthe grave. Moaning like a wild beast, she stood in the attitude of\na goddess, with a countenance like a flaming mask, hurling forth\nimprecations. Nothing could have been more imperious than the lightning\nthat flashed from those eyes drowned in tears; her look was like a\nthunderbolt hurled against the conflagration.\n\nThe Marquis listened. These reproaches fell upon his head; he heard her\ninarticulate, heart-rending cries, more like sobs than words:--\n\n\"My children, oh, my Lord! They are my children! Help! Fire! Fire!\nFire! You must be brigands! Is there no one here? But my children will\nbe burned to death! Such doings! Georgette! My children! Gros-Alain!\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean! What can this mean? Who put my children there? They are\nsleeping. I am mad! Oh, this is impossible! Help!\"\n\nMeanwhile, a great commotion was going on in the Tourgue and on\nthe plateau. The whole camp had rushed to the fire, which had just\nbroken out. The besiegers, after encountering the grape-shot, had\nnow to struggle against the fire. Gauvain, Cimourdain, and Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ\nwere giving orders. What could be done? A few buckets of water might\npossibly be drawn from the slender stream in the ravine. The edge of\nthe plateau was covered with terrified faces, gazing at the sight with\never-increasing distress; and it was an awful scene.\n\n[Illustration 126]\n\nThere they stood looking on, but none could lend a helping hand.\n\nBy way of the ivy the flames had risen to the upper story, and finding\nthere a granary filled with straw had rushed upon it; and that entire\ngranary was now on fire, the flames merrily dancing. A dreadful sight\nis the glee of a fire! It was like the breath of fiends fanning a\nfunereal pile. One could fancy that the terrible Im\u00c3\u00a2nus was in person\nthere, metamorphosed into a whirlwind of sparks, living in this cruel\nlife of flame, and that his horrible soul had been transformed into a\nconflagration. The flames had not yet reached the library story; its\nlofty ceiling and massive walls had retarded the fatal moment that was\nnow drawing near. The flames, like tongues of fire, darted upward from\nthe story below; while the flames from above touched the stones, as if\ncarressing them with the dread kiss of death. Beneath it lay a cave\nof lava, above an arch of fiery coals. Were the floor to cave in, all\nwould be precipitated into a bed of red-hot ashes; were the ceiling to\ngive way, they would be buried beneath the glowing coals. Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean,\nGros-Alain, and Georgette had not yet waked; they were sleeping the\nsound and innocent sleep of childhood; and through the sheets of flame\nand smoke which now hid, now revealed the windows, they could be seen\nin this fiery grotto against a background of meteoric light, calm,\ngraceful, and motionless, like three heavenly cherubs confidingly\nslumbering in hell. A tiger might have wept to see such blossoms in\nthat furnace,--their cradles in the grave.\n\n[Illustration 127]\n\nMeanwhile the mother wrung her hands:--\n\n\"Fire! Fire! I am crying fire! Are they all deaf, that no one comes?\nThey arc burning up my children! Come, you men over yonder! To think\nof the days and days I have walked, and to find them like this! Fire!\nHelp! They are angels, nothing short of angels! What have those\ninnocents done? They shot me, and now they are burning them! Who does\nsuch things as these? Help! Save my children! Don't you hear me? If I\nwere a dog, you would have pity on me! My children! They are asleep!\nAh, Georgette, I see her dear little body! Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean! Gros-Alain!\nThose are their names. You can see well enough that I am their mother.\nSuch abominable doings go on in these days! I have walked for days and\nnights. Why, I talked about them this very morning to a woman. Help!\nHelp! Fire! They must be monsters! This is horrible! The oldest one\nis not five years old and the baby not two. I can see their little\nnaked legs. They are asleep. Holy Virgin! Heaven gives them to me and\nHell snatches them back again. Just think how far I have walked! The\nchildren that I fed with my milk,--I who felt so wretched because I\ncouldn't find them! Have pity on me! I want my children; I must have\nthem! And to think of them there in the fire! See my poor bleeding\nfeet. Help! It cannot be that there are men on earth who would let\nthose poor little creatures die like that! Help! Murder! Who ever saw\nthe like? Ah, the brigands! What is that dreadful house? They stole\nthem from me to murder them. Merciful Jesus! I want my children. Oh, I\ndon't know what to do! They must not die! Help! Help! Help! Oh, I shall\ncurse Heaven if they die like that!\"\n\nSimultaneously with the mother's entreaty other voices rang out on the\nplateau and the ravine.\n\n\"A ladder!\"\n\n\"There is none.\"\n\n\"Water!\"\n\n\"None to be had!\"\n\n\"Up in the tower there, in the second story, there is a door.\"\n\n\"It is iron.\"\n\n\"Break it in!\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\nHere the mother redoubled her desperate appeals.\n\n\"Fire! Help! Make haste, or kill me at once! My children! My children!\nOh, that terrible fire! Throw me into the fire, but save their lives!\"\n\nIn the intervals between her cries could be heard the constant\ncrackling of the flames.\n\nThe Marquis felt in his pocket and his hand met the key to the iron\ndoor. Then stooping below the arch, through which he had just escaped,\nhe re-entered the passage from which he had so lately emerged.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nFROM THE DOOR OF STONE TO THAT OF IRON.\n\n\n[Illustration 128]\n\n\nA whole army driven half wild by its enforced inaction in the presence\nof danger; four thousand men unable to save three children,--such was\nthe situation.\n\nIn point of fact, they had no ladder; the one sent from Javen\u00c3\u00a9 had not\narrived; the flames spread as from a yawning crater; it was simply\nabsurd to attempt to extinguish them with the water from the half-dried\nbrook in the ravine; one might as well empty a glass of water into a\nvolcano.\n\nCimourdain, Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, and Radoub had gone down into the ravine. Gauvain\nhad returned to the hall on the second story of the Tourgue, where the\nturning stone, the secret passage, and the iron door of the library\nwere to be found; it was there that the sulphur match had been lighted\nby the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus, and there the fire had originated.\n\nGauvain had brought with him twenty sappers. Their last resource was to\nforce open the iron door. Its fastenings were terribly strong.\n\nThey went at it with their axes, dealing violent blows. The axes broke.\nOne of the sappers exclaimed,--\n\n\"Steel shivers like glass against that iron.\"\n\nIn fact, the door was composed of double sheets of wrought-iron bolted\ntogether, each sheet three inches thick.\n\nThen they took iron bars and tried to pry the door open from below. The\niron bars broke.\n\n\"One would think they were matches,\" said the sapper.\n\n\"Nothing less than a cannon-ball could open that door,\" muttered\nGauvain, gloomily. \"We should have to mount a field-piece up here.\"\n\n\"But even then--\" replied the sapper.\n\nFor a moment they stood in despair, and their arms fell helpless by\ntheir sides. With a sense of defeat, these men stood in speechless\ndismay, gazing upon that door so awful in its immobility. They caught\na glimpse of the red reflection from beneath it. Behind them, the fire\nwas spreading.\n\nThe frightful body of the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus was there, dread victor that he was.\n\nBut a few minutes more, and the entire building might fall into ruins.\n\nWhat could they do? The last ray of hope was gone.\n\nGauvain, whose eyes were riveted on the revolving stone and the opening\nthrough which the escape had been made, cried in the bitterness of his\nexasperation,--\n\n\"And yet the Marquis de Lantenac escaped through that door!\"\n\n\"And returns,\" said a voice.\n\nAgainst the stone setting of the secret passage appeared a white head.\n\nIt was the Marquis.\n\nIt was many a year since Gauvain had seen him so close at hand. He drew\nback.\n\nEvery man present stood as if petrified.\n\nThe Marquis held a large key in his hand; with one haughty glance he\ncompelled the sappers who stood in his path to make way for him, walked\nat once to the iron door, stooped beneath the arch, and put the key\ninto the lock.\n\nIt creaked in the lock, the door opened, they saw the fiery gulf; the\nMarquis entered it.\n\nWith head erect and steady step he strode forward. And those who\nlooked on shuddered as their eyes followed his receding form.\n\nHe had barely taken a few steps in the burning hall, before the inlaid\nfloor, undermined by the fire and shaken by his tread, gave way behind\nhim, setting a chasm between him and the door. The Marquis pursued his\nway, never once turning his head, and vanished in the smoke.\n\nNothing more was seen.\n\nHad he succeeded in making his way; or had another fiery chasm opened\nunder his feet; or had he but ended his own life? No one could tell. A\nwall of smoke and flames rose before them. Whether dead or alive, the\nMarquis was on the other side.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWHERE THE SLEEPING CHILDREN WAKE.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the little ones had at last opened their eyes.\n\nThe fire, although it had not yet reached the library, cast a red\nreflection on the ceiling. It was not the kind of dawn the children\nknew. They were gazing at it,--Georgette utterly absorbed.\n\nThe conflagration showed forth all its glories; the black hydra and\nthe scarlet dragon appeared amid the smoke-wreaths in all their sombre\nand vermilion hues. Great sparks shot out into the distance, lighting\nup the gloom like contending comets pursuing one another. Fire is\na prodigal; its furnaces abound in jewels which they scatter to the\nwinds; and it is to some purpose that charcoal is identical with the\ndiamond. From the fissures opened in the wall of the third story, the\nembers were showering down into the ravine like cascades of jewels;\nthe heaps of straw and oats burning in the granary began to pour in\na stream through the windows like avalanches of gold-dust,--the oats\nchanging to amethysts, and the straw to carbuncles.\n\n\"Pretty!\" cried Georgette.\n\nAll three were now sitting up.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the mother, \"they are awake!\"\n\nWhen Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean rose, then Gros-Alain rose also, and Georgette followed.\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean stretched himself, and going towards the window, exclaimed,\n\"I am hot!\"\n\n\"Me hot!\" repeated Georgette.\n\nThe mother called them.\n\n\"Children! Ren\u00c3\u00a9! Alain! Georgette!\"\n\nThe children looked round. They were trying to find out what it all\nmeant. Where men feel terrified, children are simply curious; he who is\nopen to surprise is not easily alarmed; ignorance is closely allied to\nintrepidity. Children have so little claim upon hell, that were they to\nbehold it, it would but excite their admiration.\n\nThe mother kept repeating,--\n\n\"Ren\u00c3\u00a9! Alain! Georgette!\"\n\nRen\u00c3\u00a9-Jean turned; that voice roused him from his reverie. Children have\nshort memories, but their recollections are swift; the entire past is\nfor them but as yesterday. When Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean saw his mother, it seemed\nto him the most natural thing that could happen, surrounded as he was\nby strange things; and with a dim consciousness of needing support, he\ncalled, \"Mamma!\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" said Gros-Alain.\n\n\"M'ma!\" repeated Georgette.\n\nAnd she stretched out her little arms.\n\nThe mother shrieked, \"My children!\"\n\nThe three children came to the window-ledge; fortunately, the\nconflagration was not on this side.\n\n\"I am too warm,\" said Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean; then added, \"it burns\"! and he looked\nfor his mother.\n\n\"Why don't you come, mamma?\" he said.\n\n\"Tum, m'ma,\" repeated Georgette.\n\nThe mother, with her hair streaming, torn and bleeding as she was,\nlet herself roll from bush to bush, down into the ravine. There stood\nCimourdain and Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, as powerless in their position as Gauvain was\nin his. The soldiers, in despair at their helplessness, were swarming\naround them. The heat would have seemed unbearable, had any one noticed\nit. They were discussing the escarpment of the bridge, the height of\nthe arches and of the different stories, the inaccessible windows, and\nthe necessity for speedy action. Three stories to climb, with no means\nof access. Radoub, wounded by a sabre-thrust in the shoulder, his ear\nlacerated, dripping with sweat and blood, had appeared upon the scene.\nHe saw Michelle Fl\u00c3\u00a9chard.\n\n\"What have we here,--the woman who was shot come to life again?\"\n\n\"My children!\" cried the mother.\n\n\"You are right!\" replied Radoub; \"this is no time to inquire about\nghosts.\" And he started to scale the bridge,--a useless attempt. He\ndug his nails into the stone, clung thus for a few seconds, but the\nsmooth layers of stone offered neither cleft nor projection; they were\nas accurately fitted one upon the other as if the wall had just been\nbuilt, and Radoub fell back. The fire was still increasing, terrible\nto behold. They could see the three fair heads framed in the window\nlighted by the glowing flames. Then Radoub shook his fist towards\nHeaven as though he beheld some one, and exclaimed,--\n\n\"Has Almighty God no mercy?\"\n\nThe mother, kneeling, clasped her arms around one of the piers of the\nbridge, crying, \"Mercy!\"\n\nThe hollow sound of crashing timbers mingled with the crackling of\nthe flames. The glass doors of the bookcases in the library cracked\nand fell with a crash. There could be no doubt that the woodwork was\ngiving way. Human strength was of no avail. One moment, and the entire\nbuilding would be swallowed up in the abyss. They were only waiting\nfor the final catastrophe. The little voices could be heard repeating,\n\"Mamma, mamma!\" They were in paroxysms of terror.\n\nSuddenly against the crimson background of the flames a tall figure\ncame into view standing in the window next to the one where the\nchildren stood.\n\nAll heads were raised, all eyes were riveted upon the spot. A man\nup there, in the hall of the library,--a man in that furnace! His\nface looked black against the flames, but his hair was white. They\nrecognized the Marquis de Lantenac.\n\nHe vanished, but only to appear again.\n\n[Illustration 129]\n\nThis appalling old man stood in the window, managing an enormous\nladder. It was the escape-ladder, which had been lying along the\nlibrary wall, and which he had dragged to the window. He seized one end\nof it, and with the masterly agility of an athlete he let it slip out\nof the window over the outer ledge down into the depths of the ravine.\nRadoub, standing below, wild with excitement, received the ladder in\nhis outstretched arms, and clasping it to his breast, cried,--\n\n\"Long live the Republic!\"\n\n\"Long live the King!\" replied the Marquis.\n\n\"You may cry what you please,\" muttered Radoub, \"and talk all the\nnonsense you like; you are a very angel of mercy.\"\n\nThe ladder was firmly planted, and communication thereby established\nbetween the burning hall and the ground. Twenty men, led by Radoub,\nrushed forward, and in the twinkling of an eye grouped themselves on\nthe ladder from top to bottom, leaning back against the rungs, like\nmasons carrying stones up and down, thus forming a human ladder over\nthe wooden one. Radoub, standing on the uppermost rung, facing towards\nthe fire, was just on a level with the window.\n\nThe little army, dispersed across the heath and along the slopes,\novercome by contending emotions, hastened towards the plateau down into\nthe ravine and up to the platform of the tower. Again they lost sight\nof the Marquis, but he reappeared, carrying a child in his arms.\n\nThe applause was tremendous.\n\nHe had caught up the first child that came within his reach, and it\nchanced to be Gros-Alain, who cried out,--\n\n\"I am frightened!\"\n\nThe Marquis handed him to Radoub, who passed him on to a soldier\nstanding just behind him, a little farther down, who in his turn\ndelivered him to the next one; and while Gros-Alain, screaming with\nterror, was thus transferred from hand to hand until he reached the\nbottom of the ladder, the Marquis, disappearing for a moment, returned\nto the window with Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, who, struggling and crying, slapped\nRadoub just as the Marquis handed him to the sergeant.\n\nAgain the Marquis went back into the burning room. Georgette was the\nonly one left. She smiled, and this man of granite felt the tears\nspring to his eyes. \"What is your name?\" he asked.\n\n\"'Orgette,\" she said.\n\nHe took her still smiling in his arms, and as he gave her to Radoub\nhis conscience, austerely pure, albeit darkened, succumbed to the\noverpowering charm of innocence, and the old man kissed the child.\n\n\"It is the little midget!\" exclaimed the soldiers; and so Georgette in\nher turn, amid the cries of admiration, was also passed from hand to\nhand till she reached the ground. The soldiers clapped their hands and\nstamped their feet. The old grenadiers sobbed aloud as she smiled upon\nthem.\n\nThe mother stood at the foot of the ladder, panting, frantic,\nintoxicated by this sudden transition from hell to paradise. Excess of\njoy tears the heart in a fashion of its own. She held out her arms,\nfirst receiving Gros-Alain, then Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Jean, then Georgette. She covered\nthem with frenzied kisses; then bursting into a laugh she fell swooning\nto the ground.\n\nThen rose a loud cry,--\n\n\"All are saved!\"\n\nAnd so indeed they were, except the old man.\n\nBut no one thought of him, not even he himself perhaps. For several\ninstants he stood dreamily near the window-ledge, as though he would\ngive the fiery abyss time to make up its mind; then deliberately,\nslowly, and proudly he stepped over the window-sill, and without\nturning, holding himself upright and perfectly erect, with his back\ntowards the rungs, the conflagration behind and the precipice before\nand beneath him, with all the majesty of a supernatural being he\nproceeded to descend the ladder in silence. Those who were on the\nladder rushed down; a thrill ran through the witnesses, and they drew\nback in holy horror before this man who was approaching them like\na vision. But stately and grave he continued his descent into the\ndarkness before him, drawing nearer and nearer as they recoiled before\nhis approach. His marble pallor revealed not a wrinkle; his ghost-like\neyes, cold as steel, neither glittered nor flashed. As he drew near\nthese men, whose startled eyes were fixed upon him in the darkness,\nhe seemed to grow at every step; the ladder shook and echoed beneath\nhis ominous tread; he might have been compared to the statue of the\ncommander returning to his tomb.\n\nWhen he reached the bottom and had stepped from the last rung of the\nladder to the ground, a hand seized him by the collar. He turned.\n\n\"I arrest you,\" said Cimourdain.\n\n\"I approve,\" replied Lantenac.\n\n\n[Illustration 130]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI.\n\nAFTER VICTORY, STRUGGLE BEGINS.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nLANTENAC TAKEN.\n\n\nThe Marquis had indeed descended into his tomb.\n\nThey led him away.\n\nThe oubliette dungeon on the ground-floor of the Tourgue was forthwith\nreopened under Cimourdain's severe superintendence; a lamp was placed\nthere, a jug of water, and a loaf of soldier's bread; a bundle of straw\nwas flung in; and in less than a quarter of an hour from the instant\nwhen the priest's hand had seized upon him, the dungeon door closed\nupon Lantenac.\n\nThis done, Cimourdain joined Gauvain; at that moment the clock from the\ndistant church of Parign\u00c3\u00a9 struck eleven: Cimourdain said to Gauvain:--\n\n\"I am about to summon a court-martial. You will not join it; you are\na Gauvain as well as Lantenac. You are too nearly related to be a\njudge; and I do not approve of \u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9 sitting in judgment upon Capet.\nThe court-martial will consist of three judges,--one officer, Captain\nGu\u00c3\u00a9champ, one non-commissioned officer, Sergeant Radoub, and myself,\nwho will preside. You need have no further concern in the matter. We\nshall be governed by the decree of the Convention; all we have to do\nis simply to prove the identity of the ci-devant Marquis de Lantenac.\nTo-morrow the court-martial, the day after to-morrow the guillotine.\nThe Vend\u00c3\u00a9e is dead.\"\n\nGauvain made no reply; and Cimourdain, preoccupied with the important\nbusiness that lay before him, departed. He now had to appoint the hour\nand select the place. Like Lequinio at Granville, Talien at Bordeaux,\nCh\u00c3\u00a2lier at Lyons, and Saint-Just at Strasbourg, he had made a practice\nof superintending executions in person. It was regarded as an excellent\nexample, this supervision on the part of the judge of the executioner's\nwork,--a custom borrowed by the Terror of '93 from the parliaments of\nFrance and the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nGauvain himself was preoccupied.\n\nA cold wind blew from the forest. He left Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ to give the\nnecessary orders, went into his tent, which was in the meadow on the\noutskirts of the wood at the foot of the Tourgue, and taking his hooded\ncloak wrapped himself in it. This cloak was trimmed with that simple\ngaloon which in accordance with the republican fashion, averse to\ndecoration, designated the commander-in-chief. He began to pace up and\ndown this bloody field where the assault was begun. There he was alone.\nThe fire, though scarcely heeded, had not yet ceased to bum. Radoub was\nwith the mother and children, almost as motherly as she herself; the\nbridge-castle was nearly consumed, the sappers completing the work of\nthe flames; they dug ditches, buried the dead, cared for the wounded,\ndemolished the _retirade,_ and removed the dead bodies from the rooms\nand the staircases; the men were at work purifying the scene of\ncarnage, sweeping away the mass of horrible filth, and setting matters\nin order after the battle with military rapidity. Gauvain took no note\nof all this activity.\n\nAbsorbed in his own thoughts, he hardly glanced at the sentries\nguarding the breach, doubled by the order of Cimourdain.\n\nHe could distinguish this breach amid the darkness, about two hundred\npaces from that part of the field in which he had found refuge. He saw\nthat black opening. There the attack began three hours ago; this was\nthe breach through which Gauvain had made his way into the tower; there\nwas the ground-floor, with the _retirade;_ the Marquis's dungeon-door\nopened on to that floor. The sentries posted near the breach guarded\nthe dungeon.\n\nWhile thus he gazed absently upon it, these words returned confusedly\nto his ears, like the tolling of a funeral knell: \"The court-martial\nto-morrow; the guillotine the day after to-morrow.\"\n\nThe fire, which had been isolated, and upon which the sappers had\ndashed all the water that they could obtain, still resisted their\nefforts to extinguish it, and continued to shoot forth occasional jets\nof flame. Now and then was heard the cracking of the ceilings and the\ncrashing of the stories as they fell one upon another; then showers of\nsparks flew about as from a whirling torch, revealing like a flash of\nlightning the extreme limit of the horizon; and the shadow cast by the\nTourgue would grow to colossal size, extending to the very edge of the\nforest.\n\nGauvain walked slowly back and forth in this shadow in front of the\nbreach. Now and then he clasped both his hands behind his head, covered\nby his military hood. He was thinking.\n\n\n[Illustration 131]\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nGAUVAIN MEDITATING.\n\n\nHis reverie was fathomless.\n\nAn unheard of change had taken place.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac had been transfigured, and Gauvain had seen it\nwith his own eyes.\n\nHe would never have believed it possible that such a state of things\ncould have come to pass from any complication of events whatsoever.\nEven in a dream he could not have imagined such a condition of affairs.\n\nThe Unforeseen, that inexplicable force that makes a man the plaything\nof its capricious will, had seized Gauvain and held him fast.\n\nBefore his eyes he beheld the realization of the impossible,--visible,\npalpable, inevitable, inexorable.\n\nAnd what did he think of it? This was no time for evasion; he must make\nup his mind. A question had been presented to him; he must meet it\nfairly.\n\nWho had asked this question?\n\nIt had come to him in the course of events, but not through events\nalone.\n\nFor when events, which are ever changing, ask us a question, immutable\njustice summons us to answer.\n\nBehind the cloud that casts the shadow is the star that sheds the light.\n\nWe can no more escape the light than the shadow.\n\nGauvain was undergoing an interrogatory.\n\nHe had been arraigned before a judge.\n\nAn awe-inspiring presence.\n\nHis own conscience.\n\nHis entire being was vacillating within him; his firmest resolutions,\nhis most solemn promises, his most irrevocable determinations, were all\nshaken to their foundations. The soul has its earthquakes.\n\nThe more he reflected upon what he had just witnessed, the more\nconfused he grew.\n\nGauvain, Republican as he was, believed himself to be and was just; but\na superior law had been revealed.\n\nHuman law takes a higher stand than the law of revolutions. This\naffair now in progress could not be evaded; it was a serious matter,\nand Gauvain formed a part of it; he was involved in it, and could not\nextricate himself; and however much Cimourdain might say, \"This matter\nno longer concerns you,\" he felt all the sensations of a tree torn up\nby its roots.\n\nEvery man has a basis; a shock to this basis produces a serious\ndisturbance; and this was what Gauvain now felt. He pressed his head\nbetween his hands, as if to express from it the truth. It was no easy\ntask to gain a clear idea of a situation like his: nothing could be\nmore uncomfortable; he saw before him a formidable array of ciphers\nto be added up. To add up the columns of human destiny! The bare\nthought made him dizzy. And yet he was endeavoring to do this; he was\ntrying to explain matters to himself, to collect his ideas, to subdue\nthe resistance that he felt within him, and to review the facts. He\nrevolved them again and again in his mind.\n\nIs there one among us who has not been called upon to consider some\nimportant subject in all its bearings, or has not asked himself at a\nserious crisis which road to follow,--whether to advance or to retreat?\n\nGauvain had been witness to a miracle.\n\nWhile the earthly combat was still in progress, a celestial one had\nbegun.\n\nA contest between good and evil.\n\nA merciless heart had just been conquered.\n\nIn the man before him, with all the evil inherent to his nature,\nviolence, error, blindness, an unwholesome obstinacy, selfishness, and\npride, Gauvain had witnessed a miracle. A victory won by humanity over\nthe man.\n\nThe human victorious over the inhuman.\n\nAnd by what means? How was it achieved? How had it overthrown a\ncolossus of anger and hatred? What weapons had it used? What machinery\nof warfare? Simply the cradle.\n\nTo Gauvain it was positively bewildering. To the very midst of civil\nwar, at the climax of hostility and vengeance, in the darkest and\nfiercest moment of the tumult, when crime lent all its fires, and\nhatred all its blackness, at the very crisis of the struggle when\nanything may serve for a missile, when the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e is so direful that man\nis lost to every sense of justice, honesty, and truth, suddenly from\nthe Unknown, that mysterious monitor of the human soul, overpowering\nall the lights and shadows of humanity, came one broad flash of the\neverlasting light.\n\nAbove that fatal duel between falsehood and comparative truth, the face\nof absolute truth had suddenly risen from the depths.\n\nThe strength of the weak had suddenly intervened.\n\nThe triumph of three poor little beings, but lately born into the\nworld, unconscious of wrong, orphans, forsaken, and alone, lisping\nand smiling, with all the Gorgons of civil war, retaliation, the\nterrible logic of reprisals, murder, carnage, fratricide, wrath, and\nmalice, had just been witnessed, together with the failure and defeat\nof an infamous conflagration kindled with criminal intent; cruelty\nhad been frustrated and baffled; ancient feudal ferocity, inexorable\ndisdain, the professed experience of the necessities of war, reasons\nof State, all the arrogant resolves of savage old age vanished before\nthe innocent blue eyes of infant life; and what could be more simple?\nThe infant whose little life has just begun, has done no evil; it is\nthe embodiment of justice, truth, and innocence; the highest angels of\nheaven dwell in little children.\n\nAnd truly it was an edifying sight; these frenzied combatants in\na merciless war had, in the face of all their evil deeds, their\ncrimes, fanaticism, and murder, vengeance fanning the funeral piles,\ndeath advancing torch in hand, suddenly seen Innocence rise in its\nomnipotence above this countless legion of crimes.\n\nAnd Innocence had won the day.\n\nOne might well say, No; civil war has no existence; there are no\nsuch evils as barbarism, hatred, or crime; there is no darkness; the\ndivine dawn of infancy has but to rise, and all these spectres will\nstraightway vanish.\n\nNever in any struggle had the presence of Satan and of Almighty God\nbeen more plainly visible.\n\nA conscience had furnished the arena for this combat. It was the\nconscience of Lantenac.\n\nAnd again it was renewed, more desperate, and possibly more decisively\nthan ever, in another conscience,--in the conscience of Gauvain.\n\nWhat a battle-field is the mind of man!\n\nOur thoughts, like gods, monsters, or giants, hold us in their power.\n\nSometimes those terrible wrestlers trample our very soul beneath their\nfeet.\n\nGauvain was thinking.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac, hemmed in, blockaded, condemned, outlawed,\nconfined like a wild beast in a circus, held like a nail in a vice,\nimmured in his own home that had changed into a prison, encompassed\non every side by a wall of iron and fire, had eluded his enemies and\nstolen away. He had effected a miraculous escape. He had achieved a\nmasterpiece,--the most difficult of all accomplishments in a war like\nthis,--flight. He had regained possession of the forest to intrench\nhimself therein, of the district where he would renew the combat, and\nof the impenetrable shadows among which he might vanish from sight.\nOnce more he had become formidable, ever on the wing, a knight-errant\nwhose presence boded evil; the captain of invisible forces, the leader\nof men who dwell beneath the ground, the master of the woods. Gauvain\nwas victorious, but Lantenac was free. Henceforth Lantenac was safe,\nhis career unfettered, asylums without number from which to choose. He\nwas intangible, unapproachable, inaccessible. This lion, caught in a\nsnare, had forced his way out, and now behold he had come back to it.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac had voluntarily, impelled only by his free\nwill, left the shades of the forest, where safety and freedom awaited\nhim, to return to the most frightful danger; first, Gauvain had seen it\nhimself, rushing with fearless spirit into the flames that threatened\nto engulf him, and again descending that ladder that was to deliver him\ninto the hands of his enemies,--the same ladder that offered escape to\nothers, but to him absolute ruin.\n\nAnd why had he done this?\n\nTo save three children.\n\nAnd what were they now about to do with this man?\n\nGuillotine him.\n\nAnd so, this man, for the sake of three children,--his own? No; of\nhis kin perhaps? Not at all; belonging to his own rank in life? By no\nmeans; for three little beggars, chance children, foundlings, unknown\nto him, ragged and barefooted, this nobleman, this prince, this old\nman, who had made his escape, who was both a free man and a victor, for\nescape is a triumph in itself,--had risked everything, compromised his\nown safety, imperilled the cause, and while restoring the children, he\noffered up his own head, this head hitherto terrible, but now august.\n\nAnd what were they about to do with it?\n\nTo accept it.\n\nThe Marquis de Lantenac had had the opportunity to choose between the\nlife of others and his own; and when this splendid option lay before\nhim, he chose his death.\n\nAnd it was to be granted him.\n\nThey would put him to death.\n\nWhat a reward for heroism!--To return a generous action by a deed of\nbarbarity!\n\nTo cast this reproach upon the Revolution!\n\nThus to humiliate the Republic!\n\nWhile he, a man still in the bondage of prejudices and slavery,\nsuddenly assumed another form and re-entered the lists of humanity,\nthey, the champions of deliverance and freedom, would still remain\nplunged in civil war, with its routine of blood and fratricide!\n\nAnd they who fought on the side of error respected the supreme law of\ndivine forgiveness, of abnegation, of redemption, and of sacrifice,\nwhile for the soldiers of truth it had apparently ceased to exist!\n\nWhat! Was there to be no rivalry in magnanimity? Were they, who were\nnow in the ascendant, to resign themselves to defeat, to acknowledge\ntheir weakness, to take advantage of their victory, to commit murder,\nand to allow men to say that while the defenders of monarchy save\nlittle children, Republicans kill old men!\n\nThis grand soldier, this powerful octogenarian, this disarmed warrior,\nbetrayed rather than captured, seized in the very act of doing a good\ndeed, bound by his own consent, with the moisture of a superb devotion\nstill upon his brow, would be seen mounting the steps of the scaffold\nas if borne upward in an apotheosis; and they would offer to the knife\nthat head round which the three souls of the little angels he had saved\nwould hover in supplication! And standing face to face with a death so\ninfamous for the executioners, a smile would be seen on the face of\nthat man, while a blush of shame would overspread that of the Republic!\n\nAnd that was to take place in the presence of Gauvain, the chief!\n\nAnd he, possessing the power to prevent this,--was he to hold his\npeace? Was he to content himself with that haughty dismissal, \"You have\nno further concern in this matter,\" and not to realize that in a case\nlike this, abdication of authority was equivalent to complicity? And\ncould he not see that in a deed so outrageous, the coward who allows\nthe act is worse than the man who commits it? But had he not promised\nthat this death should take place? Had not he, Gauvain the merciful,\ndeclared that Lantenac was to be excluded from mercy, and that he would\ndeliver him to Cimourdain?\n\nThis head was a debt which he owed, and he paid it That was all.\n\nBut was this indeed the same head?\n\nHitherto Gauvain had seen in Lantenac nothing but a barbarous warrior,\nenslaved by the fanaticisms of royalty and feudality, the murderer\nof prisoners, an assassin let loose by war, a man of blood,--and of\nthat man he felt no fear; this proscriber of others he would himself\nproscribe; this relentless man would find him relentless also. Nothing\ncould be more simple; the road was already mapped out and terribly\nplain to follow; all had been anticipated; he who had killed others\nwas now to suffer the same fate; they were in the direct path of the\nhorrible. Suddenly this straight line changed; an unlooked for turn\nrevealed a new horizon, a transformation had been effected. Lantenac\nhad appeared on the scene in an unexpected character. A hero had\ncome forth from the monster; yea, one greater than a hero,--a man.\nSomething higher than a mind,--a heart. He stood before Gauvain no\nlonger a murderer, but a saviour. Gauvain was overwhelmed by a flood of\ncelestial light. Lantenac had felled him to the ground by a thunderbolt\nof virtue.\n\nAnd had not this transfigured Lantenac in his turn the power to\ntransfigure Gauvain? What! Was this flood of light to meet with no\nresponsive flash? Was the man of the past to lead the van of progress,\nand the man of the future to fall back to the rear? Was the man of\nbarbarism and superstition suddenly to spread his wings and soar\nupward, all the while gazing down at the man with the lofty ideal,\ngroping below him in the mire amid the murky shadows of the night?\nGauvain would lie prostrate in the savage old rut, while Lantenac\nsoared higher and higher in his new career!\n\nAnd another thing must be considered,--the family!\n\nThis blood that he was about to shed,--for to allow its shedding\namounted to the same as shedding it himself,--was not this his own\nblood? His grandfather was dead, it is true, but his great-uncle\nstill lived in the person of the Marquis de Lantenac. Would not he,\nwho already rested in the grave, rise to bar the entrance against his\nbrother? Would he not lay his command upon his grandson henceforth\nto pay the same veneration to that crown of white hair as to his own\nhalo? Would not the indignant glance of a departed spirit rise between\nGauvain and Lantenac?\n\nWas it then the object of Revolution to destroy the natural affections,\nto sever all family ties, and to stifle every sense of humanity? Far\nfrom it. The dawn of '89 came to affirm those higher truths, and not to\ndeny them. The destruction of bastilles signified the deliverance of\nhumanity; the overthrow of feudalism was the signal for the building\nup of the family. Since authority takes rise from and is centred in\nits author, there can be no real authority save in fatherhood; thus we\nsee the legitimacy of the queen-bee who gives birth to her subjects\nand combines the mother with the queen; and also the absurdity of the\nking-man, who not being the father, has no right to be the master;\nhence the suppression of the king, and the rise of the Republic. And\nwhat is the meaning of all this? It is family, humanity, revolution.\nRevolution is the accession of the people, and in reality The People is\nMan.\n\nIt had now become important to ascertain whether, since Lantenac had\nreturned to humanity, Gauvain would return to the family.\n\nThe question was whether the uncle and the nephew would meet again in\nthe higher light, or whether the decline of the nephew would correspond\nto the progress of the uncle.\n\nIn this pathetic struggle between Gauvain and his conscience\nthe question thus presented itself, and the answer seemed\ninstinctive,--Lantenac must be saved.\n\nYes--but France?\n\nHere the puzzling problem suddenly assumed a different aspect.\n\nWhat! France, at the last extremity, betrayed, exposed to attack on\nall sides, dismantled! Her moat was gone; Germany could cross the\nRhine: her walls were overthrown; Italy might leap over the Alps,\nand Spain over the Pyrenees. All that was left to her was the ocean,\nwhose infinite abyss was on her side. She could lean against it, and,\ngiantess as she was, supported by the expanse of the sea, fight the\nwhole world,--an invincible position one might well call it. But no:\nshe was on the point of losing this position. The ocean was no longer\nher own: England lay in this sea, though she knew not how to cross it.\nWell, there stood a man ready to throw a bridge across, to lend her a\nhelping hand,--a man who was about to say to Pitt, to Cornwallis, to\nDundas, to the pirates, \"Come!\" a man who would cry out, \"England, come\nover and seize upon France!\" and this man was the Marquis de Lantenac,\nwhom they now held in their grasp.\n\nAfter three months of an eager, passionate chase they had finally\nseized him. The hand of Revolution had swooped down upon the accursed\none, the clenched fist of '93 grasped the Royalist murderer by the\ncollar; and by one of those mysterious dispensations of Providence\nwhich enter into human affairs, it was in his own family dungeon that\nthe parricide now awaited his punishment,--the feudal lord lay in the\nfeudal oubliette; the stones of his own castle had risen and closed\nupon him. Thus he who would have betrayed his country was himself\nbetrayed by his own castle. God had visibly ordained all this; the hour\nof doom had struck, and Revolution had turned the key upon the public\nenemy. He could no longer fight, neither could he struggle nor work\nfurther harm. Of that Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, where there was no lack of arms, his\nalone was the brain: his death would be the signal for the close of\nthe war,--tragic climax ardently desired. After all the massacre and\ncarnage he had caused, the murderer was in their power, and doomed in\nhis turn to die.\n\nAnd was there a man who could wish to save him?\n\nCimourdain in the person of '93 held Lantenac, or, as one might call\nhim, the spirit of monarchy; and could a man be found to snatch that\nprey from these brazen talons? Lantenac, around whose name was\nbound that sheaf of scourges which men call the past, the Marquis de\nLantenac, was in the tomb; the heavy door of eternity had closed upon\nhim, and would one appear from without to draw back the bolt? This\nsocial malefactor was dead, and with him had perished revolt, the\nfratricidal struggle, the brutal war; and conceive of a man who would\nbring him back to life!\n\nOh, how that death's-head would laugh!\n\nThe spectre would exclaim, \"Good! I am still alive, you fools.\"\n\nWith what zeal he would begin his hideous work all over again! With\nwhat implacable rejoicing would he plunge again into the abyss of\nhatred and war! Not a day would pass before houses would be in flames,\nprisoners massacred, the wounded slain, women shot.\n\nAnd, after all, was it not possible that Gauvain exaggerated the deed\nthat so fascinated his imagination?\n\nThree children were in danger of death: Lantenac had saved them.\n\nBut who had imperilled their lives?\n\nWas it not Lantenac?\n\nWho had put their cradles in the fire?\n\nWas it not the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus?\n\nWho was the Im\u00c3\u00a2nus?\n\nThe lieutenant of the Marquis.\n\nIt is the chief who bears the responsibility.\n\nHence Lantenac was both the incendiary and the assassin.\n\nWhy then was his deed so admirable?\n\nHe had simply desisted from evil,--nothing more.\n\nHaving conceived the crime, he had recoiled before its presence; he\nwas horrified at himself. The mother's shriek had stirred within him\nthe dregs of human pity,--the deposit of universal life which exists\nin every soul, even in the most cruel. At this cry he had retraced his\nsteps; from the darkness towards which he was plunging he had turned\nback towards the light. Having committed the crime, he made haste to\nretrieve it. He had not continued a monster to the very end; herein lay\nall his merit.\n\nAnd in return for so small a thing was all to be restored to him,--his\nliberty, the fields and plains, the open air, daylight, the forest,\nwhich he would use for brigandage; his own freedom, that he might use\nit to plunge others into slavery; his own life, which he would devote\nto the death of his fellow-men?\n\nAs for trying to come to an understanding with him, as for attempting\nto treat with this arrogant soul, offering to save his life under\nconditions, to ask him whether he would agree, provided his life were\nspared, to abstain henceforth from hostility and revolt,--what a\nmistake would such an offer be, what an advantage it would give him,\nwith what scorn would he greet the proposal, how he would scourge the\nquestion by the answer! Hear him exclaim: \"Keep such indignities for\nyourselves! For my part, give me death!\"\n\nNothing could be done with such a man; he must either be set free\nor put to death. His was a rugged, inaccessible nature; ready for\nflight, ready for sacrifice,--it mattered not which. His strange soul\ndisplayed the characteristics of the eagle as well as of the precipice.\n\nTo kill him? Dreadful to contemplate! To set him free? What a\nresponsibility!\n\nSuppose Lantenac were saved, it would simply be a return to the\nbeginning of the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, like a struggle with a hydra, whose head\nis not yet severed. In the twinkling of an eye, like the flash of a\nmeteor, all the flames which expired when this man vanished, would\nbe rekindled. Lantenac would never rest until he had effected his\ndetestable plan,--to establish Monarchy like the lid of a tomb over\nthe Republic, and to give England control over France! He who would\nsave Lantenac must sacrifice France; Lantenac's life would be death\nto a multitude of innocent creatures,--men, women, and children,--who\nwould again become the prey of civil war; it meant the landing of the\nEnglish, the Revolution retarded, the cities sacked, the inhabitants\ndistracted, Brittany tom and bleeding; in short, it would be like\ntossing back his prey to the tiger's claws. And Gauvain, amid all this\nuncertain glimmering of cross-lights,--Gauvain, in-his reverie, caught\na vague glimpse of the problem as it gradually took form in his mind:\nthe setting at liberty of a tiger.\n\nAnd then the question resumed its former aspect; the stone of Sisyphus,\nwhich is nothing less than the conflict of man with his own conscience,\nrecoiled upon him. Was Lantenac then a tiger?\n\nOnce he may have been; but was he a tiger still? Gauvain grew dizzy\nwith conflicting thoughts,--thoughts which coiled themselves around\none another after the fashion of a snake. Could one, after mature\nconsideration, really deny the devotion of Lantenac, his stoical\nself-abnegation, his sublime disinterestedness? What! after he had\nshown his humanity in the very jaws of civil war? What! when in the\nconflict between inferior truths he had shown forth the truth that\nstands above all others? What! when he had proved that the deep\ntenderness of human nature, the protection that strength owes to\nweakness, the duty which binds every man who is saved to lend a helping\nhand to his perishing brother, the fatherhood which every old man owes\nto every little child, are above all principalities and revolutions,\nabove all earthly questions whatsoever,--when he had proved the truth\nof all these grand things, and proved it by the gift of his own head?\nWhat! general as he was, to have renounced strategy, battle, and\nrevenge? What! he, being a Royalist, had taken the scales, and placing\nin one end the King of France, the monarchy fifteen centuries old, the\nrestoration of ancient laws and the re-establishment of an old society,\nand in the other, three little unknown peasants, and had found the\nking, the throne, the sceptre, and the fifteen centuries of monarchy\nout-weighed by those innocent creatures?\n\nCould it be possible that all this was to count for nothing? Was he\nwho had done this to remain a tiger and be treated like a wild beast?\nNo, no, no! He was no monster, the man whose divine action had just\nillumined the abyss of civil war! The sword-bearer had been transformed\ninto a messenger of light. The infernal Satan had become once more\nthe heavenly Lucifer. Lantenac had expiated all his cruel deeds by\none act of sacrifice; his moral salvation had been attained by way of\nhis material ruin; he had returned to a state of innocence; he had\nsigned his own pardon. Does Hot the right of self-forgiveness exist?\nHenceforth he was an object for veneration.\n\nLantenac had just proved himself a remarkable man. It was now Gauvain's\nturn to make fitting response.\n\nThe struggle between the passions of good and evil was fast converting\nthe world into chaos; Lantenac, dominating this same chaos, had set\nhumanity free, and now it was left for Gauvain to assert the rights of\nthe family.\n\nWhat was he about to do?\n\nWas he to betray God's trust?\n\nNo. And he muttered to himself: Lantenac must be saved.\n\nWell, then, go your way; connive with the English, desert your country,\nally yourself with her enemy! Save Lantenac and betray France!\n\nHere he shuddered.\n\nDreamer that thou art, this is no solution! and Gauvain fancied he saw\nin the shadow the baleful smile of the sphinx.\n\nThis combination of circumstances was like a platform whereon\nconflicting truths had taken their stand, ready for the encounter, and\nwhere the three loftiest principles of mankind--humanity, family, and\ncountry--stood face to face.\n\nEach of these voices spoke in turn, and each one spoke the truth.\nHow was a man to choose? Each one by turns seemed to have discovered\nthe point of union between justice and wisdom, and said, \"Act thus.\"\nMust he obey this voice? Yes. No. Reason suggested one thing,\nsentiment another; and their counsels were diametrically opposed.\nLogic is nothing more than reason; sentiment is often the voice of the\nconscience: the one comes from man, the other from above.\n\nHence the perceptions of sentiment are less clear, but wield a stronger\ninfluence.\n\nBut what a power dwells in stern reason!\n\nGauvain hesitated.\n\nTorturing perplexities!\n\nTwo abysses opened before Gauvain,--to destroy the Marquis, or to save\nhim? Into one or the other he must needs plunge. Towards which of these\ntwo did duty call him?\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nTHE COMMANDER'S HOOD.\n\n\nThe question had indeed resolved itself in a matter of duty.\n\nDuty arose stem-visaged and immutable before the spirit of Cimourdain,\nand terrible before that of Gauvain.\n\nSimple to the one; complex, many-sided, devious, to the other.\n\nThe hour of midnight sounded; then one o'clock.\n\nWithout realizing where he was going, Gauvain had unconsciously\napproached the entrance of the breach.\n\nThe light of the expiring fire cast now but a dim reflection. The\nplateau on the other side of the tower caught the light and became\nvisible for an instant only, to vanish as the clouds of smoke obscured\nthe flames. This light, with its unexpected flashes and sudden\ndarkening shadows, exaggerated the surrounding objects and gave to the\nsentinels of the camp the effect of phantoms. Gauvain, lost in thought,\nunconsciously watched the alternations of smoke and flame. There seemed\nto him a strange analogy between these changes of light and shade and\nthe varied phases of truth in his own mind.\n\nSuddenly, between two clouds of smoke, a flame burst forth from the bed\nof dying coals, threw a brilliant light on the summit of the plateau,\nand revealed the red outlines of a wagon. Gauvain gazed upon it. It was\nsurrounded by horsemen wearing the hats of gendarmes. He concluded that\nthis must be the same one that he had seen through Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ's spy-glass\nagainst the horizon a few hours before, just as the sun was setting.\nThere were men on the wagon who appeared to be unloading it. The object\nwhich they were removing seemed heavy, and at times the clanking of\niron could be heard; it would have been difficult to say what it was.\nIt seemed to be wood-work; two of the men lowered from the wagon and\nplaced on the ground a case, which, judging from its shape, might\ncontain some triangular object. The flame died out, and everything was\ndark again; Gauvain, wrapped in thought, gazed steadily before him upon\nthat object now hidden by the darkness.\n\nLanterns were lighted, and men could be seen moving to and fro on the\nplateau; but the outlines were indistinct, and moreover, Gauvain,\nstanding as he did, and on the opposite side of the ravine, could only\ndiscern those objects which were close to the edge.\n\nHe could hear the voices, but not the words. Now and then he caught\nthe echo of hammering upon the wood. He could also hear a grinding,\nmetallic sound, like the sharpening of a scythe.\n\nIt struck two.\n\nSlowly, and like one who would from choice take two steps forward and\nthree back, Gauvain advanced towards the breach. On his approach, the\nsentinel, recognizing in the dusk the commander's cloak and braided\nhood, presented arms. Gauvain entered the hall on the lower floor,\nwhich had been transformed into a guard-room. A lantern hung from the\nceiling, and cast just light enough so that one could cross the hall\nwithout treading on the men, most of whom lay upon the straw, sound\nasleep.\n\nThere they lay, on the spot where but a few hours since they had\nbeen fighting. The grape-shot, from the careless sweeping, still lay\nscattered about beneath them, and was not very comfortable to sleep on;\nbut weary as they were, they could sleep in spite of it This hall had\nbeen the terrible spot: here the assault had been made; yonder men had\nroared, howled, gnashed their teeth, given blow for blow, struck down\nthe enemy, and in their turn expired; many of their men had fallen dead\nupon this floor where they were now slumbering; the same straw on which\nthey slept had been drenched with the blood of their comrades. Now all\nwas ended; all the blood was stanched and the sabres dried, the dead\nwere dead, peacefully slumbering. Such is war; and it may be no longer\nthan to-morrow before every man among them will sleep the same sleep.\nOn Gauvain's entrance some of the sleepers rose, among them the officer\nin command. Pointing to the door of the dungeon, Gauvain said to him,--\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\nThe bolts were drawn, and the door opened.\n\nGauvain entered the dungeon.\n\nThe door closed behind him.\n\n\n[Illustration: Feudality and Revolution. 132]\n\nBOOK VII.\n\nFEUDALITY AND REVOLUTION.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nTHE ANCESTOR.\n\n\n[Illustration 133]\n\n\nA lamp stood on the flags of the dungeon, beside the square air-hole of\nthe oubliette.\n\nThere was also to be seen a jug of water, a loaf of army bread, and a\ntruss of straw. As the dungeon was cut out of solid rock, any prisoner\nwho conceived the idea of setting the straw on fire would have had his\nlabor for his pains,--no risk of a conflagration for the prison, and\ncertain suffocation for the prisoner.\n\nWhen the door turned on its hinges, the Marquis was walking up and down\nin his prison, with that mechanical pacing to and fro peculiar to caged\nwild animals.\n\nAt the sound of the opening and closing door, he looked up, and the\nlight from the lamp that stood on the floor between Gauvain and himself\nstruck full upon the faces of both men.\n\nThey looked at each other with such an expression that each stood there\nas if transfixed.\n\nThe Marquis burst out laughing and exclaimed:\n\n\"Good-evening, sir. Many years have passed since I have had the\npleasure of meeting you. You honor me by your visit. I thank you.\nNothing could please me more than a little conversation, for I was\nbeginning, to be bored. Your friends are wasting their time,--proofs\nof identity, court-martials, all those ceremonies are tedious. Were\nit my affair I should proceed more rapidly. I am at home here. Will\nyou be good enough to come in. Well, what do you think of the present\nstate of affairs? It is original, is it not? Once upon a time there was\na king and queen in France; the king was the king; France herself was\nthe queen. They have cut off the king's head and married the queen to\nRobespierre; and to this pair a daughter has been born,--they call her\nGuillotine, and it seems that I am to make her acquaintance to-morrow\nmorning. I shall be as pleased to meet her as I am to meet you. Is that\nperchance the object of your visit? Have you been promoted? Shall you\nofficiate as headsman? But if this be simply a visit of friendship,\nI feel grateful. You may perhaps have forgotten, Viscount, what a\nnobleman is? Allow me to present you to one. Behold me; it has become a\nrare specimen; it believes in God, in tradition, and in the family; it\nbelieves in its ancestors, in the example of its father, in fidelity,\nin loyalty, in its duty towards its princes, in reverence for ancient\nlaws, in virtue and in justice; and it would order you to be shot\nwith much pleasure. Will you do me the favor to take a seat? I must\nask you to sit upon the floor, since there is no arm-chair in this\nsalon; but he who dwells in the mire may well sit upon the ground. I\ndo not say this to offend you, for that which is mire in our esteem,\nrepresents the nation in your eyes. You will not, of course, require\nme to shout for Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity? This is an old room\nin my house, where in former times the lords used to imprison their\npeasants; nowadays, it is the peasants who imprison the lords. And\nthese follies men call revolution! It seems that my head is to be cut\noff in thirty-six hours. I have no objection to offer; still, had they\nbeen well-bred they would have sent me my snuff-box, which is upstairs\nin the mirror-chamber, where you used to play when you were a child,\nand where I have dandled you on my knee. Sir, let me tell you one\nthing: your name is Gauvain, and strange as it may seem, you have noble\nblood in your veins,--yes, _pardieu_! the very same blood that flows\nin mine; and this blood which has made a man of honor of me, has made\nof you a scoundrel. Such are the idiosyncrasies of the human race! You\nwill tell me that it is not your fault. Nor is it mine. _Parbleu_! one\nmay be a rascal unconsciously. It depends upon the air one breathes.\nIn times like ours, no man is responsible for what he does; revolution\nis the scapegoat for all mankind, for your great criminals are supreme\ninnocents. What blockheads! To begin with yourself. Allow me to admire\nyou. Yes, I admire a youth like yourself, who, well-born, with an\nexcellent position in State affairs, possessing noble blood fit to\nbe shed in a noble cause, Viscount of this Tower-Gauvain, Prince of\nBrittany, a duke in his own right, belonging to the hereditary peerage\nof France,--which is about all that a sensible man can desire here\nbelow,--a youth who, being such as he is, amuses himself by playing a\npart like yours, until his enemies believe him a scoundrel, and his\nfriends regard him as an idiot! By the way, give my regards to the Abb\u00c3\u00a9\nCimourdain.\"\n\nPerfectly at his ease, the Marquis spoke slowly and calmly, without\nemphasis, in his society voice, his eyes clear and tranquil, and with\nboth hands in his waistcoat pockets. He paused, took a long breath, and\nthen continued:--\n\n\"I do not conceal from you that I have done all in my power to kill\nyou. As I stand before you, I have three times in person aimed a cannon\nat you. A discourteous proceeding, I confess, but it would be relying\nupon a false maxim did we allow ourselves to fancy that in time of war\nthe enemy proposes to make himself agreeable. For we are in a state of\nwar, nephew. Everything is put to fire and sword, and they have killed\nthe king besides. A fine century!\"\n\nHe paused again, then continued:--\n\n\"And when one thinks that none of these things would have happened if\nthey had hung Voltaire and sent Rousseau to the galleys! Ah, those men\nof intellect! What a scourge they were! For what crime did you reproach\nthe Monarchy? The Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Pucelle was sent to his Abbey of Corbigny,\nit is true, allowing him the choice of conveyance and as much time\nas he required in the journey; and as for your Monsieur Titon, who\nwas--begging your pardon--a wretched libertine, who visited abandoned\nwomen before going to the miracles of Deacon P\u00c3\u00a2ris, he was transferred\nfrom Vincennes to the fortress of Ham in Picardy, which is, I admit,\nrather a disagreeable place. Those are your grievances; I remember\nthem, for I too inveighed against them in my day. I have been as stupid\nas you.\"\n\nThe Marquis fumbled in his pocket as though he expected to find his\nsnuff-box; then he continued:\n\n\"But not so wicked. We talked for the sake of talking. There was,\nmoreover, the mutiny of demands and petitions; and then those\ngentlemen the philosophers appeared upon the scene, whose works they\nburned,--they would have done better had they burned the authors:\nCourt intrigues were mixed up in the affair. Then came all the dunces,\nTurgot, Quesnay, Malesherbes, the physiocratists, and so forth, and the\nwrangling began. All this was the work of scribblers and rhymsters.\nThe Encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia! Diderot! D'Alembert! Ah! the malicious scamps! Fancy\na well-born man like the King of Prussia joining hands with them! I\nwould have made short work with all those paper-scribblers. Ah! we know\nhow to administer justice; you can see here, on this wall, the mark\nof the quartering-wheels. There was no jesting in the matter. No, no;\nlet us abolish scribblers! So long as there are Arouets there will be\nMarats. So long as there are men who scribble, there will be wretches\nwho murder; while there is ink, there will be black stains; so long as\nmen's claws can hold a goose-quill, frivolous nonsense will engender\natrocious follies. Books are the authors of crime. The word 'chimera'\nhas a double signification,--it means a dream and it means a monster.\nWhat a price one pays for all this idle nonsense! What is it you keep\nrepeating to us about your rights,--the rights of man, the rights of\nthe people! Has it any sense whatever? Could anything be more stupid,\nutterly imaginary, and devoid of meaning! When I state the fact that\nHavoise, the sister of Conan II., brought the Comt\u00c3\u00a9 of Bretagne to\nHo\u00c3\u00abl, Count of Nantes and of Cornwall, from whom the estate descended\nto Alain Fergant, the uncle of that Bertha who married Alain le Noir,\nlord of Roche-sur-Yon, and bore unto him Conan le Petit, grandfather\nof Guy or Gauvain de Thouars our ancestor,--I make a plain statement,\nand claim my rights. But the knaves, the rascals, the scoundrels of\nyour party, what rights do they claim? Deicide and regicide. Is it\nnot frightful? Ah! the ragamuffins! I am sorry for you, sir; still,\nyou come of that proud Breton blood; you and I have a Gauvain de\nThouars for our grandfather, and furthermore we have an ancestor in\nthat famous Duke de Montbazon, a peer of France and decorated with the\nGrand Collar, who attacked the Faubourg de Tours and was wounded at\nthe battle of Arques, and who died Grand-veneur of France in his house\nof Couzi\u00c3\u00a8res in Touraine at the age of eighty-six. I could tell you\nof the Duke of Laudunois, son of the Lady de la Garnache, of Claude\nde Lorraine, of the Duke de Chevreuse, of Henri do Lenoncourt, and\nof Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise de Laval-Boisdauphin. But to what purpose? Monsieur has\nthe honor of being an idiot, and he delights to lower himself to the\nlevel of my groom. Learn this: I was already an old man when you were\nstill a nursing infant. I watched you, and I would watch you still. As\nyou grew up you succeeded in degrading yourself. Since we ceased to\nmeet, each of us has followed his inclinations; mine have led me in\nthe direction of honesty, while your course has been the very reverse.\nAh! I know not how all this will end; but your friends are consummate\nvillains. Oh, yes, I acknowledge it is all very fine, the progress\nis marvellous; they have done away in the army with the punishment\nof the pint of water, inflicted for three days in succession, on\ndrunken soldiers; they have the maximum, the Convention, Bishop Gobel,\nMonsieur Chaumette, and Monsieur H\u00c3\u00a9bert; there has been a wholesale\nextermination of the past, from the Bastille to the calendar. The\nsaints are replaced by vegetables. Very well, citizens; be our masters\nif you will, reign over us, take your ease, act your good pleasure,\nstand upon no ceremony. All that will not prevent religion from being\nreligion, nor alter the fact that royalty has occupied fifteen hundred\nyears of our history, and that the old French nobility, even though\nbeheaded, stands higher than you. And as to your sophistries concerning\nthe historical right of royal races, what care we for that matter?\nChilp\u00c3\u00a9ric was really nothing but a monk by the name of Daniel; it was\nRainfroi who invented Chilp\u00c3\u00a9ric to annoy Charles Martel,--we know that\nas well as you. That is not the question. The question is this: that\nthere shall be a great kingdom, old France, a well-regulated country,\nwhere men consider first the sacred person of the monarchs, absolute\nrulers of the State, then the princes, then the officers of the crown,\nnaval and military, as well as the controllers of finance. Then there\nare the officers of justice of the different grades, followed by those\nof the salt-tax and the general receipts, and finally the police of\nthe kingdom in its three orders. All this was fine and well-regulated;\nyou have destroyed it. You have destroyed the provinces, without even\nunderstanding--so great was your ignorance,--what the provinces were.\nThe genius of France was made up from that of the entire continent,\nand each of its provinces represents a special virtue of Europe; the\nfrankness of Germany is to be found in Picardy, the generosity of\nSweden in Champagne, the industry of Holland in Burgundy, the activity\nof Poland in Languedoc, the grave dignity of Spain in Gascony, the\nwisdom of Italy in Provence, the subtlety of Greece in Normandy, the\nfidelity of Switzerland in Dauphiny. You knew nothing of all this;\nyou have broken, shattered, crushed, demolished, behaving like stupid\nbeasts of the field. So you wish to have no more nobles? Very well, you\nshall have none. Prepare your mourning. Your paladins and heroes have\ndeparted. Bid farewell to all the ancient glories. Find me a D'Assas\nat the present time, if you can! You are all trembling for your skins.\nYou will have no more Chevaliers de Fontenoy who saluted the enemy\nbefore killing him; you will have no more combatants in silk stockings\nlike those at the siege of L\u00c3\u00a9rida; you will have no more of those days\nof military glory when plumes flashed by like meteors; your days are\nnumbered; the outrage of invasion will descend upon you. If Alain II.\nwere to return, he would no longer find a Clovis to confront him; if\nAbd\u00c3\u00a9rame were to come back, he would encounter no such foe as Charles\nMartel; neither would the Saxons find a P\u00c3\u00a9pin waiting for them. You\nwill have no Agnadel, Rocroy, Lens, Staffarde, Nerwinde, Steinkerque,\nLa Marsaille, Raucoux, Lawfeld, Mahon; you will never have another\nMarignan with Francis I.; nor a Bouvines with Philip-Augustus, who\ntook Renaud, Count of Boulogne, prisoner with one hand, while with the\nother he held Ferrand, Count of Flanders. You will have Agincourt, but\nyou will not have the great standard-bearer, the Sieur de Bacqueville,\nwrapping himself in his banner to die. Go on, go on, accomplish your\nwork! Be the new men. Dwarf yourselves!\"\n\nHere the Marquis paused a moment; then he continued:--\n\n\"But leave to us our greatness. Kill the kings, kill nobles and\npriests, if you will; sow broadcast over the land destruction, ruin,\nand death; trample all things under foot; set your heel upon the\nancient laws, overthrow the throne, stamp upon the altar of your God,\nand dance over the ruins. All rests with you, cowards and traitors as\nyou are, incapable of self-devotion and sacrifice. I have said all that\nI have to say. Now have me guillotined, Monsieur le Vicomte. I have the\nhonor to be your most humble servant.\"\n\nThen he added,--\n\n\"It is but the truth. What difference can it make to me? I am dead.\"\n\n\"You are free,\" said Gauvain.\n\nAnd he advanced towards the Marquis, unfastened his commander's-cloak,\nand throwing it over the shoulders of the latter, he drew the hood down\nover his eyes. Both men were of the same height.\n\n\"What is this that you are doing?\" said the Marquis.\n\nGauvain raised his voice and called out,--\n\n\"Lieutenant, open to me!\"\n\nThe door was opened.\n\nGauvain cried,--\n\n\"You will be careful to close the door behind me.\"\n\nAnd he pushed the astonished Marquis across the threshold.\n\nIt must be remembered that the low hall which had been turned into a\nguard-room was lighted by a horn lantern, whose dim rays served only to\ndeepen the shadows; it threw an uncertain glimmer on the surrounding\nobjects, and in this indistinct light those of the soldiers who were\nnot sleeping saw a tall man walk past them towards the entrance,\nwrapped in the cloak and braided hood of the commander-in-chief. The\nsoldiers saluted him as he passed out.\n\nThe Marquis slowly crossed the guard-room and the breach,--not without\nhitting his head more than once,--and went out. The sentinel, supposing\nthat it was Gauvain whom he saw, presented arms.\n\nOnce outside, within two hundred steps of the forest, feeling the turf\nbeneath his feet, and space, the protecting night, liberty, and life\nbefore him, he paused and stood for a moment motionless, like a man who\nhas allowed himself to be influenced, has been overcome by surprise,\nand who, having taken advantage of an open door, asks himself whether\nhe has acted nobly or ignobly, and hesitates before going on,--giving\near, as it were, to an afterthought. After some moments of deep\nreverie, he raised his right hand, and snapping his thumb and finger,\ncried,--\n\n\"Faith!\"\n\nAnd he went on.\n\nThe door of the prison had closed again, and this time it was upon\nGauvain.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nTHE COURT-MARTIAL.\n\n\nNearly all the court-martials of this period were arbitrary tribunals.\nIn the Legislative Assembly, Dumas had drawn up a rough plan of\nmilitary legislation, afterwards improved by Talbot in the Council of\nthe Five Hundred, but the final code of councils of war was not drawn\nup until the time of the Empire. From that time also, be it mentioned\nby way of parenthesis, dates the law imposed on military tribunals in\nregard to the taking of votes, that of beginning with the lower grade.\nThis law was not in existence during the Revolution.\n\nIn 1793, the president of a military tribunal might almost be said to\npersonify the tribunal itself; he elected the members, arranged the\norder of the ranks and regulated the method of voting; he was master\nas well as judge.\n\nCimourdain had selected the identical room on the ground-floor where\nthe _retirade_ had been, and where the guard was now posted, for\nthe judgment-hall of the court-martial. He was anxious to shorten\neverything,--the road from the prison to the tribunal, and the passage\nfrom the tribunal to the scaffold.\n\nIn accordance with his orders, the court opened its session at noon\nwith no more display of ceremonial than three straw chairs, a pine\ntable, two lighted candies, and a stool placed in front of the table.\n\nThe chairs were for the judges and the stool was for the prisoner.\nAt each end of the table stood another stool, one for the\ncommissioner-auditor, who was a quartermaster, and the other for the\nclerk, who was a corporal.\n\nOn the table there was a stick of red sealing-wax, a copper seal of\nthe Republic, two inkstands, bundles of white paper, and two printed\nplacards, spread wide open,--one containing the sentence of outlawry,\nthe other, the decree of the Convention.\n\nThe middle chair was pushed back against a group of tricolored flags;\nin those times of rude simplicity, decorations were quickly arranged,\nand but little time was needed to change a guard-hall into a court of\njustice. The middle chair, intended for the president, faced the prison\ndoor.\n\nThe audience was composed of soldiers.\n\nTwo gendarmes stood on guard beside the stool.\n\nCimourdain was seated in the middle chair, with Captain Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, the\nfirst judge, on his right, and Sergeant Radoub, the second, on his left.\n\nHe wore a hat with tricolored plumes, a sabre by his side, and two\npistols on his belt. His scar, of a vivid red, increased the ferocity\nof his appearance.\n\nRadoub had at last consented to allow his wounds to be dressed. He\nwore a handkerchief tied round his head, on which a blood-stain was\ngradually extending.\n\nAt noon, before the Court opened, a messenger stood beside the table\nof the tribunal, while his horse impatiently pawed the ground outside.\nCimourdain was writing; and this was what he wrote:--\n\n\"_Citizen members of the Com. of Public Safety:_\"\n\n\"Lantenac is taken. He will be executed to-morrow.\"\n\nAfter dating and signing the despatch he folded and sealed it, and then\nhanded it to the messenger, who took his leave.\n\nWhereupon Cimourdain said in a loud voice,--\n\n\"Open the dungeon.\"\n\nTwo gendarmes drew back the bolts, opened the dungeon, and went in.\n\nCimourdain raised his head, crossed his arms, glanced at the door, and\nexclaimed:--\n\n\"Bring forth the prisoner!\"\n\nBeneath the archway of the open door appeared a man between the two\ngendarmes.\n\nIt was Gauvain.\n\nCimourdain started.\n\n\"Gauvain!\" he cried\n\nThen continued:--\n\n\"I demand the prisoner.\"\n\n\"It is I,\" said Gauvain.\n\n\"Thou?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"And Lantenac?\"\n\n\"He is free.\"\n\n\"Free?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Escaped?\"\n\n\"Escaped.\"\n\nCimourdain trembled as he murmured:--\n\n\"True, it is his own castle, he is familiar with all its outlets; the\ncrypt perhaps communicates with one of them. I ought to have thought of\nthis; he probably found means of escape; he would need no help.\"\n\n\"He has been helped,\" said Gauvain.\n\n\"To escape?\"\n\n\"To escape.\"\n\n\"Who helped him?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"Thou?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"Thou art dreaming.\"\n\n\"I went into the dungeon, I was alone with the prisoner, I took off my\ncloak and wrapped it about him, I drew the hood over his face; he went\nout in my stead, while I remained in his. Here I am.\"\n\n\"Thou hast not done this?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"It is impossible.\"\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\n\"Bring me Lantenac.\"\n\n\"He is no longer here. The soldiers, seeing the commander's-cloak, took\nhim for me and allowed him to pass. It was still dark.\"\n\n\"Thou art mad.\"\n\n\"I tell you what happened.\"\n\nA silence ensued. Cimourdain stammered:--\n\n\"Then thou deservest--\"\n\n\"Death,\" said Gauvain.\n\nCimourdain was as pale as a corpse, and as motionless as a man who\nhas been struck by lightning. He seemed to have lost the power of\nbreathing. A great drop of sweat formed upon his forehead.\n\nHe controlled his voice, forcing himself to speak firmly as he said:--\n\n\"Gendarmes, seat the accused.\"\n\nGauvain took his seat on the stool.\n\nCimourdain continued:--\n\n\"Gendarmes, draw your sabres.\"\n\nThis was the usual formula when the accused was under sentence of death.\n\nThe gendarmes bared their sabres.\n\nCimourdain's voice regained its ordinary tone.\n\n\"Accused,\" he said, \"rise.\"\n\nHe no longer used the familiar \"thee\" and \"thou.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nTHE VOTES.\n\nGauvain rose.\n\n\"What is your name?\" asked Cimourdain.\n\n\"Gauvain,\" was the reply.\n\nCimourdain went on with the interrogatory:--\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am commander-in-chief of the expeditionary column of the\nC\u00c3\u00b4tes-du-Nord.\"\n\n\"Are you a kinsman or connection of the man who has escaped?\"\n\n\"I am his great-nephew.\"\n\n\"Are you acquainted with the decree of the Convention?\"\n\n\"I see the placard on your table.\"\n\n\"What have you to say in regard to this decree?\"\n\n\"That I have countersigned it, and have ordered its execution; that it\nwas I who had that placard written, to which my name is affixed.\"\n\n\"Choose your defender.\"\n\n\"I will defend myself.\"\n\n\"You may speak.\"\n\nCimourdain had become impassible. Only his impassibility was more like\nthe calmness of a rock than that of a man.\n\nFor a moment Gauvain remained silent and thoughtful.\n\nCimourdain continued:--\n\n\"What have you to say in your defence?\"\n\nGauvain slowly raised his head, and without looking at any one,\nreplied:--\n\n\"This: one thing has prevented me from seeing another. A good deed,\nviewed too near at hand, hid from my sight hundreds of criminal\nactions; on the one side, an aged man, on the other, children,--all\nthis interfered between me and my duty. I forgot the burning villages,\nthe ravaged fields, the massacred prisoners, the wounded cruelly put\nto death, the women shot; I forgot France betrayed to England: I have\nset at liberty the country's murderer. I am guilty. When I speak thus I\nseem to speak against myself, but it is not so; I am speaking in my own\nbehalf. When he who is guilty acknowledges his fault, he saves the only\nthing worth saving--honor.\"\n\n\"Is this all you have to say in your defence?\" returned Cimourdain.\n\n\"I will add, that being the commander I should have set an example, and\nthat you in turn as judges must offer one.\"\n\n\"What example do you require of us?\"\n\n\"My death.\"\n\n\"You think it just?\"\n\n\"And necessary.\"\n\n\"Take your seat.\"\n\nThe quartermaster, who was commissioner-auditor, rose and read, first\nthe decree pronouncing the sentence of outlawry against the ci-devant\nMarquis de Lantenac; second, that of the Convention sentencing to\ndeath any one whomsoever who should aid or abet the escape of a rebel\nprisoner. He ended with the few lines printed at the bottom of the\nplacard, forbidding men to \"aid or abet\" the rebel aforesaid, \"under\npenalty of death,\" and signed: \"Commander-in-chief of the expeditionary\ncolumn, GAUVAIN.\" The reading ended, the auditor-commissioner again\ntook his scat.\n\nCimourdain, crossing his arms, said:--\n\n\"Attention, accused, and let the public listen, look on, and keep\nsilence. The law lies before you. It will be put to vote. The sentence\nwill be determined by the vote of the majority. Each judge will in\nturn pronounce his decision aloud, in the presence of the accused; for\njustice has nothing to conceal.\"\n\nCimourdain continued,--\n\n\"Let the first judge cast his vote. Speak, Captain Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ.\"\n\nCaptain Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ seemed unconscious of the presence either of Gauvain\nor Cimourdain. His eyes, riveted upon the placard of the decree, as if\nhe were absorbed in the contemplation of an abyss, were hidden by his\ndowncast lids. He said:--\n\n\"The law is clearly defined. The judge is more and less than a\nman,--less than a man, inasmuch as he has no heart; more than a man,\nin that he wields the sword. In the year 414 of the building of the\ncity of Rome, Manlius put his son to death because he gained a victory\nwithout waiting for orders. That infraction of discipline required an\nexpiation. Here, the law has been violated; and the law stands higher\nthan discipline. A man has been overcome by the emotion of pity, and\nthe country is once more endangered. Pity may rise to the level of\na crime. Commander Gauvain has connived at the escape of the rebel\nLantenac. Gauvain is guilty. I vote for death.\"\n\n\"Write it down, clerk,\" said Cimourdain.\n\nThe clerk wrote, \"Captain Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ: death.\"\n\nGauvain said in a firm voice,--\n\n\"Gu\u00c3\u00a9champ, you have voted well; I thank you.\"\n\nCimourdain continued,--\n\n\"It is the turn of the second judge. Speak, Sergeant Radoub.\"\n\nRadoub rose, and turning towards Gauvain, he made the military salute,\nexclaiming,--\n\n\"If that is the way things are going, then guillotine me; for upon my\nmost sacred word of honor, I would like to have done, first, what the\nold man did, and then what my commander did. When I beheld that man of\neighty rushing into the flames to save the three midgets, I said to\nmyself, 'Good man, you are a brave fellow!' And since I hear that it\nwas my commander who saved this old man from your beastly guillotine,\nby all that is holy, I say, 'Commander, you ought to be the general;\nand you are a true man; and by thunder, I would give you the Cross of\nSaint-Louis if there were any crosses or saints or Louises left!' Are\nwe going to make idiots of ourselves, for pity's sake? I should say\nso, if this is to be the result of winning the battles of Jemmapes,\nValmy, Fleurus, and Wattignies. What! here is Commander Gauvain, who\nfor these four months past has been driving those donkeys of Royalists\nto the sound of the drum, who saves the Republic by his sword, and who\ndid something at Dol that needed brains to accomplish it; and when\nyou have a man like that, you try to get rid of him, and instead of\nmaking him your general you propose to cut his throat! I say that it is\nenough to make one throw one's self head-foremost from the Pont-Neuf!\nand if you, citizen Gauvain, were only a corporal instead of being my\ncommander, I would tell you that you talked a heap of nonsense just\nnow. The old man did well when he saved the children, you did well\nto save the old man; and if men are to be guillotined for their good\nactions, then we might as well go to the deuce; and I am sure I don't\nknow what it all means. There is nothing to depend upon. This must be\na sort of dream, isn't it? I pinch myself to see if I am really awake.\nI don't understand. So the old man ought to have let the midgets burn\nalive, and my commander did wrong to save the old man's head? See here!\nguillotine me; I wish you would! Suppose the midgets had died; then\nthe battalion of the Bonnet-Rouge would have been dishonored. Is that\nwhat they wanted? If that is the case, then let us destroy one another.\nI know as much about politics as you do, for I belonged to the Club\nof the Section of the Pikes. Sapristi! we are getting to be no better\nthan the brutes! In a word, this is the way I look at it. I don't like\nsuch an upsetting state of affairs. Why the devil do we risk our lives?\nSo that our chief may be put to death. None of that, Lisette! I want\nmy chief; I must have my chief. I love him better to-day than I did\nyesterday. You make me laugh when you say that he is to be guillotined.\nWe'll have nothing of the sort. I have listened. You may say what you\nplease; but let me tell you in the first place, it is impossible.\"\n\nAnd Radoub took his seat. His wound had reopened. A thin stream of\nblood oozed from under the bandage, from the place where his ear had\nbeen, and ran along his neck.\n\nCimourdain turned towards Radoub.\n\n\"You vote that the accused be acquitted?\"\n\n\"I vote to have him made general,\" replied Radoub.\n\n\"I ask you whether you vote for his acquittal.\"\n\n[Illustration 134]\n\n\"I vote that he be made the head of the Republic.\"\n\n\"Sergeant Radoub, do you, or do you not, vote for Captain Gauvain's\nacquittal? Yes, or no?\"\n\n\"I vote that you behead me in his place.\"\n\n\"Acquittal,\" said Cimourdain. \"Write it down, clerk.\"\n\nThen the clerk announced,--\n\n\"One vote for death, one for acquittal: a tie.\"\n\nIt was Cimourdain's turn to vote.\n\nHe rose, took off his hat, and placed it on the table. He was no longer\npale or livid; his face was the color of clay.\n\nHad every man present been lying in his shroud, the silence could not\nhave been more profound.\n\nIn solemn, measured tones Cimourdain said,--\n\n\"Gauvain, the accused, your case has been heard. The court-martial, in\nthe name of the Republic, by a majority of two against one--\"\n\nHe broke off; he seemed to pause. Was he still doubtful whether to\nvote for death or for life? The audience was breathless. Cimourdain\nwent on,--\n\n\"--condemns you to the penalty of death.\"\n\nHis face revealed the torture of an awful triumph. When Jacob in the\ndarkness forced a blessing from the angel whom he had overthrown, he\nmust have worn the same terrible smile.\n\nIt passed like a flash, however, and Cimourdain again became marble. He\ntook his seat, replaced his hat on his head, and added,--\n\n\"Gauvain, you will be executed to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\nGauvain rose, bowed, and said,--\n\n\"I thank the court.\"\n\n\"Remove the prisoner,\" said Cimourdain; and at a sign from him the door\nof the dungeon was reopened, Gauvain entered, and it closed behind him.\nTwo gendarmes with drawn sabres were stationed on each side of the door.\n\nRadoub, who had just fallen senseless, was carried away.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nAFTER CIMOURDAIN THE JUDGE, CIMOURDAIN THE MASTER.\n\n\nA camp is a wasps nest, especially in time of revolution. The civic\nsting which exists in the soldier darts forth at a moments notice, and\nafter driving out the enemy, will often turn without ceremony upon its\nown chief. The brave army which had taken the Tourgue was alive with\nconflicting rumors. When first the escape of Lantenac was discovered,\nit was all against Gauvain; but when the latter was seen coming out of\nthe dungeon where they had supposed Lantenac to be imprisoned, it was\nlike the transmission of an electric spark, and in less than a minute\nthe whole army knew of it. A murmur broke forth from the little band;\nat first it ran: \"They are getting ready to try Gauvain. But it is all\na farce. He is a fool who trusts these ci-devants and calotins! We\nhave just seen a Viscount save a Marquis, and presently we shall see a\npriest acquit a noble!\"\n\nWhen the condemnation of Gauvain became known, there was a second\nmurmur: \"That is an outrage! Our chief, our brave chief, our young\ncommander, a hero! He is a Viscount, to be sure, but so much more to\nhis credit that he is also a Republican! What, he, the liberator of\nPontorson, of Villedieu, of Pont-au-Beau: the conqueror of Dol and\nof the Tourgue! the man who has made us invincible! the sword of the\nRepublic in the Vend\u00c3\u00a9e,--he who for five months holds his own against\nthe Chouans, and corrects all the blunders of L\u00c3\u00a9chelle and others! And\nCimourdain dares to condemn him! Wherefore? Because he saved an old\nman who had rescued three children! Does it become a priest to put a\nsoldier to death?\"\n\nThus murmured the victorious and dissatisfied camp. On every side a\ndull sense of anger prevailed against Cimourdain. Four thousand men\nagainst one might be supposed to constitute a power; but it does not.\nThese four thousand men were nothing more than a crowd; Cimourdain was\na will. They all knew that his frown was easily provoked, and this\nknowledge sufficed to hold the army in awe. In those times it needed\nbut the shadow of the Committee of Public Safety behind a man to make\nhim formidable, and to convert an imprecation into a whisper, and\nthat whisper into silence. Before, as well as after their murmuring,\nCimourdain was absolute master of the fate of all, as well as of that\nof Gauvain. They knew that it would be vain to entreat him; that he\nwould listen only to his conscience,--that superhuman voice audible to\nhimself alone. Everything depended upon him. What he had done simply\nin his capacity of military judge, he could undo as civil delegate. He\nalone could pardon; there were no limits to his authority; it needed\nbut a sign from him to set Gauvain at liberty; life and death were in\nhis hands; the guillotine was at his command. In this tragic moment he\nheld supreme authority.\n\nThere was no resource but to wait.\n\nThe night came.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nTHE DUNGEON.\n\n\nOnce more the hall of justice was changed into a guard-room; and as on\nthe previous evening, the sentinels were doubled, two of whom guarded\nthe door of the closed dungeon.\n\nToward midnight, a man, bearing a lantern in his hand, crossed the\nguard-room, where he made himself known, and ordered the dungeon to\nbe opened. It was Cimourdain. He entered, leaving the door half open\nbehind him. The dungeon was dark and silent. Taking one step forward\nin the gloom, he placed the lantern on the ground and stood still. The\neven breathing of a sleeping man could be heard through the darkness.\nCimourdain stood dreamily listening to this peaceful sound.\n\nOn the truss of straw at the farther end of the dungeon lay Gauvain\nsound asleep. It was his breathing that he heard.\n\nCimourdain moved as noiselessly as possible, and when he had drawn\nnear, he fixed his eyes upon Gauvain; no mother gazing upon her\nsleeping infant could have worn a look more unutterably tender. The\nexpression was probably beyond his control; he pressed his clenched\nhands against his eyes as children sometimes do, and for a moment stood\nperfectly still. Then he knelt, gently lifted Gauvain's hand, and\ncarried it to his lips.\n\nGauvain stirred. He opened his eyes, with the vague surprise of sudden\nwaking. The feeble glimmer of a lantern dimly lighted the dungeon. He\nrecognized Cimourdain.\n\n\"Ah, is that you, master?\" he said.\n\nThen he added,--\n\n\"I dreamed that Death was kissing my hand.\"\n\nA sudden influx of thoughts will now and then startle a man, and so it\nwas with Cimourdain; at times this wave rolls in so tumultuously that\nit threatens to submerge the soul. But Cimourdain's deep soul gave\nforth no sign; he could but utter the word \"Gauvain!\"\n\nAnd the two men stood gazing at each other--Cimourdain's eyes alight\nwith flames that scorched his tears, Gauvain with his sweetest smile.\n\nGauvain raised himself on one elbow, and said:--\n\n\"That scar I see on your face is the sabre-cut you received in my\nstead. It was but yesterday you stood beside me in the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e, and all\nfor my sake. If Providence had not placed you by my cradle, where\nshould I be to-day? In ignorance. If I have any sense of duty, it is\nto you that I owe it. I was born in fetters,--I mean the bonds of\nprejudice,--which you have loosened; you promoted my free development,\nand from the mummy you have created a child. You have implanted a\nconscience in a being who bade fair to prove an abortion. Without you\nmy growth would have been cramped; it is through your influence that\nI live. I was but a lord, you have made of me a citizen; I was only\na citizen, you have made of me a mind; you have fitted me to lead\nthe life of a man upon the earth, and have shown my soul the way to\nheaven. It is you who placed in my hands the key of truth that unlocks\nthe domain wherein we find the realities of human life, and the key\nof light to the realms above. I thank you, my master! To you I owe my\nlife.\"\n\nCimourdain, seating himself on the straw beside Gauvain, said,--\n\n\"I have come to sup with you.\"\n\nGauvain broke the black bread and offered it to him. After Cimourdain\nhad taken a piece, Gauvain handed him the jug of water.\n\n\"Drink first yourself,\" said Cimourdain.\n\nGauvain drank, and then passed the jug to Cimourdain, who drank after\nhim.\n\nGauvain had taken but a swallow.\n\nCimourdain took deep draughts.\n\nDuring this supper Gauvain ate, and Cimourdain drank,--a proof of the\ncalmness of the one, and of the burning fever of the other.\n\nA certain awful tranquillity pervaded this dungeon. The two men\nconversed.\n\n\"Gauvain was saying,--\n\n\"Grand events are taking form. No one can comprehend the mysterious\nworkings of revolution at the present time. Behind the visible\nachievement rests the invisible, the one concealing the other. The\nvisible work seems cruel; the invisible is sublime. At this moment\nI can see it all very clearly. It is strange and beautiful. We have\nbeen forced to use the materials of the Past. Hence this wonderful\n'93. Beneath a scaffolding of barbarism we are building the temple of\ncivilization.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Cimourdain, \"these temporary expedients pave the way\nfor the final adjustment, wherein justice and duty stand side by side,\nwhere taxation will be proportionate and progressive, and military\nservice compulsory; where there is to be absolute equality in rank; and\nwhere, above all things else, the straight line of the Law is to be\nmaintained,--the republic of the absolute.\"\n\n\"I prefer the republic of the ideal,\" said Gauvain.\n\nHe broke off, then continued:--\n\n\"But, oh, my master, where in the picture you have just drawn in words\ndo you place devotion, sacrifice, abnegation, the sweet intermingling\nof kindliness and love? An accurate adjustment of proportions is a\ngood thing, but harmony is still better. The lyre stands higher than\nthe scales. Your republic deals with the material interest of man;\nmine transports him to the skies: it is like the difference between a\ntheorem and an eagle.\"\n\n\"You are lost in the clouds.\"\n\n\"And you in your calculations.\"\n\n\"There is an element of dreaminess in harmony.\"\n\n\"So there is in algebra.\"\n\n\"I would have man fashioned according to Euclid.\"\n\n\"And I like him better as described by Homer.\"\n\nThe stern smile of Cimourdain rested on Gauvain as though to stay the\nflight of his soul.\n\n[Illustration 135]\n\n\"Poetry. Beware of poets!\"\n\n\"Yes; that is a familiar warning: beware zephyrs, beware of sunbeams,\nbeware of perfumes, beware of flowers, beware of the stars.\"\n\n\"That sort of thing can never supply us with food.\"\n\n\"How can you tell? There is mental nourishment: a man finds food in\nthought.\"\n\n\"Let us indulge in no abstractions! The republic is like two and two in\nmathematics: two and two make four. When I have given to each man his\ndue--\"\n\n\"Then your duty is to give him what does not revert to him as a right.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean those mutual concessions which each man owes his neighbor, and\nwhich go to make up the sum of social life.\"\n\n\"There is nothing beyond the just limits of the law.\"\n\n\"Ah, but there is--everything!\"\n\n\"I see nothing but justice.\"\n\n\"I look higher.\"\n\n\"What stands higher than justice?\"\n\n\"Equity.\"\n\nNow and then both paused, as though a sudden light had flashed across\ntheir minds.\n\nCimourdain continued,--\n\n\"Explain your assertion. I challenge you to do it.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. You demand compulsory military service. Against whom?\nAgainst mankind. I object to military service; I would have peace.\nYou desire to help the wretched; what I wish is the abolition of\ntheir misery. You demand proportionate taxation; I would have no taxes\nwhatsoever. I would have the public expenses reduced to the lowest\nlevel, and paid for by the social surplus.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"This: In the first place, it is for you to suppress sycophancy,--that\nof the priest, the soldier, and the judge. Then, use your wealth to\nthe best advantage; distribute over your furrows all that fertilizing\nmatter which is now thrown into your sewers. Three quarters of the\nsoil lies fallow; plough it up; redeem the waste pastures; divide\nthe communal lands; let each man have a farm, and each farm a man.\nYou will increase a hundredfold the social product. At the present\ntime, France affords her peasants meat but four times a year; well\ncultivated, she could feed three millions of men, all Europe. Utilize\nnature, that gigantic auxiliary; enlist every breeze, every waterfall,\nevery magnetic current, in your service. This globe has a subterranean\nnetwork of veins, through which flows a marvellous circulation of\nwater, oil, and fire; pierce this vein of the globe, and let the water\nfeed your fountains, the oil your lamps, and the fire your hearths.\nConsider the action of the waves,--the ebb and flow of the tides. What\nis the ocean? A prodigious force wasted. How stupid is the earth, to\nmake no use of the ocean!\"\n\n\"There you go, in full career with your dreams!\"\n\n\"You mean with my realities.\"\n\nGauvain continued,--\n\n\"And woman,--how do you dispose of her?\"\n\nCimourdain replied,--\n\n\"Leave her as she is,--the servant of man.\"\n\n\"Yes, under one condition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That man shall be the servant of woman.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" exclaimed Cimourdain. \"Man a servant?\nNever! Man is the master. I admit but one kingdom,--that of the\nfire-side. Man is king in his own home.\"\n\n\"Yes, on one condition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That woman shall be its queen.\"\n\n\"You mean that you demand for both man and woman--\"\n\n\"Equality.\"\n\n\"'Equality'! Can you dream of such a thing? The two beings are so\nentirely unlike!\"\n\n\"I said equality, not identity.\"\n\nThere was another pause, a sort of truce as it were, between these two\nminds exchanging their lightning flashes. Cimourdain broke it.\n\n\"And the child? To whose care would you intrust that?\"\n\n\"First to the father who begets, then to the mother who gives him\nbirth, later to the master who educates, and to the city that makes a\nman of him, then to the country which is his supreme mother, and lastly\nto humanity which is his great ancestress.\"\n\n\"You have not mentioned God.\"\n\n\"Each step--father, mother, master, city, country, humanity--is but a\nrung in the ladder that leads to God.\"\n\nCimourdain was silent, while Gauvain continued:\n\n\"When one climbs to the top of the ladder one has reached God. God is\nrevealed, and one has but to enter into heaven.\"\n\nCimourdain made the gesture of one who calls another back: \"Gauvain,\nreturn to earth. We want to realize the possible.\"\n\n\"Do not begin then by making it impossible.\"\n\n\"The possible may always be realized.\"\n\n\"Not always. Rough usage destroys Utopia. Nothing is more defenceless\nthan the egg.\"\n\n\"Still, Utopia must be seized and forced to wear the yoke of reality;\nshe must be circumscribed by a system of actual facts. The abstract\nmust be resolved into the concrete: what it loses in beauty it gains\nin usefulness; although contracted, it is improved. Justice must enter\ninto law; and when justice has become law, it is absolute. That is what\nI call the possible.\"\n\n\"The possible includes more than that.\"\n\n\"Ah, there you go again, soaring away into the land of dreams!\"\n\n\"The possible is a mysterious bird, always hovering above the head of\nman.\"\n\n\"We must catch it.\"\n\n\"And take it alive too.\"\n\nGauvain continued:--\n\n\"My idea is this: Ever onward. If God had intended that man should\ngo backwards He would have given him an eye in the back of his head.\nLet us look always towards the dawn, the blossom-time, the hour of\nbirth. Those things which are falling to decay encourage the new\nspringing life. In the splitting of the old tree may be heard a\nsummons to the new one. Each century will do its work,--civic, to-day;\nhumane, to-morrow: to-day, the question of justice; to-morrow, that of\ncompensation. Wages and Justice are in point of fact synonymous terms.\nMan's life is not to be spent without a suitable compensation. When He\nbestows life, God contracts thereby a debt: justice is the inherent\ncompensation; remuneration is the acquirement thereof.\"\n\nGauvain spoke with the calm serenity of a prophet; Cimourdain listened.\nThe parts were changed, and now it seemed as if it were the pupil who\nhad become the master.\n\nCimourdain murmured,--\n\n\"You go at a rapid rate.\"\n\n\"Perhaps because I have no time to lose,\" replied Gauvain with a smile.\n\nHe continued:--\n\n\"Ah, master, here is the difference between our two utopias. You would\nhave military service obligatory; I demand the same for education.\nYou dream of man the soldier; I, of man the citizen. You wish him to\nstrike terror; I would have him thoughtful. You establish a republic of\nswords, while I desire to found--\"\n\nHe broke off.\n\n\"I should like to establish a republic of minds.\"\n\nCimourdain looked down on the flag-stones of the dungeon.\n\n\"And in the mean time what would you have?\" he asked.\n\n\"The existing condition of things.\"\n\n\"Then you absolve the present moment.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it is a tempest. A tempest always knows what it is about. For\nevery oak that is struck by lightning, how many forests are purified!\nCivilization has a plague; a strong wind is sent to expel it from the\nland. It may not choose its methods wisely, perhaps, but can it do\notherwise? Its task is no light one. Viewing the horror of the miasma,\nI can understand the fury of the wind.\"\n\nGauvain went on:--\n\n\"But what matters the storm to me, if I have a compass; and what power\ncan events gain over me, if I have my conscience?\"\n\nAnd he added in that undertone which produces so solemn an effect:--\n\n\"There is One to whose will we must always yield.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" asked Cimourdain.\n\nGauvain pointed upwards. Cimourdain looked in the direction of the\nuplifted finger, and it seemed to him that he could see the starry sky\nthrough the dungeon vault.\n\nOnce more they relapsed into silence.\n\nCimourdain continued:--\n\n\"A supernatural state of society; I tell you it is no longer\npossible,--it is a mere dream.\"\n\n\"It is a goal; otherwise, of what use is society? Better remain in a\nstate of nature; be like the savages. Otaheite is a paradise, only\nin that paradise no one thinks. Better an intelligent hell than a\nstupid heaven. But, no,--we will have no hell whatever. Let us be a\nhuman society. Super-natural? Yes. But if you are to add nothing to\nNature, why leave her? In that case you may as well content yourself\nwith work like the ant, and with honey like the bee. Rest content\namong the laboring classes, instead of rising to the ranks of superior\nintelligence. If you add anything to Nature, you must of necessity rise\nabove her: to add is to augment; to augment is to increase. Society is\nthe exaltation of Nature. I would have what bee-hives and ant-hills\nlack,--monuments, arts, poetry, heroes, men of genius. To bear eternal\nburdens is no fit law for man. No, no, no! let us have no more pariahs,\nno more slaves, no more convicts, no more lost souls! I would have\nevery attribute of man a symbol of civilization and an example of\nprogress; I would present liberty to the intellect, equality to the\nheart, fraternity to the soul. Away with the yoke! Man is not made\nfor dragging chains, but that he may spread his wings. Let us have no\nmore of the reptile. Let the larva turn into a butterfly; let the grub\nchange into a living flower and fly away. I wish--\"\n\nHe broke off. His eyes shone, his lips moved, he said no more.\n\nThe door had remained open. Sounds from without penetrated into the\ndungeon. The distant echo of a trumpet reached their ears,--probably\nthe r\u00c3\u00a9veille; then, when the guard was relieved, they heard the\nbutt-ends of the sentinels' muskets striking the ground; again,\napparently quite near the tower, so far as the darkness allowed one\nto judge, a noise like the moving of planks and beams, accompanied\nby muffled and intermittent sounds resembling the blows of a hammer.\nCimourdain turned pale as he listened. Gauvain heard nothing. Deeper\nand deeper grew his reverie. Hardly did he seem to breathe, so absorbed\nwas he in the visions of his brain. Now and then he moved, like one\nslightly startled. A gathering brightness shone in his eyes, like the\nlight of dawn.\n\nSome time passed thus.\n\n\"Of what are you thinking?\" asked Cimourdain.\n\n\"Of the future,\" replied Gauvain.\n\nAnd he fell back again into his meditation. Unobserved by the latter,\nCimourdain rose from the bed of straw whereon they had both been\nsitting. His eyes rested yearningly upon the young dreamer, while he\nslowly moved backward towards the door. He went out. The dungeon was\nagain closed.\n\n\n[Illustration 136]\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nSTILL THE SUN RISES\n\n\nIt was not long before day began to dawn on the horizon; and together\nwith the day there sprang to light upon the plateau of the Tourgue,\nabove the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, a strange, stationary, and wonderful\nobject, unfamiliar to the birds of heaven.\n\nIt had been placed there during the night,--set up rather than built.\nFrom a distance, against the horizon, it presented a profile composed\nof straight and rigid lines, resembling a Hebrew letter, or one of\nthose Egyptian hieroglyphics which formed part of the alphabet of the\nancient enigma.\n\nThe first thought that entered the mind at the sight of this object was\nits uselessness. There it stood, among the blossoming heather. Then\ncame the question, could it be used; and for what purpose? Then came\na shudder. It was a sort of trestle-work, supported by four posts. At\none end were two long upright beams, united at the top by a cross-beam,\nfrom which hung a triangle that looked black against the pale blue\nof the morning sky. At the other end of this trestle stood a ladder.\nBetween these two beams, beneath the triangle, could be distinguished\na sort of panel composed of two movable sections, which, fitting into\none another, offered to the eye a round hole about the size of a man's\nneck. The upper section of the panel ran in a groove, by means of which\nit could be raised or lowered. For the moment the two semicircles that\nformed the collar were drawn apart. At the foot of the two pillars\nsupporting the triangle was seen a plank that moved on hinges like a\nsee-saw. Beside the plank stood a long basket, and in front, between\nthe two posts at the end of the staging, a square one. This object was\npainted red, and made entirely of wood, except the triangle, which was\nof iron. One might know that it was built by men, so ugly, sordid, and\ncontemptible did it look; and yet so formidable was it that it might\nwell have been transported hither by genii.\n\nThis shapeless structure was the guillotine.\n\nIn front of it, a few paces off, in the ravine, was another monster,\nLa Tourgue,--a stone monster, companion-piece to the monster of wood.\nAnd let us add, that after wood and stone have been manipulated by man\nthey lose something of their original substance, taking on a certain\nsimilitude to man himself. A building is a dogma; a machine is an idea.\n\nThe Tourgue was that fatal product of the past called in Paris the\nBastille, in England the Tower of London, in Germany the Fortress of\nSpielberg, in Spain the Escurial, in Moscow the Kremlin, and in Rome\nthe Castle of Saint-Angelo.\n\nThe Tourgue was the condensation of fifteen hundred years,--the\nperiod of the Middle Ages, with its vassalage, its servitude, and its\nfeudality. The guillotine showed forth but one year,--'93; but these\ntwelve months were a fitting counterpoise for those fifteen centuries.\n\nThe Tourgue was the personification of monarchy; the guillotine, of\nrevolution.\n\nA tragic encounter.\n\nOn the one hand, the debt; on the other, the requirement thereof. All\nthe hopeless entanglement of the Gothic period--the serf, the lord,\nthe slave, the master, the plebeian, the nobility, a complex code\nwith all the ramifications of practice, the coalition of judge and\npriest, the infinite variety of shackles, fiscal duties, the salt-tax,\nthe mortmain, the poll-tax, the exception, the prerogatives, the\nprejudices, the fanaticisms, the royal privilege of bankruptcy, the\nsceptre, the throne, the arbitrary will, the divine right--opposed to\nthat simple thing, a knife.\n\nOn one side, a knot; on the other, the axe.\n\nFor many a year the Tourgue had stood alone in this desert, and from\nits battlements had rained the boiling oil, the burning pitch, and the\nmelted lead; there it stood, with its dungeons paved with human bones,\nits torture-chamber alive with memories of its tragic past. For fifteen\ncenturies of savage tranquillity its gloomy front had towered above the\nshades of the forest; it had been the only power in the land,--the one\nthing respected and feared; its reign had been supreme, without a rival\nin its wild barbarity, when it suddenly saw rising before it, with an\naspect of hostility, a thing,--nay, more than a thing; a creature as\nhideous as itself,--the guillotine.\n\nStone seems at times endowed with the sense of sight. A statue\nobserves, a tower watches, the front of a building contemplates. The\nTourgue seemed to be examining the guillotine.\n\nIt was as if questioning itself,--\n\n\"What can this object be?\"\n\nOne might fancy it to have sprung from the soil.\n\nAnd so, indeed, it had.\n\nLike a poisonous tree it had sprouted from a fatal soil. From that soil\nso plentifully watered by human sweat, by tears, and by blood, from the\nsoil wherein men had dug countless graves, tombs, caves, and ambushes,\nfrom the same soil wherein had rotted the innumerable victims of\nevery kind of tyranny, from that soil covering so great a multitude of\ncrimes, buried like frightful germs in the depths below, had sprung\nforth, on the appointed day, this stranger, this avenging goddess, this\nfierce sword-bearing instrument; and '93 cried out to the Old World,--\n\n\"Behold me!\"\n\nThe guillotine had a right to say to the dungeon: \"I am thy daughter.\"\n\nAnd yet at the same time the keep--for these fatal objects live a\ncertain obscure life--recognized its own death-warrant.\n\nAt the sight of this formidable apparition the Tourgue seemed\nbewildered. One might have called it terror. The immense mass of\ngranite was both majestic and infamous; that plank with its triangle\nwas still more dreadful. Deposed omnipotence felt a horror of the\nrising power. It was criminal history studying judicial history. The\nviolence of former days was comparing itself with the violence of the\npresent time; the ancient fortress, both the prison and the dwelling\nof the lords, where the tortured victims had shrieked aloud, this\nstructure devoted to war and murder, now useless and defenceless,\nviolated, dismantled, discrowned, a pile of stones no better than a\nheap of cinders, hideous to look upon, magnificent in death, dizzy with\nthe vertigo of those terrible centuries, stood watching the passage of\nthe awful living hour. Yesterday shuddered in the presence of To-day.\nThe old ferocity beheld and did homage to the new terror, and that\nwhich was mere Nothingness unclosed its spectral eyes before the\nTerror, and the phantom gazed upon the ghost. Nature is pitiless; she\nnever withholds her flowers, her melodies, her perfumes, her sunbeams,\nfrom human abominations. She overwhelms man by the contrast between\ndivine beauty and social ugliness; she spares him nothing, neither the\nwing of butterfly, nor song of bird; on the verge of murder, in the\nact of vengeance or barbarity, she brings him face to face with those\nholy things; nowhere can he escape the eternal reproach of universal\nbenevolence and the implacable serenity of the sky. Human law in all\nits hideous deformity must stand forth naked in the presence of the\neternal radiance. Man breaks and crushes, lays waste, destroys; but the\nsummer, the lily, and the star remain ever the same.\n\nNever had the fair sky of early dawn seemed lovelier than on that\nmorning. A soft breeze stirred the heather, the mist floated lightly\namong the branches, the forest of Foug\u00c3\u00a8res, suffused with the breath\nof running brooks, smoked in the dawn like a gigantic censer filled\nwith incense; the blue sky, the snowy clouds, the clear transparency\nof the streams, the verdure, with its harmonious scale of color, from\nthe aqua-marine to the emerald, the social groups of trees, the grassy\nglades, the far-reaching plains,--all revealed that purity which is\nNature's eternal precept unto man. In the midst of all this appeared\nthe awful depravity of man; there stood the fortress and the scaffold,\nwar and punishment, the two representatives of this sanguinary epoch\nand moment, the screech-owl of the gloomy night of the Past and the bat\nof the twilight of the Future. In the presence of a world all flowery\nand fragrant, tender and charming, the glorious sky bathed both the\nTourgue and the guillotine with the light of dawn, as though it said to\nman: \"Behold my work, and yours.\"\n\nThe sun wields a formidable weapon in its light.\n\nThis spectacle had its spectators.\n\nThe four thousand men of the expeditionary army were drawn up on the\nplateau in battle array. They surrounded the guillotine on three sides,\nforming themselves around it after a geometrical fashion in the shape\nof the letter E; the battery placed against the centre of the longest\nline made the notch of the E. The red machine was, if we may so express\nit, shut in by these three battle fronts, a wall of soldiers, extending\nin a sort of coil and spreading as far as the edge of the escarpment of\nthe plateau; the fourth side, left open, was the ravine itself, which\nlooked upon the Tourgue.\n\nThis formed an oblong square, in the centre of which stood the\nscaffold. The shadow cast upon the grass by the guillotine lessened as\nthe sun rose. The gunners with lighted matches stood by their pieces. A\nfaint blue smoke curled upward from the ravine,--the last breath of the\ndying fire on the bridge.\n\nThis smoke obscured without veiling the Tourgue, whose lofty platform\noverlooked the entire horizon. Only the width of the ravine separated\nthe platform from the guillotine, and voices could easily have been\nheard between them.\n\nThe table of the tribunal and the chair shaded by the tricolored\nflags had been conveyed to this platform. The sun rising behind the\nTourgue brought into relief the black mass of the fortress, and upon\nits summit, seated on the chair of the tribunal, beneath the group\nof flags, the figure of a man, motionless, his arms crossed upon his\nbreast.\n\nThis man was Cimourdain. He wore, as on the previous evening, his civil\ndelegate's uniform, a hat with the tricolored cockade upon his head, a\nsabre by his side, and pistols in his belt.\n\nHe was silent. The entire assembly was silent likewise. The soldiers,\ntheir eyes downcast, stood at order-arms. They touched elbows, but no\none spoke. They were thinking vaguely about this war,--the numerous\nbattles, the hedge fusillades so valiantly faced, of the hosts of\nfurious peasants scattered by their prowess, the citadels conquered,\nthe engagements won, the victories; and now it seemed as though all\nthis glory were turned to their shame. A gloomy expectation oppressed\nevery breast. They could see the executioner walking up and down the\nplatform of the guillotine. The growing light of day deepened until it\nfilled the sky with its majestic presence.\n\nSuddenly was heard that muffled sound peculiar to crape-covered drums;\nnearer and nearer came their funereal roll; the ranks opened, and the\nprocession, entering the square, moved towards the scaffold.\n\nFirst came the black' drums, then a company of grenadiers with lowered\nmuskets, then a platoon of gendarmes with drawn sabres, then the\nprisoner, Gauvain.\n\nGauvain walked without constraint. Neither hands nor feet were bound.\nHe was in undress uniform, and wore his sword.\n\nBehind him marched another platoon of gendarmes.\n\nThe same pensive joy that had lighted his face when he said to\nCimourdain, \"I am thinking of the future,\" still rested upon it.\nNothing could be more sublime and touching than this continued smile.\n\nWhen he reached the fatal spot, his first glance was turned to the\nsummit of the tower. He disdained the guillotine. He knew that\nCimourdain would feel it his duty to be present at the execution; his\neyes sought him on the platform and found him there.\n\nCimourdain was ghastly pale and cold. Even those who stood nearest\nheard no sound of his breathing.\n\nWhen he caught sight of Gauvain not a quiver passed over his face; and\nyet he knew that every step brought him nearer to the scaffold.\n\nAs he advanced, Gauvain looked at Cimourdain, and Cimourdain looked at\nhim. It seemed as though Cimourdain found support in that glance.\n\nGauvain reached the foot of the scaffold. He ascended it, followed by%\nthe officer in command of the grenadiers. He unbelted his sword and\nhanded it to this officer; then he loosened his cravat and gave it to\nthe headsman. He was like a vision. Never had he looked more beautiful:\nhis brown locks floated in the wind (at that time they did not cut the\nhair of those about to be executed); his fair throat reminded one of\na woman's; his heroic and commanding expression gave the idea of an\narch-angel. He stood upon the scaffold, lost in reverie. There, too,\nwas a height. Gauvain stood upon it stately and calm. The sun streamed\nabout him, crowning him, as it were, with a halo. Still, the prisoner\nmust be bound. Rope in hand, the executioner advanced.\n\nAt that moment, when the soldiers saw their young leader so near the\nknife, they could no longer restrain themselves; the hearts of those\nwarriors burst forth. Then was heard a startling sound,--the sobs of\nan entire army. A clamor arose: \"Mercy! mercy!\" Some fell on their\nknees, others threw down their muskets, stretching their arms towards\nthe platform where Cimourdain stood. One grenadier, pointing to the\nguillotine, cried, \"Here I am; will you not take me as a substitute?\"\nAll repeated frantically, \"Mercy! mercy!\" The very lions would have\nbeen moved or terrified; for the tears of soldiers are terrible.\n\nThe headsman paused, uncertain what to do.\n\nThen a voice, quick and low, and yet in its ominous severity distinctly\nheard by all, cried from the top of the tower,--\n\n\"Execute the law!\"\n\nThey recognized the inexorable tone. Cimourdain had spoken. The army\nshuddered.\n\nThe executioner hesitated no longer. He moved forward, holding out the\ncord.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Gauvain.\n\nAnd turning towards Cimourdain, he waved his free right hand in token\nof farewell; then he allowed himself to be bound.\n\nWhen he was tied he said to the executioner,--\n\n\"Pardon,--one moment more. Long live the Republic!\" he cried.\n\nHe was laid upon the plank. The infamous collar clasped that charming\nand noble head. The executioner gently lifted his hair, then pressed\nthe spring; the triangle detached itself, gliding first slowly, then\nrapidly: a frightful blow was heard.\n\nAt the same instant another report sounded; the stroke of the axe\nwas answered by a pistol-shot. Cimourdain had just seized one of the\npistols that he wore in his belt; and as Gauvain's head rolled into the\nbasket, Cimourdain sent a bullet through his own heart. A stream of\nblood gushed from his mouth, and he fell dead.\n\nThus these twin souls, united in the tragic death, rose together,--the\nshadow of the one blending with the radiance of the other.\n\n\n[Illustration 137]\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ninety-Three, by Victor Hugo\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NINETY-THREE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 49372-8.txt or 49372-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/9\/3\/7\/49372\/\n\nProduced by Laura Natal Rodrigues and Marc D'Hooghe at\nhttp:\/\/www.freeliterature.org (Images generously made\navailable by the Hathi Trust - and by Gallica (Biblioth\u00c3\u00a8que\nnationale de France) for the illustrations.)\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":520,"split":"train"}
