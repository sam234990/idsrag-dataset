As painters and their models sing about the troubles of being a poor artist, the models try to convince the painters to quit their work and have some fun (\"By the Side of the Mill\"). Overhearing the models complaining, Tina points out that at least the girls have boyfriends. Prompted by this statement Flora discloses that she longs for her painter to say that he loves her, and will one day, marry her (\"Loved But Me\"). Con and Kid try to sneak out of the inn without paying their bill, but they are discovered and sent to jail. The Innkeeper takes pity on them, however, and arranges for them to work at the inn to pay off their debt.\nThe Burgomaster's daughter, Gretchen, loves Captain Doris van Damm. Her father, however, wishes her to marry the Governor of Zeeland. Con and Kid agree to help Gretchen and the Captain to elope. Willem tells the Burgomaster about this plot, and he locks Gretchen in the windmill. The Americans try to rescue her, but the Burgomaster has made all arrangements for the marriage between his daughter to the governor. Plotting with Tina, the two Americans finally help Gretchen to escape and then they appear at the wedding festivities (which are missing the bride) disguised as Sherlock Holmes and Watson to \"help\" Burgomaster find his daughter. Bertha replaces Gretchen as the bride, marries the Governor (her childhood sweetheart), and her identity is then revealed. It turns out, luckily, that Captain Van Damm is heir to a large fortune. The fathers' resistance falls away, and the lovers are united. The Americans return home to New York (\"New York\").\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Silent Mill, by Hermann Sudermann\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

As long as I can remember it has been an old,\ntumble-down structure, an ancient relic of long-forgotten times.\n\nOld, and weather-beaten, and roofless, its crumbling walls stretch\nupwards toward the sky, giving free access to every gust of wind. Two\nlarge, round stones that once, maybe, bravely fulfilled their task,\nhave broken through the rotten wood-work and, obeying the natural law\nof gravitation, have wedged themselves deep into the ground.\n\nThe large mill-wheel hangs awry between its moulding supports. The\npaddles are broken off, and only the spokes stick up into the air, like\narms stretched forth to implore the \"coup de gr\u00c3\u00a2ce.\"\n\nMoss and lichen have clothed all in green, and here and there some\nwater-cress puts forth its sickly green, sodden growth. From a\nhalf-broken pipe the water runs slowly down, trickles in sleepy\nmonotony onto the spokes and breaks there, filling the surrounding air\nwith fine, drizzling spray. Under a gray thicket of alders the\nlittle rivulet lies hidden in malodorous slothfulness, washed full of\nwater-weeds and frog-spawn, choked up with mare's tail and flowering\nrushes. Only in the middle there trickles still a tiny stream of thick,\nblack water, in which the little palegreen leaves of the duck-weed\nlazily drift along.\n\nBut those long years ago the mill-stream flowed right gayly and\njauntily; snow-white foam gleamed at the weir; the merry chatter of the\nwheels resounded as far as the village; in long rows the carts drove in\nand out of the mill-yard; and far into the distance there echoed the\nmighty voice of the old miller.\n\nRockhammer was his name, and all who saw him felt that he did honor to\nit, too. What a man he was! He had it in him to blast rocks. Of course\nthere was no such thing as trying to bully or contradict him, for it\nonly served to make him perfectly wild with rage: he would clench his\nfists; the veins on his temples would swell up like thick thongs; and\nwhen he started swearing into the bargain, every being trembled before\nhim, and the very dogs fled in terror to their kennels. His wife was a\nmeek, gentle, yielding creature. How could it be otherwise? Not\nfor twenty-four hours would he have endured at his side a more\nsturdy-natured being, who might have attempted to preserve even the\nshadow of an independent will. As it was, the two lived together fairly\nwell, happily one might almost have said, had it not been for his fatal\ntemper, which broke forth wildly at the slightest provocation and\ncaused the quiet woman many a tearful hour.\n\nBut she shed most tears when misfortune's hand fell heavily upon her\nchildren. Three had been born to them--bonny, healthy, sturdy boys.\nThey had clear, blue eyes, flaxen hair and, above all, \"a pair of\npromising fists,\" as their father was wont to declare with pride,\nthough the youngest, who was still in his cradle, could as yet only\nmake use of his to suck at them. The two elder boys, however, were\nalready splendid fellows. How defiantly they looked about them, how\nhaughtily they took up their stand! With their heads thrown back and\ntheir hands in their trousers pockets, each seemed to assert: \"I am my\nfather's son. Who'll dare me?\"\n\nThey fought each other all day long and it was their father himself who\nalways goaded them on. And if their mother in her terror intervened and\nbegged them to be at peace with one another, she got laughed at into\nthe bargain for her fears. The poor woman lived in constant anxiety\nabout her wild boys, for she saw to her terror that both had inherited\ntheir father's violent temper. Once already she had only just arrived\nin the nick of time, when Fritz, then eight years old, was about to\nattack his brother, two years older than himself, with a large kitchen\nknife; and a half a year later the day really dawned on which her dark\npresentiments were realized.\n\nThe two boys had been fighting in the yard, and Martin, the elder one,\nwild with rage because Fritz had beaten him, had hurled a stone at him\nand hit him so unfortunately at the back of his head that he fell down\nbleeding and immediately lost the power of speech. They could stanch\nthe blood, and the wound healed up, but his speech did not return.\nIndifferent to all around, the boy sat there and let them feed him: he\nhad become an idiot.\n\nIt was a hard blow for the miller's family. The mother wept whole\nnights through, and even he, the energetic hard-working man, went about\nfor a long time as if in a dream.\n\nBut the perpetrator of the disastrous deed was the one most impressed\nby it. The defiant, boisterously happy boy was hardly recognizable. His\nexuberance of spirits had disappeared; he spent his days in silent\nbrooding, obeyed his mother to the letter and, whenever possible,\navoided joining in the games of his school-fellows.\n\nHis love for his unfortunate brother was touching. When he was at home,\nhe never stirred from his side. With superhuman patience he accustomed\nhimself to the brutalized habits of the idiot, learned to understand\nhis inarticulate sounds, fulfilled his every wish, and looked on\nsmilingly when he destroyed his dearest toy.\n\nThe invalid boy got so used to his companionship that he would not be\nwithout him. When Martin was at school, he cried incessantly and\npreferred to go hungry rather than take food and drink from anyone\nelse.\n\nFor three years he dragged on this miserable existence; then he began\nto ail and died.\n\nThough his death certainly came as a relief to the whole household, all\nmourned his loss sincerely, and Martin especially was inconsolable.\nDuring the first months he wandered out daily to the cemetery and often\nhad to be torn by force away from the grave. Only very gradually he\ngrew calmer, chiefly through intercourse with the youngest boy,\nJohannes, to whom he now appeared to transfer the intense love which he\nhad lavished upon his dead brother.\n\nAs long as the invalid lived, he had taken little notice of Johannes,\nfor he seemed to think it almost sinful to give even the merest\nfraction of his affection to any one else. Now that death had robbed\nhim of the poor unfortunate, an invincible longing drew him towards his\nyounger brother--as if by his love for him he might fill the agonizing\nvoid which the loss of his victim had left in him as if he might atone\ntoward the living for what he had inflicted on the dead.\n\nJohannes was at that time a fine lad of five, already quite a little\nman, who was to have his first pair of stout boots at next fair-time.\nHe seemed to have inherited nothing of his father's harsh, defiant\nnature; he took much more after his gentle, quiet mother, to whom he\nclung specially as her pet, and whose very idol he was. Not hers alone,\nthough, for all in the house spoiled and petted him, their sunbeam,\ntheir source of joy.\n\nIndeed, none who saw him could help loving him! His long, fair hair\ngleamed like so many sunbeams, and in his eyes, which could twinkle so\nmerrily and at other times gaze so dreamily, there lay depths of\ngoodness and love. He attached himself fervently to his elder brother,\nwho had so long neglected him; but the disparity in their ages--they\nwere nearly nine years apart--did not allow of purely brotherly\nrelations between them.\n\nMartin was already at the close of his boyhood; his serious, thoughtful\nmien and measured, old-fashioned speech made him appear older than he\nwas. Besides, he was already destined to commence work in the following\nyear. Under these circumstances it was only natural that he should\nassume a somewhat fatherly tone towards his younger brother, and though\nhe was not ashamed to join in his childish games and to be driven as\nhis patient horse with a \"gee-up\" and a \"whoa,\" through the mill-yard\nand across the fields, there was even in this more of the smiling\nindulgence of a kindly tutor than of the spontaneous pleasure of an\nolder playmate.\n\nThe affectionate-natured boy, craving for love and sympathy, gave\nhimself up heart and soul to his big brother. He recognized his\nboundless authority more even than that of his father and mother, who\nwere further removed from his childish sphere--and when school-days\ncommenced and Martin proved such a patient helper in word and deed\nwhenever lessons were hard, then the younger boy's veneration for his\nelder brother knew no bounds. Old Rockhammer was the only one who was\nnot pleased with the closeness of their friendship. They were too\nsweet; they \"slobbered\" each other too much, they had much better \"live\nlike cats and dogs together\" as a proof that they were really \"one's\nown flesh and blood.\" But their gentle mother was all the happier. Her\nprayer to the Almighty by day and night was to protect her children and\nnevermore to allow the flame of wrath to burst forth in Martin. And her\nsupplication seemed to have been heard. Only once more was her soul\nfilled with horror through an outburst of rage in her son.\n\nJohannes--then nine years old--had been playing with a whip near some\ncarts standing in the yard ready to take away flour. Suddenly one of\nthe horses took fright; and the driver, a coarse, drunken fellow, tore\nthe whip out of the boy's hand, and gave him a cut with it across his\nface and neck.\n\nAt the same instant Martin, lithe as a tiger, rushed out of the mill;\nthe veins on his temples swollen, his fists clenched, got hold of the\nman and began to throttle him so that he was already black in the face.\nThen his mother threw herself with a loud scream of terror between the\ntwo. \"Think of Fritz!\" she cried, throwing up her arms in an agony of\nhorror; and the infuriated boy let his hands drop as if paralyzed,\ntottered back and fell down sobbing on the threshold of the mill.\n\nSince then his temper seemed to have died out entirely, and even when\nhe was once insulted and attacked on the highroad, he kept his knife,\nwhich the people of those parts are quick to use, quietly in his\npocket.\n\n\nThe years sped on. Shortly after Martin came of age, the old miller\nclosed his eyes. His wife soon followed him. She did not recover after\nhis death, and quietly and without complaining, she withered away. It\nwas as if she could not exist without the scoldings which she had had\nto take daily from her husband for twenty-three years.\n\nThe two brothers now dwelt alone in the orphaned mill. So it was no\nwonder that they clung to each other even more closely, and that each\nlived only for the other!\n\nAnd yet they were very different outwardly and inwardly. Martin,\nthick-set and short-necked, was awkward and silent in the presence of\nstrangers. His bushy, lowering eyebrows gave his face a dark look, and\nhis words came with difficulty and by fits and starts as if speaking\nwere in itself torture--in fact one might have taken him for a hard\nmisanthropist, if he had not had such an honest, hearty look in his\neyes, and such a good-natured, almost childlike smile that it sometimes\nillumined his broad, coarsely-cut features like a ray of sunlight.\n\nHow utterly different was Johannes! His eyes beamed into the world so\nfrankly and cheerfully; the corners of his mouth seemed constantly\ntwitching with fun and merriment; and over his whole lithe, pliant\nfigure was cast the glamour of youth. The lassies all noticed it, and\nsent many a glance after him, and many a blush, many a warm squeeze of\nthe hand told him plainly, \"You could easily win my love.\" Johannes did\nnot care much about these matters. He was not yet \"ripe for love,\" and\npreferred a game of skittles to a dance, and would rather sit with his\nsilent brother beside the lock than walk with Rose or Gretel.\n\nThe two brothers had promised each other one still, solemn evening,\nthat they would never part and that no third person should ever come\nbetween them in love or in hate.\n\nBut they had made their reckoning without taking into account the Royal\nRecruiting Commission. The time came for Johannes to serve in the army.\nHe had to go far, far away, to Berlin, to the Uhlans of the Guard. It\nwas a hard trial for both of them. Martin kept his trouble to himself\nas usual, but impetuous Johannes behaved as if he were absolutely\ninconsolable, so that he was well teased at parting by his comrades.\nHis grief was, however, not of long duration. The fatigues of service\nas a recruit, the novelty of it all, the lively bustle of the\nmetropolis, left him little time for dreaming and only now and then, as\nhe lay in the calm dawn on his camp bed, a great longing came over him;\nthe homely mill gleamed through the darkness like a lost Paradise and\nthe clatter of the wheels sounded in his ears like heavenly music. But\nas soon as he heard the trumpet call, the vision passed away.\n\nMartin fared worse at the mill, where he was now quite alone, for he\ncould not reckon as companions the millhands, or old David, an\ninheritance from his father. Friends he had never had either in the\nvillage or elsewhere. Johannes sufficed him and took their place\nentirely. He slunk about brooding in silence, his mind ever gloomier,\nhis thoughts ever darkened, and at last melancholy took such hold of\nhim that the vision of his victim began to haunt him. He was sensible\nenough to know that he could not go on living like this, and forcibly\nsought to distract his thoughts--went on Sundays to the village dance\nand visited the neighboring hamlets under pretense of trade interests.\nBut as for the result of all this--well, one fine day at the\ncommencement of his second year of service, Johannes got a letter from\nhis brother. It ran as follows:\n\n\n\"My Dear Boy:\n\n\"I shall have to write it some time, even though you will be angry with\nme. I could not bear my loneliness any longer and have made up my mind\nto enter into the matrimonial state. Her name is Gertrude Berling, and\nshe is the daughter of a wind-miller in Lehnort, two miles from here.\nShe is very young and I love her very much. The wedding is to be in six\nweeks. If you can, get leave of absence for it.\n\n\"Dear brother, I beg of you, do not be vexed with me. You know\nyou will always have a home at the mill whether there is a mistress\nthere or not. Our fatherly inheritance belongs to us both, in any\ncase. She sends you her kind regards. You once met each other at a\nshooting-match, and she liked you very much, but you took no notice of\nher, and she sends you word she was immensely offended with you.\n\n           \"Farewell,\n\n                 \"Your faithful brother,\n\n                                    \"Martin.\"\n\n\nJohannes was a very spoiled creature. Martin's engagement appeared to\nhim as high treason against their brotherly love. He felt as if his\nbrother had deceived him and meanly deprived him of his due rights.\nHenceforth a stranger was to rule where hitherto he alone had been\nking, and his position at the mill was to depend on her favor and good\nwill. Even the friendly message from the wind-miller's daughter did not\ncalm or appease him. When the day of the wedding came, he took no\nleave, but only sent his love and good wishes by his old schoolfellow\nFranz Maas, who was just left off from military service.\n\nSix months later he himself was at liberty.\n\nHow now, Johannes? We are so obstinate that on no account will we go\nhome, and prefer to seek our fortune in foreign parts; we roam about,\nnow to right, now to left, up hill and down hill and rub off our horns,\nand when, four weeks later, we come to the conclusion that in spite of\nthe wind-miller's daughter there is no place in the world like the\nRockhammer mill, we went our way homewards most cheerfully.\n\nOne sunny day in May Johannes arrived in Marienfeld.\n\nFranz Mass, who had set up the autumn before as a worthy baker, was\nstanding, with his legs apart, in front of his shop, looking up\ncontentedly at the tin \"Bretzel\" swinging over his door in the gentle\nnoon-day breeze, when he saw an Uhlan come swaggering down the village\nstreet with his cap cocked to one side and clinking his spurs. His\nbrave ex-soldier's heart beat quicker under his white baker's apron as\nhe took his pipe out of his mouth and shaded his eyes with his hand.\n\n\"Well, I declare, it's Johannes!\"\n\n\"Hallo, old fellow!\" And they were greeting each other with effusion.\n\n\"Where do you hail from so late in the season? Have you had to do extra\nservice?\"\n\n\"For shame!\"\n\nThen they start questions and confessions. About the captain and the\nsergeant and old Knapphaus and the fair baker's daughter whom they used\nto call \"Crumpet Mary,\" and who lived in the baker's shop close to the\nbarracks--they all have their turn and not one is forgotten.\n\n\"And what about yourself? Did they recognize you in the village?\" asks\nFranz, transferring his insatiable thirst for knowledge to more homely\nground.\n\n\"Not a soul,\" laughs Johannes, complacently twirling his budding\ncavalry moustache which points heavenwards in two smart ends.\n\n\"And at home?\"\n\nJohannes makes a serious face and says he must go.\n\n\"Oh, you're only on the way there now? Then I suppose it's bobbing\nabout in there?\" And he gives him a searching thump on his chest.\n\nJohannes laughs curtly and then suppresses a sigh as if to master his\nexcitement.\n\nFranz lays his hand on his shoulder and says: \"Well, you will find a\nsister-in-law--upon my word, she's a sister-in-law worth having!\" He\nsmacks his lips and winks his eye. It fills Johannes again with his\nformer defiance and rage. He shrugs his shoulders contemptuously,\nshakes hands with his friend and goes off clinking his spurs.\n\nThree more minutes' walk; then he is through the village. There is the\nchurch! Poor old thing--it has got even a bit more tumble-down!\n\nBut the black larches still rustle as of old, and theirs is the same\nsweet song of happy promise which they sang to him on the day of his\nconfirmation. There on the left is the inn--by Jove, they have put\nup a massive new doorway, and at the window there stand immense\nliquor-flasks, filled with flaming red and viciously green fluids. Mine\nhost of the \"Crown\" has been looking up! That side-path leads down to\nthe river. And there is the mill, the goal of his dreams! How\ncomfortable the old thatched roof looks across the alder bushes, how\nsnowy white are the cherry blossoms in the garden, how cheerily the\nmill-wheels clatter: \"Welcome, welcome!\"\n\nHow the dear old moss-grown weir seems to chant a blessing from afar!\nHe pushes his cap a degree further back and pulls himself together\nresolutely, for he is determined to master his emotion.\n\nAll the fields stretching on either side of the road belong to the\nmill. On the right is winter-rye, as of old; but on the left, where\nthere used to be a potato-patch, there is now a kitchen garden--there\nare asparagus-plants and young beetroots arranged in prim and orderly\nrows.\n\nBetween the long vegetable borders, about five paces from the fence, he\nsees the lithe, robust figure of a girl assiduously bending to her\nwork.\n\nWho can that be? Does she belong to the mill? Perhaps a new maid!\nHardly that, though, for she looks too smart, too neat; her shoes are\ntoo light, her apron too dainty, the white kerchief so picturesquely\ndraped round her head is of too fine a texture. If only she would not\nso completely shade her face! Now she looks up! Good heavens, what a\nsweet girl! How her bonny cheeks glow, how her dark eyes gleam, how her\npouting lips seem to invite a kiss!\n\nAs she perceives him, she drops her hoe and stares at him.\n\n\"Good-day,\" he says, and touches his cap somewhat awkwardly. \"Do you\nknow whether the miller is at home?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's at home,\" she says, and goes on staring at him.\n\n\"I wonder what she means by it,\" he thinks, fighting against his\nembarrassment; and as, since his Berlin days, he has every reason to\nconsider himself well-nigh irresistible, it is a point of honor with\nhim now to step close up to the hedge and attempt a little flirtation\nwith the girl.\n\n\"Well, always busy?\" he asks, just for the sake of asking, and in his\nconfusion clutches at the ends of his moustache. Uhlan, beware! Take\ncare!!\n\n\"Yes, I'm always busy,\" she repeats mechanically, while she stares at\nhis face unceasingly; and suddenly, raising her hand and spreading out\nall five fingers as if she would like to point at him with them all,\nshe says, as she bursts out laughing:\n\n\"Why, you're Johannes!\"\n\n\"Yes, tha-at's m-e,\" he stammers in astonishment; \"and who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm his wife!\"\n\n\"What? You--his--Martin's?\"\n\n\"Hm!\" And she nods at him with assumed dignity, while her eyes are full\nof roguishness.\n\n\"But you look like a young girl!\"\n\n\"It isn't so very long since I was one,\" she laughs.\n\nThey stand on opposite sides of the fence and look at each other.\n\nCollecting herself, she wipes her hands ostentatiously on her apron,\nand stretches them out to him through the lattice-work.\n\n\"Welcome, brother-in-law!\"\n\nHe returns her hand-shake, but is silent.\n\n\"Do you perhaps intend to be angry with me, brother-in-law?\" she says,\nand looks up at him roguishly. He feels absolutely powerless before\nher, and can only laugh awkwardly and say: \"I--angry? Oh, dear no!\"\n\n\"It looked rather like it!\" she says, and lifting her finger\nthreateningly, she adds: \"Oh, I should only just have liked you to\nattempt such a thing!\" Thereupon she sticks her chin into her collar\nand bursts into a soft chuckle.\n\n\"Well, you are funny! he says, with a rather more easy laugh.\n\n\"I funny?--never! You go along now; meanwhile I will run in through the\ngarden and fetch Martin.\"\n\nAnd she starts to run away, then stops suddenly, puts her finger to her\nnose and says: \"Wait a minute; I will come across to you.\"\n\nBefore he has time to stretch out a helping hand, she had slipped, as\nnimble as a lizard, in between the boards of the fencing.\n\n\"Well, here I am,\" she says, smoothing out her dress, while she lets\nthe knotted kerchief fall loosely onto her neck, so that a mass of\nlittle brown curls escape round her forehead and neck and begin to\ndance in the wind as if delighted at their newly regained freedom.\n\nHis gaze rests with astonishment on the fresh, girlish beauty of this\nyoung wife, who behaves like a wild unconstrained child.\n\nShe notices the look, and slightly blushing, she passes her hand over\nthe curly disorder which will not be fettered.\n\nFor a while they walk beside each other in silence.\n\nShe looks down and smiles as if she too had suddenly learned shyness.\nConversation flags till they have got through the large entrance-gate.\nJohannes looks about and gives a cry of amazement. He cannot believe\nhis eyes.\n\nEverything all around is changed, everything is beautified. The round\ncourt-yard, which in rainy weather used to be one immense pool of dirt\nand in dry weather one mass of dust-clouds, now is all covered with\nturf like some flowering meadow, the doors of the store-houses and\nstables are resplendent with bright red paint and bear white numbers.\nIn the middle of the open space is an artistic pigeon-house, like a\nlittle Swiss chalet, and in front of the house is a newly built\nveranda, round whose shining windowpanes and dainty wood-carving some\nyoung creepers twine their budding tendrils. The mill lies before his\necstatic gaze like the very home of peace and innocence. He folds his\nhands in emotion and asks \"Who has done all this?\"\n\nShe looks about without speaking.\n\n\"You?\" he asks, amazed.\n\n\"I helped,\" she answers modestly.\n\n\"But you originated it?\"\n\nShe smiles. This smile makes her appear older, and for a moment her\nchild-like face is suffused with a shimmer of womanly grace.\n\n\"Your hand is blessed,\" he says softly and shyly, more in earnest than\nis his wont.\n\nHe cannot help thinking of his dead mother, who so often complained of\nthe dreadful dust, and that in the whole space outside there was not a\nsingle place where she could sit down in comfort.\n\n\"If only she could have lived to see this,\" he murmurs to himself.\n\n\"Mother?\" she asks him.\n\nHe looks up astonished. That she should not say \"your mother\" startles\nhim at first, then it gives him a feeling of intense pleasure such as\nhe has never before in his life felt. A sort of happy glow enters into\nhis heart and will not leave it. So there is now in the world a young,\nbeautiful strange woman who speaks of his mother as if she had been\nhers too, as if she herself were his sister, the sister he had so often\nlonged for in his foolish younger days, when his gaze used to rest with\nadmiration on other girls.\n\nAnd now she softly repeats her question.\n\n\"Yes, mother,\" he answers, and looks at her gratefully.\n\nShe bears his look for a second; then drops her eyes and says in some\nconfusion; \"I wonder where Martin can be?\"\n\n\"In the mill, I suppose!\"\n\n\"Yes, in the mill, of course,\" she answers quickly; and with the words\n\"I will fetch him,\" she hurries away. Almost without thinking he stares\nafter the girlish figure bounding so lightly across the grass.\n\nEverything about her seems to be flying and fluttering--her skirts, her\napron-strings, the kerchief about her neck, her untameable, entangled\nmass of curls.\n\nHe remains for a time gazing after her as if spell-bound; then he\nlaughingly shakes his head and walks to the veranda. There he notices a\ndainty work-table and on it a round wicker-work-basket. Across its edge\nhangs a piece of work commenced, a long, white strip embroidered with\nflowers and leaves such as women use for insertion. Without thinking he\ntakes the piece of cambric in his hand and examines the cunning\nstitches till his sister-in-law's laughing voice reaches his ears.\n\nLike a surprised criminal he quickly lets the embroidery drop--there\nshe is already, bending round the corner; and the flour-whitened,\nsquare-set figure she is so merrily dragging behind her and who is so\nawkwardly trying to divest himself of her little, clutching hands, and\ndispersing thick, white dust-clouds all round, that is, why, that is--\n\n\"Martin, dear old Martin!\" and he rushes out to embrace him.\n\nThe awkward movements cease; the bushy eye-brows are drawn up--the\ngood-natured, quiet smile grows stony--the whole figure is fixed--the\nman draws back--but next moment he rushes forward towards his\nnewly-regained darling.\n\nIn silence the brothers clasp each other.\n\nThen after a time Martin takes the head of the returned wanderer\nbetween his two hands and, knitting his brows darkly and gnawing at his\nunder-lip he looks long and earnestly into his brother's beaming,\nlaughing eyes. Thereupon he sits down on the seat in the veranda, rests\nhis elbows on his knees and looks down.\n\n\"Why are you so pensive, Martin?\" Johannes asks softly, laying his hand\non his brother's shoulder.\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't I be pensive?\" he answers, with a peculiar sort of\nlow grunt which accompanies all his meager speeches. \"Ah--you rascal!\"\nhe continues, and the good-natured grin which is his in happy moments\nspreads over his heavily-cut features. \"You made up your mind to be\nangry--you, you?\" Then he jumps up and takes his wife's hand. \"Look at\nhim, Trude; he wanted to be angry, the silly fellow! Come here, boy!\nEh--here she is--look at her properly, well! Do you think you could be\nangry with _her_?\"\n\nThen he drops clumsily onto his seat, so that a fresh cloud of white\ndust flies up, looks at Johannes, laughs to himself a little and says\nat last: \"Trude, fetch a clothes brush!\" Trude bursts out laughing and\nskips away singing. When she returns waving the desired object high in\nthe air, he gives the order: \"Now brush him!\"\n\n\"When a miller or a sweep grows affectionate, there's sure to be a\nmisfortune,\" Johannes says, attempting a joke, and tries to take the\nbrush out of her hand.\n\n\"Please allow me, Mr. Johannes,\" she protests, hiding the brush under\nher apron.\n\nMartin hits the bench with his fist. \"Mr. Johannes! Well, I\nnever--what's the meaning of that? Haven't you made friends yet?--eh?\"\n\nJohannes is silent and Trude brushes away at him with great vigor.\n\n\"Then I suppose you haven't even given each other a kiss yet?\"\n\nTrude lets the brush fall suddenly. Johannes says \"H'm\" and busies\nhimself with rolling the wheel of one of his spurs along the scraper\nstanding at the entrance.\n\n\"It's the proper thing to do, however! Now then!\"\n\nJohannes faces about and twirls his moustache, determined to get over\nhis awkward predicament by playing the man of the world; but with all\nthat he has not the courage to bend down to her. He stands there as\nstiff as a post and waits till she holds up her little mouth; then for\na moment he presses his trembling lips upon hers, and feels how a\nslight shudder runs through her frame.\n\nA moment later it is all over. With a shy smile they stand next to one\nanother--both blushing all over.--Martin slaps his knees with his hands\nand declares it has been as good as a side-splitting farce. Then he\nsuddenly gets up and walks off. He must ponder over his happiness in\nsolitude.\n\n\nIn the afternoon the brothers go together into the mill. Trude stands\nat the window and looks after them, and, when Johannes turns around,\nshe smiles and hides behind the curtain. On the threshold Johannes\nstands still and leans his head against the door-post, and deep emotion\nfills him as he gazes into the semi-darkness of the dear old place from\nwhich proceeds such a din of wheels that it nearly stuns him, while the\ndraught drives into his face great whitish-grey clouds of flour,\nbran-dust and steam. Side by side the various \"runs\" open out before\nhim. On the left, nearest the wall, the old \"bolting-run,\" for the\nfinest flour; then the \"bruising-run,\" where the bran and flour remain\ntogether; then the \"groats-run,\" where the barley is freed from its\nhusks; and finally the \"cylinder-run,\" one of the new kind only\nrecently added.--They have also had a new spiral alley and a lift made.\nFashion now-a-days requires all these innovations.\n\nMartin puts his hands in his pockets and saunters along with his pipe\nin his mouth in silent self-content. Then he takes hold of Johannes'\nhand and proceeds to explain the new invention--how the fine flour is\ncaught up by the spiral and conveyed to the suspiral where small pails,\nrunning along a belting, raise it through two stories, almost to the\nroofing, and then empty it into the silken, cylinder-like funnels\nthrough the fine network of which it has to pass before becoming fit\nfor use. Listening breathlessly, Johannes drinks in his brother's\nscant, slowly uttered words, and is surprised how ignorant one grows in\nthe army; for all these things are sealed books to him.\n\nBusiness is flourishing. All the works are in full swing, and the\n'prentices have plenty to do with pouring the grain into the\nmill-hopper and watching the outflow of the flour and the bran.\n\n\"I have three now,\" says Martin, pointing to the white-powdered\nfellows, one of whom is continually running up and down the stairs.\n\n\"And is David here yet?\" asks Johannes.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" answers Martin; and makes a face as if the mere idea\nof David's being no longer at the mill had scared him.\n\n\"Where has he hidden himself, the old fellow?\" Johannes laughingly\nasks.\n\n\"David! David!\" shouts Martin's lusty voice above all the clatter of\nthe wheels.\n\nThen from out the darkness, by the motor machine, which rises\nCyclops-like from below the woodwork of the galleries, there emerges a\nlong, lanky figure, dipped in flour--a face shows itself on which the\nindifference of old age has left nothing to be read--a slightly\nreddened nose, which almost meets the bristly chin, weak and sulky eyes\nhidden beneath bushy brows, and a mouth which seems to be continually\nchewing.\n\n\"What do you want me for, master?\" he asks, planting himself in front\nof the brothers without removing the clay pipe which hangs loosely\nbetween his lips.\n\n\"Here's Johannes,\" says Martin, patting the old man's shoulder, while a\ngood-natured smile crosses his countenance.\n\n\"Don't you know me any more, David?\" asks Johannes, holding out his\nhand in a friendly manner. The old man spits out a stream of brown\njuice from between his teeth, considers awhile and then mumbles:\n\n\"Why shouldn't I know you?\"\n\n\"And how are you?\"\n\n\"How should I be?\"--Then he begins fumbling about at a sack of flour,\ntying and untying the string with his bony fingers; then when he has\nmade sure that he is no longer wanted, he withdraws once more into his\ndark corner.\n\nMartin's face beams. \"There's a faithful soul for you, Johannes--28\nyears of service, eh! And always industrious and conscientious.\"\n\n\"By the bye, what does he do?\"\n\nMartin looks confused. \"Well--look here--eh--hard to say--position of\ntrust--eh--faithful soul, faithful soul.\"\n\n\"Does the faithful soul still occasionally prig something from the\nflour-sacks?\" asks Johannes laughing.\n\nMartin shrugs his shoulders impatiently and mutters something about \"28\nyears of service,\" and closing an eye.\n\n\"He seems still to owe me a grudge,\" says Johannes, \"for having\ndiscovered the hiding place to which he had carried his hardly-stolen\nlittle hoard.\"\n\n\"You will persist in being prejudiced against him,\" answers Martin,\n\"just like Trude too--you are unjust towards him,--most unjust.\"\n\nJohannes laughingly shakes his head; then he points to a door leading\nto a newly erected partition.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nMartin moves about uneasily. \"My office,\" he then stammers, and, as\nJohannes attempts to open the door, he runs up to him and catches him\nback by his coat-tails.\n\n\"I beg of you,\" he mutters, \"do not cross that threshold. Not\nto-day--nor any other day.--I have my reasons.\" Johannes looks at him\nin vexation. \"Since when have you secrets from me,\" he feels impelled\nto ask, but his brother's trustful, pleading look closes his lips, and\narm in arm they leave the mill together.\n\nEvening has come.--The great wheel is at rest, and with it the host of\nsmaller ones.--Silence is over all the mill and only in the distance\nthe rushing water of the weir sings its monotonous song. Here of\ncourse--in front of the house--the mill-brook is quiet and peaceful, as\nthough it had nothing in the world to do but to carry water-lilies and\nto mirror the setting sun in its depths. Like a golden-red, dark-edged\nstreamer it winds along between the straggling thicket of alders, in\nwhich a choir of nightingales are just clearing their throats and, all\nunconscious of their superior merit, are about to commence a singing\ncompetition with the frogs down there. The three human beings who are\nhenceforth to pass their days together in this blossoming, song-laden\nsolitude have already become lovingly intimate. They sit on the veranda\naround the white-spread supper-table, the food upon which has to-day\nfound little appreciation, and their gaze is full of intense content.\nMartin rests his head on his hands and draws great clouds of smoke from\nhis short pipe, from time to time emitting a sound which is something\nof a laugh, something of a growl.\n\nJohannes has quite buried himself in the mass of foliage and lets the\ntendrils of the wild vine play about his face. They tremble and flutter\nwith his every breath.\n\nTrude has pushed her head deep into her collar and is looking furtively\nacross at the two brothers, like a high-spirited child that would like\nto get into mischief but first wants to make quite sure that no one is\nwatching. This silence is evidently not to her taste, but she is\nalready too well schooled to break it. Meantime she amuses herself by\nmaking little pellets of bread and shooting them, unnoticed by either\nof the brothers, into the midst of the herd of sparrows hopping about\nthe veranda, with greedy intent. There is one in particular, a little,\ndirty fellow, who beats all the others' cunning and alertness. As soon\nas a grain of food comes rolling along he spreads both wings, screams\nlike mad, and while fighting he endeavors to get it away by beating his\nwings, so that he can take possession of it comfortably while the\nothers are still wildly hacking at each other. This maneuver he repeats\nfour or five times, and always successfully, till one of his comrades\nfinds out his trick and does it still better.\n\nThis gives Trude a fit of laughing which she tries to suppress by\nstuffing her handkerchief into her mouth and holding her breath till\nshe gets quite blue in the face--Then when she finds it absolutely\nimpossible to contain herself any longer, she jumps up to get away, but\nbefore she reaches the door, her laughter bursts forth and she\ndisappears into the darkness of the passage, screaming loudly with\ndelight.\n\nBoth brothers are roused from their dreaming.\n\n\"What's up?\" asks Johannes, startled. Martin shakes his head as he\nlooks after his young, foolish wife whose tricks he well knows; then\nafter a time he takes his brother's hand and says, pointing to the\ndoor:\n\n\"Well--does she look as if she would oust you?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" answers Johannes with a somewhat uneasy laugh.\n\n\"Oh, my boy,\" growls Martin, scratching his bushy head, \"what a lot of\nworry I have been through!--I tossed about in my bed a long night when\nI thought of you! I mean on account of the wrong I might be doing\nyou.\"--Then after a time--\"And yet when I look at her--she is so\nfair--so innocent--say yourself, my boy, could I possibly help loving\nher? When I saw her--ah--why it was all over with me.--In so many ways\nshe reminded me of you--merry, and bright-eyed and full of mischief,\njust like you.--Of course she was a child and has remained one to the\npresent day--Charmless and wild and playful as a child.--And I tell\nyou--she wants holding in tighter--her spirits run away with her.--But\nthat is just how I love her to be\"--a tender look brightens his\nfeatures--\"and if I rightly think it over, I would not even miss one of\nher ridiculous doings. You know I always must have some one to watch\nover--formerly I had you, now she is the one.\"\n\nAfter relieving his feelings in this manner, he once more becomes\nsilent.\n\n\"And are you happy?\" asks Johannes.\n\nMartin hides himself in a thick cloud of smoke, and from out of that he\nmutters after a time:\n\n\"Well, that depends!\"\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"On your not being angry with her.\"\n\n\"I angry with her?\"\n\n\"Well, well, you needn't make excuses!\"\n\nJohannes does not reply. He will soon convince his brother of better\nthings--and closing his eyes, he buries his head once more in the\nwaving foliage. A gleam of light causes him to look up. Trude is\nstanding on the threshold, holding a lamp and looking ashamed of\nherself. Her charming, childlike face is bathed in a red glow and the\ndrooping lashes cast long, semi-circling shadows on her full cheeks.\n\n\"What a ridiculous creature you are!\" says Martin, stroking her ruffled\nhair tenderly.\n\n\"Won't you go to rest, Johannes?\" she asks with great seriousness,\nthough there is still the sound of suppressed laughter in her voice.\n\n\"Good-night, brother!\"\n\n\"Wait, I am coming too!\"\n\nJohannes shakes hands with his sister-in-law, while she turns her face\naside with a furtive smile.\n\nMartin takes the lamp from her and precedes his brother up the stairs.\nAt the top he takes his hand and gazes silently and deeply into his\neyes, like one who cannot yet contain his happiness; then he softly\ncloses the door.\n\nJohannes sighs and stretches himself, pressing both hands to his\nbreast. His heart is heavy for very joy. He feels as if he must go\nafter his brother and relieve his feelings by a few loving, grateful\nwords, but already he hears his steps downstairs in the entrance. It is\ntoo late. But his mind must be calmer before he can attempt to sleep.\n\nHe puts out the lamp and pushes open a window. The night air cools his\nbrow.--How soothing it is--how it wafts peace!\n\nHe bends over the window-ledge, whistles a song to himself and looks\nout into the night. The apple-tree beneath him is in full bloom--a\nwaving sea of blossoms. How often as a child he has climbed up there,\nhow often, tired with play, he has leant, dreaming, against its trunk,\nwhile its rustling leaves told him fairy stories. And when in autumn a\ngust of wind swept through the branches, it brought down a shower of\nrosy-cheeked apples, which fell almost into his lap.--What ecstasy that\nwas! How many things enter one's thoughts as one whistles! Each note\nawakens a new song, each melody conjures up new reminiscences. And with\nthe old songs there returns the old longing and flies on butterfly's\nwings through a vast empire between the moon and the morning sun!--\n\nAnd as he looks down upon the earth melting into darkness, he sees how\na window is softly opened and an upturned face bends far out. From out\nof a pale, gleaming oval, framed in a background of shadowy hair, two\ndark eyes glanced up at him, slyly and mischievously.\n\nAbruptly he stops whistling; then a teasing laugh greets his ears, and\nhis sister-in-law's merry voice cries: \"Go on, Johannes!\"\n\nAnd when he will not do her bidding, she points her own lips and\nattempts a few very imperfect notes.\n\nThen Martin's deep bass voice becomes audible in the house, saying in a\ntone of paternal reproof:\n\n\"None of your nonsense, Trude! Let him sleep!\"\n\n\"But he doesn't sleep,\" she answers, pouting like a scolded child. Then\nthe window is shut. The voices die away.\n\nJohannes laughingly shakes his head and goes to bed, but he cannot\nsleep. Those flowers prevent him which Trude has placed at his\nbed-side, and the leaves of which hang right over the edge of the bed.\nPale bluish bunches of lilac and the nebulous white stars of narcissi\nare mingled together. He turns round, kneels up in bed and buries his\nface in the flowery depths. Fondly the leaflets kiss his eye-lids and\nhis lips.\n\nSuddenly he listens. From underneath the floor, as it were from the\nbowels of the earth, comes a quiet laugh. It is soft as a breath of\nwind passing over the grass, but so merry, so full of happiness.\n\nHe listens, hoping to hear it again, but all is still. \"Crazy little\nbody, you,\" he says amused, then falls back upon his pillow and drops\nto sleep smiling.\n\nNext day Johannes fetches down his working-clothes. They are a bit\ntight across the shoulders. But then, one gets broader.\n\nThe sun is already high in the heavens. As if it could shine so\nbrightly, right into one's heart, anywhere else!--The sun of home is a\nwonderful thing. What it looks upon, it gilds, and when it touches\none's lips, they begin to sing.\n\n\"It is lovely at home--hurrah!\"\n\n\"Now I have a nest of merry birds in the house,\" laughs Martin, coming\nto greet him. \"Go on singing. I am used to that from Trude--but what\nare you doing in that white coat?\"\n\n\"I suppose you think I am going to be idle here?\"\n\n\"At least just for a day!\"\n\n\"Not for an hour! My lazy times are over!\"\n\nMartin has meanwhile noticed the flowers at the bed-side and says with\na grumbling laugh: \"Now there's a little witch for you! I have\nforbidden it for myself, and now she begins the same nonsense with\nothers. That's why you look so pale this morning.\n\n\"I, pale? Not in the least!\"\n\n\"Don't say a word! I'll cure her of her tricks.\"\n\nWith that they go downstairs.\n\nTrude is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"She has been in the garden since five o'clock,\" says Martin with a\npleased smile. \"Everything goes like clock-work since she's at the head\nof affairs. As quick as a weasel, up at peep of day and always merry,\nalways ready with a song and a laugh.\"\n\nOn their way to the mill a young turnip whizzes past the brothers',\nheads. Martin turns round and laughingly threatens with his finger.\n\n\"Who was that?\" asks Johannes, peering in bewilderment round the empty\nyard.\n\n\"Who but she?\"\n\n\"But can you see her anywhere?\"\n\n\"Not a trace of her! Oh, she's a teasing elf who can become invisible\nat will.\" And with a beaming face he follows his brother to the mill.\n\nThe hours pass by. Johannes wants to show what he can do and works with\ntwofold energy.\n\nWhile he is superintending the storing of the grain on the gallery,\nsome one from below gently pulls his coat-tail. He looks down;--Trude,\nwith sun-heated face and sparkling eyes, stands on the steps and\ninvites him to come to breakfast. \"In a minute,\" he says, finishes his\ntask and jumps down.\n\n\"Brr!\" she says, shaking herself, \"how you look!\n\n\"What's the matter?\n\n\"Well--yesterday I liked you better.\" Then she gives him her hand with a\n\"good-morning,\" and trips down the stairs in front of him, strewing the\nflour about for fun as she goes.\n\nWhen they get to the door of the partition that Martin called his\noffice, she pulls a mysterious face and raises her hand silently as if\nto lay a ghost.\n\nThen after a moment she asks: \"I say, what has he got in there!\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Mayn't you go in either?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Thank goodness! Then I am not the only one who's kept in the dark. In\nthere he sits, and every stranger is allowed to go in to him, only not\nI. If I want him, I have to ring.--Say yourself whether that's nice of\nhim? Surely I am no longer such a child that he should--well, I won't\nsay anything,--one oughtn't to speak ill of one's husband--but you are\nhis own brother--do put in a good word for me, so that he tells me what\nis in there. For I am dying to know.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose he has told me?\"\n\n\"Well, then we must comfort each other. Come along.\"--And in one jump\nshe flies up the three steps leading to the entrance.\n\nDuring breakfast she suddenly puts on a serious air and speaks grandly\nof her weighty household cares. Of course, she says, she had to be\nindependent at home already, for her poor little mother died many years\npast, and she had to superintend her father's household long before she\nwas confirmed; but it was only a small one, for her father had to\nmanage with one apprentice and almost worked himself to death--poor\nfather!\n\nHer eyes are full of tears. She is ashamed and turns away. Then she\njumps up and asks: \"Have you had enough?\" And when he says \"Yes,\" she\ncontinues: \"Come along into the garden. There's an arbor which is\nsplendid for a chat.\"\n\n\"That one at the end of the long path?--that is my favorite place too.\"\n\nSide by side they stroll through the mazy garden walks, all bathed in\nglowing sunlight, and both feel relieved when they reach the cool shade\nof the leafy recess.\n\nShe throws herself down carelessly on the grassy bank and puts her\nplump, sun-burnt arms under her head. Through the dense foliage stray\ngleams of sunlight break, painting her dress with golden patches,\nplaying on her neck and face, and passing over her head till they make\nher curly brown hair all aglow.\n\nJohannes sits down opposite her and gazes at her with undisguised\nadmiration. He is convinced that never before in his life has he seen\nso much loveliness as there in the half-reclining figure of his\ncharming young sister-in-law, and he thinks of his brother's saying:\n\"Was it possible for me not to love her?\"\n\n\"I don't know why I feel so inclined to talk about myself to-day,\" she\nsays with her sympathetic smile, while she shifts her head to a more\ncomfortable position. \"Do you care to listen?\" He nods his head.\n\n\"I am glad of that, Johannes! Well, you may imagine that at home bread\nwas not over plentiful--not to speak of the butter which by rights\nbelongs to it--and if I had not had my little garden, the produce of\nwhich we could sell in the town, we should not have managed at all.\n'Why does everyone take all their grain to the Rockhammer mill, without\nthinking that the poor wind-miller wants to live too?' That is what we\noften thought, and we positively hated your place. Then all of a sudden\ncomes Martin--says he wants to be neighborly--and is kind and good to\nfather and kind and good to me--and brings toffee and sugar-candy for\nthe boys, so that we are all mad on him. And in the end he informs\nfather that he absolutely must have me for his wife. 'But she hasn't a\npenny,' says my father, and fancy--he took me without a farthing!\nYou may imagine how glad I was, for father had often said to me:\n'Now-a-days men only marry for money; you are a poor girl, Trude, so\nmake up your mind to be an old maid. And now I was engaged before my\n17th birthday.--And then, you know, I had liked Martin very much for a\nlong time already--for even if he is rather shy and quiet I could see\nby his eyes what a kind heart he has! Only he can't let himself go, as\nhe would perhaps like to. I know how good he is, and even if he growls\never so much and scolds me, I shall be fond of him all my life!\" She is\nsilent for a moment and passes her hand across her face as if to wipe\naway the sunbeam which is gilding her lashes and making her eyes\nglisten. \"And fancy how good he is to my family,\" she then resumes\neagerly, as if she could not find enough love to heap on Martin's head.\n\"He absolutely wanted to give them a yearly allowance--I don't know how\nmuch--but I would not allow that--for I did not wish to induce my\nfather in his old days to take alms, even though it was from his\nson-in-law. But one thing I asked for--for permission to continue\nthe gardening as I had done at home and to use the proceeds as\npocket-money. What I do with it is my own business.\" She smiles across\nat him slyly and then continues: \"They really do want it though, at\nhome, for you see, there are three boys who all want to be fed and\nclothed, and they have to keep a servant too now, since I left home.\"\n\n\"Have you no sisters?\" he asks.\n\nShe shakes her head; then she says, suddenly bursting out laughing.\n\"It's really too bad. Not even one for a wife for you.\"\n\nHe joins in her laughter and observes: \"I don't seem to want a wife so\nmuch now.\"\n\n\"As what?\"\n\n\"As a sister.\"\n\n\"Well, she is here,\" says she, jumping up and stepping up to him; then,\nas if ashamed of her impetuosity, she drops down again on to the grass,\nblushing.\n\n\"Yes, will you be that?\" he says with beaming eyes.\n\nShe pulls a little face and observes carelessly. \"That's nothing much\nto be! Sister-in-law is in itself already as much as half a sister.\"\nThen, smilingly looking him up and down, she remarks: \"I think one\nmight put up with you as a brother.\"\n\n\"Five foot ten--been Uhlan of the Guard--does that suffice?\"\n\n\"And you might even turn out a good playfellow.\"\n\n\"Do you require one?\"\n\n\"Yes, very badly! It is so quiet and solemn here. There's not a soul to\nromp about with as I used to with my brothers at home. Sometimes I felt\nhalf inclined to collar one of the mill-hands, but dignity and respect\nforbade such a thing.\"\n\n\"Well, I am here now,\" he laughs.\n\nAnd she: \"I set great hopes on you!\"--\n\n\"Then collar me!\"\n\n\"You are too floury for me.\"\n\n\"A fine miller's wife to be afraid of flour,\" he teases.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she interrupts, \"I shall soon put your playing powers to\nthe test.\"\n\nIn the gloaming, when they are once more sitting together on the\nveranda, and Johannes, like his brother, sits dreaming with his head\nhidden in the foliage, he suddenly feels a round, indefinable something\nhit his head and then drop to the ground. \"Perhaps it was a cock-chafer,\"\nhe thinks to himself, but the attack is renewed two or three times.\n\nThen he begins to suspect Trude, who sits like a perfect picture of\ninnocence, humming quite dolefully to herself, \"In Yonder Verdant\nValley,\" while she works little bread pellets which evidently serve as\nher missiles.\n\nHe suppresses a merry laugh, secretly gets hold of a branch of the vine\non which a few of last year's dried-up berries are still hanging, and\nwhen she lets fly a new volley at him, he promptly dispatches his reply\nat her little nose.\n\nShe flinches, looks at him quite amazed for a moment, and when he bends\ntowards her with the most serious face in the world, she bursts into a\nloud, joyful laugh.\n\n\"What's the matter again now?\" asks Martin, startled from his dreaming.\n\n\"He has withstood the test,\" she laughs, putting her arm around her\nhusband's neck.\n\n\"What test?\"\n\n\"If I tell you, you will grumble, so I had better be silent.\"\n\nMartin looks at Johannes questioningly.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" says he smiling; \"it was only nonsense. We\nwere--bombarding each other.\"\n\n\"That's right, children--you bombard one another,\" Martin says, and\ngoes on smoking in silence. Johannes is ashamed of himself, while Trude\nchallenges her playfellow with mischievous glances. \"Full of play,\"\nyes, that was it; that was what Martin Rockhammer had called his wife.\n\nHenceforth there are to be no more of those peaceful silent hours in\nthe gloaming which Martin loves so well.\n\nThe quiet paths of the garden resound with song and laughter, across\nthe lawn figures dart, as quick as the wind, in pursuit of each\nother;--they let loose the dogs and race with them;--they hunt the wild\ncats that frequent the mill-yard--they play hide-and-seek behind the\nhaystacks and hedges.\n\nMartin looks on at all these doings with kindly, fatherly indulgence.\n\nAt the bottom of his heart he would prefer to have his former quiet\nrestored, but they are both so happy in their youth and harmlessness;\ntheir eyes sparkle so, their cheeks are so rosy: it would be a shame to\nspoil their pleasure through grumbling and interference. Why, they are\nbut children! And are there not quieter hours? When Trude says, \"Hans,\nlet us sing,\" they sit down demurely side by side on the veranda or\nsaunter slowly along the river, and when Martin has lighted his pipe\nand is ready to listen, they warble forth their songs into the\ngloaming. These are delightful, solemn moments. The birds in the trees\ntwitter in their slumber, a soft breeze wafts through the branches and\nthe mill-weir with its dull rushing sings the accompaniment. How\nquickly their mood changes! They have begun so merrily, but the\nmelodies grow sadder and sadder, and the sound of their voices more and\nmore mournful. A few minutes ago they were planning nonsense, now they\nhave solemnly folded their hands and are gazing dreamily towards the\nsunset. Johannes' clear tenor tones well with her full deep contralto,\nand his ear never fails him when he is singing seconds in some new\nsong.\n\nIt is strange that they cannot sing when they are alone together. If\nMartin happens to be called away on business during their song, their\nvoices at once begin to waver, they look at each other and smile, turn\naway and smile again; then generally one of them makes a mistake and\nthey stop singing. If Martin is not at home in the evening, or if, as\nis his wont once or twice a week, he has locked himself up in his\n\"office,\" they are both silent as if by a mutual understanding, and\nneither of them would dare to invite the other to sing. Instead of\nsinging they have other more fascinating occupations which are only\npossible when they are sure no third person is listening. While serving\nin the army Johannes had acquired an \"Album of Lyrics,\" in which he had\nmade a collection of everything in the way of merry or sentimental\nsongs that took his fancy. The sentimental kind, however, greatly\npredominate. Love ditties, dirges, ballads about child murderers or\ninnocently convicted criminals, side by side with poetical meditations\non the vanity of life in general--and the gem of the whole collection\nis Kotzebue's \"Outburst of Despair,\" that sentimental effusion which\nwas for half a century the most popular of all German poems. This\ncollection just suits Trude's taste in poetry, and as soon as she is\nalone with Johannes she whispers entreatingly, \"Fetch the Lyrics!\" Then\nthey crouch in some quiet corner, put their heads together--for Trude\ninsists on looking into the book too--and enjoy the delicious feeling\nof awe which thrills them as they read.\n\nThere is that wonderful \"Count Von Sackingen to his Bride:--\"\n\n\n      \"Farewell! The lonely sorrows of my heart\n      In sweetest melody are all enshrined\n      Lest thou shouldst guess how hard it is to part\"\n\n\nand that popular old romance:--\n\n\n      \"Henry slept and at his side\n      Was his richly-dowered bride.\n\n      \"At midnight hour the curtain wide\n      By cold, white hands was pushed aside,\n      And Wilhelmine he did see,\n      For from the grave had risen she.\"\n\n\nThen Trude starts and gazes into the dusk with large, terrified eyes,\nbut she enjoys it intensely.\n\nThe holy of holies in the album is a part bearing the title \"The Lovely\nMiller-Maid.\"\n\n\"Where did you get that from?\" asks Trude, who feels that the title\nmight apply to her.\n\n\"A friend of mine, a musician, had these songs in a big volume of\nmusic, out of which I copied them. The man who wrote them is said to\nhave been called Miller and to have been a miller himself.\"\n\n\"Read, read quickly,\" cries Trude.\n\nBut Johannes refuses. \"They are too sad,\" he says, closing the book;\n\"some other time.\"\n\nAnd so matters rest. But Trude so persecutes him, pouting and\nimploring, that he has to give way to her after all.\n\n\"Come this evening to the weir,\" he says--\"I have to close up the\nsluices. Then we shall be undisturbed and I can read to you--of course\nonly if--\"\n\nHe winked across at the \"office.\" Trude nods. They understand each\nother admirably. After supper Martin withdraws to his retreat, pursued\nby Trude's impatient looks, for she is dying to hear what secrets are\ncontained in the \"Lovely Miller-Maid.\" Arm in arm they walk across the\nmeadow to the weir. The grass is damp with the evening dew. The sky\nglows red and all a-flame. The dark pine wood which forms a sombre\nframe round the picture is clearly silhouetted against the fiery\nbackground. Louder and louder the waters rush towards them.\n\nIn the tumbling waves the glowing sunset is reflected and every drop of\nfrothy spray becomes a dancing spark. On the other side of the weir the\nriver lies like a dark mirror and the alders lay their black shadows\nupon it and dip their image into its clouded depths.\n\nSilently the two go to the weir. A narrow plank which in the center\ncarries a drawbridge, runs alongside the main beam. From this point the\nsluices of the lock, six in number, and supported by solid pillars or\nprops, can be opened or closed at will by the miller. Now in the gentle\nmonth of June the weir gives little trouble, but in early spring or\nautumn at high water or during the drifting of the ice, when all the\nsluices have to be opened wide and some of the supports to be removed,\nso that the volume of water as well as the lumps of ice may pour down\nunhindered, then one has to watch and put forth one's strength, or\nthere is danger of being dragged down along with the wood-work by the\nseething mass. Johannes opens two of the sluices. That suffices for the\npresent. Then he throws the lever to one side and rests his elbow on\nthe rail of the drawbridge. Trude, who has so far watched him in\nsilence, hoists herself up on to the big beam which runs from shore to\nshore on a level with the rail.\n\n\"You will get dizzy, Trude,\" says Johannes, anxiously looking down onto\nthe \"fall,\" where over sloping planks the water shoots down in wild\nhaste and then rushes foaming into the depths below.\n\nTrude gives a short laugh and declares she has often sat here for hours\nand looked down without experiencing the least giddiness, and, if the\nworst came to the worst, why he would be there. Full of suspense she\nlooks towards his pocket, and when he pulls out the book of poems she\nsighs rapturously, in anticipation of delights to come, and clasps her\nhands like a child ready to listen to fairy stories. The tender words\nof the inspired poet flow like music from his lips.\n\n\"The miller's heart delights to roam\"--Trude gives a cry of delight\nand beats time with her feet against the wooden posts. \"I heard a\nmill-stream rushing.\"--Trude listens expectantly. \"I saw the mill\na-gleaming.\"--Trude clasps her hands with pleasure and points to the\nmill. With \"Didst thou mean this, thou rippling stream?\" the lovely\nmiller-maid comes upon the scene and Trude grows serious. \"Had I a\nthousand arms to stir.\" Trude gives slight signs of impatience. \"No\nflowret I will question, nor yet the shining stars.\" Trude smiles to\nherself contentedly, \"Would I might carve it upon every tree!\" Trude\nsighs deeply and closes her eyes; and now proceed the passionate\nfancies of the young, love-frenzied miller, till they reach the cry of\njoy which penetrates above the rippling of the brook, the rushing of\nthe mill-wheels, the song of the birds:\n\n\"The loved miller-maid is mine!\" Trude spreads out both arms, a\nsmile of quiet happiness flits across her face, she shakes her head\nas if to say, \"What in the world can come after this?\"--Then suddenly\ncommences the miller-maid's mysterious liking for green, the\nhunting-horn echoes through the wood, the jaunty huntsman appears.\nTrude grows uneasy, \"What does the fellow want?\" she mutters and hits\nthe beam with her fist. The miller, the poor young miller, soon begins\nto understand.--\"Would I could wander far away, yea, far away from\nhome; if only there were not always green wherever the eye doth roam.\"\nThus the burden of his mournful strain. Trude puts out her hands in\nsuspense and hope; why, it cannot be, things must come right again in\nthe end. And then:\n\n\n            \"Ye tiny flowrets that she gave.\n            Come rest with me in my lonely grave.\"\n\n\nTrude's eyes grow moist, but still she hopes that the hunter may go,\nand the miller-maid think better of it; it cannot, it must not be\notherwise. The miller and the brook begin their sad duologue--the\nmill-brook tries to console him, but for the miller there remains but\none comfort, _one_ rest:\n\n\n      \"Ah! brooklet, little brooklet, thou wouldst comfort my pain,\n      Ah! brooklet, canst thou make my lost love return again?\"\n\n\nTrude nods hastily. \"What has the silly brooklet to do with it? What\ndoes it know of love or pain?\"\n\nAnd then--there comes the mysterious lullaby sung by the waters. Surely\nthe young miller must have fallen asleep on the brink of the rivulet--a\nkiss will waken him and when he opens his eyes the miller-maid will be\nbending over him and saying. \"Forgive me, I love you as much as ever.\"\n\nBut nay--what is the meaning of those words about the small, blue\ncrystal chamber? Why must he sleep till the ocean shall have drunk up\nthe brook? And if the cruel maiden is to throw her kerchief into the\nbrook that his eyes may be covered, why, then the sleeper cannot be\nlying on the water's brink, then he must be lying deep down--Trude\ncovers her face with her hands and bursts into loud, convulsive sobs,\nand when Johannes still persists in reading to the end, she cries out\n\"Stop, stop!\"\n\n\"Trude, whatever is the matter?\"\n\nShe beckons him to leave her alone; her weeping becomes more and more\nviolent; her whole body sways, it seeks a support, it bends backwards.\n\nJohannes gives a terrified scream and springs forward, catching her in\nhis arms. \"For heaven's sake, Trude!\" he gasps, breathing heavily.\nBeads of cold perspiration stand on his brow--but she bows her little\nhead on his breast, flings her arms round his neck and cries her heart\nout.--\n\nNext day Trude says: \"I behaved very childishly yesterday, Hans, and I\nbelieve I only just missed falling down.\"\n\n\"You were already sinking,\" he says, and a shudder passes through him\nat thought of that terrible moment. A sentimental smile crosses her\nface. \"Then there would have been an end once and for all,\" she\nobserves with a deep sigh, but forthwith laughs at herself for her\nsilliness.\n\nThe days pass by. Johannes has fulfilled Trude's keenest expectations\nas a play-fellow. The two have become inseparable; and Martin, the\nthird of the party, can do nothing but look on silently and with a\ngood-natured grumble say \"Yea\" and \"Amen\" to all their pranks.\n\nIt is a pleasure to see them whizzing past, racing each other across\nthe mill-yard as if they had wings to their feet. Trude flies along so\nthat her feet hardly touch the ground, but in spite of that Johannes is\nthe quicker of the two. Even if it takes time, she gets caught in the\nend. As soon as she finds that she cannot escape she cowers like a\nlittle frightened chicken; then when his arms encircle her\ntriumphantly, her lithe body trembles as if his touch shook its very\nfoundations.\n\nDavid, the old servant, very attentively watches these doings from a\ndormer window in the attic, which he makes his customary stand; there\nhe begins scratching his head and mumbling all sorts of unintelligible\nthings to himself.\n\nTrude notices him one day and laughingly points him out to Johannes.\n\n\"We must play some trick on that old sneak,\" she whispers to him.\n\nJohannes tells her the amusing tale of how, years ago, he discovered\nthe corner where the old fellow was in the habit of stowing away the\nflour he pilfered. \"Perhaps we could do the same thing again?\" he\nlaughs.\n\n\"Well, we must hunt,\" says Trude. No sooner said than done. The\nfollowing Sunday when the mill stands still and no servants or\napprentices are about, Johannes takes the bunch of keys and beckons to\nTrude to follow him.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" asks Martin, looking up from the book he is\nreading.\n\n\"One of the hens lays its eggs astray,\" said Trude quickly. \"We want to\nhunt for them.\" And she does not even blush. They ransack the stables\nand barns, the storehouses and haystacks and especially the mill,--they\ntear upstairs and downstairs, clamber up steep ladders and rummage in\nthe rubbish of the lumber attics.\n\nAbout two hours have gone by in fruitless search, when Trude, who\nhas never lost courage, announces that in the furthest corner of the\nstore-house she has found what she was seeking. Beneath some rotten\nshafts and worn-out cog-wheels, covered by the d\u00c3\u00a9bris of the last ten\nyears, stand a few large bushel-sacks, filled with flour and barley;\nbesides which there are all sorts of useful trifles, such as hammers,\npincers, brushes and table-knives. Loudly rejoicing, her eyes\nglistening, her face all dirty, her hair full of cobwebs, she emerges\nfrom the cavity, and after Johannes has convinced himself that she has\nseen aright, they hold council of war. Shall Martin be drawn into the\nsecret? No, he would be vexed and perhaps spoil their fun. Johannes\nhits upon the right thing to do. He pours the contents of the sacks\ninto their proper receptacles and then fills them with sand and gravel,\nbut on the top puts a layer of lamp-black, such as the coachman uses\nfor blacking his leather trappings. After having, on the way, quickly\narranged everything as before, he considers his work completed. Both\ndepart from the mill filled with intense delight, wash their hands\nand faces at the pump, help each other to get their clothes clean and\ndo their best to keep a straight face on entering the room. But Martin\nat once notices the treacherous twitching of their mouths; he\nthreatens them smilingly with his finger, though he asks no further\nquestions....\n\nTwo--three days go by during which they are consumed with\nimpatience;--then one morning when Trude is in the garden Johannes\ncomes rushing down, breathless and red in the face with suppressed\nlaughter. She forthwith throws down her hoe and follows him then and\nthere to the yard. In front of the pump stands old David, helpless and\nenraged, half white and half as black as a sweep. His face and hands\nare coal black and his clothes are full of huge tar stains. From all\nthe windows of the mill the laughing faces of the mill-hands peep out;\nand Martin walks excitedly to and fro in front of the house.\n\nThe scene is surpassingly comic. Johannes and Trude feel fit to die of\nlaughing. David, who very rightly suspects where he must look for his\nfoes, casts a vicious look at the two and makes a fresh attempt to\nclean himself. But the tell-tale black sticks to everything as if grown\nfast upon it. At last Martin takes pity on the poor devil, lets him\ncome inside the common-room and orders Trude, who is laughing very\ntears, to find him an old suit of clothes.\n\nAt dinner-time the two tell him about their successful prank. He shakes\nhis head disapprovingly and thinks it would have been better to have\ntold him of their find. Then he mutters something about \"28 years of\nservice\" and \"babyish tricks,\" and gets up from the table.\n\nTrude and Johannes exchange meaning looks which say \"spoil-sport!\" The\naffair affords them ground for amusement for three whole days.\n\nOn the following Sunday Martin makes an excursion across country to get\nsome old debts cashed. He will not be likely to return before evening.\nThe mill-hands have gone to the inn. The mill stands empty.\n\n\"Now I shall send the maids off too,\" says Trude to Johannes; \"then we\nshall be absolutely alone in the place and can undertake something.\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" she laughs and goes out into the kitchen.\n\nAfter half an hour she returns and says: \"There, now they have gone,\nnow we can begin.\" Then they sit down opposite each other and\ndeliberate.\n\n\"We shall never again manage to have such a lark as last Sunday,\" sighs\nTrude, and then after a while: \"I say, Johannes!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You really are a great boon to me!\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Since you came I have been three times as happy. You see--he is ever\nso kind and you know--I am fond of him, very fond, but--he is always so\nserious, so condescending, as if I were a silly, senseless child--and\ndon't you think I am hardworking and take care of his household as well\nas any one older? Surely it's not my fault that I was born so full of\nfun and it isn't, after all, a crime to be like that--but under his\neyes, when he looks at one so solemnly and reproachfully, why it spoils\nall one's pleasure in any nonsense.... And when one has to sit there\nquite still, it's sometimes so awfully full and so ...\"\n\nShe stops and considers. She would like to pour out her grievances to\nhim, but hardly knows what they are?\n\n\"With you it is quite different,\" she continues, \"you are a dear, good\nfellow, and never say 'no' to anything. With you one can do as one\nlikes!--And besides, you haven't got his irritating smile which he puts\non when I tell him anything, as much as to say: 'I don't mind listening\nto you, but of course you are only talking rubbish.' Then the words\nseem to stick in my throat--whereas with you ... well, one can tell you\nanything that comes into one's head.\"\n\nShe pensively rests her head on her two hands and moves her elbows\nabout on her knees.\n\n\"Well, and what is coming into your head now?\" he asks.\n\nShe blushes and jumps up. \"Catch me,\" she cries and barricades herself\nbehind the table; but when he attempts to pursue her she walks calmly\ntowards him and says; \"leave that! We were going to undertake\nsomething, you know.--Keep the keys handy; in any case--perhaps we\nshall think of something on the way.\"\n\nHe takes the great bunch of keys from its peg and follows her out into\nthe yard, on which the hot midday sun is glaring.\n\n\"Unlock the mill,\" she says, \"it is cool in there.\" He does as he\nis bid, and with one wild leap she jumps down the steps into the\nhalf-dark space which lies before them in Sabbath quiet.\n\n\"I should be frightened to be here alone,\" she says, looking round at\nhim, then she points to the door of the office, the light wood of which\ngleams through the semi-obscurity, spreads open her fingers and\nshudders.\n\n\"Has he never yet told you anything?\" she whispers after a little\nwhile, bending towards his ear.\n\nHe shakes his head. He grows somewhat oppressed in this close,\ndimly-lighted place--he breathes heavily--he longs for light and fresh\nair.--But Trude feels all the more comfortable in this vapor-laden\natmosphere, in this mysterious twilight, where through the closed\nshutters stray slanting sunbeams glide like golden streamers onto the\nfloor, and form a play-ground for myriads of little dancing particles\nof dust. The tremor which fills her is just to her liking;--she\ncrouches down, then stealthily creeps up the stairs as if on the\nlookout for ghosts. When she reaches the gallery she gives a loud\nscream, and when Johannes anxiously asks what ails her, she says she\nonly felt she must give vent to her feelings.\n\nShe climbs up to a mill-hopper, clambers over the balustrade and slides\ndown again on the banisters. Then she disappears in the darkness among\nthe machinery, where the huge wheels tower above each other in gigantic\nmasses. Johannes lets her do just as she likes; to-day there is no\ndanger, to-day everything is at a standstill.\n\nA few seconds later she re-appears. She nestles up to Johannes' side,\nlooks about with startled eyes, then pulls from her pocket a small key,\nhanging on a black ribbon. \"What is this?\" she asks softly.\n\nJohannes throws a rapid glance towards the office door and looks at her\nenquiringly. She nods.\n\n\"Put it back,\" he cries, alarmed.\n\nShe balances the key in her hand and gazes longingly at the shining\nmetal. \"I once saw by chance where he hid it,\" she whispers.\n\n\"Put it back,\" he says once more.\n\nShe knits her brows, then she suggests with a short laugh: \"That would\nbe something for us to undertake.\" With that she casts a timorous\nside-glance at his face to try and explore his mood.\n\nHis heart beats audibly. In his soul there dawns the presentiment of\napproaching guilt.\n\n\"It would remain between us two, you know, Hans,\" she says coaxingly.\nHe closes his eyes. How delightful it would be to have a secret with\nher! \"And after all, what is there in it?\" she continues. \"Why should\nhe be so mysterious about it, especially to us two, who are his next of\nkin in the world?\"\n\n\"That's just why we ought not to deceive him!\" he replies.\n\nShe stamps her foot on the ground.\n\n\"Deceive indeed! It's a shame to use such a nasty expression!\" Then she\nsays, pouting: \"Well, then don't!\" and prepares to return the key to\nits hiding-place. But she turns it about in her fingers three or four\ntimes, and finally remarks, laughing, \"Perhaps it isn't the right one\nafter all.\"\n\nShe goes up to the door and with a shake of her head compares the\nkeyhole and the shape of the key--but,--then, with a sudden jerk, she\npushes the key into the lock.\n\n\"It fits, after all,\" she says, and looks with apparent disappointment\nback over her shoulder at Johannes, who is standing behind her,\nanxiously watching the movements of her hands.\n\n\"Turn it!\" she says in jest, and steps back from the door.\n\nA tremor passes through his body. Ah, Eve, thou temptress!\n\n\"Turn it and let me put my head in,\" she laughs, \"you needn't look at\nanything yourself.\"\n\nThen a sudden rage takes hold of him; he lets the key fly back\nwith a jerk and pushes the door wide open, so that a bright stream of\nlight from the window floods towards them. Trude makes a disappointed\nface. All they see is a plain, business-like room with bare,\nwhitewashed wooden walls. In the middle stands a large, roughly painted\nwriting-table on which lie samples of grain and ledgers. On one wall\nhangs a bundle of old clothes, and on the opposite one a wooden shelf\nwith some blue exercise-books and a few plainly bound volumes upon it.\nJohannes casts a few timid glances around, then steps up to the\nbook-shelf and begins turning over the title-pages. What an uncanny\ncollection! There are medical works on brain diseases, fractures of the\nskull and the like, philosophical treatises on the heredity of passion,\na \"History of Passion and its Terrible Consequences.\" \"Method for\nSelf-Restraint,\" and Kant's \"Art of Overcoming Morbid Feeling by Pure\nForce of Will.\" There are literary works, too, but they nearly all\ntreat of fratricide as their subject. Side by side with such thrilling\nromances as \"The Tragic Fate of a Whole Family at Elsterwerda,\" are\nSchiller's \"Bride of Messina,\" and Leisowitz's \"Julius of Tarent.\" Even\ntheology is represented by a number of little tracts on the deadly sins\nand their remission. Besides these, the blue exercise-books contain\ncarefully made extracts and dissertations and morbid reflections upon\nthings experienced and mused over.\n\nJohannes lets his hands drop. \"My poor, poor brother!\" he murmurs with\na deep sigh. Then he feels Trude's hand on his shoulder. She points to\na tablet hanging above the door, and asks in an anxious whisper: \"What\ndoes that signify?\"\n\nIn large gold letters these words are there inscribed:\n\n                            Think of Fritz!\n\nJohannes does not answer. He throws himself into a chair, buries his\nface in his hands and weeps bitterly.\n\nTrude trembles in every limb. She calls him by name, puts her arm round\nhis neck, tries to remove his hands from his face, and, when all this\navails nothing, she bursts into tears herself. When he hears her\nsobbing, he raises his head and looks about in a dazed sort of way. His\ngaze rests on the clothes hanging upon the wall, boy's clothes of many\nyears ago. He knows them well. His mother used to keep them as relics\nat the bottom of her linen-press, and once showed them to him with the\nwords: \"These were worn by your little dead brother.\" Since her death\nthe clothes had disappeared. Nor had he ever thought of them again. A\nshudder runs through his frame.\n\n\"Come,\" he says to Trade, who is still crying to herself, and they both\nleave the office. Trade wants to get out of the mill forthwith.\n\n\"First take the key back,\" he says.\n\nTogether they descend the stairs leading down to the machinery, and,\nwhen the key hangs in its old place, they both rush out into the open\nair as if pursued by furies.\n\n\nWith this hour their intercourse has lost its old harmlessness. They\nhave become participants in guilt. The feeling of guilt rests with\nterrible weight on their youthful souls. They pity each other, for each\nreads the story of his own conscience in the other's silent depression,\nsuppressed sighs and ill-concealed absent-mindedness--but neither can\nhelp the other.\n\nHow gladly they would confess their fault to Martin.--But it would not\ndo to go to him together and say, \"Forgive us--we have sinned\"--it\nwould really look too theatrical--and if one of them takes the\nconfession upon himself, he gains no mean advantage over the other.\nThey are both equally closely connected with Martin and whoever is the\nfirst to break silence must perforce appear to him as the more upright\nand less guilty one. Besides, they have vowed absolute secrecy to each\nother and feel all the less inclined to break their word, as they are\nafraid to converse openly on the subject.\n\nThus more and more a sort of clandestine understanding is nurtured\nbetween them; every harmless word spoken at table has for them a\nspecial, deep significance; every look they exchange becomes an emblem\nof secret agreement.\n\nMartin notices nothing of all this; only now and again it strikes him\nthat \"his two children\" have lost a good deal of their old cheerfulness\nand that they no longer sing so merrily. He makes no remark, however,\nfor he thinks they may have quarreled and are still sulking with one\nanother.\n\n\nThe following week, when Martin has once again shut himself up in his\noffice, Trude takes heart and says: \"I say, Hans, it is nonsense for us\nto fret ourselves. We will let the stupid affair rest.\"\n\nHe makes a melancholy face and says: \"If only it were possible!\"\n\nShe bursts out laughing and he laughs with her; it is \"possible,\" of\ncourse, but the love of concealment to which they have pandered will\nnot be shaken off. Every foolish joke gains piquancy by the fact that\nMartin \"on no account\" must get to know about it, and when they are\nwhispering with their heads together, they start asunder at the least\nnoise as if they were planning conspiracy.\n\nAs yet no word has been spoken, no look exchanged, hardly a thought\nawakened which need shun the light, but the bloom of innocence has been\nswept off their souls. In this wise the feast of St. John has come\nround.\n\nThe wind blows sultry. The earth lies as if intoxicated--buried beneath\nblossoms, reveling in a superabundance of fragrance. The jasmine and\nguelder-rose bushes appear as though covered with white foam; the\nspring roses open their chalices, and the limes are putting forth their\nbuds already.\n\nTrude sits on the veranda, has let her work drop into her lap and is\na-dreaming. The fragrance of the flowers and the sun's hot glow have\nconfused her senses, but she heeds not that. The flowers' fragrance and\nthe sun's hot breath, she would love to drain all the flower-cups--if\nonly they contained something to drink.\n\nIn the mill they have ceased working earlier than usual, for the\napprentices want to go to the village to the midsummer night's f\u00c3\u00aate.\nThere is to be dancing and firing of tar-barrels and everyone will\nenjoy himself to the best of his ability.\n\nTrude sighs. Ah, for a chance of going there too! Martin may stay at\nhome, but Johannes, Johannes of course would have to accompany her\nthere. There he stands at the entrance and nods across at her. Then he\nthrows himself down on the bench opposite--he is tired and hot. He has\nbeen working hard.\n\nA few minutes later he jumps up again. \"I can't stay here,\" he says.\n\"It is suffocatingly hot.\"\n\n\"Where else do you want to go?\"\n\n\"Down to the weir. Will you come too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd she throws down her work and takes his arm.\n\n\"They are going to dance down in the village to-day,\" says she.\n\n\"I suppose that's where you would like to go too, you puss?\"\n\nShe wrings her hands and groans, so as to give the most drastic\nexpression to her longing.\n\n\"But I cannot have my way; For at home I've got to stay,\" he hums.\n\n\"It's a regular shame,\" she grumbles, \"that I have never yet in my\nlife danced with you.--And I should like to immensely, for you dance\nwell--very well!\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"What a question!\" she says with feigned indignation. \"Think of that\nrifle f\u00c3\u00aate three years ago. All the girls told wonders of how well you\nheld them during the dance--not too loose and not too tight;--and that\nyou were tall and good-looking I could see for myself--but what good\nwas all that to me? You overlooked me as utterly as if I were nothing\nbut empty air.\"\n\n\"How old were you at that time?\"\n\nShe hesitates a little, then says dejectedly: \"Fourteen and a half.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the explanation,\" he laughs. \"But I was then already tall\nand--and--full grown,\" she answers eagerly. \"It wouldn't have hurt you\nto have whirled me round the room a few times.\"\n\n\"Well, we can make up for it in a fortnight at the rifle f\u00c3\u00aate.\"\n\n\"Yes, can we?\" she asks with beaming eyes.\n\n\"Martin is one of the patrons of the shooters' company. That is in\nitself a reason for his being present.\"\n\nTrude gives vent loudly to her delight; then in sudden perplexity she\nsays: \"But I have no dancing shoes.\"\n\n\"Have some made for yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, our village cobbler is such a clumsy worker.\"\n\n\"Then I will order you a pair from town. You need only give me your\nmeasure.\"\n\n\"Will you really? Oh, you dear, darling Hans!\" And then she suddenly\nwithdraws her arm, runs forward a few steps, calls out \"catch me,\" and\nwhisks away. Johannes starts in pursuit,--but he is tired--he cannot\novertake her. Across the drawbridge of the weir the chase proceeds\nacross on to the vast grass plain, stretching as far as the distant\npine wood. Trude dodges him cleverly,--runs past him--and before he can\nfollow, she is once more on this side of the river. Breathlessly she\nmakes a dash for the chain by which the drawbridge is regulated; from\non shore--she tears at it with all her might; the wood-work moves\ncreaking on its hinges--and jerks upwards--at the very moment when\nJohannes springs on to the foot-plank. He staggers, he cries out,--and\nclutching hold of the main beam, he manages by sheer force to stem its\nmovement just as the gap is opening. Trude has turned as white as a\nsheet, she stares speechlessly at him, as, gasping for breath, he gazes\ndown into the dark abyss.\n\n\"I didn't--think of that, Hans,\" she stammers with a look which very\neloquently pleads forgiveness.\n\nHe laughs out loud. A wild, devil-may-care feeling of happiness has\ncome over him.\n\n\"Oh you--you!\" he cries, opening out his arms. \"I shall have you yet.\"\nAnd with a fool-hardy leap he jumps on to the narrow main-beam, which,\nwith its two slanting, roof-shaped sides, spans the river.\n\n\"Hans--for God's sake--Hans!\"\n\nHe does not hear--beneath him is the foaming abyss--he has hard work to\nkeep his balance--he moves forward--he trembles he sways--three\nmore--two more steps only one more daring leap--he is over.\n\n\"Now run!\" he cries, with a wild shout of glee.\n\nBut Trude does not stir. She stares in his direction, paralyzed with\nterror. Like a tiger he springs towards her--he encircles her with\nhis arms--he presses her to him--she closes her eyes and breathes\nheavily--then he bends down and lays his hot and thirsting lips upon\nhers. She gives a loud moan--her body trembles feverishly in his\nembrace. Then he lets her glide down--his affrighted gaze travels\naround--has no one seen it? \"No, no one!\" And what if they have? May\nMartin's brother not kiss Martin's wife? Did not he himself once\nrequire it of him?\n\nShe opens her eyes as though awakening from a deep dream. Her eyes\navoid his.\n\n\"That was not nice of you, Hans,\" she says softly, \"you must never do\nthat to me again!\"\n\nHe does not answer and stoops to pick up the rose which has fallen from\nher bosom.\n\n\"Let me go home,\" she says, casting a frightened look around.\n\nThey walk along side by side for a while in silence; she gazes into\nspace; he smells the rose he has found.\n\n\"Do you like roses?\" he continues. She looks at him. \"As if you did not\nknow that,\" her look says.\n\n\"By the bye,\" he goes on gaily, \"why do you no longer put flowers at my\nbed-side now?\"\n\n\"He has forbidden me,\" she stammers.\n\n\"That alters the case,\" he replies, crestfallen. Then their\nconversation comes to a standstill altogether.\n\nOn the veranda Martin receives them with a good-natured scolding. He\ndeclares he is ravenously hungry, and supper is not yet served.\n\nTrude hurries to the kitchen to give a helping hand herself.... The\nmeal is consumed in silence. The two do not raise their eyes from their\nplates. An atmosphere of unbearable sultriness oppresses the earth. The\nhot wind whirls up small dust clouds and bluish grey veils of mist\nsettle down slowly.\n\nJohannes leans his head against the glass of the veranda window, but\nthat is as hot as if it had been all day in a fiery furnace. Then Trude\nsuddenly jumps up.\n\n\"Where are you going to?\" asks Martin.\n\n\"Into the garden,\" she replies.\n\nAfter a while they hear her mounting the stairs that lead to the turret\nroom. When she comes out again she gives Johannes a quick, timid look,\nthen takes her seat with downcast eyes.\n\nFrom the village green come sounds of merry-making and screams of\nenjoyment, mingled with the squeak of the fiddle and the drone of the\ndouble-bass.\n\n\"I suppose you'd like to go there, children?\" They are both silent and\nhe takes their silence for consent. \"Well, then come along,\" he says,\ngetting up. Trude stretches out her arms in silent anguish, looks\nacross wistfully at Johannes, then with a shake of her head she says,\n\"Don't care about it!\"\n\n\"Why, what's up?\" cried Martin, quite taken aback. \"Since when do you\nget out of the way of dance music? I suppose you two have been\nsquabbling again, eh?\"\n\nJohannes laughs curtly and Trude turns away. Suddenly she gets up, says\nlaconically, \"Good-night,\" and disappears.\n\nA little later the brothers, too, part company.\n\nWith heavy limbs Johannes mounts the stairs--he opens the door of his\nroom--an intoxicating fragrance of flowers wells towards him. He draws\na deep breath and utters a sigh of satisfaction. Then this was the\nreason for going at such a late hour into the garden! By the side of\nhis pillow stands a huge bunch of rose and jasmine. He drops into bed\nas if he would like to bury himself beneath this mass of blossoms. For\na while he lies a-dreaming quietly to himself, but his breathing\nbecomes more and more labored, his senses grow dim,--at every pulsation\na poignant pain darts through his temples,--he feels as though he must\nsuccumb beneath this overpowering fragrance.\n\nExerting all his force of will, he pulls himself up and pushes open a\nwindow. But even this brings no calm, no relief. A very chaos of\nfragrance wafts up to him from the garden--the wind breathes hotly upon\nhim, lukewarm, tingling drops of rain beat upon his face. Down in the\nvillage the fires from the tar-barrels shoot fitfully through the\nnebulous clouds of mist veiling the distance.\n\nJohannes looks down. He is waiting. His heart is beating audibly. His\nlonging appears to him almighty--he will force that window below to\nopen and ... hark! Softly the latch is pushed back, one sash is thrown\nopen, and there, leaning far out, framed by waving unbound tresses,\nTrude's face appears, straining upwards to him with mute yearning.\n\nOne moment--then it has vanished. He knows not--shall he exult, or\nshall he weep?--Now he may sink into sweet unconsciousness--What can\nthe fragrance harm him now?\n\nHe undresses and goes to bed; but before he drops to sleep he once more\nraises himself up, gropes with a trembling hand for the vase, and\nburies his face in the flowers.\n\nHow like it all is to that first evening, and yet how different! Then\nhe was peaceful and happy; now ...\n\nA suddenly awakened memory makes him start; his fingers clutch the\nhandle of the vase more tightly--he listens and listens--he feels as if\nthat merry laugh which then so softly sounded through the floor, must\nat this moment again greet his ears--he listens with increasing fear\ntill his whole brain is humming and buzzing--an ugly feeling of hatred\nand jealousy suddenly uprises within him; and, bursting into a wild\nlaugh, he hurls the vase far away into the middle of the room, where it\nshatters with a crash.\n\nNext morning Johannes is ashamed of himself. It all seems as if it had\nbeen a bad dream. He collects the fragments of the vase, fits them\ntogether and resolves to get some cement from the chemist and mend it.\nMuch as he considers the matter, he cannot explain the feeling which\nprompted him to this act of apparent school-boy folly; he only knows\nthat it was something wicked and loathsome.\n\nHe presses his brother's hand more heartily than at other times and\ngazes silently into his eyes as if to plead forgiveness for some grave\ncrime.\n\nTrude looks pale and as if she had not slept. Her eyes avoid his, and\nthe cup of coffee which she hands him rattles in her trembling hand.\n\nAs he can find no better subject, he begins to talk about the dancing\nshoes, wishing at the same time to sound Martin. He is quite agreeable.\nTrude is to have her measure taken at once and when she objects to\ntaking off her shoes in Johannes' presence, he angrily calls her an\n\"affected little prude,\" She is offended, begins to cry and leaves the\nroom. Then towards evening she bashfully appears with her measure and\nJohannes sends off his letter. The broken vase still weighs heavily on\nhis conscience. When he is alone with her he confesses.\n\n\"I say, I've done a clumsy thing.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I have smashed a vase.\"\n\n\"Indeed! was that simply clumsiness?\"\n\n\"What else should it be?\"\n\n\"I thought you had done it on purpose,\" she says, with apparent utter\nindifference. He gives no answer, and she quietly nods a few times to\nherself as much as to say, \"It seems I was right after all!\"\n\n\nThe days pass by. Relations between Johannes and Trude are cooler than\nthey were. They do not avoid each other, they even talk together, but\ntheir former happy-go-lucky mode of intercourse is irretrievably lost.\n\n\"She is offended because I kissed her,\" thinks Johannes, but it does\nnot strike him that he too has changed his behavior towards her.\n\n\"Children, what's up with you?\" says Martin one evening grumblingly.\n\"Have your throats grown rusty, as you never sing now?\"\n\nFor a few seconds both are silent, then Trude says, half turning\ntowards Johannes, \"Will you?\" He nods; but as she has not been looking\nat him she thinks she has had no answer and says, turning towards\nMartin, \"You see, he doesn't want to!\"\n\n\"Don't I though!\" laughs Johannes.\n\n\"Then why can't you say so at once?\" she answers with a timid attempt\nat responding to his cheerful tone.\n\nThen she puts herself in position, folds her hands in her lap as she is\nwont to do when singing, and fixes her eyes on the pigeon-house yonder.\n\n\"What shall we sing?\" she asks.\n\n\"Must we part, beloved maid?\"--he suggests.\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Nothing about love,\" she says rather pointedly,\n\"that's all so stupid.\"\n\nHe looks at her astonished and after some deliberation she starts a\nhunting song. He joins in lustily and their voices blend and unite like\ntwo waves in the ocean. They themselves marvel at such harmony; they\nhave never sung so well. But they soon come to an end. The Germans have\nnot many folk-songs which are not at the same time love ditties. And\nfinally she has to submit.\n\n\n            \"Rose-bush and elder-tree,\n            When my love comes to me!\"\n\n\nshe begins, tacking on a \"Jodler.\" He smiles and looks at her, she\nblushes and turns away.--She has let herself be caught now.\n\nThe two voices grow full of wonderful animation, as though their\nhearts' pulsation were throbbing through the notes. They swell\nheavenwards as though impelled by waves of passion, they die down as\nthough the bourne of life were stagnant through intensity of hidden\nwoe.\n\n            \"No words can e'er express my love,\n            In silent longing I adore.\n            Question my eyes, for they will speak;\n            I love thee now and evermore!\"\n\n\nWhy do their eyes suddenly meet? What occasion is there for them both\nto tremble as though an electric current were passing through their\nbodies?...\n\n\n            \"There is never an hour in my sleeping\n            When my thoughts are not waking.\n            Their flight to thee taking,\n            To thank thee for placing forever\n            Thy heart in my keeping!\"\n\n\nWhat intoxicating passion vibrates through the notes!\n\nHow the two voices seek each other as if to embrace!\n\n\n            \"O'er the mill-stream bends the willow,\n            In the valley lies the snow,\n            Sweetest love, 'tis time we parted,\n            I must leave thee, broken-hearted.\n            Parting, love, is full of woe!\"\n\n\nThe voices die away in tremulous whispers. It is over--longing and\nhope, the pain of parting and the agony of death, all resounded in\nthese treacherous, swelling chords.\n\nTrude's lips twitch as with suppressed weeping, but her eyes glitter,\nand suddenly, standing bolt upright, she begins the old, sad\nmiller-song about the golden house that stands \"over on yonder hill.\"\n\nJohannes starts, and his voice falls in tremulously. They sing through\nthe first verse and begin the second:\n\n\n            \"Down there in yonder valley,\n            The mill-wheel grinds away,\n            'Tis love that it is grinding\n            By night and all the day.\n            The mill-wheel now is broken--\"\n\n\nSuddenly--a scream--a fall--Trude has dropped down in front of the\nbench and is sobbing convulsively in the corner with her head pressed\nagainst the wood-work.\n\nBoth brothers jump up--Martin takes her head between both his hands,\nand, quite upset, he stammers disconnected, confused words--but she\nonly sobs more violently. He stamps his foot on the ground in despair\nand, turning towards Johannes, who is deathly pale, he cries; \"What\nails the child?\"\n\nThen Trude flings both her arms around his neck, raises herself up by\nhim and hides her tear-stained face upon his breast, as if seeking\nrefuge. He strokes her dishevelled hair caressingly and tries to calm\nher; but he does not understand the art of comforting, poor Martin;\neach one of his half-mumbled words sounds like suppressed scoldings.\nShe lets her head sink back towards the wall of foliage, her lips move,\nand, as if she were continuing the song, she murmurs, still half choked\nwith sobs:\n\n\n            \"The mill-wheel--now--is broken!\"\n\n\n\"No, my child, it is not broken,\" his eyes filling with tears, \"it\nwill not be broken--not _ours_--it will go on turning--as long as we\nlive.\"--\n\nShe shakes her head passionately and closes her eyes, as though\nbeholding visions.\n\n\"And what makes such things enter your head?\" he continues. \"Has not\neverything turned out better than we thought? Isn't Johannes with us\ntoo?--Don't we live together in happiness and content?--and work from\nmorn till night?--and--and--aren't your people comfortable too? And\ndon't we take care that your father has a good income--and\"--\n\nHe groans and wipes the perspiration from his brow. He can think of\nnothing more--and now appeals to Johannes, who is standing with his\nface turned away and his head resting against the pillar at the\nentrance of the veranda.\n\n\"Why will you always sing such sad songs?\" he growls at him. \"I myself\ngot to feel quite--I don't know what--when you began with them--and\nshe--she is only a weak woman.\"\n\nTrude shakes her head as if to say, \"Don't scold!\" Then she raises\nherself, murmurs, without looking up, a soft \"Good-night,\" and goes\ninto the house.\n\nMartin follows her.\n\nJohannes buries his head in his arms and dreams to himself. He sees\nher again as she raises herself to her full height with her eyes all\na-gleam,--then suddenly sank down as if struck by lightning. Then he\nreproaches himself that he did not hasten to her side sooner, to\nprevent her from falling, for he was nearest to her, and not only as\nregards space!\n\nNot only as regards space! As by a lurid flame--horrible,\nbloody-red--his brain is suddenly illumined! Now he understands what\nfeelings inspired him on that midsummer night--why he flung the vase to\nthe ground--he makes a movement as if he would shatter it a second\ntime!--It is only for one moment--a moment of hellish torture--then the\nflame is suddenly extinguished, there is darkness once more--intense,\npain-penetrated darkness!--He passes his hand over his brow, as if to\nfire the flame anew, but all remains dark,--and dark and mysterious\nremains to him what he has just experienced. He feels as though he must\ncry out, as if he must confide to the night this unintelligible agony\nin which he is wrestling. He drops on to his knees, on the very same\nspot where Trude sank down, rests his head on the edge of the bench and\nmoans softly to himself.\n\nSuddenly a door in the house slams. His brother's steps resound in the\nentrance.\n\nHe jumps up and sits down on the bench. Martin's figure, darkly\noutlined, appears on the veranda.\n\n\"Brother, brother!\" Johannes calls out to him.\n\n\"Are you there, my boy?\" the latter answers and throws himself with a\ndeep sigh on to the bench. \"Well, things are nearly all right again\nnow--she has cried herself to sleep and now she is lying there quite\ncalmly and her breath too comes quietly and regularly. I stood for a\nwhile at her bedside and looked at her. I am quite at a loss! Her\nchild-like mind used to lie before me as clear as a mirror--and now all\nat once--what can it be? However much I think about it, I don't seem to\nget on to the right track. Perhaps she troubles because as yet there is\nno prospect of--of--yes, probably that's it. But I have always kept my\nlonging quite to myself--didn't want to hurt her feelings--for of\ncourse, she can't alter the matter. And really, if one thinks about it,\nshe is but a child herself and much too young to fulfil maternal\nduties. Why, one must have patience!\" Thus he tries to talk away his\nsoul's secret sorrow. Johannes remains silent. His heart is so full, so\nfull. He wants to give his brother some proof of his affection and\nknows not how? He too has his own pain which he wants to work off, and,\ngrasping Martin's hand, he says from the depths of his soul: \"Oh,\neverything, everything will come right again!\"\n\n\"Of course, why shouldn't it?\" Martin stammers in consternation. He\nshakes his head, looks down thoughtfully for a while, then says, with\nan uneasy laugh: \"Go to bed, Johannes.--That broken mill-wheel is\nhaunting your imagination.\"\n\nNext day Trude is lying ill in bed. She will see no one--even Martin as\nlittle as possible. Johannes slinks about unable to settle down to\nanything. Their meals are taken in monotonous silence. The shadows\nclose down more and more round the Rockhammer mill.\n\nBut the sun breaks forth once more. On the fourth day Trude is half-way\nconvalescent again, and Johannes may go into her room for a talk with\nher.\n\nHe finds her sitting at the window, with a white dress lying across her\nlap. She is pale and weak yet, but her features are glorified by an\nexpression of peaceful melancholy such as convalescents are apt to\nwear.\n\nSmiling, she puts out her hand to Johannes.\n\n\"How are you now?\" he asks softly.\n\n\"Well--as you see,\" she replies, pointing to the white dress; \"my\nthoughts are already occupied with the ball.\"\n\n\"What ball?\" he asks, astonished.\n\n\"What a bad memory you have!\" she says with an attempt at a joke. \"Why,\nnext Sunday is the rifle-f\u00c3\u00aate.\"\n\n\"Yes, so it is.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're not even looking forward to dancing with me?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am!\"\n\n\"Very much?--Tell me! Very much?\"\n\n\"Very much!\"\n\nA child-like smile of pleasure flits across her pale, delicate face;\nshe fingers the laces and frills, with undisguised delight at the\nwhite, airy texture.\n\nThis physical exhaustion seems to have restored to her mind its former,\nchild-like harmlessness, and with a certain degree of anxiety she\nbegins to enquire about her dancing shoes. She is once more, to all\nappearance, just the same girlishly thoughtless creature who once put\nout her hand with such unconstrained simple-heartedness to bid Johannes\nwelcome.\n\nHe sits down opposite to her, lets the texture of the ball-dress glide\nthrough his fingers, and listens to her prattling with a quiet smile.\n\nAnd everything she tells him is replete with sunshine and the very joy\nof existence. This had been her wedding dress which she had made and\ntrimmed herself, for she could do that as well as anybody. She would\nhave liked to wear silk, as befitted the bride of the rich miller\nRockhammer, but she could not scrape together sufficient money, and as\nfor letting her intended give her her wedding dress--well, her pride\nwould not permit that. To-day she felt almost sorry to undo the seams,\nfor how many foolish hopes and dreams were not sewn into them?--But\nwhat else could she do?--she had got so much stouter since she was a\nmarried woman.\n\nThen the conversation flies off at a tangent to the approaching\nrifle-f\u00c3\u00aate, touches on her new acquaintances in the village and\noccasionally wanders off to the shoemaker's place in the town; but ever\nand again she comes back to the time of her engagement and tarries over\nthe moods and events of those blissful days.\n\nShe seems to feel just like a young girl again. The smile that plays so\ndreamily and full of presage about her lips, is like the smile of a\nbride--as if the fete to which she is looking forward were her wedding.\n\nAll her thoughts henceforth tend towards the ball. While she is\nentirely recovering, while her eyes grow clear, and the color returns\nto her cheeks, she is meditating by day and by night how she shall\nadorn herself; she is dreaming of the bliss which in those looked-for\nhours is to dawn upon her, as though it were something totally new and\nbeyond all comprehension.\n\nTrumpets sound; clarionets shriek; the big drum joins in with its dull,\ndroning thud.\n\nMidst clinking and clanking, midst skipping and tripping, the guild\nmarch along the street in solemn procession. On in front ride two\nheralds on horseback--Franz Maas and Johannes Rockhammer, the two\nUhlans of the Guard. Nothing would induce them to give up their\nprivilege--even did it mean rack and ruin to the guild.\n\nFranz's countenance is beaming, but Johannes looks serious--indifferent\nalmost; what does he care about all these people from whom he has\nbecome estranged? He salutes no one, his gaze rests on none; but he is\nsearching, he is mustering the lines of people,--and now, suddenly--his\nfeatures glow with pride and happiness-he bows, he lowers his sword in\nsalute:--over there at the street corner, with rosy-red cheeks, with\nbeaming eyes, waving her handkerchief, stands she whom he seeks--his\nbrother's wife.\n\nShe is laughing--she is beckoning--she pulls herself up by the railing,\nshe jumps on to the curb-stone--she wants to watch him till he\ndisappears in the whirling clouds of dust. With all this she nearly,\nvery nearly, forgets Martin, who is walking along close to the banner.\nBut then, why does he go marching on so quietly and stiffly, why does\nhe stick his head so far into his collar?--Over there in the distance\nJohannes is beckoning just once more with his sword.\n\nThe rifle-range, the goal of the procession, is situated close to the\nfir-copse--which, seen from the weir, frames the meadow landscape,--and\nhardly a thousand paces straight across from the Rockhammer mill, which\nseems to beckon from over the alder bushes by the river. If those\nstupid rifle people did not make such a deafening noise one might\neasily hear the rushing of the waters....\n\n\"If only this hocus-pocus were already over,\" observed Johannes,\nand casts a longing look towards the \"ball-room,\" a huge square\ntent-erection, whose canvas roof rises high above the mass of smaller\nstalls and tents grouped around. Not till afternoon, when the \"King\"\nhas been solemnly proclaimed, may the members' friends enter the\nfestival ground. The hours pass by; shots resound at intervals along\nthe boundary of the wood. At noon comes Johannes' turn. He shoots--at\nrandom--in spite of the flowers which Trude stuck into his gun.\n\"Flowers for luck,\" she had said, and Martin had stood by and smiled,\nas one smiles at childish play. ... As soon as his duties as a rifleman\nare fulfilled, he turns his back on the ranges and betakes himself into\nthe wood, where nothing is to be heard of all the shouting and\nchattering and there is no sound but the echo of the shooting softly\ndying away into the air.... He throws himself down upon the mossy\nground and stares up at the branches of the fir-trees, whose slender\nneedles glisten and gleam in the rays of the midday sun, like brightly\npolished little knives. Then he closes his eyes and dreams. How strange\nthe whole world has become to him! And how far removed everything seems\nwhich he ever lived through before! Not indeed that he has lived\nthrough much--women and care have played no great part in his life\nhitherto: and yet how rich, how full of glowing color it has always\nappeared to him! Now an abyss has swallowed up everything, and over the\nabyss rose-colored mists are undulating....\n\nTwo hours may have elapsed, when he hears distant trumpet blasts\nproclaim the election of a new king. He jumps up. Only half an hour\nmore; then Trude will be coming.\n\nAt the shooting-stand he learns that the dignity of \"king\" has been\nallotted to his friend Franz Maas. He hears it as if in a dream; what\ndoes it concern him? His gaze wanders incessantly towards the highroad,\nwhere, through the dust and the glaring sun, crowds of gaily dressed\nfemale figures are approaching on foot and in carriages.\n\n\"Are you looking out for Trude?\" asks Martin's voice suddenly, close\nbehind him.\n\nHe looks up startled from his brooding. \"Good gracious, boy, what's up\nwith you?\" asks Martin laughingly. \"Have you taken your bad shot so\nmuch to heart, or are you sleeping in broad daylight?\"\n\nMartin has one of his good days to-day. Meeting all these people--he is\none of the chief dignitaries of the guild--has roused him from his\nusual moodiness,--his eyes glisten and a jovial smile plays about his\nbroad mouth. If only he did not look so awkward in his Sunday clothes!\nHis hat sits right on his forehead, leaving full play to a bunch of\nbristly hair sticking up curiously over the brim, and below that there\nappear the white tapes of his shirt-front, which have worked out from\nunder his coat collar.\n\n\"There she comes, there she comes,\" he suddenly shouts, waving his hat.\n\nThe flashing carriage, drawn by a pair of splendid Lithuanian bays, is\nthe Rockhammer state coach, which Martin had had built for his wedding.\nSitting within it--that white figure reclining with such proud dignity\nin one corner, and looking about with such distant seriousness--that is\nshe, \"the rich mistress of Rockhammer,\" as the people all round are\nwhispering to each other.\n\n\"Look--Trude is giving herself airs,\" says Martin softly, pulling\nJohannes' sleeve.\n\nAt the same moment she discovers the brothers, and, throwing her\naffected bearing to the winds, she jumps up in the carriage, waves her\nsunshade in one hand, her kerchief in the other, and laughs and gives\nvent to her delight and prods the coachman with the point of her\nparasol to make him drive faster. Then, when the carriage stops, she\ngives herself no time to wait till the door is opened, but jumps onto\nthe splash-board and from there straight into Martin's arms. She is in\na state of feverish excitement; her breath comes hot; her lips move to\nspeak, but her voice fails her.\n\n\"Quietly, child, quietly,\" says Martin, and strokes her hair, which\nto-day falls upon her bare neck in a mass of little ringlets. Johannes\nstands motionless, lost in contemplation of her.\n\nHow lovely she is!\n\nThe white, gauzy dress floats round her exquisite figure like an airy\nveil! And that white neck!--and those little dimples at her bosom!--and\nthose glorious plump arms on which there trembles a light, silvery\nfluff!--and this plastic bust, which rises and falls like a marble\nwave!... She appears unapproachably beautiful, every inch a woman yet\nevery inch majesty, for in his innocent mind the ideas \"woman\" and\n\"majesty\" are synonymous, and mean for him an indefinable something\nwhich fills him with bliss and with fear. His eyes are suddenly opened\nand are dazzled as yet with gazing at this regal type of female\nloveliness, beside which he has hitherto walked as one blind. How\nlovely she is! How lovely is woman! And now a torrent of confused\nwords streams from her unfettered lips. She had nearly died of\nimpatience.--And that stupid big clock,--and her lonely dinner,--and\nthose silly dancing shoes which would not fit! They are too tight; they\npinch frightfully--\"but they look lovely, don't they?\"\n\nAnd she lifts up the hem of her skirt a little to show the works of\nart, light blue, high-heeled little shoes, tied across the instep with\nblue silk bows.\n\n\"They seem too short!\" Martin remarks, with a doubtful shake of his\nhead.\n\n\"That's just what they _are_,\" she laughs, \"my toes burn as if they were\non fire! But I shall dance all the better for it--what do _you_ say,\nJohannes?\" And she closes her eyes for a moment as though to recall\nvanished dreams. Then she hooks her arm in Martin's, and asks to be\ntaken to her tent. The most notable families of the district have\nprovided themselves with private dwellings--light huts or canvas tents\nwhich afford them night shelter, for the f\u00c3\u00aate commonly drags on till\nearly day. Trude had been herself the day before on the festival ground\nto superintend the erection of her tent; she had also had furniture\nbrought in and wreathed the entrance gaily with leafy garlands. She may\nwell be proud of her handiwork, for the Rockhammer tent is the finest\nof the whole collection.\n\nWhile Martin seeks to wedge his way through the crowd, she turns to\nJohannes and says quickly and softly:\n\n\"Are you satisfied, Hans? Am I to your liking?\"\n\nHe nods.\n\n\"Very much. Tell me--very much?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\nShe draws a deep breath, then laughs to herself in silent satisfaction.\n\nThe miller's lovely wife makes a sensation among the crowd. The strange\nfarmers and land-proprietors stand and stare at her--the burghers'\nwives secretly nudge each other with their elbows; the young fellows\nfrom the village awkwardly pull off their hats; a whispering and\nmurmuring passes through the throng wherever she appears. With serious\nmien and affecting a certain dignity, she walks along, leaning on\nMartin's arm, from time to time shaking back the curls which wave over\nher shoulders,--and when, in so doing, she throws back her head, she\nlooks like a queen, or rather like a spirited child which is playing\nthe part of a queen in a fairy tale, and hardly feels comfortable in\nthe r\u00c3\u00b4le.\n\nWhen an hour later the first notes of the fiddles are heard, she calls\nout with a cry of delight! \"Hans, now I belong to you.\"\n\nMartin warns her to beware of cold and other evils, but in the midst of\nhis speeches they are off and away. Then he resigns himself, pours\nhimself out a good glass of Hungarian wine, and stretches himself on\nthe sofa to take some rest.\n\nAll sorts of pleasant thoughts flit through his head. Hasn't everything\narranged itself happily and satisfactorily since Johannes came to live\nat the mill? Have not even his own bad hours of tragic presentiment and\nhaunting terror become less and less frequent? Is he not visibly\nreviving, infected by the harmless merriment of those two? Is\nnot this very day the best proof that his antipathy to strange\npeople has disappeared, that he has learnt to be merry when others are\nmerry-making?--And Trude--how happy she is at his side!--That evening\ncertainly!--Well, what of that! Women are frail creatures, subject to a\nthousand varying moods! And how quickly things have come right again!\nThe words which Johannes spoke to him that night, come back to him; he\nclinks his full glass against the two empty ones which the youngsters\nhave left behind them: \"Good luck to you both! May our happy triple\nalliance continue to our lives' end!\"--Meanwhile Trude and Johannes\nhave squeezed themselves through the closely packed crowd, as far as\nthe entrance to the dancing-room. Sounding waves of music swell towards\nthem; like a hot human breath the air from within is wafted in their\ndirection. In the semi-obscurity of the tent the couples are whirling\nalong in one dense crowd, and flit past them like shadowy forms.\n\nJohnannes walks as one a-dreaming. He hardly dares to let his gaze rest\nupon Trude; for even yet that mysterious awe has complete possession of\nhim and seems to bind him round with iron fetters.\n\n\"You are so quiet to-day, Hans,\" she whispers, nestling with her face\nagainst his sleeve. He is silent.\n\n\"Have I done anything to displease you!\"\n\n\"Nothing--no indeed!\" he stammers.\n\n\"Then come, let us dance!\"\n\nAt the moment when he lays his hand upon her she gives a start; then\nwith a deep sigh she lets herself sink into his arms. And now they are\nwhirling along. She leans her face with a deep-drawn breath upon his\nbreast. Just in front of her left eye there flutters the rosette which\nhe wears to-day as a member of the rifle-guild; the white silk ribbon\ntrembles close to her eyelashes. She moves her head a little to one\nside and looks up at him.\n\n\"Do you know how I feel?\" she murmurs.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"As if you were carrying me through the clouds.\"\n\nAnd then, when they have to stop, she says: \"Come out quickly, so that\nI need not dance with anyone else!\"\n\nShe clutches hold of his hand, while he makes a passage for her through\nthe crowd of people. Outside, she takes his arm, and walks at his side\nproudly and happily with glowing cheeks and dancing eyes. She laughs,\nshe chatters, she jests, and he keeps pace with her to the best of his\nability.--In the heat of the dance his bashfulness has entirely melted\naway. A wild gladness fires his veins. To-day she is his with every\nthought and feeling, his only, as he can feel by the trembling of her\narm, which rests upon his more firmly with secret, sweet pressure; he\ncan see it in the most gleaming glamour of her eyes as she raises them\nto his.\n\nAfter a time she asks, somewhat reluctantly: \"I say, mustn't we have a\nlook what Martin is doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" he replies eagerly. But nothing comes of this\ngood resolution. Every time they happen to pass the tent something\nremarkable is sure to be taking place in the opposite direction, which\ngives them an opportunity of forgetting their intention.\n\nThen all of a sudden, Martin himself comes towards them, beaming with\npleasure and surrounded by a number of village inhabitants whom he is\ntaking along with him to stand them treat. \"Hallo, children!\" he says,\n\"I am just going to remove my general headquarters to the 'Crown'\nInnkeeper's booth; if you want a drink, come along with me.\"\n\nTrude and Johannes exchange a rapid glance of understanding and\nsimultaneously beg to be excused.\n\n\"Good-bye then, children, and enjoy yourselves thoroughly!\" With that\nhe goes off.\n\n\"I have never seen him in such good spirits,\" remarks Trude, laughing.\n\"Indeed, no one could grudge them to him,\" says Johannes in a gentle\nvoice, looking affectionately after his brother. He wants to kill the\ngnawing which has awakened within him at sight of Martin.\n\n\nEvening has come on. The festive crowd is bathed in purple light. The\nwood and the meadow are ruddy red.\n\nIn a lonely nook at the meadow's edge, Trude stops and looks with\ndazzled gaze towards the faintly glowing sun.\n\n\"Ah, if only it would not set for us today!\" she cries, stretching\nforth her arms.\n\n\"Well, command it not to!\" says Johannes.\n\n\"Sun, I command thee to stay with us!\"\n\nAnd as the red ball sinks lower and lower, she suddenly shivers and\nsays: \"Do you know what idea just came into my head? That we should\nnever see it rise again!\" Then she laughs aloud. \"I know it is all\nnonsense! Come and dance.\"\n\nAnd they return to the dancing-tent. A new dance has just commenced.\nFired by longing, entranced by contemplation of each other, they whirl\nalong and disappear in a dark little corner near the musicians'\nplatform, which they have chosen in order to avoid the searching gaze\nof the other dancers, who are all dying to make the acquaintance of the\nmiller's lovely wife.\n\nTrude's hair has loosed itself and is fluttering about unbound; in her\neyes is a faint glow, as of intoxication: her whole being seems\npervaded by the ecstasy of the moment.\n\n\"If only my foot did not burn like very hell-fire,\" she says once as\nJohannes takes her back to her place.\n\n\"Then rest awhile.\"\n\nShe laughs aloud, and when at the same moment Franz Maas comes to claim\nthe dance of honor in his capacity of \"rifle-king,\" she throws herself\ninto his arms and whirls away.\n\nJohannes puts his hand to his burning brow, and looks after the couple,\nbut the lights and the figures melt away before his eyes into one\nheaving chaos: everything seems to be turning round and round--he\nstaggers--he has to clutch hold of a pillar to prevent himself from\nfalling; and when at that moment Franz Maas returns with Trude, he begs\nhim to take charge of his sister-in-law for half an hour; he must go\nout for a whiff of fresh air.\n\nHe steps out of the hot, close tent, in which two candelabra filled\nwith tallow candles diffuse an unbearable smoke--out into the clear,\ncool night. But here too are noise and fiddling! In the shooting booths\nthe bolts of the air-guns are rattling, from the gaming tables comes\nthe hoarse screaming of their owners, trying to allure people, and the\nmerry-go-round spins along in the darkness, laden with all its\nglittering tawdriness and accompanied by shouting and clanging.\n\nIn between everything sways the black, surging crowd.\n\nBehind the crests of the pine wood, which silently and gloomily towers\nabove all the tumult, the sky is all aflame with glorious yellow light.\nHalf an hour more and the moon will be pouring its smiling beams over\nthe scene. Johannes walks along slowly between the tents.--In front of\nthe \"Crown\" host's booth he stops and looks in through the window. But\nwhen he sees Martin sitting with a deeply flushed face amidst a swarm\nof rollicking carousers, he creeps back into the darkness, as if he\nwere afraid to meet him.\n\nFrom the adjacent tent comes the sound of noisy singing. He hesitates\nfor a moment, then enters, for his tongue cleaves to the roof of\nhis mouth. He is received with a loud shout of delight. At a long\nbeer-bedabbled table sits a host of his former schoolfellows, rowdy\nfellows, some of them, whom as a rule he seeks to avoid. They surround\nhim; they drink to him; they press him to join their circle. \"Why do\nyou make yourself so scarce, Johannes?\" one of them screams from the\nopposite end of the table, \"and where do you stick of an evening?\"\n\n\"He dangles at the apron-strings of his lovely sister-in-law,\" sneers\nanother. \"Leave my sister-in-law out of the game,\" cries Johannes with\nknitted brows. These proceedings sicken him; this hoarse screaming\noffends his ear; these coarse jests hurt him. He pours down a few\nglasses of cool beer and goes outside, with great difficulty succeeding\nin shaking off the importunate fellows.\n\nHe saunters toward the boundary of the wood and stares into its\nobscurity, already beginning to be animated by pale lunar reflections;\nthen he proceeds for some distance beneath the trees, deeply inhaling\nthe soft, aromatic fragrance of the pines. He is determined that by\nmain force he will master this mysterious intoxication which seems to\nfever his whole being; but the further he betakes himself away from the\nfestival ground the more does his unrest increase. Just as he is about\nto enter the dancing-room he sees Franz Maas hurrying towards him in\nbreathless excitement. A vague presentiment of disaster dawns within\nhim.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he calls out to him.\n\n\"It's a good thing I've found you. Your sister-in-law has been taken\nill.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake! Where have you taken her?\"\n\n\"Martin led her to your tent.\"\n\n\"How did it happen? How did it happen?\"\n\n\"Some time before, I noticed that she had become pale and quiet, and\nwhen I asked her what was the matter, she said her foot hurt her. But\nin spite of that she would not sit still, and, while I was dancing with\nher, she suddenly broke down in the middle of the room.\"\n\n\"And then? What then?\"\n\n\"I raised her up and drew her as quickly as possible to her chair,\nwhile I sent some one off to fetch Martin.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you send for me, man?\"\n\n\"Firstly I didn't know where you were, and then, of course, it was the\nproper thing to send word first to her husband.\"\n\nJohannes breaks into a shrill laugh. \"Very proper, but what then?\"\n\n\"She opened her eyes even before Martin arrived. The first thing she\ndid was to send away the women who were crowding round her! then she\nwhispered to me, 'Don't tell him that I fainted;' and then when he came\nhurrying in, looking quite pale, she went to meet him apparently quite\ncheerfully and said, 'My shoe hurts me; it is nothing else.'\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then he took her outside. But I just happened to see how she burst out\nsobbing and hid her face on his shoulder. Then I thought to myself,\n'God knows what else may be hurting her.'\" Johannes hears no further.\nWithout a word of thanks to his friend he rushes off.\n\nThe canvas which covers the entrance to the Rockhammer tent is let down\nlow. Johannes listens for a moment. Soft weeping mingled with Martin's\nsoothing voice is audible from the interior, he tries to tear the\ncurtain open, but it does not give way; it is evidently fastened down\nwith a peg, \"Who is there?\" calls Martin's voice from the other side.\n\n\"I--Johannes!\"\n\n\"Stay outside.\"\n\nJohannes winces. This \"stay outside\" has given him a very stab at his\nheart. When there is a chance of being at her side to help her in her\ntrouble,--of giving her peace and comfort, he is to \"stay outside.\" He\ngrates his teeth and stares with hungry eyes at the curtain, through\nthe apertures of which a faint red gleam pierces.\n\n\"Johannes!\" Martin's voice is heard anew.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Go and see if our carriage is here.\"\n\nHe does as he is bid. He is just good enough to go errands! He inspects\nthe rows of conveyances, and, when he does not find what he is seeking,\nhe returns to the tent.\n\nNow the curtain is drawn aside. There she stands--a little transparent\nshawl about her shoulders, looking pale and so beautiful.\n\n\"Just as I expected,\" says Martin, when he reports to him--\"the\ncarriage wasn't ordered till daybreak.\"\n\n\"But what now? Does Trude want to go?\" he asks anxiously.\n\n\"Trude must!\" says she, giving him a look out of her tear-stained eyes,\nwhich are already trying to smile again.\n\n\"Resign yourself to it, my child,\" answers Martin, stroking her hair.\n\"If it were only the foot, it would not matter. But your crying just\nnow--all this excitement--I think your illness is still hanging about\nyou and rest will do you good. If only it did not take so long to fetch\nthe carriage! I believe it would be best if you could walk the short\ndistance across the fields--of course, only if you have no more pain.\nCan you manage it?\"\n\nTrude gives Johannes a look; then nods eagerly.\n\n\"The air is warm, the grass is dry,\" Martin continues, \"and Johannes\ncan accompany you.\"\n\nTrude gives a start, and he feels his blood mount in a hot wave to his\nhead. His eyes seek hers, but she avoids his glance.\n\n\"You can easily be here again in half an hour, my dear boy,\" says\nMartin, who takes Johannes' silence to mean vexation. He shakes his\nhead, and declares, with a look at Trude, that he too has had enough of\nit now.\n\n\"Well then, good speed to you, children,\" says Martin, \"and, when I\nhave disbanded my party, I will follow!\"\n\nJohannes sends a look into the distance; the plain which lies before\nhim, swathed in silver veils of moonlight, appears to him like an abyss\nover which mists are brewing; he feels as if the arm which is just\nbeing pushed so gently and caressingly through his were dragging him\ndown--down into the deepest depths.\n\n\"Good-night,\" he murmurs, half turned away from his brother.\n\n\"Aren't you even going to shake hands?\" asked Martin, with playful\nreproach, and, when Johannes hesitatingly extends his right hand, he\ngives it a hearty shake. What pain such a shake of the hand can\ninflict!\n\n\nThe din of the f\u00c3\u00aate more and more dies away into the distance. The\nmany-voiced tumult becomes a dull roaring in which only the shrill\ntinkle of the merry-go-round is distinguishable, and when the\ndance-music, which has been silent so long, commences anew, it drowns\neverything else with its piercing trumpet-blasts.\n\nBut even that grows more and more indistinct, and the big drum alone,\nwhich hitherto has played only a modest part, now gains ascendancy over\nthe other instruments, for its dull, droning beat travels furthest into\nthe distance. Silently they walk beside each other--neither ventures to\naddress the other. Trude's arm trembles in his; her eyes rest upon the\nmists which rise up in the greenish light from the meadows.\n\nShe steps along bravely, though she limps a little and from time to\ntime gives vent to a low moan.\n\nThey have perhaps been walking for about five minutes when she turns\naround and points with outstretched hand towards the twinkling lights\nof the festival ground, that glisten against the black back-ground of\nthe pine-wood. The merry-go-round is spinning its glittering hoop\nround, and the canvas partition of the dancing-room sparkles like a\ncurtain of woven flames.\n\n\"Look, how lovely!\" she whispers timidly.\n\nHe nods.\n\n\"Johannes!\"\n\n\"What is it, Trade?\"\n\n\"Don't be cross with me!\"\n\n\"Why--should I?\"\n\n\"Why did you go away from the dancing?\"\n\n\"Because it was too hot for me in the room.\"\n\n\"Not because I danced with some one else?\"\n\n\"Oh! dear no!\"\n\n\"You know, Hans, I suddenly felt so lonely and forsaken that it was all\nI could do to keep from crying. He might have said he didn't want me to\ndance with anyone else, I said to myself--for whom else did I go to the\nf\u00c3\u00aate but for him? For whom did I adorn myself but for him? And my foot\nhurt me a thousand times worse than before; and then suddenly--well,\nyou know yourself what happened.\"\n\nHe sets his teeth; his arms twitch, as if he must press her to him. Her\nhead leans softly against his shoulder; her shining eyes beam up at\nhim--when suddenly she gives a loud cry: her injured foot which she can\nonly just drag along the ground, has hit against a pointed stone. She\ntries to keep up, but her arm slips away from his, and overcome by\npain, she lets herself drop on to the grass.\n\n\"Just for a moment I should like to lie here,\" she says, and wipes the\ncold perspiration from her brow; then she throws herself down on her\nface and lies there for a while motionless. He grows frightened when he\nsees her thus. \"Come on,\" he exhorts her, \"you will catch cold here.\"\n\nShe stretches out her right hand to him with her face turned away and\nsays, \"Help me up,\" but when she attempts to walk, she breaks down once\nmore. \"You see, it won't do,\" she says with a faint smile.\n\n\"Then I will carry you,\" he cries, opening out his arms wide.\n\nA sound, half of pain, half of joy, escapes her lips; next moment her\nbody lies upraised in his arms. She sighs deeply, and, closing her\neyes, leans her head against his cheek--her bosom heaves upon his\nbreast; her waving hair ripples over his neck; her warming breath\ncaresses his glowing countenance. More firmly does he press her\ntrembling body to him. Away, away further, ever further away, even\nthough his strength fail! Away, to the ends of the earth! His breath\nbecomes labored, acute pains dart through his side, before his eyes\nthere floats a red mist--he feels as though he were about to drop down\nand give up his ghost--but he must go on--further, further.--\n\nOver there the river beckons; the weir's hollow roaring comes through\nthe silent night; the splashing drops of water sparkle in the\nmoonbeams.\n\nShe lets her head fall back upon his arm; a melancholy yet blissful\nsmile plays about her half-opened lips; and now she opens her eyes, in\nwhose somber depths the reflection of the moon is floating.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she murmurs.\n\n\"At the river's edge,\" he gasps.\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\n\"I must--I cannot.\"\n\nClose to the water's edge he lays her down; then he stretches himself\nfull length on the grass, and presses his hand to his heart and\nstruggles for breath. His temples are throbbing, he is in a fair way to\nlose consciousness; but, pulling himself together with an effort, he\nbends his body towards the river, ladles out a handful of water and\nbathes his forehead with it.\n\nThat restores him to consciousness. He turns to Trude. She has buried\nher face in her hands and is moaning softly to herself.\n\n\"Does it hurt very much?\" he asks.\n\n\"It burns!\"\n\n\"Dip your foot in the water. That will cool it.\"\n\nShe drops her hands and looks at him in surprise.\n\n\"It has done me good,\" he says, pointing to his forehead, from which\nsingle drops of water are still trickling down. Then she bends forward\nand tries to pull off her shoe, but her hand trembles, and she grows\nfaint with the effort. \"Let me help you,\" he says. One pull--her shoe\nflies to one side; her stocking follows, and, pushing herself forward\nto the very edge of the bank, she dips her bare foot up to the ankle in\nthe cooling stream.\n\n\"Oh, how refreshing it is!\" she murmurs with a deep breath; then,\nturning to right and to left, she seeks a support for her body.\n\n\"Lean against me,\" he says. Then she lets her head drop upon his\nshoulder. His arm twitches, but he does not dare to twine it round her\nwaist; he hardly dares to move. His breath comes heavily; his eyes\nstare on to the stream, through the crystal waters of which Trude's\nwhite foot gleams like a mother-o'-pearl shell resting in its depths.\n\nThey sit there in silence. Just in front of them, at the weir, the\nwater's rush and roar. The spray forms a silver bridge from bank to\nbank, and the waves break at their feet. From time to time the soft\nnight-breeze wafts hushed music towards them, and the monotonous\ndroning of the big drum comes to them mingled with the dull note of the\nbittern.\n\nSuddenly a shudder passes through her frame.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\"\n\n\"I am shivering.\"\n\n\"Take your foot out of the water at once.\" She does as she is bid, then\ndraws from her pocket the dainty little cambric handkerchief which she\nhad for the ball. \"That is no good,\" he says, and with a trembling hand\npulls out his own coarser handkerchief. \"Let me dry you!\" Silently,\nwith a dumb, pleading look, she submits, and when he feels the soft,\ncool foot between his hands, everything seems to whirl before him; a\nsort of fiery madness comes over him, and, bending down to the ground,\nhe presses his fevered brow upon it.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she cries out.\n\nHe starts up. In wild ecstasy their eyes meet--one wild, exuberant cry,\nand they lie in each other's arms. His kisses burn hot upon her lips.\nShe laughs and cries and takes his head between her hands and strokes\nhis hair and leans her cheek against his cheek and kisses his forehead\nand both his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, my darling, my darling! How I love you!\"\n\n\"Are you my very own?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Shall you always love me?\"\n\n\"Always! Always! And you--you will never again leave me alone like\nto-day so that Martin--\"\n\nAbruptly she stops short. Silence weighs upon them! What terrible\nsilence! The big drum drones in the distance. The waters roar.\n\nTwo deathly pale faces gaze at each other.\n\nAnd now she screams aloud. \"Oh Lord, my God!\" is the cry which resounds\nthrough the night.\n\nLoudly moaning, he covers his face with his hands. Tearless sobs\nshake his frame. Before his eyes everything is aflame--aflame with a\nblood-red light as if the whole world were set on fire. Now it is all\nsuddenly made clear as day to him! What dawned mysteriously within him\nin yonder midsummer night, what flashed like lightning through his\nbrain on that evening when Trude broke down sobbing in the middle of\nher song--all now arises before him like a glowing ball of fire. Every\nflame speaks of hate; every ray flashes with torturing jealousy through\nhis soul, every gleam pierces his heart with fear and guilty\nconsciousness.\n\nTrude has thrown herself face downwards upon the ground, and is\nweeping--weeping bitterly.\n\nWith bowed head and folded hands he gazes upon her fair form, lying\nbefore him in an agony of woe.\n\n\"Come home,\" he says tonelessly. She lifts her head and plants her arms\nfirmly upon the ground; but when he attempts to help her up, she\nscreams out: \"Do not touch me!\" Twice, thrice, she endeavors to stand\nupright, but again and again she breaks down. Then without a word she\nstretches forth her arms, and suffers herself to be drawn up by him. In\nsilence he guides her feeble steps to the mill. Her tears are dried up.\nThe rigidness of despair has settled upon her deathly pale features.\nShe keeps her face averted and resistingly allows him to drag her\nalong. Before the threshold of the veranda she loosens her arm from\nhis, and, with what little strength is left to her, she darts away from\nhim towards the house-door. Her figure disappears among the dark\nfoliage.\n\nThe knocker gives forth its dull beats. Once--twice, then shuffling\nfootsteps become audible in the entrancehall; the key is turned; a dark\nyellow ray of light beams out into the moonlight night.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, madam, how pale you look!\" the maid ejaculates in a\nterrified voice.... The door closes with a bang.\n\nFor a long time Johannes keeps on staring at the place where she has\ndisappeared.--A cold shiver which runs through him from head to foot\nrouses him at length. Absentmindedly he slinks across the moonlit\nyard,--strokes the dogs that with joyous barking drag at their\nchains,--casts an indifferent glance towards the motionless mill-wheel,\nbeneath the shadows of which the waters glide along like glittering\nsnakes. Some indefinable impulse drives him forward and away. The\nground of the mill-yard burns beneath his feet. He wanders across the\nmeadows, back to the weir--to the spot where he was sitting with Trude.\nOn the grass there gleams her blue silk shoe, and not far from it lies\nher long, fine stocking. So she must have limped home with her bare\nfoot and probably is not even conscious of the fact! He breaks into a\nshrill laugh, takes up both and flings them far into the foaming\nwaters.\n\nWhither shall he turn now? The mill has closed its portals upon him\nforevermore. Whither can he go now? Shall he lay himself down to rest\nunder some haystack? He cannot sleep even if he does. Stay! He knows of\na jolly set of fellows--though he despised them a little while ago,\nthey will just suit him now.\n\nWhen, at two o'clock in the morning, Martin Rockhammer has shaken\nhimself free of his drinking companions and is stepping, in the\nhappiest of moods, out on to the festival ground, when the bluish-gray\nlight of dawning day is beginning to illumine the doings of these\nnight-birds, he is met by a band of drunken louts, who, singing obscene\nsongs, break in single file through the ranks of the promenading\ncouples. They are headed by the locksmith Garmann, a fellow of bad\nrepute who practices poaching by night and in whose train now follow\nother good-for-nothing scamps. Intending to turn them out of the place\nforthwith, Martin steps towards them. But suddenly he stops as if\nturned to stone; his arms drop down at his sides: there in the midst of\nthis crew, with glassy eyes and drunken gestures staggers his brother\nJohannes.\n\n\"Johannes!\" he cries out, horrified.\n\nHe starts back; his drink-inflamed face grows ashy pale; a frightened\ngleam flickers in his eyes--he trembles--he stretches forth his arm as\nif to ward him off--and staggers back--two--three paces. Martin feels\nhis anger disappear. This picture of misery arouses his pity. He\nfollows after Johannes, and, taking him by the arm, he says in loving\ntones: \"Come, brother; it is late, let us go home.\" But Johannes\nshrinks back in horror at the touch of his hand, and fixing his gaze\nupon him in mortal agony, he says in a hoarse voice: \"Leave me--I do\nnot wish to--I do not wish to have anything more to do with you--I am\nno longer your brother.\" Martin starts up, clutches with his two hands\nat the slab of the table near him and then drops down upon the nearest\nbench as if felled by the stroke of an axe.\n\nJohannes, however, rushes away. The forest closes in upon him.\n\n\nHenceforth come sad days for the Rockhammer mill.\n\nWhen Martin reached home on that morning, when he found the whole house\nquiet, as quiet as a mouse, he took the key of the mill from the wall\nand slunk off to that melancholy place which he had built up as the\ntemple of his guilt. There his people found him at midday, pale as the\nwhitewashed walls, his head bowed upon his hands, muttering to himself\nincessantly: \"Retribution for Fritz! Retribution for Fritz!\" The\nphantom, the old terrible phantom, which he had thought was laid for\nevermore, has cast itself upon him anew and is twining its strangling\nclaw about his neck.\n\nThe men had to drag him almost by force from his den. With weary,\nhalting steps he staggered out of the mill. His wife he found crouching\nin a corner, with hollow cheeks and gaunt, terrified eyes. Then he took\nher face between his two hands, looked for a while with stern looks at\nthe trembling woman, and once more murmured the mournful refrain:\n\"Retribution for Fritz! Retribution for Fritz!\"\n\nWhen she heard his ominous words, a cold shiver ran through her frame.\n\"Does he know? Does he not know? Has Johannes confessed to him! Has he\nfound out by chance? Does he perhaps only suspect?\" Since that time her\nsoul is fretting itself away; her body repines in fear of this man and\nin yearning for that other, whom love of her has driven away. She grows\npale and thin; her cheeks fade. She steals about like a somnambulist.\nRound her eyes bluish grooves are outlined, and grow broader and\nbroader, and about her mouth is graven a tiny wrinkle which keeps on\ntwitching and moving like a dancing will-o'-the-wisp.\n\nMartin remarks nothing of all this. His whole being is absorbed in\nsorrow for his lost brother. During the first few days, he has hoped\nfrom hour to hour for his return--hoped that he was possibly quite\nunconscious of the words he spoke in the madness of intoxication. As\nfor him--he would verily be the very last to remind him of them. But\nwhen day after day passes without any news of Johannes, his fear grows\nmore and more terrible, he begins to search for the lost one;--at first\nwith little result, for the intercourse between one village and the\nnext is very slight. But gradually one report after another reaches the\nmill. To-day he has been seen here, yesterday, there--erring restlessly\nfrom place to place but always surrounded by a band of merry-makers.\nThe people call him \"Madcap Hans,\" and, wherever he appears, the\npublic-house is sure to be full--corks fly and glasses clink, and\nsometimes, when things become specially lively, the window-panes clink\ntoo, for the bottles go flying out through them into the street. Keep\nit up! \"Madcap Hans\" will pay up for the whole lot. He will stand treat\nto any one he happens to come across, and there are boisterous songs\nand comic anecdotes fit to make one's sides split with laughing. Yes,\nhe's a fine bottle-companion, is \"Madcap Hans.\"\n\nSoon, too, various very doubtful personages appear at the door of the\nRockhammer mill, people with whom one does not like to come into\ncontact; such as the corn-usurer. Lob Levi from Beelitzhof, and the\ncommon butcher Hoffman from Gruenehalde; they present yellow, greasy\nlittle papers which bear his brother's signature and turn out to be\npromissory notes with such and such interest for so many days.\n\nMartin stares for a long time at the unsteady hand-writing; where the\nstrokes are all tumbling over as if drunk, then he goes to his safe\nand, without a word, pays the debts as well as the usurious interest.\nHow gladly he would give the half of his fortune, could he buy his\nbrother's return therewith!\n\nAt length he has the horses put to the carriage and himself sets out in\nquest. He drives miles away; he is about whole nights through, but\nnever does he succeed in getting hold of his brother. The information\nhe receives from the inn-keepers is scanty and confused--some answer\nhim with awkward prevarication, others with sly attempts at\nconcealment--they all seem to guess that their rich profits will go to\nthe devil as soon as the owner of the Rockhammer mill once more gets\npossession of his scape-grace brother. When Martin begins to notice\nthat he is being taken in, he loses heart. He has the carriage put up\nin the coach-house and locks himself in for several days in his\n\"office.\" During that time he is gravely considering whether it would\nbe advisable to secure the service of the Marienfeld gendarmes. For\nhim, of course, by virtue of his official authority, it would be an\neasy matter to extort the truth from these people. Yet no!--it would\nhardly be compatible with the honor of the Rockhammer family to have\nhis brother hunted for by the police--why it would make his old father\nturn in his grave!\n\nA cold, brought on by his nocturnal expeditions, throws him upon the\nsickbed. Through two terrible weeks Trude sits by day and by night at\nhis bedside, tortured by his delirious ravings in which his two\nbrothers, the dead and the living one, now singly, now together,\ntransformed to one horrible two-headed monster, haunt and encircle him.\n\nAs soon as he is halfway convalescent, he has the carriage got ready.\n_Some_ time he must find him!\n\nAnd he does find him.\n\nLate one evening at the beginning of September, his road happens to\npass through B----, a village two miles north of Marienfeld.\n\nThrough the closed shutters of the tavern boisterous noises reach his\nears--stamping of feet, brawling and drunken singing. Slowly he gets\nout of the carriage, and ties up his horse at the entrance to the inn.\nThe lantern flickers dimly in the night wind--heavy drops of rain come\npelting down. The handle of the taproom door rattles in his hand; one\npush--it flies open wide. Thick, bluish-yellow tobacco fumes assail him\nas he enters, mixed with the odor of stale beer and foul-smelling\nspirits.\n\nAnd there, at the top end of the long, roughly-hewn table, with flabby\ncheeks, with his eyes all red and swollen, with that glassy stare\nhabitual to drunkards, with matted, unkempt hair, with a dirty\nshirt-collar and slovenly coat to which hang blades of straw--perhaps\nthe reminders of his last night quarters--there that picture of\nprecocious vice and hopeless ruin, that, that is all that remains to\nhim of his darling, of his all in all ...\n\n\"Johannes!\" he cries, and the driver's whip which he holds in his hand\nfalls clattering to the ground.\n\nA dead silence comes over the densely crowded room, as the tipplers\ngaze openmouthed at this intruder. The wretched man has started up from\nhis seat, his face petrified with nameless fear, a hollow groan breaks\nfrom his lips; with one desperate leap he springs upon the table; with\na second one he endeavors to reach the door over the heads of those\nsitting nearest to him.\n\nNo good! His brother's iron fist is planted upon his chest.\n\n\"Stay here!\" he hears close to his ear in angry, muffled accents;\nthereupon he feels himself being pushed with superhuman strength\ntowards the fire-corner, where he sinks down helplessly.\n\nThen Martin opens the door as far as ever its hinges will allow, points\nwith the butt-end of his whip towards the dark entry and plants himself\nin the middle of the taproom.\n\n\"Out with you!\" he cries in a voice which makes the glasses on the\ntable vibrate. The tipplers, most of them green youths, retreat in\nterror before him, and hastily don their caps; only here and there some\nsuppressed grumbling is heard.\n\n\"Out with you!\" he cried once more and makes a gesture as if about to\ntake one of the nearest grumblers by the throat. Two minutes later the\ntaproom is swept clear ... only the innkeeper remains, standing half\npetrified with fear behind the bar; now, when Martin fixes his gloomy\ngaze upon him, he begins to complain in a whining tone of this\ndisturbance to his business.\n\nMartin puts his hand in his pocket, throws him a handful of florins and\nsays: \"I wish to be alone with him.\"\n\nWhen he has bolted the door after the humbly bowing innkeeper, he walks\nwith slow steps towards Johannes, who is crouching motionless in his\ncorner, with his face buried in his hands. He places his hand gently\nupon his shoulder and says in a voice in which infinite love and\ninfinite pain tremble: \"Rise up, my boy; let us talk to one another.\"\n\nJohannes does not stir.\n\n\"Will you not tell me what grievance you have against me? It will do\nyou good to speak out, my boy! Relieve your feelings, my boy!\"\n\nJohannes drops his hands and laughs hoarsely: \"Relieve my feelings!\nHa-ha-ha!\" That secret terror that distorted his features before as\nwith a cramp has now changed to dull, obstinate stubbornness.\n\nWavering between horror and pity, Martin looks upon this countenance\nin which deep furrows have left nothing, not a trace of his former\nopen-faced, good-natured Johannes. Every evil passion must have worked\ntherein to disfigure it so wretchedly within six short weeks. Now he\nraises himself up and casts a searching look towards the door. \"It\nseems you have locked me in,\" he says with a fresh outburst of laughter\nthat cuts Martin to the quick.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I suppose you intend dragging me with you like a criminal?\"\n\n\"Johannes!\"\n\n\"Go on. I know you are the stronger! But one thing let me tell you: I\nam not yet so wretched but that I should resist. I would rather fling\nmyself from the carriage and dash my head against a curbstone than come\nback with you.\"\n\n\"Have pity, merciful God!\" cries Martin. \"My boy, my boy, what have\nthey made of you?\"\n\nJohannes paces the room with heavy tread and snaps open the lids of the\nbeer-mugs as he passes.\n\n\"Cut it short,\" he then says, standing still. \"What do you want with me\nthat you imprison me here?\"\n\nMartin goes silently to the door and lets the bolt fly back; then he\nplaces himself close in front of his brother. His bosom heaves as if he\nwere laboring to raise the words he is about to speak from the\nuttermost depths of his soul. But what good is it? They stick fast in\nhis throat. He has never been a fluent talker--poor, shy fellow that he\nis, and how is he to find tongues of flame now with which to talk this\nmadman out of his delusions? All he can stammer forth is that one\nquestion:\n\n\"What have I done to you? What have I done to you?\"\n\nHe says the words twice, thrice, and over and over again. What better\ncan he find to say? All his love, all his misery, are contained in\nthese.\n\nJohannes answers not a word. He has seated himself on a bench, and is\nrunning the fingers of both his hands through his unkempt hair. About\nhis lips there lurks a smile--a terrible smile, void of comfort or\nhope.\n\nAt length he interrupts his helpless brother who keeps on repeating his\nformula as if to conjure therewith. \"Let that be,\" he says, \"you have\nnothing to say to me; nor can you have anything to say to me. I have\ndone with myself, with you, with the whole world. What I have been\nthrough in these last six weeks--I tell you, since I left the mill, I\nhave slept under no roof, for I felt sure it must fall down upon me.\"\n\n\"But for heaven's sake, what ...?\"\n\n\"Do not ask me.... It is no good, for you won't get to know, not\nthrough me.... Let all talking alone, for it is to no purpose ... and\nif you were to entreat me by the memory of our parents....\"\n\n\"Yes, our parents!\" stammers Martin joyfully. Why did he not think of\nthat sooner?\n\n\"Let them rest quietly in their graves,\" says Johannes with an ugly\nlaugh. \"Even that won't catch on with me. They can't prevent me from\ngoing to the dogs nor from hating you!\"\n\nMartin groans aloud and drops down as if struck.\n\n\"It is just because I _did_ always think of them, because I tried again\nand again to remember that Martin Rockhammer is my brother, that things\nhave turned out like this and not differently. It has cost me a heavy\nsacrifice,--you may believe me that! I have behaved quite fairly\ntowards you, ha-ha-ha, brother--quite fairly!\"\n\nMartin inquires no further. The solution of this riddle is perfectly\nclear to him. Old blood-guilt has risen from the grave to claim its\npenalty.... He folds his hands and mutters softly:\n\n\"Retribution for Fritz! Retribution for Fritz!\"\n\n\"For one reason, however, you are quite right to remind me of our\nparents; I must not bring shame upon their name, upon the name of\nRockhammer! That is the one thing which has been worrying me all\nalong--even though it did not alter matters; for surely a man must\nenjoy himself somehow ... ha-ha-ha! After all I am quite glad to have\nmet you, for we can talk things over quietly ... I intend going to\nAmerica!\"\n\nMartin looks for a while into his glowing, bloated face; then he says\nsoftly, \"Go, in God's name!\" and lets his hand drop heavily upon the\ntable slab.\n\n\"And soon, too, what's more,\" Johannes continues. \"I have already made\nenquiries. On the first of October the ship sails from Bremen--next\nweek I shall have to leave here,--you know what part of our inheritance\nis owing to me--I dare say, by the bye, that I have got through a good\nbit of it already; give me as much as you happen to have handy in cash\nand send it to Franz Maas; I will fetch it from him.\"\n\n\"And won't you come just once more to the--to the--\"\n\n\"To the mill? Never!\" cries Johannes starting up, while a restless\ngleam, full of terror and of longing, comes into his eyes.\n\n\"And you expect me to--I am to bid you good-bye here--here in this\ndisgusting hole--good-bye forever? good-bye forever?\"\n\n\"I suppose that is what it will be,\" says Johannes, bowing his head.\n\nThen Martin falls all in a heap and once more murmurs, \"Retribution for\nFritz!\"\n\nWith burning eyes Johannes stares at his brother, crouching there\nbefore him as if broken, body and soul.... He is quite determined never\nto see him again ... but he must give a hand at parting!\n\n\"Farewell, brother,\" he says, approaching him, as he sits there\nmotionless. \"Keep well and happy!\" Then, suddenly, a warm, gentle\nsensation comes over him. His brain reels. A thousand scenes seem\nsimultaneously to be evoked. He sees himself as a child, petted and\nspoilt by his elder brother, he sees himself as a youth proudly walking\nat his side, he sees himself with him at their parent's death-bed, he\nsees himself hand in hand with him at that solemn moment when they\nvowed never to part, nor to let any third person come between them.\n\nAnd now!--And now!\n\n\"Brother!\" he cries aloud--and loudly sobbing he falls at his feet.\n\n\"My boy--my dear boy.\" He sobs and cries with joy, and catches hold of\nhim with both hands and presses him to him as if he nevermore would let\nhim go.\n\n\"Now I have got you ... oh, thank heaven--now I have got you! Now\neverything will come right again--won't it? Tell me it was all only a\ndream--only madness! You did not know what you were doing--eh? You\ndon't remember anything of it--eh? I bet you haven't any notion of it\nall--eh? Now you have woke up, haven't you--you have woke up again\nnow?\"\n\nJohannes digs his teeth into his lips till they smart and leans his\nface upon his breast. Then suddenly a thought takes possession of him\nand weighs him down and buzzes in his ears--a thought like a vampire,\ncold and damp, and beating the air with bat's wings.... In these arms\nTrude has rested this very day--this very day....\n\nHe jumps up abruptly.\n\nAway from this place, away from this atmosphere--else madness will\nreally assail him!\n\nHe rushes towards the door. One creak of its hinges, one click of the\nlock: he has disappeared.\n\nMartin looks after him, mute with consternation; then he says, as if to\nquell his rising fear:\n\n\"He is too excited; he wants some fresh air. He will come back!\"\n\nHis glance falls upon the wooden clothes=pegs on the opposite wall. He\nsmiles, now quite reassured, and says \"He has left his cap here; it is\nraining outside, the wind blows cold; he will come back.\" Thereupon he\ncalls the innkeeper, orders his horse to be put up and has some hot\ngrog mixed for his brother, and a bed prepared for him. \"For,\" he says\nwith a blissful smile, \"he will come back again.\"\n\nWhen everything is made ready he sits down on the bench and becomes\nlost in brooding. From time to time he murmurs as if to resuscitate his\nsinking courage:\n\n\"He will come back!\"\n\nOutside the rain beats against the windowpanes, autumn blasts are\nsoughing around the housetop, and every gust of wind, every drop of\nrain, seems to proclaim:\n\n\"He will come back! He will come back!\" The how's pass; the lamp goes\nout.... Martin has fallen asleep over his waiting and is dreaming of\nhis brother's return.\n\n\nIn the morning the people of the inn wake him. Haggard and shivering he\nlooks about him. His glance falls upon the empty bed in which his\nbrother was to have slept. The first bed since six weeks!--Sadly he\nstands there in front of it and stares at it. Then he has his\nconveyance brought round and drives off.\n\n\nThis year autumn has come early. Since a week there has been a rough\nnorth wind which cuts through one's body as if it were November. Gusts\nof rain beat against the window-panes and the ground is already covered\nwith a layer of yellowish-brown half-decayed leaves off the lime-trees.\nAnd how soon it grows dark! In the bakery a light burns in the swinging\nlamp long before supper-time. Beneath its globe sits Franz Maas,\neagerly reckoning up and counting. On the baker's table before him\nwhere as a rule the little white round heaps of dough are ranged,\nto-day there are little white round heaps of florins, and instead of\nthe crisp \"Bretzels\" to-day the paper of bank-notes is crackling.\n\nThis is the treasure which Martin Rockhammer entrusted to him the\nSunday before, with instructions to hand it over to Johannes. He also\nleft a letter in which the various items of the inheritance are set\ndown to a penny.\n\nEvery morning since then he has knocked at the door, and each time\nasked the selfsame question, \"Has he been?\" Then when Franz Maas shook\nhis head, has silently departed again.\n\nTo-day the same. To-day is Friday; today he must come if he wants to be\nin time for the Bremen ship. Noiselessly he has opened the door and is\nstanding behind him, just as he is about to lock the money away. \"I\nsuppose that is all for me,\" he asks, laying his hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Thank heaven I you have come,\" cries Franz, agreeably startled. Then\nhe casts a critical glance over his friend's figure. Martin must have\nbeen exaggerating when, with tears in his eyes, he described his\ndilapidated appearance. He looks decent and respectable, is wearing a\nbrand new waterproof, beneath the turned-back flaps of which a neat\ngray suit is visible. His hair is smoothly brushed--he is even shaved.\nBut of course his dark, dulled gaze, the bagginess under his eyes, the\nugly red of his cheeks, are sad witnesses in this face, eretime so\nyouthfully joyous.\n\nAnd then he grasps both his hands and says:\n\n\"Johannes, Johannes, what has come over you?\"\n\n\"Patience; you shall hear all!\" he replies, \"I must confide in one\nliving soul, or it will eat my very heart out over there.\"\n\n\"Then you really mean it? You intend--\"\n\n\"I am off to-night by the mail-coach. My seat is already booked. Before\nI came to you, I went once more through the village. It was already\ndark, so I could venture--and I took leave of everything. I went to our\nparents' grave, and as far as the church door, and to the host of the\n'Crown,' to whom I owed a trifle.\"\n\n\"And you forgot the mill?\"\n\nJohannes bites his lips and chews at his moustache; then he mutters:\n\"That is still to come.\"\n\n\"Oh, how glad Martin will be,\" cries Franz Maas, quite red with\npleasure himself.\n\n\"Did I say I was going to see Martin?\" asks Johannes between his teeth,\nwhile his chest heaves, as if it had a load of embarrassment to throw\noff.\n\n\"What? You intend slinking about on your father's inheritance like a\nthief,--avoiding a meeting with any one?\"\n\n\"Not that either. I have to bid good-bye to some one, but not to\nMartin!\"\n\n\"To whom else then?--To whom else, man?\" cries Franz Maas, in whom a\nhorrible suspicion dawns.\n\n\"Lock the door and sit down here,\" says Johannes,--\"now I will tell\nyou.\"\n\nThe hours pass by; the storm rattles at the shutters. The oil in the\nlamp begins to splutter. The two friends sit with their heads together,\ntheir looks occasionally meeting. Johannes confesses--conceals nothing.\nHe begins with that first meeting with Trude, up to the moment when\nhorror drove him forth from Martin's embrace--out into the stormy\nnight.\n\n\"What came after that,\" he concludes, \"can be told in a few words. I\nran without knowing whither, until the cold and wet restored me to\nconsciousness. Then the post-chaise from Marienfeld just happened to\ncome along. I stopped it--at last I got under cover by this means. Thus\nI came to the town, where I have been putting up till now. Lob Levi had\njust given me a hundred thalers. With these I rigged myself out afresh,\nfor I did not want to face Trude in the dilapidated state I was in.\"\n\n\"Miserable wretch--are you going to ...?\"\n\n\"Don't kick up a row,\" he says roughly. \"It is all arranged, already. I\ngave a note for her to a little boy I met in the street, and waited\ntill he came back. She took it from him in the kitchen without even a\nservant noticing anything. At eleven o'clock she will be at the weir,\nand I--ha-ha-ha- ... I too!\"\n\n\"Johannes, I beg and implore you, don't do it,\" cries Franz in sheer\nterror. \"There's sure to be a misfortune.\" Johannes' reply is a hoarse\nlaugh, and, with burning eyes, his mouth put close to his friend's ear,\nhe hisses: \"Do you really think, man, that I could manage to live and\nto die in a strange country if I did not see her just once more? Do you\nimagine I should have courage to stare for four weeks at the sea\nwithout throwing myself into it--if I did not see her once more? The\nvery air for breathing would fail me, my meat and drink would stick in\nmy throat, I should rot away alive if I did not see her just once\nmore!\"\n\nWhen Franz hears all this he refrains from further discussion.\n\nJohannes' restless glance wanders towards the clock. \"It is time,\" he\nsays, and takes his cap. \"At midnight the mail-coach comes through the\nvillage. Expect me at the post office and bring me two hundred-thaler\nnotes; that will be enough for my passage. The rest you can give back\nto him; I shan't want it! Good-bye till then!\" At the door he turns\nround and asks: \"I say, does my breath smell of brandy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe breaks into a coarse laugh; then he says: \"Give me a few coffee\nbeans to chew. I don't want Trude to get a horror of me in this last\nhour.\"\n\nAnd when Franz has given him what he wants he disappears into the\ndarkness.\n\nIt is high water to-day. With a great hissing and roaring the waters\nshoot down the declivity, then sink down into their foaming grave with\ndull, plaintive rumblings, while the glistening spray breaks over them\nin one high-vaulted arch.\n\nThe howling of the storm mingles with the tumult of these volumes of\nwater. The old alders alongside the river bow and bend to each other\nlike shadowy giants come forth in their numbers to dance a reel in one\nlong line. The heavens are obscured by heavy rain-clouds,--everything\nis dark and black except the snowy froth, which seems to throw out an\nuncertain light against which the outlines of the wood planking are\ndimly visible. Above that projects the rail of the little drawbridge,\nin appearance like the phantom form of a cat, creeping with\noutstretched legs across a roof.\n\nOn the drawbridge the two meet. Trude, her head covered by a dark\nshawl, has been standing for a long time beneath the alders, seeking\nshelter from the rain, and has hurried to meet him as she saw the\noutline of his figure appear on yonder side of the weir.\n\n\"Trude, is it you?\" he asks hurriedly, looking searchingly into her\nface. She is silent and clings to the rail. The foam is dancing before\nher eyes, in blue and yellow colors.\n\n\"Trude,\" he says, while he tries to catch hold of her hand, \"I have\ncome to bid you farewell for life. Are you going to let me go forth to\na strange land without one word?\"\n\n\"And I have come for the peace of my soul,\" says she, shrinking back\nfrom his groping hand. \"Hans, I have borne much for your sake; I have\ngrown older by half a lifetime; I am weak and ill. Therefore take pity\non me: do not touch me--I do not want to return again guilt-laden to\nyour brother's house!\"\n\n\"Trude--did you come here to torture me?\"\n\n\"Softly, Hans, softly--do not pain me! Let us part from one another with\nclean and honest hearts, and take peace and courage with us--for all\nour lives.... We must surely not rail at each other--not in love and\nnot in hatred,\" She stops exhausted; her breath comes heavily; then,\npulling herself together with an effort, she continues: \"You see, I\nalways knew that you would come long before I got your note to-day;\nand, a thousand times over I thought out every word--that I was going\nto say to you. But of course--you must not unsettle me so.\"\n\nHis eyes glow through the darkness; his breath comes hot; and with a\nshrill laugh he says:\n\n\"Don't make a halo round us. It is no good--we are both accursed anyway\nin heaven and on earth! Then let us at least--\"\n\nHe stops abruptly, listening.\n\n\"Hush! I thought--I heard--there in the meadow!\"\n\nHe holds his breath and hearkens. Nothing to be heard or seen. Whatever\nit was, the storm and the darkness have engulfed it.\n\n\"Come down to the river's edge,\" he says, \"our figures are so clearly\ndefined up here.\"\n\nShe leads the way; he follows. But on the slippery woodwork she loses\nher footing. Then he catches her in his arms and carries her down to\nthe river. Unresisting, she hangs upon his neck.\n\n\"How light you have got since that day,\" he says softly, while he lets\nher glide down, then raises her up.\n\n\"Oh, you would hardly recognize me if you saw me,\" she replies equally\nsoftly.\n\n\"I would give anything if only I could!\" he says, and tries to draw\naway the shawl from about her face. A pale oval, two dark, round\nshadows in it where the eyes are--the darkness reveals no more.\n\n\"I feel like a blind man,\" he says, and his trembling hand glides over\nher forehead, down to her cheeks, as if by touch to distinguish the\nloved features. She resists no longer. Her head drops upon his\nshoulder.\n\n\"How much I wanted to say to you!\" she whispers. \"And now I no longer\ncan think of anything--not of anything at all.\"\n\nHe twines his arms more closely around her. They stand there silent and\nmotionless while the storm tugs and tears at them, and the rain beats\ndown upon their heads.\n\nThen from the village come the cracked notes of the post-horn, half\ndrowned by the blast.\n\n\"Our time is up,\" he says, shivering. \"I must go.\"\n\n\"Now--the night?\" she stammers voicelessly.\n\nHe nods.\n\n\"And I shall never see you again?\"\n\nA wild scream rends the storm.\n\n\"Johannes, have pity, I cannot let you go. I cannot live without you!\"\nHer fingers dig themselves into his shoulders. \"You shall not--I will\nnot let you.\"\n\nHe tries to free himself by main force.\n\n\"Ah, well--you are going--oh--you--you--you are wicked! You know that I\nmust die if you go, I cannot--Take me with you! Take me with you!\"\n\n\"Are you out of your senses, woman?\" He covers his face with his hands\nand groans aloud.\n\n\"So--this is what you call being out of one's senses! Does not even a\nlamb struggle--when led to the slaughter? And you are capable of----Ah,\nis this all your love for me? Is this all? Is this all?\"\n\n\"Don't you think of Martin?\"\n\n\"He is your brother. That is all I know about him. But I know that I\nmust die if I stay with him any longer. It makes me shudder to think of\nhim! Take me with you, my husband! Take me with you!\"\n\nHe grasps both her wrists, and shaking her to and fro, he whispers with\nhalf-choked utterance:\n\n\"And do you know besides that I am ruined and disgraced--an outcast, a\ndrunkard, no good at all in the world? If you could see me, you would\nhave a horror of me, good people shun me and loathe me--do you think I\nshould be good to you? I shall never forgive you for coming between me\nand Martin--never forgive you for making me sin against him as I have\ndone for your sake. He will be between us as long as we live. I shall\ninsult you--I shall beat you when I am drunk. You will find it hell at\nmy side. Well? What do you say now?\"\n\nShe bows her head demurely, folds her hands and says: \"Take me with\nyou!\" A scream of exultant joy escapes his lips. \"Then come--but come\nquickly. The coach stops for a quarter of an hour. No one will see us\nexcept Franz Maas--the only one he will not betray us. In the town you\ncan get clothes and then.... Stop! What does this mean?\"\n\nThe mill has awakened to life. A yellow light streams out into the\ndarkness from the wide-opened door. A lantern sways across the yard\nthen, thrown to one side, flies in a gleaming curve through the air\nlike a shooting star.\n\nMartin lies in bed asleep. Suddenly there is a tap at the window-pane.\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\n\"I--David!\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Open the door, Master! I have something important to tell you.\"\n\nMartin jumps out of bed, strikes a light and hurries on his clothes. A\ncasual glance falls upon Trude's empty bed. Evidently she has dozed off\non the sitting-room over her sewing, for it is a long time since she\nhas known sound, healthy sleep.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asks David, who steps into the entrance\ndripping like a drowned cat.\n\n\"Master,\" he says, blinking from under the peak of his cap, \"it is now\nmore than twenty-eight years since I first came to the mill--and your\nlate father already used to be good to me always....\"\n\n\"And you drag me out of bed in the middle of the night to tell me\n_that_?\"\n\n\"Yes, for to-night when I woke up and heard the rain pelting down, I\nsuddenly remembered with a start that the sluices of the lock were not\nopened.... Perhaps the water might get blocked up and we could not\ngrind to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Haven't I told you fellows hundreds of times that the sluices need\nonly be opened when the ice is drifting? At high water it only means\nunnecessary labor.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't touch them,\" observes David.\n\n\"Then what do you want?\"\n\n\"Because, when I got to the weir I saw two lovers standing on the\ndrawbridge!\"\n\n\"And that's why?...\"\n\n\"Then I thought it was a regular disgrace and a crying shame, and no\nlonger--\"\n\n\"Let them love each other, in the devil's name!\"\n\n\"And I thought it my duty to tell you. Master, when Master Johannes and\nour lady--\"\n\nHe gets no further, for his master's fingers are at his throat.\n\nWhat has come over Martin, wretched man? His face becomes livid and\nswollen; the veins on his forehead stand out; his nostrils quiver, his\neyes seem to start from their sockets--white foam is at his mouth.\n\nThen he gives vent to a sound like the howl of a jackal, and, loosening\nhis grip of David, with one wrench he tears the shirt at his throat\nasunder.\n\nTwo or three deep breaths, like a man who is achoking; then he roars\naloud in suddenly unfettered rage: \"Where are they? They shall account\nto me for this. They have been acting a farce! They have deceived me!\nWhere are they? I'll do for them! I'll do for them, then and there!\"\n\nHe tears the lantern out of terrified David's hand and rushes out. He\ndisappears into the wheel-house; a second later he reappears. High\nabove his head there gleams an axe. Then he swings the lantern thrice\nin a circle and flings it far away from him into the water. He storms\nalong in the direction of the weir.\n\n\"There's some one coming,\" whispers Trude, nestling closer up to\nJohannes.\n\n\"Probably they have something to do at the sluices,\" he whispers back.\n\"Don't stir and be of good courage.\"\n\nNearer and nearer hastens the dark figure. A beastlike roaring pierces\nthrough the night, above the fury of the storm. \"It is Martin,\" says\nJohannes, staggering back three paces.\n\nBut he collects himself quickly, clutches Trude and drags her with him\nclose up to the woodwork at the weir, in the darkest shadow of which\nthey both crouch down.\n\nClose to their heads the infuriated man races along. The axe, lifted on\nhigh, glints in the half-light of the foam. On the other side of the\nweir he stops. He seems to be gazing searchingly across the wide\nmeadow, which spreads before him in monotonous darkness without tree or\nshrub.\n\n\"You keep watch at the hither sluice, David,\" his voice thunders out in\nthe direction of the mill. \"They must be in the field. I shall catch\nthem there!\"\n\nA cry of horror starts from Johannes' lips. He has divined his\nbrother's intention. He is going to pull up the drawbridge and trap\nthem both on the island. And close behind Trude's neck hangs the chain\nwhich must be pulled to make the bridge move back. His first thought\nis: \"Protect the woman!\" He tears himself out of Trude's arms, and\nsprings up the slope of the river-bank to offer himself as a sacrifice\nto his brother's fury.\n\nTrude utters a piercing shriek. Johannes in mortal danger; over there\nthe infuriated man, the axe gleaming bright; but behind her there is\nthat chain, that iron ring which is almost tearing her head open. With\ntrembling hands she grasps hold of it; she tugs at it with all her\nmight. At the very moment when Martin is about to climb upon the\nfoot-plank, the drawbridge swings back.\n\nJohannes sees nothing of it; he only sees the shadow over there, and\nthe gleaming axe. A few paces further, and death will descend swiftly\nupon him. Then suddenly, in the moment of direst distress, he thinks of\nhis mother and what she once said to the enraged boy.\n\n\"Think of Fritz!\" he cries out to his brother. And behold! The axe\ndrops from his hand; he staggers; he falls--one dull thud--one splash:\nhe has disappeared. Johannes rushes forward; his foot hits against the\ndraw-up bridge. Close before him yawns a black hole. \"Brother,\nbrother!\" he cries in frenzied terror. He has no thought, no feeling\nleft, only one sensation: \"Save your brother!\" whirls through his\nbrain. With one jerk he throws off his cloak--a leap--a dull blow as if\nagainst some sharp edge.\n\n\nTrude, who is half unconsciously clutching at the chain, sees a long\ndark mass shoot down the incline into the white waters, and disappear\ninto the foaming whirlpool, a second later another follows.\n\nLike two shadows they flew past her. She turns her gaze upwards towards\nthe woodwork. Up there all is quiet; it is all empty. The storm howls;\nthe waters roar. Fainting, she sinks down at the river's edge.\n\n\nNext day the bodies of the two brothers were pulled out of the river.\nSide by side they were floating on the waters; side by side they were\nburied.\n\nTrude was as if petrified with grief. In tearless despair she brooded\nto herself--she refuses to see any of her relations, even her own\nfather. Franz Maas alone she suffers near her. Faithfully he takes\ncharge of her, kept strangers away from her threshold and attends to\nall formalities.\n\nThere was some rumor of a legal investigation to be held against the\nwretched woman, on the ground of David's dark insinuations. But even\nthough the statements of the old servant were too incomplete and\nconfused to build up a lawsuit upon them, they still sufficed to brand\nTrude Rockhammer as a criminal in the eyes of the world. The more she\nshrinks from all intercourse, the more anxiously she closes the mill to\nall strangers, the more extravagant grow the rumors that were spread\nabout her.\n\n\"The miller-witch,\" people come to call her, and the legends that\nsurrounded her were handed down from one generation to the next. The\nmill now becomes the \"Silent Mill,\" as the popular voice christened\nit. The walls crumble away; the wheels grow rotten; the bright, clear\nstream becomes choked with weeds, and when the State planned a canal\nwhich conducted the water into the main stream above Marienfeld--then\nit degenerated into a marsh.\n\nAnd Trude herself became entirely isolated, for soon she would not even\nallow her one friend to approach her, and closed her doors to him.\n\nBefore her own conscience she was a murderess. Her terrors drove her to\na father confessor and into the arms of the Catholic Church. She was to\nbe seen crawling at the foot of a crucifix or kneeling at church doors,\ntelling her beads and beating her head against the stones till it bled.\n\nShe is expiating the great crime which is known as \"youth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Silent Mill, by Hermann Sudermann\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SILENT MILL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 34407-8.txt or 34407-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/4\/4\/0\/34407\/\n\nProduced by Charles Bowen, from page scans provided by the Web Archive\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":657,"split":"train"}
