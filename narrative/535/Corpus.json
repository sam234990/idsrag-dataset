{"ori_id":"7ef394b11230baf81f61e790839fa993c6ea1f72","title":"Take Shelter","context":"Take Shelter\n In Lagrange, Ohio, Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) has apocalyptic dreams, and visual and auditory hallucinations; of rain \"like fresh motor oil\", swarms of menacing black birds, and being harmed by people close to him. He hides all of this from his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and their deaf daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart). He instead channels his anxieties into a compulsive obsession to build a storm shelter in his backyard; however, his increasingly strange behavior -- including a tendency to cut ties with anyone in his life that has harmed him only in his dreams -- strains his relationship with his family, friends, employer, and the close-knit town. Curtis grudgingly sees a counselor at a free clinic, with whom he talks about his family's psychological history (his mother (Kathy Baker) suffers from paranoid schizophrenia that surfaced in her at about the same age that Curtis is now).\nIn order to get the expanded storm shelter done, Curtis breaks work rules by using equipment from his construction job at his house, and gets a home improvement loan he can ill afford to start building the shelter - all without telling his wife. Sam becomes angry when she discovers the project. After Curtis takes more than the prescribed dose of a sedative and suffers a seizure, Sam calls an ambulance. He recovers, then finally explains the truth to her, including his dreams.\nCurtis begins to miss more work, causing tensions with his boss, as he and Sam make preparations for the cochlear implant surgery Hannah is to undergo in six weeks' time. Having been informed of the borrowed work equipment, Curtis's boss fires him and gives him only two weeks' worth of medical insurance benefits, after placing Dewart (Shea Whigham) (the close friend and co-worker whom Curtis asked to help him start construction of the shelter) on two weeks' unpaid administrative leave.\nCurtis buys gas masks for his family, and extends his previous employer's health insurance policy for a few extra weeks. Finding that his counselor at the free clinic has suddenly transferred and been replaced with a new one, he walks out. Tensions linger between Curtis and Sam over his loss of a job\/income at such a crucial time for their family. Sam gets Curtis to see an actual psychiatrist, and demands that they attend a social function so she can restore some sense of normalcy to their strained, increasingly isolated life. At a Lions Club community gathering, a bitter Dewart (who has been spreading a whispering campaign about Curtis being crazy) angrily provokes and punches Curtis. Curtis loses his temper and unleashes a frightening verbal tirade upon everyone at the Lions Club dinner. He prophetically shouts that a devastating storm is coming, insisting that none of them are prepared.\nLater, a tornado warning sends him and his family into the shelter. After they awaken, Curtis reluctantly removes his gas mask, prompted by Samantha. They go to open the shelter doors, but he still hears a storm outside. His wife implores him, insisting that there's no storm and that he needs to open the door. After a tense standoff, Curtis throws open the doors into the blinding sun; a strong-but-bearable storm has passed, and neighbors are cleaning up broken tree limbs and other yard debris as power company trucks restore electricity along the street.\nA psychiatrist advises the couple to go through with their planned, annual beach vacation; but that Curtis will need to get psychiatric care in a facility away from his family upon their return. At Myrtle Beach, while Curtis is building sand castles with Hannah, she signs the word \"storm\". As Samantha exits their beachhouse, the thick, oily rain that Curtis spoke of begins to fall, staining her outstretched hand. Sam looks up to a bigger version of the ominous storm clouds Curtis had seen, massing over the ocean; tornado-like waterspouts reach down to the ocean's surface, and the tide pulls back as a tsunami looms in the distance. Curtis and Sam exchange knowing glances.\n<html>\n<head><title>Take Shelter Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Take Shelter script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Take Shelter script, Take Shelter movie script, Take Shelter film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\n<\/b>\n          Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A\n          strong wind bends them back, showing their light green\n          bellies.\n\n          This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane\n          tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to\n          be more rural than suburb.\n\n          CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked\n          on the sky, narrow as he stares at...\n\n          A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.\n          It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and\n          gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending\n          wispy tentacles toward the ground.\n\n          Curtis stands, awestruck.\n\n          The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake\n          his position. A light rain begins.\n\n          The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his\n          cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder\n          now. He notices something strange.\n\n          The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his\n          shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his\n          palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.\n\n          He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an\n          amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.\n\n          Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.\n          Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends\n          back the trunk of the maple tree.\n\n          Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.\n\n<b>          TITLE: TAKE SHELTER\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n<b>          INT.

It clips into her hair near the\n          back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian\n          Ridgeback that appreciates the attention.\n          Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In\n          the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand\n          and sets it on her plate.\n\n<b>                          CURTIS\n<\/b>           (takes a seat)\n           No, no, no...Don't feed the dog\n           darlin'.\n          Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds\n          it to the dog.

She looks down at Curtis in disbelief.\n\n<b>           91.\n<\/b>\n                         \n          Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact. He\n          studies her face.\n          Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. She\n          looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis. Concern\n          on her face, she nods to him.\n          Curtis sees her nod.\n          Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to\n          apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, \"I love you.\"\n          Curtis nods back to her.\n          She looks back up to the shoreline.\n\n<b>          ON THE BEACH,\n<\/b>          Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.\n\n<b>          AT THE CONDO,\n<\/b>          Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to\n          fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm\n          up. Dark rain collects there.\n\n<b>          ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,\n<\/b>\n<b>          THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS. THE DARK\n<\/b>\n<b>          SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR. A STORM CELL\n<\/b>\n<b>          SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON. CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED\n<\/b>\n<b>          WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING.\n<\/b>          Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door\n          clutching Hannah. The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass\n          next to him.\n\n<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Sam.\n          Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous\n          rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.\n          On Samantha's face,\n\n<b>                          SAMANTHA\n<\/b>           Okay.\n\n<b>           THE END.\n<\/b>\n<b>                          \n<\/b>\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Take-Shelter.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Take Shelter<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Jeff Nichols\" title=\"Scripts by Jeff Nichols\">Jeff Nichols<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Take Shelter Script.html#comments\" title=\"Take Shelter comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":535,"split":"train"}
