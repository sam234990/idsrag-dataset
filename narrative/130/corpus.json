{"ori_id":"1c2beb941aa7e22acbbf8ce285e0a999d27a493b","title":"Six Degrees of Separation (film)","context":"Six Degrees of Separation (film)\n Fifth Avenue socialite Ouisa Kittredge (Stockard Channing) and her art dealer husband Flan (Donald Sutherland), are parents of \"two at Harvard and one at Groton\". But the narrow world inhabited by the Kittredges and their public status as people interested in the arts make them easy prey for Paul (Will Smith). Paul is a skillful con-artist, who mysteriously appears at their door one night, injured and bleeding, claiming to be a close college friend of their Ivy League kids, as well as the son of Sidney Poitier. Ouisa and Flan are much impressed by Paul's fine taste, keen wit, articulate literary expositions and surprising culinary skill. His appealing facade soon has the Kittredges putting him up, lending him money and taking satisfaction in his praise for their posh lifestyle. Paul's scheme continues until he brings home a hustler, and his actual indigence is revealed. The shocked Kittredges kick him out when it is revealed that they are but the most recent victims of the duplicity with which Paul has charmed his way into many upper-crust homes along the Upper East Side. Paul's schemes become highbrow legend \u00e2\u0080\u0093 anecdotal accounts of which are bantered about at their cocktail parties. In the end, Paul has a profound effect on the many individuals who encounter him, linking them in their shared experience.\n<html>\n<head><title>Six Degrees of Separation Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Six Degrees of Separation script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Six Degrees of Separation script, Six Degrees of Separation movie script, Six Degrees of Separation film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

attractive couple in their 40s, in their night\n          clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock.\n          Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them.\n          THEY survey their living room which under normal\n          circumstances would appear to be a serene haven.\n          But why are they-so aghast? And terrified?\n          Has the apartment been violated?\n          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with\n          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is\n          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though\n          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern\n          paintings hang on the walls.\n          No. No visible disaster here.\n          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run\n          between the hall and the living room.\n\n<b>                         OUISA\n<\/b>          Is anything gone?\n          OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing\n          leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..\n\n<b>                         FLAW\n<\/b>          How can I look?

It's a double\n          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in\n          different styles on either side of the canvas.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>                         2\n<\/b>          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other\n          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.\n          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it\n          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the\n          geometric side. SHE admires it.\n          FLAN opens the door from the hall into\n\n<b>          THE OFFICE.\n<\/b>          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with\n          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide\n          projector is there.
