{"ori_id":"0bc7352d6a0e678c0d8acc57c0c1cc3466fe9ef7","title":"Poetic Justice (film)","context":"Poetic Justice (film)\n Justice (Janet Jackson) is a young woman living in South Central, Los Angeles. She was named Justice by her late mother, who gave birth to her while attending law school. After the shooting death of her boyfriend Markell (Q-Tip), Justice falls into a deep depression. She spends the majority of her time in the house she inherited from her grandmother, with her cat White Boy, only going out to her job at a local hair salon. Justice is a talented poet, she reads many of her poems throughout the course of the film, both to other characters and in voice over.\nJustice is at the hair salon working one day when a young postal clerk named Lucky (Tupac Shakur) comes in and begins flirting with her. She rebuffs his advances with the help of her female boss; the two women pretend to be lesbians and mock Lucky with their \"relationship\".\nLucky has also had tragedy in his life: his main focus is caring for his young daughter Keisha. He had to forcibly remove her from the care of her mother, Angel, a crack addict who was using drugs and having sex with her drug dealer while leaving the child unattended in the apartment. Lucky dreams of a professional career in music and shows considerable promise, but he insists his cousin is the true talent.\nJustice's friend Iesha (Regina King) manages to talk Justice into taking a road trip to Oakland with Iesha's boyfriend, Chicago (Joe Torry), Lucky's co-worker at the post office. Justice warily accepts, mainly because she has to go to Oakland for a hair show, and her car dies at the last minute. Unbeknownst to Justice, Lucky is Chicago's co-worker also on the trip, and she will now be sharing a postal van with him and their two mutual friends. Initially they argue, but over the course of the film soften towards each other as they discover their similarities.\nThe foursome make a couple of detours, the first being a family reunion barbecue they see signs for on the road. Here it becomes apparent (although there were ample hints earlier) that Iesha and Chicago's relationship is troubled. Iesha openly flirts with other men at the barbecue, while Chicago broods watching her behavior. Iesha and Chicago argue in the mailtruck until Justice talks to Iesha about her behavior with alcohol. Iesha throws up and cries on Justice and apologizes to her. The second stop is a beach where each of the four characters contemplate their separate situations in internal monologues. Next, they stop at an African Cultural Fair where Lucky and Justice grow closer as they discuss their lives. After leaving the fair, the friction between Chicago and Iesha explodes when Iesha informs Chicago she has been seeing someone on the side and he physically attacks her. Lucky initially decides not to get involved in the fight until Justice defends Iesha by kicking Chicago in the groin, and Chicago turns his physical brutality at Justice in retaliation. Lucky, Justice, along with a bleeding and shaken Iesha leave Chicago by the side of the road and continue on their journey.\nLucky stops the postal van at a beach, and Justice goes to see what's wrong. She begins opening up to him about her life and Lucky becomes sympathetic. They share a kiss and Justice walks away apparently unsure of her feelings for Lucky. She goes back to him and they share another kiss.\nWhen the now-threesome arrive in Oakland, they are met with the news that Lucky's cousin, with whom he had been working on recording music, has been killed. Lucky blames himself for not being in Oakland sooner, believing he could have prevented the shooting had he been in town. He turns his anger on Justice, angrily blaming her for distracting him while they were on the road. Jessie gives Justice and Iesha advice about men before the hair show and Lucky's uncle and aunt give Lucky his cousin's recording equipment and decides not to come back to work and to take care of Keisha.\nSome months have passed, and Lucky and Keisha meet up with Justice again back at the hair salon, just at the moment Lucky brings in his daughter Keisha. Lucky is remorseful over his conduct in Oakland and the cruel words he said to Justice there, and apologizes. She smiles at him and they share a passionate kiss. Justice smiles coyly, and then turns her attention to Keisha, fussing over her hair. Justice and Lucky's eyes meet over Keisha's head and they smile, their connection as strong as ever.\n<html><title>Poetic Justice Script<\/title><pre>\nThe \"Poetic Justice\" Script\n\nCOLUMBIA TITLE CARD: ONCE UPON A TTME IN SOUTH CENTRAL LOS We hear voices: one \nmale, the other female. From the\ntone of their speech and the accompanying music, we can tell we are entering a \nromantic scene.\n\nFADE IN:\n\n1 INT FANCY NEW YORK APARTMENT--DINING ROOM--NIGHT Where we see a romantic scene \nplayed out between a man and\na woman. Both are white. The couple have just finished a candlelit dinner.\n\nBRAD: You like your wine? Want s'more?\n\nShe nods her approval.\n\nPENELOPE: Mmmmm you're good. Candles, dinner, wine. What's next?\n\nHe grins.\n\nBRAD: Let me set the mood.\n\nHe goes over to the stereo to turn it on. The Isley Brothers' \"Between the \nSheets\" emanates from the speakers. Brad crosses to the\ncouch and into a position in which to kiss Penelope. He does, and the sound of \n\"Between the Sheets\" is invaded by the remix of A\nTribe Called Quest's \"Bonita Applebum.\"\n\n2 EXT. COMPTON DRIVE-IN THEATER DUSK:SFX\n\nTwo lines of cars wait to enter the drive-in. The heavy bass sounds of hip-hop \nmusic mingle in the air with that of the many window\nspeakers that plag the movie. In the background we can see the couple in the \nprevious scene kissing on a large movie screen. An\nLAPD helicopter flies overhead, transcending us into the next shot. Welcome back \nto South Central Los Angeles.\n\nINT. COMPTON DRIVE-IN THEATER-DUSK SFX\n\nOverhead we see a shaft of Light coming from the drive-in's projector. As we \nmove past a few cars, their inhabitants are all in various\nthrees of sexual foreplay. Some are kissing; others are actually making love. \nAll the windows are steamed up. We hear the voices of\nthe females as the men grunt, groan, moan, and beg over their bodies. Love is in \nthe air.\n\nCAR #1: Don't bite me so hard! You gotta be more gentle.\n\nCAR #2 (softly): Use your tongue. Just use your tongue.\n\nCAR #3 (with heated passion): Ohhhh! Oh, yes, ohhh! Oww! I'm sticking to the \nseat.\n\nWe come to last car, whose windows are crystal clear. Things are just beginning \nto heat up between the couple inside the car. The\nwoman is an \"around the way\" honey with soft brown skin, full brown eyes, and \nnice delicious full lips. This is Justice, who at\nseventeen is still looking for her place in the world. The lucky man kissing her \nis her boyfriend, Markell, a small-time drug dealer and\nformer gangsta. Justice reluctantly accepts his advances, but she ain't having \nit. There is a window speaker, from which the sound of\nthe movie Alters into the car.\n\nMARKELL: C'mon, let's get in the back seat.\n\nJUSTICE: No, Markell, why can't we just watch the movie?\n\nMARKELL: 'Cause it's boring.\n\nHe goes to kiss her again. This time, it's a nice, long, juicy powerhouse kiss \nthat causes the Richter scale to jump two points. Justice\nappears obviously affected. She asks the inevitable question.\n\nJUSTICE: Markell, do you love me?\n\nMARKELL: Of course I love you.\n\nJUSTICE: Why? Tell me why you love me.\n\nMARKELL (looks around): Now?\n\nJUSTICE: Yeah, right now.\n\nThere is a pause. He thinks.\n\nMARKELL: Okay, I love you because you too fine.\n\nJUSTICE: Is that it?\n\nMARKELL: Yeah.\n\nJustice looks dissatisfied.\n\nMARKELL: Can I have some sugar? Some butter? Some sweets?\n\nJUSTICE: No, not yet. Get me some popcorn.\n\nMarkell 's face drops.\n\nJUSTICE: Pleazzze?!\n\nMarkell relents and gets out of the car. He takes two steps, turns on a heel, \nand leans into the car again.\n\nMARKELL: Hey, Justice! I was just thinking. I also love you 'cause when I was in \ntha county jail, you wrote me a lotta sweet poems.\n\nJustice grins. Markell smiles and blows her a kiss good-bye.\n\n4 LNT.COMPTONDRIVE-IN CONCESSION STAND--NIGHT\n\nThere are only a few customers in line; all are Black or Hispanic. Markell gets \nin line, and time slows down. We notice the abruptness\nof the popcorn popping like gunshots, the sound and motion of the gurgling \nOrange Bang machine, and two thugs who stand in the\ncorner talking to each other. Markell seems noticeably nervous at their \npresence.\n\nTHE COUNTER Where Markell finally arrives at the front of the line.\n\nTHE CORNER Where one of the two thugs looks across the room at Markell. For a \nmoment it looks as though he recognizes Markell.\nHe turns back to continue to talk with his friend. A fight breaks out in another \ncorner, and everyone's attention is drawn in that\ndirection.\n\nBACK TO COUNTER Markell completes his transaction amidst the mayhem and walks \naway popcorn in hand. In the corner, the thug\nlooks back toward the counter. On his face we see he now recalls where he has \nseen Markell before.\n\n5 INT\/EXT COMPTON DRIVE-IN---THE CAR--NIGHT Markell comes back to the car, \nglancing behind his back every so often.\n\nMARKELL (looking over his left shoulder): I think I saw these fools that Pete \nand I got beef with.\n\nMarkell turns to notice that Justice is not in the passenger seat. Justice leans \nup from the back seat to kiss his cheek and tenderly run\nher fingers around Markell's neck and shoulder. We notice her long fingernails. \nMarkell laughs and places the popcorn on the\ndashboard. Our attention is drawn to the passenger window, where the drive-in \nspeaker hangs. Romantic movie music flows into the\ncar. On the driver's side the window is open. Suddenly, a pistol is placed next \nto Markell's head. Time slows down. The gun is fired.\nJustice screams. The popcorn scatters, and the passenger window breaks from the \ntraveling bullet. Time resumes. Justice's screams\nturn to a whimper. There is blood on her hands. The drive-in speaker has now \nfallen on the passenger seat. We hear the romantic\nmovie playing in the background.\n\nOVERHEAD As we PULL UP and away from the car. There are people running and \nscreaming in every direction, and cars are leaving.\nThese sounds overlap into TITLE CARD: POETIC JUSTICE: The sun rises behind the \nlogo.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: 6 INT INGLEWOOD CEMETERY-DAY Where we come out of the leaves of a \ntree to see a garden of stones,\nconcrete symbols of souls long past. There is one lone figure standing before a \ngrave. We recognize this person as Justice. We also\nhear Justice speak in voice over. Over the following images she recites the \nfirst of many poems that move this story forward. BURN\n17V: Two YEARS LATER\n\nJUSTICE (V:O.): \"Alone. Lying, thinking. Last night.

No nobody. Can make it out here alone.\nAlone, all alone. Nobody, but nobody. Can make it out here alone. Now if you \nlisten closely, I'11 tell you what I know.

She uses her automatic lock \nsystem, which sounds off \"armed\" when it\nlocks.

Justice walks past them without acknowledging their condition.\n\n15 INT. JESSIE'S BEAUTYSALONAND SUPPLY--DAY Hair, nails, curlers, and combs. A \nwoman picks up a phone and says,\n\"Jessie's Beauty Salon and Supply. \" We have invaded this place on Friday, the \nbusiest day of the week. We see many women of\nvarious ages, shapes, and sizes receiving hair care from different stylists. No \ntwo heads are the same. Our attention and ears are drawn\nto the loud voice of one young woman who sits on the waiting couch flipping \nthrough a Black hair magazine. She has short-cut hair\nand eyes, nails, and temper of a Siamese cat. This is lesha.\n\nShe is talking to Heywood, who is a spiritual person. He is so cosmic that his \nsexuality is often questioned. Nearby at another booth is\nDexter, another male stylist who is very straight. His dick has guided him into \nthe world of cosmetology.\n\nHEYWOOD (over images of nails, hair, etc.): I know whatcha mean. I don't \nunderstand some of these women. I don't see how they\ncan allow themselves to be so disrespected! My body is my temple! And a temple \nshould never be defiled. Especially not in this case. I\nlove myself.\n\nDexter shakes his head in shame at Heywood. He is massaging the head of one \nfine-ass sistah. She smiles. Dexter suavely bends down\nand says, \"You like that don 't cha. \"She nods in approval.\n\nIESHA: Yeah, well, he just did my girl all wrong. She's as 'fraid as a cat.

Start this shot off with a fine-ass \nsistah with a baby in hand walking over to the crib.\n\nTHE DOORWAY Where we see a little boy about twelve years old standing in the \nmiddle of these children. This is Baha, the errand\nboy of the shop. Baba sits playing a Sega Game Gear, looking up from time to \ntime out the window and at the fine women that pass\nby. Some of the older children attempt to distract him from his game.\n\nBAHA: Stop! Quit! (looking out the window, then goes to the doorway) Here she \ncomes!\n\nTHE SALON Where all the stylists and customers turn. They know what that means.\n\n17 EXT JESSLE'S SALON--DAY We see a hand with keys in the frame. The owner of \nthese keys presses a button, which turns on\nthe car alarm. The license on her car reads Ms. BOOTE. At leg level we swing \naround to walk toward the salon. In front of the door\nstands a Panhandler with a sign in hand.\n\nPANHANDLER: Good morning, Jessie.

What y'all doing?\n\nLLOYD: Looking for a nigga to jack.\n\nIn his lap we see a gun.\n\nLUCKY: Ya'll need to jack that cracka Larryl Gates.\n\nBACKSEAT GANGSTA: Who's that?\n\nEverybody just turns and looks at him. Ne shrinks back into the back seat.\n\nLLOYD: Yeah we gonna jack him too. Goin up to City Hall later today... ... \nRemember Lerek?\n\nLUCKY: Yeah. He live over there. (points)\n\nLLOYD: Not no more. Got his ass caped out yesterday.... We gonna get tha niggas \nthat got him.\n\nLucky nods.\n\nLUCKY: Well, later.\n\nLLOYD: All right. Peace.\n\nLloyd smiles ironically.\n\nLUCKY: Yeah, peace.\n\nThey drive off. Lucky turns and walks into tha projects\n\n28 EXT. J-BONE'SPORCH-DAy Lucky walks up to a porch where we see a tall, \nslender, light-brown brother wearing no shirt and\nsmoking ajoint. This is J-Bone, Lucky's old friend. So close are they that they \nhave children by the same woman. J-Bone is standing on\nhis porch enjoying the afternoon sun and a cool Santa Ana breeze. We hear a jet \nfly overhead. We hear a fly-ass beat flowing from\nsomeone's apartment window.\n\nJ-BONE (Greeting): Mr. Postman! Working muthafucka!\n\nLUCKY: Don't start! Whatsup, J-Bone.\n\nJ-BONE: Want some Thai bud?\n\nLUCKY: Naw. Can't fuck wit that.\n\nThey pause for a moment. J-Bone's attention has wandered across the way.\n\nACROSS THE WAY We see an Old Woman toiling in her garden. In the projects older \nfolk respect their small spaces by making them\nas comfortable as possible. Some playing children run through this shot.\n\nBACK TO PORCH\n\nJ-BONE: Hi, Ms. Jackson. ... She hate my ass.\n\nMS. JACKSON Looks up toward J-Bone. Her face does not register the slightest \nhint of a positive response to J-Bone's greeting. In\nfact it says, ,,Go to hell. \" Ms. Jackson tells one of the kids, a young boy, to \ngo inside. Upset and reluctant, the boy complies with his\ngrandmother's wishes.\n\nTHE PORCH\n\nLUCKY: Heard 'bout Derek.\n\nJ-BONE: Yeah, Derek. D-Dog! Crazy muthafucka, huh? Ain't that about a bitch? \n(reminiscing) ... Anyway, so you here to check on\nKeisha, huh?\n\nThey start walking.\n\nLUCKY: Yeah, I'ma give Angel some money to buy her some clothes.\n\nJ-BONE: Awww, muthafucka, you don't need to do that. I'11 get her some clothes. \nTake her to the Slauson Swap Meet, Fox Hills\nMall, get her what ever she need.\n\nLUCKY: Naw, you don't need to do that.\n\nA crack addict walks toward J-Bone. He makes a quick transaction.\n\nJ-BONE: Ain't no thang.... It ain't like I ain't got the money. Besides, she \ncall me Daddy sometimes anyway.\n\nJ-Bone walks on ahead. Lucky seems a little miffed. They walk upstairs to \nAngel's apartment.\n\nINT. ANGEL'S PLACE--DAY Where Lucky and J-Bone enter. There are two small \nchildren on the floor watching television. One is a\ngirl, the other a boy. The girl is six years old, and the boy is four. This is \nKeisha and Antonio. On the screen are afternoon cartoons.\n\nLUCKY: What you mean she call you Daddy?\n\nJ-BONE: Just what I said.\n\nLUCKY (gestures to his child): Hey, little girl!\n\nKeisha runs up into her daddy's arms.\n\nLUCKY: Who's your daddy?\n\nKeisha timidly points to Lucky, who smiles and looks at J-Bone.\n\nLUCKY: That's your son, this my daughter. Don't you be forgetting.\n\nJ-BONE: Well, I'm her second daddy, since they came from the same hooka.\n\nAs if on cue and \"on cue\" we see a young woman of about twenty-two enter the \nroom. Her face looks like that of someone who is\nentering the threes of what will be a hard life. Despite this, she retains a \nbeautiful but very uninnocent look. This is Angel.\n\nANGEL: What y'all two fools talking 'bout?\n\nLUCKY: Talking 'bout your yamp ass. (takes a drink, then takes a second look at \nher)\n\nWe notice the unusual color of her lipstick and her nervous twitching. Angel \nbegins rearranging things on her already-cluttered-up\ncoffee table.\n\nLUCKY: What you cleaning up for? Place look fucked up! Normal! ... You ain't \nbeen basing, is you? (to J-Bone) Has she?\n\nJ-Bone doesn't say anything.\n\nANGEL: No, I ain't, and neither one of y'all is my husband, so y'all can't tell \nme shit. (darts back toward the bedroom)\n\nANGEL 5 P.O.V.: MOVING BACK AWAY FROM LUCKY\n\nLUCKY: You know what I told ya ass bout that!\n\nThe bedroom door is slammed shut. Lucky lets his little girl out of his lap and \nloose.\n\nLUCKY: Told her if she start doing that shit, I'm gonna take Keisha to live with \nmy momma.\n\nJ-BONE: (looking at cartoons) She all right, Lucky. Believe me, I'd know.\n\nLUCKY: Yeah. (takes a swig, then places his forty on the table) I gotta stop \ndrinking this shit. Fuckin wit my brain.\n\nFrom outside someone calls J-Bone. He reluctantly leaves the cartoons to sell \nsome more crack. Lucky starts to take notice of all the\nclutter on the coffee table. Downstairs, J-Bone makes a transaction. We see a \npiece of a crack pipe under the hair of a Black baby doll.\nThis catches Lucky's attention. Lucky picks it up and notices Angel's lipstick \nis on its tip. He looks from J-Bone outside toward the\nbedroom. Then he gets up and walks in that direction.\n\n29A INII: ANGELSSLAACE-DAY THE BEDROOM Where we see Lucky opening the door. \nInside Angel is just covering herself up\nafter being with a gangsta. Lucky closes the door.\n\nIDEA. Start shot of Lucky opening the door then PAN OVER to reveal Angel and the \nGangsta surprised then PAN back to Lucky's\nreaction and he CLOSES the door.\n\n29B INT. ANGEL'S PLACE--DAY THE HALLWAY As Lucky takes a moment to think. He \nwalks off.\n\nTHE LIVING ROOM Lucky picks up Keisha\n\nLUCKY: C'mon, we gonna go see Grandma. Your momma tripping.\n\nSuddenly, Angel bursts from the bedroom, cursing and talking shit.\n\nANGEL: Who the fuck you think you is? You don't tell me what the fuck I can do! \nWho the fuck I can see!\n\n29C EXT. ANGEL'S PLACE--DAY OVERHEAD Outside, downstairs, J-Bone begins to take \nnotice of the storm brewing in the\napartment. He looks up toward the noise.\n\n290 ANOTHER ANGLE: ON CRANE Where J-Bone runs around and up the stairs as we \nCRANE UP with him and past the front of\nthe apartment to see Lucky and Angel, perfectly framed in a window, arguing up a \nstorm.\n\nINT. ANGELSSPLACE-DAY BACK TO LIVING ROOM As Lucky and Angel go at it. Lucky has \nKeisha in hand. J-Bone enters the\napartment and comes in between the two of them.\n\nLUCKY: Fuck you, bitch! How you gonna be fucking some nigga while my little girl \naround here?! (to the guy) What you looking at\nnigga?\n\nGANGSTA #1: Hey, Bone, you better tell this muthafucka to get outta ma face \nbefore I get my strap!\n\nJ-BONE: Lucky! Lucky, calm down, G!\n\nLUCKY: Naw, fuck her yamp ass!\n\nGANGSTA #1: Who is this muthafucka?\n\nLucky throws the Gangsta a funny look. Then, breaking the first rule of the \nstreet, he turns his back on him to continue arguing with\nAngel.\n\nGANGSTA #1: What you looking at, punk? Mark ass, nigga!\n\nGangsta #1 sucka-punches Lucky. And they both start a big fight in the middle of \nthe small apartment. J-Bone joins the fight, on\nLucky's side.\n\nJ-BONE: Hey, hey!\n\nLucky and J-Bone kick his ass. Tha Gangsta is out cold. From the fire and light \nin Lucky's eyes, we can see shades of his previous\nlife. He and J-Bone stand back to admire their handiwork. Outside we can see a \ncrowd has gathered from the noise.\n\nLUCKY: Aw, shit! Ijust got offa work. I don't need this shit. C'mon, Keisha. \nLater, Bone.\n\nLucky walks off, daughter in hand.\n\n30 EXT. ANGELS PLACE--DAY As Lucky, daughter in hand, quickly emerges. Behind \nhim Angel throws a verbal arsenal of dirty\ninsults and threats such as \"Fuck you, niggs!\" \"You don't make no money, \nanyway!\" \"How you know she your baby?\" etc. As Lucky\nwalks, we lower Angel's voice and hear another one of Justice's poems. JUSTICE \n(V.O.): \"In a time of secret wooing today prepares\ntomorrow's ruin. Left knows not what right is doing. My heart is torn asunder. \nIn a time of furtive sighs. Sweet hellos and sad\ngoodbyes. Half truths told and entire lies. My conscience echoes thunder.\"\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. JESSIE'S SALON--LATE AFTERNOON\n\nAs we see Justice standing over her notebook reading a poem to lesha while \nputting the finishing touches on her head. The salon is\nnearly empty. Jessie is sitting at the counter. Heywood is on the phone.\n\nJUSTICE: \"In a time when kingdoms come. Joy is brief as summer's fun. Happiness, \nits race has run. Then pain stalks in to plunder.\"\n(closes the notebook) So what you think?\n\nIESHA: It's pretty. What you call it?\n\nJUSTICE: \"In a Time.\"\n\nlesha's beeper goes off.\n\nIESHA: (looking at her beeper) Uh-oh, Chicago paging me.\n\nIesha gets out of the chair and goes to the receptionist's phone. Heywood is on \nthe phone. His face is so serious. Jessie quickly points\nlesha in the direction of the pay phone on the wall. lesha sighs and walks that \nway.\n\nJESSIE: You need some change?\n\nIESHA (O.S.): No.\n\nJustice begins cleaning up her station.\n\nTHE COUNTER\n\nWhere Heywood gets off the phone. From the look on his face he has heard some \nterrible news.\n\nJESSIE: What'd they say?\n\nHeywood crosses over to the couch, where he sits with his head down. Jessie goes \nover to console him.\n\nTHE WALL PHONE Where lesha is on the phone with Chicago.\n\nIESHA (with attitude): What you want? Ah, huh. Ah, huh. Yeah, I'm wit it. We got \na hair show to go to up there anyway.\n\nCHICAGO (0.S.): Bring one'o your friends too. A Ane one.\n\nIESHA: What you mean, a Ane one? You trying to say I got ugly friends?\n\nJustice and lesha make eye contact. Both smile. Suddenly in the background on \nJustice, we see and hear police lights converge on\nsome brothers across the street. This catches Justice's attention.\n\nBACK TO COUCH Where Jessie is still consoling Heywood. Behind them out the \nwindow are the police.\n\nJESSIE: What the hell they doing now?! I'm as glad as hell we getting outta here \ntomorrow.\n\nJUSTICE (walks up): What's wrong?\n\nHeywood gets up and walks away. Jessie stands. Justice joins Jessie at the \nwindow. Both stand in profile. Red and blue flashes of light\nflow across their faces. There are people leaving the shop throughout this \nscene.\n\nJESSIE: You got your styles together for tha Oakland Show?\n\nJUSTICE (demure): Yeah. I'ma play with Lisa and Gena's heads. If they like it, \nthey like it. If they don't, they don't.\n\nJESSIE: So you riding with us? You know we got us a little caravan going.\n\nJustice nods. Jessie notices the stress on her face.\n\nJESSIE: Justice. I know I ain't your momma. Hell, I ain't even old enough to be \nthat. But we pretty close, and sometimes we talk like\nsisters. I just gotta tell ya, baby ... you gotta move on. ... A man ain't \nnothin but a tool. You got to know when to take 'em out tha box\nand when to put 'em back in. And if ya lose one--well, you just ...go get \nanother. ... Take a chance, do somethin different for a\nchange. There's always another man somewheres out here. (looks out the window) \nYou gotta know sometimes you gonna lose one.\n(matter offactly) Like a blow dryer or a good brush. What I gotta do? Play Momma \nto everybody in this shop?\n\nJustice thinks, looks down for a moment, then out the window once more. BACK TO \nTHE STALLS Where we see Dexter, Heywood,\nand four other stylists: Marine, Colette, Lisa, and Gena.\n\nDEXTER: Where's my blow dryer! I'm tired of all my shit disappearing alla time!\n\nHEYWOOD (coolly): Calm down. Calm down. Here it is. I borrowed it for a wrap I \nhad to do this morning.\n\nDEXTER: Heywood! Why you always borrowing my shit without asking?!\n\nHEYWOOD: I asked you for it this morning, and you said yes. Why are you crying \nover it like a bitch?\n\nDEXTER: Who you calling a bitch? If anybody's a bitch, you a bitch!\n\nHEYWOOD: Excuse me? You wan some? Maybe you forget I was Golden Gloves. You \ncatchin me on tha wrong muthafuckinday.\n\nMAXINE: All right. All right. Dexter! As much as you talk and you borrow \neverybody else's stuff alla time. (looks over his tools) Like\nmy brush right here.\n\nMaxine walks away. As she does, we notice the round beautiful fullness of her \nbootay. Her hair is dyed blood red.\n\nDEXTER: I was gonna give it to ya, Maxine, I just got distracted. Mmm-mmm.\n\nHEYWOOD: Shit, I was wrestlin champ at Crenshaw High School.\n\nJUSTICES STALL Where she and lesha meet up once more. Iesha begins playing with \nher new braids in tha mirror.\n\nJUSTICE: So what your new man talking bout?\n\nIESHA: He want me to go onna run with 'em. (starts scrutinizing her hair) This \nis good now. I don't haveta be messing around with it.\nJust walk out tha house--ya know.\n\nJUSTICE: Yeah. What's a run?\n\nIESHA: Oh, you know what a run is.\n\nIesha keeps fixing her hair. It is apparent that she is luring Justice's \ncuriosity. Justice takes the bait.\n\nJUSTICE (pulls lesha's hand away from her head): No, I don't. And stop messing \nwith it. What's a run? He ain't no slanger is he?\n\nIESHA: A run ... is, well, it's like this. You really wanna know?\n\nJustice gives her a frustrated look.\n\nIESHA: Well, you know my boyfriend Chicago, right?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n32 EXT THE POST OFFICE--DUSK Where we see Chicago point at a truck and sign a \nrec order. \"That one,\" he says. He is brushing\nhis head with a flat brush and arguing with an Oriental co-worker.\n\nIESHA (V.O.): You know he work at the post office and all. The one on Century \nand Van Ness. Well, every so often he and his friend\nat work, they have to drive up to Oakland in this mail truck, see.\n\n32A INT. JESSIE'S SALON--DUSK BACK TO SCENE\n\nIESHA: You listening?\n\nJUSTICE (her interest apparently lost): Yeah.\n\nIn the background the other stylists are leaving. A few of them say goodbye to \nJustice before they go. Justice resumes cleaning her\nstation. Her interest in lesha's proposal is lost.\n\nIESHA (attempting to persuade): Well, we get in this mail truck and we drive up \nthe coast, get drunk, eat Mexican food, and just have\na good time. It's fun! (seeing no effect) You ain't having it, huh?\n\nJUSTICE: No, I'm not. That is too to the curb. How am I gonna look like riding \nin some mail truck? What you doing seeing some\nmailman, anyway? You know they don't make no money! What he gonna do for you? \nMail your bills for free?!\n\nIesha folds her arms in defiance of Justice's comments.\n\nIESHA: (frustrated with Justice) How come you don't ever wanna have no fun no \nmore? Girl, the world is just one big place waitin for\nus to go out and fuck up in it. You gonna end up being a straight spinster.\n\nWe see Justice's face. She is definitely looking more hardened. Iesha pulls a \nwad of money out of her pocket and gives it to Justice.\n\nIESHA (walking out): Later. Thanks. You a Straight Buster!\n\nJessie comes up.\n\nJESSIE: What she all mad about?\n\nJUSTICE: Nuthin.\n\nWe hear on the salon's radio the beginning of \"What You See, Is What You Get!\"\n\nJESSIE: Listen, meet us at my place at eight o'clock tomorrow. Come on, let's \nclose up.\n\nWe PAN over to reveal Heywood dancing. He goes over to Jessie, and they start to \ndance. Justice is left standing alone.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: 33 EXT JESSIE'S SALON--DUSK As we see Justice, Jessie, and Heywood \nclose the shop. Justice pulls the iron gate\nclosed and secures its front. Jessie locks the locks. A car cruises by, and we \nhear some bumping sounds of hip-hop music coming\nfrom the inside speakers as well as the voices of some brothers shouting out \ncompliments to these two beautiful sistahs. We also hear\nHeywood go on about how he loves himself, how life is beautiful. He tells \nJustice, \"See, that's your problem, Justice. You don't love\nyourself. \"\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n34 INT. Justice's Home--NIGHT It looks though it was decorated by her \ngrandmother, which in fact it was. We notice a portrait of an\nelderly woman with similar features as Justice. There are also more than a few \nclocks around, one grandfather clock and a large\ntwenty-four-hour sandclock are prominent. Justice has nothing but time on her \nhands. The air is full of ticking mingled with the sound\nof the outside streets. We dissolve through these images and slide into ...\n\n35 INT. BATHROOM-NIGHT We START outside the doorwity and SLOWLY MOVE IN, \ninvading Justice's privacy. Justice is busy\nrolling her hair in the mirror. She is alone. She looks at her face in the \nmirror. She is a mess. She lets her mind wander as she looks at\nthe cold tile floor. Suddenly, Justice thinks she hears something. PAN from \nmirror to her face as she hears the sound.\n\n36 INT.HALLLWAY--NIGHT Where Justice quietly stalks. She is nervous as hell. The \nsounds of the clocks become more prominent\nas she moves forward. Justice's P.O.V. moving forward, as she walks down the \nstairs.\n\nTHE DOORWAY Where Justice stands. Someone is on the other side. We hear a slight \nscratch, then silence. Quiet tension. This is\nbroken up by the sound of a friendly meow. Justice opens the door, and a big \nwhite cat enters.\n\nJUSTICE: White Boy! C'mere.\n\nShe picks him up. Pets him, then he pulls away with a screech and runs \noffscreen.\n\n36 CONTINUED JUSTICE: Yeah, you just like a boy. I should have you fixed.\n\nTHE LIVING ROOM Where Justice picks up the remote control to turn on the \ntelevision. On the screen is Bet's Midnight Love. There\nis a montage of romantic R&B videos. A flash of static and we ...\n\nCUT TO: 37 INT. IESHA 'S APARTMENT-NIGHT We see lesha and Chicago do a smooth, \nclose, sexy Ragamuffln dance. We hear\nsome Ragamuffin music in the background.\n\n37A INT.: JUTICE'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT BACK TO JUSTICE Justice seems \ndissatisfied. She turns the television off. Across the\nroom we see Justice sitting at the piano. She looks bored. CLOSE On the piano \nkeys as Justice presses a low-note key. The sound\ntranscends us into the next scene.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: 38 INT.: JUSTICE'SLIVlNG ROOM--NIGHT As we see Justice looking \nthrough a collection of 45 records.

JUSTICE'SHOME-NIGHT HACK INSIDE Justice stops dancing, candy bar in her \nmouth. She looks around for a moment\nand then into a mirror. Everything seems hue, then out of nowhere she bursts \ninto tears. She cries a few tears for a few seconds, then\nwipes them away.\n\nTHE TELEPHONE Justice picks up the receiver and enters some digits.\n\n39 INT. IESHAS APARTMENT-NIGHT We see a pair of lips that turn out to be a \ntelephone as lesha picks up the receiver, and we\nfollow it to reveal her and Chicago in bed together, Iesha lies on her stomach \nwith Chicago on top. Tha skins are deftnitely on. Chicago\nis wearing nothing except it Chicago Bulls fisherman's cap. Ragamuffin music is \nplaying in the background mon.\n\nIESHA: Who dis? Oh, what's up, girl?

JUSTICE'SLIVING ROOM--NIGHT Where she sits. Her eyes wander around the \nroom and then rest on her cat across the\nway. The cat looks back at her, then turns around and walks away into the \nhallway. Justice shakes her head. Then her eyes settle on\nsomething else.\n\nTHE COFFEE TABLE Where we move up on her notebook.\n\nJUSTICE As she wipes a few more tears away and reaches for her notebook.\n\n42 INT. LUCKY'S HOUSE--NIGHT A NOTEBOOK As we see it being opened. Its pages are \nratty. We notice its pages are colored\nwith children's drawings: a family, a dog, a house.\n\nTHE LIVING ROOM Where we see Lucky lying on the couch like a potato watching \ntelevision. In the foreground Keisha lies on the\nfloor drawing in her notebook.\n\nON TELEVISION Is one of those Tom Foo Infomercials. He's that Chinese guy who \nsits on a boat with a lot of pretty women (ah\nwhite) and says, \"You can be rich too. \" We can't tell if Lucky is looking at \nthis or is lost in his own thoughts. He mumbles a rhyme\nabout Black business versus Korean exploitation.\n\nKEISHA As she looks at the screen. We hear a helicopter go overhead as its \nspotlight flows into the room. Keisha reacts to it with\nindifference and continues to draw. Lucky calmly cuts his eyes in that \ndirection. The Light gets his attention and prompts him to get up\nand make a phone call.\n\nLUCKY: Operator? Yeah, give me Oakland, please. Area code 415.\n\n42B INT. COUSIN KALIL'S SOUND LAB: OAKWVD-NIGHT Where we travel past a ringing \nphone and some sound equipment to\nreveal a picture of a young man. Our attention settles on his eyes.

There is some question as to which end of the telephone \nthe shots came from.\n\nCLOSE On Lucky's face. He looks up in the direction of the gunshots and down on \nthe floor.\n\nTHE FLOOR: LUCKY'S P.O. V: Where Keisha is rolled up in a ball.\n\nLUCKY (hanging up phone): Go to bed.\n\nKeisha gets up and goes toward the bedroom. Lucky looks at her exit, then goes \ntoward the window and looks outside the blinds. On\nthe TV in the background is the Life Alert commercial, 'i've fallen and I can't \nget up.\" We see Lucky through the blinds in the\nforeground and the TV in the background.\n\nTHE DOORWAY Where a woman enters. She is a short, medium-size woman, with a \npretty but hardened face. The light in her eyes\nsays she still has some humor left. This is Annie, Lucky's mother. She has a bag \nof groceries in hand.\n\nLUCKY: Hi, Momma! Need some help?\n\nANNIE: Just like you to offer help when I only got one bag. ... So are you going \nup north to see Kalil this weekend?\n\nLUCKY: Yeah, look like we finally gonna get this music thing going.

We\nhear her thoughts as she looks out onto the ocean.\n\nJUSTICE (V.O.): A wise man once said, you should look at the ocean and realize \nthat no matter how famous you are, or how much\nmoney you make, you should know that you will never be as important as the \nocean. ...

Chicago looks\nover at her sleeping.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: I 02 EXII: AFRICAN MARKET FESTNAGDAY We see images of dancers on a \nstage, people shopping at booths,\ncarnival games. The air is alive with the sounds and smells of an African market \nfestival. What follows is a FelLiniesque scene on the\nAfrocentric tip. The sounds of African drums fill the air. Between the dialogue \nsome striking visuals are intercut.\n\nANGLE As we see Justice and Lucky walking together. Justice is taking in the \nsights and sounds of her environment.

Chicago then turns to look in Lucky and\nJustice's direction.\n\nLUCKY AND JUSTICE They are interrupted by Chicago's shouting.\n\nCHICAGO (shouting): Why do we keep stopping? Don't we have a schedule to keep \nto?\n\nLUCKY (shouting): We got plenty o' time. What you worried about, nigga? We \nalways do this.\n\nCHICAGO: We need to hurry up and get where we got to go.

All that is left is the\nseed, which Justice holds up proudly. She laughs.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: 104 EXTGRASSYFlELD-DAY We see Justice walking toward us through a \nfield. She walks slowly, almost\ndreamlike. Over this we hear Justice's voice reading a poem. It is \"Phenomenal \nWoman. \"Suddenly, a zebra (yes a zebra) walks into the\nshot. First one, then another, then another. Soon there is a herd. Now we know \nwe are in a dream--Until we hear Lucky's voice shout\nout.\n\nLUCKY: Whatcha you doing?!\n\nWIDE Where we see the truck at the top ofa hill that overlooks a field, in which \nwe see Justice walking among African zebras.\nChicago and Iesha get out of the truck and look down.

She senses she is being watched, then she looks over at \nhim and walks away. He follows her.\n\nTHE ROAD Where we see the truck by the road with the castle in the background. \nlesha has walked to the back of the truck. Chicago\ncomes around the corner and tries to talk to her.\n\nHe tries a smoother approach.\n\nCHICAGO (smoothly): So you wanna quit me, huh?\n\nHe puts his arms around her waist.\n\nCHIAGO: Don't you know how much I love you? Can I have a kiss?\n\nShe turns around to face him, and they kiss.\n\nCUT TO: 105 INT. THE TRUCK: MOVING--DAY Where Chicago and Iesha are still \nkissing. They are getting hot and heavy.

In the distance we see Chicago and Iesha arguing.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE As we see Iesha and Chicago squabble. We cannot hear them shouting \nat each other over the loud ocean waves\ncrashing among the rocks below the cliff. The wind is blowing with a strong \nforce.\n\nTHE TRUCK Where Lucky and Justice sit. Justice is watching. Lucky minds his own \nbusiness. He glances at his nails.\n\nTHE ROCKS Where we see the waves crashing against the side of the cliff, eroding \nits sides bit by bit. We juxtapose images of the\nwaves to the ballet of lesha and Chicago arguing. He pulls at her. She pulls \naway, etc. Their dialogue is drowned out by the sounds of\nthe raging ocean. Iesha gets fed up and walks toward the truck.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE As we come down and follow Iesha. We can fully hear them arguing \nnow.\n\nIESHA: You weak! You a weak-ass punk! Just 'cause work out don't mean shit! \nThink you buff! I wish I never met your sorry ass!\nSorry muthafucka!\n\nChicago takes his brush out of his back pocket and begins brushing his head.

Watcha do, take steroids?!\n\nWe see Iesha's mouth in CLOSE UP. She continues to lay on the insults as we SLOW \nDOWN TIME. Chicago continues to brush his\nhead. He concentrates on looking at Iesha's mouth running a mile a minute.\n\nREAL TIME\n\nIESHA: That's why I'm fucking somebody else!\n\nThis catches Chicago's attention. He stops brushing his head, and calmly walks \ntoward Iesha, as we PULL BACK with him to an\nover-the-shoulder with Iesha.\n\nJUSTICE Is wondering what will happen next.\n\nCLOSE.

IESHA GOES \nMUTHAFUCKING CRAZY!!!\n\nIESHA: (shou ting and echoing) Muthafucka!!!!\n\nIesha charges toward Chicago with fury. Hell hath no fury like a Black woman s \nscorn. Iesha and Chicago fight. Each is cursing at the\nother. To our surprise this is no one-sided battle: Iesha is holding her own. \nShe hits Chicago square on the chin with a wild punch.\nChicago reels back in shock and continues fighting.\n\nJustice is going crazy. She doesn 't know what to do.\n\nJUSTICE (to Lucky): You just gonna let 'em fight?!\n\nLUCKY: That ain't my business.\n\nWild with frustration, Justice gets out of the truck and walks toward the \nfighting couple. Lucky gets outta the truck.\n\nCHICAGO AND IESHA The tide has turned on the fight--Chicago is kicking Iesha's \nass now. She swings a wild punch, and he\nconnects with a direct hit. Chicago drops back to get his bearings. We see \nJustice come up in the background. Boom! A foot slams\nbetween Chicago's legs. Chicago grabs his crotch in pain. He slowly turns, then \ncharges Justice. They tumble on the ground, and he\nreels back to hit her.\n\nLUCKY (O.S.): Hey!\n\nANGLE On Lucky, who walks toward us with anger.\n\nLUCKY: What tha fuck is wrong with you, nigga?!

You all right?\n\nJustice murmurs a \"yes\" and walks over to attend to Iesha. Lucky is left \nstanding alone. He thinks.\n\nJUSTICE AND LESHA Where Justice helps her friend up Iesha is scratched. She \ncontinues to curse with a bloodied mouth. Iesha\npulls away, attempting to continue fighting, only to be restrained by Justice.\n\nIESHA (crying): Fuck that muthafucka! He getting jacked! I'ma, I'ma call Dooby, \nI'ma call Monster Loci They gonna shoot that nigga.\nHe ain't nobody's daddy!\n\nLucky looks over at Iesha. He doesn't notice Chicago getting up and charging \nhim.

ANOTHER ANGLE As we \nsee Justice come forward and drop down to sit\nnext to Lucky. There is a pause. Neither one of them saiys anything. All we can \nhear is the sounds of the ocean and the sea gulls.\nJustice attempts to break the ice.\n\nJUSTICE (laughs): They was gonna break up anywag. (reminiscing) I remember when \nI was little and my uncle Leon used to come\naround and give me and my cousins change. He would go to the liquor store, buy a \nforty-ounce of beer, then throw us the change.\nAnd I'd always ask for the \"big nickel.\" I couldn't pronounce quarter, so that's \nwhat I'd call it. (to Lucky) Yuk, look at them nails. Give\nme your hand.\n\nLucky gives her his hand. Justice looks in her pocket and produces a nail file. \nShe begins to file Lucky's nails. Lucky shows his\ndiscomfort.\n\nJUSTICE: Anyway, so because of that my grandmother used to say I was always \nlooking for the big nickel. Anything I did- ride a\nbike, go to school, do somebody's hair--she'd say \"Justice! You still looking \nfor that big nickel?\" That was before she died.\n\nLucky looks at the concern on her face.\n\nLUCKY: When she die?\n\nJUSTICE: About two years ago. She left me her house. My mother died when I was \ntwelve. Suicide. She named me Justice cause she\nwas in law school when she got pregnant with me. ... I'm all alone.
