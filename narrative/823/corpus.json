Athenian nobleman Glaucus arrives in the bustling and gaudy Roman town and quickly falls in love with the beautiful Greek Ione. Ione's former guardian, the malevolent Egyptian sorcerer Arbaces, has designs on Ione and sets out to destroy their budding happiness. Arbaces has already ruined Ione's sensitive brother Apaecides by luring him to join the vice-ridden priesthood of Isis.\nThe blind slave Nydia is rescued from her abusive owners by Glaucus, for whom she secretly pines. Arbaces horrifies Ione by declaring his love for her, and flying into a rage when she refuses him. Glaucus and Apaecides rescue her from his grip, but Arbaces is struck down by an earthquake, a sign of Vesuvius' coming eruption.\nGlaucus and Ione exult in their love, much to Nydia's torment, while Apaecides finds a new religion in Christianity.\nNydia unwittingly helps Julia, a rich young woman who has eyes for Glaucus, obtain a love potion from Arbaces to win Glaucus's love. But the love potion is really a poison that will turn Glaucus mad. Nydia steals the potion and administers it; Glaucus drinks only a small amount and begins raving wildly.\nApaecides and Olinthus, an early Christian, determine to publicly reveal the deception of the cult of Isis. Arbaces, recovered from his wounds, overhears and stabs Apaecides to death; he then pins the crime on Glaucus, who has stumbled onto the scene.\nArbaces has himself declared the legal guardian of Ione, who is convinced that Arbaces is her brother's murderer, and imprisons her at his mansion. He also imprisons Nydia, who discovers that there is an eyewitness to the murder who can prove Glaucus's innocence \u2013 the priest Calenus, who is yet a third prisoner of Arbaces. She smuggles a letter to Glaucus's friend Sallust, begging him to rescue them.\nGlaucus is convicted of murder, Olinthus of heresy, and their sentence is to be fed to wild cats in the amphitheater. All Pompeii gathers in the amphitheater for the bloody gladiatorial games. Just as Glaucus is led into the arena with the lion \u2013 who, by a miracle, spares his life and returns to his cage \u2013 Sallust bursts into the arena and reveals Arbaces' plot. The crowd demands that Arbaces be thrown to the lion, but it is too late: Vesuvius begins to erupt. Ash and stone rain down, causing mass panic.\nArbaces grabs Ione in the chaos but is killed by a lightning strike. Nydia leads Glaucus, Sallust, and Ione to safety on a ship in the Bay of Naples. The next morning she commits suicide by quietly slipping into the sea; death is preferable to the agony of her unrequited love for Glaucus.\nTen years pass, and Glaucus writes to Sallust, now living in Rome, of his and Ione's happiness in Athens. They have built Nydia a tomb and adopted Christianity.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Last Days of Pompeii, by Edward George Bulwer-Lytton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Do you sup with Glaucus to-night?' said a young\nman of small stature, who wore his tunic in those loose and effeminate\nfolds which proved him to be a gentleman and a coxcomb.\n\n'Alas, no! dear Clodius; he has not invited me,' replied Diomed, a man\nof portly frame and of middle age.  'By Pollux, a scurvy trick! for they\nsay his suppers are the best in Pompeii'.\n\n'Pretty well--though there is never enough of wine for me.  It is not\nthe old Greek blood that flows in his veins, for he pretends that wine\nmakes him dull the next morning.'\n\n'There may be another reason for that thrift,' said Diomed, raising his\nbrows.  'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, I\nfancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphorae\nbetter than his wit.'\n\n'An additional reason for supping with him while the sesterces last.\nNext year, Diomed, we must find another Glaucus.'\n\n'He is fond of the dice, too, I hear.'\n\n'He is fond of every pleasure; and while he likes the pleasure of giving\nsuppers, we are all fond of him.'\n\n'Ha, ha, Clodius, that is well said!  Have you ever seen my wine-cellars,\nby-the-by?'\n\n'I think not, my good Diomed.'\n\n'Well, you must sup with me some evening; I have tolerable muraenae in\nmy reservoir, and I ask Pansa the aedile to meet you.'\n\n'O, no state with me!--Persicos odi apparatus, I am easily contented.\nWell, the day wanes; I am for the baths--and you...'\n\n'To the quaestor--business of state--afterwards to the temple of Isis.\nVale!'\n\n'An ostentatious, bustling, ill-bred fellow,' muttered Clodius to\nhimself, as he sauntered slowly away.  'He thinks with his feasts and\nhis wine-cellars to make us forget that he is the son of a freedman--and\nso we will, when we do him the honour of winning his money; these rich\nplebeians are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles.'\n\nThus soliloquising, Clodius arrived in the Via Domitiana, which was\ncrowded with passengers and chariots, and exhibited all that gay and\nanimated exuberance of life and motion which we find at this day in the\nstreets of Naples.\n\nThe bells of the cars as they rapidly glided by each other jingled\nmerrily on the ear, and Clodius with smiles or nods claimed familiar\nacquaintance with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic: in\nfact, no idler was better known in Pompeii.\n\n'What, Clodius! and how have you slept on your good fortune?' cried, in\na pleasant and musical voice, a young man, in a chariot of the most\nfastidious and graceful fashion.  Upon its surface of bronze were\nelaborately wrought, in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece,\nreliefs of the Olympian games; the two horses that drew the car were of\nthe rarest breed of Parthia; their slender limbs seemed to disdain the\nground and court the air, and yet at the slightest touch of the\ncharioteer, who stood behind the young owner of the equipage, they\npaused motionless, as if suddenly transformed into stone--lifeless, but\nlifelike, as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles. The owner\nhimself was of that slender and beautiful symmetry from which the\nsculptors of Athens drew their models; his Grecian origin betrayed\nitself in his light but clustering locks, and the perfect harmony of his\nfeatures.  He wore no toga, which in the time of the emperors had indeed\nceased to be the general distinction of the Romans, and was especially\nridiculed by the pretenders to fashion; but his tunic glowed in the\nrichest hues of the Tyrian dye, and the fibulae, or buckles, by which it\nwas fastened, sparkled with emeralds: around his neck was a chain of\ngold, which in the middle of his breast twisted itself into the form of\na serpent's head, from the mouth of which hung pendent a large signet\nring of elaborate and most exquisite workmanship; the sleeves of the\ntunic were loose, and fringed at the hand with gold: and across the\nwaist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs, and of the same material as\nthe fringe, served in lieu of pockets for the receptacle of the\nhandkerchief and the purse, the stilus and the tablets.\n\n'My dear Glaucus!' said Clodius, 'I rejoice to see that your losses have\nso little affected your mien.  Why, you seem as if you had been inspired\nby Apollo, and your face shines with happiness like a glory; any one\nmight take you for the winner, and me for the loser.'\n\n'And what is there in the loss or gain of those dull pieces of metal\nthat should change our spirit, my Clodius?  By Venus, while yet young,\nwe can cover our full locks with chaplets--while yet the cithara sounds\non unsated ears--while yet the smile of Lydia or of Chloe flashes over\nour veins in which the blood runs so swiftly, so long shall we find\ndelight in the sunny air, and make bald time itself but the treasurer of\nour joys.  You sup with me to-night, you know.'\n\n'Who ever forgets the invitation of Glaucus!'\n\n'But which way go you now?'\n\n'Why, I thought of visiting the baths: but it wants yet an hour to the\nusual time.'\n\n'Well, I will dismiss my chariot, and go with you.  So, so, my Phylias,'\nstroking the horse nearest to him, which by a low neigh and with\nbackward ears playfully acknowledged the courtesy: 'a holiday for you\nto-day.  Is he not handsome, Clodius?'\n\n'Worthy of Phoebus,' returned the noble parasite--'or of Glaucus.'\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nTHE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL, AND THE BEAUTY OF FASHION.  THE ATHENIAN'S\nCONFESSION.  THE READER'S INTRODUCTION TO ARBACES OF EGYPT.\n\nTALKING lightly on a thousand matters, the two young men sauntered\nthrough the streets; they were now in that quarter which was filled with\nthe gayest shops, their open interiors all and each radiant with the\ngaudy yet harmonious colors of frescoes, inconceivably varied in fancy\nand design. The sparkling fountains, that at every vista threw upwards\ntheir grateful spray in the summer air; the crowd of passengers, or\nrather loiterers, mostly clad in robes of the Tyrian dye; the gay groups\ncollected round each more attractive shop; the slaves passing to and fro\nwith buckets of bronze, cast in the most graceful shapes, and borne upon\ntheir heads; the country girls stationed at frequent intervals with\nbaskets of blushing fruit, and flowers more alluring to the ancient\nItalians than to their descendants (with whom, indeed, \"latet anguis in\nherba,\" a disease seems lurking in every violet and rose); the numerous\nhaunts which fulfilled with that idle people the office of cafes and\nclubs at this day; the shops, where on shelves of marble were ranged the\nvases of wine and oil, and before whose thresholds, seats, protected\nfrom the sun by a purple awning, invited the weary to rest and the\nindolent to lounge--made a scene of such glowing and vivacious\nexcitement, as might well give the Athenian spirit of Glaucus an excuse\nfor its susceptibility to joy.\n\n'Talk to me no more of Rome,' said he to Clodius.  'Pleasure is too\nstately and ponderous in those mighty walls: even in the precincts of\nthe court--even in the Golden House of Nero, and the incipient glories\nof the palace of Titus, there is a certain dulness of magnificence--the\neye aches--the spirit is wearied; besides, my Clodius, we are\ndiscontented when we compare the enormous luxury and wealth of others\nwith the mediocrity of our own state.  But here we surrender ourselves\neasily to pleasure, and we have the brilliancy of luxury without the\nlassitude of its pomp.'\n\n'It was from that feeling that you chose your summer retreat at\nPompeii?'\n\n'It was.  I prefer it to Baiae: I grant the charms of the latter, but I\nlove not the pedants who resort there, and who seem to weigh out their\npleasures by the drachm.'\n\n'Yet you are fond of the learned, too; and as for poetry, why, your\nhouse is literally eloquent with AEschylus and Homer, the epic and the\ndrama.'\n\n'Yes, but those Romans who mimic my Athenian ancestors do everything so\nheavily.  Even in the chase they make their slaves carry Plato with\nthem; and whenever the boar is lost, out they take their books and their\npapyrus, in order not to lose their time too. When the dancing-girls\nswim before them in all the blandishment of Persian manners, some drone\nof a freedman, with a face of stone, reads them a section of Cicero \"De\nOfficiis\".  Unskilful pharmacists! pleasure and study are not elements\nto be thus mixed together, they must be enjoyed separately: the Romans\nlose both by this pragmatical affectation of refinement, and prove that\nthey have no souls for either. Oh, my Clodius, how little your\ncountrymen know of the true versatility of a Pericles, of the true\nwitcheries of an Aspasia!  It was but the other day that I paid a visit\nto Pliny: he was sitting in his summer-house writing, while an\nunfortunate slave played on the tibia.  His nephew (oh! whip me such\nphilosophical coxcombs!) was reading Thucydides' description of the\nplague, and nodding his conceited little head in time to the music,\nwhile his lips were repeating all the loathsome details of that terrible\ndelineation. The puppy saw nothing incongruous in learning at the same\ntime a ditty of love and a description of the plague.'\n\n'Why, they are much the same thing,' said Clodius.\n\n'So I told him, in excuse for his coxcombry--but my youth stared me\nrebukingly in the face, without taking the jest, and answered, that it\nwas only the insensate ear that the music pleased, whereas the book (the\ndescription of the plague, mind you!) elevated the heart.  \"Ah!\" quoth\nthe fat uncle, wheezing, \"my boy is quite an Athenian, always mixing the\nutile with the dulce.\" O Minerva, how I laughed in my sleeve!  While I\nwas there, they came to tell the boy-sophist that his favorite freedman\nwas just dead of a fever.  \"Inexorable death!\" cried he; \"get me my\nHorace.  How beautifully the sweet poet consoles us for these\nmisfortunes!\"  Oh, can these men love, my Clodius?  Scarcely even with\nthe senses.  How rarely a Roman has a heart!  He is but the mechanism of\ngenius--he wants its bones and flesh.'\n\nThough Clodius was secretly a little sore at these remarks on his\ncountrymen, he affected to sympathize with his friend, partly because he\nwas by nature a parasite, and partly because it was the fashion among\nthe dissolute young Romans to affect a little contempt for the very\nbirth which, in reality, made them so arrogant; it was the mode to\nimitate the Greeks, and yet to laugh at their own clumsy imitation.\n\nThus conversing, their steps were arrested by a crowd gathered round an\nopen space where three streets met; and, just where the porticoes of a\nlight and graceful temple threw their shade, there stood a young girl,\nwith a flower-basket on her right arm, and a small three-stringed\ninstrument of music in the left hand, to whose low and soft tones she\nwas modulating a wild and half-barbaric air.  At every pause in the\nmusic she gracefully waved her flower-basket round, inviting the\nloiterers to buy; and many a sesterce was showered into the basket,\neither in compliment to the music or in compassion to the\nsongstress--for she was blind.\n\n'It is my poor Thessalian,' said Glaucus, stopping; 'I have not seen her\nsince my return to Pompeii.  Hush! her voice is sweet; let us listen.'\n\n          THE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL'S SONG\n\n                    I.\n\n         Buy my flowers--O buy--I pray!\n           The blind girl comes from afar;\n         If the earth be as fair as I hear them say,\n           These flowers her children are!\n         Do they her beauty keep?\n           They are fresh from her lap, I know;\n         For I caught them fast asleep\n           In her arms an hour ago.\n           With the air which is her breath--\n          Her soft and delicate breath--\n          Over them murmuring low!\n\n        On their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet,\n        And their cheeks with her tender tears are wet.\n        For she weeps--that gentle mother weeps--\n       (As morn and night her watch she keeps,\n        With a yearning heart and a passionate care)\n        To see the young things grow so fair;\n           She weeps--for love she weeps;\n           And the dews are the tears she weeps\n           From the well of a mother's love!\n\n                    II.\n\n         Ye have a world of light,\n           Where love in the loved rejoices;\n         But the blind girl's home is the House of Night,\n           And its beings are empty voices.\n\n           As one in the realm below,\n           I stand by the streams of woe!\n           I hear the vain shadows glide,\n           I feel their soft breath at my side.\n             And I thirst the loved forms to see,\n           And I stretch my fond arms around,\n           And I catch but a shapeless sound,\n           For the living are ghosts to me.\n\n            Come buy--come buy?--\n          (Hark! how the sweet things sigh\n           For they have a voice like ours),\n           `The breath of the blind girl closes\n           The leaves of the saddening roses--\n          We are tender, we sons of light,\n           We shrink from this child of night;\n           From the grasp of the blind girl free us--\n          We yearn for the eyes that see us--\n         We are for night too gay,\n           In your eyes we behold the day--\n             O buy--O buy the flowers!'\n\n'I must have yon bunch of violets, sweet Nydia,' said Glaucus, pressing\nthrough the crowd, and dropping a handful of small coins into the\nbasket; 'your voice is more charming than ever.'\n\nThe blind girl started forward as she heard the Athenian's voice; then\nas suddenly paused, while the blood rushed violently over neck, cheek,\nand temples.\n\n'So you are returned!' said she, in a low voice; and then repeated half\nto herself, 'Glaucus is returned!'\n\n'Yes, child, I have not been at Pompeii above a few days.  My garden\nwants your care, as before; you will visit it, I trust, to-morrow.  And\nmind, no garlands at my house shall be woven by any hands but those of\nthe pretty Nydia.'\n\nNydia smiled joyously, but did not answer; and Glaucus, placing in his\nbreast the violets he had selected, turned gaily and carelessly from the\ncrowd.\n\n'So she is a sort of client of yours, this child?' said Clodius.\n\n'Ay--does she not sing prettily?  She interests me, the poor slave!\nBesides, she is from the land of the Gods' hill--Olympus frowned upon\nher cradle--she is of Thessaly.'\n\n'The witches' country.'\n\n'True: but for my part I find every woman a witch; and at Pompeii, by\nVenus! the very air seems to have taken a love-philtre, so handsome does\nevery face without a beard seem in my eyes.'\n\n'And lo! one of the handsomest in Pompeii, old Diomed's daughter, the\nrich Julia!' said Clodius, as a young lady, her face covered by her\nveil, and attended by two female slaves, approached them, in her way to\nthe baths.\n\n'Fair Julia, we salute thee!' said Clodius.\n\nJulia partly raised her veil, so as with some coquetry to display a bold\nRoman profile, a full dark bright eye, and a cheek over whose natural\nolive art shed a fairer and softer rose.\n\n'And Glaucus, too, is returned!' said she, glancing meaningly at the\nAthenian.  'Has he forgotten,' she added, in a half-whisper, 'his\nfriends of the last year?'\n\n'Beautiful Julia! even Lethe itself, if it disappear in one part of the\nearth, rises again in another.  Jupiter does not allow us ever to forget\nfor more than a moment: but Venus, more harsh still, vouchsafes not even\na moment's oblivion.'\n\n'Glaucus is never at a loss for fair words.'\n\n'Who is, when the object of them is so fair?'\n\n'We shall see you both at my father's villa soon,' said Julia, turning\nto Clodius.\n\n'We will mark the day in which we visit you with a white stone,'\nanswered the gamester.\n\nJulia dropped her veil, but slowly, so that her last glance rested on\nthe Athenian with affected timidity and real boldness; the glance\nbespoke tenderness and reproach.\n\nThe friends passed on.\n\n'Julia is certainly handsome,' said Glaucus.\n\n'And last year you would have made that confession in a warmer tone.'\n\n'True; I was dazzled at the first sight, and mistook for a gem that\nwhich was but an artful imitation.'\n\n'Nay,' returned Clodius, 'all women are the same at heart.  Happy he who\nweds a handsome face and a large dower.  What more can he desire?'\n\nGlaucus sighed.\n\nThey were now in a street less crowded than the rest, at the end of\nwhich they beheld that broad and most lovely sea, which upon those\ndelicious coasts seems to have renounced its prerogative of terror--so\nsoft are the crisping winds that hover around its bosom, so glowing and\nso various are the hues which it takes from the rosy clouds, so fragrant\nare the perfumes which the breezes from the land scatter over its\ndepths.  From such a sea might you well believe that Aphrodite rose to\ntake the empire of the earth.\n\n'It is still early for the bath,' said the Greek, who was the creature\nof every poetical impulse; 'let us wander from the crowded city, and\nlook upon the sea while the noon yet laughs along its billows.'\n\n'With all my heart,' said Clodius; 'and the bay, too, is always the most\nanimated part of the city.'\n\nPompeii was the miniature of the civilization of that age. Within the\nnarrow compass of its walls was contained, as it were, a specimen of\nevery gift which luxury offered to power.  In its minute but glittering\nshops, its tiny palaces, its baths, its forum, its theatre, its\ncircus--in the energy yet corruption, in the refinement yet the vice, of\nits people, you beheld a model of the whole empire. It was a toy, a\nplaything, a showbox, in which the gods seemed pleased to keep the\nrepresentation of the great monarchy of earth, and which they afterwards\nhid from time, to give to the wonder of posterity--the moral of the\nmaxim, that under the sun there is nothing new.\n\nCrowded in the glassy bay were the vessels of commerce and the gilded\ngalleys for the pleasures of the rich citizens.  The boats of the\nfishermen glided rapidly to and fro; and afar off you saw the tall masts\nof the fleet under the command of Pliny.  Upon the shore sat a Sicilian\nwho, with vehement gestures and flexile features, was narrating to a\ngroup of fishermen and peasants a strange tale of shipwrecked mariners\nand friendly dolphins--just as at this day, in the modern neighborhood,\nyou may hear upon the Mole of Naples.\n\nDrawing his comrade from the crowd, the Greek bent his steps towards a\nsolitary part of the beach, and the two friends, seated on a small crag\nwhich rose amidst the smooth pebbles, inhaled the voluptuous and cooling\nbreeze, which dancing over the waters, kept music with its invisible\nfeet. There was, perhaps, something in the scene that invited them to\nsilence and reverie.  Clodius, shading his eyes from the burning sky,\nwas calculating the gains of the last week; and the Greek, leaning upon\nhis hand, and shrinking not from that sun--his nation's tutelary\ndeity--with whose fluent light of poesy, and joy, and love, his own\nveins were filled, gazed upon the broad expanse, and envied, perhaps,\nevery wind that bent its pinions towards the shores of Greece.\n\n'Tell me, Clodius,' said the Greek at last, 'hast thou ever been in\nlove?'\n\n'Yes, very often.'\n\n'He who has loved often,' answered Glaucus, 'has loved never. There is\nbut one Eros, though there are many counterfeits of him.'\n\n'The counterfeits are not bad little gods, upon the whole,' answered\nClodius.\n\n'I agree with you,' returned the Greek.  'I adore even the shadow of\nLove; but I adore himself yet more.'\n\n'Art thou, then, soberly and honestly in love?  Hast thou that feeling\nwhich the poets describe--a feeling that makes us neglect our suppers,\nforswear the theatre, and write elegies?  I should never have thought\nit.  You dissemble well.'\n\n'I am not far gone enough for that,' returned Glaucus, smiling, 'or\nrather I say with Tibullus--\n\nHe whom love rules, where'er his path may be, Walks safe and sacred.\n\nIn fact, I am not in love; but I could be if there were but occasion to\nsee the object.  Eros would light his torch, but the priests have given\nhim no oil.'\n\n'Shall I guess the object?--Is it not Diomed's daughter?  She adores\nyou, and does not affect to conceal it; and, by Hercules, I say again\nand again, she is both handsome and rich.  She will bind the door-posts\nof her husband with golden fillets.'\n\n'No, I do not desire to sell myself.  Diomed's daughter is handsome, I\ngrant: and at one time, had she not been the grandchild of a freedman, I\nmight have...  Yet no--she carries all her beauty in her face; her\nmanners are not maiden-like, and her mind knows no culture save that of\npleasure.'\n\n'You are ungrateful.  Tell me, then, who is the fortunate virgin?'\n\n'You shall hear, my Clodius.  Several months ago I was sojourning at\nNeapolis, a city utterly to my own heart, for it still retains the\nmanners and stamp of its Grecian origin--and it yet merits the name of\nParthenope, from its delicious air and its beautiful shores. One day I\nentered the temple of Minerva, to offer up my prayers, not for myself\nmore than for the city on which Pallas smiles no longer. The temple was\nempty and deserted. The recollections of Athens crowded fast and\nmeltingly upon me: imagining myself still alone in the temple, and\nabsorbed in the earnestness of my devotion, my prayer gushed from my\nheart to my lips, and I wept as I prayed. I was startled in the midst of\nmy devotions, however, by a deep sigh; I turned suddenly round, and just\nbehind me was a female.  She had raised her veil also in prayer: and\nwhen our eyes met, methought a celestial ray shot from those dark and\nsmiling orbs at once into my soul.  Never, my Clodius, have I seen\nmortal face more exquisitely molded: a certain melancholy softened and\nyet elevated its expression: that unutterable something, which springs\nfrom the soul, and which our sculptors have imparted to the aspect of\nPsyche, gave her beauty I know not what of divine and noble; tears were\nrolling down her eyes.  I guessed at once that she was also of Athenian\nlineage; and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded to\nmine. I spoke to her, though with a faltering voice--\"Art thou not, too,\nAthenian?\" said I, \"O beautiful virgin!\" At the sound of my voice she\nblushed, and half drew her veil across her face.--\"My forefathers'\nashes,\" said she, \"repose by the waters of Ilissus: my birth is of\nNeapolis; but my heart, as my lineage, is Athenian.\"--\"Let us, then,\"\nsaid I, \"make our offerings together\": and, as the priest now appeared,\nwe stood side by side, while we followed the priest in his ceremonial\nprayer; together we touched the knees of the goddess--together we laid\nour olive garlands on the altar. I felt a strange emotion of almost\nsacred tenderness at this companionship. We, strangers from a far and\nfallen land, stood together and alone in that temple of our country's\ndeity: was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman,\nfor so I might surely call her?  I felt as if I had known her for years;\nand that simple rite seemed, as by a miracle, to operate on the\nsympathies and ties of time.  Silently we left the temple, and I was\nabout to ask her where she dwelt, and if I might be permitted to visit\nher, when a youth, in whose features there was some kindred resemblance\nto her own, and who stood upon the steps of the fane, took her by the\nhand.  She turned round and bade me farewell.  The crowd separated us: I\nsaw her no more.  On reaching my home I found letters, which obliged me\nto set out for Athens, for my relations threatened me with litigation\nconcerning my inheritance. When that suit was happily over, I repaired\nonce more to Neapolis; I instituted inquiries throughout the whole city,\nI could discover no clue of my lost countrywoman, and, hoping to lose in\ngaiety all remembrance of that beautiful apparition, I hastened to\nplunge myself amidst the luxuries of Pompeii.  This is all my history.\nI do not love; but I remember and regret.'\n\nAs Clodius was about to reply, a slow and stately step approached them,\nand at the sound it made amongst the pebbles, each turned, and each\nrecognized the new-comer.\n\nIt was a man who had scarcely reached his fortieth year, of tall\nstature, and of a thin but nervous and sinewy frame.  His skin, dark and\nbronzed, betrayed his Eastern origin; and his features had something\nGreek in their outline (especially in the chin, the lip, and the brow),\nsave that the nose was somewhat raised and aquiline; and the bones, hard\nand visible, forbade that fleshy and waving contour which on the Grecian\nphysiognomy preserved even in manhood the round and beautiful curves of\nyouth.  His eyes, large and black as the deepest night, shone with no\nvarying and uncertain lustre. A deep, thoughtful, and half-melancholy\ncalm seemed unalterably fixed in their majestic and commanding gaze.\nHis step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty, and something\nforeign in the fashion and the sober hues of his sweeping garments added\nto the impressive effect of his quiet countenance and stately form.\nEach of the young men, in saluting the new-comer, made mechanically, and\nwith care to conceal it from him, a slight gesture or sign with their\nfingers; for Arbaces, the Egyptian, was supposed to possess the fatal\ngift of the evil eye.\n\n'The scene must, indeed, be beautiful,' said Arbaces, with a cold though\ncourteous smile, 'which draws the gay Clodius, and Glaucus the all\nadmired, from the crowded thoroughfares of the city.'\n\n'Is Nature ordinarily so unattractive?' asked the Greek.\n\n'To the dissipated--yes.'\n\n'An austere reply, but scarcely a wise one.  Pleasure delights in\ncontrasts; it is from dissipation that we learn to enjoy solitude, and\nfrom solitude dissipation.'\n\n'So think the young philosophers of the Garden,' replied the Egyptian;\n'they mistake lassitude for meditation, and imagine that, because they\nare sated with others, they know the delight of loneliness.  But not in\nsuch jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone draws\nfrom her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty: she demands from\nyou, not the exhaustion of passion, but all that fervor, from which you\nonly seek, in adoring her, a release.  When, young Athenian, the moon\nrevealed herself in visions of light to Endymion, it was after a day\npassed, not amongst the feverish haunts of men, but on the still\nmountains and in the solitary valleys of the hunter.'\n\n'Beautiful simile!' cried Glaucus; 'most unjust application! Exhaustion!\nthat word is for age, not youth.  By me, at least, one moment of satiety\nhas never been known!'\n\nAgain the Egyptian smiled, but his smile was cold and blighting, and\neven the unimaginative Clodius froze beneath its light.  He did not,\nhowever, reply to the passionate exclamation of Glaucus; but, after a\npause, he said, in a soft and melancholy voice:\n\n'After all, you do right to enjoy the hour while it smiles for you; the\nrose soon withers, the perfume soon exhales.  And we, O Glaucus!\nstrangers in the land and far from our fathers' ashes, what is there\nleft for us but pleasure or regret!--for you the first, perhaps for me\nthe last.'\n\nThe bright eyes of the Greek were suddenly suffused with tears. 'Ah,\nspeak not, Arbaces,' he cried--'speak not of our ancestors.  Let us\nforget that there were ever other liberties than those of Rome!  And\nGlory!--oh, vainly would we call her ghost from the fields of Marathon\nand Thermopylae!'\n\n'Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest,' said the Egyptian; 'and in\nthy gaieties this night, thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than of\nLais. Vale!'\n\nThus saying, he gathered his robe around him, and slowly swept away.\n\n'I breathe more freely,' said Clodius.  'Imitating the Egyptians, we\nsometimes introduce a skeleton at our feasts.  In truth, the presence of\nsuch an Egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre enough to sour the\nrichest grape of the Falernian.'\n\n'Strange man! said Glaucus, musingly; 'yet dead though he seem to\npleasure, and cold to the objects of the world, scandal belies him, or\nhis house and his heart could tell a different tale.'\n\n'Ah! there are whispers of other orgies than those of Osiris in his\ngloomy mansion.  He is rich, too, they say.  Can we not get him amongst\nus, and teach him the charms of dice?  Pleasure of pleasures! hot fever\nof hope and fear! inexpressible unjaded passion! how fiercely beautiful\nthou art, O Gaming!'\n\n'Inspired--inspired!' cried Glaucus, laughing; 'the oracle speaks poetry\nin Clodius.  What miracle next!'\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nPARENTAGE OF GLAUCUS.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES OF POMPEII. CLASSIC\nREVEL.\n\nHEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one: it had given him\nbeauty, health, fortune, genius, illustrious descent, a heart of fire, a\nmind of poetry; but it had denied him the heritage of freedom. He was\nborn in Athens, the subject of Rome.  Succeeding early to an ample\ninheritance, he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural to\nthe young, and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasure\namidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court.\n\nHe was an Alcibiades without ambition.  He was what a man of\nimagination, youth, fortune, and talents, readily becomes when you\ndeprive him of the inspiration of glory.  His house at Rome was the\ntheme of the debauchees, but also of the lovers of art; and the\nsculptors of Greece delighted to task their skill in adorning the\nporticoes and exedrae of an Athenian.  His retreat in Pompeii--alas! the\ncolors are faded now, the walls stripped of their paintings!--its main\nbeauty, its elaborate finish of grace and ornament, is gone; yet when\nfirst given once more to the day, what eulogies, what wonder, did its\nminute and glowing decorations create--its paintings--its mosaics!\nPassionately enamoured of poetry and the drama, which recalled to\nGlaucus the wit and the heroism of his race, that fairy mansion was\nadorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer.  And antiquaries,\nwho resolve taste to a trade, have turned the patron to the professor,\nand still (though the error is now acknowledged) they style in custom,\nas they first named in mistake, the disburied house of the Athenian\nGlaucus 'THE HOUSE OF THE DRAMATIC POET'.\n\nPrevious to our description of this house, it may be as well to convey\nto the reader a general notion of the houses of Pompeii, which he will\nfind to resemble strongly the plans of Vitruvius; but with all those\ndifferences in detail, of caprice and taste, which being natural to\nmankind, have always puzzled antiquaries.  We shall endeavor to make\nthis description as clear and unpedantic as possible.\n\nYou enter then, usually, by a small entrance-passage (called\ncestibulum), into a hall, sometimes with (but more frequently without)\nthe ornament of columns; around three sides of this hall are doors\ncommunicating with several bedchambers (among which is the porter's),\nthe best of these being usually appropriated to country visitors.  At\nthe extremity of the hall, on either side to the right and left, if the\nhouse is large, there are two small recesses, rather than chambers,\ngenerally devoted to the ladies of the mansion; and in the centre of the\ntessellated pavement of the hall is invariably a square, shallow\nreservoir for rain water (classically termed impluvium), which was\nadmitted by an aperture in the roof above; the said aperture being\ncovered at will by an awning.  Near this impluvium, which had a peculiar\nsanctity in the eyes of the ancients, were sometimes (but at Pompeii\nmore rarely than at Rome) placed images of the household gods--the\nhospitable hearth, often mentioned by the Roman poets, and consecrated\nto the Lares, was at Pompeii almost invariably formed by a movable\nbrazier; while in some corner, often the most ostentatious place, was\ndeposited a huge wooden chest, ornamented and strengthened by bands of\nbronze or iron, and secured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal so\nfirmly as to defy the attempts of any robber to detach it from its\nposition. It is supposed that this chest was the money-box, or coffer,\nof the master of the house; though as no money has been found in any of\nthe chests discovered at Pompeii, it is probable that it was sometimes\nrather designed for ornament than use.\n\nIn this hall (or atrium, to speak classically) the clients and visitors\nof inferior rank were usually received.  In the houses of the more\n'respectable', an atriensis, or slave peculiarly devoted to the service\nof the hall, was invariably retained, and his rank among his\nfellow-slaves was high and important.  The reservoir in the centre must\nhave been rather a dangerous ornament, but the centre of the hall was\nlike the grass-plot of a college, and interdicted to the passers to and\nfro, who found ample space in the margin.  Right opposite the entrance,\nat the other end of the hall, was an apartment (tablinum), in which the\npavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics, and the walls covered\nwith elaborate paintings.  Here were usually kept the records of the\nfamily, or those of any public office that had been filled by the owner:\non one side of this saloon, if we may so call it, was often a\ndining-room, or triclinium; on the other side, perhaps, what we should\nnow term a cabinet of gems, containing whatever curiosities were deemed\nmost rare and costly; and invariably a small passage for the slaves to\ncross to the further parts of the house, without passing the apartments\nthus mentioned.  These rooms all opened on a square or oblong colonnade,\ntechnically termed peristyle.  If the house was small, its boundary\nceased with this colonnade; and in that case its centre, however\ndiminutive, was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a garden, and\nadorned with vases of flowers, placed upon pedestals: while, under the\ncolonnade, to the right and left, were doors admitting to bedrooms, to a\nsecond triclinium, or eating-room (for the ancients generally\nappropriated two rooms at least to that purpose, one for summer, and one\nfor winter--or, perhaps, one for ordinary, the other for festive,\noccasions); and if the owner affected letters, a cabinet, dignified by\nthe name of library--for a very small room was sufficient to contain the\nfew rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable collection of\nbooks.\n\nAt the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen.  Supposing the\nhouse was large, it did not end with the peristyle, and the centre\nthereof was not in that case a garden, but might be, perhaps, adorned\nwith a fountain, or basin for fish; and at its end, exactly opposite to\nthe tablinum, was generally another eating-room, on either side of which\nwere bedrooms, and, perhaps, a picture-saloon, or pinacotheca.  These\napartments communicated again with a square or oblong space, usually\nadorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle, and very\nmuch resembling the peristyle, only usually longer.  This was the proper\nviridarium, or garden, being commonly adorned with a fountain, or\nstatues, and a profusion of gay flowers: at its extreme end was the\ngardener's house; on either side, beneath the colonnade, were sometimes,\nif the size of the family required it, additional rooms.\n\nAt Pompeii, a second or third story was rarely of importance, being\nbuilt only above a small part of the house, and containing rooms for the\nslaves; differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices of\nRome, which generally contained the principal eating-room (or\ncaenaculum) on the second floor.  The apartments themselves were\nordinarily of small size; for in those delightful climes they received\nany extraordinary number of visitors in the peristyle (or portico), the\nhall, or the garden; and even their banquet-rooms, however elaborately\nadorned and carefully selected in point of aspect, were of diminutive\nproportions; for the intellectual ancients, being fond of society, not\nof crowds, rarely feasted more than nine at a time, so that large\ndinner-rooms were not so necessary with them as with us. But the suite\nof rooms seen at once from the entrance, must have had a very imposing\neffect: you beheld at once the hall richly paved and painted--the\ntablinum--the graceful peristyle, and (if the house extended farther)\nthe opposite banquet-room and the garden, which closed the view with\nsome gushing fount or marble statue.\n\nThe reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses,\nwhich resembled in some respects the Grecian, but mostly the Roman\nfashion of domestic architecture.  In almost every house there is some\ndifference in detail from the rest, but the principal outline is the\nsame in all.  In all you find the hall, the tablinum, and the peristyle,\ncommunicating with each other; in all you find the walls richly painted;\nand all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegancies of\nlife.  The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is,\nhowever, questionable: they were fond of the gaudiest colors, of\nfantastic designs; they often painted the lower half of their columns a\nbright red, leaving the rest uncolored; and where the garden was small,\nits wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent,\nimitating trees, birds, temples, etc., in perspective--a meretricious\ndelusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted, with a\ncomplacent pride in its ingenuity.\n\nBut the house of Glaucus was at once one of the smallest, and yet one of\nthe most adorned and finished of all the private mansions of Pompeii: it\nwould be a model at this day for the house of 'a single man in\nMayfair'--the envy and despair of the coelibian purchasers of buhl\nand marquetry.\n\nYou enter by a long and narrow vestibule, on the floor of which is the\nimage of a dog in mosaic, with the well-known 'Cave canem'--or 'Beware\nthe dog'. On either side is a chamber of some size; for the interior\npart of the house not being large enough to contain the two great\ndivisions of private and public apartments, these two rooms were set\napart for the reception of visitors who neither by rank nor familiarity\nwere entitled to admission in the penetralia of the mansion.\n\nAdvancing up the vestibule you enter an atrium, that when first\ndiscovered was rich in paintings, which in point of expression would\nscarcely disgrace a Rafaele.  You may see them now transplanted to the\nNeapolitan Museum: they are still the admiration of connoisseurs--they\ndepict the parting of Achilles and Briseis.  Who does not acknowledge\nthe force, the vigour, the beauty, employed in delineating the forms and\nfaces of Achilles and the immortal slave!\n\nOn one side the atrium, a small staircase admitted to the apartments for\nthe slaves on the second floor; there also were two or three small\nbedrooms, the walls of which portrayed the rape of Europa, the battle of\nthe Amazons, etc.\n\nYou now enter the tablinum, across which, at either end, hung rich\ndraperies of Tyrian purple, half withdrawn.  On the walls was depicted a\npoet reading his verses to his friends; and in the pavement was inserted\na small and most exquisite mosaic, typical of the instructions given by\nthe director of the stage to his comedians.\n\nYou passed through this saloon and entered the peristyle; and here (as I\nhave said before was usually the case with the smaller houses of\nPompeii) the mansion ended.  From each of the seven columns that adorned\nthis court hung festoons of garlands: the centre, supplying the place of\na garden, bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of white\nmarble, that were supported on pedestals.  At the left hand of this\nsmall garden was a diminutive fane, resembling one of those small\nchapels placed at the side of roads in Catholic countries, and dedicated\nto the Penates; before it stood a bronzed tripod: to the left of the\ncolonnade were two small cubicula, or bedrooms; to the right was the\ntriclinium, in which the guests were now assembled.\n\nThis room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples 'The Chamber of\nLeda'; and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell, the reader will\nfind an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Leda\npresenting her newborn to her husband, from which the room derives its\nname. This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden.  Round\nthe table of citrean wood, highly polished and delicately wrought with\nsilver arabesques, were placed the three couches, which were yet more\ncommon at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately into\nfashion at Rome: and on these couches of bronze, studded with richer\nmetals, were laid thick quiltings covered with elaborate broidery, and\nyielding luxuriously to the pressure.\n\n'Well, I must own,' said the aedile Pansa, 'that your house, though\nscarcely larger than a case for one's fibulae, is a gem of its kind.\nHow beautifully painted is that parting of Achilles and Briseis!--what a\nstyle!--what heads!--what a-hem!'\n\n'Praise from Pansa is indeed valuable on such subjects,' said Clodius,\ngravely.  'Why, the paintings on his walls!--Ah! there is, indeed, the\nhand of a Zeuxis!'\n\n'You flatter me, my Clodius; indeed you do,' quoth the aedile, who was\ncelebrated through Pompeii for having the worst paintings in the world;\nfor he was patriotic, and patronized none but Pompeians.  'You flatter\nme; but there is something pretty--AEdepol, yes--in the colors, to say\nnothing of the design--and then for the kitchen, my friends--ah! that\nwas all my fancy.'\n\n'What is the design?' said Glaucus.  'I have not yet seen your kitchen,\nthough I have often witnessed the excellence of its cheer.'\n\n'A cook, my Athenian--a cook sacrificing the trophies of his skill on\nthe altar of Vesta, with a beautiful muraena (taken from the life) on a\nspit at a distance--there is some invention there!'\n\nAt that instant the slaves appeared, bearing a tray covered with the\nfirst preparative initia of the feast.  Amidst delicious figs, fresh\nherbs strewed with snow, anchovies, and eggs, were ranged small cups of\ndiluted wine sparingly mixed with honey.  As these were placed on the\ntable, young slaves bore round to each of the five guests (for there\nwere no more) the silver basin of perfumed water, and napkins edged with\na purple fringe.  But the aedile ostentatiously drew forth his own\nnapkin, which was not, indeed, of so fine a linen, but in which the\nfringe was twice as broad, and wiped his hands with the parade of a man\nwho felt he was calling for admiration.\n\n'A splendid nappa that of yours,' said Clodius; 'why, the fringe is as\nbroad as a girdle!'\n\n'A trifle, my Clodius: a trifle!  They tell me this stripe is the latest\nfashion at Rome; but Glaucus attends to these things more than I.'\n\n'Be propitious, O Bacchus!' said Glaucus, inclining reverentially to a\nbeautiful image of the god placed in the centre of the table, at the\ncorners of which stood the Lares and the salt-holders.  The guests\nfollowed the prayer, and then, sprinkling the wine on the table, they\nperformed the wonted libation.\n\nThis over, the convivialists reclined themselves on the couches, and the\nbusiness of the hour commenced.\n\n'May this cup be my last!' said the young Sallust, as the table, cleared\nof its first stimulants, was now loaded with the substantial part of the\nentertainment, and the ministering slave poured forth to him a brimming\ncyathus--'May this cup be my last, but it is the best wine I have drunk\nat Pompeii!'\n\n'Bring hither the amphora,' said Glaucus, 'and read its date and its\ncharacter.'\n\nThe slave hastened to inform the party that the scroll fastened to the\ncork betokened its birth from Chios, and its age a ripe fifty years.\n\n'How deliciously the snow has cooled it!' said Pansa.  'It is just\nenough.'\n\n'It is like the experience of a man who has cooled his pleasures\nsufficiently to give them a double zest,' exclaimed Sallust.\n\n'It is like a woman's \"No\",' added Glaucus: 'it cools, but to inflame\nthe more.'\n\n'When is our next wild-beast fight?' said Clodius to Pansa.\n\n'It stands fixed for the ninth ide of August,' answered Pansa: 'on the\nday after the Vulcanalia--we have a most lovely young lion for the\noccasion.'\n\n'Whom shall we get for him to eat?' asked Clodius.  'Alas! there is a\ngreat scarcity of criminals.  You must positively find some innocent or\nother to condemn to the lion, Pansa!'\n\n'Indeed I have thought very seriously about it of late,' replied the\naedile, gravely.  'It was a most infamous law that which forbade us to\nsend our own slaves to the wild beasts.  Not to let us do what we like\nwith our own, that's what I call an infringement on property itself.'\n\n'Not so in the good old days of the Republic,' sighed Sallust.\n\n'And then this pretended mercy to the slaves is such a disappointment to\nthe poor people.  How they do love to see a good tough battle between a\nman and a lion; and all this innocent pleasure they may lose (if the\ngods don't send us a good criminal soon) from this cursed law!'\n\n'What can be worse policy,' said Clodius, sententiously, 'than to\ninterfere with the manly amusements of the people?'\n\n'Well thank Jupiter and the Fates! we have no Nero at present,' said\nSallust.\n\n'He was, indeed, a tyrant; he shut up our amphitheatre for ten years.'\n\n'I wonder it did not create a rebellion,' said Sallust.\n\n'It very nearly did,' returned Pansa, with his mouth full of wild boar.\n\nHere the conversation was interrupted for a moment by a flourish of\nflutes, and two slaves entered with a single dish.\n\n'Ah, what delicacy hast thou in store for us now, my Glaucus?' cried the\nyoung Sallust, with sparkling eyes.\n\nSallust was only twenty-four, but he had no pleasure in life like\neating--perhaps he had exhausted all the others: yet had he some talent,\nand an excellent heart--as far as it went.\n\n'I know its face, by Pollux!' cried Pansa.  'It is an Ambracian Kid.  Ho\n(snapping his fingers, a usual signal to the slaves) we must prepare a\nnew libation in honour to the new-comer.'\n\n'I had hoped said Glaucus,' in a melancholy tone, 'to have procured you\nsome oysters from Britain; but the winds that were so cruel to Caesar\nhave forbid us the oysters.'\n\n'Are they in truth so delicious?' asked Lepidus, loosening to a yet more\nluxurious ease his ungirdled tunic.\n\n'Why, in truth, I suspect it is the distance that gives the flavor; they\nwant the richness of the Brundusium oyster.  But, at Rome, no supper is\ncomplete without them.'\n\n'The poor Britons!  There is some good in them after all,' said Sallust.\n'They produce an oyster.'\n\n'I wish they would produce us a gladiator,' said the aedile, whose\nprovident mind was musing over the wants of the amphitheatre.\n\n'By Pallas!' cried Glaucus, as his favorite slave crowned his streaming\nlocks with a new chaplet, 'I love these wild spectacles well enough when\nbeast fights beast; but when a man, one with bones and blood like ours,\nis coldly put on the arena, and torn limb from limb, the interest is too\nhorrid: I sicken--I gasp for breath--I long to rush and defend him.  The\nyells of the populace seem to me more dire than the voices of the Furies\nchasing Orestes.  I rejoice that there is so little chance of that\nbloody exhibition for our next show!'\n\nThe aedile shrugged his shoulders.  The young Sallust, who was thought\nthe best-natured man in Pompeii, stared in surprise.  The graceful\nLepidus, who rarely spoke for fear of disturbing his features,\nejaculated 'Hercle!' The parasite Clodius muttered 'AEdepol!' and the\nsixth banqueter, who was the umbra of Clodius, and whose duty it was to\necho his richer friend, when he could not praise him--the parasite of a\nparasite--muttered also 'AEdepol!'\n\n'Well, you Italians are used to these spectacles; we Greeks are more\nmerciful.  Ah, shade of Pindar!--the rapture of a true Grecian game--the\nemulation of man against man--the generous strife--the half-mournful\ntriumph--so proud to contend with a noble foe, so sad to see him\novercome! But ye understand me not.'\n\n'The kid is excellent,' said Sallust.  The slave, whose duty it was to\ncarve, and who valued himself on his science, had just performed that\noffice on the kid to the sound of music, his knife keeping time,\nbeginning with a low tenor and accomplishing the arduous feat amidst a\nmagnificent diapason.\n\n'Your cook is, of course, from Sicily?' said Pansa.\n\n'Yes, of Syracuse.'\n\n'I will play you for him,' said Clodius.  'We will have a game between\nthe courses.'\n\n'Better that sort of game, certainly, than a beast fight; but I cannot\nstake my Sicilian--you have nothing so precious to stake me in return.'\n\n'My Phillida--my beautiful dancing-girl!'\n\n'I never buy women,' said the Greek, carelessly rearranging his chaplet.\n\nThe musicians, who were stationed in the portico without, had commenced\ntheir office with the kid; they now directed the melody into a more\nsoft, a more gay, yet it may be a more intellectual strain; and they\nchanted that song of Horace beginning 'Persicos odi', etc., so\nimpossible to translate, and which they imagined applicable to a feast\nthat, effeminate as it seems to us, was simple enough for the gorgeous\nrevelry of the time.  We are witnessing the domestic, and not the\nprincely feast--the entertainment of a gentleman, not an emperor or a\nsenator.\n\n'Ah, good old Horace!' said Sallust, compassionately; 'he sang well of\nfeasts and girls, but not like our modern poets.'\n\n'The immortal Fulvius, for instance,' said Clodius.\n\n'Ah, Fulvius, the immortal!' said the umbra.\n\n'And Spuraena; and Caius Mutius, who wrote three epics in a year--could\nHorace do that, or Virgil either said Lepidus.  'Those old poets all\nfell into the mistake of copying sculpture instead of painting.\nSimplicity and repose--that was their notion; but we moderns have fire,\nand passion, and energy--we never sleep, we imitate the colors of\npainting, its life, and its action.  Immortal Fulvius!'\n\n'By the way,' said Sallust, 'have you seen the new ode by Spuraena, in\nhonour of our Egyptian Isis?  It is magnificent--the true religious\nfervor.'\n\n'Isis seems a favorite divinity at Pompeii,' said Glaucus.\n\n'Yes!' said Pansa, 'she is exceedingly in repute just at this moment;\nher statue has been uttering the most remarkable oracles.  I am not\nsuperstitious, but I must confess that she has more than once assisted\nme materially in my magistracy with her advice.  Her priests are so\npious, too! none of your gay, none of your proud, ministers of Jupiter\nand Fortune: they walk barefoot, eat no meat, and pass the greater part\nof the night in solitary devotion!'\n\n'An example to our other priesthoods, indeed!--Jupiter's temple wants\nreforming sadly,' said Lepidus, who was a great reformer for all but\nhimself.\n\n'They say that Arbaces the Egyptian has imparted some most solemn\nmysteries to the priests of Isis,' observed Sallust.  'He boasts his\ndescent from the race of Rameses, and declares that in his family the\nsecrets of remotest antiquity are treasured.'\n\n'He certainly possesses the gift of the evil eye,' said Clodius. 'If I\never come upon that Medusa front without the previous charm, I am sure\nto lose a favorite horse, or throw the canes nine times running.'\n\n'The last would be indeed a miracle!' said Sallust, gravely.\n\n'How mean you, Sallust?' returned the gamester, with a flushed brow.\n\n'I mean, what you would leave me if I played often with you; and that\nis--nothing.'\n\nClodius answered only by a smile of disdain.\n\n'If Arbaces were not so rich,' said Pansa, with a stately air, 'I should\nstretch my authority a little, and inquire into the truth of the report\nwhich calls him an astrologer and a sorcerer.  Agrippa, when aedile of\nRome, banished all such terrible citizens.  But a rich man--it is the\nduty of an aedile to protect the rich!'\n\n'What think you of this new sect, which I am told has even a few\nproselytes in Pompeii, these followers of the Hebrew God--Christus?'\n\n'Oh, mere speculative visionaries,' said Clodius; 'they have not a\nsingle gentleman amongst them; their proselytes are poor, insignificant,\nignorant people!'\n\n'Who ought, however, to be crucified for their blasphemy,' said Pansa,\nwith vehemence; 'they deny Venus and Jove!  Nazarene is but another name\nfor atheist.  Let me catch them--that's all.'\n\nThe second course was gone--the feasters fell back on their\ncouches--there was a pause while they listened to the soft voices of the\nSouth, and the music of the Arcadian reed.  Glaucus was the most rapt\nand the least inclined to break the silence, but Clodius began already\nto think that they wasted time.\n\n'Bene vobis! (Your health!) my Glaucus,' said he, quaffing a cup to each\nletter of the Greek's name, with the ease of the practised drinker.\n'Will you not be avenged on your ill-fortune of yesterday? See, the dice\ncourt us.'\n\n'As you will,' said Glaucus.\n\n'The dice in summer, and I an aedile!' said Pansa, magisterially; 'it is\nagainst all law.'\n\n'Not in your presence, grave Pansa,' returned Clodius, rattling the dice\nin a long box; 'your presence restrains all license: it is not the\nthing, but the excess of the thing, that hurts.'\n\n'What wisdom!' muttered the umbra.\n\n'Well, I will look another way,' said the aedile.\n\n'Not yet, good Pansa; let us wait till we have supped,' said Glaucus.\n\nClodius reluctantly yielded, concealing his vexation with a yawn.\n\n'He gapes to devour the gold,' whispered Lepidus to Sallust, in a\nquotation from the Aulularia of Plautus.\n\n'Ah! how well I know these polypi, who hold all they touch,' answered\nSallust, in the same tone, and out of the same play.\n\nThe third course, consisting of a variety of fruits, pistachio nuts,\nsweetmeats, tarts, and confectionery tortured into a thousand fantastic\nand airy shapes, was now placed upon the table; and the ministri, or\nattendants, also set there the wine (which had hitherto been handed\nround to the guests) in large jugs of glass, each bearing upon it the\nschedule of its age and quality.\n\n'Taste this Lesbian, my Pansa,' said Sallust; 'it is excellent.'\n\n'It is not very old,' said Glaucus, 'but it has been made precocious,\nlike ourselves, by being put to the fire:--the wine to the flames of\nVulcan--we to those of his wife--to whose honour I pour this cup.'\n\n'It is delicate,' said Pansa, 'but there is perhaps the least particle\ntoo much of rosin in its flavor.'\n\n'What a beautiful cup!' cried Clodius, taking up one of transparent\ncrystal, the handles of which were wrought with gems, and twisted in the\nshape of serpents, the favorite fashion at Pompeii.\n\n'This ring,' said Glaucus, taking a costly jewel from the first joint of\nhis finger and hanging it on the handle, 'gives it a richer show, and\nrenders it less unworthy of thy acceptance, my Clodius, on whom may the\ngods bestow health and fortune, long and oft to crown it to the brim!'\n\n'You are too generous, Glaucus,' said the gamester, handing the cup to\nhis slave; 'but your love gives it a double value.'\n\n'This cup to the Graces!' said Pansa, and he thrice emptied his calix.\nThe guests followed his example.\n\n'We have appointed no director to the feast,' cried Sallust.\n\n'Let us throw for him, then,' said Clodius, rattling the dice-box.\n\n'Nay,' cried Glaucus, 'no cold and trite director for us: no dictator of\nthe banquet; no rex convivii.  Have not the Romans sworn never to obey a\nking? Shall we be less free than your ancestors?  Ho! musicians, let us\nhave the song I composed the other night: it has a verse on this\nsubject, \"The Bacchic hymn of the Hours\".'\n\nThe musicians struck their instruments to a wild Ionic air, while the\nyoungest voice in the band chanted forth, in Greek words, as numbers,\nthe following strain:--\n\n           THE EVENING HYMN OF THE HOURS\n\n                     I\n\n     Through the summer day, through the weary day,\n          We have glided long;\n      Ere we speed to the Night through her portals grey,\n          Hail us with song!--\n         With song, with song,\n        With a bright and joyous song;\n       Such as the Cretan maid,\n        While the twilight made her bolder,\n       Woke, high through the ivy shade,\n        When the wine-god first consoled her.\n       From the hush'd, low-breathing skies,\n       Half-shut look'd their starry eyes,\n          And all around,\n          With a loving sound,\n        The AEgean waves were creeping:\n       On her lap lay the lynx's head;\n       Wild thyme was her bridal bed;\n       And aye through each tiny space,\n       In the green vine's green embrace\n       The Fauns were slily peeping--\n       The Fauns, the prying Fauns--\n      The arch, the laughing Fauns--\n      The Fauns were slily peeping!\n\n                     II\n\n      Flagging and faint are we\n        With our ceaseless flight,\n       And dull shall our journey be\n        Through the realm of night,\n       Bathe us, O bathe our weary wings\n       In the purple wave, as it freshly springs\n        To your cups from the fount of light--\n    From the fount of light--from the fount of light,\n\n     For there, when the sun has gone down in night,\n         There in the bowl we find him.\n       The grape is the well of that summer sun,\n       Or rather the stream that he gazed upon,\n       Till he left in truth, like the Thespian youth,\n           His soul, as he gazed, behind him.\n\n                    III\n\n      A cup to Jove, and a cup to Love,\n        And a cup to the son of Maia;\n       And honour with three, the band zone-free,\n        The band of the bright Aglaia.\n       But since every bud in the wreath of pleasure\n        Ye owe to the sister Hours,\n       No stinted cups, in a formal measure,\n        The Bromian law makes ours.\n       He honors us most who gives us most,\n       And boasts, with a Bacchanal's honest boast,\n        He never will count the treasure.\n     Fastly we fleet, then seize our wings,\n     And plunge us deep in the sparkling springs;\n     And aye, as we rise with a dripping plume,\n     We'll scatter the spray round the garland's bloom;\n           We glow--we glow,\n     Behold, as the girls of the Eastern wave\n     Bore once with a shout to the crystal cave\n       The prize of the Mysian Hylas,\n           Even so--even so,\n     We have caught the young god in our warm embrace\n     We hurry him on in our laughing race;\n     We hurry him on, with a whoop and song,\n     The cloudy rivers of night along--\n      Ho, ho!--we have caught thee, Psilas!\n\nThe guests applauded loudly.  When the poet is your host, his verses are\nsure to charm.\n\n'Thoroughly Greek,' said Lepidus: 'the wildness, force, and energy of\nthat tongue, it is impossible to imitate in the Roman poetry.'\n\n'It is, indeed, a great contrast,' said Clodius, ironically at heart,\nthough not in appearance, 'to the old-fashioned and tame simplicity of\nthat ode of Horace which we heard before.  The air is beautifully Ionic:\nthe word puts me in mind of a toast--Companions, I give you the\nbeautiful Ione.'\n\n'Ione!--the name is Greek,' said Glaucus, in a soft voice.  'I drink the\nhealth with delight.  But who is Ione?'\n\n'Ah! you have but just come to Pompeii, or you would deserve ostracism\nfor your ignorance,' said Lepidus, conceitedly; 'not to know Ione, is\nnot to know the chief charm of our city.'\n\n'She is of the most rare beauty,' said Pansa; 'and what a voice!'\n\n'She can feed only on nightingales' tongues,' said Clodius.\n\n'Nightingales' tongues!--beautiful thought!' sighed the umbra.\n\n'Enlighten me, I beseech you,' said Glaucus.\n\n'Know then...' began Lepidus.\n\n'Let me speak,' cried Clodius; 'you drawl out your words as if you spoke\ntortoises.'\n\n'And you speak stones,' muttered the coxcomb to himself, as he fell back\ndisdainfully on his couch.\n\n'Know then, my Glaucus,' said Clodius, 'that Ione is a stranger who has\nbut lately come to Pompeii.  She sings like Sappho, and her songs are\nher own composing; and as for the tibia, and the cithara, and the lyre,\nI know not in which she most outdoes the Muses.  Her beauty is most\ndazzling.  Her house is perfect; such taste--such gems--such bronzes!\nShe is rich, and generous as she is rich.'\n\n'Her lovers, of course,' said Glaucus, 'take care that she does not\nstarve; and money lightly won is always lavishly spent.'\n\n'Her lovers--ah, there is the enigma!--Ione has but one vice--she is\nchaste. She has all Pompeii at her feet, and she has no lovers: she will\nnot even marry.'\n\n'No lovers!' echoed Glaucus.\n\n'No; she has the soul of Vestal with the girdle of Venus.'\n\n'What refined expressions!' said the umbra.\n\n'A miracle!' cried Glaucus.  'Can we not see her?'\n\n'I will take you there this evening, said Clodius; 'meanwhile...' added\nhe, once more rattling the dice.\n\n'I am yours!' said the complaisant Glaucus.  'Pansa, turn your face!'\n\nLepidus and Sallust played at odd and even, and the umbra looked on,\nwhile Glaucus and Clodius became gradually absorbed in the chances of\nthe dice.\n\n'By Pollux!' cried Glaucus, 'this is the second time I have thrown the\ncaniculae' (the lowest throw).\n\n'Now Venus befriend me!' said Clodius, rattling the box for several\nmoments. 'O Alma Venus--it is Venus herself!' as he threw the highest\ncast, named from that goddess--whom he who wins money, indeed, usually\npropitiates!\n\n'Venus is ungrateful to me,' said Glaucus, gaily; 'I have always\nsacrificed on her altar.'\n\n'He who plays with Clodius,' whispered Lepidus, 'will soon, like\nPlautus's Curculio, put his pallium for the stakes.'\n\n'Poor Glaucus!--he is as blind as Fortune herself,' replied Sallust, in\nthe same tone.\n\n'I will play no more,' said Glaucus; 'I have lost thirty sestertia.'\n\n'I am sorry...' began Clodius.\n\n'Amiable man!' groaned the umbra.\n\n'Not at all!' exclaimed Glaucus; 'the pleasure I take in your gain\ncompensates the pain of my loss.'\n\nThe conversation now grew general and animated; the wine circulated more\nfreely; and Ione once more became the subject of eulogy to the guests of\nGlaucus.\n\n'Instead of outwatching the stars, let us visit one at whose beauty the\nstars grow pale,' said Lepidus.\n\nClodius, who saw no chance of renewing the dice, seconded the proposal;\nand Glaucus, though he civilly pressed his guests to continue the\nbanquet, could not but let them see that his curiosity had been excited\nby the praises of Ione: they therefore resolved to adjourn (all, at\nleast, but Pansa and the umbra) to the house of the fair Greek.  They\ndrank, therefore, to the health of Glaucus and of Titus--they performed\ntheir last libation--they resumed their slippers--they descended the\nstairs--passed the illumined atrium--and walking unbitten over the\nfierce dog painted on the threshold, found themselves beneath the light\nof the moon just risen, in the lively and still crowded streets of\nPompeii.\n\nThey passed the jewellers' quarter, sparkling with lights, caught and\nreflected by the gems displayed in the shops, and arrived at last at the\ndoor of Ione.  The vestibule blazed with rows of lamps; curtains of\nembroidered purple hung on either aperture of the tablinum, whose walls\nand mosaic pavement glowed with the richest colors of the artist; and\nunder the portico which surrounded the odorous viridarium they found\nIone, already surrounded by adoring and applauding guests!\n\n'Did you say she was Athenian?' whispered Glaucus, ere he passed into\nthe peristyle.\n\n'No, she is from Neapolis.'\n\n'Neapolis!' echoed Glaucus; and at that moment the group, dividing on\neither side of Ione, gave to his view that bright, that nymph-like\nbeauty, which for months had shone down upon the waters of his memory.\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nTHE TEMPLE OF ISIS.  ITS PRIEST.  THE CHARACTER OF ARBACES DEVELOPS\nITSELF.\n\nTHE story returns to the Egyptian.  We left Arbaces upon the shores of\nthe noonday sea, after he had parted from Glaucus and his companion.  As\nhe approached to the more crowded part of the bay, he paused and gazed\nupon that animated scene with folded arms, and a bitter smile upon his\ndark features.\n\n'Gulls, dupes, fools, that ye are!' muttered he to himself; 'whether\nbusiness or pleasure, trade or religion, be your pursuit, you are\nequally cheated by the passions that ye should rule!  How I could loathe\nyou, if I did not hate--yes, hate!  Greek or Roman, it is from us, from\nthe dark lore of Egypt, that ye have stolen the fire that gives you\nsouls.  Your knowledge--your poesy--your laws--your arts--your barbarous\nmastery of war (all how tame and mutilated, when compared with the vast\noriginal!)--ye have filched, as a slave filches the fragments of the\nfeast, from us!  And now, ye mimics of a mimic!--Romans, forsooth! the\nmushroom herd of robbers! ye are our masters! the pyramids look down no\nmore on the race of Rameses--the eagle cowers over the serpent of the\nNile.  Our masters--no, not mine.  My soul, by the power of its wisdom,\ncontrols and chains you, though the fetters are unseen.  So long as\ncraft can master force, so long as religion has a cave from which\noracles can dupe mankind, the wise hold an empire over earth.  Even from\nyour vices Arbaces distills his pleasures--pleasures unprofaned by\nvulgar eyes--pleasures vast, wealthy, inexhaustible, of which your\nenervate minds, in their unimaginative sensuality, cannot conceive or\ndream!  Plod on, plod on, fools of ambition and of avarice! your petty\nthirst for fasces and quaestorships, and all the mummery of servile\npower, provokes my laughter and my scorn.  My power can extend wherever\nman believes.  I ride over the souls that the purple veils.  Thebes may\nfall, Egypt be a name; the world itself furnishes the subjects of\nArbaces.'\n\nThus saying, the Egyptian moved slowly on; and, entering the town, his\ntall figure towered above the crowded throng of the forum, and swept\ntowards the small but graceful temple consecrated to Isis.\n\nThat edifice was then but of recent erection; the ancient temple had\nbeen thrown down in the earthquake sixteen years before, and the new\nbuilding had become as much in vogue with the versatile Pompeians as a\nnew church or a new preacher may be with us.  The oracles of the goddess\nat Pompeii were indeed remarkable, not more for the mysterious language\nin which they were clothed, than for the credit which was attached to\ntheir mandates and predictions.  If they were not dictated by a\ndivinity, they were framed at least by a profound knowledge of mankind;\nthey applied themselves exactly to the circumstances of individuals, and\nmade a notable contrast to the vague and loose generalities of their\nrival temples.  As Arbaces now arrived at the rails which separated the\nprofane from the sacred place, a crowd, composed of all classes, but\nespecially of the commercial, collected, breathless and reverential,\nbefore the many altars which rose in the open court.  In the walls of\nthe cella, elevated on seven steps of Parian marble, various statues\nstood in niches, and those walls were ornamented with the pomegranate\nconsecrated to Isis.  An oblong pedestal occupied the interior building,\non which stood two statues, one of Isis, and its companion represented\nthe silent and mystic Orus.  But the building contained many other\ndeities to grace the court of the Egyptian deity: her kindred and\nmany-titled Bacchus, and the Cyprian Venus, a Grecian disguise for\nherself, rising from her bath, and the dog-headed Anubis, and the ox\nApis, and various Egyptian idols of uncouth form and unknown\nappellations.\n\nBut we must not suppose that among the cities of Magna Graecia, Isis was\nworshipped with those forms and ceremonies which were of right her own.\nThe mongrel and modern nations of the South, with a mingled arrogance\nand ignorance, confounded the worships of all climes and ages.  And the\nprofound mysteries of the Nile were degraded by a hundred meretricious\nand frivolous admixtures from the creeds of Cephisus and of Tibur.  The\ntemple of Isis in Pompeii was served by Roman and Greek priests,\nignorant alike of the language and the customs of her ancient votaries;\nand the descendant of the dread Egyptian kings, beneath the appearance\nof reverential awe, secretly laughed to scorn the puny mummeries which\nimitated the solemn and typical worship of his burning clime.\n\nRanged now on either side the steps was the sacrificial crowd, arrayed\nin white garments, while at the summit stood two of the inferior\npriests, the one holding a palm branch, the other a slender sheaf of\ncorn.  In the narrow passage in front thronged the bystanders.\n\n'And what,' whispered Arbaces to one of the bystanders, who was a\nmerchant engaged in the Alexandrian trade, which trade had probably\nfirst introduced in Pompeii the worship of the Egyptian goddess--'what\noccasion now assembles you before the altars of the venerable Isis?  It\nseems, by the white robes of the group before me, that a sacrifice is to\nbe rendered; and by the assembly of the priests, that ye are prepared\nfor some oracle.  To what question is it to vouchsafe a reply?'\n\n'We are merchants,' replied the bystander (who was no other than Diomed)\nin the same voice, 'who seek to know the fate of our vessels, which sail\nfor Alexandria to-morrow.  We are about to offer up a sacrifice and\nimplore an answer from the goddess.  I am not one of those who have\npetitioned the priest to sacrifice, as you may see by my dress, but I\nhave some interest in the success of the fleet--by Jupiter! yes.  I have\na pretty trade, else how could I live in these hard times?\n\nThe Egyptian replied gravely--'That though Isis was properly the goddess\nof agriculture, she was no less the patron of commerce.' Then turning\nhis head towards the east, Arbaces seemed absorbed in silent prayer.\n\nAnd now in the centre of the steps appeared a priest robed in white from\nhead to foot, the veil parting over the crown; two new priests relieved\nthose hitherto stationed at either corner, being naked half-way down to\nthe breast, and covered, for the rest, in white and loose robes.  At the\nsame time, seated at the bottom of the steps, a priest commenced a\nsolemn air upon a long wind-instrument of music.  Half-way down the\nsteps stood another flamen, holding in one hand the votive wreath, in\nthe other a white wand; while, adding to the picturesque scene of that\neastern ceremony, the stately ibis (bird sacred to the Egyptian worship)\nlooked mutely down from the wall upon the rite, or stalked beside the\naltar at the base of the steps.\n\nAt that altar now stood the sacrificial flamen.\n\nThe countenance of Arbaces seemed to lose all its rigid calm while the\naruspices inspected the entrails, and to be intent in pious anxiety--to\nrejoice and brighten as the signs were declared favorable, and the fire\nbegan bright and clearly to consume the sacred portion of the victim\namidst odorous of myrrh and frankincense.  It was then that a dead\nsilence fell over the whispering crowd, and the priests gathering round\nthe cella, another priest, naked save by a cincture round the middle,\nrushed forward, and dancing with wild gestures, implored an answer from\nthe goddess.  He ceased at last in exhaustion, and a low murmuring noise\nwas heard within the body of the statue: thrice the head moved, and the\nlips parted, and then a hollow voice uttered these mystic words:\n\n  There are waves like chargers that meet and glow,\n  There are graves ready wrought in the rocks below,\n  On the brow of the future the dangers lour,\n  But blest are your barks in the fearful hour.\n\nThe voice ceased--the crowd breathed more freely--the merchants looked\nat each other.  'Nothing can be more plain,' murmured Diomed; 'there is\nto be a storm at sea, as there very often is at the beginning of autumn,\nbut our vessels are to be saved.  O beneficent Isis!'\n\n'Lauded eternally be the goddess!' said the merchants: 'what can be less\nequivocal than her prediction?'\n\nRaising one hand in sign of silence to the people, for the rites of Isis\nenjoined what to the lively Pompeians was an impossible suspense from\nthe use of the vocal organs, the chief priest poured his libation on the\naltar, and after a short concluding prayer the ceremony was over, and\nthe congregation dismissed.  Still, however, as the crowd dispersed\nthemselves here and there, the Egyptian lingered by the railing, and\nwhen the space became tolerably cleared, one of the priests, approaching\nit, saluted him with great appearance of friendly familiarity.\n\nThe countenance of the priest was remarkably unprepossessing--his shaven\nskull was so low and narrow in the front as nearly to approach to the\nconformation of that of an African savage, save only towards the\ntemples, where, in that organ styled acquisitiveness by the pupils of a\nscience modern in name, but best practically known (as their sculpture\nteaches us) amongst the ancients, two huge and almost preternatural\nprotuberances yet more distorted the unshapely head--around the brows\nthe skin was puckered into a web of deep and intricate wrinkles--the\neyes, dark and small, rolled in a muddy and yellow orbit--the nose,\nshort yet coarse, was distended at the nostrils like a satyr's--and the\nthick but pallid lips, the high cheek-bones, the livid and motley hues\nthat struggled through the parchment skin, completed a countenance which\nnone could behold without repugnance, and few without terror and\ndistrust: whatever the wishes of the mind, the animal frame was well\nfitted to execute them; the wiry muscles of the throat, the broad chest,\nthe nervous hands and lean gaunt arms, which were bared above the elbow,\nbetokened a form capable alike of great active exertion and passive\nendurance.\n\n'Calenus,' said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen, 'you have\nimproved the voice of the statue much by attending to my suggestion; and\nyour verses are excellent.  Always prophesy good fortune, unless there\nis an absolute impossibility of its fulfilment.'\n\n'Besides,' added Calenus, 'if the storm does come, and if it does\noverwhelm the accursed ships, have we not prophesied it? and are the\nbarks not blest to be at rest?--for rest prays the mariner in the AEgean\nsea, or at least so says Horace--can the mariner be more at rest in the\nsea than when he is at the bottom of it?'\n\n'Right, my Calenus; I wish Apaecides would take a lesson from your\nwisdom. But I desire to confer with you relative to him and to other\nmatters: you can admit me into one of your less sacred apartments?'\n\n'Assuredly,' replied the priest, leading the way to one of the small\nchambers which surrounded the open gate.  Here they seated themselves\nbefore a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs, and\nvarious cold meats, with vases of excellent wine, of which while the\ncompanions partook, a curtain, drawn across the entrance opening to the\ncourt, concealed them from view, but admonished them by the thinness of\nthe partition to speak low, or to speak no secrets: they chose the\nformer alternative.\n\n'Thou knowest,' said Arbaces, in a voice that scarcely stirred the air,\nso soft and inward was its sound, 'that it has ever been my maxim to\nattach myself to the young.  From their flexile and unformed minds I can\ncarve out my fittest tools.  I weave--I warp--I mould them at my will.\nOf the men I make merely followers or servants; of the women...'\n\n'Mistresses,' said Calenus, as a livid grin distorted his ungainly\nfeatures.\n\n'Yes, I do not disguise it: woman is the main object, the great\nappetite, of my soul.  As you feed the victim for the slaughter, I love\nto rear the votaries of my pleasure.  I love to train, to ripen their\nminds--to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions, in order to\nprepare the fruit to my taste.  I loathe your ready-made and ripened\ncourtesans; it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence to\ndesire that I find the true charm of love; it is thus that I defy\nsatiety; and by contemplating the freshness of others, I sustain the\nfreshness of my own sensations.  From the young hearts of my victims I\ndraw the ingredients of the caldron in which I re-youth myself.  But\nenough of this: to the subject before us.  You know, then, that in\nNeapolis some time since I encountered Ione and Apaecides, brother and\nsister, the children of Athenians who had settled at Neapolis. The death\nof their parents, who knew and esteemed me, constituted me their\nguardian.  I was not unmindful of the trust. The youth, docile and mild,\nyielded readily to the impression I sought to stamp upon him.  Next to\nwoman, I love the old recollections of my ancestral land; I love to keep\nalive--to propagate on distant shores (which her colonies perchance yet\npeople) her dark and mystic creeds.  It may be, that it pleases me to\ndelude mankind, while I thus serve the deities.  To Apaecides I taught\nthe solemn faith of Isis.  I unfolded to him something of those sublime\nallegories which are couched beneath her worship.  I excited in a soul\npeculiarly alive to religious fervor that enthusiasm which imagination\nbegets on faith.  I have placed him amongst you: he is one of you.'\n\n'He is so,' said Calenus: 'but in thus stimulating his faith, you have\nrobbed him of wisdom.  He is horror-struck that he is no longer duped:\nour sage delusions, our speaking statues and secret staircases dismay\nand revolt him; he pines; he wastes away; he mutters to himself; he\nrefuses to share our ceremonies.  He has been known to frequent the\ncompany of men suspected of adherence to that new and atheistical creed\nwhich denies all our gods, and terms our oracles the inspirations of\nthat malevolent spirit of which eastern tradition speaks.  Our\noracles--alas! we know well whose inspirations they are!'\n\n'This is what I feared,' said Arbaces, musingly, 'from various\nreproaches he made me when I last saw him.  Of late he hath shunned my\nsteps.  I must find him: I must continue my lessons: I must lead him\ninto the adytum of Wisdom. I must teach him that there are two stages of\nsanctity--the first, FAITH--the next, DELUSION; the one for the vulgar,\nthe second for the sage.'\n\n'I never passed through the first, I said Calenus; 'nor you either, I\nthink, my Arbaces.'\n\n'You err,' replied the Egyptian, gravely.  'I believe at this day (not\nindeed that which I teach, but that which I teach not).  Nature has a\nsanctity against which I cannot (nor would I) steel conviction.  I\nbelieve in mine own knowledge, and that has revealed to me--but no\nmatter.  Now to earthlier and more inviting themes.  If I thus fulfilled\nmy object with Apaecides, what was my design for Ione?  Thou knowest\nalready I intend her for my queen--my bride--my heart's Isis.  Never\ntill I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable.'\n\n'I hear from a thousand lips that she is a second Helen,' said Calenus;\nand he smacked his own lips, but whether at the wine or at the notion it\nis not easy to decide.\n\n'Yes, she has a beauty that Greece itself never excelled,' resumed\nArbaces. 'But that is not all: she has a soul worthy to match with mine.\nShe has a genius beyond that of woman--keen--dazzling--bold. Poetry\nflows spontaneous to her lips: utter but a truth, and, however intricate\nand profound, her mind seizes and commands it.  Her imagination and her\nreason are not at war with each other; they harmonize and direct her\ncourse as the winds and the waves direct some lofty bark.  With this she\nunites a daring independence of thought; she can stand alone in the\nworld; she can be brave as she is gentle; this is the nature I have\nsought all my life in woman, and never found till now.  Ione must be\nmine!  In her I have a double passion; I wish to enjoy a beauty of\nspirit as of form.'\n\n'She is not yours yet, then?' said the priest.\n\n'No; she loves me--but as a friend--she loves me with her mind only.\nShe fancies in me the paltry virtues which I have only the profounder\nvirtue to disdain.  But you must pursue with me her history. The brother\nand sister were young and rich: Ione is proud and ambitious--proud of\nher genius--the magic of her poetry--the charm of her conversation.\nWhen her brother left me, and entered your temple, in order to be near\nhim she removed also to Pompeii.  She has suffered her talents to be\nknown.  She summons crowds to her feasts; her voice enchants them; her\npoetry subdues.  She delights in being thought the successor of Erinna.'\n\n'Or of Sappho?'\n\n'But Sappho without love!  I encouraged her in this boldness of\ncareer--in this indulgence of vanity and of pleasure.  I loved to steep\nher amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city.  Mark me,\nCalenus!  I desired to enervate her mind!--it has been too pure to\nreceive yet the breath which I wish not to pass, but burningly to eat\ninto, the mirror.  I wished her to be surrounded by lovers, hollow,\nvain, and frivolous (lovers that her nature must despise), in order to\nfeel the want of love.  Then, in those soft intervals of lassitude\nthat succeed to excitement--I can weave my spells--excite her\ninterest--attract her passions--possess myself of her heart.  For it is\nnot the young, nor the beautiful, nor the gay, that should fascinate\nIone; her imagination must be won, and the life of Arbaces has been one\nscene of triumph over the imaginations of his kind.'\n\n'And hast thou no fear, then, of thy rivals?  The gallants of Italy are\nskilled in the art to please.'\n\n'None!  Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans, and would scorn\nitself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race.'\n\n'But thou art an Egyptian, not a Greek!'\n\n'Egypt,' replied Arbaces, 'is the mother of Athens.  Her tutelary\nMinerva is our deity; and her founder, Cecrops, was the fugitive of\nEgyptian Sais. This have I already taught to her; and in my blood she\nvenerates the eldest dynasties of earth.  But yet I will own that of\nlate some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind.  She is more silent\nthan she used to be; she loves melancholy and subduing music; she sighs\nwithout an outward cause.  This may be the beginning of love--it may be\nthe want of love.  In either case it is time for me to begin my\noperations on her fancies and her heart: in the one case, to divert the\nsource of love to me; in the other, in me to awaken it. It is for this\nthat I have sought you.'\n\n'And how can I assist you?'\n\n'I am about to invite her to a feast in my house: I wish to dazzle--to\nbewilder--to inflame her senses.  Our arts--the arts by which Egypt\ntrained her young novitiates--must be employed; and, under veil of the\nmysteries of religion, I will open to her the secrets of love.'\n\n'Ah! now I understand:--one of those voluptuous banquets that, despite\nour dull vows of mortified coldness, we, the priests of Isis, have\nshared at thy house.'\n\n'No, no!  Thinkest thou her chaste eyes are ripe for such scenes? No;\nbut first we must ensnare the brother--an easier task.  Listen to me,\nwhile I give you my instructions.'\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nMORE OF THE FLOWER-GIRL.  THE PROGRESS OF LOVE.\n\nTHE sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber in the house of Glaucus,\nwhich I have before said is now called the 'Room of Leda'.  The morning\nrays entered through rows of small casements at the higher part of the\nroom, and through the door which opened on the garden, that answered to\nthe inhabitants of the southern cities the same purpose that a\ngreenhouse or conservatory does to us.  The size of the garden did not\nadapt it for exercise, but the various and fragrant plants with which it\nwas filled gave a luxury to that indolence so dear to the dwellers in a\nsunny clime.  And now the odorous, fanned by a gentle wind creeping from\nthe adjacent sea, scattered themselves over that chamber, whose walls\nvied with the richest colors of the most glowing flowers.  Besides the\ngem of the room--the painting of Leda and Tyndarus--in the centre of\neach compartment of the walls were set other pictures of exquisite\nbeauty.  In one you saw Cupid leaning on the knees of Venus; in another\nAriadne sleeping on the beach, unconscious of the perfidy of Theseus.\nMerrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and the\nbrilliant walls--far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart of\nthe young Glaucus.\n\n'I have seen her, then,' said he, as he paced that narrow chamber--'I\nhave heard her--nay, I have spoken to her again--I have listened to the\nmusic of her song, and she sung of glory and of Greece.  I have\ndiscovered the long-sought idol of my dreams; and like the Cyprian\nsculptor, I have breathed life into my own imaginings.'\n\nLonger, perhaps, had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus, but at\nthat moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a young\nfemale, still half a child in years, broke upon his solitude.  She was\ndressed simply in a white tunic, which reached from the neck to the\nankles; under her arm she bore a basket of flowers, and in the other\nhand she held a bronze water-vase; her features were more formed than\nexactly became her years, yet they were soft and feminine in their\noutline, and without being beautiful in themselves, they were almost\nmade so by their beauty of expression; there was something ineffably\ngentle, and you would say patient, in her aspect.  A look of resigned\nsorrow, of tranquil endurance, had banished the smile, but not the\nsweetness, from her lips; something timid and cautious in her\nstep--something wandering in her eyes, led you to suspect the affliction\nwhich she had suffered from her birth--she was blind; but in the orbs\nthemselves there was no visible defect--their melancholy and subdued\nlight was clear, cloudless, and serene. 'They tell me that Glaucus is\nhere,' said she; 'may I come in?'\n\n'Ah, my Nydia,' said the Greek, 'is that you I knew you would not\nneglect my invitation.'\n\n'Glaucus did but justice to himself,' answered Nydia, with a blush; 'for\nhe has always been kind to the poor blind girl.'\n\n'Who could be otherwise?' said Glaucus, tenderly, and in the voice of a\ncompassionate brother.\n\nNydia sighed and paused before she resumed, without replying to his\nremark. 'You have but lately returned?'\n\n'This is the sixth sun that hath shone upon me at Pompeii.'\n\n'And you are well?  Ah, I need not ask--for who that sees the earth,\nwhich they tell me is so beautiful, can be ill?'\n\n'I am well.  And you, Nydia--how you have grown!  Next year you will be\nthinking what answer to make your lovers.'\n\nA second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia, but this time she frowned\nas she blushed.  'I have brought you some flowers,' said she, without\nreplying to a remark that she seemed to resent; and feeling about the\nroom till she found the table that stood by Glaucus, she laid the basket\nupon it: 'they are poor, but they are fresh-gathered.'\n\n'They might come from Flora herself,' said he, kindly; 'and I renew\nagain my vow to the Graces, that I will wear no other garlands while thy\nhands can weave me such as these.'\n\n'And how find you the flowers in your viridarium?--are they thriving?'\n\n'Wonderfully so--the Lares themselves must have tended them.'\n\n'Ah, now you give me pleasure; for I came, as often as I could steal the\nleisure, to water and tend them in your absence.'\n\n'How shall I thank thee, fair Nydia?' said the Greek.  'Glaucus little\ndreamed that he left one memory so watchful over his favorites at\nPompeii.'\n\nThe hand of the child trembled, and her breast heaved beneath her tunic.\nShe turned round in embarrassment.  'The sun is hot for the poor\nflowers,' said she, 'to-day and they will miss me; for I have been ill\nlately, and it is nine days since I visited them.'\n\n'Ill, Nydia!--yet your cheek has more color than it had last year.'\n\n'I am often ailing,' said the blind girl, touchingly; 'and as I grow up\nI grieve more that I am blind.  But now to the flowers!' So saying, she\nmade a slight reverence with her head, and passing into the viridarium,\nbusied herself with watering the flowers.\n\n'Poor Nydia,' thought Glaucus, gazing on her; 'thine is a hard doom!\nThou seest not the earth--nor the sun--nor the ocean--nor the\nstars--above all, thou canst not behold Ione.'\n\nAt that last thought his mind flew back to the past evening, and was a\nsecond time disturbed in its reveries by the entrance of Clodius.  It\nwas a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and to\nrefine the love of the Athenian for Ione, that whereas he had confided\nto Clodius the secret of his first interview with her, and the effect it\nhad produced on him, he now felt an invincible aversion even to mention\nto him her name.  He had seen Ione, bright, pure, unsullied, in the\nmidst of the gayest and most profligate gallants of Pompeii, charming\nrather than awing the boldest into respect, and changing the very nature\nof the most sensual and the least ideal--as by her intellectual and\nrefining spells she reversed the fable of Circe, and converted the\nanimals into men.  They who could not understand her soul were made\nspiritual, as it were, by the magic of her beauty--they who had no heart\nfor poetry had ears, at least, for the melody of her voice. Seeing her\nthus surrounded, purifying and brightening all things with her presence,\nGlaucus almost for the first time felt the nobleness of his own\nnature--he felt how unworthy of the goddess of his dreams had been his\ncompanions and his pursuits.  A veil seemed lifted from his eyes; he saw\nthat immeasurable distance between himself and his associates which the\ndeceiving mists of pleasure had hitherto concealed; he was refined by a\nsense of his courage in aspiring to Ione.  He felt that henceforth it\nwas his destiny to look upward and to soar.  He could no longer breathe\nthat name, which sounded to the sense of his ardent fancy as something\nsacred and divine, to lewd and vulgar ears.  She was no longer the\nbeautiful girl once seen and passionately remembered--she was already\nthe mistress, the divinity of his soul.  This feeling who has not\nexperienced?--If thou hast not, then thou hast never loved.\n\nWhen Clodius therefore spoke to him in affected transport of the beauty\nof Ione, Glaucus felt only resentment and disgust that such lips should\ndare to praise her; he answered coldly, and the Roman imagined that his\npassion was cured instead of heightened.  Clodius scarcely regretted it,\nfor he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richly\nendowed--Julia, the daughter of the wealthy Diomed, whose gold the\ngamester imagined he could readily divert into his own coffers.  Their\nconversation did not flow with its usual ease; and no sooner had Clodius\nleft him than Glaucus bent his way to the house of Ione.  In passing by\nthe threshold he again encountered Nydia, who had finished her graceful\ntask.  She knew his step on the instant.\n\n'You are early abroad?' said she.\n\n'Yes; for the skies of Campania rebuke the sluggard who neglects them.'\n\n'Ah, would I could see them!' murmured the blind girl, but so low that\nGlaucus did not overhear the complaint.\n\nThe Thessalian lingered on the threshold a few moments, and then guiding\nher steps by a long staff, which she used with great dexterity, she took\nher way homeward.  She soon turned from the more gaudy streets, and\nentered a quarter of the town but little loved by the decorous and the\nsober.  But from the low and rude evidences of vice around her she was\nsaved by her misfortune.  And at that hour the streets were quiet and\nsilent, nor was her youthful ear shocked by the sounds which too often\nbroke along the obscene and obscure haunts she patiently and sadly\ntraversed.\n\nShe knocked at the back-door of a sort of tavern; it opened, and a rude\nvoice bade her give an account of the sesterces.  Ere she could reply,\nanother voice, less vulgarly accented, said:\n\n'Never mind those petty profits, my Burbo.  The girl's voice will be\nwanted again soon at our rich friend's revels; and he pays, as thou\nknowest, pretty high for his nightingales' tongues.\n\n'Oh, I hope not--I trust not,' cried Nydia, trembling.  'I will beg from\nsunrise to sunset, but send me not there.'\n\n'And why?' asked the same voice.\n\n'Because--because I am young, and delicately born, and the female\ncompanions I meet there are not fit associates for one who--who...'\n\n'Is a slave in the house of Burbo,' returned the voice ironically, and\nwith a coarse laugh.\n\nThe Thessalian put down the flowers, and, leaning her face on her hands,\nwept silently.\n\nMeanwhile, Glaucus sought the house of the beautiful Neapolitan. He\nfound Ione sitting amidst her attendants, who were at work around her.\nHer harp stood at her side, for Ione herself was unusually idle, perhaps\nunusually thoughtful, that day.  He thought her even more beautiful by\nthe morning light and in her simple robe, than amidst the blazing lamps,\nand decorated with the costly jewels of the previous night: not the less\nso from a certain paleness that overspread her transparent hues--not the\nless so from the blush that mounted over them when he approached.\nAccustomed to flatter, flattery died upon his lips when he addressed\nIone.  He felt it beneath her to utter the homage which every look\nconveyed.  They spoke of Greece; this was a theme on which Ione loved\nrather to listen than to converse: it was a theme on which the Greek\ncould have been eloquent for ever.  He described to her the silver olive\ngroves that yet clad the banks of Ilyssus, and the temples, already\ndespoiled of half their glories--but how beautiful in decay!  He looked\nback on the melancholy city of Harmodius the free, and Pericles the\nmagnificent, from the height of that distant memory, which mellowed into\none hazy light all the ruder and darker shades.  He had seen the land of\npoetry chiefly in the poetical age of early youth; and the associations\nof patriotism were blended with those of the flush and spring of life.\nAnd Ione listened to him, absorbed and mute; dearer were those accents,\nand those descriptions, than all the prodigal adulation of her\nnumberless adorers.  Was it a sin to love her countryman? she loved\nAthens in him--the gods of her race, the land of her dreams, spoke to\nher in his voice!  From that time they daily saw each other.  At the\ncool of the evening they made excursions on the placid sea.  By night\nthey met again in Ione's porticoes and halls.  Their love was sudden,\nbut it was strong; it filled all the sources of their life.\nHeart--brain--sense--imagination, all were its ministers and priests.\nAs you take some obstacle from two objects that have a mutual\nattraction, they met, and united at once; their wonder was, that they\nhad lived separate so long.  And it was natural that they should so\nlove.  Young, beautiful, and gifted--of the same birth, and the same\nsoul--there was poetry in their very union.  They imagined the heavens\nsmiled upon their affection.  As the persecuted seek refuge at the\nshrine, so they recognized in the altar of their love an asylum from the\nsorrows of earth; they covered it with flowers--they knew not of the\nserpents that lay coiled behind.\n\nOne evening, the fifth after their first meeting at Pompeii, Glaucus and\nIone, with a small party of chosen friends, were returning from an\nexcursion round the bay; their vessel skimmed lightly over the twilight\nwaters, whose lucid mirror was only broken by the dripping oars.  As the\nrest of the party conversed gaily with each other, Glaucus lay at the\nfeet of Ione, and he would have looked up in her face, but he did not\ndare.  Ione broke the pause between them.\n\n'My poor brother,' said she, sighing, 'how once he would have enjoyed\nthis hour!'\n\n'Your brother!' said Glaucus; 'I have not seen him.  Occupied with you,\nI have thought of nothing else, or I should have asked if that was not\nyour brother for whose companionship you left me at the Temple of\nMinerva, in Neapolis?'\n\n'It was.'\n\n'And is he here?'\n\n'He is.\n\n'At Pompeii! and not constantly with you?  Impossible!'\n\n'He has other duties,' answered Ione, sadly; 'he is a priest of Isis.'\n\n'So young, too; and that priesthood, in its laws at least, so severe!'\nsaid the warm and bright-hearted Greek, in surprise and pity. 'What\ncould have been his inducement?'\n\n'He was always enthusiastic and fervent in religious devotion: and the\neloquence of an Egyptian--our friend and guardian--kindled in him the\npious desire to consecrate his life to the most mystic of our deities.\nPerhaps in the intenseness of his zeal, he found in the severity of that\npeculiar priesthood its peculiar attraction.'\n\n'And he does not repent his choice?--I trust he is happy.'\n\nIone sighed deeply, and lowered her veil over her eyes.\n\n'I wish,' said she, after a pause, 'that he had not been so hasty.\nPerhaps, like all who expect too much, he is revolted too easily!'\n\n'Then he is not happy in his new condition.  And this Egyptian, was he a\npriest himself? was he interested in recruits to the sacred band?\n\n'No.  His main interest was in our happiness.  He thought he promoted\nthat of my brother.  We were left orphans.'\n\n'Like myself,' said Glaucus, with a deep meaning in his voice.\n\nIone cast down her eyes as she resumed:\n\n'And Arbaces sought to supply the place of our parent.  You must know\nhim. He loves genius.'\n\n'Arbaces! I know him already; at least, we speak when we meet.  But for\nyour praise I would not seek to know more of him.  My heart inclines\nreadily to most of my kind.  But that dark Egyptian, with his gloomy\nbrow and icy smiles, seems to me to sadden the very sun. One would think\nthat, like Epimenides, the Cretan, he had spent forty years in a cave,\nand had found something unnatural in the daylight ever afterwards.'\n\n'Yet, like Epimenides, he is kind, and wise, and gentle,' answered Ione.\n\n'Oh, happy that he has thy praise!  He needs no other virtues to make\nhim dear to me.'\n\n'His calm, his coldness,' said Ione, evasively pursuing the subject,\n'are perhaps but the exhaustion of past sufferings; as yonder mountain\n(and she pointed to Vesuvius), which we see dark and tranquil in the\ndistance, once nursed the fires for ever quenched.'\n\nThey both gazed on the mountain as Ione said these words; the rest of\nthe sky was bathed in rosy and tender hues, but over that grey summit,\nrising amidst the woods and vineyards that then clomb half-way up the\nascent, there hung a black and ominous cloud, the single frown of the\nlandscape.  A sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each as they thus\ngazed; and in that sympathy which love had already taught them, and\nwhich bade them, in the slightest shadows of emotion, the faintest\npresentiment of evil, turn for refuge to each other, their gaze at the\nsame moment left the mountain, and full of unimaginable tenderness, met.\nWhat need had they of words to say they loved?\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nTHE FOWLER SNARES AGAIN THE BIRD THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED, AND SETS HIS\nNETS FOR A NEW VICTIM.\n\nIN the history I relate, the events are crowded and rapid as those of\nthe drama.  I write of an epoch in which days sufficed to ripen the\nordinary fruits of years.\n\nMeanwhile, Arbaces had not of late much frequented the house of Ione;\nand when he had visited her he had not encountered Glaucus, nor knew he,\nas yet, of that love which had so suddenly sprung up between himself and\nhis designs.  In his interest for the brother of Ione, he had been\nforced, too, a little while, to suspend his interest in Ione herself.\nHis pride and his selfishness were aroused and alarmed at the sudden\nchange which had come over the spirit of the youth.  He trembled lest he\nhimself should lose a docile pupil, and Isis an enthusiastic servant.\nApaecides had ceased to seek or to consult him.  He was rarely to be\nfound; he turned sullenly from the Egyptian--nay, he fled when he\nperceived him in the distance. Arbaces was one of those haughty and\npowerful spirits accustomed to master others; he chafed at the notion\nthat one once his own should ever elude his grasp. He swore inly that\nApaecides should not escape him.\n\nIt was with this resolution that he passed through a thick grove in the\ncity, which lay between his house and that of Ione, in his way to the\nlatter; and there, leaning against a tree, and gazing on the ground, he\ncame unawares on the young priest of Isis.\n\n'Apaecides!' said he--and he laid his hand affectionately on the young\nman's shoulder.\n\nThe priest started; and his first instinct seemed to be that of flight.\n'My son,' said the Egyptian, 'what has chanced that you desire to shun\nme?'\n\nApaecides remained silent and sullen, looking down on the earth, as his\nlips quivered, and his breast heaved with emotion.\n\n'Speak to me, my friend,' continued the Egyptian.  'Speak. Something\nburdens thy spirit.  What hast thou to reveal?'\n\n'To thee--nothing.'\n\n'And why is it to me thou art thus unconfidential?'\n\n'Because thou hast been my enemy.'\n\n'Let us confer,' said Arbaces, in a low voice; and drawing the reluctant\narm of the priest in his own, he led him to one of the seats which were\nscattered within the grove.  They sat down--and in those gloomy forms\nthere was something congenial to the shade and solitude of the place.\n\nApaecides was in the spring of his years, yet he seemed to have\nexhausted even more of life than the Egyptian; his delicate and regular\nfeatures were worn and colorless; his eyes were hollow, and shone with a\nbrilliant and feverish glare: his frame bowed prematurely, and in his\nhands, which were small to effeminacy, the blue and swollen veins\nindicated the lassitude and weakness of the relaxed fibres.  You saw in\nhis face a strong resemblance to Ione, but the expression was altogether\ndifferent from that majestic and spiritual calm which breathed so divine\nand classical a repose over his sister's beauty.  In her, enthusiasm was\nvisible, but it seemed always suppressed and restrained; this made the\ncharm and sentiment of her countenance; you longed to awaken a spirit\nwhich reposed, but evidently did not sleep.  In Apaecides the whole\naspect betokened the fervor and passion of his temperament, and the\nintellectual portion of his nature seemed, by the wild fire of the eyes,\nthe great breadth of the temples when compared with the height of the\nbrow, the trembling restlessness of the lips, to be swayed and\ntyrannized over by the imaginative and ideal.  Fancy, with the sister,\nhad stopped short at the golden goal of poetry; with the brother, less\nhappy and less restrained, it had wandered into visions more intangible\nand unembodied; and the faculties which gave genius to the one\nthreatened madness to the other.\n\n'You say I have been your enemy,' said Arbaces, 'I know the cause of\nthat unjust accusation: I have placed you amidst the priests of\nIsis--you are revolted at their trickeries and imposture--you think that\nI too have deceived you--the purity of your mind is offended--you\nimagine that I am one of the deceitful...'\n\n'You knew the jugglings of that impious craft,' answered Apaecides; 'why\ndid you disguise them from me?--When you excited my desire to devote\nmyself to the office whose garb I bear, you spoke to me of the holy life\nof men resigning themselves to knowledge--you have given me for\ncompanions an ignorant and sensual herd, who have no knowledge but that\nof the grossest frauds; you spoke to me of men sacrificing the earthlier\npleasures to the sublime cultivation of virtue--you place me amongst men\nreeking with all the filthiness of vice; you spoke to me of the friends,\nthe enlighteners of our common kind--I see but their cheats and\ndeluders!  Oh!  it was basely done!--you have robbed me of the glory of\nyouth, of the convictions of virtue, of the sanctifying thirst after\nwisdom.  Young as I was, rich, fervent, the sunny pleasures of earth\nbefore me, I resigned all without a sign, nay, with happiness and\nexultation, in the thought that I resigned them for the abstruse\nmysteries of diviner wisdom, for the companionship of gods--for the\nrevelations of Heaven--and now--now...'\n\nConvulsive sobs checked the priest's voice; he covered his face with his\nhands, and large tears forced themselves through the wasted fingers, and\nran profusely down his vest.\n\n'What I promised to thee, that will I give, my friend, my pupil: these\nhave been but trials to thy virtue--it comes forth the brighter for thy\nnovitiate--think no more of those dull cheats--assort no more with those\nmenials of the goddess, the atrienses of her hall--you are worthy to\nenter into the penetralia.  I henceforth will be your priest, your\nguide, and you who now curse my friendship shall live to bless it.'\n\nThe young man lifted up his head, and gazed with a vacant and wondering\nstare upon the Egyptian.\n\n'Listen to me,' continued Arbaces, in an earnest and solemn voice,\ncasting first his searching eyes around to see that they were still\nalone.  'From Egypt came all the knowledge of the world; from Egypt came\nthe lore of Athens, and the profound policy of Crete; from Egypt came\nthose early and mysterious tribes which (long before the hordes of\nRomulus swept over the plains of Italy, and in the eternal cycle of\nevents drove back civilization into barbarism and darkness) possessed\nall the arts of wisdom and the graces of intellectual life.  From Egypt\ncame the rites and the grandeur of that solemn Caere, whose inhabitants\ntaught their iron vanquishers of Rome all that they yet know of elevated\nin religion and sublime in worship.  And how deemest thou, young man,\nthat that Egypt, the mother of countless nations, achieved her\ngreatness, and soared to her cloud-capt eminence of wisdom?--It was the\nresult of a profound and holy policy.  Your modern nations owe their\ngreatness to Egypt--Egypt her greatness to her priests.  Rapt in\nthemselves, coveting a sway over the nobler part of man, his soul and\nhis belief, those ancient ministers of God were inspired with the\ngrandest thought that ever exalted mortals.  From the revolutions of the\nstars, from the seasons of the earth, from the round and unvarying\ncircle of human destinies, they devised an august allegory; they made it\ngross and palpable to the vulgar by the signs of gods and goddesses, and\nthat which in reality was Government they named Religion.  Isis is a\nfable--start not!--that for which Isis is a type is a reality, an\nimmortal being; Isis is nothing.  Nature, which she represents, is the\nmother of all things--dark, ancient, inscrutable, save to the gifted\nfew.  \"None among mortals hath ever lifted up my veil,\" so saith the\nIsis that you adore; but to the wise that veil hath been removed, and we\nhave stood face to face with the solemn loveliness of Nature.  The\npriests then were the benefactors, the civilizers of mankind; true, they\nwere also cheats, impostors if you will.  But think you, young man, that\nif they had not deceived their kind they could have served them?  The\nignorant and servile vulgar must be blinded to attain to their proper\ngood; they would not believe a maxim--they revere an oracle.  The\nEmperor of Rome sways the vast and various tribes of earth, and\nharmonizes the conflicting and disunited elements; thence come peace,\norder, law, the blessings of life. Think you it is the man, the emperor,\nthat thus sways?--no, it is the pomp, the awe, the majesty that surround\nhim--these are his impostures, his delusions; our oracles and our\ndivinations, our rites and our ceremonies, are the means of our\nsovereignty and the engines of our power.  They are the same means to\nthe same end, the welfare and harmony of mankind.  You listen to me rapt\nand intent--the light begins to dawn upon you.'\n\nApaecides remained silent, but the changes rapidly passing over his\nspeaking countenance betrayed the effect produced upon him by the words\nof the Egyptian--words made tenfold more eloquent by the voice, the\naspect, and the manner of the man.\n\n'While, then,' resumed Arbaces, 'our fathers of the Nile thus achieved\nthe first elements by whose life chaos is destroyed, namely, the\nobedience and reverence of the multitude for the few, they drew from\ntheir majestic and starred meditations that wisdom which was no\ndelusion: they invented the codes and regularities of law--the arts and\nglories of existence.  They asked belief; they returned the gift by\ncivilization.  Were not their very cheats a virtue!  Trust me, whosoever\nin yon far heavens of a diviner and more beneficent nature look down\nupon our world, smile approvingly on the wisdom which has worked such\nends.  But you wish me to apply these generalities to yourself; I hasten\nto obey the wish.  The altars of the goddess of our ancient faith must\nbe served, and served too by others than the stolid and soulless things\nthat are but as pegs and hooks whereon to hang the fillet and the robe.\nRemember two sayings of Sextus the Pythagorean, sayings borrowed from\nthe lore of Egypt.  The first is, \"Speak not of God to the multitude\";\nthe second is, \"The man worthy of God is a god among men.\" As Genius\ngave to the ministers of Egypt worship, that empire in late ages so\nfearfully decayed, thus by Genius only can the dominion be restored.  I\nsaw in you, Apaecides, a pupil worthy of my lessons--a minister worthy\nof the great ends which may yet be wrought; your energy, your talents,\nyour purity of faith, your earnestness of enthusiasm, all fitted you for\nthat calling which demands so imperiously high and ardent qualities: I\nfanned, therefore, your sacred desires; I stimulated you to the step you\nhave taken. But you blame me that I did not reveal to you the little\nsouls and the juggling tricks of your companions.  Had I done so,\nApaecides, I had defeated my own object; your noble nature would have at\nonce revolted, and Isis would have lost her priest.'\n\nApaecides groaned aloud.  The Egyptian continued, without heeding the\ninterruption.\n\n'I placed you, therefore, without preparation, in the temple; I left you\nsuddenly to discover and to be sickened by all those mummeries which\ndazzle the herd.  I desired that you should perceive how those engines\nare moved by which the fountain that refreshes the world casts its\nwaters in the air.  It was the trial ordained of old to all our priests.\nThey who accustom themselves to the impostures of the vulgar, are left\nto practise them--for those like you, whose higher natures demand higher\npursuit, religion opens more god-like secrets.  I am pleased to find in\nyou the character I had expected.  You have taken the vows; you cannot\nrecede.  Advance--I will be your guide.'\n\n'And what wilt thou teach me, O singular and fearful man?  New\ncheats--new...'\n\n'No--I have thrown thee into the abyss of disbelief; I will lead thee\nnow to the eminence of faith.  Thou hast seen the false types: thou\nshalt learn now the realities they represent.  There is no shadow,\nApaecides, without its substance.  Come to me this night.  Your hand.'\n\nImpressed, excited, bewildered by the language of the Egyptian,\nApaecides gave him his hand, and master and pupil parted.\n\nIt was true that for Apaecides there was no retreat.  He had taken the\nvows of celibacy: he had devoted himself to a life that at present\nseemed to possess all the austerities of fanaticism, without any of the\nconsolations of belief It was natural that he should yet cling to a\nyearning desire to reconcile himself to an irrevocable career.  The\npowerful and profound mind of the Egyptian yet claimed an empire over\nhis young imagination; excited him with vague conjecture, and kept him\nalternately vibrating between hope and fear.\n\nMeanwhile Arbaces pursued his slow and stately way to the house of Ione.\nAs he entered the tablinum, he heard a voice from the porticoes of the\nperistyle beyond, which, musical as it was, sounded displeasingly on his\near--it was the voice of the young and beautiful Glaucus, and for the\nfirst time an involuntary thrill of jealousy shot through the breast of\nthe Egyptian.  On entering the peristyle, he found Glaucus seated by the\nside of Ione.  The fountain in the odorous garden cast up its silver\nspray in the air, and kept a delicious coolness in the midst of the\nsultry noon.  The handmaids, almost invariably attendant on Ione, who\nwith her freedom of life preserved the most delicate modesty, sat at a\nlittle distance; by the feet of Glaucus lay the lyre on which he had\nbeen playing to Ione one of the Lesbian airs.  The scene--the group\nbefore Arbaces, was stamped by that peculiar and refined ideality of\npoesy which we yet, not erroneously, imagine to be the distinction of\nthe ancients--the marble columns, the vases of flowers, the statue,\nwhite and tranquil, closing every vista; and, above all, the two living\nforms, from which a sculptor might have caught either inspiration or\ndespair!\n\nArbaces, pausing for a moment, gazed on the pair with a brow from which\nall the usual stern serenity had fled; he recovered himself by an\neffort, and slowly approached them, but with a step so soft and\necholess, that even the attendants heard him not; much less Ione and her\nlover.\n\n'And yet,' said Glaucus, 'it is only before we love that we imagine that\nour poets have truly described the passion; the instant the sun rises,\nall the stars that had shone in his absence vanish into air.  The poets\nexist only in the night of the heart; they are nothing to us when we\nfeel the full glory of the god.'\n\n'A gentle and most glowing image, noble Glaucus.'\n\nBoth started, and recognized behind the seat of Ione the cold and\nsarcastic face of the Egyptian.\n\n'You are a sudden guest,' said Glaucus, rising, and with a forced smile.\n\n'So ought all to be who know they are welcome,' returned Arbaces,\nseating himself, and motioning to Glaucus to do the same.\n\n'I am glad,' said Ione, 'to see you at length together; for you are\nsuited to each other, and you are formed to be friends.'\n\n'Give me back some fifteen years of life,' replied the Egyptian, 'before\nyou can place me on an equality with Glaucus.  Happy should I be to\nreceive his friendship; but what can I give him in return?  Can I make\nto him the same confidences that he would repose in me--of banquets and\ngarlands--of Parthian steeds, and the chances of the dice? these\npleasures suit his age, his nature, his career: they are not for mine.'\n\nSo saying, the artful Egyptian looked down and sighed; but from the\ncorner of his eye he stole a glance towards Ione, to see how she\nreceived these insinuations of the pursuits of her visitor.  Her\ncountenance did not satisfy him.  Glaucus, slightly coloring, hastened\ngaily to reply.  Nor was he, perhaps, without the wish in his turn to\ndisconcert and abash the Egyptian.\n\n'You are right, wise Arbaces,' said he; 'we can esteem each other, but\nwe cannot be friends.  My banquets lack the secret salt which, according\nto rumor, gives such zest to your own.  And, by Hercules! when I have\nreached your age, if I, like you, may think it wise to pursue the\npleasures of manhood, like you, I shall be doubtless sarcastic on the\ngallantries of youth.'\n\nThe Egyptian raised his eyes to Glaucus with a sudden and piercing\nglance.\n\n'I do not understand you,' said he, coldly; 'but it is the custom to\nconsider that wit lies in obscurity.' He turned from Glaucus as he\nspoke, with a scarcely perceptible sneer of contempt, and after a\nmoment's pause addressed himself to Ione.\n\n'I have not, beautiful Ione,' said he, 'been fortunate enough to find\nyou within doors the last two or three times that I have visited your\nvestibule.'\n\n'The smoothness of the sea has tempted me much from home,' replied Ione,\nwith a little embarrassment.\n\nThe embarrassment did not escape Arbaces; but without seeming to heed\nit, he replied with a smile: 'You know the old poet says, that \"Women\nshould keep within doors, and there converse.\"'\n\n'The poet was a cynic,' said Glaucus, 'and hated women.'\n\n'He spoke according to the customs of his country, and that country is\nyour boasted Greece.'\n\n'To different periods different customs.  Had our forefathers known\nIone, they had made a different law.'\n\n'Did you learn these pretty gallantries at Rome?' said Arbaces, with\nill-suppressed emotion.\n\n'One certainly would not go for gallantries to Egypt,' retorted Glaucus,\nplaying carelessly with his chain.\n\n'Come, come,' said Ione, hastening to interrupt a conversation which she\nsaw, to her great distress, was so little likely to cement the intimacy\nshe had desired to effect between Glaucus and her friend, 'Arbaces must\nnot be so hard upon his poor pupil.  An orphan, and without a mother's\ncare, I may be to blame for the independent and almost masculine liberty\nof life that I have chosen: yet it is not greater than the Roman women\nare accustomed to--it is not greater than the Grecian ought to be.\nAlas! is it only to be among men that freedom and virtue are to be\ndeemed united?  Why should the slavery that destroys you be considered\nthe only method to preserve us?  Ah! believe me, it has been the great\nerror of men--and one that has worked bitterly on their destinies--to\nimagine that the nature of women is (I will not say inferior, that may\nbe so, but) so different from their own, in making laws unfavorable to\nthe intellectual advancement of women.  Have they not, in so doing, made\nlaws against their children, whom women are to rear?--against the\nhusbands, of whom women are to be the friends, nay, sometimes the\nadvisers?' Ione stopped short suddenly, and her face was suffused with\nthe most enchanting blushes.  She feared lest her enthusiasm had led her\ntoo far; yet she feared the austere Arbaces less than the courteous\nGlaucus, for she loved the last, and it was not the custom of the Greeks\nto allow their women (at least such of their women as they most honored)\nthe same liberty and the same station as those of Italy enjoyed. She\nfelt, therefore, a thrill of delight as Glaucus earnestly replied:\n\n'Ever mayst thou think thus, Ione--ever be your pure heart your unerring\nguide!  Happy it had been for Greece if she had given to the chaste the\nsame intellectual charms that are so celebrated amongst the less worthy\nof her women.  No state falls from freedom--from knowledge, while your\nsex smile only on the free, and by appreciating, encourage the wise.'\n\nArbaces was silent, for it was neither his part to sanction the\nsentiment of Glaucus, nor to condemn that of Ione, and, after a short\nand embarrassed conversation, Glaucus took his leave of Ione.\n\nWhen he was gone, Arbaces, drawing his seat nearer to the fair\nNeapolitan's, said in those bland and subdued tones, in which he knew so\nwell how to veil the mingled art and fierceness of his character:\n\n'Think not, my sweet pupil, if so I may call you, that I wish to shackle\nthat liberty you adorn while you assume: but which, if not greater, as\nyou rightly observe, than that possessed by the Roman women, must at\nleast be accompanied by great circumspection, when arrogated by one\nunmarried. Continue to draw crowds of the gay, the brilliant, the wise\nthemselves, to your feet--continue to charm them with the conversation\nof an Aspasia, the music of an Erinna--but reflect, at least, on those\ncensorious tongues which can so easily blight the tender reputation of a\nmaiden; and while you provoke admiration, give, I beseech you, no\nvictory to envy.'\n\n'What mean you, Arbaces?' said Ione, in an alarmed and trembling voice:\n'I know you are my friend, that you desire only my honour and my\nwelfare.  What is it you would say?'\n\n'Your friend--ah, how sincerely!  May I speak then as a friend, without\nreserve and without offence?'\n\n'I beseech you do so.'\n\n'This young profligate, this Glaucus, how didst thou know him? Hast thou\nseen him often?' And as Arbaces spoke, he fixed his gaze steadfastly\nupon Ione, as if he sought to penetrate into her soul.\n\nRecoiling before that gaze, with a strange fear which she could not\nexplain, the Neapolitan answered with confusion and hesitation: 'He was\nbrought to my house as a countryman of my father's, and I may say of\nmine.  I have known him only within this last week or so: but why these\nquestions?'\n\n'Forgive me,' said Arbaces; 'I thought you might have known him longer.\nBase insinuator that he is!'\n\n'How! what mean you?  Why that term?'\n\n'It matters not: let me not rouse your indignation against one who does\nnot deserve so grave an honour.'\n\n'I implore you speak.  What has Glaucus insinuated? or rather, in what\ndo you suppose he has offended?'\n\nSmothering his resentment at the last part of Ione's question, Arbaces\ncontinued: 'You know his pursuits, his companions his habits; the\ncomissatio and the alea (the revel and the dice) make his occupation;\nand amongst the associates of vice how can he dream of virtue?'\n\n'Still you speak riddles.  By the gods!  I entreat you, say the worst at\nonce.'\n\n'Well, then, it must be so.  Know, my Ione, that it was but yesterday\nthat Glaucus boasted openly--yes, in the public baths--of your love to\nhim.  He said it amused him to take advantage of it. Nay, I will do him\njustice, he praised your beauty.  Who could deny it? But he laughed\nscornfully when his Clodius, or his Lepidus, asked him if he loved you\nenough for marriage, and when he purposed to adorn his door-posts with\nflowers?'\n\n'Impossible!  How heard you this base slander?'\n\n'Nay, would you have me relate to you all the comments of the insolent\ncoxcombs with which the story has circled through the town? Be assured\nthat I myself disbelieved at first, and that I have now painfully been\nconvinced by several ear-witnesses of the truth of what I have\nreluctantly told thee.'\n\nIone sank back, and her face was whiter than the pillar against which\nshe leaned for support.\n\n'I own it vexed--it irritated me, to hear your name thus lightly pitched\nfrom lip to lip, like some mere dancing-girl's fame.  I hastened this\nmorning to seek and to warn you.  I found Glaucus here.  I was stung\nfrom my self-possession.  I could not conceal my feelings; nay, I was\nuncourteous in thy presence.  Canst thou forgive thy friend, Ione?'\n\nIone placed her hand in his, but replied not.\n\n'Think no more of this,' said he; 'but let it be a warning voice, to\ntell thee how much prudence thy lot requires.  It cannot hurt thee,\nIone, for a moment; for a gay thing like this could never have been\nhonored by even a serious thought from Ione.  These insults only wound\nwhen they come from one we love; far different indeed is he whom the\nlofty Ione shall stoop to love.'\n\n'Love!' muttered Ione, with an hysterical laugh.  'Ay, indeed.'\n\nIt is not without interest to observe in those remote times, and under a\nsocial system so widely different from the modern, the same small causes\nthat ruffle and interrupt the 'course of love', which operate so\ncommonly at this day--the same inventive jealousy, the same cunning\nslander, the same crafty and fabricated retailings of petty gossip,\nwhich so often now suffice to break the ties of the truest love, and\ncounteract the tenor of circumstances most apparently propitious.  When\nthe bark sails on over the smoothest wave, the fable tells us of the\ndiminutive fish that can cling to the keel and arrest its progress: so\nis it ever with the great passions of mankind; and we should paint life\nbut ill if, even in times the most prodigal of romance, and of the\nromance of which we most largely avail ourselves, we did not also\ndescribe the mechanism of those trivial and household springs of\nmischief which we see every day at work in our chambers and at our\nhearths.  It is in these, the lesser intrigues of life, that we mostly\nfind ourselves at home with the past.\n\nMost cunningly had the Egyptian appealed to Ione's ruling foible--most\ndexterously had he applied the poisoned dart to her pride.  He fancied\nhe had arrested what he hoped, from the shortness of the time she had\nknown Glaucus, was, at most, but an incipient fancy; and hastening to\nchange the subject, he now led her to talk of her brother.  Their\nconversation did not last long.  He left her, resolved not again to\ntrust so much to absence, but to visit--to watch her--every day.\n\nNo sooner had his shadow glided from her presence, than woman's\npride--her sex's dissimulation--deserted his intended victim, and the\nhaughty Ione burst into passionate tears.\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nTHE GAY LIFE OF THE POMPEIAN LOUNGER.  A MINIATURE LIKENESS OF THE ROMAN\nBATHS.\n\nWHEN Glaucus left Ione, he felt as if he trod upon air.  In the\ninterview with which he had just been blessed, he had for the first time\ngathered from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome to, and\nwould not be unrewarded by, her.  This hope filled him with a rapture\nfor which earth and heaven seemed too narrow to afford a vent.\nUnconscious of the sudden enemy he had left behind, and forgetting not\nonly his taunts but his very existence, Glaucus passed through the gay\nstreets, repeating to himself, in the wantonness of joy, the music of\nthe soft air to which Ione had listened with such intentness; and now he\nentered the Street of Fortune, with its raised footpath--its houses\npainted without, and the open doors admitting the view of the glowing\nfrescoes within.  Each end of the street was adorned with a triumphal\narch: and as Glaucus now came before the Temple of Fortune, the jutting\nportico of that beautiful fane (which is supposed to have been built by\none of the family of Cicero, perhaps by the orator himself) imparted a\ndignified and venerable feature to a scene otherwise more brilliant than\nlofty in its character.  That temple was one of the most graceful\nspecimens of Roman architecture. It was raised on a somewhat lofty\npodium; and between two flights of steps ascending to a platform stood\nthe altar of the goddess.  From this platform another flight of broad\nstairs led to the portico, from the height of whose fluted columns hung\nfestoons of the richest flowers.  On either side the extremities of the\ntemple were placed statues of Grecian workmanship; and at a little\ndistance from the temple rose the triumphal arch crowned with an\nequestrian statue of Caligula, which was flanked by trophies of bronze.\nIn the space before the temple a lively throng were assembled--some\nseated on benches and discussing the politics of the empire, some\nconversing on the approaching spectacle of the amphitheatre.  One knot\nof young men were lauding a new beauty, another discussing the merits of\nthe last play; a third group, more stricken in age, were speculating on\nthe chance of the trade with Alexandria, and amidst these were many\nmerchants in the Eastern costume, whose loose and peculiar robes,\npainted and gemmed slippers, and composed and serious countenances,\nformed a striking contrast to the tunicked forms and animated gestures\nof the Italians.  For that impatient and lively people had, as now, a\nlanguage distinct from speech--a language of signs and motions,\ninexpressibly significant and vivacious: their descendants retain it,\nand the learned Jorio hath written a most entertaining work upon that\nspecies of hieroglyphical gesticulation.\n\nSauntering through the crowd, Glaucus soon found himself amidst a group\nof his merry and dissipated friends.\n\n'Ah!' said Sallust, 'it is a lustrum since I saw you.'\n\n'And how have you spent the lustrum?  What new dishes have you\ndiscovered?'\n\n'I have been scientific,' returned Sallust, 'and have made some\nexperiments in the feeding of lampreys: I confess I despair of bringing\nthem to the perfection which our Roman ancestors attained.'\n\n'Miserable man! and why?'\n\n'Because,' returned Sallust, with a sigh, 'it is no longer lawful to\ngive them a slave to eat.  I am very often tempted to make away with a\nvery fat carptor (butler) whom I possess, and pop him slily into the\nreservoir.  He would give the fish a most oleaginous flavor!  But slaves\nare not slaves nowadays, and have no sympathy with their masters'\ninterest--or Davus would destroy himself to oblige me!'\n\n'What news from Rome?' said Lepidus, as he languidly joined the group.\n\n'The emperor has been giving a splendid supper to the senators,'\nanswered Sallust.\n\n'He is a good creature,' quoth Lepidus; 'they say he never sends a man\naway without granting his request.'\n\n'Perhaps he would let me kill a slave for my reservoir?' returned\nSallust, eagerly.\n\n'Not unlikely,' said Glaucus; 'for he who grants a favor to one Roman,\nmust always do it at the expense of another.  Be sure, that for every\nsmile Titus has caused, a hundred eyes have wept.'\n\n'Long live Titus!' cried Pansa, overhearing the emperor's name, as he\nswept patronizingly through the crowd; 'he has promised my brother a\nquaestorship, because he had run through his fortune.'\n\n'And wishes now to enrich himself among the people, my Pansa,' said\nGlaucus.\n\n'Exactly so,' said Pansa.\n\n'That is putting the people to some use,' said Glaucus.\n\n'To be sure, returned Pansa.  'Well, I must go and look after the\naerarium--it is a little out of repair'; and followed by a long train of\nclients, distinguished from the rest of the throng by the togas they\nwore (for togas, once the sign of freedom in a citizen, were now the\nbadge of servility to a patron), the aedile fidgeted fussily away.\n\n'Poor Pansa!' said Lepidus: 'he never has time for pleasure.  Thank\nHeaven I am not an aedile!'\n\n'Ah, Glaucus! how are you? gay as ever?' said Clodius, joining the\ngroup.\n\n'Are you come to sacrifice to Fortune?' said Sallust.\n\n'I sacrifice to her every night,' returned the gamester.\n\n'I do not doubt it.  No man has made more victims!'\n\n'By Hercules, a biting speech!' cried Glaucus, laughing.\n\n'The dog's letter is never out of your mouth, Sallust,' said Clodius,\nangrily: 'you are always snarling.'\n\n'I may well have the dog's letter in my mouth, since, whenever I play\nwith you, I have the dog's throw in my hand,' returned Sallust.\n\n'Hist!' said Glaucus, taking a rose from a flower-girl, who stood\nbeside.\n\n'The rose is the token of silence,' replied Sallust, 'but I love only to\nsee it at the supper-table.'\n\n'Talking of that, Diomed gives a grand feast next week,' said Sallust:\n'are you invited, Glaucus?'\n\n'Yes, I received an invitation this morning.'\n\n'And I, too,' said Sallust, drawing a square piece of papyrus from his\ngirdle: 'I see that he asks us an hour earlier than usual: an earnest of\nsomething sumptuous.'\n\n'Oh! he is rich as Croesus,' said Clodius; 'and his bill of fare is as\nlong as an epic.'\n\n'Well, let us to the baths,' said Glaucus: 'this is the time when all\nthe world is there; and Fulvius, whom you admire so much, is going to\nread us his last ode.'\n\nThe young men assented readily to the proposal, and they strolled to the\nbaths.\n\nAlthough the public thermae, or baths, were instituted rather for the\npoorer citizens than the wealthy (for the last had baths in their own\nhouses), yet, to the crowds of all ranks who resorted to them, it was a\nfavorite place for conversation, and for that indolent lounging so dear\nto a gay and thoughtless people.  The baths at Pompeii differed, of\ncourse, in plan and construction from the vast and complicated thermae\nof Rome; and, indeed, it seems that in each city of the empire there was\nalways some slight modification of arrangement in the general\narchitecture of the public baths. This mightily puzzles the learned--as\nif architects and fashion were not capricious before the nineteenth\ncentury!  Our party entered by the principal porch in the Street of\nFortune.  At the wing of the portico sat the keeper of the baths, with\nhis two boxes before him, one for the money he received, one for the\ntickets he dispensed.  Round the walls of the portico were seats crowded\nwith persons of all ranks; while others, as the regimen of the\nphysicians prescribed, were walking briskly to and fro the portico,\nstopping every now and then to gaze on the innumerable notices of shows,\ngames, sales, exhibitions, which were painted or inscribed upon the\nwalls. The general subject of conversation was, however, the spectacle\nannounced in the amphitheatre; and each new-comer was fastened upon by a\ngroup eager to know if Pompeii had been so fortunate as to produce some\nmonstrous criminal, some happy case of sacrilege or of murder, which\nwould allow the aediles to provide a man for the jaws of the lion: all\nother more common exhibitions seemed dull and tame, when compared with\nthe possibility of this fortunate occurrence.\n\n'For my part,' said one jolly-looking man, who was a goldsmith, 'I think\nthe emperor, if he is as good as they say, might have sent us a Jew.'\n\n'Why not take one of the new sect of Nazarenes?' said a philosopher.  'I\nam not cruel: but an atheist, one who denies Jupiter himself, deserves\nno mercy.'\n\n'I care not how many gods a man likes to believe in,' said the\ngoldsmith; 'but to deny all gods is something monstrous.'\n\n'Yet I fancy,' said Glaucus, 'that these people are not absolutely\natheists. I am told that they believe in a God--nay, in a future state.'\n\n'Quite a mistake, my dear Glaucus,' said the philosopher.  'I have\nconferred with them--they laughed in my face when I talked of Pluto and\nHades.'\n\n'O ye gods!' exclaimed the goldsmith, in horror; 'are there any of these\nwretches in Pompeii?'\n\n'I know there are a few: but they meet so privately that it is\nimpossible to discover who they are.'\n\nAs Glaucus turned away, a sculptor, who was a great enthusiast in his\nart, looked after him admiringly.\n\n'Ah!' said he, 'if we could get him on the arena--there would be a model\nfor you! What limbs! what a head! he ought to have been a gladiator!  A\nsubject--a subject--worthy of our art!  Why don't they give him to the\nlion?'\n\nMeanwhile Fulvius, the Roman poet, whom his contemporaries declared\nimmortal, and who, but for this history, would never have been heard of\nin our neglectful age, came eagerly up to Glaucus. 'Oh, my Athenian, my\nGlaucus, you have come to hear my ode!  That is indeed an honour; you, a\nGreek--to whom the very language of common life is poetry.  How I thank\nyou. It is but a trifle; but if I secure your approbation, perhaps I may\nget an introduction to Titus.  Oh, Glaucus! a poet without a patron is\nan amphora without a label; the wine may be good, but nobody will laud\nit!  And what says Pythagoras?--\"Frankincense to the gods, but praise to\nman.\" A patron, then, is the poet's priest: he procures him the incense,\nand obtains him his believers.'\n\n'But all Pompeii is your patron, and every portico an altar in your\npraise.'\n\n'Ah! the poor Pompeians are very civil--they love to honour merit. But\nthey are only the inhabitants of a petty town--spero meliora! Shall we\nwithin?'\n\n'Certainly; we lose time till we hear your poem.'\n\nAt this instant there was a rush of some twenty persons from the baths\ninto the portico; and a slave stationed at the door of a small corridor\nnow admitted the poet, Glaucus, Clodius, and a troop of the bard's other\nfriends, into the passage.\n\n'A poor place this, compared with the Roman thermae!' said Lepidus,\ndisdainfully.\n\n'Yet is there some taste in the ceiling,' said Glaucus, who was in a\nmood to be pleased with everything; pointing to the stars which studded\nthe roof.\n\nLepidus shrugged his shoulders, but was too languid to reply.\n\nThey now entered a somewhat spacious chamber, which served for the\npurposes of the apodyterium (that is, a place where the bathers prepared\nthemselves for their luxurious ablutions).  The vaulted ceiling was\nraised from a cornice, glowingly colored with motley and grotesque\npaintings; the ceiling itself was paneled in white compartments bordered\nwith rich crimson; the unsullied and shining floor was paved with white\nmosaics, and along the walls were ranged benches for the accommodation\nof the loiterers.  This chamber did not possess the numerous and\nspacious windows which Vitruvius attributes to his more magnificent\nfrigidarium.  The Pompeians, as all the southern Italians, were fond of\nbanishing the light of their sultry skies, and combined in their\nvoluptuous associations the idea of luxury with darkness.  Two windows\nof glass alone admitted the soft and shaded ray; and the compartment in\nwhich one of these casements was placed was adorned with a large relief\nof the destruction of the Titans.\n\nIn this apartment Fulvius seated himself with a magisterial air, and his\naudience gathering round him, encouraged him to commence his recital.\n\nThe poet did not require much pressing.  He drew forth from his vest a\nroll of papyrus, and after hemming three times, as much to command\nsilence as to clear his voice, he began that wonderful ode, of which, to\nthe great mortification of the author of this history, no single verse\ncan be discovered.\n\nBy the plaudits he received, it was doubtless worthy of his fame; and\nGlaucus was the only listener who did not find it excel the best odes of\nHorace.\n\nThe poem concluded, those who took only the cold bath began to undress;\nthey suspended their garments on hooks fastened in the wall, and\nreceiving, according to their condition, either from their own slaves or\nthose of the thermae, loose robes in exchange, withdrew into that\ngraceful circular building which yet exists, to shame the unlaving\nposterity of the south.\n\nThe more luxurious departed by another door to the tepidarium, a place\nwhich was heated to a voluptuous warmth, partly by a movable fireplace,\nprincipally by a suspended pavement, beneath which was conducted the\ncaloric of the laconicum.\n\nHere this portion of the intended bathers, after unrobing themselves,\nremained for some time enjoying the artificial warmth of the luxurious\nair. And this room, as befitted its important rank in the long process\nof ablution, was more richly and elaborately decorated than the rest;\nthe arched roof was beautifully carved and painted; the windows above,\nof ground glass, admitted but wandering and uncertain rays; below the\nmassive cornices were rows of figures in massive and bold relief; the\nwalls glowed with crimson, the pavement was skillfully tessellated in\nwhite mosaics.  Here the habituated bathers, men who bathed seven times\na day, would remain in a state of enervate and speechless lassitude,\neither before or (mostly) after the water-bath; and many of these\nvictims of the pursuit of health turned their listless eyes on the\nnewcomers, recognizing their friends with a nod, but dreading the\nfatigue of conversation.\n\nFrom this place the party again diverged, according to their several\nfancies, some to the sudatorium, which answered the purpose of our\nvapor-baths, and thence to the warm-bath itself; those more accustomed\nto exercise, and capable of dispensing with so cheap a purchase of\nfatigue, resorted at once to the calidarium, or water-bath.\n\nIn order to complete this sketch, and give to the reader an adequate\nnotion of this, the main luxury of the ancients, we will accompany\nLepidus, who regularly underwent the whole process, save only the cold\nbath, which had gone lately out of fashion.  Being then gradually warmed\nin the tepidarium, which has just been described, the delicate steps of\nthe Pompeian elegant were conducted to the sudatorium.  Here let the\nreader depict to himself the gradual process of the vapor-bath,\naccompanied by an exhalation of spicy perfumes.  After our bather had\nundergone this operation, he was seized by his slaves, who always\nawaited him at the baths, and the dews of heat were removed by a kind of\nscraper, which (by the way) a modern traveler has gravely declared to be\nused only to remove the dirt, not one particle of which could ever\nsettle on the polished skin of the practised bather. Thence, somewhat\ncooled, he passed into the water-bath, over which fresh perfumes were\nprofusely scattered, and on emerging from the opposite part of the room,\na cooling shower played over his head and form.  Then wrapping himself\nin a light robe, he returned once more to the tepidarium, where he found\nGlaucus, who had not encountered the sudatorium; and now, the main\ndelight and extravagance of the bath commenced.  Their slaves anointed\nthe bathers from vials of gold, of alabaster, or of crystal, studded\nwith profusest gems, and containing the rarest unguents gathered from\nall quarters of the world.  The number of these smegmata used by the\nwealthy would fill a modern volume--especially if the volume were\nprinted by a fashionable publisher; Amaracinum, Megalium, Nardum--omne\nquod exit in um--while soft music played in an adjacent chamber, and\nsuch as used the bath in moderation, refreshed and restored by the\ngrateful ceremony, conversed with all the zest and freshness of\nrejuvenated life.\n\n'Blessed be he who invented baths!' said Glaucus, stretching himself\nalong one of those bronze seats (then covered with soft cushions) which\nthe visitor to Pompeii sees at this day in that same tepidarium.\n'Whether he were Hercules or Bacchus, he deserved deification.'\n\n'But tell me,' said a corpulent citizen, who was groaning and wheezing\nunder the operation of being rubbed down, 'tell me, O Glaucus!--evil\nchance to thy hands, O slave! why so rough?--tell me--ugh--ugh!--are the\nbaths at Rome really so magnificent?' Glaucus turned, and recognized\nDiomed, though not without some difficulty, so red and so inflamed were\nthe good man's cheeks by the sudatory and the scraping he had so lately\nundergone.  'I fancy they must be a great deal finer than these.  Eh?'\nSuppressing a smile, Glaucus replied:\n\n'Imagine all Pompeii converted into baths, and you will then form a\nnotion of the size of the imperial thermae of Rome.  But a notion of the\nsize only. Imagine every entertainment for mind and body--enumerate all\nthe gymnastic games our fathers invented--repeat all the books Italy and\nGreece have produced--suppose places for all these games, admirers for\nall these works--add to this, baths of the vastest size, the most\ncomplicated construction--intersperse the whole with gardens, with\ntheatres, with porticoes, with schools--suppose, in one word, a city of\nthe gods, composed but of palaces and public edifices, and you may form\nsome faint idea of the glories of the great baths of Rome.'\n\n'By Hercules!' said Diomed, opening his eyes, 'why, it would take a\nman's whole life to bathe!'\n\n'At Rome, it often does so,' replied Glaucus, gravely.  'There are many\nwho live only at the baths.  They repair there the first hour in which\nthe doors are opened, and remain till that in which the doors are\nclosed.  They seem as if they knew nothing of the rest of Rome, as if\nthey despised all other existence.'\n\n'By Pollux! you amaze me.'\n\n'Even those who bathe only thrice a day contrive to consume their lives\nin this occupation.  They take their exercise in the tennis-court or the\nporticoes, to prepare them for the first bath; they lounge into the\ntheatre, to refresh themselves after it.  They take their prandium under\nthe trees, and think over their second bath. By the time it is prepared,\nthe prandium is digested.  From the second bath they stroll into one of\nthe peristyles, to hear some new poet recite: or into the library, to\nsleep over an old one. Then comes the supper, which they still consider\nbut a part of the bath: and then a third time they bathe again, as the\nbest place to converse with their friends.'\n\n'Per Hercle! but we have their imitators at Pompeii.'\n\n'Yes, and without their excuse.  The magnificent voluptuaries of the\nRoman baths are happy: they see nothing but gorgeousness and splendor;\nthey visit not the squalid parts of the city; they know not that there\nis poverty in the world.  All Nature smiles for them, and her only frown\nis the last one which sends them to bathe in Cocytus. Believe me, they\nare your only true philosophers.'\n\nWhile Glaucus was thus conversing, Lepidus, with closed eyes and scarce\nperceptible breath, was undergoing all the mystic operations, not one of\nwhich he ever suffered his attendants to omit.  After the perfumes and\nthe unguents, they scattered over him the luxurious powder which\nprevented any further accession of heat: and this being rubbed away by\nthe smooth surface of the pumice, he began to indue, not the garments he\nhad put off, but those more festive ones termed 'the synthesis', with\nwhich the Romans marked their respect for the coming ceremony of supper,\nif rather, from its hour (three o'clock in our measurement of time), it\nmight not be more fitly denominated dinner.  This done, he at length\nopened his eyes and gave signs of returning life.\n\nAt the same time, too, Sallust betokened by a long yawn the evidence of\nexistence.\n\n'It is supper time,' said the epicure; 'you, Glaucus and Lepidus, come\nand sup with me.'\n\n'Recollect you are all three engaged to my house next week,' cried\nDiomed, who was mightily proud of the acquaintance of men of fashion.\n\n'Ah, ah! we recollect,' said Sallust; 'the seat of memory, my Diomed, is\ncertainly in the stomach.'\n\nPassing now once again into the cooler air, and so into the street, our\ngallants of that day concluded the ceremony of a Pompeian bath.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nARBACES COGS HIS DICE WITH PLEASURE AND WINS THE GAME.\n\nTHE evening darkened over the restless city as Apaecides took his way to\nthe house of the Egyptian.  He avoided the more lighted and populous\nstreets; and as he strode onward with his head buried in his bosom, and\nhis arms folded within his robe, there was something startling in the\ncontrast, which his solemn mien and wasted form presented to the\nthoughtless brows and animated air of those who occasionally crossed his\npath.\n\nAt length, however, a man of a more sober and staid demeanor, and who\nhad twice passed him with a curious but doubting look, touched him on\nthe shoulder.\n\n'Apaecides!' said he, and he made a rapid sign with his hands: it was\nthe sign of the cross.\n\n'Well, Nazarene,' replied the priest, and his face grew paler; 'what\nwouldst thou?'\n\n'Nay,' returned the stranger, 'I would not interrupt thy meditations;\nbut the last time we met, I seemed not to be so unwelcome.'\n\n'You are not unwelcome, Olinthus; but I am sad and weary: nor am I able\nthis evening to discuss with you those themes which are most acceptable\nto you.'\n\n'O backward of heart!' said Olinthus, with bitter fervor; and art thou\nsad and weary, and wilt thou turn from the very springs that refresh and\nheal?'\n\n'O earth!' cried the young priest, striking his breast passionately,\n'from what regions shall my eyes open to the true Olympus, where thy\ngods really dwell?  Am I to believe with this man, that none whom for so\nmany centuries my fathers worshipped have a being or a name?  Am I to\nbreak down, as something blasphemous and profane, the very altars which\nI have deemed most sacred? or am I to think with Arbaces--what?' He\npaused, and strode rapidly away in the impatience of a man who strives\nto get rid of himself.  But the Nazarene was one of those hardy,\nvigorous, and enthusiastic men, by whom God in all times has worked the\nrevolutions of earth, and those, above all, in the establishment and in\nthe reformation of His own religion--men who were formed to convert,\nbecause formed to endure.  It is men of this mould whom nothing\ndiscourages, nothing dismays; in the fervor of belief they are inspired\nand they inspire.  Their reason first kindles their passion, but the\npassion is the instrument they use; they force themselves into men's\nhearts, while they appear only to appeal to their judgment.  Nothing is\nso contagious as enthusiasm; it is the real allegory of the tale of\nOrpheus--it moves stones, it charms brutes.  Enthusiasm is the genius of\nsincerity, and truth accomplishes no victories without it.\n\nOlinthus did not then suffer Apaecides thus easily to escape him.  He\novertook and addressed him thus:\n\n'I do not wonder, Apaecides, that I distress you; that I shake all the\nelements of your mind: that you are lost in doubt; that you drift here\nand there in the vast ocean of uncertain and benighted thought.  I\nwonder not at this, but bear with me a little; watch and pray--the\ndarkness shall vanish, the storm sleep, and God Himself, as He came of\nyore on the seas of Samaria, shall walk over the lulled billows, to the\ndelivery of your soul.  Ours is a religion jealous in its demands, but\nhow infinitely prodigal in its gifts! It troubles you for an hour, it\nrepays you by immortality.'\n\n'Such promises,' said Apaecides, sullenly, 'are the tricks by which man\nis ever gulled.  Oh, glorious were the promises which led me to the\nshrine of Isis!'\n\n'But,' answered the Nazarene, 'ask thy reason, can that religion be\nsound which outrages all morality?  You are told to worship your gods.\nWhat are those gods, even according to yourselves?  What their actions,\nwhat their attributes?  Are they not all represented to you as the\nblackest of criminals? yet you are asked to serve them as the holiest of\ndivinities. Jupiter himself is a parricide and an adulterer.  What are\nthe meaner deities but imitators of his vices?  You are told not to\nmurder, but you worship murderers; you are told not to commit adultery,\nand you make your prayers to an adulterer!  Oh!  what is this but a\nmockery of the holiest part of man's nature, which is faith?  Turn now\nto the God, the one, the true God, to whose shrine I would lead you.  If\nHe seem to you too sublime, two shadowy, for those human associations,\nthose touching connections between Creator and creature, to which the\nweak heart clings--contemplate Him in His Son, who put on mortality like\nourselves.  His mortality is not indeed declared, like that of your\nfabled gods, by the vices of our nature, but by the practice of all its\nvirtues.  In Him are united the austerest morals with the tenderest\naffections.  If He were but a mere man, He had been worthy to become a\ngod.  You honour Socrates--he has his sect, his disciples, his schools.\nBut what are the doubtful virtues of the Athenian, to the bright, the\nundisputed, the active, the unceasing, the devoted holiness of Christ?\nI speak to you now only of His human character.  He came in that as the\npattern of future ages, to show us the form of virtue which Plato\nthirsted to see embodied. This was the true sacrifice that He made for\nman; but the halo that encircled His dying hour not only brightened\nearth, but opened to us the sight of heaven!  You are touched--you are\nmoved.  God works in your heart.  His Spirit is with you.  Come, resist\nnot the holy impulse; come at once--unhesitatingly.  A few of us are now\nassembled to expound the word of God.  Come, let me guide you to them.\nYou are sad, you are weary.  Listen, then, to the words of God: \"Come to\nme\", saith He, \"all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest!\"'\n\n'I cannot now,' said Apaecides; 'another time.'\n\n'Now--now!' exclaimed Olinthus, earnestly, and clasping him by the arm.\n\nBut Apaecides, yet unprepared for the renunciation of that faith--that\nlife, for which he had sacrificed so much, and still haunted by the\npromises of the Egyptian, extricated himself forcibly from the grasp;\nand feeling an effort necessary to conquer the irresolution which the\neloquence of the Christian had begun to effect in his heated and\nfeverish mind, he gathered up his robes and fled away with a speed that\ndefied pursuit.\n\nBreathless and exhausted, he arrived at last in a remote and sequestered\npart of the city, and the lone house of the Egyptian stood before him.\nAs he paused to recover himself, the moon emerged from a silver cloud,\nand shone full upon the walls of that mysterious habitation.\n\nNo other house was near--the darksome vines clustered far and wide in\nfront of the building and behind it rose a copse of lofty forest trees,\nsleeping in the melancholy moonlight; beyond stretched the dim outline\nof the distant hills, and amongst them the quiet crest of Vesuvius, not\nthen so lofty as the traveler beholds it now.\n\nApaecides passed through the arching vines, and arrived at the broad and\nspacious portico.  Before it, on either side of the steps, reposed the\nimage of the Egyptian sphinx, and the moonlight gave an additional and\nyet more solemn calm to those large, and harmonious, and passionless\nfeatures, in which the sculptors of that type of wisdom united so much\nof loveliness with awe; half way up the extremities of the steps\ndarkened the green and massive foliage of the aloe, and the shadow of\nthe eastern palm cast its long and unwaving boughs partially over the\nmarble surface of the stairs.\n\nSomething there was in the stillness of the place, and the strange\naspect of the sculptured sphinxes, which thrilled the blood of the\npriest with a nameless and ghostly fear, and he longed even for an echo\nto his noiseless steps as he ascended to the threshold.\n\nHe knocked at the door, over which was wrought an inscription in\ncharacters unfamiliar to his eyes; it opened without a sound, and a tall\nEthiopian slave, without question or salutation, motioned to him to\nproceed.\n\nThe wide hall was lighted by lofty candelabra of elaborate bronze, and\nround the walls were wrought vast hieroglyphics, in dark and solemn\ncolors, which contrasted strangely with the bright hues and graceful\nshapes with which the inhabitants of Italy decorated their abodes.  At\nthe extremity of the hall, a slave, whose countenance, though not\nAfrican, was darker by many shades than the usual color of the south,\nadvanced to meet him.\n\n'I seek Arbaces,' said the priest; but his voice trembled even in his\nown ear.  The slave bowed his head in silence, and leading Apaecides to\na wing without the hall, conducted him up a narrow staircase, and then\ntraversing several rooms, in which the stern and thoughtful beauty of\nthe sphinx still made the chief and most impressive object of the\npriest's notice, Apaecides found himself in a dim and half-lighted\nchamber, in the presence of the Egyptian.\n\nArbaces was seated before a small table, on which lay unfolded several\nscrolls of papyrus, impressed with the same character as that on the\nthreshold of the mansion.  A small tripod stood at a little distance,\nfrom the incense in which the smoke slowly rose.  Near this was a vast\nglobe, depicting the signs of heaven; and upon another table lay several\ninstruments, of curious and quaint shape, whose uses were unknown to\nApaecides.  The farther extremity of the room was concealed by a\ncurtain, and the oblong window in the roof admitted the rays of the\nmoon, mingling sadly with the single lamp which burned in the apartment.\n\n'Seat yourself, Apaecides,' said the Egyptian, without rising.\n\nThe young man obeyed.\n\n'You ask me,' resumed Arbaces, after a short pause, in which he seemed\nabsorbed in thought--'You ask me, or would do so, the mightiest secrets\nwhich the soul of man is fitted to receive; it is the enigma of life\nitself that you desire me to solve.  Placed like children in the dark,\nand but for a little while, in this dim and confined existence, we shape\nour spectres in the obscurity; our thoughts now sink back into ourselves\nin terror, now wildly plunge themselves into the guideless gloom,\nguessing what it may contain; stretching our helpless hands here and\nthere, lest, blindly, we stumble upon some hidden danger; not knowing\nthe limits of our boundary, now feeling them suffocate us with\ncompression, now seeing them extend far away till they vanish into\neternity.  In this state all wisdom consists necessarily in the solution\nof two questions: \"What are we to believe? and What are we to reject?\"\nThese questions you desire me to decide.'\n\nApaecides bowed his head in assent.\n\n'Man must have some belief,' continued the Egyptian, in a tone of\nsadness. 'He must fasten his hope to something: is our common nature\nthat you inherit when, aghast and terrified to see that in which you\nhave been taught to place your faith swept away, you float over a dreary\nand shoreless sea of incertitude, you cry for help, you ask for some\nplank to cling to, some land, however dim and distant, to attain.  Well,\nthen, have not forgotten our conversation of to-day?'\n\n'Forgotten!'\n\n'I confessed to you that those deities for whom smoke so many altars\nwere but inventions.  I confessed to you that our rites and ceremonies\nwere but mummeries, to delude and lure the herd to their proper good.  I\nexplained to you that from those delusions came the bonds of society,\nthe harmony of the world, the power of the wise; that power is in the\nobedience of the vulgar. Continue we then these salutary delusions--if\nman must have some belief, continue to him that which his fathers have\nmade dear to him, and which custom sanctifies and strengthens.  In\nseeking a subtler faith for us, whose senses are too spiritual for the\ngross one, let us leave others that support which crumbles from\nourselves.  This is wise--it is benevolent.'\n\n'Proceed.'\n\n'This being settled,' resumed the Egyptian, 'the old landmarks being\nleft uninjured for those whom we are about to desert, we gird up our\nloins and depart to new climes of faith.  Dismiss at once from your\nrecollection, from your thought, all that you have believed before.\nSuppose the mind a blank, an unwritten scroll, fit to receive\nimpressions for the first time.  Look round the world--observe its\norder--its regularity--its design.  Something must have created it--the\ndesign speaks a designer: in that certainty we first touch land.  But\nwhat is that something?--A god, you cry.  Stay--no confused\nand confusing names.  Of that which created the world, we know,\nwe can know, nothing, save these attributes--power and unvarying\nregularity--stern, crushing, relentless regularity--heeding no\nindividual cases--rolling--sweeping--burning on; no matter what\nscattered hearts, severed from the general mass, fall ground and\nscorched beneath its wheels. The mixture of evil with good--the\nexistence of suffering and of crime--in all times have perplexed the\nwise.  They created a god--they supposed him benevolent.  How then came\nthis evil? why did he permit it--nay, why invent, why perpetuate it?  To\naccount for this, the Persian creates a second spirit, whose nature is\nevil, and supposes a continual war between that and the god of good.  In\nour own shadowy and tremendous Typhon, the Egyptians image a similar\ndemon.  Perplexing blunder that yet more bewilders us!--folly that arose\nfrom the vain delusion that makes a palpable, a corporeal, a human\nbeing, of this unknown power--that clothes the Invisible with attributes\nand a nature similar to the Seen.  No: to this designer let us give a\nname that does not command our bewildering associations, and the mystery\nbecomes more clear--that name is NECESSITY.  Necessity, say the Greeks,\ncompels the gods.  Then why the gods?--their agency becomes\nunnecessary--dismiss them at once. Necessity is the ruler of all we\nsee--power, regularity--these two qualities make its nature.  Would you\nask more?--you can learn nothing: whether it be eternal--whether it\ncompel us, its creatures, to new careers after that darkness which we\ncall death--we cannot tell.  There leave we this ancient, unseen,\nunfathomable power, and come to that which, to our eyes, is the great\nminister of its functions. This we can task more, from this we can learn\nmore: its evidence is around us--its name is NATURE.  The error of the\nsages has been to direct their researches to the attributes of\nnecessity, where all is gloom and blindness. Had they confined their\nresearches to Nature--what of knowledge might we not already have\nachieved?  Here patience, examination, are never directed in vain.  We\nsee what we explore; our minds ascend a palpable ladder of causes and\neffects. Nature is the great agent of the external universe, and\nNecessity imposes upon it the laws by which it acts, and imparts to us\nthe powers by which we examine; those powers are curiosity and\nmemory--their union is reason, their perfection is wisdom.  Well, then,\nI examine by the help of these powers this inexhaustible Nature.  I\nexamine the earth, the air, the ocean, the heaven: I find that all have\na mystic sympathy with each other--that the moon sways the tides--that\nthe air maintains the earth, and is the medium of the life and sense of\nthings--that by the knowledge of the stars we measure the limits of the\nearth--that we portion out the epochs of time--that by their pale light\nwe are guided into the abyss of the past--that in their solemn lore we\ndiscern the destinies of the future. And thus, while we know not that\nwhich Necessity is, we learn, at least, her decrees.  And now, what\nmorality do we glean from this religion?--for religion it is.  I believe\nin two deities--Nature and Necessity; I worship the last by reverence,\nthe first by investigation.  What is the morality my religion teaches?\nThis--all things are subject but to general rules; the sun shines for\nthe joy of the many--it may bring sorrow to the few; the night sheds\nsleep on the multitude--but it harbors murder as well as rest; the\nforests adorn the earth--but shelter the serpent and the lion; the ocean\nsupports a thousand barks--but it engulfs the one. It is only thus for\nthe general, and not for the universal benefit, that Nature acts, and\nNecessity speeds on her awful course.  This is the morality of the dread\nagents of the world--it is mine, who am their creature.  I would\npreserve the delusions of priestcraft, for they are serviceable to the\nmultitude; I would impart to man the arts I discover, the sciences I\nperfect; I would speed the vast career of civilizing lore: in this I\nserve the mass, I fulfill the general law, I execute the great moral\nthat Nature preaches.  For myself I claim the individual exception; I\nclaim it for the wise--satisfied that my individual actions are nothing\nin the great balance of good and evil; satisfied that the product of my\nknowledge can give greater blessings to the mass than my desires can\noperate evil on the few (for the first can extend to remotest regions\nand humanize nations yet unborn), I give to the world wisdom, to myself\nfreedom. I enlighten the lives of others, and I enjoy my own.  Yes; our\nwisdom is eternal, but our life is short: make the most of it while it\nlasts. Surrender thy youth to pleasure, and thy senses to delight.  Soon\ncomes the hour when the wine-cup is shattered, and the garlands shall\ncease to bloom.  Enjoy while you may.  Be still, O Apaecides, my pupil\nand my follower!  I will teach thee the mechanism of Nature, her darkest\nand her wildest secrets--the lore which fools call magic--and the mighty\nmysteries of the stars. By this shalt thou discharge thy duty to the\nmass; by this shalt thou enlighten thy race.  But I will lead thee also\nto pleasures of which the vulgar do not dream; and the day which thou\ngivest to men shall be followed by the sweet night which thou\nsurrenderest to thyself.'\n\nAs the Egyptian ceased there rose about, around, beneath, the softest\nmusic that Lydia ever taught, or Iona ever perfected.  It came like a\nstream of sound, bathing the senses unawares; enervating, subduing with\ndelight.  It seemed the melodies of invisible spirits, such as the\nshepherd might have heard in the golden age, floating through the vales\nof Thessaly, or in the noontide glades of Paphos.  The words which had\nrushed to the lip of Apaecides, in answer to the sophistries of the\nEgyptian, died tremblingly away.  He felt it as a profanation to break\nupon that enchanted strain--the susceptibility of his excited nature,\nthe Greek softness and ardour of his secret soul, were swayed and\ncaptured by surprise.  He sank on the seat with parted lips and\nthirsting ear; while in a chorus of voices, bland and melting as those\nwhich waked Psyche in the halls of love, rose the following song:\n\n                THE HYMN OF EROS\n\n       By the cool banks where soft Cephisus flows,\n         A voice sail'd trembling down the waves of air;\n        The leaves blushed brighter in the Teian's rose,\n         The doves couch'd breathless in their summer lair;\n\n       While from their hands the purple flowerets fell,\n         The laughing Hours stood listening in the sky;--\n       From Pan's green cave to AEgle's haunted cell,\n         Heaved the charm'd earth in one delicious sigh.\n\n       Love, sons of earth!  I am the Power of Love!\n         Eldest of all the gods, with Chaos born;\n        My smile sheds light along the courts above,\n         My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn.\n\n       Mine are the stars--there, ever as ye gaze,\n         Ye meet the deep spell of my haunting eyes;\n        Mine is the moon--and, mournful if her rays,\n         'Tis that she lingers where her Carian lies.\n\n       The flowers are mine--the blushes of the rose,\n         The violet--charming Zephyr to the shade;\n        Mine the quick light that in the Maybeam glows,\n         And mine the day-dream in the lonely glade.\n\n       Love, sons of earth--for love is earth's soft lore,\n         Look where ye will--earth overflows with ME;\n        Learn from the waves that ever kiss the shore,\n         And the winds nestling on the heaving sea.\n\n       'All teaches love!'--The sweet voice, like a dream,\n         Melted in light; yet still the airs above,\n        The waving sedges, and the whispering stream,\n         And the green forest rustling, murmur'd 'LOVE!'\nAs the voices died away, the Egyptian seized the hand of Apaecides, and\nled him, wandering, intoxicated, yet half-reluctant, across the chamber\ntowards the curtain at the far end; and now, from behind that curtain,\nthere seemed to burst a thousand sparkling stars; the veil itself,\nhitherto dark, was now lighted by these fires behind into the tenderest\nblue of heaven.  It represented heaven itself--such a heaven, as in the\nnights of June might have shone down over the streams of Castaly.  Here\nand there were painted rosy and aerial clouds, from which smiled, by the\nlimner's art, faces of divinest beauty, and on which reposed the shapes\nof which Phidias and Apelles dreamed.  And the stars which studded the\ntransparent azure rolled rapidly as they shone, while the music, that\nagain woke with a livelier and lighter sound, seemed to imitate the\nmelody of the joyous spheres.\n\n'Oh! what miracle is this, Arbaces,' said Apaecides in faltering\naccents. 'After having denied the gods, art thou about to reveal to\nme...'\n\n'Their pleasures!' interrupted Arbaces, in a tone so different from its\nusual cold and tranquil harmony that Apaecides started, and thought the\nEgyptian himself transformed; and now, as they neared the curtain, a\nwild--a loud--an exulting melody burst from behind its concealment.\nWith that sound the veil was rent in twain--it parted--it seemed to\nvanish into air: and a scene, which no Sybarite ever more than rivalled,\nbroke upon the dazzled gaze of the youthful priest.  A vast banquet-room\nstretched beyond, blazing with countless lights, which filled the warm\nair with the scents of frankincense, of jasmine, of violets, of myrrh;\nall that the most odorous flowers, all that the most costly spices could\ndistil, seemed gathered into one ineffable and ambrosial essence: from\nthe light columns that sprang upwards to the airy roof, hung draperies\nof white, studded with golden stars.  At the extremities of the room two\nfountains cast up a spray, which, catching the rays of the roseate\nlight, glittered like countless diamonds. In the centre of the room as\nthey entered there rose slowly from the floor, to the sound of unseen\nminstrelsy, a table spread with all the viands which sense ever devoted\nto fancy, and vases of that lost Myrrhine fabric, so glowing in its\ncolors, so transparent in its material, were crowned with the exotics of\nthe East.  The couches, to which this table was the centre, were covered\nwith tapestries of azure and gold; and from invisible tubes the vaulted\nroof descended showers of fragrant waters, that cooled the delicious\nair, and contended with the lamps, as if the spirits of wave and fire\ndisputed which element could furnish forth the most delicious odorous.\nAnd now, from behind the snowy draperies, trooped such forms as Adonis\nbeheld when he lay on the lap of Venus.  They came, some with garlands,\nothers with lyres; they surrounded the youth, they led his steps to the\nbanquet.  They flung the chaplets round him in rosy chains.  The\nearth--the thought of earth, vanished from his soul.  He imagined\nhimself in a dream, and suppressed his breath lest he should wake too\nsoon; the senses, to which he had never yielded as yet, beat in his\nburning pulse, and confused his dizzy and reeling sight.  And while thus\namazed and lost, once again, but in brisk and Bacchic measures, rose the\nmagic strain:\n\n                ANACREONTIC\n\n       In the veins of the calix foams and glows\n          The blood of the mantling vine,\n        But oh! in the bowl of Youth there glows\n          A Lesbian, more divine!\n              Bright, bright,\n             As the liquid light,\n         Its waves through thine eyelids shine!\n\n       Fill up, fill up, to the sparkling brim,\n          The juice of the young Lyaeus;\n        The grape is the key that we owe to him\n          From the gaol of the world to free us.\n              Drink, drink!\n             What need to shrink,\n         When the lambs alone can see us?\n\n       Drink, drink, as I quaff from thine eyes\n          The wine of a softer tree;\n        Give the smiles to the god of the grape--thy sighs,\n          Beloved one, give to me.\n              Turn, turn,\n             My glances burn,\n         And thirst for a look from thee!\nAs the song ended, a group of three maidens, entwined with a chain of\nstarred flowers, and who, while they imitated, might have shamed the\nGraces, advanced towards him in the gliding measures of the Ionian\ndance: such as the Nereids wreathed in moonlight on the yellow sands of\nthe AEgean wave--such as Cytherea taught her handmaids in the\nmarriage-feast of Psyche and her son.\n\nNow approaching, they wreathed their chaplet round his head; now\nkneeling, the youngest of the three proffered him the bowl, from which\nthe wine of Lesbos foamed and sparkled.  The youth resisted no more, he\ngrasped the intoxicating cup, the blood mantled fiercely through his\nveins.  He sank upon the breast of the nymph who sat beside him, and\nturning with swimming eyes to seek for Arbaces, whom he had lost in the\nwhirl of his emotions, he beheld him seated beneath a canopy at the\nupper end of the table, and gazing upon him with a smile that encouraged\nhim to pleasure.  He beheld him, but not as he had hitherto seen, with\ndark and sable garments, with a brooding and solemn brow: a robe that\ndazzled the sight, so studded was its whitest surface with gold and\ngems, blazed upon his majestic form; white roses, alternated with the\nemerald and the ruby, and shaped tiara-like, crowned his raven locks.\nHe appeared, like Ulysses, to have gained the glory of a second\nyouth--his features seemed to have exchanged thought for beauty, and he\ntowered amidst the loveliness that surrounded him, in all the beaming\nand relaxing benignity of the Olympian god.\n\n'Drink, feast, love, my pupil!' said he, 'blush not that thou art\npassionate and young.  That which thou art, thou feelest in thy veins:\nthat which thou shalt be, survey!'\n\nWith this he pointed to a recess, and the eyes of Apaecides, following\nthe gesture, beheld on a pedestal, placed between the statues of Bacchus\nand Idalia, the form of a skeleton.\n\n'Start not,' resumed the Egyptian; 'that friendly guest admonishes us\nbut of the shortness of life.  From its jaws I hear a voice that summons\nus to ENJOY.'\n\nAs he spoke, a group of nymphs surrounded the statue; they laid chaplets\non its pedestal, and, while the cups were emptied and refilled at that\nglowing board, they sang the following strain:\n\n         BACCHIC HYMNS TO THE IMAGE OF DEATH\n\n                    I\n\n        Thou art in the land of the shadowy Host,\n           Thou that didst drink and love:\n         By the Solemn River, a gliding ghost,\n           But thy thought is ours above!\n                If memory yet can fly,\n                Back to the golden sky,\n           And mourn the pleasures lost!\n         By the ruin'd hall these flowers we lay,\n           Where thy soul once held its palace;\n         When the rose to thy scent and sight was gay,\n           And the smile was in the chalice,\n                And the cithara's voice\n                Could bid thy heart rejoice\n           When night eclipsed the day.\n\nHere a new group advancing, turned the tide of the music into a quicker\nand more joyous strain.\n\n\n                    II\n\n        Death, death is the gloomy shore\n           Where we all sail--\n        Soft, soft, thou gliding oar;\n           Blow soft, sweet gale!\n         Chain with bright wreaths the Hours;\n           Victims if all\n         Ever, 'mid song and flowers,\n           Victims should fall!\n\nPausing for a moment, yet quicker and quicker danced the silver-footed\nmusic:\n\n\n        Since Life's so short, we'll live to laugh,\n           Ah! wherefore waste a minute!\n         If youth's the cup we yet can quaff,\n           Be love the pearl within it!\n\nA third band now approached with brimming cups, which they poured in\nlibation upon that strange altar; and once more, slow and solemn, rose\nthe changeful melody:\n\n                  III\n\n        Thou art welcome, Guest of gloom,\n           From the far and fearful sea!\n         When the last rose sheds its bloom,\n           Our board shall be spread with thee!\n              All hail, dark Guest!\n           Who hath so fair a plea\n           Our welcome Guest to be,\n           As thou, whose solemn hall\n           At last shall feast us all\n           In the dim and dismal coast?\n           Long yet be we the Host!\n           And thou, Dead Shadow, thou,\n           All joyless though thy brow,\n               Thou--but our passing GUEST!\n\n\nAt this moment, she who sat beside Apaecides suddenly took up the song:\n\n\n                    IV\n\n        Happy is yet our doom,\n           The earth and the sun are ours!\n         And far from the dreary tomb\n           Speed the wings of the rosy Hours--\n          Sweet is for thee the bowl,\n              Sweet are thy looks, my love;\n           I fly to thy tender soul,\n              As bird to its mated dove!\n                Take me, ah, take!\n           Clasp'd to thy guardian breast,\n           Soft let me sink to rest:\n                But wake me--ah, wake!\n           And tell me with words and sighs,\n           But more with thy melting eyes,\n                That my sun is not set--\n         That the Torch is not quench'd at the Urn\n           That we love, and we breathe, and burn,\n                Tell me--thou lov'st me yet!\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE SECOND\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\nA FLASH HOUSE IN POMPEII, AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CLASSIC RING.\n\nTO one of those parts of Pompeii, which were tenanted not by the lords\nof pleasure, but by its minions and its victims; the haunt of gladiators\nand prize-fighters; of the vicious and the penniless; of the savage and\nthe obscene; the Alsatia of an ancient city--we are now transported.\n\nIt was a large room, that opened at once on the confined and crowded\nlane. Before the threshold was a group of men, whose iron and\nwell-strung muscles, whose short and Herculean necks, whose hardy and\nreckless countenances, indicated the champions of the arena. On a shelf,\nwithout the shop, were ranged jars of wine and oil; and right over this\nwas inserted in the wall a coarse painting, which exhibited gladiators\ndrinking--so ancient and so venerable is the custom of signs!  Within\nthe room were placed several small tables, arranged somewhat in the\nmodern fashion of 'boxes', and round these were seated several knots of\nmen, some drinking, some playing at dice, some at that more skilful game\ncalled 'duodecim scriptae', which certain of the blundering learned have\nmistaken for chess, though it rather, perhaps, resembled backgammon of\nthe two, and was usually, though not always, played by the assistance of\ndice.  The hour was in the early forenoon, and nothing better, perhaps,\nthan that unseasonable time itself denoted the habitual indolence of\nthese tavern loungers.\n\nYet, despite the situation of the house and the character of its\ninmates, it indicated none of that sordid squalor which would have\ncharacterized a similar haunt in a modern city.  The gay disposition of\nall the Pompeians, who sought, at least, to gratify the sense even where\nthey neglected the mind, was typified by the gaudy colors which\ndecorated the walls, and the shapes, fantastic but not inelegant, in\nwhich the lamps, the drinking-cups, the commonest household utensils,\nwere wrought.\n\n'By Pollux!' said one of the gladiators, as he leaned against the wall\nof the threshold, 'the wine thou sellest us, old Silenus'--and as he\nspoke he slapped a portly personage on the back--'is enough to thin the\nbest blood in one's veins.'\n\nThe man thus caressingly saluted, and whose bared arms, white apron, and\nkeys and napkin tucked carelessly within his girdle, indicated him to be\nthe host of the tavern, was already passed into the autumn of his years;\nbut his form was still so robust and athletic, that he might have shamed\neven the sinewy shapes beside him, save that the muscles had seeded, as\nit were, into flesh, that the cheeks were swelled and bloated, and the\nincreasing stomach threw into shade the vast and massive chest which\nrose above it.\n\n'None of thy scurrilous blusterings with me,' growled the gigantic\nlandlord, in the gentle semi-roar of an insulted tiger; 'my wine is good\nenough for a carcass which shall so soon soak the dust of the\nspoliarium.'\n\n'Croakest thou thus, old raven!' returned the gladiator, laughing\nscornfully; 'thou shalt live to hang thyself with despite when thou\nseest me win the palm crown; and when I get the purse at the\namphitheatre, as I certainly shall, my first vow to Hercules shall be to\nforswear thee and thy vile potations evermore.'\n\n'Hear to him--hear to this modest Pyrgopolinices!  He has certainly\nserved under Bombochides Cluninstaridysarchides,' cried the host.\n'Sporus, Niger, Tetraides, he declares he shall win the purse from you.\nWhy, by the gods! each of your muscles is strong enough to stifle all\nhis body, or I know nothing of the arena!'\n\n'Ha!' said the gladiator, coloring with rising fury, 'our lanista would\ntell a different story.'\n\n'What story could he tell against me, vain Lydon?' said Tetraides,\nfrowning.\n\n'Or me, who have conquered in fifteen fights?' said the gigantic Niger,\nstalking up to the gladiator.\n\n'Or me?' grunted Sporus, with eyes of fire.\n\n'Tush!' said Lydon, folding his arms, and regarding his rivals with a\nreckless air of defiance.  'The time of trial will soon come; keep your\nvalor till then.'\n\n'Ay, do,' said the surly host; 'and if I press down my thumb to save\nyou, may the Fates cut my thread!'\n\n'Your rope, you mean,' said Lydon, sneeringly: 'here is a sesterce to\nbuy one.'\n\nThe Titan wine-vender seized the hand extended to him, and griped it in\nso stern a vice that the blood spirted from the fingers' ends over the\ngarments of the bystanders.\n\nThey set up a savage laugh.\n\n'I will teach thee, young braggart, to play the Macedonian with me!  I\nam no puny Persian, I warrant thee!  What, man!  have I not fought\ntwenty years in the ring, and never lowered my arms once?  And have I\nnot received the rod from the editor's own hand as a sign of victory,\nand as a grace to retirement on my laurels?  And am I now to be lectured\nby a boy?' So saying, he flung the hand from him in scorn.\n\nWithout changing a muscle, but with the same smiling face with which he\nhad previously taunted mine host, did the gladiator brave the painful\ngrasp he had undergone.  But no sooner was his hand released, than,\ncrouching for one moment as a wild cat crouches, you might see his hair\nbristle on his head and beard, and with a fierce and shrill yell he\nsprang on the throat of the giant, with an impetus that threw him, vast\nand sturdy as he was, from his balance--and down, with the crash of a\nfalling rock, he fell--while over him fell also his ferocious foe.\n\nOur host, perhaps, had had no need of the rope so kindly recommended to\nhim by Lydon, had he remained three minutes longer in that position.\nBut, summoned to his assistance by the noise of his fall, a woman, who\nhad hitherto kept in an inner apartment, rushed to the scene of battle.\nThis new ally was in herself a match for the gladiator; she was tall,\nlean, and with arms that could give other than soft embraces.  In fact,\nthe gentle helpmate of Burbo the wine-seller had, like himself, fought\nin the lists--nay under the emperor's eye.  And Burbo himself--Burbo,\nthe unconquered in the field, according to report, now and then yielded\nthe palm to his soft Stratonice.  This sweet creature no sooner saw the\nimminent peril that awaited her worse half, than without other weapons\nthan those with which Nature had provided her, she darted upon the\nincumbent gladiator, and, clasping him round the waist with her long and\nsnakelike arms, lifted him by a sudden wrench from the body of her\nhusband, leaving only his hands still clinging to the throat of his foe.\nSo have we seen a dog snatched by the hind legs from the strife with a\nfallen rival in the arms of some envious groom; so have we seen one half\nof him high in air--passive and offenceless--while the other half, head,\nteeth, eyes, claws, seemed buried and engulfed in the mangled and\nprostrate enemy.  Meanwhile, the gladiators, lapped, and pampered, and\nglutted upon blood, crowded delightedly round the combatants--their\nnostrils distended--their lips grinning--their eyes gloatingly fixed on\nthe bloody throat of the one and the indented talons of the other.\n\n'Habet! (he has got it!) habet!' cried they, with a sort of yell,\nrubbing their nervous hands.\n\n'Non habeo, ye liars; I have not got it!' shouted the host, as with a\nmighty effort he wrenched himself from those deadly hands, and rose to\nhis feet, breathless, panting, lacerated, bloody; and fronting, with\nreeling eyes, the glaring look and grinning teeth of his baffled foe,\nnow struggling (but struggling with disdain) in the gripe of the sturdy\namazon.\n\n'Fair play!' cried the gladiators: 'one to one'; and, crowding round\nLydon and the woman, they separated our pleasing host from his courteous\nguest.\n\nBut Lydon, feeling ashamed at his present position, and endeavoring in\nvain to shake off the grasp of the virago, slipped his hand into his\ngirdle, and drew forth a short knife.  So menacing was his look, so\nbrightly gleamed the blade, that Stratonice, who was used only to that\nfashion of battle which we moderns call the pugilistic, started back in\nalarm.\n\n'O gods!' cried she, 'the ruffian!--he has concealed weapons!  Is that\nfair? Is that like a gentleman and a gladiator?  No, indeed, I scorn\nsuch fellows.' With that she contemptuously turned her back on the\ngladiator, and hastened to examine the condition of her husband.\n\nBut he, as much inured to the constitutional exercises as an English\nbull-dog is to a contest with a more gentle antagonist, had already\nrecovered himself.  The purple hues receded from the crimson surface of\nhis cheek, the veins of the forehead retired into their wonted size.  He\nshook himself with a complacent grunt, satisfied that he was still\nalive, and then looking at his foe from head to foot with an air of more\napprobation than he had ever bestowed upon him before:\n\n'By Castor!' said he, 'thou art a stronger fellow than I took thee for!\nI see thou art a man of merit and virtue; give me thy hand, my hero!'\n\n'Jolly old Burbo!' cried the gladiators, applauding, 'staunch to the\nbackbone.  Give him thy hand, Lydon.'\n\n'Oh, to be sure,' said the gladiator: 'but now I have tasted his blood,\nI long to lap the whole.'\n\n'By Hercules!' returned the host, quite unmoved, 'that is the true\ngladiator feeling.  Pollux! to think what good training may make a man;\nwhy, a beast could not be fiercer!'\n\n'A beast!  O dullard! we beat the beasts hollow!' cried Tetraides.\n\n'Well, well,' said Stratonice, who was now employed in smoothing her hair\nand adjusting her dress, 'if ye are all good friends again, I recommend\nyou to be quiet and orderly; for some young noblemen, your patrons and\nbackers, have sent to say they will come here to pay you a visit: they\nwish to see you more at their ease than at the schools, before they make\nup their bets on the great fight at the amphitheatre. So they always\ncome to my house for that purpose: they know we only receive the best\ngladiators in Pompeii--our society is very select--praised be the gods!'\n\n'Yes,' continued Burbo, drinking off a bowl, or rather a pail of wine,\n'a man who has won my laurels can only encourage the brave. Lydon,\ndrink, my boy; may you have an honorable old age like mine!'\n\n'Come here,' said Stratonice, drawing her husband to her affectionately\nby the ears, in that caress which Tibullus has so prettily\ndescribed--'Come here!'\n\n'Not so hard, she-wolf! thou art worse than the gladiator,' murmured the\nhuge jaws of Burbo.\n\n'Hist!' said she, whispering him; 'Calenus has just stole in, disguised,\nby the back way.  I hope he has brought the sesterces.'\n\n'Ho! ho! I will join him,' said Burbo; 'meanwhile, I say, keep a sharp\neye on the cups--attend to the score.  Let them not cheat thee, wife;\nthey are heroes, to be sure, but then they are arrant rogues: Cacus was\nnothing to them.'\n\n'Never fear me, fool!' was the conjugal reply; and Burbo, satisfied with\nthe dear assurance, strode through the apartment, and sought the\npenetralia of his house.\n\n'So those soft patrons are coming to look at our muscles,' said Niger.\n'Who sent to previse thee of it, my mistress?'\n\n'Lepidus.  He brings with him Clodius, the surest better in Pompeii, and\nthe young Greek, Glaucus.'\n\n'A wager on a wager,' cried Tetraides; 'Clodius bets on me, for twenty\nsesterces!  What say you, Lydon?'\n\n'He bets on me!' said Lydon.\n\n'No, on me!' grunted Sporus.\n\n'Dolts! do you think he would prefer any of you to Niger?' said the\nathletic, thus modestly naming himself.\n\n'Well, well,' said Stratonice, as she pierced a huge amphora for her\nguests, who had now seated themselves before one of the tables, 'great\nmen and brave, as ye all think yourselves, which of you will fight the\nNumidian lion in case no malefactor should be found to deprive you of\nthe option?'\n\n'I who have escaped your arms, stout Stratonice,' said Lydon, 'might\nsafely, I think, encounter the lion.'\n\n'But tell me,' said Tetraides, 'where is that pretty young slave of\nyours--the blind girl, with bright eyes?  I have not seen her a long\ntime.'\n\n'Oh! she is too delicate for you, my son of Neptune,' said the hostess,\n'and too nice even for us, I think.  We send her into the town to sell\nflowers and sing to the ladies: she makes us more money so than she\nwould by waiting on you.  Besides, she has often other employments which\nlie under the rose.'\n\n'Other employments!' said Niger; 'why, she is too young for them.'\n\n'Silence, beast!' said Stratonice; 'you think there is no play but the\nCorinthian.  If Nydia were twice the age she is at present, she would be\nequally fit for Vesta--poor girl!'\n\n'But, hark ye, Stratonice,' said Lydon; 'how didst thou come by so\ngentle and delicate a slave?  She were more meet for the handmaid of\nsome rich matron of Rome than for thee.'\n\n'That is true,' returned Stratonice; 'and some day or other I shall make\nmy fortune by selling her.  How came I by Nydia, thou askest.'\n\n'Ay!'\n\n'Why, thou seest, my slave Staphyla--thou rememberest Staphyla, Niger?'\n\n'Ay, a large-handed wench, with a face like a comic mask.  How should I\nforget her, by Pluto, whose handmaid she doubtless is at this moment!'\n\n'Tush, brute!--Well, Staphyla died one day, and a great loss she was to\nme, and I went into the market to buy me another slave.  But, by the\ngods! they were all grown so dear since I had bought poor Staphyla, and\nmoney was so scarce, that I was about to leave the place in despair,\nwhen a merchant plucked me by the robe.  \"Mistress,\" said he, \"dost thou\nwant a slave cheap I have a child to sell--a bargain. She is but little,\nand almost an infant, it is true; but she is quick and quiet, docile and\nclever, sings well, and is of good blood, I assure you.\" \"Of what\ncountry?\" said I.  \"Thessalian.\" Now I knew the Thessalians were acute\nand gentle; so I said I would see the girl.  I found her just as you see\nher now, scarcely smaller and scarcely younger in appearance.  She\nlooked patient and resigned enough, with her hands crossed on her bosom,\nand her eyes downcast. I asked the merchant his price: it was moderate,\nand I bought her at once.  The merchant brought her to my house, and\ndisappeared in an instant.  Well, my friends, guess my astonishment when\nI found she was blind!  Ha! ha! a clever fellow that merchant!  I ran at\nonce to the magistrates, but the rogue was already gone from Pompeii. So\nI was forced to go home in a very ill humor, I assure you; and the poor\ngirl felt the effects of it too.  But it was not her fault that she was\nblind, for she had been so from her birth.  By degrees, we got\nreconciled to our purchase.  True, she had not the strength of Staphyla,\nand was of very little use in the house, but she could soon find her way\nabout the town, as well as if she had the eyes of Argus; and when one\nmorning she brought us home a handful of sesterces, which she said she\nhad got from selling some flowers she had gathered in our poor little\ngarden, we thought the gods had sent her to us.  So from that time we\nlet her go out as she likes, filling her basket with flowers, which she\nwreathes into garlands after the Thessalian fashion, which pleases the\ngallants; and the great people seem to take a fancy to her, for they\nalways pay her more than they do any other flower-girl, and she brings\nall of it home to us, which is more than any other slave would do.  So I\nwork for myself, but I shall soon afford from her earnings to buy me a\nsecond Staphyla; doubtless, the Thessalian kidnapper had stolen the\nblind girl from gentle parents.  Besides her skill in the garlands, she\nsings and plays on the cithara, which also brings money, and lately--but\nthat is a secret.'\n\n'That is a secret! What!' cried Lydon, 'art thou turned sphinx?'\n\n'Sphinx, no!--why sphinx?'\n\n'Cease thy gabble, good mistress, and bring us our meat--I am hungry,'\nsaid Sporus, impatiently.\n\n'And I, too,' echoed the grim Niger, whetting his knife on the palm of\nhis hand.\n\nThe amazon stalked away to the kitchen, and soon returned with a tray\nladen with large pieces of meat half-raw: for so, as now, did the heroes\nof the prize-fight imagine they best sustained their hardihood and\nferocity: they drew round the table with the eyes of famished\nwolves--the meat vanished, the wine flowed.  So leave we those important\npersonages of classic life to follow the steps of Burbo.\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nTWO WORTHIES.\n\nIN the earlier times of Rome the priesthood was a profession, not of\nlucre but of honour.  It was embraced by the noblest citizens--it was\nforbidden to the plebeians.  Afterwards, and long previous to the\npresent date, it was equally open to all ranks; at least, that part of\nthe profession which embraced the flamens, or priests--not of religion\ngenerally but of peculiar gods.  Even the priest of Jupiter (the Flamen\nDialis) preceded by a lictor, and entitled by his office to the entrance\nof the senate, at first the especial dignitary of the patricians, was\nsubsequently the choice of the people.  The less national and less\nhonored deities were usually served by plebeian ministers; and many\nembraced the profession, as now the Roman Catholic Christians enter the\nmonastic fraternity, less from the impulse of devotion than the\nsuggestions of a calculating poverty.  Thus Calenus, the priest of Isis,\nwas of the lowest origin.  His relations, though not his parents, were\nfreedmen.  He had received from them a liberal education, and from his\nfather a small patrimony, which he had soon exhausted.  He embraced the\npriesthood as a last resource from distress.  Whatever the state\nemoluments of the sacred profession, which at that time were probably\nsmall, the officers of a popular temple could never complain of the\nprofits of their calling.  There is no profession so lucrative as that\nwhich practises on the superstition of the multitude.\n\nCalenus had but one surviving relative at Pompeii, and that was Burbo.\nVarious dark and disreputable ties, stronger than those of blood, united\ntogether their hearts and interests; and often the minister of Isis\nstole disguised and furtively from the supposed austerity of his\ndevotions; and gliding through the back door of the retired gladiator, a\nman infamous alike by vices and by profession, rejoiced to throw off the\nlast rag of an hypocrisy which, but for the dictates of avarice, his\nruling passion, would at all time have sat clumsily upon a nature too\nbrutal for even the mimicry of virtue.\n\nWrapped in one of those large mantles which came in use among the Romans\nin proportion as they dismissed the toga, whose ample folds well\nconcealed the form, and in which a sort of hood (attached to it)\nafforded no less a security to the features, Calenus now sat in the\nsmall and private chamber of the wine-cellar, whence a small passage ran\nat once to that back entrance, with which nearly all the houses of\nPompeii were furnished.\n\nOpposite to him sat the sturdy Burbo, carefully counting on a table\nbetween them a little pile of coins which the priest had just poured\nfrom his purse--for purses were as common then as now, with this\ndifference--they were usually better furnished!\n\n'You see,' said Calenus, 'that we pay you handsomely, and you ought to\nthank me for recommending you to so advantageous a market.'\n\n'I do, my cousin, I do,' replied Burbo, affectionately, as he swept the\ncoins into a leathern receptacle, which he then deposited in his girdle,\ndrawing the buckle round his capacious waist more closely than he was\nwont to do in the lax hours of his domestic avocations.  'And by Isis,\nPisis, and Nisis, or whatever other gods there may be in Egypt, my\nlittle Nydia is a very Hesperides--a garden of gold to me.'\n\n'She sings well, and plays like a muse,' returned Calenus; 'those are\nvirtues that he who employs me always pays liberally.'\n\n'He is a god,' cried Burbo, enthusiastically; 'every rich man who is\ngenerous deserves to be worshipped.  But come, a cup of wine, old\nfriend: tell me more about it.  What does she do? she is frightened,\ntalks of her oath, and reveals nothing.'\n\n'Nor will I, by my right hand!  I, too, have taken that terrible oath of\nsecrecy.'\n\n'Oath! what are oaths to men like us?'\n\n'True oaths of a common fashion; but this!'--and the stalwart priest\nshuddered as he spoke.  'Yet,' he continued, in emptying a huge cup of\nunmixed wine, 'I own to thee, that it is not so much the oath that I\ndread as the vengeance of him who proposed it.  By the gods! he is a\nmighty sorcerer, and could draw my confession from the moon, did I dare\nto make it to her.  Talk no more of this.  By Pollux! wild as those\nbanquets are which I enjoy with him, I am never quite at my ease there.\nI love, my boy, one jolly hour with thee, and one of the plain,\nunsophisticated, laughing girls that I meet in this chamber, all\nsmoke-dried though it be, better than whole nights of those magnificent\ndebauches.'\n\n'Ho! sayest thou so!  To-morrow night, please the gods, we will have\nthen a snug carousal.'\n\n'With all my heart,' said the priest, rubbing his hands, and drawing\nhimself nearer to the table.\n\nAt this moment they heard a slight noise at the door, as of one feeling\nthe handle.  The priest lowered the hood over his head.\n\n'Tush!' whispered the host, 'it is but the blind girl,' as Nydia opened\nthe door, and entered the apartment.\n\n'Ho! girl, and how durst thou? thou lookest pale--thou hast kept late\nrevels?  No matter, the young must be always the young,' said Burbo,\nencouragingly.\n\nThe girl made no answer, but she dropped on one of the seats with an air\nof lassitude.  Her color went and came rapidly: she beat the floor\nimpatiently with her small feet, then she suddenly raised her face, and\nsaid with a determined voice:\n\n'Master, you may starve me if you will--you may beat me--you may\nthreaten me with death--but I will go no more to that unholy place!'\n\n'How, fool!' said Burbo, in a savage voice, and his heavy brows met\ndarkly over his fierce and bloodshot eyes; 'how, rebellious! Take care.'\n\n'I have said it,' said the poor girl, crossing her hands on her breast.\n\n'What! my modest one, sweet vestal, thou wilt go no more!  Very well,\nthou shalt be carried.'\n\n'I will raise the city with my cries,' said she, passionately; and the\ncolor mounted to her brow.\n\n'We will take care of that too; thou shalt go gagged.'\n\n'Then may the gods help me!' said Nydia, rising; 'I will appeal to the\nmagistrates.'\n\n'Thine oath remember!' said a hollow voice, as for the first time\nCalenus joined in the dialogue.\n\nAt these words a trembling shook the frame of the unfortunate girl; she\nclasped her hands imploringly.  'Wretch that I am!' she cried, and burst\nviolently into sobs.\n\nWhether or not it was the sound of that vehement sorrow which brought\nthe gentle Stratonice to the spot, her grisly form at this moment\nappeared in the chamber.\n\n'How now? what hast thou been doing with my slave, brute?' said she,\nangrily, to Burbo.\n\n'Be quiet, wife,' said he, in a tone half-sullen, half-timid; 'you want\nnew girdles and fine clothes, do you?  Well then, take care of your\nslave, or you may want them long.  Voe capiti tuo--vengeance on thy\nhead, wretched one!'\n\n'What is this?' said the hag, looking from one to the other.\n\nNydia started as by a sudden impulse from the wall against which she had\nleaned: she threw herself at the feet of Stratonice; she embraced her\nknees, and looking up at her with those sightless but touching eyes:\n\n'O my mistress!' sobbed she, 'you are a woman--you have had sisters--you\nhave been young like me, feel for me--save me!  I will go to those\nhorrible feasts no more!'\n\n'Stuff!' said the hag, dragging her up rudely by one of those delicate\nhands, fit for no harsher labor than that of weaving the flowers which\nmade her pleasure or her trade; 'stuff! these fine scruples are not for\nslaves.'\n\n'Hark ye,' said Burbo, drawing forth his purse, and chinking its\ncontents: 'you hear this music, wife; by Pollux! if you do not break in\nyon colt with a tight rein, you will hear it no more.'\n\n'The girl is tired,' said Stratonice, nodding to Calenus; 'she will be\nmore docile when you next want her.'\n\n'You! you! who is here?' cried Nydia, casting her eyes round the\napartment with so fearful and straining a survey, that Calenus rose in\nalarm from his seat.\n\n'She must see with those eyes!' muttered he.\n\n'Who is here!  Speak, in heaven's name!  Ah, if you were blind like me,\nyou would be less cruel,' said she; and she again burst into tears.\n\n'Take her away,' said Burbo, impatiently; 'I hate these whimperings.'\n\n'Come!' said Stratonice, pushing the poor child by the shoulders.  Nydia\ndrew herself aside, with an air to which resolution gave dignity.\n\n'Hear me,' she said; 'I have served you faithfully--I who was brought\nup--Ah! my mother, my poor mother! didst thou dream I should come to\nthis?' She dashed the tear from her eyes, and proceeded: 'Command me in\naught else, and I will obey; but I tell you now, hard, stern, inexorable\nas you are--I tell you that I will go there no more; or, if I am forced\nthere, that I will implore the mercy of the praetor himself--I have said\nit.  Hear me, ye gods, I swear!'\n\nThe hag's eyes glowed with fire; she seized the child by the hair with\none hand, and raised on high the other--that formidable right hand, the\nleast blow of which seemed capable to crush the frail and delicate form\nthat trembled in her grasp.  That thought itself appeared to strike her,\nfor she suspended the blow, changed her purpose, and dragging Nydia to\nthe wall, seized from a hook a rope, often, alas! applied to a similar\npurpose, and the next moment the shrill, the agonized shrieks of the\nblind girl, rang piercingly through the house.\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nGLAUCUS MAKES A PURCHASE THAT AFTERWARDS COSTS HIM DEAR.\n\n'HOLLA, my brave fellows!' said Lepidus, stooping his head as he entered\nthe low doorway of the house of Burbo.  'We have come to see which of\nyou most honors your lanista.' The gladiators rose from the table in\nrespect to three gallants known to be among the gayest and richest\nyouths of Pompeii, and whose voices were therefore the dispensers of\namphitheatrical reputation.\n\n'What fine animals!' said Clodius to Glaucus: 'worthy to be gladiators!'\n\n'It is a pity they are not warriors,' returned Glaucus.\n\nA singular thing it was to see the dainty and fastidious Lepidus, whom\nin a banquet a ray of daylight seemed to blind--whom in the bath a\nbreeze of air seemed to blast--in whom Nature seemed twisted and\nperverted from every natural impulse, and curdled into one dubious thing\nof effeminacy and art--a singular thing was it to see this Lepidus, now\nall eagerness, and energy, and life, patting the vast shoulders of the\ngladiators with a blanched and girlish hand, feeling with a mincing\ngripe their great brawn and iron muscles, all lost in calculating\nadmiration at that manhood which he had spent his life in carefully\nbanishing from himself.\n\nSo have we seen at this day the beardless flutterers of the saloons of\nLondon thronging round the heroes of the Fives-court--so have we seen\nthem admire, and gaze, and calculate a bet--so have we seen them meet\ntogether, in ludicrous yet in melancholy assemblage, the two extremes of\ncivilized society--the patrons of pleasure and its slaves--vilest of all\nslaves--at once ferocious and mercenary; male prostitutes, who sell\ntheir strength as women their beauty; beasts in act, but baser than\nbeasts in motive, for the last, at least, do not mangle themselves for\nmoney!\n\n'Ha! Niger, how will you fight?' said Lepidus: 'and with whom?'\n\n'Sporus challenges me,' said the grim giant; 'we shall fight to the\ndeath, I hope.'\n\n'Ah! to be sure,' grunted Sporus, with a twinkle of his small eye.\n\n'He takes the sword, I the net and the trident: it will be rare sport. I\nhope the survivor will have enough to keep up the dignity of the crown.'\n\n'Never fear, we'll fill the purse, my Hector,' said Clodius:\n\n'let me see--you fight against Niger?  Glaucus, a bet--I back Niger.'\n\n'I told you so,' cried Niger exultingly.  'The noble Clodius knows me;\ncount yourself dead already, my Sporus.'\n\nClodius took out his tablet.  'A bet--ten sestertia.  What say you?'\n\n'So be it,' said Glaucus.  'But whom have we here?  I never saw this\nhero before'; and he glanced at Lydon, whose limbs were slighter than\nthose of his companions, and who had something of grace, and something\neven of nobleness, in his face, which his profession had not yet wholly\ndestroyed.\n\n'It is Lydon, a youngster, practised only with the wooden sword as yet,'\nanswered Niger, condescendingly.  'But he has the true blood in him, and\nhas challenged Tetraides.'\n\n'He challenged me,' said Lydon: 'I accept the offer.'\n\n'And how do you fight?' asked Lepidus.  'Chut, my boy, wait a while\nbefore you contend with Tetraides.' Lydon smiled disdainfully.\n\n'Is he a citizen or a slave?' said Clodius.\n\n'A citizen--we are all citizens here,' quoth Niger.\n\n'Stretch out your arm, my Lydon,' said Lepidus, with the air of a\nconnoisseur.\n\nThe gladiator, with a significant glance at his companions, extended an\narm which, if not so huge in its girth as those of his comrades, was so\nfirm in its muscles, so beautifully symmetrical in its proportions, that\nthe three visitors uttered simultaneously an admiring exclamation.\n\n'Well, man, what is your weapon?' said Clodius, tablet in hand.\n\n'We are to fight first with the cestus; afterwards, if both survive,\nwith swords,' returned Tetraides, sharply, and with an envious scowl.\n\n'With the cestus!' cried Glaucus; 'there you are wrong, Lydon; the\ncestus is the Greek fashion: I know it well.  You should have encouraged\nflesh for that contest: you are far too thin for it--avoid the cestus.'\n\n'I cannot,' said Lydon.\n\n'And why?'\n\n'I have said--because he has challenged me.'\n\n'But he will not hold you to the precise weapon.'\n\n'My honour holds me!' returned Lydon, proudly.\n\n'I bet on Tetraides, two to one, at the cestus,' said Clodius; shall it\nbe, Lepidus?--even betting, with swords.'\n\n'If you give me three to one, I will not take the odds, said Lepidus:\n'Lydon will never come to the swords.  You are mighty courteous.'\n\n'What say you, Glaucus?' said Clodius.\n\n'I will take the odds three to one.'\n\n'Ten sestertia to thirty.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nClodius wrote the bet in his book.\n\n'Pardon me, noble sponsor mine,' said Lydon, in a low voice to Glaucus:\n'but how much think you the victor will gain?'\n\n'How much? why, perhaps seven sestertia.'\n\n'You are sure it will be as much?'\n\n'At least.  But out on you!--a Greek would have thought of the honour,\nand not the money.  O Italians! everywhere ye are Italians!'\n\nA blush mantled over the bronzed cheek of the gladiator.\n\n'Do not wrong me, noble Glaucus; I think of both, but I should never\nhave been a gladiator but for the money.'\n\n'Base! mayest thou fall!  A miser never was a hero.'\n\n'I am not a miser,' said Lydon, haughtily, and he withdrew to the other\nend of the room.\n\n'But I don't see Burbo; where is Burbo?  I must talk with Burbo,' cried\nClodius.\n\n'He is within,' said Niger, pointing to the door at the extremity of the\nroom.\n\n'And Stratonice, the brave old lass, where is she?' quoth Lepidus.\n\n'Why, she was here just before you entered; but she heard something that\ndispleased her yonder, and vanished.  Pollux! old Burbo had perhaps\ncaught hold of some girl in the back room.  I heard a female's voice\ncrying out; the old dame is as jealous as Juno.'\n\n'Ho! excellent!' cried Lepidus, laughing.  'Come, Clodius, let us go\nshares with Jupiter; perhaps he has caught a Leda.'\n\nAt this moment a loud cry of pain and terror startled the group.\n\n'Oh, spare me! spare me!  I am but a child, I am blind--is not that\npunishment enough?'\n\n'O Pallas!  I know that voice, it is my poor flower-girl!' exclaimed\nGlaucus, and he darted at once into the quarter whence the cry rose.\n\nHe burst the door; he beheld Nydia writhing in the grasp of the\ninfuriate hag; the cord, already dabbled with blood, was raised in the\nair--it was suddenly arrested.\n\n'Fury!' said Glaucus, and with his left hand he caught Nydia from her\ngrasp; 'how dare you use thus a girl--one of your own sex, a child!  My\nNydia, my poor infant!'\n\n'Oh? is that you--is that Glaucus?' exclaimed the flower-girl, in a tone\nalmost of transport; the tears stood arrested on her cheek; she smiled,\nshe clung to his breast, she kissed his robe as she clung.\n\n'And how dare you, pert stranger! interfere between a free woman and her\nslave.  By the gods! despite your fine tunic and your filthy perfumes, I\ndoubt whether you are even a Roman citizen, my mannikin.'\n\n'Fair words, mistress--fair words!' said Clodius, now entering with\nLepidus. 'This is my friend and sworn brother; he must be put under\nshelter of your tongue, sweet one; it rains stones!'\n\n'Give me my slave!' shrieked the virago, placing her mighty grasp on the\nbreast of the Greek.\n\n'Not if all your sister Furies could help you,' answered Glaucus.  'Fear\nnot, sweet Nydia; an Athenian never forsook distress!'\n\n'Holla!' said Burbo, rising reluctantly, 'What turmoil is all this about\na slave?  Let go the young gentleman, wife--let him go: for his sake the\npert thing shall be spared this once.' So saying, he drew, or rather\ndragged off, his ferocious help-mate.\n\n'Methought when we entered,' said Clodius, 'there was another man\npresent?'\n\n'He is gone.'\n\nFor the priest of Isis had indeed thought it high time to vanish.\n\n'Oh, a friend of mine! a brother cupman, a quiet dog, who does not love\nthese snarlings,' said Burbo, carelessly.  'But go, child, you will tear\nthe gentleman's tunic if you cling to him so tight; go, you are\npardoned.'\n\n'Oh, do not--do not forsake me!' cried Nydia, clinging yet closer to the\nAthenian.\n\nMoved by her forlorn situation, her appeal to him, her own innumerable\nand touching graces, the Greek seated himself on one of the rude chairs.\nHe held her on his knees--he wiped the blood from her shoulders with his\nlong hair--he kissed the tears from her cheeks--he whispered to her a\nthousand of those soothing words with which we calm the grief of a\nchild--and so beautiful did he seem in his gentle and consoling task,\nthat even the fierce heart of Stratonice was touched.  His presence\nseemed to shed light over that base and obscene haunt--young, beautiful,\nglorious, he was the emblem of all that earth made most happy,\ncomforting one that earth had abandoned!\n\n'Well, who could have thought our blind Nydia had been so honored!' said\nthe virago, wiping her heated brow.\n\nGlaucus looked up at Burbo.\n\n'My good man,' said he, 'this is your slave; she sings well, she is\naccustomed to the care of flowers--I wish to make a present of such a\nslave to a lady.  Will you sell her to me?' As he spoke he felt the\nwhole frame of the poor girl tremble with delight; she started up, she\nput her disheveled hair from her eyes, she looked around, as if, alas,\nshe had the power to see!\n\n'Sell our Nydia! no, indeed,' said Stratonice, gruffly.\n\nNydia sank back with a long sigh, and again clasped the robe of her\nprotector.\n\n'Nonsense!' said Clodius, imperiously: 'you must oblige me. What, man!\nwhat, old dame! offend me, and your trade is ruined.  Is not Burbo my\nkinsman Pansa's client?  Am I not the oracle of the amphitheatre and its\nheroes?  If I say the word, break up your wine-jars--you sell no more.\nGlaucus, the slave is yours.'\n\nBurbo scratched his huge head, in evident embarrassment.\n\n'The girl is worth her weight in gold to me.'\n\n'Name your price, I am rich,' said Glaucus.\n\nThe ancient Italians were like the modern, there was nothing they would\nnot sell, much less a poor blind girl.\n\n'I paid six sestertia for her, she is worth twelve now,' muttered\nStratonice.\n\n'You shall have twenty; come to the magistrates at once, and then to my\nhouse for your money.'\n\n'I would not have sold the dear girl for a hundred but to oblige noble\nClodius,' said Burbo, whiningly.  'And you will speak to Pansa about the\nplace of designator at the amphitheatre, noble Clodius? it would just\nsuit me.'\n\n'Thou shalt have it,' said Clodius; adding in a whisper to Burbo, 'Yon\nGreek can make your fortune; money runs through him like a sieve: mark\nto-day with white chalk, my Priam.'\n\n'An dabis?' said Glaucus, in the formal question of sale and barter.\n\n'Dabitur,' answered Burbo.\n\n'Then, then, I am to go with you--with you?  O happiness!' murmured\nNydia.\n\n'Pretty one, yes; and thy hardest task henceforth shall be to sing thy\nGrecian hymns to the loveliest lady in Pompeii.'\n\nThe girl sprang from his clasp; a change came over her whole face,\nbright the instant before; she sighed heavily, and then once more taking\nhis hand, she said:\n\n'I thought I was to go to your house?'\n\n'And so thou shalt for the present; come, we lose time.'\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nTHE RIVAL OF GLAUCUS PRESSES ONWARD IN THE RACE.\n\nIONE was one of those brilliant characters which, but once or twice,\nflash across our career.  She united in the highest perfection the\nrarest of earthly gifts--Genius and Beauty.  No one ever possessed\nsuperior intellectual qualities without knowing them--the alliteration\nof modesty and merit is pretty enough, but where merit is great, the\nveil of that modesty you admire never disguises its extent from its\npossessor.  It is the proud consciousness of certain qualities that it\ncannot reveal to the everyday world, that gives to genius that shy, and\nreserved, and troubled air, which puzzles and flatters you when you\nencounter it.\n\nIone, then, knew her genius; but, with that charming versatility that\nbelongs of right to women, she had the faculty so few of a kindred\ngenius in the less malleable sex can claim--the faculty to bend and\nmodel her graceful intellect to all whom it encountered. The sparkling\nfountain threw its waters alike upon the strand, the cavern, and the\nflowers; it refreshed, it smiled, it dazzled everywhere.  That pride,\nwhich is the necessary result of superiority, she wore easily--in her\nbreast it concentred itself in independence.  She pursued thus her own\nbright and solitary path.  She asked no aged matron to direct and guide\nher--she walked alone by the torch of her own unflickering purity.  She\nobeyed no tyrannical and absolute custom.  She moulded custom to her own\nwill, but this so delicately and with so feminine a grace, so perfect an\nexemption from error, that you could not say she outraged custom but\ncommanded it.  The wealth of her graces was inexhaustible--she\nbeautified the commonest action; a word, a look from her, seemed magic.\nLove her, and you entered into a new world, you passed from this trite\nand commonplace earth.  You were in a land in which your eyes saw\neverything through an enchanted medium.  In her presence you felt as if\nlistening to exquisite music; you were steeped in that sentiment which\nhas so little of earth in it, and which music so well inspires--that\nintoxication which refines and exalts, which seizes, it is true, the\nsenses, but gives them the character of the soul.\n\nShe was peculiarly formed, then, to command and fascinate the less\nordinary and the bolder natures of men; to love her was to unite two\npassions, that of love and of ambition--you aspired when you adored her.\nIt was no wonder that she had completely chained and subdued the\nmysterious but burning soul of the Egyptian, a man in whom dwelt the\nfiercest passions.  Her beauty and her soul alike enthralled him.\n\nSet apart himself from the common world, he loved that daringness of\ncharacter which also made itself, among common things, aloof and alone.\nHe did not, or he would not see, that that very isolation put her yet\nmore from him than from the vulgar.  Far as the poles--far as the night\nfrom day, his solitude was divided from hers.  He was solitary from his\ndark and solemn vices--she from her beautiful fancies and her purity of\nvirtue.\n\nIf it was not strange that Ione thus enthralled the Egyptian, far less\nstrange was it that she had captured, as suddenly as irrevocably,  the\nbright and sunny heart of the Athenian.  The gladness of a temperament\nwhich seemed woven from the beams of light had led Glaucus into\npleasure.  He obeyed no more vicious dictates when he wandered into the\ndissipations of his time, than the exhilarating voices of youth and\nhealth.  He threw the brightness of his nature over every abyss and\ncavern through which he strayed.  His imagination dazzled him, but his\nheart never was corrupted. Of far more penetration than his companions\ndeemed, he saw that they sought to prey upon his riches and his youth:\nbut he despised wealth save as the means of enjoyment, and youth was the\ngreat sympathy that united him to them.  He felt, it is true, the\nimpulse of nobler thoughts and higher aims than in pleasure could be\nindulged: but the world was one vast prison, to which the Sovereign of\nRome was the Imperial gaoler; and the very virtues, which in the free\ndays of Athens would have made him ambitious, in the slavery of earth\nmade him inactive and supine.  For in that unnatural and bloated\ncivilization, all that was noble in emulation was forbidden. Ambition in\nthe regions of a despotic and luxurious court was but the contest of\nflattery and craft.  Avarice had become the sole ambition--men desired\npraetorships and provinces only as the license to pillage, and\ngovernment was but the excuse of rapine.  It is in small states that\nglory is most active and pure--the more confined the limits of the\ncircle, the more ardent the patriotism.  In small states, opinion is\nconcentrated and strong--every eye reads your actions--your public\nmotives are blended with your private ties--every spot in your narrow\nsphere is crowded with forms familiar since your childhood--the applause\nof your citizens is like the caresses of your friends.  But in large\nstates, the city is but the court: the provinces--unknown to you,\nunfamiliar in customs, perhaps in language--have no claim on your\npatriotism, the ancestry of their inhabitants is not yours.  In the\ncourt you desire favor instead of glory; at a distance from the court,\npublic opinion has vanished from you, and self-interest has no\ncounterpoise.\n\nItaly, Italy, while I write, your skies are over me--your seas flow\nbeneath my feet, listen not to the blind policy which would unite all\nyour crested cities, mourning for their republics, into one empire;\nfalse, pernicious delusion! your only hope of regeneration is in\ndivision.  Florence, Milan, Venice, Genoa, may be free once more, if\neach is free.  But dream not of freedom for the whole while you enslave\nthe parts; the heart must be the centre of the system, the blood must\ncirculate freely everywhere; and in vast communities you behold but a\nbloated and feeble giant, whose brain is imbecile, whose limbs are dead,\nand who pays in disease and weakness the penalty of transcending the\nnatural proportions of health and vigour.\n\nThus thrown back upon themselves, the more ardent qualities of Glaucus\nfound no vent, save in that overflowing imagination which gave grace to\npleasure, and poetry to thought.  Ease was less despicable than\ncontention with parasites and slaves, and luxury could yet be refined\nthough ambition could not be ennobled.  But all that was best and\nbrightest in his soul woke at once when he knew Ione.  Here was an\nempire, worthy of demigods to attain; here was a glory, which the\nreeking smoke of a foul society could not soil or dim.  Love, in every\ntime, in every state, can thus find space for its golden altars. And\ntell me if there ever, even in the ages most favorable to glory, could\nbe a triumph more exalted and elating than the conquest of one noble\nheart?\n\nAnd whether it was that this sentiment inspired him, his ideas glowed\nmore brightly, his soul seemed more awake and more visible, in Ione's\npresence. If natural to love her, it was natural that she should return\nthe passion. Young, brilliant, eloquent, enamoured, and Athenian, he was\nto her as the incarnation of the poetry of her father's land.  They were\nnot like creatures of a world in which strife and sorrow are the\nelements; they were like things to be seen only in the holiday of\nnature, so glorious and so fresh were their youth, their beauty, and\ntheir love.  They seemed out of place in the harsh and every-day earth;\nthey belonged of right to the Saturnian age, and the dreams of demigod\nand nymph.  It was as if the poetry of life gathered and fed itself in\nthem, and in their hearts were concentrated the last rays of the sun of\nDelos and of Greece.\n\nBut if Ione was independent in her choice of life, so was her modest\npride proportionably vigilant and easily alarmed.  The falsehood of the\nEgyptian was invented by a deep knowledge of her nature.  The story of\ncoarseness, of indelicacy, in Glaucus, stung her to the quick.  She felt\nit a reproach upon her character and her career, a punishment above all\nto her love; she felt, for the first time, how suddenly she had yielded\nto that love; she blushed with shame at a weakness, the extent of which\nshe was startled to perceive: she imagined it was that weakness which\nhad incurred the contempt of Glaucus; she endured the bitterest curse of\nnoble natures--humiliation!  Yet her love, perhaps, was no less alarmed\nthan her pride.  If one moment she murmured reproaches upon Glaucus--if\none moment she renounced, she almost hated him--at the next she burst\ninto passionate tears, her heart yielded to its softness, and she said\nin the bitterness of anguish, 'He despises me--he does not love me.'\n\nFrom the hour the Egyptian had left her she had retired to her most\nsecluded chamber, she had shut out her handmaids, she had denied herself\nto the crowds that besieged her door.  Glaucus was excluded with the\nrest; he wondered, but he guessed not why!  He never attributed to his\nIone--his queen--his goddess--that woman-like caprice of which the\nlove-poets of Italy so unceasingly complain.  He imagined her, in the\nmajesty of her candour, above all the arts that torture.  He was\ntroubled, but his hopes were not dimmed, for he knew already that he\nloved and was beloved; what more could he desire as an amulet against\nfear?\n\nAt deepest night, then, when the streets were hushed, and the high moon\nonly beheld his devotions, he stole to that temple of his heart--her\nhome; and wooed her after the beautiful fashion of his country.  He\ncovered her threshold with the richest garlands, in which every flower\nwas a volume of sweet passion; and he charmed the long summer night with\nthe sound of the Lydian lute: and verses, which the inspiration of the\nmoment sufficed to weave.\n\nBut the window above opened not; no smile made yet more holy the shining\nair of night.  All was still and dark.  He knew not if his verse was\nwelcome and his suit was heard.\n\nYet Ione slept not, nor disdained to hear.  Those soft strains ascended\nto her chamber; they soothed, they subdued her.  While she listened, she\nbelieved nothing against her lover; but when they were stilled at last,\nand his step departed, the spell ceased; and, in the bitterness of her\nsoul, she almost conceived in that delicate flattery a new affront.\n\nI said she was denied to all; but there was one exception, there was one\nperson who would not be denied, assuming over her actions and her house\nsomething like the authority of a parent; Arbaces, for himself, claimed\nan exemption from all the ceremonies observed by others.  He entered the\nthreshold with the license of one who feels that he is privileged and at\nhome.  He made his way to her solitude and with that sort of quiet and\nunapologetic air which seemed to consider the right as a thing of\ncourse. With all the independence of Ione's character, his heart had\nenabled him to obtain a secret and powerful control over her mind.  She\ncould not shake it off; sometimes she desired to do so; but she never\nactively struggled against it.  She was fascinated by his serpent eye.\nHe arrested, he commanded her, by the magic of a mind long accustomed to\nawe and to subdue. Utterly unaware of his real character or his hidden\nlove, she felt for him the reverence which genius feels for wisdom, and\nvirtue for sanctity.  She regarded him as one of those mighty sages of\nold, who attained to the mysteries of knowledge by an exemption from the\npassions of their kind.  She scarcely considered him as a being, like\nherself, of the earth, but as an oracle at once dark and sacred.  She\ndid not love him, but she feared.  His presence was unwelcome to her; it\ndimmed her spirit even in its brightest mood; he seemed, with his\nchilling and lofty aspect, like some eminence which casts a shadow over\nthe sun.  But she never thought of forbidding his visits.  She was\npassive under the influence which created in her breast, not the\nrepugnance, but something of the stillness of terror.\n\nArbaces himself now resolved to exert all his arts to possess himself of\nthat treasure he so burningly coveted.  He was cheered and elated by his\nconquests over her brother.  From the hour in which Apaecides fell\nbeneath the voluptuous sorcery of that fete which we have described, he\nfelt his empire over the young priest triumphant and insured.  He knew\nthat there is no victim so thoroughly subdued as a young and fervent man\nfor the first time delivered to the thraldom of the senses.\n\nWhen Apaecides recovered, with the morning light, from the profound\nsleep which succeeded to the delirium of wonder and of pleasure, he was,\nit is true, ashamed--terrified--appalled.  His vows of austerity and\ncelibacy echoed in his ear; his thirst after holiness--had it been\nquenched at so unhallowed a stream?  But Arbaces knew well the means by\nwhich to confirm his conquest.  From the arts of pleasure he led the\nyoung priest at once to those of his mysterious wisdom.  He bared to his\namazed eyes the initiatory secrets of the sombre philosophy of the\nNile--those secrets plucked from the stars, and the wild chemistry,\nwhich, in those days, when Reason herself was but the creature of\nImagination, might well pass for the lore of a diviner magic.  He seemed\nto the young eyes of the priest as a being above mortality, and endowed\nwith supernatural gifts.  That yearning and intense desire for the\nknowledge which is not of earth--which had burned from his boyhood in\nthe heart of the priest--was dazzled, until it confused and mastered his\nclearer sense. He gave himself to the art which thus addressed at once\nthe two strongest of human passions, that of pleasure and that of\nknowledge. He was loth to believe that one so wise could err, that one\nso lofty could stoop to deceive.  Entangled in the dark web of\nmetaphysical moralities, he caught at the excuse by which the Egyptian\nconverted vice into a virtue.  His pride was insensibly flattered that\nArbaces had deigned to rank him with himself, to set him apart from the\nlaws which bound the vulgar, to make him an august participator, both in\nthe mystic studies and the magic fascinations of the Egyptian's\nsolitude.  The pure and stern lessons of that creed to which Olinthus\nhad sought to make him convert, were swept away from his memory by the\ndeluge of new passions. And the Egyptian, who was versed in the articles\nof that true faith, and who soon learned from his pupil the effect which\nhad been produced upon him by its believers, sought, not unskilfully, to\nundo that effect, by a tone of reasoning, half-sarcastic and\nhalf-earnest.\n\n'This faith,' said he, 'is but a borrowed plagiarism from one of the\nmany allegories invented by our priests of old.  Observe,' he added,\npointing to a hieroglyphical scroll--'observe in these ancient figures\nthe origin of the Christian's Trinity.  Here are also three gods--the\nDeity, the Spirit, and the Son.  Observe, that the epithet of the Son is\n\"Saviour\"--observe, that the sign by which his human qualities are\ndenoted is the cross.' Note here, too, the mystic history of Osiris, how\nhe put on death; how he lay in the grave; and how, thus fulfilling a\nsolemn atonement, he rose again from the dead!  In these stories we but\ndesign to paint an allegory from the operations of nature and the\nevolutions of the eternal heavens.  But the allegory unknown, the types\nthemselves have furnished to credulous nations the materials of many\ncreeds.  They have travelled to the vast plains of India; they have\nmixed themselves up in the visionary speculations of the Greek; becoming\nmore and more gross and embodied, as they emerge farther from the\nshadows of their antique origin, they have assumed a human and palpable\nform in this novel faith; and the believers of Galilee are but the\nunconscious repeaters of one of the superstitions of the Nile!'\n\nThis was the last argument which completely subdued the priest.  It was\nnecessary to him, as to all, to believe in something; and undivided and,\nat last, unreluctant, he surrendered himself to that belief which\nArbaces inculcated, and which all that was human in passion--all that\nwas flattering in vanity--all that was alluring in pleasure, served to\ninvite to, and contributed to confirm.\n\nThis conquest, thus easily made, the Egyptian could now give himself\nwholly up to the pursuit of a far dearer and mightier object; and he\nhailed, in his success with the brother, an omen of his triumph over the\nsister.\n\nHe had seen Ione on the day following the revel we have witnessed; and\nwhich was also the day after he had poisoned her mind against his rival.\nThe next day, and the next, he saw her also: and each time he laid\nhimself out with consummate art, partly to confirm her impression\nagainst Glaucus, and principally to prepare her for the impressions he\ndesired her to receive. The proud Ione took care to conceal the anguish\nshe endured; and the pride of woman has an hypocrisy which can deceive\nthe most penetrating, and shame the most astute.  But Arbaces was no\nless cautious not to recur to a subject which he felt it was most\npolitic to treat as of the lightest importance. He knew that by dwelling\nmuch upon the fault of a rival, you only give him dignity in the eyes of\nyour mistress: the wisest plan is, neither loudly to hate, nor bitterly\nto contemn; the wisest plan is to lower him by an indifference of tone,\nas if you could not dream that he could be loved. Your safety is in\nconcealing the wound to your own pride, and imperceptibly alarming that\nof the umpire, whose voice is fate!  Such, in all times, will be the\npolicy of one who knows the science of the sex--it was now the\nEgyptian's.\n\nHe recurred no more, then, to the presumption of Glaucus; he mentioned\nhis name, but not more often than that of Clodius or of Lepidus.  He\naffected to class them together as things of a low and ephemeral\nspecies; as things wanting nothing of the butterfly, save its innocence\nand its grace. Sometimes he slightly alluded to some invented debauch,\nin which he declared them companions; sometimes he adverted to them as\nthe antipodes of those lofty and spiritual natures, to whose order that\nof Ione belonged.  Blinded alike by the pride of Ione, and, perhaps, by\nhis own, he dreamed not that she already loved; but he dreaded lest she\nmight have formed for Glaucus the first fluttering prepossessions that\nlead to love.  And, secretly, he ground his teeth in rage and jealousy,\nwhen he reflected on the youth, the fascinations, and the brilliancy of\nthat formidable rival whom he pretended to undervalue.\n\nIt was on the fourth day from the date of the close of the previous\nbook, that Arbaces and Ione sat together.\n\n'You wear your veil at home,' said the Egyptian; 'that is not fair to\nthose whom you honour with your friendship.'\n\n'But to Arbaces,' answered Ione, who, indeed, had cast the veil over her\nfeatures to conceal eyes red with weeping--'to Arbaces, who looks only\nto the mind, what matters it that the face is concealed?'\n\n'I do look only to the mind,' replied the Egyptian: 'show me then your\nface--for there I shall see it.'\n\n'You grow gallant in the air of Pompeii,' said Ione, with a forced tone\nof gaiety.\n\n'Do you think, fair Ione, that it is only at Pompeii that I have learned\nto value you?' The Egyptian's voice trembled--he paused for a moment,\nand then resumed.\n\n'There is a love, beautiful Greek, which is not the love only of the\nthoughtless and the young--there is a love which sees not with the eyes,\nwhich hears not with the ears; but in which soul is enamoured of soul.\nThe countryman of thy ancestors, the cave-nursed Plato, dreamed of such\na love--his followers have sought to imitate it; but it is a love that\nis not for the herd to echo--it is a love that only high and noble\nnatures can conceive--it hath nothing in common with the sympathies and\nties of coarse affection--wrinkles do not revolt it--homeliness of\nfeature does not deter; it asks youth, it is true, but it asks it only\nin the freshness of the emotions; it asks beauty, it is true, but it is\nthe beauty of the thought and of the spirit.  Such is the love, O Ione,\nwhich is a worthy offering to thee from the cold and the austere.\nAustere and cold thou deemest me--such is the love that I venture to lay\nupon thy shrine--thou canst receive it without a blush.'\n\n'And its name is friendship!' replied Ione: her answer was innocent, yet\nit sounded like the reproof of one conscious of the design of the\nspeaker.\n\n'Friendship!' said Arbaces, vehemently.  'No; that is a word too often\nprofaned to apply to a sentiment so sacred.  Friendship! it is a tie\nthat binds fools and profligates! Friendship! it is the bond that unites\nthe frivolous hearts of a Glaucus and a Clodius! Friendship! no, that is\nan affection of earth, of vulgar habits and sordid sympathies; the\nfeeling of which I speak is borrowed from the stars'--it partakes of\nthat mystic and ineffable yearning, which we feel when we gaze on\nthem--it burns, yet it purifies--it is the lamp of naphtha in the\nalabaster vase, glowing with fragrant odorous, but shining only through\nthe purest vessels.  No; it is not love, and it is not friendship, that\nArbaces feels for Ione.  Give it no name--earth has no name for it--it\nis not of earth--why debase it with earthly epithets and earthly\nassociations?'\n\nNever before had Arbaces ventured so far, yet he felt his ground step by\nstep: he knew that he uttered a language which, if at this day of\naffected platonisms it would speak unequivocally to the ears of beauty,\nwas at that time strange and unfamiliar, to which no precise idea could\nbe attached, from which he could imperceptibly advance or recede, as\noccasion suited, as hope encouraged or fear deterred. Ione trembled,\nthough she knew not why; her veil hid her features, and masked an\nexpression, which, if seen by the Egyptian, would have at once damped\nand enraged him; in fact, he never was more displeasing to her--the\nharmonious modulation of the most suasive voice that ever disguised\nunhallowed thought fell discordantly on her ear.  Her whole soul was\nstill filled with the image of Glaucus; and the accent of tenderness\nfrom another only revolted and dismayed; yet she did not conceive that\nany passion more ardent than that platonism which Arbaces expressed\nlurked beneath his words.  She thought that he, in truth, spoke only of\nthe affection and sympathy of the soul; but was it not precisely that\naffection and that sympathy which had made a part of those emotions she\nfelt for Glaucus; and could any other footstep than his approach the\nhaunted adytum of her heart?\n\nAnxious at once to change the conversation, she replied, therefore, with\na cold and indifferent voice, 'Whomsoever Arbaces honors with the\nsentiment of esteem, it is natural that his elevated wisdom should color\nthat sentiment with its own hues; it is natural that his friendship\nshould be purer than that of others, whose pursuits and errors he does\nnot deign to share.  But tell me, Arbaces, hast thou seen my brother of\nlate?  He has not visited me for several days; and when I last saw him\nhis manner disturbed and alarmed me much.  I fear lest he was too\nprecipitate in the severe choice that he has adopted, and that he\nrepents an irrevocable step.'\n\n'Be cheered, Ione,' replied the Egyptian.  'It is true that, some little\ntime since he was troubled and sad of spirit; those doubts beset him\nwhich were likely to haunt one of that fervent temperament, which ever\nebbs and flows, and vibrates between excitement and exhaustion.  But he,\nIone, he came to me his anxieties and his distress; he sought one who\npitied me and loved him; I have calmed his mind--I have removed his\ndoubts--I have taken him from the threshold of Wisdom into its temple;\nand before the majesty of the goddess his soul is hushed and soothed.\nFear not, he will repent no more; they who trust themselves to Arbaces\nnever repent but for a moment.'\n\n'You rejoice me,' answered Ione.  'My dear brother! in his contentment I\nam happy.'\n\nThe conversation then turned upon lighter subjects; the Egyptian exerted\nhimself to please, he condescended even to entertain; the vast variety\nof his knowledge enabled him to adorn and light up every subject on\nwhich he touched; and Ione, forgetting the displeasing effect of his\nformer words, was carried away, despite her sadness, by the magic of his\nintellect.  Her manner became unrestrained and her language fluent; and\nArbaces, who had waited his opportunity, now hastened to seize it.\n\n'You have never seen,' said he, 'the interior of my home; it may amuse\nyou to do so: it contains some rooms that may explain to you what you\nhave often asked me to describe--the fashion of an Egyptian house; not\nindeed, that you will perceive in the poor and minute proportions of\nRoman architecture the massive strength, the vast space, the gigantic\nmagnificence, or even the domestic construction of the palaces of Thebes\nand Memphis; but something there is, here and there, that may serve to\nexpress to you some notion of that antique civilization which has\nhumanized the world.  Devote, then, to the austere friend of your youth,\none of these bright summer evenings, and let me boast that my gloomy\nmansion has been honored with the presence of the admired Ione.'\n\nUnconscious of the pollutions of the mansion, of the danger that awaited\nher, Ione readily assented to the proposal.  The next evening was fixed\nfor the visit; and the Egyptian, with a serene countenance, and a heart\nbeating with fierce and unholy joy, departed. Scarce had he gone, when\nanother visitor claimed admission....  But now we return to Glaucus.\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nTHE POOR TORTOISE.  NEW CHANGES FOR NYDIA.\n\nTHE morning sun shone over the small and odorous garden enclosed within\nthe peristyle of the house of the Athenian.  He lay reclined, sad and\nlistlessly, on the smooth grass which intersected the viridarium; and a\nslight canopy stretched above, broke the fierce rays of the summer sun.\n\nWhen that fairy mansion was first disinterred from the earth they found\nin the garden the shell of a tortoise that had been its inmate.  That\nanimal, so strange a link in the creation, to which Nature seems to have\ndenied all the pleasure of life, save life's passive and dream-like\nperception, had been the guest of the place for years before Glaucus\npurchased it; for years, indeed which went beyond the memory of man, and\nto which tradition assigned an almost incredible date.  The house\nhad been built and rebuilt--its possessors had changed and\nfluctuated--generations had flourished and decayed--and still the\ntortoise dragged on its slow and unsympathizing existence.  In the\nearthquake, which sixteen years before had overthrown many of the public\nbuildings of the city, and scared away the amazed inhabitants, the house\nnow inhabited by Glaucus had been terribly shattered.  The possessors\ndeserted it for many days; on their return they cleared away the ruins\nwhich encumbered the viridarium, and found still the tortoise, unharmed\nand unconscious of the surrounding destruction.  It seemed to bear a\ncharmed life in its languid blood and imperceptible motions; yet it was\nnot so inactive as it seemed: it held a regular and monotonous course;\ninch by inch it traversed the little orbit of its domain, taking months\nto accomplish the whole gyration.  It was a restless voyager, that\ntortoise!--patiently, and with pain, did it perform its self-appointed\njourneys, evincing no interest in the things around it--a philosopher\nconcentrated in itself.  There was something grand in its solitary\nselfishness!--the sun in which it basked--the waters poured daily over\nit--the air, which it insensibly inhaled, were its sole and unfailing\nluxuries.  The mild changes of the season, in that lovely clime,\naffected it not.  It covered itself with its shell--as the saint in his\npiety--as the sage in his wisdom--as the lover in his hope.\n\nIt was impervious to the shocks and mutations of time--it was an emblem\nof time itself: slow, regular, perpetual; unwitting of the passions that\nfret themselves around--of the wear and tear of mortality.  The poor\ntortoise! nothing less than the bursting of volcanoes, the convulsions\nof the riven world, could have quenched its sluggish spark!  The\ninexorable Death, that spared not pomp or beauty, passed unheedingly by\na thing to which death could bring so insignificant a change.\n\nFor this animal the mercurial and vivid Greek felt all the wonder and\naffection of contrast.  He could spend hours in surveying its creeping\nprogress, in moralizing over its mechanism.  He despised it in joy--he\nenvied it in sorrow.\n\nRegarding it now as he lay along the sward--its dull mass moving while\nit seemed motionless, the Athenian murmured to himself:\n\n'The eagle dropped a stone from his talons, thinking to break thy shell:\nthe stone crushed the head of a poet.  This is the allegory of Fate!\nDull thing!  Thou hadst a father and a mother; perhaps, ages ago, thou\nthyself hadst a mate.  Did thy parents love, or didst thou?  Did thy\nslow blood circulate more gladly when thou didst creep to the side of\nthy wedded one? Wert thou capable of affection? Could it distress thee\nif she were away from thy side?  Couldst thou feel when she was present?\nWhat would I not give to know the history of thy mailed breast--to gaze\nupon the mechanism of thy faint desires--to mark what hair-breadth\ndifference separates thy sorrow from thy joy!  Yet, methinks, thou\nwouldst know if Ione were present!  Thou wouldst feel her coming like a\nhappier air--like a gladder sun.  I envy thee now, for thou knowest not\nthat she is absent; and I--would I could be like thee--between the\nintervals of seeing her!  What doubt, what presentiment, haunts me! why\nwill she not admit me?  Days have passed since I heard her voice.  For\nthe first time, life grows flat to me.  I am as one who is left alone at\na banquet, the lights dead, and the flowers faded.  Ah! Ione, couldst\nthou dream how I adore thee!'\n\nFrom these enamoured reveries, Glaucus was interrupted by the entrance\nof Nydia.  She came with her light, though cautious step, along the\nmarble tablinum.  She passed the portico, and paused at the flowers\nwhich bordered the garden.  She had her water-vase in her hand, and she\nsprinkled the thirsting plants, which seemed to brighten at her\napproach.  She bent to inhale their odor.  She touched them timidly and\ncaressingly.  She felt, along their stems, if any withered leaf or\ncreeping insect marred their beauty.  And as she hovered from flower to\nflower, with her earnest and youthful countenance and graceful motions,\nyou could not have imagined a fitter handmaid for the goddess of the\ngarden.\n\n'Nydia, my child!' said Glaucus.\n\nAt the sound of his voice she paused at once--listening, blushing,\nbreathless; with her lips parted, her face upturned to catch the\ndirection of the sound, she laid down the vase--she hastened to him; and\nwonderful it was to see how unerringly she threaded her dark way through\nthe flowers, and came by the shortest path to the side of her new lord.\n\n'Nydia,' said Glaucus, tenderly stroking back her long and beautiful\nhair, 'it is now three days since thou hast been under the protection of\nmy household gods.  Have they smiled on thee?  Art thou happy?'\n\n'Ah! so happy!' sighed the slave.\n\n'And now,' continued Glaucus, 'that thou hast recovered somewhat from\nthe hateful recollections of thy former state,--and now that they have\nfitted thee (touching her broidered tunic) with garments more meet for\nthy delicate shape--and now, sweet child, that thou hast accustomed\nthyself to a happiness, which may the gods grant thee ever! I am about\nto pray at thy hands a boon.'\n\n'Oh! what can I do for thee?' said Nydia, clasping her hands.\n\n'Listen,' said Glaucus, 'and young as thou art, thou shalt be my\nconfidant. Hast thou ever heard the name of Ione?'\n\nThe blind girl gasped for breath, and turning pale as one of the statues\nwhich shone upon them from the peristyle, she answered with an effort,\nand after a moment's pause:\n\n'Yes!  I have heard that she is of Neapolis, and beautiful.'\n\n'Beautiful! her beauty is a thing to dazzle the day!  Neapolis! nay, she\nis Greek by origin; Greece only could furnish forth such shapes.  Nydia,\nI love her!'\n\n'I thought so,' replied Nydia, calmly.\n\n'I love, and thou shalt tell her so.  I am about to send thee to her.\nHappy Nydia, thou wilt be in her chamber--thou wilt drink the music of\nher voice--thou wilt bask in the sunny air of her presence!'\n\n'What! what! wilt thou send me from thee?'\n\n'Thou wilt go to Ione,' answered Glaucus, in a tone that said, 'What\nmore canst thou desire?'\n\nNydia burst into tears.\n\nGlaucus, raising himself, drew her towards him with the soothing\ncaresses of a brother.\n\n'My child, my Nydia, thou weepest in ignorance of the happiness I bestow\non thee.  She is gentle, and kind, and soft as the breeze of spring. She\nwill be a sister to thy youth--she will appreciate thy winning\ntalents--she will love thy simple graces as none other could, for they\nare like her own. Weepest thou still, fond fool?  I will not force thee,\nsweet. Wilt thou not do for me this kindness?'\n\n'Well, if I can serve thee, command.  See, I weep no longer--I am calm.'\n\n'That is my own Nydia,' continued Glaucus, kissing her hand. 'Go, then,\nto her: if thou art disappointed in her kindness--if I have deceived\nthee, return when thou wilt.  I do not give thee to another; I but lend.\nMy home ever be thy refuge, sweet one.  Ah! would it could shelter all\nthe friendless and distressed!  But if my heart whispers truly, I shall\nclaim thee again soon, my child.  My home and Ione's will become the\nsame, and thou shalt dwell with both.'\n\nA shiver passed through the slight frame of the blind girl, but she wept\nno more--she was resigned.\n\n'Go, then, my Nydia, to Ione's house--they shall show thee the way. Take\nher the fairest flowers thou canst pluck; the vase which contains them I\nwill give thee: thou must excuse its unworthiness.  Thou shalt take,\ntoo, with thee the lute that I gave thee yesterday, and from which thou\nknowest so well to awaken the charming spirit.  Thou shalt give her,\nalso, this letter, in which, after a hundred efforts, I have embodied\nsomething of my thoughts. Let thy ear catch every accent, every\nmodulation of her voice, and tell me, when we meet again, if its music\nshould flatter me or discourage.  It is now, Nydia, some days since I\nhave been admitted to Ione; there is something mysterious in this\nexclusion.  I am distracted with doubts and fears; learn--for thou art\nquick, and thy care for me will sharpen tenfold thy acuteness--learn the\ncause of this unkindness; speak of me as often as thou canst; let my\nname come ever to thy lips: insinuate how I love rather than proclaim\nit; watch if she sighs whilst thou speakest, if she answer thee; or, if\nshe reproves, in what accents she reproves.  Be my friend, plead for me:\nand oh! how vastly wilt thou overpay the little I have done for thee!\nThou comprehendest, Nydia; thou art yet a child--have I said more than\nthou canst understand?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'And thou wilt serve me?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Come to me when thou hast gathered the flowers, and I will give thee\nthe vase I speak of; seek me in the chamber of Leda.  Pretty one, thou\ndost not grieve now?'\n\n'Glaucus, I am a slave; what business have I with grief or joy?'\n\n'Sayest thou so?  No, Nydia, be free.  I give thee freedom; enjoy it as\nthou wilt, and pardon me that I reckoned on thy desire to serve me.'\n\n'You are offended.  Oh! I would not, for that which no freedom can give,\noffend you, Glaucus.  My guardian, my saviour, my protector, forgive the\npoor blind girl!  She does not grieve even in leaving thee, if she can\ncontribute to thy happiness.'\n\n'May the gods bless this grateful heart!' said Glaucus, greatly moved;\nand, unconscious of the fires he excited, he repeatedly kissed her\nforehead.\n\n'Thou forgivest me,' said she, 'and thou wilt talk no more of freedom;\nmy happiness is to be thy slave: thou hast promised thou wilt not give\nme to another...'\n\n'I have promised.'\n\n'And now, then, I will gather the flowers.'\n\nSilently, Nydia took from the hand of Glaucus the costly and jewelled\nvase, in which the flowers vied with each other in hue and fragrance;\ntearlessly she received his parting admonition.  She paused for a moment\nwhen his voice ceased--she did not trust herself to reply--she sought\nhis hand--she raised it to her lips, dropped her veil over her face, and\npassed at once from his presence.  She paused again as she reached the\nthreshold; she stretched her hands towards it, and murmured:\n\n'Three happy days--days of unspeakable delight, have I known since I\npassed thee--blessed threshold! may peace dwell ever with thee when I am\ngone!  And now, my heart tears itself from thee, and the only sound it\nutters bids me--die!'\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nTHE HAPPY BEAUTY AND THE BLIND SLAVE.\n\nA SLAVE entered the chamber of Ione.  A messenger from Glaucus desired\nto be admitted.\n\nIone hesitated an instant.\n\n'She is blind, that messenger,' said the slave; 'she will do her\ncommission to none but thee.'\n\nBase is that heart which does not respect affliction!  The moment she\nheard the messenger was blind, Ione felt the impossibility of returning\na chilling reply.  Glaucus had chosen a herald that was indeed sacred--a\nherald that could not be denied.\n\n'What can he want with me? what message can he send?' and the heart of\nIone beat quick.  The curtain across the door was withdrawn; a soft and\necholess step fell upon the marble; and Nydia, led by one of the\nattendants, entered with her precious gift.\n\nShe stood still a moment, as if listening for some sound that might\ndirect her.\n\n'Will the noble Ione,' said she, in a soft and low voice, 'deign to\nspeak, that I may know whither to steer these benighted steps, and that\nI may lay my offerings at her feet?'\n\n'Fair child,' said Ione, touched and soothingly, 'give not thyself the\npain to cross these slippery floors, my attendant will bring to me what\nthou hast to present'; and she motioned to the handmaid to take the\nvase.\n\n'I may give these flowers to none but thee,' answered Nydia; and, guided\nby her ear, she walked slowly to the place where Ione sat, and kneeling\nwhen she came before her, proffered the vase.\n\nIone took it from her hand, and placed it on the table at her side.  She\nthen raised her gently, and would have seated her on the couch, but the\ngirl modestly resisted.\n\n'I have not yet discharged my office,' said she; and she drew the letter\nof Glaucus from her vest.  'This will, perhaps, explain why he who sent\nme chose so unworthy a messenger to Ione.'\n\nThe Neapolitan took the letter with a hand, the trembling of which Nydia\nat once felt and sighed to feel.  With folded arms, and downcast looks,\nshe stood before the proud and stately form of Ione--no less proud,\nperhaps, in her attitude of submission.  Ione waved her hand, and the\nattendants withdrew; she gazed again upon the form of the young slave in\nsurprise and beautiful compassion; then, retiring a little from her, she\nopened and read the following letter:\n\n'Glaucus to Ione sends more than he dares to utter.  Is Ione ill? thy\nslaves tell me \"No\", and that assurance comforts me.  Has Glaucus\noffended Ione?--ah! that question I may not ask from them.  For five\ndays I have been banished from thy presence.  Has the sun shone?--I know\nit not.  Has the sky smiled?--it has had no smile for me.  My sun and my\nsky are Ione.  Do I offend thee?  Am I too bold?  Do I say that on the\ntablet which my tongue has hesitated to breathe?  Alas! it is in thine\nabsence that I feel most the spells by which thou hast subdued me.  And\nabsence, that deprives me of joy, brings me courage.  Thou wilt not see\nme; thou hast banished also the common flatterers that flock around\nthee.  Canst thou confound me with them?  It is not possible! Thou\nknowest too well that I am not of them--that their clay is not mine. For\neven were I of the humblest mould, the fragrance of the rose has\npenetrated me, and the spirit of thy nature hath passed within me, to\nembalm, to sanctify, to inspire.  Have they slandered me to thee, Ione?\nThou wilt not believe them.  Did the Delphic oracle itself tell me thou\nwert unworthy, I would not believe it; and am I less incredulous than\nthou I think of the last time we met--of the song which I sang to\nthee--of the look that thou gavest me in return. Disguise it as thou wilt,\nIone, there is something kindred between us, and our eyes acknowledged\nit, though our lips were silent.  Deign to see me, to listen to me, and\nafter that exclude me if thou wilt.  I meant not so soon to say I loved.\nBut those words rush to my heart--they will have way.  Accept, then, my\nhomage and my vows.  We met first at the shrine of Pallas; shall we not\nmeet before a softer and a more ancient altar?\n\n'Beautiful! adored Ione!  If my hot youth and my Athenian blood have\nmisguided and allured me, they have but taught my wanderings to\nappreciate the rest--the haven they have attained.  I hang up my\ndripping robes on the Sea-god's shrine.  I have escaped shipwreck.  I\nhave found THEE.  Ione, deign to see me; thou art gentle to strangers,\nwilt thou be less merciful to those of thine own land?  I await thy\nreply.  Accept the flowers which I send--their sweet breath has a\nlanguage more eloquent than words.  They take from the sun the odorous\nthey return--they are the emblem of the love that receives and repays\ntenfold--the emblem of the heart that drunk thy rays, and owes to thee\nthe germ of the treasures that it proffers to thy smile.  I send these\nby one whom thou wilt receive for her own sake, if not for mine. She,\nlike us, is a stranger; her fathers' ashes lie under brighter skies:\nbut, less happy than we, she is blind and a slave.  Poor Nydia!  I seek\nas much as possible to repair to her the cruelties of Nature and of\nFate, in asking permission to place her with thee.  She is gentle,\nquick, and docile. She is skilled in music and the song; and she is a\nvery Chloris to the flowers.  She thinks, Ione, that thou wilt love her:\nif thou dost not, send her back to me.\n\n'One word more--let me be bold, Ione.  Why thinkest thou so highly of\nyon dark Egyptian? he hath not about him the air of honest men.  We\nGreeks learn mankind from our cradle; we are not the less profound, in\nthat we affect no sombre mien; our lips smile, but our eyes are\ngrave--they observe--they note--they study.  Arbaces is not one to be\ncredulously trusted: can it be that he hath wronged me to thee?  I think\nit, for I left him with thee; thou sawest how my presence stung him;\nsince then thou hast not admitted me. Believe nothing that he can say to\nmy disfavor; if thou dost, tell me so at once; for this Ione owes to\nGlaucus.  Farewell! this letter touches thy hand; these characters meet\nthine eyes--shall they be more blessed than he who is their author. Once\nmore, farewell!'\n\nIt seemed to Ione, as she read this letter, as if a mist had fallen from\nher eyes.  What had been the supposed offence of Glaucus?--that he had\nnot really loved!  And now, plainly, and in no dubious terms, he\nconfessed that love.  From that moment his power was fully restored.  At\nevery tender word in that letter, so full of romantic and trustful\npassion, her heart smote her.  And had she doubted his faith, and had\nshe believed another? and had she not, at least, allowed to him the\nculprit's right to know his crime, to plead in his defence?--the tears\nrolled down her cheeks--she kissed the letter--she placed it in her\nbosom: and, turning to Nydia, who stood in the same place and in the\nsame posture:\n\n'Wilt thou sit, my child,' said she, 'while I write an answer to this\nletter?'\n\n'You will answer it, then!' said Nydia, coldly.  'Well, the slave that\naccompanied me will take back your answer.'\n\n'For you,' said Ione, 'stay with me--trust me, your service shall be\nlight.'\n\nNydia bowed her head.\n\n'What is your name, fair girl?'\n\n'They call me Nydia.'\n\n'Your country?'\n\n'The land of Olympus--Thessaly.'\n\n'Thou shalt be to me a friend,' said Ione, caressingly, 'as thou art\nalready half a countrywoman.  Meanwhile, I beseech thee, stand not on\nthese cold and glassy marbles.  There! now that thou art seated, I can\nleave thee for an instant.'\n\n'Ione to Glaucus greeting.  Come to me, Glaucus,' wrote Ione, 'come to\nme to-morrow.  I may have been unjust to thee; but I will tell thee, at\nleast, the fault that has been imputed to thy charge.  Fear not,\nhenceforth, the Egyptian--fear none.  Thou sayest thou hast expressed\ntoo much--alas! in these hasty words I have already done so. Farewell.'\n\nAs Ione reappeared with the letter, which she did not dare to read after\nshe had written (Ah! common rashness, common timidity of love!)--Nydia\nstarted from her seat.\n\n'You have written to Glaucus?'\n\n'I have.'\n\n'And will he thank the messenger who gives to him thy letter?'\n\nIone forgot that her companion was blind; she blushed from the brow to\nthe neck, and remained silent.\n\n'I mean this,' added Nydia, in a calmer tone; 'the lightest word of\ncoldness from thee will sadden him--the lightest kindness will rejoice.\nIf it be the first, let the slave take back thine answer; if it be the\nlast, let me--I will return this evening.'\n\n'And why, Nydia,' asked Ione, evasively, 'Wouldst thou be the bearer of\nmy letter?'\n\n'It is so, then!' said Nydia.  'Ah! how could it be otherwise; who could\nbe unkind to Glaucus?'\n\n'My child,' said Ione, a little more reservedly than before, 'thou\nspeakest warmly--Glaucus, then, is amiable in thine eyes?'\n\n'Noble Ione! Glaucus has been that to me which neither fortune nor the\ngods have been--a friend!'\n\nThe sadness mingled with dignity with which Nydia uttered these simple\nwords, affected the beautiful Ione: she bent down and kissed her.  'Thou\nart grateful, and deservedly so; why should I blush to say that Glaucus\nis worthy of thy gratitude?  Go, my Nydia--take to him thyself this\nletter--but return again.  If I am from home when thou returnest--as\nthis evening, perhaps, I shall be--thy chamber shall be prepared next my\nown.  Nydia, I have no sister--wilt thou be one to me?' The Thessalian\nkissed the hand of Ione, and then said, with some embarrassment:\n\n'One favor, fair Ione--may I dare to ask it?'\n\n'Thou canst not ask what I will not grant,' replied the Neapolitan.\n\n'They tell me,' said Nydia, 'that thou art beautiful beyond the\nloveliness of earth.  Alas! I cannot see that which gladdens the world!\nWilt thou suffer me, then, to pass my hand over thy face?--that is my\nsole criterion of beauty, and I usually guess aright.'\n\nShe did not wait for the answer of Ione, but, as she spoke, gently and\nslowly passed her hand over the bending and half-averted features of the\nGreek--features which but one image in the world can yet depicture and\nrecall--that image is the mutilated, but all-wondrous, statue in her\nnative city--her own Neapolis--that Parian face, before which all the\nbeauty of the Florentine Venus is poor and earthly--that aspect so full\nof harmony--of youth--of genius--of the soul--which modern critics have\nsupposed the representation of Psyche.\n\nHer touch lingered over the braided hair and polished brow--over the\ndowny and damask cheek--over the dimpled lip--the swan-like and whitish\nneck.  'I know now, that thou art beautiful,' she said: 'and I can\npicture thee to my darkness henceforth, and for ever!'\n\nWhen Nydia left her, Ione sank into a deep but delicious reverie.\nGlaucus then loved her; he owned it--yes, he loved her.  She drew forth\nagain that dear confession; she paused over every word, she kissed every\nline; she did not ask why he had been maligned, she only felt assured\nthat he had been so. She wondered how she had ever believed a syllable\nagainst him; she wondered how the Egyptian had been enabled to exercise\na power against Glaucus; she felt a chill creep over her as she again\nturned to his warning against Arbaces, and her secret fear of that\ngloomy being darkened into awe.  She was awakened from these thoughts by\nher maidens, who came to announce to her that the hour appointed to\nvisit Arbaces was arrived; she started, she had forgotten the promise.\nHer first impression was to renounce it; her second, was to laugh at her\nown fears of her eldest surviving friend.  She hastened to add the usual\nornaments to her dress, and doubtful whether she should yet question the\nEgyptian more closely with respect to his accusation of Glaucus, or\nwhether she should wait till, without citing the authority, she should\ninsinuate to Glaucus the accusation itself, she took her way to the\ngloomy mansion of Arbaces.\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nIONE ENTRAPPED.  THE MOUSE TRIES TO GNAW THE NET.\n\n'DEAREST Nydia!' exclaimed Glaucus as he read the letter of Ione,\n'whitest robed messenger that ever passed between earth and heaven--how,\nhow shall I thank thee?'\n\n'I am rewarded,' said the poor Thessalian.\n\n'To-morrow--to-morrow! how shall I while the hours till then?'\n\nThe enamoured Greek would not let Nydia escape him, though she sought\nseveral times to leave the chamber; he made her recite to him over and\nover again every syllable of the brief conversation that had taken place\nbetween her and Ione; a thousand times, forgetting her misfortune, he\nquestioned her of the looks, of the countenance of his beloved; and then\nquickly again excusing his fault, he bade her recommence the whole\nrecital which he had thus interrupted.  The hours thus painful to Nydia\npassed rapidly and delightfully to him, and the twilight had already\ndarkened ere he once more dismissed her to Ione with a fresh letter and\nwith new flowers.  Scarcely had she gone, than Clodius and several of\nhis gay companions broke in upon him; they rallied him on his seclusion\nduring the whole day, and absence from his customary haunts; they\ninvited him to accompany them to the various resorts in that lively\ncity, which night and day proffered diversity to pleasure.  Then, as\nnow, in the south (for no land, perhaps, losing more of greatness has\nretained more of custom), it was the delight of the Italians to assemble\nat the evening; and, under the porticoes of temples or the shade of the\ngroves that interspersed the streets, listening to music or the recitals\nof some inventive tale-teller, they hailed the rising moon with\nlibations of wine and the melodies of song.  Glaucus was too happy to be\nunsocial; he longed to cast off the exuberance of joy that oppressed\nhim. He willingly accepted the proposal of his comrades, and laughingly\nthey sallied out together down the populous and glittering streets.\n\nIn the meantime Nydia once more gained the house of Ione, who had long\nleft it; she inquired indifferently whither Ione had gone.\n\nThe answer arrested and appalled her.\n\n'To the house of Arbaces--of the Egyptian?  Impossible!'\n\n'It is true, my little one,' said the slave, who had replied to her\nquestion.  'She has known the Egyptian long.'\n\n'Long! ye gods, yet Glaucus loves her?' murmured Nydia to herself.\n\n'And has,' asked she aloud, 'has she often visited him before?'\n\n'Never till now,' answered the slave.  'If all the rumored scandal of\nPompeii be true, it would be better, perhaps, if she had not ventured\nthere at present.  But she, poor mistress mine, hears nothing of that\nwhich reaches us; the talk of the vestibulum reaches not to the\nperistyle.'\n\n'Never till now!' repeated Nydia.  'Art thou sure?'\n\n'Sure, pretty one: but what is that to thee or to us?'\n\nNydia hesitated a moment, and then, putting down the flowers with which\nshe had been charged, she called to the slave who had accompanied her,\nand left the house without saying another word.\n\nNot till she had got half-way back to the house of Glaucus did she break\nsilence, and even then she only murmured inly:\n\n'She does not dream--she cannot--of the dangers into which she has\nplunged. Fool that I am--shall I save her?--yes, for I love Glaucus\nbetter than myself.'\n\nWhen she arrived at the house of the Athenian, she learnt that he had\ngone out with a party of his friends, and none knew whither.  He\nprobably would not be home before midnight.\n\nThe Thessalian groaned; she sank upon a seat in the hall and covered her\nface with her hands as if to collect her thoughts. 'There is no time to\nbe lost,' thought she, starting up.  She turned to the slave who had\naccompanied her.\n\n'Knowest thou,' said she, 'if Ione has any relative, any intimate friend\nat Pompeii?'\n\n'Why, by Jupiter!' answered the slave, 'art thou silly enough to ask the\nquestion?  Every one in Pompeii knows that Ione has a brother who, young\nand rich, has been--under the rose I speak--so foolish as to become a\npriest of Isis.'\n\n'A priest of Isis!  O Gods!  his name?'\n\n'Apaecides.'\n\n'I know it all,' muttered Nydia: 'brother and sister, then, are to be\nboth victims! Apaecides! yes, that was the name I heard in...  Ha! he\nwell, then, knows the peril that surrounds his sister; I will go to\nhim.'\n\nShe sprang up at that thought, and taking the staff which always guided\nher steps, she hastened to the neighboring shrine of Isis. Till she had\nbeen under the guardianship of the kindly Greek, that staff had sufficed\nto conduct the poor blind girl from corner to corner of Pompeii.  Every\nstreet, every turning in the more frequented parts, was familiar to her;\nand as the inhabitants entertained a tender and half-superstitious\nveneration for those subject to her infirmity, the passengers had always\ngiven way to her timid steps.  Poor girl, she little dreamed that she\nshould, ere many days were passed, find her blindness her protection,\nand a guide far safer than the keenest eyes!\n\nBut since she had been under the roof of Glaucus, he had ordered a slave\nto accompany her always; and the poor devil thus appointed, who was\nsomewhat of the fattest, and who, after having twice performed the\njourney to Ione's house, now saw himself condemned to a third excursion\n(whither the gods only knew), hastened after her, deploring his fate,\nand solemnly assuring Castor and Pollux that he believed the blind girl\nhad the talaria of Mercury as well as the infirmity of Cupid.\n\nNydia, however, required but little of his assistance to find her way to\nthe popular temple of Isis: the space before it was now deserted, and\nshe won without obstacle to the sacred rail.\n\n'There is no one here,' said the fat slave.  'What dost thou want, or\nwhom Knowest thou not that the priests do not live in the temple?'\n\n'Call out,' said she, impatiently; 'night and day there is always one\nflamen, at least, watching in the shrine of Isis.'\n\nThe slave called--no one appeared.\n\n'Seest thou no one?'\n\n'No one.'\n\n'Thou mistakest; I hear a sigh: look again.'\n\nThe slave, wondering and grumbling, cast round his heavy eyes, and\nbefore one of the altars, whose remains still crowd the narrow space, he\nbeheld a form bending as in meditation.\n\n'I see a figure, said he; 'and by the white garments, it is a priest.'\n\n'O flamen of Isis!' cried Nydia; 'servant of the Most Ancient, hear me!'\n\n'Who calls?' said a low and melancholy voice.\n\n'One who has no common tidings to impart to a member of your body: I\ncome to declare and not to ask oracles.'\n\n'With whom wouldst thou confer?  This is no hour for thy conference;\ndepart, disturb me not; the night is sacred to the gods, the day to\nmen.'\n\n'Methinks I know thy voice? thou art he whom I seek; yet I have heard\nthee speak but once before.  Art thou not the priest Apaecides?'\n\n'I am that man,' replied the priest, emerging from the altar, and\napproaching the rail.\n\n'Thou art! the gods be praised!' Waving her hand to the slave, she bade\nhim withdraw to a distance; and he, who naturally imagined some\nsuperstition connected, perhaps, with the safety of Ione, could alone\nlead her to the temple, obeyed, and seated himself on the ground, at a\nlittle distance. 'Hush!' said she, speaking quick and low; 'art thou\nindeed Apaecides?'\n\n'If thou knowest me, canst thou not recall my features?'\n\n'I am blind,' answered Nydia; 'my eyes are in my ear, and that\nrecognizes thee: yet swear that thou art he.'\n\n'By the gods I swear it, by my right hand, and by the moon!'\n\n'Hush! speak low--bend near--give me thy hand; knowest thou Arbaces?\nHast thou laid flowers at the feet of the dead?  Ah! thy hand is\ncold--hark yet!--hast thou taken the awful vow?'\n\n'Who art thou, whence comest thou, pale maiden?' said Apaecides,\nfearfully: 'I know thee not; thine is not the breast on which this head\nhath lain; I have never seen thee before.'\n\n'But thou hast heard my voice: no matter, those recollections it should\nshame us both to recall.  Listen, thou hast a sister.'\n\n'Speak! speak! what of her?'\n\n'Thou knowest the banquets of the dead, stranger--it pleases thee,\nperhaps, to share them--would it please thee to have thy sister a\npartaker?  Would it please thee that Arbaces was her host?'\n\n'O gods, he dare not!  Girl, if thou mockest me, tremble!  I will tear\nthee limb from limb!'\n\n'I speak the truth; and while I speak, Ione is in the halls of\nArbaces--for the first time his guest.  Thou knowest if there be peril\nin that first time!  Farewell!  I have fulfilled my charge.'\n\n'Stay! stay!' cried the priest, passing his wan hand over his brow.  'If\nthis be true, what--what can be done to save her?  They may not admit\nme.  I know not all the mazes of that intricate mansion.  O Nemesis!\njustly am I punished!'\n\n'I will dismiss yon slave, be thou my guide and comrade; I will lead\nthee to the private door of the house: I will whisper to thee the word\nwhich admits. Take some weapon: it may be needful!'\n\n'Wait an instant,' said Apaecides, retiring into one of the cells that\nflank the temple, and reappearing in a few moments wrapped in a large\ncloak, which was then much worn by all classes, and which concealed his\nsacred dress. 'Now,' he said, grinding his teeth, 'if Arbaces hath dared\nto--but he dare not! he dare not!  Why should I suspect him?  Is he so\nbase a villain?  I will not think it--yet, sophist! dark bewilderer that\nhe is!  O gods protect--hush! are there gods?  Yes, there is one\ngoddess, at least, whose voice I can command; and that is--Vengeance!'\n\nMuttering these disconnected thoughts, Apaecides, followed by his silent\nand sightless companion, hastened through the most solitary paths to the\nhouse of the Egyptian.\n\nThe slave, abruptly dismissed by Nydia, shrugged his shoulders, muttered\nan adjuration, and, nothing loath, rolled off to his cubiculum.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nTHE SOLITUDE AND SOLILOQUY OF THE EGYPTIAN.  HIS CHARACTER ANALYSED.\n\nWE must go back a few hours in the progress of our story.  At the first\ngrey dawn of the day, which Glaucus had already marked with white, the\nEgyptian was seated, sleepless and alone, on the summit of the lofty and\npyramidal tower which flanked his house.  A tall parapet around it\nserved as a wall, and conspired, with the height of the edifice and the\ngloomy trees that girded the mansion, to defy the prying eyes of\ncuriosity or observation.  A table, on which lay a scroll, filled with\nmystic figures, was before him. On high, the stars waxed dim and faint,\nand the shades of night melted from the sterile mountain-tops; only\nabove Vesuvius there rested a deep and massy cloud, which for several\ndays past had gathered darker and more solid over its summit.  The\nstruggle of night and day was more visible over the broad ocean, which\nstretched calm, like a gigantic lake, bounded by the circling shores\nthat, covered with vines and foliage, and gleaming here and there with\nthe white walls of sleeping cities, sloped to the scarce rippling waves.\n\nIt was the hour above all others most sacred to the daring science of\nthe Egyptian--the science which would read our changeful destinies in\nthe stars.\n\nHe had filled his scroll, he had noted the moment and the sign; and,\nleaning upon his hand, he had surrendered himself to the thoughts which\nhis calculation excited.\n\n'Again do the stars forewarn me!  Some danger, then, assuredly awaits\nme!' said he, slowly; 'some danger, violent and sudden in its nature.\nThe stars wear for me the same mocking menace which, if our chronicles\ndo not err, they once wore for Pyrrhus--for him, doomed to strive for\nall things, to enjoy none--all attacking, nothing gaining--battles\nwithout fruit, laurels without triumph, fame without success; at last\nmade craven by his own superstitions, and slain like a dog by a tile\nfrom the hand of an old woman! Verily, the stars flatter when they give\nme a type in this fool of war--when they promise to the ardour of my\nwisdom the same results as to the madness of his ambition--perpetual\nexercise--no certain goal!--the Sisyphus task, the mountain and the\nstone!--the stone, a gloomy image!--it reminds me that I am threatened\nwith somewhat of the same death as the Epirote.  Let me look again.\n\"Beware,\" say the shining prophets, \"how thou passest under ancient\nroofs, or besieged walls, or overhanging cliffs--a stone hurled from\nabove, is charged by the curses of destiny against thee!\" And, at no\ndistant date from this, comes the peril: but I cannot, of a certainty,\nread the day and hour.  Well! if my glass runs low, the sands shall\nsparkle to the last. Yet, if I escape this peril--ay, if I\nescape--bright and clear as the moonlight track along the waters glows\nthe rest of my existence.  I see honors, happiness, success, shining\nupon every billow of the dark gulf beneath which I must sink at last.\nWhat, then, with such destinies beyond the peril, shall I succumb to the\nperil?  My soul whispers hope, it sweeps exultingly beyond the boding\nhour, it revels in the future--its own courage is its fittest omen.  If\nI were to perish so suddenly and so soon, the shadow of death would\ndarken over me, and I should feel the icy presentiment of my doom.  My\nsoul would express, in sadness and in gloom, its forecast of the dreary\nOrcus.  But it smiles--it assures me of deliverance.'\n\nAs he thus concluded his soliloquy, the Egyptian involuntarily rose.  He\npaced rapidly the narrow space of that star-roofed floor, and, pausing\nat the parapet, looked again upon the grey and melancholy heavens.  The\nchills of the faint dawn came refreshingly upon his brow, and gradually\nhis mind resumed its natural and collected calm.  He withdrew his gaze\nfrom the stars, as, one after one, they receded into the depths of\nheaven; and his eyes fell over the broad expanse below.  Dim in the\nsilenced port of the city rose the masts of the galleys; along that mart\nof luxury and of labor was stilled the mighty hum.  No lights, save here\nand there from before the columns of a temple, or in the porticoes of\nthe voiceless forum, broke the wan and fluctuating light of the\nstruggling morn.  From the heart of the torpid city, so soon to vibrate\nwith a thousand passions, there came no sound: the streams of life\ncirculated not; they lay locked under the ice of sleep.  From the huge\nspace of the amphitheatre, with its stony seats rising one above the\nother--coiled and round as some slumbering monster--rose a thin and\nghastly mist, which gathered darker, and more dark, over the scattered\nfoliage that gloomed in its vicinity.  The city seemed as, after the\nawful change of seventeen ages, it seems now to the traveler,--a City of\nthe Dead.\n\nThe ocean itself--that serene and tideless sea--lay scarce less hushed,\nsave that from its deep bosom came, softened by the distance, a faint\nand regular murmur, like the breathing of its sleep; and curving far, as\nwith outstretched arms, into the green and beautiful land, it seemed\nunconsciously to clasp to its breast the cities sloping to its\nmargin--Stabiae, and Herculaneum, and Pompeii--those children and\ndarlings of the deep.  'Ye slumber,' said the Egyptian, as he scowled\nover the cities, the boast and flower of Campania; 'ye slumber!--would\nit were the eternal repose of death! As ye now--jewels in the crown of\nempire--so once were the cities of the Nile!  Their greatness hath\nperished from them, they sleep amidst ruins, their palaces and their\nshrines are tombs, the serpent coils in the grass of their streets, the\nlizard basks in their solitary halls.  By that mysterious law of Nature,\nwhich humbles one to exalt the other, ye have thriven upon their ruins;\nthou, haughty Rome, hast usurped the glories of Sesostris and\nSemiramis--thou art a robber, clothing thyself with their spoils!  And\nthese--slaves in thy triumph--that I (the last son of forgotten\nmonarchs) survey below, reservoirs of thine all-pervading power and\nluxury, I curse as I behold! The time shall come when Egypt shall be\navenged! when the barbarian's steed shall make his manger in the Golden\nHouse of Nero! and thou that hast sown the wind with conquest shalt reap\nthe harvest in the whirlwind of desolation!'\n\nAs the Egyptian uttered a prediction which fate so fearfully fulfilled,\na more solemn and boding image of ill omen never occurred to the dreams\nof painter or of poet.  The morning light, which can pale so wanly even\nthe young cheek of beauty, gave his majestic and stately features almost\nthe colors of the grave, with the dark hair falling massively around\nthem, and the dark robes flowing long and loose, and the arm\noutstretched from that lofty eminence, and the glittering eyes, fierce\nwith a savage gladness--half prophet and half fiend!\n\nHe turned his gaze from the city and the ocean; before him lay the\nvineyards and meadows of the rich Campania.  The gate and walls--ancient,\nhalf Pelasgic--of the city, seemed not to bound its extent. Villas and\nvillages stretched on every side up the ascent of Vesuvius, not nearly\nthen so steep or so lofty as at present.  For, as Rome itself is built\non an exhausted volcano, so in similar security the inhabitants of the\nSouth tenanted the green and vine-clad places around a volcano whose\nfires they believed at rest for ever.  From the gate stretched the long\nstreet of tombs, various in size and architecture, by which, on that\nside, the city is as yet approached. Above all, rode the cloud-capped\nsummit of the Dread Mountain, with the shadows, now dark, now light,\nbetraying the mossy caverns and ashy rocks, which testified the past\nconflagrations, and might have prophesied--but man is blind--that which\nwas to come!\n\nDifficult was it then and there to guess the causes why the tradition of\nthe place wore so gloomy and stern a hue; why, in those smiling plains,\nfor miles around--to Baiae and Misenum--the poets had imagined the\nentrance and thresholds of their hell--their Acheron, and their fabled\nStyx: why, in those Phlegrae, now laughing with the vine, they placed\nthe battles of the gods, and supposed the daring Titans to have sought\nthe victory of heaven--save, indeed, that yet, in yon seared and blasted\nsummit, fancy might think to read the characters of the Olympian\nthunderbolt.\n\nBut it was neither the rugged height of the still volcano, nor the\nfertility of the sloping fields, nor the melancholy avenue of tombs, nor\nthe glittering villas of a polished and luxurious people, that now\narrested the eye of the Egyptian.  On one part of the landscape, the\nmountain of Vesuvius descended to the plain in a narrow and uncultivated\nridge, broken here and there by jagged crags and copses of wild foliage.\nAt the base of this lay a marshy and unwholesome pool; and the intent\ngaze of Arbaces caught the outline of some living form moving by the\nmarshes, and stooping ever and anon as if to pluck its rank produce.\n\n'Ho!' said he, aloud, 'I have then, another companion in these unworldly\nnight-watches.  The witch of Vesuvius is abroad.  What! doth she, too,\nas the credulous imagine--doth she, too, learn the lore of the great\nstars? Hath she been uttering foul magic to the moon, or culling (as her\npauses betoken) foul herbs from the venomous marsh? Well, I must see\nthis fellow-laborer.  Whoever strives to know learns that no human lore\nis despicable.  Despicable only you--ye fat and bloated things--slaves\nof luxury--sluggards in thought--who, cultivating nothing but the barren\nsense, dream that its poor soil can produce alike the myrtle and the\nlaurel.  No, the wise only can enjoy--to us only true luxury is given,\nwhen mind, brain, invention, experience, thought, learning, imagination,\nall contribute like rivers to swell the seas of SENSE!--Ione!'\n\nAs Arbaces uttered that last and charmed word, his thoughts sunk at once\ninto a more deep and profound channel.  His steps paused; he took not\nhis eyes from the ground; once or twice he smiled joyously, and then, as\nhe turned from his place of vigil, and sought his couch, he muttered,\n'If death frowns so near, I will say at least that I have lived--Ione\nshall be mine!'\n\nThe character of Arbaces was one of those intricate and varied webs, in\nwhich even the mind that sat within it was sometimes confused and\nperplexed. In him, the son of a fallen dynasty, the outcast of a sunken\npeople, was that spirit of discontented pride, which ever rankles in one\nof a sterner mould, who feels himself inexorably shut from the sphere in\nwhich his fathers shone, and to which Nature as well as birth no less\nentitles himself.  This sentiment hath no benevolence; it wars with\nsociety, it sees enemies in mankind.  But with this sentiment did not go\nits common companion, poverty. Arbaces possessed wealth which equalled\nthat of most of the Roman nobles; and this enabled him to gratify to the\nutmost the passions which had no outlet in business or ambition.\nTravelling from clime to clime, and beholding still Rome everywhere, he\nincreased both his hatred of society and his passion for pleasure.  He\nwas in a vast prison, which, however, he could fill with the ministers\nof luxury.  He could not escape from the prison, and his only object,\ntherefore, was to give it the character of the palace.  The Egyptians,\nfrom the earliest time, were devoted to the joys of sense; Arbaces\ninherited both their appetite for sensuality and the glow of imagination\nwhich struck light from its rottenness.  But still, unsocial in his\npleasures as in his graver pursuits, and brooking neither superior nor\nequal, he admitted few to his companionship, save the willing slaves of\nhis profligacy.  He was the solitary lord of a crowded harem; but, with\nall, he felt condemned to that satiety which is the constant curse of\nmen whose intellect is above their pursuits, and that which once had\nbeen the impulse of passion froze down to the ordinance of custom.\nFrom the disappointments of sense he sought to raise himself by the\ncultivation of knowledge; but as it was not his object to serve mankind,\nso he despised that knowledge which is practical and useful.  His dark\nimagination loved to exercise itself in those more visionary and obscure\nresearches which are ever the most delightful to a wayward and solitary\nmind, and to which he himself was invited by the daring pride of his\ndisposition and the mysterious traditions of his clime. Dismissing faith\nin the confused creeds of the heathen world, he reposed the greatest\nfaith in the power of human wisdom. He did not know (perhaps no one in\nthat age distinctly did) the limits which Nature imposes upon our\ndiscoveries.  Seeing that the higher we mount in knowledge the more\nwonders we behold, he imagined that Nature not only worked miracles in\nher ordinary course, but that she might, by the cabala of some master\nsoul, be diverted from that course itself.  Thus he pursued science,\nacross her appointed boundaries, into the land of perplexity and shadow.\nFrom the truths of astronomy he wandered into astrological fallacy; from\nthe secrets of chemistry he passed into the spectral labyrinth of magic;\nand he who could be sceptical as to the power of the gods, was\ncredulously superstitious as to the power of man.\n\nThe cultivation of magic, carried at that day to a singular height among\nthe would-be wise, was especially Eastern in its origin; it was alien to\nthe early philosophy of the Greeks; nor had it been received by them\nwith favor until Ostanes, who accompanied the army of Xerxes,\nintroduced, amongst the simple credulities of Hellas, the solemn\nsuperstitions of Zoroaster.  Under the Roman emperors it had become,\nhowever, naturalized at Rome (a meet subject for Juvenal's fiery wit).\nIntimately connected with magic was the worship of Isis, and the\nEgyptian religion was the means by which was extended the devotion to\nEgyptian sorcery.  The theurgic, or benevolent magic--the goetic, or\ndark and evil necromancy--were alike in pre-eminent repute during the\nfirst century of the Christian era; and the marvels of Faustus are not\ncomparable to those of Apollonius.  Kings, courtiers, and sages, all\ntrembled before the professors of the dread science.  And not the least\nremarkable of his tribe was the most formidable and profound Arbaces.\nHis fame and his discoveries were known to all the cultivators of magic;\nthey even survived himself.  But it was not by his real name that he was\nhonored by the sorcerer and the sage: his real name, indeed, was unknown\nin Italy, for 'Arbaces' was not a genuinely Egyptian but a Median\nappellation, which, in the admixture and unsettlement of the ancient\nraces, had become common in the country of the Nile; and there were\nvarious reasons, not only of pride, but of policy (for in youth he had\nconspired against the majesty of Rome), which induced him to conceal his\ntrue name and rank.  But neither by the name he had borrowed from the\nMede, nor by that which in the colleges of Egypt would have attested his\norigin from kings, did the cultivators of magic acknowledge the potent\nmaster.  He received from their homage a more mystic appellation, and\nwas long remembered in Magna Graecia and the Eastern plain by the name\nof 'Hermes, the Lord of the Flaming Belt'. His subtle speculations and\nboasted attributes of wisdom, recorded in various volumes, were among\nthose tokens 'of the curious arts' which the Christian converts most\njoyfully, yet most fearfully, burnt at Ephesus, depriving posterity of\nthe proofs of the cunning of the fiend.\n\nThe conscience of Arbaces was solely of the intellect--it was awed by no\nmoral laws.  If man imposed these checks upon the herd, so he believed\nthat man, by superior wisdom, could raise himself above them. 'If (he\nreasoned) I have the genius to impose laws, have I not the right to\ncommand my own creations?  Still more, have I not the right to\ncontrol--to evade--to scorn--the fabrications of yet meaner intellects\nthan my own?' Thus, if he were a villain, he justified his villainy by\nwhat ought to have made him virtuous--namely, the elevation of his\ncapacities.\n\nMost men have more or less the passion for power; in Arbaces that\npassion corresponded exactly to his character.  It was not the passion\nfor an external and brute authority.  He desired not the purple and the\nfasces, the insignia of vulgar command.  His youthful ambition once\nfoiled and defeated, scorn had supplied its place--his pride, his\ncontempt for Rome--Rome, which had become the synonym of the world\n(Rome, whose haughty name he regarded with the same disdain as that\nwhich Rome herself lavished upon the barbarian), did not permit him to\naspire to sway over others, for that would render him at once the tool\nor creature of the emperor.  He, the Son of the Great Race of\nRameses--he execute the orders of, and receive his power from,\nanother!--the mere notion filled him with rage.  But in rejecting an\nambition that coveted nominal distinctions, he but indulged the more in\nthe ambition to rule the heart.  Honoring mental power as the greatest\nof earthly gifts, he loved to feel that power palpably in himself, by\nextending it over all whom he encountered.  Thus had he ever sought the\nyoung--thus had he ever fascinated and controlled them.  He loved to\nfind subjects in men's souls--to rule over an invisible and immaterial\nempire!--had he been less sensual and less wealthy, he might have sought\nto become the founder of a new religion. As it was, his energies were\nchecked by his pleasures. Besides, however, the vague love of this moral\nsway (vanity so dear to sages!) he was influenced by a singular and\ndreamlike devotion to all that belonged to the mystic Land his ancestors\nhad swayed. Although he disbelieved in her deities, he believed in the\nallegories they represented (or rather he interpreted those allegories\nanew).  He loved to keep alive the worship of Egypt, because he thus\nmaintained the shadow and the recollection of her power.  He loaded,\ntherefore, the altars of Osiris and of Isis with regal donations, and\nwas ever anxious to dignify their priesthood by new and wealthy\nconverts.  The vow taken--the priesthood embraced--he usually chose the\ncomrades of his pleasures from those whom he made his victims, partly\nbecause he thus secured to himself their secrecy--partly because he thus\nyet more confirmed to himself his peculiar power. Hence the motives of\nhis conduct to Apaecides, strengthened as these were, in that instance,\nby his passion for Ione.\n\nHe had seldom lived long in one place; but as he grew older, he grew\nmore wearied of the excitement of new scenes, and he had sojourned among\nthe delightful cities of Campania for a period which surprised even\nhimself.  In fact, his pride somewhat crippled his choice of residence.\nHis unsuccessful conspiracy excluded him from those burning climes which\nhe deemed of right his own hereditary possession, and which now cowered,\nsupine and sunken, under the wings of the Roman eagle.  Rome herself was\nhateful to his indignant soul; nor did he love to find his riches\nrivalled by the minions of the court, and cast into comparative poverty\nby the mighty magnificence of the court itself.  The Campanian cities\nproffered to him all that his nature craved--the luxuries of an\nunequalled climate--the imaginative refinements of a voluptuous\ncivilization.  He was removed from the sight of a superior wealth; he\nwas without rivals to his riches; he was free from the spies of a\njealous court.  As long as he was rich, none pried into his conduct.  He\npursued the dark tenour of his way undisturbed and secure.\n\nIt is the curse of sensualists never to love till the pleasures of sense\nbegin to pall; their ardent youth is frittered away in countless\ndesires--their hearts are exhausted.  So, ever chasing love, and taught\nby a restless imagination to exaggerate, perhaps, its charms, the\nEgyptian had spent all the glory of his years without attaining the\nobject of his desires.  The beauty of to-morrow succeeded the beauty of\nto-day, and the shadows bewildered him in his pursuit of the substance.\nWhen, two years before the present date, he beheld Ione, he saw, for the\nfirst time, one whom he imagined he could love.  He stood, then, upon\nthat bridge of life, from which man sees before him distinctly a wasted\nyouth on the one side, and the darkness of approaching age upon the\nother: a time in which we are more than ever anxious, perhaps, to secure\nto ourselves, ere it be yet too late, whatever we have been taught to\nconsider necessary to the enjoyment of a life of which the brighter half\nis gone.\n\nWith an earnestness and a patience which he had never before commanded\nfor his pleasures, Arbaces had devoted himself to win the heart of Ione.\nIt did not content him to love, he desired to be loved. In this hope he\nhad watched the expanding youth of the beautiful Neapolitan; and,\nknowing the influence that the mind possesses over those who are taught\nto cultivate the mind, he had contributed willingly to form the genius\nand enlighten the intellect of Ione, in the hope that she would be thus\nable to appreciate what he felt would be his best claim to her\naffection: viz, a character which, however criminal and perverted, was\nrich in its original elements of strength and grandeur.  When he felt\nthat character to be acknowledged, he willingly allowed, nay, encouraged\nher, to mix among the idle votaries of pleasure, in the belief that her\nsoul, fitted for higher commune, would miss the companionship of his\nown, and that, in comparison with others, she would learn to love\nherself.  He had forgot, that as the sunflower to the sun, so youth\nturns to youth, until his jealousy of Glaucus suddenly apprised him of\nhis error.  From that moment, though, as we have seen, he knew not the\nextent of his danger, a fiercer and more tumultuous direction was given\nto a passion long controlled.  Nothing kindles the fire of love like the\nsprinkling of the anxieties of jealousy; it takes then a wilder, a more\nresistless flame; it forgets its softness; it ceases to be tender; it\nassumes something of the intensity--of the ferocity--of hate.\n\nArbaces resolved to lose no further time upon cautious and perilous\npreparations: he resolved to place an irrevocable barrier between\nhimself and his rivals: he resolved to possess himself of the person of\nIone: not that in his present love, so long nursed and fed by hopes\npurer than those of passion alone, he would have been contented with\nthat mere possession. He desired the heart, the soul, no less than the\nbeauty, of Ione; but he imagined that once separated by a daring crime\nfrom the rest of mankind--once bound to Ione by a tie that memory could\nnot break, she would be driven to concentrate her thoughts in him--that\nhis arts would complete his conquest, and that, according to the true\nmoral of the Roman and the Sabine, the empire obtained by force would be\ncemented by gentler means. This resolution was yet more confirmed in him\nby his belief in the prophecies of the stars: they had long foretold to\nhim this year, and even the present month, as the epoch of some dread\ndisaster, menacing life itself.  He was driven to a certain and limited\ndate. He resolved to crowd, monarch-like, on his funeral pyre all that\nhis soul held most dear.  In his own words, if he were to die, he\nresolved to feel that he had lived, and that Ione should be his own.\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nWHAT BECOMES OF IONE IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES. THE FIRST SIGNAL OF THE\nWRATH OF THE DREAD FOE.\n\nWHEN Ione entered the spacious hall of the Egyptian, the same awe which\nhad crept over her brother impressed itself also upon her: there seemed\nto her as to him something ominous and warning in the still and mournful\nfaces of those dread Theban monsters, whose majestic and passionless\nfeatures the marble so well portrayed:\n\n  Their look, with the reach of past ages, was wise,\n  And the soul of eternity thought in their eyes.\nThe tall AEthiopian slave grinned as he admitted her, and motioned to\nher to proceed.  Half-way up the hall she was met by Arbaces himself, in\nfestive robes, which glittered with jewels.  Although it was broad day\nwithout, the mansion, according to the practice of the luxurious, was\nartificially darkened, and the lamps cast their still and odor-giving\nlight over the rich floors and ivory roofs.\n\n'Beautiful Ione,' said Arbaces, as he bent to touch her hand, 'it is you\nthat have eclipsed the day--it is your eyes that light up the halls--it\nis your breath which fills them with perfumes.'\n\n'You must not talk to me thus,' said Ione, smiling, 'you forget that\nyour lore has sufficiently instructed my mind to render these graceful\nflatteries to my person unwelcome.  It was you who taught me to disdain\nadulation: will you unteach your pupil?'\n\nThere was something so frank and charming in the manner of Ione, as she\nthus spoke, that the Egyptian was more than ever enamoured, and more\nthan ever disposed to renew the offence he had committed; he, however,\nanswered quickly and gaily, and hastened to renew the conversation.\n\nHe led her through the various chambers of a house, which seemed to\ncontain to her eyes, inexperienced to other splendor than the minute\nelegance of Campanian cities, the treasures of the world.\n\nIn the walls were set pictures of inestimable art, the lights shone over\nstatues of the noblest age of Greece.  Cabinets of gems, each cabinet\nitself a gem, filled up the interstices of the columns; the most\nprecious woods lined the thresholds and composed the doors; gold and\njewels seemed lavished all around.  Sometimes they were alone in these\nrooms--sometimes they passed through silent rows of slaves, who,\nkneeling as she passed, proffered to her offerings of bracelets, of\nchains, of gems, which the Egyptian vainly entreated her to receive.\n\n'I have often heard,' said she, wonderingly, 'that you were rich; but I\nnever dreamed of the amount of your wealth.'\n\n'Would I could coin it all,' replied the Egyptian, 'into one crown,\nwhich I might place upon that snowy brow!'\n\n'Alas! the weight would crush me; I should be a second Tarpeia,'\nanswered Ione, laughingly.\n\n'But thou dost not disdain riches, O Ione! they know not what life is\ncapable of who are not wealthy.  Gold is the great magician of earth--it\nrealizes our dreams--it gives them the power of a god--there is a\ngrandeur, a sublimity, in its possession; it is the mightiest, yet the\nmost obedient of our slaves.'\n\nThe artful Arbaces sought to dazzle the young Neapolitan by his\ntreasures and his eloquence; he sought to awaken in her the desire to be\nmistress of what she surveyed: he hoped that she would confound the\nowner with the possessions, and that the charms of his wealth would be\nreflected on himself.  Meanwhile, Ione was secretly somewhat uneasy at\nthe gallantries which escaped from those lips, which, till lately, had\nseemed to disdain the common homage we pay to beauty; and with that\ndelicate subtlety, which woman alone possesses, she sought to ward off\nshafts deliberately aimed, and to laugh or to talk away the meaning from\nhis warming language.  Nothing in the world is more pretty than that\nsame species of defence; it is the charm of the African necromancer who\nprofessed with a feather to turn aside the winds.\n\nThe Egyptian was intoxicated and subdued by her grace even more than by\nher beauty: it was with difficulty that he suppressed his emotions;\nalas! the feather was only powerful against the summer breezes--it would\nbe the sport of the storm.\n\nSuddenly, as they stood in one hall, which was surrounded by draperies\nof silver and white, the Egyptian clapped his hands, and, as if by\nenchantment, a banquet rose from the floor--a couch or throne, with a\ncrimson canopy, ascended simultaneously at the feet of Ione--and at the\nsame instant from behind the curtains swelled the invisible and softest\nmusic.\n\nArbaces placed himself at the feet of Ione--and children, young and\nbeautiful as Loves, ministered to the feast.\n\nThe feast was over, the music sank into a low and subdued strain, and\nArbaces thus addressed his beautiful guest:\n\n'Hast thou never in this dark and uncertain world--hast thou never\naspired, my pupil, to look beyond--hast thou never wished to put aside\nthe veil of futurity, and to behold on the shores of Fate the shadowy\nimages of things to be?  For it is not the past alone that has its\nghosts: each event to come has also its spectrum--its shade; when the\nhour arrives, life enters it, the shadow becomes corporeal, and walks\nthe world.  Thus, in the land beyond the grave, are ever two impalpable\nand spiritual hosts--the things to be, the things that have been! If by\nour wisdom we can penetrate that land, we see the one as the other, and\nlearn, as I have learned, not alone the mysteries of the dead, but also\nthe destiny of the living.'\n\n'As thou hast learned!--Can wisdom attain so far?'\n\n'Wilt thou prove my knowledge, Ione, and behold the representation of\nthine own fate?  It is a drama more striking than those of AEschylus: it\nis one I have prepared for thee, if thou wilt see the shadows perform\ntheir part.'\n\nThe Neapolitan trembled; she thought of Glaucus, and sighed as well as\ntrembled: were their destinies to be united?  Half incredulous, half\nbelieving, half awed, half alarmed by the words of her strange host, she\nremained for some moments silent, and then answered:\n\n'It may revolt--it may terrify; the knowledge of the future will perhaps\nonly embitter the present!'\n\n'Not so, Ione.  I have myself looked upon thy future lot, and the ghosts\nof thy Future bask in the gardens of Elysium: amidst the asphodel and\nthe rose they prepare the garlands of thy sweet destiny, and the Fates,\nso harsh to others, weave only for thee the web of happiness and love.\nWilt thou then come and behold thy doom, so that thou mayest enjoy it\nbeforehand?'\n\nAgain the heart of Ione murmured 'Glaucus'; she uttered a half-audible\nassent; the Egyptian rose, and taking her by the hand, he led her across\nthe banquet-room--the curtains withdrew as by magic hands, and the music\nbroke forth in a louder and gladder strain; they passed a row of\ncolumns, on either side of which fountains cast aloft their fragrant\nwaters; they descended by broad and easy steps into a garden.  The eve\nhad commenced; the moon was already high in heaven, and those sweet\nflowers that sleep by day, and fill, with ineffable odorous, the airs of\nnight, were thickly scattered amidst alleys cut through the star-lit\nfoliage; or, gathered in baskets, lay like offerings at the feet of the\nfrequent statues that gleamed along their path.\n\n'Whither wouldst thou lead me, Arbaces?' said Ione, wonderingly.\n\n'But yonder,' said he, pointing to a small building which stood at the\nend of the vista.  'It is a temple consecrated to the Fates--our rites\nrequire such holy ground.'\n\nThey passed into a narrow hall, at the end of which hung a sable\ncurtain. Arbaces lifted it; Ione entered, and found herself in total\ndarkness.\n\n'Be not alarmed,' said the Egyptian, 'the light will rise instantly.'\nWhile he so spoke, a soft, and warm, and gradual light diffused itself\naround; as it spread over each object, Ione perceived that she was in an\napartment of moderate size, hung everywhere with black; a couch with\ndraperies of the same hue was beside her.  In the centre of the room was\na small altar, on which stood a tripod of bronze.  At one side, upon a\nlofty column of granite, was a colossal head of the blackest marble,\nwhich she perceived, by the crown of wheat-ears that encircled the brow,\nrepresented the great Egyptian goddess.  Arbaces stood before the altar:\nhe had laid his garland on the shrine, and seemed occupied with pouring\ninto the tripod the contents of a brazen vase; suddenly from that tripod\nleaped into life a blue, quick, darting, irregular flame; the Egyptian\ndrew back to the side of Ione, and muttered some words in a language\nunfamiliar to her ear; the curtain at the back of the altar waved\ntremulously to and fro--it parted slowly, and in the aperture which was\nthus made, Ione beheld an indistinct and pale landscape, which gradually\ngrew brighter and clearer as she gazed; at length she discovered plainly\ntrees, and rivers, and meadows, and all the beautiful diversity of the\nrichest earth.  At length, before the landscape, a dim shadow glided; it\nrested opposite to Ione; slowly the same charm seemed to operate upon it\nas over the rest of the scene; it took form and shape, and lo!--in its\nfeature and in its form Ione beheld herself!\n\nThen the scene behind the spectre faded away, and was succeeded by the\nrepresentation of a gorgeous palace; a throne was raised in the centre\nof its hall, the dim forms of slaves and guards were ranged around it,\nand a pale hand held over the throne the likeness of a diadem.\n\nA new actor now appeared; he was clothed from head to foot in a dark\nrobe--his face was concealed--he knelt at the feet of the shadowy\nIone--he clasped her hand--he pointed to the throne, as if to invite her\nto ascend it.\n\nThe Neapolitan's heart beat violently.  'Shall the shadow disclose\nitself?' whispered a voice beside her--the voice of Arbaces.\n\n'Ah, yes!' answered Ione, softly.\n\nArbaces raised his hand--the spectre seemed to drop the mantle that\nconcealed its form--and Ione shrieked--it was Arbaces himself that thus\nknelt before her.\n\n'This is, indeed, thy fate!' whispered again the Egyptian's voice in her\near.  'And thou art destined to be the bride of Arbaces.'\n\nIone started--the black curtain closed over the phantasmagoria: and\nArbaces himself--the real, the living Arbaces--was at her feet.\n\n'Oh, Ione!' said he, passionately gazing upon her, 'listen to one who\nhas long struggled vainly with his love.  I adore thee!  The Fates do\nnot lie--thou art destined to be mine--I have sought the world around,\nand found none like thee.  From my youth upward, I have sighed for such\nas thou art. I have dreamed till I saw thee--I wake, and I behold thee.\nTurn not away from me, Ione; think not of me as thou hast thought; I am\nnot that being--cold, insensate, and morose, which I have seemed to\nthee.  Never woman had lover so devoted--so passionate as I will be to\nIone.  Do not struggle in my clasp: see--I release thy hand.  Take it\nfrom me if thou wilt--well be it so!  But do not reject me, Ione--do not\nrashly reject--judge of thy power over him whom thou canst thus\ntransform.  I, who never knelt to mortal being, kneel to thee.  I, who\nhave commanded fate, receive from thee my own.  Ione, tremble not, thou\nart my queen--my goddess--be my bride!  All the wishes thou canst form\nshall be fulfilled. The ends of the earth shall minister to thee--pomp,\npower, luxury, shall be thy slaves.  Arbaces shall have no ambition,\nsave the pride of obeying thee. Ione, turn upon me those eyes--shed upon\nme thy smile. Dark is my soul when thy face is hid from it: shine over\nme, my sun--my heaven--my daylight!--Ione, Ione--do not reject my love!'\n\nAlone, and in the power of this singular and fearful man, Ione was not\nyet terrified; the respect of his language, the softness of his voice,\nreassured her; and, in her own purity, she felt protection.  But she was\nconfused--astonished: it was some moments before she could recover the\npower of reply.\n\n'Rise, Arbaces!' said she at length; and she resigned to him once more\nher hand, which she as quickly withdrew again, when she felt upon it the\nburning pressure of his lips.  'Rise! and if thou art serious, if thy\nlanguage be in earnest...'\n\n'If!' said he tenderly.\n\n'Well, then, listen to me: you have been my guardian, my friend, my\nmonitor; for this new character I was not prepared--think not,' she\nadded quickly, as she saw his dark eyes glitter with the fierceness of\nhis passion--'think not that I scorn--that I am untouched--that I am not\nhonored by this homage; but, say--canst thou hear me calmly?'\n\n'Ay, though thy words were lightning, and could blast me!'\n\n'I love another!' said Ione, blushingly, but in a firm voice.\n\n'By the gods--by hell!' shouted Arbaces, rising to his fullest height;\n'dare not tell me that--dare not mock me--it is impossible!--Whom hast\nthou seen--whom known?  Oh, Ione, it is thy woman's invention, thy\nwoman's art that speaks--thou wouldst gain time; I have surprised--I\nhave terrified thee.  Do with me as thou wilt--say that thou lovest not\nme; but say not that thou lovest another!'\n\n'Alas!' began Ione; and then, appalled before his sudden and\nunlooked-for violence, she burst into tears.\n\nArbaces came nearer to her--his breath glowed fiercely on her cheek; he\nwound his arms round her--she sprang from his embrace.  In the struggle\na tablet fell from her bosom on the ground: Arbaces perceived, and\nseized it--it was the letter that morning received from Glaucus.  Ione\nsank upon the couch, half dead with terror.\n\nRapidly the eyes of Arbaces ran over the writing; the Neapolitan did not\ndare to gaze upon him: she did not see the deadly paleness that came\nover his countenance--she marked not his withering frown, nor the\nquivering of his lip, nor the convulsions that heaved his breast.  He\nread it to the end, and then, as the letter fell from his hand, he said,\nin a voice of deceitful calmness:\n\n'Is the writer of this the man thou lovest?'\n\nIone sobbed, but answered not.\n\n'Speak!' he rather shrieked than said.\n\n'It is--it is!\n\n'And his name--it is written here--his name is Glaucus!'\n\nIone, clasping her hands, looked round as for succour or escape.\n\n'Then hear me,' said Arbaces, sinking his voice into a whisper; 'thou\nshalt go to thy tomb rather than to his arms!  What! thinkest thou\nArbaces will brook a rival such as this puny Greek?  What! thinkest thou\nthat he has watched the fruit ripen, to yield it to another!  Pretty\nfool--no!  Thou art mine--all--only mine: and thus--thus I seize and\nclaim thee!' As he spoke, he caught Ione in his arms; and, in that\nferocious grasp, was all the energy--less of love than of revenge.\n\nBut to Ione despair gave supernatural strength: she again tore herself\nfrom him--she rushed to that part of the room by which she had\nentered--she half withdrew the curtain--he had seized her--again she\nbroke away from him--and fell, exhausted, and with a loud shriek, at the\nbase of the column which supported the head of the Egyptian goddess.\nArbaces paused for a moment, as if to regain his breath; and thence once\nmore darted upon his prey.\n\nAt that instant the curtain was rudely torn aside, the Egyptian felt a\nfierce and strong grasp upon his shoulder.  He turned--he beheld before\nhim the flashing eyes of Glaucus, and the pale, worn, but menacing,\ncountenance of Apaecides.  'Ah,' he muttered, as he glared from one to\nthe other, 'what Fury hath sent ye hither?'\n\n'Ate,' answered Glaucus; and he closed at once with the Egyptian.\nMeanwhile, Apaecides raised his sister, now lifeless, from the ground;\nhis strength, exhausted by a mind long overwrought, did not suffice to\nbear her away, light and delicate though her shape: he placed her,\ntherefore, on the couch, and stood over her with a brandishing knife,\nwatching the contest between Glaucus and the Egyptian, and ready to\nplunge his weapon in the bosom of Arbaces should he be victorious in the\nstruggle.  There is, perhaps, nothing on earth so terrible as the naked\nand unarmed contest of animal strength, no weapon but those which Nature\nsupplies to rage.  Both the antagonists were now locked in each other's\ngrasp--the hand of each seeking the throat of the other--the face drawn\nback--the fierce eyes flashing--the muscles strained--the veins\nswelled--the lips apart--the teeth set--both were strong beyond the\nordinary power of men, both animated by relentless wrath; they coiled,\nthey wound, around each other; they rocked to and fro--they swayed from\nend to end of their confined arena--they uttered cries of ire and\nrevenge--they were now before the altar--now at the base of the column\nwhere the struggle had commenced: they drew back for breath--Arbaces\nleaning against the column--Glaucus a few paces apart.\n\n'O ancient goddess!' exclaimed Arbaces, clasping the column, and raising\nhis eyes toward the sacred image it supported, 'protect thy\nchosen--proclaim they vengeance against this thing of an upstart creed,\nwho with sacrilegious violence profanes thy resting-place and assails\nthy servant.'\n\nAs he spoke, the still and vast features of the goddess seemed suddenly\nto glow with life; through the black marble, as through a transparent\nveil, flushed luminously a crimson and burning hue; around the head\nplayed and darted coruscations of livid lightning; the eyes became like\nballs of lurid fire, and seemed fixed in withering and intolerable wrath\nupon the countenance of the Greek.  Awed and appalled by this sudden and\nmystic answer to the prayer of his foe, and not free from the hereditary\nsuperstitions of his race, the cheeks of Glaucus paled before that\nstrange and ghastly animation of the marble--his knees knocked\ntogether--he stood, seized with a divine panic, dismayed, aghast, half\nunmanned before his foe! Arbaces gave him not breathing time to recover\nhis stupor: 'Die, wretch!' he shouted, in a voice of thunder, as he\nsprang upon the Greek; 'the Mighty Mother claims thee as a living\nsacrifice!' Taken thus by surprise in the first consternation of his\nsuperstitious fears, the Greek lost his footing--the marble floor was as\nsmooth as glass--he slid--he fell. Arbaces planted his foot on the\nbreast of his fallen foe.  Apaecides, taught by his sacred profession,\nas well as by his knowledge of Arbaces, to distrust all miraculous\ninterpositions, had not shared the dismay of his companion; he rushed\nforward--his knife gleamed in the air--the watchful Egyptian caught his\narm as it descended--one wrench of his powerful hand tore the weapon\nfrom the weak grasp of the priest--one sweeping blow stretched him to\nthe earth--with a loud and exulting yell Arbaces brandished the knife on\nhigh. Glaucus gazed upon his impending fate with unwinking eyes, and in\nthe stern and scornful resignation of a fallen gladiator, when, at that\nawful instant, the floor shook under them with a rapid and convulsive\nthroe--a mightier spirit than that of the Egyptian was abroad!--a giant\nand crushing power, before which sunk into sudden impotence his passion\nand his arts. IT woke--it stirred--that Dread Demon of the\nEarthquake--laughing to scorn alike the magic of human guile and the\nmalice of human wrath.  As a Titan, on whom the mountains are piled, it\nroused itself from the sleep of years, it moved on its tortured\ncouch--the caverns below groaned and trembled beneath the motion of its\nlimbs. In the moment of his vengeance and his power, the self-prized\ndemigod was humbled to his real clay.  Far and wide along the soil went\na hoarse and rumbling sound--the curtains of the chamber shook as at the\nblast of a storm--the altar rocked--the tripod reeled, and high over the\nplace of contest, the column trembled and waved from side to side--the\nsable head of the goddess tottered and fell from its pedestal--and as\nthe Egyptian stooped above his intended victim, right upon his bended\nform, right between the shoulder and the neck, struck the marble mass!\nThe shock stretched him like the blow of death, at once, suddenly,\nwithout sound or motion, or semblance of life, upon the floor,\napparently crushed by the very divinity he had impiously animated and\ninvoked!\n\n'The Earth has preserved her children,' said Glaucus, staggering to his\nfeet.  'Blessed be the dread convulsion!  Let us worship the providence\nof the gods!' He assisted Apaecides to rise, and then turned upward the\nface of Arbaces; it seemed locked as in death; blood gushed from the\nEgyptian's lips over his glittering robes; he fell heavily from the arms\nof Glaucus, and the red stream trickled slowly along the marble.  Again\nthe earth shook beneath their feet; they were forced to cling to each\nother; the convulsion ceased as suddenly as it came; they tarried no\nlonger; Glaucus bore Ione lightly in his arms, and they fled from the\nunhallowed spot.  But scarce had they entered the garden than they were\nmet on all sides by flying and disordered groups of women and slaves,\nwhose festive and glittering garments contrasted in mockery the solemn\nterror of the hour; they did not appear to heed the strangers--they were\noccupied only with their own fears.  After the tranquillity of sixteen\nyears, that burning and treacherous soil again menaced destruction; they\nuttered but one cry, 'THE EARTHQUAKE!  THE EARTHQUAKE!' and passing\nunmolested from the midst of them, Apaecides and his companions, without\nentering the house, hastened down one of the alleys, passed a small open\ngate, and there, sitting on a little mound over which spread the gloom\nof the dark green aloes, the moonlight fell on the bended figure of the\nblind girl--she was weeping bitterly.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE THIRD\n\nChapter I\n\nTHE FORUM OF THE POMPEIANS.  THE FIRST RUDE MACHINERY BY WHICH THE NEW\nERA OF THE WORLD WAS WROUGHT.\n\nIT was early noon, and the forum was crowded alike with the busy and the\nidle.  As at Paris at this day, so at that time in the cities of Italy,\nmen lived almost wholly out of doors: the public buildings, the forum,\nthe porticoes, the baths, the temples themselves, might be considered\ntheir real homes; it was no wonder that they decorated so gorgeously\nthese favorite places of resort--they felt for them a sort of domestic\naffection as well as a public pride.  And animated was, indeed, the\naspect of the forum of Pompeii at that time!  Along its broad pavement,\ncomposed of large flags of marble, were assembled various groups,\nconversing in that energetic fashion which appropriates a gesture to\nevery word, and which is still the characteristic of the people of the\nsouth.  Here, in seven stalls on one side the colonnade, sat the\nmoney-changers, with their glittering heaps before them, and merchants\nand seamen in various costumes crowding round their stalls.  On one\nside, several men in long togas were seen bustling rapidly up to a\nstately edifice, where the magistrates administered justice--these were\nthe lawyers, active, chattering, joking, and punning, as you may find\nthem at this day in Westminster.  In the centre of the space, pedestals\nsupported various statues, of which the most remarkable was the stately\nform of Cicero.  Around the court ran a regular and symmetrical\ncolonnade of Doric architecture; and there several, whose business drew\nthem early to the place, were taking the slight morning repast which\nmade an Italian breakfast, talking vehemently on the earthquake of the\npreceding night as they dipped pieces of bread in their cups of diluted\nwine.  In the open space, too, you might perceive various petty traders\nexercising the arts of their calling.  Here one man was holding out\nribands to a fair dame from the country; another man was vaunting to a\nstout farmer the excellence of his shoes; a third, a kind of\nstall-restaurateur, still so common in the Italian cities, was supplying\nmany a hungry mouth with hot messes from his small and itinerant stove,\nwhile--contrast strongly typical of the mingled bustle and intellect of\nthe time--close by, a schoolmaster was expounding to his puzzled pupils\nthe elements of the Latin grammar. A gallery above the portico, which\nwas ascended by small wooden staircases, had also its throng; though, as\nhere the immediate business of the place was mainly carried on, its\ngroups wore a more quiet and serious air.\n\nEvery now and then the crowd below respectfully gave way as some senator\nswept along to the Temple of Jupiter (which filled up one side of the\nforum, and was the senators' hall of meeting), nodding with ostentatious\ncondescension to such of his friends or clients as he distinguished\namongst the throng.  Mingling amidst the gay dresses of the better\norders you saw the hardy forms of the neighboring farmers, as they made\ntheir way to the public granaries.  Hard by the temple you caught a view\nof the triumphal arch, and the long street beyond swarming with\ninhabitants; in one of the niches of the arch a fountain played,\ncheerily sparkling in the sunbeams; and above its cornice rose the\nbronzed and equestrian statue of Caligula, strongly contrasting the gay\nsummer skies.  Behind the stalls of the money-changers was that building\nnow called the Pantheon; and a crowd of the poorer Pompeians passed\nthrough the small vestibule which admitted to the interior, with\npanniers under their arms, pressing on towards a platform, placed\nbetween two columns, where such provisions as the priests had rescued\nfrom sacrifice were exposed for sale.\n\nAt one of the public edifices appropriated to the business of the city,\nworkmen were employed upon the columns, and you heard the noise of their\nlabor every now and then rising above the hum of the multitude: the\ncolumns are unfinished to this day!\n\nAll, then, united, nothing could exceed in variety the costumes, the\nranks, the manners, the occupations of the crowd--nothing could exceed\nthe bustle, the gaiety, the animation--where pleasure and commerce,\nidleness and labor, avarice and ambition, mingled in one gulf their\nmotley rushing, yet harmonius, streams.\n\nFacing the steps of the Temple of Jupiter, with folded arms, and a knit\nand contemptuous brow, stood a man of about fifty years of age. His\ndress was remarkably plain--not so much from its material, as from the\nabsence of all those ornaments which were worn by the Pompeians of every\nrank--partly from the love of show, partly, also, because they were\nchiefly wrought into those shapes deemed most efficacious in resisting\nthe assaults of magic and the influence of the evil eye.  His forehead\nwas high and bald; the few locks that remained at the back of the head\nwere concealed by a sort of cowl, which made a part of his cloak, to be\nraised or lowered at pleasure, and was now drawn half-way over the head,\nas a protection from the rays of the sun. The color of his garments was\nbrown, no popular hue with the Pompeians; all the usual admixtures of\nscarlet or purple seemed carefully excluded.  His belt, or girdle,\ncontained a small receptacle for ink, which hooked on to the girdle, a\nstilus (or implement of writing), and tablets of no ordinary size.  What\nwas rather remarkable, the cincture held no purse, which was the almost\nindispensable appurtenance of the girdle, even when that purse had the\nmisfortune to be empty!\n\nIt was not often that the gay and egotistical Pompeians busied\nthemselves with observing the countenances and actions of their\nneighbors; but there was that in the lip and eye of this bystander so\nremarkably bitter and disdainful, as he surveyed the religious\nprocession sweeping up the stairs of the temple, that it could not fail\nto arrest the notice of many.\n\n'Who is yon cynic?' asked a merchant of his companion, a jeweller.\n\n'It is Olinthus,' replied the jeweller; 'a reputed Nazarene.'\n\nThe merchant shuddered.  'A dread sect!' said he, in a whispered and\nfearful voice.  'It is said that when they meet at nights they always\ncommence their ceremonies by the murder of a new-born babe; they profess\na community of goods, too--the wretches!  A community of goods!  What\nwould become of merchants, or jewellers either, if such notions were in\nfashion?'\n\n'That is very true,' said the jeweller; 'besides, they wear no\njewels--they mutter imprecations when they see a serpent; and at Pompeii\nall our ornaments are serpentine.'\n\n'Do but observe,' said a third, who was a fabricant of bronze, 'how yon\nNazarene scowls at the piety of the sacrificial procession. He is\nmurmuring curses on the temple, be sure.  Do you know, Celcinus, that\nthis fellow, passing by my shop the other day, and seeing me employed on\na statue of Minerva, told me with a frown that, had it been marble, he\nwould have broken it; but the bronze was too strong for him.  \"Break a\ngoddess!\" said I.  \"A goddess!\" answered the atheist; \"it is a demon--an\nevil spirit!\" Then he passed on his way cursing.  Are such things to be\nborne?  What marvel that the earth heaved so fearfully last night,\nanxious to reject the atheist from her bosom?--An atheist, do I say?\nworse still--a scorner of the Fine Arts! Woe to us fabricants of bronze,\nif such fellows as this give the law to society!'\n\n'These are the incendiaries that burnt Rome under Nero,' groaned the\njeweller.\n\nWhile such were the friendly remarks provoked by the air and faith of\nthe Nazarene, Olinthus himself became sensible of the effect he was\nproducing; he turned his eyes round, and observed the intent faces of\nthe accumulating throng, whispering as they gazed; and surveying them\nfor a moment with an expression, first of defiance and afterwards of\ncompassion, he gathered his cloak round him and passed on, muttering\naudibly, 'Deluded idolaters!--did not last night's convulsion warn ye?\nAlas! how will ye meet the last day?'\n\nThe crowd that heard these boding words gave them different\ninterpretations, according to their different shades of ignorance and of\nfear; all, however, concurred in imagining them to convey some awful\nimprecation.  They regarded the Christian as the enemy of mankind; the\nepithets they lavished upon him, of which 'Atheist' was the most favored\nand frequent, may serve, perhaps, to warn us, believers of that same\ncreed now triumphant, how we indulge the persecution of opinion Olinthus\nthen underwent, and how we apply to those whose notions differ from our\nown the terms at that day lavished on the fathers of our faith.\n\nAs Olinthus stalked through the crowd, and gained one of the more\nprivate places of egress from the forum, he perceived gazing upon him a\npale and earnest countenance, which he was not slow to recognize.\n\nWrapped in a pallium that partially concealed his sacred robes, the\nyoung Apaecides surveyed the disciple of that new and mysterious creed,\nto which at one time he had been half a convert.\n\n'Is he, too, an impostor?  Does this man, so plain and simple in life,\nin garb, in mien--does he too, like Arbaces, make austerity the robe of\nthe sensualist?  Does the veil of Vesta hide the vices of the\nprostitute?'\n\nOlinthus, accustomed to men of all classes, and combining with the\nenthusiasm of his faith a profound experience of his kind, guessed,\nperhaps, by the index of the countenance, something of what passed\nwithin the breast of the priest.  He met the survey of Apaecides with a\nsteady eye, and a brow of serene and open candour.\n\n'Peace be with thee!' said he, saluting Apaecides.\n\n'Peace!' echoed the priest, in so hollow a tone that it went at once to\nthe heart of the Nazarene.\n\n'In that wish,' continued Olinthus, 'all good things are\ncombined--without virtue thou canst not have peace.  Like the rainbow,\nPeace rests upon the earth, but its arch is lost in heaven.  Heaven\nbathes it in hues of light--it springs up amidst tears and clouds--it is\na reflection of the Eternal Sun--it is an assurance of calm--it is the\nsign of a great covenant between Man and God.  Such peace, O young man!\nis the smile of the soul; it is an emanation from the distant orb of\nimmortal light.  PEACE be with you!'\n\n'Alas!' began Apaecides, when he caught the gaze of the curious\nloiterers, inquisitive to know what could possibly be the theme of\nconversation between a reputed Nazarene and a priest of Isis.  He\nstopped short, and then added in a low tone: 'We cannot converse here, I\nwill follow thee to the banks of the river; there is a walk which at\nthis time is usually deserted and solitary.'\n\nOlinthus bowed assent.  He passed through the streets with a hasty step,\nbut a quick and observant eye.  Every now and then he exchanged a\nsignificant glance, a slight sign, with some passenger, whose garb\nusually betokened the wearer to belong to the humbler classes; for\nChristianity was in this the type of all other and less mighty\nrevolutions--the grain of mustard-seed was in the heart of the lowly.\nAmidst the huts of poverty and labor, the vast stream which afterwards\npoured its broad waters beside the cities and palaces of earth took its\nneglected source.\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nTHE NOONDAY EXCURSION ON THE CAMPANIAN SEAS.\n\n'BUT tell me, Glaucus,' said Ione, as they glided down the rippling\nSarnus in their boat of pleasure, 'how camest thou with Apaecides to my\nrescue from that bad man?'\n\n'Ask Nydia yonder,' answered the Athenian, pointing to the blind girl,\nwho sat at a little distance from them, leaning pensively over her lyre;\n'she must have thy thanks, not we.  It seems that she came to my house,\nand, finding me from home, sought thy brother in his temple; he\naccompanied her to Arbaces; on their way they encountered me, with a\ncompany of friends, whom thy kind letter had given me a spirit cheerful\nenough to join.  Nydia's quick ear detected my voice--a few words\nsufficed to make me the companion of Apaecides; I told not my associates\nwhy I left them--could I trust thy name to their light tongues and\ngossiping opinion?--Nydia led us to the garden gate, by which we\nafterwards bore thee--we entered, and were about to plunge into the\nmysteries of that evil house, when we heard thy cry in another\ndirection.  Thou knowest the rest.'\n\nIone blushed deeply.  She then raised her eyes to those of Glaucus, and\nhe felt all the thanks she could not utter.  'Come hither, my Nydia,'\nsaid she, tenderly, to the Thessalian.\n\n'Did I not tell thee that thou shouldst be my sister and friend? Hast\nthou not already been more?--my guardian, my preserver!'\n\n'It is nothing,' answered Nydia coldly, and without stirring.\n\n'Ah! I forgot,' continued Ione, 'I should come to thee'; and she moved\nalong the benches till she reached the place where Nydia sat, and\nflinging her arms caressingly round her, covered her cheeks with kisses.\n\nNydia was that morning paler than her wont, and her countenance grew\neven more wan and colorless as she submitted to the embrace of the\nbeautiful Neapolitan.  'But how camest thou, Nydia,' whispered Ione, 'to\nsurmise so faithfully the danger I was exposed to?  Didst thou know\naught of the Egyptian?'\n\n'Yes, I knew of his vices.'\n\n'And how?'\n\n'Noble Ione, I have been a slave to the vicious--those whom I served\nwere his minions.'\n\n'And thou hast entered his house since thou knewest so well that private\nentrance?'\n\n'I have played on my lyre to Arbaces,' answered the Thessalian, with\nembarrassment.\n\n'And thou hast escaped the contagion from which thou hast saved Ione?'\nreturned the Neapolitan, in a voice too low for the ear of Glaucus.\n\n'Noble Ione, I have neither beauty nor station; I am a child, and a\nslave, and blind.  The despicable are ever safe.'\n\nIt was with a pained, and proud, and indignant tone that Nydia made this\nhumble reply; and Ione felt that she only wounded Nydia by pursuing the\nsubject.  She remained silent, and the bark now floated into the sea.\n\n'Confess that I was right, Ione,' said Glaucus, 'in prevailing on thee\nnot to waste this beautiful noon in thy chamber--confess that I was\nright.'\n\n'Thou wert right, Glaucus,' said Nydia, abruptly.\n\n'The dear child speaks for thee,' returned the Athenian.  'But permit me\nto move opposite to thee, or our light boat will be over-balanced.'\n\nSo saying, he took his seat exactly opposite to Ione, and leaning\nforward, he fancied that it was her breath, and not the winds of summer,\nthat flung fragrance over the sea.\n\n'Thou wert to tell me,' said Glaucus, 'why for so many days thy door was\nclosed to me?'\n\n'Oh, think of it no more!' answered Ione, quickly; 'I gave my ear to\nwhat I now know was the malice of slander.'\n\n'And my slanderer was the Egyptian?'\n\nIone's silence assented to the question.\n\n'His motives are sufficiently obvious.'\n\n'Talk not of him,' said Ione, covering her face with her hands, as if to\nshut out his very thought.\n\n'Perhaps he may be already by the banks of the slow Styx,' resumed\nGlaucus; 'yet in that case we should probably have heard of his death.\nThy brother, methinks, hath felt the dark influence of his gloomy soul.\nWhen we arrived last night at thy house he left me abruptly. Will he\never vouchsafe to be my friend?'\n\n'He is consumed with some secret care,' answered Ione, tearfully.\n'Would that we could lure him from himself!  Let us join in that tender\noffice.'\n\n'He shall be my brother,' returned the Greek.\n\n'How calmly,' said Ione, rousing herself from the gloom into which her\nthoughts of Apaecides had plunged her--'how calmly the clouds seem to\nrepose in heaven; and yet you tell me, for I knew it not myself, that\nthe earth shook beneath us last night.'\n\n'It did, and more violently, they say, than it has done since the great\nconvulsion sixteen years ago: the land we live in yet nurses mysterious\nterror; and the reign of Pluto, which spreads beneath our burning\nfields, seems rent with unseen commotion.  Didst thou not feel the earth\nquake, Nydia, where thou wert seated last night?  and was it not the\nfear that it occasioned thee that made thee weep?'\n\n'I felt the soil creep and heave beneath me, like some monstrous\nserpent,' answered Nydia; 'but as I saw nothing, I did not fear: I\nimagined the convulsion to be a spell of the Egyptian's.  They say he\nhas power over the elements.'\n\n'Thou art a Thessalian, my Nydia,' replied Glaucus, 'and hast a national\nright to believe in magic.\n\n'Magic!--who doubts it?' answered Nydia, simply: 'dost thou?'\n\n'Until last night (when a necromantic prodigy did indeed appal me),\nmethinks I was not credulous in any other magic save that of love!' said\nGlaucus, in a tremulous voice, and fixing his eyes on Ione.\n\n'Ah!' said Nydia, with a sort of shiver, and she awoke mechanically a\nfew pleasing notes from her lyre; the sound suited well the tranquility\nof the waters, and the sunny stillness of the noon.\n\n'Play to us, dear Nydia, said Glaucus--'play and give us one of thine\nold Thessalian songs: whether it be of magic or not, as thou wilt--let\nit, at least, be of love!'\n\n'Of love!' repeated Nydia, raising her large, wandering eyes, that ever\nthrilled those who saw them with a mingled fear and pity; you could\nnever familiarize yourself to their aspect: so strange did it seem that\nthose dark wild orbs were ignorant of the day, and either so fixed was\ntheir deep mysterious gaze, or so restless and perturbed their glance,\nthat you felt, when you encountered them, that same vague, and chilling,\nand half-preternatural impression, which comes over you in the presence\nof the insane--of those who, having a life outwardly like your own, have\na life within life--dissimilar--unsearchable--unguessed!\n\n'Will you that I should sing of love?' said she, fixing those eyes upon\nGlaucus.\n\n'Yes,' replied he, looking down.\n\nShe moved a little way from the arm of Ione, still cast round her, as if\nthat soft embrace embarrassed; and placing her light and graceful\ninstrument on her knee, after a short prelude, she sang the following\nstrain:\n\n\n               NYDIA'S LOVE-SONG\n\n                     I\n\n         The Wind and the Beam loved the Rose,\n           And the Rose loved one;\n          For who recks the wind where it blows?\n          Or loves not the sun?\n\n                     II\n\n         None knew whence the humble Wind stole,\n           Poor sport of the skies--\n         None dreamt that the Wind had a soul,\n           In its mournful sighs!\n\n                    III\n\n         Oh, happy Beam! how canst thou prove\n           That bright love of thine?\n          In thy light is the proof of thy love.\n           Thou hast but--to shine!\n\n                     IV\n\n         How its love can the Wind reveal?\n           Unwelcome its sigh;\n          Mute--mute to its Rose let it steal--\n          Its proof is--to die!\n\n'Thou singest but sadly, sweet girl,' said Glaucus; 'thy youth only\nfeels as yet the dark shadow of Love; far other inspiration doth he\nwake, when he himself bursts and brightens upon us.\n\n'I sing as I was taught,' replied Nydia, sighing.\n\n'Thy master was love-crossed, then--try thy hand at a gayer air. Nay,\ngirl, give the instrument to me.' As Nydia obeyed, her hand touched his,\nand, with that slight touch, her breast heaved--her cheek flushed.  Ione\nand Glaucus, occupied with each other, perceived not those signs of\nstrange and premature emotions, which preyed upon a heart that,\nnourished by imagination, dispensed with hope.\n\nAnd now, broad, blue, bright, before them, spread that halcyon sea, fair\nas at this moment, seventeen centuries from that date, I behold it\nrippling on the same divinest shores.  Clime that yet enervates with a\nsoft and Circean spell--that moulds us insensibly, mysteriously, into\nharmony with thyself, banishing the thought of austerer labor, the\nvoices of wild ambition, the contests and the roar of life; filling us\nwith gentle and subduing dreams, making necessary to our nature that\nwhich is its least earthly portion, so that the very air inspires us\nwith the yearning and thirst of love. Whoever visits thee seems to leave\nearth and its harsh cares behind--to enter by the Ivory gate into the\nLand of Dreams.  The young and laughing Hours of the PRESENT--the Hours,\nthose children of Saturn, which he hungers ever to devour, seem snatched\nfrom his grasp.  The past--the future--are forgotten; we enjoy but the\nbreathing time. Flower of the world's garden--Fountain of Delight--Italy\nof Italy--beautiful, benign Campania!--vain were, indeed, the Titans, if\non this spot they yet struggled for another heaven!  Here, if God meant\nthis working-day life for a perpetual holiday, who would not sigh to\ndwell for ever--asking nothing, hoping nothing, fearing nothing, while\nthy skies shine over him--while thy seas sparkle at his feet--while\nthine air brought him sweet messages from the violet and the orange--and\nwhile the heart, resigned to--beating with--but one emotion, could find\nthe lips and the eyes, which flatter it (vanity of vanities!) that love\ncan defy custom, and be eternal?\n\nIt was then in this clime--on those seas, that the Athenian gazed upon a\nface that might have suited the nymph, the spirit of the place: feeding\nhis eyes on the changeful roses of that softest cheek, happy beyond the\nhappiness of common life, loving, and knowing himself beloved.\n\nIn the tale of human passion, in past ages, there is something of\ninterest even in the remoteness of the time.  We love to feel within us\nthe bond which unites the most distant era--men, nations, customs\nperish; THE AFFECTIONS ARE IMMORTAL!--they are the sympathies which\nunite the ceaseless generations.  The past lives again, when we look\nupon its emotions--it lives in our own!  That which was, ever is!  The\nmagician's gift, that revives the dead--that animates the dust of\nforgotten graves, is not in the author's skill--it is in the heart of\nthe reader!\n\nStill vainly seeking the eyes of Ione, as, half downcast, half averted,\nthey shunned his own, the Athenian, in a low and soft voice, thus\nexpressed the feelings inspired by happier thoughts than those which had\ncolored the song of Nydia.\n\n\n THE SONG OF GLAUCUS\n\n                    I\n   As the bark floateth on o'er the summer-lit sea,\n    Floats my heart o'er the deeps of its passion for thee;\n    All lost in the space, without terror it glides,\n    For bright with thy soul is the face of the tides.\n    Now heaving, now hush'd, is that passionate ocean,\n    As it catches thy smile or thy sighs;\n    And the twin-stars that shine on the wanderer's devotion\n    Its guide and its god--are thine eyes!\n\n                    II\n\n   The bark may go down, should the cloud sweep above,\n    For its being is bound to the light of thy love.\n    As thy faith and thy smile are its life and its joy,\n    So thy frown or thy change are the storms that destroy.\n    Ah! sweeter to sink while the sky is serene,\n     If time hath a change for thy heart!\n    If to live be to weep over what thou hast been,\n     Let me die while I know what thou art!\n\nAs the last words of the song trembled over the sea, Ione raised her\nlooks--they met those of her lover.  Happy Nydia!--happy in thy\naffliction, that thou couldst not see that fascinated and charmed gaze,\nthat said so much--that made the eye the voice of the soul--that\npromised the impossibility of change!\n\nBut, though the Thessalian could not detect that gaze, she divined its\nmeaning by their silence--by their sighs.  She pressed her hands lightly\nacross her breast, as if to keep down its bitter and jealous thoughts;\nand then she hastened to speak--for that silence was intolerable to her.\n\n'After all, O Glaucus!' said she, 'there is nothing very mirthful in\nyour strain!'\n\n'Yet I meant it to be so, when I took up thy lyre, pretty one. Perhaps\nhappiness will not permit us to be mirthful.'\n\n'How strange is it,' said Ione, changing a conversation which oppressed\nher while it charmed--'that for the last several days yonder cloud has\nhung motionless over Vesuvius!  Yet not indeed motionless, for sometimes\nit changes its form; and now methinks it looks like some vast giant,\nwith an arm outstretched over the city.  Dost thou see the likeness--or\nis it only to my fancy?'\n\n'Fair Ione!  I see it also.  It is astonishingly distinct.  The giant\nseems seated on the brow of the mountain, the different shades of the\ncloud appear to form a white robe that sweeps over its vast breast and\nlimbs; it seems to gaze with a steady face upon the city below, to point\nwith one hand, as thou sayest, over its glittering streets, and to raise\nthe other (dost thou note it?) towards the higher heaven. It is like the\nghost of some huge Titan brooding over the beautiful world he lost;\nsorrowful for the past--yet with something of menace for the future.'\n\n'Could that mountain have any connection with the last night's\nearthquake? They say that, ages ago, almost in the earliest era of\ntradition, it gave forth fires as AEtna still.  Perhaps the flames yet\nlurk and dart beneath.'\n\n'It is possible,' said Glaucus, musingly.\n\n'Thou sayest thou art slow to believe in magic,' said Nydia, suddenly.\n'I have heard that a potent witch dwells amongst the scorched caverns of\nthe mountain, and yon cloud may be the dim shadow of the demon she\nconfers with.'\n\n'Thou art full of the romance of thy native Thessaly,' said Glaucus;\n'and a strange mixture of sense and all conflicting superstitions.'\n\n'We are ever superstitious in the dark,' replied Nydia.  'Tell me,' she\nadded, after a slight pause, 'tell me, O Glaucus! do all that are\nbeautiful resemble each other?  They say you are beautiful, and Ione\nalso.  Are your faces then the same?  I fancy not, yet it ought to be\nso.'\n\n'Fancy no such grievous wrong to Ione,' answered Glaucus, laughing.\n'But we do not, alas! resemble each other, as the homely and the\nbeautiful sometimes do.  Ione's hair is dark, mine light; Ione's eyes\nare--what color, Ione?  I cannot see, turn them to me.  Oh, are they\nblack? no, they are too soft. Are they blue? no, they are too deep: they\nchange with every ray of the sun--I know not their color: but mine,\nsweet Nydia, are grey, and bright only when Ione shines on them!  Ione's\ncheek is...'\n\n'I do not understand one word of thy description,' interrupted Nydia,\npeevishly.  'I comprehend only that you do not resemble each other, and\nI am glad of it.'\n\n'Why, Nydia?' said Ione.\n\nNydia colored slightly.  'Because,' she replied, coldly, 'I have always\nimagined you under different forms, and one likes to know one is right.'\n\n'And what hast thou imagined Glaucus to resemble?' asked Ione, softly.\n\n'Music!' replied Nydia, looking down.\n\n'Thou art right,' thought Ione.\n\n'And what likeness hast thou ascribed to Ione?'\n\n'I cannot tell yet,' answered the blind girl; 'I have not yet known her\nlong enough to find a shape and sign for my guesses.'\n\n'I will tell thee, then,' said Glaucus, passionately; 'she is like the\nsun that warms--like the wave that refreshes.'\n\n'The sun sometimes scorches, and the wave sometimes drowns,' answered\nNydia.\n\n'Take then these roses,' said Glaucus; 'let their fragrance suggest to\nthee Ione.'\n\n'Alas, the roses will fade!' said the Neapolitan, archly.\n\nThus conversing, they wore away the hours; the lovers, conscious only of\nthe brightness and smiles of love; the blind girl feeling only its\ndarkness--its tortures--the fierceness of jealousy and its woe!\n\nAnd now, as they drifted on, Glaucus once more resumed the lyre, and\nwoke its strings with a careless hand to a strain, so wildly and gladly\nbeautiful, that even Nydia was aroused from her reverie, and uttered a\ncry of admiration.\n\n'Thou seest, my child,' cried Glaucus, 'that I can yet redeem the\ncharacter of love's music, and that I was wrong in saying happiness\ncould not be gay. Listen, Nydia! listen, dear Ione! and hear:\n\n             THE BIRTH OF LOVE\n\n                    I\n\n         Like a Star in the seas above,\n             Like a Dream to the waves of sleep--\n        Up--up--THE INCARNATE LOVE--\n            She rose from the charmed deep!\n          And over the Cyprian Isle\n          The skies shed their silent smile;\n          And the Forest's green heart was rife\n          With the stir of the gushing life--\n         The life that had leap'd to birth,\n          In the veins of the happy earth!\n                Hail! oh, hail!\n          The dimmest sea-cave below thee,\n             The farthest sky-arch above,\n          In their innermost stillness know thee:\n             And heave with the Birth of Love!\n                Gale! soft Gale!\n          Thou comest on thy silver winglets,\n             From thy home in the tender west,\n          Now fanning her golden ringlets,\n             Now hush'd on her heaving breast.\n          And afar on the murmuring sand,\n          The Seasons wait hand in hand\n          To welcome thee, Birth Divine,\n          To the earth which is henceforth thine.\n\n                    II\n\n         Behold! how she kneels in the shell,\n          Bright pearl in its floating cell!\n          Behold! how the shell's rose-hues,\n             The cheek and the breast of snow,\n          And the delicate limbs suffuse,\n             Like a blush, with a bashful glow.\n          Sailing on, slowly sailing\n             O'er the wild water;\n          All hail! as the fond light is hailing\n             Her daughter,\n                   All hail!\n          We are thine, all thine evermore:\n          Not a leaf on the laughing shore,\n          Not a wave on the heaving sea,\n             Nor a single sigh\n             In the boundless sky,\n          But is vow'd evermore to thee!\n\n                   III\n\n         And thou, my beloved one--thou,\n           As I gaze on thy soft eyes now,\n          Methinks from their depths I view\n          The Holy Birth born anew;\n          Thy lids are the gentle cell\n             Where the young Love blushing lies;\n          See! she breaks from the mystic shell,\n             She comes from thy tender eyes!\n                Hail! all hail!\n          She comes, as she came from the sea,\n          To my soul as it looks on thee;\n             She comes, she comes!\n          She comes, as she came from the sea,\n          To my soul as it looks on thee!\n                Hail! all hail!\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nTHE CONGREGATION.\n\nFOLLOWED by Apaecides, the Nazarene gained the side of the Sarnus--that\nriver, which now has shrunk into a petty stream, then rushed gaily into\nthe sea, covered with countless vessels, and reflecting on its waves the\ngardens, the vines, the palaces, and the temples of Pompeii.  From its\nmore noisy and frequented banks, Olinthus directed his steps to a path\nwhich ran amidst a shady vista of trees, at the distance of a few paces\nfrom the river.  This walk was in the evening a favorite resort of the\nPompeians, but during the heat and business of the day was seldom\nvisited, save by some groups of playful children, some meditative poet,\nor some disputative philosophers.  At the side farthest from the river,\nfrequent copses of box interspersed the more delicate and evanescent\nfoliage, and these were cut into a thousand quaint shapes, sometimes\ninto the forms of fauns and satyrs, sometimes into the mimicry of\nEgyptian pyramids, sometimes into the letters that composed the name of\na popular or eminent citizen.  Thus the false taste is equally ancient\nas the pure; and the retired traders of Hackney and Paddington, a\ncentury ago, were little aware, perhaps, that in their tortured yews and\nsculptured box, they found their models in the most polished period of\nRoman antiquity, in the gardens of Pompeii, and the villas of the\nfastidious Pliny.\n\nThis walk now, as the noonday sun shone perpendicularly through the\nchequered leaves, was entirely deserted; at least no other forms than\nthose of Olinthus and the priest infringed upon the solitude. They sat\nthemselves on one of the benches, placed at intervals between the trees,\nand facing the faint breeze that came languidly from the river, whose\nwaves danced and sparkled before them--a singular and contrasted pair;\nthe believer in the latest--the priest of the most ancient--worship of\nthe world!\n\n'Since thou leftst me so abruptly,' said Olinthus, 'hast thou been\nhappy? has thy heart found contentment under these priestly robes? hast\nthou, still yearning for the voice of God, heard it whisper comfort to\nthee from the oracles of Isis?  That sigh, that averted countenance,\ngive me the answer my soul predicted.'\n\n'Alas!' answered Apaecides, sadly, 'thou seest before thee a wretched\nand distracted man!  From my childhood upward I have idolized the dreams\nof virtue!  I have envied the holiness of men who, in caves and lonely\ntemples, have been admitted to the companionship of beings above the\nworld; my days have been consumed with feverish and vague desires; my\nnights with mocking but solemn visions.  Seduced by the mystic\nprophecies of an impostor, I have indued these robes;--my nature (I\nconfess it to thee frankly)--my nature has revolted at what I have seen\nand been doomed to share in! Searching after truth, I have become but\nthe minister of falsehoods. On the evening in which we last met, I was\nbuoyed by hopes created by that same impostor, whom I ought already to\nhave better known.  I have--no matter--no matter! suffice it, I have\nadded perjury and sin to rashness and to sorrow.  The veil is now rent\nfor ever from my eyes; I behold a villain where I obeyed a demigod; the\nearth darkens in my sight; I am in the deepest abyss of gloom; I know\nnot if there be gods above; if we are the things of chance; if beyond\nthe bounded and melancholy present there is annihilation or an\nhereafter--tell me, then, thy faith; solve me these doubts, if thou hast\nindeed the power!'\n\n'I do not marvel,' answered the Nazarene, 'that thou hast thus erred, or\nthat thou art thus sceptic.  Eighty years ago there was no assurance to\nman of God, or of a certain and definite future beyond the grave.  New\nlaws are declared to him who has ears--a heaven, a true Olympus, is\nrevealed to him who has eyes--heed then, and listen.'\n\nAnd with all the earnestness of a man believing ardently himself, and\nzealous to convert, the Nazarene poured forth to Apaecides the\nassurances of Scriptural promise.  He spoke first of the sufferings and\nmiracles of Christ--he wept as he spoke: he turned next to the glories\nof the Saviour's Ascension--to the clear predictions of Revelation.  He\ndescribed that pure and unsensual heaven destined to the virtuous--those\nfires and torments that were the doom of guilt.\n\nThe doubts which spring up to the mind of later reasoners, in the\nimmensity of the sacrifice of God to man, were not such as would occur\nto an early heathen.  He had been accustomed to believe that the gods\nhad lived upon earth, and taken upon themselves the forms of men; had\nshared in human passions, in human labours, and in human misfortunes.\nWhat was the travail of his own Alcmena's son, whose altars now smoked\nwith the incense of countless cities, but a toil for the human race?\nHad not the great Dorian Apollo expiated a mystic sin by descending to\nthe grave?  Those who were the deities of heaven had been the lawgivers\nor benefactors on earth, and gratitude had led to worship.  It seemed\ntherefore, to the heathen, a doctrine neither new nor strange, that\nChrist had been sent from heaven, that an immortal had indued mortality,\nand tasted the bitterness of death. And the end for which He thus toiled\nand thus suffered--how far more glorious did it seem to Apaecides than\nthat for which the deities of old had visited the nether world, and\npassed through the gates of death!  Was it not worthy of a God to\ndescend to these dim valleys, in order to clear up the clouds gathered\nover the dark mount beyond--to satisfy the doubts of sages--to convert\nspeculation into certainty--by example to point out the rules of\nlife--by revelation to solve the enigma of the grave--and to prove that\nthe soul did not yearn in vain when it dreamed of an immortality?  In\nthis last was the great argument of those lowly men destined to convert\nthe earth.  As nothing is more flattering to the pride and the hopes of\nman than the belief in a future state, so nothing could be more vague\nand confused than the notions of the heathen sages upon that mystic\nsubject. Apaecides had already learned that the faith of the\nphilosophers was not that of the herd; that if they secretly professed a\ncreed in some diviner power, it was not the creed which they thought it\nwise to impart to the community.  He had already learned, that even the\npriest ridiculed what he preached to the people--that the notions of the\nfew and the many were never united.  But, in this new faith, it seemed\nto him that philosopher, priest, and people, the expounders of the\nreligion and its followers, were alike accordant: they did not speculate\nand debate upon immortality, they spoke of as a thing certain and\nassured; the magnificence of the promise dazzled him--its consolations\nsoothed. For the Christian faith made its early converts among sinners!\nmany of its fathers and its martyrs were those who had felt the\nbitterness of vice, and who were therefore no longer tempted by its\nfalse aspect from the paths of an austere and uncompromising virtue.\nAll the assurances of this healing faith invited to repentance--they\nwere peculiarly adapted to the bruised and sore of spirit! the very\nremorse which Apaecides felt for his late excesses, made him incline to\none who found holiness in that remorse, and who whispered of the joy in\nheaven over one sinner that repenteth.\n\n'Come,' said the Nazarene, as he perceived the effect he had produced,\n'come to the humble hall in which we meet--a select and a chosen few;\nlisten there to our prayers; note the sincerity of our repentant tears;\nmingle in our simple sacrifice--not of victims, nor of garlands, but\noffered by white-robed thoughts upon the altar of the heart.  The\nflowers that we lay there are imperishable--they bloom over us when we\nare no more; nay, they accompany us beyond the grave, they spring up\nbeneath our feet in heaven, they delight us with an eternal odor, for\nthey are of the soul, they partake of its nature; these offerings are\ntemptations overcome, and sins repented. Come, oh come! lose not another\nmoment; prepare already for the great, the awful journey, from darkness\nto light, from sorrow to bliss, from corruption to immortality!  This is\nthe day of the Lord the Son, a day that we have set apart for our\ndevotions.  Though we meet usually at night, yet some amongst us are\ngathered together even now.  What joy, what triumph, will be with us\nall, if we can bring one stray lamb into the sacred fold!'\n\nThere seemed to Apaecides, so naturally pure of heart, something\nineffably generous and benign in that spirit of conversation which\nanimated Olinthus--a spirit that found its own bliss in the happiness of\nothers--that sought in its wide sociality to make companions for\neternity.  He was touched, softened, and subdued.  He was not in that\nmood which can bear to be left alone; curiosity, too, mingled with his\npurer stimulants--he was anxious to see those rites of which so many\ndark and contradictory rumours were afloat.  He paused a moment, looked\nover his garb, thought of Arbaces, shuddered with horror, lifted his\neyes to the broad brow of the Nazarene, intent, anxious, watchful--but\nfor his benefits, for his salvation!  He drew his cloak round him, so as\nwholly to conceal his robes, and said, 'Lead on, I follow thee.'\n\nOlinthus pressed his hand joyfully, and then descending to the river\nside, hailed one of the boats that plyed there constantly; they entered\nit; an awning overhead, while it sheltered them from the sun, screened\nalso their persons from observation: they rapidly skimmed the wave.\nFrom one of the boats that passed them floated a soft music, and its\nprow was decorated with flowers--it was gliding towards the sea.\n\n'So,' said Olinthus, sadly, 'unconscious and mirthful in their\ndelusions, sail the votaries of luxury into the great ocean of storm and\nshipwreck! we pass them, silent and unnoticed, to gain the land.'\n\nApaecides, lifting his eyes, caught through the aperture in the awning a\nglimpse of the face of one of the inmates of that gay bark--it was the\nface of Ione.  The lovers were embarked on the excursion at which we\nhave been made present.  The priest sighed, and once more sunk back upon\nhis seat. They reached the shore where, in the suburbs, an alley of\nsmall and mean houses stretched towards the bank; they dismissed the\nboat, landed, and Olinthus, preceding the priest, threaded the labyrinth\nof lanes, and arrived at last at the closed door of a habitation\nsomewhat larger than its neighbors.  He knocked thrice--the door was\nopened and closed again, as Apaecides followed his guide across the\nthreshold.\n\nThey passed a deserted atrium, and gained an inner chamber of moderate\nsize, which, when the door was closed, received its only light from a\nsmall window cut over the door itself.  But, halting at the threshold of\nthis chamber, and knocking at the door, Olinthus said, 'Peace be with\nyou!' A voice from within returned, 'Peace with whom?' 'The Faithful!'\nanswered Olinthus, and the door opened; twelve or fourteen persons were\nsitting in a semicircle, silent, and seemingly absorbed in thought, and\nopposite to a crucifix rudely carved in wood.\n\nThey lifted up their eyes when Olinthus entered, without speaking; the\nNazarene himself, before he accosted them, knelt suddenly down, and by\nhis moving lips, and his eyes fixed steadfastly on the crucifix,\nApaecides saw that he prayed inly.  This rite performed, Olinthus turned\nto the congregation--'Men and brethren,' said he, 'start not to behold\namongst you a priest of Isis; he hath sojourned with the blind, but the\nSpirit hath fallen on him--he desires to see, to hear, and to\nunderstand.'\n\n'Let him,' said one of the assembly; and Apaecides beheld in the speaker\na man still younger than himself, of a countenance equally worn and\npallid, of an eye which equally spoke of the restless and fiery\noperations of a working mind.\n\n'Let him,' repeated a second voice, and he who thus spoke was in the\nprime of manhood; his bronzed skin and Asiatic features bespoke him a\nson of Syria--he had been a robber in his youth.\n\n'Let him,' said a third voice; and the priest, again turning to regard\nthe speaker, saw an old man with a long grey beard, whom he recognized\nas a slave to the wealthy Diomed.\n\n'Let him,' repeated simultaneously the rest--men who, with two\nexceptions, were evidently of the inferior ranks.  In these exceptions,\nApaecides noted an officer of the guard, and an Alexandrian merchant.\n\n'We do not,' recommenced Olinthus--'we do not bind you to secrecy; we\nimpose on you no oaths (as some of our weaker brethren would do) not to\nbetray us. It is true, indeed, that there is no absolute law against us;\nbut the multitude, more savage than their rulers, thirst for our lives.\nSo, my friends, when Pilate would have hesitated, it was the people who\nshouted \"Christ to the cross!\" But we bind you not to our safety--no!\nBetray us to the crowd--impeach, calumniate, malign us if you will--we\nare above death, we should walk cheerfully to the den of the lion, or\nthe rack of the torturer--we can trample down the darkness of the grave,\nand what is death to a criminal is eternity to the Christian.'\n\nA low and applauding murmur ran through the assembly.\n\n'Thou comest amongst us as an examiner, mayest thou remain a convert!\nOur religion? you behold it!  Yon cross our sole image, yon scroll the\nmysteries of our Caere and Eleusis!  Our morality? it is in our\nlives!--sinners we all have been; who now can accuse us of a crime? we\nhave baptized ourselves from the past.  Think not that this is of us, it\nis of God.  Approach, Medon,' beckoning to the old slave who had spoken\nthird for the admission of Apaecides, 'thou art the sole man amongst us\nwho is not free.  But in heaven, the last shall be first: so with us.\nUnfold your scroll, read and explain.'\n\nUseless would it be for us to accompany the lecture of Medon, or the\ncomments of the congregation.  Familiar now are those doctrines, then\nstrange and new.  Eighteen centuries have left us little to expound upon\nthe lore of Scripture or the life of Christ.  To us, too, there would\nseem little congenial in the doubts that occurred to a heathen priest,\nand little learned in the answers they receive from men uneducated,\nrude, and simple, possessing only the knowledge that they were greater\nthan they seemed.\n\nThere was one thing that greatly touched the Neapolitan: when the\nlecture was concluded, they heard a very gentle knock at the door; the\npassword was given, and replied to; the door opened, and two young\nchildren, the eldest of whom might have told its seventh year, entered\ntimidly; they were the children of the master of the house, that dark\nand hardy Syrian, whose youth had been spent in pillage and bloodshed.\nThe eldest of the congregation (it was that old slave) opened to them\nhis arms; they fled to the shelter--they crept to his breast--and his\nhard features smiled as he caressed them.  And then these bold and\nfervent men, nursed in vicissitude, beaten by the rough winds of\nlife--men of mailed and impervious fortitude, ready to affront a world,\nprepared for torment and armed for death--men, who presented all\nimaginable contrast to the weak nerves, the light hearts, the tender\nfragility of childhood, crowded round the infants, smoothing their\nrugged brows and composing their bearded lips to kindly and fostering\nsmiles: and then the old man opened the scroll and he taught the infants\nto repeat after him that beautiful prayer which we still dedicate to the\nLord, and still teach to our children; and then he told them, in simple\nphrase, of God's love to the young, and how not a sparrow falls but His\neye sees it.  This lovely custom of infant initiation was long cherished\nby the early Church, in memory of the words which said, 'Suffer little\nchildren to come unto me, and forbid them not'; and was perhaps the\norigin of the superstitious calumny which ascribed to the Nazarenes the\ncrime which the Nazarenes, when victorious, attributed to the Jew, viz.\nthe decoying children to hideous rites, at which they were secretly\nimmolated.\n\nAnd the stern paternal penitent seemed to feel in the innocence of his\nchildren a return into early life--life ere yet it sinned: he followed\nthe motion of their young lips with an earnest gaze; he smiled as they\nrepeated, with hushed and reverent looks, the holy words: and when the\nlesson was done, and they ran, released, and gladly to his knee, he\nclasped them to his breast, kissed them again and again, and tears\nflowed fast down his cheek--tears, of which it would have been\nimpossible to trace the source, so mingled they were with joy and\nsorrow, penitence and hope--remorse for himself and love for them!\n\nSomething, I say, there was in this scene which peculiarly affected\nApaecides; and, in truth, it is difficult to conceive a ceremony more\nappropriate to the religion of benevolence, more appealing to the\nhousehold and everyday affections, striking a more sensitive chord in\nthe human breast.\n\nIt was at this time that an inner door opened gently, and a very old man\nentered the chamber, leaning on a staff.  At his presence, the whole\ncongregation rose; there was an expression of deep, affectionate respect\nupon every countenance; and Apaecides, gazing on his countenance, felt\nattracted towards him by an irresistible sympathy.  No man ever looked\nupon that face without love; for there had dwelt the smile of the Deity,\nthe incarnation of divinest love--and the glory of the smile had never\npassed away.\n\n'My children, God be with you!' said the old man, stretching his arms;\nand as he spoke the infants ran to his knee.  He sat down, and they\nnestled fondly to his bosom.  It was beautiful to see that mingling of\nthe extremes of life--the rivers gushing from their early source--the\nmajestic stream gliding to the ocean of eternity!  As the light of\ndeclining day seems to mingle earth and heaven, making the outline of\neach scarce visible, and blending the harsh mountain-tops with the sky,\neven so did the smile of that benign old age appear to hallow the aspect\nof those around, to blend together the strong distinctions of varying\nyears, and to diffuse over infancy and manhood the light of that heaven\ninto which it must so soon vanish and be lost.\n\n'Father,' said Olinthus, 'thou on whose form the miracle of the Redeemer\nworked; thou who wert snatched from the grave to become the living\nwitness of His mercy and His power; behold! a stranger in our meeting--a\nnew lamb gathered to the fold!'\n\n'Let me bless him,' said the old man: the throng gave way. Apaecides\napproached him as by an instinct: he fell on his knees before him--the\nold man laid his hand on the priest's head, and blessed him, but not\naloud.  As his lips moved, his eyes were upturned, and tears--those\ntears that good men only shed in the hope of happiness to\nanother--flowed fast down his cheeks.\n\nThe children were on either side of the convert; his heart was\ntheirs--he had become as one of them--to enter into the kingdom of\nHeaven.\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nTHE STREAM OF LOVE RUNS ON.  WHITHER?\n\nDAYS are like years in the love of the young, when no bar, no obstacle,\nis between their hearts--when the sun shines, and the course runs\nsmooth--when their love is prosperous and confessed.  Ione no longer\nconcealed from Glaucus the attachment she felt for him, and their talk\nnow was only of their love.  Over the rapture of the present the hopes\nof the future glowed like the heaven above the gardens of spring.  They\nwent in their trustful thoughts far down the stream of time: they laid\nout the chart of their destiny to come; they suffered the light of\nto-day to suffuse the morrow. In the youth of their hearts it seemed as\nif care, and change, and death, were as things unknown.  Perhaps they\nloved each other the more because the condition of the world left to\nGlaucus no aim and no wish but love; because the distractions common in\nfree states to men's affections existed not for the Athenian; because\nhis country wooed him not to the bustle of civil life; because ambition\nfurnished no counterpoise to love: and, therefore, over their schemes\nand projects, love only reigned.  In the iron age they imagined\nthemselves of the golden, doomed only to live and to love.\n\nTo the superficial observer, who interests himself only in characters\nstrongly marked and broadly colored, both the lovers may seem of too\nslight and commonplace a mould: in the delineation of characters\npurposely subdued, the reader sometimes imagines that there is a want of\ncharacter; perhaps, indeed, I wrong the real nature of these two lovers\nby not painting more impressively their stronger individualities.  But\nin dwelling so much on their bright and birdlike existence, I am\ninfluenced almost insensibly by the forethought of the changes that\nawait them, and for which they were so ill prepared.  It was this very\nsoftness and gaiety of life that contrasted most strongly the\nvicissitudes of their coming fate.  For the oak without fruit or\nblossom, whose hard and rugged heart is fitted for the storm, there is\nless fear than for the delicate branches of the myrtle, and the laughing\nclusters of the vine.\n\nThey had now advanced far into August--the next month their marriage was\nfixed, and the threshold of Glaucus was already wreathed with garlands;\nand nightly, by the door of Ione, he poured forth the rich libations.\nHe existed no longer for his gay companions; he was ever with Ione.  In\nthe mornings they beguiled the sun with music: in the evenings they\nforsook the crowded haunts of the gay for excursions on the water, or\nalong the fertile and vine-clad plains that lay beneath the fatal mount\nof Vesuvius.  The earth shook no more; the lively Pompeians forgot even\nthat there had gone forth so terrible a warning of their approaching\ndoom.  Glaucus imagined that convulsion, in the vanity of his heathen\nreligion, an especial interposition of the gods, less in behalf of his\nown safety than that of Ione.  He offered up the sacrifices of gratitude\nat the temples of his faith; and even the altar of Isis was covered with\nhis votive garlands--as to the prodigy of the animated marble, he\nblushed at the effect it had produced on him.  He believed it, indeed,\nto have been wrought by the magic of man; but the result convinced him\nthat it betokened not the anger of a goddess.\n\nOf Arbaces, they heard only that he still lived; stretched on the bed of\nsuffering, he recovered slowly from the effect of the shock he had\nsustained--he left the lovers unmolested--but it was only to brood over\nthe hour and the method of revenge.\n\nAlike in their mornings at the house of Ione, and in their evening\nexcursions, Nydia was usually their constant, and often their sole\ncompanion.  They did not guess the secret fires which consumed her--the\nabrupt freedom with which she mingled in their conversation--her\ncapricious and often her peevish moods found ready indulgence in the\nrecollection of the service they owed her, and their compassion for her\naffliction.  They felt an interest in her, perhaps the greater and more\naffectionate from the very strangeness and waywardness of her nature,\nher singular alternations of passion and softness--the mixture of\nignorance and genius--of delicacy and rudeness--of the quick humors of\nthe child, and the proud calmness of the woman.  Although she refused to\naccept of freedom, she was constantly suffered to be free; she went\nwhere she listed; no curb was put either on her words or actions; they\nfelt for one so darkly fated, and so susceptible of every wound, the\nsame pitying and compliant indulgence the mother feels for a spoiled and\nsickly child--dreading to impose authority, even where they imagined it\nfor her benefit.  She availed herself of this license by refusing the\ncompanionship of the slave whom they wished to attend her. With the\nslender staff by which she guided her steps, she went now, as in her\nformer unprotected state, along the populous streets: it was almost\nmiraculous to perceive how quickly and how dexterously she threaded\nevery crowd, avoiding every danger, and could find her benighted way\nthrough the most intricate windings of the city.  But her chief delight\nwas still in visiting the few feet of ground which made the garden of\nGlaucus--in tending the flowers that at least repaid her love.\nSometimes she entered the chamber where he sat, and sought a\nconversation, which she nearly always broke off abruptly--for\nconversation with Glaucus only tended to one subject--Ione; and that\nname from his lips inflicted agony upon her.  Often she bitterly\nrepented the service she had rendered to Ione: often she said inly, 'If\nshe had fallen, Glaucus could have loved her no longer'; and then dark\nand fearful thoughts crept into her breast.\n\nShe had not experienced fully the trials that were in store for her,\nwhen she had been thus generous.  She had never before been present when\nGlaucus and Ione were together; she had never heard that voice so kind\nto her, so much softer to another.  The shock that crushed her heart\nwith the tidings that Glaucus loved, had at first only saddened and\nbenumbed--by degrees jealousy took a wilder and fiercer shape; it\npartook of hatred--it whispered revenge.  As you see the wind only\nagitate the green leaf upon the bough, while the leaf which has lain\nwithered and seared on the ground, bruised and trampled upon till the\nsap and life are gone, is suddenly whirled aloft--now here--now\nthere--without stay and without rest; so the love which visits the happy\nand the hopeful hath but freshness on its wings! its violence is but\nsportive.  But the heart that hath fallen from the green things of life,\nthat is without hope, that hath no summer in its fibres, is torn and\nwhirled by the same wind that but caresses its brethren--it hath no\nbough to cling to--it is dashed from path to path--till the winds fall,\nand it is crushed into the mire for ever.\n\nThe friendless childhood of Nydia had hardened prematurely her\ncharacter; perhaps the heated scenes of profligacy through which she had\npassed, seemingly unscathed, had ripened her passions, though they had\nnot sullied her purity.  The orgies of Burbo might only have disgusted,\nthe banquets of the Egyptian might only have terrified, at the moment;\nbut the winds that pass unheeded over the soil leave seeds behind them.\nAs darkness, too, favors the imagination, so, perhaps, her very\nblindness contributed to feed with wild and delirious visions the love\nof the unfortunate girl.  The voice of Glaucus had been the first that\nhad sounded musically to her ear; his kindness made a deep impression\nupon her mind; when he had left Pompeii in the former year, she had\ntreasured up in her heart every word he had uttered; and when any one\ntold her that this friend and patron of the poor flower-girl was the\nmost brilliant and the most graceful of the young revellers of Pompeii,\nshe had felt a pleasing pride in nursing his recollection.  Even the\ntask which she imposed upon herself, of tending his flowers, served to\nkeep him in her mind; she associated him with all that was most charming\nto her impressions; and when she had refused to express what image she\nfancied Ione to resemble, it was partly, perhaps, that whatever was\nbright and soft in nature she had already combined with the thought of\nGlaucus.  If any of my readers ever loved at an age which they would now\nsmile to remember--an age in which fancy forestalled the reason, let\nthem say whether that love, among all its strange and complicated\ndelicacies, was not, above all other and later passions, susceptible of\njealousy? I seek not here the cause: I know that it is commonly the\nfact.\n\nWhen Glaucus returned to Pompeii, Nydia had told another year of life;\nthat year, with its sorrows, its loneliness, its trials, had greatly\ndeveloped her mind and heart; and when the Athenian drew her\nunconsciously to his breast, deeming her still in soul as in years a\nchild--when he kissed her smooth cheek, and wound his arm round her\ntrembling frame, Nydia felt suddenly, and as by revelation, that those\nfeelings she had long and innocently cherished were of love.  Doomed to\nbe rescued from tyranny by Glaucus--doomed to take shelter under his\nroof--doomed to breathe, but for so brief a time, the same air--and\ndoomed, in the first rush of a thousand happy, grateful, delicious\nsentiments of an overflowing heart, to hear that he loved another; to be\ncommissioned to that other, the messenger, the minister; to feel all at\nonce that utter nothingness which she was--which she ever must be, but\nwhich, till then, her young mind had not taught her--that utter\nnothingness to him who was all to her; what wonder that, in her wild and\npassionate soul, all the elements jarred discordant; that if love\nreigned over the whole, it was not the love which is born of the more\nsacred and soft emotions?  Sometimes she dreaded only lest Glaucus\nshould discover her secret; sometimes she felt indignant that it was not\nsuspected: it was a sign of contempt--could he imagine that she presumed\nso far?  Her feelings to Ione ebbed and flowed with every hour; now she\nloved her because he did; now she hated him for the same cause.  There\nwere moments when she could have murdered her unconscious mistress;\nmoments when she could have laid down life for her.  These fierce and\ntremulous alternations of passion were too severe to be borne long.  Her\nhealth gave way, though she felt it not--her cheek paled--her step grew\nfeebler--tears came to her eyes more often, and relieved her less.\n\nOne morning, when she repaired to her usual task in the garden of the\nAthenian, she found Glaucus under the columns of the peristyle, with a\nmerchant of the town; he was selecting jewels for his destined bride.\nHe had already fitted up her apartment; the jewels he bought that day\nwere placed also within it--they were never fated to grace the fair form\nof Ione; they may be seen at this day among the disinterred treasures of\nPompeii, in the chambers of the studio at Naples.\n\n'Come hither, Nydia; put down thy vase, and come hither.  Thou must take\nthis chain from me--stay--there, I have put it on.  There, Servilius,\ndoes it not become her?'\n\n'Wonderfully!' answered the jeweller; for jewellers were well-bred and\nflattering men, even at that day.  'But when these ear-rings glitter in\nthe ears of the noble Ione, then, by Bacchus! you will see whether my\nart adds anything to beauty.'\n\n'Ione?' repeated Nydia, who had hitherto acknowledged by smiles and\nblushes the gift of Glaucus.\n\n'Yes,' replied the Athenian, carelessly toying with the gems; 'I am\nchoosing a present for Ione, but there are none worthy of her.'\n\nHe was startled as he spoke by an abrupt gesture of Nydia; she tore the\nchain violently from her neck, and dashed it on the ground.\n\n'How is this?  What, Nydia, dost thou not like the bauble? art thou\noffended?'\n\n'You treat me ever as a slave and as a child,' replied the Thessalian,\nwith ill-suppressed sobs, and she turned hastily away to the opposite\ncorner of the garden.\n\nGlaucus did not attempt to follow, or to soothe; he was offended; he\ncontinued to examine the jewels and to comment on their fashion--to\nobject to this and to praise that, and finally to be talked by the\nmerchant into buying all; the safest plan for a lover, and a plan that\nany one will do right to adopt, provided always that he can obtain an\nIone!\n\nWhen he had completed his purchase and dismissed the jeweller, he\nretired into his chamber, dressed, mounted his chariot, and went to\nIone.  He thought no more of the blind girl, or her offence; he had\nforgotten both the one and the other.\n\nHe spent the forenoon with his beautiful Neapolitan, repaired thence to\nthe baths, supped (if, as we have said before, we can justly so\ntranslate the three o'clock coena of the Romans) alone, and abroad, for\nPompeii had its restaurateurs--and returning home to change his dress\nere he again repaired to the house of Ione, he passed the peristyle, but\nwith the absorbed reverie and absent eyes of a man in love, and did not\nnote the form of the poor blind girl, bending exactly in the same place\nwhere he had left her.  But though he saw her not, her ear recognized at\nonce the sound of his step. She had been counting the moments to his\nreturn.  He had scarcely entered his favorite chamber, which opened on\nthe peristyle, and seated himself musingly on his couch, when he felt\nhis robe timorously touched, and, turning, he beheld Nydia kneeling\nbefore him, and holding up to him a handful of flowers--a gentle and\nappropriate peace-offering--her eyes, darkly upheld to his own, streamed\nwith tears.\n\n'I have offended thee,' said she, sobbing, 'and for the first time.  I\nwould die rather than cause thee a moment's pain--say that thou wilt\nforgive me. See! I have taken up the chain; I have put it on: I will\nnever part from it--it is thy gift.'\n\n'My dear Nydia,' returned Glaucus, and raising her, he kissed her\nforehead, 'think of it no more!  But why, my child, wert thou so\nsuddenly angry?  I could not divine the cause?'\n\n'Do not ask!' said she, coloring violently.  'I am a thing full of\nfaults and humors; you know I am but a child--you say so often: is it\nfrom a child that you can expect a reason for every folly?'\n\n'But, prettiest, you will soon be a child no more; and if you would have\nus treat you as a woman, you must learn to govern these singular\nimpulses and gales of passion.  Think not I chide: no, it is for your\nhappiness only I speak.'\n\n'It is true,' said Nydia, 'I must learn to govern myself I must bide, I\nmust suppress, my heart.  This is a woman's task and duty; methinks her\nvirtue is hypocrisy.'\n\n'Self-control is not deceit, my Nydia,' returned the Athenian; 'and that\nis the virtue necessary alike to man and to woman; it is the true\nsenatorial toga, the badge of the dignity it covers!'\n\n'Self-control! self-control!  Well, well, what you say is right! When I\nlisten to you, Glaucus, my wildest thoughts grow calm and sweet, and a\ndelicious serenity falls over me.  Advise, ah! guide me ever, my\npreserver!'\n\n'Thy affectionate heart will be thy best guide, Nydia, when thou hast\nlearned to regulate its feelings.'\n\n'Ah! that will be never,' sighed Nydia, wiping away her tears.\n\n'Say not so: the first effort is the only difficult one.'\n\n'I have made many first efforts,' answered Nydia, innocently.  'But you,\nmy Mentor, do you find it so easy to control yourself?  Can you conceal,\ncan you even regulate, your love for Ione?'\n\n'Love! dear Nydia: ah! that is quite another matter,' answered the young\npreceptor.\n\n'I thought so!' returned Nydia, with a melancholy smile.  'Glaucus, wilt\nthou take my poor flowers?  Do with them as thou wilt--thou canst give\nthem to Ione,' added she, with a little hesitation.\n\n'Nay, Nydia,' answered Glaucus, kindly, divining something of jealousy\nin her language, though he imagined it only the jealousy of a vain and\nsusceptible child; 'I will not give thy pretty flowers to any one.  Sit\nhere and weave them into a garland; I will wear it this night: it is not\nthe first those delicate fingers have woven for me.'\n\nThe poor girl delightedly sat down beside Glaucus.  She drew from her\ngirdle a ball of the many-colored threads, or rather slender ribands,\nused in the weaving of garlands, and which (for it was her professional\noccupation) she carried constantly with her, and began quickly and\ngracefully to commence her task.  Upon her young cheeks the tears were\nalready dried, a faint but happy smile played round her lips--childlike,\nindeed, she was sensible only of the joy of the present hour: she was\nreconciled to Glaucus: he had forgiven her--she was beside him--he\nplayed caressingly with her silken hair--his breath fanned her\ncheek--Ione, the cruel Ione, was not by--none other demanded, divided,\nhis care.  Yes, she was happy and forgetful; it was one of the few\nmoments in her brief and troubled life that it was sweet to treasure, to\nrecall. As the butterfly, allured by the winter sun, basks for a little\nin the sudden light, ere yet the wind awakes and the frost comes on,\nwhich shall blast it before the eve--she rested beneath a beam, which,\nby contrast with the wonted skies, was not chilling; and the instinct\nwhich should have warned her of its briefness, bade her only gladden in\nits smile.\n\n'Thou hast beautiful locks,' said Glaucus.  'They were once, I ween\nwell, a mother's delight.'\n\nNydia sighed; it would seem that she had not been born a slave; but she\never shunned the mention of her parentage, and, whether obscure or\nnoble, certain it is that her birth was never known by her benefactors,\nnor by any one in those distant shores, even to the last.  The child of\nsorrow and of mystery, she came and went as some bird that enters our\nchamber for a moment; we see it flutter for a while before us, we know\nnot whence it flew or to what region it escapes.\n\nNydia sighed, and after a short pause, without answering the remark,\nsaid: 'But do I weave too many roses in my wreath, Glaucus?  They tell\nme it is thy favorite flower.'\n\n'And ever favored, my Nydia, be it by those who have the soul of poetry:\nit is the flower of love, of festival; it is also the flower we dedicate\nto silence and to death; it blooms on our brows in life, while life be\nworth the having; it is scattered above our sepulchre when we are no\nmore.'\n\n'Ah! would,' said Nydia, 'instead of this perishable wreath, that I\ncould take thy web from the hand of the Fates, and insert the roses\nthere!'\n\n'Pretty one! thy wish is worthy of a voice so attuned to song; it is\nuttered in the spirit of song; and, whatever my doom, I thank thee.'\n\n'Whatever thy doom! is it not already destined to all things bright and\nfair?  My wish was vain.  The Fates will be as tender to thee as I\nshould.'\n\n'It might not be so, Nydia, were it not for love!  While youth lasts, I\nmay forget my country for a while.  But what Athenian, in his graver\nmanhood, can think of Athens as she was, and be contented that he is\nhappy, while she is fallen?--fallen, and for ever?'\n\n'And why for ever?'\n\n'As ashes cannot be rekindled--as love once dead can never revive, so\nfreedom departed from a people is never regained.  But talk we not of\nthese matters unsuited to thee.'\n\n'To me, oh! thou errest.  I, too, have my sighs for Greece; my cradle\nwas rocked at the foot of Olympus; the gods have left the mountain, but\ntheir traces may be seen--seen in the hearts of their worshippers, seen\nin the beauty of their clime: they tell me it is beautiful, and I have\nfelt its airs, to which even these are harsh--its sun, to which these\nskies are chill.  Oh! talk to me of Greece! Poor fool that I am, I can\ncomprehend thee! and methinks, had I yet lingered on those shores, had I\nbeen a Grecian maid whose happy fate it was to love and to be loved, I\nmyself could have armed my lover for another Marathon, a new Plataea.\nYes, the hand that now weaves the roses should have woven thee the olive\ncrown!'\n\n'If such a day could come!' said Glaucus, catching the enthusiasm of the\nblind Thessalian, and half rising.--'But no! the sun has set, and the\nnight only bids us be forgetful--and in forgetfulness be gay--weave\nstill the roses!'\n\nBut it was with a melancholy tone of forced gaiety that the Athenian\nuttered the last words: and sinking into a gloomy reverie, he was only\nwakened from it, a few minutes afterwards, by the voice of Nydia, as she\nsang in a low tone the following words, which he had once taught her:--\n\n\n           THE APOLOGY FOR PLEASURE\n\n                    I\n\n           Who will assume the bays\n              That the hero wore?\n           Wreaths on the Tomb of Days\n              Gone evermore!\n           Who shall disturb the brave,\n           Or one leaf on their holy grave?\n           The laurel is vowed to them,\n           Leave the bay on its sacred stem!\n              But this, the rose, the fading rose,\n              Alike for slave and freeman grows.\n\n                    II\n\n           If Memory sit beside the dead\n              With tombs her only treasure;\n           If Hope is lost and Freedom fled,\n              The more excuse for Pleasure.\n           Come, weave the wreath, the roses weave,\n              The rose at least is ours:\n           To feeble hearts our fathers leave,\n              In pitying scorn, the flowers!\n\n\n                    III\n\n             On the summit, worn and hoary,\n           Of Phyle's solemn hill,\n           The tramp of the brave is still!\n           And still in the saddening Mart,\n           The pulse of that mighty heart,\n              Whose very blood was glory!\n           Glaucopis forsakes her own,\n              The angry gods forget us;\n           But yet, the blue streams along,\n           Walk the feet of the silver Song;\n           And the night-bird wakes the moon;\n           And the bees in the blushing noon\n              Haunt the heart of the old Hymettus.\n           We are fallen, but not forlorn,\n              If something is left to cherish;\n           As Love was the earliest born,\n              So Love is the last to perish.\n\n                    IV\n\n           Wreathe then the roses, wreathe\n              The BEAUTIFUL still is ours,\n           While the stream shall flow and the sky shall glow,\n           The BEAUTIFUL still is ours!\n           Whatever is fair, or soft, or bright,\n           In the lap of day or the arms of night,\n           Whispers our soul of Greece--of Greece,\n           And hushes our care with a voice of peace.\n              Wreathe then the roses, wreathe!\n              They tell me of earlier hours;\n           And I hear the heart of my Country breathe\n              From the lips of the Stranger's flowers.\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nNYDIA ENCOUNTERS JULIA.  INTERVIEW OF THE HEATHEN SISTER AND CONVERTED\nBROTHER.  AN ATHENIAN'S NOTION OF CHRISTIANITY.\n\n'WHAT happiness to Ione! what bliss to be ever by the side of Glaucus,\nto hear his voice!--And she too can see him!'\n\nSuch was the soliloquy of the blind girl, as she walked alone and at\ntwilight to the house of her new mistress, whither Glaucus had already\npreceded her.  Suddenly she was interrupted in her fond thoughts by a\nfemale voice.\n\n'Blind flower-girl, whither goest thou?  There is no pannier under thine\narm; hast thou sold all thy flowers?'\n\nThe person thus accosting Nydia was a lady of a handsome but a bold and\nunmaidenly countenance: it was Julia, the daughter of Diomed. Her veil\nwas half raised as she spoke; she was accompanied by Diomed himself, and\nby a slave carrying a lantern before them--the merchant and his daughter\nwere returning home from a supper at one of their neighbors'.\n\n'Dost thou not remember my voice?' continued Julia.  'I am the daughter\nof Diomed the wealthy.'\n\n'Ah! forgive me; yes, I recall the tones of your voice.  No, noble\nJulia, I have no flowers to sell.'\n\n'I heard that thou wert purchased by the beautiful Greek Glaucus; is\nthat true, pretty slave?' asked Julia.\n\n'I serve the Neapolitan, Ione,' replied Nydia, evasively.\n\n'Ah! and it is true, then...'\n\n'Come, come!' interrupted Diomed, with his cloak up to his mouth, 'the\nnight grows cold; I cannot stay here while you prate to that blind girl:\ncome, let her follow you home, if you wish to speak to her.'\n\n'Do, child,' said Julia, with the air of one not accustomed to be\nrefused; 'I have much to ask of thee: come.'\n\n'I cannot this night, it grows late,' answered Nydia.  'I must be at\nhome; I am not free, noble Julia.'\n\n'What, the meek Ione will chide thee?--Ay, I doubt not she is a second\nThalestris.  But come, then, to-morrow: do--remember I have been thy\nfriend of old.'\n\n'I will obey thy wishes,' answered Nydia; and Diomed again impatiently\nsummoned his daughter: she was obliged to proceed, with the main\nquestion she had desired to put to Nydia unasked.\n\nMeanwhile we return to Ione.  The interval of time that had elapsed that\nday between the first and second visit of Glaucus had not been too gaily\nspent: she had received a visit from her brother.  Since the night he\nhad assisted in saving her from the Egyptian, she had not before seen\nhim.\n\nOccupied with his own thoughts--thoughts of so serious and intense a\nnature--the young priest had thought little of his sister; in truth,\nmen, perhaps of that fervent order of mind which is ever aspiring above\nearth, are but little prone to the earthlier affections; and it had been\nlong since Apaecides had sought those soft and friendly interchanges of\nthought, those sweet confidences, which in his earlier youth had bound\nhim to Ione, and which are so natural to that endearing connection which\nexisted between them.\n\nIone, however, had not ceased to regret his estrangement: she attributed\nit, at present, to the engrossing duties of his severe fraternity.  And\noften, amidst all her bright hopes, and her new attachment to her\nbetrothed--often, when she thought of her brother's brow prematurely\nfurrowed, his unsmiling lip, and bended frame, she sighed to think that\nthe service of the gods could throw so deep a shadow over that earth\nwhich the gods created.\n\nBut this day when he visited her there was a strange calmness on his\nfeatures, a more quiet and self-possessed expression in his sunken eyes,\nthan she had marked for years.  This apparent improvement was but\nmomentary--it was a false calm, which the least breeze could ruffle.\n\n'May the gods bless thee, my brother!' said she, embracing him.\n\n'The gods!  Speak not thus vaguely; perchance there is but one God!'\n\n'My brother!'\n\n'What if the sublime faith of the Nazarene be true?  What if God be a\nmonarch--One--Invisible--Alone?  What if these numerous, countless\ndeities, whose altars fill the earth, be but evil demons, seeking to\nwean us from the true creed?  This may be the case, Ione!'\n\n'Alas! can we believe it? or if we believed, would it not be a\nmelancholy faith,' answered the Neapolitan.  'What! all this beautiful\nworld made only human!--mountain disenchanted of its Oread--the waters\nof their Nymph--that beautiful prodigality of faith, which makes\neverything divine, consecrating the meanest flowers, bearing celestial\nwhispers in the faintest breeze--wouldst thou deny this, and make the\nearth mere dust and clay?  No, Apaecides: all that is brightest in our\nhearts is that very credulity which peoples the universe with gods.'\n\nIone answered as a believer in the poesy of the old mythology would\nanswer. We may judge by that reply how obstinate and hard the contest\nwhich Christianity had to endure among the heathens.  The Graceful\nSuperstition was never silent; every, the most household, action of\ntheir lives was entwined with it--it was a portion of life itself, as\nthe flowers are a part of the thyrsus.  At every incident they recurred\nto a god, every cup of wine was prefaced by a libation; the very\ngarlands on their thresholds were dedicated to some divinity; their\nancestors themselves, made holy, presided as Lares over their hearth and\nhall.  So abundant was belief with them, that in their own climes, at\nthis hour, idolatry has never thoroughly been outrooted: it changes but\nits objects of worship; it appeals to innumerable saints where once it\nresorted to divinities; and it pours its crowds, in listening reverence,\nto oracles at the shrines of St. Januarius or St. Stephen, instead of to\nthose of Isis or Apollo.\n\nBut these superstitions were not to the early Christians the object of\ncontempt so much as of horror.  They did not believe, with the quiet\nscepticism of the heathen philosopher, that the gods were inventions of\nthe priests; nor even, with the vulgar, that, according to the dim light\nof history, they had been mortals like themselves.  They imagined the\nheathen divinities to be evil spirits--they transplanted to Italy and to\nGreece the gloomy demons of India and the East; and in Jupiter or in\nMars they shuddered at the representative of Moloch or of Satan.\n\nApaecides had not yet adopted formally the Christian faith, but he was\nalready on the brink of it.  He already participated the doctrines of\nOlinthus--he already imagined that the lively imaginations of the\nheathen were the suggestions of the arch-enemy of mankind.  The innocent\nand natural answer of Ione made him shudder.  He hastened to reply\nvehemently, and yet so confusedly, that Ione feared for his reason more\nthan she dreaded his violence.\n\n'Ah, my brother!' said she, 'these hard duties of thine have shattered\nthy very sense.  Come to me, Apaecides, my brother, my own brother; give\nme thy hand, let me wipe the dew from thy brow--chide me not now, I\nunderstand thee not; think only that Ione could not offend thee!'\n\n'Ione,' said Apaecides, drawing her towards him, and regarding her\ntenderly, 'can I think that this beautiful form, this kind heart, may be\ndestined to an eternity of torment?'\n\n'Dii meliora! the gods forbid!' said Ione, in the customary form of\nwords by which her contemporaries thought an omen might be averted.\n\nThe words, and still more the superstition they implied, wounded the ear\nof Apaecides.  He rose, muttering to himself, turned from the chamber,\nthen, stopping, half way, gazed wistfully on Ione, and extended his\narms.\n\nIone flew to them in joy; he kissed her earnestly, and then he said:\n\n'Farewell, my sister! when we next meet, thou mayst be to me as nothing;\ntake thou, then, this embrace--full yet of all the tender reminiscences\nof childhood, when faith and hope, creeds, customs, interests, objects,\nwere the same to us.  Now, the tie is to be broken!'\n\nWith these strange words he left the house.\n\nThe great and severest trial of the primitive Christians was indeed\nthis; their conversion separated them from their dearest bonds. They\ncould not associate with beings whose commonest actions, whose commonest\nforms of speech, were impregnated with idolatry.  They shuddered at the\nblessing of love, to their ears it was uttered in a demon's name.  This,\ntheir misfortune, was their strength; if it divided them from the rest\nof the world, it was to unite them proportionally to each other.  They\nwere men of iron who wrought forth the Word of God, and verily the bonds\nthat bound them were of iron also!\n\nGlaucus found Ione in tears; he had already assumed the sweet privilege\nto console.  He drew from her a recital of her interview with her\nbrother; but in her confused account of language, itself so confused to\none not prepared for it, he was equally at a loss with Ione to conceive\nthe intentions or the meaning of Apaecides.\n\n'Hast thou ever heard much,' asked she, 'of this new sect of the\nNazarenes, of which my brother spoke?'\n\n'I have often heard enough of the votaries,' returned Glaucus, 'but of\ntheir exact tenets know I naught, save that in their doctrine there\nseemeth something preternaturally chilling and morose.  They live apart\nfrom their kind; they affect to be shocked even at our simple uses of\ngarlands; they have no sympathies with the cheerful amusements of life;\nthey utter awful threats of the coming destruction of the world; they\nappear, in one word, to have brought their unsmiling and gloomy creed\nout of the cave of Trophonius. Yet,' continued Glaucus, after a slight\npause, 'they have not wanted men of great power and genius, nor\nconverts, even among the Areopagites of Athens. Well do I remember to\nhave heard my father speak of one strange guest at Athens, many years\nago; methinks his name was PAUL.  My father was amongst a mighty crowd\nthat gathered on one of our immemorial hills to hear this sage of the\nEast expound: through the wide throng there rang not a single\nmurmur!--the jest and the roar, with which our native orators are\nreceived, were hushed for him--and when on the loftiest summit of that\nhill, raised above the breathless crowd below, stood this mysterious\nvisitor, his mien and his countenance awed every heart, even before a\nsound left his lips.  He was a man, I have heard my father say, of no\ntall stature, but of noble and impressive mien; his robes were dark and\nample; the declining sun, for it was evening, shone aslant upon his form\nas it rose aloft, motionless, and commanding; his countenance was much\nworn and marked, as of one who had braved alike misfortune and the\nsternest vicissitude of many climes; but his eyes were bright with an\nalmost unearthly fire; and when he raised his arm to speak, it was with\nthe majesty of a man into whom the Spirit of a God hath rushed!\n\n'\"Men of Athens!\" he is reported to have said, \"I find amongst ye an\naltar with this inscription:\n\n              TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.\n\n  Ye worship in ignorance the same Deity I serve.\n    To you unknown till now, to you be it now revealed.\"\n\n'Then declared that solemn man how this great Maker of all things, who\nhad appointed unto man his several tribes and his various homes--the\nLord of earth and the universal heaven, dwelt not in temples made with\nhands; that His presence, His spirit, were in the air we breathed--our\nlife and our being were with Him.  \"Think you,\" he cried, \"that the\nInvisible is like your statues of gold and marble?  Think you that He\nneedeth sacrifice from you: He who made heaven and earth?\" Then spoke he\nof fearful and coming times, of the end of the world, of a second rising\nof the dead, whereof an assurance had been given to man in the\nresurrection of the mighty Being whose religion he came to preach.\n\n'When he thus spoke, the long-pent murmur went forth, and the\nphilosophers that were mingled with the people, muttered their sage\ncontempt; there might you have seen the chilling frown of the Stoic, and\nthe Cynic's sneer; and the Epicurean, who believeth not even in our own\nElysium, muttered a pleasant jest, and swept laughing through the crowd:\nbut the deep heart of the people was touched and thrilled; and they\ntrembled, though they knew not why, for verily the stranger had the\nvoice and majesty of a man to whom \"The Unknown God\" had committed the\npreaching of His faith.'\n\nIone listened with wrapt attention, and the serious and earnest manner\nof the narrator betrayed the impression that he himself had received\nfrom one who had been amongst the audience that on the hill of the\nheathen Mars had heard the first tidings of the word of Christ!\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nTHE PORTER.  THE GIRL.  AND THE GLADIATOR.\n\nTHE door of Diomed's house stood open, and Medon, the old slave, sat at\nthe bottom of the steps by which you ascended to the mansion. That\nluxurious mansion of the rich merchant of Pompeii is still to be seen\njust without the gates of the city, at the commencement of the Street of\nTombs; it was a gay neighborhood, despite the dead.  On the opposite\nside, but at some yards nearer the gate, was a spacious hostelry, at\nwhich those brought by business or by pleasure to Pompeii often stopped\nto refresh themselves.  In the space before the entrance of the inn now\nstood wagons, and carts, and chariots, some just arrived, some just\nquitting, in all the bustle of an animated and popular resort of public\nentertainment.  Before the door, some farmers, seated on a bench by a\nsmall circular table, were talking over their morning cups, on the\naffairs of their calling.  On the side of the door itself was painted\ngaily and freshly the eternal sign of the chequers. By the roof of the\ninn stretched a terrace, on which some females, wives of the farmers\nabove mentioned, were, some seated, some leaning over the railing, and\nconversing with their friends below. In a deep recess, at a little\ndistance, was a covered seat, in which some two or three poorer\ntravellers were resting themselves, and shaking the dust from their\ngarments.  On the other side stretched a wide space, originally the\nburial-ground of a more ancient race than the present denizens of\nPompeii, and now converted into the Ustrinum, or place for the burning\nof the dead.  Above this rose the terraces of a gay villa, half hid by\ntrees.  The tombs themselves, with their graceful and varied shapes, the\nflowers and the foliage that surrounded them, made no melancholy feature\nin the prospect.  Hard by the gate of the city, in a small niche, stood\nthe still form of the well-disciplined Roman sentry, the sun shining\nbrightly on his polished crest, and the lance on which he leaned.  The\ngate itself was divided into three arches, the centre one for vehicles,\nthe others for the foot-passengers; and on either side rose the massive\nwalls which girt the city, composed, patched, repaired at a thousand\ndifferent epochs, according as war, time, or the earthquake had\nshattered that vain protection.  At frequent intervals rose square\ntowers, whose summits broke in picturesque rudeness the regular line of\nthe wall, and contrasted well with the modern buildings gleaming whitely\nby.\n\nThe curving road, which in that direction leads from Pompeii to\nHerculaneum, wound out of sight amidst hanging vines, above which\nfrowned the sullen majesty of Vesuvius.\n\n'Hast thou heard the news, old Medon?' said a young woman, with a\npitcher in her hand, as she paused by Diomed's door to gossip a moment\nwith the slave, ere she repaired to the neighboring inn to fill the\nvessel, and coquet with the travellers.\n\n'The news! what news?' said the slave, raising his eyes moodily from the\nground.\n\n'Why, there passed through the gate this morning, no doubt ere thou wert\nwell awake, such a visitor to Pompeii!'\n\n'Ay,' said the slave, indifferently.\n\n'Yes, a present from the noble Pomponianus.'\n\n'A present!  I thought thou saidst a visitor?'\n\n'It is both visitor and present.  Know, O dull and stupid! that it is a\nmost beautiful young tiger, for our approaching games in the\namphitheatre.  Hear you that, Medon?  Oh, what pleasure!  I declare I\nshall not sleep a wink till I see it; they say it has such a roar!'\n\n'Poor fool!' said Medon, sadly and cynically.\n\n'Fool me no fool, old churl!  It is a pretty thing, a tiger, especially\nif we could but find somebody for him to eat.  We have now a lion and a\ntiger; only consider that, Medon! and for want of two good criminals\nperhaps we shall be forced to see them eat each other.  By-the-by, your\nson is a gladiator, a handsome man and a strong, can you not persuade\nhim to fight the tiger?  Do now, you would oblige me mightily; nay, you\nwould be a benefactor to the whole town.'\n\n'Vah! vah!' said the slave, with great asperity; 'think of thine own\ndanger ere thou thus pratest of my poor boy's death.'\n\n'My own danger!' said the girl, frightened and looking hastily\naround--'Avert the omen! let thy words fall on thine own head!' And the\ngirl, as she spoke, touched a talisman suspended round her neck. '\"Thine\nown danger!\" what danger threatens me?'\n\n'Had the earthquake but a few nights since no warning?' said Medon.\n'Has it not a voice?  Did it not say to us all, \"Prepare for death; the\nend of all things is at hand?\"'\n\n'Bah, stuff!' said the young woman, settling the folds of her tunic.\n'Now thou talkest as they say the Nazarenes talked--methinks thou art\none of them.  Well, I can prate with thee, grey croaker, no more: thou\ngrowest worse and worse--Vale! O Hercules, send us a man for the\nlion--and another for the tiger!'\n\n\n            Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show,\n            With a forest of faces in every row!\n            Lo, the swordsmen, bold as the son of Alcmena,\n            Sweep, side by side, o'er the hushed arena;\n            Talk while you may--you will hold your breath\n            When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death.\n            Tramp, tramp, how gaily they go!\n            Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show!\n\nChanting in a silver and clear voice this feminine ditty, and holding up\nher tunic from the dusty road, the young woman stepped lightly across to\nthe crowded hostelry.\n\n'My poor son!' said the slave, half aloud, 'is it for things like this\nthou art to be butchered?  Oh! faith of Christ, I could worship thee in\nall sincerity, were it but for the horror which thou inspirest for these\nbloody lists.'\n\nThe old man's head sank dejectedly on his breast.  He remained silent\nand absorbed, but every now and then with the corner of his sleeve he\nwiped his eyes.  His heart was with his son; he did not see the figure\nthat now approached from the gate with a quick step, and a somewhat\nfierce and reckless gait and carriage.  He did not lift his eyes till\nthe figure paused opposite the place where he sat, and with a soft voice\naddressed him by the name of:\n\n'Father!'\n\n'My boy! my Lydon! is it indeed thou?' said the old man, joyfully. 'Ah,\nthou wert present to my thoughts.'\n\n'I am glad to hear it, my father,' said the gladiator, respectfully\ntouching the knees and beard of the slave; 'and soon may I be always\npresent with thee, not in thought only.'\n\n'Yes, my son--but not in this world,' replied the slave, mournfully.\n\n'Talk not thus, O my sire! look cheerfully, for I feel so--I am sure\nthat I shall win the day; and then, the gold I gain buys thy freedom.\nOh! my father, it was but a few days since that I was taunted, by one,\ntoo, whom I would gladly have undeceived, for he is more generous than\nthe rest of his equals.  He is not Roman--he is of Athens--by him I was\ntaunted with the lust of gain--when I demanded what sum was the prize of\nvictory.  Alas! he little knew the soul of Lydon!'\n\n'My boy! my boy!' said the old slave, as, slowly ascending the steps, he\nconducted his son to his own little chamber, communicating with the\nentrance hall (which in this villa was the peristyle, not the\natrium)--you may see it now; it is the third door to the right on\nentering.  (The first door conducts to the staircase; the second is but\na false recess, in which there stood a statue of bronze.) 'Generous,\naffectionate, pious as are thy motives,' said Medon, when they were thus\nsecured from observation, 'thy deed itself is guilt: thou art to risk\nthy blood for thy father's freedom--that might be forgiven; but the\nprize of victory is the blood of another.  Oh, that is a deadly sin; no\nobject can purify it.  Forbear! forbear! rather would I be a slave for\never than purchase liberty on such terms!'\n\n'Hush, my father!' replied Lydon, somewhat impatiently; 'thou hast\npicked up in this new creed of thine, of which I pray thee not to speak\nto me, for the gods that gave me strength denied me wisdom, and I\nunderstand not one word of what thou often preachest to me--thou hast\npicked up, I say, in this new creed, some singular fantasies of right\nand wrong.  Pardon me if I offend thee: but reflect!  Against whom shall\nI contend?  Oh! couldst thou know those wretches with whom, for thy\nsake, I assort, thou wouldst think I purified earth by removing one of\nthem.  Beasts, whose very lips drop blood; things, all savage,\nunprincipled in their very courage: ferocious, heartless, senseless; no\ntie of life can bind them: they know not fear, it is true--but neither\nknow they gratitude, nor charity, nor love; they are made but for their\nown career, to slaughter without pity, to die without dread!  Can thy\ngods, whosoever they be, look with wrath on a conflict with such as\nthese, and in such a cause?  Oh, My father, wherever the powers above\ngaze down on earth, they behold no duty so sacred, so sanctifying, as\nthe sacrifice offered to an aged parent by the piety of a grateful son!'\n\nThe poor old slave, himself deprived of the lights of knowledge, and\nonly late a convert to the Christian faith, knew not with what arguments\nto enlighten an ignorance at once so dark, and yet so beautiful in its\nerror. His first impulse was to throw himself on his son's breast--his\nnext to start away to wring his hands; and in the attempt to reprove,\nhis broken voice lost itself in weeping.\n\n'And if,' resumed Lydon--'if thy Deity (methinks thou wilt own but one?)\nbe indeed that benevolent and pitying Power which thou assertest Him to\nbe, He will know also that thy very faith in Him first confirmed me in\nthat determination thou blamest.'\n\n'How! what mean you?' said the slave.\n\n'Why, thou knowest that I, sold in my childhood as a slave, was set free\nat Rome by the will of my master, whom I had been fortunate enough to\nplease. I hastened to Pompeii to see thee--I found thee already aged and\ninfirm, under the yoke of a capricious and pampered lord--thou hadst\nlately adopted this new faith, and its adoption made thy slavery doubly\npainful to thee; it took away all the softening charm of custom, which\nreconciles us so often to the worst.  Didst thou not complain to me that\nthou wert compelled to offices that were not odious to thee as a slave,\nbut guilty as a Nazarene? Didst thou not tell me that thy soul shook\nwith remorse when thou wert compelled to place even a crumb of cake\nbefore the Lares that watch over yon impluvium? that thy soul was torn\nby a perpetual struggle?  Didst thou not tell me that even by pouring\nwine before the threshold, and calling on the name of some Grecian\ndeity, thou didst fear thou wert incurring penalties worse than those of\nTantalus, an eternity of tortures more terrible than those of the\nTartarian fields?  Didst thou not tell me this?  I wondered, I could not\ncomprehend; nor, by Hercules! can I now: but I was thy son, and my sole\ntask was to compassionate and relieve.  Could I hear thy groans, could I\nwitness thy mysterious horrors, thy constant anguish, and remain\ninactive? No! by the immortal gods! the thought struck me like light\nfrom Olympus!  I had no money, but I had strength and youth--these were\nthy gifts--I could sell these in my turn for thee!  I learned the amount\nof thy ransom--I learned that the usual prize of a victorious gladiator\nwould doubly pay it. I became a gladiator--I linked myself with those\naccursed men, scorning, loathing, while I joined--I acquired their\nskill--blessed be the lesson!--it shall teach me to free my father!'\n\n'Oh, that thou couldst hear Olinthus!' sighed the old man, more and more\naffected by the virtue of his son, but not less strongly convinced of\nthe criminality of his purpose.\n\n'I will hear the whole world talk if thou wilt,' answered the gladiator,\ngaily; 'but not till thou art a slave no more.  Beneath thy own roof, my\nfather, thou shalt puzzle this dull brain all day long, ay, and all\nnight too, if it give thee pleasure.  Oh, such a spot as I have chalked\nout for thee!--it is one of the nine hundred and ninety-nine shops of\nold Julia Felix, in the sunny part of the city, where thou mayst bask\nbefore the door in the day--and I will sell the oil and the wine for\nthee, my father--and then, please Venus (or if it does not please her,\nsince thou lovest not her name, it is all one to Lydon)--then, I say,\nperhaps thou mayst have a daughter, too, to tend thy grey hairs, and\nhear shrill voices at thy knee, that shall call thee \"Lydon's father!\"\nAh! we shall be so happy--the prize can purchase all.  Cheer thee! cheer\nup, my sire!--And now I must away--day wears--the lanista waits me.\nCome! thy blessing!'\n\nAs Lydon thus spoke, he had already quitted the dark chamber of his\nfather; and speaking eagerly, though in a whispered tone, they now stood\nat the same place in which we introduced the porter at his post.\n\n'O bless thee! bless thee, my brave boy!' said Medon, fervently; 'and\nmay the great Power that reads all hearts see the nobleness of thine,\nand forgive its error!'\n\nThe tall shape of the gladiator passed swiftly down the path; the eyes\nof the slave followed its light but stately steps, till the last glimpse\nwas gone; and then, sinking once more on his seat, his eyes again\nfastened themselves on the ground.  His form, mute and unmoving, as a\nthing of stone. His heart!--who, in our happier age, can even imagine\nits struggles--its commotion?\n\n'May I enter?' said a sweet voice.  'Is thy mistress Julia within?'\n\nThe slave mechanically motioned to the visitor to enter, but she who\naddressed him could not see the gesture--she repeated her question\ntimidly, but in a louder voice.\n\n'Have I not told thee!' said the slave, peevishly: 'enter.'\n\n'Thanks,' said the speaker, plaintively; and the slave, roused by the\ntone, looked up, and recognized the blind flower-girl.  Sorrow can\nsympathize with affliction--he raised himself, and guided her steps to\nthe head of the adjacent staircase (by which you descended to Julia's\napartment), where, summoning a female slave, he consigned to her the\ncharge of the blind girl.\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nTHE DRESSING-ROOM OF A POMPEIAN BEAUTY. IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN\nJULIA AND NYDIA.\n\nTHE elegant Julia sat in her chamber, with her slaves around her--like\nthe cubiculum which adjoined it, the room was small, but much larger\nthan the usual apartments appropriated to sleep, which were so\ndiminutive, that few who have not seen the bed-chambers, even in the\ngayest mansions, can form any notion of the petty pigeon-holes in which\nthe citizens of Pompeii evidently thought it desirable to pass the\nnight.  But, in fact, 'bed' with the ancients was not that grave,\nserious, and important part of domestic mysteries which it is with us.\nThe couch itself was more like a very narrow and small sofa, light\nenough to be transported easily, and by the occupant himself, from place\nto place; and it was, no doubt, constantly shifted from chamber to\nchamber, according to the caprice of the inmate, or the changes of the\nseason; for that side of the house which was crowded in one month,\nmight, perhaps, be carefully avoided in the next.  There was also among\nthe Italians of that period a singular and fastidious apprehension of\ntoo much daylight; their darkened chambers, which first appear to us the\nresult of a negligent architecture, were the effect of the most\nelaborate study. In their porticoes and gardens they courted the sun\nwhenever it so pleased their luxurious tastes.  In the interior of their\nhouses they sought rather the coolness and the shade.\n\nJulia's apartment at that season was in the lower part of the house,\nimmediately beneath the state rooms above, and looking upon the garden,\nwith which it was on a level.  The wide door, which was glazed, alone\nadmitted the morning rays: yet her eye, accustomed to a certain\ndarkness, was sufficiently acute to perceive exactly what colors were\nthe most becoming--what shade of the delicate rouge gave the brightest\nbeam to her dark glance, and the most youthful freshness to her cheek.\n\nOn the table, before which she sat, was a small and circular mirror of\nthe most polished steel: round which, in precise order, were ranged the\ncosmetics and the unguents--the perfumes and the paints--the jewels and\ncombs--the ribands and the gold pins, which were destined to add to the\nnatural attractions of beauty the assistance of art and the capricious\nallurements of fashion.  Through the dimness of the room glowed brightly\nthe vivid and various colourings of the wall, in all the dazzling\nfrescoes of Pompeian taste.  Before the dressing-table, and under the\nfeet of Julia, was spread a carpet, woven from the looms of the East.\nNear at hand, on another table, was a silver basin and ewer; an\nextinguished lamp, of most exquisite workmanship, in which the artist\nhad represented a Cupid reposing under the spreading branches of a\nmyrtle-tree; and a small roll of papyrus, containing the softest elegies\nof Tibullus.  Before the door, which communicated with the cubiculum,\nhung a curtain richly broidered with gold flowers.  Such was the\ndressing-room of a beauty eighteen centuries ago.\n\nThe fair Julia leaned indolently back on her seat, while the ornatrix\n(i.e. hairdresser) slowly piled, one above the other, a mass of small\ncurls, dexterously weaving the false with the true, and carrying the\nwhole fabric to a height that seemed to place the head rather at the\ncentre than the summit of the human form.\n\nHer tunic, of a deep amber, which well set off her dark hair and\nsomewhat embrowned complexion, swept in ample folds to her feet, which\nwere cased in slippers, fastened round the slender ankle by white\nthongs; while a profusion of pearls were embroidered in the slipper\nitself, which was of purple, and turned slightly upward, as do the\nTurkish slippers at this day. An old slave, skilled by long experience\nin all the arcana of the toilet, stood beside the hairdresser, with the\nbroad and studded girdle of her mistress over her arm, and giving, from\ntime to time (mingled with judicious flattery to the lady herself),\ninstructions to the mason of the ascending pile.\n\n'Put that pin rather more to the right--lower--stupid one!  Do you not\nobserve how even those beautiful eyebrows are?--One would think you were\ndressing Corinna, whose face is all of one side.  Now put in the\nflowers--what, fool!--not that dull pink--you are not suiting colors to\nthe dim cheek of Chloris: it must be the brightest flowers that can\nalone suit the cheek of the young Julia.'\n\n'Gently!' said the lady, stamping her small foot violently: 'you pull my\nhair as if you were plucking up a weed!'\n\n'Dull thing!' continued the directress of the ceremony.  'Do you not\nknow how delicate is your mistress?--you are not dressing the coarse\nhorsehair of the widow Fulvia.  Now, then, the riband--that's right.\nFair Julia, look in the mirror; saw you ever anything so lovely as\nyourself?'\n\nWhen, after innumerable comments, difficulties, and delays, the\nintricate tower was at length completed, the next preparation was that\nof giving to the eyes the soft languish, produced by a dark powder\napplied to the lids and brows; a small patch cut in the form of a\ncrescent, skillfully placed by the rosy lips, attracted attention to\ntheir dimples, and to the teeth, to which already every art had been\napplied in order to heighten the dazzle of their natural whiteness.\n\nTo another slave, hitherto idle, was now consigned the charge of\narranging the jewels--the ear-rings of pearl (two to each ear)--the\nmassive bracelets of gold--the chain formed of rings of the same metal,\nto which a talisman cut in crystals was attached--the graceful buckle on\nthe left shoulder, in which was set an exquisite cameo of Psyche--the\ngirdle of purple riband, richly wrought with threads of gold, and\nclasped by interlacing serpents--and lastly, the various rings, fitted\nto every joint of the white and slender fingers.  The toilet was now\narranged according to the last mode of Rome.  The fair Julia regarded\nherself with a last gaze of complacent vanity, and reclining again upon\nher seat, she bade the youngest of her slaves, in a listless tone, read\nto her the enamoured couplets of Tibullus. This lecture was still\nproceeding, when a female slave admitted Nydia into the presence of the\nlady of the place.\n\n'Salve, Julia!' said the flower-girl, arresting her steps within a few\npaces from the spot where Julia sat, and crossing her arms upon her\nbreast.  'I have obeyed your commands.'\n\n'You have done well, flower-girl,' answered the lady.  'Approach--you\nmay take a seat.'\n\nOne of the slaves placed a stool by Julia, and Nydia seated herself.\n\nJulia looked hard at the Thessalian for some moments in rather an\nembarrassed silence.  She then motioned her attendants to withdraw, and\nto close the door.  When they were alone, she said, looking mechanically\nfrom Nydia, and forgetful that she was with one who could not observe\nher countenance:\n\n'You serve the Neapolitan, Ione?'\n\n'I am with her at present,' answered Nydia.\n\n'Is she as handsome as they say?'\n\n'I know not,' replied Nydia.  'How can I judge?'\n\n'Ah! I should have remembered.  But thou hast ears, if not eyes.  Do thy\nfellow-slaves tell thee she is handsome?  Slaves talking with one\nanother forget to flatter even their mistress.'\n\n'They tell me that she is beautiful.'\n\n'Hem!--say they that she is tall?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Why, so am I.  Dark haired?'\n\n'I have heard so.'\n\n'So am I.  And doth Glaucus visit her much?'\n\n'Daily' returned Nydia, with a half-suppressed sigh.\n\n'Daily, indeed!  Does he find her handsome?'\n\n'I should think so, since they are so soon to be wedded.'\n\n'Wedded!' cried Julia, turning pale even through the false roses on her\ncheek, and starting from her couch.  Nydia did not, of course, perceive\nthe emotion she had caused.  Julia remained a long time silent; but her\nheaving breast and flashing eyes would have betrayed, to one who could\nhave seen, the wound her vanity had sustained.\n\n'They tell me thou art a Thessalian,' said she, at last breaking\nsilence.\n\n'And truly!'\n\n'Thessaly is the land of magic and of witches, of talismans and of\nlove-philtres,' said Julia.\n\n'It has ever been celebrated for its sorcerers,' returned Nydia,\ntimidly.\n\n'Knowest thou, then, blind Thessalian, of any love-charms?'\n\n'I!' said the flower-girl, coloring; 'I! how should I?  No, assuredly\nnot!'\n\n'The worse for thee; I could have given thee gold enough to have\npurchased thy freedom hadst thou been more wise.'\n\n'But what,' asked Nydia, 'can induce the beautiful and wealthy Julia to\nask that question of her servant?  Has she not money, and youth, and\nloveliness? Are they not love-charms enough to dispense with magic?'\n\n'To all but one person in the world,' answered Julia, haughtily: 'but\nmethinks thy blindness is infectious; and...  But no matter.'\n\n'And that one person?' said Nydia, eagerly.\n\n'Is not Glaucus,' replied Julia, with the customary deceit of her sex.\n'Glaucus--no!'\n\nNydia drew her breath more freely, and after a short pause Julia\nrecommenced.\n\n'But talking of Glaucus, and his attachment to this Neapolitan, reminded\nme of the influence of love-spells, which, for ought I know or care, she\nmay have exercised upon him.  Blind girl, I love, and--shall Julia live\nto say it?--am loved not in return!  This humbles--nay, not humbles--but\nit stings my pride.  I would see this ingrate at my feet--not in order\nthat I might raise, but that I might spurn him.  When they told me thou\nwert Thessalian, I imagined thy young mind might have learned the dark\nsecrets of thy clime.'\n\n'Alas! no,' murmured Nydia: 'would it had!'\n\n'Thanks, at least, for that kindly wish,' said Julia, unconscious of\nwhat was passing in the breast of the flower-girl.\n\n'But tell me--thou hearest the gossip of slaves, always prone to these\ndim beliefs; always ready to apply to sorcery for their own low\nloves--hast thou ever heard of any Eastern magician in this city, who\npossesses the art of which thou art ignorant?  No vain chiromancer, no\njuggler of the market-place, but some more potent and mighty magician of\nIndia or of Egypt?'\n\n'Of Egypt?--yes!' said Nydia, shuddering.  'What Pompeian has not heard\nof Arbaces?'\n\n'Arbaces! true,' replied Julia, grasping at the recollection. 'They\nsay he is a man above all the petty and false impostures of dull\npretenders--that he is versed in the learning of the stars, and the\nsecrets of the ancient Nox; why not in the mysteries of love?'\n\n'If there be one magician living whose art is above that of others, it\nis that dread man,' answered Nydia; and she felt her talisman while she\nspoke.\n\n'He is too wealthy to divine for money?' continued Julia, sneeringly.\n'Can I not visit him?'\n\n'It is an evil mansion for the young and the beautiful,' replied Nydia.\n'I have heard, too, that he languishes in...'\n\n'An evil mansion!' said Julia, catching only the first sentence. 'Why\nso?'\n\n'The orgies of his midnight leisure are impure and polluted--at least,\nso says rumor.'\n\n'By Ceres, by Pan, and by Cybele! thou dost but provoke my curiosity,\ninstead of exciting my fears,' returned the wayward and pampered\nPompeian. 'I will seek and question him of his lore.  If to these orgies\nlove be admitted--why the more likely that he knows its secrets!'\n\nNydia did not answer.\n\n'I will seek him this very day,' resumed Julia; 'nay, why not this very\nhour?'\n\n'At daylight, and in his present state, thou hast assuredly the less to\nfear,' answered Nydia, yielding to her own sudden and secret wish to\nlearn if the dark Egyptian were indeed possessed of those spells to\nrivet and attract love, of which the Thessalian had so often heard.\n\n'And who dare insult the rich daughter of Diomed?' said Julia,\nhaughtily. 'I will go.'\n\n'May I visit thee afterwards to learn the result?' asked Nydia,\nanxiously.\n\n'Kiss me for thy interest in Julia's honour,' answered the lady. 'Yes,\nassuredly.  This eve we sup abroad--come hither at the same hour\nto-morrow, and thou shalt know all: I may have to employ thee too; but\nenough for the present.  Stay, take this bracelet for the new thought\nthou hast inspired me with; remember, if thou servest Julia, she is\ngrateful and she is generous.'\n\n'I cannot take thy present,' said Nydia, putting aside the bracelet;\n'but young as I am, I can sympathize unbought with those who love--and\nlove in vain.'\n\n'Sayest thou so!' returned Julia.  'Thou speakest like a free woman--and\nthou shalt yet be free--farewell!'\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nJULIA SEEKS ARBACES.  THE RESULT OF THAT INTERVIEW.\n\nARBACES was seated in a chamber which opened on a kind of balcony or\nportico that fronted his garden.  His cheek was pale and worn with the\nsufferings he had endured, but his iron frame had already recovered from\nthe severest effects of that accident which had frustrated his fell\ndesigns in the moment of victory.  The air that came fragrantly to his\nbrow revived his languid senses, and the blood circulated more freely\nthan it had done for days through his shrunken veins.\n\n'So, then,' thought he, 'the storm of fate has broken and blown\nover--the evil which my lore predicted, threatening life itself, has\nchanced--and yet I live!  It came as the stars foretold; and now the\nlong, bright, and prosperous career which was to succeed that evil, if I\nsurvived it, smiles beyond: I have passed--I have subdued the latest\ndanger of my destiny.  Now I have but to lay out the gardens of my\nfuture fate--unterrified and secure. First, then, of all my pleasures,\neven before that of love, shall come revenge!  This boy Greek--who has\ncrossed my passion--thwarted my designs--baffled me even when the blade\nwas about to drink his accursed blood--shall not a second time escape\nme!  But for the method of my vengeance?  Of that let me ponder well!\nOh! Ate, if thou art indeed a goddess, fill me with thy direst\nInspiration!' The Egyptian sank into an intent reverie, which did not\nseem to present to him any clear or satisfactory suggestions.  He\nchanged his position restlessly, as he revolved scheme after scheme,\nwhich no sooner occurred than it was dismissed: several times he struck\nhis breast and groaned aloud, with the desire of vengeance, and a sense\nof his impotence to accomplish it. While thus absorbed, a boy slave\ntimidly entered the chamber.\n\nA female, evidently of rank from her dress, and that of the single slave\nwho attended her, waited below and sought an audience with Arbaces.\n\n'A female!' his heart beat quick.  'Is she young?'\n\n'Her face is concealed by her veil; but her form is slight, yet round,\nas that of youth.'\n\n'Admit her,' said the Egyptian: for a moment his vain heart dreamed the\nstranger might be Ione.\n\nThe first glance of the visitor now entering the apartment sufficed to\nundeceive so erring a fancy.  True, she was about the same height as\nIone, and perhaps the same age--true, she was finely and richly\nformed--but where was that undulating and ineffable grace which\naccompanied every motion of the peerless Neapolitan--the chaste and\ndecorous garb, so simple even in the care of its arrangement--the\ndignified yet bashful step--the majesty of womanhood and its modesty?\n\n'Pardon me that I rise with pain,' said Arbaces, gazing on the stranger:\n'I am still suffering from recent illness.'\n\n'Do not disturb thyself, O great Egyptian!' returned Julia, seeking to\ndisguise the fear she already experienced beneath the ready resort of\nflattery; 'and forgive an unfortunate female, who seeks consolation from\nthy wisdom.'\n\n'Draw near, fair stranger,' said Arbaces; 'and speak without\napprehension or reserve.'\n\nJulia placed herself on a seat beside the Egyptian, and wonderingly\ngazed around an apartment whose elaborate and costly luxuries shamed\neven the ornate enrichment of her father's mansion; fearfully, too, she\nregarded the hieroglyphical inscriptions on the walls--the faces of the\nmysterious images, which at every corner gazed upon her--the tripod at a\nlittle distance--and, above all, the grave and remarkable countenance of\nArbaces himself: a long white robe like a veil half covered his raven\nlocks, and flowed to his feet: his face was made even more impressive by\nits present paleness; and his dark and penetrating eyes seemed to pierce\nthe shelter of her veil, and explore the secrets of her vain and\nunfeminine soul.\n\n'And what,' said his low, deep voice, 'brings thee, O maiden! to the\nhouse of the Eastern stranger?'\n\n'His fame,' replied Julia.\n\n'In what?' said he, with a strange and slight smile.\n\n'Canst thou ask, O wise Arbaces?  Is not thy knowledge the very gossip\ntheme of Pompeii?'\n\n'Some little lore have I indeed, treasured up,' replied Arbaces: 'but in\nwhat can such serious and sterile secrets benefit the ear of beauty?'\n\n'Alas!' said Julia, a little cheered by the accustomed accents of\nadulation; 'does not sorrow fly to wisdom for relief, and they who love\nunrequitedly, are not they the chosen victims of grief?'\n\n'Ha!' said Arbaces, 'can unrequited love be the lot of so fair a form,\nwhose modelled proportions are visible even beneath the folds of thy\ngraceful robe?  Deign, O maiden! to lift thy veil, that I may see at\nleast if the face correspond in loveliness with the form.'\n\nNot unwilling, perhaps, to exhibit her charms, and thinking they were\nlikely to interest the magician in her fate, Julia, after some slight\nhesitation, raised her veil, and revealed a beauty which, but for art,\nhad been indeed attractive to the fixed gaze of the Egyptian.\n\n'Thou comest to me for advice in unhappy love,' said he; 'well, turn\nthat face on the ungrateful one: what other love-charm can I give thee?'\n\n'Oh, cease these courtesies!' said Julia; 'it is a love-charm, indeed,\nthat I would ask from thy skill!'\n\n'Fair stranger!' replied Arbaces, somewhat scornfully, 'love-spells are\nnot among the secrets I have wasted the midnight oil to attain.'\n\n'Is it indeed so?  Then pardon me, great Arbaces, and farewell!'\n\n'Stay,' said Arbaces, who, despite his passion for Ione, was not unmoved\nby the beauty of his visitor; and had he been in the flush of a more\nassured health, might have attempted to console the fair Julia by other\nmeans than those of supernatural wisdom.\n\n'Stay; although I confess that I have left the witchery of philtres and\npotions to those whose trade is in such knowledge, yet am I myself not\nso dull to beauty but that in earlier youth I may have employed them in\nmy own behalf.  I may give thee advice, at least, if thou wilt be candid\nwith me. Tell me then, first, art thou unmarried, as thy dress\nbetokens?'\n\n'Yes,' said Julia.\n\n'And, being unblest with fortune, wouldst thou allure some wealthy\nsuitor?'\n\n'I am richer than he who disdains me.'\n\n'Strange and more strange!  And thou lovest him who loves not thee?'\n\n'I know not if I love him,' answered Julia, haughtily; 'but I know that\nI would see myself triumph over a rival--I would see him who rejected me\nmy suitor--I would see her whom he has preferred in her turn despised.'\n\n'A natural ambition and a womanly,' said the Egyptian, in a tone too\ngrave for irony.  'Yet more, fair maiden; wilt thou confide to me the\nname of thy lover?  Can he be Pompeian, and despise wealth, even if\nblind to beauty?'\n\n'He is of Athens,' answered Julia, looking down.\n\n'Ha!' cried the Egyptian, impetuously, as the blood rushed to his cheek;\n'there is but one Athenian, young and noble, in Pompeii. Can it be\nGlaucus of whom thou speakest!'\n\n'Ah! betray me not--so indeed they call him.'\n\nThe Egyptian sank back, gazing vacantly on the averted face of the\nmerchant's daughter, and muttering inly to himself: this conference,\nwith which he had hitherto only trifled, amusing himself with the\ncredulity and vanity of his visitor--might it not minister to his\nrevenge?'\n\n'I see thou canst assist me not,' said Julia, offended by his continued\nsilence; 'guard at least my secret.  Once more, farewell!'\n\n'Maiden,' said the Egyptian, in an earnest and serious tone, 'thy suit\nhath touched me--I will minister to thy will.  Listen to me; I have not\nmyself dabbled in these lesser mysteries, but I know one who hath.  At\nthe base of Vesuvius, less than a league from the city, there dwells a\npowerful witch; beneath the rank dews of the new moon, she has gathered\nthe herbs which possess the virtue to chain Love in eternal fetters.\nHer art can bring thy lover to thy feet.  Seek her, and mention to her\nthe name of Arbaces: she fears that name, and will give thee her most\npotent philtres.'\n\n'Alas!' answered Julia, I know not the road to the home of her whom thou\nspeakest of: the way, short though it be, is long to traverse for a girl\nwho leaves, unknown, the house of her father. The country is entangled\nwith wild vines, and dangerous with precipitous caverns.  I dare not\ntrust to mere strangers to guide me; the reputation of women of my rank\nis easily tarnished--and though I care not who knows that I love\nGlaucus, I would not have it imagined that I obtained his love by a\nspell.'\n\n'Were I but three days advanced in health,' said the Egyptian, rising\nand walking (as if to try his strength) across the chamber, but with\nirregular and feeble steps, 'I myself would accompany thee.  Well, thou\nmust wait.'\n\n'But Glaucus is soon to wed that hated Neapolitan.'\n\n'Wed!'\n\n'Yes; in the early part of next month.'\n\n'So soon!  Art thou well advised of this?'\n\n'From the lips of her own slave.'\n\n'It shall not be!' said the Egyptian, impetuously.  'Fear nothing,\nGlaucus shall be thine.  Yet how, when thou obtainest it, canst thou\nadminister to him this potion?'\n\n'My father has invited him, and, I believe, the Neapolitan also, to a\nbanquet, on the day following to-morrow: I shall then have the\nopportunity to administer it.'\n\n'So be it!' said the Egyptian, with eyes flashing such fierce joy, that\nJulia's gaze sank trembling beneath them.  'To-morrow eve, then, order\nthy litter--thou hast one at thy command?'\n\n'Surely--yes,' returned the purse-proud Julia.\n\n'Order thy litter--at two miles' distance from the city is a house of\nentertainment, frequented by the wealthier Pompeians, from the\nexcellence of its baths, and the beauty of its gardens.  There canst\nthou pretend only to shape thy course--there, ill or dying, I will meet\nthee by the statue of Silenus, in the copse that skirts the garden; and\nI myself will guide thee to the witch.  Let us wait till, with the\nevening star, the goats of the herdsmen are gone to rest; when the dark\ntwilight conceals us, and none shall cross our steps.  Go home and fear\nnot.  By Hades, swears Arbaces, the sorcerer of Egypt, that Ione shall\nnever wed with Glaucus.'\n\n'And that Glaucus shall be mine,' added Julia, filling up the\nincompleted sentence.\n\n'Thou hast said it!' replied Arbaces; and Julia, half frightened at this\nunhallowed appointment, but urged on by jealousy and the pique of\nrivalship, even more than love, resolved to fulfill it.\n\nLeft alone, Arbaces burst forth:\n\n'Bright stars that never lie, ye already begin the execution of your\npromises--success in love, and victory over foes, for the rest of my\nsmooth existence.  In the very hour when my mind could devise no clue to\nthe goal of vengeance, have ye sent this fair fool for my guide?' He\npaused in deep thought.  'Yes,' said he again, but in a calmer voice; 'I\ncould not myself have given to her the poison, that shall be indeed a\nphiltre!--his death might be thus tracked to my door.  But the\nwitch--ay, there is the fit, the natural agent of my designs!'\n\nHe summoned one of his slaves, bade him hasten to track the steps of\nJulia, and acquaint himself with her name and condition.  This done, he\nstepped forth into the portico.  The skies were serene and clear; but\nhe, deeply read in the signs of their various change, beheld in one mass\nof cloud, far on the horizon, which the wind began slowly to agitate,\nthat a storm was brooding above.\n\n'It is like my vengeance,' said he, as he gazed; 'the sky is clear, but\nthe cloud moves on.'\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nSTORM IN THE SOUTH.  THE WITCH'S CAVERN.\n\nIT was when the heats of noon died gradually away from the earth, that\nGlaucus and Ione went forth to enjoy the cooled and grateful air.  At\nthat time, various carriages were in use among the Romans; the one most\nused by the richer citizens, when they required no companion in their\nexcursion, was the biga, already described in the early portion of this\nwork; that appropriated to the matrons, was termed carpentum, which had\ncommonly two wheels; the ancients used also a sort of litter, a vast\nsedan-chair, more commodiously arranged than the modern, inasmuch as the\noccupant thereof could lie down at ease, instead of being\nperpendicularly and stiffly jostled up and down.  There was another\ncarriage, used both for travelling and for excursions in the country; it\nwas commodious, containing three or four persons with ease, having a\ncovering which could be raised at pleasure; and, in short, answering\nvery much the purpose of (though very different in shape from) the\nmodern britska.  It was a vehicle of this description that the lovers,\naccompanied by one female slave of Ione, now used in their excursion.\nAbout ten miles from the city, there was at that day an old ruin, the\nremains of a temple, evidently Grecian; and as for Glaucus and Ione\neverything Grecian possessed an interest, they had agreed to visit these\nruins: it was thither they were now bound.\n\nTheir road lay among vines and olive-groves; till, winding more and more\ntowards the higher ground of Vesuvius, the path grew rugged; the mules\nmoved slowly, and with labor; and at every opening in the wood they\nbeheld those grey and horrent caverns indenting the parched rock, which\nStrabo has described; but which the various revolutions of time and the\nvolcano have removed from the present aspect of the mountain.  The sun,\nsloping towards his descent, cast long and deep shadows over the\nmountain; here and there they still heard the rustic reed of the\nshepherd amongst copses of the beechwood and wild oak.  Sometimes they\nmarked the form of the silk-haired and graceful capella, with its\nwreathing horn and bright grey eye--which, still beneath Ausonian skies,\nrecalls the eclogues of Maro, browsing half-way up the hills; and the\ngrapes, already purple with the smiles of the deepening summer, glowed\nout from the arched festoons, which hung pendent from tree to tree.\nAbove them, light clouds floated in the serene heavens, sweeping so\nslowly athwart the firmament that they scarcely seemed to stir; while,\non their right, they caught, ever and anon, glimpses of the waveless\nsea, with some light bark skimming its surface; and the sunlight\nbreaking over the deep in those countless and softest hues so peculiar\nto that delicious sea.\n\n'How beautiful!' said Glaucus, in a half-whispered tone, 'is that\nexpression by which we call Earth our Mother!  With what a kindly equal\nlove she pours her blessings upon her children! and even to those\nsterile spots to which Nature has denied beauty, she yet contrives to\ndispense her smiles: witness the arbutus and the vine, which she\nwreathes over the arid and burning soil of yon extinct volcano.  Ah! in\nsuch an hour and scene as this, well might we imagine that the Faun\nshould peep forth from those green festoons; or, that we might trace the\nsteps of the Mountain Nymph through the thickest mazes of the glade.\nBut the Nymphs ceased, beautiful Ione, when thou wert created!'\n\nThere is no tongue that flatters like a lover's; and yet, in the\nexaggeration of his feelings, flattery seems to him commonplace. Strange\nand prodigal exuberance, which soon exhausts itself by overflowing!\n\nThey arrived at the ruins; they examined them with that fondness with\nwhich we trace the hallowed and household vestiges of our own\nancestry--they lingered there till Hesperus appeared in the rosy\nheavens; and then returning homeward in the twilight, they were more\nsilent than they had been; for in the shadow and beneath the stars they\nfelt more oppressively their mutual love.\n\nIt was at this time that the storm which the Egyptian had predicted\nbegan to creep visibly over them.  At first, a low and distant thunder\ngave warning of the approaching conflict of the elements; and then\nrapidly rushed above the dark ranks of the serried clouds.  The\nsuddenness of storms in that climate is something almost preternatural,\nand might well suggest to early superstition the notion of a divine\nagency--a few large drops broke heavily among the boughs that half\noverhung their path, and then, swift and intolerably bright, the forked\nlightning darted across their very eyes, and was swallowed up by the\nincreasing darkness.\n\n'Swifter, good Carrucarius!' cried Glaucus to the driver; 'the tempest\ncomes on apace.'\n\nThe slave urged on the mules--they went swift over the uneven and stony\nroad--the clouds thickened, near and more near broke the thunder, and\nfast rushed the dashing rain.\n\n'Dost thou fear?' whispered Glaucus, as he sought excuse in the storm to\ncome nearer to Ione.\n\n'Not with thee,' said she, softly.\n\nAt that instant, the carriage, fragile and ill-contrived (as, despite\ntheir graceful shapes, were, for practical uses, most of such inventions\nat that time), struck violently into a deep rut, over which lay a log of\nfallen wood; the driver, with a curse, stimulated his mules yet faster\nfor the obstacle, the wheel was torn from the socket, and the carriage\nsuddenly overset.\n\nGlaucus, quickly extricating himself from the vehicle, hastened to\nassist Ione, who was fortunately unhurt; with some difficulty they\nraised the carruca (or carriage), and found that it ceased any longer\neven to afford them shelter; the springs that fastened the covering were\nsnapped asunder, and the rain poured fast and fiercely into the\ninterior.\n\nIn this dilemma, what was to be done?  They were yet some distance from\nthe city--no house, no aid, seemed near.\n\n'There is,' said the slave, 'a smith about a mile off; I could seek him,\nand he might fasten at least the wheel to the carruca--but, Jupiter! how\nthe rain beats; my mistress will be wet before I come back.'\n\n'Run thither at least,' said Glaucus; 'we must find the best shelter we\ncan till you return.'\n\nThe lane was overshadowed with trees, beneath the amplest of which\nGlaucus drew Ione.  He endeavored, by stripping his own cloak, to shield\nher yet more from the rapid rain; but it descended with a fury that\nbroke through all puny obstacles: and suddenly, while Glaucus was yet\nwhispering courage to his beautiful charge, the lightning struck one of\nthe trees immediately before them, and split with a mighty crash its\nhuge trunk in twain.  This awful incident apprised them of the danger\nthey braved in their present shelter, and Glaucus looked anxiously round\nfor some less perilous place of refuge.  'We are now,' said he,\n'half-way up the ascent of Vesuvius; there ought to be some cavern, or\nhollow in the vine-clad rocks, could we but find it, in which the\ndeserting Nymphs have left a shelter.' While thus saying he moved from\nthe trees, and, looking wistfully towards the mountain, discovered\nthrough the advancing gloom a red and tremulous light at no considerable\ndistance. 'That must come,' said he, 'from the hearth of some shepherd\nor vine-dresser--it will guide us to some hospitable retreat.  Wilt thou\nstay here, while I--yet no--that would be to leave thee to danger.'\n\n'I will go with you cheerfully,' said Ione.  'Open as the space seems,\nit is better than the treacherous shelter of these boughs.'\n\nHalf leading, half carrying Ione, Glaucus, accompanied by the trembling\nfemale slave, advanced towards the light, which yet burned red and\nsteadfastly.  At length the space was no longer open; wild vines\nentangled their steps, and hid from them, save by imperfect intervals,\nthe guiding beam.  But faster and fiercer came the rain, and the\nlightning assumed its most deadly and blasting form; they were still\ntherefore, impelled onward, hoping, at last, if the light eluded them,\nto arrive at some cottage or some friendly cavern.  The vines grew more\nand more intricate--the light was entirely snatched from them; but a\nnarrow path, which they trod with labor and pain, guided only by the\nconstant and long-lingering flashes of the storm, continued to lead them\ntowards its direction.  The rain ceased suddenly; precipitous and rough\ncrags of scorched lava frowned before them, rendered more fearful by the\nlightning that illumined the dark and dangerous soil.  Sometimes the\nblaze lingered over the iron-grey heaps of scoria, covered in part with\nancient mosses or stunted trees, as if seeking in vain for some gentler\nproduct of earth, more worthy of its ire; and sometimes leaving the\nwhole of that part of the scene in darkness, the lightning, broad and\nsheeted, hung redly over the ocean, tossing far below, until its waves\nseemed glowing into fire; and so intense was the blaze, that it brought\nvividly into view even the sharp outline of the more distant windings of\nthe bay, from the eternal Misenum, with its lofty brow, to the beautiful\nSorrentum and the giant hills behind.\n\nOur lovers stopped in perplexity and doubt, when suddenly, as the\ndarkness that gloomed between the fierce flashes of lightning once more\nwrapped them round, they saw near, but high, before them, the mysterious\nlight.  Another blaze, in which heaven and earth were reddened, made\nvisible to them the whole expanse; no house was near, but just where\nthey had beheld the light, they thought they saw in the recess of the\ncavern the outline of a human form.  The darkness once more returned;\nthe light, no longer paled beneath the fires of heaven, burned forth\nagain: they resolved to ascend towards it; they had to wind their way\namong vast fragments of stone, here and there overhung with wild bushes;\nbut they gained nearer and nearer to the light, and at length they stood\nopposite the mouth of a kind of cavern, apparently formed by huge\nsplinters of rock that had fallen transversely athwart each other: and,\nlooking into the gloom, each drew back involuntarily with a\nsuperstitious fear and chill.\n\nA fire burned in the far recess of the cave; and over it was a small\ncauldron; on a tall and thin column of iron stood a rude lamp; over that\npart of the wall, at the base of which burned the fire, hung in many\nrows, as if to dry, a profusion of herbs and weeds.  A fox, couched\nbefore the fire, gazed upon the strangers with its bright and red\neye--its hair bristling--and a low growl stealing from between its\nteeth; in the centre of the cave was an earthen statue, which had three\nheads of a singular and fantastic cast: they were formed by the real\nskulls of a dog, a horse, and a boar; a low tripod stood before this\nwild representation of the popular Hecate.\n\nBut it was not these appendages and appliances of the cave that thrilled\nthe blood of those who gazed fearfully therein--it was the face of its\ninmate. Before the fire, with the light shining full upon her features,\nsat a woman of considerable age.  Perhaps in no country are there seen\nso many hags as in Italy--in no country does beauty so awfully change,\nin age, to hideousness the most appalling and revolting.  But the old\nwoman now before them was not one of these specimens of the extreme of\nhuman ugliness; on the contrary, her countenance betrayed the remains of\na regular but high and aquiline order of feature: with stony eyes turned\nupon them--with a look that met and fascinated theirs--they beheld in\nthat fearful countenance the very image of a corpse!--the same, the\nglazed and lustreless regard, the blue and shrunken lips, the drawn and\nhollow jaw--the dead, lank hair, of a pale grey--the livid, green,\nghastly skin, which seemed all surely tinged and tainted by the grave!\n\n'It is a dead thing,' said Glaucus.\n\n'Nay--it stirs--it is a ghost or larva,' faltered Ione, as she clung to\nthe Athenian's breast.\n\n'Oh, away, away!' groaned the slave, 'it is the Witch of Vesuvius!'\n\n'Who are ye?' said a hollow and ghostly voice.  'And what do ye here?'\n\nThe sound, terrible and deathlike as it was--suiting well the\ncountenance of the speaker, and seeming rather the voice of some\nbodiless wanderer of the Styx than living mortal, would have made Ione\nshrink back into the pitiless fury of the storm, but Glaucus, though not\nwithout some misgiving, drew her into the cavern.\n\n'We are storm-beaten wanderers from the neighboring city,' said he, 'and\ndecoyed hither by yon light; we crave shelter and the comfort of your\nhearth.'\n\nAs he spoke, the fox rose from the ground, and advanced towards the\nstrangers, showing, from end to end, its white teeth, and deepening in\nits menacing growl.\n\n'Down, slave!' said the witch; and at the sound of her voice the beast\ndropped at once, covering its face with its brush, and keeping only its\nquick, vigilant eye fixed upon the invaders of its repose. 'Come to the\nfire if ye will!' said she, turning to Glaucus and his companions.  'I\nnever welcome living thing--save the owl, the fox, the toad, and the\nviper--so I cannot welcome ye; but come to the fire without welcome--why\nstand upon form?'\n\nThe language in which the hag addressed them was a strange and barbarous\nLatin, interlarded with many words of some more rude, and ancient\ndialect. She did not stir from her seat, but gazed stonily upon them as\nGlaucus now released Ione of her outer wrapping garments, and making her\nplace herself on a log of wood, which was the only other seat he\nperceived at hand--fanned with his breath the embers into a more glowing\nflame.  The slave, encouraged by the boldness of her superiors, divested\nherself also of her long palla, and crept timorously to the opposite\ncorner of the hearth.\n\n'We disturb you, I fear,' said the silver voice of Ione, in\nconciliation.\n\nThe witch did not reply--she seemed like one who has awakened for a\nmoment from the dead, and has then relapsed once more into the eternal\nslumber.\n\n'Tell me,' said she, suddenly, and after a long pause, 'are ye brother\nand sister?'\n\n'No,' said Ione, blushing.\n\n'Are ye married?'\n\n'Not so,' replied Glaucus.\n\n'Ho, lovers!--ha!--ha!--ha!' and the witch laughed so loud and so long\nthat the caverns rang again.\n\nThe heart of Ione stood still at that strange mirth.  Glaucus muttered a\nrapid counterspell to the omen--and the slave turned as pale as the\ncheek of the witch herself.\n\n'Why dost thou laugh, old crone?' said Glaucus, somewhat sternly, as he\nconcluded his invocation.\n\n'Did I laugh?' said the hag, absently.\n\n'She is in her dotage,' whispered Glaucus: as he said this, he caught\nthe eye of the hag fixed upon him with a malignant and vivid glare.\n\n'Thou liest!' said she, abruptly.\n\n'Thou art an uncourteous welcomer,' returned Glaucus.\n\n'Hush! provoke her not, dear Glaucus!' whispered Ione.\n\n'I will tell thee why I laughed when I discovered ye were lovers,' said\nthe old woman.  'It was because it is a pleasure to the old and withered\nto look upon young hearts like yours--and to know the time will come\nwhen you will loathe each other--loathe--loathe--ha!--ha!--ha!'\n\nIt was now Ione's turn to pray against the unpleasing prophecy.\n\n'The gods forbid!' said she.  'Yet, poor woman, thou knowest little of\nlove, or thou wouldst know that it never changes.'\n\n'Was I young once, think ye?' returned the hag, quickly; 'and am I old,\nand hideous, and deathly now?  Such as is the form, so is the heart.'\nWith these words she sank again into a stillness profound and fearful,\nas if the cessation of life itself.\n\n'Hast thou dwelt here long?' said Glaucus, after a pause, feeling\nuncomfortably oppressed beneath a silence so appalling.\n\n'Ah, long!--yes.'\n\n'It is but a drear abode.'\n\n'Ha! thou mayst well say that--Hell is beneath us!' replied the hag,\npointing her bony finger to the earth.  'And I will tell thee a\nsecret--the dim things below are preparing wrath for ye above--you, the\nyoung, and the thoughtless, and the beautiful.'\n\n'Thou utterest but evil words, ill becoming the hospitable,' said\nGlaucus; 'and in future I will brave the tempest rather than thy\nwelcome.'\n\n'Thou wilt do well.  None should ever seek me--save the wretched!'\n\n'And why the wretched?' asked the Athenian.\n\n'I am the witch of the mountain,' replied the sorceress, with a ghastly\ngrin; 'my trade is to give hope to the hopeless: for the crossed in love\nI have philtres; for the avaricious, promises of treasure; for the\nmalicious, potions of revenge; for the happy and the good, I have only\nwhat life has--curses!  Trouble me no more.\n\nWith this the grim tenant of the cave relapsed into a silence so\nobstinate and sullen, that Glaucus in vain endeavored to draw her into\nfarther conversation.  She did not evince, by any alteration of her\nlocked and rigid features, that she even heard him.  Fortunately,\nhowever, the storm, which was brief as violent, began now to relax; the\nrain grew less and less fierce; and at last, as the clouds parted, the\nmoon burst forth in the purple opening of heaven, and streamed clear and\nfull into that desolate abode.  Never had she shone, perhaps, on a group\nmore worthy of the painter's art.  The young, the all-beautiful Ione,\nseated by that rude fire--her lover already forgetful of the presence of\nthe hag, at her feet, gazing upward to her face, and whispering sweet\nwords--the pale and affrighted slave at a little distance--and the\nghastly hag resting her deadly eyes upon them; yet seemingly serene and\nfearless (for the companionship of love hath such power) were these\nbeautiful beings, things of another sphere, in that dark and unholy\ncavern, with its gloomy quaintness of appurtenance.  The fox regarded\nthem from his corner with his keen and fiery eye: and as Glaucus now\nturned towards the witch, he perceived for the first time, just under\nher seat, the bright gaze and crested head of a large snake: whether it\nwas that the vivid coloring of the Athenian's cloak, thrown over the\nshoulders of Ione, attracted the reptile's anger--its crest began to\nglow and rise, as if menacing and preparing itself to spring upon the\nNeapolitan--Glaucus caught quickly at one of the half-burned logs upon\nthe hearth--and, as if enraged at the action, the snake came forth from\nits shelter, and with a loud hiss raised itself on end till its height\nnearly approached that of the Greek.\n\n'Witch!' cried Glaucus, 'command thy creature, or thou wilt see it\ndead.'\n\n'It has been despoiled of its venom!' said the witch, aroused at his\nthreat; but ere the words had left her lip, the snake had sprung upon\nGlaucus; quick and watchful, the agile Greek leaped lightly aside, and\nstruck so fell and dexterous a blow on the head of the snake, that it\nfell prostrate and writhing among the embers of the fire.\n\nThe hag sprung up, and stood confronting Glaucus with a face which would\nhave befitted the fiercest of the Furies, so utterly dire and wrathful\nwas its expression--yet even in horror and ghastliness preserving the\noutline and trace of beauty--and utterly free from that coarse grotesque\nat which the imaginations of the North have sought the source of terror.\n'Thou hast,' said she, in a slow and steady voice--which belied the\nexpression of her face, so much was it passionless and calm--'thou hast\nhad shelter under my roof, and warmth at my hearth; thou hast returned\nevil for good; thou hast smitten and haply slain the thing that loved me\nand was mine: nay, more, the creature, above all others, consecrated to\ngods and deemed venerable by man,--now hear thy punishment.  By the\nmoon, who is the guardian of the sorceress--by Orcus, who is the\ntreasurer of wrath--I curse thee! and thou art cursed!  May thy love be\nblasted--may thy name be blackened--may the infernals mark thee--may thy\nheart wither and scorch--may thy last hour recall to thee the prophet\nvoice of the Saga of Vesuvius!  And thou,' she added, turning sharply\ntowards Ione, and raising her right arm, when Glaucus burst impetuously\non her speech:\n\n'Hag!' cried he, 'forbear!  Me thou hast cursed, and I commit myself to\nthe gods--I defy and scorn thee! but breathe but one word against yon\nmaiden, and I will convert the oath on thy foul lips to thy dying groan.\nBeware!'\n\n'I have done,' replied the hag, laughing wildly; 'for in thy doom is she\nwho loves thee accursed.  And not the less, that I heard her lips\nbreathe thy name, and know by what word to commend thee to the demons.\nGlaucus--thou art doomed!' So saying, the witch turned from the\nAthenian, and kneeling down beside her wounded favorite, which she\ndragged from the hearth, she turned to them her face no more.\n\n'O Glaucus!' said Ione, greatly terrified, 'what have we done?--Let us\nhasten from this place; the storm has ceased.  Good mistress, forgive\nhim--recall thy words--he meant but to defend himself--accept this\npeace-offering to unsay the said': and Ione, stooping, placed her purse\non the hag's lap.\n\n'Away!' said she, bitterly--'away!  The oath once woven the Fates only\ncan untie.  Away!'\n\n'Come, dearest!' said Glaucus, impatiently.  'Thinkest thou that the\ngods above us or below hear the impotent ravings of dotage?  Come!'\n\nLong and loud rang the echoes of the cavern with the dread laugh of the\nSaga--she deigned no further reply.\n\nThe lovers breathed more freely when they gained the open air: yet the\nscene they had witnessed, the words and the laughter of the witch, still\nfearfully dwelt with Ione; and even Glaucus could not thoroughly shake\noff the impression they bequeathed.  The storm had subsided--save, now\nand then, a low thunder muttered at the distance amidst the darker\nclouds, or a momentary flash of lightning affronted the sovereignty of\nthe moon.  With some difficulty they regained the road, where they found\nthe vehicle already sufficiently repaired for their departure, and the\ncarrucarius calling loudly upon Hercules to tell him where his charge\nhad vanished.\n\nGlaucus vainly endeavored to cheer the exhausted spirits of Ione; and\nscarce less vainly to recover the elastic tone of his own natural\ngaiety.  They soon arrived before the gate of the city: as it opened to\nthem, a litter borne by slaves impeded the way.\n\n'It is too late for egress,' cried the sentinel to the inmate of the\nlitter.\n\n'Not so,' said a voice, which the lovers started to hear; it was a voice\nthey well recognized.  'I am bound to the villa of Marcus Polybius.  I\nshall return shortly.  I am Arbaces the Egyptian.'\n\nThe scruples of him at the gate were removed, and the litter passed\nclose beside the carriage that bore the lovers.\n\n'Arbaces, at this hour!--scarce recovered too, methinks!--Whither and\nfor what can he leave the city?' said Glaucus.\n\n'Alas!' replied Ione, bursting into tears, 'my soul feels still more and\nmore the omen of evil.  Preserve us, O ye Gods! or at least,' she\nmurmured inly, 'preserve my Glaucus!'\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nTHE LORD OF THE BURNING BELT AND HIS MINION.  FATE WRITES HER PROPHECY\nIN RED LETTERS, BUT WHO SHALL READ THEM?\n\nARBACES had tarried only till the cessation of the tempest allowed him,\nunder cover of night, to seek the Saga of Vesuvius.  Borne by those of\nhis trustier slaves in whom in all more secret expeditions he was\naccustomed to confide, he lay extended along his litter, and resigning\nhis sanguine heart to the contemplation of vengeance gratified and love\npossessed.  The slaves in so short a journey moved very little slower\nthan the ordinary pace of mules; and Arbaces soon arrived at the\ncommencement of a narrow path, which the lovers had not been fortunate\nenough to discover; but which, skirting the thick vines, led at once to\nthe habitation of the witch.  Here he rested the litter; and bidding his\nslaves conceal themselves and the vehicle among the vines from the\nobservation of any chance passenger, he mounted alone, with steps still\nfeeble but supported by a long staff, the drear and sharp ascent.\n\nNot a drop of rain fell from the tranquil heaven; but the moisture\ndripped mournfully from the laden boughs of the vine, and now and then\ncollected in tiny pools in the crevices and hollows of the rocky way.\n\n'Strange passions these for a philosopher,' thought Arbaces, 'that lead\none like me just new from the bed of death, and lapped even in health\namidst the roses of luxury, across such nocturnal paths as this; but\nPassion and Vengeance treading to their goal can make an Elysium of a\nTartarus.' High, clear, and melancholy shone the moon above the road of\nthat dark wayfarer, glossing herself in every pool that lay before him,\nand sleeping in shadow along the sloping mount. He saw before him the\nsame light that had guided the steps of his intended victims, but, no\nlonger contrasted by the blackened clouds, it shone less redly clear.\n\nHe paused, as at length he approached the mouth of the cavern, to\nrecover breath; and then, with his wonted collected and stately mien, he\ncrossed the unhallowed threshold.\n\nThe fox sprang up at the ingress of this newcomer, and by a long howl\nannounced another visitor to his mistress.\n\nThe witch had resumed her seat, and her aspect of gravelike and grim\nrepose. By her feet, upon a bed of dry weeds which half covered it, lay\nthe wounded snake; but the quick eye of the Egyptian caught its scales\nglittering in the reflected light of the opposite fire, as it\nwrithed--now contracting, now lengthening, its folds, in pain and\nunsated anger.\n\n'Down, slave!' said the witch, as before, to the fox; and, as before,\nthe animal dropped to the ground--mute, but vigilant.\n\n'Rise, servant of Nox and Erebus!' said Arbaces, commandingly; 'a\nsuperior in thine art salutes thee! rise, and welcome him.'\n\nAt these words the hag turned her gaze upon the Egyptian's towering form\nand dark features.  She looked long and fixedly upon him, as he stood\nbefore her in his Oriental robe, and folded arms, and steadfast and\nhaughty brow.  'Who art thou,' she said at last, 'that callest thyself\ngreater in art than the Saga of the Burning Fields, and the daughter of\nthe perished Etrurian race?'\n\n'I am he,' answered Arbaces, 'from whom all cultivators of magic, from\nnorth to south, from east to west, from the Ganges and the Nile to the\nvales of Thessaly and the shores of the yellow Tiber, have stooped to\nlearn.'\n\n'There is but one such man in these places,' answered the witch, 'whom\nthe men of the outer world, unknowing his loftier attributes and more\nsecret fame, call Arbaces the Egyptian: to us of a higher nature and\ndeeper knowledge, his rightful appellation is Hermes of the Burning\nGirdle.'\n\n'Look again, returned Arbaces: 'I am he.'\n\nAs he spoke he drew aside his robe, and revealed a cincture seemingly of\nfire, that burned around his waist, clasped in the centre by a plate\nwhereon was engraven some sign apparently vague and unintelligible but\nwhich was evidently not unknown to the Saga.  She rose hastily, and\nthrew herself at the feet of Arbaces.  'I have seen, then,' said she, in\na voice of deep humility, 'the Lord of the Mighty Girdle--vouchsafe my\nhomage.'\n\n'Rise,' said the Egyptian; 'I have need of thee.'\n\nSo saying, he placed himself on the same log of wood on which Ione had\nrested before, and motioned to the witch to resume her seat.\n\n'Thou sayest,' said he, as she obeyed, 'that thou art a daughter of the\nancient Etrurian tribes; the mighty walls of whose rock-built cities yet\nfrown above the robber race that hath seized upon their ancient reign.\nPartly came those tribes from Greece, partly were they exiles from a\nmore burning and primeval soil.  In either case art thou of Egyptian\nlineage, for the Grecian masters of the aboriginal helot were among the\nrestless sons whom the Nile banished from her bosom.  Equally, then, O\nSaga! thy descent is from ancestors that swore allegiance to mine own.\nBy birth as by knowledge, art thou the subject of Arbaces.  Hear me,\nthen, and obey!'\n\nThe witch bowed her head.\n\n'Whatever art we possess in sorcery,' continued Arbaces, 'we are\nsometimes driven to natural means to attain our object.  The ring and\nthe crystal, and the ashes and the herbs, do not give unerring\ndivinations; neither do the higher mysteries of the moon yield even the\npossessor of the girdle a dispensation from the necessity of employing\never and anon human measures for a human object.  Mark me, then: thou\nart deeply skilled, methinks, in the secrets of the more deadly herbs;\nthou knowest those which arrest life, which burn and scorch the soul\nfrom out her citadel, or freeze the channels of young blood into that\nice which no sun can melt.  Do I overrate thy skill?  Speak, and truly!'\n\n'Mighty Hermes, such lore is, indeed, mine own.  Deign to look at these\nghostly and corpse-like features; they have waned from the hues of life\nmerely by watching over the rank herbs which simmer night and day in yon\ncauldron.'\n\nThe Egyptian moved his seat from so unblessed or so unhealthful a\nvicinity as the witch spoke.\n\n'It is well,' said he; 'thou hast learned that maxim of all the deeper\nknowledge which saith, \"Despise the body to make wise the mind.\" But to\nthy task.  There cometh to thee by to-morrow's starlight a vain maiden,\nseeking of thine art a love-charm to fascinate from another the eyes\nthat should utter but soft tales to her own: instead of thy philtres,\ngive the maiden one of thy most powerful poisons.  Let the lover breathe\nhis vows to the Shades.'\n\nThe witch trembled from head to foot.\n\n'Oh pardon! pardon! dread master,' said she, falteringly, 'but this I\ndare not.  The law in these cities is sharp and vigilant; they will\nseize, they will slay me.'\n\n'For what purpose, then, thy herbs and thy potions, vain Saga?' said\nArbaces, sneeringly.\n\nThe witch hid her loathsome face with her hands.\n\n'Oh! years ago,' said she, in a voice unlike her usual tones, so\nplaintive was it, and so soft, 'I was not the thing that I am now.  I\nloved, I fancied myself beloved.'\n\n'And what connection hath thy love, witch, with my commands?' said\nArbaces, impetuously.\n\n'Patience,' resumed the witch; 'patience, I implore.  I loved! another\nand less fair than I--yes, by Nemesis! less fair--allured from me my\nchosen.  I was of that dark Etrurian tribe to whom most of all were\nknown the secrets of the gloomier magic.  My mother was herself a saga:\nshe shared the resentment of her child; from her hands I received the\npotion that was to restore me his love; and from her, also, the poison\nthat was to destroy my rival.  Oh, crush me, dread walls! my trembling\nhands mistook the phials, my lover fell indeed at my feet; but dead!\ndead! dead!  Since then, what has been life to me I became suddenly old,\nI devoted myself to the sorceries of my race; still by an irresistible\nimpulse I curse myself with an awful penance; still I seek the most\nnoxious herbs; still I concoct the poisons; still I imagine that I am to\ngive them to my hated rival; still I pour them into the phial; still I\nfancy that they shall blast her beauty to the dust; still I wake and see\nthe quivering body, the foaming lips, the glazing eyes of my\nAulus--murdered, and by me!'\n\nThe skeleton frame of the witch shook beneath strong convulsions.\n\nArbaces gazed upon her with a curious though contemptuous eye.\n\n'And this foul thing has yet human emotions!' thought he; 'still she\ncowers over the ashes of the same fire that consumes Arbaces!--Such are\nwe all! Mystic is the tie of those mortal passions that unite the\ngreatest and the least.'\n\nHe did not reply till she had somewhat recovered herself, and now sat\nrocking to and fro in her seat, with glassy eyes fixed on the opposite\nflame, and large tears rolling down her livid cheeks.\n\n'A grievous tale is thine, in truth,' said Arbaces.  'But these emotions\nare fit only for our youth--age should harden our hearts to all things\nbut ourselves; as every year adds a scale to the shell-fish, so should\neach year wall and incrust the heart.  Think of those frenzies no more!\nAnd now, listen to me again!  By the revenge that was dear to thee, I\ncommand thee to obey me! it is for vengeance that I seek thee!  This\nyouth whom I would sweep from my path has crossed me, despite my\nspells:--this thing of purple and broidery, of smiles and glances,\nsoulless and mindless, with no charm but that of beauty--accursed be\nit!--this insect--this Glaucus--I tell thee, by Orcus and by Nemesis, he\nmust die.'\n\nAnd working himself up at every word, the Egyptian, forgetful of his\ndebility--of his strange companion--of everything but his own vindictive\nrage, strode, with large and rapid steps, the gloomy cavern.\n\n'Glaucus! saidst thou, mighty master!' said the witch, abruptly; and her\ndim eye glared at the name with all that fierce resentment at the memory\nof small affronts so common amongst the solitary and the shunned.\n\n'Ay, so he is called; but what matters the name?  Let it not be heard as\nthat of a living man three days from this date!'\n\n'Hear me!' said the witch, breaking from a short reverie into which she\nwas plunged after this last sentence of the Egyptian. 'Hear me! I am thy\nthing and thy slave! spare me!  If I give to the maiden thou speakest of\nthat which would destroy the life of Glaucus, I shall be surely\ndetected--the dead ever find avengers.  Nay, dread man! if thy visit to\nme be tracked, if thy hatred to Glaucus be known, thou mayest have need\nof thy archest magic to protect thyself!'\n\n'Ha!' said Arbaces, stopping suddenly short; and as a proof of that\nblindness with which passion darkens the eyes even of the most acute,\nthis was the first time when the risk that he himself ran by this method\nof vengeance had occurred to a mind ordinarily wary and circumspect.\n\n'But,' continued the witch, 'if instead of that which shall arrest the\nheart, I give that which shall sear and blast the brain--which shall\nmake him who quaffs it unfit for the uses and career of life--an abject,\nraving, benighted thing--smiting sense to drivelling youth to\ndotage--will not thy vengeance be equally sated--thy object equally\nattained?'\n\n'Oh, witch! no longer the servant, but the sister--the equal of\nArbaces--how much brighter is woman's wit, even in vengeance, than ours!\nhow much more exquisite than death is such a doom!'\n\n'And,' continued the hag, gloating over her fell scheme, 'in this is but\nlittle danger; for by ten thousand methods, which men forbear to seek,\ncan our victim become mad.  He may have been among the vines and seen a\nnymph--or the vine itself may have had the same effect--ha, ha! they\nnever inquire too scrupulously into these matters in which the gods may\nbe agents. And let the worst arrive--let it be known that it is a\nlove-charm--why, madness is a common effect of philtres; and even the\nfair she that gave it finds indulgence in the excuse. Mighty Hermes,\nhave I ministered to thee cunningly?'\n\n'Thou shalt have twenty years' longer date for this,' returned Arbaces.\n'I will write anew the epoch of thy fate on the face of the pale\nstars--thou shalt not serve in vain the Master of the Flaming Belt.  And\nhere, Saga, carve thee out, by these golden tools, a warmer cell in this\ndreary cavern--one service to me shall countervail a thousand\ndivinations by sieve and shears to the gaping rustics.' So saying, he\ncast upon the floor a heavy purse, which clinked not unmusically to the\near of the hag, who loved the consciousness of possessing the means to\npurchase comforts she disdained. 'Farewell,' said Arbaces, 'fail\nnot--outwatch the stars in concocting thy beverage--thou shalt lord it\nover thy sisters at the Walnut-tree,' when thou tellest them that thy\npatron and thy friend is Hermes the Egyptian. To-morrow night we meet\nagain.'\n\nHe stayed not to hear the valediction or the thanks of the witch; with a\nquick step he passed into the moonlit air, and hastened down the\nmountain.\n\nThe witch, who followed his steps to the threshold, stood at the\nentrance of the cavern, gazing fixedly on his receding form; and as the\nsad moonlight streamed over her shadowy form and deathlike face,\nemerging from the dismal rocks, it seemed as if one gifted, indeed, by\nsupernatural magic had escaped from the dreary Orcus; and, the foremost\nof its ghostly throng, stood at its black portals--vainly summoning his\nreturn, or vainly sighing to rejoin him. The hag, then slowly\nre-entering the cave, groaningly picked up the heavy purse, took the\nlamp from its stand, and, passing to the remotest depth of her cell, a\nblack and abrupt passage, which was not visible, save at a near\napproach, closed round as it was with jutting and sharp crags, yawned\nbefore her: she went several yards along this gloomy path, which sloped\ngradually downwards, as if towards the bowels of the earth, and, lifting\na stone, deposited her treasure in a hole beneath, which, as the lamp\npierced its secrets, seemed already to contain coins of various value,\nwrung from the credulity or gratitude of her visitors.\n\n'I love to look at you,' said she, apostrophising the moneys; 'for when\nI see you I feel that I am indeed of power.  And I am to have twenty\nyears' longer life to increase your store! O thou great Hermes!'\n\nShe replaced the stone, and continued her path onward for some paces,\nwhen she stopped before a deep irregular fissure in the earth.  Here, as\nshe bent--strange, rumbling, hoarse, and distant sounds might be heard,\nwhile ever and anon, with a loud and grating noise which, to use a\nhomely but faithful simile, seemed to resemble the grinding of steel\nupon wheels, volumes of streaming and dark smoke issued forth, and\nrushed spirally along the cavern.\n\n'The Shades are noisier than their wont,' said the hag, shaking her grey\nlocks; and, looking into the cavity, she beheld, far down, glimpses of a\nlong streak of light, intensely but darkly red. 'Strange!' she said,\nshrinking back; 'it is only within the last two days that dull, deep\nlight hath been visible--what can it portend?'\n\nThe fox, who had attended the steps of his fell mistress, uttered a\ndismal howl, and ran cowering back to the inner cave; a cold shuddering\nseized the hag herself at the cry of the animal, which, causeless as it\nseemed, the superstitions of the time considered deeply ominous.  She\nmuttered her placatory charm, and tottered back into her cavern, where,\namidst her herbs and incantations, she prepared to execute the orders of\nthe Egyptian.\n\n'He called me dotard,' said she, as the smoke curled from the hissing\ncauldron: 'when the jaws drop, and the grinders fall, and the heart\nscarce beats, it is a pitiable thing to dote; but when,' she added, with\na savage and exulting grin, 'the young, and the beautiful, and the\nstrong, are suddenly smitten into idiocy--ah, that is terrible!  Burn,\nflame--simmer herb--swelter toad--I cursed him, and he shall be cursed!'\n\nOn that night, and at the same hour which witnessed the dark and unholy\ninterview between Arbaces and the Saga, Apaecides was baptized.\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nPROGRESS OF EVENTS.  THE PLOT THICKENS.  THE WEB IS WOVEN, BUT THE NET\nCHANGES HANDS.\n\n'AND you have the courage then, Julia, to seek the Witch of Vesuvius\nthis evening; in company, too, with that fearful man?'\n\n'Why, Nydia?' replied Julia, timidly; 'dost thou really think there is\nanything to dread?  These old hags, with their enchanted mirrors, their\ntrembling sieves, and their moon-gathered herbs, are, I imagine, but\ncrafty impostors, who have learned, perhaps, nothing but the very charm\nfor which I apply to their skill, and which is drawn but from the\nknowledge of the field's herbs and simples. Wherefore should I dread?'\n\n'Dost thou not fear thy companion?'\n\n'What, Arbaces?  By Dian, I never saw lover more courteous than that\nsame magician!  And were he not so dark, he would be even handsome.'\n\nBlind as she was, Nydia had the penetration to perceive that Julia's\nmind was not one that the gallantries of Arbaces were likely to terrify.\nShe therefore dissuaded her no more: but nursed in her excited heart the\nwild and increasing desire to know if sorcery had indeed a spell to\nfascinate love to love.\n\n'Let me go with thee, noble Julia,' said she at length; 'my presence is\nno protection, but I should like to be beside thee to the last.'\n\n'Thine offer pleases me much,' replied the daughter of Diomed. 'Yet how\ncanst thou contrive it? we may not return until late, they will miss\nthee.'\n\n'Ione is indulgent,' replied Nydia.  'If thou wilt permit me to sleep\nbeneath thy roof, I will say that thou, an early patroness and friend,\nhast invited me to pass the day with thee, and sing thee my Thessalian\nsongs; her courtesy will readily grant to thee so light a boon.'\n\n'Nay, ask for thyself!' said the haughty Julia.  'I stoop to request no\nfavor from the Neapolitan!'\n\n'Well, be it so.  I will take my leave now; make my request, which I\nknow will be readily granted, and return shortly.'\n\n'Do so; and thy bed shall be prepared in my own chamber.' With that,\nNydia left the fair Pompeian.\n\nOn her way back to Ione she was met by the chariot of Glaucus, on whose\nfiery and curveting steeds was riveted the gaze of the crowded street.\n\nHe kindly stopped for a moment to speak to the flower-girl.\n\n'Blooming as thine own roses, my gentle Nydia! and how is thy fair\nmistress?--recovered, I trust, from the effects of the storm?'\n\n'I have not seen her this morning,' answered Nydia, 'but...'\n\n'But what? draw back--the horses are too near thee.'\n\n'But think you Ione will permit me to pass the day with Julia, the\ndaughter of Diomed?--She wishes it, and was kind to me when I had few\nfriends.'\n\n'The gods bless thy grateful heart!  I will answer for Ione's\npermission.'\n\n'Then I may stay over the night, and return to-morrow?' said Nydia,\nshrinking from the praise she so little merited.\n\n'As thou and fair Julia please.  Commend me to her; and hark ye, Nydia,\nwhen thou hearest her speak, note the contrast of her voice with that of\nthe silver-toned Ione.  Vale!'\n\nHis spirits entirely recovered from the effect of the past night, his\nlocks waving in the wind, his joyous and elastic heart bounding with\nevery spring of his Parthian steeds, a very prototype of his country's\ngod, full of youth and of love--Glaucus was borne rapidly to his\nmistress.\n\nEnjoy while ye may the present--who can read the future?\n\nAs the evening darkened, Julia, reclined within her litter, which was\ncapacious enough also to admit her blind companion, took her way to the\nrural baths indicated by Arbaces.  To her natural levity of disposition,\nher enterprise brought less of terror than of pleasurable excitement;\nabove all, she glowed at the thought of her coming triumph over the\nhated Neapolitan.\n\nA small but gay group was collected round the door of the villa, as her\nlitter passed by it to the private entrance of the baths appropriated to\nthe women.\n\n'Methinks, by this dim light,' said one of the bystanders, 'I recognize\nthe slaves of Diomed.'\n\n'True, Clodius,' said Sallust: 'it is probably the litter of his\ndaughter Julia.  She is rich, my friend; why dost thou not proffer thy\nsuit to her?'\n\n'Why, I had once hoped that Glaucus would have married her.  She does\nnot disguise her attachment; and then, as he gambles freely and with\nill-success...'\n\n'The sesterces would have passed to thee, wise Clodius.  A wife is a\ngood thing--when it belongs to another man!'\n\n'But,' continued Clodius, 'as Glaucus is, I understand, to wed the\nNeapolitan, I think I must even try my chance with the dejected maid.\nAfter all, the lamp of Hymen will be gilt, and the vessel will reconcile\none to the odor of the flame.  I shall only protest, my Sallust, against\nDiomed's making thee trustee to his daughter's fortune.'\n\n'Ha! ha! let us within, my comissator; the wine and the garlands wait\nus.'\n\nDismissing her slaves to that part of the house set apart for their\nentertainment, Julia entered the baths with Nydia, and declining the\noffers of the attendants, passed by a private door into the garden\nbehind.\n\n'She comes by appointment, be sure,' said one of the slaves.\n\n'What is that to thee?' said a superintendent, sourly; 'she pays for the\nbaths, and does not waste the saffron.  Such appointments are the best\npart of the trade.  Hark! do you not hear the widow Fulvia clapping her\nhands? Run, fool--run!'\n\nJulia and Nydia, avoiding the more public part of the garden, arrived at\nthe place specified by the Egyptian.  In a small circular plot of grass\nthe stars gleamed upon the statue of Silenus--the merry god reclined\nupon a fragment of rock--the lynx of Bacchus at his feet--and over his\nmouth he held, with extended arm, a bunch of grapes, which he seemingly\nlaughed to welcome ere he devoured.\n\n'I see not the magician,' said Julia, looking round: when, as she spoke,\nthe Egyptian slowly emerged from the neighboring foliage, and the light\nfell palely over his sweeping robes.\n\n'Salve, sweet maiden!--But ha! whom hast thou here? we must have no\ncompanions!'\n\n'It is but the blind flower-girl, wise magician,' replied Julia:\n'herself a Thessalian.'\n\n'Oh! Nydia!' said the Egyptian.  'I know her well.'\n\nNydia drew back and shuddered.\n\n'Thou hast been at my house, methinks!' said he, approaching his voice\nto Nydia's ear; 'thou knowest the oath!--Silence and secrecy, now as\nthen, or beware!'\n\n'Yet,' he added, musingly to himself, 'why confide more than is\nnecessary, even in the blind--Julia, canst thou trust thyself alone with\nme?  Believe me, the magician is less formidable than he seems.'\n\nAs he spoke, he gently drew Julia aside.\n\n'The witch loves not many visitors at once,' said he: 'leave Nydia here\ntill your return; she can be of no assistance to us: and, for\nprotection--your own beauty suffices--your own beauty and your own rank;\nyes, Julia, I know thy name and birth.  Come, trust thyself with me,\nfair rival of the youngest of the Naiads!'\n\nThe vain Julia was not, as we have seen, easily affrighted; she was\nmoved by the flattery of Arbaces, and she readily consented to suffer\nNydia to await her return; nor did Nydia press her presence.  At the\nsound of the Egyptian's voice all her terror of him returned: she felt a\nsentiment of pleasure at learning she was not to travel in his\ncompanionship.\n\nShe returned to the Bath-house, and in one of the private chambers\nwaited their return.  Many and bitter were the thoughts of this wild\ngirl as she sat there in her eternal darkness.  She thought of her own\ndesolate fate, far from her native land, far from the bland cares that\nonce assuaged the April sorrows of childhood--deprived of the light of\nday, with none but strangers to guide her steps, accursed by the one\nsoft feeling of her heart, loving and without hope, save the dim and\nunholy ray which shot across her mind, as her Thessalian fancies\nquestioned of the force of spells and the gifts of magic.\n\nNature had sown in the heart of this poor girl the seeds of virtue\nnever destined to ripen.  The lessons of adversity are not always\nsalutary--sometimes they soften and amend, but as often they indurate\nand pervert. If we consider ourselves more harshly treated by fate than\nthose around us, and do not acknowledge in our own deeds the justice of\nthe severity, we become too apt to deem the world our enemy, to case\nourselves in defiance, to wrestle against our softer self, and to\nindulge the darker passions which are so easily fermented by the sense\nof injustice.  Sold early into slavery, sentenced to a sordid\ntaskmaster, exchanging her situation, only yet more to embitter her\nlot--the kindlier feelings, naturally profuse in the breast of Nydia,\nwere nipped and blighted.  Her sense of right and wrong was confused by\na passion to which she had so madly surrendered herself; and the same\nintense and tragic emotions which we read of in the women of the classic\nage--a Myrrha, a Medea--and which hurried and swept away the whole soul\nwhen once delivered to love--ruled, and rioted in, her breast.\n\nTime passed: a light step entered the chamber where Nydia yet indulged\nher gloomy meditations.\n\n'Oh, thanked be the immortal gods!' said Julia, 'I have returned, I have\nleft that terrible cavern!  Come, Nydia! let us away forthwith!'\n\nIt was not till they were seated in the litter that Julia again spoke.\n\n'Oh!' said she, tremblingly, 'such a scene! such fearful incantations!\nand the dead face of the hag!--But, let us talk not of it.  I have\nobtained the potion--she pledges its effect.  My rival shall be suddenly\nindifferent to his eye, and I, I alone, the idol of Glaucus!'\n\n'Glaucus!' exclaimed Nydia.\n\n'Ay! I told thee, girl, at first, that it was not the Athenian whom I\nloved: but I see now that I may trust thee wholly--it is the beautiful\nGreek!'\n\nWhat then were Nydia's emotions! she had connived, she had assisted, in\ntearing Glaucus from Ione; but only to transfer, by all the power of\nmagic, his affections yet more hopelessly to another.  Her heart swelled\nalmost to suffocation--she gasped for breath--in the darkness of the\nvehicle, Julia did not perceive the agitation of her companion; she went\non rapidly dilating on the promised effect of her acquisition, and on\nher approaching triumph over Ione, every now and then abruptly\ndigressing to the horror of the scene she had quitted--the unmoved mien\nof Arbaces, and his authority over the dreadful Saga.\n\nMeanwhile Nydia recovered her self-possession: a thought flashed across\nher: she slept in the chamber of Julia--she might possess herself of the\npotion.\n\nThey arrived at the house of Diomed, and descended to Julia's apartment,\nwhere the night's repast awaited them.\n\n'Drink, Nydia, thou must be cold, the air was chill to-night; as for me,\nmy veins are yet ice.'\n\nAnd Julia unhesitatingly quaffed deep draughts of the spiced wine.\n\n'Thou hast the potion,' said Nydia; 'let me hold it in my hands. How\nsmall the phial is! of what color is the draught?'\n\n'Clear as crystal,' replied Julia, as she retook the philtre; 'thou\ncouldst not tell it from this water.  The witch assures me it is\ntasteless.  Small though the phial, it suffices for a life's fidelity:\nit is to be poured into any liquid; and Glaucus will only know what he\nhas quaffed by the effect.'\n\n'Exactly like this water in appearance?'\n\n'Yes, sparkling and colorless as this.  How bright it seems! it is as\nthe very essence of moonlit dews.  Bright thing! how thou shinest on my\nhopes through thy crystal vase!'\n\n'And how is it sealed?'\n\n'But by one little stopper--I withdraw it now--the draught gives no\nodor. Strange, that that which speaks to neither sense should thus\ncommand all!'\n\n'Is the effect instantaneous?'\n\n'Usually--but sometimes it remains dormant for a few hours.'\n\n'Oh, how sweet is this perfume!' said Nydia, suddenly, as she took up a\nsmall bottle on the table, and bent over its fragrant contents.\n\n'Thinkest thou so? the bottle is set with gems of some value.  Thou\nwouldst not have the bracelet yestermorn--wilt thou take the bottle?'\n\n'It ought to be such perfumes as these that should remind one who cannot\nsee of the generous Julia.  If the bottle be not too costly...'\n\n'Oh! I have a thousand costlier ones: take it, child!'\n\nNydia bowed her gratitude, and placed the bottle in her vest.\n\n'And the draught would be equally efficacious, whoever administers it?'\n\n'If the most hideous hag beneath the sun bestowed it, such is its\nasserted virtue that Glaucus would deem her beautiful, and none but\nher!'\n\nJulia, warmed by wine, and the reaction of her spirits, was now all\nanimation and delight; she laughed loud, and talked on a hundred\nmatters--nor was it till the night had advanced far towards morning that\nshe summoned her slaves and undressed.\n\nWhen they were dismissed, she said to Nydia, 'I will not suffer this\nholy draught to quit my presence till the hour comes for its use. Lie\nunder my pillow, bright spirit, and give me happy dreams!'\n\nSo saying, she placed the potion under her pillow.  Nydia's heart beat\nviolently.\n\n'Why dost thou drink that unmixed water, Nydia?  Take the wine by its\nside.'\n\n'I am fevered,' replied the blind girl, 'and the water cools me.  I will\nplace this bottle by my bedside, it refreshes in these summer nights,\nwhen the dews of sleep fall not on our lips.  Fair Julia, I must leave\nthee very early--so Ione bids--perhaps before thou art awake; accept,\ntherefore, now my congratulations.'\n\n'Thanks: when next we meet you may find Glaucus at my feet.'\n\nThey had retired to their couches, and Julia, worn out by the excitement\nof the day, soon slept.  But anxious and burning thoughts rolled over\nthe mind of the wakeful Thessalian.  She listened to the calm breathing\nof Julia; and her ear, accustomed to the finest distinctions of sound,\nspeedily assured her of the deep slumber of her companion.\n\n'Now befriend me, Venus!' said she, softly.\n\nShe rose gently, and poured the perfume from the gift of Julia upon the\nmarble floor--she rinsed it several times carefully with the water that\nwas beside her, and then easily finding the bed of Julia (for night to\nher was as day), she pressed her trembling hand under the pillow and\nseized the potion.  Julia stirred not, her breath regularly fanned the\nburning cheek of the blind girl.  Nydia, then, opening the phial, poured\nits contents into the bottle, which easily contained them; and then\nrefilling the former reservoir of the potion with that limpid water\nwhich Julia had assured her it so resembled, she once more placed the\nphial in its former place.  She then stole again to her couch, and\nwaited--with what thoughts!--the dawning day.\n\nThe sun had risen--Julia slept still--Nydia noiselessly dressed herself,\nplaced her treasure carefully in her vest, took up her staff, and\nhastened to quit the house.\n\nThe porter, Medon, saluted her kindly as she descended the steps that\nled to the street: she heard him not; her mind was confused and lost in\nthe whirl of tumultuous thoughts, each thought a passion. She felt the\npure morning air upon her cheek, but it cooled not her scorching veins.\n\n'Glaucus,' she murmured, 'all the love-charms of the wildest magic could\nnot make thee love me as I love thee.  Ione!--ah; away hesitation! away\nremorse! Glaucus, my fate is in thy smile; and thine! hope!  O joy!  O\ntransport, thy fate is in these hands!'\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE FOURTH\n\nChapter I\n\nREFLECTIONS ON THE ZEAL OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS.  TWO MEN COME TO A\nPERILOUS RESOLVE.  WALLS HAVE EARS, PARTICULARLY SACRED WALLS.\n\nWHOEVER regards the early history of Christianity, will perceive how\nnecessary to its triumph was that fierce spirit of zeal, which, fearing\nno danger, accepting no compromise, inspired its champions and sustained\nits martyrs.  In a dominant Church the genius of intolerance betrays its\ncause--in a weak and persecuted Church, the same genius mainly supports.\nIt was necessary to scorn, to loathe, to abhor the creeds of other men,\nin order to conquer the temptations which they presented--it was\nnecessary rigidly to believe not only that the Gospel was the true\nfaith, but the sole true faith that saved, in order to nerve the\ndisciple to the austerity of its doctrine, and to encourage him to the\nsacred and perilous chivalry of converting the Polytheist and the\nHeathen.  The sectarian sternness which confined virtue and heaven to a\nchosen few, which saw demons in other gods, and the penalties of hell in\nother religions--made the believer naturally anxious to convert all to\nwhom he felt the ties of human affection; and the circle thus traced by\nbenevolence to man was yet more widened by a desire for the glory of\nGod.  It was for the honour of the Christian faith that the Christian\nboldly forced its tenets upon the scepticism of some, the repugnance of\nothers, the sage contempt of the philosopher, the pious shudder of the\npeople--his very intolerance supplied him with his fittest instruments\nof success; and the soft Heathen began at last to imagine there must\nindeed be something holy in a zeal wholly foreign to his experience,\nwhich stopped at no obstacle, dreaded no danger, and even at the\ntorture, or on the scaffold, referred a dispute far other than the calm\ndifferences of speculative philosophy to the tribunal of an Eternal\nJudge.  It was thus that the same fervor which made the Churchman of the\nmiddle age a bigot without mercy, made the Christian of the early days a\nhero without fear.\n\nOf these more fiery, daring, and earnest natures, not the least ardent\nwas Olinthus.  No sooner had Apaecides been received by the rites of\nbaptism into the bosom of the Church, than the Nazarene hastened to make\nhim conscious of the impossibility to retain the office and robes of\npriesthood. He could not, it was evident, profess to worship God, and\ncontinue even outwardly to honour the idolatrous altars of the Fiend.\n\nNor was this all, the sanguine and impetuous mind of Olinthus beheld in\nthe power of Apaecides the means of divulging to the deluded people the\njuggling mysteries of the oracular Isis.  He thought Heaven had sent\nthis instrument of his design in order to disabuse the eyes of the\ncrowd, and prepare the way, perchance, for the conversion of a whole\ncity.  He did not hesitate then to appeal to all the new-kindled\nenthusiasm of Apaecides, to arouse his courage, and to stimulate his\nzeal.  They met, according to previous agreement, the evening after the\nbaptism of Apaecides, in the grove of Cybele, which we have before\ndescribed.\n\n'At the next solemn consultation of the oracle,' said Olinthus, as he\nproceeded in the warmth of his address, 'advance yourself to the\nrailing, proclaim aloud to the people the deception they endure, invite\nthem to enter, to be themselves the witness of the gross but artful\nmechanism of imposture thou hast described to me.  Fear not--the Lord,\nwho protected Daniel, shall protect thee; we, the community of\nChristians, will be amongst the crowd; we will urge on the shrinking:\nand in the first flush of the popular indignation and shame, I myself,\nupon those very altars, will plant the palm-branch typical of the\nGospel--and to my tongue shall descend the rushing Spirit of the living\nGod.'\n\nHeated and excited as he was, this suggestion was not unpleasing to\nApaecides.  He was rejoiced at so early an opportunity of distinguishing\nhis faith in his new sect, and to his holier feelings were added those\nof a vindictive loathing at the imposition he had himself suffered, and\na desire to avenge it.  In that sanguine and elastic overbound of\nobstacles (the rashness necessary to all who undertake venturous and\nlofty actions), neither Olinthus nor the proselyte perceived the\nimpediments to the success of their scheme, which might be found in the\nreverent superstition of the people themselves, who would probably be\nloth, before the sacred altars of the great Egyptian goddess, to believe\neven the testimony of her priest against her power.\n\nApaecides then assented to this proposal with a readiness which\ndelighted Olinthus.  They parted with the understanding that Olinthus\nshould confer with the more important of his Christian brethren on his\ngreat enterprise, should receive their advice and the assurances of\ntheir support on the eventful day.  It so chanced that one of the\nfestivals of Isis was to be held on the second day after this\nconference.  The festival proffered a ready occasion for the design.\nThey appointed to meet once more on the next evening at the same spot;\nand in that meeting were finally to be settled the order and details of\nthe disclosure for the following day.\n\nIt happened that the latter part of this conference had been held near\nthe sacellum, or small chapel, which I have described in the early part\nof this work; and so soon as the forms of the Christian and the priest\nhad disappeared from the grove, a dark and ungainly figure emerged from\nbehind the chapel.\n\n'I have tracked you with some effect, my brother flamen,' soliloquised\nthe eavesdropper; 'you, the priest of Isis, have not for mere idle\ndiscussion conferred with this gloomy Christian.  Alas! that I could not\nhear all your precious plot: enough!  I find, at least, that you\nmeditate revealing the sacred mysteries, and that to-morrow you meet\nagain at this place to plan the how and the when. May Osiris sharpen my\nears then, to detect the whole of your unheard-of audacity!  When I have\nlearned more, I must confer at once with Arbaces.  We will frustrate\nyou, my friends, deep as you think yourselves.  At present, my breast is\na locked treasury of your secret.'\n\nThus muttering, Calenus, for it was he, wrapped his robe round him, and\nstrode thoughtfully homeward.\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nA CLASSIC HOST, COOK, AND KITCHEN.  APAECIDES SEEKS IONE.  THEIR\nCONVERSATION.\n\nIT was then the day for Diomed's banquet to the most select of his\nfriends. The graceful Glaucus, the beautiful Ione, the official Pansa,\nthe high-born Clodius, the immortal Fulvius, the exquisite Lepidus, the\nepicurean Sallust, were not the only honourers of his festival.  He\nexpected, also, an invalid senator from Rome (a man of considerable\nrepute and favor at court), and a great warrior from Herculaneum, who\nhad fought with Titus against the Jews, and having enriched himself\nprodigiously in the wars, was always told by his friends that his\ncountry was eternally indebted to his disinterested exertions!  The\nparty, however, extended to a yet greater number: for although,\ncritically speaking, it was, at one time, thought inelegant among the\nRomans to entertain less than three or more than nine at their banquets,\nyet this rule was easily disregarded by the ostentatious. And we are\ntold, indeed, in history, that one of the most splendid of these\nentertainers usually feasted a select party of three hundred. Diomed,\nhowever, more modest, contented himself with doubling the number of the\nMuses.  His party consisted of eighteen, no unfashionable number in the\npresent day.\n\nIt was the morning of Diomed's banquet; and Diomed himself, though he\ngreatly affected the gentleman and the scholar, retained enough of his\nmercantile experience to know that a master's eye makes a ready servant.\nAccordingly, with his tunic ungirdled on his portly stomach, his easy\nslippers on his feet, a small wand in his hand, wherewith he now\ndirected the gaze, and now corrected the back, of some duller menial, he\nwent from chamber to chamber of his costly villa.\n\nHe did not disdain even a visit to that sacred apartment in which the\npriests of the festival prepare their offerings.  On entering the\nkitchen, his ears were agreeably stunned by the noise of dishes and\npans, of oaths and commands.  Small as this indispensable chamber seems\nto have been in all the houses of Pompeii, it was, nevertheless, usually\nfitted up with all that amazing variety of stoves and shapes, stew-pans\nand saucepans, cutters and moulds, without which a cook of spirit, no\nmatter whether he be an ancient or a modern, declares it utterly\nimpossible that he can give you anything to eat. And as fuel was then,\nas now, dear and scarce in those regions, great seems to have been the\ndexterity exercised in preparing as many things as possible with as\nlittle fire.  An admirable contrivance of this nature may be still seen\nin the Neapolitan Museum, viz., a portable kitchen, about the size of a\nfolio volume, containing stoves for four dishes, and an apparatus for\nheating water or other beverages.\n\nAcross the small kitchen flitted many forms which the quick eye of the\nmaster did not recognize.\n\n'Oh! oh!' grumbled he to himself, 'that cursed Congrio hath invited a\nwhole legion of cooks to assist him.  They won't serve for nothing, and\nthis is another item in the total of my day's expenses. By Bacchus!\nthrice lucky shall I be if the slaves do not help themselves to some of\nthe drinking vessels: ready, alas, are their hands, capacious are their\ntunics.  Me miserum!'\n\nThe cooks, however, worked on, seemingly heedless of the apparition of\nDiomed.\n\n'Ho, Euclio, your egg-pan!  What, is this the largest? it only holds\nthirty-three eggs: in the houses I usually serve, the smallest egg-pan\nholds fifty, if need be!'\n\n'The unconscionable rogue!' thought Diomed; 'he talks of eggs as if they\nwere a sesterce a hundred!'\n\n'By Mercury!' cried a pert little culinary disciple, scarce in his\nnovitiate; 'whoever saw such antique sweetmeat shapes as these?--It is\nimpossible to do credit to one's art with such rude materials.  Why,\nSallust's commonest sweetmeat shape represents the whole siege of Troy;\nHector and Paris, and Helen...  with little Astyanax and the Wooden\nHorse into the bargain!'\n\n'Silence, fool!' said Congrio, the cook of the house, who seemed to\nleave the chief part of the battle to his allies.  'My master, Diomed,\nis not one of those expensive good-for-noughts, who must have the last\nfashion, cost what it will!'\n\n'Thou liest, base slave!' cried Diomed, in a great passion--and thou\ncostest me already enough to have ruined Lucullus himself!  Come out of\nthy den, I want to talk to thee.'\n\nThe slave, with a sly wink at his confederates, obeyed the command.\n\n'Man of three letters,' said Diomed, with his face of solemn anger, 'how\ndidst thou dare to invite all those rascals into my house?--I see thief\nwritten in every line of their faces.'\n\n'Yet, I assure you, master, that they are men of most respectable\ncharacter--the best cooks of the place; it is a great favor to get them.\nBut for my sake...'\n\n'Thy sake, unhappy Congrio!' interrupted Diomed; and by what purloined\nmoneys of mine, by what reserved filchings from marketing, by what\ngoodly meats converted into grease, and sold in the suburbs, by what\nfalse charges for bronzes marred, and earthenware broken--hast thou been\nenabled to make them serve thee for thy sake?'\n\n'Nay, master, do not impeach my honesty!  May the gods desert me if...'\n\n'Swear not!' again interrupted the choleric Diomed, 'for then the gods\nwill smite thee for a perjurer, and I shall lose my cook on the eve of\ndinner. But, enough of this at present: keep a sharp eye on thy\nill-favored assistants, and tell me no tales to-morrow of vases broken,\nand cups miraculously vanished, or thy whole back shall be one pain.\nAnd hark thee! thou knowest thou hast made me pay for those Phrygian\nattagens enough, by Hercules, to have feasted a sober man for a year\ntogether--see that they be not one iota over-roasted.  The last time, O\nCongrio, that I gave a banquet to my friends, when thy vanity did so\nboldly undertake the becoming appearance of a Melian crane--thou knowest\nit came up like a stone from AEtna--as if all the fires of Phlegethon\nhad been scorching out its juices. Be modest this time, Congrio--wary\nand modest.  Modesty is the nurse of great actions; and in all other\nthings, as in this, if thou wilt not spare thy master's purse, at least\nconsult thy master's glory.'\n\n'There shall not be such a coena seen at Pompeii since the days of\nHercules.'\n\n'Softly, softly--thy cursed boasting again!  But I say, Congrio, yon\nhomunculus--yon pigmy assailant of my cranes--yon pert-tongued neophyte\nof the kitchen, was there aught but insolence on his tongue when he\nmaligned the comeliness of my sweetmeat shapes?  I would not be out of\nthe fashion, Congrio.'\n\n'It is but the custom of us cooks,' replied Congrio, gravely, to\nundervalue our tools, in order to increase the effect of our art. The\nsweetmeat shape is a fair shape, and a lovely; but I would recommend my\nmaster, at the first occasion, to purchase some new ones of a...'\n\n'That will suffice,' exclaimed Diomed, who seemed resolved never to\nallow his slave to finish his sentences.  'Now, resume thy\ncharge--shine----eclipse thyself.  Let men envy Diomed his cook--let the\nslaves of Pompeii style thee Congrio the great!  Go! yet stay--thou hast\nnot spent all the moneys I gave thee for the marketing?'\n\n'\"All!\" alas! the nightingales' tongues and the Roman tomacula, and the\noysters from Britain, and sundry other things, too numerous now to\nrecite, are yet left unpaid for.  But what matter? every one trusts the\nArchimagirus of Diomed the wealthy!'\n\n'Oh, unconscionable prodigal!--what waste!--what profusion!--I am\nruined! But go, hasten--inspect!--taste!--perform!--surpass thyself!\nLet the Roman senator not despise the poor Pompeian.  Away, slave--and\nremember, the Phrygian attagens.'\n\nThe chief disappeared within his natural domain, and Diomed rolled back\nhis portly presence to the more courtly chambers.  All was to his\nliking--the flowers were fresh, the fountains played briskly, the mosaic\npavements were as smooth as mirrors.\n\n'Where is my daughter Julia?' he asked.\n\n'At the bath.'\n\n'Ah! that reminds me!--time wanes!--and I must bathe also.'\n\nOur story returns to Apaecides.  On awaking that day from the broken and\nfeverish sleep which had followed his adoption of a faith so strikingly\nand sternly at variance with that in which his youth had been nurtured,\nthe young priest could scarcely imagine that he was not yet in a dream;\nhe had crossed the fatal river--the past was henceforth to have no\nsympathy with the future; the two worlds were distinct and\nseparate--that which had been, from that which was to be. To what a bold\nand adventurous enterprise he had pledged his life!--to unveil the\nmysteries in which he had participated--to desecrate the altars he had\nserved--to denounce the goddess whose ministering robe he wore!  Slowly\nhe became sensible of the hatred and the horror he should provoke\namongst the pious, even if successful; if frustrated in his daring\nattempt, what penalties might he not incur for an offence hitherto\nunheard of--for which no specific law, derived from experience, was\nprepared; and which, for that very reason, precedents, dragged from the\nsharpest armoury of obsolete and inapplicable legislation, would\nprobably be distorted to meet!  His friends--the sister of his\nyouth--could he expect justice, though he might receive compassion, from\nthem? This brave and heroic act would by their heathen eyes be regarded,\nperhaps, as a heinous apostasy--at the best as a pitiable madness.\n\nHe dared, he renounced, everything in this world, in the hope of\nsecuring that eternity in the next, which had so suddenly been revealed\nto him. While these thoughts on the one hand invaded his breast, on the\nother hand his pride, his courage, and his virtue, mingled with\nreminiscences of revenge for deceit, of indignant disgust at fraud,\nconspired to raise and to support him.\n\nThe conflict was sharp and keen; but his new feelings triumphed over his\nold: and a mighty argument in favor of wrestling with the sanctities of\nold opinions and hereditary forms might be found in the conquest over\nboth, achieved by that humble priest.  Had the early Christians been\nmore controlled by 'the solemn plausibilities of custom'--less of\ndemocrats in the pure and lofty acceptation of that perverted\nword--Christianity would have perished in its cradle!\n\nAs each priest in succession slept several nights together in the\nchambers of the temple, the term imposed on Apaecides was not yet\ncompleted; and when he had risen from his couch, attired himself, as\nusual, in his robes, and left his narrow chamber, he found himself\nbefore the altars of the temple.\n\nIn the exhaustion of his late emotions he had slept far into the\nmorning, and the vertical sun already poured its fervid beams over the\nsacred place.\n\n'Salve, Apaecides!' said a voice, whose natural asperity was smoothed by\nlong artifice into an almost displeasing softness of tone. 'Thou art\nlate abroad; has the goddess revealed herself to thee in visions?'\n\n'Could she reveal her true self to the people, Calenus, how incenseless\nwould be these altars!'\n\n'That,' replied Calenus, 'may possibly be true; but the deity is wise\nenough to hold commune with none but priests.'\n\n'A time may come when she will be unveiled without her own\nacquiescence.'\n\n'It is not likely: she has triumphed for countless ages.  And that which\nhas so long stood the test of time rarely succumbs to the lust of\nnovelty.  But hark ye, young brother! these sayings are indiscreet.'\n\n'It is not for thee to silence them,' replied Apaecides, haughtily.\n\n'So hot!--yet I will not quarrel with thee.  Why, my Apaecides, has not\nthe Egyptian convinced thee of the necessity of our dwelling together in\nunity? Has he not convinced thee of the wisdom of deluding the people\nand enjoying ourselves?  If not, oh, brother! he is not that great\nmagician he is esteemed.'\n\n'Thou, then, hast shared his lessons?' said Apaecides, with a hollow\nsmile.\n\n'Ay! but I stood less in need of them than thou.  Nature had already\ngifted me with the love of pleasure, and the desire of gain and power.\nLong is the way that leads the voluptuary to the severities of life; but\nit is only one step from pleasant sin to sheltering hypocrisy.  Beware\nthe vengeance of the goddess, if the shortness of that step be\ndisclosed!'\n\n'Beware, thou, the hour when the tomb shall be rent and the rottenness\nexposed,' returned Apaecides, solemnly.  'Vale!'\n\nWith these words he left the flamen to his meditations.  When he got a\nfew paces from the temple, he turned to look back.  Calenus had already\ndisappeared in the entry room of the priests, for it now approached the\nhour of that repast which, called prandium by the ancients, answers in\npoint of date to the breakfast of the moderns. The white and graceful\nfane gleamed brightly in the sun.  Upon the altars before it rose the\nincense and bloomed the garlands.  The priest gazed long and wistfully\nupon the scene--it was the last time that it was ever beheld by him!\n\nHe then turned and pursued his way slowly towards the house of Ione; for\nbefore possibly the last tie that united them was cut in twain--before\nthe uncertain peril of the next day was incurred, he was anxious to see\nhis last surviving relative, his fondest as his earliest friend.\n\nHe arrived at her house, and found her in the garden with Nydia.\n\n'This is kind, Apaecides,' said Ione, joyfully; 'and how eagerly have I\nwished to see thee!--what thanks do I not owe thee?  How churlish hast\nthou been to answer none of my letters--to abstain from coming hither to\nreceive the expressions of my gratitude!  Oh! thou hast assisted to\npreserve thy sister from dishonour!  What, what can she say to thank\nthee, now thou art come at last?'\n\n'My sweet Ione, thou owest me no gratitude, for thy cause was mine.  Let\nus avoid that subject, let us recur not to that impious man--how hateful\nto both of us!  I may have a speedy opportunity to teach the world the\nnature of his pretended wisdom and hypocritical severity.  But let us\nsit down, my sister; I am wearied with the heat of the sun; let us sit\nin yonder shade, and, for a little while longer, be to each other what\nwe have been.'\n\nBeneath a wide plane-tree, with the cistus and the arbutus clustering\nround them, the living fountain before, the greensward beneath their\nfeet; the gay cicada, once so dear to Athens, rising merrily ever and\nanon amidst the grass; the butterfly, beautiful emblem of the soul,\ndedicated to Psyche, and which has continued to furnish illustrations to\nthe Christian bard, rich in the glowing colors caught from Sicilian\nskies, hovering about the sunny flowers, itself like a winged flower--in\nthis spot, and this scene, the brother and the sister sat together for\nthe last time on earth. You may tread now on the same place; but the\ngarden is no more, the columns are shattered, the fountain has ceased to\nplay.  Let the traveler search amongst the ruins of Pompeii for the\nhouse of Ione. Its remains are yet visible; but I will not betray them\nto the gaze of commonplace tourists.  He who is more sensitive than the\nherd will discover them easily: when he has done so, let him keep the\nsecret.\n\nThey sat down, and Nydia, glad to be alone, retired to the farther end\nof the garden.\n\n'Ione, my sister,' said the young convert, 'place your hand upon my\nbrow; let me feel your cool touch.  Speak to me, too, for your gentle\nvoice is like a breeze that hath freshness as well as music. Speak to\nme, but forbear to bless me!  Utter not one word of those forms of\nspeech which our childhood was taught to consider sacred!'\n\n'Alas! and what then shall I say?  Our language of affection is so woven\nwith that of worship, that the words grow chilled and trite if I banish\nfrom them allusion to our gods.'\n\n'Our gods!' murmured Apaecides, with a shudder: 'thou slightest my\nrequest already.'\n\n'Shall I speak then to thee only of Isis?'\n\n'The Evil Spirit!  No, rather be dumb for ever, unless at least thou\ncanst--but away, away this talk!  Not now will we dispute and cavil; not\nnow will we judge harshly of each other.  Thou, regarding me as an\napostate! and I all sorrow and shame for thee as an idolater. No, my\nsister, let us avoid such topics and such thoughts.  In thy sweet\npresence a calm falls over my spirit.  For a little while I forget.  As\nI thus lay my temples on thy bosom, as I thus feel thy gentle arm\nembrace me, I think that we are children once more, and that the heaven\nsmiles equally upon both.  For oh! if hereafter I escape, no matter what\nperil; and it be permitted me to address thee on one sacred and awful\nsubject; should I find thine ear closed and thy heart hardened, what\nhope for myself could countervail the despair for thee?  In thee, my\nsister, I behold a likeness made beautiful, made noble, of myself.\nShall the mirror live for ever, and the form itself be broken as the\npotter's clay?  Ah, no--no--thou wilt listen to me yet!  Dost thou\nremember how we went into the fields by Baiae, hand in hand together, to\npluck the flowers of spring?  Even so, hand in hand, shall we enter the\nEternal Garden, and crown ourselves with imperishable asphodel!'\n\nWondering and bewildered by words she could not comprehend, but excited\neven to tears by the plaintiveness of their tone, Ione listened to these\noutpourings of a full and oppressed heart.  In truth, Apaecides himself\nwas softened much beyond his ordinary mood, which to outward seeming was\nusually either sullen or impetuous.  For the noblest desires are of a\njealous nature--they engross, they absorb the soul, and often leave the\nsplenetic humors stagnant and unheeded at the surface.  Unheeding the\npetty things around us, we are deemed morose; impatient at earthly\ninterruption to the diviner dreams, we are thought irritable and\nchurlish.  For as there is no chimera vainer than the hope that one\nhuman heart shall find sympathy in another, so none ever interpret us\nwith justice; and none, no, not our nearest and our dearest ties,\nforbear with us in mercy!  When we are dead and repentance comes too\nlate, both friend and foe may wonder to think how little there was in us\nto forgive!\n\n'I will talk to thee then of our early years,' said Ione.  'Shall yon\nblind girl sing to thee of the days of childhood?  Her voice is sweet\nand musical, and she hath a song on that theme which contains none of\nthose allusions it pains thee to hear.'\n\n'Dost thou remember the words, my sister?' asked Apaecides.\n\n'Methinks yes; for the tune, which is simple, fixed them on my memory.'\n\n'Sing to me then thyself.  My ear is not in unison with unfamiliar\nvoices; and thine, Ione, full of household associations, has ever been\nto me more sweet than all the hireling melodies of Lycia or of Crete.\nSing to me!'\n\nIone beckoned to a slave that stood in the portico, and sending for her\nlute, sang, when it arrived, to a tender and simple air, the following\nverses:--\n\n              REGRETS FOR CHILDHOOD\n\n                    I\n\n         It is not that our earlier Heaven\n              Escapes its April showers,\n          Or that to childhood's heart is given\n              No snake amidst the flowers.\n                 Ah! twined with grief\n                 Each brightest leaf,\n              That's wreath'd us by the Hours!\n          Young though we be, the Past may sting,\n              The present feed its sorrow;\n          But hope shines bright on every thing\n              That waits us with the morrow.\n                 Like sun-lit glades,\n                 The dimmest shades\n              Some rosy beam can borrow.\n\n                    II\n\n         It is not that our later years\n              Of cares are woven wholly,\n          But smiles less swiftly chase the tears,\n              And wounds are healed more slowly.\n                 And Memory's vow\n                 To lost ones now,\n              Makes joys too bright, unholy.\n          And ever fled the Iris bow\n              That smiled when clouds were o'er us.\n          If storms should burst, uncheered we go,\n              A drearier waste before us--\n                And with the toys\n                 Of childish joys,\n              We've broke the staff that bore us!\n\nWisely and delicately had Ione chosen that song, sad though its burthen\nseemed; for when we are deeply mournful, discordant above all others is\nthe voice of mirth: the fittest spell is that borrowed from melancholy\nitself, for dark thoughts can be softened down when they cannot be\nbrightened; and so they lose the precise and rigid outline of their\ntruth, and their colors melt into the ideal.  As the leech applies in\nremedy to the internal sore some outward irritation, which, by a gentler\nwound, draws away the venom of that which is more deadly, thus, in the\nrankling festers of the mind, our art is to divert to a milder sadness\non the surface the pain that gnaweth at the core.  And so with\nApaecides, yielding to the influence of the silver voice that reminded\nhim of the past, and told but of half the sorrow born to the present, he\nforgot his more immediate and fiery sources of anxious thought.  He\nspent hours in making Ione alternately sing to, and converse with him;\nand when he rose to leave her, it was with a calmed and lulled mind.\n\n'Ione,' said he, as he pressed her hand, 'should you hear my name\nblackened and maligned, will you credit the aspersion?'\n\n'Never, my brother, never!'\n\n'Dost thou not imagine, according to thy belief, that the evil-doer is\npunished hereafter, and the good rewarded?'\n\n'Can you doubt it?'\n\n'Dost thou think, then, that he who is truly good should sacrifice every\nselfish interest in his zeal for virtue?'\n\n'He who doth so is the equal of the gods.'\n\n'And thou believest that, according to the purity and courage with which\nhe thus acts, shall be his portion of bliss beyond the grave?'\n\n'So we are taught to hope.'\n\n'Kiss me, my sister.  One question more.  Thou art to be wedded to\nGlaucus: perchance that marriage may separate us more hopelessly--but\nnot of this speak I now--thou art to be married to Glaucus--dost thou\nlove him?  Nay, my sister, answer me by words.'\n\n'Yes!' murmured Ione, blushing.\n\n'Dost thou feel that, for his sake, thou couldst renounce pride, brave\ndishonour, and incur death?  I have heard that when women really love,\nit is to that excess.'\n\n'My brother, all this could I do for Glaucus, and feel that it were not\na sacrifice.  There is no sacrifice to those who love, in what is borne\nfor the one we love.'\n\n'Enough! shall woman feel thus for man, and man feel less devotion to\nhis God?'\n\nHe spoke no more.  His whole countenance seemed instinct and inspired\nwith a divine life: his chest swelled proudly; his eyes glowed: on his\nforehead was writ the majesty of a man who can dare to be noble!  He\nturned to meet the eyes of Ione--earnest, wistful, fearful--he kissed\nher fondly, strained her warmly to his breast, and in a moment more he\nhad left the house.\n\nLong did Ione remain in the same place, mute and thoughtful.  The\nmaidens again and again came to warn her of the deepening noon, and her\nengagement to Diomed's banquet.  At length she woke from her reverie,\nand prepared, not with the pride of beauty, but listless and melancholy,\nfor the festival: one thought alone reconciled her to the promised\nvisit--she should meet Glaucus--she could confide to him her alarm and\nuneasiness for her brother.\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nA FASHIONABLE PARTY AND A DINNER A LA MODE IN POMPEII.\n\nMEANWHILE Sallust and Glaucus were slowly strolling towards the house of\nDiomed.  Despite the habits of his life, Sallust was not devoid of many\nestimable qualities.  He would have been an active friend, a useful\ncitizen--in short, an excellent man, if he had not taken it into his\nhead to be a philosopher.  Brought up in the schools in which Roman\nplagiarism worshipped the echo of Grecian wisdom, he had imbued himself\nwith those doctrines by which the later Epicureans corrupted the simple\nmaxims of their great master.  He gave himself altogether up to\npleasure, and imagined there was no sage like a boon companion.  Still,\nhowever, he had a considerable degree of learning, wit, and good nature;\nand the hearty frankness of his very vices seemed like virtue itself\nbeside the utter corruption of Clodius and the prostrate effeminacy of\nLepidus; and therefore Glaucus liked him the best of his companions; and\nhe, in turn, appreciating the nobler qualities of the Athenian, loved\nhim almost as much as a cold muraena, or a bowl of the best Falernian.\n\n'This is a vulgar old fellow, this Diomed,' said Sallust: 'but he has\nsome good qualities--in his cellar!'\n\n'And some charming ones--in his daughter.'\n\n'True, Glaucus: but you are not much moved by them, methinks.  I fancy\nClodius is desirous to be your successor.'\n\n'He is welcome.  At the banquet of Julia's beauty, no guest, be sure, is\nconsidered a musca.'\n\n'You are severe: but she has, indeed, something of the Corinthian about\nher--they will be well matched, after all!  What good-natured fellows we\nare to associate with that gambling good-for-nought.'\n\n'Pleasure unites strange varieties,' answered Glaucus.  'He amuses\nme...'\n\n'And flatters--but then he pays himself well!  He powders his praise\nwith gold-dust.'\n\n'You often hint that he plays unfairly--think you so really?'\n\n'My dear Glaucus, a Roman noble has his dignity to keep up--dignity is\nvery expensive--Clodius must cheat like a scoundrel, in order to live\nlike a gentleman.'\n\n'Ha ha!--well, of late I have renounced the dice.  Ah! Sallust, when I\nam wedded to Ione, I trust I may yet redeem a youth of follies. We are\nboth born for better things than those in which we sympathize now--born\nto render our worship in nobler temples than the stye of Epicurus.'\n\n'Alas!' returned Sallust, in rather a melancholy tone, 'what do we know\nmore than this--life is short--beyond the grave all is dark? There is no\nwisdom like that which says \"enjoy\".'\n\n'By Bacchus!  I doubt sometimes if we do enjoy the utmost of which life\nis capable.'\n\n'I am a moderate man,' returned Sallust, 'and do not ask \"the utmost\".\nWe are like malefactors, and intoxicate ourselves with wine and myrrh,\nas we stand on the brink of death; but, if we did not do so, the abyss\nwould look very disagreeable.  I own that I was inclined to be gloomy\nuntil I took so heartily to drinking--that is a new life, my Glaucus.'\n\n'Yes! but it brings us next morning to a new death.'\n\n'Why, the next morning is unpleasant, I own; but, then, if it were not\nso, one would never be inclined to read.  I study betimes--because, by\nthe gods! I am generally unfit for anything else till noon.'\n\n'Fie, Scythian!'\n\n'Pshaw! the fate of Pentheus to him who denies Bacchus.'\n\n'Well, Sallust, with all your faults, you are the best profligate I ever\nmet: and verily, if I were in danger of life, you are the only man in\nall Italy who would stretch out a finger to save me.'\n\n'Perhaps I should not, if it were in the middle of supper.  But, in\ntruth, we Italians are fearfully selfish.'\n\n'So are all men who are not free,' said Glaucus, with a sigh. 'Freedom\nalone makes men sacrifice to each other.'\n\n'Freedom, then, must be a very fatiguing thing to an Epicurean,'\nanswered Sallust.  'But here we are at our host's.'\n\nAs Diomed's villa is one of the most considerable in point of size of\nany yet discovered at Pompeii, and is, moreover, built much according to\nthe specific instructions for a suburban villa laid down by the Roman\narchitect, it may not be uninteresting briefly to describe the plan of\nthe apartments through which our visitors passed.\n\nThey entered, then, by the same small vestibule at which we have before\nbeen presented to the aged Medon, and passed at once into a colonnade,\ntechnically termed the peristyle; for the main difference between the\nsuburban villa and the town mansion consisted in placing, in the first,\nthe said colonnade in exactly the same place as that which in the town\nmansion was occupied by the atrium.  In the centre of the peristyle was\nan open court, which contained the impluvium.\n\nFrom this peristyle descended a staircase to the offices; another narrow\npassage on the opposite side communicated with a garden; various small\napartments surrounded the colonnade, appropriated probably to country\nvisitors.  Another door to the left on entering communicated with a\nsmall triangular portico, which belonged to the baths; and behind was\nthe wardrobe, in which were kept the vests of the holiday suits of the\nslaves, and, perhaps, of the master.  Seventeen centuries afterwards\nwere found those relics of ancient finery calcined and crumbling: kept\nlonger, alas! than their thrifty lord foresaw.\n\nReturn we to the peristyle, and endeavor now to present to the reader a\ncoup d'oeil of the whole suite of apartments, which immediately\nstretched before the steps of the visitors.\n\nLet him then first imagine the columns of the portico, hung with\nfestoons of flowers; the columns themselves in the lower part painted\nred, and the walls around glowing with various frescoes; then, looking\nbeyond a curtain, three parts drawn aside, the eye caught the tablinum\nor saloon (which was closed at will by glazed doors, now slid back into\nthe walls).  On either side of this tablinum were small rooms, one of\nwhich was a kind of cabinet of gems; and these apartments, as well as\nthe tablinum, communicated with a long gallery, which opened at either\nend upon terraces; and between the terraces, and communicating with the\ncentral part of the gallery, was a hall, in which the banquet was that\nday prepared.  All these apartments, though almost on a level with the\nstreet, were one story above the garden; and the terraces communicating\nwith the gallery were continued into corridors, raised above the pillars\nwhich, to the right and left, skirted the garden below.\n\nBeneath, and on a level with the garden, ran the apartments we have\nalready described as chiefly appropriated to Julia.\n\nIn the gallery, then, just mentioned, Diomed received his guests.\n\nThe merchant affected greatly the man of letters, and, therefore, he\nalso affected a passion for everything Greek; he paid particular\nattention to Glaucus.\n\n'You will see, my friend,' said he, with a wave of his hand, 'that I am\na little classical here--a little Cecropian--eh?  The hall in which we\nshall sup is borrowed from the Greeks.  It is an OEcus Cyzicene.  Noble\nSallust, they have not, I am told, this sort of apartment in Rome.'\n\n'Oh!' replied Sallust, with a half smile; 'you Pompeians combine all\nthat is most eligible in Greece and in Rome; may you, Diomed, combine\nthe viands as well as the architecture!'\n\n'You shall see--you shall see, my Sallust,' replied the merchant.  'We\nhave a taste at Pompeii, and we have also money.'\n\n'They are two excellent things,' replied Sallust.  'But, behold, the\nlady Julia!'\n\nThe main difference, as I have before remarked, in the manner of life\nobserved among the Athenians and Romans, was, that with the first, the\nmodest women rarely or never took part in entertainments; with the\nlatter, they were the common ornaments of the banquet; but when they\nwere present at the feast, it usually terminated at an early hour.\n\nMagnificently robed in white, interwoven with pearls and threads of\ngold, the handsome Julia entered the apartment.\n\nScarcely had she received the salutation of the two guests, ere Pansa\nand his wife, Lepidus, Clodius, and the Roman senator, entered almost\nsimultaneously; then came the widow Fulvia; then the poet Fulvius, like\nto the widow in name if in nothing else; the warrior from Herculaneum,\naccompanied by his umbra, next stalked in; afterwards, the less eminent\nof the guests.  Ione yet tarried.\n\nIt was the mode among the courteous ancients to flatter whenever it was\nin their power: accordingly it was a sign of ill-breeding to seat\nthemselves immediately on entering the house of their host.  After\nperforming the salutation, which was usually accomplished by the same\ncordial shake of the right hand which we ourselves retain, and\nsometimes, by the yet more familiar embrace, they spent several minutes\nin surveying the apartment, and admiring the bronzes, the pictures, or\nthe furniture, with which it was adorned--a mode very impolite according\nto our refined English notions, which place good breeding in\nindifference.  We would not for the world express much admiration of\nanother man's house, for fear it should be thought we had never seen\nanything so fine before!\n\n'A beautiful statue this of Bacchus!' said the Roman senator.\n\n'A mere trifle!' replied Diomed.\n\n'What charming paintings!' said Fulvia.\n\n'Mere trifles!' answered the owner.\n\n'Exquisite candelabra!' cried the warrior.\n\n'Exquisite!' echoed his umbra.\n\n'Trifles! trifles!' reiterated the merchant.\n\nMeanwhile, Glaucus found himself by one of the windows of the gallery,\nwhich communicated with the terraces, and the fair Julia by his side.\n\n'Is it an Athenian virtue, Glaucus,' said the merchant's daughter, 'to\nshun those whom we once sought?'\n\n'Fair Julia--no!'\n\n'Yet methinks, it is one of the qualities of Glaucus.'\n\n'Glaucus never shuns a friend!' replied the Greek, with some emphasis on\nthe last word.\n\n'May Julia rank among the number of his friends?'\n\n'It would be an honour to the emperor to find a friend in one so\nlovely.'\n\n'You evade my question,' returned the enamoured Julia.  'But tell me, is\nit true that you admire the Neapolitan Ione?'\n\n'Does not beauty constrain our admiration?'\n\n'Ah! subtle Greek, still do you fly the meaning of my words.  But say,\nshall Julia be indeed your friend?'\n\n'If she will so favor me, blessed be the gods!  The day in which I am\nthus honored shall be ever marked in white.'\n\n'Yet, even while you speak, your eye is resting--your color comes and\ngoes--you move away involuntarily--you are impatient to join Ione!'\n\nFor at that moment Ione had entered, and Glaucus had indeed betrayed the\nemotion noticed by the jealous beauty.\n\n'Can admiration to one woman make me unworthy the friendship of another?\nSanction not so, O Julia the libels of the poets on your sex!'\n\n'Well, you are right--or I will learn to think so.  Glaucus, yet one\nmoment! You are to wed Ione; is it not so?'\n\n'If the Fates permit, such is my blessed hope.'\n\n'Accept, then, from me, in token of our new friendship, a present for\nyour bride.  Nay, it is the custom of friends, you know, always to\npresent to bride and bridegroom some such little marks of their esteem\nand favoring wishes.'\n\n'Julia! I cannot refuse any token of friendship from one like you. I\nwill accept the gift as an omen from Fortune herself.'\n\n'Then, after the feast, when the guests retire, you will descend with me\nto my apartment, and receive it from my hands.  Remember!' said Julia,\nas she joined the wife of Pansa, and left Glaucus to seek Ione.\n\nThe widow Fulvia and the spouse of the aedile were engaged in high and\ngrave discussion.\n\n'O Fulvia! I assure you that the last account from Rome declares that\nthe frizzling mode of dressing the hair is growing antiquated; they only\nnow wear it built up in a tower, like Julia's, or arranged as a\nhelmet--the Galerian fashion, like mine, you see: it has a fine effect,\nI think. I assure you, Vespius (Vespius was the name of the Herculaneum\nhero) admires it greatly.'\n\n'And nobody wears the hair like yon Neapolitan, in the Greek way.'\n\n'What, parted in front, with the knot behind?  Oh, no; how ridiculous it\nis! it reminds one of the statue of Diana!  Yet this Ione is handsome,\neh?'\n\n'So the men say; but then she is rich: she is to marry the Athenian--I\nwish her joy.  He will not be long faithful, I suspect; those foreigners\nare very faithless.'\n\n'Oh, Julia!' said Fulvia, as the merchant's daughter joined them; 'have\nyou seen the tiger yet?'\n\n'No!'\n\n'Why, all the ladies have been to see him.  He is so handsome!'\n\n'I hope we shall find some criminal or other for him and the lion,'\nreplied Julia.  'Your husband (turning to Pansa's wife) is not so active\nas he should be in this matter.'\n\n'Why, really, the laws are too mild,' replied the dame of the helmet.\n'There are so few offences to which the punishment of the arena can be\nawarded; and then, too, the gladiators are growing effeminate!  The\nstoutest bestiarii declare they are willing enough to fight a boar or a\nbull; but as for a lion or a tiger, they think the game too much in\nearnest.'\n\n'They are worthy of a mitre,' replied Julia, in disdain.\n\n'Oh! have you seen the new house of Fulvius, the dear poet?' said\nPansa's wife.\n\n'No: is it handsome?'\n\n'Very!--such good taste.  But they say, my dear, that he has such\nimproper pictures!  He won't show them to the women: how ill-bred!'\n\n'Those poets are always odd,' said the widow.  'But he is an interesting\nman; what pretty verses he writes!  We improve very much in poetry: it\nis impossible to read the old stuff now.'\n\n'I declare I am of your opinion, returned the lady of the helmet.\n'There is so much more force and energy in the modern school.'\n\nThe warrior sauntered up to the ladies.\n\n'It reconciles me to peace,' said he, 'when I see such faces.'\n\n'Oh!  you heroes are ever flatterers,' returned Fulvia, hastening to\nappropriate the compliment specially to herself.\n\n'By this chain, which I received from the emperor's own hand,' replied\nthe warrior, playing with a short chain which hung round the neck like a\ncollar, instead of descending to the breast, according to the fashion of\nthe peaceful--'By this chain, you wrong me!  I am a blunt man--a soldier\nshould be so.'\n\n'How do you find the ladies of Pompeii generally?' said Julia.\n\n'By Venus, most beautiful!  They favor me a little, it is true, and that\ninclines my eyes to double their charms.'\n\n'We love a warrior,' said the wife of Pansa.\n\n'I see it: by Hercules! it is even disagreeable to be too celebrated in\nthese cities.  At Herculaneum they climb the roof of my atrium to catch\na glimpse of me through the compluvium; the admiration of one's citizens\nis pleasant at first, but burthensome afterwards.'\n\n'True, true, O Vespius!' cried the poet, joining the group: 'I find it\nso myself.'\n\n'You!' said the stately warrior, scanning the small form of the poet\nwith ineffable disdain.  'In what legion have you served?'\n\n'You may see my spoils, my exuviae, in the forum itself,' returned the\npoet, with a significant glance at the women.  'I have been among the\ntent-companions, the contubernales, of the great Mantuan himself.'\n\n'I know no general from Mantua, said the warrior, gravely.  'What\ncampaign have you served?'\n\n'That of Helicon.'\n\n'I never heard of it.'\n\n'Nay, Vespius, he does but joke,' said Julia, laughing.\n\n'Joke!  By Mars, am I a man to be joked!'\n\n'Yes; Mars himself was in love with the mother of jokes,' said the poet,\na little alarmed.  'Know, then, O Vespius! that I am the poet Fulvius.\nIt is I who make warriors immortal!'\n\n'The gods forbid!' whispered Sallust to Julia.  'If Vespius were made\nimmortal, what a specimen of tiresome braggadocio would be transmitted\nto posterity!'\n\nThe soldier looked puzzled; when, to the infinite relief of himself and\nhis companions, the signal for the feast was given.\n\nAs we have already witnessed at the house of Glaucus the ordinary\nroutine of a Pompeian entertainment, the reader is spared any second\ndetail of the courses, and the manner in which they were introduced.\n\nDiomed, who was rather ceremonious, had appointed a nomenclator, or\nappointer of places to each guest.\n\nThe reader understands that the festive board was composed of three\ntables; one at the centre, and one at each wing.  It was only at the\nouter side of these tables that the guests reclined; the inner space was\nleft untenanted, for the greater convenience of the waiters or ministri.\nThe extreme corner of one of the wings was appropriated to Julia as the\nlady of the feast; that next her, to Diomed.  At one corner of the\ncentre table was placed the aedile; at the opposite corner, the Roman\nsenator--these were the posts of honour.  The other guests were\narranged, so that the young (gentleman or lady) should sit next each\nother, and the more advanced in years be similarly matched.  An\nagreeable provision enough, but one which must often have offended those\nwho wished to be thought still young.\n\nThe chair of Ione was next to the couch of Glaucus.  The seats were\nveneered with tortoiseshell, and covered with quilts stuffed with\nfeathers, and ornamented with costly embroideries.  The modern ornaments\nof epergne or plateau were supplied by images of the gods, wrought in\nbronze, ivory, and silver.  The sacred salt-cellar and the familiar\nLares were not forgotten. Over the table and the seats a rich canopy was\nsuspended from the ceiling. At each corner of the table were lofty\ncandelabra--for though it was early noon, the room was darkened--while\nfrom tripods, placed in different parts of the room, distilled the odor\nof myrrh and frankincense; and upon the abacus, or sideboard, large\nvases and various ornaments of silver were ranged, much with the same\nostentation (but with more than the same taste) that we find displayed\nat a modern feast.\n\nThe custom of grace was invariably supplied by that of libations to the\ngods; and Vesta, as queen of the household gods, usually received first\nthat graceful homage.\n\nThis ceremony being performed, the slaves showered flowers upon the\ncouches and the floor, and crowned each guest with rosy garlands,\nintricately woven with ribands, tied by the rind of the linden-tree, and\neach intermingled with the ivy and the amethyst--supposed preventives\nagainst the effect of wine; the wreaths of the women only were exempted\nfrom these leaves, for it was not the fashion for them to drink wine in\npublic.  It was then that the president Diomed thought it advisable to\ninstitute a basileus, or director of the feast--an important office,\nsometimes chosen by lot; sometimes, as now, by the master of the\nentertainment.\n\nDiomed was not a little puzzled as to his election.  The invalid senator\nwas too grave and too infirm for the proper fulfilment of his duty; the\naedile Pansa was adequate enough to the task: but then, to choose the\nnext in official rank to the senator, was an affront to the senator\nhimself.  While deliberating between the merits of the others, he caught\nthe mirthful glance of Sallust, and, by a sudden inspiration, named the\njovial epicure to the rank of director, or arbiter bibendi.\n\nSallust received the appointment with becoming humility.\n\n'I shall be a merciful king,' said he, 'to those who drink deep; to a\nrecusant, Minos himself shall be less inexorable.  Beware!'\n\nThe slaves handed round basins of perfumed water, by which lavation the\nfeast commenced: and now the table groaned under the initiatory course.\n\nThe conversation, at first desultory and scattered, allowed Ione and\nGlaucus to carry on those sweet whispers, which are worth all the\neloquence in the world.  Julia watched them with flashing eyes.\n\n'How soon shall her place be mine!' thought she.\n\nBut Clodius, who sat in the centre table, so as to observe well the\ncountenance of Julia, guessed her pique, and resolved to profit by it.\nHe addressed her across the table in set phrases of gallantry; and as he\nwas of high birth and of a showy person, the vain Julia was not so much\nin love as to be insensible to his attentions.\n\nThe slaves, in the interim, were constantly kept upon the alert by the\nvigilant Sallust, who chased one cup by another with a celerity which\nseemed as if he were resolved upon exhausting those capacious cellars\nwhich the reader may yet see beneath the house of Diomed. The worthy\nmerchant began to repent his choice, as amphora after amphora was\npierced and emptied.  The slaves, all under the age of manhood (the\nyoungest being about ten years old--it was they who filled the wine--the\neldest, some five years older, mingled it with water), seemed to share\nin the zeal of Sallust; and the face of Diomed began to glow as he\nwatched the provoking complacency with which they seconded the exertions\nof the king of the feast.\n\n'Pardon me, O senator!' said Sallust; 'I see you flinch; your purple hem\ncannot save you--drink!'\n\n'By the gods,' said the senator, coughing, 'my lungs are already on\nfire; you proceed with so miraculous a swiftness, that Phaeton himself\nwas nothing to you.  I am infirm, O pleasant Sallust: you must exonerate\nme.'\n\n'Not I, by Vesta!  I am an impartial monarch--drink.'\n\nThe poor senator, compelled by the laws of the table, was forced to\ncomply. Alas! every cup was bringing him nearer and nearer to the\nStygian pool.\n\n'Gently! gently! my king,' groaned Diomed; 'we already begin to...'\n\n'Treason!' interrupted Sallust; 'no stern Brutus here!--no interference\nwith royalty!'\n\n'But our female guests...'\n\n'Love a toper!  Did not Ariadne dote upon Bacchus?'\n\nThe feast proceeded; the guests grew more talkative and noisy; the\ndessert or last course was already on the table; and the slaves bore\nround water with myrrh and hyssop for the finishing lavation.  At the\nsame time, a small circular table that had been placed in the space\nopposite the guests suddenly, and as by magic, seemed to open in the\ncentre, and cast up a fragrant shower, sprinkling the table and the\nguests; while as it ceased the awning above them was drawn aside, and\nthe guests perceived that a rope had been stretched across the ceiling,\nand that one of those nimble dancers for which Pompeii was so\ncelebrated, and whose descendants add so charming a grace to the\nfestivities of Astley's or Vauxhall, was now treading his airy measures\nright over their heads.\n\nThis apparition, removed but by a cord from one's pericranium, and\nindulging the most vehement leaps, apparently with the intention of\nalighting upon that cerebral region, would probably be regarded with\nsome terror by a party in May Fair; but our Pompeian revellers seemed to\nbehold the spectacle with delighted curiosity, and applauded in\nproportion as the dancer appeared with the most difficulty to miss\nfalling upon the head of whatever guest he particularly selected to\ndance above.  He paid the senator, indeed, the peculiar compliment of\nliterally falling from the rope, and catching it again with his hand,\njust as the whole party imagined the skull of the Roman was as much\nfractured as ever that of the poet whom the eagle took for a tortoise.\nAt length, to the great relief of at least Ione, who had not much\naccustomed herself to this entertainment, the dancer suddenly paused as\na strain of music was heard from without.  He danced again still more\nwildly; the air changed, the dancer paused again; no, it could not\ndissolve the charm which was supposed to possess him!  He represented\none who by a strange disorder is compelled to dance, and whom only a\ncertain air of music can cure.  At length the musician seemed to hit on\nthe right tune; the dancer gave one leap, swung himself down from the\nrope, alighted on the floor, and vanished.\n\nOne art now yielded to another; and the musicians who were stationed\nwithout on the terrace struck up a soft and mellow air, to which were\nsung the following words, made almost indistinct by the barrier between\nand the exceeding lowness of the minstrelsy:--\n\n             FESTIVE MUSIC SHOULD BE LOW\n\n                      I\n\n     Hark! through these flowers our music sends its greeting\n        To your loved halls, where Psilas shuns the day;\n      When the young god his Cretan nymph was meeting\n        He taught Pan's rustic pipe this gliding lay:\n           Soft as the dews of wine\n             Shed in this banquet hour,\n           The rich libation of Sound's stream divine,\n             O reverent harp, to Aphrodite pour!\n\n                     II\n\n     Wild rings the trump o'er ranks to glory marching;\n        Music's sublimer bursts for war are meet;\n      But sweet lips murmuring under wreaths o'er-arching,\n        Find the low whispers like their own most sweet.\n           Steal, my lull'd music, steal\n             Like womans's half-heard tone,\n           So that whoe'er shall hear, shall think to feel\n             In thee the voice of lips that love his own.\n\nAt the end of that song Ione's cheek blushed more deeply than before,\nand Glaucus had contrived, under cover of the table, to steal her hand.\n\n'It is a pretty song,' said Fulvius, patronizingly.\n\n'Ah! if you would oblige us!' murmured the wife of Pansa.\n\n'Do you wish Fulvius to sing?' asked the king of the feast, who had just\ncalled on the assembly to drink the health of the Roman senator, a cup\nto each letter of his name.\n\n'Can you ask?' said the matron, with a complimentary glance at the poet.\n\nSallust snapped his fingers, and whispering the slave who came to learn\nhis orders, the latter disappeared, and returned in a few moments with a\nsmall harp in one hand, and a branch of myrtle in the other.  The slave\napproached the poet, and with a low reverence presented to him the harp.\n\n'Alas! I cannot play,' said the poet.\n\n'Then you must sing to the myrtle.  It is a Greek fashion: Diomed loves\nthe Greeks--I love the Greeks--you love the Greeks--we all love the\nGreeks--and between you and me this is not the only thing we have stolen\nfrom them. However, I introduce this custom--I, the king: sing, subject,\nsing!' The poet, with a bashful smile, took the myrtle in his hands, and\nafter a short prelude sang as follows, in a pleasant and well-tuned\nvoice:--\n\n           THE CORONATION OF THE LOVES\n\n                    I\n\n           The merry Loves one holiday\n              Were all at gambols madly;\n            But Loves too long can seldom play\n              Without behaving sadly.\n           They laugh'd, they toy'd, they romp'd about,\n           And then for change they all fell out.\n           Fie, fie! how can they quarrel so?\n              My Lesbia--ah, for shame, love\n           Methinks 'tis scarce an hour ago\n              When we did just the same, love.\n\n                    II\n\n        The Loves, 'tis thought, were free till then,\n           They had no king or laws, dear;\n         But gods, like men, should subject be,\n           Say all the ancient saws, dear.\n         And so our crew resolved, for quiet,\n         To choose a king to curb their riot.\n             A kiss: ah! what a grievous thing\n              For both, methinks, 'twould be, child,\n             If I should take some prudish king,\n              And cease to be so free, child!\n\n\n                    III\n\n        Among their toys a Casque they found,\n           It was the helm of Ares;\n         With horrent plumes the crest was crown'd,\n           It frightened all the Lares.\n         So fine a king was never known--\n        They placed the helmet on the throne.\n         My girl, since Valor wins the world,\n           They chose a mighty master;\n         But thy sweet flag of smiles unfurled\n           Would win the world much faster!\n\n                    IV\n\n      The Casque soon found the Loves too wild\n         A troop for him to school them;\n       For warriors know how one such child\n         Has aye contrived to fool them.\n       They plagued him so, that in despair\n       He took a wife the plague to share.\n           If kings themselves thus find the strife\n              Of earth, unshared, severe, girl;\n           Why just to halve the ills of life,\n              Come, take your partner here, girl.\n\n                    V\n\n       Within that room the Bird of Love\n          The whole affair had eyed then;\n        The monarch hail'd the royal dove,\n          And placed her by his side then:\n        What mirth amidst the Loves was seen!\n        'Long live,' they cried, 'our King and Queen.'\n            Ah! Lesbia, would that thrones were mine,\n              And crowns to deck that brow, love!\n            And yet I know that heart of thine\n              For me is throne enow, love!\n\n                    VI\n\n       The urchins hoped to tease the mate\n          As they had teased the hero;\n        But when the Dove in judgment sate\n          They found her worse than Nero!\n        Each look a frown, each word a law;\n        The little subjects shook with awe.\n        In thee I find the same deceit--\n         Too late, alas! a learner!\n        For where a mien more gently sweet?\n          And where a tyrant sterner?\n\nThis song, which greatly suited the gay and lively fancy of the\nPompeians, was received with considerable applause, and the widow\ninsisted on crowning her namesake with the very branch of myrtle to\nwhich he had sung.  It was easily twisted into a garland, and the\nimmortal Fulvius was crowned amidst the clapping of hands and shouts of\nIo triumphe!  The song and the harp now circulated round the party, a\nnew myrtle branch being handed about, stopping at each person who could\nbe prevailed upon to sing.\n\nThe sun began now to decline, though the revellers, who had worn away\nseveral hours, perceived it not in their darkened chamber; and the\nsenator, who was tired, and the warrior, who had to return to\nHerculaneum, rising to depart, gave the signal for the general\ndispersion.  'Tarry yet a moment, my friends,' said Diomed; 'if you will\ngo so soon, you must at least take a share in our concluding game.'\n\nSo saying, he motioned to one of the ministri, and whispering him, the\nslave went out, and presently returned with a small bowl containing\nvarious tablets carefully sealed, and, apparently, exactly similar.\nEach guest was to purchase one of these at the nominal price of the\nlowest piece of silver: and the sport of this lottery (which was the\nfavorite diversion of Augustus, who introduced it) consisted in the\ninequality, and sometimes the incongruity, of the prizes, the nature and\namount of which were specified within the tablets.  For instance, the\npoet, with a wry face, drew one of his own poems (no physician ever less\nwillingly swallowed his own draught); the warrior drew a case of\nbodkins, which gave rise to certain novel witticisms relative to\nHercules and the distaff; the widow Fulvia obtained a large\ndrinking-cup; Julia, a gentleman's buckle; and Lepidus, a lady's\npatch-box.  The most appropriate lot was drawn by the gambler Clodius,\nwho reddened with anger on being presented to a set of cogged dice.  A\ncertain damp was thrown upon the gaiety which these various lots created\nby an accident that was considered ominous; Glaucus drew the most\nvaluable of all the prizes, a small marble statue of Fortune, of Grecian\nworkmanship: on handing it to him the slave suffered it to drop, and it\nbroke in pieces.\n\nA shiver went round the assembly, and each voice cried spontaneously on\nthe gods to avert the omen.\n\nGlaucus alone, though perhaps as superstitious as the rest, affected to\nbe unmoved.\n\n'Sweet Neapolitan,' whispered he tenderly to Ione, who had turned pale\nas the broken marble itself, 'I accept the omen.  It signifies that in\nobtaining thee, Fortune can give no more--she breaks her image when she\nblesses me with thine.'\n\nIn order to divert the impression which this incident had occasioned in\nan assembly which, considering the civilization of the guests, would\nseem miraculously superstitious, if at the present day in a country\nparty we did not often see a lady grow hypochondriacal on leaving a room\nlast of thirteen, Sallust now crowning his cup with flowers, gave the\nhealth of their host.  This was followed by a similar compliment to the\nemperor; and then, with a parting cup to Mercury to send them pleasant\nslumbers, they concluded the entertainment by a last libation, and broke\nup the party. Carriages and litters were little used in Pompeii, partly\nowing to the extreme narrowness of the streets, partly to the convenient\nsmallness of the city.  Most of the guests replacing their sandals,\nwhich they had put off in the banquet-room, and induing their cloaks,\nleft the house on foot attended by their slaves.\n\nMeanwhile, having seen Ione depart, Glaucus turning to the staircase\nwhich led down to the rooms of Julia, was conducted by a slave to an\napartment in which he found the merchant's daughter already seated.\n\n'Glaucus!' said she, looking down, 'I see that you really love Ione--she\nis indeed beautiful.'\n\n'Julia is charming enough to be generous,' replied the Greek. 'Yes, I\nlove Ione; amidst all the youth who court you, may you have one\nworshipper as sincere.'\n\n'I pray the gods to grant it!  See, Glaucus, these pearls are the\npresent I destine to your bride: may Juno give her health to wear them!'\n\nSo saying, she placed a case in his hand, containing a row of pearls of\nsome size and price.  It was so much the custom for persons about to be\nmarried to receive these gifts, that Glaucus could have little scruple\nin accepting the necklace, though the gallant and proud Athenian inly\nresolved to requite the gift by one of thrice its value. Julia then\nstopping short his thanks, poured forth some wine into a small bowl.\n\n'You have drunk many toasts with my father,' said she smiling--'one now\nwith me.  Health and fortune to your bride!'\n\nShe touched the cup with her lips and then presented it to Glaucus.  The\ncustomary etiquette required that Glaucus should drain the whole\ncontents; he accordingly did so.  Julia, unknowing the deceit which\nNydia had practised upon her, watched him with sparkling eyes; although\nthe witch had told her that the effect might not be immediate, she yet\nsanguinely trusted to an expeditious operation in favor of her charms.\nShe was disappointed when she found Glaucus coldly replace the cup, and\nconverse with her in the same unmoved but gentle tone as before.  And\nthough she detained him as long as she decorously could do, no change\ntook place in his manner.  'But to-morrow,' thought she, exultingly\nrecovering her disappointment--'to-morrow, alas for Glaucus!'\n\nAlas for him, indeed!\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nTHE STORY HALTS FOR A MOMENT AT AN EPISODE.\n\nRESTLESS and anxious, Apaecides consumed the day in wandering through\nthe most sequestered walks in the vicinity of the city.  The sun was\nslowly setting as he paused beside a lonely part of the Sarnus, ere yet\nit wound amidst the evidences of luxury and power. Only through openings\nin the woods and vines were caught glimpses of the white and gleaming\ncity, in which was heard in the distance no din, no sound, nor 'busiest\nhum of men'.  Amidst the green banks crept the lizard and the\ngrasshopper, and here and there in the brake some solitary bird burst\ninto sudden song, as suddenly stifled. There was deep calm around, but\nnot the calm of night; the air still breathed of the freshness and life\nof day; the grass still moved to the stir of the insect horde; and on\nthe opposite bank the graceful and white capella passed browsing through\nthe herbage, and paused at the wave to drink.\n\nAs Apaecides stood musingly gazing upon the waters, he heard beside him\nthe low bark of a dog.\n\n'Be still, poor friend,' said a voice at hand; 'the stranger's step\nharms not thy master.' The convert recognized the voice, and, turning,\nhe beheld the old mysterious man whom he had seen in the congregation of\nthe Nazarenes.\n\nThe old man was sitting upon a fragment of stone covered with ancient\nmosses; beside him were his staff and scrip; at his feet lay a small\nshaggy dog, the companion in how many a pilgrimage perilous and strange.\n\nThe face of the old man was as balm to the excited spirit of the\nneophyte: he approached, and craving his blessing, sat down beside him.\n\n'Thou art provided as for a journey, father,' said he: 'wilt thou leave\nus yet?'\n\n'My son,' replied the old man, 'the days in store for me on earth are\nfew and scanty; I employ them as becomes me travelling from place to\nplace, comforting those whom God has gathered together in His name, and\nproclaiming the glory of His Son, as testified to His servant.'\n\n'Thou hast looked, they tell me, on the face of Christ?'\n\n'And the face revived me from the dead.  Know, young proselyte to the\ntrue faith, that I am he of whom thou readest in the scroll of the\nApostle.  In the far Judea, and in the city of Nain, there dwelt a\nwidow, humble of spirit and sad of heart; for of all the ties of life\none son alone was spared to her.  And she loved him with a melancholy\nlove, for he was the likeness of the lost.  And the son died.  The reed\non which she leaned was broken, the oil was dried up in the widow's\ncruse.  They bore the dead upon his bier; and near the gate of the city,\nwhere the crowd were gathered, there came a silence over the sounds of\nwoe, for the Son of God was passing by.  The mother, who followed the\nbier, wept--not noisily, but all who looked upon her saw that her heart\nwas crushed.  And the Lord pitied her, and he touched the bier, and\nsaid, \"I SAY UNTO THEE, ARISE,\" And the dead man woke and looked upon\nthe face of the Lord.  Oh, that calm and solemn brow, that unutterable\nsmile, that careworn and sorrowful face, lighted up with a God's\nbenignity--it chased away the shadows of the grave!  I rose, I spoke, I\nwas living, and in my mother's arms--yes, I am the dead revived! The\npeople shouted, the funeral horns rung forth merrily: there was a cry,\n\"God has visited His people!\" I heard them not--I felt--I saw--nothing\nbut the face of the Redeemer!'\n\nThe old man paused, deeply moved; and the youth felt his blood creep,\nand his hair stir.  He was in the presence of one who had known the\nMystery of Death!\n\n'Till that time,' renewed the widow's son, 'I had been as other men:\nthoughtless, not abandoned; taking no heed, but of the things of love\nand life; nay, I had inclined to the gloomy faith of the earthly\nSadducee!  But, raised from the dead, from awful and desert dreams that\nthese lips never dare reveal--recalled upon earth, to testify the powers\nof Heaven--once more mortal, the witness of immortality; I drew a new\nbeing from the grave.  O faded--O lost Jerusalem!--Him from whom came my\nlife, I beheld adjudged to the agonized and parching death!  Far in the\nmighty crowd I saw the light rest and glimmer over the cross; I heard\nthe hooting mob, I cried aloud, I raved, I threatened--none heeded me--I\nwas lost in the whirl and the roar of thousands!  But even then, in my\nagony and His own, methought the glazing eye of the Son of Man sought me\nout--His lip smiled, as when it conquered death--it hushed me, and I\nbecame calm.  He who had defied the grave for another--what was the\ngrave to him?  The sun shone aslant the pale and powerful features, and\nthen died away!  Darkness fell over the earth; how long it endured, I\nknow not.  A loud cry came through the gloom--a sharp and bitter\ncry!--and all was silent.\n\n'But who shall tell the terrors of the night?' I walked along the\ncity--the earth reeled to and fro, and the houses trembled to their\nbase--theliving had deserted the streets, but not the Dead: through the\ngloom I saw them glide--the dim and ghastly shapes, in the cerements of\nthe grave--with horror, and woe, and warning on their unmoving lips and\nlightless eyes!--they swept by me, as I passed--they glared upon me--I\nhad been their brother; and they bowed their heads in recognition; they\nhad risen to tell the living that the dead can rise!'\n\nAgain the old man paused, and, when he resumed, it was in a calmer tone.\n\n'From that night I resigned all earthly thought but that of serving HIM.\nA preacher and a pilgrim, I have traversed the remotest corners of the\nearth, proclaiming His Divinity, and bringing new converts to His fold.\nI come as the wind, and as the wind depart; sowing, as the wind sows,\nthe seeds that enrich the world.\n\n'Son, on earth we shall meet no more.  Forget not this hour,--what are\nthe pleasures and the pomps of life?  As the lamp shines, so life\nglitters for an hour; but the soul's light is the star that burns for\never, in the heart of inimitable space.'\n\nIt was then that their conversation fell upon the general and sublime\ndoctrines of immortality; it soothed and elevated the young mind of the\nconvert, which yet clung to many of the damps and shadows of that cell\nof faith which he had so lately left--it was the air of heaven breathing\non the prisoner released at last.  There was a strong and marked\ndistinction between the Christianity of the old man and that of\nOlinthus; that of the first was more soft, more gentle, more divine.\nThe heroism of Olinthus had something in it fierce and intolerant--it\nwas necessary to the part he was destined to play--it had in it more of\nthe courage of the martyr than the charity of the saint.  It aroused, it\nexcited, it nerved, rather than subdued and softened.  But the whole\nheart of that divine old man was bathed in love; the smile of the Deity\nhad burned away from it the leaven of earthlier and coarser passions,\nand left to the energy of the hero all the meekness of the child.\n\n'And now,' said he, rising at length, as the sun's last ray died in the\nwest; 'now, in the cool of twilight, I pursue my way towards the\nImperial Rome.  There yet dwell some holy men, who like me have beheld\nthe face of Christ; and them would I see before I die.'\n\n'But the night is chill for thine age, my father, and the way is long,\nand the robber haunts it; rest thee till to-morrow.'\n\n'Kind son, what is there in this scrip to tempt the robber?  And the\nNight and the Solitude!--these make the ladder round which angels\ncluster, and beneath which my spirit can dream of God.  Oh! none can\nknow what the pilgrim feels as he walks on his holy course; nursing no\nfear, and dreading no danger--for God is with him!  He hears the winds\nmurmur glad tidings; the woods sleep in the shadow of Almighty\nwings--the stars are the Scriptures of Heaven, the tokens of love, and\nthe witnesses of immortality.  Night is the Pilgrim's day.' With these\nwords the old man pressed Apaecides to his breast, and taking up his\nstaff and scrip, the dog bounded cheerily before him, and with slow\nsteps and downcast eyes he went his way.\n\nThe convert stood watching his bended form, till the trees shut the last\nglimpse from his view; and then, as the stars broke forth, he woke from\nthe musings with a start, reminded of his appointment with Olinthus.\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nTHE PHILTRE.  ITS EFFECT.\n\nWHEN Glaucus arrived at his own home, he found Nydia seated under the\nportico of his garden.  In fact, she had sought his house in the mere\nchance that he might return at an early hour: anxious, fearful,\nanticipative, she resolved upon seizing the earliest opportunity of\navailing herself of the love-charm, while at the same time she half\nhoped the opportunity might be deferred.\n\nIt was then, in that fearful burning mood, her heart beating, her cheek\nflushing, that Nydia awaited the possibility of Glaucus's return before\nthe night.  He crossed the portico just as the first stars began to\nrise, and the heaven above had assumed its most purple robe.\n\n'Ho, my child, wait you for me?'\n\n'Nay, I have been tending the flowers, and did but linger a little while\nto rest myself.'\n\n'It has been warm,' said Glaucus, placing himself also on one of the\nseats beneath the colonnade.\n\n'Very.'\n\n'Wilt thou summon Davus?  The wine I have drunk heats me, and I long for\nsome cooling drink.'\n\nHere at once, suddenly and unexpectedly, the very opportunity that Nydia\nawaited presented itself; of himself, at his own free choice, he\nafforded to her that occasion.  She breathed quick--'I will prepare for\nyou myself,' said she, 'the summer draught that Ione loves--of honey and\nweak wine cooled in snow.'\n\n'Thanks,' said the unconscious Glaucus.  'If Ione love it, enough; it\nwould be grateful were it poison.'\n\nNydia frowned, and then smiled; she withdrew for a few moments, and\nreturned with the cup containing the beverage.  Glaucus took it from her\nhand.  What would not Nydia have given then for one hour's prerogative\nof sight, to have watched her hopes ripening to effect--to have seen the\nfirst dawn of the imagined love--to have worshipped with more than\nPersian adoration the rising of that sun which her credulous soul\nbelieved was to break upon her dreary night!  Far different, as she\nstood then and there, were the thoughts, the emotions of the blind girl,\nfrom those of the vain Pompeian under a similar suspense.  In the last,\nwhat poor and frivolous passions had made up the daring whole! What\npetty pique, what small revenge, what expectation of a paltry triumph,\nhad swelled the attributes of that sentiment she dignified with the name\nof love! but in the wild heart of the Thessalian all was pure,\nuncontrolled, unmodified passion--erring, unwomanly, frenzied, but\ndebased by no elements of a more sordid feeling. Filled with love as\nwith life itself, how could she resist the occasion of winning love in\nreturn!\n\nShe leaned for support against the wall, and her face, before so\nflushed, was now white as snow, and with her delicate hands clasped\nconvulsively together, her lips apart, her eyes on the ground, she\nwaited the next words Glaucus should utter.\n\nGlaucus had raised the cup to his lips, he had already drained about a\nfourth of its contents, when his eye suddenly glancing upon the face of\nNydia, he was so forcibly struck by its alteration, by its intense, and\npainful, and strange expression, that he paused abruptly, and still\nholding the cup near his lips, exclaimed:\n\n'Why, Nydia! Nydia! I say, art thou ill or in pain?  Nay, thy face\nspeaks for thee.  What ails my poor child?'  As he spoke, he put down\nthe cup and rose from his seat to approach her, when a sudden pang shot\ncoldly to his heart, and was followed by a wild, confused, dizzy\nsensation at the brain. The floor seemed to glide from under him--his\nfeet seemed to move on air--a mighty and unearthly gladness rushed upon\nhis spirit--he felt too buoyant for the earth--he longed for wings, nay,\nit seemed in the buoyancy of his new existence, as if he possessed them.\nHe burst involuntarily into a loud and thrilling laugh.  He clapped his\nhands--he bounded aloft--he was as a Pythoness inspired; suddenly as it\ncame this preternatural transport passed, though only partially, away.\nHe now felt his blood rushing loudly and rapidly through his veins; it\nseemed to swell, to exult, to leap along, as a stream that has burst its\nbounds, and hurries to the ocean.  It throbbed in his ear with a mighty\nsound, he felt it mount to his brow, he felt the veins in the temples\nstretch and swell as if they could no longer contain the violent and\nincreasing tide--then a kind of darkness fell over his eyes--darkness,\nbut not entire; for through the dim shade he saw the opposite walls glow\nout, and the figures painted thereon seemed, ghost-like, to creep and\nglide.  What was most strange, he did not feel himself ill--he did not\nsink or quail beneath the dread frenzy that was gathering over him. The\nnovelty of the feelings seemed bright and vivid--he felt as if a younger\nhealth had been infused into his frame.  He was gliding on to\nmadness--and he knew it not!\n\nNydia had not answered his first question--she had not been able to\nreply--his wild and fearful laugh had roused her from her passionate\nsuspense: she could not see his fierce gesture--she could not mark his\nreeling and unsteady step as he paced unconsciously to and fro; but she\nheard the words, broken, incoherent, insane, that gushed from his lips.\nShe became terrified and appalled--she hastened to him, feeling with her\narms until she touched his knees, and then falling on the ground she\nembraced them, weeping with terror and excitement.\n\n'Oh, speak to me! speak! you do not hate me?--speak, speak!'\n\n'By the bright goddess, a beautiful land this Cyprus!  Ho! how they fill\nus with wine instead of blood! now they open the veins of the Faun\nyonder, to show how the tide within bubbles and sparkles.  Come hither,\njolly old god! thou ridest on a goat, eh?--what long silky hair he has!\nHe is worth all the coursers of Parthia.  But a word with thee--this\nwine of thine is too strong for us mortals.  Oh! beautiful! the boughs\nare at rest! the green waves of the forest have caught the Zephyr and\ndrowned him!  Not a breath stirs the leaves--and I view the Dreams\nsleeping with folded wings upon the motionless elm; and I look beyond,\nand I see a blue stream sparkle in the silent noon; a fountain--a\nfountain springing aloft!  Ah! my fount, thou wilt not put out rays of\nmy Grecian sun, though thou triest ever so hard with thy nimble and\nsilver arms.  And now, what form steals yonder through the boughs? she\nglides like a moonbeam!--she has a garland of oak-leaves on her head.\nIn her hand is a vase upturned, from which she pours pink and tiny\nshells and sparkling water.  Oh! look on yon face!  Man never before saw\nits like.  See! we are alone; only I and she in the wide forest.  There\nis no smile upon her lips--she moves, grave and sweetly sad.  Ha! fly,\nit is a nymph!--it is one of the wild Napaeae!  Whoever sees her becomes\nmad--fly! see, she discovers me!'\n\n'Oh! Glaucus! Glaucus! do you not know me?  Rave not so wildly, or thou\nwilt kill me with a word!'\n\nA new change seemed now to operate upon the jarring and disordered mind\nof the unfortunate Athenian.  He put his hand upon Nydia's silken hair;\nhe smoothed the locks--he looked wistfully upon her face, and then, as\nin the broken chain of thought one or two links were yet unsevered, it\nseemed that her countenance brought its associations of Ione; and with\nthat remembrance his madness became yet more powerful, and it swayed and\ntinged by passion, as he burst forth:\n\n'I swear by Venus, by Diana, and by Juno, that though I have now the\nworld on my shoulders, as my countryman Hercules (ah, dull Rome! whoever\nwas truly great was of Greece; why, you would be godless if it were not\nfor us!)--I say, as my countryman Hercules had before me, I would let it\nfall into chaos for one smile from Ione.  Ah, Beautiful,--Adored,' he\nadded, in a voice inexpressibly fond and plaintive, 'thou lovest me not.\nThou art unkind to me.  The Egyptian hath belied me to thee--thou\nknowest not what hours I have spent beneath thy casement--thou knowest\nnot how I have outwatched the stars, thinking thou, my sun, wouldst rise\nat last--and thou lovest me not, thou forsakest me!  Oh! do not leave me\nnow!  I feel that my life will not be long; let me gaze on thee at least\nunto the last.  I am of the bright land of thy fathers--I have trod the\nheights of Phyle--I have gathered the hyacinth and rose amidst the\nolive-groves of Ilyssus.  Thou shouldst not desert me, for thy fathers\nwere brothers to my own.  And they say this land is lovely, and these\nclimes serene, but I will bear thee with me--Ho! dark form, why risest\nthou like a cloud between me and mine?  Death sits calmly dread upon thy\nbrow--on thy lip is the smile that slays: thy name is Orcus, but on\nearth men call thee Arbaces.  See, I know thee! fly, dim shadow, thy\nspells avail not!'\n\n'Glaucus! Glaucus!' murmured Nydia, releasing her hold and falling,\nbeneath the excitement of her dismay, remorse, and anguish, insensible\non the floor.\n\n'Who calls?' said he in a loud voice.  'Ione, it is she! they have borne\nher off--we will save her--where is my stilus?  Ha, I have it!  I come,\nIone, to thy rescue!  I come!  I come!'\n\nSo saying, the Athenian with one bound passed the portico, he traversed\nthe house, and rushed with swift but vacillating steps, and muttering\naudibly to himself, down the starlit streets.  The direful potion burnt\nlike fire in his veins, for its effect was made, perhaps, still more\nsudden from the wine he had drunk previously.  Used to the excesses of\nnocturnal revellers, the citizens, with smiles and winks, gave way to\nhis reeling steps; they naturally imagined him under the influence of\nthe Bromian god, not vainly worshipped at Pompeii; but they who looked\ntwice upon his face started in a nameless fear, and the smile withered\nfrom their lips.  He passed the more populous streets; and, pursuing\nmechanically the way to Ione's house, he traversed a more deserted\nquarter, and entered now the lonely grove of Cybele, in which Apaecides\nhad held his interview with Olinthus.\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nA REUNION OF DIFFERENT ACTORS.  STREAMS THAT FLOWED APPARENTLY APART\nRUSH INTO ONE GULF.\n\nIMPATIENT to learn whether the fell drug had yet been administered by\nJulia to his hated rival, and with what effect, Arbaces resolved, as the\nevening came on, to seek her house, and satisfy his suspense. It was\ncustomary, as I have before said, for men at that time to carry abroad\nwith them the tablets and the stilus attached to their girdle; and with\nthe girdle they were put off when at home.  In fact, under the\nappearance of a literary instrument, the Romans carried about with them\nin that same stilus a very sharp and formidable weapon.  It was with his\nstilus that Cassius stabbed Caesar in the senate-house.  Taking, then,\nhis girdle and his cloak, Arbaces left his house, supporting his steps,\nwhich were still somewhat feeble (though hope and vengeance had\nconspired greatly with his own medical science, which was profound, to\nrestore his natural strength), by his long staff--Arbaces took his way\nto the villa of Diomed.\n\nAnd beautiful is the moonlight of the south!  In those climes the night\nso quickly glides into the day, that twilight scarcely makes a bridge\nbetween them.  One moment of darker purple in the sky--of a thousand\nrose-hues in the water--of shade half victorious over light; and then\nburst forth at once the countless stars--the moon is up--night has\nresumed her reign!\n\nBrightly then, and softly bright, fell the moonbeams over the antique\ngrove consecrated to Cybele--the stately trees, whose date went beyond\ntradition, cast their long shadows over the soil, while through the\nopenings in their boughs the stars shone, still and frequent.  The\nwhiteness of the small sacellum in the centre of the grove, amidst the\ndark foliage, had in it something abrupt and startling; it recalled at\nonce the purpose to which the wood was consecrated--its holiness and\nsolemnity.\n\nWith a swift and stealthy pace, Calenus, gliding under the shade of the\ntrees, reached the chapel, and gently putting back the boughs that\ncompletely closed around its rear, settled himself in his concealment; a\nconcealment so complete, what with the fane in front and the trees\nbehind, that no unsuspicious passenger could possibly have detected him.\nAgain, all was apparently solitary in the grove: afar off you heard\nfaintly the voices of some noisy revellers or the music that played\ncheerily to the groups that then, as now in those climates, during the\nnights of summer, lingered in the streets, and enjoyed, in the fresh air\nand the liquid moonlight, a milder day.\n\nFrom the height on which the grove was placed, you saw through the\nintervals of the trees the broad and purple sea, rippling in the\ndistance, the white villas of Stabiae in the curving shore, and the dim\nLectiarian hills mingling with the delicious sky.  Presently the tall\nfigure of Arbaces, in his way to the house of Diomed, entered the\nextreme end of the grove; and at the same instant Apaecides, also bound\nto his appointment with Olinthus, crossed the Egyptian's path.\n\n'Hem! Apaecides,' said Arbaces, recognizing the priest at a glance;\n'when last we met, you were my foe.  I have wished since then to see\nyou, for I would have you still my pupil and my friend.'\n\nApaecides started at the voice of the Egyptian; and halting abruptly,\ngazed upon him with a countenance full of contending, bitter, and\nscornful emotions.\n\n'Villain and impostor!' said he at length; 'thou hast recovered then\nfrom the jaws of the grave!  But think not again to weave around me thy\nguilty meshes.  Retiarius, I am armed against thee!'\n\n'Hush!' said Arbaces, in a very low voice--but his pride, which in that\ndescendant of kings was great, betrayed the wound it received from the\ninsulting epithets of the priest in the quiver of his lip and the flush\nof his tawny brow.  'Hush! more low! thou mayest be overheard, and if\nother ears than mine had drunk those sounds--why...'\n\n'Dost thou threaten?--what if the whole city had heard me?'\n\n'The manes of my ancestors would not have suffered me to forgive thee.\nBut, hold, and hear me.  Thou art enraged that I would have offered\nviolence to thy sister.  Nay, peace, peace, but one instant, I pray\nthee.  Thou art right; it was the frenzy of passion and of jealousy--I\nhave repented bitterly of my madness.  Forgive me; I, who never implored\npardon of living man, beseech thee now to forgive me. Nay, I will atone\nthe insult--I ask thy sister in marriage--start not--consider--what is\nthe alliance of yon holiday Greek compared to mine?  Wealth\nunbounded--birth that in its far antiquity leaves your Greek and Roman\nnames the things of yesterday--science--but that thou knowest!  Give me\nthy sister, and my whole life shall atone a moment's error.'\n\n'Egyptian, were even I to consent, my sister loathes the very air thou\nbreathest: but I have my own wrongs to forgive--I may pardon thee that\nthou hast made me a tool to thy deceits, but never that thou hast\nseduced me to become the abettor of thy vices--a polluted and a perjured\nman. Tremble!--even now I prepare the hour in which thou and thy false\ngods shall be unveiled.  Thy lewd and Circean life shall be dragged to\nday--thy mumming oracles disclosed--the fane of the idol Isis shall be a\nbyword and a scorn--the name of Arbaces a mark for the hisses of\nexecration!  Tremble!'\n\nThe flush on the Egyptian's brow was succeeded by a livid paleness.  He\nlooked behind, before, around, to feel assured that none were by; and\nthen he fixed his dark and dilating eye on the priest, with such a gaze\nof wrath and menace, that one, perhaps, less supported than Apaecides by\nthe fervent daring of a divine zeal, could not have faced with\nunflinching look that lowering aspect. As it was, however, the young\nconvert met it unmoved, and returned it with an eye of proud defiance.\n\n'Apaecides,' said the Egyptian, in a tremulous and inward tone, 'beware!\nWhat is it thou wouldst meditate?  Speakest thou--reflect, pause before\nthou repliest--from the hasty influences of wrath, as yet divining no\nsettled purpose, or from some fixed design?'\n\n'I speak from the inspiration of the True God, whose servant I now am,'\nanswered the Christian, boldly; 'and in the knowledge that by His grace\nhuman courage has already fixed the date of thy hypocrisy and thy\ndemon's worship; ere thrice the sun has dawned, thou wilt know all!\nDark sorcerer, tremble, and farewell!'\n\nAll the fierce and lurid passions which he inherited from his nation and\nhis clime, at all times but ill concealed beneath the blandness of craft\nand the coldness of philosophy, were released in the breast of the\nEgyptian. Rapidly one thought chased another; he saw before him an\nobstinate barrier to even a lawful alliance with Ione--the\nfellow-champion of Glaucus in the struggle which had baffled his\ndesigns--the reviler of his name--the threatened desecrator of the\ngoddess he served while he disbelieved--the avowed and approaching\nrevealer of his own impostures and vices.  His love, his repute, nay,\nhis very life, might be in danger--the day and hour seemed even to have\nbeen fixed for some design against him.  He knew by the words of the\nconvert that Apaecides had adopted the Christian faith: he knew the\nindomitable zeal which led on the proselytes of that creed.  Such was\nhis enemy; he grasped his stilus--that enemy was in his power! They were\nnow before the chapel; one hasty glance once more he cast around; he saw\nnone near--silence and solitude alike tempted him.\n\n'Die, then, in thy rashness!' he muttered; 'away, obstacle to my rushing\nfates!'\n\nAnd just as the young Christian had turned to depart, Arbaces raised his\nhand high over the left shoulder of Apaecides, and plunged his sharp\nweapon twice into his breast.\n\nApaecides fell to the ground pierced to the heart--he fell mute, without\neven a groan, at the very base of the sacred chapel.\n\nArbaces gazed upon him for a moment with the fierce animal joy of\nconquest over a foe.  But presently the full sense of the danger to\nwhich he was exposed flashed upon him; he wiped his weapon carefully in\nthe long grass, and with the very garments of his victim; drew his cloak\nround him, and was about to depart, when he saw, coming up the path,\nright before him, the figure of a young man, whose steps reeled and\nvacillated strangely as he advanced: the quiet moonlight streamed full\nupon his face, which seemed, by the whitening ray, colorless as marble.\nThe Egyptian recognized the face and form of Glaucus.  The unfortunate\nand benighted Greek was chanting a disconnected and mad song, composed\nfrom snatches of hymns and sacred odes, all jarringly woven together.\n\n'Ha!' thought the Egyptian, instantaneously divining his state and its\nterrible cause; 'so, then, the hell-draught works, and destiny hath sent\nthee hither to crush two of my foes at once!'\n\nQuickly, even ere this thought occurred to him, he had withdrawn on one\nside of the chapel, and concealed himself amongst the boughs; from that\nlurking place he watched, as a tiger in his lair, the advance of his\nsecond victim. He noted the wandering and restless fire in the bright\nand beautiful eyes of the Athenian; the convulsions that distorted his\nstatue-like features, and writhed his hueless lip.  He saw that the\nGreek was utterly deprived of reason.  Nevertheless, as Glaucus came up\nto the dead body of Apaecides, from which the dark red stream flowed\nslowly over the grass, so strange and ghastly a spectacle could not fail\nto arrest him, benighted and erring as was his glimmering sense.  He\npaused, placed his hand to his brow, as if to collect himself, and then\nsaying:\n\n'What ho! Endymion, sleepest thou so soundly?  What has the moon said to\nthee?  Thou makest me jealous; it is time to wake'--he stooped down with\nthe intention of lifting up the body.\n\nForgetting--feeling not--his own debility, the Egyptian sprung from his\nhiding-place, and, as the Greek bent, struck him forcibly to the ground,\nover the very body of the Christian; then, raising his powerful voice to\nits highest pitch, he shouted:\n\n'Ho, citizens--oh! help me!--run hither--hither!--A murder--a murder\nbefore your very fane!  Help, or the murderer escapes!' As he spoke, he\nplaced his foot on the breast of Glaucus: an idle and superfluous\nprecaution; for the potion operating with the fall, the Greek lay there\nmotionless and insensible, save that now and then his lips gave vent to\nsome vague and raving sounds.\n\nAs he there stood awaiting the coming of those his voice still continued\nto summons, perhaps some remorse, some compunctious visitings--for\ndespite his crimes he was human--haunted the breast of the Egyptian; the\ndefenceless state of Glaucus--his wandering words--his shattered reason,\nsmote him even more than the death of Apaecides, and he said, half\naudibly, to himself:\n\n'Poor clay!--poor human reason; where is the soul now?  I could spare\nthee, O my rival--rival never more!  But destiny must be obeyed--my\nsafety demands thy sacrifice.' With that, as if to drown compunction, he\nshouted yet more loudly; and drawing from the girdle of Glaucus the\nstilus it contained, he steeped it in the blood of the murdered man, and\nlaid it beside the corpse.\n\nAnd now, fast and breathless, several of the citizens came thronging to\nthe place, some with torches, which the moon rendered unnecessary, but\nwhich flared red and tremulously against the darkness of the trees; they\nsurrounded the spot.  'Lift up yon corpse,' said the Egyptian, 'and\nguard well the murderer.'\n\nThey raised the body, and great was their horror and sacred indignation\nto discover in that lifeless clay a priest of the adored and venerable\nIsis; but still greater, perhaps, was their surprise, when they found\nthe accused in the brilliant and admired Athenian.\n\n'Glaucus!' cried the bystanders, with one accord; 'is it even credible?'\n\n'I would sooner,' whispered one man to his neighbor, 'believe it to be\nthe Egyptian himself.'\n\nHere a centurion thrust himself into the gathering crowd, with an air of\nauthority.\n\n'How! blood spilt! who the murderer?'\n\nThe bystanders pointed to Glaucus.\n\n'He!--by Mars, he has rather the air of being the victim!\n\n'Who accuses him?'\n\n'I,' said Arbaces, drawing himself up haughtily; and the jewels which\nadorned his dress flashing in the eyes of the soldier, instantly\nconvinced that worthy warrior of the witness's respectability.\n\n'Pardon me--your name?' said he.\n\n'Arbaces; it is well known methinks in Pompeii.  Passing through the\ngrove, I beheld before me the Greek and the priest in earnest\nconversation.  I was struck by the reeling motions of the first, his\nviolent gestures, and the loudness of his voice; he seemed to me either\ndrunk or mad.  Suddenly I saw him raise his stilus--I darted\nforward--too late to arrest the blow.  He had twice stabbed his victim,\nand was bending over him, when, in my horror and indignation, I struck\nthe murderer to the ground.  He fell without a struggle, which makes me\nyet more suspect that he was not altogether in his senses when the crime\nwas perpetrated; for, recently recovered from a severe illness, my blow\nwas comparatively feeble, and the frame of Glaucus, as you see, is\nstrong and youthful.'\n\n'His eyes are open now--his lips move,' said the soldier. 'Speak,\nprisoner, what sayest thou to the charge?'\n\n'The charge--ha--ha!  Why, it was merrily done; when the old hag set her\nserpent at me, and Hecate stood by laughing from ear to ear--what could\nI do?  But I am ill--I faint--the serpent's fiery tongue hath bitten me.\nBear me to bed, and send for your physician; old AEsculapius himself\nwill attend me if you let him know that I am Greek.  Oh, mercy--mercy!\nI burn!--marrow and brain, I burn!'\n\nAnd, with a thrilling and fierce groan, the Athenian fell back in the\narms of the bystanders.\n\n'He raves,' said the officer, compassionately; 'and in his delirium he\nhas struck the priest.  Hath any one present seen him to-day!'\n\n'I,' said one of the spectators, 'beheld him in the morning.  He passed\nmy shop and accosted me.  He seemed well and sane as the stoutest of\nus!'\n\n'And I saw him half an hour ago,' said another, 'passing up the streets,\nmuttering to himself with strange gestures, and just as the Egyptian has\ndescribed.'\n\n'A corroboration of the witness! it must be too true.  He must at all\nevents to the praetor; a pity, so young and so rich!  But the crime is\ndreadful: a priest of Isis, in his very robes, too, and at the base\nitself of our most ancient chapel!'\n\nAt these words the crowd were reminded more forcibly, than in their\nexcitement and curiosity they had yet been, of the heinousness of the\nsacrilege.  They shuddered in pious horror.\n\n'No wonder the earth has quaked,' said one, 'when it held such a\nmonster!'\n\n'Away with him to prison--away!' cried they all.\n\nAnd one solitary voice was heard shrilly and joyously above the rest:\n'The beasts will not want a gladiator now,  Ho, ho, for the merry, merry\nshow!\n\nIt was the voice of the young woman whose conversation with Medon has\nbeen repeated.\n\n'True--true--it chances in season for the games!' cried several; and at\nthat thought all pity for the accused seemed vanished.  His youth, his\nbeauty, but fitted him better for the purpose of the arena.\n\n'Bring hither some planks--or if at hand, a litter--to bear the dead,'\nsaid Arbaces: 'a priest of Isis ought scarcely to be carried to his\ntemple by vulgar hands, like a butchered gladiator.'\n\nAt this the bystanders reverently laid the corpse of Apaecides on the\nground, with the face upwards; and some of them went in search of some\ncontrivance to bear the body, untouched by the profane.\n\nIt was just at that time that the crowd gave way to right and left as a\nsturdy form forced itself through, and Olinthus the Christian stood\nimmediately confronting the Egyptian.  But his eyes, at first, only\nrested with inexpressible grief and horror on that gory side and\nupturned face, on which the agony of violent death yet lingered.\n\n'Murdered!' he said.  'Is it thy zeal that has brought thee to this?\nHave they detected thy noble purpose, and by death prevented their own\nshame?'\n\nHe turned his head abruptly, and his eyes fell full on the solemn\nfeatures of the Egyptian.\n\nAs he looked, you might see in his face, and even the slight shiver of\nhis frame, the repugnance and aversion which the Christian felt for one\nwhom he knew to be so dangerous and so criminal.  It was indeed the gaze\nof the bird upon the basilisk--so silent was it and so prolonged.  But\nshaking off the sudden chill that had crept over him, Olinthus extended\nhis right arm towards Arbaces, and said, in a deep and loud voice:\n\n'Murder hath been done upon this corpse!  Where is the murderer? Stand\nforth, Egyptian!  For, as the Lord liveth, I believe thou art the man!'\n\nAn anxious and perturbed change might for one moment be detected on the\ndusky features of Arbaces; but it gave way to the frowning expression of\nindignation and scorn, as, awed and arrested by the suddenness and\nvehemence of the charge, the spectators pressed nearer and nearer upon\nthe two more prominent actors.\n\n'I know,' said Arbaces, proudly, 'who is my accuser, and I guess\nwherefore he thus arraigns me.  Men and citizens, know this man for the\nmost bitter of the Nazarenes, if that or Christians be their proper\nname!  What marvel that in his malignity he dares accuse even an\nEgyptian of the murder of a priest of Egypt!'\n\n'I know him!  I know the dog!' shouted several voices.  'It is Olinthus\nthe Christian--or rather the Atheist--he denies the gods!'\n\n'Peace, brethren,' said Olinthus, with dignity, 'and hear me!  This\nmurdered priest of Isis before his death embraced the Christian\nfaith--he revealed to me the dark sins, the sorceries of yon\nEgyptian--the mummeries and delusions of the fane of Isis.  He was about\nto declare them publicly.  He, a stranger, unoffending, without enemies!\nwho should shed his blood but one of those who feared his witness?  Who\nmight fear that testimony the most?--Arbaces, the Egyptian!'\n\n'You hear him!' said Arbaces; 'you hear him! he blasphemes!  Ask him if\nhe believes in Isis!'\n\n'Do I believe in an evil demon?' returned Olinthus, boldly.\n\nA groan and shudder passed through the assembly.  Nothing daunted, for\nprepared at every time for peril, and in the present excitement losing\nall prudence, the Christian continued:\n\n'Back, idolaters! this clay is not for your vain and polluting rites--it\nis to us--to the followers of Christ, that the last offices due to a\nChristian belong.  I claim this dust in the name of the great Creator\nwho has recalled the spirit!'\n\nWith so solemn and commanding a voice and aspect the Christian spoke\nthese words, that even the crowd forbore to utter aloud the execration\nof fear and hatred which in their hearts they conceived. And never,\nperhaps, since Lucifer and the Archangel contended for the body of the\nmighty Lawgiver, was there a more striking subject for the painter's\ngenius than that scene exhibited.  The dark trees--the stately fane--the\nmoon full on the corpse of the deceased--the torches tossing wildly to\nand fro in the rear--the various faces of the motley audience--the\ninsensible form of the Athenian, supported, in the distance, and in the\nforeground, and above all, the forms of Arbaces and the Christian: the\nfirst drawn to its full height, far taller than the herd around; his\narms folded, his brow knit, his eyes fixed, his lip slightly curled in\ndefiance and disdain.  The last bearing, on a brow worn and furrowed,\nthe majesty of an equal command--the features stern, yet frank--the\naspect bold, yet open--the quiet dignity of the whole form impressed\nwith an ineffable earnestness, hushed, as it were, in a solemn sympathy\nwith the awe he himself had created.  His left hand pointing to the\ncorpse--his right hand raised to heaven.\n\nThe centurion pressed forward again.\n\n'In the first place, hast thou, Olinthus, or whatever be thy name, any\nproof of the charge thou hast made against Arbaces, beyond thy vague\nsuspicions?'\n\nOlinthus remained silent--the Egyptian laughed contemptuously.\n\n'Dost thou claim the body of a priest of Isis as one of the Nazarene or\nChristian sect?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'Swear then by yon fane, yon statue of Cybele, by yon most ancient\nsacellum in Pompeii, that the dead man embraced your faith!'\n\n'Vain man!  I disown your idols!  I abhor your temples!  How can I swear\nby Cybele then?'\n\n'Away, away with the Atheist! away! the earth will swallow us, if we\nsuffer these blasphemers in a sacred grove--away with him to death!'\n\n'To the beasts!' added a female voice in the centre of the crowd; 'we\nshall have one a-piece now for the lion and tiger!'\n\n'If, O Nazarene, thou disbelievest in Cybele, which of our gods dost\nthou own?' resumed the soldier, unmoved by the cries around.\n\n'None!'\n\n'Hark to him! hark!' cried the crowd.\n\n'O vain and blind!' continued the Christian, raising his voice: 'can you\nbelieve in images of wood and stone?  Do you imagine that they have eyes\nto see, or ears to hear, or hands to help ye?  Is yon mute thing carved\nby man's art a goddess!--hath it made mankind?--alas! by mankind was it\nmade. Lo! convince yourself of its nothingness--of your folly.'\n\nAnd as he spoke he strode across to the fane, and ere any of the\nbystanders were aware of his purpose, he, in his compassion or his zeal,\nstruck the statue of wood from its pedestal.\n\n'See!' cried he, 'your goddess cannot avenge herself.  Is this a thing\nto worship?'\n\nFurther words were denied to him: so gross and daring a sacrilege--of\none, too, of the most sacred of their places of worship--filled even the\nmost lukewarm with rage and horror.  With one accord the crowd rushed\nupon him, seized, and but for the interference of the centurion, they\nwould have torn him to pieces.\n\n'Peace!' said the soldier, authoritatively--'refer we this insolent\nblasphemer to the proper tribunal--time has been already wasted.  Bear\nwe both the culprits to the magistrates; place the body of the priest on\nthe litter--carry it to his own home.'\n\nAt this moment a priest of Isis stepped forward.  'I claim these\nremains, according to the custom of the priesthood.'\n\n'The flamen be obeyed,' said the centurion.  'How is the murderer?'\n\n'Insensible or asleep.'\n\n'Were his crimes less, I could pity him.  On!'\n\nArbaces, as he turned, met the eye of that priest of Isis--it was\nCalenus; and something there was in that glance, so significant and\nsinister, that the Egyptian muttered to himself:\n\n'Could he have witnessed the deed?'\n\nA girl darted from the crowd, and gazed hard on the face of Olinthus.\n'By Jupiter, a stout knave!  I say, we shall have a man for the tiger\nnow; one for each beast!'\n\n'Ho!' shouted the mob; 'a man for the lion, and another for the tiger!\nWhat luck!  Io Paean!'\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nIN WHICH THE READER LEARNS THE CONDITION OF GLAUCUS.  FRIENDSHIP TESTED.\nENMITY SOFTENED.  LOVE THE SAME, BECAUSE THE ONE LOVING IS BLIND.\n\nTHE night was somewhat advanced, and the gay lounging places of the\nPompeians were still crowded.  You might observe in the countenances of\nthe various idlers a more earnest expression than usual.  They talked in\nlarge knots and groups, as if they sought by numbers to divide the\nhalf-painful, half-pleasurable anxiety which belonged to the subject\non which they conversed: it was a subject of life and death.\n\nA young man passed briskly by the graceful portico of the Temple of\nFortune--so briskly, indeed, that he came with no slight force full\nagainst the rotund and comely form of that respectable citizen Diomed,\nwho was retiring homeward to his suburban villa.\n\n'Holloa!' groaned the merchant, recovering with some difficulty his\nequilibrium; 'have you no eyes? or do you think I have no feeling? By\nJupiter! you have well nigh driven out the divine particle; such another\nshock, and my soul will be in Hades!'\n\n'Ah, Diomed! is it you?  forgive my inadvertence.  I was absorbed in\nthinking of the reverses of life.  Our poor friend, Glaucus, eh! who\ncould have guessed it?'\n\n'Well, but tell me, Clodius, is he really to be tried by the senate?'\n\n'Yes; they say the crime is of so extraordinary a nature that the senate\nitself must adjudge it; and so the lictors are to induct him formally.'\n\n'He has been accused publicly, then?'\n\n'To be sure; where have you been not to hear that?'\n\n'Why, I have only just returned from Neapolis, whither I went on\nbusiness the very morning after his crime--so shocking, and at my house\nthe same night that it happened!'\n\n'There is no doubt of his guilt,' said Clodius, shrugging his shoulders;\n'and as these crimes take precedence of all little undignified\npeccadilloes, they will hasten to finish the sentence previous to the\ngames.'\n\n'The games!  Good gods!' replied Diomed, with a slight shudder: 'can\nthey adjudge him to the beasts?--so young, so rich!'\n\n'True; but then he is a Greek.  Had he been a Roman, it would have been\na thousand pities.  These foreigners can be borne with in their\nprosperity; but in adversity we must not forget that they are in reality\nslaves. However, we of the upper classes are always tender-hearted; and\nhe would certainly get off tolerably well if he were left to us: for,\nbetween ourselves, what is a paltry priest of Isis!--what Isis herself?\nBut the common people are superstitious; they clamor for the blood of\nthe sacrilegious one.  It is dangerous not to give way to public\nopinion.'\n\n'And the blasphemer--the Christian, or Nazarene, or whatever else he be\ncalled?'\n\n'Oh, poor dog! if he will sacrifice to Cybele or Isis, he will be\npardoned--if not, the tiger has him.  At least, so I suppose; but the\ntrial will decide.  We talk while the urn's still empty.  And the Greek\nmay yet escape the deadly Theta of his own alphabet.  But enough of this\ngloomy subject.  How is the fair Julia?'\n\n'Well, I fancy.'\n\n'Commend me to her.  But hark! the door yonder creaks on its hinges; it\nis the house of the praetor.  Who comes forth?  By Pollux! it is the\nEgyptian! What can he want with our official friend!'\n\n'Some conference touching the murder, doubtless,' replied Diomed; 'but\nwhat was supposed to be the inducement to the crime? Glaucus was to have\nmarried the priest's sister.'\n\n'Yes: some say Apaecides refused the alliance.  It might have been a\nsudden quarrel.  Glaucus was evidently drunk--nay, so much so as to\nhave been quite insensible when taken up, and I hear is still\ndelirious--whether with wine, terror, remorse, the Furies, or the\nBacchanals, I cannot say.'\n\n'Poor fellow!--he has good counsel?'\n\n'The best--Caius Pollio, an eloquent fellow enough.  Pollio has been\nhiring all the poor gentlemen and well-born spendthrifts of Pompeii to\ndress shabbily and sneak about, swearing their friendship to Glaucus\n(who would not have spoken to them to be made emperor!--I will do him\njustice, he was a gentleman in his choice of acquaintance), and trying\nto melt the stony citizens into pity.  But it will not do; Isis is\nmightily popular just at this moment.'\n\n'And, by-the-by, I have some merchandise at Alexandria.  Yes, Isis ought\nto be protected.'\n\n'True; so farewell, old gentleman: we shall meet soon; if not, we must\nhave a friendly bet at the Amphitheatre.  All my calculations are\nconfounded by this cursed misfortune of Glaucus!  He had bet on Lydon\nthe gladiator; I must make up my tablets elsewhere.  Vale!'\n\nLeaving the less active Diomed to regain his villa, Clodius strode on,\nhumming a Greek air, and perfuming the night with the odours that\nsteamed from his snowy garments and flowing locks.\n\n'If,' thought he, 'Glaucus feed the lion, Julia will no longer have a\nperson to love better than me; she will certainly doat on me--and so, I\nsuppose, I must marry.  By the gods! the twelve lines begin to fail--men\nlook suspiciously at my hand when it rattles the dice. That infernal\nSallust insinuates cheating; and if it be discovered that the ivory is\nclogged, why farewell to the merry supper and the perfumed\nbillet--Clodius is undone! Better marry, then, while I may, renounce\ngaming, and push my fortune (or rather the gentle Julia's) at the\nimperial court.'\n\nThus muttering the schemes of his ambition, if by that high name the\nprojects of Clodius may be called, the gamester found himself suddenly\naccosted; he turned and beheld the dark brow of Arbaces.\n\n'Hail, noble Clodius! pardon my interruption; and inform me, I pray you,\nwhich is the house of Sallust?'\n\n'It is but a few yards hence, wise Arbaces.  But does Sallust entertain\nto-night?'\n\n'I know not,' answered the Egyptian; 'nor am I, perhaps, one of those\nwhom he would seek as a boon companion.  But thou knowest that his house\nholds the person of Glaucus, the murderer.'\n\n'Ay! he, good-hearted epicure, believes in the Greek's innocence!  You\nremind me that he has become his surety; and, therefore, till the trial,\nis responsible for his appearance. Well, Sallust's house is better than\na prison, especially that wretched hole in the forum.  But for what can\nyou seek Glaucus?'\n\n'Why, noble Clodius, if we could save him from execution it would be\nwell. The condemnation of the rich is a blow upon society itself.  I\nshould like to confer with him--for I hear he has recovered his\nsenses--and ascertain the motives of his crime; they may be so\nextenuating as to plead in his defence.'\n\n'You are benevolent, Arbaces.'\n\n'Benevolence is the duty of one who aspires to wisdom,' replied the\nEgyptian, modestly.  'Which way lies Sallust's mansion?'\n\n'I will show you,' said Clodius, 'if you will suffer me to accompany you\na few steps.  But, pray what has become of the poor girl who was to have\nwed the Athenian--the sister of the murdered priest?'\n\n'Alas! well-nigh insane!  Sometimes she utters imprecations on the\nmurderer--then suddenly stops short--then cries, \"But why curse? Oh, my\nbrother! Glaucus was not thy murderer--never will I believe it!\" Then\nshe begins again, and again stops short, and mutters awfully to herself,\n\"Yet if it were indeed he?\"'\n\n'Unfortunate Ione!'\n\n'But it is well for her that those solemn cares to the dead which\nreligion enjoins have hitherto greatly absorbed her attention from\nGlaucus and herself: and, in the dimness of her senses, she scarcely\nseems aware that Glaucus is apprehended and on the eve of trial.  When\nthe funeral rites due to Apaecides are performed, her apprehension will\nreturn; and then I fear me much that her friends will be revolted by\nseeing her run to succour and aid the murderer of her brother!'\n\n'Such scandal should be prevented.'\n\n'I trust I have taken precautions to that effect.  I am her lawful\nguardian, and have just succeeded in obtaining permission to escort her,\nafter the funeral of Apaecides, to my own house; there, please the gods!\nshe will be secure.'\n\n'You have done well, sage Arbaces.  And, now, yonder is the house of\nSallust.  The gods keep you!  Yet, hark you, Arbaces--why so gloomy and\nunsocial?  Men say you can be gay--why not let me initiate you into the\npleasures of Pompeii?--I flatter myself no one knows them better.'\n\n'I thank you, noble Clodius: under your auspices I might venture, I\nthink, to wear the philyra: but, at my age, I should be an awkward\npupil.'\n\n'Oh, never fear; I have made converts of fellows of seventy.  The rich,\ntoo, are never old.'\n\n'You flatter me.  At some future time I will remind you of your\npromise.'\n\n'You may command Marcus Clodius at all times--and so, vale!'\n\n'Now,' said the Egyptian, soliloquising, 'I am not wantonly a man of\nblood; I would willingly save this Greek, if, by confessing the crime,\nhe will lose himself for ever to Ione, and for ever free me from the\nchance of discovery; and I can save him by persuading Julia to own the\nphiltre, which will be held his excuse.  But if he do not confess the\ncrime, why, Julia must be shamed from the confession, and he must\ndie!--die, lest he prove my rival with the living--die, that he may be\nmy proxy with the dead!  Will he confess?--can he not be persuaded that\nin his delirium he struck the blow? To me it would give far greater\nsafety than even his death.  Hem! we must hazard the experiment.'\n\nSweeping along the narrow street, Arbaces now approached the house of\nSallust, when he beheld a dark form wrapped in a cloak, and stretched at\nlength across the threshold of the door.\n\nSo still lay the figure, and so dim was its outline, that any other than\nArbaces might have felt a superstitious fear, lest he beheld one of\nthose grim lemures, who, above all other spots, haunted the threshold of\nthe homes they formerly possessed.  But not for Arbaces were such\ndreams.\n\n'Rise!' said he, touching the figure with his foot; 'thou obstructest\nthe way!'\n\n'Ha! who art thou,' cried the form, in a sharp tone, and as she raised\nherself from the ground, the starlight fell full on the pale face and\nfixed but sightless eyes of Nydia the Thessalian.  'Who art thou?  I\nknow the burden of thy voice.'\n\n'Blind girl! what dost thou here at this late hour?  Fie!--is this\nseeming thy sex or years?  Home, girl!'\n\n'I know thee,' said Nydia, in a low voice, 'thou art Arbaces the\nEgyptian': then, as if inspired by some sudden impulse, she flung\nherself at his feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed, in a wild and\npassionate tone, 'Oh dread and potent man! save him--save him! He is not\nguilty--it is I!  He lies within, ill-dying, and I--I am the hateful\ncause!  And they will not admit me to him--they spurn the blind girl\nfrom the hall.  Oh, heal him! thou knowest some herb--some spell--some\ncountercharm, for it is a potion that hath wrought this frenzy!'\n\n'Hush, child!  I know all!--thou forgettest that I accompanied Julia to\nthe saga's home.  Doubtless her hand administered the draught; but her\nreputation demands thy silence.  Reproach not thyself--what must be,\nmust: meanwhile, I seek the criminal--he may yet be saved. Away!'\n\nThus saying, Arbaces extricated himself from the clasp of the despairing\nThessalian, and knocked loudly at the door.\n\nIn a few moments the heavy bars were heard suddenly to yield, and the\nporter, half opening the door, demanded who was there.\n\n'Arbaces--important business to Sallust relative to Glaucus.  I come\nfrom the praetor.'\n\nThe porter, half yawning, half groaning, admitted the tall form of the\nEgyptian.  Nydia sprang forward.  'How is he?' she cried; 'tell me--tell\nme!'\n\n'Ho, mad girl! is it thou still?--for shame!  Why, they say he is\nsensible.'\n\n'The gods be praised!--and you will not admit me?  Ah! I beseech\nthee...'\n\n'Admit thee!--no.  A pretty salute I should prepare for these shoulders\nwere I to admit such things as thou!  Go home!'\n\nThe door closed, and Nydia, with a deep sigh, laid herself down once\nmore on the cold stones; and, wrapping her cloak round her face, resumed\nher weary vigil.\n\nMeanwhile Arbaces had already gained the triclinium, where Sallust, with\nhis favorite freedman, sat late at supper.\n\n'What!  Arbaces! and at this hour!--Accept this cup.'\n\n'Nay, gentle Sallust; it is on business, not pleasure, that I venture to\ndisturb thee.  How doth thy charge?--they say in the town that he has\nrecovered sense.'\n\n'Alas! and truly,' replied the good-natured but thoughtless Sallust,\nwiping the tear from his eyes; 'but so shattered are his nerves and\nframe that I scarcely recognize the brilliant and gay carouser I was\nwont to know.  Yet, strange to say, he cannot account for the cause of\nthe sudden frenzy that seized him--he retains but a dim consciousness of\nwhat hath passed; and, despite thy witness, wise Egyptian, solemnly\nupholds his innocence of the death of Apaecides.'\n\n'Sallust,' said Arbaces, gravely, 'there is much in thy friend's case\nthat merits a peculiar indulgence; and could we learn from his lips the\nconfession and the cause of his crime, much might be yet hoped from the\nmercy of the senate; for the senate, thou knowest, hath the power either\nto mitigate or to sharpen the law.  Therefore it is that I have\nconferred with the highest authority of the city, and obtained his\npermission to hold a private conference this night with the Athenian.\nTomorrow, thou knowest, the trial comes on.'\n\n'Well,' said Sallust, 'thou wilt be worthy of thy Eastern name and fame\nif thou canst learn aught from him; but thou mayst try.  Poor\nGlaucus!--and he had such an excellent appetite!  He eats nothing now!'\n\nThe benevolent epicure was moved sensibly at this thought.  He sighed,\nand ordered his slaves to refill his cup.\n\n'Night wanes,' said the Egyptian; 'suffer me to see thy ward now.'\n\nSallust nodded assent, and led the way to a small chamber, guarded\nwithout by two dozing slaves.  The door opened; at the request of\nArbaces, Sallust withdrew--the Egyptian was alone with Glaucus.\n\nOne of those tall and graceful candelabra common to that day, supporting\na single lamp, burned beside the narrow bed.  Its rays fell palely over\nthe face of the Athenian, and Arbaces was moved to see how sensibly that\ncountenance had changed.  The rich color was gone, the cheek was sunk,\nthe lips were convulsed and pallid; fierce had been the struggle between\nreason and madness, life and death. The youth, the strength of Glaucus\nhad conquered; but the freshness of blood and soul--the life of\nlife--its glory and its zest, were gone for ever.\n\nThe Egyptian seated himself quietly beside the bed; Glaucus still lay\nmute and unconscious of his presence.  At length, after a considerable\npause, Arbaces thus spoke:\n\n'Glaucus, we have been enemies.  I come to thee alone and in the dead of\nnight--thy friend, perhaps thy saviour.'\n\nAs the steed starts from the path of the tiger, Glaucus sprang up\nbreathless--alarmed, panting at the abrupt voice, the sudden apparition\nof his foe.  Their eyes met, and neither, for some moments, had power to\nwithdraw his gaze.  The flush went and came over the face of the\nAthenian, and the bronzed cheek of the Egyptian grew a shade more pale.\nAt length, with an inward groan, Glaucus turned away, drew his hand\nacross his brow, sunk back, and muttered:\n\n'Am I still dreaming?'\n\n'No, Glaucus thou art awake.  By this right hand and my father's head,\nthou seest one who may save thy life.  Hark! I know what thou hast done,\nbut I know also its excuse, of which thou thyself art ignorant.  Thou\nhast committed murder, it is true--a sacrilegious murder--frown\nnot--start not--these eyes saw it.  But I can save thee--I can prove how\nthou wert bereaved of sense, and made not a free-thinking and\nfree-acting man.  But in order to save thee, thou must confess thy crime.\nSign but this paper, acknowledging thy hand in the death of Apaecides,\nand thou shalt avoid the fatal urn.'\n\n'What words are these?--Murder and Apaecides!--Did I not see him\nstretched on the ground bleeding and a corpse? and wouldst thou persuade\nme that I did the deed?  Man, thou liest!  Away!'\n\n'Be not rash--Glaucus, be not hasty; the deed is proved.  Come, come,\nthou mayst well be excused for not recalling the act of thy delirium,\nand which thy sober senses would have shunned even to contemplate.  But\nlet me try to refresh thy exhausted and weary memory. Thou knowest thou\nwert walking with the priest, disputing about his sister; thou knowest\nhe was intolerant, and half a Nazarene, and he sought to convert thee,\nand ye had hot words; and he calumniated thy mode of life, and swore he\nwould not marry Ione to thee--and then, in thy wrath and thy frenzy,\nthou didst strike the sudden blow. Come, come; you can recollect\nthis!--read this papyrus, it runs to that effect--sign it, and thou\nart saved.'\n\n'Barbarian, give me the written lie, that I may tear it!  I the murderer\nof Ione's brother: I confess to have injured one hair of the head of him\nshe loved!  Let me rather perish a thousand times!'\n\n'Beware!' said Arbaces, in a low and hissing tone; 'there is but one\nchoice--thy confession and thy signature, or the amphitheatre and the\nlion's maw!'\n\nAs the Egyptian fixed his eyes upon the sufferer, he hailed with joy the\nsigns of evident emotion that seized the latter at these words.  A\nslight shudder passed over the Athenian's frame--his lip fell--an\nexpression of sudden fear and wonder betrayed itself in his brow and\neye.\n\n'Great gods!' he said, in a low voice, 'what reverse is this?  It seems\nbut a little day since life laughed out from amidst roses--Ione\nmine--youth, health, love, lavishing on me their treasures; and\nnow--pain, madness, shame, death!  And for what?  What have I done?\nOh, I am mad still?'\n\n'Sign, and be saved!' said the soft, sweet voice of the Egyptian.\n\n'Tempter, never!' cried Glaucus, in the reaction of rage.  'Thou knowest\nme not: thou knowest not the haughty soul of an Athenian! The sudden\nface of death might appal me for a moment, but the fear is over.\nDishonour appals for ever!  Who will debase his name to save his life?\nwho exchange clear thoughts for sullen days? who will belie himself to\nshame, and stand blackened in the eyes of love?  If to earn a few years\nof polluted life there be so base a coward, dream not, dull barbarian of\nEgypt! to find him in one who has trod the same sod as Harmodius, and\nbreathed the same air as Socrates.  Go! leave me to live without\nself-reproach--or to perish without fear!'\n\n'Bethink thee well! the lion's fangs: the hoots of the brutal mob: the\nvulgar gaze on thy dying agony and mutilated limbs: thy name degraded;\nthy corpse unburied; the shame thou wouldst avoid clinging to thee for\naye and ever!'\n\n'Thou ravest; thou art the madman! shame is not in the loss of other\nmen's esteem--it is in the loss of our own.  Wilt thou go?--my eyes\nloathe the sight of thee! hating ever, I despise thee now!'\n\n'I go,' said Arbaces, stung and exasperated, but not without some\npitying admiration of his victim, 'I go; we meet twice again--once at\nthe Trial, once at the Death!  Farewell!'\n\nThe Egyptian rose slowly, gathered his robes about him, and left the\nchamber.  He sought Sallust for a moment, whose eyes began to reel with\nthe vigils of the cup: 'He is still unconscious, or still obstinate;\nthere is no hope for him.'\n\n'Say not so,' replied Sallust, who felt but little resentment against\nthe Athenian's accuser, for he possessed no great austerity of virtue,\nand was rather moved by his friend's reverses than persuaded of his\ninnocence--'say not so, my Egyptian! so good a drinker shall be saved if\npossible.  Bacchus against Isis!'\n\n'We shall see,' said the Egyptian.\n\nSuddenly the bolts were again withdrawn--the door unclosed; Arbaces was\nin the open street; and poor Nydia once more started from her long\nwatch.\n\n'Wilt thou save him?' she cried, clasping her hands.\n\n'Child, follow me home; I would speak to thee--it is for his sake I ask\nit.'\n\n'And thou wilt save him?'\n\nNo answer came forth to the thirsting ear of the blind girl: Arbaces had\nalready proceeded far up the street; she hesitated a moment, and then\nfollowed his steps in silence.\n\n'I must secure this girl,' said he, musingly, 'lest she give evidence of\nthe philtre; as to the vain Julia, she will not betray herself.'\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nA CLASSIC FUNERAL.\n\nWHILE Arbaces had been thus employed, Sorrow and Death were in the house\nof Ione.  It was the night preceding the morn in which the solemn\nfuneral rites were to be decreed to the remains of the murdered\nApaecides.  The corpse had been removed from the temple of Isis to the\nhouse of the nearest surviving relative, and Ione had heard, in the same\nbreath, the death of her brother and the accusation against her\nbetrothed.  That first violent anguish which blunts the sense to all but\nitself, and the forbearing silence of her slaves, had prevented her\nlearning minutely the circumstances attendant on the fate of her lover.\nHis illness, his frenzy, and his approaching trial, were unknown to her.\nShe learned only the accusation against him, and at once indignantly\nrejected it; nay, on hearing that Arbaces was the accuser, she required\nno more to induce her firmly and solemnly to believe that the Egyptian\nhimself was the criminal.  But the vast and absorbing importance\nattached by the ancients to the performance of every ceremonial\nconnected with the death of a relation, had, as yet, confined her woe\nand her convictions to the chamber of the deceased.  Alas! it was not\nfor her to perform that tender and touching office, which obliged the\nnearest relative to endeavor to catch the last breath--the parting\nsoul--of the beloved one: but it was hers to close the straining eyes,\nthe distorted lips: to watch by the consecrated clay, as, fresh bathed\nand anointed, it lay in festive robes upon the ivory bed; to strew the\ncouch with leaves and flowers, and to renew the solemn cypress-branch at\nthe threshold of the door.  And in these sad offices, in lamentation and\nin prayer, Ione forgot herself.  It was among the loveliest customs of\nthe ancients to bury the young at the morning twilight; for, as they\nstrove to give the softest interpretation to death, so they poetically\nimagined that Aurora, who loved the young, had stolen them to her\nembrace; and though in the instance of the murdered priest this fable\ncould not appropriately cheat the fancy, the general custom was still\npreserved.\n\nThe stars were fading one by one from the grey heavens, and night slowly\nreceding before the approach of morn, when a dark group stood motionless\nbefore Ione's door.  High and slender torches, made paler by the\nunmellowed dawn, cast their light over various countenances, hushed for\nthe moment in one solemn and intent expression.  And now there arose a\nslow and dismal music, which accorded sadly with the rite, and floated\nfar along the desolate and breathless streets; while a chorus of female\nvoices (the Praeficae so often cited by the Roman poets), accompanying\nthe Tibicen and the Mysian flute, woke the following strain:\n\n               THE FUNERAL DIRGE\n\n      O'er the sad threshold, where the cypress bough\n         Supplants the rose that should adorn thy home,\n       On the last pilgrimage on earth that now\n         Awaits thee, wanderer to Cocytus, come!\n       Darkly we woo, and weeping we invite--\n        Death is thy host--his banquet asks thy soul,\n       Thy garlands hang within the House of Night,\n         And the black stream alone shall fill thy bowl.\n\n      No more for thee the laughter and the song,\n         The jocund night--the glory of the day!\n       The Argive daughters' at their labours long;\n         The hell-bird swooping on its Titan prey--\n\n      The false AEolides upheaving slow,\n         O'er the eternal hill, the eternal stone;\n       The crowned Lydian, in his parching woe,\n         And green Callirrhoe's monster-headed son--\n\n      These shalt thou see, dim shadowed through the dark,\n         Which makes the sky of Pluto's dreary shore;\n       Lo! where thou stand'st, pale-gazing on the bark,\n          That waits our rite to bear thee trembling o'er!\n       Come, then! no more delay!--the phantom pines\n         Amidst the Unburied for its latest home;\n       O'er the grey sky the torch impatient shines--\n        Come, mourner, forth!--the lost one bids thee come.\n\nAs the hymn died away, the group parted in twain; and placed upon a\ncouch, spread with a purple pall, the corpse of Apaecides was carried\nforth, with the feet foremost.  The designator, or marshal of the sombre\nceremonial, accompanied by his torch-bearers, clad in black, gave the\nsignal, and the procession moved dreadly on.\n\nFirst went the musicians, playing a slow march--the solemnity of the\nlower instruments broken by many a louder and wilder burst of the\nfuneral trumpet: next followed the hired mourners, chanting their dirges\nto the dead; and the female voices were mingled with those of boys,\nwhose tender years made still more striking the contrast of life and\ndeath--the fresh leaf and the withered one.  But the players, the\nbuffoons, the archimimus (whose duty it was to personate the\ndead)--these, the customary attendants at ordinary funerals, were\nbanished from a funeral attended with so many terrible associations.\n\nThe priests of Isis came next in their snowy garments, barefooted, and\nsupporting sheaves of corn; while before the corpse were carried the\nimages of the deceased and his many Athenian forefathers.  And behind\nthe bier followed, amidst her women, the sole surviving relative of the\ndead--her head bare, her locks disheveled, her face paler than marble,\nbut composed and still, save ever and anon, as some tender\nthought--awakened by the music, flashed upon the dark lethargy of woe,\nshe covered that countenance with her hands, and sobbed unseen; for hers\nwere not the noisy sorrow, the shrill lament, the ungoverned gesture,\nwhich characterized those who honored less faithfully.  In that age, as\nin all, the channel of deep grief flowed hushed and still.\n\nAnd so the procession swept on, till it had traversed the streets,\npassed the city gate, and gained the Place of Tombs without the wall,\nwhich the traveler yet beholds.\n\nRaised in the form of an altar--of unpolished pine, amidst whose\ninterstices were placed preparations of combustible matter--stood the\nfuneral pyre; and around it drooped the dark and gloomy cypresses so\nconsecrated by song to the tomb.\n\nAs soon as the bier was placed upon the pile, the attendants parting on\neither side, Ione passed up to the couch, and stood before the\nunconscious clay for some moments motionless and silent. The features of\nthe dead had been composed from the first agonized expression of violent\ndeath.  Hushed for ever the terror and the doubt, the contest of\npassion, the awe of religion, the struggle of the past and present, the\nhope and the horror of the future!--of all that racked and desolated the\nbreast of that young aspirant to the Holy of Life, what trace was\nvisible in the awful serenity of that impenetrable brow and unbreathing\nlip?  The sister gazed, and not a sound was heard amidst the crowd;\nthere was something terrible, yet softening, also, in the silence; and\nwhen it broke, it broke sudden and abrupt--it broke, with a loud and\npassionate cry--the vent of long-smothered despair.\n\n'My brother! my brother!' cried the poor orphan, falling upon the couch;\n'thou whom the worm on thy path feared not--what enemy couldst thou\nprovoke? Oh, is it in truth come to this?  Awake! awake! We grew\ntogether!  Are we thus torn asunder?  Thou art not dead--thou sleepest.\nAwake! awake!'\n\nThe sound of her piercing voice aroused the sympathy of the mourners,\nand they broke into loud and rude lament.  This startled, this recalled\nIone; she looked up hastily and confusedly, as if for the first time\nsensible of the presence of those around.\n\n'Ah!' she murmured with a shiver, 'we are not then alone!' With that,\nafter a brief pause, she rose; and her pale and beautiful countenance\nwas again composed and rigid.  With fond and trembling hands, she\nunclosed the lids of the deceased; but when the dull glazed eye, no\nlonger beaming with love and life, met hers, she shrieked aloud, as if\nshe had seen a spectre.  Once more recovering herself she kissed again\nand again the lids, the lips, the brow; and with mechanic and\nunconscious hand, received from the high priest of her brother's temple\nthe funeral torch.\n\nThe sudden burst of music, the sudden song of the mourners announced the\nbirth of the sanctifying flame.\n\n           HYMN TO THE WIND\n\n                I\n\n       On thy couch of cloud reclined,\n        Wake, O soft and sacred Wind!\n        Soft and sacred will we name thee,\n        Whosoe'er the sire that claim thee--\n       Whether old Auster's dusky child,\n        Or the loud son of Eurus wild;\n        Or his who o'er the darkling deeps,\n        From the bleak North, in tempest sweeps;\n        Still shalt thou seem as dear to us\n        As flowery-crowned Zephyrus,\n        When, through twilight's starry dew,\n        Trembling, he hastes his nymph to woo.\n\n                II\n\n       Lo! our silver censers swinging,\n        Perfumes o'er thy path are flinging--\n       Ne'er o'er Tempe's breathless valleys,\n        Ne'er o'er Cypria's cedarn alleys,\n        Or the Rose-isle's moonlit sea,\n        Floated sweets more worthy thee.\n        Lo! around our vases sending\n        Myrrh and nard with cassia blending:\n        Paving air with odorous meet,\n        For thy silver-sandall'd feet!\n\n               III\n\n       August and everlasting air!\n          The source of all that breathe and be,\n        From the mute clay before thee bear\n          The seeds it took from thee!\n        Aspire, bright Flame! aspire!\n          Wild wind!--awake, awake!\n        Thine own, O solemn Fire!\n          O Air, thine own retake!\n\n\n                IV\n\n       It comes! it comes!

By degrees the flame wavered, lowered, dimmed, and slowly, by\nfits and unequal starts, died away--emblem of life itself; where, just\nbefore, all was restlessness and flame, now lay the dull and smouldering\nashes.\n\nThe last sparks were extinguished by the attendants--the embers were\ncollected.  Steeped in the rarest wine and the costliest odorous, the\nremains were placed in a silver urn, which was solemnly stored in one of\nthe neighboring sepulchres beside the road; and they placed within it\nthe vial full of tears, and the small coin which poetry still\nconsecrated to the grim boatman.  And the sepulchre was covered with\nflowers and chaplets, and incense kindled on the altar, and the tomb\nhung round with many lamps.\n\nBut the next day, when the priest returned with fresh offerings to the\ntomb, he found that to the relics of heathen superstition some unknown\nhands had added a green palm-branch.  He suffered it to remain,\nunknowing that it was the sepulchral emblem of Christianity.\n\nWhen the above ceremonies were over, one of the Praeficae three times\nsprinkled the mourners from the purifying branch of laurel, uttering the\nlast word, 'Ilicet!'--Depart!--and the rite was done.\n\nBut first they paused to utter--weepingly and many times--the affecting\nfarewell, 'Salve Eternum!' And as Ione yet lingered, they woke the\nparting strain.\n\n            SALVE ETERNUM\n\n                 I\n\n       Farewell! O soul departed!\n          Farewell! O sacred urn!\n        Bereaved and broken-hearted,\n          To earth the mourners turn.\n        To the dim and dreary shore,\n        Thou art gone our steps before!\n        But thither the swift Hours lead us,\n        And thou dost but a while precede us,\n                  Salve--salve!\n        Loved urn, and thou solemn cell,\n        Mute ashes!--farewell, farewell!\n                  Salve--salve!\n\n                II\n\n         Ilicet--ire licet--\n       Ah, vainly would we part!\n        Thy tomb is the faithful heart.\n        About evermore we bear thee;\n        For who from the heart can tear thee?\n        Vainly we sprinkle o'er us\n          The drops of the cleansing stream;\n        And vainly bright before us\n          The lustral fire shall beam.\n        For where is the charm expelling\n        Thy thought from its sacred dwelling?\n        Our griefs are thy funeral feast,\n        And Memory thy mourning priest.\n                  Salve--salve!\n\n                III\n\n         Ilicet--ire licet!\n        The spark from the hearth is gone\n          Wherever the air shall bear it;\n        The elements take their own--\n         The shadows receive thy spirit.\n        It will soothe thee to feel our grief,\n          As thou glid'st by the Gloomy River!\n        If love may in life be brief,\n          In death it is fixed for ever.\n                  Salve--salve!\n        In the hall which our feasts illume,\n        The rose for an hour may bloom;\n        But the cypress that decks the tomb--\n       The cypress is green for ever!\n                  Salve--salve!\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nIN WHICH AN ADVENTURE HAPPENS TO IONE.\n\nWHILE some stayed behind to share with the priests the funeral banquet,\nIone and her handmaids took homeward their melancholy way. And now (the\nlast duties to her brother performed) her mind awoke from its\nabsorption, and she thought of her allianced, and the dread charge\nagainst him.  Not--as we have before said--attaching even a momentary\nbelief to the unnatural accusation, but nursing the darkest suspicion\nagainst Arbaces, she felt that justice to her lover and to her murdered\nrelative demanded her to seek the praetor, and communicate her\nimpression, unsupported as it might be.  Questioning her maidens, who\nhad hitherto--kindly anxious, as I have said, to save her the additional\nagony--refrained from informing her of the state of Glaucus, she learned\nthat he had been dangerously ill: that he was in custody, under the roof\nof Sallust; that the day of his trial was appointed.\n\n'Averting gods,' she exclaimed; 'and have I been so long forgetful of\nhim? Have I seemed to shun him?  O! let me hasten to do him justice--to\nshow that I, the nearest relative of the dead, believe him innocent of\nthe charge. Quick! quick! let us fly.  Let me soothe--tend--cheer him!\nand if they will not believe me; if they will not lead to my conviction;\nif they sentence him to exile or to death, let me share the sentence\nwith him!'\n\nInstinctively she hastened her pace, confused and bewildered, scarce\nknowing whither she went; now designing first to seek the praetor, and\nnow to rush to the chamber of Glaucus.  She hurried on--she passed the\ngate of the city--she was in the long street leading up the town.  The\nhouses were opened, but none were yet astir in the streets; the life of\nthe city was scarce awake--when lo! she came suddenly upon a small knot\nof men standing beside a covered litter. A tall figure stepped from the\nmidst of them, and Ione shrieked aloud to behold Arbaces.\n\n'Fair Ione!' said he, gently, and appearing not to heed her alarm: 'my\nward, my pupil! forgive me if I disturb thy pious sorrows; but the\npraetor, solicitous of thy honour, and anxious that thou mayest not\nrashly be implicated in the coming trial; knowing the strange\nembarrassment of thy state (seeking justice for thy brother, but\ndreading punishment to thy betrothed)--sympathizing, too, with thy\nunprotected and friendless condition, and deeming it harsh that thou\nshouldst be suffered to act unguided and mourn alone--hath wisely and\npaternally confided thee to the care of thy lawful guardian. Behold the\nwriting which intrusts thee to my charge!'\n\n'Dark Egyptian!' cried Ione, drawing herself proudly aside; 'begone!  It\nis thou that hast slain my brother!  Is it to thy care, thy hands yet\nreeking with his blood, that they will give the sister Ha! thou turnest\npale! thy conscience smites thee! thou tremblest at the thunderbolt of\nthe avenging god!  Pass on, and leave me to my woe!'\n\n'Thy sorrows unstring thy reason, Ione,' said Arbaces, attempting in\nvain his usual calmness of tone.  'I forgive thee.  Thou wilt find me\nnow, as ever, thy surest friend.  But the public streets are not the\nfitting place for us to confer--for me to console thee. Approach,\nslaves!  Come, my sweet charge, the litter awaits thee.'\n\nThe amazed and terrified attendants gathered round Ione, and clung to\nher knees.\n\n'Arbaces,' said the eldest of the maidens, 'this is surely not the law!\nFor nine days after the funeral, is it not written that the relatives of\nthe deceased shall not be molested in their homes, or interrupted in\ntheir solitary grief?'\n\n'Woman!' returned Arbaces, imperiously waving his hand, 'to place a ward\nunder the roof of her guardian is not against the funeral laws.  I tell\nthee I have the fiat of the praetor.  This delay is indecorous.  Place\nher in the litter.'\n\nSo saying, he threw his arm firmly round the shrinking form of Ione.\nShe drew back, gazed earnestly in his face, and then burst into\nhysterical laughter:\n\n'Ha, ha! this is well--well!  Excellent guardian--paternal law!  Ha,\nha!' And, startled herself at the dread echo of that shrill and maddened\nlaughter, she sunk, as it died away, lifeless upon the ground...  A\nminute more, and Arbaces had lifted her into the litter. The bearers\nmoved swiftly on, and the unfortunate Ione was soon borne from the sight\nof her weeping handmaids.\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nWHAT BECOMES OF NYDIA IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES.  THE EGYPTIAN FEELS\nCOMPASSION FOR GLAUCUS.  COMPASSION IS OFTEN A VERY USELESS VISITOR TO\nTHE GUILTY.\n\nIT will be remembered that, at the command of Arbaces, Nydia followed\nthe Egyptian to his home, and conversing there with her, he learned from\nthe confession of her despair and remorse, that her hand, and not\nJulia's, had administered to Glaucus the fatal potion.  At another time\nthe Egyptian might have conceived a philosophical interest in sounding\nthe depths and origin of the strange and absorbing passion which, in\nblindness and in slavery, this singular girl had dared to cherish; but\nat present he spared no thought from himself.  As, after her confession,\nthe poor Nydia threw herself on her knees before him, and besought him\nto restore the health and save the life of Glaucus--for in her youth and\nignorance she imagined the dark magician all-powerful to effect\nboth--Arbaces, with unheeding ears, was noting only the new expediency of\ndetaining Nydia a prisoner until the trial and fate of Glaucus were\ndecided.  For if, when he judged her merely the accomplice of Julia in\nobtaining the philtre, he had felt it was dangerous to the full success\nof his vengeance to allow her to be at large--to appear, perhaps, as a\nwitness--to avow the manner in which the sense of Glaucus had been\ndarkened, and thus win indulgence to the crime of which he was\naccused--how much more was she likely to volunteer her testimony when\nshe herself had administered the draught, and, inspired by love, would\nbe only anxious, at any expense of shame, to retrieve her error and\npreserve her beloved?  Besides, how unworthy of the rank and repute of\nArbaces to be implicated in the disgrace of pandering to the passion of\nJulia, and assisting in the unholy rites of the Saga of Vesuvius!\nNothing less, indeed, than his desire to induce Glaucus to own the\nmurder of Apaecides, as a policy evidently the best both for his own\npermanent safety and his successful suit with Ione, could ever have led\nhim to contemplate the confession of Julia.\n\nAs for Nydia, who was necessarily cut off by her blindness from much of\nthe knowledge of active life, and who, a slave and a stranger, was\nnaturally ignorant of the perils of the Roman law, she thought rather of\nthe illness and delirium of her Athenian, than the crime of which she\nhad vaguely heard him accused, or the chances of the impending trial.\nPoor wretch that she was, whom none addressed, none cared for, what did\nshe know of the senate and the sentence--the hazard of the law--the\nferocity of the people--the arena and the lion's den?  She was\naccustomed only to associate with the thought of Glaucus everything that\nwas prosperous and lofty--she could not imagine that any peril, save\nfrom the madness of her love, could menace that sacred head.  He seemed\nto her set apart for the blessings of life.  She only had disturbed the\ncurrent of his felicity; she knew not, she dreamed not that the stream,\nonce so bright, was dashing on to darkness and to death.  It was\ntherefore to restore the brain that she had marred, to save the life\nthat she had endangered that she implored the assistance of the great\nEgyptian.\n\n'Daughter,' said Arbaces, waking from his reverie, 'thou must rest here;\nit is not meet for thee to wander along the streets, and be spurned from\nthe threshold by the rude feet of slaves.  I have compassion on thy soft\ncrime--I will do all to remedy it.  Wait here patiently for some days,\nand Glaucus shall be restored.' So saying, and without waiting for her\nreply, he hastened from the room, drew the bolt across the door, and\nconsigned the care and wants of his prisoner to the slave who had the\ncharge of that part of the mansion.\n\nAlone, then, and musingly, he waited the morning light, and with it\nrepaired, as we have seen, to possess himself of the person of Ione.\n\nHis primary object, with respect to the unfortunate Neapolitan, was that\nwhich he had really stated to Clodius, viz., to prevent her interesting\nherself actively in the trial of Glaucus, and also to guard against her\naccusing him (which she would, doubtless, have done) of his former act\nof perfidy and violence towards her, his ward--denouncing his causes for\nvengeance against Glaucus--unveiling the hypocrisy of his character--and\ncasting any doubt upon his veracity in the charge which he had made\nagainst the Athenian.  Not till he had encountered her that morning--not\ntill he had heard her loud denunciations--was he aware that he had also\nanother danger to apprehend in her suspicion of his crime.  He hugged\nhimself now at the thought that these ends were effected: that one, at\nonce the object of his passion and his fear, was in his power.  He\nbelieved more than ever the flattering promises of the stars; and when\nhe sought Ione in that chamber in the inmost recesses of his mysterious\nmansion to which he had consigned her--when he found her overpowered by\nblow upon blow, and passing from fit to fit, from violence to torpor, in\nall the alternations of hysterical disease--he thought more of the\nloveliness which no frenzy could distort than of the woe which he had\nbrought upon her.  In that sanguine vanity common to men who through\nlife have been invariably successful, whether in fortune or love, he\nflattered himself that when Glaucus had perished--when his name was\nsolemnly blackened by the award of a legal judgment, his title to her\nlove for ever forfeited by condemnation to death for the murder of her\nown brother--her affection would be changed to horror; and that his\ntenderness and his passion, assisted by all the arts with which he well\nknew how to dazzle woman's imagination, might elect him to that throne\nin her heart from which his rival would be so awfully expelled.  This\nwas his hope: but should it fail, his unholy and fervid passion\nwhispered, 'At the worst, now she is in my power.'\n\nYet, withal, he felt that uneasiness and apprehension which attended\nupon the chance of detection, even when the criminal is insensible to\nthe voice of conscience--that vague terror of the consequences of crime,\nwhich is often mistaken for remorse at the crime itself.  The buoyant\nair of Campania weighed heavily upon his breast; he longed to hurry from\na scene where danger might not sleep eternally with the dead; and,\nhaving Ione now in his possession, he secretly resolved, as soon as he\nhad witnessed the last agony of his rival, to transport his wealth--and\nher, the costliest treasure of all, to some distant shore.\n\n'Yes,' said he, striding to and fro his solitary chamber--'yes, the law\nthat gave me the person of my ward gives me the possession of my bride.\nFar across the broad main will we sweep on our search after novel\nluxuries and inexperienced pleasures.  Cheered by my stars, supported by\nthe omens of my soul, we will penetrate to those vast and glorious\nworlds which my wisdom tells me lie yet untracked in the recesses of the\ncircling sea.  There may this heart, possessed of love, grow once more\nalive to ambition--there, amongst nations uncrushed by the Roman yoke,\nand to whose ear the name of Rome has not yet been wafted, I may found\nan empire, and transplant my ancestral creed; renewing the ashes of the\ndead Theban rule; continuing in yet grander shores the dynasty of my\ncrowned fathers, and waking in the noble heart of Ione the grateful\nconsciousness that she shares the lot of one who, far from the aged\nrottenness of this slavish civilization, restores the primal elements of\ngreatness, and unites in one mighty soul the attributes of the prophet\nand the king.' From this exultant soliloquy, Arbaces was awakened to\nattend the trial of the Athenian.\n\nThe worn and pallid cheek of his victim touched him less than the\nfirmness of his nerves and the dauntlessness of his brow; for Arbaces\nwas one who had little pity for what was unfortunate, but a strong\nsympathy for what was bold.  The congenialities that bind us to others\never assimilate to the qualities of our own nature.  The hero weeps less\nat the reverses of his enemy than at the fortitude with which he bears\nthem.  All of us are human, and Arbaces, criminal as he was, had his\nshare of our common feelings and our mother clay. Had he but obtained\nfrom Glaucus the written confession of his crime, which would, better\nthan even the judgment of others, have lost him with Ione, and removed\nfrom Arbaces the chance of future detection, the Egyptian would have\nstrained every nerve to save his rival.  Even now his hatred was\nover--his desire of revenge was slaked: he crushed his prey, not in\nenmity, but as an obstacle in his path. Yet was he not the less\nresolved, the less crafty and persevering, in the course he pursued, for\nthe destruction of one whose doom was become necessary to the attainment\nof his objects: and while, with apparent reluctance and compassion, he\ngave against Glaucus the evidence which condemned him, he secretly, and\nthrough the medium of the priesthood, fomented that popular indignation\nwhich made an effectual obstacle to the pity of the senate.  He had\nsought Julia; he had detailed to her the confession of Nydia; he had\neasily, therefore, lulled any scruple of conscience which might have led\nher to extenuate the offence of Glaucus by avowing her share in his\nfrenzy: and the more readily, for her vain heart had loved the fame and\nthe prosperity of Glaucus--not Glaucus himself, she felt no affection\nfor a disgraced man--nay, she almost rejoiced in the disgrace that\nhumbled the hated Ione.  If Glaucus could not be her slave, neither\ncould he be the adorer of her rival.  This was sufficient consolation\nfor any regret at his fate.  Volatile and fickle, she began again to be\nmoved by the sudden and earnest suit of Clodius, and was not willing to\nhazard the loss of an alliance with that base but high-born noble by any\npublic exposure of her past weakness and immodest passion for another.\nAll things then smiled upon Arbaces--all things frowned upon the\nAthenian.\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nNYDIA AFFECTS THE SORCERESS.\n\nWHEN the Thessalian found that Arbaces returned to her no more--when she\nwas left, hour after hour, to all the torture of that miserable suspense\nwhich was rendered by blindness doubly intolerable, she began, with\noutstretched arms, to feel around her prison for some channel of escape;\nand finding the only entrance secure, she called aloud, and with the\nvehemence of a temper naturally violent, and now sharpened by impatient\nagony.\n\n'Ho, girl!' said the slave in attendance, opening the door; art thou bit\nby a scorpion? or thinkest thou that we are dying of silence here, and\nonly to be preserved, like the infant Jupiter, by a hullabaloo?'\n\n'Where is thy master? and wherefore am I caged here?  I want air and\nliberty: let me go forth!'\n\n'Alas! little one, hast thou not seen enough of Arbaces to know that his\nwill is imperial!  He hath ordered thee to be caged; and caged thou art,\nand I am thy keeper.  Thou canst not have air and liberty; but thou\nmayst have what are much better things--food and wine.'\n\n'Proh Jupiter!' cried the girl, wringing her hands; 'and why am I thus\nimprisoned?  What can the great Arbaces want with so poor a thing as I\nam?'\n\n'That I know not, unless it be to attend on thy new mistress, who has\nbeen brought hither this day.'\n\n'What! Ione here?'\n\n'Yes, poor lady; she liked it little, I fear.  Yet, by the Temple of\nCastor! Arbaces is a gallant man to the women.  Thy lady is his ward,\nthou knowest.'\n\n'Wilt thou take me to her?'\n\n'She is ill--frantic with rage and spite.  Besides, I have no orders to\ndo so; and I never think for myself.  When Arbaces made me slave of\nthese chambers, he said, \"I have but one lesson to give thee--while thou\nservest me, thou must have neither ears, eyes, nor thought; thou must be\nbut one quality--obedience.\"'\n\n'But what harm is there in seeing Ione?'\n\n'That I know not; but if thou wantest a companion, I am willing to talk\nto thee, little one, for I am solitary enough in my dull cubiculum.\nAnd, by the way, thou art Thessalian--knowest thou not some cunning\namusement of knife and shears, some pretty trick of telling fortunes, as\nmost of thy race do, in order to pass the time.'\n\n'Tush, slave, hold thy peace! or, if thou wilt speak, what hast thou\nheard of the state of Glaucus?'\n\n'Why, my master has gone to the Athenian's trial; Glaucus will smart for\nit!'\n\n'For what?'\n\n'The murder of the priest Apaecides.'\n\n'Ha!' said Nydia, pressing her hands to her forehead; 'something of this\nI have indeed heard, but understand not.  Yet, who will dare to touch a\nhair of his head?'\n\n'That will the lion, I fear.'\n\n'Averting gods! what wickedness dost thou utter?'\n\n'Why, only that, if he be found guilty, the lion, or may be the tiger,\nwill be his executioner.'\n\nNydia leaped up, as if an arrow had entered her heart; she uttered a\npiercing scream; then, falling before the feet of the slave, she cried,\nin a tone that melted even his rude heart:\n\n'Ah! tell me thou jestest--thou utterest not the truth--speak, speak!'\n\n'Why, by my faith, blind girl, I know nothing of the law; it may not be\nso bad as I say.  But Arbaces is his accuser, and the people desire a\nvictim for the arena.  Cheer thee! But what hath the fate of the\nAthenian to do with thine?'\n\n'No matter, no matter--he has been kind to me: thou knowest not, then,\nwhat they will do?  Arbaces his accuser!  O fate!  The people--the\npeople!  Ah! they can look upon his face--who will be cruel to the\nAthenian!--Yet was not Love itself cruel to him?'\n\nSo saying, her head drooped upon her bosom: she sunk into silence;\nscalding tears flowed down her cheeks; and all the kindly efforts of the\nslave were unable either to console her or distract the absorption of\nher reverie.\n\nWhen his household cares obliged the ministrant to leave her room, Nydia\nbegan to re-collect her thoughts.  Arbaces was the accuser of Glaucus;\nArbaces had imprisoned her here; was not that a proof that her liberty\nmight be serviceable to Glaucus?  Yes, she was evidently inveigled into\nsome snare; she was contributing to the destruction of her beloved!  Oh,\nhow she panted for release!  Fortunately, for her sufferings, all sense\nof pain became merged in the desire of escape; and as she began to\nrevolve the possibility of deliverance, she grew calm and thoughtful.\nShe possessed much of the craft of her sex, and it had been increased in\nher breast by her early servitude.  What slave was ever destitute of\ncunning?  She resolved to practise upon her keeper; and calling suddenly\nto mind his superstitious query as to her Thessalian art, she hoped by\nthat handle to work out some method of release.  These doubts occupied\nher mind during the rest of the day and the long hours of night; and,\naccordingly, when Sosia visited her the following morning, she hastened\nto divert his garrulity into that channel in which it had before evinced\na natural disposition to flow.\n\nShe was aware, however, that her only chance of escape was at night; and\naccordingly she was obliged with a bitter pang at the delay to defer\ntill then her purposed attempt.\n\n'The night,' said she, 'is the sole time in which we can well decipher\nthe decrees of Fate--then it is thou must seek me.  But what desirest\nthou to learn?'\n\n'By Pollux! I should like to know as much as my master; but that is not\nto be expected.  Let me know, at least, whether I shall save enough to\npurchase my freedom, or whether this Egyptian will give it me for\nnothing.  He does such generous things sometimes.  Next, supposing that\nbe true, shall I possess myself of that snug taberna among the\nMyropolia, which I have long had in my eye?  'Tis a genteel trade that\nof a perfumer, and suits a retired slave who has something of a\ngentleman about him!'\n\n'Ay! so you would have precise answers to those questions?--there are\nvarious ways of satisfying you.  There is the Lithomanteia, or\nSpeaking-stone, which answers your prayer with an infant's voice; but,\nthen, we have not that precious stone with us--costly is it and rare.\nThen there is the Gastromanteia, whereby the demon casts pale and deadly\nimages upon the water, prophetic of the future.  But this art requires\nalso glasses of a peculiar fashion, to contain the consecrated liquid,\nwhich we have not.  I think, therefore, that the simplest method of\nsatisfying your desire would be by the Magic of Air.'\n\n'I trust,' said Sosia, tremulously, 'that there is nothing very\nfrightful in the operation?  I have no love for apparitions.'\n\n'Fear not; thou wilt see nothing; thou wilt only hear by the bubbling of\nwater whether or not thy suit prospers.  First, then, be sure, from the\nrising of the evening star, that thou leavest the garden-gate somewhat\nopen, so that the demon may feel himself invited to enter therein; and\nplace fruits and water near the gate as a sign of hospitality; then,\nthree hours after twilight, come here with a bowl of the coldest and\npurest water, and thou shalt learn all, according to the Thessalian lore\nmy mother taught me. But forget not the garden-gate--all rests upon\nthat: it must be open when you come, and for three hours previously.'\n\n'Trust me,' replied the unsuspecting Sosia; 'I know what a gentleman's\nfeelings are when a door is shut in his face, as the cookshop's hath\nbeen in mine many a day; and I know, also, that a person of\nrespectability, as a demon of course is, cannot but be pleased, on the\nother hand, with any little mark of courteous hospitality.  Meanwhile,\npretty one, here is thy morning's meal.'\n\n'But what of the trial?'\n\n'Oh, the lawyers are still at it--talk, talk--it will last over all\nto-morrow.'\n\n'To-morrow?  You are sure of that?'\n\n'So I hear.'\n\n'And Ione?'\n\n'By Bacchus! she must be tolerably well, for she was strong enough to\nmake my master stamp and bite his lip this morning.  I saw him quit her\napartment with a brow like a thunderstorm.'\n\n'Lodges she near this?'\n\n'No--in the upper apartments.  But I must not stay prating here longer.\nVale!'\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nA WASP VENTURES INTO THE SPIDER'S WEB.\n\nTHE second night of the trial had set in; and it was nearly the time in\nwhich Sosia was to brave the dread Unknown, when there entered, at that\nvery garden-gate which the slave had left ajar--not, indeed, one of the\nmysterious spirits of earth or air, but the heavy and most human form of\nCalenus, the priest of Isis.  He scarcely noted the humble offerings of\nindifferent fruit, and still more indifferent wine, which the pious\nSosia had deemed good enough for the invisible stranger they were\nintended to allure.  'Some tribute,' thought he, 'to the garden god.  By\nmy father's head! if his deityship were never better served, he would do\nwell to give up the godly profession.  Ah! were it not for us priests,\nthe gods would have a sad time of it.  And now for Arbaces--I am\ntreading a quicksand, but it ought to cover a mine.  I have the\nEgyptian's life in my power--what will he value it at?'\n\nAs he thus soliloquised, he crossed through the open court into the\nperistyle, where a few lamps here and there broke upon the empire of the\nstarlit night; and issuing from one of the chambers that bordered the\ncolonnade, suddenly encountered Arbaces.\n\n'Ho! Calenus--seekest thou me?' said the Egyptian; and there was a\nlittle embarrassment in his voice.\n\n'Yes, wise Arbaces--I trust my visit is not unseasonable?'\n\n'Nay--it was but this instant that my freedman Callias sneezed thrice at\nmy right hand; I knew, therefore, some good fortune was in store for\nme--and, lo! the gods have sent me Calenus.'\n\n'Shall we within to your chamber, Arbaces?'\n\n'As you will; but the night is clear and balmy--I have some remains of\nlanguor yet lingering on me from my recent illness--the air refreshes\nme--let us walk in the garden--we are equally alone there.'\n\n'With all my heart,' answered the priest; and the two friends passed\nslowly to one of the many terraces which, bordered by marble vases and\nsleeping flowers, intersected the garden.\n\n'It is a lovely night,' said Arbaces--'blue and beautiful as that on\nwhich, twenty years ago, the shores of Italy first broke upon my view.\nMy Calenus, age creeps upon us--let us, at least, feel that we have\nlived.'\n\n'Thou, at least, mayst arrogate that boast,' said Calenus, beating\nabout, as it were, for an opportunity to communicate the secret which\nweighed upon him, and feeling his usual awe of Arbaces still more\nimpressively that night, from the quiet and friendly tone of dignified\ncondescension which the Egyptian assumed--'Thou, at least, mayst\narrogate that boast.  Thou hast had countless wealth--a frame on whose\nclose-woven fibres disease can find no space to enter--prosperous\nlove--inexhaustible pleasure--and, even at this hour, triumphant\nrevenge.'\n\n'Thou alludest to the Athenian.  Ay, to-morrow's sun the fiat of his\ndeath will go forth.  The senate does not relent.  But thou mistakest:\nhis death gives me no other gratification than that it releases me from\na rival in the affections of Ione.  I entertain no other sentiment of\nanimosity against that unfortunate homicide.'\n\n'Homicide!' repeated Calenus, slowly and meaningly; and, halting as he\nspoke, he fixed his eyes upon Arbaces.  The stars shone pale and\nsteadily on the proud face of their prophet, but they betrayed there no\nchange: the eyes of Calenus fell disappointed and abashed.  He continued\nrapidly--'Homicide! it is well to charge him with that crime; but thou,\nof all men, knowest that he is innocent.'\n\n'Explain thyself,' said Arbaces, coldly; for he had prepared himself for\nthe hint his secret fears had foretold.\n\n'Arbaces,' answered Calenus, sinking his voice into a whisper, 'I was in\nthe sacred grove, sheltered by the chapel and the surrounding foliage.\nI overheard--I marked the whole.  I saw thy weapon pierce the heart of\nApaecides.  I blame not the deed--it destroyed a foe and an apostate.'\n\n'Thou sawest the whole!' said Arbaces, dryly; 'so I imagined--thou wert\nalone.'\n\n'Alone!' returned Calenus, surprised at the Egyptian's calmness.\n\n'And wherefore wert thou hid behind the chapel at that hour?'\n\n'Because I had learned the conversion of Apaecides to the Christian\nfaith--because I knew that on that spot he was to meet the fierce\nOlinthus--because they were to meet there to discuss plans for unveiling\nthe sacred mysteries of our goddess to the people--and I was there to\ndetect, in order to defeat them.'\n\n'Hast thou told living ear what thou didst witness?'\n\n'No, my master: the secret is locked in thy servant's breast.'\n\n'What! even thy kinsman Burbo guesses it not!  Come, the truth!'\n\n'By the gods...'\n\n'Hush! we know each other--what are the gods to us?'\n\n'By the fear of thy vengeance, then--no!'\n\n'And why hast thou hitherto concealed from me this secret?  Why hast\nthou waited till the eve of the Athenian's condemnation before thou hast\nventured to tell me that Arbaces is a murderer?  And having tarried so\nlong, why revealest thou now that knowledge?'\n\n'Because--because...' stammered Calenus, coloring and in confusion.\n\n'Because,' interrupted Arbaces, with a gentle smile, and tapping the\npriest on the shoulder with a kindly and familiar gesture--'because,\nmy Calenus (see now, I will read thy heart, and explain its\nmotives)--because thou didst wish thoroughly to commit and entangle me\nin the trial, so that I might have no loophole of escape; that I might\nstand firmly pledged to perjury and to malice, as well as to homicide;\nthat having myself whetted the appetite of the populace to blood, no\nwealth, no power, could prevent my becoming their victim: and thou\ntellest me thy secret now, ere the trial be over and the innocent\ncondemned, to show what a desperate web of villainy thy word to-morrow\ncould destroy; to enhance in this, the ninth hour, the price of thy\nforbearance; to show that my own arts, in arousing the popular wrath,\nwould, at thy witness, recoil upon myself; and that if not for Glaucus,\nfor me would gape the jaws of the lion! Is it not so?'\n\n'Arbaces, replied Calenus, losing all the vulgar audacity of his natural\ncharacter, 'verily thou art a Magician; thou readest the heart as it\nwere a scroll.'\n\n'It is my vocation,' answered the Egyptian, laughing gently. 'Well,\nthen, forbear; and when all is over, I will make thee rich.'\n\n'Pardon me,' said the priest, as the quick suggestion of that avarice,\nwhich was his master-passion, bade him trust no future chance of\ngenerosity; 'pardon me; thou saidst right--we know each other.  If thou\nwouldst have me silent, thou must pay something in advance, as an offer\nto Harpocrates.' If the rose, sweet emblem of discretion, is to take\nroot firmly, water her this night with a stream of gold.'\n\n'Witty and poetical!' answered Arbaces, still in that bland voice which\nlulled and encouraged, when it ought to have alarmed and checked, his\ngriping comrade.  'Wilt thou not wait the morrow?'\n\n'Why this delay?  Perhaps, when I can no longer give my testimony\nwithout shame for not having given it ere the innocent man suffered,\nthou wilt forget my claim; and, indeed, thy present hesitation is a bad\nomen of thy future gratitude.'\n\n'Well, then, Calenus, what wouldst thou have me pay thee?'\n\n'Thy life is, very precious, and thy wealth is very great,' returned the\npriest, grinning.\n\n'Wittier and more witty.  But speak out--what shall be the sum?'\n\n'Arbaces, I have heard that in thy secret treasury below, beneath those\nrude Oscan arches which prop thy stately halls, thou hast piles of gold,\nof vases, and of jewels, which might rival the receptacles of the wealth\nof the deified Nero.  Thou mayst easily spare out of those piles enough\nto make Calenus among the richest priests of Pompeii, and yet not miss\nthe loss.'\n\n'Come, Calenus,' said Arbaces, winningly, and with a frank and generous\nair, 'thou art an old friend, and hast been a faithful servant.  Thou\ncanst have no wish to take away my life, nor I a desire to stint thy\nreward: thou shalt descend with me to that treasury thou referrest to,\nthou shalt feast thine eyes with the blaze of uncounted gold and the\nsparkle of priceless gems; and thou shalt for thy own reward, bear away\nwith thee this night as much as thou canst conceal beneath thy robes.\nNay, when thou hast once seen what thy friend possesses, thou wilt learn\nhow foolish it would be to injure one who has so much to bestow.  When\nGlaucus is no more, thou shalt pay the treasury another visit.  Speak I\nfrankly and as a friend?'\n\n'Oh, greatest, best of men!' cried Calenus, almost weeping with joy,\n'canst thou thus forgive my injurious doubts of thy justice, thy\ngenerosity?'\n\n'Hush! one other turn and we will descend to the Oscan arches.'\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\nTHE SLAVE CONSULTS THE ORACLE.  THEY WHO BLIND THEMSELVES THE BLIND MAY\nFOOL.  TWO NEW PRISONERS MADE IN ONE NIGHT.\n\nIMPATIENTLY Nydia awaited the arrival of the no less anxious Sosia.\nFortifying his courage by plentiful potations of a better liquor than\nthat provided for the demon, the credulous ministrant stole into the\nblind girl's chamber.\n\n'Well, Sosia, and art thou prepared?  Hast thou the bowl of pure water?'\n\n'Verily, yes: but I tremble a little.  You are sure I shall not see the\ndemon?  I have heard that those gentlemen are by no means of a handsome\nperson or a civil demeanor.'\n\n'Be assured!  And hast thou left the garden-gate gently open?'\n\n'Yes; and placed some beautiful nuts and apples on a little table close\nby?'\n\n'That's well.  And the gate is open now, so that the demon may pass\nthrough it?'\n\n'Surely it is.'\n\n'Well, then, open this door; there--leave it just ajar.  And now, Sosia,\ngive me the lamp.'\n\n'What, you will not extinguish it?'\n\n'No; but I must breathe my spell over its ray.  There is a spirit in\nfire. Seat thyself.'\n\nThe slave obeyed; and Nydia, after bending for some moments silently\nover the lamp, rose, and in a low voice chanted the following rude:--\n\n     INVOCATION TO THE SPECTRE OF THE AIR\n\n       Loved alike by Air and Water\n        Aye must be Thessalia's daughter;\n        To us, Olympian hearts, are given\n        Spells that draw the moon from heaven.\n          All that Egypt's learning wrought--\n        All that Persia's Magian taught--\n       Won from song, or wrung from flowers,\n        Or whisper'd low by fiend--are ours.\n\n       Spectre of the viewless air!\n        Hear the blind Thessalian's prayer!\n        By Erictho's art, that shed\n        Dews of life when life was fled--\n       By lone Ithaca's wise king,\n\n        Who could wake the crystal spring\n        To the voice of prophecy?\n        By the lost Eurydice,\n        Summon'd from the shadowy throng,\n        As the muse-son's magic song--\n       By the Colchian's awful charms,\n        When fair-haired Jason left her arms--\n\n       Spectre of the airy halls,\n        One who owns thee duly calls!\n        Breathe along the brimming bowl,\n        And instruct the fearful soul\n        In the shadowy things that lie\n        Dark in dim futurity.\n        Come, wild demon of the air,\n        Answer to thy votary's prayer!\n          Come! oh, come!\n\n       And no god on heaven or earth--\n       Not the Paphian Queen of Mirth,\n        Not the vivid Lord of Light,\n        Nor the triple Maid of Night,\n        Nor the Thunderer's self shall be\n        Blest and honour'd more than thee!\n          Come! oh, come!\n\n'The spectre is certainly coming,' said Sosia.  'I feel him running\nalong my hair!'\n\n'Place thy bowl of water on the ground.  Now, then, give me thy napkin,\nand let me fold up thy face and eyes.'\n\n'Ay! that's always the custom with these charms.  Not so tight, though:\ngently--gently!'\n\n'There--thou canst not see?'\n\n'See, by Jupiter!  No!  nothing but darkness.'\n\n'Address, then, to the spectre whatever question thou wouldst ask him,\nin a low-whispered voice, three times.  If thy question is answered in\nthe affirmative, thou wilt hear the water ferment and bubble before the\ndemon breathes upon it; if in the negative, the water will be quite\nsilent.'\n\n'But you will not play any trick with the water, eh?'\n\n'Let me place the bowl under thy feet--so.  Now thou wilt perceive that\nI cannot touch it without thy knowledge.'\n\n'Very fair.  Now, then, O Bacchus! befriend me.  Thou knowest that I\nhave always loved thee better than all the other gods, and I will\ndedicate to thee that silver cup I stole last year from the burly\ncarptor (butler), if thou wilt but befriend me with this water-loving\ndemon.  And thou, O Spirit! listen and hear me.  Shall I be enabled to\npurchase my freedom next year? Thou knowest; for, as thou livest in the\nair, the birds have doubtless acquainted thee with every secret of this\nhouse,--thou knowest that I have filched and pilfered all that I\nhonestly--that is, safely--could lay finger upon for the last three\nyears, and I yet want two thousand sesterces of the full sum.  Shall I\nbe able, O good Spirit! to make up the deficiency in the course of this\nyear?  Speak--Ha! does the water bubble?  No; all is as still as a\ntomb.--Well, then, if not this year, in two years?--Ah! I hear\nsomething; the demon is scratching at the door; he'll be here\npresently.--In two years, my good fellow: come now, two; that's a very\nreasonable time. What! dumb still!  Two years and a half--three--four?\nill fortune to you, friend demon!  You are not a lady, that's clear, or\nyou would not keep silence so long.  Five--six--sixty years? and may\nPluto seize you!  I'll ask no more.' And Sosia, in a rage, kicked down\nthe water over his legs.  He then, after much fumbling and more cursing,\nmanaged to extricate his head from the napkin in which it was completely\nfolded--stared round--and discovered that he was in the dark.\n\n'What, ho! Nydia; the lamp is gone.  Ah, traitress; and thou art gone\ntoo; but I'll catch thee--thou shalt smart for this!' The slave groped\nhis way to the door; it was bolted from without: he was a prisoner\ninstead of Nydia. What could he do?  He did not dare to knock loud--to\ncall out--lest Arbaces should overhear him, and discover how he had been\nduped; and Nydia, meanwhile, had probably already gained the\ngarden-gate, and was fast on her escape.\n\n'But,' thought he, 'she will go home, or, at least, be somewhere in the\ncity.  To-morrow, at dawn, when the slaves are at work in the peristyle,\nI can make myself heard; then I can go forth and seek her.  I shall be\nsure to find and bring her back, before Arbaces knows a word of the\nmatter.  Ah! that's the best plan.  Little traitress, my fingers itch at\nthee: and to leave only a bowl of water, too!  Had it been wine, it\nwould have been some comfort.'\n\nWhile Sosia, thus entrapped, was lamenting his fate, and revolving his\nschemes to repossess himself of Nydia, the blind girl, with that\nsingular precision and dexterous rapidity of motion, which, we have\nbefore observed, was peculiar to her, had passed lightly along the\nperistyle, threaded the opposite passage that led into the garden, and,\nwith a beating heart, was about to proceed towards the gate, when she\nsuddenly heard the sound of approaching steps, and distinguished the\ndreaded voice of Arbaces himself. She paused for a moment in doubt and\nterror; then suddenly it flashed across her recollection that there was\nanother passage which was little used except for the admission of the\nfair partakers of the Egyptian's secret revels, and which wound along\nthe basement of that massive fabric towards a door which also\ncommunicated with the garden.  By good fortune it might be open.  At\nthat thought, she hastily retraced her steps, descended the narrow\nstairs at the right, and was soon at the entrance of the passage.  Alas!\nthe door at the entrance was closed and secured. While she was yet\nassuring herself that it was indeed locked, she heard behind her the\nvoice of Calenus, and, a moment after, that of Arbaces in low reply.\nShe could not stay there; they were probably passing to that very door.\nShe sprang onward, and felt herself in unknown ground.  The air grew\ndamp and chill; this reassured her. She thought she might be among the\ncellars of the luxurious mansion, or, at least, in some rude spot not\nlikely to be visited by its haughty lord, when again her quick ear\ncaught steps and the sound of voices. On, on, she hurried, extending her\narms, which now frequently encountered pillars of thick and massive\nform.  With a tact, doubled in acuteness by her fear, she escaped these\nperils, and continued her way, the air growing more and more damp as she\nproceeded; yet, still, as she ever and anon paused for breath, she heard\nthe advancing steps and the indistinct murmur of voices.  At length she\nwas abruptly stopped by a wall that seemed the limit of her path. Was\nthere no spot in which she could hide?  No aperture? no cavity?  There\nwas none!  She stopped, and wrung her hands in despair; then again,\nnerved as the voices neared upon her, she hurried on by the side of the\nwall; and coming suddenly against one of the sharp buttresses that here\nand there jutted boldly forth, she fell to the ground.  Though much\nbruised, her senses did not leave her; she uttered no cry; nay, she\nhailed the accident that had led her to something like a screen; and\ncreeping close up to the angle formed by the buttress, so that on one\nside at least she was sheltered from view, she gathered her slight and\nsmall form into its smallest compass, and breathlessly awaited her fate.\n\nMeanwhile Arbaces and the priest were taking their way to that secret\nchamber whose stores were so vaunted by the Egyptian.  They were in a\nvast subterranean atrium, or hall; the low roof was supported by short,\nthick pillars of an architecture far remote from the Grecian graces of\nthat luxuriant period.  The single and pale lamp, which Arbaces bore,\nshed but an imperfect ray over the bare and rugged walls, in which the\nhuge stones, without cement, were fitted curiously and uncouthly into\neach other.  The disturbed reptiles glared dully on the intruders, and\nthen crept into the shadow of the walls.\n\nCalenus shivered as he looked around and breathed the damp, unwholesome\nair.\n\n'Yet,' said Arbaces, with a smile, perceiving his shudder, 'it is these\nrude abodes that furnish the luxuries of the halls above. They are like\nthe laborers of the world--we despise their ruggedness, yet they feed\nthe very pride that disdains them.'\n\n'And whither goes yon dim gallery to the left asked Calenus; 'in this\ndepth of gloom it seems without limit, as if winding into Hades.'\n\n'On the contrary, it does but conduct to the upper rooms,' answered\nArbaces, carelessly: 'it is to the right that we steer to our bourn.'\n\nThe hall, like many in the more habitable regions of Pompeii, branched\noff at the extremity into two wings or passages; the length of which,\nnot really great, was to the eye considerably exaggerated by the sudden\ngloom against which the lamp so faintly struggled.  To the right of\nthese alae, the two comrades now directed their steps.\n\n'The gay Glaucus will be lodged to-morrow in apartments not much drier,\nand far less spacious than this,' said Calenus, as they passed by the\nvery spot where, completely wrapped in the shadow of the broad,\nprojecting buttress, cowered the Thessalian.\n\n'Ay, but then he will have dry room, and ample enough, in the arena on\nthe following day.  And to think,' continued Arbaces, slowly, and very\ndeliberately--'to think that a word of thine could save him, and consign\nArbaces to his doom!'\n\n'That word shall never be spoken,' said Calenus.\n\n'Right, my Calenus! it never shall,' returned Arbaces, familiarly\nleaning his arm on the priest's shoulder: 'and now, halt--we are at the\ndoor.'\n\nThe light trembled against a small door deep set in the wall, and\nguarded strongly by many plates and bindings of iron, that intersected\nthe rough and dark wood.  From his girdle Arbaces now drew a small ring,\nholding three or four short but strong keys.  Oh, how beat the griping\nheart of Calenus, as he heard the rusty wards growl, as if resenting the\nadmission to the treasures they guarded!\n\n'Enter, my friend,' said Arbaces, 'while I hold the lamp on high, that\nthou mayst glut thine eyes on the yellow heaps.'\n\nThe impatient Calenus did not wait to be twice invited; he hastened\ntowards the aperture.\n\nScarce had he crossed the threshold, when the strong hand of Arbaces\nplunged him forwards.\n\n'The word shall never be spoken!' said the Egyptian, with a loud\nexultant laugh, and closed the door upon the priest.\n\nCalenus had been precipitated down several steps, but not feeling at the\nmoment the pain of his fall, he sprung up again to the door, and beating\nat it fiercely with his clenched fist, he cried aloud in what seemed\nmore a beast's howl than a human voice, so keen was his agony and\ndespair: 'Oh, release me, release me, and I will ask no gold!'\n\nThe words but imperfectly penetrated the massive door, and Arbaces again\nlaughed.  Then, stamping his foot violently, rejoined, perhaps to give\nvent to his long-stifled passions:\n\n'All the gold of Dalmatia,' cried he, 'will not buy thee a crust of\nbread. Starve, wretch! thy dying groans will never wake even the echo of\nthese vast halls; nor will the air ever reveal, as thou gnawest, in thy\ndesperate famine, thy flesh from thy bones, that so perishes the man who\nthreatened, and could have undone, Arbaces! Farewell!'\n\n'Oh, pity--mercy! Inhuman villain; was it for this...'\n\nThe rest of the sentence was lost to the ear of Arbaces as he passed\nbackward along the dim hall.  A toad, plump and bloated, lay unmoving\nbefore his path; the rays of the lamp fell upon its unshaped hideousness\nand red upward eye.  Arbaces turned aside that he might not harm it.\n\n'Thou art loathsome and obscene,' he muttered, 'but thou canst not\ninjure me; therefore thou art safe in my path.'\n\nThe cries of Calenus, dulled and choked by the barrier that confined\nhim, yet faintly reached the ear of the Egyptian.  He paused and\nlistened intently.\n\n'This is unfortunate,' thought he; 'for I cannot sail till that voice is\ndumb for ever.  My stores and treasures lie, not in yon dungeon it is\ntrue, but in the opposite wing.  My slaves, as they move them, must not\nhear his voice.  But what fear of that?  In three days, if he still\nsurvive, his accents, by my father's beard, must be weak enough,\nthen!--no, they could not pierce even through his tomb.  By Isis, it is\ncold!--I long for a deep draught of the spiced Falernian.'\n\nWith that the remorseless Egyptian drew his gown closer round him, and\nresought the upper air.\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\nNYDIA ACCOSTS CALENUS.\n\nWHAT words of terror, yet of hope, had Nydia overheard!  The next day\nGlaucus was to be condemned; yet there lived one who could save him, and\nadjudge Arbaces to his doom, and that one breathed within a few steps of\nher hiding-place!  She caught his cries and shrieks--his\nimprecations--his prayers, though they fell choked and muffled on her\near.  He was imprisoned, but she knew the secret of his cell: could she\nbut escape--could she but seek the praetor he might yet in time be given\nto light, and preserve the Athenian.  Her emotions almost stifled her;\nher brain reeled--she felt her sense give way--but by a violent effort\nshe mastered herself,--and, after listening intently for several\nminutes, till she was convinced that Arbaces had left the space to\nsolitude and herself, she crept on as her ear guided her to the very\ndoor that had closed upon Calenus.  Here she more distinctly caught his\naccents of terror and despair.  Thrice she attempted to speak, and\nthrice her voice failed to penetrate the folds of the heavy door.  At\nlength finding the lock, she applied her lips to its small aperture, and\nthe prisoner distinctly heard a soft tone breathe his name.\n\nHis blood curdled--his hair stood on end.  That awful solitude, what\nmysterious and preternatural being could penetrate!  'Who's there?' he\ncried, in new alarm; 'what spectre--what dread larva, calls upon the\nlost Calenus?'\n\n'Priest,' replied the Thessalian, 'unknown to Arbaces, I have been, by\nthe permission of the gods, a witness to his perfidy.  If I myself can\nescape from these walls, I may save thee.  But let thy voice reach my\near through this narrow passage, and answer what I ask.'\n\n'Ah, blessed spirit,' said the priest, exultingly, and obeying the\nsuggestion of Nydia, 'save me, and I will sell the very cups on the\naltar to pay thy kindness.'\n\n'I want not thy gold--I want thy secret.  Did I hear aright? Canst thou\nsave the Athenian Glaucus from the charge against his life?'\n\n'I can--I can!--therefore (may the Furies blast the foul Egyptian!) hath\nArbaces snared me thus, and left me to starve and rot!'\n\n'They accuse the Athenian of murder: canst thou disprove the\naccusation?'\n\n'Only free me, and the proudest head of Pompeii is not more safe than\nhis. I saw the deed done--I saw Arbaces strike the blow; I can convict\nthe true murderer and acquit the innocent man.  But if I perish, he dies\nalso.  Dost thou interest thyself for him?  Oh, blessed stranger, in my\nheart is the urn which condemns or frees him!'\n\n'And thou wilt give full evidence of what thou knowest?'\n\n'Will!--Oh! were hell at my feet--yes!  Revenge on the false\nEgyptian!--revenge!--revenge! revenge!'\n\nAs through his ground teeth Calenus shrieked forth those last words,\nNydia felt that in his worst passions was her certainty of his justice\nto the Athenian.  Her heart beat: was it to be her proud destiny to\npreserve her idolized--her adored?  Enough,' said she, 'the powers that\nconducted me hither will carry me through all.  Yes, I feel that I shall\ndeliver thee. Wait in patience and hope.'\n\n'But be cautious, be prudent, sweet stranger.  Attempt not to appeal to\nArbaces--he is marble.  Seek the praetor--say what thou knowest--obtain\nhis writ of search; bring soldiers, and smiths of cunning--these locks\nare wondrous strong!  Time flies--I may starve--starve! if you are not\nquick! Go--go!  Yet stay--it is horrible to be alone!--the air is like a\ncharnel--and the scorpions--ha! and the pale larvae; oh! stay, stay!'\n\n'Nay,' said Nydia, terrified by the terror of the priest, and anxious to\nconfer with herself--'nay, for thy sake, I must depart. Take hope for\nthy companion--farewell!'\n\nSo saying, she glided away, and felt with extended arms along the\npillared space until she had gained the farther end of the hall and the\nmouth of the passage that led to the upper air.  But there she paused;\nshe felt that it would be more safe to wait awhile, until the night was\nso far blended with the morning that the whole house would be buried in\nsleep, and so that she might quit it unobserved.  She, therefore, once\nmore laid herself down, and counted the weary moments.  In her sanguine\nheart, joy was the predominant emotion.  Glaucus was in deadly\nperil--but she should save him!\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\nARBACES AND IONE.  NYDIA GAINS THE GARDEN.  WILL SHE ESCAPE AND SAVE THE\nATHENIAN?\n\nWHEN Arbaces had warmed his veins by large draughts of that spiced and\nperfumed wine so valued by the luxurious, he felt more than usually\nelated and exultant of heart.  There is a pride in triumphant ingenuity,\nnot less felt, perhaps, though its object be guilty.  Our vain human\nnature hugs itself in the consciousness of superior craft and\nself-obtained success--afterwards comes the horrible reaction of\nremorse.\n\nBut remorse was not a feeling which Arbaces was likely ever to\nexperience for the fate of the base Calenus.  He swept from his\nremembrance the thought of the priest's agonies and lingering death: he\nfelt only that a great danger was passed, and a possible foe silenced;\nall left to him now would be to account to the priesthood for the\ndisappearance of Calenus; and this he imagined it would not be difficult\nto do.  Calenus had often been employed by him in various religious\nmissions to the neighboring cities.  On some such errand he could now\nassert that he had been sent, with offerings to the shrines of Isis at\nHerculaneum and Neapolis, placatory of the goddess for the recent murder\nof her priest Apaecides.  When Calenus had expired, his body might be\nthrown, previous to the Egyptian's departure from Pompeii, into the deep\nstream of the Sarnus; and when discovered, suspicion would probably fall\nupon the Nazarene atheists, as an act of revenge for the death of\nOlinthus at the arena. After rapidly running over these plans for\nscreening himself, Arbaces dismissed at once from his mind all\nrecollection of the wretched priest; and, animated by the success which\nhad lately crowned all his schemes, he surrendered his thoughts to Ione.\nThe last time he had seen her, she had driven him from her presence by a\nreproachful and bitter scorn, which his arrogant nature was unable to\nendure.  He now felt emboldened once more to renew that interview; for\nhis passion for her was like similar feelings in other men--it made him\nrestless for her presence, even though in that presence he was\nexasperated and humbled.  From delicacy to her grief he laid not aside\nhis dark and unfestive robes, but, renewing the perfumes on his raven\nlocks, and arranging his tunic in its most becoming folds, he sought the\nchamber of the Neapolitan.  Accosting the slave in attendance without,\nhe inquired if Ione had yet retired to rest; and learning that she was\nstill up, and unusually quiet and composed, he ventured into her\npresence.  He found his beautiful ward sitting before a small table, and\nleaning her face upon both her hands in the attitude of thought.  Yet\nthe expression of the face itself possessed not its wonted bright and\nPsyche-like expression of sweet intelligence; the lips were apart--the\neye vacant and unheeding--and the long dark hair, falling neglected and\ndisheveled upon her neck, gave by the contrast additional paleness to a\ncheek which had already lost the roundness of its contour.\n\nArbaces gazed upon her a moment ere he advanced.  She, too, lifted up\nher eyes; and when she saw who was the intruder, shut them with an\nexpression of pain, but did not stir.\n\n'Ah!' said Arbaces in a low and earnest tone as he respectfully, nay,\nhumbly, advanced and seated himself at a little distance from the\ntable--'Ah! that my death could remove thy hatred, then would I gladly\ndie! Thou wrongest me, Ione; but I will bear the wrong without a murmur,\nonly let me see thee sometimes.  Chide, reproach, scorn me, if thou\nwilt--I will teach myself to bear it.  And is not even thy bitterest\ntone sweeter to me than the music of the most artful lute? In thy\nsilence the world seems to stand still--a stagnation curdles up the\nveins of the earth--there is no earth, no life, without the light of thy\ncountenance and the melody of thy voice.'\n\n'Give me back my brother and my betrothed,' said Ione, in a calm and\nimploring tone, and a few large tears rolled unheeded down her cheeks.\n\n'Would that I could restore the one and save the other!' returned\nArbaces, with apparent emotion.  'Yes; to make thee happy I would\nrenounce my ill-fated love, and gladly join thy hand to the Athenian's.\nPerhaps he will yet come unscathed from his trial (Arbaces had prevented\nher learning that the trial had already commenced); if so, thou art free\nto judge or condemn him thyself.  And think not, O Ione, that I would\nfollow thee longer with a prayer of love.  I know it is in vain.  Suffer\nme only to weep--to mourn with thee.  Forgive a violence deeply\nrepented, and that shall offend no more.  Let me be to thee only what I\nonce was--a friend, a father, a Protector.  Ah, Ione! spare me and\nforgive.'\n\n'I forgive thee.  Save but Glaucus, and I will renounce him.  O mighty\nArbaces! thou art powerful in evil or in good: save the Athenian, and\nthe poor Ione will never see him more.' As she spoke, she rose with weak\nand trembling limbs, and falling at his feet, she clasped his knees:\n'Oh! if thou really lovest me--if thou art human--remember my father's\nashes, remember my childhood, think of all the hours we passed happily\ntogether, and save my Glaucus!'\n\nStrange convulsions shook the frame of the Egyptian; his features worked\nfearfully--he turned his face aside, and said, in a hollow voice, 'If I\ncould save him, even now, I would; but the Roman law is stern and sharp.\nYet if I could succeed--if I could rescue and set him free--wouldst thou\nbe mine--my bride?'\n\n'Thine?' repeated Ione, rising: 'thine!--thy bride?  My brother's blood\nis unavenged: who slew him?  O Nemesis, can I even sell, for the life of\nGlaucus, thy solemn trust?  Arbaces--thine?  Never.'\n\n'Ione, Ione!' cried Arbaces, passionately; 'why these mysterious\nwords?--why dost thou couple my name with the thought of thy brother's\ndeath?'\n\n'My dreams couple it--and dreams are from the gods.'\n\n'Vain fantasies all!  Is it for a dream that thou wouldst wrong the\ninnocent, and hazard thy sole chance of saving thy lover's life?'\n\n'Hear me!' said Ione, speaking firmly, and with a deliberate and solemn\nvoice: 'If Glaucus be saved by thee, I will never be borne to his home a\nbride.  But I cannot master the horror of other rites: I cannot wed with\nthee.  Interrupt me not; but mark me, Arbaces!--if Glaucus die, on that\nsame day I baffle thine arts, and leave to thy love only my dust!\nYes--thou mayst put the knife and the poison from my reach--thou mayst\nimprison--thou mayst chain me, but the brave soul resolved to escape is\nnever without means.  These hands, naked and unarmed though they be,\nshall tear away the bonds of life.  Fetter them, and these lips shall\nfirmly refuse the air. Thou art learned--thou hast read how women have\ndied rather than meet dishonour.  If Glaucus perish, I will not\nunworthily linger behind him.  By all the gods of the heaven, and the\nocean, and the earth, I devote myself to death!  I have said!'\n\nHigh, proud, dilating in her stature, like one inspired, the air and\nvoice of Ione struck an awe into the breast of her listener.\n\n'Brave heart!' said he, after a short pause; 'thou art indeed worthy to\nbe mine.  Oh! that I should have dreamt of such a partner in my lofty\ndestinies, and never found it but in thee! Ione,' he continued rapidly,\n'dost thou not see that we are born for each other? Canst thou not\nrecognize something kindred to thine own energy--thine own courage--in\nthis high and self-dependent soul?  We were formed to unite our\nsympathies--formed to breathe a new spirit into this hackneyed and gross\nworld--formed for the mighty ends which my soul, sweeping down the gloom\nof time, foresees with a prophet's vision.  With a resolution equal to\nthine own, I defy thy threats of an inglorious suicide.  I hail thee as\nmy own!  Queen of climes undarkened by the eagle's wing, unravaged by\nhis beak, I bow before thee in homage and in awe--but I claim thee in\nworship and in love! Together will we cross the ocean--together will we\nfound our realm; and far distant ages shall acknowledge the long race of\nkings born from the marriage-bed of Arbaces and Ione!'\n\n'Thou ravest!  These mystic declamations are suited rather to some\npalsied crone selling charms in the market-place than to the wise\nArbaces.  Thou hast heard my resolution--it is fixed as the Fates\nthemselves.  Orcus has heard my vow, and it is written in the book of\nthe unforgetful Hades. Atone, then, O Arbaces!--atone the past: convert\nhatred into regard--vengeance into gratitude; preserve one who shall\nnever be thy rival. These are acts suited to thy original nature, which\ngives forth sparks of something high and noble.  They weigh in the\nscales of the Kings of Death: they turn the balance on that day when the\ndisembodied soul stands shivering and dismayed between Tartarus and\nElysium; they gladden the heart in life, better and longer than the\nreward of a momentary passion.  Oh, Arbaces! hear me, and be swayed!'\n\n'Enough, Ione.  All that I can do for Glaucus shall be done; but blame\nme not if I fail.  Inquire of my foes, even, if I have not sought, if I\ndo not seek, to turn aside the sentence from his head; and judge me\naccordingly. Sleep then, Ione.  Night wanes; I leave thee to rest--and\nmayst thou have kinder dreams of one who has no existence but in thine.'\n\nWithout waiting a reply, Arbaces hastily withdrew; afraid, perhaps, to\ntrust himself further to the passionate prayer of Ione, which racked him\nwith jealousy, even while it touched him to compassion.  But compassion\nitself came too late.  Had Ione even pledged him her hand as his reward,\nhe could not now--his evidence given--the populace excited--have saved\nthe Athenian. Still made sanguine by his very energy of mind, he threw\nhimself on the chances of the future, and believed he should yet triumph\nover the woman that had so entangled his passions.\n\nAs his attendants assisted to unrobe him for the night, the thought of\nNydia flashed across him.  He felt it was necessary that Ione should\nnever learn of her lover's frenzy, lest it might excuse his imputed\ncrime; and it was possible that her attendants might inform her that\nNydia was under his roof, and she might desire to see her.  As this idea\ncrossed him, he turned to one of his freedmen:\n\n'Go, Callias,' said he, 'forthwith to Sosia, and tell him, that on no\npretence is he to suffer the blind slave Nydia out of her chamber.  But,\nstay--first seek those in attendance upon my ward, and caution them not\nto inform her that the blind girl is under my roof Go--quick!'\n\nThe freedman hastened to obey.  After having discharged his commission\nwith respect to Ione's attendants, he sought the worthy Sosia.  He found\nhim not in the little cell which was apportioned for his cubiculum; he\ncalled his name aloud, and from Nydia's chamber, close at hand, he heard\nthe voice of Sosia reply:\n\n'Oh, Callias, is it you that I hear?--the gods be praised!' Open the\ndoor, I pray you!'\n\nCallias withdrew the bolt, and the rueful face of Sosia hastily\nprotruded itself.\n\n'What!--in the chamber with that young girl, Sosia! Proh pudor! Are\nthere not fruits ripe enough on the wall, but that thou must tamper with\nsuch green...'\n\n'Name not the little witch!' interrupted Sosia, impatiently; 'she will\nbe my ruin!' And he forthwith imparted to Callias the history of the Air\nDemon, and the escape of the Thessalian.\n\n'Hang thyself, then, unhappy Sosia!  I am just charged from Arbaces with\na message to thee; on no account art thou to suffer her, even for a\nmoment, from that chamber!'\n\n'Me miserum!' exclaimed the slave.  'What can I do!--by this time she\nmay have visited half Pompeii.  But tomorrow I will undertake to catch\nher in her old haunts.  Keep but my counsel, my dear Callias.'\n\n'I will do all that friendship can, consistent with my own safety. But\nare you sure she has left the house?--she may be hiding here yet.'\n\n'How is that possible?  She could easily have gained the garden; and the\ndoor, as I told thee, was open.'\n\n'Nay, not so; for, at that very hour thou specifiest, Arbaces was in the\ngarden with the priest Calenus.  I went there in search of some herbs\nfor my master's bath to-morrow.  I saw the table set out; but the gate I\nam sure was shut: depend upon it, that Calenus entered by the garden,\nand naturally closed the door after him.'\n\n'But it was not locked.'\n\n'Yes; for I myself, angry at a negligence which might expose the bronzes\nin the peristyle to the mercy of any robber, turned the key, took it\naway, and--as I did not see the proper slave to whom to give it, or I\nshould have rated him finely--here it actually is, still in my girdle.'\n\n'Oh, merciful Bacchus!  I did not pray to thee in vain, after all.  Let\nus not lose a moment!  Let us to the garden instantly--she may yet be\nthere!'\n\nThe good-natured Callias consented to assist the slave; and after vainly\nsearching the chambers at hand, and the recesses of the peristyle, they\nentered the garden.\n\nIt was about this time that Nydia had resolved to quit her hiding-place,\nand venture forth on her way.  Lightly, tremulously holding her breath,\nwhich ever and anon broke forth in quick convulsive gasps--now gliding\nby the flower--wreathed columns that bordered the peristyle--now\ndarkening the still moonshine that fell over its tessellated centre--now\nascending the terrace of the garden--now gliding amidst the gloomy and\nbreathless trees, she gained the fatal door--to find it locked!  We have\nall seen that expression of pain, of uncertainty, of fear, which a\nsudden disappointment of touch, if I may use the expression, casts over\nthe face of the blind. But what words can paint the intolerable woe, the\nsinking of the whole heart, which was now visible on the features of the\nThessalian? Again and again her small, quivering hands wandered to and\nfro the inexorable door. Poor thing that thou wert! in vain had been all\nthy noble courage, thy innocent craft, thy doublings to escape the hound\nand huntsmen!  Within but a few yards from thee, laughing at thy\nendeavors--thy despair--knowing thou wert now their own, and watching\nwith cruel patience their own moment to seize their prey--thou art saved\nfrom seeing thy pursuers!\n\n'Hush, Callias!--let her go on.  Let us see what she will do when she\nhas convinced herself that the door is honest.'\n\n'Look! she raises her face to the heavens--she mutters--she sinks down\ndespondent!  No!  by Pollux, she has some new scheme!  She will not\nresign herself!  By Jupiter, a tough spirit!  See, she springs up--she\nretraces her steps--she thinks of some other chance!--I advise thee,\nSosia, to delay no longer: seize her ere she quit the garden--now!'\n\n'Ah! runaway!  I have thee--eh?' said Sosia, seizing upon the unhappy\nNydia. As a hare's last human cry in the fangs of the dogs--as the sharp\nvoice of terror uttered by a sleep-walker suddenly awakened--broke the\nshriek of the blind girl, when she felt the abrupt gripe of her gaoler.\nIt was a shriek of such utter agony, such entire despair, that it might\nhave rung hauntingly in your ears for ever.  She felt as if the last\nplank of the sinking Glaucus were torn from his clasp!  It had been a\nsuspense of life and death; and death had now won the game.\n\n'Gods! that cry will alarm the house!  Arbaces sleeps full lightly. Gag\nher!' cried Callias.\n\n'Ah! here is the very napkin with which the young witch conjured away my\nreason!  Come, that's right; now thou art dumb as well as blind.'\n\nAnd, catching the light weight in his arms, Sosia soon gained the house,\nand reached the chamber from which Nydia had escaped. There, removing\nthe gag, he left her to a solitude so racked and terrible, that out of\nHades its anguish could scarcely be exceeded.\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\nTHE SORROW OF BOON COMPANIONS FOR OUR AFFLICTIONS.  THE DUNGEON AND ITS\nVICTIMS.\n\nIT was now late on the third and last day of the trial of Glaucus and\nOlinthus.  A few hours after the court had broken up and judgment been\ngiven, a small party of the fashionable youth at Pompeii were assembled\nround the fastidious board of Lepidus.\n\n'So Glaucus denies his crime to the last?' said Clodius.\n\n'Yes; but the testimony of Arbaces was convincing; he saw the blow\ngiven,' answered Lepidus.\n\n'What could have been the cause?'\n\n'Why, the priest was a gloomy and sullen fellow.  He probably rated\nGlaucus soundly about his gay life and gaming habits, and ultimately\nswore he would not consent to his marriage with Ione.  High words arose;\nGlaucus seems to have been full of the passionate god, and struck in\nsudden exasperation. The excitement of wine, the desperation of abrupt\nremorse, brought on the delirium under which he suffered for some days;\nand I can readily imagine, poor fellow! that, yet confused by that\ndelirium, he is even now unconscious of the crime he committed!  Such,\nat least, is the shrewd conjecture of Arbaces, who seems to have been\nmost kind and forbearing in his testimony.'\n\n'Yes; he has made himself generally popular by it.  But, in\nconsideration of these extenuating circumstances, the senate should have\nrelaxed the sentence.'\n\n'And they would have done so, but for the people; but they were\noutrageous. The priest had spared no pains to excite them; and they\nimagined--the ferocious brutes!--because Glaucus was a rich man and a\ngentleman, that he was likely to escape; and therefore they were\ninveterate against him, and doubly resolved upon his sentence.  It\nseems, by some accident or other, that he was never formally enrolled as\na Roman citizen; and thus the senate is deprived of the power to resist\nthe people, though, after all, there was but a majority of three against\nhim.  Ho! the Chian!'\n\n'He looks sadly altered; but how composed and fearless!'\n\n'Ay, we shall see if his firmness will last over to-morrow. But what\nmerit in courage, when that atheistical hound, Olinthus, manifested the\nsame?'\n\n'The blasphemer!  Yes,' said Lepidus, with pious wrath, 'no wonder that\none of the decurions was, but two days ago, struck dead by lightning in\na serene sky.' The gods feel vengeance against Pompeii while the vile\ndesecrator is alive within its walls.'\n\n'Yet so lenient was the senate, that had he but expressed his penitence,\nand scattered a few grains of incense on the altar of Cybele, he would\nhave been let off.  I doubt whether these Nazarenes, had they the state\nreligion, would be as tolerant to us, supposing we had kicked down the\nimage of their Deity, blasphemed their rites, and denied their faith.'\n\n'They give Glaucus one chance, in consideration of the circumstances;\nthey allow him, against the lion, the use of the same stilus wherewith\nhe smote the priest.'\n\n'Hast thou seen the lion? hast thou looked at his teeth and fangs, and\nwilt thou call that a chance?  Why, sword and buckler would be mere reed\nand papyrus against the rush of the mighty beast!  No, I think the true\nmercy has been, not to leave him long in suspense; and it was therefore\nfortunate for him that our benign laws are slow to pronounce, but swift\nto execute; and that the games of the amphitheatre had been, by a sort\nof providence, so long since fixed for to-morrow.  He who awaits death,\ndies twice.'\n\n'As for the Atheist,' said Clodius, 'he is to cope the grim tiger\nnaked-handed.  Well, these combats are past betting on.  Who will take\nthe odds?' A peal of laughter announced the ridicule of the question.\n\n'Poor Clodius!' said the host; 'I to lose a friend is something; but to\nfind no one to bet on the chance of his escape is a worse misfortune to\nthee.'\n\n'Why, it is provoking; it would have been some consolation to him and to\nme to think he was useful to the last.'\n\n'The people,' said the grave Pansa, 'are all delighted with the result.\nThey were so much afraid the sports at the amphitheatre would go off\nwithout a criminal for the beasts; and now, to get two such criminals is\nindeed a joy for the poor fellows!  They work hard; they ought to have\nsome amusement.'\n\n'There speaks the popular Pansa, who never moves without a string of\nclients as long as an Indian triumph.  He is always prating about the\npeople.  Gods! he will end by being a Gracchus!'\n\n'Certainly I am no insolent patrician,' said Pansa, with a generous air.\n\n'Well,' observed Lepidus, 'it would have been assuredly dangerous to have\nbeen merciful at the eve of a beast-fight.  If ever I, though a Roman\nbred and born, come to be tried, pray Jupiter there may be either no\nbeasts in the vivaria, or plenty of criminals in the gaol.'\n\n'And pray,' said one of the party, 'what has become of the poor girl\nwhom Glaucus was to have married?  A widow without being a bride--that\nis hard!'\n\n'Oh,' returned Clodius, 'she is safe under the protection of her\nguardian, Arbaces.  It was natural she should go to him when she had\nlost both lover and brother.'\n\n'By sweet Venus, Glaucus was fortunate among the women.  They say the\nrich Julia was in love with him.'\n\n'A mere fable, my friend,' said Clodius, coxcombically; 'I was with her\nto-day.  If any feeling of the sort she ever conceived, I flatter myself\nthat I have consoled her.'\n\n'Hush, gentlemen!' said Pansa; 'do you not know that Clodius is employed\nat the house of Diomed in blowing hard at the torch?  It begins to burn,\nand will soon shine bright on the shrine of Hymen.'\n\n'Is it so?' said Lepidus.  'What! Clodius become a married man?--Fie!'\n\n'Never fear,' answered Clodius; 'old Diomed is delighted at the notion\nof marrying his daughter to a nobleman, and will come down largely with\nthe sesterces.  You will see that I shall not lock them up in the\natrium.  It will be a white day for his jolly friends, when Clodius\nmarries an heiress.'\n\n'Say you so?' cried Lepidus; 'come, then, a full cup to the health of\nthe fair Julia!'\n\nWhile such was the conversation--one not discordant to the tone of mind\ncommon among the dissipated of that day, and which might perhaps, a\ncentury ago, have found an echo in the looser circles of Paris--while\nsuch, I say, was the conversation in the gaudy triclinium of Lepidus,\nfar different the scene which scowled before the young Athenian.\n\nAfter his condemnation, Glaucus was admitted no more to the gentle\nguardianship of Sallust, the only friend of his distress.  He was led\nalong the forum till the guards stopped at a small door by the side of\nthe temple of Jupiter.  You may see the place still.  The door opened in\nthe centre in a somewhat singular fashion, revolving round on its\nhinges, as it were, like a modern turnstile, so as only to leave half\nthe threshold open at the same time.  Through this narrow aperture they\nthrust the prisoner, placed before him a loaf and a pitcher of water,\nand left him to darkness, and, as he thought, to solitude.  So sudden\nhad been that revolution of fortune which had prostrated him from the\npalmy height of youthful pleasure and successful love to the lowest\nabyss of ignominy, and the horror of a most bloody death, that he could\nscarcely convince himself that he was not held in the meshes of some\nfearful dream.  His elastic and glorious frame had triumphed over a\npotion, the greater part of which he had fortunately not drained.  He\nhad recovered sense and consciousness, but still a dim and misty\ndepression clung to his nerves and darkened his mind.  His natural\ncourage, and the Greek nobility of pride, enabled him to vanquish all\nunbecoming apprehension, and, in the judgment-court, to face his awful\nlot with a steady mien and unquailing eye.  But the consciousness of\ninnocence scarcely sufficed to support him when the gaze of men no\nlonger excited his haughty valor, and he was left to loneliness and\nsilence.  He felt the damps of the dungeon sink chillingly into his\nenfeebled frame.  He--the fastidious, the luxurious, the refined--he who\nhad hitherto braved no hardship and known no sorrow.  Beautiful bird\nthat he was! why had he left his far and sunny clime--the olive-groves\nof his native hills--the music of immemorial streams?  Why had he\nwantoned on his glittering plumage amidst these harsh and ungenial\nstrangers, dazzling the eyes with his gorgeous hues, charming the ear\nwith his blithesome song--thus suddenly to be arrested--caged in\ndarkness--a victim and a prey--his gay flights for ever over--his hymns\nof gladness for ever stilled!  The poor Athenian! his very faults the\nexuberance of a gentle and joyous nature, how little had his past career\nfitted him for the trials he was destined to undergo!  The hoots of the\nmob, amidst whose plaudits he had so often guided his graceful car and\nbounding steeds, still rang gratingly in his ear.  The cold and stony\nfaces of former friends (the co-mates of merry revels) still rose before\nhis eye.  None now were by to soothe, to sustain, the admired, the\nadulated stranger.  These walls opened but on the dread arena of a\nviolent and shameful death.  And Ione! of her, too, he had heard naught;\nno encouraging word, no pitying message; she, too, had forsaken him; she\nbelieved him guilty--and of what crime?--the murder of a brother!  He\nground his teeth--he groaned aloud--and ever and anon a sharp fear shot\nacross him.  In that fell and fierce delirium which had so unaccountably\nseized his soul, which had so ravaged the disordered brain, might he\nnot, indeed, unknowing to himself, have committed the crime of which he\nwas accused?  Yet, as the thought flashed upon him, it was as suddenly\nchecked; for, amidst all the darkness of the past, he thought distinctly\nto recall the dim grove of Cybele, the upward face of the pale dead, the\npause that he had made beside the corpse, and the sudden shock that\nfelled him to the earth.  He felt convinced of his innocence; and yet\nwho, to the latest time, long after his mangled remains were mingled\nwith the elements, would believe him guiltless, or uphold his fame?  As\nhe recalled his interview with Arbaces, and the causes of revenge which\nhad been excited in the heart of that dark and fearful man, he could not\nbut believe that he was the victim of some deep-laid and mysterious\nsnare--the clue and train of which he was lost in attempting to\ndiscover: and Ione--Arbaces loved her--might his rival's success be\nfounded upon his ruin?  That thought cut him more deeply than all; and\nhis noble heart was more stung by jealousy than appalled by fear.  Again\nhe groaned aloud.\n\nA voice from the recess of the darkness answered that burst of anguish.\n'Who (it said) is my companion in this awful hour?  Athenian Glaucus, it\nis thou?'\n\n'So, indeed, they called me in mine hour of fortune: they may have other\nnames for me now.  And thy name, stranger?'\n\n'Is Olinthus, thy co-mate in the prison as the trial.'\n\n'What! he whom they call the Atheist?  Is it the injustice of men that\nhath taught thee to deny the providence of the gods?'\n\n'Alas!' answered Olinthus: 'thou, not I, art the true Atheist, for thou\ndeniest the sole true God--the Unknown One--to whom thy Athenian fathers\nerected an altar.  It is in this hour that I know my God.  He is with me\nin the dungeon; His smile penetrates the darkness; on the eve of death\nmy heart whispers immortality, and earth recedes from me but to bring\nthe weary soul nearer unto heaven.'\n\n'Tell me,' said Glaucus, abruptly, 'did I not hear thy name coupled with\nthat of Apaecides in my trial?  Dost thou believe me guilty?'\n\n'God alone reads the heart! but my suspicion rested not upon thee.'\n\n'On whom then?'\n\n'Thy accuser, Arbaces.'\n\n'Ha! thou cheerest me: and wherefore?'\n\n'Because I know the man's evil breast, and he had cause to fear him who\nis now dead.'\n\nWith that, Olinthus proceeded to inform Glaucus of those details which\nthe reader already knows, the conversion of Apaecides, the plan they had\nproposed for the detection of the impostures of the Egyptian upon the\nyouthful weakness of the proselyte.  'Therefore,' concluded Olinthus,\n'had the deceased encountered Arbaces, reviled his treasons, and\nthreatened detection, the place, the hour, might have favored the wrath\nof the Egyptian, and passion and craft alike dictated the fatal blow.'\n\n'It must have been so!' cried Glaucus, joyfully.  'I am happy.'\n\n'Yet what, O unfortunate! avails to thee now the discovery?  Thou art\ncondemned and fated; and in thine innocence thou wilt perish.'\n\n'But I shall know myself guiltless; and in my mysterious madness I had\nfearful, though momentary, doubts.  Yet tell me, man of a strange creed,\nthinkest thou that for small errors, or for ancestral faults, we are for\never abandoned and accursed by the powers above, whatever name thou\nallottest to them?'\n\n'God is just, and abandons not His creatures for their mere human\nfrailty. God is merciful, and curses none but the wicked who repent\nnot.'\n\n'Yet it seemeth to me as if, in the divine anger, I had been smitten by\na sudden madness, a supernatural and solemn frenzy, wrought not by human\nmeans.'\n\n'There are demons on earth,' answered the Nazarene, fearfully, 'as well\nas there are God and His Son in heaven; and since thou acknowledgest not\nthe last, the first may have had power over thee.'\n\nGlaucus did not reply, and there was a silence for some minutes. At\nlength the Athenian said, in a changed, and soft, and half-hesitating\nvoice. 'Christian, believest thou, among the doctrines of thy creed,\nthat the dead live again--that they who have loved here are united\nhereafter--that beyond the grave our good name shines pure from the\nmortal mists that unjustly dim it in the gross-eyed world--and that the\nstreams which are divided by the desert and the rock meet in the solemn\nHades, and flow once more into one?'\n\n'Believe I that, O Athenian No, I do not believe--I know! and it is that\nbeautiful and blessed assurance which supports me now.  O Cyllene!'\ncontinued Olinthus, passionately, 'bride of my heart! torn from me in\nthe first month of our nuptials,' shall I not see thee yet, and ere many\ndays be past?  Welcome, welcome death, that will bring me to heaven and\nthee!'\n\nThere was something in this sudden burst of human affection which struck\na kindred chord in the soul of the Greek.  He felt, for the first time,\na sympathy greater than mere affliction between him and his companion.\nHe crept nearer towards Olinthus; for the Italians, fierce in some\npoints, were not unnecessarily cruel in others; they spared the separate\ncell and the superfluous chain, and allowed the victims of the arena the\nsad comfort of such freedom and such companionship as the prison would\nafford.\n\n'Yes,' continued the Christian, with holy fervor, 'the immortality of\nthe soul--the resurrection--the reunion of the dead--is the great\nprinciple of our creed--the great truth a God suffered death itself to\nattest and proclaim.  No fabled Elysium--no poetic Orcus--but a pure and\nradiant heritage of heaven itself, is the portion of the good.'\n\n'Tell me, then, thy doctrines, and expound to me thy hopes,' said\nGlaucus, earnestly.\n\nOlinthus was not slow to obey that prayer; and there--as oftentimes in\nthe early ages of the Christian creed--it was in the darkness of the\ndungeon, and over the approach of death, that the dawning Gospel shed\nits soft and consecrating rays.\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\nA CHANCE FOR GLAUCUS.\n\nTHE hours passed in lingering torture over the head of Nydia from the\ntime in which she had been replaced in her cell.\n\nSosia, as if afraid he should be again outwitted, had refrained from\nvisiting her until late in the morning of the following day, and then he\nbut thrust in the periodical basket of food and wine, and hastily\nreclosed the door.  That day rolled on, and Nydia felt herself\npent--barred--inexorably confined, when that day was the judgment-day of\nGlaucus, and when her release would have saved him! Yet knowing, almost\nimpossible as seemed her escape, that the sole chance for the life of\nGlaucus rested on her, this young girl, frail, passionate, and acutely\nsusceptible as she was--resolved not to give way to a despair that would\ndisable her from seizing whatever opportunity might occur.  She kept her\nsenses whenever, beneath the whirl of intolerable thought, they reeled\nand tottered; nay, she took food and wine that she might sustain her\nstrength--that she might be prepared!\n\nShe revolved scheme after scheme of escape, and was forced to dismiss\nall. Yet Sosia was her only hope, the only instrument with which she\ncould tamper.  He had been superstitious in the desire of ascertaining\nwhether he could eventually purchase his freedom.  Blessed gods! might\nhe not be won by the bribe of freedom itself? was she not nearly rich\nenough to purchase it? Her slender arms were covered with bracelets, the\npresents of Ione; and on her neck she yet wore that very chain which, it\nmay be remembered, had occasioned her jealous quarrel with Glaucus, and\nwhich she had afterwards promised vainly to wear for ever.  She waited\nburningly till Sosia should again appear: but as hour after hour passed,\nand he came not, she grew impatient.  Every nerve beat with fever; she\ncould endure the solitude no longer--she groaned, she shrieked\naloud--she beat herself against the door. Her cries echoed along the\nhall, and Sosia, in peevish anger, hastened to see what was the matter,\nand silence his prisoner if possible.\n\n'Ho! ho! what is this?' said he, surlily.  'Young slave, if thou\nscreamest out thus, we must gag thee again.  My shoulders will smart for\nit, if thou art heard by my master.'\n\n'Kind Sosia, chide me not--I cannot endure to be so long alone,'\nanswered Nydia; 'the solitude appals me.  Sit with me, I pray, a little\nwhile.  Nay, fear not that I should attempt to escape; place thy seat\nbefore the door. Keep thine eye on me--I will not stir from this spot.'\n\nSosia, who was a considerable gossip himself, was moved by this address.\nHe pitied one who had nobody to talk with--it was his case too; he\npitied--and resolved to relieve himself.  He took the hint of Nydia,\nplaced a stool before the door, leant his back against it, and replied:\n\n'I am sure I do not wish to be churlish; and so far as a little innocent\nchat goes, I have no objection to indulge you.  But mind, no tricks--no\nmore conjuring!'\n\n'No, no; tell me, dear Sosia, what is the hour?'\n\n'It is already evening--the goats are going home.'\n\n'O gods! how went the trial'\n\n'Both condemned.'\n\nNydia repressed the shriek.  'Well--well, I thought it would be so. When\ndo they suffer?'\n\n'To-morrow, in the amphitheatre.  If it were not for thee, little\nwretch, I should be allowed to go with the rest and see it.'\n\nNydia leant back for some moments.  Nature could endure no more--she had\nfainted away.  But Sosia did not perceive it, for it was the dusk of\neve, and he was full of his own privations.  He went on lamenting the\nloss of so delightful a show, and accusing the injustice of Arbaces for\nsingling him out from all his fellows to be converted into a gaoler; and\nere he had half finished, Nydia, with a deep sigh, recovered the sense\nof life.\n\n'Thou sighest, blind one, at my loss!  Well, that is some comfort.  So\nlong as you acknowledge how much you cost me, I will endeavor not to\ngrumble.  It is hard to be ill-treated, and yet not pitied.'\n\n'Sosia, how much dost thou require to make up the purchase of thy\nfreedom?'\n\n'How much?  Why, about two thousand sesterces.'\n\n'The gods be praised! not more?  Seest thou these bracelets and this\nchain? They are well worth double that sum.  I will give them thee\nif...'\n\n'Tempt me not: I cannot release thee.  Arbaces is a severe and awful\nmaster. Who knows but I might feed the fishes of the Sarnus Alas! all\nthe sesterces in the world would not buy me back into life.  Better a\nlive dog than a dead lion.'\n\n'Sosia, thy freedom!  Think well!  If thou wilt let me out only for one\nlittle hour!--let me out at midnight--I will return ere to-morrow's\ndawn; nay, thou canst go with me.'\n\n'No,' said Sosia, sturdily, 'a slave once disobeyed Arbaces, and he was\nnever more heard of.'\n\n'But the law gives a master no power over the life of a slave.'\n\n'The law is very obliging, but more polite than efficient.  I know that\nArbaces always gets the law on his side.  Besides, if I am once dead,\nwhat law can bring me to life again!'\n\nNydia wrung her hands.  'Is there no hope, then?' said she,\nconvulsively.\n\n'None of escape till Arbaces gives the word.'\n\n'Well, then, said Nydia, quickly, 'thou wilt not, at least, refuse to\ntake a letter for me: thy master cannot kill thee for that.'\n\n'To whom?'\n\n'The praetor.'\n\n'To a magistrate?  No--not I.  I should be made a witness in court, for\nwhat I know; and the way they cross-examine the slaves is by the\ntorture.'\n\n'Pardon: I meant not the praetor--it was a word that escaped me\nunawares: I meant quite another person--the gay Sallust.'\n\n'Oh! and what want you with him?'\n\n'Glaucus was my master; he purchased me from a cruel lord.  He alone has\nbeen kind to me.  He is to die.  I shall never live happily if I cannot,\nin his hour of trial and doom, let him know that one heart is grateful\nto him. Sallust is his friend; he will convey my message.'\n\n'I am sure he will do no such thing.  Glaucus will have enough to think\nof between this and to-morrow without troubling his head about a blind\ngirl.'\n\n'Man,' said Nydia, rising, 'wilt thou become free?  Thou hast the offer\nin thy power; to-morrow it will be too late.  Never was freedom more\ncheaply purchased.  Thou canst easily and unmissed leave home: less than\nhalf an hour will suffice for thine absence.  And for such a trifle wilt\nthou refuse liberty?'\n\nSosia was greatly moved.  It was true that the request was remarkably\nsilly; but what was that to him?  So much the better.  He could lock the\ndoor on Nydia, and, if Arbaces should learn his absence, the offence was\nvenial, and would merit but a reprimand.  Yet, should Nydia's letter\ncontain something more than what she had said--should it speak of her\nimprisonment, as he shrewdly conjectured it would do--what then!  It\nneed never be known to Arbaces that he had carried the letter.  At the\nworst the bribe was enormous--the risk light--the temptation\nirresistible.  He hesitated no longer--he assented to the proposal.\n\n'Give me the trinkets, and I will take the letter.  Yet stay--thou art a\nslave--thou hast no right to these ornaments--they are thy master's.'\n\n'They were the gifts of Glaucus; he is my master.  What chance hath he\nto claim them?  Who else will know they are in my possession?'\n\n'Enough--I will bring thee the papyrus.'\n\n'No, not papyrus--a tablet of wax and a stilus.'\n\nNydia, as the reader will have seen, was born of gentle parents. They\nhad done all to lighten her calamity, and her quick intellect seconded\ntheir exertions.  Despite her blindness, she had therefore acquired in\nchildhood, though imperfectly, the art to write with the sharp stilus\nupon waxen tablets, in which her exquisite sense of touch came to her\naid.  When the tablets were brought to her, she thus painfully traced\nsome words in Greek, the language of her childhood, and which almost\nevery Italian of the higher ranks was then supposed to know.  She\ncarefully wound round the epistle the thread, and covered its knot with\nwax; and ere she placed it in the hands of Sosia, she thus addressed\nhim:\n\n'Sosia, I am blind and in prison.  Thou mayst think to deceive me--thou\nmayst pretend only to take the letter to Sallust--thou mayst not fulfill\nthy charge: but here I solemnly dedicate thy head to vengeance, thy soul\nto the infernal powers, if thou wrongest thy trust; and I call upon thee\nto place thy right hand of faith in mine, and repeat after me these\nwords: \"By the ground on which we stand--by the elements which contain\nlife and can curse life--by Orcus, the all-avenging--by the Olympian\nJupiter, the all-seeing--I swear that I will honestly discharge my\ntrust, and faithfully deliver into the hands of Sallust this letter!\nAnd if I perjure myself in this oath, may the full curses of heaven and\nhell be wreaked upon me!\" Enough!--I trust thee--take thy reward.  It is\nalready dark--depart at once.'\n\n'Thou art a strange girl, and thou hast frightened me terribly; but it\nis all very natural: and if Sallust is to be found, I give him this\nletter as I have sworn.  By my faith, I may have my little peccadilloes!\nbut perjury--no!  I leave that to my betters.'\n\nWith this Sosia withdrew, carefully passing the heavy bolt athwart\nNydia's door--carefully locking its wards: and, hanging the key to his\ngirdle, he retired to his own den, enveloped himself from head to foot\nin a huge disguising cloak, and slipped out by the back way undisturbed\nand unseen.\n\nThe streets were thin and empty.  He soon gained the house of Sallust.\nThe porter bade him leave his letter, and be gone; for Sallust was so\ngrieved at the condemnation of Glaucus, that he could not on any account\nbe disturbed.\n\n'Nevertheless, I have sworn to give this letter into his own hands--do\nso I must!' And Sosia, well knowing by experience that Cerberus loves a\nsop, thrust some half a dozen sesterces into the hand of the porter.\n\n'Well, well,' said the latter, relenting, 'you may enter if you will;\nbut, to tell you the truth, Sallust is drinking himself out of his\ngrief.  It is his way when anything disturbs him.  He orders a capital\nsupper, the best wine, and does not give over till everything is out of\nhis head--but the liquor.'\n\n'An excellent plan--excellent!  Ah, what it is to be rich!  If I were\nSallust, I would have some grief or another every day.  But just say a\nkind word for me with the atriensis--I see him coming.'\n\nSallust was too sad to receive company; he was too sad, also, to drink\nalone; so, as was his wont, he admitted his favorite freedman to his\nentertainment, and a stranger banquet never was held.  For ever and\nanon, the kind-hearted epicure sighed, whimpered, wept outright, and\nthen turned with double zest to some new dish or his refilled goblet.\n\n'My good fellow,' said he to his companion, it was a most awful\njudgment--heigho!--it is not bad that kid, eh?  Poor, dear\nGlaucus!--what a jaw the lion has too!  Ah, ah, ah!'\n\nAnd Sallust sobbed loudly--the fit was stopped by a counteraction of\nhiccups.\n\n'Take a cup of wine,' said the freedman.\n\n'A thought too cold: but then how cold Glaucus must be!  Shut up the\nhouse to-morrow--not a slave shall stir forth--none of my people shall\nhonour that cursed arena--No, no!'\n\n'Taste the Falernian--your grief distracts you.  By the gods it does--a\npiece of that cheesecake.'\n\nIt was at this auspicious moment that Sosia was admitted to the presence\nof the disconsolate carouser.\n\n'Ho--what art thou?'\n\n'Merely a messenger to Sallust.  I give him this billet from a young\nfemale. There is no answer that I know of.  May I withdraw?'\n\nThus said the discreet Sosia, keeping his face muffled in his cloak, and\nspeaking with a feigned voice, so that he might not hereafter be\nrecognized.\n\n'By the gods--a pimp!  Unfeeling wretch!--do you not see my sorrows?\nGo! and the curses of Pandarus with you!'\n\nSosia lost not a moment in retiring.\n\n'Will you read the letter, Sallust?' said the freedman.\n\n'Letter!--which letter?' said the epicure, reeling, for he began to see\ndouble.  'A curse on these wenches, say I!  Am I a man to think\nof--(hiccup)--pleasure, when--when--my friend is going to be eat up?'\n\n'Eat another tartlet.'\n\n'No, no!  My grief chokes me!'\n\n'Take him to bed,' said the freedman; and, Sallust's head now declining\nfairly on his breast, they bore him off to his cubiculum, still\nmuttering lamentations for Glaucus, and imprecations on the unfeeling\novertures of ladies of pleasure.\n\nMeanwhile Sosia strode indignantly homeward.  'Pimp, indeed!' quoth he\nto himself.  'Pimp! a scurvy-tongued fellow that Sallust!  Had I been\ncalled knave, or thief.  I could have forgiven it; but pimp!  Faugh!\nThere is something in the word which the toughest stomach in the world\nwould rise against.  A knave is a knave for his own pleasure, and a\nthief a thief for his own profit; and there is something honorable and\nphilosophical in being a rascal for one's own sake: that is doing things\nupon principle--upon a grand scale.  But a pimp is a thing that defiles\nitself for another--a pipkin that is put on the fire for another man's\npottage! a napkin, that every guest wipes his hands upon! and the\nscullion says, \"by your leave\" too. A pimp!  I would rather he had called\nme parricide!  But the man was drunk, and did not know what he said;\nand, besides, I disguised myself.  Had he seen it had been Sosia who\naddressed him, it would have been \"honest Sosia!\" and, \"worthy man!\" I\nwarrant.  Nevertheless, the trinkets have been won easily--that's some\ncomfort! and, O goddess Feronia!  I shall be a freedman soon! and then I\nshould like to see who'll call me pimp!--unless, indeed, he pay me\npretty handsomely for it!'\n\nWhile Sosia was soliloquising in this high-minded and generous vein, his\npath lay along a narrow lane that led towards the amphitheatre and its\nadjacent palaces.  Suddenly, as he turned a sharp corner he found\nhimself in the midst of a considerable crowd. Men, women, and children,\nall were hurrying or laughing, talking, gesticulating; and, ere he was\naware of it, the worthy Sosia was borne away with the noisy stream.\n\n'What now?' he asked of his nearest neighbor, a young artificer; 'what\nnow? Where are all these good folks thronging?' Does any rich patron\ngive away alms or viands to-night?'\n\n'Not so, man--better still,' replied the artificer; 'the noble\nPansa--the people's friend--has granted the public leave to see the\nbeasts in their vivaria.  By Hercules! they will not be seen so safely\nby some persons to-morrow.'\n\n'Tis a pretty sight,' said the slave, yielding to the throng that\nimpelled him onward; 'and since I may not go to the sports to-morrow, I\nmay as well take a peep at the beasts to-night.'\n\n'You will do well,' returned his new acquaintance, 'a lion and a tiger\nare not to be seen at Pompeii every day.'\n\nThe crowd had now entered a broken and wide space of ground, on which,\nas it was only lighted scantily and from a distance, the press became\ndangerous to those whose limbs and shoulders were not fitted for a mob.\nNevertheless, the women especially--many of them with children in their\narms, or even at the breast--were the most resolute in forcing their\nway; and their shrill exclamations of complaint or objurgation were\nheard loud above the more jovial and masculine voices.  Yet, amidst them\nwas a young and girlish voice, that appeared to come from one too happy\nin her excitement to be alive to the inconvenience of the crowd.\n\n'Aha!' cried the young woman, to some of her companions, 'I always told\nyou so; I always said we should have a man for the lion; and now we have\none for the tiger too!  I wish tomorrow were come!'\n\n       Ho, ho! for the merry, merry show,\n        With a forest of faces in every row!\n        Lo! the swordsmen, bold as the son of Alcmaena,\n        Sweep, side by side, o'er the hushed arena.\n        Talk while you may, you will hold your breath\n        When they meet in the grasp of the glowing death!\n        Tramp! tramp! how gaily they go!\n        Ho! ho! for the merry, merry show!\n\n'A jolly girl!' said Sosia.\n\n'Yes,' replied the young artificer, a curly-headed, handsome youth.\n'Yes,' replied he, enviously; 'the women love a gladiator.  If I had\nbeen a slave, I would have soon found my schoolmaster in the lanista!'\n\n'Would you, indeed?' said Sosia, with a sneer.  'People's notions\ndiffer!'\n\nThe crowd had now arrived at the place of destination; but as the cell\nin which the wild beasts were confined was extremely small and narrow,\ntenfold more vehement than it hitherto had been was the rush of the\naspirants to obtain admittance.  Two of the officers of the\namphitheatre, placed at the entrance, very wisely mitigated the evil by\ndispensing to the foremost only a limited number of tickets at a time,\nand admitting no new visitors till their predecessors had sated their\ncuriosity.  Sosia, who was a tolerably stout fellow and not troubled\nwith any remarkable scruples of diffidence or good breeding, contrived\nto be among the first of the initiated.\n\nSeparated from his companion the artificer, Sosia found himself in a\nnarrow cell of oppressive heat and atmosphere, and lighted by several\nrank and flaring torches.\n\nThe animals, usually kept in different vivaria, or dens, were now, for\nthe greater entertainment of the visitors, placed in one, but equally\nindeed divided from each other by strong cages protected by iron bars.\n\nThere they were, the fell and grim wanderers of the desert, who have now\nbecome almost the principal agents of this story.  The lion, who, as\nbeing the more gentle by nature than his fellow-beast, had been more\nincited to ferocity by hunger, stalked restlessly and fiercely to and\nfro his narrow confines: his eyes were lurid with rage and famine: and\nas, every now and then, he paused and glared around, the spectators\nfearfully pressed backward, and drew their breath more quickly.  But the\ntiger lay quiet and extended at full length in his cage, and only by an\noccasional play of his tail, or a long impatient yawn, testified any\nemotion at his confinement, or at the crowd which honored him with their\npresence.\n\n'I have seen no fiercer beast than yon lion even in the amphitheatre of\nRome,' said a gigantic and sinewy fellow who stood at the right hand of\nSosia.\n\n'I feel humbled when I look at his limbs,' replied, at the left of\nSosia, a slighter and younger figure, with his arms folded on his\nbreast.\n\nThe slave looked first at one, and then at the other.  'Virtus in\nmedio!--virtue is ever in the middle!' muttered he to himself; 'a goodly\nneighborhood for thee, Sosia--a gladiator on each side!'\n\n'That is well said, Lydon,' returned the huger gladiator; 'I feel the\nsame.'\n\n'And to think,' observed Lydon, in a tone of deep feeling, 'to think that\nthe noble Greek, he whom we saw but a day or two since before us, so\nfull of youth, and health, and joyousness, is to feast yon monster!'\n\n'Why not?' growled Niger, savagely: 'many an honest gladiator has been\ncompelled to a like combat by the emperor--why not a wealthy murderer by\nthe law?'\n\nLydon sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and remained silent. Meanwhile the\ncommon gazers listened with staring eyes and lips apart: the gladiators\nwere objects of interest as well as the beasts--they were animals of the\nsame species; so the crowd glanced from one to the other--the men and\nthe brutes--whispering their comments and anticipating the morrow.\n\n'Well!' said Lydon, turning away, 'I thank the gods that it is not the\nlion or the tiger I am to contend with; even you, Niger, are a gentler\ncombatant than they.'\n\n'But equally dangerous,' said the gladiator, with a fierce laugh; and\nthe bystanders, admiring his vast limbs and ferocious countenance,\nlaughed too.\n\n'That as it may be,' answered Lydon, carelessly, as he pressed through\nthe throng and quitted the den.\n\n'I may as well take advantage of his shoulders,' thought the prudent\nSosia, hastening to follow him: 'the crowd always give way to a\ngladiator, so I will keep close behind, and come in for a share of his\nconsequence.'\n\nThe son of Medon strode quickly through the mob, many of whom recognized\nhis features and profession.\n\n'That is young Lydon, a brave fellow: he fights to-morrow,' said one.\n\n'Ah! I have a bet on him,' said another; 'see how firmly he walks!'\n\n'Good luck to thee, Lydon!' said a third.\n\n'Lydon, you have my wishes,' half whispered a fourth, smiling (a comely\nwoman of the middle class)--'and if you win, why, you may hear more of\nme.'\n\n'A handsome man, by Venus!' cried a fifth, who was a girl scarce in her\nteens.  'Thank you,' returned Sosia, gravely taking the compliment to\nhimself.\n\nHowever strong the purer motives of Lydon, and certain though it be that\nhe would never have entered so bloody a calling but from the hope of\nobtaining his father's freedom, he was not altogether unmoved by the\nnotice he excited.  He forgot that the voices now raised in commendation\nmight, on the morrow, shout over his death-pangs.  By nature fierce and\nreckless, as well as generous and warm-hearted, he was already imbued\nwith the pride of a profession that he fancied he disdained, and\naffected by the influence of a companionship that in reality he loathed.\nHe saw himself now a man of importance; his step grew yet lighter, and\nhis mien more elate.\n\n'Niger,' said he, turning suddenly, as he had now threaded the crowd;\n'we have often quarrelled; we are not matched against each other, but\none of us, at least, may reasonably expect to fall--give us thy hand.'\n\n'Most readily,' said Sosia, extending his palm.\n\n'Ha! what fool is this?  Why, I thought Niger was at my heels!'\n\n'I forgive the mistake,' replied Sosia, condescendingly: 'don't mention\nit; the error was easy--I and Niger are somewhat of the same build.'\n\n'Ha! ha! that is excellent!  Niger would have slit thy throat had he\nheard thee!'\n\n'You gentlemen of the arena have a most disagreeable mode of talking,'\nsaid Sosia; 'let us change the conversation.'\n\n'Vah! vah!' said Lydon, impatiently; 'I am in no humor to converse with\nthee!'\n\n'Why, truly,' returned the slave, 'you must have serious thoughts enough\nto occupy your mind: to-morrow is, I think, your first essay in the\narena. Well, I am sure you will die bravely!'\n\n'May thy words fall on thine own head!' said Lydon, superstitiously, for\nhe by no means liked the blessing of Sosia.  'Die! No--I trust my hour\nis not yet come.'\n\n'He who plays at dice with death must expect the dog's throw,' replied\nSosia, maliciously.  'But you are a strong fellow, and I wish you all\nimaginable luck; and so, vale!'\n\nWith that the slave turned on his heel, and took his way homeward.\n\n'I trust the rogue's words are not ominous,' said Lydon, musingly. 'In\nmy zeal for my father's liberty, and my confidence in my own thews and\nsinews, I have not contemplated the possibility of death.  My poor\nfather!  I am thy only son!--if I were to fall...'\n\nAs the thought crossed him, the gladiator strode on with a more rapid\nand restless pace, when suddenly, in an opposite street, he beheld the\nvery object of his thoughts.  Leaning on his stick, his form bent by\ncare and age, his eyes downcast, and his steps trembling, the\ngrey-haired Medon slowly approached towards the gladiator.  Lydon paused\na moment: he divined at once the cause that brought forth the old man at\nthat late hour.\n\n'Be sure, it is I whom he seeks,' thought he; 'he is horror struck at\nthe condemnation of Olinthus--he more than ever esteems the arena\ncriminal and hateful--he comes again to dissuade me from the contest.  I\nmust shun him--I cannot brook his prayers--his tears.'\n\nThese thoughts, so long to recite, flashed across the young man like\nlightning.  He turned abruptly and fled swiftly in an opposite\ndirection. He paused not till, almost spent and breathless, he found\nhimself on the summit of a small acclivity which overlooked the most gay\nand splendid part of that miniature city; and as there he paused, and\ngazed along the tranquil streets glittering in the rays of the moon\n(which had just arisen, and brought partially and picturesquely into\nlight the crowd around the amphitheatre at a distance, murmuring, and\nswaying to and fro), the influence of the scene affected him, rude and\nunimaginative though his nature.  He sat himself down to rest upon the\nsteps of a deserted portico, and felt the calm of the hour quiet and\nrestore him.  Opposite and near at hand, the lights gleamed from a\npalace in which the master now held his revels.  The doors were open for\ncoolness, and the gladiator beheld the numerous and festive group\ngathered round the tables in the atrium; while behind them, closing the\nlong vista of the illumined rooms beyond, the spray of the distant\nfountain sparkled in the moonbeams. There, the garlands wreathed around\nthe columns of the hall--there, gleamed still and frequent the marble\nstatue--there, amidst peals of jocund laughter, rose the music and the\nlay.\n\n              EPICUREAN SONG\n\n       Away with your stories of Hades,\n          Which the Flamen has forged to affright us--\n       We laugh at your three Maiden Ladies,\n          Your Fates--and your sullen Cocytus.\n\n       Poor Jove has a troublesome life, sir,\n          Could we credit your tales of his portals--\n       In shutting his ears on his wife, sir,\n          And opening his eyes upon mortals.\n\n       Oh, blest be the bright Epicurus!\n          Who taught us to laugh at such fables;\n        On Hades they wanted to moor us,\n          And his hand cut the terrible cables.\n\n       If, then, there's a Jove or a Juno,\n          They vex not their heads about us, man;\n        Besides, if they did, I and you know\n          'Tis the life of a god to live thus, man!\n\n       What! think you the gods place their bliss--eh?--\n         In playing the spy on a sinner?\n        In counting the girls that we kiss, eh?\n          Or the cups that we empty at dinner?\n\n       Content with the soft lips that love us,\n          This music, this wine, and this mirth, boys,\n        We care not for gods up above us--\n         We know there's no god for this earth, boys!\n\nWhile Lydon's piety (which accommodating as it might be, was in no\nslight degree disturbed by these verses, which embodied the fashionable\nphilosophy of the day) slowly recovered itself from the shock it had\nreceived, a small party of men, in plain garments and of the middle\nclass, passed by his resting-place.  They were in earnest conversation,\nand did not seem to notice or heed the gladiator as they moved on.\n\n'O horror on horrors!' said one; 'Olinthus is snatched from us! our\nright arm is lopped away!  When will Christ descend to protect his own?'\n\n'Can human atrocity go farther,' said another: 'to sentence an innocent\nman to the same arena as a murderer!  But let us not despair; the\nthunder of Sinai may yet be heard, and the Lord preserve his saint.\n\"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\"'\n\nAt that moment out broke again, from the illumined palace, the burden of\nthe reveller's song:--\n\n    We care not for gods up above us--\n       We know there's no god for this earth, boys!\n\nEre the words died away, the Nazarenes, moved by sudden indignation,\ncaught up the echo, and, in the words of one of their favorite hymns,\nshouted aloud:--\n\n        THE WARNING HYMN OF THE NAZARENES\n\n       Around--about--for ever near thee,\n        God--OUR GOD--shall mark and hear thee!\n        On his car of storm He sweeps!\n        Bow, ye heavens, and shrink, ye deeps!\n        Woe to the proud ones who defy Him!--\n       Woe to the dreamers who deny Him!\n            Woe to the wicked, woe!\n          The proud stars shall fail--\n         The sun shall grow pale--\n       The heavens shrivel up like a scroll--\n         Hell's ocean shall bare\n          Its depths of despair,\n        Each wave an eternal soul!\n          For the only thing, then,\n          That shall not live again\n            Is the corpse of the giant TIME.\n\n           Hark, the trumpet of thunder!\n           Lo, earth rent asunder!\n         And, forth, on His Angel-throne,\n           He comes through the gloom,\n           The Judge of the Tomb,\n         To summon and save His own!\n              Oh, joy to Care, and woe to Crime,\n              He comes to save His own!\n        Woe to the proud ones who defy Him!\n        Woe to the dreamers who deny Him!\n              Woe to the wicked, woe!\n\nA sudden silence from the startled hall of revel succeeded these ominous\nwords: the Christians swept on, and were soon hidden from the sight of\nthe gladiator.  Awed, he scarce knew why, by the mystic denunciations of\nthe Christians, Lydon, after a short pause, now rose to pursue his way\nhomeward.\n\nBefore him, how serenely slept the starlight on that lovely city! how\nbreathlessly its pillared streets reposed in their security!--how softly\nrippled the dark-green waves beyond!--how cloudless spread, aloft and\nblue, the dreaming Campanian skies!  Yet this was the last night for the\ngay Pompeii! the colony of the hoar Chaldean! the fabled city of\nHercules! the delight of the voluptuous Roman!  Age after age had\nrolled, indestructive, unheeded, over its head; and now the last ray\nquivered on the dial-plate of its doom!  The gladiator heard some light\nsteps behind--a group of females were wending homeward from their visit\nto the amphitheatre.  As he turned, his eye was arrested by a strange\nand sudden apparition.  From the summit of Vesuvius, darkly visible at\nthe distance, there shot a pale, meteoric, livid light--it trembled an\ninstant and was gone.  And at the same moment that his eye caught it,\nthe voice of one of the youngest of the women broke out hilariously and\nshrill:--\n\n       TRAMP! TRAMP! HOW GAILY THEY GO!\n        HO, HO! FOR THE MORROW'S MERRY SHOW!\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE FIFTH\n\nChapter I\n\nTHE DREAM OF ARBACES.  A VISITOR AND A WARNING TO THE EGYPTIAN.\n\n\nTHE awful night preceding the fierce joy of the amphitheatre rolled\ndrearily away, and greyly broke forth the dawn of THE LAST DAY OF\nPOMPEII!  The air was uncommonly calm and sultry--a thin and dull mist\ngathered over the valleys and hollows of the broad Campanian fields.\nBut yet it was remarked in surprise by the early fishermen, that,\ndespite the exceeding stillness of the atmosphere, the waves of the sea\nwere agitated, and seemed, as it were, to run disturbedly back from the\nshore; while along the blue and stately Sarnus, whose ancient breadth of\nchannel the traveler now vainly seeks to discover, there crept a hoarse\nand sullen murmur, as it glided by the laughing plains and the gaudy\nvillas of the wealthy citizens.  Clear above the low mist rose the\ntime-worn towers of the immemorial town, the red-tiled roofs of the\nbright streets, the solemn columns of many temples, and the\nstatue-crowned portals of the Forum and the Arch of Triumph.  Far in the\ndistance, the outline of the circling hills soared above the vapors, and\nmingled with the changeful hues of the morning sky.  The cloud that had\nso long rested over the crest of Vesuvius had suddenly vanished, and its\nrugged and haughty brow looked without a frown over the beautiful scenes\nbelow.\n\nDespite the earliness of the hour, the gates of the city were already\nopened.  Horsemen upon horsemen, vehicle after vehicle, poured rapidly\nin; and the voices of numerous pedestrian groups, clad in holiday\nattire, rose high in joyous and excited merriment; the streets were\ncrowded with citizens and strangers from the populous neighborhood of\nPompeii; and noisily--fast--confusedly swept the many streams of life\ntowards the fatal show.\n\nDespite the vast size of the amphitheatre, seemingly so disproportioned\nto the extent of the city, and formed to include nearly the whole\npopulation of Pompeii itself, so great, on extraordinary occasions, was\nthe concourse of strangers from all parts of Campania, that the space\nbefore it was usually crowded for several hours previous to the\ncommencement of the sports, by such persons as were not entitled by\ntheir rank to appointed and special seats.  And the intense curiosity\nwhich the trial and sentence of two criminals so remarkable had\noccasioned, increased the crowd on this day to an extent wholly\nunprecedented.\n\nWhile the common people, with the lively vehemence of their Campanian\nblood, were thus pushing, scrambling, hurrying on--yet, amidst all their\neagerness, preserving, as is now the wont with Italians in such\nmeetings, a wonderful order and unquarrelsome good humor, a strange\nvisitor to Arbaces was threading her way to his sequestered mansion.  At\nthe sight of her quaint and primaeval garb--of her wild gait and\ngestures--the passengers she encountered touched each other and smiled;\nbut as they caught a glimpse of her countenance, the mirth was hushed at\nonce, for the face was as the face of the dead; and, what with the\nghastly features and obsolete robes of the stranger, it seemed as if one\nlong entombed had risen once more amongst the living.  In silence and\nawe each group gave way as she passed along, and she soon gained the\nbroad porch of the Egyptian's palace.\n\nThe black porter, like the rest of the world, astir at an unusual hour,\nstarted as he opened the door to her summons.\n\nThe sleep of the Egyptian had been usually profound during the night;\nbut, as the dawn approached, it was disturbed by strange and unquiet\ndreams, which impressed him the more as they were colored by the\npeculiar philosophy he embraced.\n\nHe thought that he was transported to the bowels of the earth, and that\nhe stood alone in a mighty cavern supported by enormous columns of rough\nand primaeval rock, lost, as they ascended, in the vastness of a shadow\nathwart whose eternal darkness no beam of day had ever glanced.  And in\nthe space between these columns were huge wheels, that whirled round and\nround unceasingly, and with a rushing and roaring noise.  Only to the\nright and left extremities of the cavern, the space between the pillars\nwas left bare, and the apertures stretched away into galleries--not\nwholly dark, but dimly lighted by wandering and erratic fires, that,\nmeteor-like, now crept (as the snake creeps) along the rugged and dank\nsoil; and now leaped fiercely to and fro, darting across the vast gloom\nin wild gambols--suddenly disappearing, and as suddenly bursting into\ntenfold brilliancy and power.  And while he gazed wonderingly upon the\ngallery to the left, thin, mist-like, aerial shapes passed slowly up;\nand when they had gained the hall they seemed to rise aloft, and to\nvanish, as the smoke vanishes, in the measureless ascent.\n\nHe turned in fear towards the opposite extremity--and behold! there came\nswiftly, from the gloom above, similar shadows, which swept hurriedly\nalong the gallery to the right, as if borne involuntarily adown the\nsides of some invisible stream; and the faces of these spectres were\nmore distinct than those that emerged from the opposite passage; and on\nsome was joy, and on others sorrow--some were vivid with expectation and\nhope, some unutterably dejected by awe and horror.  And so they passed,\nswift and constantly on, till the eyes of the gazer grew dizzy and\nblinded with the whirl of an ever-varying succession of things impelled\nby a power apparently not their own.\n\nArbaces turned away, and, in the recess of the hall, he saw the mighty\nform of a giantess seated upon a pile of skulls, and her hands were busy\nupon a pale and shadowy woof; and he saw that the woof communicated with\nthe numberless wheels, as if it guided the machinery of their movements.\nHe thought his feet, by some secret agency, were impelled towards the\nfemale, and that he was borne onwards till he stood before her, face to\nface.  The countenance of the giantess was solemn and hushed, and\nbeautifully serene. It was as the face of some colossal sculpture of his\nown ancestral sphinx. No passion--no human emotion, disturbed its\nbrooding and unwrinkled brow: there was neither sadness, nor joy, nor\nmemory, nor hope: it was free from all with which the wild human heart\ncan sympathize.  The mystery of mysteries rested on its beauty--it awed,\nbut terrified not: it was the Incarnation of the sublime.  And Arbaces\nfelt the voice leave his lips, without an impulse of his own; and the\nvoice asked:\n\n'Who art thou, and what is thy task?'\n\n'I am That which thou hast acknowledged,' answered, without desisting\nfrom its work, the mighty phantom.  'My name is NATURE!  These are the\nwheels of the world, and my hand guides them for the life of all\nthings.'\n\n'And what,' said the voice of Arbaces, 'are these galleries, that\nstrangely and fitfully illumined, stretch on either hand into the abyss\nof gloom?'\n\n'That,' answered the giant-mother, 'which thou beholdest to the left, is\nthe gallery of the Unborn.  The shadows that flit onward and upward into\nthe world, are the souls that pass from the long eternity of being to\ntheir destined pilgrimage on earth.  That which thou beholdest to thy\nright, wherein the shadows descending from above sweep on, equally\nunknown and dim, is the gallery of the Dead!'\n\n'And wherefore, said the voice of Arbaces, 'yon wandering lights, that\nso wildly break the darkness; but only break, not reveal?'\n\n'Dark fool of the human sciences! dreamer of the stars, and would-be\ndecipherer of the heart and origin of things! those lights are but the\nglimmerings of such knowledge as is vouchsafed to Nature to work her\nway, to trace enough of the past and future to give providence to her\ndesigns. Judge, then, puppet as thou art, what lights are reserved for\nthee!'\n\nArbaces felt himself tremble as he asked again, 'Wherefore am I here?'\n\n'It is the forecast of thy soul--the prescience of thy rushing doom--the\nshadow of thy fate lengthening into eternity as declines from earth.'\n\nEre he could answer, Arbaces felt a rushing WIND sweep down the cavern,\nas the winds of a giant god.  Borne aloft from the ground, and whirled\non high as a leaf in the storms of autumn, he beheld himself in the\nmidst of the Spectres of the Dead, and hurrying with them along the\nlength of gloom.  As in vain and impotent despair he struggled against\nthe impelling power, he thought the WIND grew into something like a\nshape--a spectral outline of the wings and talons of an eagle, with\nlimbs floating far and indistinctly along the air, and eyes that, alone\nclearly and vividly seen, glared stonily and remorselessly on his own.\n\n'What art thou?' again said the voice of the Egyptian.\n\n'I am That which thou hast acknowledged'; and the spectre laughed\naloud--'and my name is NECESSITY.'\n\n'To what dost thou bear me?'\n\n'To the Unknown.'\n\n'To happiness or to woe?'\n\n'As thou hast sown, so shalt thou reap.'\n\n'Dread thing, not so!  If thou art the Ruler of Life, thine are my\nmisdeeds, not mine.'\n\n'I am but the breath of God!' answered the mighty WIND.\n\n'Then is my wisdom vain!' groaned the dreamer.\n\n'The husbandman accuses not fate, when, having sown thistles, he reaps\nnot corn.  Thou hast sown crime, accuse not fate if thou reapest not the\nharvest of virtue.'\n\nThe scene suddenly changed.  Arbaces was in a place of human bones; and\nlo! in the midst of them was a skull, and the skull, still retaining its\nfleshless hollows, assumed slowly, and in the mysterious confusion of a\ndream, the face of Apaecides; and forth from the grinning jaws there\ncrept a small worm, and it crawled to the feet of Arbaces.  He attempted\nto stamp on it and crush it; but it became longer and larger with that\nattempt.  It swelled and bloated till it grew into a vast serpent: it\ncoiled itself round the limbs of Arbaces; it crunched his bones; it\nraised its glaring eyes and poisonous jaws to his face.  He writhed in\nvain; he withered--he gasped--beneath the influence of the blighting\nbreath--he felt himself blasted into death. And then a voice came from\nthe reptile, which still bore the face of Apaecides and rang in his\nreeling ear:\n\n'THY VICTIM IS THY JUDGE!  THE WORM THOU WOULDST CRUSH BECOMES THE\nSERPENT THAT DEVOURS THEE!'\n\nWith a shriek of wrath, and woe, and despairing resistance, Arbaces\nawoke--his hair on end--his brow bathed in dew--his eyes glazed and\nstaring--his mighty frame quivering as an infant's, beneath the agony of\nthat dream.  He awoke--he collected himself--he blessed the gods whom he\ndisbelieved, that he was in a dream--he turned his eyes from side to\nside--he saw the dawning light break through his small but lofty\nwindow--he was in the Precincts of Day--he rejoiced--he smiled; his eyes\nfell, and opposite to him he beheld the ghastly features, the lifeless\neye, the livid lip--of the hag of Vesuvius!\n\n'Ha!' he cried, placing his hands before his eyes, as to shut out the\ngrisly vision, 'do I dream still?--Am I with the dead?'\n\n'Mighty Hermes--no!  Thou art with one death-like, but not dead.\nRecognize thy friend and slave.'\n\nThere was a long silence.  Slowly the shudders that passed over the\nlimbs of the Egyptian chased each other away, faintlier and faintlier\ndying till he was himself again.\n\n'It was a dream, then,' said he.  'Well--let me dream no more, or the\nday cannot compensate for the pangs of night.  Woman, how camest thou\nhere, and wherefore?'\n\n'I came to warn thee,' answered the sepulchral voice of the saga.\n\n'Warn me!  The dream lied not, then?  Of what peril?'\n\n'Listen to me.  Some evil hangs over this fated city.  Fly while it be\ntime. Thou knowest that I hold my home on that mountain beneath which\nold tradition saith there yet burn the fires of the river of Phlegethon;\nand in my cavern is a vast abyss, and in that abyss I have of late\nmarked a red and dull stream creep slowly, slowly on; and heard many and\nmighty sounds hissing and roaring through the gloom.  But last night, as\nI looked thereon, behold the stream was no longer dull, but intensely\nand fiercely luminous; and while I gazed, the beast that liveth with me,\nand was cowering by my side, uttered a shrill howl, and fell down and\ndied, and the slaver and froth were round his lips.  I crept back to my\nlair; but I distinctly heard, all the night, the rock shake and tremble;\nand, though the air was heavy and still, there were the hissing of pent\nwinds, and the grinding as of wheels, beneath the ground.  So, when I\nrose this morning at the very birth of dawn, I looked again down the\nabyss, and I saw vast fragments of stone borne black and floatingly over\nthe lurid stream; and the stream itself was broader, fiercer, redder\nthan the night before.  Then I went forth, and ascended to the summit of\nthe rock: and in that summit there appeared a sudden and vast hollow,\nwhich I had never perceived before, from which curled a dim, faint\nsmoke; and the vapor was deathly, and I gasped, and sickened, and nearly\ndied.  I returned home.  I took my gold and my drugs, and left the\nhabitation of many years; for I remembered the dark Etruscan prophecy\nwhich saith, \"When the mountain opens, the city shall fall--when the\nsmoke crowns the Hill of the Parched Fields, there shall be woe and\nweeping in the hearths of the Children of the Sea.\" Dread master, ere I\nleave these walls for some more distant dwelling, I come to thee.  As\nthou livest, know I in my heart that the earthquake that sixteen years\nago shook this city to its solid base, was but the forerunner of more\ndeadly doom.  The walls of Pompeii are built above the fields of the\nDead, and the rivers of the sleepless Hell.  Be warned and fly!'\n\n'Witch, I thank thee for thy care of one not ungrateful.  On yon table\nstands a cup of gold; take it, it is thine.  I dreamt not that there\nlived one, out of the priesthood of Isis, who would have saved Arbaces\nfrom destruction.  The signs thou hast seen in the bed of the extinct\nvolcano,' continued the Egyptian, musingly, 'surely tell of some coming\ndanger to the city; perhaps another earthquake--fiercer than the last.\nBe that as it may, there is a new reason for my hastening from these\nwalls.  After this day I will prepare my departure.  Daughter of\nEtruria, whither wendest thou?'\n\n'I shall cross over to Herculaneum this day, and, wandering thence along\nthe coast, shall seek out a new home.  I am friendless: my two\ncompanions, the fox and the snake, are dead.  Great Hermes, thou hast\npromised me twenty additional years of life!'\n\n'Aye,' said the Egyptian, 'I have promised thee.  But, woman,' he added,\nlifting himself upon his arm, and gazing curiously on her face, 'tell\nme, I pray thee, wherefore thou wishest to live?  What sweets dost thou\ndiscover in existence?'\n\n'It is not life that is sweet, but death that is awful,' replied the\nhag, in a sharp, impressive tone, that struck forcibly upon the heart of\nthe vain star-seer.  He winced at the truth of the reply; and no longer\nanxious to retain so uninviting a companion, he said, 'Time wanes; I\nmust prepare for the solemn spectacle of this day. Sister, farewell!\nenjoy thyself as thou canst over the ashes of life.'\n\nThe hag, who had placed the costly gift of Arbaces in the loose folds of\nher vest, now rose to depart.  When she had gained the door she paused,\nturned back, and said, 'This may be the last time we meet on earth; but\nwhither flieth the flame when it leaves the ashes?--Wandering to and\nfro, up and down, as an exhalation on the morass, the flame may be seen\nin the marshes of the lake below; and the witch and the Magian, the\npupil and the master, the great one and the accursed one, may meet\nagain.  Farewell!'\n\n'Out, croaker!' muttered Arbaces, as the door closed on the hag's\ntattered robes; and, impatient of his own thoughts, not yet recovered\nfrom the past dream, he hastily summoned his slaves.\n\nIt was the custom to attend the ceremonials of the amphitheatre in\nfestive robes, and Arbaces arrayed himself that day with more than usual\ncare.  His tunic was of the most dazzling white: his many fibulae were\nformed from the most precious stones: over his tunic flowed a loose\neastern robe, half-gown, half-mantle, glowing in the richest hues of the\nTyrian dye; and the sandals, that reached half way up the knee, were\nstudded with gems, and inlaid with gold.  In the quackeries that\nbelonged to his priestly genius, Arbaces never neglected, on great\noccasions, the arts which dazzle and impose upon the vulgar; and on this\nday, that was for ever to release him, by the sacrifice of Glaucus, from\nthe fear of a rival and the chance of detection, he felt that he was\narraying himself as for a triumph or a nuptial feast.\n\nIt was customary for men of rank to be accompanied to the shows of the\namphitheatre by a procession of their slaves and freedmen; and the long\n'family' of Arbaces were already arranged in order, to attend the litter\nof their lord.\n\nOnly, to their great chagrin, the slaves in attendance on Ione, and the\nworthy Sosia, as gaoler to Nydia, were condemned to remain at home.\n\n'Callias,' said Arbaces, apart to his freedman, who was buckling on his\ngirdle, 'I am weary of Pompeii; I propose to quit it in three days,\nshould the wind favor.  Thou knowest the vessel that lies in the harbor\nwhich belonged to Narses, of Alexandria; I have purchased it of him.\nThe day after tomorrow we shall begin to remove my stores.'\n\n'So soon!  'Tis well.  Arbaces shall be obeyed--and his ward, Ione?'\n\n'Accompanies me.  Enough!--Is the morning fair?'\n\n'Dim and oppressive; it will probably be intensely hot in the forenoon.'\n\n'The poor gladiators, and more wretched criminals!  Descend, and see\nthat the slaves are marshalled.'\n\nLeft alone, Arbaces stepped into his chamber of study, and thence upon\nthe portico without.  He saw the dense masses of men pouring fast into\nthe amphitheatre, and heard the cry of the assistants, and the cracking\nof the cordage, as they were straining aloft the huge awning under which\nthe citizens, molested by no discomforting ray, were to behold, at\nluxurious ease, the agonies of their fellow creatures.  Suddenly a wild\nstrange sound went forth, and as suddenly died away--it was the roar of\nthe lion.  There was a silence in the distant crowd; but the silence was\nfollowed by joyous laughter--they were making merry at the hungry\nimpatience of the royal beast.\n\n'Brutes!' muttered the disdainful, 'Arbaces are ye less homicides than I\nam? I slay but in self-defence--ye make murder pastime.'\n\nHe turned with a restless and curious eye, towards Vesuvius. Beautifully\nglowed the green vineyards round its breast, and tranquil as eternity\nlay in the breathless skies the form of the mighty hill.\n\n'We have time yet, if the earthquake be nursing,' thought Arbaces; and\nhe turned from the spot.  He passed by the table which bore his mystic\nscrolls and Chaldean calculations.\n\n'August art!' he thought, 'I have not consulted thy decrees since I\npassed the danger and the crisis they foretold.  What matter?--I know\nthat henceforth all in my path is bright and smooth. Have not events\nalready proved it?  Away, doubt--away, pity!  Reflect O my heart--\nreflect, for the future, but two images--Empire and Ione!'\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nTHE AMPHITHEATRE.\n\nNYDIA, assured by the account of Sosia, on his return home, and\nsatisfied that her letter was in the hands of Sallust, gave herself up\nonce more to hope.  Sallust would surely lose no time in seeking the\npraetor--in coming to the house of the Egyptian--in releasing her--in\nbreaking the prison of Calenus.  That very night Glaucus would be free.\nAlas! the night passed--the dawn broke; she heard nothing but the\nhurried footsteps of the slaves along the hall and peristyle, and their\nvoices in preparation for the show.  By-and-by, the commanding voice of\nArbaces broke on her ear--a flourish of music rung out cheerily: the\nlong procession were sweeping to the amphitheatre to glut their eyes on\nthe death-pangs of the Athenian!\n\nThe procession of Arbaces moved along slowly, and with much solemnity\ntill now, arriving at the place where it was necessary for such as came\nin litters or chariots to alight, Arbaces descended from his vehicle,\nand proceeded to the entrance by which the more distinguished spectators\nwere admitted.  His slaves, mingling with the humbler crowd, were\nstationed by officers who received their tickets (not much unlike our\nmodern Opera ones), in places in the popularia (the seats apportioned to\nthe vulgar).  And now, from the spot where Arbaces sat, his eyes scanned\nthe mighty and impatient crowd that filled the stupendous theatre.\n\nOn the upper tier (but apart from the male spectators) sat women, their\ngay dresses resembling some gaudy flower-bed; it is needless to add that\nthey were the most talkative part of the assembly; and many were the\nlooks directed up to them, especially from the benches appropriated to\nthe young and the unmarried men.  On the lower seats round the arena sat\nthe more high-born and wealthy visitors--the magistrates and those of\nsenatorial or equestrian dignity; the passages which, by corridors at\nthe right and left, gave access to these seats, at either end of the\noval arena, were also the entrances for the combatants.  Strong palings\nat these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the movements\nof the beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey.  Around the\nparapet which was raised above the arena, and from which the seats\ngradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and paintings wrought in\nfresco, typical of the entertainments for which the place was designed.\nThroughout the whole building wound invisible pipes, from which, as the\nday advanced, cooling and fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over the\nspectators.  The officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in the\ntask of fixing the vast awning (or velaria) which covered the whole, and\nwhich luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to themselves: it was\nwoven of the whitest Apulian wool, and variegated with broad stripes of\ncrimson.  Owing either to some inexperience on the part of the workmen,\nor to some defect in the machinery, the awning, however, was not\narranged that day so happily as usual; indeed, from the immense space of\nthe circumference, the task was always one of great difficulty and\nart--so much so, that it could seldom be adventured in rough or windy\nweather.  But the present day was so remarkably still that there seemed\nto the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the artificers; and\nwhen a large gap in the back of the awning was still visible, from the\nobstinate refusal of one part of the velaria to ally itself with the\nrest, the murmurs of discontent were loud and general.\n\nThe aedile Pansa, at whose expense the exhibition was given, looked\nparticularly annoyed at the defect, and, vowed bitter vengeance on the\nhead of the chief officer of the show, who, fretting, puffing,\nperspiring, busied himself in idle orders and unavailing threats.\n\nThe hubbub ceased suddenly--the operators desisted--the crowd were\nstilled--the gap was forgotten--for now, with a loud and warlike\nflourish of trumpets, the gladiators, marshalled in ceremonious\nprocession, entered the arena.  They swept round the oval space very\nslowly and deliberately, in order to give the spectators full leisure to\nadmire their stern serenity of feature--their brawny limbs and various\narms, as well as to form such wagers as the excitement of the moment\nmight suggest.\n\n'Oh!' cried the widow Fulvia to the wife of Pansa, as they leaned down\nfrom their lofty bench, 'do you see that gigantic gladiator? how drolly\nhe is dressed!'\n\n'Yes,' said the aedile's wife, with complacent importance, for she knew\nall the names and qualities of each combatant; 'he is a retiarius or\nnetter; he is armed only, you see, with a three-pronged spear like a\ntrident, and a net; he wears no armor, only the fillet and the tunic.\nHe is a mighty man, and is to fight with Sporus, yon thick-set\ngladiator, with the round shield and drawn sword, but without body\narmor; he has not his helmet on now, in order that you may see his\nface--how fearless it is!--by-and-by he will fight with his vizor down.'\n\n'But surely a net and a spear are poor arms against a shield and sword?'\n\n'That shows how innocent you are, my dear Fulvia; the retiarius has\ngenerally the best of it.'\n\n'But who is yon handsome gladiator, nearly naked--is it not quite\nimproper? By Venus! but his limbs are beautifully shaped!'\n\n'It is Lydon, a young untried man! he has the rashness to fight yon\nother gladiator similarly dressed, or rather undressed--Tetraides. They\nfight first in the Greek fashion, with the cestus; afterwards they put\non armor, and try sword and shield.'\n\n'He is a proper man, this Lydon; and the women, I am sure, are on his\nside.'\n\n'So are not the experienced betters; Clodius offers three to one against\nhim!'\n\n'Oh, Jove! how beautiful!' exclaimed the widow, as two gladiators, armed\ncap-a-pie, rode round the arena on light and prancing steeds. Resembling\nmuch the combatants in the tilts of the middle age, they bore lances and\nround shields beautifully inlaid: their armor was woven intricately with\nbands of iron, but it covered only the thighs and the right arms; short\ncloaks, extending to the seat, gave a picturesque and graceful air to\ntheir costume; their legs were naked, with the exception of sandals,\nwhich were fastened a little above the ankle.  'Oh, beautiful!  Who are\nthese?' asked the widow.\n\n'The one is named Berbix--he has conquered twelve times; the other\nassumes the arrogant name of Nobilior.  They are both Gauls.'\n\nWhile thus conversing, the first formalities of the show were over.  To\nthese succeeded a feigned combat with wooden swords between the various\ngladiators matched against each other.  Amongst these, the skill of two\nRoman gladiators, hired for the occasion, was the most admired; and next\nto them the most graceful combatant was Lydon.  This sham contest did\nnot last above an hour, nor did it attract any very lively interest,\nexcept among those connoisseurs of the arena to whom art was preferable\nto more coarse excitement; the body of the spectators were rejoiced when\nit was over, and when the sympathy rose to terror.  The combatants were\nnow arranged in pairs, as agreed beforehand; their weapons examined; and\nthe grave sports of the day commenced amidst the deepest silence--broken\nonly by an exciting and preliminary blast of warlike music.\n\nIt was often customary to begin the sports by the most cruel of all, and\nsome bestiarius, or gladiator appointed to the beasts, was slain first,\nas an initiatory sacrifice.  But in the present instance, the\nexperienced Pansa thought it better that the sanguinary drama should\nadvance, not decrease, in interest and, accordingly, the execution of\nOlinthus and Glaucus was reserved for the last.  It was arranged that\nthe two horsemen should first occupy the arena; that the foot\ngladiators, paired off, should then be loosed indiscriminately on the\nstage; that Glaucus and the lion should next perform their part in the\nbloody spectacle; and the tiger and the Nazarene be the grand finale.\nAnd, in the spectacles of Pompeii, the reader of Roman history must\nlimit his imagination, nor expect to find those vast and wholesale\nexhibitions of magnificent slaughter with which a Nero or a Caligula\nregaled the inhabitants of the Imperial City.  The Roman shows, which\nabsorbed the more celebrated gladiators, and the chief proportion of\nforeign beasts, were indeed the very reason why, in the lesser towns of\nthe empire, the sports of the amphitheatre were comparatively humane and\nrare; and in this, as in other respects, Pompeii was but the miniature,\nthe microcosm of Rome.  Still, it was an awful and imposing spectacle,\nwith which modern times have, happily, nothing to compare--a vast\ntheatre, rising row upon row, and swarming with human beings, from\nfifteen to eighteen thousand in number, intent upon no fictitious\nrepresentation--no tragedy of the stage--but the actual victory or\ndefeat, the exultant life or the bloody death, of each and all who\nentered the arena!\n\nThe two horsemen were now at either extremity of the lists (if so they\nmight be called); and, at a given signal from Pansa, the combatants\nstarted simultaneously as in full collision, each advancing his round\nbuckler, each poising on high his light yet sturdy javelin; but just\nwhen within three paces of his opponent, the steed of Berbix suddenly\nhalted, wheeled round, and, as Nobilior was borne rapidly by, his\nantagonist spurred upon him.  The buckler of Nobilior, quickly and\nskillfully extended, received a blow which otherwise would have been\nfatal.\n\n'Well done, Nobilior!' cried the praetor, giving the first vent to the\npopular excitement.\n\n'Bravely struck, my Berbix!' answered Clodius from his seat.\n\nAnd the wild murmur, swelled by many a shout, echoed from side to side.\n\nThe vizors of both the horsemen were completely closed (like those of\nthe knights in after times), but the head was, nevertheless, the great\npoint of assault; and Nobilior, now wheeling his charger with no less\nadroitness than his opponent, directed his spear full on the helmet of\nhis foe.  Berbix raised his buckler to shield himself, and his\nquick-eyed antagonist, suddenly lowering his weapon, pierced him through\nthe breast.  Berbix reeled and fell.\n\n'Nobilior! Nobilior!' shouted the populace.\n\n'I have lost ten sestertia,' said Clodius, between his teeth.\n\n'Habet!--he has it,' said Pansa, deliberately.\n\nThe populace, not yet hardened into cruelty, made the signal of mercy;\nbut as the attendants of the arena approached, they found the kindness\ncame too late--the heart of the Gaul had been pierced, and his eyes were\nset in death.  It was his life's blood that flowed so darkly over the\nsand and sawdust of the arena.\n\n'It is a pity it was so soon over--there was little enough for one's\ntrouble,' said the widow Fulvia.\n\n'Yes--I have no compassion for Berbix.  Any one might have seen that\nNobilior did but feint.  Mark, they fix the fatal hook to the body--they\ndrag him away to the spoliarium--they scatter new sand over the stage!\nPansa regrets nothing more than that he is not rich enough to strew the\narena with borax and cinnabar, as Nero used to do.'\n\n'Well, if it has been a brief battle, it is quickly succeeded.  See my\nhandsome Lydon on the arena--ay--and the net-bearer too, and the\nswordsmen! oh, charming!'\n\nThere were now on the arena six combatants: Niger and his net, matched\nagainst Sporus with his shield and his short broadsword; Lydon and\nTetraides, naked save by a cincture round the waist, each armed only\nwith a heavy Greek cestus--and two gladiators from Rome, clad in\ncomplete steel, and evenly matched with immense bucklers and pointed\nswords.\n\nThe initiatory contest between Lydon and Tetraides being less deadly\nthan that between the other combatants, no sooner had they advanced to\nthe middle of the arena than, as by common consent, the rest held back,\nto see how that contest should be decided, and wait till fiercer weapons\nmight replace the cestus, ere they themselves commenced hostilities.\nThey stood leaning on their arms and apart from each other, gazing on\nthe show, which, if not bloody enough, thoroughly to please the\npopulace, they were still inclined to admire, because its origin was of\ntheir ancestral Greece.\n\nNo person could, at first glance, have seemed less evenly matched than\nthe two antagonists.  Tetraides, though not taller than Lydon, weighed\nconsiderably more; the natural size of his muscles was increased, to the\neyes of the vulgar, by masses of solid flesh; for, as it was a notion\nthat the contest of the cestus fared easiest with him who was plumpest,\nTetraides had encouraged to the utmost his hereditary predisposition to\nthe portly. His shoulders were vast, and his lower limbs thick-set,\ndouble-jointed, and slightly curved outward, in that formation which\ntakes so much from beauty to give so largely to strength.  But Lydon,\nexcept that he was slender even almost to meagreness, was beautifully\nand delicately proportioned; and the skilful might have perceived that,\nwith much less compass of muscle than his foe, that which he had was\nmore seasoned--iron and compact.  In proportion, too, as he wanted\nflesh, he was likely to possess activity; and a haughty smile on his\nresolute face which strongly contrasted the solid heaviness of his\nenemy's, gave assurance to those who beheld it, and united their hope to\ntheir pity: so that, despite the disparity of their seeming strength,\nthe cry of the multitude was nearly as loud for Lydon as for Tetraides.\n\nWhoever is acquainted with the modern prize-ring--whoever has witnessed\nthe heavy and disabling strokes which the human fist, skillfully\ndirected, hath the power to bestow--may easily understand how much that\nhappy facility would be increased by a band carried by thongs of leather\nround the arm as high as the elbow, and terribly strengthened about the\nknuckles by a plate of iron, and sometimes a plummet of lead.  Yet this,\nwhich was meant to increase, perhaps rather diminished, the interest of\nthe fray: for it necessarily shortened its duration.  A very few blows,\nsuccessfully and scientifically planted, might suffice to bring the\ncontest to a close; and the battle did not, therefore, often allow full\nscope for the energy, fortitude and dogged perseverance, that we\ntechnically style pluck, which not unusually wins the day against\nsuperior science, and which heightens to so painful a delight the\ninterest in the battle and the sympathy for the brave.\n\n'Guard thyself!' growled Tetraides, moving nearer and nearer to his foe,\nwho rather shifted round him than receded.\n\nLydon did not answer, save by a scornful glance of his quick, vigilant\neye. Tetraides struck--it was as the blow of a smith on a vice; Lydon\nsank suddenly on one knee--the blow passed over his head.  Not so\nharmless was Lydon's retaliation: he quickly sprung to his feet, and\naimed his cestus full on the broad breast of his antagonist.  Tetraides\nreeled--the populace shouted.\n\n'You are unlucky to-day,' said Lepidus to Clodius: 'you have lost one\nbet----you will lose another.'\n\n'By the gods! my bronzes go to the auctioneer if that is the case. I\nhave no less than a hundred sestertia upon Tetraides.  Ha, ha! see how\nhe rallies! That was a home stroke: he has cut open Lydon's shoulder.  A\nTetraides!--a Tetraides!'\n\n'But Lydon is not disheartened.  By Pollux! how well he keeps his\ntemper. See how dexterously he avoids those hammer-like hands!--dodging\nnow here, now there--circling round and round.  Ah, poor Lydon! he has\nit again.'\n\n'Three to one still on Tetraides!  What say you, Lepidus?'\n\n'Well, nine sestertia to three--be it so!  What! again, Lydon?  He\nstops--he gasps for breath.  By the gods, he is down.  No--he is again\non his legs. Brave Lydon! Tetraides is encouraged--he laughs loud--he\nrushes on him.'\n\n'Fool--success blinds him--he should be cautious.  Lydon's eye is like\nthe lynx's,' said Clodius, between his teeth.\n\n'Ha, Clodius! saw you that?  Your man totters!  Another blow--he\nfalls--he falls!'\n\n'Earth revives him, then.  He is once more up; but the blood rolls down\nhis face.'\n\n'By the thunderer! Lydon wins it.  See how he presses on him! That blow\non the temple would have crushed an ox! it has crushed Tetraides.  He\nfalls again--he cannot move--habet!--habet!'\n\n'Habet!' repeated Pansa.  'Take them out and give them the armor and\nswords.'\n\n'Noble editor,' said the officers, 'we fear that Tetraides will not\nrecover in time; howbeit, we will try.'\n\n'Do so.'\n\nIn a few minutes the officers, who had dragged off the stunned and\ninsensible gladiator, returned with rueful countenances.  They feared\nfor his life; he was utterly incapacitated from re-entering the arena.\n\n'In that case,' said Pansa, 'hold Lydon a subdititius; and the first\ngladiator that is vanquished, let Lydon supply his place with the\nvictor.' The people shouted their applause at this sentence: then they\nagain sunk into deep silence.  The trumpet sounded loudly. The four\ncombatants stood each against each in prepared and stern array.\n\n'Dost thou recognize the Romans, my Clodius; are they among the\ncelebrated, or are they merely ordinary?'\n\n'Eumolpus is a good second-rate swordsman, my Lepidus.  Nepimus, the\nlesser man, I have never seen before: but he is the son of one of the\nimperial fiscales, and brought up in a proper school; doubtless they\nwill show sport, but I have no heart for the game; I cannot win back my\nmoney--I am undone. Curses on that Lydon! who could have supposed he was\nso dexterous or so lucky?'\n\n'Well, Clodius, shall I take compassion on you, and accept your own\nterms with these Romans?'\n\n'An even ten sestertia on Eumolpus, then?'\n\n'What! when Nepimus is untried?  Nay, nay; that is to bad.'\n\n'Well--ten to eight?'\n\n'Agreed.'\n\nWhile the contest in the amphitheatre had thus commenced, there was one\nin the loftier benches for whom it had assumed, indeed, a poignant--a\nstifling interest.  The aged father of Lydon, despite his Christian\nhorror of the spectacle, in his agonized anxiety for his son, had not\nbeen able to resist being the spectator of his fate. One amidst a fierce\ncrowd of strangers--the lowest rabble of the populace--the old man saw,\nfelt nothing, but the form--the presence of his brave son!  Not a sound\nhad escaped his lips when twice he had seen him fall to the earth--only\nhe had turned paler, and his limbs trembled.  But he had uttered one low\ncry when he saw him victorious; unconscious, alas! of the more fearful\nbattle to which that victory was but a prelude.\n\n'My gallant boy!' said he, and wiped his eyes.\n\n'Is he thy son?' said a brawny fellow to the right of the Nazarene; 'he\nhas fought well: let us see how he does by-and-by.  Hark! he is to fight\nthe first victor.  Now, old boy, pray the gods that that victor be\nneither of the Romans! nor, next to them, the giant Niger.'\n\nThe old man sat down again and covered his face.  The fray for the\nmoment was indifferent to him--Lydon was not one of the combatants.\nYet--yet--the thought flashed across him--the fray was indeed of deadly\ninterest--the first who fell was to make way for Lydon!  He started, and\nbent down, with straining eyes and clasped hands, to view the encounter.\n\nThe first interest was attracted towards the combat of Niger with\nSporus; for this species of contest, from the fatal result which usually\nattended it, and from the great science it required in either\nantagonist, was always peculiarly inviting to the spectators.\n\nThey stood at a considerable distance from each other.  The singular\nhelmet which Sporus wore (the vizor of which was down) concealed his\nface; but the features of Niger attracted a fearful and universal\ninterest from their compressed and vigilant ferocity. Thus they stood\nfor some moments, each eyeing each, until Sporus began slowly, and with\ngreat caution, to advance, holding his sword pointed, like a modern\nfencer's, at the breast of his foe. Niger retreated as his antagonist\nadvanced, gathering up his net with his right hand, and never taking his\nsmall glittering eye from the movements of the swordsman.  Suddenly when\nSporus had approached nearly at arm's length, the retiarius threw\nhimself forward, and cast his net.  A quick inflection of body saved the\ngladiator from the deadly snare! he uttered a sharp cry of joy and rage,\nand rushed upon Niger: but Niger had already drawn in his net, thrown it\nacross his shoulders, and now fled round the lists with a swiftness\nwhich the secutor in vain endeavored to equal.  The people laughed and\nshouted aloud, to see the ineffectual efforts of the broad-shouldered\ngladiator to overtake the flying giant: when, at that moment, their\nattention was turned from these to the two Roman combatants.\n\nThey had placed themselves at the onset face to face, at the distance of\nmodern fencers from each other: but the extreme caution which both\nevinced at first had prevented any warmth of engagement, and allowed the\nspectators full leisure to interest themselves in the battle between\nSporus and his foe.  But the Romans were now heated into full and fierce\nencounter: they pushed--returned--advanced on--retreated from each other\nwith all that careful yet scarcely perceptible caution which\ncharacterizes men well experienced and equally matched.  But at this\nmoment, Eumolpus, the elder gladiator, by that dexterous back-stroke\nwhich was considered in the arena so difficult to avoid, had wounded\nNepimus in the side.  The people shouted; Lepidus turned pale.\n\n'Ho!' said Clodius, 'the game is nearly over.  If Eumolpus fights now\nthe quiet fight, the other will gradually bleed himself away.'\n\n'But, thank the gods! he does not fight the backward fight. See!--he\npresses hard upon Nepimus.  By Mars! but Nepimus had him there! the\nhelmet rang again!--Clodius, I shall win!'\n\n'Why do I ever bet but at the dice?' groaned Clodius to himself;--or why\ncannot one cog a gladiator?'\n\n'A Sporus!--a Sporus!' shouted the populace, as Niger having now\nsuddenly paused, had again cast his net, and again unsuccessfully. He\nhad not retreated this time with sufficient agility--the sword of Sporus\nhad inflicted a severe wound upon his right leg; and, incapacitated to\nfly, he was pressed hard by the fierce swordsman.  His great height and\nlength of arm still continued, however, to give him no despicable\nadvantages; and steadily keeping his trident at the front of his foe, he\nrepelled him successfully for several minutes. Sporus now tried, by\ngreat rapidity of evolution, to get round his antagonist, who\nnecessarily moved with pain and slowness.  In so doing, he lost his\ncaution--he advanced too near to the giant--raised his arm to strike,\nand received the three points of the fatal spear full in his breast!  He\nsank on his knee.  In a moment more, the deadly net was cast over him,\nhe struggled against its meshes in vain; again--again--again he writhed\nmutely beneath the fresh strokes of the trident--his blood flowed fast\nthrough the net and redly over the sand.  He lowered his arms in\nacknowledgment of defeat.\n\nThe conquering retiarius withdrew his net, and leaning on his spear,\nlooked to the audience for their judgement.  Slowly, too, at the same\nmoment, the vanquished gladiator rolled his dim and despairing eyes\naround the theatre. From row to row, from bench to bench, there glared\nupon him but merciless and unpitying eyes.\n\nHushed was the roar--the murmur!  The silence was dread, for it was no\nsympathy; not a hand--no, not even a woman's hand--gave the signal of\ncharity and life!  Sporus had never been popular in the arena; and,\nlately, the interest of the combat had been excited on behalf of the\nwounded Niger. The people were warmed into blood--the mimic fight had\nceased to charm; the interest had mounted up to the desire of sacrifice\nand the thirst of death!\n\nThe gladiator felt that his doom was sealed: he uttered no prayer--no\ngroan. The people gave the signal of death!  In dogged but agonized\nsubmission, he bent his neck to receive the fatal stroke.  And now, as\nthe spear of the retiarius was not a weapon to inflict instant and\ncertain death, there stalked into the arena a grim and fatal form,\nbrandishing a short, sharp sword, and with features utterly concealed\nbeneath its vizor.  With slow and measured steps, this dismal headsman\napproached the gladiator, still kneeling--laid the left hand on his\nhumbled crest--drew the edge of the blade across his neck--turned round\nto the assembly, lest, in the last moment, remorse should come upon\nthem; the dread signal continued the same: the blade glittered brightly\nin the air--fell--and the gladiator rolled upon the sand; his limbs\nquivered--were still--he was a corpse.'\n\nHis body was dragged at once from the arena through the gate of death,\nand thrown into the gloomy den termed technically the spoliarium.  And\nere it had well reached that destination, the strife between the\nremaining combatants was decided.  The sword of Eumolpus had inflicted\nthe death-wound upon the less experienced combatant.  A new victim was\nadded to the receptacle of the slain.\n\nThroughout that mighty assembly there now ran a universal movement; the\npeople breathed more freely, and resettled themselves in their seats.  A\ngrateful shower was cast over every row from the concealed conduits.  In\ncool and luxurious pleasure they talked over the late spectacle of\nblood. Eumolpus removed his helmet, and wiped his brows; his\nclose-curled hair and short beard, his noble Roman features and bright\ndark eye attracted the general admiration.  He was fresh, unwounded,\nunfatigued.\n\nThe editor paused, and proclaimed aloud that, as Niger's wound disabled\nhim from again entering the arena, Lydon was to be the successor to the\nslaughtered Nepimus, and the new combatant of Eumolpus.\n\n'Yet, Lydon,' added he, 'if thou wouldst decline the combat with one so\nbrave and tried, thou mayst have full liberty to do so. Eumolpus is not\nthe antagonist that was originally decreed for thee. Thou knowest best\nhow far thou canst cope with him.  If thou failest, thy doom is\nhonorable death; if thou conquerest, out of my own purse I will double\nthe stipulated prize.'\n\nThe people shouted applause.  Lydon stood in the lists, he gazed around;\nhigh above he beheld the pale face, the straining eyes, of his father.\nHe turned away irresolute for a moment.  No! the conquest of the cestus\nwas not sufficient--he had not yet won the prize of victory--his father\nwas still a slave!\n\n'Noble aedile!' he replied, in a firm and deep tone, 'I shrink not from\nthis combat.  For the honour of Pompeii, I demand that one trained by\nits long-celebrated lanista shall do battle with this Roman.'\n\nThe people shouted louder than before.\n\n'Four to one against Lydon!' said Clodius to Lepidus.\n\n'I would not take twenty to one!  Why, Eumolpus is a very Achilles, and\nthis poor fellow is but a tyro!'\n\nEumolpus gazed hard on the face of Lydon; he smiled; yet the smile was\nfollowed by a slight and scarce audible sigh--a touch of compassionate\nemotion, which custom conquered the moment the heart acknowledged it.\n\nAnd now both, clad in complete armor, the sword drawn, the vizor closed,\nthe two last combatants of the arena (ere man, at least, was matched\nwith beast), stood opposed to each other.\n\nIt was just at this time that a letter was delivered to the proctor by\none of the attendants of the arena; he removed the cincture--glanced\nover it for a moment--his countenance betrayed surprise and\nembarrassment.  He re-read the letter, and then muttering--'Tush! it is\nimpossible!--the man must be drunk, even in the morning, to dream of\nsuch follies!'--threw it carelessly aside, and gravely settled himself\nonce more in the attitude of attention to the sports.\n\nThe interest of the public was wound up very high.  Eumolpus had at\nfirst won their favor; but the gallantry of Lydon, and his well-timed\nallusion to the honour of the Pompeian lanista, had afterwards given the\nlatter the preference in their eyes.\n\n'Holla, old fellow!' said Medon's neighbor to him.  'Your son is hardly\nmatched; but never fear, the editor will not permit him to be slain--no,\nnor the people neither; he has behaved too bravely for that.  Ha! that\nwas a home thrust!--well averted, by Pollux!  At him again, Lydon!--they\nstop to breathe.  What art thou muttering, old boy\n\n'Prayers!' answered Medon, with a more calm and hopeful mien than he had\nyet maintained.\n\n'Prayers!--trifles!  The time for gods to carry a man away in a cloud is\ngone now.  Ha! Jupiter! what a blow!  Thy side--thy side!--take care of\nthy side, Lydon!'\n\nThere was a convulsive tremor throughout the assembly.  A fierce blow\nfrom Eumolpus, full on the crest, had brought Lydon to his knee.\n\n'Habet!--he has it!' cried a shrill female voice; 'he has it!' It was\nthe voice of the girl who had so anxiously anticipated the sacrifice of\nsome criminal to the beasts.\n\n'Be silent, child!' said the wife of Pansa, haughtily.  'Non habet!--he\nis not wounded!'\n\n'I wish he were, if only to spite old surly Medon,' muttered the girl.\n\nMeanwhile Lydon, who had hitherto defended himself with great skill and\nvalor, began to give way before the vigorous assaults of the practised\nRoman; his arm grew tired, his eye dizzy, he breathed hard and\npainfully. The combatants paused again for breath.\n\n'Young man,' said Eumolpus, in a low voice, 'desist; I will wound thee\nslightly--then lower thy arms; thou hast propitiated the editor and the\nmob--thou wilt be honorably saved!'\n\n'And my father still enslaved!' groaned Lydon to himself.  'No! death or\nhis freedom.'\n\nAt that thought, and seeing that, his strength not being equal to the\nendurance of the Roman, everything depended on a sudden and desperate\neffort, he threw himself fiercely on Eumolpus; the Roman warily\nretreated--Lydon thrust again--Eumolpus drew himself aside--the sword\ngrazed his cuirass--Lydon's breast was exposed--the Roman plunged his\nsword through the joints of the armor, not meaning, however, to inflict\na deep wound; Lydon, weak and exhausted, fell forward, fell right on the\npoint: it passed through and through, even to the back.  Eumolpus drew\nforth his blade; Lydon still made an effort to regain his balance--his\nsword left his grasp--he struck mechanically at the gladiator with his\nnaked hand, and fell prostrate on the arena.  With one accord, editor\nand assembly made the signal of mercy--the officers of the arena\napproached--they took off the helmet of the vanquished.  He still\nbreathed; his eyes rolled fiercely on his foe; the savageness he had\nacquired in his calling glared from his gaze, and lowered upon the brow\ndarkened already with the shades of death; then, with a convulsive\ngroan, with a half start, he lifted his eyes above.  They rested not on\nthe face of the editor nor on the pitying brows of his relenting judges.\nHe saw them not; they were as if the vast space was desolate and bare;\none pale agonizing face alone was all he recognized--one cry of a broken\nheart was all that, amidst the murmurs and the shouts of the populace,\nreached his ear.  The ferocity vanished from his brow; a soft, a tender\nexpression of sanctifying but despairing love played over his\nfeatures--played--waned--darkened!  His face suddenly became locked and\nrigid, resuming its former fierceness.  He fell upon the earth.\n\n'Look to him,' said the aedile; 'he has done his duty!'\n\nThe officers dragged him off to the spoliarium.\n\n'A true type of glory, and of its fate!' murmured Arbaces to himself,\nand his eye, glancing round the amphitheatre, betrayed so much of\ndisdain and scorn, that whoever encountered it felt his breath suddenly\narrested, and his emotions frozen into one sensation of abasement and of\nawe.\n\nAgain rich perfumes were wafted around the theatre; the attendants\nsprinkled fresh sand over the arena.\n\n'Bring forth the lion and Glaucus the Athenian,' said the editor.\n\nAnd a deep and breathless hush of overwrought interest, and intense\n(yet, strange to say, not unpleasing) terror lay, like a mighty and\nawful dream, over the assembly.\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nSALLUST AND NYDIA'S LETTER.\n\nTHRICE had Sallust awakened from his morning sleep, and thrice,\nrecollecting that his friend was that day to perish, had he turned\nhimself with a deep sigh once more to court oblivion.  His sole object\nin life was to avoid pain; and where he could not avoid, at least to\nforget it.\n\nAt length, unable any longer to steep his consciousness in slumber, he\nraised himself from his incumbent posture, and discovered his favorite\nfreedman sitting by his bedside as usual; for Sallust, who, as I have\nsaid, had a gentlemanlike taste for the polite letters, was accustomed\nto be read to for an hour or so previous to his rising in the morning.\n\n'No books to-day! no more Tibullus! no more Pindar for me!  Pindar!\nalas, alas! the very name recalls those games to which our arena is the\nsavage successor.  Has it begun--the amphitheatre? are its rites\ncommenced?'\n\n'Long since, O Sallust!  Did you not hear the trumpets and the trampling\nfeet?'\n\n'Ay, ay; but the gods be thanked, I was drowsy, and had only to turn\nround to fall asleep again.'\n\n'The gladiators must have been long in the ring.'\n\n'The wretches!  None of my people have gone to the spectacle?'\n\n'Assuredly not; your orders were too strict.'\n\n'That is well--would the day were over!  What is that letter yonder on\nthe table?'\n\n'That!  Oh, the letter brought to you last night, when you\nwere--too--too...'\n\n'Drunk to read it, I suppose.  No matter, it cannot be of much\nimportance.'\n\n'Shall I open it for you, Sallust,'\n\n'Do: anything to divert my thoughts.  Poor Glaucus!'\n\nThe freedman opened the letter.  'What! Greek?' said he, 'some learned\nlady, I suppose.' He glanced over the letter, and for some moments the\nirregular lines traced by the blind girl's hand puzzled him.  Suddenly,\nhowever, his countenance exhibited emotion and surprise.  'Good gods!\nnoble Sallust! what have we done not to attend to this before?  Hear me\nread!'\n\n'\"Nydia, the slave, to Sallust, the friend of Glaucus!  I am a prisoner\nin the house of Arbaces.  Hasten to the praetor! procure my release, and\nwe shall yet save Glaucus from the lion.  There is another prisoner\nwithin these walls, whose witness can exonerate the Athenian from the\ncharge against him--one who saw the crime--who can prove the criminal in\na villain hitherto unsuspected.  Fly! hasten! quick! quick!  Bring with\nyou armed men, lest resistance be made, and a cunning and dexterous\nsmith; for the dungeon of my fellow-prisoner is thick and strong.  Oh!\nby thy right hand and thy father's ashes, lose not a moment!\"'\n\n'Great Jove!' exclaimed Sallust, starting, 'and this day--nay, within\nthis hour, perhaps, he dies.  What is to be done?  I will instantly to\nthe praetor.'\n\n'Nay; not so.  The praetor (as well as Pansa, the editor himself) is the\ncreature of the mob; and the mob will not hear of delay; they will not\nbe balked in the very moment of expectation.  Besides, the publicity of\nthe appeal would forewarn the cunning Egyptian.  It is evident that he\nhas some interest in these concealments.  No; fortunately thy slaves are\nin thy house.'\n\n'I seize thy meaning,' interrupted Sallust: 'arm the slaves instantly.\nThe streets are empty.  We will ourselves hasten to the house of\nArbaces, and release the prisoners.  Quick! quick!  What ho! Davus\nthere!  My gown and sandals, the papyrus and a reed.' I will write to\nthe praetor, to beseech him to delay the sentence of Glaucus, for that,\nwithin an hour, we may yet prove him innocent.  So, so, that is well.\nHasten with this, Davus, to the praetor, at the amphitheatre.  See it\ngiven to his own hand.  Now then, O ye gods! whose providence Epicurus\ndenied, befriend me, and I will call Epicurus a liar!'\n\n\n\nChapter IV\nTHE AMPHITHEATRE ONCE MORE.\n\nGLAUCUS and Olinthus had been placed together in that gloomy and narrow\ncell in which the criminals of the arena awaited their last and fearful\nstruggle. Their eyes, of late accustomed to the darkness, scanned the\nfaces of each other in this awful hour, and by that dim light, the\npaleness, which chased away the natural hues from either cheek, assumed\na yet more ashy and ghastly whiteness.  Yet their brows were erect and\ndauntless--their limbs did not tremble--their lips were compressed and\nrigid.  The religion of the one, the pride of the other, the conscious\ninnocence of both, and, it may be, the support derived from their mutual\ncompanionship, elevated the victim into the hero.\n\n'Hark! hearest thou that shout They are growling over their human\nblood,' said Olinthus.\n\n'I hear; my heart grows sick; but the gods support me.'\n\n'The gods!  O rash young man!  in this hour recognize only the One God.\nHave I not taught thee in the dungeon, wept for thee, prayed for\nthee?--in my zeal and in my agony, have I not thought more of thy\nsalvation than my own?'\n\n'Brave friend!' answered Glaucus, solemnly, 'I have listened to thee\nwith awe, with wonder, and with a secret tendency towards conviction.\nHad our lives been spared, I might gradually have weaned myself from the\ntenets of my own faith, and inclined to thine; but, in this last hour it\nwere a craven thing, and a base, to yield to hasty terror what should\nonly be the result of lengthened meditation.  Were I to embrace thy\ncreed, and cast down my father's gods, should I not be bribed by thy\npromise of heaven, or awed by thy threats of hell? Olinthus, no!  Think\nwe of each other with equal charity--I honoring thy sincerity--thou\npitying my blindness or my obdurate courage.  As have been my deeds,\nsuch will be my reward; and the Power or Powers above will not judge\nharshly of human error, when it is linked with honesty of purpose and\ntruth of heart.  Speak we no more of this.  Hush! Dost thou hear them\ndrag yon heavy body through the passage?  Such as that clay will be ours\nsoon.'\n\n'O Heaven!  O Christ! already I behold ye!' cried the fervent Olinthus,\nlifting up his hands; 'I tremble not--I rejoice that the prison-house\nshall be soon broken.'\n\nGlaucus bowed his head in silence.  He felt the distinction between his\nfortitude and that of his fellow-sufferer.  The heathen did not tremble;\nbut the Christian exulted.\n\nThe door swung gratingly back--the gleam of spears shot along the walls.\n\n'Glaucus the Athenian, thy time has come,' said a loud and clear voice;\n'the lion awaits thee.'\n\n'I am ready,' said the Athenian.  'Brother and co-mate, one last\nembrace! Bless me--and farewell!'\n\nThe Christian opened his arms--he clasped the young heathen to his\nbreast--he kissed his forehead and cheek--he sobbed aloud--his tears\nflowed fast and hot over the features of his new friend.\n\n'Oh! could I have converted thee, I had not wept.  Oh! that I might say\nto thee, \"We two shall sup this night in Paradise!\"'\n\n'It may be so yet,' answered the Greek, with a tremulous voice. 'They\nwhom death part not, may meet yet beyond the grave: on the earth--on the\nbeautiful, the beloved earth, farewell for ever!--Worthy officer, I\nattend you.'\n\nGlaucus tore himself away; and when he came forth into the air, its\nbreath, which, though sunless, was hot and arid, smote witheringly upon\nhim.  His frame, not yet restored from the effects of the deadly\ndraught, shrank and trembled.  The officers supported him.\n\n'Courage!' said one; 'thou art young, active, well knit.  They give thee\na weapon! despair not, and thou mayst yet conquer.'\n\nGlaucus did not reply; but, ashamed of his infirmity, he made a\ndesperate and convulsive effort, and regained the firmness of his\nnerves.  They anointed his body, completely naked, save by a cincture\nround the loins, placed the stilus (vain weapon!) in his hand, and led\nhim into the arena.\n\nAnd now when the Greek saw the eyes of thousands and tens of thousands\nupon him, he no longer felt that he was mortal.  All evidence of\nfear--all fear itself--was gone.  A red and haughty flush spread over\nthe paleness of his features--he towered aloft to the full of his\nglorious stature.  In the elastic beauty of his limbs and form, in his\nintent but unfrowning brow, in the high disdain, and in the indomitable\nsoul, which breathed visibly, which spoke audibly, from his attitude,\nhis lip, his eye--he seemed the very incarnation, vivid and corporeal,\nof the valor of his land--of the divinity of its worship--at once a hero\nand a god!\n\nThe murmur of hatred and horror at his crime, which had greeted his\nentrance, died into the silence of involuntary admiration and\nhalf-compassionate respect; and with a quick and convulsive sigh, that\nseemed to move the whole mass of life as if it were one body, the gaze\nof the spectators turned from the Athenian to a dark uncouth object in\nthe centre of the arena.  It was the grated den of the lion!\n\n'By Venus, how warm it is!' said Fulvia; 'yet there is no sun. Would\nthat those stupid sailors could have fastened up that gap in the\nawning!'\n\n'Oh! it is warm, indeed.  I turn sick--I faint!' said the wife of Pansa;\neven her experienced stoicism giving way at the struggle about to take\nplace.\n\nThe lion had been kept without food for twenty-four hours, and the\nanimal had, during the whole morning, testified a singular and restless\nuneasiness, which the keeper had attributed to the pangs of hunger.  Yet\nits bearing seemed rather that of fear than of rage; its roar was\npainful and distressed; it hung its head--snuffed the air through the\nbars--then lay down--started again--and again uttered its wild and\nfar-resounding cries. And now, in its den, it lay utterly dumb and mute,\nwith distended nostrils forced hard against the grating, and disturbing\nwith a heaving breath, the sand below on the arena.\n\nThe editor's lip quivered, and his cheek grew pale; he looked anxiously\naround--hesitated--delayed; the crowd became impatient. Slowly he gave\nthe sign; the keeper, who was behind the den, cautiously removed the\ngrating, and the lion leaped forth with a mighty and glad roar of\nrelease.  The keeper hastily retreated through the grated passage\nleading from the arena, and left the lord of the forest--and his prey.\n\nGlaucus had bent his limbs so as to give himself the firmest posture at\nthe expected rush of the lion, with his small and shining weapon raised\non high, in the faint hope that one well-directed thrust (for he knew\nthat he should have time but for one) might penetrate through the eye to\nthe brain of his grim foe.\n\nBut, to the unutterable astonishment of all, the beast seemed not even\naware of the presence of the criminal.\n\nAt the first moment of its release it halted abruptly in the arena,\nraised itself half on end, snuffing the upward air with impatient sighs;\nthen suddenly it sprang forward, but not on the Athenian.  At half-speed\nit circled round and round the space, turning its vast head from side to\nside with an anxious and perturbed gaze, as if seeking only some avenue\nof escape; once or twice it endeavored to leap up the parapet that\ndivided it from the audience, and, on failing, uttered rather a baffled\nhowl than its deep-toned and kingly roar.  It evinced no sign, either of\nwrath or hunger; its tail drooped along the sand, instead of lashing its\ngaunt sides; and its eye, though it wandered at times to Glaucus, rolled\nagain listlessly from him.  At length, as if tired of attempting to\nescape, it crept with a moan into its cage, and once more laid itself\ndown to rest.\n\nThe first surprise of the assembly at the apathy of the lion soon grew\nconverted into resentment at its cowardice; and the populace already\nmerged their pity for the fate of Glaucus into angry compassion for\ntheir own disappointment.\n\nThe editor called to the keeper.\n\n'How is this?  Take the goad, prick him forth, and then close the door\nof the den.'\n\nAs the keeper, with some fear, but more astonishment, was preparing to\nobey, a loud cry was heard at one of the entrances of the arena; there\nwas a confusion, a bustle--voices of remonstrance suddenly breaking\nforth, and suddenly silenced at the reply.  All eyes turned in wonder at\nthe interruption, towards the quarter of the disturbance; the crowd gave\nway, and suddenly Sallust appeared on the senatorial benches, his hair\ndisheveled--breathless--heated--half-exhausted.  He cast his eyes\nhastily round the ring.  'Remove the Athenian,' he cried; 'haste--he is\ninnocent! Arrest Arbaces the Egyptian--HE is the murderer of Apaecides!'\n\n'Art thou mad, O Sallust!' said the praetor, rising from his seat. 'What\nmeans this raving?'\n\n'Remove the Athenian!--Quick! or his blood be on your head. Praetor,\ndelay, and you answer with your own life to the emperor!  I bring with\nme the eye-witness to the death of the priest Apaecides. Room\nthere!--stand back!--give way!  People of Pompeii, fix every eye upon\nArbaces--there he sits!  Room there for the priest Calenus!'\n\nPale, haggard, fresh from the jaws of famine and of death, his face\nfallen, his eyes dull as a vulture's, his broad frame gaunt as a\nskeleton--Calenus was supported into the very row in which Arbaces sat.\nHis releasers had given him sparingly of food; but the chief sustenance\nthat nerved his feeble limbs was revenge!\n\n'The priest Calenus!--Calenus!' cried the mob.  'Is it he?  No--it is a\ndead man?'\n\n'It is the priest Calenus,' said the praetor, gravely.  'What hast thou\nto say?'\n\n'Arbaces of Egypt is the murderer of Apaecides, the priest of Isis;\nthese eyes saw him deal the blow.  It is from the dungeon into which he\nplunged me--it is from the darkness and horror of a death by\nfamine--that the gods have raised me to proclaim his crime!  Release the\nAthenian--he is innocent!'\n\n'It is for this, then, that the lion spared him.  A miracle! a miracle!'\ncried Pansa.\n\n'A miracle; a miracle!' shouted the people; 'remove the\nAthenian--Arbaces to the lion!'\n\nAnd that shout echoed from hill to vale--from coast to sea--'Arbaces to\nthe lion!'\n\nOfficers, remove the accused Glaucus--remove, but guard him yet,' said\nthe praetor.  'The gods lavish their wonders upon this day.'\n\nAs the praetor gave the word of release, there was a cry of joy--a\nfemale voice--a child's voice--and it was of joy!  It rang through the\nheart of the assembly with electric force--it, was touching, it was\nholy, that child's voice!  And the populace echoed it back with\nsympathizing congratulation!\n\n'Silence!' said the grave praetor--'who is there?'\n\n'The blind girl--Nydia,' answered Sallust; 'it is her hand that has\nraised Calenus from the grave, and delivered Glaucus from the lion.'\n\n'Of this hereafter,' said the praetor.  'Calenus, priest of Isis, thou\naccusest Arbaces of the murder of Apaecides?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'Thou didst behold the deed?'\n\n'Praetor--with these eyes...'\n\n'Enough at present--the details must be reserved for more suiting time\nand place.  Arbaces of Egypt, thou hearest the charge against thee--thou\nhast not yet spoken--what hast thou to say.\n\nThe gaze of the crowd had been long riveted on Arbaces: but not until\nthe confusion which he had betrayed at the first charge of Sallust and\nthe entrance of Calenus had subsided.  At the shout, 'Arbaces to the\nlion!' he had indeed trembled, and the dark bronze of his cheek had\ntaken a paler hue. But he had soon recovered his haughtiness and\nself-control.  Proudly he returned the angry glare of the countless eyes\naround him; and replying now to the question of the praetor, he said, in\nthat accent so peculiarly tranquil and commanding, which characterized\nhis tones:\n\n'Praetor, this charge is so mad that it scarcely deserves reply. My\nfirst accuser is the noble Sallust--the most intimate friend of Glaucus!\nmy second is a priest; I revere his garb and calling--but, people of\nPompeii! ye know somewhat of the character of Calenus--he is griping and\ngold-thirsty to a proverb; the witness of such men is to be bought!\nPraetor, I am innocent!'\n\n'Sallust,' said the magistrate, 'where found you Calenus?'\n\n'In the dungeons of Arbaces.'\n\n'Egyptian,' said the praetor, frowning, 'thou didst, then, dare to\nimprison a priest of the gods--and wherefore?'\n\n'Hear me,' answered Arbaces, rising calmly, but with agitation visible\nin his face.  'This man came to threaten that he would make against me\nthe charge he has now made, unless I would purchase his silence with\nhalf my fortune: I remonstrated--in vain.  Peace there--let not the\npriest interrupt me!  Noble praetor--and ye, O people!  I was a stranger\nin the land--I knew myself innocent of crime--but the witness of a\npriest against me might yet destroy me.  In my perplexity I decoyed him\nto the cell whence he has been released, on pretence that it was the\ncoffer-house of my gold.  I resolved to detain him there until the fate\nof the true criminal was sealed, and his threats could avail no longer;\nbut I meant no worse.  I may have erred--but who amongst ye will not\nacknowledge the equity of self-preservation?  Were I guilty, why was the\nwitness of this priest silent at the trial?--then I had not detained or\nconcealed him.  Why did he not proclaim my guilt when I proclaimed that\nof Glaucus? Praetor, this needs an answer.  For the rest, I throw myself\non your laws.  I demand their protection.  Remove hence the accused and\nthe accuser.  I will willingly meet, and cheerfully abide by, the\ndecision of the legitimate tribunal.  This is no place for further\nparley.'\n\n'He says right,' said the praetor.  'Ho! guards--remove Arbaces--guard\nCalenus!  Sallust, we hold you responsible for your accusation. Let the\nsports be resumed.'\n\n'What!' cried Calenus, turning round to the people, 'shall Isis be thus\ncontemned?  Shall the blood of Apaecides yet cry for vengeance? Shall\njustice be delayed now, that it may be frustrated hereafter? Shall the\nlion be cheated of his lawful prey?  A god! a god!--I feel the god rush\nto my lips!  To the lion--to the lion with Arbaces!'\n\nHis exhausted frame could support no longer the ferocious malice of the\npriest; he sank on the ground in strong convulsions--the foam gathered\nto his mouth--he was as a man, indeed, whom a supernatural power had\nentered! The people saw and shuddered.\n\n'It is a god that inspires the holy man!  To the lion with the\nEgyptian!'\n\nWith that cry up sprang--on moved--thousands upon thousands! They rushed\nfrom the heights--they poured down in the direction of the Egyptian.  In\nvain did the aedile command--in vain did the praetor lift his voice and\nproclaim the law.  The people had been already rendered savage by the\nexhibition of blood--they thirsted for more--their superstition was\naided by their ferocity.  Aroused--inflamed by the spectacle of their\nvictims, they forgot the authority of their rulers.  It was one of those\ndread popular convulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant, half free\nand half servile; and which the peculiar constitution of the Roman\nprovinces so frequently exhibited.  The power of the praetor was as a\nreed beneath the whirlwind; still, at his word the guards had drawn\nthemselves along the lower benches, on which the upper classes sat\nseparate from the vulgar.  They made but a feeble barrier--the waves of\nthe human sea halted for a moment, to enable Arbaces to count the exact\nmoment of his doom!  In despair, and in a terror which beat down even\npride, he glanced his eyes over the rolling and rushing crowd--when,\nright above them, through the wide chasm which had been left in the\nvelaria, he beheld a strange and awful apparition--he beheld--and his\ncraft restored his courage!\n\nHe stretched his hand on high; over his lofty brow and royal features\nthere came an expression of unutterable solemnity and command.\n\n'Behold!' he shouted with a voice of thunder, which stilled the roar of\nthe crowd; 'behold how the gods protect the guiltless!  The fires of the\navenging Orcus burst forth against the false witness of my accusers!'\n\nThe eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian, and beheld,\nwith ineffable dismay, a vast vapor shooting from the summit of\nVesuvius, in the form of a gigantic pine-tree; the trunk, blackness--the\nbranches, fire!--a fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with every\nmoment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red, that again\nblazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare!\n\nThere was a dead, heart-sunken silence--through which there suddenly\nbroke the roar of the lion, which was echoed back from within the\nbuilding by the sharper and fiercer yells of its fellow-beast. Dread\nseers were they of the Burden of the Atmosphere, and wild prophets of\nthe wrath to come!\n\nThen there arose on high the universal shrieks of women; the men stared\nat each other, but were dumb.  At that moment they felt the earth shake\nbeneath their feet; the walls of the theatre trembled: and, beyond in\nthe distance, they heard the crash of falling roofs; an instant more and\nthe mountain-cloud seemed to roll towards them, dark and rapid, like a\ntorrent; at the same time, it cast forth from its bosom a shower of\nashes mixed with vast fragments of burning stone!  Over the crushing\nvines--over the desolate streets--over the amphitheatre itself--far and\nwide--with many a mighty splash in the agitated sea--fell that awful\nshower!\n\nNo longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces; safety for\nthemselves was their sole thought.  Each turned to fly--each dashing,\npressing, crushing, against the other.  Trampling recklessly over the\nfallen--amidst groans, and oaths, and prayers, and sudden shrieks, the\nenormous crowd vomited itself forth through the numerous passages.\nWhither should they fly? Some, anticipating a second earthquake,\nhastened to their homes to load themselves with their more costly goods,\nand escape while it was yet time; others, dreading the showers of ashes\nthat now fell fast, torrent upon torrent, over the streets, rushed under\nthe roofs of the nearest houses, or temples, or sheds--shelter of any\nkind--for protection from the terrors of the open air.  But darker, and\nlarger, and mightier, spread the cloud above them.  It was a sudden and\nmore ghastly Night rushing upon the realm of Noon!\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nTHE CELL OF THE PRISONER AND THE DEN OF THE DEAD.  GRIEF UNCONSCIOUS OF\nHORROR.\n\nSTUNNED by his reprieve, doubting that he was awake, Glaucus had been\nled by the officers of the arena into a small cell within the walls of\nthe theatre. They threw a loose robe over his form, and crowded round in\ncongratulation and wonder.  There was an impatient and fretful cry\nwithout the cell; the throng gave way, and the blind girl, led by some\ngentler hand, flung herself at the feet of Glaucus.\n\n'It is I who have saved thee,' she sobbed; 'now let me die!'\n\n'Nydia, my child!--my preserver!'\n\n'Oh, let me feel thy touch--thy breath!  Yes, yes, thou livest! We are\nnot too late!  That dread door, methought it would never yield! and\nCalenus--oh! his voice was as the dying wind among tombs--we had to\nwait--gods! it seemed hours ere food and wine restored to him something\nof strength.  But thou livest! thou livest yet! And I--I have saved\nthee!'\n\nThis affecting scene was soon interrupted by the event just described.\n\n'The mountain! the earthquake!' resounded from side to side.  The\nofficers fled with the rest; they left Glaucus and Nydia to save\nthemselves as they might.\n\nAs the sense of the dangers around them flashed on the Athenian, his\ngenerous heart recurred to Olinthus.  He, too, was reprieved from the\ntiger by the hand of the gods; should he be left to a no less fatal\ndeath in the neighboring cell?  Taking Nydia by the hand, Glaucus\nhurried across the passages; he gained the den of the Christian!  He\nfound Olinthus kneeling and in prayer.\n\n'Arise! arise! my friend,' he cried.  'Save thyself, and fly! See!\nNature is thy dread deliverer!' He led forth the bewildered Christian,\nand pointed to a cloud which advanced darker and darker, disgorging\nforth showers of ashes and pumice stones--and bade him hearken to the\ncries and trampling rush of the scattered crowd.\n\n'This is the hand of God--God be praised!' said Olinthus, devoutly.\n\n'Fly! seek thy brethren!--Concert with them thy escape.  Farewell!'\n\nOlinthus did not answer, neither did he mark the retreating form of his\nfriend.  High thoughts and solemn absorbed his soul: and in the\nenthusiasm of his kindling heart, he exulted in the mercy of God rather\nthan trembled at the evidence of His power.\n\nAt length he roused himself, and hurried on, he scarce knew whither.\n\nThe open doors of a dark, desolate cell suddenly appeared on his path;\nthrough the gloom within there flared and flickered a single lamp; and\nby its light he saw three grim and naked forms stretched on the earth in\ndeath. His feet were suddenly arrested; for, amidst the terror of that\ndrear recess--the spoliarium of the arena--he heard a low voice calling\non the name of Christ!\n\nHe could not resist lingering at that appeal: he entered the den, and\nhis feet were dabbled in the slow streams of blood that gushed from the\ncorpses over the sand.\n\n'Who,' said the Nazarene, 'calls upon the son of God?'\n\nNo answer came forth; and turning round, Olinthus beheld, by the light\nof the lamp, an old grey-headed man sitting on the floor, and supporting\nin his lap the head of one of the dead.  The features of the dead man\nwere firmly and rigidly locked in the last sleep; but over the lip there\nplayed a fierce smile--not the Christian's smile of hope, but the dark\nsneer of hatred and defiance.  Yet on the face still lingered the\nbeautiful roundness of early youth.  The hair curled thick and glossy\nover the unwrinkled brow; and the down of manhood but slightly shaded\nthe marble of the hueless cheek.  And over this face bent one of such\nunutterable sadness--of such yearning tenderness--of such fond and such\ndeep despair!  The tears of the old man fell fast and hot, but he did\nnot feel them; and when his lips moved, and he mechanically uttered the\nprayer of his benign and hopeful faith, neither his heart nor his sense\nresponded to the words: it was but the involuntary emotion that broke\nfrom the lethargy of his mind.  His boy was dead, and had died for\nhim!--and the old man's heart was broken!\n\n'Medon!' said Olinthus, pityingly, 'arise, and fly!  God is forth upon\nthe wings of the elements!  The New Gomorrah is doomed!--Fly, ere the\nfires consume thee!'\n\n'He was ever so full of life!--he cannot be dead!  Come hither!--place\nyour hand on his heart!--sure it beats yet?'\n\n'Brother, the soul has fled!  We will remember it in our prayers! Thou\ncanst not reanimate the dumb clay!  Come, come--hark! while I speak, yon\ncrashing walls!--hark! yon agonizing cries!  Not a moment is to be\nlost!--Come!'\n\n'I hear nothing!' said Medon, shaking his grey hair.  'The poor boy, his\nlove murdered him!'\n\n'Come! come! forgive this friendly force.'\n\n'What!  Who could sever the father from the son?' And Medon clasped the\nbody tightly in his embrace, and covered it with passionate kisses.\n'Go!' said he, lifting up his face for one moment.  'Go!--we must be\nalone!'\n\n'Alas!' said the compassionate Nazarene, 'Death hath severed ye\nalready!'\n\nThe old man smiled very calmly.  'No, no, no!' muttered, his voice\ngrowing lower with each word--'Death has been more kind!'\n\nWith that his head drooped on His son's breast--his arms relaxed their\ngrasp.  Olinthus caught him by the hand--the pulse had ceased to beat!\nThe last words of the father were the words of truth--Death had been\nmore kind!\n\nMeanwhile Glaucus and Nydia were pacing swiftly up the perilous and\nfearful streets.  The Athenian had learned from his preserver that Ione\nwas yet in the house of Arbaces.  Thither he fled, to release--to save\nher!  The few slaves whom the Egyptian had left at his mansion when he\nhad repaired in long procession to the amphitheatre, had been able to\noffer no resistance to the armed band of Sallust; and when afterwards\nthe volcano broke forth, they had huddled together, stunned and\nfrightened, in the inmost recesses of the house.  Even the tall\nEthiopian had forsaken his post at the door; and Glaucus (who left Nydia\nwithout--the poor Nydia, jealous once more, even in such an hour!)\npassed on through the vast hall without meeting one from whom to learn\nthe chamber of Ione.  Even as he passed, however, the darkness that\ncovered the heavens increased so rapidly that it was with difficulty he\ncould guide his steps.  The flower-wreathed columns seemed to reel and\ntremble; and with every instant he heard the ashes fall cranchingly into\nthe roofless peristyle.  He ascended to the upper rooms--breathless he\npaced along, shouting out aloud the name of Ione; and at length he\nheard, at the end of a gallery, a voice--her voice, in wondering reply!\nTo rush forward--to shatter the door--to seize Ione in his arms--to\nhurry from the mansion--seemed to him the work of an instant!  Scarce\nhad he gained the spot where Nydia was, than he heard steps advancing\ntowards the house, and recognized the voice of Arbaces, who had returned\nto seek his wealth and Ione ere he fled from the doomed Pompeii.  But so\ndense was already the reeking atmosphere, that the foes saw not each\nother, though so near--save that, dimly in the gloom, Glaucus caught the\nmoving outline of the snowy robes of the Egyptian.\n\nThey hastened onward--those three.  Alas! whither?  They now saw not a\nstep before them--the blackness became utter.  They were encompassed\nwith doubt and horror!--and the death he had escaped seemed to Glaucus\nonly to have changed its form and augmented its victims.\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nCALENUS AND BURBO.  DIOMED AND CLODIUS.  THE GIRL OF THE AMPHITHEATRE\nAND JULIA.\n\nTHE sudden catastrophe which had, as it were, riven the very bonds of\nsociety, and left prisoner and jailer alike free, had soon rid Calenus\nof the guards to whose care the praetor had consigned him.  And when the\ndarkness and the crowd separated the priest from his attendants, he\nhastened with trembling steps towards the temple of his goddess.  As he\ncrept along, and ere the darkness was complete, he felt himself suddenly\ncaught by the robe, and a voice muttered in his ear:\n\n'Hist!--Calenus!--an awful hour!'\n\n'Ay! by my father's head!  Who art thou?--thy face is dim, and thy voice\nis strange.\n\n'Not know thy Burbo?--fie!'\n\n'Gods!--how the darkness gathers!  Ho, ho!--by yon terrific mountain,\nwhat sudden blazes of lightning!'--How they dart and quiver! Hades is\nloosed on earth!'\n\n'Tush!--thou believest not these things, Calenus!  Now is the time to\nmake our fortune!'\n\n'Ha!'\n\n'Listen! Thy temple is full of gold and precious mummeries!--let us load\nourselves with them, and then hasten to the sea and embark! None will\never ask an account of the doings of this day.'\n\n'Burbo, thou art right!  Hush, and follow me into the temple.  Who cares\nnow--who sees now--whether thou art a priest or not?  Follow, and we\nwill share.'\n\nIn the precincts of the temple were many priests gathered around the\naltars, praying, weeping, grovelling in the dust.  Impostors in safety,\nthey were not the less superstitious in danger!  Calenus passed them,\nand entered the chamber yet to be seen in the south side of the court.\nBurbo followed him--the priest struck a light.  Wine and viands strewed\nthe table; the remains of a sacrificial feast.\n\n'A man who has hungered forty-eight hours,' muttered Calenus, 'has an\nappetite even in such a time.' He seized on the food, and devoured it\ngreedily.  Nothing could perhaps, be more unnaturally horrid than the\nselfish baseness of these villains; for there is nothing more loathsome\nthan the valor of avarice.  Plunder and sacrilege while the pillars of\nthe world tottered to and fro!  What an increase to the terrors of\nnature can be made by the vices of man!\n\n'Wilt thou never have done?' said Burbo, impatiently; 'thy face purples\nand thine eyes start already.'\n\n'It is not every day one has such a right to be hungry.  Oh, Jupiter!\nwhat sound is that?--the hissing of fiery water!  What! does the cloud\ngive rain as well as flame!  Ha!--what! shrieks?  And, Burbo, how silent\nall is now! Look forth!'\n\nAmidst the other horrors, the mighty mountain now cast up columns of\nboiling water.  Blent and kneaded with the half-burning ashes, the\nstreams fell like seething mud over the streets in frequent intervals.\nAnd full, where the priests of Isis had now cowered around the altars,\non which they had vainly sought to kindle fires and pour incense, one of\nthe fiercest of those deadly torrents, mingled with immense fragments of\nscoria, had poured its rage. Over the bended forms of the priests it\ndashed: that cry had been of death--that silence had been of eternity!\nThe ashes--the pitchy streams--sprinkled the altars, covered the\npavement, and half concealed the quivering corpses of the priests!\n\n'They are dead,' said Burbo, terrified for the first time, and hurrying\nback into the cell.  'I thought not the danger was so near and fatal.'\n\nThe two wretches stood staring at each other--you might have heard their\nhearts beat!  Calenus, the less bold by nature, but the more griping,\nrecovered first.\n\n'We must to our task, and away!' he said, in a low whisper, frightened\nat his own voice.  He stepped to the threshold, paused, crossed over the\nheated floor and his dead brethren to the sacred chapel, and called to\nBurbo to follow.  But the gladiator quaked, and drew back.\n\n'So much the better,' thought Calenus; 'the more will be my booty.'\nHastily he loaded himself with the more portable treasures of the\ntemple; and thinking no more of his comrade, hurried from the sacred\nplace.  A sudden flash of lightning from the mount showed to Burbo, who\nstood motionless at the threshold, the flying and laden form of the\npriest.  He took heart; he stepped forth to join him, when a tremendous\nshower of ashes fell right before his feet.  The gladiator shrank back\nonce more.  Darkness closed him in.  But the shower continued\nfast--fast; its heaps rose high and suffocatingly--deathly vapors\nsteamed from them.  The wretch gasped for breath--he sought in despair\nagain to fly--the ashes had blocked up the threshold--he shrieked as his\nfeet shrank from the boiling fluid. How could he escape? he could not\nclimb to the open space; nay, were he able, he could not brave its\nhorrors.  It were best to remain in the cells, protected, at least, from\nthe fatal air. He sat down and clenched his teeth.  By degrees, the\natmosphere from without--stifling and venomous--crept into the chamber.\nHe could endure it no longer.  His eyes, glaring round, rested on a\nsacrificial axe, which some priest had left in the chamber: he seized\nit. With the desperate strength of his gigantic arm, he attempted to hew\nhis way through the walls.\n\nMeanwhile, the streets were already thinned; the crowd had hastened to\ndisperse itself under shelter; the ashes began to fill up the lower\nparts of the town; but, here and there, you heard the steps of fugitives\ncranching them warily, or saw their pale and haggard faces by the blue\nglare of the lightning, or the more unsteady glare of torches, by which\nthey endeavored to steer their steps. But ever and anon, the boiling\nwater, or the straggling ashes, mysterious and gusty winds, rising and\ndying in a breath, extinguished these wandering lights, and with them\nthe last living hope of those who bore them.\n\nIn the street that leads to the gate of Herculaneum, Clodius now bent\nhis perplexed and doubtful way.  'If I can gain the open country,'\nthought he, 'doubtless there will be various vehicles beyond the gate,\nand Herculaneum is not far distant.  Thank Mercury!  I have little to\nlose, and that little is about me!'\n\n'Holla!--help there--help!' cried a querulous and frightened voice.  'I\nhave fallen down--my torch has gone out--my slaves have deserted me.  I\nam Diomed--the rich Diomed--ten thousand sesterces to him who helps me!'\n\nAt the same moment, Clodius felt himself caught by the feet. 'Ill\nfortune to thee--let me go, fool,' said the gambler.\n\n'Oh, help me up!--give me thy hand!'\n\n'There--rise!'\n\n'Is this Clodius?  I know the voice!  Whither fliest thou?'\n\n'Towards Herculaneum.'\n\n'Blessed be the gods! our way is the same, then, as far as the gate.\nWhy not take refuge in my villa?  Thou knowest the long range of\nsubterranean cellars beneath the basement--that shelter, what shower can\npenetrate?'\n\n'You speak well,' said Clodius musingly.  'And by storing the cellar\nwith food, we can remain there even some days, should these wondrous\nstorms endure so long.'\n\n'Oh, blessed be he who invented gates to a city!' cried Diomed.\n'See!--they have placed a light within yon arch: by that let us guide\nour steps.'\n\nThe air was now still for a few minutes: the lamp from the gate streamed\nout far and clear: the fugitives hurried on--they gained the gate--they\npassed by the Roman sentry; the lightning flashed over his livid face\nand polished helmet, but his stern features were composed even in their\nawe!  He remained erect and motionless at his post.  That hour itself\nhad not animated the machine of the ruthless majesty of Rome into the\nreasoning and self-acting man.  There he stood, amidst the crashing\nelements: he had not received the permission to desert his station and\nescape.\n\nDiomed and his companion hurried on, when suddenly a female form rushed\nathwart their way.  It was the girl whose ominous voice had been raised\nso often and so gladly in anticipation of 'the merry show'.\n\n'Oh, Diomed!' she cried, 'shelter! shelter!  See'--pointing to an infant\nclasped to her breast--'see this little one!--it is mine!--the child of\nshame!  I have never owned it till this hour.  But now I remember I am a\nmother!  I have plucked it from the cradle of its nurse: she had fled!\nWho could think of the babe in such an hour, but she who bore it?  Save\nit! save it!'\n\n'Curses on thy shrill voice!  Away, harlot!' muttered Clodius between\nhis ground teeth.\n\n'Nay, girl,' said the more humane Diomed; 'follow if thou wilt. This\nway--this way--to the vaults!'\n\nThey hurried on--they arrived at the house of Diomed--they laughed aloud\nas they crossed the threshold, for they deemed the danger over.\n\nDiomed ordered his slaves to carry down into the subterranean gallery,\nbefore described, a profusion of food and oil for lights; and there\nJulia, Clodius, the mother and her babe, the greater part of the slaves,\nand some frightened visitors and clients of the neighborhood, sought\ntheir shelter.\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nTHE PROGRESS OF THE DESTRUCTION.\n\nTHE cloud, which had scattered so deep a murkiness over the day, had now\nsettled into a solid and impenetrable mass.  It resembled less even the\nthickest gloom of a night in the open air than the close and blind\ndarkness of some narrow room.  But in proportion as the blackness\ngathered, did the lightnings around Vesuvius increase in their vivid and\nscorching glare.  Nor was their horrible beauty confined to the usual\nhues of fire; no rainbow ever rivalled their varying and prodigal dyes.\nNow brightly blue as the most azure depth of a southern sky--now of a\nlivid and snakelike green, darting restlessly to and fro as the folds of\nan enormous serpent--now of a lurid and intolerable crimson, gushing\nforth through the columns of smoke, far and wide, and lighting up the\nwhole city from arch to arch--then suddenly dying into a sickly\npaleness, like the ghost of their own life!\n\nIn the pauses of the showers, you heard the rumbling of the earth\nbeneath, and the groaning waves of the tortured sea; or, lower still,\nand audible but to the watch of intensest fear, the grinding and hissing\nmurmur of the escaping gases through the chasms of the distant mountain.\nSometimes the cloud appeared to break from its solid mass, and, by the\nlightning, to assume quaint and vast mimicries of human or of monster\nshapes, striding across the gloom, hurtling one upon the other, and\nvanishing swiftly into the turbulent abyss of shade; so that, to the\neyes and fancies of the affrighted wanderers, the unsubstantial vapors\nwere as the bodily forms of gigantic foes--the agents of terror and of\ndeath.\n\nThe ashes in many places were already knee-deep; and the boiling showers\nwhich came from the steaming breath of the volcano forced their way into\nthe houses, bearing with them a strong and suffocating vapor.  In some\nplaces, immense fragments of rock, hurled upon the house roofs, bore\ndown along the streets masses of confused ruin, which yet more and more,\nwith every hour, obstructed the way; and, as the day advanced, the\nmotion of the earth was more sensibly felt--the footing seemed to slide\nand creep--nor could chariot or litter be kept steady, even on the most\nlevel ground.\n\nSometimes the huger stones striking against each other as they fell,\nbroke into countless fragments, emitting sparks of fire, which caught\nwhatever was combustible within their reach; and along the plains beyond\nthe city the darkness was now terribly relieved; for several houses, and\neven vineyards, had been set on flames; and at various intervals the\nfires rose suddenly and fiercely against the solid gloom.  To add to\nthis partial relief of the darkness, the citizens had, here and there,\nin the more public places, such as the porticoes of temples and the\nentrances to the forum, endeavored to place rows of torches; but these\nrarely continued long; the showers and the winds extinguished them, and\nthe sudden darkness into which their sudden birth was converted had\nsomething in it doubly terrible and doubly impressing on the impotence\nof human hopes, the lesson of despair.\n\nFrequently, by the momentary light of these torches, parties of\nfugitives encountered each other, some hurrying towards the sea, others\nflying from the sea back to the land; for the ocean had retreated\nrapidly from the shore--an utter darkness lay over it, and upon its\ngroaning and tossing waves the storm of cinders and rock fell without\nthe protection which the streets and roofs afforded to the land.\nWild--haggard--ghastly with supernatural fears, these groups encountered\neach other, but without the leisure to speak, to consult, to advise; for\nthe showers fell now frequently, though not continuously, extinguishing\nthe lights, which showed to each band the deathlike faces of the other,\nand hurrying all to seek refuge beneath the nearest shelter.  The whole\nelements of civilization were broken up.  Ever and anon, by the\nflickering lights, you saw the thief hastening by the most solemn\nauthorities of the law, laden with, and fearfully chuckling over, the\nproduce of his sudden gains.  If, in the darkness, wife was separated\nfrom husband, or parent from child, vain was the hope of reunion.  Each\nhurried blindly and confusedly on.  Nothing in all the various and\ncomplicated machinery of social life was left save the primal law of\nself-preservation!\n\nThrough this awful scene did the Athenian wade his way, accompanied by\nIone and the blind girl.  Suddenly, a rush of hundreds, in their path to\nthe sea, swept by them.  Nydia was torn from the side of Glaucus, who,\nwith Ione, was borne rapidly onward; and when the crowd (whose forms\nthey saw not, so thick was the gloom) were gone, Nydia was still\nseparated from their side. Glaucus shouted her name.  No answer came.\nThey retraced their steps--in vain: they could not discover her--it was\nevident she had been swept along some opposite direction by the human\ncurrent.  Their friend, their preserver, was lost!  And hitherto Nydia\nhad been their guide.  Her blindness rendered the scene familiar to her\nalone.  Accustomed, through a perpetual night, to thread the windings of\nthe city, she had led them unerringly towards the sea-shore, by which\nthey had resolved to hazard an escape.  Now, which way could they wend?\nall was rayless to them--a maze without a clue.  Wearied, despondent,\nbewildered, they, however, passed along, the ashes falling upon their\nheads, the fragmentary stones dashing up in sparkles before their feet.\n\n'Alas! alas!' murmured Ione, 'I can go no farther; my steps sink among\nthe scorching cinders.  Fly, dearest!--beloved, fly! and leave me to my\nfate!'\n\n'Hush, my betrothed! my bride!  Death with thee is sweeter than life\nwithout thee!  Yet, whither--oh! whither, can we direct ourselves\nthrough the gloom? Already it seems that we have made but a circle, and\nare in the very spot which we quitted an hour ago.'\n\n'O gods! yon rock--see, it hath riven the roof before us!  It is death\nto move through the streets!'\n\n'Blessed lightning!  See, Ione--see! the portico of the Temple of\nFortune is before us.  Let us creep beneath it; it will protect us from\nthe showers.'\n\nHe caught his beloved in his arms, and with difficulty and labor gained\nthe temple.  He bore her to the remoter and more sheltered part of the\nportico, and leaned over her, that he might shield her, with his own\nform, from the lightning and the showers!  The beauty and the\nunselfishness of love could hallow even that dismal time!\n\n'Who is there?' said the trembling and hollow voice of one who had\npreceded them in their place of refuge.  'Yet, what matters?--the crush\nof the ruined world forbids to us friends or foes.'\n\nIone turned at the sound of the voice, and, with a faint shriek, cowered\nagain beneath the arms of Glaucus: and he, looking in the direction of\nthe voice, beheld the cause of her alarm.  Through the darkness glared\nforth two burning eyes--the lightning flashed and lingered athwart the\ntemple--and Glaucus, with a shudder, perceived the lion to which he had\nbeen doomed couched beneath the pillars--and, close beside it, unwitting\nof the vicinity, lay the giant form of him who had accosted them--the\nwounded gladiator, Niger.\n\nThat lightning had revealed to each other the form of beast and man; yet\nthe instinct of both was quelled.  Nay, the lion crept nearer and nearer\nto the gladiator, as for companionship; and the gladiator did not recede\nor tremble.  The revolution of Nature had dissolved her lighter terrors\nas well as her wonted ties.\n\nWhile they were thus terribly protected, a group of men and women,\nbearing torches, passed by the temple.  They were of the congregation of\nthe Nazarenes; and a sublime and unearthly emotion had not, indeed,\nquelled their awe, but it had robbed awe of fear.  They had long\nbelieved, according to the error of the early Christians, that the Last\nDay was at hand; they imagined now that the Day had come.\n\n'Woe! woe!' cried, in a shrill and piercing voice, the elder at their\nhead. 'Behold! the Lord descendeth to judgment!  He maketh fire come\ndown from heaven in the sight of men!  Woe! woe! ye strong and mighty!\nWoe to ye of the fasces and the purple!  Woe to the idolater and the\nworshipper of the beast!  Woe to ye who pour forth the blood of saints,\nand gloat over the death-pangs of the sons of God!  Woe to the harlot of\nthe sea!--woe! woe!'\n\nAnd with a loud and deep chorus, the troop chanted forth along the wild\nhorrors of the air, 'Woe to the harlot of the sea!--woe! woe!'\n\nThe Nazarenes paced slowly on, their torches still flickering in the\nstorm, their voices still raised in menace and solemn warning, till,\nlost amid the windings in the streets, the darkness of the atmosphere\nand the silence of death again fell over the scene.\n\nThere was one of the frequent pauses in the showers, and Glaucus\nencouraged Ione once more to proceed.  Just as they stood, hesitating,\non the last step of the portico, an old man, with a bag in his right\nhand and leaning upon a youth, tottered by.  The youth bore a torch.\nGlaucus recognized the two as father and son--miser and prodigal.\n\n'Father,' said the youth, 'if you cannot move more swiftly, I must leave\nyou, or we both perish!'\n\n'Fly, boy, then, and leave thy sire!'\n\n'But I cannot fly to starve; give me thy bag of gold!' And the youth\nsnatched at it.\n\n'Wretch! wouldst thou rob thy father?'\n\n'Ay! who can tell the tale in this hour?  Miser, perish!'\n\nThe boy struck the old man to the ground, plucked the bag from his\nrelaxing hand, and fled onward with a shrill yell.\n\n'Ye gods!' cried Glaucus: 'are ye blind, then, even in the dark? Such\ncrimes may well confound the guiltless with the guilty in one common\nruin.  Ione, on!--on!'\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nARBACES ENCOUNTERS GLAUCUS AND IONE.\n\nADVANCING, as men grope for escape in a dungeon, Ione and her lover\ncontinued their uncertain way.  At the moments when the volcanic\nlightnings lingered over the streets, they were enabled, by that awful\nlight, to steer and guide their progress: yet, little did the view it\npresented to them cheer or encourage their path.  In parts, where the\nashes lay dry and uncommixed with the boiling torrents, cast upward from\nthe mountain at capricious intervals, the surface of the earth presented\na leprous and ghastly white.  In other places, cinder and rock lay\nmatted in heaps, from beneath which emerged the half-hid limbs of some\ncrushed and mangled fugitive.  The groans of the dying were broken by\nwild shrieks of women's terror--now near, now distant--which, when heard\nin the utter darkness, were rendered doubly appalling by the crushing\nsense of helplessness and the uncertainty of the perils around; and\nclear and distinct through all were the mighty and various noises from\nthe Fatal Mountain; its rushing winds; its whirling torrents; and, from\ntime to time, the burst and roar of some more fiery and fierce\nexplosion.  And ever as the winds swept howling along the street, they\nbore sharp streams of burning dust, and such sickening and poisonous\nvapors, as took away, for the instant, breath and consciousness,\nfollowed by a rapid revulsion of the arrested blood, and a tingling\nsensation of agony trembling through every nerve and fibre of the frame.\n\n'Oh, Glaucus! my beloved! my own!--take me to thy arms!  One embrace!\nlet me feel thy arms around me--and in that embrace let me die--I can no\nmore!'\n\n'For my sake, for my life--courage, yet, sweet Ione--my life is linked\nwith thine: and see--torches--this way!  Lo! how they brave the Wind!\nHa! they live through the storm--doubtless, fugitives to the sea! we\nwill join them.'\n\nAs if to aid and reanimate the lovers, the winds and showers came to a\nsudden pause; the atmosphere was profoundly still--the mountain seemed\nat rest, gathering, perhaps, fresh fury for its next burst; the\ntorch-bearers moved quickly on.  'We are nearing the sea,' said, in a\ncalm voice, the person at their head.  'Liberty and wealth to each slave\nwho survives this day!  Courage!  I tell you that the gods themselves\nhave assured me of deliverance.  On!'\n\nRedly and steadily the torches flashed full on the eyes of Glaucus and\nIone, who lay trembling and exhausted on his bosom.  Several slaves were\nbearing, by the light, panniers and coffers, heavily laden; in front of\nthem--a drawn sword in his hand--towered the lofty form of Arbaces.\n\n'By my fathers!' cried the Egyptian, 'Fate smiles upon me even through\nthese horrors, and, amidst the dreadest aspects of woe and death, bodes\nme happiness and love.  Away, Greek!  I claim my ward, Ione!'\n\n'Traitor and murderer!' cried Glaucus, glaring upon his foe, 'Nemesis\nhath guided thee to my revenge!--a just sacrifice to the shades of\nHades, that now seem loosed on earth.  Approach--touch but the hand of\nIone, and thy weapon shall be as a reed--I will tear thee limb from\nlimb!'\n\nSuddenly, as he spoke, the place became lighted with an intense and\nlurid glow.  Bright and gigantic through the darkness, which closed\naround it like the walls of hell, the mountain shone--a pile of fire!\nIts summit seemed riven in two; or rather, above its surface there\nseemed to rise two monster shapes, each confronting each, as Demons\ncontending for a world.  These were of one deep blood-red hue of fire,\nwhich lighted up the whole atmosphere far and wide; but, below, the\nnether part of the mountain was still dark and shrouded, save in three\nplaces, adown which flowed, serpentine and irregular, rivers of the\nmolten lava.  Darkly red through the profound gloom of their banks, they\nflowed slowly on, as towards the devoted city. Over the broadest there\nseemed to spring a cragged and stupendous arch, from which, as from the\njaws of hell, gushed the sources of the sudden Phlegethon.  And through\nthe stilled air was heard the rattling of the fragments of rock,\nhurtling one upon another as they were borne down the fiery\ncataracts--darkening, for one instant, the spot where they fell, and\nsuffused the next, in the burnished hues of the flood along which they\nfloated!\n\nThe slaves shrieked aloud, and, cowering, hid their faces.  The Egyptian\nhimself stood transfixed to the spot, the glow lighting up his\ncommanding features and jewelled robes.  High behind him rose a tall\ncolumn that supported the bronze statue of Augustus; and the imperial\nimage seemed changed to a shape of fire!\n\nWith his left hand circled round the form of Ione--with his right arm\nraised in menace, and grasping the stilus which was to have been his\nweapon in the arena, and which he still fortunately bore about him, with\nhis brow knit, his lips apart, the wrath and menace of human passions\narrested as by a charm, upon his features, Glaucus fronted the Egyptian!\n\nArbaces turned his eyes from the mountain--they rested on the form of\nGlaucus!  He paused a moment: 'Why,' he muttered, 'should I hesitate?\nDid not the stars foretell the only crisis of imminent peril to which I\nwas subjected?--Is not that peril past?'\n\n'The soul,' cried he aloud, 'can brave the wreck of worlds and the wrath\nof imaginary gods!  By that soul will I conquer to the last! Advance,\nslaves!--Athenian, resist me, and thy blood be on thine own head!  Thus,\nthen, I regain Ione!'\n\nHe advanced one step--it was his last on earth!  The ground shook\nbeneath him with a convulsion that cast all around upon its surface.  A\nsimultaneous crash resounded through the city, as down toppled many a\nroof and pillar!--the lightning, as if caught by the metal, lingered an\ninstant on the Imperial Statue--then shivered bronze and column! Down\nfell the ruin, echoing along the street, and riving the solid pavement\nwhere it crashed!--The prophecy of the stars was fulfilled!\n\nThe sound--the shock, stunned the Athenian for several moments. When he\nrecovered, the light still illuminated the scene--the earth still slid\nand trembled beneath!  Ione lay senseless on the ground; but he saw her\nnot yet--his eyes were fixed upon a ghastly face that seemed to emerge,\nwithout limbs or trunk, from the huge fragments of the shattered\ncolumn--a face of unutterable pain, agony, and despair!  The eyes shut\nand opened rapidly, as if sense were not yet fled; the lips quivered and\ngrinned--then sudden stillness and darkness fell over the features, yet\nretaining that aspect of horror never to be forgotten!\n\nSo perished the wise Magician--the great Arbaces--the Hermes of the\nBurning Belt--the last of the royalty of Egypt!\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nTHE DESPAIR OF THE LOVERS.  THE CONDITION OF THE MULTITUDE.\n\nGLAUCUS turned in gratitude but in awe, caught Ione once more in his\narms, and fled along the street, that was yet intensely luminous.  But\nsuddenly a duller shade fell over the air.  Instinctively he turned to\nthe mountain, and beheld! one of the two gigantic crests, into which the\nsummit had been divided, rocked and wavered to and fro; and then, with a\nsound, the mightiness of which no language can describe, it fell from\nits burning base, and rushed, an avalanche of fire, down the sides of\nthe mountain!  At the same instant gushed forth a volume of blackest\nsmoke--rolling on, over air, sea, and earth.\n\nAnother--and another--and another shower of ashes, far more profuse than\nbefore, scattered fresh desolation along the streets. Darkness once more\nwrapped them as a veil; and Glaucus, his bold heart at last quelled and\ndespairing, sank beneath the cover of an arch, and, clasping Ione to his\nheart--a bride on that couch of ruin--resigned himself to die.\n\nMeanwhile Nydia, when separated by the throng from Glaucus and Ione, had\nin vain endeavored to regain them.  In vain she raised that plaintive\ncry so peculiar to the blind; it was lost amidst a thousand shrieks of\nmore selfish terror.  Again and again she returned to the spot where\nthey had been divided--to find her companions gone, to seize every\nfugitive--to inquire of Glaucus--to be dashed aside in the impatience of\ndistraction.  Who in that hour spared one thought to his neighbor?\nPerhaps in scenes of universal horror, nothing is more horrid than the\nunnatural selfishness they engender. At length it occurred to Nydia,\nthat as it had been resolved to seek the sea-shore for escape, her most\nprobable chance of rejoining her companions would be to persevere in\nthat direction.  Guiding her steps, then, by the staff which she always\ncarried, she continued, with incredible dexterity, to avoid the masses\nof ruin that encumbered the path--to thread the streets--and unerringly\n(so blessed now was that accustomed darkness, so afflicting in ordinary\nlife!) to take the nearest direction to the sea-side.\n\nPoor girl!--her courage was beautiful to behold!--and Fate seemed to\nfavor one so helpless!  The boiling torrents touched her not, save by\nthe general rain which accompanied them; the huge fragments of scoria\nshivered the pavement before and beside her, but spared that frail form:\nand when the lesser ashes fell over her, she shook them away with a\nslight tremor, and dauntlessly resumed her course.\n\nWeak, exposed, yet fearless, supported but by one wish, she was a very\nemblem of Psyche in her wanderings; of Hope, walking through the Valley\nof the Shadow; of the Soul itself--lone but undaunted, amidst the\ndangers and the snares of life!\n\nHer path was, however, constantly impeded by the crowds that now groped\namidst the gloom, now fled in the temporary glare of the lightnings\nacross the scene; and, at length, a group of torch-bearers rushing full\nagainst her, she was thrown down with some violence.\n\n'What!' said the voice of one of the party, 'is this the brave blind\ngirl! By Bacchus, she must not be left here to die!  Up, my Thessalian!\nSo--so. Are you hurt?  That's well!  Come along with us! we are for the\nshore!'\n\n'O Sallust! it is thy voice!  The gods be thanked!  Glaucus! Glaucus!\nGlaucus! have ye seen him?'\n\n'Not I.  He is doubtless out of the city by this time.  The gods who\nsaved him from the lion will save him from the burning mountain.'\n\nAs the kindly epicure thus encouraged Nydia, he drew her along with him\ntowards the sea, heeding not her passionate entreaties that he would\nlinger yet awhile to search for Glaucus; and still, in the accent of\ndespair, she continued to shriek out that beloved name, which, amidst\nall the roar of the convulsed elements, kept alive a music at her heart.\n\nThe sudden illumination, the bursts of the floods of lava, and the\nearthquake, which we have already described, chanced when Sallust and\nhis party had just gained the direct path leading from the city to the\nport; and here they were arrested by an immense crowd, more than half\nthe population of the city.  They spread along the field without the\nwalls, thousands upon thousands, uncertain whither to fly.  The sea had\nretired far from the shore; and they who had fled to it had been so\nterrified by the agitation and preternatural shrinking of the element,\nthe gasping forms of the uncouth sea things which the waves had left\nupon the sand, and by the sound of the huge stones cast from the\nmountain into the deep, that they had returned again to the land, as\npresenting the less frightful aspect of the two.  Thus the two streams\nof human beings, the one seaward, the other from the sea, had met\ntogether, feeling a sad comfort in numbers; arrested in despair and\ndoubt.\n\n'The world is to be destroyed by fire,' said an old man in long loose\nrobes, a philosopher of the Stoic school: 'Stoic and Epicurean wisdom\nhave alike agreed in this prediction: and the hour is come!'\n\n'Yea; the hour is come!' cried a loud voice, solemn, but not fearful.\n\nThose around turned in dismay.  The voice came from above them. It was\nthe voice of Olinthus, who, surrounded by his Christian friends, stood\nupon an abrupt eminence on which the old Greek colonists had raised a\ntemple to Apollo, now timeworn and half in ruin.\n\nAs he spoke there came that sudden illumination which had heralded the\ndeath of Arbaces, and glowing over that mighty multitude, awed,\ncrouching, breathless--never on earth had the faces of men seemed so\nhaggard!--never had meeting of mortal beings been so stamped with the\nhorror and sublimity of dread!--never till the last trumpet sounds,\nshall such meeting be seen again!  And above those the form of Olinthus,\nwith outstretched arm and prophet brow, girt with the living fires.  And\nthe crowd knew the face of him they had doomed to the fangs of the\nbeast--then their victim--now their warner! and through the stillness\nagain came his ominous voice:\n\n'The hour is come!'\n\nThe Christians repeated the cry.  It was caught up--it was echoed from\nside to side--woman and man, childhood and old age, repeated, not aloud,\nbut in a smothered and dreary murmur:\n\n'THE HOUR IS COME!'\n\nAt that moment, a wild yell burst through the air--and, thinking only of\nescape, whither it knew not, the terrible tiger of the desert leaped\namongst the throng, and hurried through its parted streams.  And so came\nthe earthquake--and so darkness once more fell over the earth!\n\nAnd now new fugitives arrived.  Grasping the treasures no longer\ndestined for their lord, the slaves of Arbaces joined the throng. One\nonly of all their torches yet flickered on.  It was borne by Sosia; and\nits light falling on the face of Nydia, he recognized the Thessalian.\n\n'What avails thy liberty now, blind girl?' said the slave.\n\n'Who art thou? canst thou tell me of Glaucus?'\n\n'Ay; I saw him but a few minutes since.'\n\n'Blessed be thy head! where?'\n\n'Crouched beneath the arch of the forum--dead or dying!--gone to rejoin\nArbaces, who is no more!'\n\nNydia uttered not a word, she slid from the side of Sallust; silently\nshe glided through those behind her, and retraced her steps to the city.\nShe gained the forum--the arch; she stooped down--she felt around--she\ncalled on the name of Glaucus.\n\nA weak voice answered--'Who calls on me?  Is it the voice of the Shades?\nLo! I am prepared!'\n\n'Arise! follow me!  Take my hand! Glaucus, thou shalt be saved!'\n\nIn wonder and sudden hope, Glaucus arose--'Nydia still?  Ah! thou, then,\nart safe!'\n\nThe tender joy of his voice pierced the heart of the poor Thessalian,\nand she blessed him for his thought of her.\n\nHalf leading, half carrying Ione, Glaucus followed his guide.  With\nadmirable discretion, she avoided the path which led to the crowd she\nhad just quitted, and, by another route, sought the shore.\n\nAfter many pauses and incredible perseverance, they gained the sea, and\njoined a group, who, bolder than the rest, resolved to hazard any peril\nrather than continue in such a scene.  In darkness they put forth to\nsea; but, as they cleared the land and caught new aspects of the\nmountain, its channels of molten fire threw a partial redness over the\nwaves.\n\nUtterly exhausted and worn out, Ione slept on the breast of Glaucus, and\nNydia lay at his feet.  Meanwhile the showers of dust and ashes, still\nborne aloft, fell into the wave, and scattered their snows over the\ndeck.  Far and wide, borne by the winds, those showers descended upon\nthe remotest climes, startling even the swarthy African; and whirled\nalong the antique soil of Syria and of Egypt (Dion Cassius).\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nTHE NEXT MORNING.  THE FATE OF NYDIA.\n\nAND meekly, softly, beautifully, dawned at last the light over the\ntrembling deep!--the winds were sinking into rest--the foam died from\nthe glowing azure of that delicious sea.  Around the east, thin mists\ncaught gradually the rosy hues that heralded the morning; Light was\nabout to resume her reign.  Yet, still, dark and massive in the\ndistance, lay the broken fragments of the destroying cloud, from which\nred streaks, burning dimlier and more dim, betrayed the yet rolling\nfires of the mountain of the 'Scorched Fields'.  The white walls and\ngleaming columns that had adorned the lovely coasts were no more.\nSullen and dull were the shores so lately crested by the cities of\nHerculaneum and Pompeii.  The darlings of the deep were snatched from\nher embrace!  Century after century shall the mighty Mother stretch\nforth her azure arms, and know them not--moaning round the sepulchres of\nthe Lost!\n\nThere was no shout from the mariners at the dawning light--it had come\ntoo gradually, and they were too wearied for such sudden bursts of\njoy--but there was a low, deep murmur of thankfulness amidst those\nwatchers of the long night.  They looked at each other and smiled--they\ntook heart--they felt once more that there was a world around, and a God\nabove them!  And in the feeling that the worst was passed, the\noverwearied ones turned round, and fell placidly to sleep. In the\ngrowing light of the skies there came the silence which night had\nwanted: and the bark drifted calmly onward to its port.  A few other\nvessels, bearing similar fugitives, might be seen in the expanse,\napparently motionless, yet gliding also on.  There was a sense of\nsecurity, of companionship, and of hope, in the sight of their slender\nmasts and white sails.  What beloved friends, lost and missed in the\ngloom, might they not bear to safety and to shelter!\n\nIn the silence of the general sleep, Nydia rose gently.  She bent over\nthe face of Glaucus--she inhaled the deep breath of his heavy\nslumber--timidly and sadly she kissed his brow--his lips; she felt for\nhis hand--it was locked in that of Ione; she sighed deeply, and her face\ndarkened. Again she kissed his brow, and with her hair wiped from it the\ndamps of night.  'May the gods bless you, Athenian!' she murmured: 'may\nyou be happy with your beloved one!--may you sometimes remember Nydia!\nAlas! she is of no further use on earth!'\n\nWith these words she turned away.  Slowly she crept along by the fori,\nor platforms, to the farther side of the vessel, and, pausing, bent low\nover the deep; the cool spray dashed upward on her feverish brow.  'It\nis the kiss of death,' she said 'it is welcome.' The balmy air played\nthrough her waving tresses--she put them from her face, and raised those\neyes--so tender, though so lightless--to the sky, whose soft face she\nhad never seen!\n\n'No, no!' she said, half aloud, and in a musing and thoughtful tone, 'I\ncannot endure it; this jealous, exacting love--it shatters my whole soul\nin madness!  I might harm him again--wretch that I was!  I have saved\nhim--twice saved him--happy, happy thought: why not die happy?--it is\nthe last glad thought I can ever know.  Oh! sacred Sea!  I hear thy\nvoice invitingly--it hath a freshening and joyous call. They say that in\nthy embrace is dishonour--that thy victims cross not the fatal Styx--be\nit so!--I would not meet him in the Shades, for I should meet him still\nwith her!  Rest--rest--rest! there is no other Elysium for a heart like\nmine!'\n\nA sailor, half dozing on the deck, heard a slight splash on the waters.\nDrowsily he looked up, and behind, as the vessel merrily bounded on, he\nfancied he saw something white above the waves; but it vanished in an\ninstant.  He turned round again, and dreamed of his home and children.\n\nWhen the lovers awoke, their first thought was of each other--their next\nof Nydia!  She was not to be found--none had seen her since the night.\nEvery crevice of the vessel was searched--there was no trace of her.\nMysterious from first to last, the blind Thessalian had vanished for\never from the living world!  They guessed her fate in silence: and\nGlaucus and Ione, while they drew nearer to each other (feeling each\nother the world itself), forgot their deliverance, and wept as for a\ndeparted sister.\n\n\n\nChapter The Last\n\nWHEREIN ALL THINGS CEASE LETTER FROM GLAUCUS TO SALLUST, TEN YEARS AFTER\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII.\n\n'Athens.\n\nGLAUCUS to his beloved Sallust--greeting and health!--You request me to\nvisit you at Rome--no, Sallust, come rather to me at Athens!  I have\nforsworn the Imperial City, its mighty tumult and hollow joys.  In my\nown land henceforth I dwell for ever.  The ghost of our departed\ngreatness is dearer to me than the gaudy life of your loud prosperity.\nThere is a charm to me which no other spot can supply, in the porticoes\nhallowed still by holy and venerable shades.  In the olive-groves of\nIlyssus I still hear the voice of poetry--on the heights of Phyle, the\nclouds of twilight seem yet the shrouds of departed freedom--the\nheralds--the heralds--of the morrow that shall come!  You smile at my\nenthusiasm, Sallust!--better be hopeful in chains than resigned to their\nglitter.  You tell me you are sure that I cannot enjoy life in these\nmelancholy haunts of a fallen majesty.  You dwell with rapture on the\nRoman splendors, and the luxuries of the imperial court. My\nSallust--\"non sum qualis eram\"--I am not what I was!  The events of my\nlife have sobered the bounding blood of my youth.  My health has never\nquite recovered its wonted elasticity ere it felt the pangs of disease,\nand languished in the damps of a criminal's dungeon.  My mind has never\nshaken off the dark shadow of the Last Day of Pompeii--the horror and\nthe desolation of that awful ruin!--Our beloved, our remembered Nydia! I\nhave reared a tomb to her shade, and I see it every day from the window\nof my study. It keeps alive in me a tender recollection--a not\nunpleasing sadness--which are but a fitting homage to her fidelity, and\nthe mysteriousness of her early death.  Ione gathers the flowers, but my\nown hand wreathes them daily around the tomb.  She was worthy of a tomb\nin Athens!\n\n'You speak of the growing sect of the Christians in Rome.  Sallust, to\nyou I may confide my secret; I have pondered much over that faith--I\nhave adopted it.  After the destruction of Pompeii, I met once more with\nOlinthus--saved, alas! only for a day, and falling afterwards a martyr\nto the indomitable energy of his zeal.  In my preservation from the lion\nand the earthquake he taught me to behold the hand of the unknown God!\nI listened--believed--adored!  My own, my more than ever beloved Ione,\nhas also embraced the creed!--a creed, Sallust, which, shedding light\nover this world, gathers its concentrated glory, like a sunset, over the\nnext!  We know that we are united in the soul, as in the flesh, for ever\nand for ever! Ages may roll on, our very dust be dissolved, the earth\nshrivelled like a scroll; but round and round the circle of eternity\nrolls the wheel of life--imperishable--unceasing!  And as the earth from\nthe sun, so immortality drinks happiness from virtue, which is the smile\nupon the face of God!  Visit me, then, Sallust; bring with you the\nlearned scrolls of Epicurus, Pythagoras, Diogenes; arm yourself for\ndefeat; and let us, amidst the groves of Academus, dispute, under a\nsurer guide than any granted to our fathers, on the mighty problem of\nthe true ends of life and the nature of the soul.\n\n'Ione--at that name my heart yet beats!--Ione is by my side as I write:\nI lift my eyes, and meet her smile.  The sunlight quivers over Hymettus:\nand along my garden I hear the hum of the summer bees.  Am I happy, ask\nyou? Oh, what can Rome give me equal to what I possess at Athens?  Here,\neverything awakens the soul and inspires the affections--the trees, the\nwaters, the hills, the skies, are those of Athens!--fair, though\nmourning-mother of the Poetry and the Wisdom of the World.  In my hall I\nsee the marble faces of my ancestors.  In the Ceramicus, I survey their\ntombs! In the streets, I behold the hand of Phidias and the soul of\nPericles. Harmodius, Aristogiton--they are everywhere--but in our\nhearts!--in mine, at least, they shall not perish!  If anything can make\nme forget that I am an Athenian and not free, it is partly the\nsoothing--the love--watchful, vivid, sleepless--of Ione--a love that has\ntaken a new sentiment in our new creed--a love which none of our poets,\nbeautiful though they be, had shadowed forth in description; for mingled\nwith religion, it partakes of religion; it is blended with pure and\nunworldly thoughts; it is that which we may hope to carry through\neternity, and keep, therefore, white and unsullied, that we may not\nblush to confess it to our God!  This is the true type of the dark fable\nof our Grecian Eros and Psyche--it is, in truth, the soul asleep in the\narms of love.  And if this, our love, support me partly against the\nfever of the desire for freedom, my religion supports me more; for\nwhenever I would grasp the sword and sound the shell, and rush to a new\nMarathon (but Marathon without victory), I feel my despair at the\nchilling thought of my country's impotence--the crushing weight of the\nRoman yoke, comforted, at least, by the thought that earth is but the\nbeginning of life--that the glory of a few years matters little in the\nvast space of eternity--that there is no perfect freedom till the chains\nof clay fall from the soul, and all space, all time, become its heritage\nand domain.  Yet, Sallust, some mixture of the soft Greek blood still\nmingles with my faith. I can share not the zeal of those who see crime\nand eternal wrath in men who cannot believe as they.  I shudder not at\nthe creed of others.  I dare not curse them--I pray the Great Father to\nconvert.  This lukewarmness exposes me to some suspicion amongst the\nChristians: but I forgive it; and, not offending openly the prejudices\nof the crowd, I am thus enabled to protect my brethren from the danger\nof the law, and the consequences of their own zeal.  If moderation seem\nto me the natural creature of benevolence, it gives, also, the greatest\nscope to beneficence.\n\n'Such, then, O Sallust! is my life--such my opinions.  In this manner I\ngreet existence and await death.  And thou, glad-hearted and kindly\npupil of Epicurus, thou...  But come hither, and see what enjoyments,\nwhat hopes are ours--and not the splendor of imperial banquets, nor the\nshouts of the crowded circus, nor the noisy forum, nor the glittering\ntheatre, nor the luxuriant gardens, nor the voluptuous baths of\nRome--shall seem to thee to constitute a life of more vivid and\nuninterrupted happiness than that which thou so unreasonably pitiest as\nthe career of Glaucus the Athenian!--Farewell!'\n\nNearly Seventeen Centuries had rolled away when the City of Pompeii was\ndisinterred from its silent tomb, all vivid with undimmed hues; its\nwalls fresh as if painted yesterday--not a hue faded on the rich mosaic\nof its floors--in its forum the half-finished columns as left by the\nworkman's hand--in its gardens the sacrificial tripod--in its halls the\nchest of treasure--in its baths the strigil--in its theatres the counter\nof admission--in its saloons the furniture and the lamp--in its\ntriclinia the fragments of the last feast--in its cubicula the perfumes\nand the rouge of faded beauty--and everywhere the bones and skeletons of\nthose who once moved the springs of that minute yet gorgeous machine of\nluxury and of life! In the house of Diomed, in the subterranean vaults,\ntwenty skeletons (one of a babe) were discovered in one spot by the\ndoor, covered by a fine ashen dust, that had evidently been wafted\nslowly through the apertures, until it had filled the whole space.\nThere were jewels and coins, candelabra for unavailing light, and wine\nhardened in the amphorae for a prolongation of agonized life.  The sand,\nconsolidated by damps, had taken the forms of the skeletons as in a\ncast; and the traveler may yet see the impression of a female neck and\nbosom of young and round proportions--the trace of the fated Julia!  It\nseems to the inquirer as if the air had been gradually changed into a\nsulphurous vapor; the inmates of the vaults had rushed to the door, to\nfind it closed and blocked up by the scoria without, and in their\nattempts to force it, had been suffocated with the atmosphere.\n\nIn the garden was found a skeleton with a key by its bony hand, and near\nit a bag of coins.  This is believed to have been the master of the\nhouse--the unfortunate Diomed, who had probably sought to escape by the\ngarden, and been destroyed either by the vapors or some fragment of\nstone.  Beside some silver vases lay another skeleton, probably of a\nslave.\n\nThe houses of Sallust and of Pansa, the Temple of Isis, with the\njuggling concealments behind the statues--the lurking-place of its holy\noracles--are now bared to the gaze of the curious.  In one of the\nchambers of that temple was found a huge skeleton with an axe beside it:\ntwo walls had been pierced by the axe--the victim could penetrate no\nfarther.  In the midst of the city was found another skeleton, by the\nside of which was a heap of coins, and many of the mystic ornaments of\nthe fane of Isis.  Death had fallen upon him in his avarice, and Calenus\nperished simultaneously with Burbo!  As the excavators cleared on\nthrough the mass of ruin, they found the skeleton of a man literally\nsevered in two by a prostrate column; the skull was of so striking a\nconformation, so boldly marked in its intellectual as well as its worse\nphysical developments, that it has excited the constant speculation of\nevery itinerant believer in the theories of Spurzheim who has gazed upon\nthat ruined palace of the mind.  Still, after the lapse of ages, the\ntraveler may survey that airy hall within whose cunning galleries and\nelaborate chambers once thought, reasoned, dreamed, and sinned, the soul\nof Arbaces the Egyptian.\n\nViewing the various witnesses of a social system which has passed from\nthe world for ever--a stranger, from that remote and barbarian Isle\nwhich the Imperial Roman shivered when he named, paused amidst the\ndelights of the soft Campania and composed this history!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Last Days of Pompeii, by\nEdward George Bulwer-Lytton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1565.txt or 1565.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/5\/6\/1565\/\n\nProduced by John T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":823,"split":"train"}
