{"ori_id":"b236a647b02cd1b003edbf96ab501e8d6aea6c6d","title":"It's Complicated (film)","context":"It's Complicated (film)\n Jane (Meryl Streep), who owns a successful bakery in Santa Barbara, California, and Jake Adler (Alec Baldwin), a successful attorney, divorced ten years earlier. They had three children together, two girls and a boy, who are grown. Jake, who was cheating on Jane, married the much younger Agness (Lake Bell).\nJane and Jake attend their son Luke's graduation from college in New York City. After a dinner together, the two begin an affair, which continues in Santa Barbara. Jane is torn about the affair; Jake is not. While Agness has Jake scheduled for regular sessions at a fertility clinic, Jake is secretly taking medication, a side effect of which reduces his sperm count. After one of his sessions he has a lunchtime rendezvous with Jane at a hotel. Jake collapses in the hotel room and a doctor is called. The doctor speculates that the reason for Jake's distress may be the medication and says he should stop taking it. Jake and Jane's children know nothing of the affair, but Harley (John Krasinski), who is engaged to their daughter Lauren, spots the pair and the doctor in the hotel, but keeps silent.\nAdam (Steve Martin) is an architect hired to remodel Jane's home. Still healing from a divorce of his own, he begins to fall in love with Jane. On the night of Luke's graduation party in Santa Barbara, Jane invites Adam to the party. She is stoned when he picks her up because she has smoked a marijuana joint that Jake had given her earlier. Later at the party, Adam also smokes a joint with Jane. Jake becomes jealous observing them, but with some cajoling by Jane, he gets stoned with them as well.\nAgness then observes Jake and Jane dancing together and becomes suspicious of their closeness. When they leave the party, Adam asks Jane if they could have something to eat. Jane takes him to her bakery and they make chocolate croissants together. Jake and Agness separate, although it is not clear who leaves whom. Eventually by a webcam in Jane's bedroom, Adam sees Jake naked and realizes that the two have been having an affair. Adam tells Jane he cannot continue seeing her because it will only lead to heartbreak. Jane's kids also find out, and they are not happy about Mom and Dad getting together again because they are still recovering from the divorce. Jane tells them she is not getting back with Jake. Jane and Jake talk and end their affair on amicable terms. The film ends with Adam at Jane's house ready to commence the remodeling. Before the credits roll, Jane and Adam are seen laughing about the chocolate croissants while walking into her house.\n<html>\n<head><title>It's Complicated Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"It's Complicated script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"It's Complicated script, It's Complicated movie script, It's Complicated film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
