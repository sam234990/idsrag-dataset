His father, Sir Sampson Legend, offers him \u00c2\u01414000 (only enough to pay his debts) if he will sign a bond engaging to make over his right to his inheritance to his younger brother Ben. Valentine, to escape from his embarrassment, signs the bond. He is in love with Angelica, who possesses a fortune of her own, but so far she has not yielded to his suit. Sir Sampson has arranged a match between Ben, who is at sea, and Miss Prue, an awkward country girl, the daughter of Foresight, a superstitious old fool who claims to be an astrologer. Valentine, realizing the ruin entailed by the signature of the bond, tries to move his father by submission, and fails; then pretends to be mad and unable to sign the final deed of conveyance to his brother. Finally Angelica intervenes. She induces Sir Sampson to propose marriage to her, pretends to accept, and gets possession of Valentine's bond. When Valentine, in despair at finding that Angelica is about to marry his father, declares himself ready to sign the conveyance, she reveals the plot, tears up the bond, and declares her love for Valentine.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Love for Love, by William Congreve\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions \nwhatsoever.

For though one should have a vanity in ruining another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreputation, yet the other may only have an ambition to advance his own.\nAnd I beg leave, my lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the cause\nand excuse of this dedication.\n\nWhoever is king is also the father of his country; and as nobody can\ndispute your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monarchy in poetry, so all that are concerned\nought to acknowledge your universal patronage.  And it is only presuming\non the privilege of a loyal subject that I have ventured to make this, my\naddress of thanks, to your lordship, which at the same time includes a\nprayer for your protection.\n\nI am not ignorant of the common form of poetical dedications, which are\ngenerally made up of panegyrics, where the authors endeavour to\ndistinguish their patrons, by the shining characters they give them,\nabove other men.  But that, my lord, is not my business at this time, nor\nis your lordship _now_ to be distinguished.  I am contented with the\nhonour I do myself in this epistle without the vanity of attempting to\nadd to or explain your Lordships character.\n\nI confess it is not without some struggling that I behave myself in this\ncase as I ought: for it is very hard to be pleased with a subject, and\nyet forbear it.  But I choose rather to follow Pliny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precept, than his\nexample, when, in his panegyric to the Emperor Trajan, he says:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n    _Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati possint_, _quam quid\n    virtutibus debeatur_.\n\nI hope I may be excused the pedantry of a quotation when it is so justly\napplied.  Here are some lines in the print (and which your lordship read\nbefore this play was acted) that were omitted on the stage; and\nparticularly one whole scene in the third act, which not only helps the\ndesign forward with less precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous\ncharacter of Foresight, which indeed seems to be maimed without it.  But\nI found myself in great danger of a long play, and was glad to help it\nwhere I could.  Though notwithstanding my care and the kind reception it\nhad from the town, I could heartily wish it yet shorter: but the number\nof different characters represented in it would have been too much\ncrowded in less room.\n\nThis reflection on prolixity (a fault for which scarce any one beauty\nwill atone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain your lordship any\nlonger with the trifles of, my lord, your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most obedient and\nmost humble servant,\n\n                                                         WILLIAM CONGREVE.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE.\n\n\n        Spoken, at the opening of the new house, by Mr. BETTERTON.\n\n   THE husbandman in vain renews his toil\n   To cultivate each year a hungry soil;\n   And fondly hopes for rich and generous fruit,\n   When what should feed the tree devours the root;\n   Th\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unladen boughs, he sees, bode certain dearth,\n   Unless transplanted to more kindly earth.\n   So the poor husbands of the stage, who found\n   Their labours lost upon ungrateful ground,\n   This last and only remedy have proved,\n   And hope new fruit from ancient stocks removed.\n   Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid,\n   Well plant a soil which you so rich have made.\n   As Nature gave the world to man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first age,\n   So from your bounty, we receive this stage;\n   The freedom man was born to, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve restored,\n   And to our world such plenty you afford,\n   It seems like Eden, fruitful of its own accord.\n   But since in Paradise frail flesh gave way,\n   And when but two were made, both went astray;\n   Forbear your wonder, and the fault forgive,\n   If in our larger family we grieve\n   One falling Adam and one tempted Eve.\n   We who remain would gratefully repay\n   What our endeavours can, and bring this day\n   The first-fruit offering of a virgin play.\n   We hope there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that may please each taste,\n   And though of homely fare we make the feast,\n   Yet you will find variety at least.\n   There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humour, which for cheerful friends we got,\n   And for the thinking party there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plot.\n   We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve something, too, to gratify ill-nature,\n   (If there be any here), and that is satire.\n   Though satire scarce dares grin, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis grown so mild\n   Or only shows its teeth, as if it smiled.\n   As asses thistles, poets mumble wit,\n   And dare not bite for fear of being bit:\n   They hold their pens, as swords are held by fools,\n   And are afraid to use their own edge-tools.\n   Since the Plain-Dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scenes of manly rage,\n   Not one has dared to lash this crying age.\n   This time, the poet owns the bold essay,\n   Yet hopes there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no ill-manners in his play;\n   And he declares, by me, he has designed\n   Affront to none, but frankly speaks his mind.\n   And should th\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ensuing scenes not chance to hit,\n   He offers but this one excuse, \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas writ\n   Before your late encouragement of wit.\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\n\nSpoken, at the opening of the new house, by Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE.\n\n   SURE Providence at first designed this place\n   To be the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refuge in distress;\n   For still in every storm they all run hither,\n   As to a shed that shields \u00e2\u0080\u0099em from the weather.\n   But thinking of this change which last befel us,\n   It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like what I have heard our poets tell us:\n   For when behind our scenes their suits are pleading,\n   To help their love, sometimes they show their reading;\n   And, wanting ready cash to pay for hearts,\n   They top their learning on us, and their parts.\n   Once of philosophers they told us stories,\n   Whom, as I think, they called\u00e2\u0080\u0094Py\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pythagories,\n   I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis some such Latin name they give \u00e2\u0080\u0099em,\n   And we, who know no better, must believe \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\n   Now to these men, say they, such souls were given,\n   That after death ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er went to hell nor heaven,\n   But lived, I know not how, in beasts; and then\n   When many years were past, in men again.\n   Methinks, we players resemble such a soul,\n   That does from bodies, we from houses stroll.\n   Thus Aristotle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul, of old that was,\n   May now be damned to animate an ass,\n   Or in this very house, for ought we know,\n   Is doing painful penance in some beau;\n   And thus our audience, which did once resort\n   To shining theatres to see our sport,\n   Now find us tossed into a tennis-court.\n   These walls but t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other day were filled with noise\n   Of roaring gamesters and your dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099me boys;\n   Then bounding balls and rackets they encompast,\n   And now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re filled with jests, and flights, and bombast!\n   I vow, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much like this transmigration,\n   Strolling from place to place by circulation;\n   Grant heaven, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return to our first station!\n   I know not what these think, but for my part\n   I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect without an aching heart,\n   How we should end in our original, a cart.\n   But we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fear, since you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so good to save us,\n   That you have only set us up, to leave us.\n   Thus from the past we hope for future grace,\n   I beg it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n   And some here know I have a begging face.\n   Then pray continue this your kind behaviour,\n   For a clear stage won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do, without your favour.\n\n\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c3\u0086.\n\n                                 MEN.\nSIR SAMPSON LEGEND, father to Valentine and      _Mr. Underhill_.\nBen,\nVALENTINE, fallen under his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s             _Mr. Betterton_.\ndispleasure by his expensive way of living, in\nlove with Angelica,\nSCANDAL, his friend, a free speaker,             _Mr. Smith_.\nTATTLE, a half-witted beau, vain of his          _Mr. Bowman_.\namours, yet valuing himself for secrecy,\nBEN, Sir Sampson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger son, half home-bred   _Mr. Dogget_.\nand half sea-bred, designed to marry Miss\nPrue,\nFORESIGHT, an illiterate old fellow, peevish     _Mr. Sanford_.\nand positive, superstitious, and pretending to\nunderstand astrology, palmistry, physiognomy,\nomens, dreams, etc.;

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll walk a turn and digest what I have read.\n\nJERE.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll grow devilish fat upon this paper diet.  [_Aside_, _and\ntaking away the books_.]\n\nVAL.  And d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear, go you to breakfast.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a page doubled down in\nEpictetus, that is a feast for an emperor.\n\nJERE.  Was Epictetus a real cook, or did he only write receipts?\n\nVAL.  Read, read, sirrah, and refine your appetite; learn to live upon\ninstruction; feast your mind and mortify your flesh; read, and take your\nnourishment in at your eyes; shut up your mouth, and chew the cud of\nunderstanding.  So Epictetus advises.\n\nJERE.  O Lord!  I have heard much of him, when I waited upon a gentleman\nat Cambridge.  Pray what was that Epictetus?\n\nVAL.  A very rich man.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not worth a groat.\n\nJERE.  Humph, and so he has made a very fine feast, where there is\nnothing to be eaten?\n\nVAL.  Yes.\n\nJERE.  Sir, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a gentleman, and probably understand this fine\nfeeding: but if you please, I had rather be at board wages.  Does your\nEpictetus, or your Seneca here, or any of these poor rich rogues, teach\nyou how to pay your debts without money?  Will they shut up the mouths of\nyour creditors?  Will Plato be bail for you?  Or Diogenes, because he\nunderstands confinement, and lived in a tub, go to prison for you?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Slife, sir, what do you mean, to mew yourself up here with three or four\nmusty books, in commendation of starving and poverty?\n\nVAL.  Why, sirrah, I have no money, you know it; and therefore resolve to\nrail at all that have.  And in that I but follow the examples of the\nwisest and wittiest men in all ages, these poets and philosophers whom\nyou naturally hate, for just such another reason; because they abound in\nsense, and you are a fool.\n\nJERE.  Ay, sir, I am a fool, I know it: and yet, heaven help me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m poor\nenough to be a wit.  But I was always a fool when I told you what your\nexpenses would bring you to; your coaches and your liveries; your treats\nand your balls; your being in love with a lady that did not care a\nfarthing for you in your prosperity; and keeping company with wits that\ncared for nothing but your prosperity; and now, when you are poor, hate\nyou as much as they do one another.\n\nVAL.  Well, and now I am poor I have an opportunity to be revenged on\nthem all.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pursue Angelica with more love than ever, and appear more\nnotoriously her admirer in this restraint, than when I openly rivalled\nthe rich fops that made court to her.  So shall my poverty be a\nmortification to her pride, and, perhaps, make her compassionate the love\nwhich has principally reduced me to this lowness of fortune.  And for the\nwits, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I am in a condition to be even with them.\n\nJERE.  Nay, your condition is pretty even with theirs, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the truth\non\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nVAL.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take some of their trade out of their hands.\n\nJERE.  Now heaven of mercy continue the tax upon paper.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean\nto write?\n\nVAL.  Yes, I do.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll write a play.\n\nJERE.  Hem!  Sir, if you please to give me a small certificate of three\nlines\u00e2\u0080\u0094only to certify those whom it may concern, that the bearer hereof,\nJeremy Fetch by name, has for the space of seven years truly and\nfaithfully served Valentine Legend, Esq., and that he is not now turned\naway for any misdemeanour, but does voluntarily dismiss his master from\nany future authority over him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  No, sirrah; you shall live with me still.\n\nJERE.  Sir, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible.  I may die with you, starve with you, or be\ndamned with your works.  But to live, even three days, the life of a\nplay, I no more expect it than to be canonised for a muse after my\ndecease.\n\nVAL.  You are witty, you rogue.  I shall want your help.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have you\nlearn to make couplets to tag the ends of acts.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear?  Get the\nmaids to Crambo in an evening, and learn the knack of rhyming: you may\narrive at the height of a song sent by an unknown hand, or a\nchocolate-house lampoon.\n\nJERE.  But, sir, is this the way to recover your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favour?  Why,\nSir Sampson will be irreconcilable.  If your younger brother should come\nfrom sea, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never look upon you again.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re undone, sir; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nruined; you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a friend left in the world if you turn poet.  Ah,\npox confound that Will\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffee-house: it has ruined more young men than\nthe Royal Oak lottery.  Nothing thrives that belongs to\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  The man of\nthe house would have been an alderman by this time, with half the trade,\nif he had set up in the city.  For my part, I never sit at the door that\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get double the stomach that I do at a horse race.  The air upon\nBanstead-Downs is nothing to it for a whetter; yet I never see it, but\nthe spirit of famine appears to me, sometimes like a decayed porter, worn\nout with pimping, and carrying _billet doux_ and songs: not like other\nporters, for hire, but for the jests\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake.  Now like a thin chairman,\nmelted down to half his proportion, with carrying a poet upon tick, to\nvisit some great fortune; and his fare to be paid him like the wages of\nsin, either at the day of marriage, or the day of death.\n\nVAL.  Very well, sir; can you proceed?\n\nJERE.  Sometimes like a bilked bookseller, with a meagre terrified\ncountenance, that looks as if he had written for himself, or were\nresolved to turn author, and bring the rest of his brethren into the same\ncondition.  And lastly, in the form of a worn-out punk, with verses in\nher hand, which her vanity had preferred to settlements, without a whole\ntatter to her tail, but as ragged as one of the muses; or as if she were\ncarrying her linen to the paper-mill, to be converted into folio books of\nwarning to all young maids, not to prefer poetry to good sense, or lying\nin the arms of a needy wit, before the embraces of a wealthy fool.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                       VALENTINE, SCANDAL, JEREMY.\n\nSCAN.  What, Jeremy holding forth?\n\nVAL.  The rogue has (with all the wit he could muster up) been declaiming\nagainst wit.\n\nSCAN.  Ay?  Why, then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid Jeremy has wit: for wherever it is,\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always contriving its own ruin.\n\nJERE.  Why, so I have been telling my master, sir: Mr. Scandal, for\nheaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, sir, try if you can dissuade him from turning poet.\n\nSCAN.  Poet!  He shall turn soldier first, and rather depend upon the\noutside of his head than the lining.  Why, what the devil, has not your\npoverty made you enemies enough?  Must you needs shew your wit to get\nmore?\n\nJERE.  Ay, more indeed: for who cares for anybody that has more wit than\nhimself?\n\nSCAN.  Jeremy speaks like an oracle.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see how worthless great\nmen and dull rich rogues avoid a witty man of small fortune?  Why, he\nlooks like a writ of enquiry into their titles and estates, and seems\ncommissioned by heaven to seize hte better half.\n\nVAL.  Therefore I would rail in my writings, and be revenged.\n\nSCAN.  Rail?  At whom?  The whole world?  Impotent and vain!  Who would\ndie a martyr to sense in a country where the religion is folly?  You may\nstand at bay for a while; but when the full cry is against you, you\nshan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have fair play for your life.  If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fairly run down by\nthe hounds, you will be treacherously shot by the huntsmen.  No, turn\npimp, flatterer, quack, lawyer, parson, be chaplain to an atheist, or\nstallion to an old woman, anything but poet.  A modern poet is worse,\nmore servile, timorous, and fawning, than any I have named: without you\ncould retrieve the ancient honours of the name, recall the stage of\nAthens, and be allowed the force of open honest satire.\n\nVAL.  You are as inveterate against our poets as if your character had\nbeen lately exposed upon the stage.  Nay, I am not violently bent upon\nthe trade.  [_One knocks_.]  Jeremy, see who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there.  [JER. _goes to the\ndoor_.]  But tell me what you would have me do?  What do the world say of\nme, and my forced confinement?\n\nSCAN.  The world behaves itself as it uses to do on such occasions; some\npity you, and condemn your father; others excuse him, and blame you; only\nthe ladies are merciful, and wish you well, since love and pleasurable\nexpense have been your greatest faults.\n\nVAL.  How now?\n\nJERE.  Nothing new, sir; I have despatched some half a dozen duns with as\nmuch dexterity as a hungry judge does causes at dinner-time.\n\nVAL.  What answer have you given \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?\n\nSCAN.  Patience, I suppose, the old receipt.\n\nJERE.  No, faith, sir; I have put \u00e2\u0080\u0099em off so long with patience and\nforbearance, and other fair words, that I was forced now to tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099em in\nplain downright English\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  What?\n\nJERE.  That they should be paid.\n\nVAL.  When?\n\nJERE.  To-morrow.\n\nVAL.  And how the devil do you mean to keep your word?\n\nJERE.  Keep it?  Not at all; it has been so very much stretched that I\nreckon it will break of course by to-morrow, and nobody be surprised at\nthe matter.  [_Knocking_.]  Again!  Sir, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like my\nnegotiation, will you be pleased to answer these yourself?\n\nVAL.  See who they are.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                           VALENTINE, SCANDAL.\n\nVAL.  By this, Scandal, you may see what it is to be great; secretaries\nof state, presidents of the council, and generals of an army lead just\nsuch a life as I do; have just such crowds of visitants in a morning, all\nsoliciting of past promises; which are but a civiller sort of duns, that\nlay claim to voluntary debts.\n\nSCAN.  And you, like a true great man, having engaged their attendance,\nand promised more than ever you intended to perform, are more perplexed\nto find evasions than you would be to invent the honest means of keeping\nyour word, and gratifying your creditors.\n\nVAL.  Scandal, learn to spare your friends, and do not provoke your\nenemies; this liberty of your tongue will one day bring a confinement on\nyour body, my friend.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                       VALENTINE, SCANDAL, JEREMY.\n\nJERE.  O sir, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trapland the scrivener, with two suspicious fellows\nlike lawful pads, that would knock a man down with pocket-tipstaves.  And\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steward, and the nurse with one of your children\nfrom Twitnam.\n\nVAL.  Pox on her, could she find no other time to fling my sins in my\nface?  Here, give her this, [_gives money_] and bid her trouble me no\nmore; a thoughtless two-handed whore, she knows my condition well enough,\nand might have overlaid the child a fortnight ago, if she had had any\nforecast in her.\n\nSCAN.  What, is it bouncing Margery, with my godson?\n\nJERE.  Yes, sir.\n\nSCAN.  My blessing to the boy, with this token [_gives money_] of my\nlove.  And d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear, bid Margery put more flocks in her bed, shift twice\na week, and not work so hard, that she may not smell so vigorously.  I\nshall take the air shortly.\n\nVAL.  Scandal, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil my boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milk.  Bid Trapland come in.  If I\ncan give that Cerberus a sop, I shall be at rest for one day.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n                  VALENTINE, SCANDAL, TRAPLAND, JEREMY.\n\nVAL.  Oh, Mr. Trapland!  My old friend!  Welcome.  Jeremy, a chair\nquickly: a bottle of sack and a toast\u00e2\u0080\u0094fly\u00e2\u0080\u0094a chair first.\n\nTRAP.  A good morning to you, Mr. Valentine, and to you, Mr. Scandal.\n\nSCAN.  The morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very good morning, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil it.\n\nVAL.  Come, sit you down, you know his way.\n\nTRAP.  [_sits_.]  There is a debt, Mr. Valentine, of \u00c2\u00a31500 of pretty long\nstanding\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  I cannot talk about business with a thirsty palate.  Sirrah, the\nsack.\n\nTRAP.  And I desire to know what course you have taken for the payment?\n\nVAL.  Faith and troth, I am heartily glad to see you.  My service to you.\nFill, fill to honest Mr. Trapland\u00e2\u0080\u0094fuller.\n\nTRAP.  Hold, sweetheart: this is not to our business.  My service to you,\nMr. Scandal.  [_Drinks_.]  I have forborne as long\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  T\u00e2\u0080\u0099other glass, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk.  Fill, Jeremy.\n\nTRAP.  No more, in truth.  I have forborne, I say\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  Sirrah, fill when I bid you.  And how does your handsome daughter?\nCome, a good husband to her.  [_Drinks_.]\n\nTRAP.  Thank you.  I have been out of this money\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  Drink first.  Scandal, why do you not drink?  [_They drink_.]\n\nTRAP.  And, in short, I can be put off no longer.\n\nVAL.  I was much obliged to you for your supply.  It did me signal\nservice in my necessity.  But you delight in doing good.  Scandal, drink\nto me, my friend Trapland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health.  An honester man lives not, nor one\nmore ready to serve his friend in distress: though I say it to his face.\nCome, fill each man his glass.\n\nSCAN.  What, I know Trapland has been a whoremaster, and loves a wench\nstill.  You never knew a whoremaster that was not an honest fellow.\n\nTRAP.  Fie, Mr. Scandal, you never knew\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  What don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I know?  I know the buxom black widow in the Poultry.\n\u00c2\u00a3800 a year jointure, and \u00c2\u00a320,000 in money.  Aha! old Trap.\n\nVAL.  Say you so, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith?  Come, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember the widow.  I know\nwhereabouts you are; come, to the widow\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nTRAP.  No more, indeed.\n\nVAL.  What, the widow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health; give it him\u00e2\u0080\u0094off with it.  [_They drink_.]\nA lovely girl, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith, black sparkling eyes, soft pouting ruby lips!\nBetter sealing there than a bond for a million, ha?\n\nTRAP.  No, no, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no such thing; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better mind our business.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a wag.\n\nVAL.  No, faith, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll mind the widow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business: fill again.  Pretty\nround heaving breasts, a Barbary shape, and a jut with her bum would stir\nan anchoret: and the prettiest foot!  Oh, if a man could but fasten his\neyes to her feet as they steal in and out, and play at bo-peep under her\npetticoats, ah!  Mr. Trapland?\n\nTRAP.  Verily, give me a glass.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a wag,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to the widow.\n[_Drinks_.]\n\nSCAN.  He begins to chuckle; ply him close, or he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll relapse into a dun.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] OFFICER.\n\nOFF.  By your leave, gentlemen: Mr. Trapland, if we must do our office,\ntell us.  We have half a dozen gentlemen to arrest in Pall Mall and\nCovent Garden; and if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make haste the chairmen will be abroad,\nand block up the chocolate-houses, and then our labour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost.\n\nTRAP.  Udso that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true: Mr. Valentine, I love mirth, but business must\nbe done.  Are you ready to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nJERE.  Sir, your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steward says he comes to make proposals\nconcerning your debts.\n\nVAL.  Bid him come in: Mr. Trapland, send away your officer; you shall\nhave an answer presently.\n\nTRAP.  Mr. Snap, stay within call.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                  VALENTINE, SCANDAL, TRAPLAND, JEREMY,\n                    STEWARD _who whispers_ VALENTINE.\n\nSCAN.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dog now, a traitor in his wine: sirrah, refund the\nsack.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jeremy, fetch him some warm water, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll rip up his stomach, and\ngo the shortest way to his conscience.\n\nTRAP.  Mr. Scandal, you are uncivil; I did not value your sack; but you\ncannot expect it again when I have drunk it.\n\nSCAN.  And how do you expect to have your money again when a gentleman\nhas spent it?\n\nVAL.  You need say no more, I understand the conditions; they are very\nhard, but my necessity is very pressing: I agree to \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  Take Mr.\nTrapland with you, and let him draw the writing.  Mr. Trapland, you know\nthis man: he shall satisfy you.\n\nTRAP.  Sincerely, I am loth to be thus pressing, but my necessity\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  No apology, good Mr. Scrivener, you shall be paid.\n\nTRAP.  I hope you forgive me; my business requires\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                           VALENTINE, SCANDAL.\n\nSCAN.  He begs pardon like a hangman at an execution.\n\nVAL.  But I have got a reprieve.\n\nSCAN.  I am surprised; what, does your father relent?\n\nVAL.  No; he has sent me the hardest conditions in the world.  You have\nheard of a booby brother of mine that was sent to sea three years ago?\nThis brother, my father hears, is landed; whereupon he very\naffectionately sends me word; if I will make a deed of conveyance of my\nright to his estate, after his death, to my younger brother, he will\nimmediately furnish me with four thousand pounds to pay my debts and make\nmy fortune.  This was once proposed before, and I refused it; but the\npresent impatience of my creditors for their money, and my own impatience\nof confinement, and absence from Angelica, force me to consent.\n\nSCAN.  A very desperate demonstration of your love to Angelica; and I\nthink she has never given you any assurance of hers.\n\nVAL.  You know her temper; she never gave me any great reason either for\nhope or despair.\n\nSCAN.  Women of her airy temper, as they seldom think before they act, so\nthey rarely give us any light to guess at what they mean.  But you have\nlittle reason to believe that a woman of this age, who has had an\nindifference for you in your prosperity, will fall in love with your\nill-fortune; besides, Angelica has a great fortune of her own; and great\nfortunes either expect another great fortune, or a fool.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] JEREMY.\n\nJERE.  More misfortunes, sir.\n\nVAL.  What, another dun?\n\nJERE.  No, sir, but Mr. Tattle is come to wait upon you.\n\nVAL.  Well, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it, you must bring him up; he knows I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go\nabroad.\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n                           VALENTINE, SCANDAL.\n\nSCAN.  Pox on him, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone.\n\nVAL.  No, prithee stay: Tattle and you should never be asunder; you are\nlight and shadow, and show one another; he is perfectly thy reverse both\nin humour and understanding; and as you set up for defamation, he is a\nmender of reputations.\n\nSCAN.  A mender of reputations!  Ay, just as he is a keeper of secrets,\nanother virtue that he sets up for in the same manner.  For the rogue\nwill speak aloud in the posture of a whisper, and deny a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name\nwhile he gives you the marks of her person.  He will forswear receiving a\nletter from her, and at the same time show you her hand in the\nsuperscription: and yet perhaps he has counterfeited the hand too, and\nsworn to a truth; but he hopes not to be believed, and refuses the\nreputation of a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favour, as a Doctor says no to a Bishopric only\nthat it may be granted him.  In short, he is public professor of secrecy,\nand makes proclamation that he holds private intelligence.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] TATTLE.\n\nTATT.  Valentine, good morrow; Scandal, I am yours:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, when you\nspeak well of me.\n\nSCAN.  That is, when I am yours; for while I am my own, or anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nelse, that will never happen.\n\nTATT.  How inhuman!\n\nVAL.  Why Tattle, you need not be much concerned at anything that he\nsays: for to converse with Scandal, is to play at losing loadum; you must\nlose a good name to him before you can win it for yourself.\n\nTATT.  But how barbarous that is, and how unfortunate for him, that the\nworld shall think the better of any person for his calumniation!  I thank\nheaven, it has always been a part of my character to handle the\nreputations of others very tenderly indeed.\n\nSCAN.  Ay, such rotten reputations as you have to deal with are to be\nhandled tenderly indeed.\n\nTATT.  Nay, but why rotten?  Why should you say rotten, when you know not\nthe persons of whom you speak?  How cruel that is!\n\nSCAN.  Not know \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?  Why, thou never had\u00e2\u0080\u0099st to do with anybody that did\nnot stink to all the town.\n\nTATT.  Ha, ha, ha; nay, now you make a jest of it indeed.  For there is\nnothing more known than that nobody knows anything of that nature of me.\nAs I hope to be saved, Valentine, I never exposed a woman, since I knew\nwhat woman was.\n\nVAL.  And yet you have conversed with several.\n\nTATT.  To be free with you, I have.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care if I own that.  Nay\nmore (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say a bold word now) I never could meddle with a woman\nthat had to do with anybody else.\n\nSCAN.  How?\n\nVAL.  Nay faith, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m apt to believe him.  Except her husband, Tattle.\n\nTATT.  Oh, that\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  What think you of that noble commoner, Mrs. Drab?\n\nTATT.  Pooh, I know Madam Drab has made her brags in three or four\nplaces, that I said this and that, and writ to her, and did I know not\nwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, upon my reputation, she did me wrong\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, well, that was\nmalice\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I know the bottom of it.  She was bribed to that by one we all\nknow\u00e2\u0080\u0094a man too.  Only to bring me into disgrace with a certain woman of\nquality\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  Whom we all know.\n\nTATT.  No matter for that.  Yes, yes, everybody knows.  No doubt on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\neverybody knows my secrets.  But I soon satisfied the lady of my\ninnocence; for I told her: Madam, says I, there are some persons who make\nit their business to tell stories, and say this and that of one and\nt\u00e2\u0080\u0099other, and everything in the world; and, says I, if your grace\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  Grace!\n\nTATT.  O Lord, what have I said?  My unlucky tongue!\n\nVAL.  Ha, ha, ha.\n\nSCAN.  Why, Tattle, thou hast more impudence than one can in reason\nexpect: I shall have an esteem for thee, well, and, ha, ha, ha, well, go\non, and what did you say to her grace?\n\nVAL.  I confess this is something extraordinary.\n\nTATT.  Not a word, as I hope to be saved; an errant _lapsus lingu\u00c3\u00a6_.\nCome, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk of something else.\n\nVAL.  Well, but how did you acquit yourself?\n\nTATT.  Pooh, pooh, nothing at all; I only rallied with you\u00e2\u0080\u0094a woman of\nordinary rank was a little jealous of me, and I told her something or\nother, faith I know not what.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk of something else.  [_Hums\na song_.]\n\nSCAN.  Hang him, let him alone, he has a mind we should enquire.\n\nTATT.  Valentine, I supped last night with your mistress, and her uncle,\nold Foresight: I think your father lies at Foresight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nVAL.  Yes.\n\nTATT.  Upon my soul, Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine woman.  And so is Mrs. Foresight,\nand her sister, Mrs. Frail.\n\nSCAN.  Yes, Mrs. Frail is a very fine woman, we all know her.\n\nTATT.  Oh, that is not fair.\n\nSCAN.  What?\n\nTATT.  To tell.\n\nSCAN.  To tell what?  Why, what do you know of Mrs. Frail?\n\nTATT.  Who, I?  Upon honour I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether she be man or woman, but\nby the smoothness of her chin and roundness of her hips.\n\nSCAN.  No?\n\nTATT.  No.\n\nSCAN.  She says otherwise.\n\nTATT.  Impossible!\n\nSCAN.  Yes, faith.  Ask Valentine else.\n\nTATT.  Why then, as I hope to be saved, I believe a woman only obliges a\nman to secrecy that she may have the pleasure of telling herself.\n\nSCAN.  No doubt on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  Well, but has she done you wrong, or no?  You have\nhad her?  Ha?\n\nTATT.  Though I have more honour than to tell first, I have more manners\nthan to contradict what a lady has declared.\n\nSCAN.  Well, you own it?\n\nTATT.  I am strangely surprised!  Yes, yes, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if she taxes\nme with it.\n\nSCAN.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be here by and by, she sees Valentine every morning.\n\nTATT.  How?\n\nVAL.  She does me the favour, I mean, of a visit sometimes.  I did not\nthink she had granted more to anybody.\n\nSCAN.  Nor I, faith.  But Tattle does not use to bely a lady; it is\ncontrary to his character.  How one may be deceived in a woman,\nValentine?\n\nTATT.  Nay, what do you mean, gentlemen?\n\nSCAN.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m resolved I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask her.\n\nTATT.  O barbarous!  Why did you not tell me?\n\nSCAN.  No; you told us.\n\nTATT.  And bid me ask Valentine?\n\nVAL.  What did I say?  I hope you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring me to confess an answer\nwhen you never asked me the question?\n\nTATT.  But, gentlemen, this is the most inhuman proceeding\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  Nay, if you have known Scandal thus long, and cannot avoid such a\npalpable decoy as this was, the ladies have a fine time whose reputations\nare in your keeping.\n\n\n\nSCENE XII.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] JEREMY.\n\nJERE.  Sir, Mrs. Frail has sent to know if you are stirring.\n\nVAL.  Show her up when she comes.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII.\n\n\n                       VALENTINE, SCANDAL, TATTLE.\n\nTATT.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone.\n\nVAL.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet her.\n\nTATT.  Is there not a back way?\n\nVAL.  If there were, you have more discretion than to give Scandal such\nan advantage.  Why, your running away will prove all that he can tell\nher.\n\nTATT.  Scandal, you will not be so ungenerous.  Oh, I shall lose my\nreputation of secrecy for ever.  I shall never be received but upon\npublic days, and my visits will never be admitted beyond a drawing-room.\nI shall never see a bed-chamber again, never be locked in a closet, nor\nrun behind a screen, or under a table: never be distinguished among the\nwaiting-women by the name of trusty Mr. Tattle more.  You will not be so\ncruel?\n\nVAL.  Scandal, have pity on him; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll yield to any conditions.\n\nTATT.  Any, any terms.\n\nSCAN.  Come, then, sacrifice half a dozen women of good reputation to me\npresently.  Come, where are you familiar?  And see that they are women of\nquality, too\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first quality.\n\nTATT.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis very hard.  Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a baronet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lady pass?\n\nSCAN.  No, nothing under a right honourable.\n\nTATT.  Oh, inhuman!  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect their names?\n\nSCAN.  No, their titles shall serve.\n\nTATT.  Alas, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same thing.  Pray spare me their titles.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ndescribe their persons.\n\nSCAN.  Well, begin then; but take notice, if you are so ill a painter\nthat I cannot know the person by your picture of her, you must be\ncondemned, like other bad painters, to write the name at the bottom.\n\nTATT.  Well, first then\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV.\n\n\n                         [_To them_] MRS. FRAIL.\n\nTATT.  Oh, unfortunate!  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come already; will you have patience till\nanother time?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll double the number.\n\nSCAN.  Well, on that condition.  Take heed you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fail me.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I shall get a fine reputation by coming to see fellows in a\nmorning.  Scandal, you devil, are you here too?  Oh, Mr. Tattle,\neverything is safe with you, we know.\n\nSCAN.  Tattle\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nTATT.  Mum.  O madam, you do me too much honour.\n\nVAL.  Well, Lady Galloper, how does Angelica?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Angelica?  Manners!\n\nVAL.  What, you will allow an absent lover\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll allow a lover present with his mistress to be\nparticular; but otherwise, I think his passion ought to give place to his\nmanners.\n\nVAL.  But what if he has more passion than manners?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Then let him marry and reform.\n\nVAL.  Marriage indeed may qualify the fury of his passion, but it very\nrarely mends a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manners.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  You are the most mistaken in the world; there is no creature\nperfectly civil but a husband.  For in a little time he grows only rude\nto his wife, and that is the highest good breeding, for it begets his\ncivility to other people.  Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you news; but I suppose you\nhear your brother Benjamin is landed?  And my brother Foresight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaughter is come out of the country: I assure you, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a match talked\nof by the old people.  Well, if he be but as great a sea-beast as she is\na land-monster, we shall have a most amphibious breed.  The progeny will\nbe all otters.  He has been bred at sea, and she has never been out of\nthe country.\n\nVAL.  Pox take \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, their conjunction bodes me no good, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Now you talk of conjunction, my brother Foresight has cast\nboth their nativities, and prognosticates an admiral and an eminent\njustice of the peace to be the issue male of their two bodies; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the\nmost superstitious old fool!  He would have persuaded me that this was an\nunlucky day, and would not let me come abroad.  But I invented a dream,\nand sent him to Artimedorus for interpretation, and so stole out to see\nyou.  Well, and what will you give me now?  Come, I must have something.\n\nVAL.  Step into the next room, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you something.\n\nSCAN.  Ay, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all give you something.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, what will you all give me?\n\nVAL.  Mine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a secret.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I thought you would give me something that would be a\ntrouble to you to keep.\n\nVAL.  And Scandal shall give you a good name.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than he has for himself.  And what will you give\nme, Mr. Tattle?\n\nTATT.  I?  My soul, madam.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Pooh!  No, I thank you, I have enough to do to take care of\nmy own.  Well, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come and see you one of these mornings.  I hear\nyou have a great many pictures.\n\nTATT.  I have a pretty good collection, at your service, some originals.\n\nSCAN.  Hang him, he has nothing but the Seasons and the Twelve\nC\u00c3\u00a6sars\u00e2\u0080\u0094paltry copies\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the Five Senses, as ill-represented as they are\nin himself, and he himself is the only original you will see there.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Ay, but I hear he has a closet of beauties.\n\nSCAN.  Yes; all that have done him favours, if you will believe him.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Ay, let me see those, Mr. Tattle.\n\nTATT.  Oh, madam, those are sacred to love and contemplation.  No man but\nthe painter and myself was ever blest with the sight.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, but a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nTATT.  Nor woman, till she consented to have her picture there too\u00e2\u0080\u0094for\nthen she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obliged to keep the secret.\n\nSCAN.  No, no; come to me if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see pictures.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  You?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, faith; I can shew you your own picture, and most of your\nacquaintance to the life, and as like as at Kneller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O lying creature!  Valentine, does not he lie?  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve a word he says.\n\nVAL.  No indeed, he speaks truth now.  For as Tattle has pictures of all\nthat have granted him favours, he has the pictures of all that have\nrefused him: if satires, descriptions, characters, and lampoons are\npictures.\n\nSCAN.  Yes; mine are most in black and white.  And yet there are some set\nout in their true colours, both men and women.  I can shew you pride,\nfolly, affectation, wantonness, inconstancy, covetousness, dissimulation,\nmalice and ignorance, all in one piece.  Then I can shew you lying,\nfoppery, vanity, cowardice, bragging, lechery, impotence, and ugliness in\nanother piece; and yet one of these is a celebrated beauty, and t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other a\nprofessed beau.  I have paintings too, some pleasant enough.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Come, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hear \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\n\nSCAN.  Why, I have a beau in a _bagnio_, cupping for a complexion, and\nsweating for a shape.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  So.\n\nSCAN.  Then I have a lady burning brandy in a cellar with a hackney\ncoachman.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O devil!  Well, but that story is not true.\n\nSCAN.  I have some hieroglyphics too; I have a lawyer with a hundred\nhands, two heads, and but one face; a divine with two faces, and one\nhead; and I have a soldier with his brains in his belly, and his heart\nwhere his head should be.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  And no head?\n\nSCAN.  No head.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Pooh, this is all invention.  Have you never a poet?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, I have a poet weighing words, and selling praise for praise,\nand a critic picking his pocket.  I have another large piece too,\nrepresenting a school, where there are huge proportioned critics, with\nlong wigs, laced coats, Steinkirk cravats, and terrible faces; with\ncat-calls in their hands, and horn-books about their necks.  I have many\nmore of this kind, very well painted, as you shall see.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come, if it be but to disprove you.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] JEREMY.\n\nJERE.  Sir, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the steward again from your father.\n\nVAL.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094will you give me leave?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait on you again\npresently.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone.  Come, who squires me to the Exchange?  I\nmust call my sister Foresight there.\n\nSCAN.  I will: I have a mind to your sister.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Civil!\n\nTATT.  I will: because I have a tendre for your ladyship.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat the better reason, to my opinion.\n\nSCAN.  Well, if Tattle entertains you, I have the better opportunity to\nengage your sister.\n\nVAL.  Tell Angelica I am about making hard conditions to come abroad, and\nbe at liberty to see her.\n\nSCAN.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give an account of you and your proceedings.  If indiscretion\nbe a sign of love, you are the most a lover of anybody that I know: you\nfancy that parting with your estate will help you to your mistress.  In\nmy mind he is a thoughtless adventurer\n\n   Who hopes to purchase wealth by selling land;\n   Or win a mistress with a losing hand.\n\n\n\n\nACT II.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                     _A room in_ FORESIGHT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S _house_.\n\n                         FORESIGHT _and_ SERVANT.\n\nFORE.  Hey day!  What, are all the women of my family abroad?  Is not my\nwife come home?  Nor my sister, nor my daughter?\n\nSERV.  No, sir.\n\nFORE.  Mercy on us, what can be the meaning of it?  Sure the moon is in\nall her fortitudes.  Is my niece Angelica at home?\n\nSERV.  Yes, sir.\n\nFORE.  I believe you lie, sir.\n\nSERV.  Sir?\n\nFORE.  I say you lie, sir.  It is impossible that anything should be as I\nwould have it; for I was born, sir, when the crab was ascending, and all\nmy affairs go backward.\n\nSERV.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell indeed, sir.\n\nFORE.  No, I know you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, sir: but I can tell, and foretell, sir.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                            [_To them_] NURSE.\n\nFORE.  Nurse, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your young mistress?\n\nNURSE.   Wee\u00e2\u0080\u0099st heart, I know not, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re none of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em come home yet.\nPoor child, I warrant she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fond o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 seeing the town.  Marry, pray heaven\nthey ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 given her any dinner.  Good lack-a-day, ha, ha, ha, Oh, strange!\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll vow and swear now, ha, ha, ha, marry, and did you ever see the like!\n\nFORE.  Why, how now, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nNURSE.  Pray heaven send your worship good luck, marry, and amen with all\nmy heart, for you have put on one stocking with the wrong side outward.\n\nFORE.  Ha, how?  Faith and troth I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad of it; and so I have: that may\nbe good luck in troth, in troth it may, very good luck.  Nay, I have had\nsome omens: I got out of bed backwards too this morning, without\npremeditation; pretty good that too; but then I stumbled coming down\nstairs, and met a weasel; bad omens those: some bad, some good, our lives\nare chequered.  Mirth and sorrow, want and plenty, night and day, make up\nour time.  But in troth I am pleased at my stocking; very well pleased at\nmy stocking.  Oh, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my niece!  Sirrah, go tell Sir Sampson Legend\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait on him if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at leisure:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis now three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, a very good\nhour for business: Mercury governs this hour.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                       ANGELICA, FORESIGHT, NURSE.\n\nANG.  Is it not a good hour for pleasure too, uncle?  Pray lend me your\ncoach; mine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of order.\n\nFORE.  What, would you be gadding too?  Sure, all females are mad to-day.\nIt is of evil portent, and bodes mischief to the master of a family.  I\nremember an old prophecy written by Messahalah the Arabian, and thus\ntranslated by a reverend Buckinghamshire bard:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n   \u00e2\u0080\u0098When housewives all the house forsake,\n   And leave goodman to brew and bake,\n   Withouten guile, then be it said,\n   That house doth stand upon its head;\n   And when the head is set in grond,\n   Ne marl, if it be fruitful fond.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFruitful, the head fruitful, that bodes horns; the fruit of the head is\nhorns.  Dear niece, stay at home\u00e2\u0080\u0094for by the head of the house is meant\nthe husband; the prophecy needs no explanation.\n\nANG.  Well, but I can neither make you a cuckold, uncle, by going abroad,\nnor secure you from being one by staying at home.\n\nFORE.  Yes, yes; while there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one woman left, the prophecy is not in\nfull force.\n\nANG.  But my inclinations are in force; I have a mind to go abroad, and\nif you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lend me your coach, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a hackney or a chair, and\nleave you to erect a scheme, and find who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in conjunction with your\nwife.  Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you keep her at home, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re jealous of her when\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abroad?  You know my aunt is a little retrograde (as you call it)\nin her nature.  Uncle, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid you are not lord of the ascendant, ha,\nha, ha!\n\nFORE.  Well, Jill-flirt, you are very pert, and always ridiculing that\ncelestial science.\n\nANG.  Nay, uncle, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be angry\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you are, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reap up all your false\nprophecies, ridiculous dreams, and idle divinations.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you are\na nuisance to the neighbourhood.  What a bustle did you keep against the\nlast invisible eclipse, laying in provision as \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere for a siege.  What\na world of fire and candle, matches and tinder-boxes did you purchase!\nOne would have thought we were ever after to live under ground, or at\nleast making a voyage to Greenland, to inhabit there all the dark season.\n\nFORE.  Why, you malapert slut\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nANG.  Will you lend me your coach, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go on\u00e2\u0080\u0094nay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll declare how\nyou prophesied popery was coming only because the butler had mislaid some\nof the apostle spoons, and thought they were lost.  Away went religion\nand spoon-meat together.  Indeed, uncle, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll indite you for a wizard.\n\nFORE.  How, hussy!  Was there ever such a provoking minx?\n\nNURSE.  O merciful father, how she talks!\n\nANG.  Yes, I can make oath of your unlawful midnight practices, you and\nthe old nurse there\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nNURSE.  Marry, heaven defend!  I at midnight practices?  O Lord, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhere to do?  I in unlawful doings with my master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worship\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, did you\never hear the like now?  Sir, did ever I do anything of your midnight\nconcerns but warm your bed, and tuck you up, and set the candle and your\ntobacco-box and your urinal by you, and now and then rub the soles of\nyour feet?  O Lord, I!\n\nANG.  Yes, I saw you together through the key-hole of the closet one\nnight, like Saul and the witch of Endor, turning the sieve and shears,\nand pricking your thumbs, to write poor innocent servants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names in\nblood, about a little nutmeg grater which she had forgot in the\ncaudle-cup.  Nay, I know something worse, if I would speak of it.\n\nFORE.  I defy you, hussy; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember this, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be revenged on\nyou, cockatrice.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hamper you.  You have your fortune in your own\nhands, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a way to make your lover, your prodigal spendthrift\ngallant, Valentine, pay for all, I will.\n\nANG.  Will you?  I care not, but all shall out then.  Look to it, nurse:\nI can bring witness that you have a great unnatural teat under your left\narm, and he another; and that you suckle a young devil in the shape of a\ntabby-cat, by turns, I can.\n\nNURSE.  A teat, a teat\u00e2\u0080\u0094I an unnatural teat!  Oh, the false, slanderous\nthing; feel, feel here, if I have anything but like another Christian.\n[_Crying_.]\n\nFORE.  I will have patience, since it is the will of the stars I should\nbe thus tormented.  This is the effect of the malicious conjunctions and\noppositions in the third house of my nativity; there the curse of kindred\nwas foretold.  But I will have my doors locked up;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll punish you: not a\nman shall enter my house.\n\nANG.  Do, uncle, lock \u00e2\u0080\u0099em up quickly before my aunt come home.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhave a letter for alimony to-morrow morning.  But let me be gone first,\nand then let no mankind come near the house, but converse with spirits\nand the celestial signs, the bull and the ram and the goat.  Bless me!\nThere are a great many horned beasts among the twelve signs, uncle.  But\ncuckolds go to heaven.\n\nFORE.  But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but one virgin among the twelve signs, spitfire, but\none virgin.\n\nANG.  Nor there had not been that one, if she had had to do with anything\nbut astrologers, uncle.  That makes my aunt go abroad.\n\nFORE.  How, how?  Is that the reason?  Come, you know something; tell me\nand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forgive you.  Do, good niece.  Come, you shall have my coach and\nhorses\u00e2\u0080\u0094faith and troth you shall.  Does my wife complain?  Come, I know\nwomen tell one another.  She is young and sanguine, has a wanton hazel\neye, and was born under Gemini, which may incline her to society.  She\nhas a mole upon her lip, with a moist palm, and an open liberality on the\nmount of Venus.\n\nANG.  Ha, ha, ha!\n\nFORE.  Do you laugh?  Well, gentlewoman, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u0094but come, be a good girl,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perplex your poor uncle, tell me\u00e2\u0080\u0094won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak?  Odd, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] SERVANT.\n\nSERV.  Sir Sampson is coming down to wait upon you.\n\nANG.  Good-bye, uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0094call me a chair.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find out my aunt, and tell\nher she must not come home.\n\nFORE.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so perplexed and vexed, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not fit to receive him; I shall\nscarce recover myself before the hour be past.  Go nurse, tell Sir\nSampson I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ready to wait on him.\n\nNURSE.  Yes, sir,\n\nFORE.  Well\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, if I was born to be a cuckold, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more to be\nsaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here already.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n           FORESIGHT, _and_ SIR SAMPSON LEGEND _with a paper_.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Nor no more to be done, old boy; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plain\u00e2\u0080\u0094here \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis, I\nhave it in my hand, old Ptolomey, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the ungracious prodigal know\nwho begat him; I will, old Nostrodamus.  What, I warrant my son thought\nnothing belonged to a father but forgiveness and affection; no authority,\nno correction, no arbitrary power; nothing to be done, but for him to\noffend and me to pardon.  I warrant you, if he danced till doomsday he\nthought I was to pay the piper.  Well, but here it is under black and\nwhite, _signatum_, _sigillatum_, and _deliberatum_; that as soon as my\nson Benjamin is arrived, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to make over to him his right of\ninheritance.  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my daughter that is to be?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hah! old Merlin! body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nme, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m revenged on this undutiful rogue.\n\nFORE.  Odso, let me see; let me see the paper.  Ay, faith and troth, here\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis, if it will but hold.  I wish things were done, and the conveyance\nmade.  When was this signed, what hour?  Odso, you should have consulted\nme for the time.  Well, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make haste\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSIR SAMP.  Haste, ay, ay; haste enough.  My son Ben will be in town\nto-night.  I have ordered my lawyer to draw up writings of settlement and\njointure\u00e2\u0080\u0094all shall be done to-night.  No matter for the time; prithee,\nbrother Foresight, leave superstition.  Pox o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the time; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no time\nbut the time present, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more to be said of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past, and all\nthat is to come will happen.  If the sun shine by day, and the stars by\nnight, why, we shall know one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces without the help of a\ncandle, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the stars are good for.\n\nFORE.  How, how?  Sir Sampson, that all?  Give me leave to contradict\nyou, and tell you you are ignorant.\n\nSIR SAMP.  I tell you I am wise; and _sapiens dominabitur astris_;\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Latin for you to prove it, and an argument to confound your\nEphemeris.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ignorant!  I tell you, I have travelled old Fircu, and know\nthe globe.  I have seen the antipodes, where the sun rises at midnight,\nand sets at noon-day.\n\nFORE.  But I tell you, I have travelled, and travelled in the celestial\nspheres, know the signs and the planets, and their houses.  Can judge of\nmotions direct and retrograde, of sextiles, quadrates, trines and\noppositions, fiery-trigons and aquatical-trigons.  Know whether life\nshall be long or short, happy or unhappy, whether diseases are curable or\nincurable.  If journeys shall be prosperous, undertakings successful, or\ngoods stolen recovered; I know\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSIR SAMP.  I know the length of the Emperor of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot; have kissed\nthe Great Mogul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slippers, and rid a-hunting upon an elephant with a\nCham of Tartary.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I have made a cuckold of a king, and the\npresent majesty of Bantam is the issue of these loins.\n\nFORE.  I know when travellers lie or speak truth, when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it\nthemselves.\n\nSIR SAMP.  I have known an astrologer made a cuckold in the twinkling of\na star; and seen a conjurer that could not keep the devil out of his\nwife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle.\n\nFORE.  What, does he twit me with my wife too?  I must be better informed\nof this.  [_Aside_.]  Do you mean my wife, Sir Sampson?  Though you made\na cuckold of the king of Bantam, yet by the body of the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSIR SAMP.  By the horns of the moon, you would say, brother Capricorn.\n\nFORE.  Capricorn in your teeth, thou modern Mandeville; Ferdinand Mendez\nPinto was but a type of thee, thou liar of the first magnitude.  Take\nback your paper of inheritance; send your son to sea again.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wed my\ndaughter to an Egyptian mummy, e\u00e2\u0080\u0099er she shall incorporate with a\ncontemner of sciences, and a defamer of virtue.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I have gone too far; I must not provoke honest\nAlbumazar:\u00e2\u0080\u0094an Egyptian mummy is an illustrious creature, my trusty\nhieroglyphic; and may have significations of futurity about him; odsbud,\nI would my son were an Egyptian mummy for thy sake.  What, thou art not\nangry for a jest, my good Haly?  I reverence the sun, moon and stars with\nall my heart.  What, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make thee a present of a mummy: now I think\non\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I have a shoulder of an Egyptian king that I purloined\nfrom one of the pyramids, powdered with hieroglyphics, thou shalt have it\nbrought home to thy house, and make an entertainment for all the\nphilomaths, and students in physic and astrology in and about London.\n\nFORE.  But what do you know of my wife, Sir Sampson?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Thy wife is a constellation of virtues; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the moon, and\nthou art the man in the moon.  Nay, she is more illustrious than the\nmoon; for she has her chastity without her inconstancy: \u00e2\u0080\u0099sbud I was but\nin jest.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] JEREMY.\n\nSIR SAMP.  How now, who sent for you?  Ha!  What would you have?\n\nFORE.  Nay, if you were but in jest\u00e2\u0080\u0094who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that fellow?  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like his\nphysiognomy.\n\nSIR SAMP.  My son, sir; what son, sir?  My son Benjamin, hoh?\n\nJERE.  No, sir, Mr. Valentine, my master; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the first time he has been\nabroad since his confinement, and he comes to pay his duty to you.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Well, sir.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                FORESIGHT, SIR SAMPSON, VALENTINE, JEREMY.\n\nJERE.  He is here, sir.\n\nVAL.  Your blessing, sir.\n\nSIR SAMP.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had it already, sir; I think I sent it you to-day in a\nbill of four thousand pound: a great deal of money, brother Foresight.\n\nFORE.  Ay, indeed, Sir Sampson, a great deal of money for a young man; I\nwonder what he can do with it!\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, so do I.  Hark ye, Valentine, if there be too\nmuch, refund the superfluity; dost hear, boy?\n\nVAL.  Superfluity, sir?  It will scarce pay my debts.  I hope you will\nhave more indulgence than to oblige me to those hard conditions which my\nnecessity signed to.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Sir, how, I beseech you, what were you pleased to intimate,\nconcerning indulgence?\n\nVAL.  Why, sir, that you would not go to the extremity of the conditions,\nbut release me at least from some part.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Oh, sir, I understand you\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all, ha?\n\nVAL.  Yes, sir, all that I presume to ask.  But what you, out of fatherly\nfondness, will be pleased to add, shall be doubly welcome.\n\nSIR SAMP.  No doubt of it, sweet sir; but your filial piety, and my\nfatherly fondness would fit like two tallies.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rogue, brother\nForesight, makes a bargain under hand and seal in the morning, and would\nbe released from it in the afternoon; here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rogue, dog, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nconscience and honesty; this is your wit now, this is the morality of\nyour wits!  You are a wit, and have been a beau, and may be a\u00e2\u0080\u0094why sirrah,\nis it not here under hand and seal\u00e2\u0080\u0094can you deny it?\n\nVAL.  Sir, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny it.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Sirrah, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be hanged; I shall live to see you go up\nHolborn Hill.  Has he not a rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face?  Speak brother, you understand\nphysiognomy, a hanging look to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094of all my boys the most unlike me; he\nhas a damned Tyburn face, without the benefit o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the clergy.\n\nFORE.  Hum\u00e2\u0080\u0094truly I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to discourage a young man,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he has a violent\ndeath in his face; but I hope no danger of hanging.\n\nVAL.  Sir, is this usage for your son?\u00e2\u0080\u0094For that old weather-headed fool,\nI know how to laugh at him; but you, sir\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSIR SAMP.  You, sir; and you, sir: why, who are you, sir?\n\nVAL.  Your son, sir.\n\nSIR SAMP.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than I know, sir, and I believe not.\n\nVAL.  Faith, I hope not.\n\nSIR SAMP.  What, would you have your mother a whore?  Did you ever hear\nthe like?  Did you ever hear the like?  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  I would have an excuse for your barbarity and unnatural usage.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Excuse!  Impudence!  Why, sirrah, mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I do what I please?\nAre not you my slave?  Did not I beget you?  And might not I have chosen\nwhether I would have begot you or no?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oons, who are you?  Whence came\nyou?  What brought you into the world?  How came you here, sir?  Here, to\nstand here, upon those two legs, and look erect with that audacious face,\nha?  Answer me that!  Did you come a volunteer into the world?  Or did I,\nwith the lawful authority of a parent, press you to the service?\n\nVAL.  I know no more why I came than you do why you called me.  But here\nI am, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to provide for me, I desire you would leave\nme as you found me.\n\nSIR SAMP.  With all my heart: come, uncase, strip, and go naked out of\nthe world as you came into \u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nVAL.  My clothes are soon put off.  But you must also divest me of\nreason, thought, passions, inclinations, affections, appetites, senses,\nand the huge train of attendants that you begot along with me.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, what a manyheaded monster have I propagated!\n\nVAL.  I am of myself, a plain, easy, simple creature, and to be kept at\nsmall expense; but the retinue that you gave me are craving and\ninvincible; they are so many devils that you have raised, and will have\nemployment.\n\nSIR SAMP.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oons, what had I to do to get children,\u00e2\u0080\u0094can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a private man\nbe born without all these followers?  Why, nothing under an emperor\nshould be born with appetites.  Why, at this rate, a fellow that has but\na groat in his pocket may have a stomach capable of a ten shilling\nordinary.\n\nJERE.  Nay, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as clear as the sun; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make oath of it before any\njustice in Middlesex.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cormorant too.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099S\u00e2\u0080\u0099heart this fellow was not born\nwith you?  I did not beget him, did I?\n\nJERE.  By the provision that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made for me, you might have begot me too.\nNay, and to tell your worship another truth, I believe you did, for I\nfind I was born with those same whoreson appetites too, that my master\nspeaks of.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Why, look you there, now.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll maintain it, that by the rule\nof right reason, this fellow ought to have been born without a palate.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099S\u00e2\u0080\u0099heart, what should he do with a distinguishing taste?  I warrant now\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather eat a pheasant, than a piece of poor John; and smell, now,\nwhy I warrant he can smell, and loves perfumes above a stink.  Why\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it; and music, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you love music, scoundrel?\n\nJERE.  Yes; I have a reasonable good ear, sir, as to jigs and country\ndances, and the like; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much matter your solos or sonatas, they\ngive me the spleen.\n\nSIR SAMP.  The spleen, ha, ha, ha; a pox confound you\u00e2\u0080\u0094solos or sonatas?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Oons, whose son are you?  How were you engendered, muckworm?\n\nJERE.  I am by my father, the son of a chair-man; my mother sold oysters\nin winter, and cucumbers in summer; and I came upstairs into the world;\nfor I was born in a cellar.\n\nFORE.  By your looks, you should go upstairs out of the world too,\nfriend.\n\nSIR SAMP.  And if this rogue were anatomized now, and dissected, he has\nhis vessels of digestion and concoction, and so forth, large enough for\nthe inside of a cardinal, this son of a cucumber.\u00e2\u0080\u0094These things are\nunaccountable and unreasonable.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, why was not I a bear, that\nmy cubs might have lived upon sucking their paws?  Nature has been\nprovident only to bears and spiders; the one has its nutriment in his own\nhands; and t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other spins his habitation out of his own entrails.\n\nVAL.  Fortune was provident enough to supply all the necessities of my\nnature, if I had my right of inheritance.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Again!  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oons, han\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you four thousand pounds?  If I had it\nagain, I would not give thee a groat.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What, would\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou have me turn\npelican, and feed thee out of my own vitals?  S\u00e2\u0080\u0099heart, live by your wits:\nyou were always fond of the wits, now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see, if you have wit enough\nto keep yourself.  Your brother will be in town to-night or to-morrow\nmorning, and then look you perform covenants, and so your friend and\nservant:\u00e2\u0080\u0094come, brother Foresight.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                            VALENTINE, JEREMY.\n\nJERE.  I told you what your visit would come to.\n\nVAL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis as much as I expected.  I did not come to see him, I came to\nsee Angelica: but since she was gone abroad, it was easily turned another\nway, and at least looked well on my side.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here?  Mrs. Foresight\nand Mrs. Frail, they are earnest.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll avoid \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  Come this way, and go\nand enquire when Angelica will return.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                     MRS. FORESIGHT _and_ MRS. FRAIL.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  What have you to do to watch me?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099S\u00e2\u0080\u0099life I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do what I\nplease.\n\nMRS. FORE.  You will?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Yes, marry will I.  A great piece of business to go to\nCovent Garden Square in a hackney coach, and take a turn with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfriend.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Nay, two or three turns, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my oath.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, what if I took twenty\u00e2\u0080\u0094I warrant if you had been there,\nit had been only innocent recreation.  Lord, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the comfort of this\nlife if we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the happiness of conversing where we like?\n\nMRS. FORE.  But can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you converse at home?  I own it, I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no\nhappiness like conversing with an agreeable man; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quarrel at that,\nnor I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think but your conversation was very innocent; but the place\nis public, and to be seen with a man in a hackney coach is scandalous.\nWhat if anybody else should have seen you alight, as I did?  How can\nanybody be happy while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in perpetual fear of being seen and\ncensured?  Besides, it would not only reflect upon you, sister, but me.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Pooh, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clutter: why should it reflect upon you?  I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doubt but you have thought yourself happy in a hackney coach before\nnow.  If I had gone to Knight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bridge, or to Chelsea, or to Spring\nGarden, or Barn Elms with a man alone, something might have been said.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Why, was I ever in any of those places?  What do you mean,\nsister?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Was I?  What do you mean?\n\nMRS. FORE.  You have been at a worse place.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I at a worse place, and with a man!\n\nMRS. FORE.  I suppose you would not go alone to the World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s End.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  The World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s End!  What, do you mean to banter me?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Poor innocent!  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a place called\nthe World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s End?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you can keep your countenance purely: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nmake an admirable player.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you have a great deal of confidence, and in my\nmind too much for the stage.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Very well, that will appear who has most; you never were at\nthe World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s End?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No.\n\nMRS. FORE.  You deny it positively to my face?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Your face, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your face?\n\nMRS. FORE.  No matter for that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as good a face as yours.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Not by a dozen years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wearing.  But I do deny it positively\nto your face, then.\n\nMRS. FORE.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll allow you now to find fault with my face; for I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear\nyour impudence has put me out of countenance.  But look you here now,\nwhere did you lose this gold bodkin?  Oh, sister, sister!\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  My bodkin!\n\nMRS. FORE.  Nay, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis yours, look at it.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, if you go to that, where did you find this bodkin?\nOh, sister, sister!  Sister every way.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh, devil on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that I could not discover her without\nbetraying myself.  [_Aside_.]\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I have heard gentlemen say, sister, that one should take\ngreat care, when one makes a thrust in fencing, not to lie open oneself.\n\nMRS. FORE.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very true, sister.  Well, since all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out, and as you\nsay, since we are both wounded, let us do what is often done in duels,\ntake care of one another, and grow better friends than before.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  With all my heart: ours are but slight flesh wounds, and if\nwe keep \u00e2\u0080\u0099em from air, not at all dangerous.  Well, give me your hand in\ntoken of sisterly secrecy and affection.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Here \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis, with all my heart.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, as an earnest of friendship and confidence, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nacquaint you with a design that I have.  To tell truth, and speak openly\none to another, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid the world have observed us more than we have\nobserved one another.  You have a rich husband, and are provided for.  I\nam at a loss, and have no great stock either of fortune or reputation,\nand therefore must look sharply about me.  Sir Sampson has a son that is\nexpected to-night, and by the account I have heard of his education, can\nbe no conjurer.  The estate you know is to be made over to him.  Now if I\ncould wheedle him, sister, ha?  You understand me?\n\nMRS. FORE.  I do, and will help you to the utmost of my power.  And I can\ntell you one thing that falls out luckily enough; my awkward\ndaughter-in-law, who you know is designed to be his wife, is grown fond\nof Mr. Tattle; now if we can improve that, and make her have an aversion\nfor the booby, it may go a great way towards his liking you.  Here they\ncome together; and let us contrive some way or other to leave \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\ntogether.\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n                   [_To them_] TATTLE _and_ MISS PRUE.\n\nMISS.  Mother, mother, mother, look you here!\n\nMRS. FORE.  Fie, fie, Miss, how you bawl!  Besides, I have told you, you\nmust not call me mother.\n\nMISS.  What must I call you then, are you not my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Madam; you must say madam.  By my soul, I shall fancy myself\nold indeed to have this great girl call me mother.  Well, but Miss, what\nare you so overjoyed at?\n\nMISS.  Look you here, madam, then, what Mr. Tattle has given me.  Look\nyou here, cousin, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a snuff-box; nay, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snuff in\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  Here,\nwill you have any?  Oh, good!  How sweet it is.  Mr. Tattle is all over\nsweet, his peruke is sweet, and his gloves are sweet, and his\nhandkerchief is sweet, pure sweet, sweeter than roses.  Smell him,\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0094madam, I mean.  He gave me this ring for a kiss.\n\nTATT.  O fie, Miss, you must not kiss and tell.\n\nMISS.  Yes; I may tell my mother.  And he says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give me something to\nmake me smell so.  Oh, pray lend me your handkerchief.  Smell, cousin; he\nsays he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give me something that will make my smocks smell this way.  Is\nnot it pure?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than lavender, mun.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m resolved I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let\nnurse put any more lavender among my smocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094ha, cousin?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Fie, Miss; amongst your linen, you must say.  You must never\nsay smock.\n\nMISS.  Why, it is not bawdy, is it, cousin?\n\nTATT.  Oh, madam; you are too severe upon Miss; you must not find fault\nwith her pretty simplicity: it becomes her strangely.  Pretty Miss, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet \u00e2\u0080\u0099em persuade you out of your innocency.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh, demm you toad.  I wish you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t persuade her out of her\ninnocency.\n\nTATT.  Who, I, madam?  O Lord, how can your ladyship have such a thought?\nSure, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know me.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Ah devil, sly devil.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as close, sister, as a confessor.\nHe thinks we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t observe him.\n\nMRS. FORE.  A cunning cur, how soon he could find out a fresh, harmless\ncreature; and left us, sister, presently.\n\nTATT.  Upon reputation\n\nMRS. FORE.  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all so, sister, these men.  They love to have the\nspoiling of a young thing, they are as fond of it, as of being first in\nthe fashion, or of seeing a new play the first day.  I warrant it would\nbreak Mr. Tattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart to think that anybody else should be beforehand\nwith him.\n\nTATT.  O Lord, I swear I would not for the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O hang you; who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll believe you?  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be hanged before\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d confess.  We know you\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very pretty!  Lord, what pure red and\nwhite!\u00e2\u0080\u0094she looks so wholesome; ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er stir: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, but I fancy, if\nI were a man\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMISS.  How you love to jeer one, cousin.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Hark\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee, sister, by my soul the girl is spoiled already.\nD\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever endure a great lubberly tarpaulin?  Gad, I warrant\nyou she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him come near her after Mr. Tattle.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O my soul, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid not\u00e2\u0080\u0094eh!\u00e2\u0080\u0094filthy creature, that smells\nall of pitch and tar.  Devil take you, you confounded toad\u00e2\u0080\u0094why did you\nsee her before she was married?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Nay, why did we let him\u00e2\u0080\u0094my husband will hang us.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll think\nwe brought \u00e2\u0080\u0099em acquainted.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Come, faith, let us be gone.  If my brother Foresight should\nfind us with them, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think so, sure enough.\n\nMRS. FORE.  So he would\u00e2\u0080\u0094but then leaving them together is as bad: and\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a sly devil, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never miss an opportunity.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care; I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be seen in\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Well, if you should, Mr. Tattle, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a world to\nanswer for; remember I wash my hands of it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thoroughly innocent.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n                            TATTLE, MISS PRUE.\n\nMISS.  What makes \u00e2\u0080\u0099em go away, Mr. Tattle?  What do they mean, do you\nknow?\n\nTATT.  Yes my dear; I think I can guess, but hang me if I know the reason\nof it.\n\nMISS.  Come, must not we go too?\n\nTATT.  No, no, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that.\n\nMISS.  No!  What then?  What shall you and I do together?\n\nTATT.  I must make love to you, pretty Miss; will you let me make love to\nyou?\n\nMISS.  Yes, if you please.\n\nTATT.  Frank, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099Gad, at least.  What a pox does Mrs. Foresight mean by\nthis civility?  Is it to make a fool of me?  Or does she leave us\ntogether out of good morality, and do as she would be done by?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nunderstand it so.  [_Aside_.]\n\nMISS.  Well; and how will you make love to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094come, I long to have you\nbegin,\u00e2\u0080\u0094must I make love too?  You must tell me how.\n\nTATT.  You must let me speak, Miss, you must not speak first; I must ask\nyou questions, and you must answer.\n\nMISS.  What, is it like the catechism?  Come then, ask me.\n\nTATT.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think you can love me?\n\nMISS.  Yes.\n\nTATT.  Pooh, pox, you must not say yes already; I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care a farthing\nfor you then in a twinkling.\n\nMISS.  What must I say then?\n\nTATT.  Why you must say no, or you believe not, or you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMISS.  Why, must I tell a lie then?\n\nTATT.  Yes, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be well bred.  All well bred persons lie.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Besides,\nyou are a woman, you must never speak what you think: your words must\ncontradict your thoughts; but your actions may contradict your words.  So\nwhen I ask you if you can love me, you must say no, but you must love me\ntoo.  If I tell you you are handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter\nyou.  But you must think yourself more charming than I speak you: and\nlike me, for the beauty which I say you have, as much as if I had it\nmyself.  If I ask you to kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not\nrefuse me.  If I ask you for more, you must be more angry,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but more\ncomplying; and as soon as ever I make you say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cry out, you must be\nsure to hold your tongue.\n\nMISS.  O Lord, I swear this is pure.  I like it better than our\nold-fashioned country way of speaking one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and must not you lie\ntoo?\n\nTATT.  Hum\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you must believe I speak truth.\n\nMISS.  O Gemini!  Well, I always had a great mind to tell lies; but they\nfrighted me, and said it was a sin.\n\nTATT.  Well, my pretty creature; will you make me happy by giving me a\nkiss?\n\nMISS.  No, indeed; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m angry at you.  [_Runs and kisses him_.]\n\nTATT.  Hold, hold, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty well, but you should not have given it\nme, but have suffered me to have taken it.\n\nMISS.  Well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it again.\n\nTATT.  With all my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now then, my little angel.  [_Kisses her_.]\n\nMISS.  Pish.\n\nTATT.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right,\u00e2\u0080\u0094again, my charmer.  [_Kisses again_.]\n\nMISS.  O fie, nay, now I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abide you.\n\nTATT.  Admirable!  That was as well as if you had been born and bred in\nCovent Garden.  And won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you shew me, pretty miss, where your\nbed-chamber is?\n\nMISS.  No, indeed won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run there, and hide myself from you\nbehind the curtains.\n\nTATT.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll follow you.\n\nMISS.  Ah, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold the door with both hands, and be angry;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you\nshall push me down before you come in.\n\nTATT.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come in first, and push you down afterwards.\n\nMISS.  Will you?  Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be more angry and more complying.\n\nTATT.  Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make you cry out.\n\nMISS.  Oh, but you shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, for I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold my tongue.\n\nTATT.  O my dear apt scholar!\n\nMISS.  Well, now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run and make more haste than you.\n\nTATT.  You shall not fly so fast, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pursue.\n\n\n\n\nACT III.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                              NURSE _alone_.\n\nNURSE.  Miss, Miss, Miss Prue!  Mercy on me, marry and amen.  Why, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbecome of the child?  Why Miss, Miss Foresight!  Sure she has locked\nherself up in her chamber, and gone to sleep, or to prayers: Miss,\nMiss,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hear her.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come to your father, child; open the door.  Open the\ndoor, Miss.  I hear you cry husht.  O Lord, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there? [_peeps_]\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here to do?  O the Father!  A man with her!  Why, miss, I say;\nGod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my life, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine doings towards\u00e2\u0080\u0094O Lord, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all undone.  O\nyou young harlotry [_knocks_].  Od\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my life, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you open the door?\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come in the back way.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                            TATTLE, MISS PRUE.\n\nMISS.  O Lord, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell my father; what shall I do\nnow?\n\nTATT.  Pox take her; if she had stayed two minutes longer, I should have\nwished for her coming.\n\nMISS.  O dear, what shall I say?  Tell me, Mr. Tattle, tell me a lie.\n\nTATT.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no occasion for a lie; I could never tell a lie to no\npurpose.  But since we have done nothing, we must say nothing, I think.\nI hear her,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave you together, and come off as you can.  [_Thrusts\nher in_, _and shuts the door_.]\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                  TATTLE, VALENTINE, SCANDAL, ANGELICA.\n\nANG.  You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accuse me of inconstancy; I never told you that I loved\nyou.\n\nVAL.  But I can accuse you of uncertainty, for not telling me whether you\ndid or not.\n\nANG.  You mistake indifference for uncertainty; I never had concern\nenough to ask myself the question.\n\nSCAN.  Nor good-nature enough to answer him that did ask you; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say\nthat for you, madam.\n\nANG.  What, are you setting up for good-nature?\n\nSCAN.  Only for the affectation of it, as the women do for ill-nature.\n\nANG.  Persuade your friend that it is all affectation.\n\nSCAN.  I shall receive no benefit from the opinion; for I know no\neffectual difference between continued affectation and reality.\n\nTATT.  [_coming up_].   Scandal, are you in private discourse?  Anything\nof secrecy?  [_Aside to_ SCANDAL.]\n\nSCAN.  Yes, but I dare trust you; we were talking of Angelica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love to\nValentine.  You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak of it.\n\nTATT.  No, no, not a syllable.  I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a secret, for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwhispered everywhere.\n\nSCAN.  Ha, ha, ha!\n\nANG.  What is, Mr. Tattle?  I heard you say something was whispered\neverywhere.\n\nSCAN.  Your love of Valentine.\n\nANG.  How!\n\nTATT.  No, madam, his love for your ladyship.  Gad take me, I beg your\npardon,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I never heard a word of your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion till this\ninstant.\n\nANG.  My passion!  And who told you of my passion, pray sir?\n\nSCAN.  Why, is the devil in you?  Did not I tell it you for a secret?\n\nTATT.  Gadso; but I thought she might have been trusted with her own\naffairs.\n\nSCAN.  Is that your discretion?  Trust a woman with herself?\n\nTATT.  You say true, I beg your pardon.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring all off.  It was\nimpossible, madam, for me to imagine that a person of your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wit\nand gallantry could have so long received the passionate addresses of the\naccomplished Valentine, and yet remain insensible; therefore you will\npardon me, if, from a just weight of his merit, with your ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\njudgment, I formed the balance of a reciprocal affection.\n\nVAL.  O the devil, what damned costive poet has given thee this lesson of\nfustian to get by rote?\n\nANG.  I dare swear you wrong him, it is his own.  And Mr. Tattle only\njudges of the success of others, from the effects of his own merit.  For\ncertainly Mr. Tattle was never denied anything in his life.\n\nTATT.  O Lord!  Yes, indeed, madam, several times.\n\nANG.  I swear I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis possible.\n\nTATT.  Yes, I vow and swear I have; Lord, madam, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the most unfortunate\nman in the world, and the most cruelly used by the ladies.\n\nANG.  Nay, now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ungrateful.\n\nTATT.  No, I hope not, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as much ingratitude to own some favours as to\nconceal others.\n\nVAL.  There, now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out.\n\nANG.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand you now.  I thought you had never asked anything\nbut what a lady might modestly grant, and you confess.\n\nSCAN.  So faith, your business is done here; now you may go brag\nsomewhere else.\n\nTATT.  Brag!  O heavens!  Why, did I name anybody?\n\nANG.  No; I suppose that is not in your power; but you would if you\ncould, no doubt on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nTATT.  Not in my power, madam!  What, does your ladyship mean that I have\nno woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation in my power?\n\nSCAN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oons, why, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t own it, will you?  [_Aside_.]\n\nTATT.  Faith, madam, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the right; no more I have, as I hope to be\nsaved; I never had it in my power to say anything to a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prejudice\nin my life.  For as I was telling you, madam, I have been the most\nunsuccessful creature living, in things of that nature; and never had the\ngood fortune to be trusted once with a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secret, not once.\n\nANG.  No?\n\nVAL.  Not once, I dare answer for him.\n\nSCAN.  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll answer for him; for I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure if he had, he would have\ntold me; I find, madam, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Mr. Tattle.\n\nTATT.  No indeed, madam, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know me at all, I find.  For sure my\nintimate friends would have known\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nANG.  Then it seems you would have told, if you had been trusted.\n\nTATT.  O pox, Scandal, that was too far put.  Never have told\nparticulars, madam.  Perhaps I might have talked as of a third person; or\nhave introduced an amour of my own, in conversation, by way of novel; but\nnever have explained particulars.\n\nANG.  But whence comes the reputation of Mr. Tattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secrecy, if he was\nnever trusted?\n\nSCAN.  Why, thence it arises\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thing is proverbially spoken; but may be\napplied to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094as if we should say in general terms, he only is secret\nwho never was trusted; a satirical proverb upon our sex.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another\nupon yours\u00e2\u0080\u0094as she is chaste, who was never asked the question.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall.\n\nVAL.  A couple of very civil proverbs, truly.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis hard to tell whether\nthe lady or Mr. Tattle be the more obliged to you.  For you found her\nvirtue upon the backwardness of the men; and his secrecy upon the\nmistrust of the women.\n\nTATT.  Gad, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very true, madam, I think we are obliged to acquit\nourselves.  And for my part\u00e2\u0080\u0094but your ladyship is to speak first.\n\nANG.  Am I?  Well, I freely confess I have resisted a great deal of\ntemptation.\n\nTATT.  And i\u00e2\u0080\u0099Gad, I have given some temptation that has not been\nresisted.\n\nVAL.  Good.\n\nANG.  I cite Valentine here, to declare to the court, how fruitless he\nhas found his endeavours, and to confess all his solicitations and my\ndenials.\n\nVAL.  I am ready to plead not guilty for you; and guilty for myself.\n\nSCAN.  So, why this is fair, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demonstration with a witness.\n\nTATT.  Well, my witnesses are not present.  But I confess I have had\nfavours from persons.  But as the favours are numberless, so the persons\nare nameless.\n\nSCAN.  Pooh, this proves nothing.\n\nTATT.  No?  I can show letters, lockets, pictures, and rings; and if\nthere be occasion for witnesses, I can summon the maids at the\nchocolate-houses, all the porters at Pall Mall and Covent Garden, the\ndoor-keepers at the Playhouse, the drawers at Locket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Pontack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the\nRummer, Spring Garden, my own landlady and _valet de chambre_; all who\nshall make oath that I receive more letters than the Secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office,\nand that I have more vizor-masks to enquire for me, than ever went to see\nthe Hermaphrodite, or the Naked Prince.  And it is notorious that in a\ncountry church once, an enquiry being made who I was, it was answered, I\nwas the famous Tattle, who had ruined so many women.\n\nVAL.  It was there, I suppose, you got the nickname of the Great Turk.\n\nTATT.  True; I was called Turk-Tattle all over the parish.  The next\nSunday all the old women kept their daughters at home, and the parson had\nnot half his congregation.  He would have brought me into the spiritual\ncourt, but I was revenged upon him, for he had a handsome daughter whom I\ninitiated into the science.  But I repented it afterwards, for it was\ntalked of in town.  And a lady of quality that shall be nameless, in a\nraging fit of jealousy, came down in her coach and six horses, and\nexposed herself upon my account; Gad, I was sorry for it with all my\nheart.  You know whom I mean\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know where we raffled\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  Mum, Tattle.\n\nVAL.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, are not you ashamed?\n\nANG.  O barbarous!  I never heard so insolent a piece of vanity.  Fie,\nMr. Tattle; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear I could not have believed it.  Is this your\nsecrecy?\n\nTATT.  Gadso, the heat of my story carried me beyond my discretion, as\nthe heat of the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion hurried her beyond her reputation.  But I\nhope you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whom I mean; for there was a great many ladies\nraffled.  Pox on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, now could I bite off my tongue.\n\nSCAN.  No, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; for then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell us no more.  Come, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll recommend\na song to you upon the hint of my two proverbs, and I see one in the next\nroom that will sing it.  [_Goes to the door_.]\n\nTATT.  For heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, if you do guess, say nothing; Gad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very\nunfortunate.\n\nSCAN.  Pray sing the first song in the last new play.\n\n                                  SONG.\n                         Set by Mr. John Eccles.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   A nymph and a swain to Apollo once prayed,\n   The swain had been jilted, the nymph been betrayed:\n   Their intent was to try if his oracle knew\n   E\u00e2\u0080\u0099er a nymph that was chaste, or a swain that was true.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   Apollo was mute, and had like t\u00e2\u0080\u0099have been posed,\n   But sagely at length he this secret disclosed:\n   He alone won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t betray in whom none will confide,\n   And the nymph may be chaste that has never been tried.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n      [_To them_] SIR SAMPSON, MRS. FRAIL, MISS PRUE, _and_ SERVANT.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Is Ben come?  Odso, my son Ben come?  Odd, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nWhere is he?  I long to see him.  Now, Mrs. Frail, you shall see my son\nBen.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hopes of my family.  I han\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen him these\nthree years\u00e2\u0080\u0094I warrant he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown.  Call him in, bid him make haste.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nready to cry for joy.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Now Miss, you shall see your husband.\n\nMISS.  Pish, he shall be none of my husband.  [_Aside to Frail_.]\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Hush.  Well he shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; leave that to me.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beckon Mr.\nTattle to us.\n\nANG.  Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you stay and see your brother?\n\nVAL.  We are the twin stars, and cannot shine in one sphere; when he\nrises I must set.  Besides, if I should stay, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know but my father\nin good nature may press me to the immediate signing the deed of\nconveyance of my estate; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll defer it as long as I can.  Well,\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to a resolution.\n\nANG.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  Resolution must come to me, or I shall never have one.\n\nSCAN.  Come, Valentine, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go with you; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve something in my head to\ncommunicate to you.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n          ANGELICA, SIR SAMPSON, TATTLE, MRS. FRAIL, MISS PRUE.\n\nSIR SAMP.  What, is my son Valentine gone?  What, is he sneaked off, and\nwould not see his brother?  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unnatural whelp!  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an\nill-natured dog!  What, were you here too, madam, and could not keep him?\nCould neither love, nor duty, nor natural affection oblige him?  Odsbud,\nmadam, have no more to say to him, he is not worth your consideration.\nThe rogue has not a drachm of generous love about him\u00e2\u0080\u0094all interest, all\ninterest; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an undone scoundrel, and courts your estate: body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me,\nhe does not care a doit for your person.\n\nANG.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty even with him, Sir Sampson; for if ever I could have\nliked anything in him, it should have been his estate too; but since\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone, the bait\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off, and the naked hook appears.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Odsbud, well spoken, and you are a wiser woman than I thought\nyou were, for most young women now-a-days are to be tempted with a naked\nhook.\n\nANG.  If I marry, Sir Sampson, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m for a good estate with any man, and\nfor any man with a good estate; therefore, if I were obliged to make a\nchoice, I declare I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather have you than your son.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Faith and troth, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a wise woman, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad to hear you\nsay so; I was afraid you were in love with the reprobate.  Odd, I was\nsorry for you with all my heart.  Hang him, mongrel, cast him off; you\nshall see the rogue show himself, and make love to some desponding Cadua\nof fourscore for sustenance.  Odd, I love to see a young spendthrift\nforced to cling to an old woman for support, like ivy round a dead oak;\nfaith I do, I love to see \u00e2\u0080\u0099em hug and cotton together, like down upon a\nthistle.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                  [_To them_] BEN LEGEND _and_ SERVANT.\n\nBEN.

So, so, enough, father, Mess, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather kiss these gentlewomen.\n\nSIR SAMP.  And so thou shalt.  Mrs. Angelica, my son Ben.\n\nBEN.  Forsooth, if you please.  [_Salutes her_.]  Nay, mistress, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not\nfor dropping anchor here; about ship, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith.  [_Kisses Frail_.]  Nay,\nand you too, my little cock-boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094so [_Kisses Miss_].\n\nTATT.  Sir, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welcome ashore.\n\nBEN.  Thank you, thank you, friend.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Thou hast been many a weary league, Ben, since I saw thee.\n\nBEN.  Ay, ay, been!  Been far enough, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that be all.  Well, father, and\nhow do all at home?  How does brother Dick, and brother Val?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0094body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dick has been dead these two years.  I writ\nyou word when you were at Leghorn.\n\nBEN.  Mess, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true; marry!  I had forgot.  Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead, as you say.\nWell, and how?  I have a many questions to ask you.  Well, you ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmarried again, father, be you?\n\nSIR SAMP.  No; I intend you shall marry, Ben; I would not marry for thy\nsake.\n\nBEN.  Nay, what does that signify?  An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you marry again\u00e2\u0080\u0094why then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go\nto sea again, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one for t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that be all.  Pray don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet me be your hindrance\u00e2\u0080\u0094e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en marry a God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, an the wind sit that\nway.  As for my part, mayhap I have no mind to marry.\n\nFRAIL.  That would be pity\u00e2\u0080\u0094such a handsome young gentleman.\n\nBEN.  Handsome! he, he, he! nay, forsooth, an you be for joking, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\njoke with you, for I love my jest, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the ship were sinking, as we sayn\nat sea.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you why I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much stand towards matrimony.  I\nlove to roam about from port to port, and from land to land; I could\nnever abide to be port-bound, as we call it.  Now, a man that is married\nhas, as it were, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, his feet in the bilboes, and mayhap mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get\nthem out again when he would.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wag.\n\nBEN.  A man that is married, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, is no more like another man than a\ngalley-slave is like one of us free sailors; he is chained to an oar all\nhis life, and mayhap forced to tug a leaky vessel into the bargain.\n\nSIR SAMP.  A very wag\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very wag; only a little rough, he wants a\nlittle polishing.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Not at all; I like his humour mightily: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plain and\nhonest\u00e2\u0080\u0094I should like such a humour in a husband extremely.\n\nBEN.  Say\u00e2\u0080\u0099n you so, forsooth?  Marry, and I should like such a handsome\ngentlewoman for a bed-fellow hugely.  How say you, mistress, would you\nlike going to sea?  Mess, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a tight vessel, an well rigged, an you\nwere but as well manned.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  I should not doubt that if you were master of me.\n\nBEN.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you one thing, an you come to sea in a high wind, or\nthat lady\u00e2\u0080\u0094you may\u00e2\u0080\u0099nt carry so much sail o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your head\u00e2\u0080\u0094top and top gallant,\nby the mess.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No, why so?\n\nBEN.  Why, an you do, you may run the risk to be overset, and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ncarry your keels above water, he, he, he!\n\nANG.  I swear, Mr. Benjamin is the veriest wag in nature\u00e2\u0080\u0094an absolute\nsea-wit.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Nay, Ben has parts, but as I told you before, they want a\nlittle polishing.  You must not take anything ill, madam.\n\nBEN.  No, I hope the gentlewoman is not angry; I mean all in good part,\nfor if I give a jest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a jest, and so forsooth you may be as\nfree with me.\n\nANG.  I thank you, sir, I am not at all offended.  But methinks, Sir\nSampson, you should leave him alone with his mistress.  Mr. Tattle, we\nmust not hinder lovers.\n\nTATT.  Well, Miss, I have your promise.  [_Aside to Miss_.]\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, madam, you say true.  Look you, Ben, this is your\nmistress.  Come, Miss, you must not be shame-faced; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave you\ntogether.\n\nMISS.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abide to be left alone; mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my cousin stay with me?\n\nSIR SAMP.  No, no.  Come, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s away.\n\nBEN.  Look you, father, mayhap the young woman mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a liking to\nme.\n\nSIR SAMP.  I warrant thee, boy: come, come, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll venture\nthat.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                          BEN, _and_ MISS PRUE.\n\nBEN.  Come mistress, will you please to sit down? for an you stand a\nstern a that\u00e2\u0080\u0099n, we shall never grapple together.  Come, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll haul a\nchair; there, an you please to sit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sit by you.\n\nMISS.  You need not sit so near one, if you have anything to say, I can\nhear you farther off, I an\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deaf.\n\nBEN.  Why that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, as you say, nor I an\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dumb, I can be heard as far\nas another,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll heave off, to please you.  [_Sits farther off_.]  An we\nwere a league asunder, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d undertake to hold discourse with you, an\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twere not a main high wind indeed, and full in my teeth.  Look you,\nforsooth, I am, as it were, bound for the land of matrimony; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a\nvoyage, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, that was none of my seeking.  I was commanded by\nfather, and if you like of it, mayhap I may steer into your harbour.  How\nsay you, mistress?  The short of the thing is, that if you like me, and I\nlike you, we may chance to swing in a hammock together.\n\nMISS.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to say to you, nor I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to speak with\nyou at all.\n\nBEN.  No?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry for that.  But pray why are you so scornful?\n\nMISS.  As long as one must not speak one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, one had better not speak\nat all, I think, and truly I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell a lie for the matter.\n\nBEN.  Nay, you say true in that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but a folly to lie: for to speak\none thing, and to think just the contrary way is, as it were, to look one\nway, and to row another.  Now, for my part, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m for carrying\nthings above board, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not for keeping anything under hatches,\u00e2\u0080\u0094so that\nif you ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as willing as I, say so a God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name: there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no harm done;\nmayhap you may be shame-faced; some maidens thof they love a man well\nenough, yet they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to tell\u00e2\u0080\u0099n so to\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case,\nwhy, silence gives consent.\n\nMISS.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it is not so, for I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll speak sooner than you should\nbelieve that; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll speak truth, though one should always tell a lie\nto a man; and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care, let my father do what he will; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too big to\nbe whipt, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you plainly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like you, nor love you at\nall, nor never will, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more: so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your answer for you; and\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trouble me no more, you ugly thing.\n\nBEN.  Look you, young woman, you may learn to give good words, however.\nI spoke you fair, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, and civil.  As for your love or your liking,\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t value it of a rope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end; and mayhap I like you as little as you\ndo me: what I said was in obedience to father.  Gad, I fear a whipping no\nmore than you do.  But I tell you one thing, if you should give such\nlanguage at sea, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have a cat o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nine tails laid cross your\nshoulders.  Flesh! who are you?  You heard t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other handsome young woman\nspeak civilly to me of her own accord.  Whatever you think of yourself,\ngad, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you are any more to compare to her than a can of\nsmall-beer to a bowl of punch.\n\nMISS.  Well, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a handsome gentleman, and a fine gentleman, and\na sweet gentleman, that was here that loves me, and I love him; and if he\nsees you speak to me any more, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll thrash your jacket for you, he will,\nyou great sea-calf.\n\nBEN.  What, do you mean that fair-weather spark that was here just now?\nWill he thrash my jacket?  Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099n,\u00e2\u0080\u0094let\u00e2\u0080\u0099n.  But an he comes near me, mayhap\nI may giv\u00e2\u0080\u0099n a salt eel for\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supper, for all that.  What does father mean\nto leave me alone as soon as I come home with such a dirty dowdy?\nSea-calf?  I an\u00e2\u0080\u0099t calf enough to lick your chalked face, you cheese-curd\nyou:\u00e2\u0080\u0094marry thee?  Oons, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry a Lapland witch as soon, and live upon\nselling contrary winds and wrecked vessels.\n\nMISS.  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be called names, nor I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be abused thus, so I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nIf I were a man [_cries_]\u00e2\u0080\u0094you durst not talk at his rate.  No, you durst\nnot, you stinking tar-barrel.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n               [_To them_] MRS. FORESIGHT _and_ MRS. FRAIL.\n\nMRS. FORE.  They have quarrelled, just as we could wish.\n\nBEN.  Tar-barrel?  Let your sweetheart there call me so, if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take\nyour part, your Tom Essence, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say something to him; gad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nlace his musk-doublet for him, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make him stink: he shall smell more\nlike a weasel than a civet-cat, afore I ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 done with \u00e2\u0080\u0099en.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Bless me, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter, Miss?  What, does she cry?  Mr.\nBenjamin, what have you done to her?\n\nBEN.  Let her cry: the more she cries the less she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u0094she has been\ngathering foul weather in her mouth, and now it rains out at her eyes.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Come, Miss, come along with me, and tell me, poor child.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Lord, what shall we do?  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my brother Foresight and\nSir Sampson coming.  Sister, do you take Miss down into the parlour, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll carry Mr. Benjamin into my chamber, for they must not know that they\nare fallen out.  Come, sir, will you venture yourself with me?  [_Looking\nkindly on him_.]\n\nBEN.  Venture, mess, and that I will, though \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere to sea in a storm.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                       SIR SAMPSON _and_ FORESIGHT.\n\nSIR SAMP.  I left \u00e2\u0080\u0099em together here; what, are they gone?  Ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brisk\nboy: he has got her into a corner; father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own son, faith, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll touzle\nher, and mouzle her.  The rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharp set, coming from sea; if he\nshould not stay for saving grace, old Foresight, but fall to without the\nhelp of a parson, ha?  Odd, if he should I could not be angry with him;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twould be but like me, a chip of the old block.  Ha! thou\u00e2\u0080\u0099rt\nmelancholic, old Prognostication; as melancholic as if thou hadst spilt\nthe salt, or pared thy nails on a Sunday.  Come, cheer up, look about\nthee: look up, old stargazer.  Now is he poring upon the ground for a\ncrooked pin, or an old horse-nail, with the head towards him.\n\nFORE.  Sir Sampson, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the wedding to-morrow morning.\n\nSIR SAMP.  With all my heart.\n\nFORE.  At ten a\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, punctually at ten.\n\nSIR SAMP.  To a minute, to a second; thou shalt set thy watch, and the\nbridegroom shall observe its motions; they shall be married to a minute,\ngo to bed to a minute; and when the alarm strikes, they shall keep time\nlike the figures of St. Dunstan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock, and _consummatum est_ shall ring\nall over the parish.\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] SCANDAL.\n\nSCAN.  Sir Sampson, sad news.\n\nFORE.  Bless us!\n\nSIR SAMP.  Why, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nSCAN.  Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you guess at what ought to afflict you and him, and all of\nus, more than anything else?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know any universal grievance, but a new\ntax, or the loss of the Canary fleet.  Unless popery should be landed in\nthe West, or the French fleet were at anchor at Blackwall.\n\nSCAN.  No.  Undoubtedly, Mr. Foresight knew all this, and might have\nprevented it.\n\nFORE.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis no earthquake!\n\nSCAN.  No, not yet; nor whirlwind.  But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it may come\nto.  But it has had a consequence already that touches us all.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Why, body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, out with\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nSCAN.  Something has appeared to your son Valentine.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone to bed\nupon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and very ill.  He speaks little, yet he says he has a world to\nsay.  Asks for his father and the wise Foresight; talks of Raymond Lully,\nand the ghost of Lilly.  He has secrets to impart, I suppose, to you two.\nI can get nothing out of him but sighs.  He desires he may see you in the\nmorning, but would not be disturbed to-night, because he has some\nbusiness to do in a dream.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Hoity toity, what have I to do with his dreams or his\ndivination?  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, this is a trick to defer signing the conveyance.\nI warrant the devil will tell him in a dream that he must not part with\nhis estate.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring him a parson to tell him that the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nliar:\u00e2\u0080\u0094or if that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring a lawyer that shall out-lie the\ndevil.  And so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try whether my blackguard or his shall get the better\nof the day.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n                           SCANDAL, FORESIGHT.\n\nSCAN.  Alas, Mr. Foresight, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid all is not right.  You are a wise\nman, and a conscientious man, a searcher into obscurity and futurity, and\nif you commit an error, it is with a great deal of consideration, and\ndiscretion, and caution\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFORE.  Ah, good Mr. Scandal\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  Nay, nay, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis manifest; I do not flatter you.  But Sir Sampson is\nhasty, very hasty.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid he is not scrupulous enough, Mr.\nForesight.  He has been wicked, and heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n grant he may mean well in his\naffair with you.  But my mind gives me, these things cannot be wholly\ninsignificant.  You are wise, and should not be over-reached, methinks\nyou should not\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFORE.  Alas, Mr. Scandal,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_humanum est errare_.\n\nSCAN.  You say true, man will err; mere man will err\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you are\nsomething more.  There have been wise men; but they were such as you, men\nwho consulted the stars, and were observers of omens.  Solomon was wise,\nbut how?\u00e2\u0080\u0094by his judgment in astrology.  So says Pineda in his third book\nand eighth chapter\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFORE.  You are learned, Mr. Scandal.\n\nSCAN.  A trifler\u00e2\u0080\u0094but a lover of art.  And the Wise Men of the East owed\ntheir instruction to a star, which is rightly observed by Gregory the\nGreat in favour of astrology.  And Albertus Magnus makes it the most\nvaluable science, because, says he, it teaches us to consider the\ncausation of causes, in the causes of things.\n\nFORE.  I protest I honour you, Mr. Scandal.  I did not think you had been\nread in these matters.  Few young men are inclined\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  I thank my stars that have inclined me.  But I fear this marriage\nand making over this estate, this transferring of a rightful inheritance,\nwill bring judgments upon us.  I prophesy it, and I would not have the\nfate of Cassandra not to be believed.  Valentine is disturbed; what can\nbe the cause of that?  And Sir Sampson is hurried on by an unusual\nviolence.  I fear he does not act wholly from himself; methinks he does\nnot look as he used to do.\n\nFORE.  He was always of an impetuous nature.  But as to this marriage, I\nhave consulted the stars, and all appearances are prosperous\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  Come, come, Mr. Foresight, let not the prospect of worldly lucre\ncarry you beyond your judgment, nor against your conscience.  You are not\nsatisfied that you act justly.\n\nFORE.  How?\n\nSCAN.  You are not satisfied, I say.  I am loth to discourage you, but it\nis palpable that you are not satisfied.\n\nFORE.  How does it appear, Mr. Scandal?  I think I am very well\nsatisfied.\n\nSCAN.  Either you suffer yourself to deceive yourself, or you do not know\nyourself.\n\nFORE.  Pray explain yourself.\n\nSCAN.  Do you sleep well o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nights?\n\nFORE.  Very well.\n\nSCAN.  Are you certain?  You do not look so.\n\nFORE.  I am in health, I think.\n\nSCAN.  So was Valentine this morning; and looked just so.\n\nFORE.  How?  Am I altered any way?  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perceive it.\n\nSCAN.  That may be, but your beard is longer than it was two hours ago.\n\nFORE.  Indeed!  Bless me!\n\n\n\nSCENE XII.\n\n\n                       [_To them_] MRS. FORESIGHT.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Husband, will you go to bed?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ten a\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.  Mr. Scandal,\nyour servant.\n\nSCAN.  Pox on her, she has interrupted my design\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I must work her into\nthe project.  You keep early hours, madam.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Mr. Foresight is punctual; we sit up after him.\n\nFORE.  My dear, pray lend me your glass, your little looking-glass.\n\nSCAN.  Pray lend it him, madam.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you the reason.\n\n[_She gives him the glass_: SCANDAL _and she whisper_.]  My passion for\nyou is grown so violent, that I am no longer master of myself.  I was\ninterrupted in the morning, when you had charity enough to give me your\nattention, and I had hopes of finding another opportunity of explaining\nmyself to you, but was disappointed all this day; and the uneasiness that\nhas attended me ever since brings me now hither at this unseasonable\nhour.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Was there ever such impudence, to make love to me before my\nhusband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell him.\n\nSCAN.  Do.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll die a martyr rather than disclaim my passion.  But come\na little farther this way, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what project I had to get\nhim out of the way; that I might have an opportunity of waiting upon you.\n[_Whisper_.  FORESIGHT _looking in the glass_.]\n\nFORE.  I do not see any revolution here; methinks I look with a serene\nand benign aspect\u00e2\u0080\u0094pale, a little pale\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the roses of these cheeks have\nbeen gathered many years;\u00e2\u0080\u0094ha!  I do not like that sudden flushing.  Gone\nalready! hem, hem, hem! faintish.  My heart is pretty good; yet it beats;\nand my pulses, ha!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have none\u00e2\u0080\u0094mercy on me\u00e2\u0080\u0094hum.  Yes, here they\nare\u00e2\u0080\u0094gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, hey!  Whither will\nthey hurry me?  Now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gone again.  And now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m faint again, and\npale again, and hem! and my hem! breath, hem! grows short; hem! hem! he,\nhe, hem!\n\nSCAN.  It takes: pursue it in the name of love and pleasure.\n\nMRS. FORE.  How do you do, Mr. Foresight!\n\nFORE.  Hum, not so well as I thought I was.  Lend me your hand.\n\nSCAN.  Look you there now.  Your lady says your sleep has been unquiet of\nlate.\n\nFORE.  Very likely.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh, mighty restless, but I was afraid to tell him so.  He has\nbeen subject to talking and starting.\n\nSCAN.  And did not use to be so?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Never, never, till within these three nights; I cannot say\nthat he has once broken my rest since we have been married.\n\nFORE.  I will go to bed.\n\nSCAN.  Do so, Mr. Foresight, and say your prayers.  He looks better than\nhe did.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Nurse, nurse!\n\nFORE.  Do you think so, Mr. Scandal?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, yes.  I hope this will be gone by morning, taking it in time.\n\nFORE.  I hope so.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII.\n\n\n                            [_To them_] NURSE.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Nurse; your master is not well; put him to bed.\n\nSCAN.  I hope you will be able to see Valentine in the morning.  You had\nbest take a little diacodion and cowslip-water, and lie upon your back:\nmaybe you may dream.\n\nFORE.  I thank you, Mr. Scandal, I will.  Nurse, let me have a\nwatch-light, and lay the Crumbs of Comfort by me.\n\nNURSE.  Yes, sir.\n\nFORE.  And\u00e2\u0080\u0094hem, hem!  I am very faint.\n\nSCAN.  No, no, you look much better.\n\nFORE.  Do I?  And, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear, bring me, let me see\u00e2\u0080\u0094within a quarter of\ntwelve, hem\u00e2\u0080\u0094he, hem!\u00e2\u0080\u0094just upon the turning of the tide, bring me the\nurinal; and I hope, neither the lord of my ascendant, nor the moon will\nbe combust; and then I may do well.\n\nSCAN.  I hope so.  Leave that to me; I will erect a scheme; and I hope I\nshall find both Sol and Venus in the sixth house.\n\nFORE.  I thank you, Mr. Scandal, indeed that would be a great comfort to\nme.  Hem, hem! good night.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV.\n\n\n                         SCANDAL, MRS. FORESIGHT.\n\nSCAN.  Good night, good Mr. Foresight; and I hope Mars and Venus will be\nin conjunction;\u00e2\u0080\u0094while your wife and I are together.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Well; and what use do you hope to make of this project?  You\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that you are ever like to succeed in your design upon me?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, faith I do; I have a better opinion both of you and myself\nthan to despair.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Did you ever hear such a toad?  Hark\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee, devil: do you think\nany woman honest?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, several, very honest; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cheat a little at cards,\nsometimes, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Pshaw! but virtuous, I mean?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, faith, I believe some women are virtuous too; but \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as I\nbelieve some men are valiant, through fear.  For why should a man court\ndanger or a woman shun pleasure?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh, monstrous!  What are conscience and honour?\n\nSCAN.  Why, honour is a public enemy, and conscience a domestic thief;\nand he that would secure his pleasure must pay a tribute to one and go\nhalves with t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other.  As for honour, that you have secured, for you have\npurchased a perpetual opportunity for pleasure.\n\nMRS. FORE.  An opportunity for pleasure?\n\nSCAN.  Ay, your husband, a husband is an opportunity for pleasure: so you\nhave taken care of honour, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the least I can do to take care of\nconscience.\n\nMRS. FORE.  And so you think we are free for one another?\n\nSCAN.  Yes, faith I think so; I love to speak my mind.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Why, then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll speak my mind.  Now as to this affair between\nyou and me.  Here you make love to me; why, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll confess it does not\ndisplease me.  Your person is well enough, and your understanding is not\namiss.\n\nSCAN.  I have no great opinion of myself, but I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m neither\ndeformed nor a fool.\n\nMRS. FORE.  But you have a villainous character: you are a libertine in\nspeech, as well as practice.\n\nSCAN.  Come, I know what you would say: you think it more dangerous to be\nseen in conversation with me than to allow some other men the last\nfavour; you mistake: the liberty I take in talking is purely affected for\nthe service of your sex.  He that first cries out stop thief is often he\nthat has stol\u00e2\u0080\u0099n the treasure.  I am a juggler, that act by confederacy;\nand if you please, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put a trick upon the world.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Ay; but you are such an universal juggler, that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid\nyou have a great many confederates.\n\nSCAN.  Faith, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sound.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh, fie\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re impudent.\n\nSCAN.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swear you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re handsome.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Pish, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tell me so, though you did not think so.\n\nSCAN.  And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think so, though I should not tell you so.  And now I\nthink we know one another pretty well.\n\nMRS. FORE.  O Lord, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here?\n\n\n\nSCENE XV.\n\n\n                    [_To them_] MRS. FRAIL _and_ BEN.\n\nBEN.  Mess, I love to speak my mind.  Father has nothing to do with me.\nNay, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that neither; he has something to do with me.  But what\ndoes that signify?  If so be that I ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099t minded to be steered by him;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as thof he should strive against wind and tide.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Ay, but, my dear, we must keep it secret till the estate be\nsettled; for you know, marrying without an estate is like sailing in a\nship without ballast.\n\nBEN.  He, he, he; why, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true; just so for all the world it is\nindeed, as like as two cable ropes.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  And though I have a good portion, you know one would not\nventure all in one bottom.\n\nBEN.  Why, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true again; for mayhap one bottom may spring a leak.\nYou have hit it indeed: mess, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve nicked the channel.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Well, but if you should forsake me after all, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d break my\nheart.\n\nBEN.  Break your heart?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather the _Mary-gold_ should break her\ncable in a storm, as well as I love her.  Flesh, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nfalse-hearted, like a landman.  A sailor will be honest, thof mayhap he\nhas never a penny of money in his pocket.  Mayhap I may not have so fair\na face as a citizen or a courtier; but, for all that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve as good blood\nin my veins, and a heart as sound as a biscuit.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  And will you love me always?\n\nBEN.  Nay, an I love once, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stick like pitch; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you that.\nCome, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sing you a song of a sailor.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Hold, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my sister, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call her to hear it.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Well; I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to bed to my husband to-night, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nretire to my own chamber, and think of what you have said.\n\nSCAN.  Well; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give me leave to wait upon you to your chamber door,\nand leave you my last instructions?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Hold, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my sister coming towards us.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  If it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interrupt you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll entertain you with a song.\n\nBEN.  The song was made upon one of our ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-crew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife.  Our\nboatswain made the song.  Mayhap you may know her, sir.  Before she was\nmarried she was called buxom Joan of Deptford.\n\nSCAN.  I have heard of her.\n\nBEN.  [_Sings_]:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n                                 BALLAD.\n                         Set by MR. JOHN ECCLES.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   A soldier and a sailor,\n   A tinker and a tailor,\n   Had once a doubtful strife, sir,\n   To make a maid a wife, sir,\n      Whose name was buxom Joan.\n   For now the time was ended,\n   When she no more intended\n   To lick her lips at men, sir,\n   And gnaw the sheets in vain, sir,\n         And lie o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nights alone.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   The soldier swore like thunder,\n   He loved her more than plunder,\n   And shewed her many a scar, sir,\n   That he had brought from far, sir,\n      With fighting for her sake.\n   The tailor thought to please her\n   With offering her his measure.\n   The tinker, too, with mettle\n   Said he could mend her kettle,\n      And stop up ev\u00e2\u0080\u0099ry leak.\n\n                                   III.\n\n   But while these three were prating,\n   The sailor slyly waiting,\n   Thought if it came about, sir,\n   That they should all fall out, sir,\n      He then might play his part.\n   And just e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en as he meant, sir,\n   To loggerheads they went, sir,\n   And then he let fly at her\n   A shot \u00e2\u0080\u0099twixt wind and water,\n      That won this fair maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart.\n\nBEN.  If some of our crew that came to see me are not gone, you shall see\nthat we sailors can dance sometimes as well as other folks.\n[_Whistles_.]  I warrant that brings \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, an they be within hearing.\n[_Enter seamen_].   Oh, here they be\u00e2\u0080\u0094and fiddles along with \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  Come,\nmy lads, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a round, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make one.  [_Dance_.]\n\nBEN.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re merry folks, we sailors: we han\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much to care for.  Thus we\nlive at sea; eat biscuit, and drink flip, put on a clean shirt once a\nquarter; come home and lie with our landladies once a year, get rid of a\nlittle money, and then put off with the next fair wind.  How d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye like\nus?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Oh, you are the happiest, merriest men alive.\n\nMRS. FORE.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re beholden to Mr. Benjamin for this entertainment.  I\nbelieve it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s late.\n\nBEN.  Why, forsooth, an you think so, you had best go to bed.  For my\npart, I mean to toss a can, and remember my sweet-heart, afore I turn in;\nmayhap I may dream of her.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Mr. Scandal, you had best go to bed and dream too.\n\nSCAN.  Why, faith, I have a good lively imagination, and can dream as\nmuch to the purpose as another, if I set about it.  But dreaming is the\npoor retreat of a lazy, hopeless, and imperfect lover; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the last\nglimpse of love to worn-out sinners, and the faint dawning of a bliss to\nwishing girls and growing boys.\n\n   There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nought but willing, waking love, that can\n   Make blest the ripened maid and finished man.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                          _Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lodging_.\n\n                          SCANDAL _and_ JEREMY.\n\nSCAN.  Well, is your master ready? does he look madly and talk madly?\n\nJERE.  Yes, sir; you need make no great doubt of that.  He that was so\nnear turning poet yesterday morning can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be much to seek in playing the\nmadman to-day.\n\nSCAN.  Would he have Angelica acquainted with the reason of his design?\n\nJERE.  No, sir, not yet.  He has a mind to try whether his playing the\nmadman won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her play the fool, and fall in love with him; or at\nleast own that she has loved him all this while and concealed it.\n\nSCAN.  I saw her take coach just now with her maid, and think I heard her\nbid the coachman drive hither.\n\nJERE.  Like enough, sir, for I told her maid this morning, my master was\nrun stark mad only for love of her mistress.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hear a coach stop; if it\nshould be she, sir, I believe he would not see her, till he hears how she\ntakes it.\n\nSCAN.  Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try her:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis she\u00e2\u0080\u0094here she comes.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                    [_To them_] ANGELICA _with_ JENNY.\n\nANG.  Mr. Scandal, I suppose you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it a novelty to see a woman\nvisit a man at his own lodgings in a morning?\n\nSCAN.  Not upon a kind occasion, madam.  But when a lady comes\ntyrannically to insult a ruined lover, and make manifest the cruel\ntriumphs of her beauty, the barbarity of it something surprises me.\n\nANG.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like raillery from a serious face.  Pray tell me what is\nthe matter?\n\nJERE.  No strange matter, madam; my master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.  I suppose\nyour ladyship has thought him so a great while.\n\nANG.  How d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye mean, mad?\n\nJERE.  Why, faith, madam, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad for want of his wits, just as he was\npoor for want of money; his head is e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en as light as his pockets, and\nanybody that has a mind to a bad bargain can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do better than to beg him\nfor his estate.\n\nANG.  If you speak truth, your endeavouring at wit is very unseasonable.\n\nSCAN.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerned, and loves him.  [_Aside_.]\n\nANG.  Mr. Scandal, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think me guilty of so much inhumanity as not\nto be concerned for a man I must own myself obliged to?  Pray tell me\ntruth.\n\nSCAN.  Faith, madam, I wish telling a lie would mend the matter.  But\nthis is no new effect of an unsuccessful passion.\n\nANG.  [_Aside_.]  I know not what to think.  Yet I should be vexed to\nhave a trick put upon me.  May I not see him?\n\nSCAN.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid the physician is not willing you should see him yet.\nJeremy, go in and enquire.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                        SCANDAL, ANGELICA, JENNY.\n\nANG.  Ha!  I saw him wink and smile.  I fancy \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a trick\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwould disguise to all the world a failing which I must own to you: I fear\nmy happiness depends upon the recovery of Valentine.  Therefore I conjure\nyou, as you are his friend, and as you have compassion upon one fearful\nof affliction, to tell me what I am to hope for\u00e2\u0080\u0094I cannot speak\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you\nmay tell me, tell me, for you know what I would ask?\n\nSCAN.  So, this is pretty plain.  Be not too much concerned, madam; I\nhope his condition is not desperate.  An acknowledgment of love from you,\nperhaps, may work a cure, as the fear of your aversion occasioned his\ndistemper.\n\nANG.  [_Aside_.]  Say you so; nay, then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced.  And if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nplay trick for trick, may I never taste the pleasure of\nrevenge.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Acknowledgment of love!  I find you have mistaken my compassion,\nand think me guilty of a weakness I am a stranger to.  But I have too\nmuch sincerity to deceive you, and too much charity to suffer him to be\ndeluded with vain hopes.  Good nature and humanity oblige me to be\nconcerned for him; but to love is neither in my power nor inclination,\nand if he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be cured without I suck the poison from his wounds, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nafraid he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recover his senses till I lose mine.\n\nSCAN.  Hey, brave woman, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099faith\u00e2\u0080\u0094won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see him, then, if he desire\nit?\n\nANG.  What signify a madman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires?  Besides, \u00e2\u0080\u0099twould make me\nuneasy:\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see him, perhaps my concern for him may lessen.  If I\nforget him, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis no more than he has done by himself; and now the\nsurprise is over, methinks I am not half so sorry as I was.\n\nSCAN.  So, faith, good nature works apace; you were confessing just now\nan obligation to his love.\n\nANG.  But I have considered that passions are unreasonable and\ninvoluntary; if he loves, he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it; and if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhelp it; no more than he can help his being a man, or I my being a woman:\nor no more than I can help my want of inclination to stay longer here.\nCome, Jenny.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                             SCANDAL, JEREMY.\n\nSCAN.  Humh!  An admirable composition, faith, this same womankind.\n\nJERE.  What, is she gone, sir?\n\nSCAN.  Gone?  Why, she was never here, nor anywhere else; nor I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow her if I see her, nor you neither.\n\nJERE.  Good lack!  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter now?  Are any more of us to be mad?\nWhy, sir, my master longs to see her, and is almost mad in good earnest\nwith the joyful news of her being here.\n\nSCAN.  We are all under a mistake.  Ask no questions, for I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resolve\nyou; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll inform your master.  In the meantime, if our project\nsucceed no better with his father than it does with his mistress, he may\ndescend from his exaltation of madness into the road of common sense, and\nbe content only to be made a fool with other reasonable people.  I hear\nSir Sampson.  You know your cue; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll to your master.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n               JEREMY, SIR SAMPSON LEGEND, _with a_ LAWYER.\n\nSIR SAMP.  D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, Mr. Buckram, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the paper signed with his own\nhand.\n\nBUCK.  Good, sir.  And the conveyance is ready drawn in this box, if he\nbe ready to sign and seal.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Ready, body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me?  He must be ready.  His sham-sickness\nshan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse him.  Oh, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his scoundrel.  Sirrah, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your\nmaster?\n\nJERE.  Ah sir, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite gone.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Gone!  What, he is not dead?\n\nJERE.  No, sir, not dead.\n\nSIR SAMP.  What, is he gone out of town, run away, ha? has he tricked me?\nSpeak, varlet.\n\nJERE.  No, no, sir, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe enough, sir, an he were but as sound, poor\ngentleman.  He is indeed here, sir, and not here, sir.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Hey day, rascal, do you banter me?  Sirrah, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye banter me?\nSpeak, sirrah, where is he? for I will find him.\n\nJERE.  Would you could, sir, for he has lost himself.  Indeed, sir, I\nhave a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most broke my heart about him\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t refrain tears when I think\nof him, sir: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m as melancholy for him as a passing-bell, sir, or a horse\nin a pound.\n\nSIR SAMP.  A pox confound your similitudes, sir.  Speak to be understood,\nand tell me in plain terms what the matter is with him, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll crack\nyour fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skull.\n\nJERE.  Ah, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hit it, sir; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter with him, sir: his\nskull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cracked, poor gentleman; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark mad, sir.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Mad!\n\nBUCK.  What, is he _non compos_?\n\nJERE.  Quite _non compos_, sir.\n\nBUCK.  Why, then, all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obliterated, Sir Sampson, if he be _non compos\nmentis_; his act and deed will be of no effect, it is not good in law.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Oons, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it; let me see him, sir.  Mad\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make\nhim find his senses.\n\nJERE.  Mr. Scandal is with him, sir; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll knock at the door.\n\n[_Goes to the scene_, _which opens_.]\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\nSIR SAMPSON, VALENTINE, SCANDAL, JEREMY, _and_ LAWYER.  VALENTINE _upon a\n                        couch disorderly dressed_.\n\nSIR SAMP.  How now, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here to do?\n\nVAL.  Ha!  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?  [_Starting_.]\n\nSCAN.  For heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake softly, sir, and gently; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provoke him.\n\nVAL.  Answer me: who is that, and that?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Gads bobs, does he not know me?  Is he mischievous?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nspeak gently.  Val, Val, dost thou not know me, boy?  Not know thy own\nfather, Val?  I am thy own father, and this is honest Brief Buckram, the\nlawyer.\n\nVAL.  It may be so\u00e2\u0080\u0094I did not know you\u00e2\u0080\u0094the world is full.  There are\npeople that we do know, and people that we do not know, and yet the sun\nshines upon all alike.  There are fathers that have many children, and\nthere are children that have many fathers.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis strange!  But I am\nTruth, and come to give the world the lie.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I know not what to say to him.\n\nVAL.  Why does that lawyer wear black?  Does he carry his conscience\nwithoutside?  Lawyer what art thou?  Dost thou know me?\n\nBUCK.  O Lord, what must I say?  Yes, sir,\n\nVAL.  Thou liest, for I am Truth.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis hard I cannot get a livelihood\namongst you.  I have been sworn out of Westminster Hall the first day of\nevery term\u00e2\u0080\u0094let me see\u00e2\u0080\u0094no matter how long.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you one thing:\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question that would puzzle an arithmetician, if you should ask\nhim, whether the Bible saves more souls in Westminster Abbey, or damns\nmore in Westminster Hall.  For my part, I am Truth, and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell; I\nhave very few acquaintance.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, he talks sensibly in his madness.  Has he no\nintervals?\n\nJERE.  Very short, sir.\n\nBUCK.  Sir, I can do you no service while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in this condition.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyour paper, sir\u00e2\u0080\u0094he may do me a mischief if I stay.  The conveyance is\nready, sir, if he recover his senses.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n                 SIR SAMPSON, VALENTINE, SCANDAL, JEREMY.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Hold, hold, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go yet.\n\nSCAN.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better let him go, sir, and send for him if there be\noccasion; for I fancy his presence provokes him more.\n\nVAL.  Is the lawyer gone?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis well, then we may drink about without\ngoing together by the ears\u00e2\u0080\u0094heigh ho!  What a\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock is\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?  My father here!\nYour blessing, sir.\n\nSIR SAMP.  He recovers\u00e2\u0080\u0094bless thee, Val; how dost thou do, boy?\n\nVAL.  Thank you, sir, pretty well.  I have been a little out of order,\nWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you please to sit, sir?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Ay, boy.  Come, thou shalt sit down by me.\n\nVAL.  Sir, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis my duty to wait.\n\nSIR SAMP.  No, no; come, come, sit thee down, honest Val.  How dost thou\ndo?  Let me feel thy pulse.  Oh, pretty well now, Val.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I was\nsorry to see thee indisposed; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad thou art better, honest Val.\n\nVAL.  I thank you, sir.\n\nSCAN.  Miracle!  The monster grows loving.  [_Aside_.]\n\nSIR SAMP.  Let me feel thy hand again, Val.  It does not shake; I believe\nthou canst write, Val.  Ha, boy? thou canst write thy name, Val.  Jeremy,\nstep and overtake Mr. Buckram, bid him make haste back with the\nconveyance; quick, quick.  [_In whisper to_ JEREMY.]\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                     SIR SAMPSON, VALENTINE, SCANDAL.\n\nSCAN.  That ever I should suspect such a heathen of any remorse!\n[_Aside_.]\n\nSIR SAMP.  Dost thou know this paper, Val?  I know thou\u00e2\u0080\u0099rt honest, and\nwilt perform articles.  [_Shows him the paper_, _but holds it out of his\nreach_.]\n\nVAL.  Pray let me see it, sir.  You hold it so far off that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\nwhether I know it or no.\n\nSIR SAMP.  See it, boy?  Ay, ay; why, thou dost see it\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis thy own hand,\nVally.  Why, let me see, I can read it as plain as can be.  Look you\nhere.  [_Reads_.]  _The condition of this obligation_\u00e2\u0080\u0094Look you, as plain\nas can be, so it begins\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then at the bottom\u00e2\u0080\u0094_As witness my hand_,\nVALENTINE LEGEND, in great letters.  Why, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as plain as the nose in\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  What, are my eyes better than thine?  I believe I can read\nit farther off yet; let me see.  [_Stretches his arm as far as he can_.]\n\nVAL.  Will you please to let me hold it, sir?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Let thee hold it, sayest thou?  Ay, with all my heart.  What\nmatter is it who holds it?  What need anybody hold it?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put it up in\nmy pocket, Val, and then nobody need hold it.  [_Puts the paper in his\npocket_.]  There, Val; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe enough, boy.  But thou shalt have it as\nsoon as thou hast set thy hand to another paper, little Val.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n                    [_To them_] JEREMY _with_ BUCKRAM.\n\nVAL.  What, is my bad genius here again!  Oh no, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis the lawyer with an\nitching palm; and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come to be scratched.  My nails are not long\nenough.  Let me have a pair of red-hot tongs quickly, quickly, and you\nshall see me act St. Dunstan, and lead the devil by the nose.\n\nBUCK.  O Lord, let me begone: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not venture myself with a madman.\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n                 SIR SAMPSON, VALENTINE, SCANDAL, JEREMY.\n\nVAL.  Ha, ha, ha; you need not run so fast, honesty will not overtake\nyou.  Ha, ha, ha, the rogue found me out to be _in forma pauperis_\npresently.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Oons!  What a vexation is here!  I know not what to do, or\nsay, nor which way to go.\n\nVAL.  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of his way?  I am Truth, and can set him\nright.  Harkee, friend, the straight road is the worst way you can go.\nHe that follows his nose always, will very often be led into a stink.\n_Probatum est_.  But what are you for? religion or politics?  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\ncouple of topics for you, no more like one another than oil and vinegar;\nand yet those two, beaten together by a state-cook, make sauce for the\nwhole nation.\n\nSIR SAMP.  What the devil had I to do, ever to beget sons?  Why did I\never marry?\n\nVAL.  Because thou wert a monster, old boy!  The two greatest monsters in\nthe world are a man and a woman!  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thy opinion?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Why, my opinion is, that those two monsters joined together,\nmake yet a greater, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man and his wife.\n\nVAL.  Aha!  Old True-penny, say\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou so?  Thou hast nicked it.  But\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wonderful strange, Jeremy.\n\nJERE.  What is, sir?\n\nVAL.  That gray hairs should cover a green head\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I make a fool of my\nfather.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here!  _Erra Pater_: or a bearded sibyl?  If Prophecy\ncomes, Truth must give place.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n       SIR SAMPSON, SCANDAL, FORESIGHT, MISS FORESIGHT, MRS. FRAIL.\n\nFORE.  What says he?  What, did he prophesy?  Ha, Sir Sampson, bless us!\nHow are we?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Are we?  A pox o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your prognostication.  Why, we are fools as\nwe use to be.  Oons, that you could not foresee that the moon would\npredominate, and my son be mad.  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your oppositions, your trines,\nand your quadrates?  What did your Cardan and your Ptolemy tell you?\nYour Messahalah and your Longomontanus, your harmony of chiromancy with\nastrology.  Ah! pox on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that I that know the world and men and manners,\nthat don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe a syllable in the sky and stars, and sun and almanacs\nand trash, should be directed by a dreamer, an omen-hunter, and defer\nbusiness in expectation of a lucky hour, when, body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, there never\nwas a lucky hour after the first opportunity.\n\n\n\nSCENE XII.\n\n\n             SCANDAL, FORESIGHT, MRS. FORESIGHT, MRS. FRAIL.\n\nFORE.  Ah, Sir Sampson, heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n help your head.  This is none of your\nlucky hour; _Nemo omnibus horis sapit_.  What, is he gone, and in\ncontempt of science?  Ill stars and unconvertible ignorance attend him.\n\nSCAN.  You must excuse his passion, Mr. Foresight, for he has been\nheartily vexed.  His son is _non compos mentis_, and thereby incapable of\nmaking any conveyance in law; so that all his measures are disappointed.\n\nFORE.  Ha! say you so?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  What, has my sea-lover lost his anchor of hope, then?\n[_Aside to_ MRS. FORESIGHT.]\n\nMRS. FORE.  O sister, what will you do with him?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Do with him?  Send him to sea again in the next foul\nweather.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used to an inconstant element, and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised to\nsee the tide turned.\n\nFORE.  Wherein was I mistaken, not to foresee this?  [_Considers_.]\n\nSCAN.  Madam, you and I can tell him something else that he did not\nforesee, and more particularly relating to his own fortune.  [_Aside to_\nMRS. FORESIGHT.]\n\nMRS. FORE.  What do you mean?  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand you.\n\nSCAN.  Hush, softly,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the pleasures of last night, my dear, too\nconsiderable to be forgot so soon.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Last night!  And what would your impudence infer from last\nnight?  Last night was like the night before, I think.\n\nSCAN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, do you make no difference between me and your husband?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Not much,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superstitious, and you are mad, in my opinion.\n\nSCAN.  You make me mad.  You are not serious.  Pray recollect yourself.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh yes, now I remember, you were very impertinent and\nimpudent,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and would have come to bed to me.\n\nSCAN.  And did not?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Did not!  With that face can you ask the question?\n\nSCAN.  This I have heard of before, but never believed.  I have been\ntold, she had that admirable quality of forgetting to a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face in the\nmorning that she had lain with him all night, and denying that she had\ndone favours with more impudence than she could grant \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  Madam, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nyour humble servant, and honour you.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You look pretty well, Mr. Foresight:\nhow did you rest last night?\n\nFORE.  Truly, Mr. Scandal, I was so taken up with broken dreams and\ndistracted visions that I remember little.\n\nSCAN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas a very forgetting night.  But would you not talk with\nValentine?  Perhaps you may understand him; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m apt to believe there is\nsomething mysterious in his discourses, and sometimes rather think him\ninspired than mad.\n\nFORE.  You speak with singular good judgment, Mr. Scandal, truly.  I am\ninclining to your Turkish opinion in this matter, and do reverence a man\nwhom the vulgar think mad.  Let us go to him.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Sister, do you stay with them; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find out my lover, and\ngive him his discharge, and come to you.  O\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my conscience, here he\ncomes.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII.\n\n\n                             MRS. FRAIL, BEN.\n\nBEN.  All mad, I think.  Flesh, I believe all the calentures of the sea\nare come ashore, for my part.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Mr. Benjamin in choler!\n\nBEN.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased well enough, now I have found you.  Mess, I have\nhad such a hurricane upon your account yonder.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  My account; pray what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nBEN.  Why, father came and found me squabbling with yon chitty-faced\nthing as he would have me marry, so he asked what was the matter.  He\nasked in a surly sort of a way\u00e2\u0080\u0094it seems brother Val is gone mad, and so\nthat put\u00e2\u0080\u0099n into a passion; but what did I know that? what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that to\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u0094so he asked in a surly sort of manner, and gad I answered \u00e2\u0080\u0099n as\nsurlily.  What thof he be my father, I an\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bound prentice to \u00e2\u0080\u0099n; so\nfaith I told \u00e2\u0080\u0099n in plain terms, if I were minded to marry, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d marry to\nplease myself, not him.  And for the young woman that he provided for me,\nI thought it more fitting for her to learn her sampler and make dirt-pies\nthan to look after a husband; for my part I was none of her man.  I had\nanother voyage to make, let him take it as he will.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  So, then, you intend to go to sea again?\n\nBEN.  Nay, nay, my mind run upon you, but I would not tell him so much.\nSo he said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make my heart ache; and if so be that he could get a\nwoman to his mind, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d marry himself.  Gad, says I, an you play the fool\nand marry at these years, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more danger of your head\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aching than\nmy heart.  He was woundy angry when I gave\u00e2\u0080\u0099n that wipe.  He hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a word\nto say, and so I left\u00e2\u0080\u0099n, and the green girl together; mayhap the bee may\nbite, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry her himself, with all my heart.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  And were you this undutiful and graceless wretch to your\nfather?\n\nBEN.  Then why was he graceless first?  If I am undutiful and graceless,\nwhy did he beget me so?  I did not get myself.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O impiety!  How have I been mistaken!  What an inhuman,\nmerciless creature have I set my heart upon?  Oh, I am happy to have\ndiscovered the shelves and quicksands that lurk beneath that faithless,\nsmiling face.\n\nBEN.  Hey toss!  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter now?  Why, you ben\u00e2\u0080\u0099t angry, be you?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Oh, see me no more,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for thou wert born amongst rocks,\nsuckled by whales, cradled in a tempest, and whistled to by winds; and\nthou art come forth with fins and scales, and three rows of teeth, a most\noutrageous fish of prey.\n\nBEN.  O Lord, O Lord, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad, poor young woman: love has turned her\nsenses, her brain is quite overset.  Well-a-day, how shall I do to set\nher to rights?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No, no, I am not mad, monster; I am wise enough to find you\nout.  Hadst thou the impudence to aspire at being a husband with that\nstubborn and disobedient temper?  You that know not how to submit to a\nfather, presume to have a sufficient stock of duty to undergo a wife?  I\nshould have been finely fobbed indeed, very finely fobbed.\n\nBEN.  Harkee, forsooth; if so be that you are in your right senses, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye\nsee, for ought as I perceive I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like to be finely fobbed,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I have got\nanger here upon your account, and you are tacked about already.  What\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye mean, after all your fair speeches, and stroking my cheeks, and\nkissing and hugging, what would you sheer off so?  Would you, and leave\nme aground?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave you adrift, and go which way you will.\n\nBEN.  What, are you false-hearted, then?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Only the wind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed.\n\nBEN.  More shame for you,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the wind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ill wind blows\nnobody good,\u00e2\u0080\u0094mayhap I have a good riddance on you, if these be your\ntricks.  What, did you mean all this while to make a fool of me?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Any fool but a husband.\n\nBEN.  Husband!  Gad, I would not be your husband if you would have me,\nnow I know your mind: thof you had your weight in gold and jewels, and\nthof I loved you never so well.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Why, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099st thou love, Porpuss?\n\nBEN.  No matter what I can do; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call names.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love you so\nwell as to bear that, whatever I did.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you show yourself,\nmistress.  Let them marry you as don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you.  Gad, I know you too\nwell, by sad experience; I believe he that marries you will go to sea in\na hen-pecked frigate\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe that, young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0094and mayhap may come to\nan anchor at Cuckolds-Point; so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dash for you, take it as you\nwill: mayhap you may holla after me when I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Ha, ha, ha, no doubt on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_My true love is gone to sea_.\n[_Sings_]\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV.\n\n\n                       MRS. FRAIL, MRS. FORESIGHT.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O sister, had you come a minute sooner, you would have seen\nthe resolution of a lover:\u00e2\u0080\u0094honest Tar and I are parted;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with the same\nindifference that we met.  O\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my life I am half vexed at the\ninsensibility of a brute that I despised.\n\nMRS. FORE.  What then, he bore it most heroically?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Most tyrannically; for you see he has got the start of me,\nand I, the poor forsaken maid, am left complaining on the shore.  But\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you a hint that he has given me: Sir Sampson is enraged, and\ntalks desperately of committing matrimony himself.  If he has a mind to\nthrow himself away, he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it more effectually than upon me, if we\ncould bring it about.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Oh, hang him, old fox, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too cunning; besides, he hates\nboth you and me.  But I have a project in my head for you, and I have\ngone a good way towards it.  I have almost made a bargain with Jeremy,\nValentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man, to sell his master to us.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Sell him?  How?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Valentine raves upon Angelica, and took me for her, and\nJeremy says will take anybody for her that he imposes on him.  Now, I\nhave promised him mountains, if in one of his mad fits he will bring you\nto him in her stead, and get you married together and put to bed\ntogether; and after consummation, girl, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no revoking.  And if he\nshould recover his senses, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be glad at least to make you a good\nsettlement.  Here they come: stand aside a little, and tell me how you\nlike the design.\n\n\n\nSCENE XV.\n\n\n MRS. FORESIGHT, MRS. FRAIL, VALENTINE, SCANDAL, FORESIGHT, _and_ JEREMY.\n\nSCAN.  And have you given your master a hint of their plot upon him?\n[_To_ JEREMY.]\n\nJERE.  Yes, sir; he says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll favour it, and mistake her for Angelica.\n\nSCAN.  It may make us sport.\n\nFORE.  Mercy on us!\n\nVAL.  Husht\u00e2\u0080\u0094interrupt me not\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll whisper prediction to thee, and thou\nshalt prophesy.  I am Truth, and can teach thy tongue a new trick.  I\nhave told thee what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past,\u00e2\u0080\u0094now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come.  Dost thou know\nwhat will happen to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Answer me not\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I will tell thee.\nTo-morrow, knaves will thrive through craft, and fools through fortune,\nand honesty will go as it did, frost-nipt in a summer suit.  Ask me\nquestions concerning to-morrow.\n\nSCAN.  Ask him, Mr. Foresight.\n\nFORE.  Pray what will be done at court?\n\nVAL.  Scandal will tell you.  I am Truth; I never come there.\n\nFORE.  In the city?\n\nVAL.  Oh, prayers will be said in empty churches at the usual hours.  Yet\nyou will see such zealous faces behind counters, as if religion were to\nbe sold in every shop.  Oh, things will go methodically in the city: the\nclocks will strike twelve at noon, and the horned herd buzz in the\nexchange at two.  Wives and husbands will drive distinct trades, and care\nand pleasure separately occupy the family.  Coffee-houses will be full of\nsmoke and stratagem.  And the cropt prentice, that sweeps his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshop in the morning, may ten to one dirty his sheets before night.  But\nthere are two things that you will see very strange: which are wanton\nwives with their legs at liberty, and tame cuckolds with chains about\ntheir necks.  But hold, I must examine you before I go further.  You look\nsuspiciously.  Are you a husband?\n\nFORE.  I am married.\n\nVAL.  Poor creature!  Is your wife of Covent Garden parish?\n\nFORE.  No; St. Martin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-in-the-Fields.\n\nVAL.  Alas, poor man; his eyes are sunk, and his hands shrivelled; his\nlegs dwindled, and his back bowed: pray, pray, for a metamorphosis.\nChange thy shape and shake off age; get thee Medea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kettle and be boiled\nanew; come forth with lab\u00e2\u0080\u0099ring callous hands, a chine of steel, and Atlas\nshoulders.  Let Taliacotius trim the calves of twenty chairmen, and make\nthee pedestals to stand erect upon, and look matrimony in the face.  Ha,\nha, ha!  That a man should have a stomach to a wedding supper, when the\npigeons ought rather to be laid to his feet, ha, ha, ha!\n\nFORE.  His frenzy is very high now, Mr. Scandal.\n\nSCAN.  I believe it is a spring tide.\n\nFORE.  Very likely, truly.  You understand these matters.  Mr. Scandal, I\nshall be very glad to confer with you about these things which he has\nuttered.  His sayings are very mysterious and hieroglyphical.\n\nVAL.  Oh, why would Angelica be absent from my eyes so long?\n\nJERE.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here, sir.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Now, sister.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O Lord, what must I say?\n\nSCAN.  Humour him, madam, by all means.\n\nVAL.  Where is she?  Oh, I see her\u00e2\u0080\u0094she comes, like riches, health, and\nliberty at once, to a despairing, starving, and abandoned wretch.  Oh,\nwelcome, welcome.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  How d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye, sir?  Can I serve you?\n\nVAL.  Harkee; I have a secret to tell you: Endymion and the moon shall\nmeet us upon Mount Latmos, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be married in the dead of night.\nBut say not a word.  Hymen shall put his torch into a dark lanthorn, that\nit may be secret; and Juno shall give her peacock poppy-water, that he\nmay fold his ogling tail, and Argus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hundred eyes be shut, ha!  Nobody\nshall know but Jeremy.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  No, no, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep it secret, it shall be done presently.\n\nVAL.  The sooner the better.  Jeremy, come hither\u00e2\u0080\u0094closer\u00e2\u0080\u0094that none may\noverhear us.  Jeremy, I can tell you news: Angelica is turned nun, and I\nam turning friar, and yet we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry one another in spite of the pope.\nGet me a cowl and beads, that I may play my part,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet me two\nhours hence in black and white, and a long veil to cover the project, and\nwe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces, till we have done something to be\nashamed of; and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll blush once for all.\n\n\n\nSCENE XVI.\n\n\n                    [_To them_] TATTLE _and_ ANGELICA.\n\nJERE.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take care, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nVAL.  Whisper.\n\nANG.  Nay, Mr. Tattle, if you make love to me, you spoil my design, for I\nintend to make you my confidant.\n\nTATT.  But, madam, to throw away your person\u00e2\u0080\u0094such a person!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and such a\nfortune on a madman!\n\nANG.  I never loved him till he was mad; but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anybody so.\n\nSCAN.  How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this!  Tattle making love to Angelica!\n\nTATT.  Tell, madam?  Alas, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know me.  I have much ado to tell\nyour ladyship how long I have been in love with you\u00e2\u0080\u0094but encouraged by the\nimpossibility of Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making any more addresses to you, I have\nventured to declare the very inmost passion of my heart.  O madam, look\nupon us both.  There you see the ruins of a poor decayed creature\u00e2\u0080\u0094here, a\ncomplete and lively figure, with youth and health, and all his five\nsenses in perfection, madam, and to all this, the most passionate lover\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nANG.  O fie, for shame, hold your tongue.  A passionate lover, and five\nsenses in perfection!  When you are as mad as Valentine, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll believe you\nlove me, and the maddest shall take me.\n\nVAL.  It is enough.  Ha!  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here?\n\nFRAIL.  O Lord, her coming will spoil all.  [_To_ JEREMY.]\n\nJERE.  No, no, madam, he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know her; if he should, I can persuade\nhim.\n\nVAL.  Scandal, who are these?  Foreigners?  If they are, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you\nwhat I think,\u00e2\u0080\u0094get away all the company but Angelica, that I may discover\nmy design to her.  [_Whisper_.]\n\nSCAN.  I will\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have discovered something of Tattle that is of a piece\nwith Mrs. Frail.  He courts Angelica; if we could contrive to couple \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\ntogether.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hark\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_Whisper_.]\n\nMRS. FORE.  He won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you, cousin; he knows nobody.\n\nFORE.  But he knows more than anybody.  O niece, he knows things past and\nto come, and all the profound secrets of time.\n\nTATT.  Look you, Mr. Foresight, it is not my way to make many words of\nmatters, and so I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say much,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but in short, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, I will hold\nyou a hundred pounds now, that I know more secrets than he.\n\nFORE.  How!  I cannot read that knowledge in your face, Mr. Tattle.\nPray, what do you know?\n\nTATT.  Why, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you, sir?  Read it in my face?  No, sir,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis written in my heart; and safer there, sir, than letters writ in\njuice of lemon, for no fire can fetch it out.  I am no blab, sir.\n\nVAL.  Acquaint Jeremy with it, he may easily bring it about.  They are\nwelcome, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099em so myself.  [_To_ SCANDAL.]  What, do you look\nstrange upon me?  Then I must be plain.  [_Coming up to them_.]  I am\nTruth, and hate an old acquaintance with a new face.  [SCANDAL _goes\naside with_ JEREMY.]\n\nTATT.  Do you know me, Valentine?\n\nVAL.  You?  Who are you?  No, I hope not.\n\nTATT.  I am Jack Tattle, your friend.\n\nVAL.  My friend, what to do?  I am no married man, and thou canst not lie\nwith my wife.  I am very poor, and thou canst not borrow money of me.\nThen what employment have I for a friend?\n\nTATT.  Ha! a good open speaker, and not to be trusted with a secret.\n\nANG.  Do you know me, Valentine?\n\nVAL.  Oh, very well.\n\nANG.  Who am I?\n\nVAL.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a woman.  One to whom heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n gave beauty, when it grafted\nroses on a briar.  You are the reflection of heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n in a pond, and he\nthat leaps at you is sunk.  You are all white, a sheet of lovely,\nspotless paper, when you first are born; but you are to be scrawled and\nblotted by every goose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quill.  I know you; for I loved a woman, and\nloved her so long, that I found out a strange thing: I found out what a\nwoman was good for.\n\nTATT.  Ay, prithee, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\n\nVAL.  Why, to keep a secret.\n\nTATT.  O Lord!\n\nVAL.  Oh, exceeding good to keep a secret; for though she should tell,\nyet she is not to be believed.\n\nTATT.  Hah! good again, faith.\n\nVAL.  I would have music.  Sing me the song that I like.\n\n                                   SONG\n                            Set by MR. FINGER.\n\n   I tell thee, Charmion, could I time retrieve,\n   And could again begin to love and live,\n   To you I should my earliest off\u00e2\u0080\u0099ring give;\n      I know my eyes would lead my heart to you,\n      And I should all my vows and oaths renew,\n      But to be plain, I never would be true.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   For by our weak and weary truth, I find,\n   Love hates to centre in a point assign\u00e2\u0080\u0099d?\n   But runs with joy the circle of the mind.\n      Then never let us chain what should be free,\n      But for relief of either sex agree,\n      Since women love to change, and so do we.\n\nNo more, for I am melancholy.  [_Walks musing_.]\n\nJERE.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, sir.  [_To_ SCANDAL.]\n\nSCAN.  Mr. Foresight, we had best leave him.  He may grow outrageous, and\ndo mischief.\n\nFORE.  I will be directed by you.\n\nJERE.  [_To_ MRS. FRAIL.]  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet, madam?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take care everything\nshall be ready.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Thou shalt do what thou wilt; in short, I will deny thee\nnothing.\n\nTATT.  Madam, shall I wait upon you?  [_To_ ANGELICA.]\n\nANG.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay with him; Mr. Scandal will protect me.  Aunt, Mr.\nTattle desires you would give him leave to wait on you.\n\nTATT.  Pox on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no coming off, now she has said that.  Madam,\nwill you do me the honour?\n\nMRS. FORE.  Mr. Tattle might have used less ceremony.\n\n\n\nSCENE XVII.\n\n\n                      ANGELICA, VALENTINE, SCANDAL.\n\nSCAN.  Jeremy, follow Tattle.\n\nANG.  Mr. Scandal, I only stay till my maid comes, and because I had a\nmind to be rid of Mr. Tattle.\n\nSCAN.  Madam, I am very glad that I overheard a better reason which you\ngave to Mr. Tattle; for his impertinence forced you to acknowledge a\nkindness for Valentine, which you denied to all his sufferings and my\nsolicitations.  So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave him to make use of the discovery, and your\nladyship to the free confession of your inclinations.\n\nANG.  O heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099ns!  You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave me alone with a madman?\n\nSCAN.  No, madam; I only leave a madman to his remedy.\n\n\n\nSCENE XVIII.\n\n\n                           ANGELICA, VALENTINE.\n\nVAL.  Madam, you need not be very much afraid, for I fancy I begin to\ncome to myself.\n\nANG.  Ay, but if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be hanged.  [_Aside_.]\n\nVAL.  You see what disguises love makes us put on.  Gods have been in\ncounterfeited shapes for the same reason; and the divine part of me, my\nmind, has worn this mask of madness and this motley livery, only as the\nslave of love and menial creature of your beauty.\n\nANG.  Mercy on me, how he talks!  Poor Valentine!\n\nVAL.  Nay, faith, now let us understand one another, hypocrisy apart.\nThe comedy draws toward an end, and let us think of leaving acting and be\nourselves; and since you have loved me, you must own I have at length\ndeserved you should confess it.\n\nANG.  [_Sighs_.]  I would I had loved you\u00e2\u0080\u0094for heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n knows I pity you,\nand could I have foreseen the bad effects, I would have striven; but\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late.  [_Sighs_.]\n\nVAL.  What sad effects?\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late?  My seeming madness has deceived\nmy father, and procured me time to think of means to reconcile me to him,\nand preserve the right of my inheritance to his estate; which otherwise,\nby articles, I must this morning have resigned.  And this I had informed\nyou of to-day, but you were gone before I knew you had been here.\n\nANG.  How!  I thought your love of me had caused this transport in your\nsoul; which, it seems, you only counterfeited, for mercenary ends and\nsordid interest.\n\nVAL.  Nay, now you do me wrong; for if any interest was considered it was\nyours, since I thought I wanted more than love to make me worthy of you.\n\nANG.  Then you thought me mercenary.  But how am I deluded by this\ninterval of sense to reason with a madman?\n\nVAL.  Oh, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis barbarous to misunderstand me longer.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIX.\n\n\n                           [_To them_] JEREMY.\n\nANG.  Oh, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reasonable creature\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure he will not have the\nimpudence to persevere.  Come, Jeremy, acknowledge your trick, and\nconfess your master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madness counterfeit.\n\nJERE.  Counterfeit, madam!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll maintain him to be as absolutely and\nsubstantially mad as any freeholder in Bethlehem; nay, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as mad as any\nprojector, fanatic, chymist, lover, or poet in Europe.\n\nVAL.  Sirrah, you be; I am not mad.\n\nANG.  Ha, ha, ha! you see he denies it.\n\nJERE.  O Lord, madam, did you ever know any madman mad enough to own it?\n\nVAL.  Sot, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you apprehend?\n\nANG.  Why, he talked very sensibly just now.\n\nJERE.  Yes, madam; he has intervals.  But you see he begins to look wild\nagain now.\n\nVAL.  Why, you thick-skulled rascal, I tell you the farce is done, and I\nwill be mad no longer.  [_Beats him_.]\n\nANG.  Ha, ha, ha! is he mad or no, Jeremy?\n\nJERE.  Partly, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he does not know his own mind two hours.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nsure I left him just now in the humour to be mad, and I think I have not\nfound him very quiet at this present.  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there?  [_One knocks_.]\n\nVAL.  Go see, you sot.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very glad that I can move your mirth though\nnot your compassion.\n\nANG.  I did not think you had apprehension enough to be exceptions.  But\nmadmen show themselves most by over-pretending to a sound understanding,\nas drunken men do by over-acting sobriety.  I was half inclining to\nbelieve you, till I accidently touched upon your tender part: but now you\nhave restored me to my former opinion and compassion.\n\nJERE.  Sir, your father has sent to know if you are any better yet.  Will\nyou please to be mad, sir, or how?\n\nVAL.  Stupidity!  You know the penalty of all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m worth must pay for the\nconfession of my senses; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m mad, and will be mad to everybody but this\nlady.\n\nJERE.  So\u00e2\u0080\u0094just the very backside of truth,\u00e2\u0080\u0094but lying is a figure in\nspeech that interlards the greatest part of my conversation.  Madam, your\nladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woman.\n\n\n\nSCENE XX.\n\n\n                       VALENTINE, ANGELICA, JENNY.\n\nANG.  Well, have you been there?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come hither.\n\nJENNY.  Yes, madam; Sir Sampson will wait upon you presently.  [_Aside\nto_ ANGELICA.]\n\nVAL.  You are not leaving me in this uncertainty?\n\nANG.  Would anything but a madman complain of uncertainty?  Uncertainty\nand expectation are the joys of life.  Security is an insipid thing, and\nthe overtaking and possessing of a wish discovers the folly of the chase.\nNever let us know one another better, for the pleasure of a masquerade is\ndone when we come to show our faces; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you two things before\nI leave you: I am not the fool you take me for; and you are mad and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow it.\n\n\n\nSCENE XXI.\n\n\n                            VALENTINE, JEREMY.\n\nVAL.  From a riddle you can expect nothing but a riddle.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my\ninstruction and the moral of my lesson.\n\nJERE.  What, is the lady gone again, sir?  I hope you understood one\nanother before she went?\n\nVAL.  Understood!  She is harder to be understood than a piece of\nEgyptian antiquity or an Irish manuscript: you may pore till you spoil\nyour eyes and not improve your knowledge.\n\nJERE.  I have heard \u00e2\u0080\u0099em say, sir, they read hard Hebrew books backwards;\nmaybe you begin to read at the wrong end.\n\nVAL.  They say so of a witch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prayer, and dreams and Dutch almanacs are\nto be understood by contraries.  But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regularity and method in\nthat; she is a medal without a reverse or inscription, for indifference\nhas both sides alike.  Yet, while she does not seem to hate me, I will\npursue her, and know her if it be possible, in spite of the opinion of my\nsatirical friend, Scandal, who says\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n   That women are like tricks by sleight of hand,\n   Which, to admire, we should not understand.\n\n\n\n\nACT V.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SCENE I.\n\n\n                      _A room in Foresight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house_.\n\n                          ANGELICA _and_ JENNY.\n\nANG.  Where is Sir Sampson?  Did you not tell me he would be here before\nme?\n\nJENNY.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the great glass in the dining-room, madam, setting his\ncravat and wig.\n\nANG.  How!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  If he has a mind I should like him, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nsign he likes me; and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than half my design.\n\nJENNY.  I hear him, madam.\n\nANG.  Leave me; and, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear, if Valentine should come, or send, I am\nnot to be spoken with.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n                          ANGELICA, SIR SAMPSON.\n\nSIR SAMP.  I have not been honoured with the commands of a fair lady a\ngreat while,\u00e2\u0080\u0094odd, madam, you have revived me,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not since I was\nfive-and-thirty.\n\nANG.  Why, you have no great reason to complain, Sir Sampson, that is not\nlong ago.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Zooks, but it is, madam, a very great while: to a man that\nadmires a fine woman as much as I do.\n\nANG.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an absolute courtier, Sir Sampson.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Not at all, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u0094odsbud, you wrong me,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am not so old\nneither, to be a bare courtier, only a man of words.  Odd, I have warm\nblood about me yet, and can serve a lady any way.  Come, come, let me\ntell you, you women think a man old too soon, faith and troth you do.\nCome, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t despise fifty; odd, fifty, in a hale constitution, is no such\ncontemptible age.\n\nANG.  Fifty a contemptible age!  Not at all; a very fashionable age, I\nthink.  I assure you, I know very considerable beaus that set a good face\nupon fifty.  Fifty!  I have seen fifty in a side box by candle-light\nout-blossom five-and-twenty.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Outsides, outsides; a pize take \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, mere outsides.  Hang your\nside-box beaus; no, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m none of those, none of your forced trees, that\npretend to blossom in the fall, and bud when they should bring forth\nfruit: I am of a long-lived race, and inherit vigour; none of my\nancestors married till fifty, yet they begot sons and daughters till\nfourscore: I am of your patriarchs, I, a branch of one of your\nantedeluvian families, fellows that the flood could not wash away.  Well,\nmadam, what are your commands?  Has any young rogue affronted you, and\nshall I cut his throat?  Or\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nANG.  No, Sir Sampson, I have no quarrel upon my hands.  I have more\noccasion for your conduct than your courage at this time.  To tell you\nthe truth, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m weary of living single and want a husband.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Odsbud, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis pity you should.  Odd, would she would like\nme, then I should hamper my young rogues.  Odd, would she would; faith\nand troth she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devilish handsome.  [_Aside_.]  Madam, you deserve a good\nhusband, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099twere pity you should be thrown away upon any of these\nyoung idle rogues about the town.  Odd, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er a young fellow\nworth hanging\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is a very young fellow.  Pize on \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, they never think\nbeforehand of anything; and if they commit matrimony, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as they commit\nmurder, out of a frolic, and are ready to hang themselves, or to be\nhanged by the law, the next morning.  Odso, have a care, madam.\n\nANG.  Therefore I ask your advice, Sir Sampson.  I have fortune enough to\nmake any man easy that I can like: if there were such a thing as a young\nagreeable man, with a reasonable stock of good nature and sense\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I\nwould neither have an absolute wit nor a fool.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Odd, you are hard to please, madam: to find a young fellow\nthat is neither a wit in his own eye, nor a fool in the eye of the world,\nis a very hard task.  But, faith and troth, you speak very discreetly;\nfor I hate both a wit and a fool.\n\nANG.  She that marries a fool, Sir Sampson, forfeits the reputation of\nher honesty or understanding; and she that marries a very witty man is a\nslave to the severity and insolent conduct of her husband.  I should like\na man of wit for a lover, because I would have such an one in my power;\nbut I would no more be his wife than his enemy.  For his malice is not a\nmore terrible consequence of his aversion than his jealousy is of his\nlove.\n\nSIR SAMP.  None of old Foresight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sibyls ever uttered such a truth.\nOdsbud, you have won my heart; I hate a wit: I had a son that was spoiled\namong \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, a good hopeful lad, till he learned to be a wit; and might\nhave risen in the state.  But, a pox on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, his wit run him out of his\nmoney, and now his poverty has run him out of his wits.\n\nANG.  Sir Sampson, as your friend, I must tell you you are very much\nabused in that matter: he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more mad than you are.\n\nSIR SAMP.  How, madam!  Would I could prove it.\n\nANG.  I can tell you how that may be done.  But it is a thing that would\nmake me appear to be too much concerned in your affairs.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Odsbud, I believe she likes me.  [_Aside_.]  Ah, madam, all my\naffairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your feet; and I wish, madam,\nthey were in a better posture, that I might make a more becoming offer to\na lady of your incomparable beauty and merit.  If I had Peru in one hand,\nand Mexico in t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other, and the Eastern Empire under my feet, it would\nmake me only a more glorious victim to be offered at the shrine of your\nbeauty.\n\nANG.  Bless me, Sir Sampson, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Odd, madam, I love you.  And if you would take my advice in a\nhusband\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nANG.  Hold, hold, Sir Sampson.  I asked your advice for a husband, and\nyou are giving me your consent.  I was indeed thinking to propose\nsomething like it in jest, to satisfy you about Valentine: for if a match\nwere seemingly carried on between you and me, it would oblige him to\nthrow off his disguise of madness, in apprehension of losing me: for you\nknow he has long pretended a passion for me.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Gadzooks, a most ingenious contrivance\u00e2\u0080\u0094if we were to go\nthrough with it.  But why must the match only be seemingly carried on?\nOdd, let it be a real contract.\n\nANG.  Oh, fie, Sir Sampson, what would the world say?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Say?  They would say you were a wise woman and I a happy man.\nOdd, madam, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love you as long as I live, and leave you a good\njointure when I die.\n\nANG.  Ay; but that is not in your power, Sir Sampson: for when Valentine\nconfesses himself in his senses, he must make over his inheritance to his\nyounger brother.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Odd, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cunning, a wary baggage!  Faith and troth, I like\nyou the better.  But, I warrant you, I have a proviso in the obligation\nin favour of myself.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, I have a trick to turn the settlement\nupon the issue male of our two bodies begotten.  Odsbud, let us find\nchildren and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find an estate!\n\nANG.  Will you?  Well, do you find the estate and leave t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other to me.\n\nSIR SAMP.  O rogue!  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll trust you.  And will you consent?  Is it a\nmatch then?\n\nANG.  Let me consult my lawyer concerning this obligation, and if I find\nwhat you propose practicable, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you my answer.\n\nSIR SAMP.  With all my heart: come in with me, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lend you the\nbond.  You shall consult your lawyer, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll consult a parson.\nOdzooks, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a young man\u00e2\u0080\u0094odzooks, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a young man, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make it\nappear,\u00e2\u0080\u0094odd, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re devilish handsome.  Faith and troth, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very\nhandsome, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very young and very lusty.  Odsbud, hussy, you know how\nto choose, and so do I.  Odd, I think we are very well met.  Give me your\nhand, odd, let me kiss it; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis as warm and as soft\u00e2\u0080\u0094as what?  Odd, as\nt\u00e2\u0080\u0099other hand\u00e2\u0080\u0094give me t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other hand, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll mumble \u00e2\u0080\u0099em and kiss \u00e2\u0080\u0099em till\nthey melt in my mouth.\n\nANG.  Hold, Sir Sampson.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re profuse of your vigour before your time.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spend your estate before you come to it.\n\nSIR SAMP.  No, no, only give you a rent-roll of my possessions.  Ah,\nbaggage, I warrant you for little Sampson.  Odd, Sampson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very good\nname for an able fellow: your Sampsons were strong dogs from the\nbeginning.\n\nANG.  Have a care and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over-act your part.  If you remember,\nSampson, the strongest of the name, pulled an old house over his head at\nlast.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Say you so, hussy?  Come, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go then; odd, I long to be\npulling too; come away.  Odso, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somebody coming.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n                             TATTLE, JEREMY.\n\nTATT.  Is not that she gone out just now?\n\nJERE.  Ay, sir; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going to the place of appointment.  Ah, sir,\nif you are not very faithful and close in this business, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll certainly\nbe the death of a person that has a most extraordinary passion for your\nhonour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service.\n\nTATT.  Ay, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\n\nJERE.  Even my unworthy self, sir.  Sir, I have had an appetite to be fed\nwith your commands a great while; and now, sir, my former master having\nmuch troubled the fountain of his understanding, it is a very plausible\noccasion for me to quench my thirst at the spring of your bounty.  I\nthought I could not recommend myself better to you, sir, than by the\ndelivery of a great beauty and fortune into your arms, whom I have heard\nyou sigh for.\n\nTATT.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make thy fortune; say no more.  Thou art a pretty fellow, and\ncanst carry a message to a lady, in a pretty soft kind of phrase, and\nwith a good persuading accent.\n\nJERE.  Sir, I have the seeds of rhetoric and oratory in my head: I have\nbeen at Cambridge.\n\nTATT.  Ay; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis well enough for a servant to be bred at an university:\nbut the education is a little too pedantic for a gentleman.  I hope you\nare secret in your nature: private, close, ha?\n\nJERE.  Oh, sir, for that, sir, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis my chief talent: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m as secret as the\nhead of Nilus.\n\nTATT.  Ay?  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he, though?  A privy counsellor?\n\nJERE.  O ignorance!  [_Aside_.]  A cunning Egyptian, sir, that with his\narms would overrun the country, yet nobody could ever find out his\nhead-quarters.\n\nTATT.  Close dog!  A good whoremaster, I warrant him:\u00e2\u0080\u0094the time draws\nnigh, Jeremy.  Angelica will be veiled like a nun, and I must be hooded\nlike a friar, ha, Jeremy?\n\nJERE.  Ay, sir; hooded like a hawk, to seize at first sight upon the\nquarry.  It is the whim of my master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madness to be so dressed, and she\nis so in love with him she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll comply with anything to please him.  Poor\nlady, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have reason to pray for me, when she finds what a\nhappy exchange she has made, between a madman and so accomplished a\ngentleman.\n\nTATT.  Ay, faith, so she will, Jeremy: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good friend to her, poor\ncreature.  I swear I do it hardly so much in consideration of myself as\ncompassion to her.\n\nJERE.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis an act of charity, sir, to save a fine woman with thirty\nthousand pound from throwing herself away.\n\nTATT.  So \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis, faith; I might have saved several others in my time, but,\ni\u00e2\u0080\u0099gad, I could never find in my heart to marry anybody before.\n\nJERE.  Well, sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go and tell her my master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming, and meet you\nin half a quarter of an hour with your disguise at your own lodgings.\nYou must talk a little madly: she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distinguish the tone of your\nvoice.\n\nTATT.  No, no; let me alone for a counterfeit.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be ready for you.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n                            TATTLE, MISS PRUE.\n\nMISS.  O Mr. Tattle, are you here?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I have found you; I have\nbeen looking up and down for you like anything, till I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m as tired as\nanything in the world.\n\nTATT.  Oh, pox, how shall I get rid of this foolish girl?  [_Aside_.]\n\nMISS.  Oh, I have pure news, I can tell you, pure news.  I must not marry\nthe seaman now\u00e2\u0080\u0094my father says so.  Why won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you be my husband?  You say\nyou love me, and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be my husband.  And I know you may be my\nhusband now, if you please.\n\nTATT.  Oh, fie, miss; who told you so, child?\n\nMISS.  Why, my father.  I told him that you loved me.\n\nTATT.  Oh, fie, miss; why did you do so?  And who told you so, child?\n\nMISS.  Who?  Why, you did; did not you?\n\nTATT.  Oh, pox, that was yesterday, miss, that was a great while ago,\nchild.  I have been asleep since; slept a whole night, and did not so\nmuch as dream of the matter.\n\nMISS.  Pshaw\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, but I dreamt that it was so, though.\n\nTATT.  Ay, but your father will tell you that dreams come by contraries,\nchild.  Oh, fie; what, we must not love one another now.  Pshaw, that\nwould be a foolish thing indeed.  Fie, fie, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a woman now, and must\nthink of a new man every morning and forget him every night.  No, no, to\nmarry is to be a child again, and play with the same rattle always.  Oh,\nfie, marrying is a paw thing.\n\nMISS.  Well, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you love me as well as you did last night then?\n\nTATT.  No, no, child, you would not have me.\n\nMISS.  No?  Yes, but I would, though.\n\nTATT.  Pshaw, but I tell you you would not.  You forget you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a woman\nand don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know your own mind.\n\nMISS.  But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my father, and he knows my mind.\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\n\n\n                          [_To them_] FORESIGHT.\n\nFORE.  O Mr. Tattle, your servant, you are a close man; but methinks your\nlove to my daughter was a secret I might have been trusted with.  Or had\nyou a mind to try if I could discover it by my art?  Hum, ha!  I think\nthere is something in your physiognomy that has a resemblance of her; and\nthe girl is like me.\n\nTATT.  And so you would infer that you and I are alike?  What does the\nold prig mean?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll banter him, and laugh at him, and leave him.\n[_Aside_.]  I fancy you have a wrong notion of faces.\n\nFORE.  How?  What?  A wrong notion?  How so?\n\nTATT.  In the way of art: I have some taking features, not obvious to\nvulgar eyes, that are indications of a sudden turn of good fortune in the\nlottery of wives, and promise a great beauty and great fortune reserved\nalone for me, by a private intrigue of destiny, kept secret from the\npiercing eye of perspicuity, from all astrologers, and the stars\nthemselves.\n\nFORE.  How!  I will make it appear that what you say is impossible.\n\nTATT.  Sir, I beg your pardon, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in haste\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFORE.  For what?\n\nTATT.  To be married, sir, married.\n\nFORE.  Ay, but pray take me along with you, sir\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nTATT.  No, sir; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis to be done privately.  I never make confidants.\n\nFORE.  Well, but my consent, I mean.  You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t marry my daughter without\nmy consent?\n\nTATT.  Who?  I, sir?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an absolute stranger to you and your daughter,\nsir.\n\nFORE.  Hey day!  What time of the moon is this?\n\nTATT.  Very true, sir, and desire to continue so.  I have no more love\nfor your daughter than I have likeness of you, and I have a secret in my\nheart which you would be glad to know and shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, and yet you shall\nknow it, too, and be sorry for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afterwards.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have you to know, sir,\nthat I am as knowing as the stars, and as secret as the night.  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\ngoing to be married just now, yet did not know of it half an hour ago;\nand the lady stays for me, and does not know of it yet.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nmystery for you: I know you love to untie difficulties.  Or, if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsolve this, stay here a quarter of an hour, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come and explain it\nto you.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\n\n\n                          FORESIGHT, MISS PRUE.\n\nMISS.  O father, why will you let him go?  Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you make him to be my\nhusband?\n\nFORE.  Mercy on us, what do these lunacies portend?  Alas! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad,\nchild, stark wild.\n\nMISS.  What, and must not I have e\u00e2\u0080\u0099er a husband, then?  What, must I go\nto bed to nurse again, and be a child as long as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old woman?\nIndeed but I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  For now my mind is set upon a man, I will have a man\nsome way or other.  Oh, methinks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sick when I think of a man; and if I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have one, I would go to sleep all my life: for when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m awake it\nmakes me wish and long, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know for what.  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be\nalways asleep than sick with thinking.\n\nFORE.  Oh, fearful!  I think the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influenced too.  Hussy, you shall\nhave a rod.\n\nMISS.  A fiddle of a rod, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a husband; and if you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me\none, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get one for myself.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry our Robin the butler; he says\nhe loves me, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a handsome man, and shall be my husband: I warrant\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be my husband, and thank me too, for he told me so.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\n\n\n            [_To them_] SCANDAL, MRS. FORESIGHT, _and_ NURSE.\n\nFORE.  Did he so?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dispatch him for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t presently.  Rogue!  O nurse,\ncome hither.\n\nNURSE.  What is your worship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasure?\n\nFORE.  Here, take your young mistress and lock her up presently, till\nfarther orders from me.  Not a word, Hussy; do what I bid you, no reply,\naway.  And bid Robin make ready to give an account of his plate and\nlinen, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye hear: begone when I bid you.\n\nMRS. FORE.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter, husband?\n\nFORE.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis not convenient to tell you now.  Mr. Scandal, heav\u00e2\u0080\u0099n keep us\nall in our senses\u00e2\u0080\u0094I fear there is a contagious frenzy abroad.  How does\nValentine?\n\nSCAN.  Oh, I hope he will do well again.  I have a message from him to\nyour niece Angelica.\n\nFORE.  I think she has not returned since she went abroad with Sir\nSampson.  Nurse, why are you not gone?\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\n\n\n                 FORESIGHT, SCANDAL, MRS. FORESIGHT, BEN.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mr. Benjamin, he can tell us if his father be come\nhome.\n\nBEN.  Who?  Father?  Ay, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come home with a vengeance.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Why, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nBEN.  Matter!  Why, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad.\n\nFORE.  Mercy on us, I was afraid of this.  And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the handsome young\nwoman, she, as they say, brother Val went mad for, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad too, I\nthink.\n\nFORE.  Oh, my poor niece, my poor niece, is she gone too?  Well, I shall\nrun mad next.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Well, but how mad?  How d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye mean?\n\nBEN.  Nay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you leave to guess.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll undertake to make a voyage\nto Antegoa\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, hold; I mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say so, neither.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sail as far as\nLeghorn and back again before you shall guess at the matter, and do\nnothing else.  Mess, you may take in all the points of the compass, and\nnot hit right.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Your experiment will take up a little too much time.\n\nBEN.  Why, then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new wedding upon the stocks,\nand they two are a-going to be married to rights.\n\nSCAN.  Who?\n\nBEN.  Why, father and\u00e2\u0080\u0094the young woman.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit of her name.\n\nSCAN.  Angelica?\n\nBEN.  Ay, the same.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Sir Sampson and Angelica?  Impossible!\n\nBEN.  That may be\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it is as I tell you.\n\nSCAN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a jest.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it.\n\nBEN.  Look you, friend, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to me whether you believe it or no.\nWhat I say is true, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye see, they are married, or just going to be\nmarried, I know not which.\n\nFORE.  Well, but they are not mad, that is, not lunatic?\n\nBEN.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you may call madness.  But she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mad for a\nhusband, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horn mad, I think, or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er make a match\ntogether.  Here they come.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\n\n               [_To them_] SIR SAMPSON, ANGELICA, BUCKRAM.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Where is this old soothsayer, this uncle of mine elect?  Aha,\nold Foresight, Uncle Foresight, wish me joy, Uncle Foresight, double joy,\nboth as uncle and astrologer; here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conjunction that was not foretold\nin all your Ephemeris.  The brightest star in the blue firmament\u00e2\u0080\u0094_is shot\nfrom above_, _in a jelly of love_, and so forth; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lord of the\nascendant.  Odd, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an old fellow, Foresight; uncle, I mean, a very\nold fellow, Uncle Foresight: and yet you shall live to dance at my\nwedding; faith and troth, you shall.  Odd, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the music of the\nsphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for thee, old Lilly, that we will, and thou shalt lead up a\ndance in Via Lactea.\n\nFORE.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thunderstruck!  You are not married to my niece?\n\nSIR SAMP.  Not absolutely married, uncle; but very near it, within a kiss\nof the matter, as you see.  [_Kisses_ ANGELICA.]\n\nANG.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis very true, indeed, uncle.  I hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be my father, and\ngive me.\n\nSIR SAMP.  That he shall, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll burn his globes.  Body o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me, he shall\nbe thy father, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make him thy father, and thou shalt make me a father,\nand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make thee a mother, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beget sons and daughters enough to\nput the weekly bills out of countenance.\n\nSCAN.  Death and hell!  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Valentine?\n\n\n\nSCENE X.\n\n\n     SIR SAMPSON, ANGELICA, FORESIGHT, MRS. FORESIGHT, BEN, BUCKRAM.\n\nMRS. FORE.  This is so surprising.\n\nSIR SAMP.  How!  What does my aunt say?  Surprising, aunt?  Not at all\nfor a young couple to make a match in winter: not at all.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plot to\nundermine cold weather, and destroy that usurper of a bed called a\nwarming-pan.\n\nMRS. FORE.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad to hear you have so much fire in you, Sir Sampson.\n\nBEN.  Mess, I fear his fire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little better than tinder; mayhap it will\nonly serve to light up a match for somebody else.  The young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nhandsome young woman, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny it: but, father, if I might be your\npilot in this case, you should not marry her.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the same thing\nas if so be you should sail so far as the Straits without provision.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Who gave you authority to speak, sirrah?  To your element,\nfish, be mute, fish, and to sea, rule your helm, sirrah, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t direct me.\n\nBEN.  Well, well, take you care of your own helm, or you mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep your\nnew vessel steady.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Why, you impudent tarpaulin!  Sirrah, do you bring your\nforecastle jests upon your father?  But I shall be even with you, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngive you a groat.  Mr. Buckram, is the conveyance so worded that nothing\ncan possibly descend to this scoundrel?  I would not so much as have him\nhave the prospect of an estate, though there were no way to come to it,\nbut by the North-East Passage.\n\nBUCK.  Sir, it is drawn according to your directions; there is not the\nleast cranny of the law unstopt.\n\nBEN.  Lawyer, I believe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many a cranny and leak unstopt in your\nconscience.  If so be that one had a pump to your bosom, I believe we\nshould discover a foul hold.  They say a witch will sail in a sieve: but\nI believe the devil would not venture aboard o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your conscience.  And\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for you.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Hold your tongue, sirrah.  How now, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here?\n\n\n\nSCENE XI.\n\n\n                   [_To them_] TATTLE _and_ MRS. FRAIL.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  O sister, the most unlucky accident.\n\nMRS. FORE.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nTATT.  Oh, the two most unfortunate poor creatures in the world we are.\n\nFORE.  Bless us!  How so?\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Ah, Mr. Tattle and I, poor Mr. Tattle and I are\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nspeak it out.\n\nTATT.  Nor I.  But poor Mrs. Frail and I are\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  Married.\n\nMRS. FORE.  Married!  How?\n\nTATT.  Suddenly\u00e2\u0080\u0094before we knew where we were\u00e2\u0080\u0094that villain Jeremy, by the\nhelp of disguises, tricked us into one another.\n\nFORE.  Why, you told me just now you went hence in haste to be married.\n\nANG.  But I believe Mr. Tattle meant the favour to me: I thank him.\n\nTATT.  I did, as I hope to be saved, madam; my intentions were good.  But\nthis is the most cruel thing, to marry one does not know how, nor why,\nnor wherefore.  The devil take me if ever I was so much concerned at\nanything in my life.\n\nANG.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis very unhappy, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for one another.\n\nTATT.  The least in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is for my part: I speak for myself.\nGad, I never had the least thought of serious kindness.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never liked\nanybody less in my life.  Poor woman!  Gad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry for her too, for I\nhave no reason to hate her neither; but I believe I shall lead her a\ndamned sort of a life.\n\nMRS. FORE.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than no husband at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a coxcomb.\n[_To_ FRAIL.]\n\nMRS. FRAIL [_to her_].  Ay, ay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no worse.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nay, for my part\nI always despised Mr. Tattle of all things; nothing but his being my\nhusband could have made me like him less.\n\nTATT.  Look you there, I thought as much.  Pox on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I wish we could keep\nit secret; why, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any of this company would speak of it.\n\nMRS. FRAIL.  But, my dear, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible: the parson and that rogue\nJeremy will publish it.\n\nTATT.  Ay, my dear, so they will, as you say.\n\nANG.  Oh, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll agree very well in a little time; custom will make it\neasy to you.\n\nTATT.  Easy!  Pox on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I shall sleep to-night.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Sleep, quotha!  No; why, you would not sleep o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your\nwedding-night?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an older fellow than you, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to sleep.\n\nBEN.  Why, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another match now, as thof a couple of privateers were\nlooking for a prize and should fall foul of one another.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry for\nthe young man with all my heart.  Look you, friend, if I may advise you,\nwhen she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going\u00e2\u0080\u0094for that you must expect, I have experience of her\u00e2\u0080\u0094when\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going, let her go.  For no matrimony is tough enough to hold her;\nand if she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drag her anchor along with her, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break her cable,\nI can tell you that.  Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here?  The madman?\n\n\n\nSCENE _the Last_.\n\n\n  VALENTINE, SCANDAL, SIR SAMPSON, ANGELICA, FORESIGHT, MRS. FORESIGHT,\n                TATTLE, MRS. FRAIL, BEN, JEREMY, BUCKRAM.\n\nVAL.  No; here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fool, and if occasion be, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it under my\nhand.\n\nSIR SAMP.  How now?\n\nVAL.  Sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m come to acknowledge my errors, and ask your pardon.\n\nSIR SAMP.  What, have you found your senses at last then?  In good time,\nsir.\n\nVAL.  You were abused, sir: I never was distracted.\n\nFORE.  How!  Not mad!  Mr. Scandal\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nSCAN.  No, really, sir.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m his witness; it was all counterfeit.\n\nVAL.  I thought I had reasons\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it was a poor contrivance, the effect\nhas shown it such.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Contrivance!  What, to cheat me? to cheat your father?\nSirrah, could you hope to prosper?\n\nVAL.  Indeed, I thought, sir, when the father endeavoured to undo the\nson, it was a reasonable return of nature.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Very good, sir.  Mr. Buckram, are you ready?  Come, sir, will\nyou sign and seal?\n\nVAL.  If you please, sir; but first I would ask this lady one question.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Sir, you must ask me leave first.  That lady?  No, sir, you\nshall ask that lady no questions till you have asked her blessing, sir:\nthat lady is to be my wife.\n\nVAL.  I have heard as much, sir; but I would have it from her own mouth.\n\nSIR SAMP.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as much as to say I lie, sir, and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe\nwhat I say.\n\nVAL.  Pardon me, sir.  But I reflect that I very lately counterfeited\nmadness; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know but the frolic may go round.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Come, chuck, satisfy him, answer him.  Come, come, Mr.\nBuckram, the pen and ink.\n\nBUCK.  Here it is, sir, with the deed; all is ready.  [VALENTINE _goes\nto_ ANGELICA.]\n\nANG.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis true, you have a great while pretended love to me; nay, what\nif you were sincere?  Still you must pardon me if I think my own\ninclinations have a better right to dispose of my person than yours.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Are you answered now, sir?\n\nVAL.  Yes, sir.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your plot, sir? and your contrivance now, sir?  Will\nyou sign, sir?  Come, will you sign and seal?\n\nVAL.  With all my heart, sir.\n\nSCAN.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath, you are not mad indeed, to ruin yourself?\n\nVAL.  I have been disappointed of my only hope, and he that loses hope\nmay part with anything.  I never valued fortune but as it was subservient\nto my pleasure, and my only pleasure was to please this lady.  I have\nmade many vain attempts, and find at last that nothing but my ruin can\neffect it; which, for that reason, I will sign to\u00e2\u0080\u0094give me the paper.\n\nANG.  Generous Valentine!  [_Aside_.]\n\nBUCK.  Here is the deed, sir.\n\nVAL.  But where is the bond by which I am obliged to sign this?\n\nBUCK.  Sir Sampson, you have it.\n\nANG.  No, I have it, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use it as I would everything that is an\nenemy to Valentine.  [_Tears the paper_.]\n\nSIR SAMP.  How now?\n\nVAL.  Ha!\n\nANG.  Had I the world to give you, it could not make me worthy of so\ngenerous and faithful a passion.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my hand:\u00e2\u0080\u0094my heart was always\nyours, and struggled very hard to make this utmost trial of your virtue.\n[_To_ VALENTINE.]\n\nVAL.  Between pleasure and amazement I am lost.  But on my knees I take\nthe blessing.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Oons, what is the meaning of this?\n\nBEN.  Mess, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the wind changed again.  Father, you and I may make a\nvoyage together now.\n\nANG.  Well, Sir Sampson, since I have played you a trick, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll advise you\nhow you may avoid such another.  Learn to be a good father, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nnever get a second wife.  I always loved your son, and hated your\nunforgiving nature.  I was resolved to try him to the utmost; I have\ntried you too, and know you both.  You have not more faults than he has\nvirtues, and \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis hardly more pleasure to me that I can make him and\nmyself happy than that I can punish you.\n\nVAL.  If my happiness could receive addition, this kind surprise would\nmake it double.\n\nSIR SAMP.  Oons, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a crocodile.\n\nFORE.  Really, Sir Sampson, this is a sudden eclipse.\n\nSIR SAMP.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an illiterate old fool, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m another.\n\nTATT.  If the gentleman is in disorder for want of a wife, I can spare\nhim mine.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, are you there, sir?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m indebted to you for my happiness.\n[_To_ JEREMY.]\n\nJERE.  Sir, I ask you ten thousand pardons: \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas an errant mistake.  You\nsee, sir, my master was never mad, nor anything like it.  Then how could\nit be otherwise?\n\nVAL.  Tattle, I thank you; you would have interposed between me and\nheaven, but Providence laid purgatory in your way.  You have but justice.\n\nSCAN.  I hear the fiddles that Sir Sampson provided for his own wedding;\nmethinks \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis pity they should not be employed when the match is so much\nmended.  Valentine, though it be morning, we may have a dance.\n\nVAL.  Anything, my friend, everything that looks like joy and transport.\n\nSCAN.  Call \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, Jeremy.\n\nANG.  I have done dissembling now, Valentine; and if that coldness which\nI have always worn before you should turn to an extreme fondness, you\nmust not suspect it.\n\nVAL.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll prevent that suspicion: for I intend to dote to that\nimmoderate degree that your fondness shall never distinguish itself\nenough to be taken notice of.  If ever you seem to love too much, it must\nbe only when I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love enough.\n\nANG.  Have a care of promises; you know you are apt to run more in debt\nthan you are able to pay.\n\nVAL.  Therefore I yield my body as your prisoner, and make your best\non\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nSCAN.  The music stays for you.  [_Dance_.]\n\nSCAN.  Well, madam, you have done exemplary justice in punishing an\ninhuman father and rewarding a faithful lover.  But there is a third good\nwork which I, in particular, must thank you for: I was an infidel to your\nsex, and you have converted me.  For now I am convinced that all women\nare not like fortune, blind in bestowing favours, either on those who do\nnot merit or who do not want \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\n\nANG.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis an unreasonable accusation that you lay upon our sex: you tax\nus with injustice, only to cover your own want of merit.  You would all\nhave the reward of love, but few have the constancy to stay till it\nbecomes your due.  Men are generally hypocrites and infidels: they\npretend to worship, but have neither zeal nor faith.  How few, like\nValentine, would persevere even to martyrdom, and sacrifice their\ninterest to their constancy!  In admiring me, you misplace the novelty.\n\n   The miracle to-day is, that we find\n   A lover true; not that a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind.\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOVE FOR LOVE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 1244-0.txt or 1244-0.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/2\/4\/1244\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":747,"split":"train"}
