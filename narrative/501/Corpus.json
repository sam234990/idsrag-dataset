{"ori_id":"7509505e9ad6632c32e3f831f2d1026aeb6a6f77","title":"Poor Folk","context":"Poor Folk\n Varvara Dobroselova and Makar Devushkin are second cousins twice-removed and live across from each other on the same street in terrible apartments. Devushkin's, for example, is merely a portioned-off section of the kitchen, and he lives with several other tenants, such as the Gorshkovs, whose son who groans in agonizing hunger almost the entire story and eventually dies. Devushkin and Dobroselova exchange letters attesting to their terrible living conditions and the former frequently squanders his money on gifts for her.\nThe reader progressively learns their history. Dobroselova originally lived in the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually falls in love with Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.\nDevushkin works as a lowly copyist, frequently belittled and picked on by his colleagues. His clothing is worn and dirty, and his living conditions are perhaps worse than Dobroselova's. He considers himself a rat in society. He and Dobroselova exchange letters (and occasional visits that are never detailed), and eventually they also begin to exchange books. Devushkin becomes offended when she sends him a copy of \"The Overcoat\", because he finds the main character is living a life similar to his own.\nDobroselova considers moving to another part of the city where she can work as a governess. Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.\nThe writer Ratazyayev, who jokes about using Devushkin as a character in one of his stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.\nShe asks Devushkin to find linen for her and begins to talk about various luxuries, but leaves him alone in the end despite his improving fortunes. In the last correspondence in the story, on September 29, Devushkin begs Dobroselova to write to him. Dobroselova responds saying that \"all is over\" an to not forget her. The last letter is from Devushkin saying that he loves her and that he will die when he leaves her.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Poor Folk, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

J. Hogarth\n\n\n\n\nApril 8th\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--How happy I was last night--how\nimmeasurably, how impossibly happy! That was because for once in your\nlife you had relented so far as to obey my wishes. At about eight\no'clock I awoke from sleep (you know, my beloved one, that I always like\nto sleep for a short hour after my work is done)--I awoke, I say, and,\nlighting a candle, prepared my paper to write, and trimmed my pen. Then\nsuddenly, for some reason or another, I raised my eyes--and felt my\nvery heart leap within me! For you had understood what I wanted, you had\nunderstood what my heart was craving for. Yes, I perceived that a corner\nof the curtain in your window had been looped up and fastened to the\ncornice as I had suggested should be done; and it seemed to me that your\ndear face was glimmering at the window, and that you were looking at me\nfrom out of the darkness of your room, and that you were thinking of\nme. Yet how vexed I felt that I could not distinguish your sweet face\nclearly! For there was a time when you and I could see one another\nwithout any difficulty at all. Ah me, but old age is not always a\nblessing, my beloved one! At this very moment everything is standing\nawry to my eyes, for a man needs only to work late overnight in his\nwriting of something or other for, in the morning, his eyes to be red,\nand the tears to be gushing from them in a way that makes him ashamed to\nbe seen before strangers. However, I was able to picture to myself your\nbeaming smile, my angel--your kind, bright smile; and in my heart there\nlurked just such a feeling as on the occasion when I first kissed you,\nmy little Barbara. Do you remember that, my darling? Yet somehow you\nseemed to be threatening me with your tiny finger. Was it so, little\nwanton? You must write and tell me about it in your next letter.\n\nBut what think you of the plan of the curtain, Barbara? It is a charming\none, is it not? No matter whether I be at work, or about to retire to\nrest, or just awaking from sleep, it enables me to know that you are\nthinking of me, and remembering me--that you are both well and happy.\nThen when you lower the curtain, it means that it is time that I, Makar\nAlexievitch, should go to bed; and when again you raise the curtain, it\nmeans that you are saying to me, \"Good morning,\" and asking me how I am,\nand whether I have slept well. \"As for myself,\" adds the curtain, \"I am\naltogether in good health and spirits, glory be to God!\" Yes, my heart's\ndelight, you see how easy a plan it was to devise, and how much writing\nit will save us! It is a clever plan, is it not? And it was my own\ninvention, too! Am I not cunning in such matters, Barbara Alexievna?\n\nWell, next let me tell you, dearest, that last night I slept better\nand more soundly than I had ever hoped to do, and that I am the more\ndelighted at the fact in that, as you know, I had just settled into a\nnew lodging--a circumstance only too apt to keep one from sleeping! This\nmorning, too, I arose (joyous and full of love) at cockcrow. How good\nseemed everything at that hour, my darling! When I opened my window I\ncould see the sun shining, and hear the birds singing, and smell the air\nladen with scents of spring. In short, all nature was awaking to life\nagain. Everything was in consonance with my mood; everything seemed fair\nand spring-like. Moreover, I had a fancy that I should fare well today.\nBut my whole thoughts were bent upon you. \"Surely,\" thought I, \"we\nmortals who dwell in pain and sorrow might with reason envy the birds\nof heaven which know not either!\" And my other thoughts were similar\nto these. In short, I gave myself up to fantastic comparisons. A little\nbook which I have says the same kind of thing in a variety of ways. For\ninstance, it says that one may have many, many fancies, my Barbara--that\nas soon as the spring comes on, one's thoughts become uniformly pleasant\nand sportive and witty, for the reason that, at that season, the mind\ninclines readily to tenderness, and the world takes on a more roseate\nhue. From that little book of mine I have culled the following passage,\nand written it down for you to see. In particular does the author\nexpress a longing similar to my own, where he writes:\n\n\"Why am I not a bird free to seek its quest?\"\n\nAnd he has written much else, God bless him!\n\nBut tell me, my love--where did you go for your walk this morning? Even\nbefore I had started for the office you had taken flight from your room,\nand passed through the courtyard--yes, looking as vernal-like as a\nbird in spring. What rapture it gave me to see you! Ah, little Barbara,\nlittle Barbara, you must never give way to grief, for tears are of no\navail, nor sorrow. I know this well--I know it of my own experience. So\ndo you rest quietly until you have regained your health a little. But\nhow is our good Thedora? What a kind heart she has! You write that she\nis now living with you, and that you are satisfied with what she does.\nTrue, you say that she is inclined to grumble, but do not mind that,\nBarbara. God bless her, for she is an excellent soul!\n\nBut what sort of an abode have I lighted upon, Barbara Alexievna? What\nsort of a tenement, do you think, is this? Formerly, as you know, I used\nto live in absolute stillness--so much so that if a fly took wing\nit could plainly be heard buzzing. Here, however, all is turmoil and\nshouting and clatter. The PLAN of the tenement you know already. Imagine\na long corridor, quite dark, and by no means clean. To the right a dead\nwall, and to the left a row of doors stretching as far as the line of\nrooms extends. These rooms are tenanted by different people--by one,\nby two, or by three lodgers as the case may be, but in this arrangement\nthere is no sort of system, and the place is a perfect Noah's Ark. Most\nof the lodgers are respectable, educated, and even bookish people. In\nparticular they include a tchinovnik (one of the literary staff in some\ngovernment department), who is so well-read that he can expound Homer or\nany other author--in fact, ANYTHING, such a man of talent is he! Also,\nthere are a couple of officers (for ever playing cards), a midshipman,\nand an English tutor. But, to amuse you, dearest, let me describe these\npeople more categorically in my next letter, and tell you in detail\nabout their lives. As for our landlady, she is a dirty little old woman\nwho always walks about in a dressing-gown and slippers, and never ceases\nto shout at Theresa. I myself live in the kitchen--or, rather, in a\nsmall room which forms part of the kitchen. The latter is a very large,\nbright, clean, cheerful apartment with three windows in it, and a\npartition-wall which, running outwards from the front wall, makes a sort\nof little den, a sort of extra room, for myself. Everything in this den\nis comfortable and convenient, and I have, as I say, a window to myself.\nSo much for a description of my dwelling-place. Do not think, dearest,\nthat in all this there is any hidden intention. The fact that I live in\nthe kitchen merely means that I live behind the partition wall in that\napartment--that I live quite alone, and spend my time in a quiet fashion\ncompounded of trifles. For furniture I have provided myself with a\nbed, a table, a chest of drawers, and two small chairs. Also, I have\nsuspended an ikon. True, better rooms MAY exist in the world than\nthis--much better rooms; yet COMFORT is the chief thing. In fact, I\nhave made all my arrangements for comfort's sake alone; so do not for a\nmoment imagine that I had any other end in view. And since your window\nhappens to be just opposite to mine, and since the courtyard between us\nis narrow and I can see you as you pass,--why, the result is that this\nmiserable wretch will be able to live at once more happily and with less\noutlay. The dearest room in this house costs, with board, thirty-five\nroubles--more than my purse could well afford; whereas MY room costs\nonly twenty-four, though formerly I used to pay thirty, and so had to\ndeny myself many things (I could drink tea but seldom, and never could\nindulge in tea and sugar as I do now). But, somehow, I do not like\nhaving to go without tea, for everyone else here is respectable, and the\nfact makes me ashamed. After all, one drinks tea largely to please one's\nfellow men, Barbara, and to give oneself tone and an air of gentility\n(though, of myself, I care little about such things, for I am not a\nman of the finicking sort). Yet think you that, when all things\nneedful--boots and the rest--have been paid for, much will remain? Yet I\nought not to grumble at my salary,--I am quite satisfied with it; it is\nsufficient. It has sufficed me now for some years, and, in addition, I\nreceive certain gratuities.\n\nWell good-bye, my darling. I have bought you two little pots of\ngeraniums--quite cheap little pots, too--as a present. Perhaps you would\nalso like some mignonette? Mignonette it shall be if only you will write\nto inform me of everything in detail. Also, do not misunderstand the\nfact that I have taken this room, my dearest. Convenience and nothing\nelse, has made me do so. The snugness of the place has caught my fancy.\nAlso, I shall be able to save money here, and to hoard it against the\nfuture. Already I have saved a little money as a beginning. Nor must\nyou despise me because I am such an insignificant old fellow that a fly\ncould break me with its wing. True, I am not a swashbuckler; but perhaps\nthere may also abide in me the spirit which should pertain to every man\nwho is at once resigned and sure of himself. Good-bye, then, again, my\nangel. I have now covered close upon a whole two sheets of notepaper,\nthough I ought long ago to have been starting for the office. I kiss\nyour hands, and remain ever your devoted slave, your faithful friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\nP.S.--One thing I beg of you above all things--and that is, that you\nwill answer this letter as FULLY as possible. With the letter I send you\na packet of bonbons. Eat them for your health's sake, nor, for the love\nof God, feel any uneasiness about me. Once more, dearest one, good-bye.\n\n\n\n\nApril 8th\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Do you know, must quarrel with you. Yes,\ngood Makar Alexievitch, I really cannot accept your presents, for I know\nwhat they must have cost you--I know to what privations and self-denial\nthey must have led. How many times have I not told you that I stand in\nneed of NOTHING, of absolutely NOTHING, as well as that I shall never be\nin a position to recompense you for all the kindly acts with which you\nhave loaded me? Why, for instance, have you sent me geraniums? A little\nsprig of balsam would not have mattered so much--but geraniums! Only\nhave I to let fall an unguarded word--for example, about geraniums--and\nat once you buy me some! How much they must have cost you! Yet what a\ncharm there is in them, with their flaming petals! Wherever did you\nget these beautiful plants? I have set them in my window as the most\nconspicuous place possible, while on the floor I have placed a bench\nfor my other flowers to stand on (since you are good enough to enrich me\nwith such presents). Unfortunately, Thedora, who, with her sweeping and\npolishing, makes a perfect sanctuary of my room, is not over-pleased\nat the arrangement. But why have you sent me also bonbons? Your letter\ntells me that something special is afoot with you, for I find in it so\nmuch about paradise and spring and sweet odours and the songs of birds.\nSurely, thought I to myself when I received it, this is as good as\npoetry! Indeed, verses are the only thing that your letter lacks,\nMakar Alexievitch. And what tender feelings I can read in it--what\nroseate-coloured fancies! To the curtain, however, I had never given a\nthought. The fact is that when I moved the flower-pots, it LOOPED ITSELF\nup. There now!\n\nAh, Makar Alexievitch, you neither speak of nor give any account of what\nyou have spent upon me. You hope thereby to deceive me, to make it\nseem as though the cost always falls upon you alone, and that there\nis nothing to conceal. Yet I KNOW that for my sake you deny yourself\nnecessaries. For instance, what has made you go and take the room which\nyou have done, where you will be worried and disturbed, and where you\nhave neither elbow-space nor comfort--you who love solitude, and never\nlike to have any one near you? To judge from your salary, I should think\nthat you might well live in greater ease than that. Also, Thedora tells\nme that your circumstances used to be much more affluent than they are\nat present. Do you wish, then, to persuade me that your whole existence\nhas been passed in loneliness and want and gloom, with never a cheering\nword to help you, nor a seat in a friend's chimney-corner? Ah, kind\ncomrade, how my heart aches for you! But do not overtask your health,\nMakar Alexievitch. For instance, you say that your eyes are over-weak\nfor you to go on writing in your office by candle-light. Then why do so?\nI am sure that your official superiors do not need to be convinced of\nyour diligence!\n\nOnce more I implore you not to waste so much money upon me. I know\nhow much you love me, but I also know that you are not rich.... This\nmorning I too rose in good spirits. Thedora had long been at work; and\nit was time that I too should bestir myself. Indeed I was yearning to\ndo so, so I went out for some silk, and then sat down to my labours. All\nthe morning I felt light-hearted and cheerful. Yet now my thoughts are\nonce more dark and sad--once more my heart is ready to sink.\n\nAh, what is going to become of me? What will be my fate? To have to be\nso uncertain as to the future, to have to be unable to foretell what is\ngoing to happen, distresses me deeply. Even to look back at the past\nis horrible, for it contains sorrow that breaks my very heart at the\nthought of it. Yes, a whole century in tears could I spend because of\nthe wicked people who have wrecked my life!\n\nBut dusk is coming on, and I must set to work again. Much else should I\nhave liked to write to you, but time is lacking, and I must hasten. Of\ncourse, to write this letter is a pleasure enough, and could never be\nwearisome; but why do you not come to see me in person? Why do you not,\nMakar Alexievitch? You live so close to me, and at least SOME of your\ntime is your own. I pray you, come. I have just seen Theresa. She was\nlooking so ill, and I felt so sorry for her, that I gave her twenty\nkopecks. I am almost falling asleep. Write to me in fullest detail, both\nconcerning your mode of life, and concerning the people who live with\nyou, and concerning how you fare with them. I should so like to know!\nYes, you must write again. Tonight I have purposely looped the curtain\nup. Go to bed early, for, last night, I saw your candle burning until\nnearly midnight. Goodbye! I am now feeling sad and weary. Ah that\nI should have to spend such days as this one has been. Again\ngood-bye.--Your friend,\n\nBARBARA DOBROSELOVA.\n\n\n\n\nApril 8th\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--To think that a day like this should have\nfallen to my miserable lot! Surely you are making fun of an old man?...\nHowever, it was my own fault--my own fault entirely. One ought not to\ngrow old holding a lock of Cupid's hair in one's hand. Naturally one is\nmisunderstood.... Yet man is sometimes a very strange being. By all the\nSaints, he will talk of doing things, yet leave them undone, and remain\nlooking the kind of fool from whom may the Lord preserve us!... Nay, I\nam not angry, my beloved; I am only vexed to think that I should have\nwritten to you in such stupid, flowery phraseology. Today I went hopping\nand skipping to the office, for my heart was under your influence, and\nmy soul was keeping holiday, as it were. Yes, everything seemed to\nbe going well with me. Then I betook myself to my work. But with what\nresult? I gazed around at the old familiar objects, at the old familiar\ngrey and gloomy objects. They looked just the same as before. Yet\nWERE those the same inkstains, the same tables and chairs, that I had\nhitherto known? Yes, they WERE the same, exactly the same; so why should\nI have gone off riding on Pegasus' back? Whence had that mood arisen?\nIt had arisen from the fact that a certain sun had beamed upon me, and\nturned the sky to blue. But why so? Why is it, sometimes, that sweet\nodours seem to be blowing through a courtyard where nothing of the sort\ncan be? They must be born of my foolish fancy, for a man may stray so\nfar into sentiment as to forget his immediate surroundings, and to give\nway to the superfluity of fond ardour with which his heart is charged.\nOn the other hand, as I walked home from the office at nightfall my feet\nseemed to lag, and my head to be aching. Also, a cold wind seemed to be\nblowing down my back (enraptured with the spring, I had gone out clad\nonly in a thin overcoat). Yet you have misunderstood my sentiments,\ndearest. They are altogether different to what you suppose. It is a\npurely paternal feeling that I have for you. I stand towards you in\nthe position of a relative who is bound to watch over your lonely\norphanhood. This I say in all sincerity, and with a single purpose,\nas any kinsman might do. For, after all, I AM a distant kinsman of\nyours--the seventh drop of water in the pudding, as the proverb has\nit--yet still a kinsman, and at the present time your nearest relative\nand protector, seeing that where you had the right to look for help and\nprotection, you found only treachery and insult. As for poetry, I may\nsay that I consider it unbecoming for a man of my years to devote his\nfaculties to the making of verses. Poetry is rubbish. Even boys at\nschool ought to be whipped for writing it.\n\nWhy do you write thus about \"comfort\" and \"peace\" and the rest? I am\nnot a fastidious man, nor one who requires much. Never in my life have I\nbeen so comfortable as now. Why, then, should I complain in my old age?\nI have enough to eat, I am well dressed and booted. Also, I have my\ndiversions. You see, I am not of noble blood. My father himself was not\na gentleman; he and his family had to live even more plainly than I do.\nNor am I a milksop. Nevertheless, to speak frankly, I do not like my\npresent abode so much as I used to like my old one. Somehow the latter\nseemed more cosy, dearest. Of course, this room is a good one enough;\nin fact, in SOME respects it is the more cheerful and interesting of the\ntwo. I have nothing to say against it--no. Yet I miss the room that used\nto be so familiar to me. Old lodgers like myself soon grow as attached\nto our chattels as to a kinsman. My old room was such a snug little\nplace! True, its walls resembled those of any other room--I am not\nspeaking of that; the point is that the recollection of them seems to\nhaunt my mind with sadness. Curious that recollections should be so\nmournful! Even what in that room used to vex me and inconvenience me now\nlooms in a purified light, and figures in my imagination as a thing to\nbe desired. We used to live there so quietly--I and an old landlady\nwho is now dead. How my heart aches to remember her, for she was a good\nwoman, and never overcharged for her rooms. Her whole time was spent in\nmaking patchwork quilts with knitting-needles that were an arshin [An\nell.] long. Oftentimes we shared the same candle and board. Also she had\na granddaughter, Masha--a girl who was then a mere baby, but must now be\na girl of thirteen. This little piece of mischief, how she used to make\nus laugh the day long! We lived together, a happy family of three. Often\nof a long winter's evening we would first have tea at the big round\ntable, and then betake ourselves to our work; the while that, to amuse\nthe child and to keep her out of mischief, the old lady would set\nherself to tell stories. What stories they were!--though stories less\nsuitable for a child than for a grown-up, educated person. My word! Why,\nI myself have sat listening to them, as I smoked my pipe, until I have\nforgotten about work altogether. And then, as the story grew grimmer,\nthe little child, our little bag of mischief, would grow thoughtful in\nproportion, and clasp her rosy cheeks in her tiny hands, and, hiding her\nface, press closer to the old landlady. Ah, how I loved to see her at\nthose moments! As one gazed at her one would fail to notice how the\ncandle was flickering, or how the storm was swishing the snow about the\ncourtyard. Yes, that was a goodly life, my Barbara, and we lived it\nfor nearly twenty years.... How my tongue does carry me away! Maybe\nthe subject does not interest you, and I myself find it a not over-easy\nsubject to recall--especially at the present time.\n\nDarkness is falling, and Theresa is busying herself with something or\nanother. My head and my back are aching, and even my thoughts seem to\nbe in pain, so strangely do they occur. Yes, my heart is sad today,\nBarbara.... What is it you have written to me?----\"Why do you not come\nin PERSON to see me?\" Dear one, what would people say? I should have\nbut to cross the courtyard for people to begin noticing us, and asking\nthemselves questions. Gossip and scandal would arise, and there would be\nread into the affair quite another meaning than the real one. No, little\nangel, it were better that I should see you tomorrow at Vespers. That\nwill be the better plan, and less hurtful to us both. Nor must you chide\nme, beloved, because I have written you a letter like this (reading it\nthrough, I see it to be all odds and ends); for I am an old man now,\ndear Barbara, and an uneducated one. Little learning had I in my youth,\nand things refuse to fix themselves in my brain when I try to learn\nthem anew. No, I am not skilled in letter-writing, Barbara, and, without\nbeing told so, or any one laughing at me for it, I know that, whenever\nI try to describe anything with more than ordinary distinctness, I fall\ninto the mistake of talking sheer rubbish.... I saw you at your window\ntoday--yes, I saw you as you were drawing down the blind! Good-bye,\ngoodbye, little Barbara, and may God keep you! Good-bye, my own Barbara\nAlexievna!--Your sincere friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\nP.S.--Do not think that I could write to you in a satirical vein, for I\nam too old to show my teeth to no purpose, and people would laugh at me,\nand quote our Russian proverb: \"Who diggeth a pit for another one, the\nsame shall fall into it himself.\"\n\n\n\n\nApril 9th\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Are not you, my friend and benefactor,\njust a little ashamed to repine and give way to such despondency? And\nsurely you are not offended with me? Ah! Though often thoughtless in my\nspeech, I never should have imagined that you would take my words as\na jest at your expense. Rest assured that NEVER should I make sport of\nyour years or of your character. Only my own levity is at fault; still\nmore, the fact that I am so weary of life.\n\nWhat will such a feeling not engender? To tell you the truth, I had\nsupposed that YOU were jesting in your letter; wherefore, my heart was\nfeeling heavy at the thought that you could feel so displeased with\nme. Kind comrade and helper, you will be doing me an injustice if for\na single moment you ever suspect that I am lacking in feeling or in\ngratitude towards you. My heart, believe me, is able to appraise at\nits true worth all that you have done for me by protecting me from my\nenemies, and from hatred and persecution. Never shall I cease to pray\nto God for you; and, should my prayers ever reach Him and be received of\nHeaven, then assuredly fortune will smile upon you!\n\nToday I am not well. By turns I shiver and flush with heat, and Thedora\nis greatly disturbed about me.... Do not scruple to come and see me,\nMakar Alexievitch. How can it concern other people what you do? You and\nI are well enough acquainted with each other, and one's own affairs are\none's own affairs. Goodbye, Makar Alexievitch, for I have come to the\nend of all I had to say, and am feeling too unwell to write more. Again\nI beg of you not to be angry with me, but to rest assured of my constant\nrespect and attachment.--Your humble, devoted servant,\n\nBARBARA DOBROSELOVA.\n\n\n\n\nApril 12th\n\nDEAREST MISTRESS BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I pray you, my beloved, to tell\nme what ails you. Every one of your letters fills me with alarm. On the\nother hand, in every letter I urge you to be more careful of yourself,\nand to wrap up yourself warmly, and to avoid going out in bad weather,\nand to be in all things prudent. Yet you go and disobey me! Ah, little\nangel, you are a perfect child! I know well that you are as weak as a\nblade of grass, and that, no matter what wind blows upon you, you are\nready to fade. But you must be careful of yourself, dearest; you MUST\nlook after yourself better; you MUST avoid all risks, lest you plunge\nyour friends into desolation and despair.\n\nDearest, you also express a wish to learn the details of my daily life\nand surroundings. That wish I hasten to satisfy. Let me begin at\nthe beginning, since, by doing so, I shall explain things more\nsystematically. In the first place, on entering this house, one passes\ninto a very bare hall, and thence along a passage to a mean staircase.\nThe reception room, however, is bright, clean, and spacious, and is\nlined with redwood and metal-work. But the scullery you would not care\nto see; it is greasy, dirty, and odoriferous, while the stairs are in\nrags, and the walls so covered with filth that the hand sticks fast\nwherever it touches them. Also, on each landing there is a medley of\nboxes, chairs, and dilapidated wardrobes; while the windows have had\nmost of their panes shattered, and everywhere stand washtubs filled with\ndirt, litter, eggshells, and fish-bladders. The smell is abominable. In\nshort, the house is not a nice one.\n\nAs to the disposition of the rooms, I have described it to you\nalready. True, they are convenient enough, yet every one of them has an\nATMOSPHERE. I do not mean that they smell badly so much as that each of\nthem seems to contain something which gives forth a rank, sickly-sweet\nodour. At first the impression is an unpleasant one, but a couple of\nminutes will suffice to dissipate it, for the reason that EVERYTHING\nhere smells--people's clothes, hands, and everything else--and one grows\naccustomed to the rankness. Canaries, however, soon die in this house. A\nnaval officer here has just bought his fifth. Birds cannot live long\nin such an air. Every morning, when fish or beef is being cooked, and\nwashing and scrubbing are in progress, the house is filled with steam.\nAlways, too, the kitchen is full of linen hanging out to dry; and since\nmy room adjoins that apartment, the smell from the clothes causes me not\na little annoyance. However, one can grow used to anything.\n\nFrom earliest dawn the house is astir as its inmates rise, walk about,\nand stamp their feet. That is to say, everyone who has to go to work\nthen gets out of bed. First of all, tea is partaken of. Most of the\ntea-urns belong to the landlady; and since there are not very many of\nthem, we have to wait our turn. Anyone who fails to do so will find\nhis teapot emptied and put away. On the first occasion, that was what\nhappened to myself. Well, is there anything else to tell you? Already I\nhave made the acquaintance of the company here. The naval officer took\nthe initiative in calling upon me, and his frankness was such that he\ntold me all about his father, his mother, his sister (who is married to\na lawyer of Tula), and the town of Kronstadt. Also, he promised me\nhis patronage, and asked me to come and take tea with him. I kept the\nappointment in a room where card-playing is continually in progress;\nand, after tea had been drunk, efforts were made to induce me to gamble.\nWhether or not my refusal seemed to the company ridiculous I cannot\nsay, but at all events my companions played the whole evening, and were\nplaying when I left. The dust and smoke in the room made my eyes ache.\nI declined, as I say, to play cards, and was, therefore, requested to\ndiscourse on philosophy, after which no one spoke to me at all--a result\nwhich I did not regret. In fact, I have no intention of going there\nagain, since every one is for gambling, and for nothing but gambling.\nEven the literary tchinovnik gives such parties in his room--though, in\nhis case, everything is done delicately and with a certain refinement,\nso that the thing has something of a retiring and innocent air.\n\nIn passing, I may tell you that our landlady is NOT a nice woman. In\nfact, she is a regular beldame. You have seen her once, so what do you\nthink of her? She is as lanky as a plucked chicken in consumption,\nand, with Phaldoni (her servant), constitutes the entire staff of the\nestablishment. Whether or not Phaldoni has any other name I do not know,\nbut at least he answers to this one, and every one calls him by it.\nA red-haired, swine-jowled, snub-nosed, crooked lout, he is for ever\nwrangling with Theresa, until the pair nearly come to blows. In short,\nlife is not overly pleasant in this place. Never at any time is the\nhousehold wholly at rest, for always there are people sitting up to\nplay cards. Sometimes, too, certain things are done of which it would\nbe shameful for me to speak. In particular, hardened though I am, it\nastonishes me that men WITH FAMILIES should care to live in this Sodom.\nFor example, there is a family of poor folk who have rented from the\nlandlady a room which does not adjoin the other rooms, but is set apart\nin a corner by itself. Yet what quiet people they are! Not a sound is\nto be heard from them. The father--he is called Gorshkov--is a little\ngrey-headed tchinovnik who, seven years ago, was dismissed from public\nservice, and now walks about in a coat so dirty and ragged that it hurts\none to see it. Indeed it is a worse coat even than mine! Also, he is\nso thin and frail (at times I meet him in the corridor) that his knees\nquake under him, his hands and head are tremulous with some disease\n(God only knows what!), and he so fears and distrusts everybody that he\nalways walks alone. Reserved though I myself am, he is even worse. As\nfor his family, it consists of a wife and three children. The eldest of\nthe latter--a boy--is as frail as his father, while the mother--a woman\nwho, formerly, must have been good looking, and still has a striking\naspect in spite of her pallor--goes about in the sorriest of rags. Also\nI have heard that they are in debt to our landlady, as well as that she\nis not overly kind to them. Moreover, I have heard that Gorshkov lost\nhis post through some unpleasantness or other--through a legal suit\nor process of which I could not exactly tell you the nature. Yes, they\ncertainly are poor--Oh, my God, how poor! At the same time, never a\nsound comes from their room. It is as though not a soul were living in\nit. Never does one hear even the children--which is an unusual thing,\nseeing that children are ever ready to sport and play, and if they fail\nto do so it is a bad sign. One evening when I chanced to be passing the\ndoor of their room, and all was quiet in the house, I heard through the\ndoor a sob, and then a whisper, and then another sob, as though somebody\nwithin were weeping, and with such subdued bitterness that it tore my\nheart to hear the sound. In fact, the thought of these poor people never\nleft me all night, and quite prevented me from sleeping.\n\nWell, good-bye, my little Barbara, my little friend beyond price. I have\ndescribed to you everything to the best of my ability. All today you\nhave been in my thoughts; all today my heart has been yearning for you.\nI happen to know, dearest one, that you lack a warm cloak. To me too,\nthese St. Petersburg springs, with their winds and their snow showers,\nspell death. Good heavens, how the breezes bite one! Do not be angry,\nbeloved, that I should write like this. Style I have not. Would that\nI had! I write just what wanders into my brain, in the hope that I may\ncheer you up a little. Of course, had I had a good education, things\nmight have been different; but, as things were, I could not have\none. Never did I learn even to do simple sums!--Your faithful and\nunchangeable friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nApril 25th\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Today I met my cousin Sasha. To see her\ngoing to wrack and ruin shocked me terribly. Moreover, it has reached\nme, through a side wind, that she has been making inquiry for me, and\ndogging my footsteps, under the pretext that she wishes to pardon me, to\nforget the past, and to renew our acquaintance. Well, among other things\nshe told me that, whereas you are not a kinsman of mine, that she is my\nnearest relative; that you have no right whatever to enter into family\nrelations with us; and that it is wrong and shameful for me to be\nliving upon your earnings and charity. Also, she said that I must have\nforgotten all that she did for me, though thereby she saved both myself\nand my mother from starvation, and gave us food and drink; that for two\nand a half years we caused her great loss; and, above all things, that\nshe excused us what we owed her. Even my poor mother she did not spare.\nWould that she, my dead parent, could know how I am being treated!\nBut God knows all about it.... Also, Anna declared that it was solely\nthrough my own fault that my fortunes declined after she had bettered\nthem; that she is in no way responsible for what then happened; and that\nI have but myself to blame for having been either unable or unwilling to\ndefend my honour. Great God! WHO, then, has been at fault? According to\nAnna, Hospodin [Mr.] Bwikov was only right when he declined to marry\na woman who--But need I say it? It is cruel to hear such lies as hers.\nWhat is to become of me I do not know. I tremble and sob and weep.\nIndeed, even to write this letter has cost me two hours. At least it\nmight have been thought that Anna would have confessed HER share in the\npast. Yet see what she says!... For the love of God do not be anxious\nabout me, my friend, my only benefactor. Thedora is over apt to\nexaggerate matters. I am not REALLY ill. I have merely caught a little\ncold. I caught it last night while I was walking to Bolkovo, to hear\nMass sung for my mother. Ah, mother, my poor mother! Could you but rise\nfrom the grave and learn what is being done to your daughter!\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nMay 20th\n\nMY DEAREST LITTLE BARBARA,--I am sending you a few grapes, which are\ngood for a convalescent person, and strongly recommended by doctors for\nthe allayment of fever. Also, you were saying the other day that you\nwould like some roses; wherefore, I now send you a bunch. Are you at all\nable to eat, my darling?--for that is the chief point which ought to\nbe seen to. Let us thank God that the past and all its unhappiness are\ngone! Yes, let us give thanks to Heaven for that much! As for books, I\ncannot get hold of any, except for a book which, written in excellent\nstyle, is, I believe, to be had here. At all events, people keep\npraising it very much, and I have begged the loan of it for myself.\nShould you too like to read it? In this respect, indeed, I feel nervous,\nfor the reason that it is so difficult to divine what your taste in\nbooks may be, despite my knowledge of your character. Probably you would\nlike poetry--the poetry of sentiment and of love making? Well, I will\nsend you a book of MY OWN poems. Already I have copied out part of the\nmanuscript.\n\nEverything with me is going well; so pray do not be anxious on my\naccount, beloved. What Thedora told you about me was sheer rubbish. Tell\nher from me that she has not been speaking the truth. Yes, do not fail\nto give this mischief-maker my message. It is not the case that I have\ngone and sold a new uniform. Why should I do so, seeing that I have\nforty roubles of salary still to come to me? Do not be uneasy, my\ndarling. Thedora is a vindictive woman--merely a vindictive woman. We\nshall yet see better days. Only do you get well, my angel--only do you\nget well, for the love of God, lest you grieve an old man. Also, who\ntold you that I was looking thin? Slanders again--nothing but slanders!\nI am as healthy as could be, and have grown so fat that I am ashamed\nto be so sleek of paunch. Would that you were equally healthy!... Now\ngoodbye, my angel. I kiss every one of your tiny fingers, and remain\never your constant friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\nP.S.--But what is this, dearest one, that you have written to me? Why do\nyou place me upon such a pedestal? Moreover, how could I come and visit\nyou frequently? How, I repeat? Of course, I might avail myself of the\ncover of night; but, alas! the season of the year is what it is, and\nincludes no night time to speak of. In fact, although, throughout your\nillness and delirium, I scarcely left your side for a moment, I cannot\nthink how I contrived to do the many things that I did. Later, I ceased\nto visit you at all, for the reason that people were beginning to notice\nthings, and to ask me questions. Yet, even so, a scandal has arisen.\nTheresa I trust thoroughly, for she is not a talkative woman; but\nconsider how it will be when the truth comes out in its entirety! What\nTHEN will folk not say and think? Nevertheless, be of good cheer, my\nbeloved, and regain your health. When you have done so we will contrive\nto arrange a rendezvous out of doors.\n\n\n\n\nJune 1st\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--So eager am I to do something that\nwill please and divert you in return for your care, for your ceaseless\nefforts on my behalf--in short, for your love for me--that I have\ndecided to beguile a leisure hour for you by delving into my locker, and\nextracting thence the manuscript which I send you herewith. I began it\nduring the happier period of my life, and have continued it at intervals\nsince. So often have you asked me about my former existence--about my\nmother, about Pokrovski, about my sojourn with Anna Thedorovna, about my\nmore recent misfortunes; so often have you expressed an earnest desire\nto read the manuscript in which (God knows why) I have recorded certain\nincidents of my life, that I feel no doubt but that the sending of it\nwill give you sincere pleasure. Yet somehow I feel depressed when I read\nit, for I seem now to have grown twice as old as I was when I penned\nits concluding lines. Ah, Makar Alexievitch, how weary I am--how this\ninsomnia tortures me! Convalescence is indeed a hard thing to bear!\n\nB. D.\n\nONE\n\nUP to the age of fourteen, when my father died, my childhood was the\nhappiest period of my life. It began very far away from here in the\ndepths of the province of Tula, where my father filled the position of\nsteward on the vast estates of the Prince P----. Our house was situated in\none of the Prince's villages, and we lived a quiet, obscure, but happy,\nlife. A gay little child was I--my one idea being ceaselessly to run\nabout the fields and the woods and the garden. No one ever gave me a\nthought, for my father was always occupied with business affairs, and\nmy mother with her housekeeping. Nor did any one ever give me any\nlessons--a circumstance for which I was not sorry. At earliest dawn I\nwould hie me to a pond or a copse, or to a hay or a harvest field, where\nthe sun could warm me, and I could roam wherever I liked, and scratch my\nhands with bushes, and tear my clothes in pieces. For this I used to get\nblamed afterwards, but I did not care.\n\nHad it befallen me never to quit that village--had it befallen me to\nremain for ever in that spot--I should always have been happy; but fate\nordained that I should leave my birthplace even before my girlhood had\ncome to an end. In short, I was only twelve years old when we removed\nto St. Petersburg. Ah! how it hurts me to recall the mournful gatherings\nbefore our departure, and to recall how bitterly I wept when the time\ncame for us to say farewell to all that I had held so dear! I remember\nthrowing myself upon my father's neck, and beseeching him with tears\nto stay in the country a little longer; but he bid me be silent, and\nmy mother, adding her tears to mine, explained that business matters\ncompelled us to go. As a matter of fact, old Prince P---- had just died,\nand his heirs had dismissed my father from his post; whereupon, since\nhe had a little money privately invested in St. Petersburg, he bethought\nhim that his personal presence in the capital was necessary for the\ndue management of his affairs. It was my mother who told me this.\nConsequently we settled here in St. Petersburg, and did not again move\nuntil my father died.\n\nHow difficult I found it to grow accustomed to my new life! At the time\nof our removal to St. Petersburg it was autumn--a season when, in the\ncountry, the weather is clear and keen and bright, all agricultural\nlabour has come to an end, the great sheaves of corn are safely garnered\nin the byre, and the birds are flying hither and thither in clamorous\nflocks. Yes, at that season the country is joyous and fair, but here\nin St. Petersburg, at the time when we reached the city, we encountered\nnothing but rain, bitter autumn frosts, dull skies, ugliness, and crowds\nof strangers who looked hostile, discontented, and disposed to take\noffence. However, we managed to settle down--though I remember that\nin our new home there was much noise and confusion as we set the\nestablishment in order. After this my father was seldom at home, and my\nmother had few spare moments; wherefore, I found myself forgotten.\n\nThe first morning after our arrival, when I awoke from sleep, how sad I\nfelt! I could see that our windows looked out upon a drab space of wall,\nand that the street below was littered with filth. Passers-by were few,\nand as they walked they kept muffling themselves up against the cold.\n\nThen there ensued days when dullness and depression reigned supreme.\nScarcely a relative or an acquaintance did we possess in St. Petersburg,\nand even Anna Thedorovna and my father had come to loggerheads with one\nanother, owing to the fact that he owed her money. In fact, our only\nvisitors were business callers, and as a rule these came but to wrangle,\nto argue, and to raise a disturbance. Such visits would make my father\nlook very discontented, and seem out of temper. For hours and hours he\nwould pace the room with a frown on his face and a brooding silence on\nhis lips. Even my mother did not dare address him at these times,\nwhile, for my own part, I used to sit reading quietly and humbly in a\ncorner--not venturing to make a movement of any sort.\n\nThree months after our arrival in St. Petersburg I was sent to a\nboarding-school. Here I found myself thrown among strange people; here\neverything was grim and uninviting, with teachers continually shouting\nat me, and my fellow-pupils for ever holding me up to derision, and\nmyself constantly feeling awkward and uncouth. How strict, how exacting\nwas the system! Appointed hours for everything, a common table,\never-insistent teachers! These things simply worried and tortured me.\nNever from the first could I sleep, but used to weep many a chill, weary\nnight away. In the evenings everyone would have to repeat or to learn\nher lessons. As I crouched over a dialogue or a vocabulary, without\ndaring even to stir, how my thoughts would turn to the chimney-corner\nat home, to my father, to my mother, to my old nurse, to the tales which\nthe latter had been used to tell! How sad it all was! The memory of the\nmerest trifle at home would please me, and I would think and think how\nnice things used to be at home. Once more I would be sitting in our\nlittle parlour at tea with my parents--in the familiar little parlour\nwhere everything was snug and warm! How ardently, how convulsively I\nwould seem to be embracing my mother! Thus I would ponder, until at\nlength tears of sorrow would softly gush forth and choke my bosom, and\ndrive the lessons out of my head. For I never could master the tasks of\nthe morrow; no matter how much my mistress and fellow-pupils might gird\nat me, no matter how much I might repeat my lessons over and over to\nmyself, knowledge never came with the morning. Consequently, I used to\nbe ordered the kneeling punishment, and given only one meal in the day.\nHow dull and dispirited I used to feel! From the first my fellow-pupils\nused to tease and deride and mock me whenever I was saying my lessons.\nAlso, they used to pinch me as we were on our way to dinner or tea, and\nto make groundless complaints of me to the head mistress. On the other\nhand, how heavenly it seemed when, on Saturday evening, my old nurse\narrived to fetch me! How I would embrace the old woman in transports\nof joy! After dressing me, and wrapping me up, she would find that\nshe could scarcely keep pace with me on the way home, so full was I of\nchatter and tales about one thing and another. Then, when I had arrived\nhome merry and lighthearted, how fervently I would embrace my parents,\nas though I had not seen them for ten years. Such a fussing would there\nbe--such a talking and a telling of tales! To everyone I would run with\na greeting, and laugh, and giggle, and scamper about, and skip for\nvery joy. True, my father and I used to have grave conversations about\nlessons and teachers and the French language and grammar; yet we were\nall very happy and contented together. Even now it thrills me to think\nof those moments. For my father's sake I tried hard to learn my lessons,\nfor I could see that he was spending his last kopeck upon me, and\nhimself subsisting God knows how. Every day he grew more morose and\ndiscontented and irritable; every day his character kept changing for\nthe worse. He had suffered an influx of debts, nor were his business\naffairs prospering. As for my mother, she was afraid even to say a word,\nor to weep aloud, for fear of still further angering him. Gradually\nshe sickened, grew thinner and thinner, and became taken with a painful\ncough. Whenever I reached home from school I would find every one\nlow-spirited, and my mother shedding silent tears, and my father raging.\nBickering and high words would arise, during which my father was wont\nto declare that, though he no longer derived the smallest pleasure or\nrelaxation from life, and had spent his last coin upon my education, I\nhad not yet mastered the French language. In short, everything began to\ngo wrong, to turn to unhappiness; and for that circumstance, my father\ntook vengeance upon myself and my mother. How he could treat my poor\nmother so I cannot understand. It used to rend my heart to see her, so\nhollow were her cheeks becoming, so sunken her eyes, so hectic her\nface. But it was chiefly around myself that the disputes raged. Though\nbeginning only with some trifle, they would soon go on to God knows\nwhat. Frequently, even I myself did not know to what they related.\nAnything and everything would enter into them, for my father would say\nthat I was an utter dunce at the French language; that the head mistress\nof my school was a stupid, common sort of women who cared nothing for\nmorals; that he (my father) had not yet succeeded in obtaining another\npost; that Lamonde's \"Grammar\" was a wretched book--even a worse one\nthan Zapolski's; that a great deal of money had been squandered upon me;\nthat it was clear that I was wasting my time in repeating dialogues\nand vocabularies; that I alone was at fault, and that I must answer for\neverything. Yet this did not arise from any WANT OF LOVE for me on the\npart of my father, but rather from the fact that he was incapable of\nputting himself in my own and my mother's place. It came of a defect of\ncharacter.\n\nAll these cares and worries and disappointments tortured my poor father\nuntil he became moody and distrustful. Next he began to neglect his\nhealth, with the result that, catching a chill, he died, after a short\nillness, so suddenly and unexpectedly that for a few days we were almost\nbeside ourselves with the shock--my mother, in particular, lying for\na while in such a state of torpor that I had fears for her reason. The\ninstant my father was dead creditors seemed to spring up out of the\nground, and to assail us en masse. Everything that we possessed had to\nbe surrendered to them, including a little house which my father had\nbought six months after our arrival in St. Petersburg. How matters\nwere finally settled I do not know, but we found ourselves roofless,\nshelterless, and without a copper. My mother was grievously ill, and\nof means of subsistence we had none. Before us there loomed only ruin,\nsheer ruin. At the time I was fourteen years old. Soon afterwards Anna\nThedorovna came to see us, saying that she was a lady of property and\nour relative; and this my mother confirmed--though, true, she added that\nAnna was only a very DISTANT relative. Anna had never taken the least\nnotice of us during my father's lifetime, yet now she entered our\npresence with tears in her eyes, and an assurance that she meant to\nbetter our fortunes. Having condoled with us on our loss and destitute\nposition, she added that my father had been to blame for everything, in\nthat he had lived beyond his means, and taken upon himself more than he\nwas able to perform. Also, she expressed a wish to draw closer to us,\nand to forget old scores; and when my mother explained that, for her own\npart, she harboured no resentment against Anna, the latter burst into\ntears, and, hurrying my mother away to church, then and there ordered\nMass to be said for the \"dear departed,\" as she called my father. In\nthis manner she effected a solemn reconciliation with my mother.\n\nNext, after long negotiations and vacillations, coupled with much\nvivid description of our destitute position, our desolation, and our\nhelplessness, Anna invited us to pay her (as she expressed it) a\n\"return visit.\" For this my mother duly thanked her, and considered the\ninvitation for a while; after which, seeing that there was nothing\nelse to be done, she informed Anna Thedorovna that she was prepared,\ngratefully, to accept her offer. Ah, how I remember the morning when we\nremoved to Vassilievski Island! [A quarter of St. Petersburg.] It was a\nclear, dry, frosty morning in autumn. My mother could not restrain\nher tears, and I too felt depressed. Nay, my very heart seemed to be\nbreaking under a strange, undefined load of sorrow. How terrible it all\nseemed!...\n\nII\n\nAT first--that is to say, until my mother and myself grew used to\nour new abode--we found living at Anna Thedorovna's both strange and\ndisagreeable. The house was her own, and contained five rooms, three of\nwhich she shared with my orphaned cousin, Sasha (whom she had brought up\nfrom babyhood); a fourth was occupied by my mother and myself; and the\nfifth was rented of Anna by a poor student named Pokrovski. Although\nAnna lived in good style--in far better style than might have been\nexpected--her means and her avocation were conjectural. Never was she\nat rest; never was she not busy with some mysterious something or other.\nAlso, she possessed a wide and varied circle of friends. The stream of\ncallers was perpetual--although God only knows who they were, or what\ntheir business was. No sooner did my mother hear the door-bell ring than\noff she would carry me to our own apartment. This greatly displeased\nAnna, who used again and again to assure my mother that we were too\nproud for our station in life. In fact, she would sulk for hours about\nit. At the time I could not understand these reproaches, and it was\nnot until long afterwards that I learned--or rather, I guessed--why\neventually my mother declared that she could not go on living with Anna.\nYes, Anna was a bad woman. Never did she let us alone. As to the exact\nmotive why she had asked us to come and share her house with her I am\nstill in the dark. At first she was not altogether unkind to us but,\nlater, she revealed to us her real character--as soon, that is to say,\nas she saw that we were at her mercy, and had nowhere else to go.\nYes, in early days she was quite kind to me--even offensively so, but\nafterwards, I had to suffer as much as my mother. Constantly did Anna\nreproach us; constantly did she remind us of her benefactions, and\nintroduce us to her friends as poor relatives of hers whom, out of\ngoodness of heart and for the love of Christ, she had received into her\nbosom. At table, also, she would watch every mouthful that we took;\nand, if our appetite failed, immediately she would begin as before, and\nreiterate that we were over-dainty, that we must not assume that riches\nwould mean happiness, and that we had better go and live by ourselves.\nMoreover, she never ceased to inveigh against my father--saying that\nhe had sought to be better than other people, and thereby had brought\nhimself to a bad end; that he had left his wife and daughter destitute;\nand that, but for the fact that we had happened to meet with a kind and\nsympathetic Christian soul, God alone knew where we should have laid our\nheads, save in the street. What did that woman not say? To hear her was\nnot so much galling as disgusting. From time to time my mother would\nburst into tears, her health grew worse from day to day, and her body\nwas becoming sheer skin and bone. All the while, too, we had to work--to\nwork from morning till night, for we had contrived to obtain some\nemployment as occasional sempstresses. This, however, did not please\nAnna, who used to tell us that there was no room in her house for a\nmodiste's establishment. Yet we had to get clothes to wear, to provide\nfor unforeseen expenses, and to have a little money at our disposal in\ncase we should some day wish to remove elsewhere. Unfortunately, the\nstrain undermined my mother's health, and she became gradually weaker.\nSickness, like a cankerworm, was gnawing at her life, and dragging her\ntowards the tomb. Well could I see what she was enduring, what she was\nsuffering. Yes, it all lay open to my eyes.\n\nDay succeeded day, and each day was like the last one. We lived a life\nas quiet as though we had been in the country. Anna herself grew quieter\nin proportion as she came to realise the extent of her power over us.\nIn nothing did we dare to thwart her. From her portion of the house\nour apartment was divided by a corridor, while next to us (as mentioned\nabove) dwelt a certain Pokrovski, who was engaged in teaching Sasha the\nFrench and German languages, as well as history and geography--\"all the\nsciences,\" as Anna used to say. In return for these services he received\nfree board and lodging. As for Sasha, she was a clever, but rude and\nuncouth, girl of thirteen. On one occasion Anna remarked to my mother\nthat it might be as well if I also were to take some lessons, seeing\nthat my education had been neglected at school; and, my mother joyfully\nassenting, I joined Sasha for a year in studying under this Pokrovski.\n\nThe latter was a poor--a very poor--young man whose health would not\npermit of his undertaking the regular university course. Indeed, it was\nonly for form's sake that we called him \"The Student.\" He lived in such\na quiet, humble, retiring fashion that never a sound reached us from his\nroom. Also, his exterior was peculiar--he moved and walked awkwardly,\nand uttered his words in such a strange manner that at first I could\nnever look at him without laughing. Sasha was for ever playing tricks\nupon him--more especially when he was giving us our lessons. But\nunfortunately, he was of a temperament as excitable as herself. Indeed,\nhe was so irritable that the least trifle would send him into a frenzy,\nand set him shouting at us, and complaining of our conduct. Sometimes he\nwould even rush away to his room before school hours were over, and sit\nthere for days over his books, of which he had a store that was\nboth rare and valuable. In addition, he acted as teacher at another\nestablishment, and received payment for his services there; and,\nwhenever he had received his fees for this extra work, he would hasten\noff and purchase more books.\n\nIn time I got to know and like him better, for in reality he was a good,\nworthy fellow--more so than any of the people with whom we otherwise\ncame in contact. My mother in particular had a great respect for him,\nand, after herself, he was my best friend. But at first I was just an\novergrown hoyden, and joined Sasha in playing the fool. For hours we\nwould devise tricks to anger and distract him, for he looked extremely\nridiculous when he was angry, and so diverted us the more (ashamed\nthough I am now to admit it). But once, when we had driven him nearly\nto tears, I heard him say to himself under his breath, \"What cruel\nchildren!\" and instantly I repented--I began to feel sad and ashamed and\nsorry for him. I reddened to my ears, and begged him, almost with tears,\nnot to mind us, nor to take offence at our stupid jests. Nevertheless,\nwithout finishing the lesson, he closed his book, and departed to his\nown room. All that day I felt torn with remorse. To think that we two\nchildren had forced him, the poor, the unhappy one, to remember his hard\nlot! And at night I could not sleep for grief and regret. Remorse is\nsaid to bring relief to the soul, but it is not so. How far my grief was\ninternally connected with my conceit I do not know, but at least I did\nnot wish him to think me a baby, seeing that I had now reached the age\nof fifteen years. Therefore, from that day onwards I began to torture\nmy imagination with devising a thousand schemes which should compel\nPokrovski to alter his opinion of me. At the same time, being yet shy\nand reserved by nature, I ended by finding that, in my present position,\nI could make up my mind to nothing but vague dreams (and such dreams\nI had). However, I ceased to join Sasha in playing the fool, while\nPokrovski, for his part, ceased to lose his temper with us so much.\nUnfortunately this was not enough to satisfy my self-esteem.\n\nAt this point, I must say a few words about the strangest, the most\ninteresting, the most pitiable human being that I have ever come across.\nI speak of him now--at this particular point in these memoirs--for the\nreason that hitherto I had paid him no attention whatever, and began to\ndo so now only because everything connected with Pokrovski had suddenly\nbecome of absorbing interest in my eyes.\n\nSometimes there came to the house a ragged, poorly-dressed, grey-headed,\nawkward, amorphous--in short, a very strange-looking--little old man. At\nfirst glance it might have been thought that he was perpetually ashamed\nof something--that he had on his conscience something which always made\nhim, as it were, bristle up and then shrink into himself. Such curious\nstarts and grimaces did he indulge in that one was forced to conclude\nthat he was scarcely in his right mind. On arriving, he would halt for\na while by the window in the hall, as though afraid to enter; until,\nshould any one happen to pass in or out of the door--whether Sasha or\nmyself or one of the servants (to the latter he always resorted the most\nreadily, as being the most nearly akin to his own class)--he would begin\nto gesticulate and to beckon to that person, and to make various signs.\nThen, should the person in question nod to him, or call him by name (the\nrecognised token that no other visitor was present, and that he\nmight enter freely), he would open the door gently, give a smile of\nsatisfaction as he rubbed his hands together, and proceed on tiptoe to\nyoung Pokrovski's room. This old fellow was none other than Pokrovski's\nfather.\n\nLater I came to know his story in detail. Formerly a civil servant, he\nhad possessed no additional means, and so had occupied a very low\nand insignificant position in the service. Then, after his first wife\n(mother of the younger Pokrovski) had died, the widower bethought him of\nmarrying a second time, and took to himself a tradesman's daughter, who\nsoon assumed the reins over everything, and brought the home to rack and\nruin, so that the old man was worse off than before. But to the younger\nPokrovski, fate proved kinder, for a landowner named Bwikov, who had\nformerly known the lad's father and been his benefactor, took the boy\nunder his protection, and sent him to school. Another reason why this\nBwikov took an interest in young Pokrovski was that he had known the\nlad's dead mother, who, while still a serving-maid, had been befriended\nby Anna Thedorovna, and subsequently married to the elder Pokrovski. At\nthe wedding Bwikov, actuated by his friendship for Anna, conferred upon\nthe young bride a dowry of five thousand roubles; but whither that money\nhad since disappeared I cannot say. It was from Anna's lips that I heard\nthe story, for the student Pokrovski was never prone to talk about his\nfamily affairs. His mother was said to have been very good-looking;\nwherefore, it is the more mysterious why she should have made so poor a\nmatch. She died when young--only four years after her espousal.\n\nFrom school the young Pokrovski advanced to a gymnasium, [Secondary\nschool.] and thence to the University, where Bwikov, who frequently\nvisited the capital, continued to accord the youth his protection.\nGradually, however, ill health put an end to the young man's university\ncourse; whereupon Bwikov introduced and personally recommended him to\nAnna Thedorovna, and he came to lodge with her on condition that he\ntaught Sasha whatever might be required of him.\n\nGrief at the harshness of his wife led the elder Pokrovski to plunge\ninto dissipation, and to remain in an almost permanent condition of\ndrunkenness. Constantly his wife beat him, or sent him to sit in the\nkitchen--with the result that in time, he became so inured to blows\nand neglect, that he ceased to complain. Still not greatly advanced\nin years, he had nevertheless endangered his reason through evil\ncourses--his only sign of decent human feeling being his love for his\nson. The latter was said to resemble his dead mother as one pea may\nresemble another. What recollections, therefore, of the kind helpmeet of\nformer days may not have moved the breast of the poor broken old man to\nthis boundless affection for the boy? Of naught else could the father\never speak but of his son, and never did he fail to visit him twice a\nweek. To come oftener he did not dare, for the reason that the younger\nPokrovski did not like these visits of his father's. In fact, there\ncan be no doubt that the youth's greatest fault was his lack of filial\nrespect. Yet the father was certainly rather a difficult person to deal\nwith, for, in the first place, he was extremely inquisitive, while, in\nthe second place, his long-winded conversation and questions--questions\nof the most vapid and senseless order conceivable--always prevented\nthe son from working. Likewise, the old man occasionally arrived there\ndrunk. Gradually, however, the son was weaning his parent from his\nvicious ways and everlasting inquisitiveness, and teaching the old man\nto look upon him, his son, as an oracle, and never to speak without that\nson's permission.\n\nOn the subject of his Petinka, as he called him, the poor old man could\nnever sufficiently rhapsodise and dilate. Yet when he arrived to see his\nson he almost invariably had on his face a downcast, timid expression\nthat was probably due to uncertainty concerning the way in which he\nwould be received. For a long time he would hesitate to enter, and if I\nhappened to be there he would question me for twenty minutes or so as to\nwhether his Petinka was in good health, as well as to the sort of\nmood he was in, whether he was engaged on matters of importance, what\nprecisely he was doing (writing or meditating), and so on. Then, when I\nhad sufficiently encouraged and reassured the old man, he would make up\nhis mind to enter, and quietly and cautiously open the door. Next, he\nwould protrude his head through the chink, and if he saw that his son\nwas not angry, but threw him a nod, he would glide noiselessly into the\nroom, take off his scarf, and hang up his hat (the latter perennially\nin a bad state of repair, full of holes, and with a smashed brim)--the\nwhole being done without a word or a sound of any kind. Next, the old\nman would seat himself warily on a chair, and, never removing his eyes\nfrom his son, follow his every movement, as though seeking to gauge\nPetinka's state of mind. On the other hand, if the son was not in good\nspirits, the father would make a note of the fact, and at once get up,\nsaying that he had \"only called for a minute or two,\" that, \"having been\nout for a long walk, and happening at the moment to be passing,\" he had\n\"looked in for a moment's rest.\" Then silently and humbly the old man\nwould resume his hat and scarf; softly he would open the door, and\nnoiselessly depart with a forced smile on his face--the better to bear\nthe disappointment which was seething in his breast, the better to help\nhim not to show it to his son.\n\nOn the other hand, whenever the son received his father civilly the old\nman would be struck dumb with joy. Satisfaction would beam in his face,\nin his every gesture, in his every movement. And if the son deigned to\nengage in conversation with him, the old man always rose a little from\nhis chair, and answered softly, sympathetically, with something like\nreverence, while strenuously endeavouring to make use of the most\nrecherche (that is to say, the most ridiculous) expressions. But, alas!\nHe had not the gift of words. Always he grew confused, and turned red in\nthe face; never did he know what to do with his hands or with himself.\nLikewise, whenever he had returned an answer of any kind, he would go\non repeating the same in a whisper, as though he were seeking to justify\nwhat he had just said. And if he happened to have returned a good\nanswer, he would begin to preen himself, and to straighten his\nwaistcoat, frockcoat and tie, and to assume an air of conscious dignity.\nIndeed, on these occasions he would feel so encouraged, he would carry\nhis daring to such a pitch, that, rising softly from his chair, he would\napproach the bookshelves, take thence a book, and read over to himself\nsome passage or another. All this he would do with an air of feigned\nindifference and sangfroid, as though he were free ALWAYS to use his\nson's books, and his son's kindness were no rarity at all. Yet on one\noccasion I saw the poor old fellow actually turn pale on being told by\nhis son not to touch the books. Abashed and confused, he, in his awkward\nhurry, replaced the volume wrong side uppermost; whereupon, with a\nsupreme effort to recover himself, he turned it round with a smile and\na blush, as though he were at a loss how to view his own misdemeanour.\nGradually, as already said, the younger Pokrovski weaned his father\nfrom his dissipated ways by giving him a small coin whenever, on three\nsuccessive occasions, he (the father) arrived sober. Sometimes, also,\nthe younger man would buy the older one shoes, or a tie, or a waistcoat;\nwhereafter, the old man would be as proud of his acquisition as a\npeacock. Not infrequently, also, the old man would step in to visit\nourselves, and bring Sasha and myself gingerbread birds or apples,\nwhile talking unceasingly of Petinka. Always he would beg of us to pay\nattention to our lessons, on the plea that Petinka was a good son, an\nexemplary son, a son who was in twofold measure a man of learning; after\nwhich he would wink at us so quizzingly with his left eye, and twist\nhimself about in such amusing fashion, that we were forced to burst out\nlaughing. My mother had a great liking for him, but he detested Anna\nThedorovna--although in her presence he would be quieter than water and\nlowlier than the earth.\n\nSoon after this I ceased to take lessons of Pokrovski. Even now he\nthought me a child, a raw schoolgirl, as much as he did Sasha; and this\nhurt me extremely, seeing that I had done so much to expiate my former\nbehaviour. Of my efforts in this direction no notice had been taken,\nand the fact continued to anger me more and more. Scarcely ever did I\naddress a word to my tutor between school hours, for I simply could\nnot bring myself to do it. If I made the attempt I only grew red and\nconfused, and rushed away to weep in a corner. How it would all have\nended I do not know, had not a curious incident helped to bring about\na rapprochement. One evening, when my mother was sitting in Anna\nThedorovna's room, I crept on tiptoe to Pokrovski's apartment, in the\nbelief that he was not at home. Some strange impulse moved me to do so.\nTrue, we had lived cheek by jowl with one another; yet never once had\nI caught a glimpse of his abode. Consequently my heart beat loudly--so\nloudly, indeed, that it seemed almost to be bursting from my breast. On\nentering the room I glanced around me with tense interest. The apartment\nwas very poorly furnished, and bore few traces of orderliness. On table\nand chairs there lay heaps of books; everywhere were books and papers.\nThen a strange thought entered my head, as well as, with the thought, an\nunpleasant feeling of irritation. It seemed to me that my friendship,\nmy heart's affection, meant little to him, for HE was well-educated,\nwhereas I was stupid, and had learned nothing, and had read not a single\nbook. So I stood looking wistfully at the long bookshelves where\nthey groaned under their weight of volumes. I felt filled with grief,\ndisappointment, and a sort of frenzy. I felt that I MUST read those\nbooks, and decided to do so--to read them one by one, and with all\npossible speed. Probably the idea was that, by learning whatsoever HE\nknew, I should render myself more worthy of his friendship. So, I made\na rush towards the bookcase nearest me, and, without stopping further\nto consider matters, seized hold of the first dusty tome upon which my\nhands chanced to alight, and, reddening and growing pale by turns, and\ntrembling with fear and excitement, clasped the stolen book to my breast\nwith the intention of reading it by candle light while my mother lay\nasleep at night.\n\nBut how vexed I felt when, on returning to our own room, and hastily\nturning the pages, only an old, battered worm-eaten Latin work greeted\nmy eyes! Without loss of time I retraced my steps. Just when I was about\nto replace the book I heard a noise in the corridor outside, and the\nsound of footsteps approaching. Fumblingly I hastened to complete what\nI was about, but the tiresome book had become so tightly wedged into\nits row that, on being pulled out, it caused its fellows to close up too\ncompactly to leave any place for their comrade. To insert the book was\nbeyond my strength; yet still I kept pushing and pushing at the row. At\nlast the rusty nail which supported the shelf (the thing seemed to have\nbeen waiting on purpose for that moment!) broke off short; with the\nresult that the shelf descended with a crash, and the books piled\nthemselves in a heap on the floor! Then the door of the room opened, and\nPokrovski entered!\n\nI must here remark that he never could bear to have his possessions\ntampered with. Woe to the person, in particular, who touched his books!\nJudge, therefore, of my horror when books small and great, books of\nevery possible shape and size and thickness, came tumbling from the\nshelf, and flew and sprang over the table, and under the chairs, and\nabout the whole room. I would have turned and fled, but it was too late.\n\"All is over!\" thought I. \"All is over! I am ruined, I am undone! Here\nhave I been playing the fool like a ten-year-old child! What a stupid\ngirl I am! The monstrous fool!\"\n\nIndeed, Pokrovski was very angry. \"What? Have you not done enough?\" he\ncried. \"Are you not ashamed to be for ever indulging in such pranks? Are\nyou NEVER going to grow sensible?\" With that he darted forward to pick\nup the books, while I bent down to help him.\n\n\"You need not, you need not!\" he went on. \"You would have done far\nbetter not to have entered without an invitation.\"\n\nNext, a little mollified by my humble demeanour, he resumed in his usual\ntutorial tone--the tone which he had adopted in his new-found role of\npreceptor:\n\n\"When are you going to grow steadier and more thoughtful? Consider\nyourself for a moment. You are no longer a child, a little girl, but a\nmaiden of fifteen.\"\n\nThen, with a desire (probably) to satisfy himself that I was no longer a\nbeing of tender years, he threw me a glance--but straightway reddened to\nhis very ears. This I could not understand, but stood gazing at him in\nastonishment. Presently, he straightened himself a little, approached\nme with a sort of confused expression, and haltingly said\nsomething--probably it was an apology for not having before perceived\nthat I was now a grown-up young person. But the next moment I\nunderstood. What I did I hardly know, save that, in my dismay and\nconfusion, I blushed even more hotly than he had done and, covering my\nface with my hands, rushed from the room.\n\nWhat to do with myself for shame I could not think. The one thought in\nmy head was that he had surprised me in his room. For three whole days\nI found myself unable to raise my eyes to his, but blushed always to\nthe point of weeping. The strangest and most confused of thoughts kept\nentering my brain. One of them--the most extravagant--was that I should\ndearly like to go to Pokrovski, and to explain to him the situation, and\nto make full confession, and to tell him everything without concealment,\nand to assure him that I had not acted foolishly as a minx, but honestly\nand of set purpose. In fact, I DID make up my mind to take this course,\nbut lacked the necessary courage to do it. If I had done so, what a\nfigure I should have cut! Even now I am ashamed to think of it.\n\nA few days later, my mother suddenly fell dangerously ill. For two\ndays past she had not left her bed, while during the third night of her\nillness she became seized with fever and delirium. I also had not closed\nmy eyes during the previous night, but now waited upon my mother, sat by\nher bed, brought her drink at intervals, and gave her medicine at duly\nappointed hours. The next night I suffered terribly. Every now and then\nsleep would cause me to nod, and objects grow dim before my eyes. Also,\nmy head was turning dizzy, and I could have fainted for very weariness.\nYet always my mother's feeble moans recalled me to myself as I started,\nmomentarily awoke, and then again felt drowsiness overcoming me. What\ntorture it was! I do not know, I cannot clearly remember, but I think\nthat, during a moment when wakefulness was thus contending with slumber,\na strange dream, a horrible vision, visited my overwrought brain, and\nI awoke in terror. The room was nearly in darkness, for the candle was\nflickering, and throwing stray beams of light which suddenly illuminated\nthe room, danced for a moment on the walls, and then disappeared.\nSomehow I felt afraid--a sort of horror had come upon me--my imagination\nhad been over-excited by the evil dream which I had experienced, and a\nfeeling of oppression was crushing my heart.... I leapt from the chair,\nand involuntarily uttered a cry--a cry wrung from me by the terrible,\ntorturing sensation that was upon me. Presently the door opened, and\nPokrovski entered.\n\nI remember that I was in his arms when I recovered my senses. Carefully\nseating me on a bench, he handed me a glass of water, and then asked me\na few questions--though how I answered them I do not know. \"You yourself\nare ill,\" he said as he took my hand. \"You yourself are VERY ill. You\nare feverish, and I can see that you are knocking yourself out through\nyour neglect of your own health. Take a little rest. Lie down and go to\nsleep. Yes, lie down, lie down,\" he continued without giving me time to\nprotest. Indeed, fatigue had so exhausted my strength that my eyes\nwere closing from very weakness. So I lay down on the bench with the\nintention of sleeping for half an hour only; but, I slept till morning.\nPokrovski then awoke me, saying that it was time for me to go and give\nmy mother her medicine.\n\nWhen the next evening, about eight o'clock, I had rested a little and\nwas preparing to spend the night in a chair beside my mother (fixedly\nmeaning not to go to sleep this time), Pokrovski suddenly knocked at\nthe door. I opened it, and he informed me that, since, possibly, I\nmight find the time wearisome, he had brought me a few books to read. I\naccepted the books, but do not, even now, know what books they were, nor\nwhether I looked into them, despite the fact that I never closed my eyes\nthe whole night long. The truth was that a strange feeling of excitement\nwas preventing me from sleeping, and I could not rest long in any one\nspot, but had to keep rising from my chair, and walking about the\nroom. Throughout my whole being there seemed to be diffused a kind of\nelation--of elation at Pokrovski's attentions, at the thought that he\nwas anxious and uneasy about me. Until dawn I pondered and dreamed; and\nthough I felt sure Pokrovski would not again visit us that night, I gave\nmyself up to fancies concerning what he might do the following evening.\n\nThat evening, when everyone else in the house had retired to rest,\nPokrovski opened his door, and opened a conversation from the threshold\nof his room. Although, at this distance of time, I cannot remember a\nword of what we said to one another, I remember that I blushed, grew\nconfused, felt vexed with myself, and awaited with impatience the end of\nthe conversation although I myself had been longing for the meeting\nto take place, and had spent the day in dreaming of it, and devising\na string of suitable questions and replies. Yes, that evening saw the\nfirst strand in our friendship knitted; and each subsequent night of\nmy mother's illness we spent several hours together. Little by little I\novercame his reserve, but found that each of these conversations left me\nfilled with a sense of vexation at myself. At the same time, I could see\nwith secret joy and a sense of proud elation that I was leading him to\nforget his tiresome books. At last the conversation turned jestingly\nupon the upsetting of the shelf. The moment was a peculiar one, for it\ncame upon me just when I was in the right mood for self-revelation and\ncandour. In my ardour, my curious phase of exaltation, I found myself\nled to make a full confession of the fact that I had become wishful to\nlearn, to KNOW, something, since I had felt hurt at being taken for a\nchit, a mere baby.... I repeat that that night I was in a very strange\nframe of mind. My heart was inclined to be tender, and there were\ntears standing in my eyes. Nothing did I conceal as I told him about\nmy friendship for him, about my desire to love him, about my scheme\nfor living in sympathy with him and comforting him, and making his\nlife easier. In return he threw me a look of confusion mingled with\nastonishment, and said nothing. Then suddenly I began to feel terribly\npained and disappointed, for I conceived that he had failed to\nunderstand me, or even that he might be laughing at me. Bursting into\ntears like a child, I sobbed, and could not stop myself, for I had\nfallen into a kind of fit; whereupon he seized my hand, kissed it, and\nclasped it to his breast--saying various things, meanwhile, to comfort\nme, for he was labouring under a strong emotion. Exactly what he said\nI do not remember--I merely wept and laughed by turns, and blushed, and\nfound myself unable to speak a word for joy. Yet, for all my agitation,\nI noticed that about him there still lingered an air of constraint\nand uneasiness. Evidently, he was lost in wonder at my enthusiasm and\nraptures--at my curiously ardent, unexpected, consuming friendship. It\nmay be that at first he was amazed, but that afterwards he accepted my\ndevotion and words of invitation and expressions of interest with the\nsame simple frankness as I had offered them, and responded to them\nwith an interest, a friendliness, a devotion equal to my own, even as a\nfriend or a brother would do. How happy, how warm was the feeling in my\nheart! Nothing had I concealed or repressed. No, I had bared all to his\nsight, and each day would see him draw nearer to me.\n\nTruly I could not say what we did not talk about during those painful,\nyet rapturous, hours when, by the trembling light of a lamp, and almost\nat the very bedside of my poor sick mother, we kept midnight tryst.\nWhatsoever first came into our heads we spoke of--whatsoever came riven\nfrom our hearts, whatsoever seemed to call for utterance, found voice.\nAnd almost always we were happy. What a grievous, yet joyous, period it\nwas--a period grievous and joyous at the same time! To this day it both\nhurts and delights me to recall it. Joyous or bitter though it was, its\nmemories are yet painful. At least they seem so to me, though a certain\nsweetness assuaged the pain. So, whenever I am feeling heartsick and\noppressed and jaded and sad those memories return to freshen and revive\nme, even as drops of evening dew return to freshen and revive, after a\nsultry day, the poor faded flower which has long been drooping in the\nnoontide heat.\n\nMy mother grew better, but still I continued to spend the nights on\na chair by her bedside. Often, too, Pokrovski would give me books. At\nfirst I read them merely so as to avoid going to sleep, but afterwards I\nexamined them with more attention, and subsequently with actual avidity,\nfor they opened up to me a new, an unexpected, an unknown, an unfamiliar\nworld. New thoughts, added to new impressions, would come pouring\ninto my heart in a rich flood; and the more emotion, the more pain and\nlabour, it cost me to assimilate these new impressions, the dearer did\nthey become to me, and the more gratefully did they stir my soul to\nits very depths. Crowding into my heart without giving it time even to\nbreathe, they would cause my whole being to become lost in a wondrous\nchaos. Yet this spiritual ferment was not sufficiently strong wholly to\nundo me. For that I was too fanciful, and the fact saved me.\n\nWith the passing of my mother's illness the midnight meetings and\nlong conversations between myself and Pokrovski came to an end. Only\noccasionally did we exchange a few words with one another--words, for\nthe most part, that were of little purport or substance, yet words\nto which it delighted me to apportion their several meanings, their\npeculiar secret values. My life had now become full--I was happy; I was\nquietly, restfully happy. Thus did several weeks elapse....\n\nOne day the elder Pokrovski came to see us, and chattered in a\nbrisk, cheerful, garrulous sort of way. He laughed, launched out into\nwitticisms, and, finally, resolved the riddle of his transports by\ninforming us that in a week's time it would be his Petinka's birthday,\nwhen, in honour of the occasion, he (the father) meant to don a new\njacket (as well as new shoes which his wife was going to buy for him),\nand to come and pay a visit to his son. In short, the old man was\nperfectly happy, and gossiped about whatsoever first entered his head.\n\nMy lover's birthday! Thenceforward, I could not rest by night or day.\nWhatever might happen, it was my fixed intention to remind Pokrovski\nof our friendship by giving him a present. But what sort of present?\nFinally, I decided to give him books. I knew that he had long wanted to\npossess a complete set of Pushkin's works, in the latest edition; so,\nI decided to buy Pushkin. My private fund consisted of thirty roubles,\nearned by handiwork, and designed eventually to procure me a new dress,\nbut at once I dispatched our cook, old Matrena, to ascertain the price\nof such an edition. Horrors! The price of the eleven volumes, added to\nextra outlay upon the binding, would amount to at least SIXTY roubles!\nWhere was the money to come from? I thought and thought, yet could not\ndecide. I did not like to resort to my mother. Of course she would help\nme, but in that case every one in the house would become aware of my\ngift, and the gift itself would assume the guise of a recompense--of\npayment for Pokrovski's labours on my behalf during the past year;\nwhereas, I wished to present the gift ALONE, and without the knowledge\nof anyone. For the trouble that he had taken with me I wished to be his\nperpetual debtor--to make him no payment at all save my friendship. At\nlength, I thought of a way out of the difficulty.\n\nI knew that of the hucksters in the Gostinni Dvor one could sometimes\nbuy a book--even one that had been little used and was almost entirely\nnew--for a half of its price, provided that one haggled sufficiently\nover it; wherefore I determined to repair thither. It so happened that,\nnext day, both Anna Thedorovna and ourselves were in want of sundry\narticles; and since my mother was unwell and Anna lazy, the execution of\nthe commissions devolved upon me, and I set forth with Matrena.\n\nLuckily, I soon chanced upon a set of Pushkin, handsomely bound, and\nset myself to bargain for it. At first more was demanded than would have\nbeen asked of me in a shop; but afterwards--though not without a great\ndeal of trouble on my part, and several feints at departing--I induced\nthe dealer to lower his price, and to limit his demands to ten roubles\nin silver. How I rejoiced that I had engaged in this bargaining! Poor\nMatrena could not imagine what had come to me, nor why I so desired to\nbuy books. But, oh horror of horrors! As soon as ever the dealer caught\nsight of my capital of thirty roubles in notes, he refused to let the\nPushkin go for less than the sum he had first named; and though, in\nanswer to my prayers and protestations, he eventually yielded a little,\nhe did so only to the tune of two-and-a-half roubles more than I\npossessed, while swearing that he was making the concession for my sake\nalone, since I was \"a sweet young lady,\" and that he would have done so\nfor no one else in the world. To think that only two-and-a-half roubles\nshould still be wanting! I could have wept with vexation. Suddenly an\nunlooked-for circumstance occurred to help me in my distress.\n\nNot far away, near another table that was heaped with books, I perceived\nthe elder Pokrovski, and a crowd of four or five hucksters plaguing him\nnearly out of his senses. Each of these fellows was proffering the old\nman his own particular wares; and while there was nothing that they did\nnot submit for his approval, there was nothing that he wished to buy.\nThe poor old fellow had the air of a man who is receiving a thrashing.\nWhat to make of what he was being offered him he did not know.\nApproaching him, I inquired what he happened to be doing there; whereat\nthe old man was delighted, since he liked me (it may be) no less than he\ndid Petinka.\n\n\"I am buying some books, Barbara Alexievna,\" said he, \"I am buying them\nfor my Petinka. It will be his birthday soon, and since he likes books I\nthought I would get him some.\"\n\nThe old man always expressed himself in a very roundabout sort of\nfashion, and on the present occasion he was doubly, terribly confused.\nOf no matter what book he asked the price, it was sure to be one, two,\nor three roubles. The larger books he could not afford at all; he could\nonly look at them wistfully, fumble their leaves with his finger, turn\nover the volumes in his hands, and then replace them. \"No, no, that\nis too dear,\" he would mutter under his breath. \"I must go and try\nsomewhere else.\" Then again he would fall to examining copy-books,\ncollections of poems, and almanacs of the cheaper order.\n\n\"Why should you buy things like those?\" I asked him. \"They are such\nrubbish!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" he replied. \"See what nice books they are! Yes, they ARE nice\nbooks!\" Yet these last words he uttered so lingeringly that I could see\nhe was ready to weep with vexation at finding the better sorts of books\nso expensive. Already a little tear was trickling down his pale cheeks\nand red nose. I inquired whether he had much money on him; whereupon the\npoor old fellow pulled out his entire stock, wrapped in a piece of\ndirty newspaper, and consisting of a few small silver coins, with twenty\nkopecks in copper. At once I seized the lot, and, dragging him off to my\nhuckster, said: \"Look here. These eleven volumes of Pushkin are priced\nat thirty-two-and-a-half roubles, and I have only thirty roubles. Let\nus add to them these two-and-a-half roubles of yours, and buy the books\ntogether, and make them our joint gift.\" The old man was overjoyed, and\npulled out his money en masse; whereupon the huckster loaded him with\nour common library. Stuffing it into his pockets, as well as filling\nboth arms with it, he departed homewards with his prize, after giving me\nhis word to bring me the books privately on the morrow.\n\nNext day the old man came to see his son, and sat with him, as usual,\nfor about an hour; after which he visited ourselves, wearing on his face\nthe most comical, the most mysterious expression conceivable. Smiling\nbroadly with satisfaction at the thought that he was the possessor of a\nsecret, he informed me that he had stealthily brought the books to our\nrooms, and hidden them in a corner of the kitchen, under Matrena's care.\nNext, by a natural transition, the conversation passed to the coming\nfete-day; whereupon, the old man proceeded to hold forth extensively\non the subject of gifts. The further he delved into his thesis, and the\nmore he expounded it, the clearer could I see that on his mind there was\nsomething which he could not, dared not, divulge. So I waited and kept\nsilent. The mysterious exaltation, the repressed satisfaction which I\nhad hitherto discerned in his antics and grimaces and left-eyed winks\ngradually disappeared, and he began to grow momentarily more anxious and\nuneasy. At length he could contain himself no longer.\n\n\"Listen, Barbara Alexievna,\" he said timidly. \"Listen to what I have got\nto say to you. When his birthday is come, do you take TEN of the books,\nand give them to him yourself--that is, FOR yourself, as being YOUR\nshare of the gift. Then I will take the eleventh book, and give it to\nhim MYSELF, as being my gift. If we do that, you will have a present for\nhim and I shall have one--both of us alike.\"\n\n\"Why do you not want us to present our gifts together, Zachar\nPetrovitch?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" he replied. \"Very well, Barbara Alexievna. Only--only,\nI thought that--\"\n\nThe old man broke off in confusion, while his face flushed with the\nexertion of thus expressing himself. For a moment or two he sat glued to\nhis seat.\n\n\"You see,\" he went on, \"I play the fool too much. I am forever playing\nthe fool, and cannot help myself, though I know that it is wrong to do\nso. At home it is often cold, and sometimes there are other troubles\nas well, and it all makes me depressed. Well, whenever that happens, I\nindulge a little, and occasionally drink too much. Now, Petinka does not\nlike that; he loses his temper about it, Barbara Alexievna, and scolds\nme, and reads me lectures. So I want by my gift to show him that I am\nmending my ways, and beginning to conduct myself better. For a long time\npast, I have been saving up to buy him a book--yes, for a long time past\nI have been saving up for it, since it is seldom that I have any\nmoney, unless Petinka happens to give me some. He knows that, and,\nconsequently, as soon as ever he perceives the use to which I have put\nhis money, he will understand that it is for his sake alone that I have\nacted.\"\n\nMy heart ached for the old man. Seeing him looking at me with such\nanxiety, I made up my mind without delay.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" I said. \"Do you give him all the books.\"\n\n\"ALL?\" he ejaculated. \"ALL the books?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them.\"\n\n\"As my own gift?\" \"Yes, as your own gift.\"\n\n\"As my gift alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, as your gift alone.\"\n\nSurely I had spoken clearly enough, yet the old man seemed hardly to\nunderstand me.\n\n\"Well,\" said he after reflection, \"that certainly would be\nsplendid--certainly it would be most splendid. But what about yourself,\nBarbara Alexievna?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall give your son nothing.\"\n\n\"What?\" he cried in dismay. \"Are you going to give Petinka nothing--do\nyou WISH to give him nothing?\" So put about was the old fellow with what\nI had said, that he seemed almost ready to renounce his own proposal\nif only I would give his son something. What a kind heart he had! I\nhastened to assure him that I should certainly have a gift of some sort\nready, since my one wish was to avoid spoiling his pleasure.\n\n\"Provided that your son is pleased,\" I added, \"and that you are pleased,\nI shall be equally pleased, for in my secret heart I shall feel as\nthough I had presented the gift.\"\n\nThis fully reassured the old man. He stopped with us another couple of\nhours, yet could not sit still for a moment, but kept jumping up from\nhis seat, laughing, cracking jokes with Sasha, bestowing stealthy kisses\nupon myself, pinching my hands, and making silent grimaces at Anna\nThedorovna. At length, she turned him out of the house. In short, his\ntransports of joy exceeded anything that I had yet beheld.\n\nOn the festal day he arrived exactly at eleven o'clock, direct from\nMass. He was dressed in a carefully mended frockcoat, a new waistcoat,\nand a pair of new shoes, while in his arms he carried our pile of\nbooks. Next we all sat down to coffee (the day being Sunday) in Anna\nThedorovna's parlour. The old man led off the meal by saying\nthat Pushkin was a magnificent poet. Thereafter, with a return to\nshamefacedness and confusion, he passed suddenly to the statement that\na man ought to conduct himself properly; that, should he not do so, it\nmight be taken as a sign that he was in some way overindulging himself;\nand that evil tendencies of this sort led to the man's ruin and\ndegradation. Then the orator sketched for our benefit some terrible\ninstances of such incontinence, and concluded by informing us that for\nsome time past he had been mending his own ways, and conducting himself\nin exemplary fashion, for the reason that he had perceived the justice\nof his son's precepts, and had laid them to heart so well that he, the\nfather, had really changed for the better: in proof whereof, he now\nbegged to present to the said son some books for which he had long been\nsetting aside his savings.\n\nAs I listened to the old man I could not help laughing and crying in\na breath. Certainly he knew how to lie when the occasion required! The\nbooks were transferred to his son's room, and arranged upon a shelf,\nwhere Pokrovski at once guessed the truth about them. Then the old man\nwas invited to dinner and we all spent a merry day together at cards and\nforfeits. Sasha was full of life, and I rivalled her, while Pokrovski\npaid me numerous attentions, and kept seeking an occasion to speak to me\nalone. But to allow this to happen I refused. Yes, taken all in all, it\nwas the happiest day that I had known for four years.\n\nBut now only grievous, painful memories come to my recollection, for I\nmust enter upon the story of my darker experiences. It may be that that\nis why my pen begins to move more slowly, and seems as though it were\ngoing altogether to refuse to write. The same reason may account for my\nhaving undertaken so lovingly and enthusiastically a recounting of even\nthe smallest details of my younger, happier days. But alas! those days\ndid not last long, and were succeeded by a period of black sorrow which\nwill close only God knows when!\n\nMy misfortunes began with the illness and death of Pokrovski, who was\ntaken worse two months after what I have last recorded in these memoirs.\nDuring those two months he worked hard to procure himself a livelihood\nsince hitherto he had had no assured position. Like all consumptives, he\nnever--not even up to his last moment--altogether abandoned the hope of\nbeing able to enjoy a long life. A post as tutor fell in his way, but he\nhad never liked the profession; while for him to become a civil servant\nwas out of the question, owing to his weak state of health. Moreover, in\nthe latter capacity he would have had to have waited a long time for his\nfirst instalment of salary. Again, he always looked at the darker side\nof things, for his character was gradually being warped, and his health\nundermined by his illness, though he never noticed it. Then autumn came\non, and daily he went out to business--that is to say, to apply for and\nto canvass for posts--clad only in a light jacket; with the result that,\nafter repeated soakings with rain, he had to take to his bed, and\nnever again left it. He died in mid-autumn at the close of the month of\nOctober.\n\nThroughout his illness I scarcely ever left his room, but waited on him\nhand and foot. Often he could not sleep for several nights at a time.\nOften, too, he was unconscious, or else in a delirium; and at such times\nhe would talk of all sorts of things--of his work, of his books, of his\nfather, of myself. At such times I learned much which I had not hitherto\nknown or divined about his affairs. During the early part of his illness\neveryone in the house looked askance at me, and Anna Thedorovna would\nnod her head in a meaning manner; but, I always looked them straight in\nthe face, and gradually they ceased to take any notice of my concern for\nPokrovski. At all events my mother ceased to trouble her head about it.\n\nSometimes Pokrovski would know who I was, but not often, for more\nusually he was unconscious. Sometimes, too, he would talk all night with\nsome unknown person, in dim, mysterious language that caused his gasping\nvoice to echo hoarsely through the narrow room as through a sepulchre;\nand at such times, I found the situation a strange one. During his last\nnight he was especially lightheaded, for then he was in terrible agony,\nand kept rambling in his speech until my soul was torn with pity.\nEveryone in the house was alarmed, and Anna Thedorovna fell to praying\nthat God might soon take him. When the doctor had been summoned, the\nverdict was that the patient would die with the morning.\n\nThat night the elder Pokrovski spent in the corridor, at the door of his\nson's room. Though given a mattress to lie upon, he spent his time in\nrunning in and out of the apartment. So broken with grief was he that\nhe presented a dreadful spectacle, and appeared to have lost both\nperception and feeling. His head trembled with agony, and his body\nquivered from head to foot as at times he murmured to himself something\nwhich he appeared to be debating. Every moment I expected to see him go\nout of his mind. Just before dawn he succumbed to the stress of mental\nagony, and fell asleep on his mattress like a man who has been beaten;\nbut by eight o'clock the son was at the point of death, and I ran to\nwake the father. The dying man was quite conscious, and bid us all\nfarewell. Somehow I could not weep, though my heart seemed to be\nbreaking.\n\nThe last moments were the most harassing and heartbreaking of all. For\nsome time past Pokrovski had been asking for something with his failing\ntongue, but I had been unable to distinguish his words. Yet my heart had\nbeen bursting with grief. Then for an hour he had lain quieter, except\nthat he had looked sadly in my direction, and striven to make some sign\nwith his death-cold hands. At last he again essayed his piteous request\nin a hoarse, deep voice, but the words issued in so many inarticulate\nsounds, and once more I failed to divine his meaning. By turns I brought\neach member of the household to his bedside, and gave him something to\ndrink, but he only shook his head sorrowfully. Finally, I understood\nwhat it was he wanted. He was asking me to draw aside the curtain from\nthe window, and to open the casements. Probably he wished to take his\nlast look at the daylight and the sun and all God's world. I pulled back\nthe curtain, but the opening day was as dull and mournful--looking as\nthough it had been the fast-flickering life of the poor invalid. Of\nsunshine there was none. Clouds overlaid the sky as with a shroud of\nmist, and everything looked sad, rainy, and threatening under a fine\ndrizzle which was beating against the window-panes, and streaking their\ndull, dark surfaces with runlets of cold, dirty moisture. Only a scanty\nmodicum of daylight entered to war with the trembling rays of the ikon\nlamp. The dying man threw me a wistful look, and nodded. The next moment\nhe had passed away.\n\nThe funeral was arranged for by Anna Thedorovna. A plain coffin was\nbought, and a broken-down hearse hired; while, as security for\nthis outlay, she seized the dead man's books and other articles.\nNevertheless, the old man disputed the books with her, and, raising an\nuproar, carried off as many of them as he could--stuffing his pockets\nfull, and even filling his hat. Indeed, he spent the next three days\nwith them thus, and refused to let them leave his sight even when it was\ntime for him to go to church. Throughout he acted like a man bereft\nof sense and memory. With quaint assiduity he busied himself about the\nbier--now straightening the candlestick on the dead man's breast, now\nsnuffing and lighting the other candles. Clearly his thoughts were\npowerless to remain long fixed on any subject. Neither my mother nor\nAnna Thedorovna were present at the requiem, for the former was ill\nand the latter was at loggerheads with the old man. Only myself and\nthe father were there. During the service a sort of panic, a sort of\npremonition of the future, came over me, and I could hardly hold myself\nupright. At length the coffin had received its burden and was screwed\ndown; after which the bearers placed it upon a bier, and set out. I\naccompanied the cortege only to the end of the street. Here the\ndriver broke into a trot, and the old man started to run behind the\nhearse--sobbing loudly, but with the motion of his running ever and anon\ncausing the sobs to quaver and become broken off. Next he lost his hat,\nthe poor old fellow, yet would not stop to pick it up, even though the\nrain was beating upon his head, and a wind was rising and the sleet kept\nstinging and lashing his face. It seemed as though he were impervious\nto the cruel elements as he ran from one side of the hearse to the\nother--the skirts of his old greatcoat flapping about him like a pair\nof wings. From every pocket of the garment protruded books, while in his\nhand he carried a specially large volume, which he hugged closely to his\nbreast. The passers-by uncovered their heads and crossed themselves as\nthe cortege passed, and some of them, having done so, remained staring\nin amazement at the poor old man. Every now and then a book would slip\nfrom one of his pockets and fall into the mud; whereupon somebody,\nstopping him, would direct his attention to his loss, and he would stop,\npick up the book, and again set off in pursuit of the hearse. At the\ncorner of the street he was joined by a ragged old woman; until at\nlength the hearse turned a corner, and became hidden from my eyes. Then\nI went home, and threw myself, in a transport of grief, upon my mother's\nbreast--clasping her in my arms, kissing her amid a storm of sobs and\ntears, and clinging to her form as though in my embraces I were holding\nmy last friend on earth, that I might preserve her from death. Yet\nalready death was standing over her....\n\n\n\n\nJune 11th\n\nHow I thank you for our walk to the Islands yesterday, Makar\nAlexievitch! How fresh and pleasant, how full of verdure, was\neverything! And I had not seen anything green for such a long time!\nDuring my illness I used to think that I should never get better, that\nI was certainly going to die. Judge, then, how I felt yesterday! True,\nI may have seemed to you a little sad, and you must not be angry with me\nfor that. Happy and light-hearted though I was, there were moments, even\nat the height of my felicity, when, for some unknown reason, depression\ncame sweeping over my soul. I kept weeping about trifles, yet could not\nsay why I was grieved. The truth is that I am unwell--so much so, that\nI look at everything from the gloomy point of view. The pale, clear sky,\nthe setting sun, the evening stillness--ah, somehow I felt disposed\nto grieve and feel hurt at these things; my heart seemed to be\nover-charged, and to be calling for tears to relieve it. But why should\nI write this to you? It is difficult for my heart to express itself;\nstill more difficult for it to forego self-expression. Yet possibly\nyou may understand me. Tears and laughter!... How good you are, Makar\nAlexievitch! Yesterday you looked into my eyes as though you could\nread in them all that I was feeling--as though you were rejoicing at my\nhappiness. Whether it were a group of shrubs or an alleyway or a vista\nof water that we were passing, you would halt before me, and stand\ngazing at my face as though you were showing me possessions of your own.\nIt told me how kind is your nature, and I love you for it. Today I am\nagain unwell, for yesterday I wetted my feet, and took a chill. Thedora\nalso is unwell; both of us are ailing. Do not forget me. Come and see me\nas often as you can.--Your own,\n\nBARBARA ALEXIEVNA.\n\n\n\n\nJune 12th.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA--I had supposed that you meant to describe\nour doings of the other day in verse; yet from you there has arrived\nonly a single sheet of writing. Nevertheless, I must say that, little\nthough you have put into your letter, that little is not expressed with\nrare beauty and grace. Nature, your descriptions of rural scenes, your\nanalysis of your own feelings--the whole is beautifully written. Alas,\nI have no such talent! Though I may fill a score of pages, nothing comes\nof it--I might as well never have put pen to paper. Yes, this I know\nfrom experience.\n\nYou say, my darling, that I am kind and good, that I could not harm\nmy fellow-men, that I have power to comprehend the goodness of God\n(as expressed in nature's handiwork), and so on. It may all be so, my\ndearest one--it may all be exactly as you say. Indeed, I think that you\nare right. But if so, the reason is that when one reads such a letter\nas you have just sent me, one's heart involuntarily softens, and\naffords entrance to thoughts of a graver and weightier order. Listen, my\ndarling; I have something to tell you, my beloved one.\n\nI will begin from the time when I was seventeen years old and first\nentered the service--though I shall soon have completed my thirtieth\nyear of official activity. I may say that at first I was much pleased\nwith my new uniform; and, as I grew older, I grew in mind, and fell\nto studying my fellow-men. Likewise I may say that I lived an upright\nlife--so much so that at last I incurred persecution. This you may not\nbelieve, but it is true. To think that men so cruel should exist! For\nthough, dearest one, I am dull and of no account, I have feelings like\neveryone else. Consequently, would you believe it, Barbara, when I\ntell you what these cruel fellows did to me? I feel ashamed to tell\nit you--and all because I was of a quiet, peaceful, good-natured\ndisposition!\n\nThings began with \"this or that, Makar Alexievitch, is your fault.\"\nThen it went on to \"I need hardly say that the fault is wholly Makar\nAlexievitch's.\" Finally it became \"OF COURSE Makar Alexievitch is to\nblame.\" Do you see the sequence of things, my darling? Every mistake\nwas attributed to me, until \"Makar Alexievitch\" became a byword in our\ndepartment. Also, while making of me a proverb, these fellows could not\ngive me a smile or a civil word. They found fault with my boots, with\nmy uniform, with my hair, with my figure. None of these things were to\ntheir taste: everything had to be changed. And so it has been from\nthat day to this. True, I have now grown used to it, for I can\ngrow accustomed to anything (being, as you know, a man of peaceable\ndisposition, like all men of small stature)--yet why should these things\nbe? Whom have I harmed? Whom have I ever supplanted? Whom have I ever\ntraduced to his superiors? No, the fault is that more than once I have\nasked for an increase of salary. But have I ever CABALLED for it? No,\nyou would be wrong in thinking so, my dearest one. HOW could I ever\nhave done so? You yourself have had many opportunities of seeing how\nincapable I am of deceit or chicanery.\n\nWhy then, should this have fallen to my lot?... However, since you think\nme worthy of respect, my darling, I do not care, for you are far and\naway the best person in the world.... What do you consider to be the\ngreatest social virtue? In private conversation Evstafi Ivanovitch once\ntold me that the greatest social virtue might be considered to be an\nability to get money to spend. Also, my comrades used jestingly (yes,\nI know only jestingly) to propound the ethical maxim that a man ought\nnever to let himself become a burden upon anyone. Well, I am a burden\nupon no one. It is my own crust of bread that I eat; and though that\ncrust is but a poor one, and sometimes actually a maggoty one, it has\nat least been EARNED, and therefore, is being put to a right and lawful\nuse. What therefore, ought I to do? I know that I can earn but little by\nmy labours as a copyist; yet even of that little I am proud, for it has\nentailed WORK, and has wrung sweat from my brow. What harm is there in\nbeing a copyist? \"He is only an amanuensis,\" people say of me. But what\nis there so disgraceful in that? My writing is at least legible, neat,\nand pleasant to look upon--and his Excellency is satisfied with it.\nIndeed, I transcribe many important documents. At the same time, I know\nthat my writing lacks STYLE, which is why I have never risen in the\nservice. Even to you, my dear one, I write simply and without tricks,\nbut just as a thought may happen to enter my head. Yes, I know all this;\nbut if everyone were to become a fine writer, who would there be left to\nact as copyists?... Whatsoever questions I may put to you in my letters,\ndearest, I pray you to answer them. I am sure that you need me, that I\ncan be of use to you; and, since that is so, I must not allow myself\nto be distracted by any trifle. Even if I be likened to a rat, I do not\ncare, provided that that particular rat be wanted by you, and be of use\nin the world, and be retained in its position, and receive its reward.\nBut what a rat it is!\n\nEnough of this, dearest one. I ought not to have spoken of it, but I\nlost my temper. Still, it is pleasant to speak the truth sometimes.\nGoodbye, my own, my darling, my sweet little comforter! I will come to\nyou soon--yes, I will certainly come to you. Until I do so, do not fret\nyourself. With me I shall be bringing a book. Once more goodbye.--Your\nheartfelt well-wisher,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nJune 20th.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH--I am writing to you post-haste--I am\nhurrying my utmost to get my work finished in time. What do you suppose\nis the reason for this? It is because an opportunity has occurred for\nyou to make a splendid purchase. Thedora tells me that a retired civil\nservant of her acquaintance has a uniform to sell--one cut to regulation\npattern and in good repair, as well as likely to go very cheap. Now, DO\nnot tell me that you have not got the money, for I know from your own\nlips that you HAVE. Use that money, I pray you, and do not hoard it. See\nwhat terrible garments you walk about in! They are shameful--they are\npatched all over! In fact, you have nothing new whatever. That this is\nso, I know for certain, and I care not WHAT you tell me about it. So\nlisten to me for once, and buy this uniform. Do it for MY sake. Do it to\nshow that you really love me.\n\nYou have sent me some linen as a gift. But listen to me, Makar\nAlexievitch. You are simply ruining yourself. Is it a jest that you\nshould spend so much money, such a terrible amount of money, upon me?\nHow you love to play the spendthrift! I tell you that I do not need it,\nthat such expenditure is unnecessary. I know, I am CERTAIN, that you\nlove me--therefore, it is useless to remind me of the fact with gifts.\nNor do I like receiving them, since I know how much they must have cost\nyou. No--put your money to a better use. I beg, I beseech of you, to\ndo so. Also, you ask me to send you a continuation of my memoirs--to\nconclude them. But I know not how I contrived even to write as much of\nthem as I did; and now I have not the strength to write further of my\npast, nor the desire to give it a single thought. Such recollections are\nterrible to me. Most difficult of all is it for me to speak of my poor\nmother, who left her destitute daughter a prey to villains. My heart\nruns blood whenever I think of it; it is so fresh in my memory that\nI cannot dismiss it from my thoughts, nor rest for its insistence,\nalthough a year has now elapsed since the events took place. But all\nthis you know.\n\nAlso, I have told you what Anna Thedorovna is now intending. She accuses\nme of ingratitude, and denies the accusations made against herself with\nregard to Monsieur Bwikov. Also, she keeps sending for me, and telling\nme that I have taken to evil courses, but that if I will return to her,\nshe will smooth over matters with Bwikov, and force him to confess his\nfault. Also, she says that he desires to give me a dowry. Away with them\nall! I am quite happy here with you and good Thedora, whose devotion to\nme reminds me of my old nurse, long since dead. Distant kinsman though\nyou may be, I pray you always to defend my honour. Other people I do\nnot wish to know, and would gladly forget if I could.... What are they\nwanting with me now? Thedora declares it all to be a trick, and says\nthat in time they will leave me alone. God grant it be so!\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nJune 21st.\n\nMY OWN, MY DARLING,--I wish to write to you, yet know not where to\nbegin. Things are as strange as though we were actually living together.\nAlso I would add that never in my life have I passed such happy days as\nI am spending at present. 'Tis as though God had blessed me with a home\nand a family of my own! Yes, you are my little daughter, beloved. But\nwhy mention the four sorry roubles that I sent you? You needed them;\nI know that from Thedora herself, and it will always be a particular\npleasure to me to gratify you in anything. It will always be my one\nhappiness in life. Pray, therefore, leave me that happiness, and do\nnot seek to cross me in it. Things are not as you suppose. I have now\nreached the sunshine since, in the first place, I am living so close to\nyou as almost to be with you (which is a great consolation to my mind),\nwhile, in the second place, a neighbour of mine named Rataziaev (the\nretired official who gives the literary parties) has today invited me\nto tea. This evening, therefore, there will be a gathering at which we\nshall discuss literature! Think of that my darling! Well, goodbye now.\nI have written this without any definite aim in my mind, but solely to\nassure you of my welfare. Through Theresa I have received your message\nthat you need an embroidered cloak to wear, so I will go and purchase\none. Yes, tomorrow I mean to purchase that embroidered cloak, and so\ngive myself the pleasure of having satisfied one of your wants. I know\nwhere to go for such a garment. For the time being I remain your sincere\nfriend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nJune 22nd.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I have to tell you that a sad event\nhas happened in this house--an event to excite one's utmost pity.\nThis morning, about five o'clock, one of Gorshkov's children died of\nscarlatina, or something of the kind. I have been to pay the parents\na visit of condolence, and found them living in the direst poverty and\ndisorder. Nor is that surprising, seeing that the family lives in a\nsingle room, with only a screen to divide it for decency's sake. Already\nthe coffin was standing in their midst--a plain but decent shell which\nhad been bought ready-made. The child, they told me, had been a boy of\nnine, and full of promise. What a pitiful spectacle! Though not weeping,\nthe mother, poor woman, looked broken with grief. After all, to have one\nburden the less on their shoulders may prove a relief, though there are\nstill two children left--a babe at the breast and a little girl of six!\nHow painful to see these suffering children, and to be unable to help\nthem! The father, clad in an old, dirty frockcoat, was seated on a\ndilapidated chair. Down his cheeks there were coursing tears--though\nless through grief than owing to a long-standing affliction of the eyes.\nHe was so thin, too! Always he reddens in the face when he is addressed,\nand becomes too confused to answer. A little girl, his daughter, was\nleaning against the coffin--her face looking so worn and thoughtful,\npoor mite! Do you know, I cannot bear to see a child look thoughtful.\nOn the floor there lay a rag doll, but she was not playing with it as,\nmotionless, she stood there with her finger to her lips. Even a bon-bon\nwhich the landlady had given her she was not eating. Is it not all sad,\nsad, Barbara?\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nJune 25th.\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH--I return you your book. In my opinion it\nis a worthless one, and I would rather not have it in my possession.\nWhy do you save up your money to buy such trash? Except in jest, do\nsuch books really please you? However, you have now promised to send me\nsomething else to read. I will share the cost of it. Now, farewell until\nwe meet again. I have nothing more to say.\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nJune 26th.\n\nMY DEAR LITTLE BARBARA--To tell you the truth, I myself have not read\nthe book of which you speak. That is to say, though I began to read it,\nI soon saw that it was nonsense, and written only to make people laugh.\n\"However,\" thought I, \"it is at least a CHEERFUL work, and so may please\nBarbara.\" That is why I sent it you.\n\nRataziaev has now promised to give me something really literary to read;\nso you shall soon have your book, my darling. He is a man who reflects;\nhe is a clever fellow, as well as himself a writer--such a writer! His\npen glides along with ease, and in such a style (even when he is writing\nthe most ordinary, the most insignificant of articles) that I have often\nremarked upon the fact, both to Phaldoni and to Theresa. Often, too, I\ngo to spend an evening with him. He reads aloud to us until five o'clock\nin the morning, and we listen to him. It is a revelation of things\nrather than a reading. It is charming, it is like a bouquet of\nflowers--there is a bouquet of flowers in every line of each page.\nBesides, he is such an approachable, courteous, kind-hearted fellow!\nWhat am I compared with him? Why, nothing, simply nothing! He is a\nman of reputation, whereas I--well, I do not exist at all. Yet he\ncondescends to my level. At this very moment I am copying out a\ndocument for him. But you must not think that he finds any DIFFICULTY in\ncondescending to me, who am only a copyist. No, you must not believe the\nbase gossip that you may hear. I do copying work for him simply in order\nto please myself, as well as that he may notice me--a thing that always\ngives me pleasure. I appreciate the delicacy of his position. He is a\ngood--a very good--man, and an unapproachable writer.\n\nWhat a splendid thing is literature, Barbara--what a splendid thing!\nThis I learnt before I had known Rataziaev even for three days. It\nstrengthens and instructs the heart of man.... No matter what there be\nin the world, you will find it all written down in Rataziaev's works.\nAnd so well written down, too! Literature is a sort of picture--a sort\nof picture or mirror. It connotes at once passion, expression, fine\ncriticism, good learning, and a document. Yes, I have learned this from\nRataziaev himself. I can assure you, Barbara, that if only you could be\nsitting among us, and listening to the talk (while, with the rest of us,\nyou smoked a pipe), and were to hear those present begin to argue\nand dispute concerning different matters, you would feel of as little\naccount among them as I do; for I myself figure there only as a\nblockhead, and feel ashamed, since it takes me a whole evening to think\nof a single word to interpolate--and even then the word will not come!\nIn a case like that a man regrets that, as the proverb has it, he should\nhave reached man's estate but not man's understanding.... What do I\ndo in my spare time? I sleep like a fool, though I would far rather be\noccupied with something else--say, with eating or writing, since the one\nis useful to oneself, and the other is beneficial to one's fellows. You\nshould see how much money these fellows contrive to save! How much, for\ninstance, does not Rataziaev lay by? A few days' writing, I am told, can\nearn him as much as three hundred roubles! Indeed, if a man be a writer\nof short stories or anything else that is interesting, he can sometimes\npocket five hundred roubles, or a thousand, at a time! Think of it,\nBarbara! Rataziaev has by him a small manuscript of verses, and for it\nhe is asking--what do you think? Seven thousand roubles! Why, one could\nbuy a whole house for that sum! He has even refused five thousand for a\nmanuscript, and on that occasion I reasoned with him, and advised him\nto accept the five thousand. But it was of no use. \"For,\" said he, \"they\nwill soon offer me seven thousand,\" and kept to his point, for he is a\nman of some determination.\n\nSuppose, now, that I were to give you an extract from \"Passion in Italy\"\n(as another work of his is called). Read this, dearest Barbara, and\njudge for yourself:\n\n\"Vladimir started, for in his veins the lust of passion had welled until\nit had reached boiling point.\n\n\"'Countess,' he cried, 'do you know how terrible is this adoration of\nmine, how infinite this madness? No! My fancies have not deceived me--I\nlove you ecstatically, diabolically, as a madman might! All the blood\nthat is in your husband's body could never quench the furious,\nsurging rapture that is in my soul! No puny obstacle could thwart the\nall-destroying, infernal flame which is eating into my exhausted breast!\nOh Zinaida, my Zinaida!'\n\n\"'Vladimir!' she whispered, almost beside herself, as she sank upon his\nbosom.\n\n\"'My Zinaida!' cried the enraptured Smileski once more.\n\n\"His breath was coming in sharp, broken pants. The lamp of love was\nburning brightly on the altar of passion, and searing the hearts of the\ntwo unfortunate sufferers.\n\n\"'Vladimir!' again she whispered in her intoxication, while her bosom\nheaved, her cheeks glowed, and her eyes flashed fire.\n\n\"Thus was a new and dread union consummated.\n\n\"Half an hour later the aged Count entered his wife's boudoir.\n\n\"'How now, my love?' said he. 'Surely it is for some welcome guest\nbeyond the common that you have had the samovar [Tea-urn.] thus\nprepared?' And he smote her lightly on the cheek.\"\n\nWhat think you of THAT, Barbara? True, it is a little too\noutspoken--there can be no doubt of that; yet how grand it is, how\nsplendid! With your permission I will also quote you an extract from\nRataziaev's story, Ermak and Zuleika:\n\n\"'You love me, Zuleika? Say again that you love me, you love me!'\n\n\"'I DO love you, Ermak,' whispered Zuleika.\n\n\"'Then by heaven and earth I thank you! By heaven and earth you have\nmade me happy! You have given me all, all that my tortured soul has\nfor immemorial years been seeking! 'Tis for this that you have led me\nhither, my guiding star--'tis for this that you have conducted me to\nthe Girdle of Stone! To all the world will I now show my Zuleika, and\nno man, demon or monster of Hell, shall bid me nay! Oh, if men would but\nunderstand the mysterious passions of her tender heart, and see the poem\nwhich lurks in each of her little tears! Suffer me to dry those tears\nwith my kisses! Suffer me to drink of those heavenly drops, Oh being who\nart not of this earth!'\n\n\"'Ermak,' said Zuleika, 'the world is cruel, and men are unjust. But\nLET them drive us from their midst--let them judge us, my beloved Ermak!\nWhat has a poor maiden who was reared amid the snows of Siberia to do\nwith their cold, icy, self-sufficient world? Men cannot understand me,\nmy darling, my sweetheart.'\n\n\"'Is that so? Then shall the sword of the Cossacks sing and whistle over\ntheir heads!' cried Ermak with a furious look in his eyes.\"\n\nWhat must Ermak have felt when he learnt that his Zuleika had been\nmurdered, Barbara?--that, taking advantages of the cover of night, the\nblind old Kouchoum had, in Ermak's absence, broken into the latter's\ntent, and stabbed his own daughter in mistake for the man who had robbed\nhim of sceptre and crown?\n\n\"'Oh that I had a stone whereon to whet my sword!' cried Ermak in the\nmadness of his wrath as he strove to sharpen his steel blade upon the\nenchanted rock. 'I would have his blood, his blood! I would tear him\nlimb from limb, the villain!'\"\n\nThen Ermak, unable to survive the loss of his Zuleika, throws himself\ninto the Irtisch, and the tale comes to an end.\n\nHere, again, is another short extract--this time written in a more\ncomical vein, to make people laugh:\n\n\"Do you know Ivan Prokofievitch Zheltopuzh? He is the man who took a\npiece out of Prokofi Ivanovitch's leg. Ivan's character is one of the\nrugged order, and therefore, one that is rather lacking in virtue.\nYet he has a passionate relish for radishes and honey. Once he also\npossessed a friend named Pelagea Antonovna. Do you know Pelagea\nAntonovna? She is the woman who always puts on her petticoat wrong side\noutwards.\"\n\nWhat humour, Barbara--what purest humour! We rocked with laughter when\nhe read it aloud to us. Yes, that is the kind of man he is. Possibly the\npassage is a trifle over-frolicsome, but at least it is harmless, and\ncontains no freethought or liberal ideas. In passing, I may say that\nRataziaev is not only a supreme writer, but also a man of upright\nlife--which is more than can be said for most writers.\n\nWhat, do you think, is an idea that sometimes enters my head? In fact,\nwhat if I myself were to write something? How if suddenly a book were\nto make its appearance in the world bearing the title of \"The Poetical\nWorks of Makar Dievushkin\"? What THEN, my angel? How should you view,\nshould you receive, such an event? I may say of myself that never, after\nmy book had appeared, should I have the hardihood to show my face on\nthe Nevski Prospect; for would it not be too dreadful to hear every\none saying, \"Here comes the literateur and poet, Dievushkin--yes, it is\nDievushkin himself.\" What, in such a case, should I do with my feet (for\nI may tell you that almost always my shoes are patched, or have just\nbeen resoled, and therefore look anything but becoming)? To think that\nthe great writer Dievushkin should walk about in patched footgear! If\na duchess or a countess should recognise me, what would she say, poor\nwoman? Perhaps, though, she would not notice my shoes at all, since\nit may reasonably be supposed that countesses do not greatly occupy\nthemselves with footgear, especially with the footgear of civil service\nofficials (footgear may differ from footgear, it must be remembered).\nBesides, I should find that the countess had heard all about me, for\nmy friends would have betrayed me to her--Rataziaev among the first of\nthem, seeing that he often goes to visit Countess V., and practically\nlives at her house. She is said to be a woman of great intellect and\nwit. An artful dog, that Rataziaev!\n\nBut enough of this. I write this sort of thing both to amuse myself and\nto divert your thoughts. Goodbye now, my angel. This is a long epistle\nthat I am sending you, but the reason is that today I feel in good\nspirits after dining at Rataziaev's. There I came across a novel which I\nhardly know how to describe to you. Do not think the worse of me on that\naccount, even though I bring you another book instead (for I certainly\nmean to bring one). The novel in question was one of Paul de Kock's, and\nnot a novel for you to read. No, no! Such a work is unfit for your\neyes. In fact, it is said to have greatly offended the critics of St.\nPetersburg. Also, I am sending you a pound of bonbons--bought specially\nfor yourself. Each time that you eat one, beloved, remember the sender.\nOnly, do not bite the iced ones, but suck them gently, lest they make\nyour teeth ache. Perhaps, too, you like comfits? Well, write and tell\nme if it is so. Goodbye, goodbye. Christ watch over you, my\ndarling!--Always your faithful friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nJune 27th.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH--Thedora tells me that, should I wish,\nthere are some people who will be glad to help me by obtaining me an\nexcellent post as governess in a certain house. What think you, my\nfriend? Shall I go or not? Of course, I should then cease to be a burden\nto you, and the post appears to be a comfortable one. On the other hand,\nthe idea of entering a strange house appals me. The people in it are\nlanded gentry, and they will begin to ask me questions, and to busy\nthemselves about me. What answers shall I then return? You see, I am now\nso unused to society--so shy! I like to live in a corner to which I have\nlong grown used. Yes, the place with which one is familiar is always the\nbest. Even if for companion one has but sorrow, that place will still be\nthe best.... God alone knows what duties the post will entail. Perhaps\nI shall merely be required to act as nursemaid; and in any case, I hear\nthat the governess there has been changed three times in two years. For\nGod's sake, Makar Alexievitch, advise me whether to go or not. Why do\nyou never come near me now? Do let my eyes have an occasional sight of\nyou. Mass on Sundays is almost the only time when we see one another.\nHow retiring you have become! So also have I, even though, in a way, I\nam your kinswoman. You must have ceased to love me, Makar Alexievitch. I\nspend many a weary hour because of it. Sometimes, when dusk is falling,\nI find myself lonely--oh, so lonely! Thedora has gone out somewhere, and\nI sit here and think, and think, and think. I remember all the past, its\njoys and its sorrows. It passes before my eyes in detail, it glimmers at\nme as out of a mist; and as it does so, well-known faces appear, which\nseem actually to be present with me in this room! Most frequently of\nall, I see my mother. Ah, the dreams that come to me! I feel that my\nhealth is breaking, so weak am I. When this morning I arose, sickness\ntook me until I vomited and vomited. Yes, I feel, I know, that death is\napproaching. Who will bury me when it has come? Who will visit my tomb?\nWho will sorrow for me? And now it is in a strange place, in the house\nof a stranger, that I may have to die! Yes, in a corner which I do not\nknow!... My God, how sad a thing is life!... Why do you send me comfits\nto eat? Whence do you get the money to buy them? Ah, for God's sake keep\nthe money, keep the money. Thedora has sold a carpet which I have made.\nShe got fifty roubles for it, which is very good--I had expected less.\nOf the fifty roubles I shall give Thedora three, and with the remainder\nmake myself a plain, warm dress. Also, I am going to make you a\nwaistcoat--to make it myself, and out of good material.\n\nAlso, Thedora has brought me a book--\"The Stories of Bielkin\"--which I\nwill forward you, if you would care to read it. Only, do not soil it,\nnor yet retain it, for it does not belong to me. It is by Pushkin. Two\nyears ago I read these stories with my mother, and it would hurt me\nto read them again. If you yourself have any books, pray let me have\nthem--so long as they have not been obtained from Rataziaev. Probably he\nwill be giving you one of his own works when he has had one printed.\nHow is it that his compositions please you so much, Makar Alexievitch? I\nthink them SUCH rubbish!\n\n--Now goodbye. How I have been chattering on! When feeling sad, I always\nlike to talk of something, for it acts upon me like medicine--I begin\nto feel easier as soon as I have uttered what is preying upon my heart.\nGood bye, good-bye, my friend--Your own\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nJune 28th.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA--Away with melancholy! Really, beloved,\nyou ought to be ashamed of yourself! How can you allow such thoughts to\nenter your head? Really and truly you are quite well; really and truly\nyou are, my darling. Why, you are blooming--simply blooming. True, I see\na certain touch of pallor in your face, but still you are blooming. A\nfig for dreams and visions! Yes, for shame, dearest! Drive away those\nfancies; try to despise them. Why do I sleep so well? Why am I never\nailing? Look at ME, beloved. I live well, I sleep peacefully, I retain\nmy health, I can ruffle it with my juniors. In fact, it is a pleasure\nto see me. Come, come, then, sweetheart! Let us have no more of this.\nI know that that little head of yours is capable of any fancy--that all\ntoo easily you take to dreaming and repining; but for my sake, cease to\ndo so.\n\nAre you to go to these people, you ask me? Never! No, no, again no! How\ncould you think of doing such a thing as taking a journey? I will not\nallow it--I intend to combat your intention with all my might. I will\nsell my frockcoat, and walk the streets in my shirt sleeves, rather than\nlet you be in want. But no, Barbara. I know you, I know you. This is\nmerely a trick, merely a trick. And probably Thedora alone is to\nblame for it. She appears to be a foolish old woman, and to be able to\npersuade you to do anything. Do not believe her, my dearest. I am sure\nthat you know what is what, as well as SHE does. Eh, sweetheart? She is\na stupid, quarrelsome, rubbish-talking old woman who brought her late\nhusband to the grave. Probably she has been plaguing you as much as she\ndid him. No, no, dearest; you must not take this step. What should I do\nthen? What would there be left for ME to do? Pray put the idea out\nof your head. What is it you lack here? I cannot feel sufficiently\noverjoyed to be near you, while, for your part, you love me well, and\ncan live your life here as quietly as you wish. Read or sew, whichever\nyou like--or read and do not sew. Only, do not desert me. Try, yourself,\nto imagine how things would seem after you had gone. Here am I sending\nyou books, and later we will go for a walk. Come, come, then, my\nBarbara! Summon to your aid your reason, and cease to babble of trifles.\n\nAs soon as I can I will come and see you, and then you shall tell me the\nwhole story. This will not do, sweetheart; this certainly will not do.\nOf course, I know that I am not an educated man, and have received but a\nsorry schooling, and have had no inclination for it, and think too much\nof Rataziaev, if you will; but he is my friend, and therefore, I must\nput in a word or two for him. Yes, he is a splendid writer. Again and\nagain I assert that he writes magnificently. I do not agree with\nyou about his works, and never shall. He writes too ornately, too\nlaconically, with too great a wealth of imagery and imagination. Perhaps\nyou have read him without insight, Barbara? Or perhaps you were out of\nspirits at the time, or angry with Thedora about something, or worried\nabout some mischance? Ah, but you should read him sympathetically, and,\nbest of all, at a time when you are feeling happy and contented and\npleasantly disposed--for instance, when you have a bonbon or two in your\nmouth. Yes, that is the way to read Rataziaev. I do not dispute (indeed,\nwho would do so?) that better writers than he exist--even far better;\nbut they are good, and he is good too--they write well, and he writes\nwell. It is chiefly for his own sake that he writes, and he is to be\napproved for so doing.\n\nNow goodbye, dearest. More I cannot write, for I must hurry away to\nbusiness. Be of good cheer, and the Lord God watch over you!--Your\nfaithful friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\nP.S--Thank you so much for the book, darling! I will read it through,\nthis volume of Pushkin, and tonight come to you.\n\n\n\nMY DEAR MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH--No, no, my friend, I must not go on living\nnear you. I have been thinking the matter over, and come to the\nconclusion that I should be doing very wrong to refuse so good a post. I\nshould at least have an assured crust of bread; I might at least set to\nwork to earn my employers' favour, and even try to change my character\nif required to do so. Of course it is a sad and sorry thing to have to\nlive among strangers, and to be forced to seek their patronage, and to\nconceal and constrain one's own personality--but God will help me. I\nmust not remain forever a recluse, for similar chances have come my way\nbefore. I remember how, when a little girl at school, I used to go home\non Sundays and spend the time in frisking and dancing about. Sometimes\nmy mother would chide me for so doing, but I did not care, for my heart\nwas too joyous, and my spirits too buoyant, for that. Yet as the evening\nof Sunday came on, a sadness as of death would overtake me, for at nine\no'clock I had to return to school, where everything was cold and strange\nand severe--where the governesses, on Mondays, lost their tempers, and\nnipped my ears, and made me cry. On such occasions I would retire to a\ncorner and weep alone; concealing my tears lest I should be called lazy.\nYet it was not because I had to study that I used to weep, and in time I\ngrew more used to things, and, after my schooldays were over, shed tears\nonly when I was parting with friends....\n\nIt is not right for me to live in dependence upon you. The thought\ntortures me. I tell you this frankly, for the reason that frankness\nwith you has become a habit. Cannot I see that daily, at earliest dawn,\nThedora rises to do washing and scrubbing, and remains working at it\nuntil late at night, even though her poor old bones must be aching for\nwant of rest? Cannot I also see that YOU are ruining yourself for me,\nand hoarding your last kopeck that you may spend it on my behalf? You\nought not so to act, my friend, even though you write that you would\nrather sell your all than let me want for anything. I believe in you, my\nfriend--I entirely believe in your good heart; but, you say that to me\nnow (when, perhaps, you have received some unexpected sum or gratuity)\nand there is still the future to be thought of. You yourself know that I\nam always ailing--that I cannot work as you do, glad though I should be\nof any work if I could get it; so what else is there for me to do? To\nsit and repine as I watch you and Thedora? But how would that be of any\nuse to you? AM I necessary to you, comrade of mine? HAVE I ever done\nyou any good? Though I am bound to you with my whole soul, and love you\ndearly and strongly and wholeheartedly, a bitter fate has ordained that\nthat love should be all that I have to give--that I should be unable,\nby creating for you subsistence, to repay you for all your kindness. Do\nnot, therefore, detain me longer, but think the matter out, and give me\nyour opinion on it. In expectation of which I remain your sweetheart,\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1st.\n\nRubbish, rubbish, Barbara!--What you say is sheer rubbish. Stay here,\nrather, and put such thoughts out of your head. None of what you suppose\nis true. I can see for myself that it is not. Whatsoever you lack here,\nyou have but to ask me for it. Here you love and are loved, and we might\neasily be happy and contented together. What could you want more? What\nhave you to do with strangers? You cannot possibly know what strangers\nare like. I know it, though, and could have told you if you had asked\nme. There is a stranger whom I know, and whose bread I have eaten. He\nis a cruel man, Barbara--a man so bad that he would be unworthy of your\nlittle heart, and would soon tear it to pieces with his railings and\nreproaches and black looks. On the other hand, you are safe and well\nhere--you are as safe as though you were sheltered in a nest. Besides,\nyou would, as it were, leave me with my head gone. For what should I\nhave to do when you were gone? What could I, an old man, find to do? Are\nyou not necessary to me? Are you not useful to me? Eh? Surely you do not\nthink that you are not useful? You are of great use to me, Barbara, for\nyou exercise a beneficial influence upon my life. Even at this moment,\nas I think of you, I feel cheered, for always I can write letters to\nyou, and put into them what I am feeling, and receive from you detailed\nanswers.... I have bought you a wardrobe, and also procured you a\nbonnet; so you see that you have only to give me a commission for it to\nbe executed.... No--in what way are you not useful? What should I do\nif I were deserted in my old age? What would become of me? Perhaps you\nnever thought of that, Barbara--perhaps you never said to yourself, \"How\ncould HE get on without me?\" You see, I have grown so accustomed to you.\nWhat else would it end in, if you were to go away? Why, in my hiking to\nthe Neva's bank and doing away with myself. Ah, Barbara, darling, I\ncan see that you want me to be taken away to the Volkovo Cemetery in\na broken-down old hearse, with some poor outcast of the streets to\naccompany my coffin as chief mourner, and the gravediggers to heap my\nbody with clay, and depart and leave me there. How wrong of you, how\nwrong of you, my beloved! Yes, by heavens, how wrong of you! I am\nreturning you your book, little friend; and, if you were to ask of me\nmy opinion of it, I should say that never before in my life had I read\na book so splendid. I keep wondering how I have hitherto contrived to\nremain such an owl. For what have I ever done? From what wilds did\nI spring into existence? I KNOW nothing--I know simply NOTHING. My\nignorance is complete. Frankly, I am not an educated man, for until now\nI have read scarcely a single book--only \"A Portrait of Man\" (a clever\nenough work in its way), \"The Boy Who Could Play Many Tunes Upon Bells\",\nand \"Ivik's Storks\". That is all. But now I have also read \"The Station\nOverseer\" in your little volume; and it is wonderful to think that one\nmay live and yet be ignorant of the fact that under one's very nose\nthere may be a book in which one's whole life is described as in a\npicture. Never should I have guessed that, as soon as ever one begins to\nread such a book, it sets one on both to remember and to consider and to\nforetell events. Another reason why I liked this book so much is that,\nthough, in the case of other works (however clever they be), one may\nread them, yet remember not a word of them (for I am a man naturally\ndull of comprehension, and unable to read works of any great\nimportance),--although, as I say, one may read such works, one reads\nsuch a book as YOURS as easily as though it had been written by oneself,\nand had taken possession of one's heart, and turned it inside out for\ninspection, and were describing it in detail as a matter of perfect\nsimplicity. Why, I might almost have written the book myself! Why not,\nindeed? I can feel just as the people in the book do, and find myself\nin positions precisely similar to those of, say, the character Samson\nVirin. In fact, how many good-hearted wretches like Virin are there not\nwalking about amongst us? How easily, too, it is all described! I assure\nyou, my darling, that I almost shed tears when I read that Virin so took\nto drink as to lose his memory, become morose, and spend whole days over\nhis liquor; as also that he choked with grief and wept bitterly when,\nrubbing his eyes with his dirty hand, he bethought him of his wandering\nlamb, his daughter Dunasha! How natural, how natural! You should read\nthe book for yourself. The thing is actually alive. Even I can see that;\neven I can realise that it is a picture cut from the very life around\nme. In it I see our own Theresa (to go no further) and the poor\nTchinovnik--who is just such a man as this Samson Virin, except for\nhis surname of Gorshkov. The book describes just what might happen to\nourselves--to myself in particular. Even a count who lives in the Nevski\nProspect or in Naberezhnaia Street might have a similar experience,\nthough he might APPEAR to be different, owing to the fact that his life\nis cast on a higher plane. Yes, just the same things might happen to\nhim--just the same things.... Here you are wishing to go away and leave\nus; yet, be careful lest it would not be I who had to pay the penalty of\nyour doing so. For you might ruin both yourself and me. For the love of\nGod, put away these thoughts from you, my darling, and do not torture me\nin vain. How could you, my poor little unfledged nestling, find yourself\nfood, and defend yourself from misfortune, and ward off the wiles of\nevil men? Think better of it, Barbara, and pay no more heed to\nfoolish advice and calumny, but read your book again, and read it with\nattention. It may do you much good.\n\nI have spoken of Rataziaev's \"The Station Overseer\". However, the author\nhas told me that the work is old-fashioned, since, nowadays, books are\nissued with illustrations and embellishments of different sorts (though\nI could not make out all that he said). Pushkin he adjudges a splendid\npoet, and one who has done honour to Holy Russia. Read your book again,\nBarbara, and follow my advice, and make an old man happy. The Lord God\nHimself will reward you. Yes, He will surely reward you.--Your faithful\nfriend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Today Thedora came to me with fifteen\nroubles in silver. How glad was the poor woman when I gave her three of\nthem! I am writing to you in great haste, for I am busy cutting out a\nwaistcoat to send to you--buff, with a pattern of flowers. Also I\nam sending you a book of stories; some of which I have read myself,\nparticularly one called \"The Cloak.\" ... You invite me to go to the\ntheatre with you. But will it not cost too much? Of course we might sit\nin the gallery. It is a long time (indeed I cannot remember when I last\ndid so) since I visited a theatre! Yet I cannot help fearing that such\nan amusement is beyond our means. Thedora keeps nodding her head, and\nsaying that you have taken to living above your income. I myself divine\nthe same thing by the amount which you have spent upon me. Take care,\ndear friend, that misfortune does not come of it, for Thedora has also\ninformed me of certain rumours concerning your inability to meet your\nlandlady's bills. In fact, I am very anxious about you. Now, goodbye,\nfor I must hasten away to see about another matter--about the changing\nof the ribands on my bonnet.\n\nP.S.--Do you know, if we go to the theatre, I think that I shall wear my\nnew hat and black mantilla. Will that not look nice?\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 7th.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA--SO much for yesterday! Yes, dearest, we\nhave both been caught playing the fool, for I have become thoroughly\nbitten with the actress of whom I spoke. Last night I listened to her\nwith all my ears, although, strangely enough, it was practically my\nfirst sight of her, seeing that only once before had I been to the\ntheatre. In those days I lived cheek by jowl with a party of five young\nmen--a most noisy crew--and one night I accompanied them, willy-nilly,\nto the theatre, though I held myself decently aloof from their doings,\nand only assisted them for company's sake. How those fellows talked to\nme of this actress! Every night when the theatre was open, the entire\nband of them (they always seemed to possess the requisite money) would\nbetake themselves to that place of entertainment, where they ascended\nto the gallery, and clapped their hands, and repeatedly recalled the\nactress in question. In fact, they went simply mad over her. Even after\nwe had returned home they would give me no rest, but would go on\ntalking about her all night, and calling her their Glasha, and declaring\nthemselves to be in love with \"the canary-bird of their hearts.\" My\ndefenseless self, too, they would plague about the woman, for I was as\nyoung as they. What a figure I must have cut with them on the fourth\ntier of the gallery! Yet, I never got a sight of more than just a corner\nof the curtain, but had to content myself with listening. She had a\nfine, resounding, mellow voice like a nightingale's, and we all of us\nused to clap our hands loudly, and to shout at the top of our lungs. In\nshort, we came very near to being ejected. On the first occasion I went\nhome walking as in a mist, with a single rouble left in my pocket, and\nan interval of ten clear days confronting me before next pay-day. Yet,\nwhat think you, dearest? The very next day, before going to work, I\ncalled at a French perfumer's, and spent my whole remaining capital on\nsome eau-de-Cologne and scented soap! Why I did so I do not know. Nor\ndid I dine at home that day, but kept walking and walking past her\nwindows (she lived in a fourth-storey flat on the Nevski Prospect).\nAt length I returned to my own lodging, but only to rest a short hour\nbefore again setting off to the Nevski Prospect and resuming my vigil\nbefore her windows. For a month and a half I kept this up--dangling in\nher train. Sometimes I would hire cabs, and discharge them in view of\nher abode; until at length I had entirely ruined myself, and got into\ndebt. Then I fell out of love with her--I grew weary of the pursuit....\nYou see, therefore, to what depths an actress can reduce a decent man.\nIn those days I was young. Yes, in those days I was VERY young.\n\nM. D.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8th.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--The book which I received from you on\nthe 6th of this month I now hasten to return, while at the same time\nhastening also to explain matters to you in this accompanying letter.\nWhat a misfortune, my beloved, that you should have brought me to such a\npass! Our lots in life are apportioned by the Almighty according to our\nhuman deserts. To such a one He assigns a life in a general's epaulets\nor as a privy councillor--to such a one, I say, He assigns a life of\ncommand; whereas to another one, He allots only a life of unmurmuring\ntoil and suffering. These things are calculated according to a man's\nCAPACITY. One man may be capable of one thing, and another of another,\nand their several capacities are ordered by the Lord God himself. I\nhave now been thirty years in the public service, and have fulfilled my\nduties irreproachably, remained abstemious, and never been detected\nin any unbecoming behaviour. As a citizen, I may confess--I confess\nit freely--I have been guilty of certain shortcomings; yet those\nshortcomings have been combined with certain virtues. I am respected by\nmy superiors, and even his Excellency has had no fault to find with me;\nand though I have never been shown any special marks of favour, I know\nthat every one finds me at least satisfactory. Also, my writing is\nsufficiently legible and clear. Neither too rounded nor too fine, it\nis a running hand, yet always suitable. Of our staff only Ivan\nProkofievitch writes a similar hand. Thus have I lived till the grey\nhairs of my old age; yet I can think of no serious fault committed. Of\ncourse, no one is free from MINOR faults. Everyone has some of them, and\nyou among the rest, my beloved. But in grave or in audacious offences\nnever have I been detected, nor in infringements of regulations, nor in\nbreaches of the public peace. No, never! This you surely know, even as\nthe author of your book must have known it. Yes, he also must have\nknown it when he sat down to write. I had not expected this of you, my\nBarbara. I should never have expected it.\n\nWhat? In future I am not to go on living peacefully in my little corner,\npoor though that corner be I am not to go on living, as the proverb has\nit, without muddying the water, or hurting any one, or forgetting the\nfear of the Lord God and of oneself? I am not to see, forsooth, that\nno man does me an injury, or breaks into my home--I am not to take care\nthat all shall go well with me, or that I have clothes to wear, or that\nmy shoes do not require mending, or that I be given work to do, or\nthat I possess sufficient meat and drink? Is it nothing that, where\nthe pavement is rotten, I have to walk on tiptoe to save my boots? If I\nwrite to you overmuch concerning myself, is it concerning ANOTHER man,\nrather, that I ought to write--concerning HIS wants, concerning HIS\nlack of tea to drink (and all the world needs tea)? Has it ever been\nmy custom to pry into other men's mouths, to see what is being put into\nthem? Have I ever been known to offend any one in that respect? No, no,\nbeloved! Why should I desire to insult other folks when they are not\nmolesting ME? Let me give you an example of what I mean. A man may go on\nslaving and slaving in the public service, and earn the respect of his\nsuperiors (for what it is worth), and then, for no visible reason at\nall, find himself made a fool of. Of course he may break out now and\nthen (I am not now referring only to drunkenness), and (for example)\nbuy himself a new pair of shoes, and take pleasure in seeing his feet\nlooking well and smartly shod. Yes, I myself have known what it is\nto feel like that (I write this in good faith). Yet I am nonetheless\nastonished that Thedor Thedorovitch should neglect what is being said\nabout him, and take no steps to defend himself. True, he is only a\nsubordinate official, and sometimes loves to rate and scold; yet why\nshould he not do so--why should he not indulge in a little vituperation\nwhen he feels like it? Suppose it to be NECESSARY, for FORM'S sake,\nto scold, and to set everyone right, and to shower around abuse (for,\nbetween ourselves, Barbara, our friend cannot get on WITHOUT abuse--so\nmuch so that every one humours him, and does things behind his back)?\nWell, since officials differ in rank, and every official demands that\nhe shall be allowed to abuse his fellow officials in proportion to his\nrank, it follows that the TONE also of official abuse should become\ndivided into ranks, and thus accord with the natural order of things.\nAll the world is built upon the system that each one of us shall have to\nyield precedence to some other one, as well as to enjoy a certain power\nof abusing his fellows. Without such a provision the world could not\nget on at all, and simple chaos would ensue. Yet I am surprised that our\nThedor should continue to overlook insults of the kind that he endures.\n\nWhy do I do my official work at all? Why is that necessary? Will my\ndoing of it lead anyone who reads it to give me a greatcoat, or to buy\nme a new pair of shoes? No, Barbara. Men only read the documents, and\nthen require me to write more. Sometimes a man will hide himself away,\nand not show his face abroad, for the mere reason that, though he has\ndone nothing to be ashamed of, he dreads the gossip and slandering which\nare everywhere to be encountered. If his civic and family life have to\ndo with literature, everything will be printed and read and laughed\nover and discussed; until at length, he hardly dare show his face in\nthe street at all, seeing that he will have been described by report as\nrecognisable through his gait alone! Then, when he has amended his ways,\nand grown gentler (even though he still continues to be loaded with\nofficial work), he will come to be accounted a virtuous, decent citizen\nwho has deserved well of his comrades, rendered obedience to his\nsuperiors, wished noone any evil, preserved the fear of God in his\nheart, and died lamented. Yet would it not be better, instead of letting\nthe poor fellow die, to give him a cloak while yet he is ALIVE--to give\nit to this same Thedor Thedorovitch (that is to say, to myself)? Yes,\n'twere far better if, on hearing the tale of his subordinate's virtues,\nthe chief of the department were to call the deserving man into his\noffice, and then and there to promote him, and to grant him an increase\nof salary. Thus vice would be punished, virtue would prevail, and the\nstaff of that department would live in peace together. Here we have an\nexample from everyday, commonplace life. How, therefore, could you bring\nyourself to send me that book, my beloved? It is a badly conceived\nwork, Barbara, and also unreal, for the reason that in creation such\na Tchinovnik does not exist. No, again I protest against it, little\nBarbara; again I protest.--Your most humble, devoted servant,\n\nM. D.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 27th.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Your latest conduct and letters had\nfrightened me, and left me thunderstruck and plunged in doubt, until\nwhat you have said about Thedor explained the situation. Why despair\nand go into such frenzies, Makar Alexievitch? Your explanations only\npartially satisfy me. Perhaps I did wrong to insist upon accepting\na good situation when it was offered me, seeing that from my last\nexperience in that way I derived a shock which was anything but a matter\nfor jesting. You say also that your love for me has compelled you\nto hide yourself in retirement. Now, how much I am indebted to you I\nrealised when you told me that you were spending for my benefit the sum\nwhich you are always reported to have laid by at your bankers; but, now\nthat I have learned that you never possessed such a fund, but that, on\nhearing of my destitute plight, and being moved by it, you decided to\nspend upon me the whole of your salary--even to forestall it--and when I\nhad fallen ill, actually to sell your clothes--when I learned all this\nI found myself placed in the harassing position of not knowing how to\naccept it all, nor what to think of it. Ah, Makar Alexievitch! You ought\nto have stopped at your first acts of charity--acts inspired by sympathy\nand the love of kinsfolk, rather than have continued to squander your\nmeans upon what was unnecessary. Yes, you have betrayed our friendship,\nMakar Alexievitch, in that you have not been open with me; and, now that\nI see that your last coin has been spent upon dresses and bon-bons and\nexcursions and books and visits to the theatre for me, I weep bitter\ntears for my unpardonable improvidence in having accepted these things\nwithout giving so much as a thought to your welfare. Yes, all that you\nhave done to give me pleasure has become converted into a source of\ngrief, and left behind it only useless regret. Of late I have remarked\nthat you were looking depressed; and though I felt fearful that\nsomething unfortunate was impending, what has happened would otherwise\nnever have entered my head. To think that your better sense should so\nplay you false, Makar Alexievitch! What will people think of you, and\nsay of you? Who will want to know you? You whom, like everyone else, I\nhave valued for your goodness of heart and modesty and good sense--YOU,\nI say, have now given way to an unpleasant vice of which you seem never\nbefore to have been guilty. What were my feelings when Thedora informed\nme that you had been discovered drunk in the street, and taken home by\nthe police? Why, I felt petrified with astonishment--although, in view\nof the fact that you had failed me for four days, I had been expecting\nsome such extraordinary occurrence. Also, have you thought what your\nsuperiors will say of you when they come to learn the true reason of\nyour absence? You say that everyone is laughing at you, that every\none has learnED of the bond which exists between us, and that your\nneighbours habitually refer to me with a sneer. Pay no attention to\nthis, Makar Alexievitch; for the love of God, be comforted. Also, the\nincident between you and the officers has much alarmed me, although\nI had heard certain rumours concerning it. Pray explain to me what it\nmeans. You write, too, that you have been afraid to be open with me, for\nthe reason that your confessions might lose you my friendship. Also, you\nsay that you are in despair at the thought of being unable to help me in\nmy illness, owing to the fact that you have sold everything which might\nhave maintained me, and preserved me in sickness, as well as that you\nhave borrowed as much as it is possible for you to borrow, and are daily\nexperiencing unpleasantness with your landlady. Well, in failing to\nreveal all this to me you chose the worse course. Now, however, I know\nall. You have forced me to recognise that I have been the cause of your\nunhappy plight, as well as that my own conduct has brought upon myself\na twofold measure of sorrow. The fact leaves me thunderstruck, Makar\nAlexievitch. Ah, friend, an infectious disease is indeed a misfortune,\nfor now we poor and miserable folk must perforce keep apart from one\nanother, lest the infection be increased. Yes, I have brought upon you\ncalamities which never before in your humble, solitary life you had\nexperienced. This tortures and exhausts me more than I can tell to think\nof.\n\nWrite to me quite frankly. Tell me how you came to embark upon such\na course of conduct. Comfort, oh, comfort me if you can. It is not\nself-love that prompts me to speak of my own comforting, but my\nfriendship and love for you, which will never fade from my heart.\nGoodbye. I await your answer with impatience. You have thought but\npoorly of me, Makar Alexievitch.--Your friend and lover,\n\nBARBARA DOBROSELOVA.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 28th.\n\nMY PRICELESS BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--What am I to say to you, now that all\nis over, and we are gradually returning to our old position? You say\nthat you are anxious as to what will be thought of me. Let me tell you\nthat the dearest thing in life to me is my self-respect; wherefore, in\ninforming you of my misfortunes and misconduct, I would add that none\nof my superiors know of my doings, nor ever will know of them, and that\ntherefore, I still enjoy a measure of respect in that quarter. Only one\nthing do I fear--I fear gossip. Garrulous though my landlady be, she\nsaid but little when, with the aid of your ten roubles, I today paid her\npart of her account; and as for the rest of my companions, they do not\nmatter at all. So long as I have not borrowed money from them, I need\npay them no attention. To conclude my explanations, let me tell you\nthat I value your respect for me above everything in the world, and have\nfound it my greatest comfort during this temporary distress of mine.\nThank God, the first shock of things has abated, now that you have\nagreed not to look upon me as faithless and an egotist simply because I\nhave deceived you. I wish to hold you to myself, for the reason that I\ncannot bear to part with you, and love you as my guardian angel....\nI have now returned to work, and am applying myself diligently to my\nduties. Also, yesterday Evstafi Ivanovitch exchanged a word or two with\nme. Yet I will not conceal from you the fact that my debts are crushing\nme down, and that my wardrobe is in a sorry state. At the same time,\nthese things do not REALLY matter and I would bid you not despair about\nthem. Send me, however, another half-rouble if you can (though that\nhalf-rouble will stab me to the heart--stab me with the thought that it\nis not I who am helping you, but YOU who are helping ME). Thedora has\ndone well to get those fifteen roubles for you. At the moment, fool of\nan old man that I am, I have no hope of acquiring any more money; but as\nsoon as ever I do so, I will write to you and let you know all about it.\nWhat chiefly worries me is the fear of gossip. Goodbye, little angel. I\nkiss your hands, and beseech you to regain your health. If this is not\na detailed letter, the reason is that I must soon be starting for the\noffice, in order that, by strict application to duty, I may make amends\nfor the past. Further information concerning my doings (as well as\nconcerning that affair with the officers) must be deferred until\ntonight.--Your affectionate and respectful friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 28th.\n\nDEAREST LITTLE BARBARA,--It is YOU who have committed a fault--and one\nwhich must weigh heavily upon your conscience. Indeed, your last letter\nhas amazed and confounded me,--so much so that, on once more looking\ninto the recesses of my heart, I perceive that I was perfectly right\nin what I did. Of course I am not now referring to my debauch (no,\nindeed!), but to the fact that I love you, and to the fact that it is\nunwise of me to love you--very unwise. You know not how matters stand,\nmy darling. You know not why I am BOUND to love you. Otherwise you would\nnot say all that you do. Yet I am persuaded that it is your head rather\nthan your heart that is speaking. I am certain that your heart thinks\nvery differently.\n\nWhat occurred that night between myself and those officers I scarcely\nknow, I scarcely remember. You must bear in mind that for some time past\nI have been in terrible distress--that for a whole month I have been, so\nto speak, hanging by a single thread. Indeed, my position has been most\npitiable. Though I hid myself from you, my landlady was forever shouting\nand railing at me. This would not have mattered a jot--the horrible old\nwoman might have shouted as much as she pleased--had it not been that,\nin the first place, there was the disgrace of it, and, in the second\nplace, she had somehow learned of our connection, and kept proclaiming\nit to the household until I felt perfectly deafened, and had to stop my\nears. The point, however, is that other people did not stop their ears,\nbut, on the contrary, pricked them. Indeed, I am at a loss what to do.\n\nReally this wretched rabble has driven me to extremities. It all began\nwith my hearing a strange rumour from Thedora--namely, that an unworthy\nsuitor had been to visit you, and had insulted you with an improper\nproposal. That he had insulted you deeply I knew from my own feelings,\nfor I felt insulted in an equal degree. Upon that, my angel, I went to\npieces, and, losing all self-control, plunged headlong. Bursting into an\nunspeakable frenzy, I was at once going to call upon this villain of a\nseducer--though what to do next I knew not, seeing that I was fearful of\ngiving you offence. Ah, what a night of sorrow it was, and what a time\nof gloom, rain, and sleet! Next, I was returning home, but found myself\nunable to stand upon my feet. Then Emelia Ilyitch happened to come\nby. He also is a tchinovnik--or rather, was a tchinovnik, since he was\nturned out of the service some time ago. What he was doing there at that\nmoment I do not know; I only know that I went with him.... Surely it\ncannot give you pleasure to read of the misfortunes of your friend--of\nhis sorrows, and of the temptations which he experienced?... On the\nevening of the third day Emelia urged me to go and see the officer of\nwhom I have spoken, and whose address I had learned from our dvornik.\nMore strictly speaking, I had noticed him when, on a previous occasion,\nhe had come to play cards here, and I had followed him home. Of course\nI now see that I did wrong, but I felt beside myself when I heard\nthem telling him stories about me. Exactly what happened next I cannot\nremember. I only remember that several other officers were present as\nwell as he. Or it may be that I saw everything double--God alone knows.\nAlso, I cannot exactly remember what I said. I only remember that in my\nfury I said a great deal. Then they turned me out of the room, and threw\nme down the staircase--pushed me down it, that is to say. How I got home\nyou know. That is all. Of course, later I blamed myself, and my pride\nunderwent a fall; but no extraneous person except yourself knows of the\naffair, and in any case it does not matter. Perhaps the affair is as you\nimagine it to have been, Barbara? One thing I know for certain, and that\nis that last year one of our lodgers, Aksenti Osipovitch, took a similar\nliberty with Peter Petrovitch, yet kept the fact secret, an absolute\nsecret. He called him into his room (I happened to be looking through a\ncrack in the partition-wall), and had an explanation with him in the\nway that a gentleman should--noone except myself being a witness of the\nscene; whereas, in my own case, I had no explanation at all. After the\nscene was over, nothing further transpired between Aksenti Osipovitch\nand Peter Petrovitch, for the reason that the latter was so desirous of\ngetting on in life that he held his tongue. As a result, they bow and\nshake hands whenever they meet.... I will not dispute the fact that I\nhave erred most grievously--that I should never dare to dispute, or that\nI have fallen greatly in my own estimation; but, I think I was fated\nfrom birth so to do--and one cannot escape fate, my beloved. Here,\ntherefore, is a detailed explanation of my misfortunes and sorrows,\nwritten for you to read whenever you may find it convenient. I am far\nfrom well, beloved, and have lost all my gaiety of disposition, but I\nsend you this letter as a token of my love, devotion, and respect, Oh\ndear lady of my affections.--Your humble servant,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 29th.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--I have read your two letters, and they\nmake my heart ache. See here, dear friend of mine. You pass over certain\nthings in silence, and write about a PORTION only of your misfortunes.\nCan it be that the letters are the outcome of a mental disorder?... Come\nand see me, for God's sake. Come today, direct from the office, and dine\nwith us as you have done before. As to how you are living now, or as to\nwhat settlement you have made with your landlady, I know not, for you\nwrite nothing concerning those two points, and seem purposely to have\nleft them unmentioned. Au revoir, my friend. Come to me today without\nfail. You would do better ALWAYS to dine here. Thedora is an excellent\ncook. Goodbye--Your own,\n\nBARBARA DOBROSELOVA.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1st.\n\nMY DARLING BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--Thank God that He has sent you a chance\nof repaying my good with good. I believe in so doing, as well as in the\nsweetness of your angelic heart. Therefore, I will not reproach you.\nOnly I pray you, do not again blame me because in the decline of my life\nI have played the spendthrift. It was such a sin, was it not?--such a\nthing to do? And even if you would still have it that the sin was there,\nremember, little friend, what it costs me to hear such words fall from\nyour lips. Do not be vexed with me for saying this, for my heart is\nfainting. Poor people are subject to fancies--this is a provision of\nnature. I myself have had reason to know this. The poor man is exacting.\nHe cannot see God's world as it is, but eyes each passer-by askance, and\nlooks around him uneasily in order that he may listen to every word that\nis being uttered. May not people be talking of him? How is it that he\nis so unsightly? What is he feeling at all? What sort of figure is\nhe cutting on the one side or on the other? It is matter of common\nknowledge, my Barbara, that the poor man ranks lower than a rag, and\nwill never earn the respect of any one. Yes, write about him as you\nlike--let scribblers say what they choose about him--he will ever remain\nas he was. And why is this? It is because, from his very nature, the\npoor man has to wear his feelings on his sleeve, so that nothing about\nhim is sacred, and as for his self-respect--! Well, Emelia told me the\nother day that once, when he had to collect subscriptions, official\nsanction was demanded for every single coin, since people thought that\nit would be no use paying their money to a poor man. Nowadays charity\nis strangely administered. Perhaps it has always been so. Either folk do\nnot know how to administer it, or they are adept in the art--one of the\ntwo. Perhaps you did not know this, so I beg to tell it you. And how\ncomes it that the poor man knows, is so conscious of it all? The answer\nis--by experience. He knows because any day he may see a gentleman enter\na restaurant and ask himself, \"What shall I have to eat today? I will\nhave such and such a dish,\" while all the time the poor man will\nhave nothing to eat that day but gruel. There are men, too--wretched\nbusybodies--who walk about merely to see if they can find some wretched\ntchinovnik or broken-down official who has got toes projecting from his\nboots or his hair uncut! And when they have found such a one they make\na report of the circumstance, and their rubbish gets entered on the\nfile.... But what does it matter to you if my hair lacks the shears? If\nyou will forgive me what may seem to you a piece of rudeness, I declare\nthat the poor man is ashamed of such things with the sensitiveness of a\nyoung girl. YOU, for instance, would not care (pray pardon my bluntness)\nto unrobe yourself before the public eye; and in the same way, the poor\nman does not like to be pried at or questioned concerning his family\nrelations, and so forth. A man of honour and self-respect such as I\nam finds it painful and grievous to have to consort with men who would\ndeprive him of both.\n\nToday I sat before my colleagues like a bear's cub or a plucked sparrow,\nso that I fairly burned with shame. Yes, it hurt me terribly, Barbara.\nNaturally one blushes when one can see one's naked toes projecting\nthrough one's boots, and one's buttons hanging by a single thread!\nAs though on purpose, I seemed, on this occasion, to be peculiarly\ndishevelled. No wonder that my spirits fell. When I was talking on\nbusiness matters to Stepan Karlovitch, he suddenly exclaimed, for no\napparent reason, \"Ah, poor old Makar Alexievitch!\" and then left the\nrest unfinished. But I knew what he had in his mind, and blushed so\nhotly that even the bald patch on my head grew red. Of course the whole\nthing is nothing, but it worries me, and leads to anxious thoughts. What\ncan these fellows know about me? God send that they know nothing! But\nI confess that I suspect, I strongly suspect, one of my colleagues. Let\nthem only betray me! They would betray one's private life for a groat,\nfor they hold nothing sacred.\n\nI have an idea who is at the bottom of it all. It is Rataziaev. Probably\nhe knows someone in our department to whom he has recounted the\nstory with additions. Or perhaps he has spread it abroad in his own\ndepartment, and thence, it has crept and crawled into ours. Everyone\nhere knows it, down to the last detail, for I have seen them point at\nyou with their fingers through the window. Oh yes, I have seen them do\nit. Yesterday, when I stepped across to dine with you, the whole crew\nwere hanging out of the window to watch me, and the landlady exclaimed\nthat the devil was in young people, and called you certain unbecoming\nnames. But this is as nothing compared with Rataziaev's foul intention\nto place us in his books, and to describe us in a satire. He himself has\ndeclared that he is going to do so, and other people say the same.\nIn fact, I know not what to think, nor what to decide. It is no use\nconcealing the fact that you and I have sinned against the Lord God....\nYou were going to send me a book of some sort, to divert my mind--were\nyou not, dearest? What book, though, could now divert me? Only such\nbooks as have never existed on earth. Novels are rubbish, and written\nfor fools and for the idle. Believe me, dearest, I know it through long\nexperience. Even should they vaunt Shakespeare to you, I tell you that\nShakespeare is rubbish, and proper only for lampoons--Your own,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2nd.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Do not disquiet yourself. God will grant\nthat all shall turn out well. Thedora has obtained a quantity of work,\nboth for me and herself, and we are setting about it with a will.\nPerhaps it will put us straight again. Thedora suspects my late\nmisfortunes to be connected with Anna Thedorovna; but I do not care--I\nfeel extraordinarily cheerful today. So you are thinking of borrowing\nmore money? If so, may God preserve you, for you will assuredly be\nruined when the time comes for repayment! You had far better come and\nlive with us here for a little while. Yes, come and take up your abode\nhere, and pay no attention whatever to what your landlady says. As for\nthe rest of your enemies and ill-wishers, I am certain that it is with\nvain imaginings that you are vexing yourself.... In passing, let me tell\nyou that your style differs greatly from letter to letter. Goodbye until\nwe meet again. I await your coming with impatience--Your own,\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 3rd.\n\nMY ANGEL, BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I hasten to inform you, Oh light of my\nlife, that my hopes are rising again. But, little daughter of mine--do\nyou really mean it when you say that I am to indulge in no more\nborrowings? Why, I could not do without them. Things would go badly with\nus both if I did so. You are ailing. Consequently, I tell you roundly\nthat I MUST borrow, and that I must continue to do so.\n\nAlso, I may tell you that my seat in the office is now next to that of a\ncertain Emelia Ivanovitch. He is not the Emelia whom you know, but a\nman who, like myself, is a privy councillor, as well as represents, with\nmyself, the senior and oldest official in our department. Likewise he is\na good, disinterested soul, and one that is not over-talkative, though\na true bear in appearance and demeanour. Industrious, and possessed of\na handwriting purely English, his caligraphy is, it must be confessed,\neven worse than my own. Yes, he is a good soul. At the same time, we\nhave never been intimate with one another. We have done no more than\nexchange greetings on meeting or parting, borrow one another's penknife\nif we needed one, and, in short, observe such bare civilities as\nconvention demands. Well, today he said to me, \"Makar Alexievitch,\nwhat makes you look so thoughtful?\" and inasmuch as I could see that\nhe wished me well, I told him all--or, rather, I did not tell him\nEVERYTHING, for that I do to no man (I have not the heart to do it); I\ntold him just a few scattered details concerning my financial straits.\n\"Then you ought to borrow,\" said he. \"You ought to obtain a loan of\nPeter Petrovitch, who does a little in that way. I myself once borrowed\nsome money of him, and he charged me fair and light interest.\" Well,\nBarbara, my heart leapt within me at these words. I kept thinking and\nthinking,--if only God would put it into the mind of Peter Petrovitch\nto be my benefactor by advancing me a loan! I calculated that with its\naid I might both repay my landlady and assist yourself and get rid of my\nsurroundings (where I can hardly sit down to table without the rascals\nmaking jokes about me). Sometimes his Excellency passes our desk in\nthe office. He glances at me, and cannot but perceive how poorly I am\ndressed. Now, neatness and cleanliness are two of his strongest points.\nEven though he says nothing, I feel ready to die with shame when he\napproaches. Well, hardening my heart, and putting my diffidence into my\nragged pocket, I approached Peter Petrovitch, and halted before him more\ndead than alive. Yet I was hopeful, and though, as it turned out, he\nwas busily engaged in talking to Thedosei Ivanovitch, I walked up to him\nfrom behind, and plucked at his sleeve. He looked away from me, but I\nrecited my speech about thirty roubles, et cetera, et cetera, of which,\nat first, he failed to catch the meaning. Even when I had explained\nmatters to him more fully, he only burst out laughing, and said nothing.\nAgain I addressed to him my request; whereupon, asking me what security\nI could give, he again buried himself in his papers, and went on writing\nwithout deigning me even a second glance. Dismay seized me. \"Peter\nPetrovitch,\" I said, \"I can offer you no security,\" but to this I added\nan explanation that some salary would, in time, be due to me, which\nI would make over to him, and account the loan my first debt. At\nthat moment someone called him away, and I had to wait a little. On\nreturning, he began to mend his pen as though he had not even noticed\nthat I was there. But I was for myself this time. \"Peter Petrovitch,\" I\ncontinued, \"can you not do ANYTHING?\" Still he maintained silence, and\nseemed not to have heard me. I waited and waited. At length I determined\nto make a final attempt, and plucked him by the sleeve. He muttered\nsomething, and, his pen mended, set about his writing. There was nothing\nfor me to do but to depart. He and the rest of them are worthy fellows,\ndearest--that I do not doubt--but they are also proud, very proud. What\nhave I to do with them? Yet I thought I would write and tell you all\nabout it. Meanwhile Emelia Ivanovitch had been encouraging me with nods\nand smiles. He is a good soul, and has promised to recommend me to a\nfriend of his who lives in Viborskaia Street and lends money. Emelia\ndeclares that this friend will certainly lend me a little; so tomorrow,\nbeloved, I am going to call upon the gentleman in question.... What do\nyou think about it? It would be a pity not to obtain a loan. My landlady\nis on the point of turning me out of doors, and has refused to allow me\nany more board. Also, my boots are wearing through, and have lost every\nbutton--and I do not possess another pair! Could anyone in a government\noffice display greater shabbiness? It is dreadful, my Barbara--it is\nsimply dreadful!\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 4th.\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--For God's sake borrow some money as\nsoon as you can. I would not ask this help of you were it not for the\nsituation in which I am placed. Thedora and myself cannot remain any\nlonger in our present lodgings, for we have been subjected to great\nunpleasantness, and you cannot imagine my state of agitation and\ndismay. The reason is that this morning we received a visit from an\nelderly--almost an old--man whose breast was studded with orders.\nGreatly surprised, I asked him what he wanted (for at the moment Thedora\nhad gone out shopping); whereupon he began to question me as to my\nmode of life and occupation, and then, without waiting for an answer,\ninformed me that he was uncle to the officer of whom you have spoken;\nthat he was very angry with his nephew for the way in which the latter\nhad behaved, especially with regard to his slandering of me right and\nleft; and that he, the uncle, was ready to protect me from the young\nspendthrift's insolence. Also, he advised me to have nothing to say to\nyoung fellows of that stamp, and added that he sympathised with me as\nthough he were my own father, and would gladly help me in any way he\ncould. At this I blushed in some confusion, but did not greatly hasten\nto thank him. Next, he took me forcibly by the hand, and, tapping my\ncheek, said that I was very good-looking, and that he greatly liked the\ndimples in my face (God only knows what he meant!). Finally he tried to\nkiss me, on the plea that he was an old man, the brute! At this moment\nThedora returned; whereupon, in some confusion, he repeated that he felt\na great respect for my modesty and virtue, and that he much wished to\nbecome acquainted with me; after which he took Thedora aside, and tried,\non some pretext or another, to give her money (though of course she\ndeclined it). At last he took himself off--again reiterating his\nassurances, and saying that he intended to return with some earrings as\na present; that he advised me to change my lodgings; and, that he could\nrecommend me a splendid flat which he had in his mind's eye as likely to\ncost me nothing. Yes, he also declared that he greatly liked me for my\npurity and good sense; that I must beware of dissolute young men; and\nthat he knew Anna Thedorovna, who had charged him to inform me that she\nwould shortly be visiting me in person. Upon that, I understood all.\nWhat I did next I scarcely know, for I had never before found myself in\nsuch a position; but I believe that I broke all restraints, and made the\nold man feel thoroughly ashamed of himself--Thedora helping me in the\ntask, and well-nigh turning him neck and crop out of the tenement.\nNeither of us doubt that this is Anna Thedorovna's work--for how\notherwise could the old man have got to know about us?\n\nNow, therefore, Makar Alexievitch, I turn to you for help. Do not, for\nGod's sake, leave me in this plight. Borrow all the money that you can\nget, for I have not the wherewithal to leave these lodgings, yet cannot\npossibly remain in them any longer. At all events, this is Thedora's\nadvice. She and I need at least twenty-five roubles, which I will repay\nyou out of what I earn by my work, while Thedora shall get me additional\nwork from day to day, so that, if there be heavy interest to pay on the\nloan, you shall not be troubled with the extra burden. Nay, I will make\nover to you all that I possess if only you will continue to help me.\nTruly, I grieve to have to trouble you when you yourself are so hardly\nsituated, but my hopes rest upon you, and upon you alone. Goodbye, Makar\nAlexievitch. Think of me, and may God speed you on your errand!\n\nB.D.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 4th.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--These unlooked-for blows have shaken me\nterribly, and these strange calamities have quite broken my spirit.\nNot content with trying to bring you to a bed of sickness, these\nlickspittles and pestilent old men are trying to bring me to the same.\nAnd I assure you that they are succeeding--I assure you that they are.\nYet I would rather die than not help you. If I cannot help you I SHALL\ndie; but, to enable me to help you, you must flee like a bird out of the\nnest where these owls, these birds of prey, are seeking to peck you to\ndeath. How distressed I feel, my dearest! Yet how cruel you yourself\nare! Although you are enduring pain and insult, although you, little\nnestling, are in agony of spirit, you actually tell me that it grieves\nyou to disturb me, and that you will work off your debt to me with the\nlabour of your own hands! In other words, you, with your weak health,\nare proposing to kill yourself in order to relieve me to term of my\nfinancial embarrassments! Stop a moment, and think what you are saying.\nWHY should you sew, and work, and torture your poor head with anxiety,\nand spoil your beautiful eyes, and ruin your health? Why, indeed? Ah,\nlittle Barbara, little Barbara! Do you not see that I shall never be any\ngood to you, never any good to you? At all events, I myself see it. Yet\nI WILL help you in your distress. I WILL overcome every difficulty, I\nWILL get extra work to do, I WILL copy out manuscripts for authors,\nI WILL go to the latter and force them to employ me, I WILL so apply\nmyself to the work that they shall see that I am a good copyist (and\ngood copyists, I know, are always in demand). Thus there will be no need\nfor you to exhaust your strength, nor will I allow you to do so--I will\nnot have you carry out your disastrous intention... Yes, little angel,\nI will certainly borrow some money. I would rather die than not do\nso. Merely tell me, my own darling, that I am not to shrink from heavy\ninterest, and I will not shrink from it, I will not shrink from it--nay,\nI will shrink from nothing. I will ask for forty roubles, to begin with.\nThat will not be much, will it, little Barbara? Yet will any one trust\nme even with that sum at the first asking? Do you think that I am\ncapable of inspiring confidence at the first glance? Would the mere\nsight of my face lead any one to form of me a favourable opinion? Have I\never been able, remember you, to appear to anyone in a favourable light?\nWhat think you? Personally, I see difficulties in the way, and feel sick\nat heart at the mere prospect. However, of those forty roubles I mean\nto set aside twenty-five for yourself, two for my landlady, and the\nremainder for my own spending. Of course, I ought to give more than\ntwo to my landlady, but you must remember my necessities, and see for\nyourself that that is the most that can be assigned to her. We need say\nno more about it. For one rouble I shall buy me a new pair of shoes, for\nI scarcely know whether my old ones will take me to the office tomorrow\nmorning. Also, a new neck-scarf is indispensable, seeing that the old\none has now passed its first year; but, since you have promised to make\nof your old apron not only a scarf, but also a shirt-front, I need think\nno more of the article in question. So much for shoes and scarves. Next,\nfor buttons. You yourself will agree that I cannot do without buttons;\nnor is there on my garments a single hem unfrayed. I tremble when I\nthink that some day his Excellency may perceive my untidiness, and\nsay--well, what will he NOT say? Yet I shall never hear what he says,\nfor I shall have expired where I sit--expired of mere shame at the\nthought of having been thus exposed. Ah, dearest!... Well, my various\nnecessities will have left me three roubles to go on with. Part of\nthis sum I shall expend upon a half-pound of tobacco--for I cannot live\nwithout tobacco, and it is nine days since I last put a pipe into my\nmouth. To tell the truth, I shall buy the tobacco without acquainting\nyou with the fact, although I ought not so to do. The pity of it all is\nthat, while you are depriving yourself of everything, I keep solacing\nmyself with various amenities--which is why I am telling you this, that\nthe pangs of conscience may not torment me. Frankly, I confess that I\nam in desperate straits--in such straits as I have never yet known. My\nlandlady flouts me, and I enjoy the respect of noone; my arrears and\ndebts are terrible; and in the office, though never have I found the\nplace exactly a paradise, noone has a single word to say to me. Yet I\nhide, I carefully hide, this from every one. I would hide my person in\nthe same way, were it not that daily I have to attend the office where\nI have to be constantly on my guard against my fellows. Nevertheless,\nmerely to be able to CONFESS this to you renews my spiritual strength.\nWe must not think of these things, Barbara, lest the thought of them\nbreak our courage. I write them down merely to warn you NOT to think of\nthem, nor to torture yourself with bitter imaginings. Yet, my God, what\nis to become of us? Stay where you are until I can come to you; after\nwhich I shall not return hither, but simply disappear. Now I have\nfinished my letter, and must go and shave myself, inasmuch as, when that\nis done, one always feels more decent, as well as consorts more easily\nwith decency. God speed me! One prayer to Him, and I must be off.\n\nM. DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 5th.\n\nDEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--You must not despair. Away with melancholy!\nI am sending you thirty kopecks in silver, and regret that I cannot send\nyou more. Buy yourself what you most need until tomorrow. I myself have\nalmost nothing left, and what I am going to do I know not. Is it not\ndreadful, Makar Alexievitch? Yet do not be downcast--it is no good being\nthat. Thedora declares that it would not be a bad thing if we were to\nremain in this tenement, since if we left it suspicions would arise, and\nour enemies might take it into their heads to look for us. On the other\nhand, I do not think it would be well for us to remain here. If I were\nfeeling less sad I would tell you my reason.\n\nWhat a strange man you are, Makar Alexievitch! You take things so much\nto heart that you never know what it is to be happy. I read your letters\nattentively, and can see from them that, though you worry and disturb\nyourself about me, you never give a thought to yourself. Yes, every\nletter tells me that you have a kind heart; but I tell YOU that that\nheart is overly kind. So I will give you a little friendly advice, Makar\nAlexievitch. I am full of gratitude towards you--I am indeed full for\nall that you have done for me, I am most sensible of your goodness;\nbut, to think that I should be forced to see that, in spite of your own\ntroubles (of which I have been the involuntary cause), you live for me\nalone--you live but for MY joys and MY sorrows and MY affection! If you\ntake the affairs of another person so to heart, and suffer with her to\nsuch an extent, I do not wonder that you yourself are unhappy. Today,\nwhen you came to see me after office-work was done, I felt afraid even\nto raise my eyes to yours, for you looked so pale and desperate, and\nyour face had so fallen in. Yes, you were dreading to have to tell me\nof your failure to borrow money--you were dreading to have to grieve and\nalarm me; but, when you saw that I came very near to smiling, the load\nwas, I know, lifted from your heart. So do not be despondent, do not\ngive way, but allow more rein to your better sense. I beg and implore\nthis of you, for it will not be long before you see things take a turn\nfor the better. You will but spoil your life if you constantly lament\nanother person's sorrow. Goodbye, dear friend. I beseech you not to be\nover-anxious about me.\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 5th.\n\nMY DARLING LITTLE BARBARA,--This is well, this is well, my angel! So you\nare of opinion that the fact that I have failed to obtain any money does\nnot matter? Then I too am reassured, I too am happy on your account.\nAlso, I am delighted to think that you are not going to desert your old\nfriend, but intend to remain in your present lodgings. Indeed, my heart\nwas overcharged with joy when I read in your letter those kindly words\nabout myself, as well as a not wholly unmerited recognition of my\nsentiments. I say this not out of pride, but because now I know how much\nyou love me to be thus solicitous for my feelings. How good to\nthink that I may speak to you of them! You bid me, darling, not be\nfaint-hearted. Indeed, there is no need for me to be so. Think, for\ninstance, of the pair of shoes which I shall be wearing to the office\ntomorrow! The fact is that over-brooding proves the undoing of a\nman--his complete undoing. What has saved me is the fact that it is not\nfor myself that I am grieving, that I am suffering, but for YOU. Nor\nwould it matter to me in the least that I should have to walk through\nthe bitter cold without an overcoat or boots--I could bear it, I could\nwell endure it, for I am a simple man in my requirements; but the point\nis--what would people say, what would every envious and hostile tongue\nexclaim, when I was seen without an overcoat? It is for OTHER folk that\none wears an overcoat and boots. In any case, therefore, I should have\nneeded boots to maintain my name and reputation; to both of which my\nragged footgear would otherwise have spelled ruin. Yes, it is so,\nmy beloved, and you may believe an old man who has had many years of\nexperience, and knows both the world and mankind, rather than a set of\nscribblers and daubers.\n\nBut I have not yet told you in detail how things have gone with me\ntoday. During the morning I suffered as much agony of spirit as might\nhave been experienced in a year. 'Twas like this: First of all, I went\nout to call upon the gentleman of whom I have spoken. I started very\nearly, before going to the office. Rain and sleet were falling, and\nI hugged myself in my greatcoat as I walked along. \"Lord,\" thought I,\n\"pardon my offences, and send me fulfilment of all my desires;\" and as\nI passed a church I crossed myself, repented of my sins, and reminded\nmyself that I was unworthy to hold communication with the Lord God. Then\nI retired into myself, and tried to look at nothing; and so, walking\nwithout noticing the streets, I proceeded on my way. Everything had an\nempty air, and everyone whom I met looked careworn and preoccupied, and\nno wonder, for who would choose to walk abroad at such an early hour,\nand in such weather? Next a band of ragged workmen met me, and jostled\nme boorishly as they passed; upon which nervousness overtook me, and\nI felt uneasy, and tried hard not to think of the money that was\nmy errand. Near the Voskresenski Bridge my feet began to ache with\nweariness, until I could hardly pull myself along; until presently I met\nwith Ermolaev, a writer in our office, who, stepping aside, halted, and\nfollowed me with his eyes, as though to beg of me a glass of vodka. \"Ah,\nfriend,\" thought I, \"go YOU to your vodka, but what have I to do with\nsuch stuff?\" Then, sadly weary, I halted for a moment's rest, and\nthereafter dragged myself further on my way. Purposely I kept looking\nabout me for something upon which to fasten my thoughts, with which to\ndistract, to encourage myself; but there was nothing. Not a single idea\ncould I connect with any given object, while, in addition, my appearance\nwas so draggled that I felt utterly ashamed of it. At length I perceived\nfrom afar a gabled house that was built of yellow wood. This, I thought,\nmust be the residence of the Monsieur Markov whom Emelia Ivanovitch had\nmentioned to me as ready to lend money on interest. Half unconscious\nof what I was doing, I asked a watchman if he could tell me to whom the\nhouse belonged; whereupon grudgingly, and as though he were vexed at\nsomething, the fellow muttered that it belonged to one Markov. Are ALL\nwatchmen so unfeeling? Why did this one reply as he did? In any case I\nfelt disagreeably impressed, for like always answers to like, and, no\nmatter what position one is in, things invariably appear to correspond\nto it. Three times did I pass the house and walk the length of the\nstreet; until the further I walked, the worse became my state of mind.\n\"No, never, never will he lend me anything!\" I thought to myself, \"He\ndoes not know me, and my affairs will seem to him ridiculous, and I\nshall cut a sorry figure. However, let fate decide for me. Only, let\nHeaven send that I do not afterwards repent me, and eat out my heart\nwith remorse!\" Softly I opened the wicket-gate. Horrors! A great ragged\nbrute of a watch-dog came flying out at me, and foaming at the mouth,\nand nearly jumping out his skin! Curious is it to note what little,\ntrivial incidents will nearly make a man crazy, and strike terror to his\nheart, and annihilate the firm purpose with which he has armed himself.\nAt all events, I approached the house more dead than alive, and walked\nstraight into another catastrophe. That is to say, not noticing the\nslipperiness of the threshold, I stumbled against an old woman who\nwas filling milk-jugs from a pail, and sent the milk flying in every\ndirection! The foolish old dame gave a start and a cry, and then\ndemanded of me whither I had been coming, and what it was I wanted;\nafter which she rated me soundly for my awkwardness. Always have I found\nsomething of the kind befall me when engaged on errands of this nature.\nIt seems to be my destiny invariably to run into something. Upon that,\nthe noise and the commotion brought out the mistress of the house--an\nold beldame of mean appearance. I addressed myself directly to her:\n\"Does Monsieur Markov live here?\" was my inquiry. \"No,\" she replied, and\nthen stood looking at me civilly enough. \"But what want you with him?\"\nshe continued; upon which I told her about Emelia Ivanovitch and\nthe rest of the business. As soon as I had finished, she called her\ndaughter--a barefooted girl in her teens--and told her to summon her\nfather from upstairs. Meanwhile, I was shown into a room which contained\nseveral portraits of generals on the walls and was furnished with a\nsofa, a large table, and a few pots of mignonette and balsam. \"Shall I,\nor shall I not (come weal, come woe) take myself off?\" was my thought as\nI waited there. Ah, how I longed to run away! \"Yes,\" I continued, \"I had\nbetter come again tomorrow, for the weather may then be better, and I\nshall not have upset the milk, and these generals will not be looking at\nme so fiercely.\" In fact, I had actually begun to move towards the door\nwhen Monsieur Markov entered--a grey-headed man with thievish eyes, and\nclad in a dirty dressing-gown fastened with a belt. Greetings over, I\nstumbled out something about Emelia Ivanovitch and forty roubles, and\nthen came to a dead halt, for his eyes told me that my errand had been\nfutile. \"No.\" said he, \"I have no money. Moreover, what security\ncould you offer?\" I admitted that I could offer none, but again added\nsomething about Emelia, as well as about my pressing needs. Markov heard\nme out, and then repeated that he had no money. \"Ah,\" thought I, \"I\nmight have known this--I might have foreseen it!\" And, to tell the\ntruth, Barbara, I could have wished that the earth had opened under my\nfeet, so chilled did I feel as he said what he did, so numbed did my\nlegs grow as shivers began to run down my back. Thus I remained gazing\nat him while he returned my gaze with a look which said, \"Well now,\nmy friend? Why do you not go since you have no further business to do\nhere?\" Somehow I felt conscience-stricken. \"How is it that you are in\nsuch need of money?\" was what he appeared to be asking; whereupon, I\nopened my mouth (anything rather than stand there to no purpose at all!)\nbut found that he was not even listening. \"I have no money,\" again he\nsaid, \"or I would lend you some with pleasure.\" Several times I repeated\nthat I myself possessed a little, and that I would repay any loan\nfrom him punctually, most punctually, and that he might charge me what\ninterest he liked, since I would meet it without fail. Yes, at that\nmoment I remembered our misfortunes, our necessities, and I remembered\nyour half-rouble. \"No,\" said he, \"I can lend you nothing without\nsecurity,\" and clinched his assurance with an oath, the robber!\n\nHow I contrived to leave the house and, passing through Viborskaia\nStreet, to reach the Voskresenski Bridge I do not know. I only remember\nthat I felt terribly weary, cold, and starved, and that it was ten\no'clock before I reached the office. Arriving, I tried to clean myself\nup a little, but Sniegirev, the porter, said that it was impossible for\nme to do so, and that I should only spoil the brush, which belonged to\nthe Government. Thus, my darling, do such fellows rate me lower than\nthe mat on which they wipe their boots! What is it that will most\nsurely break me? It is not the want of money, but the LITTLE worries\nof life--these whisperings and nods and jeers. Any day his Excellency\nhimself may round upon me. Ah, dearest, my golden days are gone. Today I\nhave spent in reading your letters through; and the reading of them has\nmade me sad. Goodbye, my own, and may the Lord watch over you!\n\nM. DIEVUSHKIN.\n\nP.S.--To conceal my sorrow I would have written this letter half\njestingly; but, the faculty of jesting has not been given me. My one\ndesire, however, is to afford you pleasure. Soon I will come and see\nyou, dearest. Without fail I will come and see you.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 11th.\n\nO Barbara Alexievna, I am undone--we are both of us undone! Both of\nus are lost beyond recall! Everything is ruined--my reputation, my\nself-respect, all that I have in the world! And you as much as I. Never\nshall we retrieve what we have lost. I--I have brought you to this pass,\nfor I have become an outcast, my darling. Everywhere I am laughed at\nand despised. Even my landlady has taken to abusing me. Today she\noverwhelmed me with shrill reproaches, and abased me to the level of a\nhearth-brush. And last night, when I was in Rataziaev's rooms, one of\nhis friends began to read a scribbled note which I had written to\nyou, and then inadvertently pulled out of my pocket. Oh beloved, what\nlaughter there arose at the recital! How those scoundrels mocked and\nderided you and myself! I walked up to them and accused Rataziaev of\nbreaking faith. I said that he had played the traitor. But he only\nreplied that I had been the betrayer in the case, by indulging in\nvarious amours. \"You have kept them very dark though, Mr. Lovelace!\"\nsaid he--and now I am known everywhere by this name of \"Lovelace.\" They\nknow EVERYTHING about us, my darling, EVERYTHING--both about you and\nyour affairs and about myself; and when today I was for sending Phaldoni\nto the bakeshop for something or other, he refused to go, saying that\nit was not his business. \"But you MUST go,\" said I. \"I will not,\" he\nreplied. \"You have not paid my mistress what you owe her, so I am not\nbound to run your errands.\" At such an insult from a raw peasant I lost\nmy temper, and called him a fool; to which he retorted in a similar\nvein. Upon this I thought that he must be drunk, and told him so;\nwhereupon he replied: \"WHAT say you that I am? Suppose you yourself go\nand sober up, for I know that the other day you went to visit a woman,\nand that you got drunk with her on two grivenniks.\" To such a pass have\nthings come! I feel ashamed to be seen alive. I am, as it were, a man\nproclaimed; I am in a worse plight even than a tramp who has lost his\npassport. How misfortunes are heaping themselves upon me! I am lost--I\nam lost for ever!\n\nM. D.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 13th.\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--It is true that misfortune is following\nupon misfortune. I myself scarcely know what to do. Yet, no matter how\nyou may be fairing, you must not look for help from me, for only today I\nburned my left hand with the iron! At one and the same moment I dropped\nthe iron, made a mistake in my work, and burned myself! So now I can no\nlonger work. Also, these three days past, Thedora has been ailing.\nMy anxiety is becoming positively torturous. Nevertheless, I send you\nthirty kopecks--almost the last coins that I have left to me, much as I\nshould have liked to have helped you more when you are so much in need.\nI feel vexed to the point of weeping. Goodbye, dear friend of mine. You\nwill bring me much comfort if only you will come and see me today.\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 14th.\n\nWhat is the matter with you, Makar Alexievitch? Surely you cannot\nfear the Lord God as you ought to do? You are not only driving me to\ndistraction but also ruining yourself with this eternal solicitude for\nyour reputation. You are a man of honour, nobility of character, and\nself-respect, as everyone knows; yet, at any moment, you are ready to\ndie with shame! Surely you should have more consideration for your grey\nhairs. No, the fear of God has departed from you. Thedora has told you\nthat it is out of my power to render you anymore help. See, therefore,\nto what a pass you have brought me! Probably you think it is nothing to\nme that you should behave so badly; probably you do not realise what you\nhave made me suffer. I dare not set foot on the staircase here, for if\nI do so I am stared at, and pointed at, and spoken about in the most\nhorrible manner. Yes, it is even said of me that I am \"united to a\ndrunkard.\" What a thing to hear! And whenever you are brought home drunk\nfolk say, \"They are carrying in that tchinovnik.\" THAT is not the proper\nway to make me help you. I swear that I MUST leave this place, and go\nand get work as a cook or a laundress. It is impossible for me to stay\nhere. Long ago I wrote and asked you to come and see me, yet you have\nnot come. Truly my tears and prayers must mean NOTHING to you, Makar\nAlexievitch! Whence, too, did you get the money for your debauchery? For\nthe love of God be more careful of yourself, or you will be ruined. How\nshameful, how abominable of you! So the landlady would not admit you\nlast night, and you spent the night on the doorstep? Oh, I know all\nabout it. Yet if only you could have seen my agony when I heard the\nnews!... Come and see me, Makar Alexievitch, and we will once more be\nhappy together. Yes, we will read together, and talk of old times, and\nThedora shall tell you of her pilgrimages in former days. For God's sake\nbeloved, do not ruin both yourself and me. I live for you alone; it\nis for your sake alone that I am still here. Be your better self once\nmore--the self which still can remain firm in the face of misfortune.\nPoverty is no crime; always remember that. After all, why should we\ndespair? Our present difficulties will pass away, and God will right\nus. Only be brave. I send you two grivenniks for the purchase of some\ntobacco or anything else that you need; but, for the love of heaven, do\nnot spend the money foolishly. Come you and see me soon; come without\nfail. Perhaps you may be ashamed to meet me, as you were before, but you\nNEED not feel like that--such shame would be misplaced. Only do bring\nwith you sincere repentance and trust in God, who orders all things for\nthe best.\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 19th.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,-Yes, I AM ashamed to meet you, my\ndarling--I AM ashamed. At the same time, what is there in all this? Why\nshould we not be cheerful again? Why should I mind the soles of my feet\ncoming through my boots? The sole of one's foot is a mere bagatelle--it\nwill never be anything but just a base, dirty sole. And shoes do not\nmatter, either. The Greek sages used to walk about without them, so why\nshould we coddle ourselves with such things? Yet why, also, should I\nbe insulted and despised because of them? Tell Thedora that she is a\nrubbishy, tiresome, gabbling old woman, as well as an inexpressibly\nfoolish one. As for my grey hairs, you are quite wrong about them,\ninasmuch as I am not such an old man as you think. Emelia sends you\nhis greeting. You write that you are in great distress, and have been\nweeping. Well, I too am in great distress, and have been weeping. Nay,\nnay. I wish you the best of health and happiness, even as I am well and\nhappy myself, so long as I may remain, my darling,--Your friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nAugust 21st.\n\nMY DEAR AND KIND BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I feel that I am guilty, I feel\nthat I have sinned against you. Yet also I feel, from what you say, that\nit is no use for me so to feel. Even before I had sinned I felt as I do\nnow; but I gave way to despair, and the more so as recognised my fault.\nDarling, I am not cruel or hardhearted. To rend your little soul would\nbe the act of a blood-thirsty tiger, whereas I have the heart of a\nsheep. You yourself know that I am not addicted to bloodthirstiness,\nand therefore that I cannot really be guilty of the fault in question,\nseeing that neither my mind nor my heart have participated in it.\n\nNor can I understand wherein the guilt lies. To me it is all a mystery.\nWhen you sent me those thirty kopecks, and thereafter those two\ngrivenniks, my heart sank within me as I looked at the poor little\nmoney. To think that though you had burned your hand, and would soon be\nhungry, you could write to me that I was to buy tobacco! What was I to\ndo? Remorselessly to rob you, an orphan, as any brigand might do? I\nfelt greatly depressed, dearest. That is to say, persuaded that I should\nnever do any good with my life, and that I was inferior even to the\nsole of my own boot, I took it into my head that it was absurd for me to\naspire at all--rather, that I ought to account myself a disgrace and an\nabomination. Once a man has lost his self-respect, and has decided to\nabjure his better qualities and human dignity, he falls headlong, and\ncannot choose but do so. It is decreed of fate, and therefore I am not\nguilty in this respect.\n\nThat evening I went out merely to get a breath of fresh air, but one\nthing followed another--the weather was cold, all nature was looking\nmournful, and I had fallen in with Emelia. This man had spent everything\nthat he possessed, and, at the time I met him, had not for two days\ntasted a crust of bread. He had tried to raise money by pawning,\nbut what articles he had for the purpose had been refused by the\npawnbrokers. It was more from sympathy for a fellow-man than from any\nliking for the individual that I yielded. That is how the fault arose,\ndearest.\n\nHe spoke of you, and I mingled my tears with his. Yes, he is a man\nof kind, kind heart--a man of deep feeling. I often feel as he did,\ndearest, and, in addition, I know how beholden to you I am. As soon as\never I got to know you I began both to realise myself and to love you;\nfor until you came into my life I had been a lonely man--I had been, as\nit were, asleep rather than alive. In former days my rascally colleagues\nused to tell me that I was unfit even to be seen; in fact, they so\ndisliked me that at length I began to dislike myself, for, being\nfrequently told that I was stupid, I began to believe that I really was\nso. But the instant that YOU came into my life, you lightened the dark\nplaces in it, you lightened both my heart and my soul. Gradually, I\ngained rest of spirit, until I had come to see that I was no worse\nthan other men, and that, though I had neither style nor brilliancy nor\npolish, I was still a MAN as regards my thoughts and feelings. But now,\nalas! pursued and scorned of fate, I have again allowed myself to abjure\nmy own dignity. Oppressed of misfortune, I have lost my courage. Here is\nmy confession to you, dearest. With tears I beseech you not to inquire\nfurther into the matter, for my heart is breaking, and life has grown\nindeed hard and bitter for me--Beloved, I offer you my respect, and\nremain ever your faithful friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 3rd.\n\nThe reason why I did not finish my last letter, Makar Alexievitch, was\nthat I found it so difficult to write. There are moments when I am glad\nto be alone--to grieve and repine without any one to share my sorrow:\nand those moments are beginning to come upon me with ever-increasing\nfrequency. Always in my reminiscences I find something which is\ninexplicable, yet strongly attractive--so much so that for hours together\nI remain insensible to my surroundings, oblivious of reality. Indeed,\nin my present life there is not a single impression that I\nencounter--pleasant or the reverse--which does not recall to my mind\nsomething of a similar nature in the past. More particularly is this the\ncase with regard to my childhood, my golden childhood. Yet such moments\nalways leave me depressed. They render me weak, and exhaust my powers of\nfancy; with the result that my health, already not good, grows steadily\nworse.\n\nHowever, this morning it is a fine, fresh, cloudless day, such as we\nseldom get in autumn. The air has revived me and I greet it with joy.\nYet to think that already the fall of the year has come! How I used\nto love the country in autumn! Then but a child, I was yet a sensitive\nbeing who loved autumn evenings better than autumn mornings. I remember\nhow beside our house, at the foot of a hill, there lay a large pond, and\nhow the pond--I can see it even now!--shone with a broad, level surface\nthat was as clear as crystal. On still evenings this pond would be at\nrest, and not a rustle would disturb the trees which grew on its banks\nand overhung the motionless expanse of water. How fresh it used to seem,\nyet how cold! The dew would be falling upon the turf, lights would be\nbeginning to shine forth from the huts on the pond's margin, and the\ncattle would be wending their way home. Then quietly I would slip out\nof the house to look at my beloved pond, and forget myself in\ncontemplation. Here and there a fisherman's bundle of brushwood would be\nburning at the water's edge, and sending its light far and wide over\nthe surface. Above, the sky would be of a cold blue colour, save for a\nfringe of flame-coloured streaks on the horizon that kept turning ever\npaler and paler; and when the moon had come out there would be wafted\nthrough the limpid air the sounds of a frightened bird fluttering, of a\nbulrush rubbing against its fellows in the gentle breeze, and of a fish\nrising with a splash. Over the dark water there would gather a thin,\ntransparent mist; and though, in the distance, night would be looming,\nand seemingly enveloping the entire horizon, everything closer at hand\nwould be standing out as though shaped with a chisel--banks, boats,\nlittle islands, and all. Beside the margin a derelict barrel would be\nturning over and over in the water; a switch of laburnum, with yellowing\nleaves, would go meandering through the reeds; and a belated gull\nwould flutter up, dive again into the cold depths, rise once more, and\ndisappear into the mist. How I would watch and listen to these things!\nHow strangely good they all would seem! But I was a mere infant in those\ndays--a mere child.\n\nYes, truly I loved autumn-tide--the late autumn when the crops are\ngarnered, and field work is ended, and the evening gatherings in the\nhuts have begun, and everyone is awaiting winter. Then does everything\nbecome more mysterious, the sky frowns with clouds, yellow leaves strew\nthe paths at the edge of the naked forest, and the forest itself turns\nblack and blue--more especially at eventide when damp fog is spreading\nand the trees glimmer in the depths like giants, like formless, weird\nphantoms. Perhaps one may be out late, and had got separated from one's\ncompanions. Oh horrors! Suddenly one starts and trembles as one seems to\nsee a strange-looking being peering from out of the darkness of a hollow\ntree, while all the while the wind is moaning and rattling and howling\nthrough the forest--moaning with a hungry sound as it strips the leaves\nfrom the bare boughs, and whirls them into the air. High over the\ntree-tops, in a widespread, trailing, noisy crew, there fly, with\nresounding cries, flocks of birds which seem to darken and overlay the\nvery heavens. Then a strange feeling comes over one, until one seems to\nhear the voice of some one whispering: \"Run, run, little child! Do not\nbe out late, for this place will soon have become dreadful! Run, little\nchild! Run!\" And at the words terror will possess one's soul, and one\nwill rush and rush until one's breath is spent--until, panting, one has\nreached home.\n\nAt home, however, all will look bright and bustling as we children are\nset to shell peas or poppies, and the damp twigs crackle in the stove,\nand our mother comes to look fondly at our work, and our old nurse,\nIliana, tells us stories of bygone days, or terrible legends concerning\nwizards and dead men. At the recital we little ones will press closer\nto one another, yet smile as we do so; when suddenly, everyone becomes\nsilent. Surely somebody has knocked at the door?... But nay, nay; it\nis only the sound of Frolovna's spinning-wheel. What shouts of laughter\narise! Later one will be unable to sleep for fear of the strange dreams\nwhich come to visit one; or, if one falls asleep, one will soon wake\nagain, and, afraid to stir, lie quaking under the coverlet until dawn.\nAnd in the morning, one will arise as fresh as a lark and look at the\nwindow, and see the fields overlaid with hoarfrost, and fine icicles\nhanging from the naked branches, and the pond covered over with ice\nas thin as paper, and a white steam rising from the surface, and birds\nflying overhead with cheerful cries. Next, as the sun rises, he throws\nhis glittering beams everywhere, and melts the thin, glassy ice until\nthe whole scene has come to look bright and clear and exhilarating; and\nas the fire begins to crackle again in the stove, we sit down to the\ntea-urn, while, chilled with the night cold, our black dog, Polkan, will\nlook in at us through the window, and wag his tail with a cheerful air.\nPresently, a peasant will pass the window in his cart bound for\nthe forest to cut firewood, and the whole party will feel merry and\ncontented together. Abundant grain lies stored in the byres, and\ngreat stacks of wheat are glowing comfortably in the morning sunlight.\nEveryone is quiet and happy, for God has blessed us with a bounteous\nharvest, and we know that there will be abundance of food for the\nwintertide. Yes, the peasant may rest assured that his family will not\nwant for aught. Song and dance will arise at night from the village\ngirls, and on festival days everyone will repair to God's house to thank\nHim with grateful tears for what He has done.... Ah, a golden time was\nmy time of childhood!...\n\nCarried away by these memories, I could weep like a child. Everything,\neverything comes back so clearly to my recollection! The past stands out\nso vividly before me! Yet in the present everything looks dim and dark!\nHow will it all end?--how? Do you know, I have a feeling, a sort of\nsure premonition, that I am going to die this coming autumn; for I feel\nterribly, oh so terribly ill! Often do I think of death, yet feel that\nI should not like to die here and be laid to rest in the soil of St.\nPetersburg. Once more I have had to take to my bed, as I did last\nspring, for I have never really recovered. Indeed I feel so depressed!\nThedora has gone out for the day, and I am alone. For a long while past\nI have been afraid to be left by myself, for I keep fancying that there\nis someone else in the room, and that that someone is speaking to me.\nEspecially do I fancy this when I have gone off into a reverie, and then\nsuddenly awoken from it, and am feeling bewildered. That is why I have\nmade this letter such a long one; for, when I am writing, the mood\npasses away. Goodbye. I have neither time nor paper left for more, and\nmust close. Of the money which I saved to buy a new dress and hat, there\nremains but a single rouble; but, I am glad that you have been able to\npay your landlady two roubles, for they will keep her tongue quiet for a\ntime. And you must repair your wardrobe.\n\nGoodbye once more. I am so tired! Nor can I think why I am growing so\nweak--why it is that even the smallest task now wearies me? Even if work\nshould come my way, how am I to do it? That is what worries me above all\nthings.\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 5th.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA,--Today I have undergone a variety of experiences. In\nthe first place, my head has been aching, and towards evening I went out\nto get a breath of fresh air along the Fontanka Canal. The weather was\ndull and damp, and even by six o'clock, darkness had begun to set in.\nTrue, rain was not actually falling, but only a mist like rain, while\nthe sky was streaked with masses of trailing cloud. Crowds of people\nwere hurrying along Naberezhnaia Street, with faces that looked strange\nand dejected. There were drunken peasants; snub-nosed old harridans in\nslippers; bareheaded artisans; cab drivers; every species of beggar;\nboys; a locksmith's apprentice in a striped smock, with lean, emaciated\nfeatures which seemed to have been washed in rancid oil; an ex-soldier\nwho was offering penknives and copper rings for sale; and so on, and\nso on. It was the hour when one would expect to meet no other folk than\nthese. And what a quantity of boats there were on the canal. It made\none wonder how they could all find room there. On every bridge were\nold women selling damp gingerbread or withered apples, and every woman\nlooked as damp and dirty as her wares. In short, the Fontanka is a\nsaddening spot for a walk, for there is wet granite under one's feet,\nand tall, dingy buildings on either side of one, and wet mist below and\nwet mist above. Yes, all was dark and gloomy there this evening.\n\nBy the time I had returned to Gorokhovaia Street darkness had fallen\nand the lamps had been lit. However, I did not linger long in that\nparticular spot, for Gorokhovaia Street is too noisy a place. But\nwhat sumptuous shops and stores it contains! Everything sparkles and\nglitters, and the windows are full of nothing but bright colours and\nmaterials and hats of different shapes. One might think that they were\ndecked merely for display; but no,--people buy these things, and give\nthem to their wives! Yes, it IS a sumptuous place. Hordes of German\nhucksters are there, as well as quite respectable traders. And the\nquantities of carriages which pass along the street! One marvels that\nthe pavement can support so many splendid vehicles, with windows like\ncrystal, linings made of silk and velvet, and lacqueys dressed in\nepaulets and wearing swords! Into some of them I glanced, and saw that\nthey contained ladies of various ages. Perhaps they were princesses and\ncountesses! Probably at that hour such folk would be hastening to balls\nand other gatherings. In fact, it was interesting to be able to look so\nclosely at a princess or a great lady. They were all very fine. At\nall events, I had never before seen such persons as I beheld in those\ncarriages....\n\nThen I thought of you. Ah, my own, my darling, it is often that I think\nof you and feel my heart sink. How is it that YOU are so unfortunate,\nBarbara? How is it that YOU are so much worse off than other people? In\nmy eyes you are kind-hearted, beautiful, and clever--why, then, has\nsuch an evil fate fallen to your lot? How comes it that you are left\ndesolate--you, so good a human being! While to others happiness comes\nwithout an invitation at all? Yes, I know--I know it well--that I ought\nnot to say it, for to do so savours of free-thought; but why should that\nraven, Fate, croak out upon the fortunes of one person while she is yet\nin her mother's womb, while another person it permits to go forth in\nhappiness from the home which has reared her? To even an idiot of\nan Ivanushka such happiness is sometimes granted. \"You, you fool\nIvanushka,\" says Fate, \"shall succeed to your grandfather's money-bags,\nand eat, drink, and be merry; whereas YOU (such and such another one)\nshall do no more than lick the dish, since that is all that you are\ngood for.\" Yes, I know that it is wrong to hold such opinions, but\ninvoluntarily the sin of so doing grows upon one's soul. Nevertheless,\nit is you, my darling, who ought to be riding in one of those carriages.\nGenerals would have come seeking your favour, and, instead of being\nclad in a humble cotton dress, you would have been walking in silken\nand golden attire. Then you would not have been thin and wan as now,\nbut fresh and plump and rosy-cheeked as a figure on a sugar-cake. Then\nshould I too have been happy--happy if only I could look at your lighted\nwindows from the street, and watch your shadow--happy if only I could\nthink that you were well and happy, my sweet little bird! Yet how are\nthings in reality? Not only have evil folk brought you to ruin, but\nthere comes also an old rascal of a libertine to insult you! Just\nbecause he struts about in a frockcoat, and can ogle you through a\ngold-mounted lorgnette, the brute thinks that everything will fall into\nhis hands--that you are bound to listen to his insulting condescension!\nOut upon him! But why is this? It is because you are an orphan, it is\nbecause you are unprotected, it is because you have no powerful friend\nto afford you the decent support which is your due. WHAT do such facts\nmatter to a man or to men to whom the insulting of an orphan is an\noffence allowed? Such fellows are not men at all, but mere vermin, no\nmatter what they think themselves to be. Of that I am certain. Why,\nan organ-grinder whom I met in Gorokhovaia Street would inspire more\nrespect than they do, for at least he walks about all day, and suffers\nhunger--at least he looks for a stray, superfluous groat to earn him\nsubsistence, and is, therefore, a true gentleman, in that he supports\nhimself. To beg alms he would be ashamed; and, moreover, he works for\nthe benefit of mankind just as does a factory machine. \"So far as in me\nlies,\" says he, \"I will give you pleasure.\" True, he is a pauper, and\nnothing but a pauper; but, at least he is an HONOURABLE pauper. Though\ntired and hungry, he still goes on working--working in his own peculiar\nfashion, yet still doing honest labour. Yes, many a decent fellow whose\nlabour may be disproportionate to its utility pulls the forelock to no\none, and begs his bread of no one. I myself resemble that organ-grinder.\nThat is to say, though not exactly he, I resemble him in this respect,\nthat I work according to my capabilities, and so far as in me lies. More\ncould be asked of no one; nor ought I to be adjudged to do more.\n\nApropos of the organ-grinder, I may tell you, dearest, that today\nI experienced a double misfortune. As I was looking at the grinder,\ncertain thoughts entered my head and I stood wrapped in a reverie. Some\ncabmen also had halted at the spot, as well as a young girl, with a\nyet smaller girl who was dressed in rags and tatters. These people had\nhalted there to listen to the organ-grinder, who was playing in front\nof some one's windows. Next, I caught sight of a little urchin of about\nten--a boy who would have been good-looking but for the fact that his\nface was pinched and sickly. Almost barefooted, and clad only in a\nshirt, he was standing agape to listen to the music--a pitiful childish\nfigure. Nearer to the grinder a few more urchins were dancing, but\nin the case of this lad his hands and feet looked numbed, and he kept\nbiting the end of his sleeve and shivering. Also, I noticed that in his\nhands he had a paper of some sort. Presently a gentleman came by, and\ntossed the grinder a small coin, which fell straight into a box adorned\nwith a representation of a Frenchman and some ladies. The instant he\nheard the rattle of the coin, the boy started, looked timidly round, and\nevidently made up his mind that I had thrown the money; whereupon, he\nran to me with his little hands all shaking, and said in a tremulous\nvoice as he proffered me his paper: \"Pl-please sign this.\" I turned over\nthe paper, and saw that there was written on it what is usual under\nsuch circumstances. \"Kind friends I am a sick mother with three hungry\nchildren. Pray help me. Though soon I shall be dead, yet, if you will\nnot forget my little ones in this world, neither will I forget you in\nthe world that is to come.\" The thing seemed clear enough; it was a\nmatter of life and death. Yet what was I to give the lad? Well, I gave\nhim nothing. But my heart ached for him. I am certain that, shivering\nwith cold though he was, and perhaps hungry, the poor lad was not lying.\nNo, no, he was not lying.\n\nThe shameful point is that so many mothers take no care of their\nchildren, but send them out, half-clad, into the cold. Perhaps this\nlad's mother also was a feckless old woman, and devoid of character? Or\nperhaps she had no one to work for her, but was forced to sit with her\nlegs crossed--a veritable invalid? Or perhaps she was just an old rogue\nwho was in the habit of sending out pinched and hungry boys to deceive\nthe public? What would such a boy learn from begging letters? His heart\nwould soon be rendered callous, for, as he ran about begging, people\nwould pass him by and give him nothing. Yes, their hearts would be as\nstone, and their replies rough and harsh. \"Away with you!\" they would\nsay. \"You are seeking but to trick us.\" He would hear that from every\none, and his heart would grow hard, and he would shiver in vain with the\ncold, like some poor little fledgling that has fallen out of the\nnest. His hands and feet would be freezing, and his breath coming with\ndifficulty; until, look you, he would begin to cough, and disease, like\nan unclean parasite, would worm its way into his breast until death\nitself had overtaken him--overtaken him in some foetid corner whence\nthere was no chance of escape. Yes, that is what his life would become.\n\nThere are many such cases. Ah, Barbara, it is hard to hear \"For Christ's\nsake!\" and yet pass the suppliant by and give nothing, or say merely:\n\"May the Lord give unto you!\" Of course, SOME supplications mean\nnothing (for supplications differ greatly in character). Occasionally\nsupplications are long, drawn-out and drawling, stereotyped and\nmechanical--they are purely begging supplications. Requests of this kind\nit is less hard to refuse, for they are purely professional and of long\nstanding. \"The beggar is overdoing it,\" one thinks to oneself. \"He knows\nthe trick too well.\" But there are other supplications which voice a\nstrange, hoarse, unaccustomed note, like that today when I took the poor\nboy's paper. He had been standing by the kerbstone without speaking to\nanybody--save that at last to myself he said, \"For the love of Christ\ngive me a groat!\" in a voice so hoarse and broken that I started, and\nfelt a queer sensation in my heart, although I did not give him a groat.\nIndeed, I had not a groat on me. Rich folk dislike hearing poor people\ncomplain of their poverty. \"They disturb us,\" they say, \"and are\nimpertinent as well. Why should poverty be so impertinent? Why should\nits hungry moans prevent us from sleeping?\"\n\nTo tell you the truth, my darling, I have written the foregoing not\nmerely to relieve my feelings, but, also, still more, to give you an\nexample of the excellent style in which I can write. You yourself will\nrecognise that my style was formed long ago, but of late such fits of\ndespondency have seized upon me that my style has begun to correspond\nto my feelings; and though I know that such correspondence gains one\nlittle, it at least renders one a certain justice. For not unfrequently\nit happens that, for some reason or another, one feels abased, and\ninclined to value oneself at nothing, and to account oneself lower than\na dishclout; but this merely arises from the fact that at the time one\nis feeling harassed and depressed, like the poor boy who today asked of\nme alms. Let me tell you an allegory, dearest, and do you hearken to it.\nOften, as I hasten to the office in the morning, I look around me at\nthe city--I watch it awaking, getting out of bed, lighting its fires,\ncooking its breakfast, and becoming vocal; and at the sight, I begin to\nfeel smaller, as though some one had dealt me a rap on my inquisitive\nnose. Yes, at such times I slink along with a sense of utter humiliation\nin my heart. For one would have but to see what is passing within those\ngreat, black, grimy houses of the capital, and to penetrate within\ntheir walls, for one at once to realise what good reason there is for\nself-depredation and heart-searching. Of course, you will note that I am\nspeaking figuratively rather than literally.\n\nLet us look at what is passing within those houses. In some dingy\ncorner, perhaps, in some damp kennel which is supposed to be a room, an\nartisan has just awakened from sleep. All night he has dreamt--IF such\nan insignificant fellow is capable of dreaming?--about the shoes which\nlast night he mechanically cut out. He is a master-shoemaker, you see,\nand therefore able to think of nothing but his one subject of interest.\nNearby are some squalling children and a hungry wife. Nor is he the\nonly man that has to greet the day in this fashion. Indeed, the incident\nwould be nothing--it would not be worth writing about, save for another\ncircumstance. In that same house ANOTHER person--a person of great\nwealth-may also have been dreaming of shoes; but, of shoes of a\nvery different pattern and fashion (in a manner of speaking, if you\nunderstand my metaphor, we are all of us shoemakers). This, again, would\nbe nothing, were it not that the rich person has no one to whisper in\nhis ear: \"Why dost thou think of such things? Why dost thou think of\nthyself alone, and live only for thyself--thou who art not a shoemaker?\nTHY children are not ailing. THY wife is not hungry. Look around thee.\nCan'st thou not find a subject more fitting for thy thoughts than thy\nshoes?\" That is what I want to say to you in allegorical language,\nBarbara. Maybe it savours a little of free-thought, dearest; but, such\nideas WILL keep arising in my mind and finding utterance in impetuous\nspeech. Why, therefore, should one not value oneself at a groat as one\nlistens in fear and trembling to the roar and turmoil of the city? Maybe\nyou think that I am exaggerating things--that this is a mere whim of\nmine, or that I am quoting from a book? No, no, Barbara. You may rest\nassured that it is not so. Exaggeration I abhor, with whims I have\nnothing to do, and of quotation I am guiltless.\n\nI arrived home today in a melancholy mood. Sitting down to the table, I\nhad warmed myself some tea, and was about to drink a second glass of it,\nwhen there entered Gorshkov, the poor lodger. Already, this morning,\nI had noticed that he was hovering around the other lodgers, and also\nseeming to want to speak to myself. In passing I may say that his\ncircumstances are infinitely worse than my own; for, only think of it,\nhe has a wife and children! Indeed, if I were he, I do not know what\nI should do. Well, he entered my room, and bowed to me with the pus\nstanding, as usual, in drops on his eyelashes, his feet shuffling about,\nand his tongue unable, at first, to articulate a word. I motioned him to\na chair (it was a dilapidated enough one, but I had no other), and asked\nhim to have a glass of tea. To this he demurred--for quite a long time\nhe demurred, but at length he accepted the offer. Next, he was for\ndrinking the tea without sugar, and renewed his excuses, but upon\nthe sugar I insisted. After long resistance and many refusals, he DID\nconsent to take some, but only the smallest possible lump; after which,\nhe assured me that his tea was perfectly sweet. To what depths of\nhumility can poverty reduce a man! \"Well, what is it, my good sir?\" I\ninquired of him; whereupon he replied: \"It is this, Makar Alexievitch.\nYou have once before been my benefactor. Pray again show me the charity\nof God, and assist my unfortunate family. My wife and children have\nnothing to eat. To think that a father should have to say this!\" I was\nabout to speak again when he interrupted me. \"You see,\" he continued,\n\"I am afraid of the other lodgers here. That is to say, I am not so much\nafraid of, as ashamed to address them, for they are a proud, conceited\nlot of men. Nor would I have troubled even you, my friend and former\nbenefactor, were it not that I know that you yourself have experienced\nmisfortune and are in debt; wherefore, I have ventured to come and make\nthis request of you, in that I know you not only to be kind-hearted, but\nalso to be in need, and for that reason the more likely to sympathise\nwith me in my distress.\" To this he added an apology for his awkwardness\nand presumption. I replied that, glad though I should have been to\nserve him, I had nothing, absolutely nothing, at my disposal. \"Ah, Makar\nAlexievitch,\" he went on, \"surely it is not much that I am asking of\nyou? My-my wife and children are starving. C-could you not afford me\njust a grivennik?\" At that my heart contracted, \"How these people put me\nto shame!\" thought I. But I had only twenty kopecks left, and upon them\nI had been counting for meeting my most pressing requirements. \"No, good\nsir, I cannot,\" said I. \"Well, what you will,\" he persisted. \"Perhaps\nten kopecks?\" Well I got out my cash-box, and gave him the twenty. It\nwas a good deed. To think that such poverty should exist! Then I had\nsome further talk with him. \"How is it,\" I asked him, \"that, though you\nare in such straits, you have hired a room at five roubles?\" He replied\nthat though, when he engaged the room six months ago, he paid three\nmonths' rent in advance, his affairs had subsequently turned out badly,\nand never righted themselves since. You see, Barbara, he was sued at\nlaw by a merchant who had defrauded the Treasury in the matter of a\ncontract. When the fraud was discovered the merchant was prosecuted, but\nthe transactions in which he had engaged involved Gorshkov, although\nthe latter had been guilty only of negligence, want of prudence, and\nculpable indifference to the Treasury's interests. True, the affair had\ntaken place some years ago, but various obstacles had since combined\nto thwart Gorshkov. \"Of the disgrace put upon me,\" said he to me, \"I am\ninnocent. True, I to a certain extent disobeyed orders, but never did\nI commit theft or embezzlement.\" Nevertheless the affair lost him\nhis character. He was dismissed the service, and though not adjudged\ncapitally guilty, has been unable since to recover from the merchant a\nlarge sum of money which is his by right, as spared to him (Gorshkov)\nby the legal tribunal. True, the tribunal in question did not altogether\nbelieve in Gorshkov, but I do so. The matter is of a nature so complex\nand crooked that probably a hundred years would be insufficient to\nunravel it; and, though it has now to a certain extent been cleared up,\nthe merchant still holds the key to the situation. Personally I side\nwith Gorshkov, and am very sorry for him. Though lacking a post of any\nkind, he still refuses to despair, though his resources are completely\nexhausted. Yes, it is a tangled affair, and meanwhile he must live, for,\nunfortunately, another child which has been born to him has entailed\nupon the family fresh expenses. Also, another of his children recently\nfell ill and died--which meant yet further expense. Lastly, not only is\nhis wife in bad health, but he himself is suffering from a complaint of\nlong standing. In short, he has had a very great deal to undergo. Yet he\ndeclares that daily he expects a favourable issue to his affair--that he\nhas no doubt of it whatever. I am terribly sorry for him, and said what\nI could to give him comfort, for he is a man who has been much bullied\nand misled. He had come to me for protection from his troubles, so I did\nmy best to soothe him. Now, goodbye, my darling. May Christ watch over\nyou and preserve your health. Dearest one, even to think of you is like\nmedicine to my ailing soul. Though I suffer for you, I at least suffer\ngladly.--Your true friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 9th.\n\nMY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I am beside myself as I take up my pen,\nfor a most terrible thing has happened. My head is whirling round. Ah,\nbeloved, how am I to tell you about it all? I had never foreseen what\nhas happened. But no--I cannot say that I had NEVER foreseen it, for my\nmind DID get an inkling of what was coming, through my seeing something\nvery similar to it in a dream.\n\nI will tell you the whole story--simply, and as God may put it into my\nheart. Today I went to the office as usual, and, upon arrival, sat down\nto write. You must know that I had been engaged on the same sort of\nwork yesterday, and that, while executing it, I had been approached by\nTimothei Ivanovitch with an urgent request for a particular document.\n\"Makar Alexievitch,\" he had said, \"pray copy this out for me. Copy it\nas quickly and as carefully as you can, for it will require to be signed\ntoday.\" Also let me tell you, dearest, that yesterday I had not been\nfeeling myself, nor able to look at anything. I had been troubled with\ngrave depression--my breast had felt chilled, and my head clouded. All\nthe while I had been thinking of you, my darling. Well, I set to work\nupon the copying, and executed it cleanly and well, except for the\nfact that, whether the devil confused my mind, or a mysterious fate so\nordained, or the occurrence was simply bound to happen, I left out a\nwhole line of the document, and thus made nonsense of it! The work had\nbeen given me too late for signature last night, so it went before his\nExcellency this morning. I reached the office at my usual hour, and sat\ndown beside Emelia Ivanovitch. Here I may remark that for a long time\npast I have been feeling twice as shy and diffident as I used to do; I\nhave been finding it impossible to look people in the face. Let only\na chair creak, and I become more dead than alive. Today, therefore, I\ncrept humbly to my seat and sat down in such a crouching posture that\nEfim Akimovitch (the most touchy man in the world) said to me sotto\nvoce: \"What on earth makes you sit like that, Makar Alexievitch?\" Then\nhe pulled such a grimace that everyone near us rocked with laughter at\nmy expense. I stopped my ears, frowned, and sat without moving, for I\nfound this the best method of putting a stop to such merriment. All at\nonce I heard a bustle and a commotion and the sound of someone running\ntowards us. Did my ears deceive me? It was I who was being summoned in\nperemptory tones! My heart started to tremble within me, though I could\nnot say why. I only know that never in my life before had it trembled\nas it did then. Still I clung to my chair--and at that moment was hardly\nmyself at all. The voices were coming nearer and nearer, until they were\nshouting in my ear: \"Dievushkin! Dievushkin! Where is Dievushkin?\" Then\nat length I raised my eyes, and saw before me Evstafi Ivanovitch. He\nsaid to me: \"Makar Alexievitch, go at once to his Excellency. You have\nmade a mistake in a document.\" That was all, but it was enough, was\nit not? I felt dead and cold as ice--I felt absolutely deprived of the\npower of sensation; but, I rose from my seat and went whither I had\nbeen bidden. Through one room, through two rooms, through three rooms I\npassed, until I was conducted into his Excellency's cabinet itself. Of\nmy thoughts at that moment I can give no exact account. I merely saw his\nExcellency standing before me, with a knot of people around him. I have\nan idea that I did not salute him--that I forgot to do so. Indeed,\nso panic-stricken was I, that my teeth were chattering and my knees\nknocking together. In the first place, I was greatly ashamed of my\nappearance (a glance into a mirror on the right had frightened me with\nthe reflection of myself that it presented), and, in the second place, I\nhad always been accustomed to comport myself as though no such person\nas I existed. Probably his Excellency had never before known that I was\neven alive. Of course, he might have heard, in passing, that there was\na man named Dievushkin in his department; but never for a moment had he\nhad any intercourse with me.\n\nHe began angrily: \"What is this you have done, sir? Why are you not\nmore careful? The document was wanted in a hurry, and you have gone\nand spoiled it. What do you think of it?\"--the last being addressed\nto Evstafi Ivanovitch. More I did not hear, except for some flying\nexclamations of \"What negligence and carelessness! How awkward this is!\"\nand so on. I opened my mouth to say something or other; I tried to\nbeg pardon, but could not. To attempt to leave the room, I had not\nthe hardihood. Then there happened something the recollection of which\ncauses the pen to tremble in my hand with shame. A button of mine--the\ndevil take it!--a button of mine that was hanging by a single thread\nsuddenly broke off, and hopped and skipped and rattled and rolled until\nit had reached the feet of his Excellency himself--this amid a profound\ngeneral silence! THAT was what came of my intended self-justification\nand plea for mercy! THAT was the only answer that I had to return to my\nchief!\n\nThe sequel I shudder to relate. At once his Excellency's attention\nbecame drawn to my figure and costume. I remembered what I had seen\nin the mirror, and hastened to pursue the button. Obstinacy of a sort\nseized upon me, and I did my best to arrest the thing, but it slipped\naway, and kept turning over and over, so that I could not grasp it, and\nmade a sad spectacle of myself with my awkwardness. Then there came over\nme a feeling that my last remaining strength was about to leave me, and\nthat all, all was lost--reputation, manhood, everything! In both ears I\nseemed to hear the voices of Theresa and Phaldoni. At length, however, I\ngrasped the button, and, raising and straightening myself, stood humbly\nwith clasped hands--looking a veritable fool! But no. First of all I\ntried to attach the button to the ragged threads, and smiled each time\nthat it broke away from them, and smiled again. In the beginning his\nExcellency had turned away, but now he threw me another glance, and I\nheard him say to Evstafi Ivanovitch: \"What on earth is the matter with\nthe fellow? Look at the figure he cuts! Who to God is he?\" Ah, beloved,\nonly to hear that, \"Who to God is he?\" Truly I had made myself a marked\nman! In reply to his Excellency Evstafi murmured: \"He is no one of any\nnote, though his character is good. Besides, his salary is sufficient as\nthe scale goes.\" \"Very well, then; but help him out of his difficulties\nsomehow,\" said his Excellency. \"Give him a trifle of salary in advance.\"\n\"It is all forestalled,\" was the reply. \"He drew it some time ago. But\nhis record is good. There is nothing against him.\" At this I felt as\nthough I were in Hell fire. I could actually have died! \"Well, well,\"\nsaid his Excellency, \"let him copy out the document a second time.\nDievushkin, come here. You are to make another copy of this paper, and\nto make it as quickly as possible.\" With that he turned to some\nother officials present, issued to them a few orders, and the company\ndispersed. No sooner had they done so than his Excellency hurriedly\npulled out a pocket-book, took thence a note for a hundred roubles, and,\nwith the words, \"Take this. It is as much as I can afford. Treat it as\nyou like,\" placed the money in my hand! At this, dearest, I started\nand trembled, for I was moved to my very soul. What next I did I hardly\nknow, except that I know that I seized his Excellency by the hand.\nBut he only grew very red, and then--no, I am not departing by a\nhair's-breadth from the truth--it is true--that he took this unworthy\nhand in his, and shook it! Yes, he took this hand of mine in his, and\nshook it, as though I had been his equal, as though I had been a general\nlike himself! \"Go now,\" he said. \"This is all that I can do for you.\nMake no further mistakes, and I will overlook your fault.\"\n\nWhat I think about it is this: I beg of you and of Thedora, and had\nI any children I should beg of them also, to pray ever to God for his\nExcellency. I should say to my children: \"For your father you need not\npray; but for his Excellency, I bid you pray until your lives shall\nend.\" Yes, dear one--I tell you this in all solemnity, so hearken well\nunto my words--that though, during these cruel days of our adversity,\nI have nearly died of distress of soul at the sight of you and your\npoverty, as well as at the sight of myself and my abasement and\nhelplessness, I yet care less for the hundred roubles which his\nExcellency has given me than for the fact that he was good enough to\ntake the hand of a wretched drunkard in his own and press it. By that\nact he restored me to myself. By that act he revived my courage, he made\nlife forever sweet to me.... Yes, sure am I that, sinner though I be\nbefore the Almighty, my prayers for the happiness and prosperity of his\nExcellency will yet ascend to the Heavenly Throne!...\n\nBut, my darling, for the moment I am terribly agitated and distraught.\nMy heart is beating as though it would burst my breast, and all my body\nseems weak.... I send you forty-five roubles in notes. Another twenty\nI shall give to my landlady, and the remaining thirty-five I shall\nkeep--twenty for new clothes and fifteen for actual living expenses. But\nthese experiences of the morning have shaken me to the core, and I\nmust rest awhile. It is quiet, very quiet, here. My breath is coming in\njerks--deep down in my breast I can hear it sobbing and trembling....\nI will come and see you soon, but at the moment my head is aching with\nthese various sensations. God sees all things, my darling, my priceless\ntreasure!--Your steadfast friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 10th.\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--I am unspeakably rejoiced at your good\nfortune, and fully appreciate the kindness of your superior. Now, take\na rest from your cares. Only do not AGAIN spend money to no advantage.\nLive as quietly and as frugally as possible, and from today begin always\nto set aside something, lest misfortune again overtake you. Do not, for\nGod's sake, worry yourself--Thedora and I will get on somehow. Why have\nyou sent me so much money? I really do not need it--what I had already\nwould have been quite sufficient. True, I shall soon be needing further\nfunds if I am to leave these lodgings, but Thedora is hoping before long\nto receive repayment of an old debt. Of course, at least TWENTY roubles\nwill have to be set aside for indispensable requirements, but the\nremainder shall be returned to you. Pray take care of it, Makar\nAlexievitch. Now, goodbye. May your life continue peacefully, and may\nyou preserve your health and spirits. I would have written to you at\ngreater length had I not felt so terribly weary. Yesterday I never left\nmy bed. I am glad that you have promised to come and see me. Yes, you\nMUST pay me a visit.\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 11th.\n\nMY DARLING BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I implore you not to leave me now that\nI am once more happy and contented. Disregard what Thedora says, and I\nwill do anything in the world for you. I will behave myself better, even\nif only out of respect for his Excellency, and guard my every action.\nOnce more we will exchange cheerful letters with one another, and make\nmutual confidence of our thoughts and joys and sorrows (if so be that\nwe shall know any more sorrows?). Yes, we will live twice as happily\nand comfortably as of old. Also, we will exchange books.... Angel of my\nheart, a great change has taken place in my fortunes--a change very much\nfor the better. My landlady has become more accommodating; Theresa has\nrecovered her senses; even Phaldoni springs to do my bidding. Likewise,\nI have made my peace with Rataziaev. He came to see me of his own\naccord, the moment that he heard the glad tidings. There can be no doubt\nthat he is a good fellow, that there is no truth in the slanders that\none hears of him. For one thing, I have discovered that he never had\nany intention of putting me and yourself into a book. This he told me\nhimself, and then read to me his latest work. As for his calling me\n\"Lovelace,\" he had intended no rudeness or indecency thereby. The term\nis merely one of foreign derivation, meaning a clever fellow, or, in\nmore literary and elegant language, a gentleman with whom one must\nreckon. That is all; it was a mere harmless jest, my beloved. Only\nignorance made me lose my temper, and I have expressed to him my\nregret.... How beautiful is the weather today, my little Barbara! True,\nthere was a slight frost in the early morning, as though scattered\nthrough a sieve, but it was nothing, and the breeze soon freshened the\nair. I went out to buy some shoes, and obtained a splendid pair. Then,\nafter a stroll along the Nevski Prospect, I read \"The Daily Bee\". This\nreminds me that I have forgotten to tell you the most important thing of\nall. It happened like this:\n\nThis morning I had a talk with Emelia Ivanovitch and Aksenti\nMichaelovitch concerning his Excellency. Apparently, I am not the only\nperson to whom he has acted kindly and been charitable, for he is known\nto the whole world for his goodness of heart. In many quarters his\npraises are to be heard; in many quarters he has called forth tears\nof gratitude. Among other things, he undertook the care of an orphaned\ngirl, and married her to an official, the son of a poor widow, and found\nthis man place in a certain chancellory, and in other ways benefited\nhim. Well, dearest, I considered it to be my duty to add my mite by\npublishing abroad the story of his Excellency's gracious treatment of\nmyself. Accordingly, I related the whole occurrence to my interlocutors,\nand concealed not a single detail. In fact, I put my pride into my\npocket--though why should I feel ashamed of having been elated by such\nan occurrence? \"Let it only be noised afield,\" said I to myself, and it\nwill resound greatly to his Excellency's credit.--So I expressed myself\nenthusiastically on the subject and never faltered. On the contrary,\nI felt proud to have such a story to tell. I referred to every one\nconcerned (except to yourself, of course, dearest)--to my landlady, to\nPhaldoni, to Rataziaev, to Markov. I even mentioned the matter of my\nshoes! Some of those standing by laughed--in fact every one present did\nso, but probably it was my own figure or the incident of my shoes--more\nparticularly the latter--that excited merriment, for I am sure it was\nnot meant ill-naturedly. My hearers may have been young men, or well\noff; certainly they cannot have been laughing with evil intent at what\nI had said. Anything against his Excellency CANNOT have been in their\nthoughts. Eh, Barbara?\n\nEven now I cannot wholly collect my faculties, so upset am I by recent\nevents.... Have you any fuel to go on with, Barbara? You must not expose\nyourself to cold. Also, you have depressed my spirits with your fears\nfor the future. Daily I pray to God on your behalf. Ah, HOW I pray\nto Him!... Likewise, have you any woollen stockings to wear, and warm\nclothes generally? Mind you, if there is anything you need, you must\nnot hurt an old man's feelings by failing to apply to him for what you\nrequire. The bad times are gone now, and the future is looking bright\nand fair.\n\nBut what bad times they were, Barbara, even though they be gone, and\ncan no longer matter! As the years pass on we shall gradually recover\nourselves. How clearly I remember my youth! In those days I never had\na kopeck to spare. Yet, cold and hungry though I was, I was always\nlight-hearted. In the morning I would walk the Nevski Prospect, and meet\nnice-looking people, and be happy all day. Yes, it was a glorious, a\nglorious time! It was good to be alive, especially in St. Petersburg.\nYet it is but yesterday that I was beseeching God with tears to pardon\nme my sins during the late sorrowful period--to pardon me my murmurings\nand evil thoughts and gambling and drunkenness. And you I remembered in\nmy prayers, for you alone have encouraged and comforted me, you alone\nhave given me advice and instruction. I shall never forget that,\ndearest. Today I gave each one of your letters a kiss.... Goodbye,\nbeloved. I have been told that there is going to be a sale of clothing\nsomewhere in this neighbourhood. Once more goodbye, goodbye, my\nangel--Yours in heart and soul,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 15th.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--I am in terrible distress. I feel sure\nthat something is about to happen. The matter, my beloved friend, is\nthat Monsieur Bwikov is again in St. Petersburg, for Thedora has met\nhim. He was driving along in a drozhki, but, on meeting Thedora, he\nordered the coachman to stop, sprang out, and inquired of her where she\nwas living; but this she would not tell him. Next, he said with a\nsmile that he knew quite well who was living with her (evidently Anna\nThedorovna had told him); whereupon Thedora could hold out no longer,\nbut then and there, in the street, railed at and abused him--telling him\nthat he was an immoral man, and the cause of all my misfortunes. To\nthis he replied that a person who did not possess a groat must surely be\nrather badly off; to which Thedora retorted that I could always either\nlive by the labour of my hands or marry--that it was not so much a\nquestion of my losing posts as of my losing my happiness, the ruin of\nwhich had led almost to my death. In reply he observed that, though\nI was still quite young, I seemed to have lost my wits, and that my\n\"virtue appeared to be under a cloud\" (I quote his exact words). Both\nI and Thedora had thought that he does not know where I live; but,\nlast night, just as I had left the house to make a few purchases in the\nGostinni Dvor, he appeared at our rooms (evidently he had not wanted to\nfind me at home), and put many questions to Thedora concerning our way\nof living. Then, after inspecting my work, he wound up with: \"Who is\nthis tchinovnik friend of yours?\" At the moment you happened to be\npassing through the courtyard, so Thedora pointed you out, and the man\npeered at you, and laughed. Thedora next asked him to depart--telling\nhim that I was still ill from grief, and that it would give me great\npain to see him there; to which, after a pause, he replied that he had\ncome because he had had nothing better to do. Also, he was for giving\nThedora twenty-five roubles, but, of course, she declined them. What\ndoes it all mean? Why has he paid this visit? I cannot understand his\ngetting to know about me. I am lost in conjecture. Thedora, however,\nsays that Aksinia, her sister-in-law (who sometimes comes to see her),\nis acquainted with a laundress named Nastasia, and that this woman has\na cousin in the position of watchman to a department of which a certain\nfriend of Anna Thedorovna's nephew forms one of the staff. Can it be,\ntherefore, that an intrigue has been hatched through THIS channel? But\nThedora may be entirely mistaken. We hardly know what to think. What if\nhe should come again? The very thought terrifies me. When Thedora told\nme of this last night such terror seized upon me that I almost swooned\naway. What can the man be wanting? At all events, I refuse to know such\npeople. What have they to do with my wretched self? Ah, how I am haunted\nwith anxiety, for every moment I keep thinking that Bwikov is at hand!\nWHAT will become of me? WHAT MORE has fate in store for me? For Christ's\nsake come and see me, Makar Alexievitch! For Christ's sake come and see\nme soon!\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 18th.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--Today there took place in this house\na most lamentable, a most mysterious, a most unlooked-for occurrence.\nFirst of all, let me tell you that poor Gorshkov has been entirely\nabsolved of guilt. The decision has been long in coming, but this\nmorning he went to hear the final resolution read. It was entirely in\nhis favour. Any culpability which had been imputed to him for negligence\nand irregularity was removed by the resolution. Likewise, he was\nauthorised to recover of the merchant a large sum of money. Thus, he\nstands entirely justified, and has had his character cleansed from\nall stain. In short, he could not have wished for a more complete\nvindication. When he arrived home at three o'clock he was looking as\nwhite as a sheet, and his lips were quivering. Yet there was a smile on\nhis face as he embraced his wife and children. In a body the rest of us\nran to congratulate him, and he was greatly moved by the act. Bowing to\nus, he pressed our hands in turn. As he did so I thought, somehow, that\nhe seemed to have grown taller and straighter, and that the pus-drops\nseemed to have disappeared from his eyelashes. Yet how agitated he was,\npoor fellow! He could not rest quietly for two minutes together, but\nkept picking up and then dropping whatsoever came to his hand, and\nbowing and smiling without intermission, and sitting down and getting\nup, and again sitting down, and chattering God only knows what about his\nhonour and his good name and his little ones. How he did talk--yes, and\nweep too! Indeed, few of ourselves could refrain from tears; although\nRataziaev remarked (probably to encourage Gorshkov) that honour mattered\nnothing when one had nothing to eat, and that money was the chief thing\nin the world, and that for it alone ought God to be thanked. Then he\nslapped Gorshkov on the shoulder, but I thought that Gorshkov somehow\nseemed hurt at this. He did not express any open displeasure, but threw\nRataziaev a curious look, and removed his hand from his shoulder. ONCE\nupon a time he would not have acted thus; but characters differ. For\nexample, I myself should have hesitated, at such a season of rejoicing,\nto seem proud, even though excessive deference and civility at such a\nmoment might have been construed as a lapse both of moral courage and of\nmental vigour. However, this is none of my business. All that Gorshkov\nsaid was: \"Yes, money IS a good thing, glory be to God!\" In fact, the\nwhole time that we remained in his room he kept repeating to himself:\n\"Glory be to God, glory be to God!\" His wife ordered a richer and more\ndelicate meal than usual, and the landlady herself cooked it, for at\nheart she is not a bad woman. But until the meal was served Gorshkov\ncould not remain still. He kept entering everyone's room in turn\n(whether invited thither or not), and, seating himself smilingly upon\na chair, would sometimes say something, and sometimes not utter a word,\nbut get up and go out again. In the naval officer's room he even took a\npack of playing-cards into his hand, and was thereupon invited to make\na fourth in a game; but after losing a few times, as well as making\nseveral blunders in his play, he abandoned the pursuit. \"No,\" said he,\n\"that is the sort of man that I am--that is all that I am good for,\" and\ndeparted. Next, encountering myself in the corridor, he took my hands in\nhis, and gazed into my face with a rather curious air. Then he pressed\nmy hands again, and moved away still smiling, smiling, but in an odd,\nweary sort of manner, much as a corpse might smile. Meanwhile his wife\nwas weeping for joy, and everything in their room was decked in holiday\nguise. Presently dinner was served, and after they had dined Gorshkov\nsaid to his wife: \"See now, dearest, I am going to rest a little while;\"\nand with that went to bed. Presently he called his little daughter to\nhis side, and, laying his hand upon the child's head, lay a long while\nlooking at her. Then he turned to his wife again, and asked her: \"What\nof Petinka? Where is our Petinka?\" whereupon his wife crossed herself,\nand replied: \"Why, our Petinka is dead!\" \"Yes, yes, I know--of course,\"\nsaid her husband. \"Petinka is now in the Kingdom of Heaven.\" This showed\nhis wife that her husband was not quite in his right senses--that the\nrecent occurrence had upset him; so she said: \"My dearest, you must\nsleep awhile.\" \"I will do so,\" he replied, \"--at once--I am rather--\"\nAnd he turned over, and lay silent for a time. Then again he turned\nround and tried to say something, but his wife could not hear what it\nwas. \"What do you say?\" she inquired, but he made no reply. Then again\nshe waited a few moments until she thought to herself, \"He has gone to\nsleep,\" and departed to spend an hour with the landlady. At the end\nof that hour she returned--only to find that her husband had not yet\nawoken, but was still lying motionless. \"He is sleeping very soundly,\"\nshe reflected as she sat down and began to work at something or other.\nSince then she has told us that when half an hour or so had elapsed she\nfell into a reverie. What she was thinking of she cannot remember, save\nthat she had forgotten altogether about her husband. Then she awoke with\na curious sort of sensation at her heart. The first thing that struck\nher was the deathlike stillness of the room. Glancing at the bed,\nshe perceived her husband to be lying in the same position as before.\nThereupon she approached him, turned the coverlet back, and saw that he\nwas stiff and cold--that he had died suddenly, as though smitten with a\nstroke. But of what precisely he died God only knows. The affair has so\nterribly impressed me that even now I cannot fully collect my\nthoughts. It would scarcely be believed that a human being could die so\nsimply--and he such a poor, needy wretch, this Gorshkov! What a\nfate, what a fate, to be sure! His wife is plunged in tears and\npanic-stricken, while his little daughter has run away somewhere to hide\nherself. In their room, however, all is bustle and confusion, for the\ndoctors are about to make an autopsy on the corpse. But I cannot\ntell you things for certain; I only know that I am most grieved, most\ngrieved. How sad to think that one never knows what even a day,\nwhat even an hour, may bring forth! One seems to die to so little\npurpose!--Your own\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19th.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I hasten to let you know that Rataziaev\nhas found me some work to do for a certain writer--the latter having\nsubmitted to him a large manuscript. Glory be to God, for this means a\nlarge amount of work to do. Yet, though the copy is wanted in haste, the\noriginal is so carelessly written that I hardly know how to set about my\ntask. Indeed, certain parts of the manuscript are almost undecipherable.\nI have agreed to do the work for forty kopecks a sheet. You see\ntherefore (and this is my true reason for writing to you), that we shall\nsoon be receiving money from an extraneous source. Goodbye now, as I\nmust begin upon my labours.--Your sincere friend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 23rd.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--I have not written to you these three\ndays past for the reason that I have been so worried and alarmed.\n\nThree days ago Bwikov came again to see me. At the time I was alone, for\nThedora had gone out somewhere. As soon as I opened the door the sight\nof him so terrified me that I stood rooted to the spot, and could feel\nmyself turning pale. Entering with his usual loud laugh, he took a\nchair, and sat down. For a long while I could not collect my thoughts;\nI just sat where I was, and went on with my work. Soon his smile faded,\nfor my appearance seemed somehow to have struck him. You see, of late I\nhave grown thin, and my eyes and cheeks have fallen in, and my face has\nbecome as white as a sheet; so that anyone who knew me a year ago would\nscarcely recognise me now. After a prolonged inspection, Bwikov seemed\nto recover his spirits, for he said something to which I duly replied.\nThen again he laughed. Thus he sat for a whole hour--talking to me the\nwhile, and asking me questions about one thing and another. At length,\njust before he rose to depart, he took me by the hand, and said (to\nquote his exact words): \"Between ourselves, Barbara Alexievna, that\nkinswoman of yours and my good friend and acquaintance--I refer to\nAnna Thedorovna--is a very bad woman,\" (he also added a grosser term\nof opprobrium). \"First of all she led your cousin astray, and then she\nruined yourself. I also have behaved like a villain, but such is the way\nof the world.\" Again he laughed. Next, having remarked that, though\nnot a master of eloquence, he had always considered that obligations of\ngentility obliged him to have with me a clear and outspoken explanation,\nhe went on to say that he sought my hand in marriage; that he looked\nupon it as a duty to restore to me my honour; that he could offer me\nriches; that, after marriage, he would take me to his country seat in\nthe Steppes, where we would hunt hares; that he intended never to visit\nSt. Petersburg again, since everything there was horrible, and he had to\nentertain a worthless nephew whom he had sworn to disinherit in favour\nof a legal heir; and, finally, that it was to obtain such a legal heir\nthat he was seeking my hand in marriage. Lastly, he remarked that\nI seemed to be living in very poor circumstances (which was not\nsurprising, said he, in view of the kennel that I inhabited); that I\nshould die if I remained a month longer in that den; that all lodgings\nin St. Petersburg were detestable; and that he would be glad to know if\nI was in want of anything.\n\nSo thunderstruck was I with the proposal that I could only burst into\ntears. These tears he interpreted as a sign of gratitude, for he told\nme that he had always felt assured of my good sense, cleverness, and\nsensibility, but that hitherto he had hesitated to take this step until\nhe should have learned precisely how I was getting on. Next he asked me\nsome questions about YOU; saying that he had heard of you as a man of\ngood principle, and that since he was unwilling to remain your debtor,\nwould a sum of five hundred roubles repay you for all you had done for\nme? To this I replied that your services to myself had been such as\ncould never be requited with money; whereupon, he exclaimed that I was\ntalking rubbish and nonsense; that evidently I was still young enough to\nread poetry; that romances of this kind were the undoing of young girls,\nthat books only corrupted morality, and that, for his part, he could not\nabide them. \"You ought to live as long as I have done,\" he added, \"and\nTHEN you will see what men can be.\"\n\nWith that he requested me to give his proposal my favourable\nconsideration--saying that he would not like me to take such an\nimportant step unguardedly, since want of thought and impetuosity often\nspelt ruin to youthful inexperience, but that he hoped to receive an\nanswer in the affirmative. \"Otherwise,\" said he, \"I shall have no choice\nbut to marry a certain merchant's daughter in Moscow, in order that\nI may keep my vow to deprive my nephew of the inheritance.\"--Then he\npressed five hundred roubles into my hand--to buy myself some bonbons,\nas he phrased it--and wound up by saying that in the country I should\ngrow as fat as a doughnut or a cheese rolled in butter; that at the\npresent moment he was extremely busy; and that, deeply engaged in\nbusiness though he had been all day, he had snatched the present\nopportunity of paying me a visit. At length he departed.\n\nFor a long time I sat plunged in reflection. Great though my distress\nof mind was, I soon arrived at a decision.... My friend, I am going to\nmarry this man; I have no choice but to accept his proposal. If anyone\ncould save me from this squalor, and restore to me my good name, and\navert from me future poverty and want and misfortune, he is the man to\ndo it. What else have I to look for from the future? What more am I to\nask of fate? Thedora declares that one need NEVER lose one's happiness;\nbut what, I ask HER, can be called happiness under such circumstances as\nmine? At all events I see no other road open, dear friend. I see nothing\nelse to be done. I have worked until I have ruined my health. I cannot\ngo on working forever. Shall I go out into the world? Nay; I am worn to\na shadow with grief, and become good for nothing. Sickly by nature, I\nshould merely be a burden upon other folks. Of course this marriage will\nnot bring me paradise, but what else does there remain, my friend--what\nelse does there remain? What other choice is left?\n\nI had not asked your advice earlier for the reason that I wanted to\nthink the matter over alone. However, the decision which you have just\nread is unalterable, and I am about to announce it to Bwikov himself,\nwho in any case has pressed me for a speedy reply, owing to the fact (so\nhe says) that his business will not wait nor allow him to remain here\nlonger, and that therefore, no trifle must be allowed to stand in its\nway. God alone knows whether I shall be happy, but my fate is in His\nholy, His inscrutable hand, and I have so decided. Bwikov is said to be\nkind-hearted. He will at least respect me, and perhaps I shall be\nable to return that respect. What more could be looked for from such a\nmarriage?\n\nI have now told you all, Makar Alexievitch, and feel sure that you will\nunderstand my despondency. Do not, however, try to divert me from my\nintention, for all your efforts will be in vain. Think for a moment;\nweigh in your heart for a moment all that has led me to take this step.\nAt first my anguish was extreme, but now I am quieter. What awaits me I\nknow not. What must be must be, and as God may send....\n\nBwikov has just arrived, so I am leaving this letter unfinished.\nOtherwise I had much else to say to you. Bwikov is even now at the\ndoor!...\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 23rd.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I hasten to reply to you--I hasten to\nexpress to you my extreme astonishment.... In passing, I may mention\nthat yesterday we buried poor Gorshkov....\n\nYes, Bwikov has acted nobly, and you have no choice but to accept him.\nAll things are in God's hands. This is so, and must always be so; and\nthe purposes of the Divine Creator are at once good and inscrutable, as\nalso is Fate, which is one with Him....\n\nThedora will share your happiness--for, of course, you will be happy,\nand free from want, darling, dearest, sweetest of angels! But why should\nthe matter be so hurried? Oh, of course--Monsieur Bwikov's business\naffairs. Only a man who has no affairs to see to can afford to disregard\nsuch things. I got a glimpse of Monsieur Bwikov as he was leaving your\ndoor. He is a fine-looking man--a very fine-looking man; though that is\nnot the point that I should most have noticed had I been quite myself at\nthe time....\n\nIn the future shall we be able to write letters to one another? I keep\nwondering and wondering what has led you to say all that you have said.\nTo think that just when twenty pages of my copying are completed THIS\nhas happened!... I suppose you will be able to make many purchases\nnow--to buy shoes and dresses and all sorts of things? Do you remember\nthe shops in Gorokhovaia Street of which I used to speak?...\n\nBut no. You ought not to go out at present--you simply ought not to, and\nshall not. Presently, you will he able to buy many, many things, and to,\nkeep a carriage. Also, at present the weather is bad. Rain is descending\nin pailfuls, and it is such a soaking kind of rain that--that you might\ncatch cold from it, my darling, and the chill might go to your heart.\nWhy should your fear of this man lead you to take such risks when\nall the time I am here to do your bidding? So Thedora declares great\nhappiness to be awaiting you, does she? She is a gossiping old woman,\nand evidently desires to ruin you.\n\nShall you be at the all-night Mass this evening, dearest? I should like\nto come and see you there. Yes, Bwikov spoke but the truth when he said\nthat you are a woman of virtue, wit, and good feeling. Yet I think he\nwould do far better to marry the merchant's daughter. What think YOU\nabout it? Yes, 'twould be far better for him. As soon as it grows dark\ntonight I mean to come and sit with you for an hour. Tonight twilight\nwill close in early, so I shall soon be with you. Yes, come what may,\nI mean to see you for an hour. At present, I suppose, you are expecting\nBwikov, but I will come as soon as he has gone. So stay at home until I\nhave arrived, dearest.\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 27th.\n\nDEAR MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--Bwikov has just informed me that I must have\nat least three dozen linen blouses; so I must go at once and look for\nsempstresses to make two out of the three dozen, since time presses.\nIndeed, Monsieur Bwikov is quite angry about the fuss which these\nfripperies are entailing, seeing that there remain but five days before\nthe wedding, and we are to depart on the following day. He keeps rushing\nabout and declaring that no time ought to be wasted on trifles. I am\nterribly worried, and scarcely able to stand on my feet. There is\nso much to do, and, perhaps, so much that were better left undone!\nMoreover, I have no blond or other lace; so THERE is another item to be\npurchased, since Bwikov declares that he cannot have his bride look\nlike a cook, but, on the contrary, she must \"put the noses of the great\nladies out of joint.\" That is his expression. I wish, therefore, that\nyou would go to Madame Chiffon's, in Gorokhovaia Street, and ask her, in\nthe first place, to send me some sempstresses, and, in the second place,\nto give herself the trouble of coming in person, as I am too ill to\ngo out. Our new flat is very cold, and still in great disorder. Also,\nBwikov has an aunt who is at her last gasp through old age, and may die\nbefore our departure. He himself, however, declares this to be nothing,\nand says that she will soon recover. He is not yet living with me, and\nI have to go running hither and thither to find him. Only Thedora\nis acting as my servant, together with Bwikov's valet, who oversees\neverything, but has been absent for the past three days.\n\nEach morning Bwikov goes to business, and loses his temper. Yesterday\nhe even had some trouble with the police because of his thrashing the\nsteward of these buildings... I have no one to send with this letter so\nI am going to post it... Ah! I had almost forgotten the most important\npoint--which is that I should like you to go and tell Madame Chiffon\nthat I wish the blond lace to be changed in conformity with yesterday's\npatterns, if she will be good enough to bring with her a new assortment.\nAlso say that I have altered my mind about the satin, which I wish to\nbe tamboured with crochet-work; also, that tambour is to be used with\nmonograms on the various garments. Do you hear? Tambour, not smooth\nwork. Do not forget that it is to be tambour. Another thing I had almost\nforgotten, which is that the lappets of the fur cloak must be raised,\nand the collar bound with lace. Please tell her these things, Makar\nAlexievitch.--Your friend,\n\nB. D.\n\nP.S.--I am so ashamed to trouble you with my commissions! This is the\nthird morning that you will have spent in running about for my sake. But\nwhat else am I to do? The whole place is in disorder, and I myself\nam ill. Do not be vexed with me, Makar Alexievitch. I am feeling so\ndepressed! What is going to become of me, dear friend, dear, kind, old\nMakar Alexievitch? I dread to look forward into the future. Somehow I\nfeel apprehensive; I am living, as it were, in a mist. Yet, for God's\nsake, forget none of my commissions. I am so afraid lest you should make\na mistake! Remember that everything is to be tambour work, not smooth.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 27th.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--I have carefully fulfilled your\ncommissions. Madame Chiffon informs me that she herself had thought of\nusing tambour work as being more suitable (though I did not quite take\nin all she said). Also, she has informed me that, since you have given\ncertain directions in writing, she has followed them (though again I do\nnot clearly remember all that she said--I only remember that she said\na very great deal, for she is a most tiresome old woman). These\nobservations she will soon be repeating to you in person. For myself, I\nfeel absolutely exhausted, and have not been to the office today...\n\nDo not despair about the future, dearest. To save you trouble I would\nvisit every shop in St. Petersburg. You write that you dare not look\nforward into the future. But by tonight, at seven o'clock, you will have\nlearned all, for Madame Chiffon will have arrived in person to see you.\nHope on, and everything will order itself for the best. Of course, I\nam referring only to these accursed gewgaws, to these frills and\nfripperies! Ah me, ah me, how glad I shall be to see you, my angel! Yes,\nhow glad I shall be! Twice already today I have passed the gates of your\nabode. Unfortunately, this Bwikov is a man of such choler that--Well,\nthings are as they are.\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 28th.\n\nMY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--For God's sake go to the jeweller's,\nand tell him that, after all, he need not make the pearl and emerald\nearrings. Monsieur Bwikov says that they will cost him too much, that\nthey will burn a veritable hole in his pocket. In fact, he has lost his\ntemper again, and declares that he is being robbed. Yesterday he added\nthat, had he but known, but foreseen, these expenses, he would never\nhave married. Also, he says that, as things are, he intends only to have\na plain wedding, and then to depart. \"You must not look for any dancing\nor festivity or entertainment of guests, for our gala times are still in\nthe air.\" Such were his words. God knows I do not want such things, but\nnone the less Bwikov has forbidden them. I made him no answer on the\nsubject, for he is a man all too easily irritated. What, what is going\nto become of me?\n\nB. D.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 28th.\n\nMY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--All is well as regards the jeweller.\nUnfortunately, I have also to say that I myself have fallen ill, and\ncannot rise from bed. Just when so many things need to be done, I have\ngone and caught a chill, the devil take it! Also I have to tell you\nthat, to complete my misfortunes, his Excellency has been pleased to\nbecome stricter. Today he railed at and scolded Emelia Ivanovitch until\nthe poor fellow was quite put about. That is the sum of my news.\n\nNo--there is something else concerning which I should like to write\nto you, but am afraid to obtrude upon your notice. I am a simple,\ndull fellow who writes down whatsoever first comes into his head--Your\nfriend,\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 29th.\n\nMY OWN BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--Today, dearest, I saw Thedora, who informed\nme that you are to be married tomorrow, and on the following day to go\naway--for which purpose Bwikov has ordered a post-chaise....\n\nWell, of the incident of his Excellency, I have already told you. Also\nI have verified the bill from the shop in Gorokhovaia Street. It is\ncorrect, but very long. Why is Monsieur Bwikov so out of humour with\nyou? Nay, but you must be of good cheer, my darling. I am so, and shall\nalways be so, so long as you are happy. I should have come to the church\ntomorrow, but, alas, shall be prevented from doing so by the pain in my\nloins. Also, I would have written an account of the ceremony, but that\nthere will be no one to report to me the details....\n\nYes, you have been a very good friend to Thedora, dearest. You have\nacted kindly, very kindly, towards her. For every such deed God will\nbless you. Good deeds never go unrewarded, nor does virtue ever fail to\nwin the crown of divine justice, be it early or be it late. Much else\nshould I have liked to write to you. Every hour, every minute I could\noccupy in writing. Indeed I could write to you forever! Only your book,\n\"The Stories of Bielkin\", is left to me. Do not deprive me of it, I pray\nyou, but suffer me to keep it. It is not so much because I wish to read\nthe book for its own sake, as because winter is coming on, when the\nevenings will be long and dreary, and one will want to read at least\nSOMETHING.\n\nDo you know, I am going to move from my present quarters into your old\nones, which I intend to rent from Thedora; for I could never part with\nthat good old woman. Moreover, she is such a splendid worker.\nYesterday I inspected your empty room in detail, and inspected your\nembroidery-frame, with the work still hanging on it. It had been left\nuntouched in its corner. Next, I inspected the work itself, of which\nthere still remained a few remnants, and saw that you had used one of my\nletters for a spool upon which to wind your thread. Also, on the table\nI found a scrap of paper which had written on it, \"My dearest Makar\nAlexievitch I hasten to--\" that was all. Evidently, someone had\ninterrupted you at an interesting point. Lastly, behind a screen there\nwas your little bed.... Oh darling of darlings!!!... Well, goodbye now,\ngoodbye now, but for God's sake send me something in answer to this\nletter!\n\nMAKAR DIEVUSHKIN.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 30th.\n\nMY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,--All is over! The die is cast! What my lot\nmay have in store I know not, but I am submissive to the will of God.\nTomorrow, then, we depart. For the last time, I take my leave of you, my\nfriend beyond price, my benefactor, my dear one! Do not grieve for me,\nbut try to live happily. Think of me sometimes, and may the blessing\nof Almighty God light upon you! For myself, I shall often have you in\nremembrance, and recall you in my prayers. Thus our time together\nhas come to an end. Little comfort in my new life shall I derive\nfrom memories of the past. The more, therefore, shall I cherish the\nrecollection of you, and the dearer will you ever be to my heart. Here,\nyou have been my only friend; here, you alone have loved me. Yes, I have\nseen all, I have known all--I have throughout known how well you love\nme. A single smile of mine, a single stroke from my pen, has been able\nto make you happy.... But now you must forget me.... How lonely you will\nbe! Why should you stay here at all, kind, inestimable, but solitary,\nfriend of mine?\n\nTo your care I entrust the book, the embroidery frame, and the letter\nupon which I had begun. When you look upon the few words which the\nletter contains you will be able mentally to read in thought all that\nyou would have liked further to hear or receive from me--all that I\nwould so gladly have written, but can never now write. Think sometimes\nof your poor little Barbara who loved you so well. All your letters I\nhave left behind me in the top drawer of Thedora's chest of drawers...\nYou write that you are ill, but Monsieur Bwikov will not let me leave\nthe house today; so that I can only write to you. Also, I will write\nagain before long. That is a promise. Yet God only knows when I shall be\nable to do so....\n\nNow we must bid one another forever farewell, my friend, my beloved,\nmy own! Yes, it must be forever! Ah, how at this moment I could embrace\nyou! Goodbye, dear friend--goodbye, goodbye! May you ever rest well and\nhappy! To the end I shall keep you in my prayers. How my heart is\naching under its load of sorrow!... Monsieur Bwikov is just calling for\nme....--Your ever loving\n\nB.\n\nP.S.--My heart is full! It is full to bursting of tears! Sorrow has me\nin its grip, and is tearing me to pieces. Goodbye. My God, what grief!\nDo not, do not forget your poor Barbara!\n\n\n\nBELOVED BARBARA--MY JEWEL, MY PRICELESS ONE,--You are now almost en\nroute, you are now just about to depart! Would that they had torn my\nheart out of my breast rather than have taken you away from me! How\ncould you allow it? You weep, yet you go! And only this moment I have\nreceived from you a letter stained with your tears! It must be that\nyou are departing unwillingly; it must be that you are being abducted\nagainst your will; it must be that you are sorry for me; it must be\nthat--that you LOVE me!...\n\nYet how will it fare with you now? Your heart will soon have become\nchilled and sick and depressed. Grief will soon have sucked away its\nlife; grief will soon have rent it in twain! Yes, you will die where you\nbe, and be laid to rest in the cold, moist earth where there is no one\nto bewail you. Monsieur Bwikov will only be hunting hares!...\n\nAh, my darling, my darling! WHY did you come to this decision? How could\nyou bring yourself to take such a step? What have you done, have you\ndone, have you done? Soon they will be carrying you away to the tomb;\nsoon your beauty will have become defiled, my angel. Ah, dearest one,\nyou are as weak as a feather. And where have I been all this time? What\nhave I been thinking of? I have treated you merely as a forward child\nwhose head was aching. Fool that I was, I neither saw nor understood.\nI have behaved as though, right or wrong, the matter was in no way my\nconcern. Yes, I have been running about after fripperies!... Ah, but I\nWILL leave my bed. Tomorrow I WILL rise sound and well, and be once more\nmyself....\n\nDearest, I could throw myself under the wheels of a passing vehicle\nrather than that you should go like this. By what right is it being\ndone?... I will go with you; I will run behind your carriage if you will\nnot take me--yes, I will run, and run so long as the power is in me, and\nuntil my breath shall have failed. Do you know whither you are going?\nPerhaps you will not know, and will have to ask me? Before you there\nlie the Steppes, my darling--only the Steppes, the naked Steppes, the\nSteppes that are as bare as the palm of my hand. THERE there live only\nheartless old women and rude peasants and drunkards. THERE the trees\nhave already shed their leaves. THERE there abide but rain and cold. Why\nshould you go thither? True, Monsieur Bwikov will have his diversions in\nthat country--he will be able to hunt the hare; but what of yourself? Do\nyou wish to become a mere estate lady? Nay; look at yourself, my seraph\nof heaven. Are you in any way fitted for such a role? How could you\nplay it? To whom should I write letters? To whom should I send these\nmissives? Whom should I call \"my darling\"? To whom should I apply that\nname of endearment? Where, too, could I find you?\n\nWhen you are gone, Barbara, I shall die--for certain I shall die, for my\nheart cannot bear this misery. I love you as I love the light of God;\nI love you as my own daughter; to you I have devoted my love in its\nentirety; only for you have I lived at all; only because you were near\nme have I worked and copied manuscripts and committed my views to paper\nunder the guise of friendly letters.\n\nPerhaps you did not know all this, but it has been so. How, then, my\nbeloved, could you bring yourself to leave me? Nay, you MUST not go--it\nis impossible, it is sheerly, it is utterly, impossible. The rain will\nfall upon you, and you are weak, and will catch cold. The floods will\nstop your carriage. No sooner will it have passed the city barriers than\nit will break down, purposely break down. Here, in St. Petersburg, they\nare bad builders of carriages. Yes, I know well these carriage-builders.\nThey are jerry-builders who can fashion a toy, but nothing that is\ndurable. Yes, I swear they can make nothing that is durable.... All that\nI can do is to go upon my knees before Monsieur Bwikov, and to tell him\nall, to tell him all. Do you also tell him all, dearest, and reason with\nhim. Tell him that you MUST remain here, and must not go. Ah, why did he\nnot marry that merchant's daughter in Moscow? Let him go and marry her\nnow. She would suit him far better and for reasons which I well know.\nThen I could keep you. For what is he to you, this Monsieur Bwikov? Why\nhas he suddenly become so dear to your heart? Is it because he can buy\nyou gewgaws? What are THEY? What use are THEY? They are so much rubbish.\nOne should consider human life rather than mere finery.\n\nNevertheless, as soon as I have received my next instalment of salary I\nmean to buy you a new cloak. I mean to buy it at a shop with which I\nam acquainted. Only, you must wait until my next installment is due, my\nangel of a Barbara. Ah, God, my God! To think that you are going away\ninto the Steppes with Monsieur Bwikov--that you are going away never\nto return!... Nay, nay, but you SHALL write to me. You SHALL write me\na letter as soon as you have started, even if it be your last letter of\nall, my dearest. Yet will it be your last letter? How has it come about\nso suddenly, so irrevocably, that this letter should be your last? Nay,\nnay; I will write, and you shall write--yes, NOW, when at length I am\nbeginning to improve my style. Style? I do not know what I am writing. I\nnever do know what I am writing. I could not possibly know, for I never\nread over what I have written, nor correct its orthography. At the\npresent moment, I am writing merely for the sake of writing, and to put\nas much as possible into this last letter of mine....\n\nAh, dearest, my pet, my own darling!...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poor Folk, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POOR FOLK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2302.txt or 2302.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/3\/0\/2302\/\n\nProduced by Martin Adamson\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":501,"split":"train"}
