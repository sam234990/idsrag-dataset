Lord Monmouth initially disapproved of Coningsby's parents' marriage, but on their death he relents and sends the boy to be educated at Eton College. At Eton Coningsby meets and befriends Oswald Millbank, the son of a rich cotton manufacturer who is a bitter enemy of Lord Monmouth. The two older men represent old and new wealth in society.\nAs Coningsby grows up he begins to develop his own liberal political views, and falls in love with Oswald's sister Edith. When Lord Monmouth discovers these developments he is furious and secretly disinherits his grandson. On his death, Coningsby is left penniless, and is forced to work for his living. He decides to study law and become a barrister. This proof of his character impresses Edith's father (who had previously also been hostile) and he consents to their marriage at last. By the end of the novel Coningsby is elected to Parliament for his new father-in-law's constituency and his fortune is restored.\nThe character of Coningsby is based on George Smythe. The themes, and some of the characters, reappear in Disraeli's later novels Sybil, and Tancred.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Coningsby, by Benjamin Disraeli\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

His period, thus,\nis that of Bulwer, Dickens, and Thackeray, and of the later years of Sir\nWalter Scott--a fact which his prominence as a statesman during the last\ndecade of his life, as well as the vogue of \"Lothair\" and \"Endymion,\"\nhas tended to obscure. His style, his material, and his views of English\ncharacter and life all date from that earlier time. He was born in 1804\nand died in 1881.\n\n\"Coningsby; or, The New Generation,\" published in 1844, is the best\nof his novels, not as a story, but as a study of men, manners, and\nprinciples. The plot is slight--little better than a device for\nstringing together sketches of character and statements of political and\neconomic opinions; but these are always interesting and often brilliant.\nThe motive which underlies the book is political. It is, in brief, an\nattempt to show that the political salvation of England was to be sought\nin its aristocracy, but that this aristocracy was morally weak and\nsocially ineffective, and that it must mend its ways before its duty to\nthe state could be fulfilled. Interest in this aspect of the book has,\nof course, to a large extent passed away with the political conditions\nwhich it reflected. As a picture of aristocratic life in England in\nthe first part of the nineteenth century it has, however, enduring\nsignificance and charm. Disraeli does not rank with the great writers\nof English realistic fiction, but in this special field none of them\nhas surpassed him. From this point of view, accordingly, \"Coningsby\" is\nappropriately included in this series.\n\n\n\n\nTO HENRY HOPE\n\n\nIt is not because this work was conceived and partly executed amid the\nglades and galleries of the DEEPDENE that I have inscribed it with your\nname. Nor merely because I was desirous to avail myself of the most\ngraceful privilege of an author, and dedicate my work to the friend\nwhose talents I have always appreciated, and whose virtues I have ever\nadmired.\n\nBut because in these pages I have endeavoured to picture something of\nthat development of the new and, as I believe, better mind of England,\nthat has often been the subject of our converse and speculation.\n\nIn this volume you will find many a thought illustrated and many a\nprinciple attempted to be established that we have often together\npartially discussed and canvassed.\n\nDoubtless you may encounter some opinions with which you may not\nagree, and some conclusions the accuracy of which you may find cause\nto question. But if I have generally succeeded in my object, to scatter\nsome suggestions that may tend to elevate the tone of public life,\nascertain the true character of political parties, and induce us for\nthe future more carefully to distinguish between facts and phrases,\nrealities and phantoms, I believe that I shall gain your sympathy, for\nI shall find a reflex to their efforts in your own generous spirit and\nenlightened mind.\n\nGROSVENOR GATE: May Day 1844.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\n'CONINGSBY' was published in the year 1844. The main purpose of its\nwriter was to vindicate the just claims of the Tory party to be the\npopular political confederation of the country; a purpose which he had,\nmore or less, pursued from a very early period of life. The occasion\nwas favourable to the attempt. The youthful mind of England had just\nrecovered from the inebriation of the great Conservative triumph of\n1841, and was beginning to inquire what, after all, they had conquered\nto preserve. It was opportune, therefore, to show that Toryism was not\na phrase, but a fact; and that our political institutions were the\nembodiment of our popular necessities. This the writer endeavoured to do\nwithout prejudice, and to treat of events and characters of which he had\nsome personal experience, not altogether without the impartiality of the\nfuture.\n\nIt was not originally the intention of the writer to adopt the form\nof fiction as the instrument to scatter his suggestions, but, after\nreflection, he resolved to avail himself of a method which, in the\ntemper of the times, offered the best chance of influencing opinion.\n\nIn considering the Tory scheme, the author recognised in the CHURCH the\nmost powerful agent in the previous development of England, and the most\nefficient means of that renovation of the national spirit at which\nhe aimed. The Church is a sacred corporation for the promulgation and\nmaintenance in Europe of certain Asian principles, which, although\nlocal in their birth, are of divine origin, and of universal and eternal\napplication.\n\nIn asserting the paramount character of the ecclesiastical polity and\nthe majesty of the theocratic principle, it became necessary to ascend\nto the origin of the Christian Church, and to meet in a spirit worthy\nof a critical and comparatively enlightened age, the position of the\ndescendants of that race who were the founders of Christianity. The\nmodern Jews had long laboured under the odium and stigma of mediaeval\nmalevolence. In the dark ages, when history was unknown, the passions\nof societies, undisturbed by traditionary experience, were strong, and\ntheir convictions, unmitigated by criticism, were necessarily fanatical.\nThe Jews were looked upon in the middle ages as an accursed race, the\nenemies of God and man, the especial foes of Christianity. No one in\nthose days paused to reflect that Christianity was founded by the Jews;\nthat its Divine Author, in his human capacity, was a descendant of King\nDavid; that his doctrines avowedly were the completion, not the change,\nof Judaism; that the Apostles and the Evangelists, whose names men daily\ninvoked, and whose volumes they embraced with reverence, were all Jews;\nthat the infallible throne of Rome itself was established by a Jew; and\nthat a Jew was the founder of the Christian Churches of Asia.\n\nThe European nations, relatively speaking, were then only recently\nconverted to a belief in Moses and in Christ; and, as it were, still\nashamed of the wild deities whom they had deserted, they thought they\natoned for their past idolatry by wreaking their vengeance on a race to\nwhom, and to whom alone, they were indebted for the Gospel they adored.\n\nIn vindicating the sovereign right of the Church of Christ to be the\nperpetual regenerator of man, the writer thought the time had arrived\nwhen some attempt should be made to do justice to the race which had\nfounded Christianity.\n\nThe writer has developed in another work ('Tancred') the views\nrespecting the great house of Israel which he first intimated in\n'Coningsby.' No one has attempted to refute them, nor is refutation\npossible; since all he has done is to examine certain facts in the truth\nof which all agree, and to draw from them irresistible conclusions which\nprejudice for a moment may shrink from, but which reason cannot refuse\nto admit.\n\nD.\n\nGROSVENOR GATE: May 1894.\n\n\n\n\nCONINGSBY\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was a bright May morning some twelve years ago, when a youth of still\ntender age, for he had certainly not entered his teens by more than two\nyears, was ushered into the waiting-room of a house in the vicinity\nof St. James's Square, which, though with the general appearance of\na private residence, and that too of no very ambitious character,\nexhibited at this period symptoms of being occupied for some public\npurpose.\n\nThe house-door was constantly open, and frequent guests even at this\nearly hour crossed the threshold. The hall-table was covered with sealed\nletters; and the hall-porter inscribed in a book the name of every\nindividual who entered.\n\nThe young gentleman we have mentioned found himself in a room which\noffered few resources for his amusement. A large table amply covered\nwith writing materials, and a few chairs, were its sole furniture,\nexcept the grey drugget that covered the floor, and a muddy mezzotinto\nof the Duke of Wellington that adorned its cold walls. There was not\neven a newspaper; and the only books were the Court Guide and the London\nDirectory. For some time he remained with patient endurance planted\nagainst the wall, with his feet resting on the rail of his chair; but\nat length in his shifting posture he gave evidence of his restlessness,\nrose from his seat, looked out of the window into a small side court of\nthe house surrounded with dead walls, paced the room, took up the Court\nGuide, changed it for the London Directory, then wrote his name over\nseveral sheets of foolscap paper, drew various landscapes and faces of\nhis friends; and then, splitting up a pen or two, delivered himself of a\nyawn which seemed the climax of his weariness.\n\nAnd yet the youth's appearance did not betoken a character that, if\nthe opportunity had offered, could not have found amusement and even\ninstruction. His countenance, radiant with health and the lustre of\ninnocence, was at the same time thoughtful and resolute. The expression\nof his deep blue eyes was serious. Without extreme regularity of\nfeatures, the face was one that would never have passed unobserved. His\nshort upper lip indicated a good breed; and his chestnut curls clustered\nover his open brow, while his shirt-collar thrown over his shoulders\nwas unrestrained by handkerchief or ribbon. Add to this, a limber and\ngraceful figure, which the jacket of his boyish dress exhibited to great\nadvantage.\n\nJust as the youth, mounted on a chair, was adjusting the portrait of the\nDuke, which he had observed to be awry, the gentleman for whom he had\nbeen all this time waiting entered the room.\n\n'Floreat Etona!' hastily exclaimed the gentleman, in a sharp voice; 'you\nare setting the Duke to rights. I have left you a long time a prisoner;\nbut I found them so busy here, that I made my escape with some\ndifficulty.'\n\nHe who uttered these words was a man of middle size and age, originally\nin all probability of a spare habit, but now a little inclined to\ncorpulency. Baldness, perhaps, contributed to the spiritual expression\nof a brow, which was, however, essentially intellectual, and gave some\ncharacter of openness to a countenance which, though not ill-favoured,\nwas unhappily stamped by a sinister cast that was not to be mistaken.\nHis manner was easy, but rather audacious than well-bred. Indeed, while\na visage which might otherwise be described as handsome was spoilt by\na dishonest glance, so a demeanour that was by no means deficient in\nself-possession and facility, was tainted by an innate vulgarity, which\nin the long run, though seldom, yet surely developed itself.\n\nThe youth had jumped off his chair on the entrance of the gentleman, and\nthen taking up his hat, said:\n\n'Shall we go to grandpapa now, sir?'\n\n'By all means, my dear boy,' said the gentleman, putting his arm within\nthat of the youth; and they were just on the point of leaving\nthe waiting-room, when the door was suddenly thrown open, and two\nindividuals, in a state of great excitement, rushed into the apartment.\n\n'Rigby! Rigby!' they both exclaimed at the same moment. 'By G----\nthey're out!'\n\n'Who told you?'\n\n'The best authority; one of themselves.'\n\n'Who? who?'\n\n'Paul Evelyn; I met him as I passed Brookes', and he told me that Lord\nGrey had resigned, and the King had accepted his resignation.'\n\nBut Mr. Rigby, who, though very fond of news, and much interested in the\npresent, was extremely jealous of any one giving him information, was\nsceptical. He declared that Paul Evelyn was always wrong; that it was\nmorally impossible that Paul Evelyn ever could be right; that he knew,\nfrom the highest authority, that Lord Grey had been twice yesterday with\nthe King; that on the last visit nothing was settled; that if he had\nbeen at the palace again to-day, he could not have been there before\ntwelve o'clock; that it was only now a quarter to one; that Lord Grey\nwould have called his colleagues together on his return; that at\nleast an hour must have elapsed before anything could possibly have\ntranspired. Then he compared and criticised the dates of every rumoured\nincident of the last twenty-four hours, and nobody was stronger in dates\nthan Mr. Rigby; counted even the number of stairs which the minister\nhad to ascend and descend in his visit to the palace, and the time their\nmountings and dismountings must have consumed, detail was Mr. Rigby's\nforte; and finally, what with his dates, his private information, his\nknowledge of palace localities, his contempt for Paul Evelyn, and his\nconfidence in himself, he succeeded in persuading his downcast and\ndisheartened friends that their comfortable intelligence had not the\nslightest foundation.\n\nThey all left the room together; they were in the hall; the gentlemen\nwho brought the news looked somewhat depressed, but Mr. Rigby gay, even\namid the prostration of his party, from the consciousness that he had\nmost critically demolished a piece of political gossip and conveyed a\ncertain degree of mortification to a couple of his companions; when a\ntravelling carriage and four with a ducal coronet drove up to the house.\nThe door was thrown open, the steps dashed down, and a youthful noble\nsprang from his chariot into the hall.\n\n'Good morning, Rigby,' said the Duke.\n\n'I see your Grace well, I am sure,' said Mr. Rigby, with a softened\nmanner.\n\n'You have heard the news, gentlemen?' the Duke continued.\n\n'What news? Yes; no; that is to say, Mr. Rigby thinks--'\n\n'You know, of course, that Lord Lyndhurst is with the King?'\n\n'It is impossible,' said Mr. Rigby.\n\n'I don't think I can be mistaken,' said the Duke, smiling.\n\n'I will show your Grace that it is impossible,' said Mr. Rigby, 'Lord\nLyndhurst slept at Wimbledon. Lord Grey could not have seen the King\nuntil twelve o'clock; it is now five minutes to one. It is impossible,\ntherefore, that any message from the King could have reached Lord\nLyndhurst in time for his Lordship to be at the palace at this moment.'\n\n'But my authority is a high one,' said the Duke.\n\n'Authority is a phrase,' said Mr. Rigby; 'we must look to time and\nplace, dates and localities, to discover the truth.'\n\n'Your Grace was saying that your authority--' ventured to observe Mr.\nTadpole, emboldened by the presence of a duke, his patron, to struggle\nagainst the despotism of a Rigby, his tyrant.\n\n'Was the highest,' rejoined the Duke, smiling, 'for it was Lord\nLyndhurst himself. I came up from Nuneham this morning, passed his\nLordship's house in Hyde Park Place as he was getting into his carriage\nin full dress, stopped my own, and learned in a breath that the Whigs\nwere out, and that the King had sent for the Chief Baron. So I came on\nhere at once.'\n\n'I always thought the country was sound at bottom,' exclaimed Mr. Taper,\nwho, under the old system, had sneaked into the Treasury Board.\n\nTadpole and Taper were great friends. Neither of them ever despaired\nof the Commonwealth. Even if the Reform Bill were passed, Taper was\nconvinced that the Whigs would never prove men of business; and when his\nfriends confessed among themselves that a Tory Government was for the\nfuture impossible, Taper would remark, in a confidential whisper, that\nfor his part he believed before the year was over the Whigs would be\nturned out by the clerks.\n\n'There is no doubt that there is considerable reaction,' said Mr.\nTadpole. The infamous conduct of the Whigs in the Amersham case has\nopened the public mind more than anything.'\n\n'Aldborough was worse,' said Mr. Taper.\n\n'Terrible,' said Tadpole. 'They said there was no use discussing the\nReform Bill in our House. I believe Rigby's great speech on Aldborough\nhas done more towards the reaction than all the violence of the\nPolitical Unions put together.'\n\n'Let us hope for the best,' said the Duke, mildly. ''Tis a bold step on\nthe part of the Sovereign, and I am free to say I could have wished it\npostponed; but we must support the King like men. What say you, Rigby?\nYou are silent.'\n\n'I am thinking how very unfortunate it was that I did not breakfast with\nLyndhurst this morning, as I was nearly doing, instead of going down to\nEton.'\n\n'To Eton! and why to Eton?'\n\n'For the sake of my young friend here, Lord Monmouth's grandson. By the\nbye, you are kinsmen. Let me present to your Grace, MR. CONINGSBY.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThe political agitation which for a year and a half had shaken England\nto its centre, received, if possible, an increase to its intensity and\nvirulence, when it was known, in the early part of the month of May,\n1832, that the Prime Minister had tendered his resignation to the King,\nwhich resignation had been graciously accepted.\n\nThe amendment carried by the Opposition in the House of Lords on the\nevening of the 7th of May, that the enfranchising clauses of the\nReform Bill should be considered before entering into the question of\ndisfranchisement, was the immediate cause of this startling event. The\nLords had previously consented to the second reading of the Bill with\nthe view of preventing that large increase of their numbers with which\nthey had been long menaced; rather, indeed, by mysterious rumours than\nby any official declaration; but, nevertheless, in a manner which had\ncarried conviction to no inconsiderable portion of the Opposition that\nthe threat was not without foundation.\n\nDuring the progress of the Bill through the Lower House, the journals\nwhich were looked upon as the organs of the ministry had announced with\nunhesitating confidence, that Lord Grey was armed with what was then\ncalled a 'carte blanche' to create any number of peers necessary to\ninsure its success. But public journalists who were under the control of\nthe ministry, and whose statements were never contradicted, were not\nthe sole authorities for this prevailing belief. Members of the House of\nCommons, who were strong supporters of the cabinet, though not connected\nwith it by any official tie, had unequivocally stated in their places\nthat the Sovereign had not resisted the advice of his counsellors to\ncreate peers, if such creation were required to carry into effect what\nwas then styled 'the great national measure.' In more than one instance,\nministers had been warned, that if they did not exercise that power with\nprompt energy, they might deserve impeachment. And these intimations and\nannouncements had been made in the presence of leading members of the\nGovernment, and had received from them, at least, the sanction of their\nsilence.\n\nIt did not subsequently appear that the Reform ministers had been\ninvested with any such power; but a conviction of the reverse, fostered\nby these circumstances, had successfully acted upon the nervous\ntemperament, or the statesman-like prudence, of a certain section of the\npeers, who consequently hesitated in their course; were known as being\nno longer inclined to pursue their policy of the preceding session; had\nthus obtained a title at that moment in everybody's mouth, the title of\n'THE WAVERERS.'\n\nNotwithstanding, therefore, the opposition of the Duke of Wellington and\nof Lord Lyndhurst, the Waverers carried the second reading of the Reform\nBill; and then, scared at the consequences of their own headstrong\ntimidity, they went in a fright to the Duke and his able adviser to\nextricate them from the inevitable result of their own conduct.\nThe ultimate device of these distracted counsels, where daring and\npoltroonery, principle and expediency, public spirit and private\nintrigue, each threw an ingredient into the turbulent spell, was the\ncelebrated and successful amendment to which we have referred.\n\nBut the Whig ministers, who, whatever may have been their faults, were\nat least men of intellect and courage, were not to be beaten by 'the\nWaverers.' They might have made terms with an audacious foe; they\ntrampled on a hesitating opponent. Lord Grey hastened to the palace.\n\nBefore the result of this appeal to the Sovereign was known, for its\neffects were not immediate, on the second morning after the vote in the\nHouse of Lords, Mr. Rigby had made that visit to Eton which had summoned\nvery unexpectedly the youthful Coningsby to London. He was the orphan\nchild of the youngest of the two sons of the Marquess of Monmouth. It\nwas a family famous for its hatreds. The eldest son hated his father;\nand, it was said, in spite had married a lady to whom that father was\nattached, and with whom Lord Monmouth then meditated a second alliance.\nThis eldest son lived at Naples, and had several children, but\nmaintained no connection either with his parent or his native country.\nOn the other hand, Lord Monmouth hated his younger son, who had married,\nagainst his consent, a woman to whom that son was devoted. A system of\ndomestic persecution, sustained by the hand of a master, had eventually\nbroken up the health of its victim, who died of a fever in a foreign\ncountry, where he had sought some refuge from his creditors.\n\nHis widow returned to England with her child; and, not having a\nrelation, and scarcely an acquaintance in the world, made an appeal to\nher husband's father, the wealthiest noble in England and a man who was\noften prodigal, and occasionally generous. After some time, and\nmore trouble, after urgent and repeated, and what would have seemed\nheart-rending, solicitations, the attorney of Lord Monmouth called\nupon the widow of his client's son, and informed her of his Lordship's\ndecision. Provided she gave up her child, and permanently resided in\none of the remotest counties, he was authorised to make her, in four\nquarterly payments, the yearly allowance of three hundred pounds, that\nbeing the income that Lord Monmouth, who was the shrewdest accountant in\nthe country, had calculated a lone woman might very decently exist upon\nin a small market town in the county of Westmoreland.\n\nDesperate necessity, the sense of her own forlornness, the utter\nimpossibility to struggle with an omnipotent foe, who, her husband had\ntaught her, was above all scruples, prejudices, and fears, and who,\nthough he respected law, despised opinion, made the victim yield. But\nher sufferings were not long; the separation from her child, the bleak\nclime, the strange faces around her, sharp memory, and the dull routine\nof an unimpassioned life, all combined to wear out a constitution\noriginally frail, and since shattered by many sorrows. Mrs. Coningsby\ndied the same day that her father-in-law was made a Marquess. He\ndeserved his honours. The four votes he had inherited in the House of\nCommons had been increased, by his intense volition and unsparing means,\nto ten; and the very day he was raised to his Marquisate, he commenced\nsapping fresh corporations, and was working for the strawberry leaf. His\nhonours were proclaimed in the London Gazette, and her decease was not\neven noticed in the County Chronicle; but the altars of Nemesis are\nbeneath every outraged roof, and the death of this unhappy lady,\napparently without an earthly friend or an earthly hope, desolate and\ndeserted, and dying in obscure poverty, was not forgotten.\n\nConingsby was not more than nine years of age when he lost his last\nparent; and he had then been separated from her for nearly three years.\nBut he remembered the sweetness of his nursery days. His mother,\ntoo, had written to him frequently since he quitted her, and her fond\nexpressions had cherished the tenderness of his heart. He wept bitterly\nwhen his schoolmaster broke to him the news of his mother's death. True\nit was they had been long parted, and their prospect of again meeting\nwas vague and dim; but his mother seemed to him his only link to human\nsociety. It was something to have a mother, even if he never saw her.\nOther boys went to see their mothers! he, at least, could talk of his.\nNow he was alone. His grandfather was to him only a name. Lord Monmouth\nresided almost constantly abroad, and during his rare visits to England\nhad found no time or inclination to see the orphan, with whom he felt\nno sympathy. Even the death of the boy's mother, and the consequent\narrangements, were notified to his master by a stranger. The letter\nwhich brought the sad intelligence was from Mr. Rigby. It was the first\ntime that name had been known to Coningsby.\n\nMr. Rigby was member for one of Lord Monmouth's boroughs. He was the\nmanager of Lord Monmouth's parliamentary influence, and the auditor of\nhis vast estates. He was more; he was Lord Monmouth's companion when in\nEngland, his correspondent when abroad; hardly his counsellor, for Lord\nMonmouth never required advice; but Mr. Rigby could instruct him\nin matters of detail, which Mr. Rigby made amusing. Rigby was not a\nprofessional man; indeed, his origin, education, early pursuits, and\nstudies, were equally obscure; but he had contrived in good time to\nsqueeze himself into parliament, by means which no one could ever\ncomprehend, and then set up to be a perfect man of business. The world\ntook him at his word, for he was bold, acute, and voluble; with no\nthought, but a good deal of desultory information; and though destitute\nof all imagination and noble sentiment, was blessed with a vigorous,\nmendacious fancy, fruitful in small expedients, and never happier than\nwhen devising shifts for great men's scrapes.\n\nThey say that all of us have one chance in this life, and so it was with\nRigby. After a struggle of many years, after a long series of the\nusual alternatives of small successes and small failures, after a\nfew cleverish speeches and a good many cleverish pamphlets, with a\nconsiderable reputation, indeed, for pasquinades, most of which he\nnever wrote, and articles in reviews to which it was whispered he had\ncontributed, Rigby, who had already intrigued himself into a subordinate\noffice, met with Lord Monmouth.\n\nHe was just the animal that Lord Monmouth wanted, for Lord Monmouth\nalways looked upon human nature with the callous eye of a jockey. He\nsurveyed Rigby; and he determined to buy him. He bought him; with his\nclear head, his indefatigable industry, his audacious tongue, and his\nready and unscrupulous pen; with all his dates, all his lampoons; all\nhis private memoirs, and all his political intrigues. It was a good\npurchase. Rigby became a great personage, and Lord Monmouth's man.\n\nMr. Rigby, who liked to be doing a great many things at the same time,\nand to astonish the Tadpoles and Tapers with his energetic versatility,\ndetermined to superintend the education of Coningsby. It was a relation\nwhich identified him with the noble house of his pupil, or, properly\nspeaking, his charge: for Mr. Rigby affected rather the graceful dignity\nof the governor than the duties of a tutor. The boy was recalled\nfrom his homely, rural school, where he had been well grounded by\na hard-working curate, and affectionately tended by the curate's\nunsophisticated wife. He was sent to a fashionable school preparatory\nto Eton, where he found about two hundred youths of noble families\nand connections, lodged in a magnificent villa, that had once been\nthe retreat of a minister, superintended by a sycophantic Doctor of\nDivinity, already well beneficed, and not despairing of a bishopric by\nfavouring the children of the great nobles. The doctor's lady, clothed\nin cashmeres, sometimes inquired after their health, and occasionally\nreceived a report as to their linen.\n\nMr. Rigby had a classical retreat, not distant from this establishment,\nwhich he esteemed a Tusculum. There, surrounded by his busts and books,\nhe wrote his lampoons and articles; massacred a she liberal (it was\nthought that no one could lash a woman like Rigby), cut up a rising\ngenius whose politics were different from his own, or scarified some\nunhappy wretch who had brought his claims before parliament, proving,\nby garbled extracts from official correspondence that no one could refer\nto, that the malcontent instead of being a victim, was, on the contrary,\na defaulter. Tadpole and Taper would back Rigby for a 'slashing reply'\nagainst the field. Here, too, at the end of a busy week, he found it\noccasionally convenient to entertain a clever friend or two of equivocal\nreputation, with whom he had become acquainted in former days of equal\nbrotherhood. No one was more faithful to his early friends than Mr.\nRigby, particularly if they could write a squib.\n\nIt was in this refined retirement that Mr. Rigby found time enough,\nsnatched from the toils of official life and parliamentary struggles,\nto compose a letter on the study of History, addressed to Coningsby.\nThe style was as much like that of Lord Bolingbroke as if it had been\nwritten by the authors of the 'Rejected Addresses,' and it began, 'My\ndear young friend.' This polished composition, so full of good feeling\nand comprehensive views, and all in the best taste, was not published.\nIt was only privately printed, and a few thousand copies were\ndistributed among select personages as an especial favour and mark\nof high consideration. Each copy given away seemed to Rigby like a\ncertificate of character; a property which, like all men of dubious\nrepute, he thoroughly appreciated. Rigby intrigued very much that the\nheadmaster of Eton should adopt his discourse as a class-book. For this\npurpose he dined with the Doctor, told him several anecdotes of the\nKing, which intimated personal influence at Windsor; but the headmaster\nwas inflexible, and so Mr. Rigby was obliged to be content with\nhaving his Letter on History canonized as a classic in the Preparatory\nSeminary, where the individual to whom it was addressed was a scholar.\n\nThis change in the life of Coningsby contributed to his happiness. The\nvarious characters which a large school exhibited interested a young\nmind whose active energies were beginning to stir. His previous\nacquirements made his studies light; and he was fond of sports, in which\nhe was qualified to excel. He did not particularly like Mr. Rigby. There\nwas something jarring and grating in that gentleman's voice and modes,\nfrom which the chords of the young heart shrank. He was not tender,\nthough perhaps he wished to be; scarcely kind: but he was good-natured,\nat least to children. However, this connection was, on the whole, an\nagreeable one for Coningsby. He seemed suddenly to have friends: he\nnever passed his holydays again at school. Mr. Rigby was so clever that\nhe contrived always to quarter Coningsby on the father of one of his\nschool-fellows, for Mr. Rigby knew all his school-fellows and all their\nfathers. Mr. Rigby also called to see him, not unfrequently would give\nhim a dinner at the Star and Garter, or even have him up to town for\na week to Whitehall. Compared with his former forlorn existence, these\nwere happy days, when he was placed under the gallery as a member's son,\nor went to the play with the butler!\n\nWhen Coningsby had attained his twelfth year, an order was received from\nLord Monmouth, who was at Rome, that he should go at once to Eton.\nThis was the first great epoch of his life. There never was a youth\nwho entered into that wonderful little world with more eager zest than\nConingsby. Nor was it marvellous.\n\nThat delicious plain, studded with every creation of graceful\nculture; hamlet and hall and grange; garden and grove and park; that\ncastle-palace, grey with glorious ages; those antique spires, hoar with\nfaith and wisdom, the chapel and the college; that river winding through\nthe shady meads; the sunny glade and the solemn avenue; the room in the\nDame's house where we first order our own breakfast and first feel we\nare free; the stirring multitude, the energetic groups, the individual\nmind that leads, conquers, controls; the emulation and the affection;\nthe noble strife and the tender sentiment; the daring exploit and the\ndashing scrape; the passion that pervades our life, and breathes in\neverything, from the aspiring study to the inspiring sport: oh! what\nhereafter can spur the brain and touch the heart like this; can give us\na world so deeply and variously interesting; a life so full of quick and\nbright excitement, passed in a scene so fair?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nLord Monmouth, who detested popular tumults as much as he despised\npublic opinion, had remained during the agitating year of 1831 in his\nluxurious retirement in Italy, contenting himself with opposing the\nReform Bill by proxy. But when his correspondent, Mr. Rigby, had\ninformed him, in the early part of the spring of 1832, of the\nprobability of a change in the tactics of the Tory party, and that\nan opinion was becoming prevalent among their friends, that the great\nscheme must be defeated in detail rather than again withstood on\nprinciple, his Lordship, who was never wanting in energy when his own\ninterests were concerned, immediately crossed the Alps, and travelled\nrapidly to England. He indulged a hope that the weight of his presence\nand the influence of his strong character, which was at once shrewd and\ncourageous, might induce his friends to relinquish their half measure,\na course to which his nature was repugnant. At all events, if they\npersisted in their intention, and the Bill went into committee, his\npresence was indispensable, for in that stage of a parliamentary\nproceeding proxies become ineffective.\n\nThe counsels of Lord Monmouth, though they coincided with those of the\nDuke of Wellington, did not prevail with the Waverers. Several of these\nhigh-minded personages had had their windows broken, and they were of\nopinion that a man who lived at Naples was not a competent judge of the\nstate of public feeling in England. Besides, the days are gone by for\nsenates to have their beards plucked in the forum. We live in an age of\nprudence. The leaders of the people, now, generally follow. The truth\nis, the peers were in a fright. 'Twas a pity; there is scarcely a less\ndignified entity than a patrician in a panic.\n\nAmong the most intimate companions of Coningsby at Eton, was Lord Henry\nSydney, his kinsman. Coningsby had frequently passed his holydays of\nlate at Beaumanoir, the seat of the Duke, Lord Henry's father. The\nDuke sat next to Lord Monmouth during the debate on the enfranchising\nquestion, and to while away the time, and from kindness of disposition,\nspoke, and spoke with warmth and favour, of his grandson. The polished\nLord Monmouth bowed as if he were much gratified by this notice of one\nso dear to him. He had too much tact to admit that he had never yet\nseen his grandchild; but he asked some questions as to his progress\nand pursuits, his tastes and habits, which intimated the interest of an\naffectionate relative.\n\nNothing, however, was ever lost upon Lord Monmouth. No one had a more\nretentive memory, or a more observant mind. And the next day, when he\nreceived Mr. Rigby at his morning levee, Lord Monmouth performed this\nceremony in the high style of the old court, and welcomed his visitors\nin bed, he said with imperturbable calmness, and as if he had been\ntalking of trying a new horse, 'Rigby, I should like to see the boy at\nEton.'\n\nThere might be some objection to grant leave to Coningsby at this\nmoment; but it was a rule with Mr. Rigby never to make difficulties, or\nat least to persuade his patron that he, and he only, could remove\nthem. He immediately undertook that the boy should be forthcoming, and\nnotwithstanding the excitement of the moment, he went off next morning\nto fetch him.\n\nThey arrived in town rather early; and Rigby, wishing to know how\naffairs were going on, ordered the servant to drive immediately to the\nhead-quarters of the party; where a permanent committee watched every\nphasis of the impending revolution; and where every member of the\nOpposition, of note and trust, was instantly admitted to receive or to\nimpart intelligence.\n\nIt was certainly not without emotion that Coningsby contemplated his\nfirst interview with his grandfather. All his experience of the ties of\nrelationship, however limited, was full of tenderness and rapture. His\nmemory often dwelt on his mother's sweet embrace; and ever and anon a\nfitful phantom of some past passage of domestic love haunted his gushing\nheart. The image of his father was less fresh in his mind; but still\nit was associated with a vague sentiment of kindness and joy; and the\nallusions to her husband in his mother's letters had cherished these\nimpressions. To notice lesser sources of influence in his estimate of\nthe domestic tie, he had witnessed under the roof of Beaumanoir the\nexistence of a family bound together by the most beautiful affections.\nHe could not forget how Henry Sydney was embraced by his sisters when he\nreturned home; what frank and fraternal love existed between his kinsman\nand his elder brother; how affectionately the kind Duke had welcomed his\nson once more to the house where they had both been born; and the dim\neyes, and saddened brows, and tones of tenderness, which rather looked\nthan said farewell, when they went back to Eton.\n\nAnd these rapturous meetings and these mournful adieus were occasioned\nonly by a separation at the most of a few months, softened by constant\ncorrespondence and the communication of mutual sympathy. But Coningsby\nwas to meet a relation, his near, almost his only, relation, for the\nfirst time; the relation, too, to whom he owed maintenance, education;\nit might be said, existence. It was a great incident for a great drama;\nsomething tragical in the depth and stir of its emotions. Even the\nimagination of the boy could not be insensible to its materials; and\nConingsby was picturing to himself a beneficent and venerable gentleman\npressing to his breast an agitated youth, when his reverie was broken by\nthe carriage stopping before the gates of Monmouth House.\n\nThe gates were opened by a gigantic Swiss, and the carriage rolled into\na huge court-yard. At its end Coningsby beheld a Palladian palace, with\nwings and colonnades encircling the court.\n\nA double flight of steps led into a circular and marble hall, adorned\nwith colossal busts of the Caesars; the staircase in fresco by Sir James\nThornhill, breathed with the loves and wars of gods and heroes. It led\ninto a vestibule, painted in arabesques, hung with Venetian girandoles,\nand looking into gardens. Opening a door in this chamber, and proceeding\nsome little way down a corridor, Mr. Rigby and his companion arrived at\nthe base of a private staircase. Ascending a few steps, they reached a\nlanding-place hung with tapestry. Drawing this aside, Mr. Rigby opened a\ndoor, and ushered Coningsby through an ante-chamber into a small saloon,\nof beautiful proportions, and furnished in a brilliant and delicate\ntaste.\n\n'You will find more to amuse you here than where you were before,' said\nMr. Rigby, 'and I shall not be nearly so long absent.' So saying, he\nentered into an inner apartment.\n\nThe walls of the saloon, which were covered with light blue satin, held,\nin silver panels, portraits of beautiful women, painted by Boucher.\nCouches and easy chairs of every shape invited in every quarter to\nluxurious repose; while amusement was afforded by tables covered with\ncaricatures, French novels, and endless miniatures of foreign dancers,\nprincesses, and sovereigns.\n\nBut Coningsby was so impressed with the impending interview with his\ngrandfather, that he neither sought nor required diversion. Now that the\ncrisis was at hand, he felt agitated and nervous, and wished that he was\nagain at Eton. The suspense was sickening, yet he dreaded still more the\nsummons. He was not long alone; the door opened; he started, grew pale;\nhe thought it was his grandfather; it was not even Mr. Rigby. It was\nLord Monmouth's valet.\n\n'Monsieur Konigby?'\n\n'My name is Coningsby,' said the boy.\n\n'Milor is ready to receive you,' said the valet.\n\nConingsby sprang forward with that desperation which the scaffold\nrequires. His face was pale; his hand was moist; his heart beat with\ntumult. He had occasionally been summoned by Dr. Keate; that, too,\nwas awful work, but compared with the present, a morning visit. Music,\nartillery, the roar of cannon, and the blare of trumpets, may urge a man\non to a forlorn hope; ambition, one's constituents, the hell of previous\nfailure, may prevail on us to do a more desperate thing; speak in the\nHouse of Commons; but there are some situations in life, such, for\ninstance, as entering the room of a dentist, in which the prostration of\nthe nervous system is absolute.\n\nThe moment had at length arrived when the desolate was to find a\nbenefactor, the forlorn a friend, the orphan a parent; when the youth,\nafter a childhood of adversity, was to be formally received into the\nbosom of the noble house from which he had been so long estranged, and\nat length to assume that social position to which his lineage entitled\nhim. Manliness might support, affection might soothe, the happy anguish\nof such a meeting; but it was undoubtedly one of those situations\nwhich stir up the deep fountains of our nature, and before which the\nconventional proprieties of our ordinary manners instantaneously vanish.\n\nConingsby with an uncertain step followed his guide through a\nbed-chamber, the sumptuousness of which he could not notice, into\nthe dressing-room of Lord Monmouth. Mr. Rigby, facing Coningsby as\nhe entered, was leaning over the back of a large chair, from which as\nConingsby was announced by the valet, the Lord of the house slowly rose,\nfor he was suffering slightly from the gout, his left hand resting on\nan ivory stick. Lord Monmouth was in height above the middle size, but\nsomewhat portly and corpulent. His countenance was strongly marked;\nsagacity on the brow, sensuality in the mouth and jaw. His head was\nbald, but there were remains of the rich brown locks on which he once\nprided himself. His large deep blue eye, madid and yet piercing,\nshowed that the secretions of his brain were apportioned, half to\nvoluptuousness, half to common sense. But his general mien was truly\ngrand; full of a natural nobility, of which no one was more sensible\nthan himself. Lord Monmouth was not in dishabille; on the contrary, his\ncostume was exact, and even careful. Rising as we have mentioned when\nhis grandson entered, and leaning with his left hand on his ivory cane,\nhe made Coningsby such a bow as Louis Quatorze might have bestowed on\nthe ambassador of the United Provinces. Then extending his right hand,\nwhich the boy tremblingly touched, Lord Monmouth said:\n\n'How do you like Eton?'\n\nThis contrast to the reception which he had imagined, hoped, feared,\nparalysed the reviving energies of young Coningsby. He felt stupefied;\nhe looked almost aghast. In the chaotic tumult of his mind, his memory\nsuddenly seemed to receive some miraculous inspiration. Mysterious\nphrases heard in his earliest boyhood, unnoticed then, long since\nforgotten, rose to his ear. Who was this grandfather, seen not before,\nseen now for the first time? Where was the intervening link of blood\nbetween him and this superb and icy being? The boy sank into the chair\nwhich had been placed for him, and leaning on the table burst into\ntears.\n\nHere was a business! If there were one thing which would have made Lord\nMonmouth travel from London to Naples at four-and-twenty hours' notice,\nit was to avoid a scene. He hated scenes. He hated feelings. He saw\ninstantly the mistake he had made in sending for his grandchild. He\nwas afraid that Coningsby was tender-hearted like his father. Another\ntender-hearted Coningsby! Unfortunate family! Degenerate race! He\ndecided in his mind that Coningsby must be provided for in the Church,\nand looked at Mr. Rigby, whose principal business it always was to\ndisembarrass his patron from the disagreeable.\n\nMr. Rigby instantly came forward and adroitly led the boy into the\nadjoining apartment, Lord Monmouth's bedchamber, closing the door of the\ndressing-room behind him.\n\n'My dear young friend,' said Mr. Rigby, 'what is all this?'\n\nA sob the only answer.\n\n'What can be the matter?' said Mr. Rigby.\n\n'I was thinking,' said Coningsby, 'of poor mamma!'\n\n'Hush!' said Mr. Rigby; 'Lord Monmouth never likes to hear of people\nwho are dead; so you must take care never to mention your mother or your\nfather.'\n\nIn the meantime Lord Monmouth had decided on the fate of Coningsby. The\nMarquis thought he could read characters by a glance, and in general\nhe was successful, for his natural sagacity had been nurtured by great\nexperience. His grandson was not to his taste; amiable no doubt, but\nspooney.\n\nWe are too apt to believe that the character of a boy is easily read.\n'Tis a mystery the most profound. Mark what blunders parents constantly\nmake as to the nature of their own offspring, bred, too, under their\neyes, and displaying every hour their characteristics. How often in the\nnursery does the genius count as a dunce because he is pensive; while a\nrattling urchin is invested with almost supernatural qualities because\nhis animal spirits make him impudent and flippant! The school-boy, above\nall others, is not the simple being the world imagines. In that young\nbosom are often stirring passions as strong as our own, desires not less\nviolent, a volition not less supreme. In that young bosom what burning\nlove, what intense ambition, what avarice, what lust of power; envy that\nfiends might emulate, hate that man might fear!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n'Come,' said Mr. Rigby, when Coningsby was somewhat composed, 'come with\nme and we will see the house.'\n\nSo they descended once more the private staircase, and again entered the\nvestibule.\n\n'If you had seen these gardens when they were illuminated for a f\u00c3\u00aate to\nGeorge IV.,' said Rigby, as crossing the chamber he ushered his charge\ninto the state apartments. The splendour and variety of the surrounding\nobjects soon distracted the attention of the boy, for the first time in\nthe palace of his fathers. He traversed saloon after saloon hung with\nrare tapestry and the gorgeous products of foreign looms; filled with\nchoice pictures and creations of curious art; cabinets that sovereigns\nmight envy, and colossal vases of malachite presented by emperors.\nConingsby alternately gazed up to ceilings glowing with color and with\ngold, and down upon carpets bright with the fancies and vivid with the\ntints of Aubusson and of Axminster.\n\n'This grandfather of mine is a great prince,' thought Coningsby, as\nmusing he stood before a portrait in which he recognised the features of\nthe being from whom he had so recently and so strangely parted. There\nhe stood, Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, in his robes of state,\nwith his new coronet on a table near him, a despatch lying at hand that\nindicated the special mission of high ceremony of which he had been the\nillustrious envoy, and the garter beneath his knee.\n\n'You will have plenty of opportunities to look at the pictures,' said\nRigby, observing that the boy had now quite recovered himself. 'Some\nluncheon will do you no harm after our drive;' and he opened the door of\nanother apartment.\n\nIt was a pretty room adorned with a fine picture of the chase; at a\nround table in the centre sat two ladies interested in the meal to which\nRigby had alluded.\n\n'Ah, Mr. Rigby!' said the eldest, yet young and beautiful, and speaking,\nthough with fluency, in a foreign accent, 'come and tell me some news.\nHave you seen Milor?' and then she threw a scrutinizing glance from a\ndark flashing eye at his companion.\n\n'Let me present to your Highness,' said Rigby, with an air of some\nceremony, 'Mr. Coningsby.'\n\n'My dear young friend,' said the lady, extending her white hand with\nan air of joyous welcome, 'this is Lucretia, my daughter. We love you\nalready. Lord Monmouth will be so charmed to see you. What beautiful\neyes he has, Mr. Rigby. Quite like Milor.'\n\nThe young lady, who was really more youthful than Coningsby, but of a\nform and stature so developed that she appeared almost a woman, bowed\nto the guest with some ceremony, and a faint sullen smile, and then\nproceeded with her Perigord pie.\n\n'You must be so hungry after your drive,' said the elder lady, placing\nConingsby at her side, and herself filling his plate.\n\nThis was true enough; and while Mr. Rigby and the lady talked an\ninfinite deal about things which he did not understand, and persons\nof whom he had never heard, our little hero made his first meal in his\npaternal house with no ordinary zest; and renovated by the pasty and\na glass of sherry, felt altogether a different being from what he\nwas, when he had undergone the terrible interview in which he began to\nreflect he had considerably exposed himself. His courage revived,\nhis senses rallied, he replied to the interrogations of the lady with\ncalmness, but with promptness and propriety. It was evident that he had\nmade a favourable impression on her Highness, for ever and anon she put\na truffle or some delicacy in his plate, and insisted upon his taking\nsome particular confectionery, because it was a favourite of her own.\nWhen she rose, she said,--\n\n'In ten minutes the carriage will be at the door; and if you like, my\ndear young friend, you shall be our beau.'\n\n'There is nothing I should like so much,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Ah!' said the lady, with the sweetest smile, 'he is frank.'\n\nThe ladies bowed and retired; Mr. Rigby returned to the Marquess, and\nthe groom of the chambers led Coningsby to his room.\n\nThis lady, so courteous to Coningsby, was the Princess Colonna, a Roman\ndame, the second wife of Prince Paul Colonna. The prince had first\nmarried when a boy, and into a family not inferior to his own. Of this\nunion, in every respect unhappy, the Princess Lucretia was the sole\noffspring. He was a man dissolute and devoted to play; and cared for\nnothing much but his pleasures and billiards, in which latter he was\nesteemed unrivalled. According to some, in a freak of passion, according\nto others, to cancel a gambling debt, he had united himself to his\npresent wife, whose origin was obscure; but with whom he contrived to\nlive on terms of apparent cordiality, for she was much admired, and\nmade the society of her husband sought by those who contributed to his\nenjoyment. Among these especially figured the Marquess of Monmouth,\nbetween whom and Prince Colonna the world recognised as existing the\nmost intimate and entire friendship, so that his Highness and his family\nwere frequent guests under the roof of the English nobleman, and now\naccompanied him on a visit to England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nIn the meantime, while ladies are luncheoning on Perigord pie, or\ncoursing in whirling britskas, performing all the singular ceremonies of\na London morning in the heart of the season; making visits where nobody\nis seen, and making purchases which are not wanted; the world is in\nagitation and uproar. At present the world and the confusion are limited\nto St. James's Street and Pall Mall; but soon the boundaries and the\ntumult will be extended to the intended metropolitan boroughs; to-morrow\nthey will spread over the manufacturing districts. It is perfectly\nevident, that before eight-and-forty hours have passed, the country will\nbe in a state of fearful crisis. And how can it be otherwise? Is it not\na truth that the subtle Chief Baron has been closeted one whole hour\nwith the King; that shortly after, with thoughtful brow and compressed\nlip, he was marked in his daring chariot entering the courtyard of\nApsley House? Great was the panic at Brookes', wild the hopes of\nCarlton Terrace; all the gentlemen who expected to have been made peers\nperceived that the country was going to be given over to a rapacious\noligarchy.\n\nIn the meantime Tadpole and Taper, who had never quitted for an instant\nthe mysterious head-quarters of the late Opposition, were full of\nhopes and fears, and asked many questions, which they chiefly answered\nthemselves.\n\n'I wonder what Lord Lyndhurst will say to the king,' said Taper.\n\n'He has plenty of pluck,' said Tadpole.\n\n'I almost wish now that Rigby had breakfasted with him this morning,'\nsaid Taper.\n\n'If the King be firm, and the country sound,' said Tadpole, 'and Lord\nMonmouth keep his boroughs, I should not wonder to see Rigby made a\nprivy councillor.'\n\n'There is no precedent for an under-secretary being a privy councillor,'\nsaid Taper.\n\n'But we live in revolutionary times,' said Tadpole.\n\n'Gentlemen,' said the groom of the chambers, in a loud voice, entering\nthe room, 'I am desired to state that the Duke of Wellington is with the\nKing.'\n\n'There _is_ a Providence!' exclaimed an agitated gentleman, the patent\nof whose intended peerage had not been signed the day that the Duke had\nquited office in 1830.\n\n'I always thought the King would be firm,' said Mr. Tadpole.\n\n'I wonder who will have the India Board,' said Taper.\n\nAt this moment three or four gentlemen entered the room in a state of\ngreat bustle and excitement; they were immediately surrounded.\n\n'Is it true?' 'Quite true; not the slightest doubt. Saw him myself. Not\nat all hissed; certainly not hooted. Perhaps a little hissed. One\nfellow really cheered him. Saw him myself. Say what they like, there is\nreaction.' 'But Constitution Hill, they say?' 'Well, there was a sort\nof inclination to a row on Constitution Hill; but the Duke quite firm;\npistols, and carriage doors bolted.'\n\nSuch may give a faint idea of the anxious inquiries and the satisfactory\nreplies that were occasioned by the entrance of this group.\n\n'Up, guards, and at them!' exclaimed Tadpole, rubbing his hands in a fit\nof patriotic enthusiasm.\n\nLater in the afternoon, about five o'clock, the high change of political\ngossip, when the room was crowded, and every one had his rumour, Mr.\nRigby looked in again to throw his eye over the evening papers, and\ncatch in various chit-chat the tone of public or party feeling on the\n'crisis.' Then it was known that the Duke had returned from the\nKing, having accepted the charge of forming an administration. An\nadministration to do what? Portentous question! Were concessions to\nbe made? And if so, what? Was it altogether impossible, and too late,\n'stare super vias antiquas?' Questions altogether above your Tadpoles\nand your Tapers, whose idea of the necessities of the age was that they\nthemselves should be in office.\n\nLord Eskdale came up to Mr. Rigby. This peer was a noble Croesus,\nacquainted with all the gradations of life; a voluptuary who could be a\nSpartan; clear-sighted, unprejudiced, sagacious; the best judge in the\nworld of a horse or a man; he was the universal referee; a quarrel about\na bet or a mistress was solved by him in a moment, and in a manner which\nsatisfied both parties. He patronised and appreciated the fine arts,\nthough a jockey; respected literary men, though he only read French\nnovels; and without any affectation of tastes which he did not possess,\nwas looked upon by every singer and dancer in Europe as their natural\nchampion. The secret of his strong character and great influence was his\nself-composure, which an earthquake or a Reform Bill could not disturb,\nand which in him was the result of temperament and experience. He was\nan intimate acquaintance of Lord Monmouth, for they had many tastes\nin common; were both men of considerable, and in some degree similar\nabilities; and were the two greatest proprietors of close boroughs in\nthe country.\n\n'Do you dine at Monmouth House to-day?' inquired Lord Eskdale of Mr.\nRigby.\n\n'Where I hope to meet your lordship. The Whig papers are very subdued,'\ncontinued Mr. Rigby.\n\n'Ah! they have not the cue yet,' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'And what do you think of affairs?' inquired his companion.\n\n'I think the hounds are too hot to hark off now,' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'There is one combination,' said Rigby, who seemed meditating an attack\non Lord Eskdale's button.\n\n'Give it us at dinner,' said Lord Eskdale, who knew his man, and made an\nadroit movement forwards, as if he were very anxious to see the _Globe_\nnewspaper.\n\nIn the course of two or three hours these gentlemen met again in the\ngreen drawing-room of Monmouth House. Mr. Rigby was sitting on a sofa\nby Lord Monmouth, detailing in whispers all his gossip of the morn:\nLord Eskdale murmuring quaint inquiries into the ear of the Princess\nLucretia.\n\nMadame Colonna made remarks alternately to two gentlemen, who paid her\nassiduous court. One of these was Mr. Ormsby; the school, the college,\nand the club crony of Lord Monmouth, who had been his shadow through\nlife; travelled with him in early days, won money with him at play, had\nbeen his colleague in the House of Commons; and was still one of his\nnominees. Mr. Ormsby was a millionaire, which Lord Monmouth liked. He\nliked his companions to be very rich or very poor; be his equals, able\nto play with him at high stakes, or join him in a great speculation; or\nto be his tools, and to amuse and serve him. There was nothing which he\ndespised and disliked so much as a moderate fortune.\n\nThe other gentleman was of a different class and character. Nature had\nintended Lucian Gay for a scholar and a wit; necessity had made him a\nscribbler and a buffoon. He had distinguished himself at the University;\nbut he had no patrimony, nor those powers of perseverance which success\nin any learned profession requires. He was good-looking, had great\nanimal spirits, and a keen sense of enjoyment, and could not drudge.\nMoreover he had a fine voice, and sang his own songs with considerable\ntaste; accomplishments which made his fortune in society and completed\nhis ruin. In due time he extricated himself from the bench and merged\ninto journalism, by means of which he chanced to become acquainted with\nMr. Rigby. That worthy individual was not slow in detecting the treasure\nhe had lighted on; a wit, a ready and happy writer, a joyous and\ntractable being, with the education, and still the feelings and manners,\nof a gentleman. Frequent were the Sunday dinners which found Gay a\nguest at Mr. Rigby's villa; numerous the airy pasquinades which he\nleft behind, and which made the fortune of his patron. Flattered by\nthe familiar acquaintance of a man of station, and sanguine that he had\nfound the link which would sooner or later restore him to the polished\nworld that he had forfeited, Gay laboured in his vocation with\nenthusiasm and success. Willingly would Rigby have kept his treasure\nto himself; and truly he hoarded it for a long time, but it oozed out.\nRigby loved the reputation of possessing the complete art of\nsociety. His dinners were celebrated at least for their guests. Great\nintellectual illustrations were found there blended with rank and high\nstation. Rigby loved to patronise; to play the minister unbending and\nseeking relief from the cares of council in the society of authors,\nartists, and men of science. He liked dukes to dine with him and hear\nhim scatter his audacious criticisms to Sir Thomas or Sir Humphry.\nThey went away astounded by the powers of their host, who, had he not\nfortunately devoted those powers to their party, must apparently have\nrivalled Vandyke, or discovered the safety-lamp.\n\nNow in these dinners, Lucian Gay, who had brilliant conversational\npowers, and who possessed all the resources of boon companionship, would\nbe an invaluable ally. He was therefore admitted, and inspired both\nby the present enjoyment, and the future to which it might lead, his\nexertions were untiring, various, most successful. Rigby's dinners\nbecame still, more celebrated. It, however, necessarily followed that\nthe guests who were charmed by Gay, wished Gay also to be their guest.\nRigby was very jealous of this, but it was inevitable; still by constant\nmanoeuvre, by intimations of some exercise, some day or other, of\nsubstantial patronage in his behalf, by a thousand little arts by\nwhich he carved out work for Gay which often prevented him accepting\ninvitations to great houses in the country, by judicious loans of\nsmall sums on Lucian's notes of hand and other analogous devices, Rigby\ncontrived to keep the wit in a fair state of bondage and dependence.\n\nOne thing Rigby was resolved on: Gay should never get into Monmouth\nHouse. That was an empyrean too high for his wing to soar in. Rigby kept\nthat social monopoly distinctively to mark the relation that subsisted\nbetween them as patron and client. It was something to swagger about\nwhen they were together after their second bottle of claret. Rigby kept\nhis resolution for some years, which the frequent and prolonged absence\nof the Marquess rendered not very difficult. But we are the creatures\nof circumstances; at least the Rigby race particularly. Lord Monmouth\nreturned to England one year, and wanted to be amused. He wanted a\njester: a man about him who would make him, not laugh, for that was\nimpossible, but smile more frequently, tell good stories, say good\nthings, and sing now and then, especially French songs. Early in life\nRigby would have attempted all this, though he had neither fun, voice,\nnor ear. But his hold on Lord Monmouth no longer depended on the mere\nexercise of agreeable qualities, he had become indispensable to his\nlordship, by more serious if not higher considerations. And what with\nauditing his accounts, guarding his boroughs, writing him, when absent,\ngossip by every post and when in England deciding on every question and\narranging every matter which might otherwise have ruffled the sublime\nrepose of his patron's existence, Rigby might be excused if he shrank a\nlittle from the minor part of table wit, particularly when we remember\nall his subterranean journalism, his acid squibs, and his malicious\nparagraphs, and, what Tadpole called, his 'slashing articles.'\n\nThese 'slashing articles' were, indeed, things which, had they appeared\nas anonymous pamphlets, would have obtained the contemptuous reception\nwhich in an intellectual view no compositions more surely deserved; but\nwhispered as the productions of one behind the scenes, and appearing in\nthe pages of a party review, they were passed off as genuine coin, and\ntook in great numbers of the lieges, especially in the country. They\nwere written in a style apparently modelled on the briefs of those sharp\nattorneys who weary advocates with their clever commonplace; teasing\nwith obvious comment, and torturing with inevitable inference. The\naffectation of order in the statement of facts had all the lucid method\nof an adroit pettifogger. They dealt much in extracts from newspapers,\nquotations from the _Annual Register_, parallel passages in forgotten\nspeeches, arranged with a formidable array of dates rarely accurate.\nWhen the writer was of opinion he had made a point, you may be sure\nthe hit was in italics, that last resource of the Forcible Feebles. He\nhandled a particular in chronology as if he were proving an alibi at\nthe Criminal Court. The censure was coarse without being strong, and\nvindictive when it would have been sarcastic. Now and then there was\na passage which aimed at a higher flight, and nothing can be conceived\nmore unlike genuine feeling, or more offensive to pure taste. And\nyet, perhaps, the most ludicrous characteristic of these facetious\ngallimaufreys was an occasional assumption of the high moral and\nadmonitory tone, which when we recurred to the general spirit of\nthe discourse, and were apt to recall the character of its writer,\nirresistibly reminded one of Mrs. Cole and her prayer-book.\n\nTo return to Lucian Gay. It was a rule with Rigby that no one, if\npossible, should do anything for Lord Monmouth but himself; and as a\njester must be found, he was determined that his Lordship should have\nthe best in the market, and that he should have the credit of furnishing\nthe article. As a reward, therefore, for many past services, and a fresh\nclaim to his future exertions, Rigby one day broke to Gay that the hour\nhad at length arrived when the highest object of reasonable ambition\non his part, and the fulfilment of one of Rigby's long-cherished and\ndearest hopes, were alike to be realised. Gay was to be presented to\nLord Monmouth and dine at Monmouth House.\n\nThe acquaintance was a successful one; very agreeable to both parties.\nGay became an habitual guest of Lord Monmouth when his patron was in\nEngland; and in his absence received frequent and substantial marks\nof his kind recollection, for Lord Monmouth was generous to those who\namused him.\n\nIn the meantime the hour of dinner is at hand. Coningsby, who had lost\nthe key of his carpet-bag, which he finally cut open with a penknife\nthat he found on his writing-table, and the blade of which he broke\nin the operation, only reached the drawing-room as the figure of his\ngrandfather, leaning on his ivory cane, and following his guests,\nwas just visible in the distance. He was soon overtaken. Perceiving\nConingsby, Lord Monmouth made him a bow, not so formal a one as in the\nmorning, but still a bow, and said, 'I hope you liked your drive.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nA little dinner, not more than the Muses, with all the guests clever,\nand some pretty, offers human life and human nature under very\nfavourable circumstances. In the present instance, too, every one was\nanxious to please, for the host was entirely well-bred, never selfish in\nlittle things, and always contributed his quota to the general fund of\npolished sociability.\n\nAlthough there was really only one thought in every male mind present,\nstill, regard for the ladies, and some little apprehension of the\nservants, banished politics from discourse during the greater part\nof the dinner, with the occasional exception of some rapid and flying\nallusion which the initiated understood, but which remained a mystery\nto the rest. Nevertheless an old story now and then well told by Mr.\nOrmsby, a new joke now and then well introduced by Mr. Gay, some\ndashing assertion by Mr. Rigby, which, though wrong, was startling;\nthis agreeable blending of anecdote, jest, and paradox, kept everything\nfluent, and produced that degree of mild excitation which is desirable.\nLord Monmouth sometimes summed up with an epigrammatic sentence, and\nturned the conversation by a question, in case it dwelt too much on the\nsame topic. Lord Eskdale addressed himself principally to the ladies;\ninquired after their morning drive and doings, spoke of new fashions,\nand quoted a letter from Paris. Madame Colonna was not witty, but she\nhad that sweet Roman frankness which is so charming. The presence of\na beautiful woman, natural and good-tempered, even if she be not a\nL'Espinasse or a De Stael, is animating.\n\nNevertheless, owing probably to the absorbing powers of the forbidden\nsubject, there were moments when it seemed that a pause was impending,\nand Mr. Ormsby, an old hand, seized one of these critical instants to\naddress a good-natured question to Coningsby, whose acquaintance he had\nalready cultivated by taking wine with him.\n\n'And how do you like Eton?' asked Mr. Ormsby.\n\nIt was the identical question which had been presented to Coningsby in\nthe memorable interview of the morning, and which had received no reply;\nor rather had produced on his part a sentimental ebullition that had\nabsolutely destined or doomed him to the Church.\n\n'I should like to see the fellow who did not like Eton,' said Coningsby,\nbriskly, determined this time to be very brave.\n\n'Gad I must go down and see the old place,' said Mr. Ormsby, touched by\na pensive reminiscence. 'One can get a good bed and bottle of port at\nthe Christopher, still?'\n\n'You had better come and try, sir,' said Coningsby. 'If you will come\nsome day and dine with me at the Christopher, I will give you such a\nbottle of champagne as you never tasted yet.'\n\nThe Marquess looked at him, but said nothing.\n\n'Ah! I liked a dinner at the Christopher,' said Mr. Ormsby; 'after\nmutton, mutton, mutton, every day, it was not a bad thing.'\n\n'We had venison for dinner every week last season,' said Coningsby;\n'Buckhurst had it sent up from his park. But I don't care for dinner.\nBreakfast is my lounge.'\n\n'Ah! those little rolls and pats of butter!' said Mr. Ormsby. 'Short\ncommons, though. What do you think we did in my time? We used to send\nover the way to get a mutton-chop.'\n\n'I wish you could see Buckhurst and me at breakfast,' said Coningsby,\n'with a pound of Castle's sausages!'\n\n'What Buckhurst is that, Harry?' inquired Lord Monmouth, in a tone of\nsome interest, and for the first time calling him by his Christian name.\n\n'Sir Charles Buckhurst, sir, a Berkshire man: Shirley Park is his\nplace.'\n\n'Why, that must be Charley's son, Eskdale,' said Lord Monmouth; 'I had\nno idea he could be so young.'\n\n'He married late, you know, and had nothing but daughters for a long\ntime.'\n\n'Well, I hope there will be no Reform Bill for Eton,' said Lord\nMonmouth, musingly.\n\nThe servants had now retired.\n\n'I think, Lord Monmouth,' said Mr. Rigby, 'we must ask permission to\ndrink one toast to-day.'\n\n'Nay, I will myself give it,' he replied. 'Madame Colonna, you will, I\nam sure, join us when we drink, THE DUKE!'\n\n'Ah! what a man!' exclaimed the Princess. 'What a pity it is you have\na House of Commons here! England would be the greatest country in\nthe world if it were not for that House of Commons. It makes so much\nconfusion!'\n\n'Don't abuse our property,' said Lord Eskdale; 'Lord Monmouth and I have\nstill twenty votes of that same body between us.'\n\n'And there is a combination,' said Rigby, 'by which you may still keep\nthem.'\n\n'Ah! now for Rigby's combination,' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'The only thing that can save this country,' said Rigby, 'is a coalition\non a sliding scale.'\n\n'You had better buy up the Birmingham Union and the other bodies,' said\nLord Monmouth; 'I believe it might all be done for two or three hundred\nthousand pounds; and the newspapers too. Pitt would have settled this\nbusiness long ago.'\n\n'Well, at any rate, we are in,' said Rigby, 'and we must do something.'\n\n'I should like to see Grey's list of new peers,' said Lord Eskdale.\n'They say there are several members of our club in it.'\n\n'And the claims to the honour are so opposite,' said Lucian Gay; 'one,\non account of his large estate; another, because he has none; one,\nbecause he has a well-grown family to perpetuate the title; another,\nbecause he has no heir, and no power of ever obtaining one.'\n\n'I wonder how he will form his cabinet,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the old\nstory won't do.'\n\n'I hear that Baring is to be one of the new cards; they say it will\nplease the city,' said Lord Eskdale. 'I suppose they will pick out\nof hedge and ditch everything that has ever had the semblance of\nliberalism.'\n\n'Affairs in my time were never so complicated,' said Mr. Ormsby.\n\n'Nay, it appears to me to lie in a nutshell,' said Lucian Gay; 'one\nparty wishes to keep their old boroughs, and the other to get their new\npeers.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThe future historian of the country will be perplexed to ascertain what\nwas the distinct object which the Duke of Wellington proposed to himself\nin the political manoeuvres of May, 1832. It was known that the passing\nof the Reform Bill was a condition absolute with the King; it was\nunquestionable, that the first general election under the new law must\nignominiously expel the Anti-Reform Ministry from power; who would then\nresume their seats on the Opposition benches in both Houses with the\nloss not only of their boroughs, but of that reputation for political\nconsistency, which might have been some compensation for the\nparliamentary influence of which they had been deprived. It is difficult\nto recognise in this premature effort of the Anti-Reform leader to\nthrust himself again into the conduct of public affairs, any indications\nof the prescient judgment which might have been expected from such a\nquarter. It savoured rather of restlessness than of energy; and, while\nit proved in its progress not only an ignorance on his part of the\npublic mind, but of the feelings of his own party, it terminated\nunder circumstances which were humiliating to the Crown, and painfully\nsignificant of the future position of the House of Lords in the new\nconstitutional scheme.\n\nThe Duke of Wellington has ever been the votary of circumstances. He\ncares little for causes. He watches events rather than seeks to produce\nthem. It is a characteristic of the military mind. Rapid combinations,\nthe result of quick, vigilant, and comprehensive glance, are generally\ntriumphant in the field: but in civil affairs, where results are\nnot immediate; in diplomacy and in the management of deliberative\nassemblies, where there is much intervening time and many counteracting\ncauses, this velocity of decision, this fitful and precipitate action,\nare often productive of considerable embarrassment, and sometimes of\nterrible discomfiture. It is remarkable that men celebrated for military\nprudence are often found to be headstrong statesmen. In civil life\na great general is frequently and strangely the creature of impulse;\ninfluenced in his political movements by the last snatch of information;\nand often the creature of the last aide-de-camp who has his ear.\n\nWe shall endeavour to trace in another chapter the reasons which on\nthis as on previous and subsequent occasions, induced Sir Robert Peel to\nstand aloof, if possible, from official life, and made him reluctant\nto re-enter the service of his Sovereign. In the present instance, even\ntemporary success could only have been secured by the utmost decision,\npromptness, and energy. These were all wanting: some were afraid to\nfollow the bold example of their leader; many were disinclined. In\neight-and-forty hours it was known there was a 'hitch.'\n\nThe Reform party, who had been rather stupefied than appalled by the\naccepted mission of the Duke of Wellington, collected their scattered\nsenses, and rallied their forces. The agitators harangued, the mobs\nhooted. The City of London, as if the King had again tried to seize the\nfive members, appointed a permanent committee of the Common Council to\nwatch the fortunes of the 'great national measure,' and to report daily.\nBrookes', which was the only place that at first was really frightened\nand talked of compromise, grew valiant again; while young Whig heroes\njumped upon club-room tables, and delivered fiery invectives. Emboldened\nby these demonstrations, the House of Commons met in great force, and\npassed a vote which struck, without disguise, at all rival powers in the\nState; virtually announced its supremacy; revealed the forlorn position\nof the House of Lords under the new arrangement; and seemed to lay for\never the fluttering phantom of regal prerogative.\n\nIt was on the 9th of May that Lord Lyndhurst was with the King, and on\nthe 15th all was over. Nothing in parliamentary history so humiliating\nas the funeral oration delivered that day by the Duke of Wellington\nover the old constitution, that, modelled on the Venetian, had governed\nEngland since the accession of the House of Hanover. He described his\nSovereign, when his Grace first repaired to his Majesty, as in a\nstate of the greatest 'difficulty and distress,' appealing to his\nnever-failing loyalty to extricate him from his trouble and vexation.\nThe Duke of Wellington, representing the House of Lords, sympathises\nwith the King, and pledges his utmost efforts for his Majesty's\nrelief. But after five days' exertion, this man of indomitable will and\ninvincible fortunes, resigns the task in discomfiture and despair, and\nalleges as the only and sufficient reason for his utter and hopeless\ndefeat, that the House of Commons had come to a vote which ran counter\nto the contemplated exercise of the prerogative.\n\nFrom that moment power passed from the House of Lords to another\nassembly. But if the peers have ceased to be magnificoes, may it\nnot also happen that the Sovereign may cease to be a Doge? It is not\nimpossible that the political movements of our time, which seem on\nthe surface to have a tendency to democracy, may have in reality a\nmonarchical bias.\n\nIn less than a fortnight's time the House of Lords, like James II.,\nhaving abdicated their functions by absence, the Reform Bill passed; the\nardent monarch, who a few months before had expressed his readiness to\ngo down to Parliament, in a hackney coach if necessary, to assist its\nprogress, now declining personally to give his assent to its provisions.\n\nIn the protracted discussions to which this celebrated measure gave\nrise, nothing is more remarkable than the perplexities into which the\nspeakers of both sides are thrown, when they touch upon the nature of\nthe representative principle. On one hand it was maintained, that, under\nthe old system, the people were virtually represented; while on the\nother, it was triumphantly urged, that if the principle be conceded, the\npeople should not be virtually, but actually, represented. But who are\nthe people? And where are you to draw a line? And why should there\nbe any? It was urged that a contribution to the taxes was the\nconstitutional qualification for the suffrage. But we have established\na system of taxation in this country of so remarkable a nature, that the\nbeggar who chews his quid as he sweeps a crossing, is contributing\nto the imposts! Is he to have a vote? He is one of the people, and he\nyields his quota to the public burthens.\n\nAmid these conflicting statements, and these confounding conclusions, it\nis singular that no member of either House should have recurred to\nthe original character of these popular assemblies, which have always\nprevailed among the northern nations. We still retain in the antique\nphraseology of our statutes the term which might have beneficially\nguided a modern Reformer in his reconstructive labours.\n\nWhen the crowned Northman consulted on the welfare of his kingdom, he\nassembled the ESTATES of his realm. Now an estate is a class of the\nnation invested with political rights. There appeared the estate of the\nclergy, of the barons, of other classes. In the Scandinavian kingdoms\nto this day, the estate of the peasants sends its representatives to the\nDiet. In England, under the Normans, the Church and the Baronage were\nconvoked, together with the estate of the Community, a term which then\nprobably described the inferior holders of land, whose tenure was\nnot immediate of the Crown. This Third Estate was so numerous, that\nconvenience suggested its appearance by representation; while the\nothers, more limited, appeared, and still appear, personally. The Third\nEstate was reconstructed as circumstances developed themselves. It was a\nReform of Parliament when the towns were summoned.\n\nIn treating the House of the Third Estate as the House of the People,\nand not as the House of a privileged class, the Ministry and Parliament\nof 1831 virtually conceded the principle of Universal Suffrage. In this\npoint of view the ten-pound franchise was an arbitrary, irrational, and\nimpolitic qualification. It had, indeed, the merit of simplicity, and so\nhad the constitutions of Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Si\u00c3\u00a9y\u00c3\u00a8s. But its immediate and inevitable\nresult was Chartism.\n\nBut if the Ministry and Parliament of 1831 had announced that the time\nhad arrived when the Third Estate should be enlarged and reconstructed,\nthey would have occupied an intelligible position; and if, instead of\nsimplicity of elements in its reconstruction, they had sought, on the\ncontrary, various and varying materials which would have neutralised the\npainful predominance of any particular interest in the new scheme, and\nprevented those banded jealousies which have been its consequences, the\nnation would have found itself in a secure condition. Another class not\nless numerous than the existing one, and invested with privileges not\nless important, would have been added to the public estates of the\nrealm; and the bewildering phrase 'the People' would have remained,\nwhat it really is, a term of natural philosophy, and not of political\nscience.\n\nDuring this eventful week of May, 1832, when an important revolution\nwas effected in the most considerable of modern kingdoms, in a manner\nso tranquil, that the victims themselves were scarcely conscious at\nthe time of the catastrophe, Coningsby passed his hours in unaccustomed\npleasures, and in novel excitement. Although he heard daily from the\nlips of Mr. Rigby and his friends that England was for ever lost, the\nassembled guests still contrived to do justice to his grandfather's\nexcellent dinners; nor did the impending ruin that awaited them\nprevent the Princess Colonna from going to the Opera, whither she\nvery good-naturedly took Coningsby. Madame Colonna, indeed, gave such\ngratifying accounts of her dear young friend, that Coningsby became\ndaily a greater favourite with Lord Monmouth, who cherished the idea\nthat his grandson had inherited not merely the colour of his eyes, but\nsomething of his shrewd and fearless spirit.\n\nWith Lucretia, Coningsby did not much advance. She remained silent and\nsullen. She was not beautiful; pallid, with a lowering brow, and an eye\nthat avoided meeting another's. Madame Colonna, though good-natured,\nfelt for her something of the affection for which step-mothers are\ncelebrated. Lucretia, indeed, did not encourage her kindness, which\nirritated her step-mother, who seemed seldom to address her but to rate\nand chide; Lucretia never replied, but looked dogged. Her father, the\nPrince, did not compensate for this treatment. The memory of her mother,\nwhom he had greatly disliked, did not soften his heart. He was a man\nstill young; slender, not tall; very handsome, but worn; a haggard\nAntinous; his beautiful hair daily thinning; his dress rich and\neffeminate; many jewels, much lace. He seldom spoke, but was polished,\nthough moody.\n\nAt the end of the week, Coningsby returned to Eton. On the eve of\nhis departure, Lord Monmouth desired his grandson to meet him in his\napartments on the morrow, before quitting his roof. This farewell visit\nwas as kind and gracious as the first one had been repulsive. Lord\nMonmouth gave Coningsby his blessing and ten pounds; desired that he\nwould order a dress, anything he liked, for the approaching Montem,\nwhich Lord Monmouth meant to attend; and informed his grandson that he\nshould order that in future a proper supply of game and venison should\nbe forwarded to Eton for the use of himself and his friends.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nAfter eight o'clock school, the day following the return of Coningsby,\naccording to custom, he repaired to Buckhurst's room, where Henry\nSydney, Lord Vere, and our hero held with him their breakfast mess. They\nwere all in the fifth form, and habitual companions, on the river or on\nthe Fives' Wall, at cricket or at foot-ball. The return of Coningsby,\ntheir leader alike in sport and study, inspired them to-day with unusual\nspirits, which, to say the truth, were never particularly depressed.\nWhere he had been, what he had seen, what he had done, what sort of\nfellow his grandfather was, whether the visit had been a success; here\nwere materials for almost endless inquiry. And, indeed, to do them\njustice, the last question was not the least exciting to them; for the\ndeep and cordial interest which all felt in Coningsby's welfare far\noutweighed the curiosity which, under ordinary circumstances, they\nwould have experienced on the return of one of their companions from\nan unusual visit to London. The report of their friend imparted to\nthem unbounded satisfaction, when they learned that his relative was a\nsplendid fellow; that he had been loaded with kindness and favours; that\nMonmouth House, the wonders of which he rapidly sketched, was hereafter\nto be his home; that Lord Monmouth was coming down to Montem; that\nConingsby was to order any dress he liked, build a new boat if he chose;\nand, finally, had been pouched in a manner worthy of a Marquess and a\ngrandfather.\n\n'By the bye,' said Buckhurst, when the hubbub had a little subsided, 'I\nam afraid you will not half like it, Coningsby; but, old fellow, I\nhad no idea you would be back this morning; I have asked Millbank to\nbreakfast here.'\n\nA cloud stole over the clear brow of Coningsby.\n\n'It was my fault,' said the amiable Henry Sydney; 'but I really wanted\nto be civil to Millbank, and as you were not here, I put Buckhurst up to\nask him.'\n\n'Well,' said Coningsby, as if sullenly resigned, 'never mind; but why\nshould you ask an infernal manufacturer?'\n\n'Why, the Duke always wished me to pay him some attention,' said\nLord Henry, mildly. 'His family were so civil to us when we were at\nManchester.'\n\n'Manchester, indeed!' said Coningsby; 'if you knew what I do about\nManchester! A pretty state we have been in in London this week past with\nyour Manchesters and Birminghams!'\n\n'Come, come, Coningsby,' said Lord Vere, the son of a Whig minister; 'I\nam all for Manchester and Birmingham.'\n\n'It is all up with the country, I can tell you,' said Coningsby, with\nthe air of one who was in the secret.\n\n'My father says it will all go right now,' rejoined Lord Vere. 'I had a\nletter from my sister yesterday.'\n\n'They say we shall all lose our estates, though,' said Buckhurst; 'I\nknow I shall not give up mine without a fight. Shirley was besieged, you\nknow, in the civil wars; and the rebels got infernally licked.'\n\n'I think that all the people about Beaumanoir would stand by the Duke,'\nsaid Lord Henry, pensively.\n\n'Well, you may depend upon it you will have it very soon,' said\nConingsby. 'I know it from the best authority.'\n\n'It depends on whether my father remains in,' said Lord Vere. 'He is the\nonly man who can govern the country now. All say that.'\n\nAt this moment Millbank entered. He was a good looking boy, somewhat\nshy, and yet with a sincere expression in his countenance. He was\nevidently not extremely intimate with those who were now his companions.\nBuckhurst, and Henry Sydney, and Vere, welcomed him cordially. He looked\nat Coningsby with some constraint, and then said:\n\n'You have been in London, Coningsby?'\n\n'Yes, I have been there during all the row.'\n\n'You must have had a rare lark.'\n\n'Yes, if having your windows broken by a mob be a rare lark. They could\nnot break my grandfather's, though. Monmouth House is in a court-yard.\nAll noblemen's houses should be in court-yards.'\n\n'I was glad to see it all ended very well,' said Millbank.\n\n'It has not begun yet,' said Coningsby.\n\n'What?' said Millbank.\n\n'Why, the revolution.'\n\n'The Reform Bill will prevent a revolution, my father says,' said\nMillbank.\n\n'By Jove! here's the goose,' said Buckhurst.\n\nAt this moment there entered the room a little boy, the scion of a noble\nhouse, bearing a roasted goose, which he had carried from the kitchen of\nthe opposite inn, the Christopher. The lower boy or fag, depositing\nhis burthen, asked his master whether he had further need of him; and\nBuckhurst, after looking round the table, and ascertaining that he had\nnot, gave him permission to retire; but he had scarcely disappeared,\nwhen his master singing out, 'Lower boy, St. John!' he immediately\nre-entered, and demanded his master's pleasure, which was, that he\nshould pour some water in the teapot. This being accomplished, St. John\nreally made his escape, and retired to a pupil-room, where the bullying\nof a tutor, because he had no derivations, exceeded in all probability\nthe bullying of his master, had he contrived in his passage from the\nChristopher to have upset the goose or dropped the sausages.\n\nIn their merry meal, the Reform Bill was forgotten. Their thoughts were\nsoon concentrated in their little world, though it must be owned that\nvisions of palaces and beautiful ladies did occasionally flit over the\nbrain of one of the company. But for him especially there was much of\ninterest and novelty. So much had happened in his absence! There was a\nweek's arrears for him of Eton annals. They were recounted in so fresh\na spirit, and in such vivid colours, that Coningsby lost nothing by his\nLondon visit. All the bold feats that had been done, and all the bright\nthings that had been said; all the triumphs, and all the failures,\nand all the scrapes; how popular one master had made himself, and how\nridiculous another; all was detailed with a liveliness, a candour, and\na picturesque ingenuousness, which would have made the fortune of a\nHerodotus or a Froissart.\n\n'I'll tell you what,' said Buckhurst, 'I move that after twelve we five\ngo up to Maidenhead.'\n\n'Agreed; agreed!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nMillbank was the son of one of the wealthiest manufacturers in\nLancashire. His father, whose opinions were of a very democratic bent,\nsent his son to Eton, though he disapproved of the system of education\npursued there, to show that he had as much right to do so as any duke in\nthe land. He had, however, brought up his only boy with a due prejudice\nagainst every sentiment or institution of an aristocratic character,\nand had especially impressed upon him in his school career, to avoid the\nslightest semblance of courting the affections or society of any member\nof the falsely-held superior class.\n\nThe character of the son as much as the influence of the father, tended\nto the fulfilment of these injunctions. Oswald Millbank was of a\nproud and independent nature; reserved, a little stern. The early and\nconstantly-reiterated dogma of his father, that he belonged to a class\ndebarred from its just position in the social system, had aggravated the\ngrave and somewhat discontented humour of his blood. His talents were\nconsiderable, though invested with no dazzling quality. He had not that\nquick and brilliant apprehension, which, combined with a memory of rare\nretentiveness, had already advanced Coningsby far beyond his age,\nand made him already looked to as the future hero of the school. But\nMillbank possessed one of those strong, industrious volitions whose\nperseverance amounts almost to genius, and nearly attains its results.\nThough Coningsby was by a year his junior, they were rivals. This\ncircumstance had no tendency to remove the prejudice which Coningsby\nentertained against him, but its bias on the part of Millbank had a\ncontrary effect.\n\nThe influence of the individual is nowhere so sensible as at school.\nThere the personal qualities strike without any intervening and\ncounteracting causes. A gracious presence, noble sentiments, or a happy\ntalent, make their way there at once, without preliminary inquiries as\nto what set they are in, or what family they are of, how much they\nhave a-year, or where they live. Now, on no spirit had the influence of\nConingsby, already the favourite, and soon probably to become the idol,\nof the school, fallen more effectually than on that of Millbank, though\nit was an influence that no one could suspect except its votary or its\nvictim.\n\nAt school, friendship is a passion. It entrances the being; it tears\nthe soul. All loves of after-life can never bring its rapture, or its\nwretchedness; no bliss so absorbing, no pangs of jealousy or despair\nso crushing and so keen! What tenderness and what devotion; what\nillimitable confidence; infinite revelations of inmost thoughts; what\necstatic present and romantic future; what bitter estrangements and what\nmelting reconciliations; what scenes of wild recrimination, agitating\nexplanations, passionate correspondence; what insane sensitiveness, and\nwhat frantic sensibility; what earthquakes of the heart and whirlwinds\nof the soul are confined in that simple phrase, a schoolboy's\nfriendship! Tis some indefinite recollection of these mystic passages of\ntheir young emotion that makes grey-haired men mourn over the memory\nof their schoolboy days. It is a spell that can soften the acerbity of\npolitical warfare, and with its witchery can call forth a sigh even amid\nthe callous bustle of fashionable saloons.\n\nThe secret of Millbank's life was a passionate admiration and affection\nfor Coningsby. Pride, his natural reserve, and his father's injunctions,\nhad, however, hitherto successfully combined to restrain the slightest\ndemonstration of these sentiments. Indeed, Coningsby and himself\nwere never companions, except in school, or in some public game. The\ndemeanour of Coningsby gave no encouragement to intimacy to one, who,\nunder any circumstances, would have required considerable invitation to\nopen himself. So Millbank fed in silence on a cherished idea. It was\nhis happiness to be in the same form, to join in the same sport, with\nConingsby; occasionally to be thrown in unusual contact with him,\nto exchange slight and not unkind words. In their division they were\nrivals; Millbank sometimes triumphed, but to be vanquished by Coningsby\nwas for him not without a degree of mild satisfaction. Not a gesture,\nnot a phrase from Coningsby, that he did not watch and ponder over and\ntreasure up. Coningsby was his model, alike in studies, in manners,\nor in pastimes; the aptest scholar, the gayest wit, the most graceful\nassociate, the most accomplished playmate: his standard of excellent.\nYet Millbank was the very last boy in the school who would have had\ncredit given him by his companions for profound and ardent feeling. He\nwas not indeed unpopular. The favourite of the school like Coningsby, he\ncould, under no circumstances, ever have become; nor was he qualified\nto obtain that general graciousness among the multitude, which the sweet\ndisposition of Henry Sydney, or the gay profusion of Buckhurst, acquired\nwithout any effort. Millbank was not blessed with the charm of manner.\nHe seemed close and cold; but he was courageous, just, and inflexible;\nnever bullied, and to his utmost would prevent tyranny. The little boys\nlooked up to him as a stern protector; and his word, too, throughout the\nschool was a proverb: and truth ranks a great quality among boys. In\na word, Millbank was respected by those among whom he lived; and\nschool-boys scan character more nicely than men suppose.\n\nA brother of Henry Sydney, quartered in Lancashire, had been wounded\nrecently in a riot, and had received great kindness from the Millbank\nfamily, in whose immediate neighbourhood the disturbance had occurred.\nThe kind Duke had impressed on Henry Sydney to acknowledge with\ncordiality to the younger Millbank at Eton, the sense which his family\nentertained of these benefits; but though Henry lost neither time nor\nopportunity in obeying an injunction, which was grateful to his own\nheart, he failed in cherishing, or indeed creating, any intimacy\nwith the object of his solicitude. A companionship with one who was\nConingsby's relative and most familiar friend, would at the first\nglance have appeared, independently of all other considerations, a most\ndesirable result for Millbank to accomplish. But, perhaps, this\nvery circumstance afforded additional reasons for the absence of all\nencouragement with which he received the overtures of Lord Henry.\nMillbank suspected that Coningsby was not affected in his favour, and\nhis pride recoiled from gaining, by any indirect means, an intimacy\nwhich to have obtained in a plain and express manner would have deeply\ngratified him. However, the urgent invitation of Buckhurst and\nHenry Sydney, and the fear that a persistence in refusal might be\nmisinterpreted into churlishness, had at length brought Millbank to\ntheir breakfast-mess, though, when he accepted their invitation, he did\nnot apprehend that Coningsby would have been present.\n\nIt was about an hour before sunset, the day of this very breakfast, and\na good number of boys, in lounging groups, were collected in the\nLong Walk. The sports and matches of the day were over. Criticism had\nsucceeded to action in sculling and in cricket. They talked over the\nexploits of the morning; canvassed the merits of the competitors, marked\nthe fellow whose play or whose stroke was improving; glanced at another,\nwhose promise had not been fulfilled; discussed the pretensions, and\nadjudged the palm. Thus public opinion is formed. Some, too, might\nbe seen with their books and exercises, intent on the inevitable\nand impending tasks. Among these, some unhappy wight in the remove,\nwandering about with his hat, after parochial fashion, seeking relief\nin the shape of a verse. A hard lot this, to know that you must be\ndelivered of fourteen verses at least in the twenty-four hours, and to\nbe conscious that you are pregnant of none. The lesser boys, urchins of\ntender years, clustered like flies round the baskets of certain vendors\nof sugary delicacies that rested on the Long Walk wall. The pallid\ncountenance, the lacklustre eye, the hoarse voice clogged with\naccumulated phlegm, indicated too surely the irreclaimable and hopeless\nvotary of lollypop, the opium-eater of schoolboys.\n\n'It is settled, the match to-morrow shall be between Aquatics and\nDrybobs,' said a senior boy; who was arranging a future match at\ncricket.\n\n'But what is to be done about Fielding major?' inquired another. 'He has\nnot paid his boating money, and I say he has no right to play among the\nAquatics before he has paid his money.'\n\n'Oh! but we must have Fielding major, he is such a devil of a swipe.'\n\n'I declare he shall not play among the Aquatics if he does not pay his\nboating money. It is an infernal shame.'\n\n'Let us ask Buckhurst. Where is Buckhurst?'\n\n'Have you got any toffy?' inquired a dull looking little boy, in a\nhoarse voice, of one of the vendors of scholastic confectionery.\n\n'Tom Trot, sir.'\n\n'No; I want toffy.'\n\n'Very nice Tom Trot, sir.'\n\n'No, I want toffy; I have been eating Tom Trot all day.'\n\n'Where is Buckhurst? We must settle about the Aquatics.'\n\n'Well, I for one will not play if Fielding major plays amongst the\nAquatics. That is settled.'\n\n'Oh! nonsense; he will pay his money if you ask him.'\n\n'I shall not ask him again. The captain duns us every day. It is an\ninfernal shame.'\n\n'I say, Burnham, where can one get some toffy? This fellow never has\nany.'\n\n'I will tell you; at Barnes' on the bridge. The best toffy in the\nworld.'\n\n'I will go at once. I must have some toffy.'\n\n'Just help me with this verse, Collins,' said one boy to another, in an\nimploring tone, 'that's a good fellow.'\n\n'Well, give it us: first syllable in _fabri_ is short; three false\nquantities in the two first lines! You're a pretty one. There, I have\ndone it for you.'\n\n'That's a good fellow.'\n\n'Any fellow seen Buckhurst?'\n\n'Gone up the river with Coningsby and Henry Sydney.'\n\n'But he must be back by this time. I want him to make the list for the\nmatch to-morrow. Where the deuce can Buckhurst be?'\n\nAnd now, as rumours rise in society we know not how, so there was\nsuddenly a flying report in this multitude, the origin of which no one\nin his alarm stopped to ascertain, that a boy was drowned.\n\nEvery heart was agitated.\n\nWhat boy? When, where, how? Who was absent? Who had been on the river\nto-day? Buckhurst. The report ran that Buckhurst was drowned. Great were\nthe trouble and consternation. Buckhurst was ever much liked; and now no\none remembered anything but his good qualities.\n\n'Who heard it was Buckhurst?' said Sedgwick, captain of the school,\ncoming forward.\n\n'I heard Bradford tell Palmer it was Buckhurst,' said a little boy.\n\n'Where is Bradford?'\n\n'Here.'\n\n'What do you know about Buckhurst?'\n\n'Wentworth told me that he was afraid Buckhurst was drowned. He heard it\nat the Brocas; a bargeman told him about a quarter of an hour ago.'\n\n'Here is Wentworth! Here is Wentworth!' a hundred voices exclaimed, and\nthey formed a circle round him.\n\n'Well, what did you hear, Wentworth?' asked Sedgwick.\n\n'I was at the Brocas, and a bargee told me that an Eton fellow had been\ndrowned above Surley, and the only Eton boat above Surley to-day, as I\ncan learn, is Buckhurst's four-oar. That is all.'\n\nThere was a murmur of hope.\n\n'Oh! come, come,' said Sedgwick, 'there is come chance. Who is with\nBuckhurst; who knows?'\n\n'I saw him walk down to the Brocas with Vere,' said a boy.\n\n'I hope it is not Vere,' said a little boy, with a tearful eye; 'he\nnever lets any fellow bully me.'\n\n'Here is Maltravers,' halloed out a boy; 'he knows something.'\n\n'Well, what do you know, Maltravers?'\n\n'I heard Boots at the Christopher say that an Eton fellow was drowned,\nand that he had seen a person who was there.'\n\n'Bring Boots here,' said Sedgwick.\n\nInstantly a band of boys rushed over the way, and in a moment the\nwitness was produced.\n\n'What have you heard, Sam, about this accident?' said Sedgwick.\n\n'Well, sir, I heard a young gentleman was drowned above Monkey Island,'\nsaid Boots.\n\n'And no name mentioned?'\n\n'Well, sir, I believe it was Mr. Coningsby.'\n\nA general groan of horror.\n\n'Coningsby, Coningsby! By Heavens I hope not,' said Sedgwick.\n\n'I very much fear so,' said Boots; 'as how the bargeman who told me saw\nMr. Coningsby in the Lock House laid out in flannels.'\n\n'I had sooner any fellow had been drowned than Coningsby,' whispered one\nboy to another.\n\n'I liked him, the best fellow at Eton,' responded his companion, in a\nsmothered tone.\n\n'What a clever fellow he was!'\n\n'And so deuced generous!'\n\n'He would have got the medal if he had lived.'\n\n'And how came he to be drowned? for he was such a fine swimmer!'\n\n'I heerd Mr. Coningsby was saving another's life,' continued Boots in\nhis evidence, 'which makes it in a manner more sorrowful.'\n\n'Poor Coningsby!' exclaimed a boy, bursting into tears: 'I move the\nwhole school goes into mourning.'\n\n'I wish we could get hold of this bargeman,' said Sedgwick. 'Now stop,\nstop, don't all run away in that mad manner; you frighten the people.\nCharles Herbert and Palmer, you two go down to the Brocas and inquire.'\n\nBut just at this moment, an increased stir and excitement were evident\nin the Long Walk; the circle round Sedgwick opened, and there appeared\nHenry Sydney and Buckhurst.\n\nThere was a dead silence. It was impossible that suspense could be\nstrained to a higher pitch. The air and countenance of Sydney and\nBuckhurst were rather excited than mournful or alarmed. They needed no\ninquiries, for before they had penetrated the circle they had become\naware of its cause.\n\nBuckhurst, the most energetic of beings, was of course the first to\nspeak. Henry Sydney indeed looked pale and nervous; but his companion,\nflushed and resolute, knew exactly how to hit a popular assembly, and at\nonce came to the point.\n\n'It is all a false report, an infernal lie; Coningsby is quite safe, and\nnobody is drowned.'\n\nThere was a cheer that might have been heard at Windsor Castle. Then,\nturning to Sedgwick, in an undertone Buckhurst added,\n\n'It _is_ all right, but, by Jove! we have had a shaver. I will tell you\nall in a moment, but we want to keep the thing quiet, and so let the\nfellows disperse, and we will talk afterwards.'\n\nIn a few moments the Long Walk had resumed its usual character; but\nSedgwick, Herbert, and one or two others turned into the playing fields,\nwhere, undisturbed and unnoticed by the multitude, they listened to the\npromised communication of Buckhurst and Henry Sydney.\n\n'You know we went up the river together,' said Buckhurst. 'Myself, Henry\nSydney, Coningsby, Vere, and Millbank. We had breakfasted together, and\nafter twelve agreed to go up to Maidenhead. Well, we went up much higher\nthan we had intended. About a quarter of a mile before we had got to the\nLock we pulled up; Coningsby was then steering. Well, we fastened the\nboat to, and were all of us stretched out on the meadow, when Millbank\nand Vere said they should go and bathe in the Lock Pool. The rest of us\nwere opposed; but after Millbank and Vere had gone about ten minutes,\nConingsby, who was very fresh, said he had changed his mind and should\ngo and bathe too. So he left us. He had scarcely got to the pool when he\nheard a cry. There was a fellow drowning. He threw off his clothes and\nwas in in a moment. The fact is this, Millbank had plunged in the pool\nand found himself in some eddies, caused by the meeting of two currents.\nHe called out to Vere not to come, and tried to swim off. But he was\nbeat, and seeing he was in danger, Vere jumped in. But the stream was\nso strong, from the great fall of water from the lasher above, that Vere\nwas exhausted before he could reach Millbank, and nearly sank himself.\nWell, he just saved himself; but Millbank sank as Coningsby jumped in.\nWhat do you think of that?'\n\n'By Jove!' exclaimed Sedgwick, Herbert, and all. The favourite oath of\nschoolboys perpetuates the divinity of Olympus.\n\n'And now comes the worst. Coningsby caught Millbank when he rose, but\nhe found himself in the midst of the same strong current that had before\nnearly swamped Vere. What a lucky thing that he had taken into his head\nnot to pull to-day! Fresher than Vere, he just managed to land Millbank\nand himself. The shouts of Vere called us, and we arrived to find the\nbodies of Millbank and Coningsby apparently lifeless, for Millbank was\nquite gone, and Coningsby had swooned on landing.'\n\n'If Coningsby had been lost,' said Henry Sydney, 'I never would have\nshown my face at Eton again.'\n\n'Can you conceive a position more terrible?' said Buckhurst. 'I declare\nI shall never forget it as long as I live. However, there was the Lock\nHouse at hand; and we got blankets and brandy. Coningsby was soon all\nright; but Millbank, I can tell you, gave us some trouble. I thought it\nwas all up. Didn't you, Henry Sydney?'\n\n'The most fishy thing I ever saw,' said Henry Sydney.\n\n'Well, we were fairly frightened here,' said Sedgwick. 'The first\nreport was, that you had gone, but that seemed without foundation; but\nConingsby was quite given up. Where are they now?'\n\n'They are both at their tutors'. I thought they had better keep quiet.\nVere is with Millbank, and we are going back to Coningsby directly; but\nwe thought it best to show, finding on our arrival that there were all\nsorts of rumours about. I think it will be best to report at once to my\ntutor, for he will be sure to hear something.'\n\n'I would if I were you.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nWhat wonderful things are events! The least are of greater importance\nthan the most sublime and comprehensive speculations! In what fanciful\nschemes to obtain the friendship of Coningsby had Millbank in his\nreveries often indulged! What combinations that were to extend over\nyears and influence their lives! But the moment that he entered the\nworld of action, his pride recoiled from the plans and hopes which his\nsympathy had inspired. His sensibility and his inordinate self-respect\nwere always at variance. And he seldom exchanged a word with the being\nwhose idea engrossed his affection.\n\nAnd now, suddenly, an event had occurred, like all events, unforeseen,\nwhich in a few, brief, agitating, tumultuous moments had singularly and\nutterly changed the relations that previously subsisted between him and\nthe former object of his concealed tenderness. Millbank now stood with\nrespect to Coningsby in the position of one who owes to another the\ngreatest conceivable obligation; a favour which time could permit him\nneither to forget nor to repay. Pride was a sentiment that could no\nlonger subsist before the preserver of his life. Devotion to that being,\nopen, almost ostentatious, was now a duty, a paramount and absorbing\ntie. The sense of past peril, the rapture of escape, a renewed relish\nfor the life so nearly forfeited, a deep sentiment of devout gratitude\nto the providence that had guarded over him, for Millbank was an\neminently religious boy, a thought of home, and the anguish that might\nhave overwhelmed his hearth; all these were powerful and exciting\nemotions for a young and fervent mind, in addition to the peculiar\nsource of sensibility on which we have already touched. Lord Vere, who\nlodged in the same house as Millbank, and was sitting by his bedside,\nobserved, as night fell, that his mind wandered.\n\nThe illness of Millbank, the character of which soon transpired, and was\nsoon exaggerated, attracted the public attention with increased interest\nto the circumstances out of which it had arisen, and from which the\nparties principally concerned had wished to have diverted notice. The\nsufferer, indeed, had transgressed the rules of the school by bathing at\nan unlicensed spot, where there were no expert swimmers in attendance,\nas is customary, to instruct the practice and to guard over the lives of\nthe young adventurers. But the circumstances with which this violation\nof rules had been accompanied, and the assurance of several of the party\nthat they had not themselves infringed the regulations, combined with\nthe high character of Millbank, made the authorities not over anxious\nto visit with penalties a breach of observance which, in the case of\nthe only proved offender, had been attended with such impressive\nconsequences. The feat of Coningsby was extolled by all as an act\nof high gallantry and skill. It confirmed and increased the great\nreputation which he already enjoyed.\n\n'Millbank is getting quite well,' said Buckhurst to Coningsby a few days\nafter the accident. 'Henry Sydney and I are going to see him. Will you\ncome?'\n\n'I think we shall be too many. I will go another day,' replied\nConingsby.\n\nSo they went without him. They found Millbank up and reading.\n\n'Well, old fellow,' said Buckhurst, 'how are you? We should have come up\nbefore, but they would not let us. And you are quite right now, eh?'\n\n'Quite. Has there been any row about it?'\n\n'All blown over,' said Henry Sydney; 'C*******y behaved like a trump.'\n\n'I have seen nobody yet,' said Millbank; 'they would not let me till\nto-day. Vere looked in this morning and left me this book, but I was\nasleep. I hope they will let me out in a day or two. I want to thank\nConingsby; I never shall rest till I have thanked Coningsby.'\n\n'Oh, he will come to see you,' said Henry Sydney; 'I asked him just now\nto come with us.'\n\n'Yes!' said Millbank, eagerly; 'and what did he say?'\n\n'He thought we should be too many.'\n\n'I hope I shall see him soon,' said Millbank, 'somehow or other.'\n\n'I will tell him to come,' said Buckhurst.\n\n'Oh! no, no, don't tell him to come,' said Millbank. 'Don't bore him.'\n\n'I know he is going to play a match at fives this afternoon,' said\nBuckhurst, 'for I am one.'\n\n'And who are the others?' inquired Millbank.\n\n'Herbert and Campbell.'\n\n'Herbert is no match for Coningsby,' said Millbank.\n\nAnd then they talked over all that had happened since his absence; and\nBuckhurst gave him a graphic report of the excitement on the afternoon\nof the accident; at last they were obliged to leave him.\n\n'Well, good-bye, old fellow; we will come and see you every day. What\ncan we do for you? Any books, or anything?'\n\n'If any fellow asks after me,' said Millbank, 'tell him I shall be glad\nto see him. It is very dull being alone. But do not tell any fellow to\ncome if he does not ask after me.'\n\nNotwithstanding the kind suggestions of Buckhurst and Henry Sydney,\nConingsby could not easily bring himself to call on Millbank. He felt a\nconstraint. It seemed as if he went to receive thanks. He would rather\nhave met Millbank again in school, or in the playing fields. Without\nbeing able then to analyse his feelings, he shrank unconsciously from\nthat ebullition of sentiment, which in more artificial circles is\ndescribed as a scene. Not that any dislike of Millbank prompted him to\nthis reserve. On the contrary, since he had conferred a great obligation\non Millbank, his prejudice against him had sensibly decreased. How it\nwould have been had Millbank saved Coningsby's life, is quite another\naffair. Probably, as Coningsby was by nature generous, his sense of\njustice might have struggled successfully with his painful sense of the\noverwhelming obligation. But in the present case there was no element\nto disturb his fair self-satisfaction. He had greatly distinguished\nhimself; he had conferred on his rival an essential service; and the\nwhole world rang with his applause. He began rather to like Millbank;\nwe will not say because Millbank was the unintentional cause of his\npleasurable sensations. Really it was that the unusual circumstances had\nprompted him to a more impartial judgment of his rival's character.\nIn this mood, the day after the visit of Buckhurst and Henry Sydney,\nConingsby called on Millbank, but finding his medical attendant with\nhim, Coningsby availed himself of that excuse for going away without\nseeing him.\n\nThe next day he left Millbank a newspaper on his way to school, time not\npermitting a visit. Two days after, going into his room, he found on his\ntable a letter addressed to 'Harry Coningsby, Esq.'\n\nETON, May--, 1832.\n\n'DEAR CONINGSBY, I very much fear that you must think me a very\nungrateful fellow, because you have not heard from me before; but I was\nin hopes that I might get out and say to you what I feel; but whether I\nspeak or write, it is quite impossible for me to make you understand the\nfeelings of my heart to you. Now, I will say at once, that I have always\nliked you better than any fellow in the school, and always thought you\nthe cleverest; indeed, I always thought that there was no one like you;\nbut I never would say this or show this, because you never seemed to\ncare for me, and because I was afraid you would think I merely wanted to\ncon with you, as they used to say of some other fellows, whose names I\nwill not mention, because they always tried to do so with Henry Sydney\nand you. I do not want this at all; but I want, though we may not speak\nto each other more than before, that we may be friends; and that you\nwill always know that there is nothing I will not do for you, and that\nI like you better than any fellow at Eton. And I do not mean that this\nshall be only at Eton, but afterwards, wherever we may be, that you will\nalways remember that there is nothing I will not do for you. Not because\nyou saved my life, though that is a great thing, but because before that\nI would have done anything for you; only, for the cause above mentioned,\nI would not show it. I do not expect that we shall be more together than\nbefore; nor can I ever suppose that you could like me as you like Henry\nSydney and Buckhurst, or even as you like Vere; but still I hope you\nwill always think of me with kindness now, and let me sign myself, if\never I do write to you, 'Your most attached, affectionate, and devoted\nfriend,\n\n'OSWALD MILLBANK.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nAbout a fortnight after this nearly fatal adventure on the river, it was\nMontem. One need hardly remind the reader that this celebrated\nceremony, of which the origin is lost in obscurity, and which now occurs\ntriennially, is the tenure by which Eton College holds some of its\ndomains. It consists in the waving of a flag by one of the scholars, on\na mount near the village of Salt Hill, which, without doubt, derives its\nname from the circumstance that on this day every visitor to Eton, and\nevery traveller in its vicinity, from the monarch to the peasant, are\nstopped on the road by youthful brigands in picturesque costume, and\nsummoned to contribute 'salt,' in the shape of coin of the realm, to\nthe purse collecting for the Captain of Eton, the senior scholar on the\nFoundation, who is about to repair to King's College, Cambridge.\n\nOn this day the Captain of Eton appears in a dress as martial as his\ntitle: indeed, each sixth-form boy represents in his uniform, though not\nperhaps according to the exact rules of the Horse Guards, an officer of\nthe army. One is a marshal, another an ensign. There is a lieutenant,\ntoo; and the remainder are sergeants. Each of those who are intrusted\nwith these ephemeral commissions has one or more attendants, the number\nof these varying according to his rank. These servitors are selected\naccording to the wishes of the several members of the sixth form, out of\nthe ranks of the lower boys, that is, those boys who are below the\nfifth form; and all these attendants are arrayed in a variety of fancy\ndresses. The Captain of the Oppidans and the senior Colleger next to\nthe Captain of the school, figure also in fancy costume, and are called\n'Saltbearers.' It is their business, together with the twelve senior\nCollegers of the fifth form, who are called 'Runners,' and whose\ncostume is also determined by the taste of the wearers, to levy the\ncontributions. And all the Oppidans of the fifth form, among whom ranked\nConingsby, class as 'Corporals;' and are severally followed by one or\nmore lower boys, who are denominated 'Polemen,' but who appear in their\nordinary dress.\n\nIt was a fine, bright morning; the bells of Eton and Windsor rang\nmerrily; everybody was astir, and every moment some gay equipage\ndrove into the town. Gaily clustering in the thronged precincts of\nthe College, might be observed many a glistening form: airy Greek or\nsumptuous Ottoman, heroes of the Holy Sepulchre, Spanish Hidalgos who\nhad fought at Pavia, Highland Chiefs who had charged at Culloden, gay in\nthe tartan of Prince Charlie. The Long Walk was full of busy groups in\nscarlet coats or fanciful uniforms; some in earnest conversation, some\ncriticising the arriving guests; others encircling some magnificent\nhero, who astounded them with his slashed doublet or flowing plume.\n\nA knot of boys, sitting on the Long Walk wall, with their feet swinging\nin the air, watched the arriving guests of the Provost.\n\n'I say, Townshend,' said one, 'there's Grobbleton; he _was_ a bully. I\nwonder if that's his wife? Who's this? The Duke of Agincourt. He wasn't\nan Eton fellow? Yes, he was. He was called Poictiers then. Oh! ah!\nhis name is in the upper school, very large, under Charles Fox. I say,\nTownshend, did you see Saville's turban? What was it made of? He says\nhis mother brought it from Grand Cairo. Didn't he just look like the\nSaracen's Head? Here are some Dons. That's Hallam! We'll give him a\ncheer. I say, Townshend, look at this fellow. He doesn't think small\nbeer of himself. I wonder who he is? The Duke of Wellington's valet come\nto say his master is engaged. Oh! by Jove, he heard you! I wonder if the\nDuke will come? Won't we give him a cheer!'\n\n'By Jove! who is this?' exclaimed Townshend, and he jumped from the\nwall, and, followed by his companions, rushed towards the road.\n\nTwo britskas, each drawn by four grey horses of mettle, and each\naccompanied by outriders as well mounted, were advancing at a rapid\npace along the road that leads from Slough to the College. But they were\ndestined to an irresistible check. About fifty yards before they had\nreached the gate that leads into Weston's Yard, a ruthless but splendid\nAlbanian, in crimson and gold embroidered jacket, and snowy camise,\nstarted forward, and holding out his silver-sheathed yataghan commanded\nthe postilions to stop. A Peruvian Inca on the other side of the road\ngave a simultaneous command, and would infallibly have transfixed the\noutriders with an arrow from his unerring bow, had they for an instant\nhesitated. The Albanian Chief then advanced to the door of the carriage,\nwhich he opened, and in a tone of great courtesy, announced that he was\nunder the necessity of troubling its inmates for 'salt.' There was no\ndelay. The Lord of the equipage, with the amiable condescension of a\n'grand monarque,' expressed his hope that the collection would be an\nample one, and as an old Etonian, placed in the hands of the Albanian\nhis contribution, a magnificent purse, furnished for the occasion, and\nheavy with gold.\n\n'Don't be alarmed, ladies,' said a very handsome young officer,\nlaughing, and taking off his cocked hat.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed one of the ladies, turning at the voice, and starting a\nlittle. 'Ah! it is Mr. Coningsby.'\n\nLord Eskdale paid the salt for the next carriage. 'Do they come down\npretty stiff?' he inquired, and then, pulling forth a roll of bank-notes\nfrom the pocket of his pea-jacket, he wished them good morning.\n\nThe courtly Provost, then the benignant Goodall, a man who, though his\nexperience of life was confined to the colleges in which he had passed\nhis days, was naturally gifted with the rarest of all endowments, the\ntalent of reception; and whose happy bearing and gracious manner,\na smile ever in his eye and a lively word ever on his lip, must be\nrecalled by all with pleasant recollections, welcomed Lord Monmouth\nand his friends to an assemblage of the noble, the beautiful, and the\ncelebrated gathered together in rooms not unworthy of them, as you\nlooked upon their interesting walls, breathing with the portraits of the\nheroes whom Eton boasts, from Wotton to Wellesley. Music sounded in\nthe quadrangle of the College, in which the boys were already quickly\nassembling. The Duke of Wellington had arrived, and the boys were\ncheering a hero, who was an Eton field-marshal. From an oriel window\nin one of the Provost's rooms, Lord Monmouth, surrounded by every\ncircumstance that could make life delightful, watched with some\nintentness the scene in the quadrangle beneath.\n\n'I would give his fame,' said Lord Monmouth, 'if I had it, and my\nwealth, to be sixteen.'\n\nFive hundred of the youth of England, sparkling with health, high\nspirits, and fancy dresses, were now assembled in the quadrangle.\nThey formed into rank, and headed by a band of the Guards, thrice they\nmarched round the court. Then quitting the College, they commenced their\nprogress 'ad Montem.' It was a brilliant spectacle to see them defiling\nthrough the playing fields, those bowery meads; the river sparkling\nin the sun, the castled heights of Windsor, their glorious landscape;\nbehind them, the pinnacles of their College.\n\nThe road from Eton to Salt Hill was clogged with carriages; the broad\nfields as far as eye could range were covered with human beings. Amid\nthe burst of martial music and the shouts of the multitude, the band of\nheroes, as if they were marching from Athens, or Thebes, or Sparta, to\nsome heroic deed, encircled the mount; the ensign reaches its summit,\nand then, amid a deafening cry of 'Floreat Etona!' he unfurls, and\nthrice waves the consecrated standard.\n\n'Lord Monmouth,' said Mr. Rigby to Coningsby, 'wishes that you should\nbeg your friends to dine with him. Of course you will ask Lord Henry and\nyour friend Sir Charles Buckhurst; and is there any one else that you\nwould like to invite?'\n\n'Why, there is Vere,' said Coningsby, hesitating, 'and--'\n\n'Vere! What Lord Vere?' said Rigby. 'Hum! He is one of your friends, is\nhe? His father has done a great deal of mischief, but still he is Lord\nVere. Well, of course, you can invite Vere.'\n\n'There is another fellow I should like to ask very much,' said\nConingsby, 'if Lord Monmouth would not think I was asking too many.'\n\n'Never fear that; he sent me particularly to tell you to invite as many\nas you liked.'\n\n'Well, then, I should like to ask Millbank.'\n\n'Millbank!' said Mr. Rigby, a little excited, and then he added, 'Is\nthat a son of Lady Albinia Millbank?'\n\n'No; his mother is not a Lady Albinia, but he is a great friend of mine.\nHis father is a Lancashire manufacturer.'\n\n'By no means,' exclaimed Mr. Rigby, quite agitated. 'There is nothing\nin the world that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as Manchester\nmanufacturers, and particularly if they bear the name of Millbank. It\nmust not be thought of, my dear Harry. I hope you have not spoken to\nthe young man on the subject. I assure you it is out of the question.\nIt would make Lord Monmouth quite ill. It would spoil everything, quite\nupset him.'\n\nIt was, of course, impossible for Coningsby to urge his wishes against\nsuch representations. He was disappointed, rather amazed; but Madame\nColonna having sent for him to introduce her to some of the scenes and\ndetails of Eton life, his vexation was soon absorbed in the pride of\nacting in the face of his companions as the cavalier of a beautiful\nlady, and becoming the cicerone of the most brilliant party that had\nattended Montem. He presented his friends, too, to Lord. Monmouth, who\ngave them a cordial invitation to dine with him at his hotel at Windsor,\nwhich they warmly accepted. Buckhurst delighted the Marquess by his\nreckless genius. Even Lucretia deigned to appear amused; especially\nwhen, on visiting the upper school, the name of CARDIFF, the title Lord\nMonmouth bore in his youthful days, was pointed out to her by Coningsby,\ncut with his grandfather's own knife on the classic panels of that\nmemorable wall in which scarcely a name that has flourished in our\nhistory, since the commencement of the eighteenth century, may not be\nobserved with curious admiration.\n\nIt was the humour of Lord Monmouth that the boys should be entertained\nwith the most various and delicious banquet that luxury could devise or\nmoney could command. For some days beforehand orders had been given for\nthe preparation of this festival. Our friends did full justice to their\nLucullus; Buckhurst especially, who gave his opinion on the most refined\ndishes with all the intrepidity of saucy ignorance, and occasionally\nshook his head over a glass of Hermitage or C\u00c3\u00b4te R\u00c3\u00b4tie with a\ndissatisfaction which a satiated Sybarite could not have exceeded.\nConsidering all things, Coningsby and his friends exhibited a great deal\nof self-command; but they were gay, even to the verge of frolic. But\nthen the occasion justified it, as much as their youth. All were in high\nspirits. Madame Colonna declared that she had met nothing in England\nequal to Montem; that it was a Protestant Carnival; and that its only\nfault was that it did not last forty days. The Prince himself was all\nanimation, and took wine with every one of the Etonians several times.\nAll went on flowingly until Mr. Rigby contradicted Buckhurst on some\npoint of Eton discipline, which Buckhurst would not stand. He rallied\nMr. Rigby roundly, and Coningsby, full of champagne, and owing Rigby\nseveral years of contradiction, followed up the assault. Lord Monmouth,\nwho liked a butt, and had a weakness for boisterous gaiety, slily\nencouraged the boys, till Rigby began to lose his temper and get noisy.\n\nThe lads had the best of it; they said a great many funny things,\nand delivered themselves of several sharp retorts; whereas there was\nsomething ridiculous in Rigby putting forth his 'slashing' talents\nagainst such younkers. However, he brought the infliction on himself by\nhis strange habit of deciding on subjects of which he knew nothing, and\nof always contradicting persons on the very subjects of which they were\nnecessarily masters.\n\nTo see Rigby baited was more amusement to Lord Monmouth even than\nMontem. Lucian Gay, however, when the affair was getting troublesome,\ncame forward as a diversion. He sang an extemporaneous song on the\nceremony of the day, and introduced the names of all the guests at the\ndinner, and of a great many other persons besides. This was capital! The\nboys were in raptures, but when the singer threw forth a verse about Dr.\nKeate, the applause became uproarious.\n\n'Good-bye, my dear Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, when he bade his\ngrandson farewell. 'I am going abroad again; I cannot remain in this\nRadical-ridden country. Remember, though I am away, Monmouth House is\nyour home, at least so long as it belongs to me. I understand my tailor\nhas turned Liberal, and is going to stand for one of the metropolitan\ndistricts, a friend of Lord Durham; perhaps I shall find him in it when\nI return. I fear there are evil days for the NEW GENERATION!'\n\nEND OF BOOK I.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was early in November, 1834, and a large shooting party was assembled\nat Beaumanoir, the seat of that great nobleman, who was the father\nof Henry Sydney. England is unrivalled for two things, sporting and\npolitics. They were combined at Beaumanoir; for the guests came not\nmerely to slaughter the Duke's pheasants, but to hold council on the\nprospects of the party, which it was supposed by the initiated, began at\nthis time to indicate some symptoms of brightening.\n\nThe success of the Reform Ministry on their first appeal to the new\nconstituency which they had created, had been fatally complete. But the\ntriumph was as destructive to the victors as to the vanquished.\n\n'We are too strong,' prophetically exclaimed one of the fortunate\ncabinet, which found itself supported by an inconceivable majority of\nthree hundred. It is to be hoped that some future publisher of private\nmemoirs may have preserved some of the traits of that crude and\nshort-lived parliament, when old Cobbett insolently thrust Sir Robert\nfrom the prescriptive seat of the chief of opposition, and treasury\nunderstrappers sneered at the 'queer lot' that had arrived from Ireland,\nlittle foreseeing what a high bidding that 'queer lot' would eventually\ncommand. Gratitude to Lord Grey was the hustings-cry at the end of 1832,\nthe pretext that was to return to the new-modelled House of Commons\nnone but men devoted to the Whig cause. The successful simulation,\nlike everything that is false, carried within it the seeds of its\nown dissolution. Ingratitude to Lord Grey was more the fashion at the\ncommencement of 1834, and before the close of that eventful year, the\nonce popular Reform Ministry was upset, and the eagerly-sought Reformed\nParliament dissolved!\n\nIt can scarcely be alleged that the public was altogether unprepared for\nthis catastrophe. Many deemed it inevitable; few thought it imminent.\nThe career of the Ministry, and the existence of the Parliament, had\nindeed from the first been turbulent and fitful. It was known, from\nauthority, that there were dissensions in the cabinet, while a House\nof Commons which passed votes on subjects not less important than\nthe repeal of a tax, or the impeachment of a judge, on one night, and\nrescinded its resolutions on the following, certainly established\nno increased claims to the confidence of its constituents in its\ndiscretion. Nevertheless, there existed at this period a prevalent\nconviction that the Whig party, by a great stroke of state, similar in\nmagnitude and effect to that which in the preceding century had changed\nthe dynasty, had secured to themselves the government of this country\nfor, at least, the lives of the present generation. And even the\nwell-informed in such matters were inclined to look upon the perplexing\ncircumstances to which we have alluded rather as symptoms of a want\nof discipline in a new system of tactics, than as evidences of any\nessential and deeply-rooted disorder.\n\nThe startling rapidity, however, of the strange incidents of 1834; the\nindignant, soon to become vituperative, secession of a considerable\nsection of the cabinet, some of them esteemed too at that time among\nits most efficient members; the piteous deprecation of 'pressure from\nwithout,' from lips hitherto deemed too stately for entreaty, followed\nby the Trades' Union, thirty thousand strong, parading in procession\nto Downing-street; the Irish negotiations of Lord Hatherton, strange\nblending of complex intrigue and almost infantile ingenuousness; the\nstill inexplicable resignation of Lord Althorp, hurriedly followed by\nhis still more mysterious resumption of power, the only result of his\nprecipitate movements being the fall of Lord Grey himself, attended by\ncircumstances which even a friendly historian could scarcely describe\nas honourable to his party or dignified to himself; latterly, the\nextemporaneous address of King William to the Bishops; the vagrant\nand grotesque apocalypse of the Lord Chancellor; and the fierce\nrecrimination and memorable defiance of the Edinburgh banquet, all these\nimpressive instances of public affairs and public conduct had\ncombined to create a predominant opinion that, whatever might be the\nconsequences, the prolonged continuance of the present party in power\nwas a clear impossibility.\n\nIt is evident that the suicidal career of what was then styled the\nLiberal party had been occasioned and stimulated by its unnatural excess\nof strength. The apoplectic plethora of 1834 was not less fatal than\nthe paralytic tenuity of 1841. It was not feasible to gratify so many\nambitions, or to satisfy so many expectations. Every man had his double;\nthe heels of every placeman were dogged by friendly rivals ready to trip\nthem up. There were even two cabinets; the one that met in council, and\nthe one that met in cabal. The consequence of destroying the legitimate\nOpposition of the country was, that a moiety of the supporters of\nGovernment had to discharge the duties of Opposition.\n\nHerein, then, we detect the real cause of all that irregular and\nunsettled carriage of public men which so perplexed the nation after the\npassing of the Reform Act. No government can be long secure without a\nformidable Opposition. It reduces their supporters to that tractable\nnumber which can be managed by the joint influences of fruition and of\nhope. It offers vengeance to the discontented, and distinction to the\nambitious; and employs the energies of aspiring spirits, who otherwise\nmay prove traitors in a division or assassins in a debate.\n\nThe general election of 1832 abrogated the Parliamentary Opposition of\nEngland, which had practically existed for more than a century and\na half. And what a series of equivocal transactions and mortifying\nadventures did the withdrawal of this salutary restraint entail on the\nparty which then so loudly congratulated themselves and the country that\nthey were at length relieved from its odious repression! In the hurry of\nexistence one is apt too generally to pass over the political history\nof the times in which we ourselves live. The two years that followed the\nReform of the House of Commons are full of instruction, on which a young\nman would do well to ponder. It is hardly possible that he could rise\nfrom the study of these annals without a confirmed disgust for political\nintrigue; a dazzling practice, apt at first to fascinate youth, for it\nappeals at once to our invention and our courage, but one which really\nshould only be the resource of the second-rate. Great minds must trust\nto great truths and great talents for their rise, and nothing else.\n\nWhile, however, as the autumn of 1834 advanced, the people of this\ncountry became gradually sensible of the necessity of some change in the\ncouncils of their Sovereign, no man felt capable of predicting by what\nmeans it was to be accomplished, or from what quarry the new materials\nwere to be extracted. The Tory party, according to those perverted views\nof Toryism unhappily too long prevalent in this country, was held to\nbe literally defunct, except by a few old battered crones of office,\ncrouched round the embers of faction which they were fanning, and\nmuttering 'reaction' in mystic whispers. It cannot be supposed indeed\nfor a moment, that the distinguished personage who had led that party in\nthe House of Commons previously to the passing of the act of 1832, ever\ndespaired in consequence of his own career. His then time of life, the\nperfection, almost the prime, of manhood; his parliamentary practice,\ndoubly estimable in an inexperienced assembly; his political knowledge;\nhis fair character and reputable position; his talents and tone as a\npublic speaker, which he had always aimed to adapt to the habits and\nculture of that middle class from which it was concluded the benches of\nthe new Parliament were mainly to be recruited, all these were qualities\nthe possession of which must have assured a mind not apt to be disturbed\nin its calculations by any intemperate heats, that with time and\npatience the game was yet for him.\n\nUnquestionably, whatever may have been insinuated, this distinguished\nperson had no inkling that his services in 1834 might be claimed by\nhis Sovereign. At the close of the session of that year he had quitted\nEngland with his family, and had arrived at Rome, where it was his\nintention to pass the winter. The party charges that have imputed to him\na previous and sinister knowledge of the intentions of the Court, appear\nto have been made not only in ignorance of the personal character, but\nof the real position, of the future minister.\n\nIt had been the misfortune of this eminent gentleman when he first\nentered public life, to become identified with a political connection\nwhich, having arrogated to itself the name of an illustrious historical\nparty, pursued a policy which was either founded on no principle\nwhatever, or on principles exactly contrary to those which had always\nguided the conduct of the great Tory leaders. The chief members of this\nofficial confederacy were men distinguished by none of the conspicuous\nqualities of statesmen. They had none of the divine gifts that govern\nsenates and guide councils. They were not orators; they were not men of\ndeep thought or happy resource, or of penetrative and sagacious minds.\nTheir political ken was essentially dull and contracted. They expended\nsome energy in obtaining a defective, blundering acquaintance with\nforeign affairs; they knew as little of the real state of their own\ncountry as savages of an approaching eclipse. This factious league had\nshuffled themselves into power by clinging to the skirts of a great\nminister, the last of Tory statesmen, but who, in the unparalleled\nand confounding emergencies of his latter years, had been forced,\nunfortunately for England, to relinquish Toryism. His successors\ninherited all his errors without the latent genius, which in him might\nhave still rallied and extricated him from the consequences of his\ndisasters. His successors did not merely inherit his errors; they\nexaggerated, they caricatured them. They rode into power on a springtide\nof all the rampant prejudices and rancorous passions of their time.\nFrom the King to the boor their policy was a mere pandering to\npublic ignorance. Impudently usurping the name of that party of\nwhich nationality, and therefore universality, is the essence,\nthese pseudo-Tories made Exclusion the principle of their political\nconstitution, and Restriction the genius of their commercial code.\n\nThe blind goddess that plays with human fortunes has mixed up the memory\nof these men with traditions of national glory. They conducted to a\nprosperous conclusion the most renowned war in which England has ever\nbeen engaged. Yet every military conception that emanated from their\ncabinet was branded by their characteristic want of grandeur. Chance,\nhowever, sent them a great military genius, whom they treated for a long\ntime with indifference, and whom they never heartily supported until\nhis career had made him their master. His transcendent exploits, and\nEuropean events even greater than his achievements, placed in the\nmanikin grasp of the English ministry, the settlement of Europe.\n\nThe act of the Congress of Vienna remains the eternal monument of their\ndiplomatic knowledge and political sagacity. Their capital feats were\nthe creation of two kingdoms, both of which are already erased from\nthe map of Europe. They made no single preparation for the inevitable,\nalmost impending, conjunctures of the East. All that remains of\nthe pragmatic arrangements of the mighty Congress of Vienna is the\nmediatisation of the petty German princes.\n\nBut the settlement of Europe by the pseudo-Tories was the dictate of\ninspiration compared with their settlement of England. The peace of\nParis found the government of this country in the hands of a body of men\nof whom it is no exaggeration to say that they were ignorant of every\nprinciple of every branch of political science. So long as our domestic\nadministration was confined merely to the raising of a revenue, they\nlevied taxes with gross facility from the industry of a country too busy\nto criticise or complain. But when the excitement and distraction of\nwar had ceased, and they were forced to survey the social elements\nthat surrounded them, they seemed, for the first time, to have become\nconscious of their own incapacity. These men, indeed, were the mere\nchildren of routine. They prided themselves on being practical men. In\nthe language of this defunct school of statesmen, a practical man is a\nman who practises the blunders of his predecessors.\n\nNow commenced that Condition-of-England Question of which our generation\nhears so much. During five-and-twenty years every influence that can\ndevelop the energies and resources of a nation had been acting with\nconcentrated stimulation on the British Isles. National peril and\nnational glory; the perpetual menace of invasion, the continual triumph\nof conquest; the most extensive foreign commerce that was ever conducted\nby a single nation; an illimitable currency; an internal trade supported\nby swarming millions whom manufacturers and inclosure-bills summoned\ninto existence; above all, the supreme control obtained by man over\nmechanic power, these are some of the causes of that rapid advance of\nmaterial civilisation in England, to which the annals of the world can\nafford no parallel. But there was no proportionate advance in our moral\ncivilisation. In the hurry-skurry of money-making, men-making, and\nmachine-making, we had altogether outgrown, not the spirit, but the\norganisation, of our institutions.\n\nThe peace came; the stimulating influences suddenly ceased; the people,\nin a novel and painful position, found themselves without guides.\nThey went to the ministry; they asked to be guided; they asked to be\ngoverned. Commerce requested a code; trade required a currency; the\nunfranchised subject solicited his equal privilege; suffering labour\nclamoured for its rights; a new race demanded education. What did the\nministry do?\n\nThey fell into a panic. Having fulfilled during their lives the duties\nof administration, they were frightened because they were called upon,\nfor the first time, to perform the functions of government. Like all\nweak men, they had recourse to what they called strong measures. They\ndetermined to put down the multitude. They thought they were imitating\nMr. Pitt, because they mistook disorganisation for sedition.\n\nTheir projects of relief were as ridiculous as their system of coercion\nwas ruthless; both were alike founded in intense ignorance. When we\nrecall Mr. Vansittart with his currency resolutions; Lord Castlereagh\nwith his plans for the employment of labour; and Lord Sidmouth with his\nplots for ensnaring the laborious; we are tempted to imagine that the\npresent epoch has been one of peculiar advances in political ability,\nand marvel how England could have attained her present pitch under a\nseries of such governors.\n\nWe should, however, be labouring under a very erroneous impression. Run\nover the statesmen that have figured in England since the accession\nof the present family, and we may doubt whether there be one, with the\nexception perhaps of the Duke of Newcastle, who would have been a worthy\ncolleague of the council of Mr. Perceval, or the early cabinet of Lord\nLiverpool. Assuredly the genius of Bolingbroke and the sagacity of\nWalpole would have alike recoiled from such men and such measures. And\nif we take the individuals who were governing England immediately before\nthe French Revolution, one need only refer to the speeches of Mr. Pitt,\nand especially to those of that profound statesman and most instructed\nman, Lord Shelburne, to find that we can boast no remarkable superiority\neither in political justice or in political economy. One must attribute\nthis degeneracy, therefore, to the long war and our insular position,\nacting upon men naturally of inferior abilities, and unfortunately, in\naddition, of illiterate habits.\n\nIn the meantime, notwithstanding all the efforts of the political\nPanglosses who, in evening Journals and Quarterly Reviews were\ncontinually proving that this was the best of all possible governments,\nit was evident to the ministry itself that the machine must stop. The\nclass of Rigbys indeed at this period, one eminently favourable to that\nfungous tribe, greatly distinguished themselves. They demonstrated in a\nmanner absolutely convincing, that it was impossible for any person to\npossess any ability, knowledge, or virtue, any capacity of reasoning,\nany ray of fancy or faculty of imagination, who was not a supporter of\nthe existing administration. If any one impeached the management of a\ndepartment, the public was assured that the accuser had embezzled;\nif any one complained of the conduct of a colonial governor, the\ncomplainant was announced as a returned convict. An amelioration of\nthe criminal code was discountenanced because a search in the parish\nregister of an obscure village proved that the proposer had not been\nborn in wedlock. A relaxation of the commercial system was denounced\nbecause one of its principal advocates was a Socinian. The inutility of\nParliamentary Reform was ever obvious since Mr. Rigby was a member of\nthe House of Commons.\n\nTo us, with our _Times_ newspaper every morning on our breakfast-table,\nbringing, on every subject which can interest the public mind, a degree\nof information and intelligence which must form a security against\nany prolonged public misconception, it seems incredible that only\nfive-and-twenty years ago the English mind could have been so ridden\nand hoodwinked, and that, too, by men of mean attainments and moderate\nabilities. But the war had directed the energies of the English people\ninto channels by no means favourable to political education. Conquerors\nof the world, with their ports filled with the shipping of every clime,\nand their manufactories supplying the European continent, in the art\nof self-government, that art in which their fathers excelled, they had\nbecome literally children; and Rigby and his brother hirelings were the\nnurses that frightened them with hideous fables and ugly words.\n\nNotwithstanding, however, all this successful mystification, the\nArch-Mediocrity who presided, rather than ruled, over this Cabinet\nof Mediocrities, became hourly more conscious that the inevitable\ntransition from fulfilling the duties of an administration to performing\nthe functions of a government could not be conducted without talents and\nknowledge. The Arch-Mediocrity had himself some glimmering traditions\nof political science. He was sprung from a laborious stock, had received\nsome training, and though not a statesman, might be classed among\nthose whom the Lord Keeper Williams used to call 'statemongers.' In a\nsubordinate position his meagre diligence and his frigid method might\nnot have been without value; but the qualities that he possessed were\nmisplaced; nor can any character be conceived less invested with the\nhappy properties of a leader. In the conduct of public affairs his\ndisposition was exactly the reverse of that which is the characteristic\nof great men. He was peremptory in little questions, and great ones he\nleft open.\n\nIn the natural course of events, in 1819 there ought to have been a\nchange of government, and another party in the state should have entered\ninto office; but the Whigs, though they counted in their ranks at that\nperiod an unusual number of men of great ability, and formed, indeed, a\ncompact and spirited opposition, were unable to contend against the new\nadjustment of borough influence which had occurred during the war,\nand under the protracted administration by which that war had been\nconducted. New families had arisen on the Tory side that almost rivalled\nold Newcastle himself in their electioneering management; and it was\nevident that, unless some reconstruction of the House of Commons could\nbe effected, the Whig party could never obtain a permanent hold of\nofficial power. Hence, from that period, the Whigs became Parliamentary\nReformers.\n\nIt was inevitable, therefore, that the country should be governed by the\nsame party; indispensable that the ministry should be renovated by new\nbrains and blood. Accordingly, a Mediocrity, not without repugnance, was\ninduced to withdraw, and the great name of Wellington supplied his place\nin council. The talents of the Duke, as they were then understood, were\nnot exactly of the kind most required by the cabinet, and his colleagues\nwere careful that he should not occupy too prominent a post; but\nstill it was an impressive acquisition, and imparted to the ministry a\nsemblance of renown.\n\nThere was an individual who had not long entered public life, but who\nhad already filled considerable, though still subordinate offices.\nHaving acquired a certain experience of the duties of administration,\nand distinction for his mode of fulfilling them, he had withdrawn\nfrom his public charge; perhaps because he found it a barrier to the\nattainment of that parliamentary reputation for which he had already\nshown both a desire and a capacity; perhaps because, being young and\nindependent, he was not over-anxious irremediably to identify his career\nwith a school of politics of the infallibility of which his experience\nmight have already made him a little sceptical. But he possessed the\ntalents that were absolutely wanted, and the terms were at his own\ndictation. Another, and a very distinguished Mediocrity, who would not\nresign, was thrust out, and Mr. Peel became Secretary of State.\n\nFrom this moment dates that intimate connection between the Duke\nof Wellington and the present First Minister, which has exercised a\nconsiderable influence over the career of individuals and the course of\naffairs. It was the sympathetic result of superior minds placed among\ninferior intelligences, and was, doubtless, assisted by a then mutual\nconviction, that the difference of age, the circumstance of sitting in\ndifferent houses, and the general contrast of their previous pursuits\nand accomplishments, rendered personal rivalry out of the question. From\nthis moment, too, the domestic government of the country assumed a new\ncharacter, and one universally admitted to have been distinguished by a\nspirit of enlightened progress and comprehensive amelioration.\n\nA short time after this, a third and most distinguished Mediocrity died;\nand Canning, whom they had twice worried out of the cabinet, where they\nhad tolerated him some time in an obscure and ambiguous position, was\nrecalled just in time from his impending banishment, installed in the\nfirst post in the Lower House, and intrusted with the seals of the\nForeign Office. The Duke of Wellington had coveted them, nor could Lord\nLiverpool have been insensible to his Grace's peculiar fitness for such\nduties; but strength was required in the House of Commons, where they\nhad only one Secretary of State, a young man already distinguished, yet\nuntried as a leader, and surrounded by colleagues notoriously incapable\nto assist him in debate.\n\nThe accession of Mr. Canning to the cabinet, in a position, too, of\nsurpassing influence, soon led to a further weeding of the Mediocrities,\nand, among other introductions, to the memorable entrance of Mr.\nHuskisson. In this wise did that cabinet, once notable only for the\nabsence of all those qualities which authorise the possession of power,\ncome to be generally esteemed as a body of men, who, for parliamentary\neloquence, official practice, political information, sagacity in\ncouncil, and a due understanding of their epoch, were inferior to none\nthat had directed the policy of the empire since the Revolution.\n\nIf we survey the tenor of the policy of the Liverpool Cabinet during the\nlatter moiety of its continuance, we shall find its characteristic to be\na partial recurrence to those frank principles of government which\nMr. Pitt had revived during the latter part of the last century from\nprecedents that had been set us, either in practice or in dogma, during\nits earlier period, by statesmen who then not only bore the title,\nbut professed the opinions, of Tories. Exclusive principles in the\nconstitution, and restrictive principles in commerce, have grown up\ntogether; and have really nothing in common with the ancient character\nof our political settlement, or the manners and customs of the English\npeople. Confidence in the loyalty of the nation, testified by munificent\ngrants of rights and franchises, and favour to an expansive system of\ntraffic, were distinctive qualities of the English sovereignty, until\nthe House of Commons usurped the better portion of its prerogatives. A\nwidening of our electoral scheme, great facilities to commerce, and the\nrescue of our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects from the Puritanic yoke,\nfrom fetters which have been fastened on them by English Parliaments in\nspite of the protests and exertions of English Sovereigns; these were\nthe three great elements and fundamental truths of the real Pitt system,\na system founded on the traditions of our monarchy, and caught from the\nwritings, the speeches, the councils of those who, for the sake of these\nand analogous benefits, had ever been anxious that the Sovereign of\nEngland should never be degraded into the position of a Venetian Doge.\n\nIt is in the plunder of the Church that we must seek for the primary\ncause of our political exclusion, and our commercial restraint. That\nunhallowed booty created a factitious aristocracy, ever fearful that\nthey might be called upon to regorge their sacrilegious spoil. To\nprevent this they took refuge in political religionism, and paltering\nwith the disturbed consciences, or the pious fantasies, of a portion of\nthe people, they organised them into religious sects. These became the\nunconscious Praetorians of their ill-gotten domains. At the head\nof these religionists, they have continued ever since to govern, or\npowerfully to influence this country. They have in that time pulled\ndown thrones and churches, changed dynasties, abrogated and remodelled\nparliaments; they have disfranchised Scotland and confiscated Ireland.\nOne may admire the vigour and consistency of the Whig party, and\nrecognise in their career that unity of purpose that can only spring\nfrom a great principle; but the Whigs introduced sectarian religion,\nsectarian religion led to political exclusion, and political exclusion\nwas soon accompanied by commercial restraint.\n\nIt would be fanciful to assume that the Liverpool Cabinet, in their\nameliorating career, was directed by any desire to recur to the\nprimordial tenets of the Tory party. That was not an epoch when\nstatesmen cared to prosecute the investigation of principles. It was\na period of happy and enlightened practice. A profounder policy is the\noffspring of a time like the present, when the original postulates of\ninstitutions are called in question. The Liverpool Cabinet unconsciously\napproximated to these opinions, because from careful experiment they\nwere convinced of their beneficial tendency, and they thus bore an\nunintentional and impartial testimony to their truth. Like many men, who\nthink they are inventors, they were only reproducing ancient wisdom.\n\nBut one must ever deplore that this ministry, with all their talents and\ngenerous ardour, did not advance to principles. It is always perilous to\nadopt expediency as a guide; but the choice may be sometimes imperative.\nThese statesmen, however, took expediency for their director, when\nprinciple would have given them all that expediency ensured, and much\nmore.\n\nThis ministry, strong in the confidence of the sovereign, the\nparliament, and the people, might, by the courageous promulgation of\ngreat historical truths, have gradually formed a public opinion, that\nwould have permitted them to organise the Tory party on a broad, a\npermanent, and national basis. They might have nobly effected a complete\nsettlement of Ireland, which a shattered section of this very cabinet\nwas forced a few years after to do partially, and in an equivocating\nand equivocal manner. They might have concluded a satisfactory\nreconstruction of the third estate, without producing that convulsion\nwith which, from its violent fabrication, our social system still\nvibrates. Lastly, they might have adjusted the rights and properties\nof our national industries in a manner which would have prevented that\nfierce and fatal rivalry that is now disturbing every hearth of the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nWe may, therefore, visit on the _laches_ of this ministry the\nintroduction of that new principle and power into our constitution which\nultimately may absorb all, AGITATION. This cabinet, then, with so much\nbrilliancy on its surface, is the real parent of the Roman Catholic\nAssociation, the Political Unions, the Anti-Corn-Law League.\n\nThere is no influence at the same time so powerful and so singular as\nthat of individual character. It arises as often from the weakness of\nthe character as from its strength. The dispersion of this clever and\nshowy ministry is a fine illustration of this truth. One morning the\nArch-Mediocrity himself died. At the first blush, it would seem that\nlittle difficulties could be experienced in finding his substitute. His\nlong occupation of the post proved, at any rate, that the qualification\nwas not excessive. But this cabinet, with its serene and blooming\nvisage, had been all this time charged with fierce and emulous\nambitions. They waited the signal, but they waited in grim repose.\nThe death of the nominal leader, whose formal superiority, wounding no\nvanity, and offending no pride, secured in their councils equality among\nthe able, was the tocsin of their anarchy. There existed in this cabinet\ntwo men, who were resolved immediately to be prime ministers; a third\nwho was resolved eventually to be prime minister, but would at any rate\noccupy no ministerial post without the lead of a House of Parliament;\nand a fourth, who felt himself capable of being prime minister, but\ndespaired of the revolution which could alone make him one; and who\nfound an untimely end when that revolution had arrived.\n\nHad Mr. Secretary Canning remained leader of the House of Commons under\nthe Duke of Wellington, all that he would have gained by the death of\nLord Liverpool was a master. Had the Duke of Wellington become Secretary\nof State under Mr. Canning he would have materially advanced his\npolitical position, not only by holding the seals of a high department\nin which he was calculated to excel, but by becoming leader of the\nHouse of Lords. But his Grace was induced by certain court intriguers to\nbelieve that the King would send for him, and he was also aware that Mr.\nPeel would no longer serve under any ministry in the House of Commons.\nUnder any circumstances it would have been impossible to keep the\nLiverpool Cabinet together. The struggle, therefore, between the Duke of\nWellington and 'my dear Mr. Canning' was internecine, and ended somewhat\nunexpectedly.\n\nAnd here we must stop to do justice to our friend Mr. Rigby, whose\nconduct on this occasion was distinguished by a bustling dexterity which\nwas quite charming. He had, as we have before intimated, on the credit\nof some clever lampoons written during the Queen's trial, which were,\nin fact, the effusions of Lucian Gay, wriggled himself into a sort of\noccasional unworthy favour at the palace, where he was half butt and\nhalf buffoon. Here, during the interregnum occasioned by the death, or\nrather inevitable retirement, of Lord Liverpool, Mr. Rigby contrived\nto scrape up a conviction that the Duke was the winning horse, and in\nconsequence there appeared a series of leading articles in a notorious\nevening newspaper, in which it was, as Tadpole and Taper declared, most\n'slashingly' shown, that the son of an actress could never be tolerated\nas a Prime Minister of England. Not content with this, and never\ndoubting for a moment the authentic basis of his persuasion, Mr. Rigby\npoured forth his coarse volubility on the subject at several of the new\nclubs which he was getting up in order to revenge himself for having\nbeen black-balled at White's.\n\nWhat with arrangements about Lord Monmouth's boroughs, and the lucky\nbottling of some claret which the Duke had imported on Mr. Rigby's\nrecommendation, this distinguished gentleman contrived to pay almost\nhourly visits at Apsley House, and so bullied Tadpole and Taper that\nthey scarcely dared address him. About four-and-twenty hours before the\nresult, and when it was generally supposed that the Duke was in, Mr.\nRigby, who had gone down to Windsor to ask his Majesty the date of some\nobscure historical incident, which Rigby, of course, very well knew,\nfound that audiences were impossible, that Majesty was agitated, and\nlearned, from an humble but secure authority, that in spite of all his\nslashing articles, and Lucian Gay's parodies of the Irish melodies,\nCanning was to be Prime Minister.\n\nThis would seem something of a predicament! To common minds; there are\nno such things as scrapes for gentlemen with Mr. Rigby's talents for\naction. He had indeed, in the world, the credit of being an adept in\nmachinations, and was supposed ever to be involved in profound and\ncomplicated contrivances. This was quite a mistake. There was nothing\nprofound about Mr. Rigby; and his intellect was totally incapable of\ndevising or sustaining an intricate or continuous scheme. He was, in\nshort, a man who neither felt nor thought; but who possessed, in a\nvery remarkable degree, a restless instinct for adroit baseness. On the\npresent occasion he got into his carriage, and drove at the utmost speed\nfrom Windsor to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State was engaged\nwhen he arrived; but Mr. Rigby would listen to no difficulties. He\nrushed upstairs, flung open the door, and with agitated countenance, and\neyes suffused with tears, threw himself into the arms of the astonished\nMr. Canning.\n\n'All is right,' exclaimed the devoted Rigby, in broken tones; 'I have\nconvinced the King that the First Minister must be in the House of\nCommons. No one knows it but myself; but it is certain.'\n\nWe have seen that at an early period of his career, Mr. Peel withdrew\nfrom official life. His course had been one of unbroken prosperity; the\nhero of the University had become the favourite of the House of Commons.\nHis retreat, therefore, was not prompted by chagrin. Nor need it have\nbeen suggested by a calculating ambition, for the ordinary course of\nevents was fast bearing to him all to which man could aspire. One\nmight rather suppose, that he had already gained sufficient experience,\nperhaps in his Irish Secretaryship, to make him pause in that career of\nsuperficial success which education and custom had hitherto chalked out\nfor him, rather than the creative energies of his own mind. A thoughtful\nintellect may have already detected elements in our social system which\nrequired a finer observation, and a more unbroken study, than the gyves\nand trammels of office would permit. He may have discovered that the\nrepresentation of the University, looked upon in those days as the\nblue ribbon of the House of Commons, was a sufficient fetter without\nunnecessarily adding to its restraint. He may have wished to reserve\nhimself for a happier occasion, and a more progressive period. He may\nhave felt the strong necessity of arresting himself in his rapid career\nof felicitous routine, to survey his position in calmness, and to\ncomprehend the stirring age that was approaching.\n\nFor that, he could not but be conscious that the education which he had\nconsummated, however ornate and refined, was not sufficient. That age\nof economical statesmanship which Lord Shelburne had predicted in 1787,\nwhen he demolished, in the House of Lords, Bishop Watson and the\nBalance of Trade, which Mr. Pitt had comprehended; and for which he was\npreparing the nation when the French Revolution diverted the public mind\ninto a stronger and more turbulent current, was again impending, while\nthe intervening history of the country had been prolific in events which\nhad aggravated the necessity of investigating the sources of the wealth\nof nations. The time had arrived when parliamentary preeminence could no\nlonger be achieved or maintained by gorgeous abstractions borrowed from\nBurke, or shallow systems purloined from De Lolme, adorned with Horatian\npoints, or varied with Virgilian passages. It was to be an age of\nabstruse disquisition, that required a compact and sinewy intellect,\nnurtured in a class of learning not yet honoured in colleges, and which\nmight arrive at conclusions conflicting with predominant prejudices.\n\nAdopting this view of the position of Mr. Peel, strengthened as it is by\nhis early withdrawal for a while from the direction of public affairs,\nit may not only be a charitable but a true estimate of the motives which\ninfluenced him in his conduct towards Mr. Canning, to conclude that he\nwas not guided in that transaction by the disingenuous rivalry\nusually imputed to him. His statement in Parliament of the determining\ncircumstances of his conduct, coupled with his subsequent and almost\nimmediate policy, may perhaps always leave this a painful and ambiguous\npassage in his career; but in passing judgment on public men, it behoves\nus ever to take large and extended views of their conduct; and previous\nincidents will often satisfactorily explain subsequent events, which,\nwithout their illustrating aid, are involved in misapprehension or\nmystery.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that Sir Robert Peel, from an early period,\nmeditated his emancipation from the political confederacy in which\nhe was implicated, and that he has been continually baffled in this\nproject. He broke loose from Lord Liverpool; he retired from Mr.\nCanning. Forced again into becoming the subordinate leader of the\nweakest government in parliamentary annals, he believed he had at length\nachieved his emancipation, when he declared to his late colleagues,\nafter the overthrow of 1830, that he would never again accept a\nsecondary position in office. But the Duke of Wellington was too old a\ntactician to lose so valuable an ally. So his Grace declared after the\nReform Bill was passed, as its inevitable result, that thenceforth\nthe Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Commons; and this\naphorism, cited as usual by the Duke's parasites as demonstration of his\nsupreme sagacity, was a graceful mode of resigning the preeminence which\nhad been productive of such great party disasters. It is remarkable\nthat the party who devised and passed the Reform Bill, and who, in\nconsequence, governed the nation for ten years, never once had their\nPrime Minister in the House of Commons: but that does not signify; the\nDuke's maxim is still quoted as an oracle almost equal in prescience\nto his famous query, 'How is the King's government to be carried on?'\na question to which his Grace by this time has contrived to give a\ntolerably practical answer.\n\nSir Robert Peel, who had escaped from Lord Liverpool, escaped from Mr.\nCanning, escaped even from the Duke of Wellington in 1832, was at\nlength caught in 1834; the victim of ceaseless intriguers, who neither\ncomprehended his position, nor that of their country.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nBeaumanoir was one of those Palladian palaces, vast and ornate, such\nas the genius of Kent and Campbell delighted in at the beginning of the\neighteenth century. Placed on a noble elevation, yet screened from the\nnorthern blast, its sumptuous front, connected with its far-spreading\nwings by Corinthian colonnades, was the boast and pride of the midland\ncounties. The surrounding gardens, equalling in extent the size of\nordinary parks, were crowded with temples dedicated to abstract virtues\nand to departed friends. Occasionally a triumphal arch celebrated a\ngeneral whom the family still esteemed a hero; and sometimes a votive\ncolumn commemorated the great statesman who had advanced the family a\nstep in the peerage. Beyond the limits of this pleasance the hart and\nhind wandered in a wilderness abounding in ferny coverts and green and\nstately trees.\n\nThe noble proprietor of this demesne had many of the virtues of his\nclass; a few of their failings. He had that public spirit which became\nhis station. He was not one of those who avoided the exertions and the\nsacrifices which should be inseparable from high position, by the hollow\npretext of a taste for privacy, and a devotion to domestic joys. He\nwas munificent, tender, and bounteous to the poor, and loved a flowing\nhospitality. A keen sportsman, he was not untinctured by letters,\nand had indeed a cultivated taste for the fine arts. Though an ardent\npolitician, he was tolerant to adverse opinions, and full of amenity\nto his opponents. A firm supporter of the corn-laws, he never refused\na lease. Notwithstanding there ran through his whole demeanour and the\nhabit of his mind, a vein of native simplicity that was full of charm,\nhis manner was finished. He never offended any one's self-love. His good\nbreeding, indeed, sprang from the only sure source of gentle manners,\na kind heart. To have pained others would have pained himself. Perhaps,\ntoo, this noble sympathy may have been in some degree prompted by the\nancient blood in his veins, an accident of lineage rather rare with the\nEnglish nobility. One could hardly praise him for the strong affections\nthat bound him to his hearth, for fortune had given him the most\npleasing family in the world; but, above all, a peerless wife.\n\nThe Duchess was one of those women who are the delight of existence. She\nwas sprung from a house not inferior to that with which she had blended,\nand was gifted with that rare beauty which time ever spares, so that she\nseemed now only the elder sister of her own beautiful daughters. She,\ntoo, was distinguished by that perfect good breeding which is the result\nof nature and not of education: for it may be found in a cottage, and\nmay be missed in a palace. 'Tis a genial regard for the feelings of\nothers that springs from an absence of selfishness. The Duchess, indeed,\nwas in every sense a fine lady; her manners were refined and full of\ndignity; but nothing in the world could have induced her to appear bored\nwhen another was addressing or attempting to amuse her. She was not one\nof those vulgar fine ladies who meet you one day with a vacant stare, as\nif unconscious of your existence, and address you on another in a tone\nof impertinent familiarity. Her temper, perhaps, was somewhat quick,\nwhich made this consideration for the feelings of others still more\nadmirable, for it was the result of a strict moral discipline acting\non a good heart. Although the best of wives and mothers, she had some\ncharity for her neighbours. Needing herself no indulgence, she could be\nindulgent; and would by no means favour that strait-laced morality\nthat would constrain the innocent play of the social body. She was\naccomplished, well read, and had a lively fancy. Add to this that\nsunbeam of a happy home, a gay and cheerful spirit in its mistress, and\none might form some faint idea of this gracious personage.\n\nThe eldest son of this house was now on the continent; of his\ntwo younger brothers, one was with his regiment and the other was\nConingsby's friend at Eton, our Henry Sydney. The two eldest daughters\nhad just married, on the same day, and at the same altar; and the\nremaining one, Theresa, was still a child.\n\nThe Duke had occupied a chief post in the Household under the late\nadministration, and his present guests chiefly consisted of his former\ncolleagues in office. There were several members of the late cabinet,\nseveral members for his Grace's late boroughs, looking very much like\nmartyrs, full of suffering and of hope. Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Taper were\nalso there; they too had lost their seats since 1832; but being men of\nbusiness, and accustomed from early life to look about them, they had\nalready commenced the combinations which on a future occasion were to\nbear them back to the assembly where they were so missed.\n\nTaper had his eye on a small constituency which had escaped the fatal\nschedules, and where he had what they called a 'connection;' that is to\nsay, a section of the suffrages who had a lively remembrance of Treasury\nfavours once bestowed by Mr. Taper, and who had not been so liberally\ndealt with by the existing powers. This connection of Taper was in time\nto leaven the whole mass of the constituent body, and make it rise in\nfull rebellion against its present liberal representative, who being\none of a majority of three hundred, could get nothing when he called at\nWhitehall or Downing Street.\n\nTadpole, on the contrary, who was of a larger grasp of mind than\nTaper, with more of imagination and device but not so safe a man, was\ncoquetting with a manufacturing town and a large constituency, where he\nwas to succeed by the aid of the Wesleyans, of which pious body he had\nsuddenly become a fervent admirer. The great Mr. Rigby, too, was a guest\nout of Parliament, nor caring to be in; but hearing that his friends had\nsome hopes, he thought he would just come down to dash them.\n\nThe political grapes were sour for Mr. Rigby; a prophet of evil, he\npreached only mortification and repentance and despair to his late\ncolleagues. It was the only satisfaction left Mr. Rigby, except assuring\nthe Duke that the finest pictures in his gallery were copies, and\nrecommending him to pull down Beaumanoir, and rebuild it on a design\nwith which Mr. Rigby would furnish him.\n\nThe battue and the banquet were over; the ladies had withdrawn; and the\nbutler placed fresh claret on the table.\n\n'And you really think you could give us a majority, Tadpole?' said the\nDuke.\n\nMr. Tadpole, with some ceremony, took a memorandum-book out of his\npocket, amid the smiles and the faint well-bred merriment of his\nfriends.\n\n'Tadpole is nothing without his book,' whispered Lord Fitz-Booby.\n\n'It is here,' said Mr. Tadpole, emphatically patting his volume, 'a\nclear working majority of twenty-two.'\n\n'Near sailing that!' cried the Duke.\n\n'A far better majority than the present Government have,' said Mr.\nTadpole.\n\n'There is nothing like a good small majority,' said Mr. Taper, 'and a\ngood registration.'\n\n'Ay! register, register, register!' said the Duke. 'Those were immortal\nwords.'\n\n'I can tell your Grace three far better ones,' said Mr. Tadpole, with a\nself-complacent air. 'Object, object, object!'\n\n'You may register, and you may object,' said Mr. Rigby, 'but you will\nnever get rid of Schedule A and Schedule B.'\n\n'But who could have supposed two years ago that affairs would be in\ntheir present position?' said Mr. Taper, deferentially.\n\n'I foretold it,' said Mr. Rigby. 'Every one knows that no government now\ncan last twelve months.'\n\n'We may make fresh boroughs,' said Taper. 'We have reduced Shabbyton at\nthe last registration under three hundred.'\n\n'And the Wesleyans!' said Tadpole. 'We never counted on the Wesleyans!'\n\n'I am told these Wesleyans are really a respectable body,' said Lord\nFitz-Booby. 'I believe there is no material difference between their\ntenets and those of the Establishment. I never heard of them much till\nlately. We have too long confounded them with the mass of Dissenters,\nbut their conduct at several of the later elections proves that they are\nfar from being unreasonable and disloyal individuals. When we come in,\nsomething should be done for the Wesleyans, eh, Rigby?'\n\n'All that your Lordship can do for the Wesleyans is what they will very\nshortly do for themselves, appropriate a portion of the Church Revenues\nto their own use.'\n\n'Nay, nay,' said Mr. Tadpole with a chuckle, 'I don't think we shall\nfind the Church attacked again in a hurry. I only wish they would try! A\ngood Church cry before a registration,' he continued, rubbing his hands;\n'eh, my Lord, I think that would do.'\n\n'But how are we to turn them out?' said the Duke.\n\n'Ah!' said Mr. Taper, 'that is a great question.'\n\n'What do you think of a repeal of the Malt Tax?' said Lord Fitz-Booby.\n'They have been trying it on in ----shire, and I am told it goes down\nvery well.'\n\n'No repeal of any tax,' said Taper, sincerely shocked, and shaking his\nhead; 'and the Malt Tax of all others. I am all against that.'\n\n'It is a very good cry though, if there be no other,' said Tadpole.\n\n'I am all for a religious cry,' said Taper. 'It means nothing, and, if\nsuccessful, does not interfere with business when we are in.'\n\n'You will have religious cries enough in a short time,' said Mr. Rigby,\nrather wearied of any one speaking but himself, and thereat he commenced\na discourse, which was, in fact, one of his 'slashing' articles in petto\non Church Reform, and which abounded in parallels between the present\naffairs and those of the reign of Charles I. Tadpole, who did not\npretend to know anything but the state of the registration, and Taper,\nwhose political reading was confined to an intimate acquaintance with\nthe Red Book and Beatson's Political Index, which he could repeat\nbackwards, were silenced. The Duke, who was well instructed and liked\nto be talked to, sipped his claret, and was rather amused by Rigby's\nlecture, particularly by one or two statements characterised by Rigby's\nhappy audacity, but which the Duke was too indolent to question. Lord\nFitz-Booby listened with his mouth open, but rather bored. At length,\nwhen there was a momentary pause, he said:\n\n'In my time, the regular thing was to move an amendment on the address.'\n\n'Quite out of the question,' exclaimed Tadpole, with a scoff.\n\n'Entirely given up,' said Taper, with a sneer.\n\n'If you will drink no more claret, we will go and hear some music,' said\nthe Duke.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nA breakfast at Beaumanoir was a meal of some ceremony. Every guest was\nexpected to attend, and at a somewhat early hour. Their host and hostess\nset them the example of punctuality. 'Tis an old form rigidly adhered to\nin some great houses, but, it must be confessed, does not contrast\nvery agreeably with the easier arrangements of establishments of less\npretension and of more modern order.\n\nThe morning after the dinner to which we have been recently introduced,\nthere was one individual absent from the breakfast-table whose\nnon-appearance could scarcely be passed over without notice; and several\ninquired with some anxiety, whether their host were indisposed.\n\n'The Duke has received some letters from London which detain him,'\nreplied the Duchess. 'He will join us.'\n\n'Your Grace will be glad to hear that your son Henry is very well,' said\nMr. Rigby; 'I heard of him this morning. Harry Coningsby enclosed me a\nletter for his grandfather, and tells me that he and Henry Sydney had\njust had a capital run with the King's hounds.'\n\n'It is three years since we have seen Mr. Coningsby,' said the Duchess.\n'Once he was often here. He was a great favourite of mine. I hardly ever\nknew a more interesting boy.'\n\n'Yes, I have done a great deal for him,' said Mr. Rigby. 'Lord Monmouth\nis fond of him, and wishes that he should make a figure; but how any one\nis to distinguish himself now, I am really at a loss to comprehend.'\n\n'But are affairs so very bad?' said the Duchess, smiling. 'I thought\nthat we were all regaining our good sense and good temper.'\n\n'I believe all the good sense and all the good temper in England are\nconcentrated in your Grace,' said Mr. Rigby, gallantly.\n\n'I should be sorry to be such a monopolist. But Lord Fitz-Booby was\ngiving me last night quite a glowing report of Mr. Tadpole's prospects\nfor the nation. We were all to have our own again; and Percy to carry\nthe county.'\n\n'My dear Madam, before twelve months are past, there will not be\na county in England. Why should there be? If boroughs are to be\ndisfranchised, why should not counties be destroyed?'\n\nAt this moment the Duke entered, apparently agitated. He bowed to his\nguests, and apologised for his unusual absence. 'The truth is,' he\ncontinued, 'I have just received a very important despatch. An event has\noccurred which may materially affect affairs. Lord Spencer is dead.'\n\nA thunderbolt in a summer sky, as Sir William Temple says, could not\nhave produced a greater sensation. The business of the repast ceased in\na moment. The knives and forks were suddenly silent. All was still.\n\n'It is an immense event,' said Tadpole.\n\n'I don't see my way,' said Taper.\n\n'When did he die?' said Lord Fitz-Booby.\n\n'I don't believe it,' said Mr. Rigby.\n\n'They have got their man ready,' said Tadpole.\n\n'It is impossible to say what will happen,' said Taper.\n\n'Now is the time for an amendment on the address,' said Fitz-Booby.\n\n'There are two reasons which convince me that Lord Spencer is not dead,'\nsaid Mr. Rigby.\n\n'I fear there is no doubt of it,' said the Duke, shaking his head.\n\n'Lord Althorp was the only man who could keep them together,' said Lord\nFitz-Booby.\n\n'On the contrary,' said Tadpole. 'If I be right in my man, and I have\nno doubt of it, you will have a radical programme, and they will be\nstronger than ever.'\n\n'Do you think they can get the steam up again?' said Taper, musingly.\n\n'They will bid high,' replied Tadpole. 'Nothing could be more\nunfortunate than this death. Things were going on so well and so\nquietly! The Wesleyans almost with us!'\n\n'And Shabbyton too!' mournfully exclaimed Taper. 'Another registration\nand quiet times, and I could have reduced the constituency to two\nhundred and fifty.'\n\n'If Lord Spencer had died on the 10th,' said Rigby, 'it must have been\nknown to Henry Rivers. And I have a letter from Henry Rivers by this\npost. Now, Althorp is in Northamptonshire, mark that, and Northampton is\na county--'\n\n'My dear Rigby,' said the Duke, 'pardon me for interrupting you.\nUnhappily, there is no doubt Lord Spencer is dead, for I am one of his\nexecutors.'\n\nThis announcement silenced even Mr. Rigby, and the conversation now\nentirely merged in speculations on what would occur. Numerous were\nthe conjectures hazarded, but the prevailing impression was, that this\nunforeseen event might embarrass those secret expectations of Court\nsuccour in which a certain section of the party had for some time reason\nto indulge.\n\nFrom the moment, however, of the announcement of Lord Spencer's death, a\nchange might be visibly observed in the tone of the party at Beaumanoir.\nThey became silent, moody, and restless. There seemed a general, though\nnot avowed, conviction that a crisis of some kind or other was at hand.\nThe post, too, brought letters every day from town teeming with fanciful\nspeculations, and occasionally mysterious hopes.\n\n'I kept this cover for Peel,' said the Duke pensively, as he loaded his\ngun on the morning of the 14th. 'Do you know, I was always against his\ngoing to Rome.'\n\n'It is very odd,' said Tadpole, 'but I was thinking of the very same\nthing.'\n\n'It will be fifteen years before England will see a Tory Government,'\nsaid Mr. Rigby, drawing his ramrod, 'and then it will only last five\nmonths.'\n\n'Melbourne, Althorp, and Durham, all in the Lords,' said Taper. 'Three\nleaders! They must quarrel.'\n\n'If Durham come in, mark me, he will dissolve on Household Suffrage and\nthe Ballot,' said Tadpole.\n\n'Not nearly so good a cry as Church,' replied Taper.\n\n'With the Malt Tax,' said Tadpole. 'Church, without the Malt Tax, will\nnot do against Household Suffrage and Ballot.'\n\n'Malt Tax is madness,' said Taper. 'A good farmer's friend cry without\nMalt Tax would work just as well.'\n\n'They will never dissolve,' said the Duke. 'They are so strong.'\n\n'They cannot go on with three hundred majority,' said Taper. 'Forty is\nas much as can be managed with open constituencies.'\n\n'If he had only gone to Paris instead of Rome!' said the Duke.\n\n'Yes,' said Mr. Rigby, 'I could have written to him then by every post,\nand undeceived him as to his position.'\n\n'After all he is the only man,' said the Duke; 'and I really believe the\ncountry thinks so.'\n\n'Pray, what is the country?' inquired Mr. Rigby. 'The country is\nnothing; it is the constituency you have to deal with.'\n\n'And to manage them you must have a good cry,' said Taper. 'All now\ndepends upon a good cry.'\n\n'So much for the science of politics,' said the Duke, bringing down a\npheasant. 'How Peel would have enjoyed this cover!'\n\n'He will have plenty of time for sport during his life,' said Mr. Rigby.\n\nOn the evening of the 15th of November, a despatch arrived at\nBeaumanoir, informing his Grace that the King had dismissed the Whig\nMinistry, and sent for the Duke of Wellington. Thus the first agitating\nsuspense was over; to be succeeded, however, by expectation still more\nanxious. It was remarkable that every individual suddenly found that he\nhad particular business in London which could not be neglected. The Duke\nvery properly pleaded his executorial duties; but begged his guests on\nno account to be disturbed by his inevitable absence. Lord Fitz-Booby\nhad just received a letter from his daughter, who was indisposed at\nBrighton, and he was most anxious to reach her. Tadpole had to receive\ndeputations from Wesleyans, and well-registered boroughs anxious to\nreceive well-principled candidates. Taper was off to get the first job\nat the contingent Treasury, in favour of the Borough of Shabbyton.\nMr. Rigby alone was silent; but he quietly ordered a post-chaise at\ndaybreak, and long before his fellow guests were roused from their\nslumbers, he was halfway to London, ready to give advice, either at the\npavilion or at Apsley House.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nAlthough it is far from improbable that, had Sir Robert Peel been in\nEngland in the autumn of 1834, the Whig government would not have been\ndismissed; nevertheless, whatever may now be the opinion of the policy\nof that measure; whether it be looked on as a premature movement which\nnecessarily led to the compact reorganisation of the Liberal party,\nor as a great stroke of State, which, by securing at all events a\ndissolution of the Parliament of 1832, restored the healthy balance of\nparties in the Legislature, questions into which we do not now wish\nto enter, it must be generally admitted, that the conduct of every\nindividual eminently concerned in that great historical transaction was\ncharacterised by the rarest and most admirable quality of public\nlife, moral courage. The Sovereign who dismissed a Ministry apparently\nsupported by an overwhelming majority in the Parliament and the nation,\nand called to his councils the absent chief of a parliamentary section,\nscarcely numbering at that moment one hundred and forty individuals, and\nof a party in the country supposed to be utterly discomfited by a\nrecent revolution; the two ministers who in this absence provisionally\nadministered the affairs of the kingdom in the teeth of an enraged\nand unscrupulous Opposition, and perhaps themselves not sustained by\na profound conviction, that the arrival of their expected leader would\nconvert their provisional into a permanent position; above all\nthe statesman who accepted the great charge at a time and under\ncircumstances which marred probably the deep projects of his own\nprescient sagacity and maturing ambition; were all men gifted with a\nhigh spirit of enterprise, and animated by that active fortitude which\nis the soul of free governments.\n\nIt was a lively season, that winter of 1834! What hopes, what fears, and\nwhat bets! From the day on which Mr. Hudson was to arrive at Rome to the\nelection of the Speaker, not a contingency that was not the subject of\na wager! People sprang up like mushrooms; town suddenly became full.\nEverybody who had been in office, and everybody who wished to be in\noffice; everybody who had ever had anything, and everybody who ever\nexpected to have anything, were alike visible. All of course by mere\naccident; one might meet the same men regularly every day for a month,\nwho were only 'passing through town.'\n\nNow was the time for men to come forward who had never despaired of\ntheir country. True they had voted for the Reform Bill, but that was to\nprevent a revolution. And now they were quite ready to vote against the\nReform Bill, but this was to prevent a dissolution. These are the true\npatriots, whose confidence in the good sense of their countrymen and in\ntheir own selfishness is about equal. In the meantime, the hundred and\nforty threw a grim glance on the numerous waiters on Providence, and\namiable trimmers, who affectionately enquired every day when news might\nbe expected of Sir Robert. Though too weak to form a government, and\nhaving contributed in no wise by their exertions to the fall of the\nlate, the cohort of Parliamentary Tories felt all the alarm of men who\nhave accidentally stumbled on some treasure-trove, at the suspicious\nsympathy of new allies. But, after all, who were to form the government,\nand what was the government to be? Was it to be a Tory government, or an\nEnlightened-Spirit-of-the-Age Liberal-Moderate-Reform government; was it\nto be a government of high philosophy or of low practice; of principle\nor of expediency; of great measures or of little men? A government of\nstatesmen or of clerks? Of Humbug or of Humdrum? Great questions these,\nbut unfortunately there was nobody to answer them. They tried the Duke;\nbut nothing could be pumped out of him. All that he knew, which he\ntold in his curt, husky manner, was, that he had to carry on the King's\ngovernment. As for his solitary colleague, he listened and smiled, and\nthen in his musical voice asked them questions in return, which is the\nbest possible mode of avoiding awkward inquiries. It was very unfair\nthis; for no one knew what tone to take; whether they should go down to\ntheir public dinners and denounce the Reform Act or praise it; whether\nthe Church was to be re-modelled or only admonished; whether Ireland was\nto be conquered or conciliated.\n\n'This can't go on much longer,' said Taper to Tadpole, as they reviewed\ntogether their electioneering correspondence on the 1st of December; 'we\nhave no cry.'\n\n'He is half way by this time,' said Tadpole; 'send an extract from a\nprivate letter to the _Standard_, dated Augsburg, and say he will be\nhere in four days.'\n\nAt last he came; the great man in a great position, summoned from Rome\nto govern England. The very day that he arrived he had his audience with\nthe King.\n\nIt was two days after this audience; the town, though November, in a\nstate of excitement; clubs crowded, not only morning rooms, but halls\nand staircases swarming with members eager to give and to receive\nrumours equally vain; streets lined with cabs and chariots, grooms and\nhorses; it was two days after this audience that Mr. Ormsby, celebrated\nfor his political dinners, gave one to a numerous party. Indeed his\nsaloons to-day, during the half-hour of gathering which precedes dinner,\noffered in the various groups, the anxious countenances, the inquiring\nvoices, and the mysterious whispers, rather the character of an Exchange\nor Bourse than the tone of a festive society.\n\nHere might be marked a murmuring knot of greyheaded privy-councillors,\nwho had held fat offices under Perceval and Liverpool, and who looked\nback to the Reform Act as to a hideous dream; there some middle-aged\naspirants might be observed who had lost their seats in the convulsion,\nbut who flattered themselves they had done something for the party\nin the interval, by spending nothing except their breath in fighting\nhopeless boroughs, and occasionally publishing a pamphlet, which really\nproduced less effect than chalking the walls. Light as air, and proud as\na young peacock, tripped on his toes a young Tory, who had contrived to\nkeep his seat in a Parliament where he had done nothing, but who thought\nan Under-Secretaryship was now secure, particularly as he was the son of\na noble Lord who had also in a public capacity plundered and blundered\nin the good old time. The true political adventurer, who with dull\ndesperation had stuck at nothing, had never neglected a treasury note,\nhad been present at every division, never spoke when he was asked to be\nsilent, and was always ready on any subject when they wanted him to open\nhis mouth; who had treated his leaders with servility even behind their\nbacks, and was happy for the day if a future Secretary of the Treasury\nbowed to him; who had not only discountenanced discontent in the party,\nbut had regularly reported in strict confidence every instance of\ninsubordination which came to his knowledge; might there too be detected\nunder all the agonies of the crisis; just beginning to feel the\ndread misgiving, whether being a slave and a sneak were sufficient\nqualifications for office, without family or connection. Poor fellow!\nhalf the industry he had wasted on his cheerless craft might have made\nhis fortune in some decent trade!\n\nIn dazzling contrast with these throes of low ambition, were some\nbrilliant personages who had just scampered up from Melton, thinking it\nprobable that Sir Robert might want some moral lords of the bed-chamber.\nWhatever may have been their private fears or feelings, all however\nseemed smiling and significant, as if they knew something if they chose\nto tell it, and that something very much to their own satisfaction.\nThe only grave countenance that was occasionally ushered into the room\nbelonged to some individual whose destiny was not in doubt, and who was\nalready practising the official air that was in future to repress the\nfamiliarity of his former fellow-stragglers.\n\n'Do you hear anything?' said a great noble who wanted something in the\ngeneral scramble, but what he knew not; only he had a vague feeling he\nought to have something, having made such great sacrifices.\n\n'There is a report that Clifford is to be Secretary to the Board of\nControl,' said Mr. Earwig, whose whole soul was in this subaltern\narrangement, of which the Minister of course had not even thought; 'but\nI cannot trace it to any authority.'\n\n'I wonder who will be their Master of the Horse,' said the great noble,\nloving gossip though he despised the gossiper.\n\n'Clifford has done nothing for the party,' said Mr. Earwig.\n\n'I dare say Rambrooke will have the Buckhounds,' said the great noble,\nmusingly.\n\n'Your Lordship has not heard Clifford's name mentioned?' continued Mr.\nEarwig.\n\n'I should think they had not come to that sort of thing,' said the great\nnoble, with ill-disguised contempt.' The first thing after the Cabinet\nis formed is the Household: the things you talk of are done last;' and\nhe turned upon his heel, and met the imperturbable countenance and clear\nsarcastic eye of Lord Eskdale.\n\n'You have not heard anything?' asked the great noble of his brother\npatrician.\n\n'Yes, a great deal since I have been in this room; but unfortunately it\nis all untrue.'\n\n'There is a report that Rambrooke is to have the Buck-hounds; but I\ncannot trace it to any authority.'\n\n'Pooh!' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'I don't see that Rambrooke should have the Buckhounds any more than\nanybody else. What sacrifices has he made?'\n\n'Past sacrifices are nothing,' said Lord Eskdale. 'Present sacrifices\nare the thing we want: men who will sacrifice their principles and join\nus.'\n\n'You have not heard Rambrooke's name mentioned?'\n\n'When a Minister has no Cabinet, and only one hundred and forty\nsupporters in the House of Commons, he has something else to think of\nthan places at Court,' said Lord Eskdale, as he slowly turned away to\nask Lucian Gay whether it were true that Jenny Colon was coming over.\n\nShortly after this, Henry Sydney's father, who dined with Mr. Ornisby,\ndrew Lord Eskdale into a window, and said in an undertone:\n\n'So there is to be a kind of programme: something is to be written.'\n\n'Well, we want a cue,' said Lord Eskdale. 'I heard of this last night:\nRigby has written something.'\n\nThe Duke shook his head.\n\n'No; Peel means to do it himself.'\n\nBut at this moment Mr. Ornisby begged his Grace to lead them to dinner.\n\n'Something is to be written.' It is curious to recall the vague terms\nin which the first projection of documents, that are to exercise a vast\ninfluence on the course of affairs or the minds of nations, is often\nmentioned. This 'something to be written' was written; and speedily; and\nhas ever since been talked of.\n\nWe believe we may venture to assume that at no period during the\nmovements of 1834-5 did Sir Robert Peel ever believe in the success\nof his administration. Its mere failure could occasion him little\ndissatisfaction; he was compensated for it by the noble opportunity\nafforded to him for the display of those great qualities, both moral and\nintellectual, which the swaddling-clothes of a routine prosperity had\nlong repressed, but of which his opposition to the Reform Bill had\ngiven to the nation a significant intimation. The brief administration\nelevated him in public opinion, and even in the eye of Europe; and it\nis probable that a much longer term of power would not have contributed\nmore to his fame.\n\nThe probable effect of the premature effort of his party on his future\nposition as a Minister was, however, far from being so satisfactory. At\nthe lowest ebb of his political fortunes, it cannot be doubted that Sir\nRobert Peel looked forward, perhaps through the vista of many years, to\na period when the national mind, arrived by reflection and experience\nat certain conclusions, would seek in him a powerful expositor of its\nconvictions. His time of life permitted him to be tranquil in adversity,\nand to profit by its salutary uses. He would then have acceded to power\nas the representative of a Creed, instead of being the leader of a\nConfederacy, and he would have been supported by earnest and enduring\nenthusiasm, instead of by that churlish sufferance which is the\nresult of a supposed balance of advantages in his favour. This is\nthe consequence of the tactics of those short-sighted intriguers, who\npersisted in looking upon a revolution as a mere party struggle, and\nwould not permit the mind of the nation to work through the inevitable\nphases that awaited it. In 1834, England, though frightened at the\nreality of Reform, still adhered to its phrases; it was inclined,\nas practical England, to maintain existing institutions; but, as\ntheoretical England, it was suspicious that they were indefensible.\n\nNo one had arisen either in Parliament, the Universities, or the Press,\nto lead the public mind to the investigation of principles; and not\nto mistake, in their reformations, the corruption of practice for\nfundamental ideas. It was this perplexed, ill-informed, jaded, shallow\ngeneration, repeating cries which they did not comprehend, and wearied\nwith the endless ebullitions of their own barren conceit, that Sir\nRobert Peel was summoned to govern. It was from such materials, ample\nin quantity, but in all spiritual qualities most deficient; with\ngreat numbers, largely acred, consoled up to their chins, but without\nknowledge, genius, thought, truth, or faith, that Sir Robert Peel was to\nform a 'great Conservative party on a comprehensive basis.' That he\ndid this like a dexterous politician, who can deny? Whether he realised\nthose prescient views of a great statesman in which he had doubtless\nindulged, and in which, though still clogged by the leadership of 1834,\nhe may yet find fame for himself and salvation for his country, is\naltogether another question. His difficult attempt was expressed in\nan address to his constituents, which now ranks among state papers.\nWe shall attempt briefly to consider it with the impartiality of the\nfuture.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe Tamworth Manifesto of 1834 was an attempt to construct a\nparty without principles; its basis therefore was necessarily\nLatitudinarianism; and its inevitable consequence has been Political\nInfidelity.\n\nAt an epoch of political perplexity and social alarm, the confederation\nwas convenient, and was calculated by aggregation to encourage the timid\nand confused. But when the perturbation was a little subsided, and\nmen began to inquire why they were banded together, the difficulty of\ndefining their purpose proved that the league, however respectable, was\nnot a party. The leaders indeed might profit by their eminent position\nto obtain power for their individual gratification, but it was\nimpossible to secure their followers that which, after all, must be the\ngreat recompense of a political party, the putting in practice of their\nopinions; for they had none.\n\nThere was indeed a considerable shouting about what they called\nConservative principles; but the awkward question naturally arose, what\nwill you conserve? The prerogatives of the Crown, provided they are not\nexercised; the independence of the House of Lords, provided it is not\nasserted; the Ecclesiastical estate, provided it is regulated by a\ncommission of laymen. Everything, in short, that is established, as long\nas it is a phrase and not a fact.\n\nIn the meantime, while forms and phrases are religiously cherished in\norder to make the semblance of a creed, the rule of practice is to\nbend to the passion or combination of the hour. Conservatism assumes in\ntheory that everything established should be maintained; but adopts\nin practice that everything that is established is indefensible. To\nreconcile this theory and this practice, they produce what they call\n'the best bargain;' some arrangement which has no principle and no\npurpose, except to obtain a temporary lull of agitation, until the mind\nof the Conservatives, without a guide and without an aim, distracted,\ntempted, and bewildered, is prepared for another arrangement, equally\nstatesmanlike with the preceding one.\n\nConservatism was an attempt to carry on affairs by substituting the\nfulfilment of the duties of office for the performance of the functions\nof government; and to maintain this negative system by the mere\ninfluence of property, reputable private conduct, and what are called\ngood connections. Conservatism discards Prescription, shrinks from\nPrinciple, disavows Progress; having rejected all respect for Antiquity,\nit offers no redress for the Present, and makes no preparation for the\nFuture. It is obvious that for a time, under favourable circumstances,\nsuch a confederation might succeed; but it is equally clear, that on\nthe arrival of one of those critical conjunctures that will periodically\noccur in all states, and which such an unimpassioned system is even\ncalculated ultimately to create, all power of resistance will be\nwanting: the barren curse of political infidelity will paralyse all\naction; and the Conservative Constitution will be discovered to be a\nCaput Mortuum.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nIn the meantime, after dinner, Tadpole and Taper, who were among the\nguests of Mr. Ormsby, withdrew to a distant sofa, out of earshot, and\nindulged in confidential talk.\n\n'Such a strength in debate was never before found on a Treasury bench,'\nsaid Mr. Tadpole; 'the other side will be dumbfounded.'\n\n'And what do you put our numbers at now?' inquired Mr. Taper.\n\n'Would you take fifty-five for our majority?' rejoined Mr. Tadpole.\n\n'It is not so much the tail they have, as the excuse their junction will\nbe for the moderate, sensible men to come over,' said Taper. 'Our friend\nSir Everard for example, it would settle him.'\n\n'He is a solemn impostor,' rejoined Mr. Tadpole; 'but he is a baronet\nand a county member, and very much looked up to by the Wesleyans. The\nother men, I know, have refused him a peerage.'\n\n'And we might hold out judicious hopes,' said Taper.\n\n'No one can do that better than you,' said Tadpole. 'I am apt to say too\nmuch about those things.'\n\n'I make it a rule never to open my mouth on such subjects,' said Taper.\n'A nod or a wink will speak volumes. An affectionate pressure of the\nhand will sometimes do a great deal; and I have promised many a peerage\nwithout committing myself, by an ingenious habit of deference which\ncannot be mistaken by the future noble.'\n\n'I wonder what they will do with Rigby,' said Tadpole.\n\n'He wants a good deal,' said Taper.\n\n'I tell you what, Mr. Taper, the time is gone by when a Marquess of\nMonmouth was Letter A, No. 1.'\n\n'Very true, Mr. Tadpole. A wise man would do well now to look to\nthe great middle class, as I said the other day to the electors of\nShabbyton.'\n\n'I had sooner be supported by the Wesleyans,' said Mr. Tadpole, 'than by\nall the marquesses in the peerage.'\n\n'At the same time,' said Mr. Taper, 'Rigby is a considerable man. If we\nwant a slashing article--'\n\n'Pooh!' said Mr. Tadpole. 'He is quite gone by. He takes three months\nfor his slashing articles. Give me the man who can write a leader. Rigby\ncan't write a leader.'\n\n'Very few can,' said Mr. Taper. 'However, I don't think much of the\npress. Its power is gone by. They overdid it.'\n\n'There is Tom Chudleigh,' said Tadpole. 'What is he to have?'\n\n'Nothing, I hope,' said Taper. 'I hate him. A coxcomb! Cracking his\njokes and laughing at us.'\n\n'He has done a good deal for the party, though,' said Tadpole. 'That,\nto be sure, is only an additional reason for throwing him over, as he\nis too far committed to venture to oppose us. But I am afraid from\nsomething that dropped to-day, that Sir Robert thinks he has claims.'\n\n'We must stop them,' said Taper, growing pale. 'Fellows like Chudleigh,\nwhen they once get in, are always in one's way. I have no objection to\nyoung noblemen being put forward, for they are preferred so rapidly,\nand then their fathers die, that in the long run they do not practically\ninterfere with us.'\n\n'Well, his name was mentioned,' said Tadpole. 'There is no concealing\nthat.'\n\n'I will speak to Earwig,' said Taper. 'He shall just drop into\nSir Robert's ear by chance, that Chudleigh used to quiz him in the\nsmoking-room. Those little bits of information do a great deal of good.'\n\n'Well, I leave him to you,' said Tadpole. 'I am heartily with you\nin keeping out all fellows like Chudleigh. They are very well for\nopposition; but in office we don't want wits.'\n\n'And when shall we have the answer from Knowsley?' inquired Taper. 'You\nanticipate no possible difficulty?'\n\n'I tell you it is \"carte blanche,\"' replied Tadpole. 'Four places in\nthe cabinet. Two secretaryships at the least. Do you happen to know any\ngentleman of your acquaintance, Mr. Taper, who refuses Secretaryships\nof State so easily, that you can for an instant doubt of the present\narrangement?'\n\n'I know none indeed,' said Mr. Taper, with a grim smile.\n\n'The thing is done,' said Mr. Tadpole.\n\n'And now for our cry,' said Mr. Taper.\n\n'It is not a Cabinet for a good cry,' said Tadpole; 'but then, on the\nother hand, it is a Cabinet that will sow dissension in the opposite\nranks, and prevent them having a good cry.'\n\n'Ancient institutions and modern improvements, I suppose, Mr. Tadpole?'\n\n'Ameliorations is the better word, ameliorations. Nobody knows exactly\nwhat it means.'\n\n'We go strong on the Church?' said Mr. Taper.\n\n'And no repeal of the Malt Tax; you were right, Taper. It can't be\nlistened to for a moment.'\n\n'Something might be done with prerogative,' said Mr. Taper; 'the King's\nconstitutional choice.'\n\n'Not too much,' replied Mr. Tadpole. 'It is a raw time yet for\nprerogative.'\n\n'Ah! Tadpole,' said Mr. Taper, getting a little maudlin; 'I often think,\nif the time should ever come, when you and I should be joint Secretaries\nof the Treasury!'\n\n'We shall see, we shall see. All we have to do is to get into\nParliament, work well together, and keep other men down.'\n\n'We will do our best,' said Taper. 'A dissolution you hold inevitable?'\n\n'How are you and I to get into Parliament if there be not one? We must\nmake it inevitable. I tell you what, Taper, the lists must prove a\ndissolution inevitable. You understand me? If the present Parliament\ngoes on, where shall we be? We shall have new men cropping up every\nsession.'\n\n'True, terribly true,' said Mr. Taper. 'That we should ever live to see\na Tory government again! We have reason to be very thankful.'\n\n'Hush!' said Mr. Tadpole. 'The time has gone by for Tory governments;\nwhat the country requires is a sound Conservative government.'\n\n'A sound Conservative government,' said Taper, musingly. 'I understand:\nTory men and Whig measures.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nAmid the contentions of party, the fierce struggles of ambition, and the\nintricacies of political intrigue, let us not forget our Eton friends.\nDuring the period which elapsed from the failure of the Duke of\nWellington to form a government in 1832, to the failure of Sir Robert\nPeel to carry on a government in 1835, the boys had entered, and\nadvanced in youth. The ties of friendship which then united several of\nthem had only been confirmed by continued companionship. Coningsby\nand Henry Sydney, and Buckhurst and Vere, were still bound together by\nentire sympathy, and by the affection of which sympathy is the only\nsure spring. But their intimacies had been increased by another familiar\nfriend. There had risen up between Coningsby and Millbank mutual\nsentiments of deep, and even ardent, regard. Acquaintance had developed\nthe superior qualities of Millbank. His thoughtful and inquiring mind,\nhis inflexible integrity, his stern independence, and yet the engaging\nunion of extreme tenderness of heart with all this strength of\ncharacter, had won the goodwill, and often excited the admiration, of\nConingsby. Our hero, too, was gratified by the affectionate deference\nthat was often shown to him by one who condescended to no other\nindividual; he was proud of having saved the life of a member of their\ncommunity whom masters and boys alike considered; and he ended by loving\nthe being on whom he had conferred a great obligation.\n\nThe friends of Coningsby, the sweet-tempered and intelligent Henry\nSydney, the fiery and generous Buckhurst, and the calm and sagacious\nVere, had ever been favourably inclined to Millbank, and had they not\nbeen, the example of Coningsby would soon have influenced them. He had\nobtained over his intimates the ascendant power, which is the destiny\nof genius. Nor was this submission of such spirits to be held cheap.\nAlthough they were willing to take the colour of their minds from him,\nthey were in intellect and attainments, in personal accomplishments and\ngeneral character, the leaders of the school; an authority not to be\nwon from five hundred high-spirited boys without the possession of great\nvirtues and great talents.\n\nAs for the dominion of Coningsby himself, it was not limited to the\nimmediate circle of his friends. He had become the hero of Eton; the\nbeing of whose existence everybody was proud, and in whose career every\nboy took an interest. They talked of him, they quoted him, they imitated\nhim. Fame and power are the objects of all men. Even their partial\nfruition is gained by very few; and that too at the expense of social\npleasure, health, conscience, life. Yet what power of manhood in\npassionate intenseness, appealing at the same time to the subject and\nthe votary, can rival that which is exercised by the idolised chieftain\nof a great public school? What fame of after days equals the rapture of\ncelebrity that thrills the youthful poet, as in tones of rare emotion he\nrecites his triumphant verses amid the devoted plaudits of the flower\nof England? That's fame, that's power; real, unquestioned, undoubted,\ncatholic. Alas! the schoolboy, when he becomes a man, finds that power,\neven fame, like everything else, is an affair of party.\n\nConingsby liked very much to talk politics with Millbank. He heard\nthings from Millbank which were new to him. Himself, as he supposed, a\nhigh Tory, which he was according to the revelation of the Rigbys, he\nwas also sufficiently familiar with the hereditary tenets of his Whig\nfriend, Lord Vere. Politics had as yet appeared to him a struggle\nwhether the country was to be governed by Whig nobles or Tory nobles;\nand he thought it very unfortunate that he should probably have to enter\nlife with his friends out of power, and his family boroughs destroyed.\nBut in conversing with Millbank, he heard for the first time of\ninfluential classes in the country who were not noble, and were yet\ndetermined to acquire power. And although Millbank's views, which were\nof course merely caught up from his father, without the intervention of\nhis own intelligence, were doubtless crude enough, and were often very\nacutely canvassed and satisfactorily demolished by the clever prejudices\nof another school, which Coningsby had at command, still they were,\nunconsciously to the recipient, materials for thought, and insensibly\nprovoked in his mind a spirit of inquiry into political questions, for\nwhich he had a predisposition.\n\nIt may be said, indeed, that generally among the upper boys there might\nbe observed at this time, at Eton, a reigning inclination for political\ndiscussion. The school truly had at all times been proud of its\nstatesmen and its parliamentary heroes, but this was merely a\nsuperficial feeling in comparison with the sentiment which now first\nbecame prevalent. The great public questions that were the consequence\nof the Reform of the House of Commons, had also agitated their young\nhearts. And especially the controversies that were now rife respecting\nthe nature and character of ecclesiastical establishments, wonderfully\naddressed themselves to their excited intelligence. They read their\nnewspapers with a keen relish, canvassed debates, and criticised\nspeeches; and although in their debating society, which had been\ninstituted more than a quarter of a century, discussion on topics of\nthe day was prohibited, still by fixing on periods of our history when\naffairs were analogous to the present, many a youthful orator contrived\nvery effectively to reply to Lord John, or to refute the fallacies of\nhis rival.\n\nAs the political opinions predominant in the school were what in\nordinary parlance are styled Tory, and indeed were far better entitled\nto that glorious epithet than the flimsy shifts which their fathers were\nprofessing in Parliament and the country; the formation and the fall\nof Sir Robert Peel's government had been watched by Etonians with great\ninterest, and even excitement. The memorable efforts which the Minister\nhimself made, supported only by the silent votes of his numerous\nadherents, and contending alone against the multiplied assaults of his\nable and determined foes, with a spirit equal to the great occasion, and\nwith resources of parliamentary contest which seemed to increase\nwith every exigency; these great and unsupported struggles alone were\ncalculated to gain the sympathy of youthful and generous spirits. The\nassault on the revenues of the Church; the subsequent crusade against\nthe House of Lords; the display of intellect and courage exhibited\nby Lord Lyndhurst in that assembly, when all seemed cowed and\nfaint-hearted; all these were incidents or personal traits apt to stir\nthe passions, and create in breasts not yet schooled to repress emotion,\na sentiment even of enthusiasm. It is the personal that interests\nmankind, that fires their imagination, and wins their hearts. A cause is\na great abstraction, and fit only for students; embodied in a party, it\nstirs men to action; but place at the head of that party a leader who\ncan inspire enthusiasm, lie commands the world. Divine faculty! Rare and\nincomparable privilege! A parliamentary leader who possesses it, doubles\nhis majority; and he who has it not, may shroud himself in artificial\nreserve, and study with undignified arrogance an awkward haughtiness,\nbut he will nevertheless be as far from controlling the spirit as from\ncaptivating the hearts of his sullen followers.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding this general feeling at Eton, in 1835, in\nfavour of 'Conservative principles,' which was, in fact, nothing more\nthan a confused and mingled sympathy with some great political truths,\nwhich were at the bottom of every boy's heart, but nowhere else; and\nwith the personal achievements and distinction of the chieftains of\nthe party; when all this hubbub had subsided, and retrospection, in the\ncourse of a year, had exercised its moralising influence over the\nmore thoughtful part of the nation, inquiries, at first faint and\nunpretending, and confined indeed for a long period to limited, though\ninquisitive, circles, began gently to circulate, what Conservative\nprinciples were.\n\nThese inquiries, urged indeed with a sort of hesitating scepticism,\nearly reached Eton. They came, no doubt, from the Universities. They\nwere of a character, however, far too subtile and refined to exercise\nany immediate influence over the minds of youth. To pursue them required\nprevious knowledge and habitual thought. They were not yet publicly\nprosecuted by any school of politicians, or any section of the public\npress. They had not a local habitation or a name. They were whispered in\nconversation by a few. A tutor would speak of them in an esoteric vein\nto a favourite pupil, in whose abilities he had confidence, and whose\nfuture position in life would afford him the opportunity of influencing\nopinion. Among others, they fell upon the ear of Coningsby. They were\naddressed to a mind which was prepared for such researches.\n\nThere is a Library at Eton formed by the boys and governed by the boys;\none of those free institutions which are the just pride of that noble\nschool, which shows the capacity of the boys for self-government, and\nwhich has sprung from the large freedom that has been wisely conceded\nthem, the prudence of which confidence has been proved by their rarely\nabusing it. This Library has been formed by subscriptions of the present\nand still more by the gifts of old Etonians. Among the honoured names of\nthese donors may be remarked those of the Grenvilles and Lord Wellesley;\nnor should we forget George IV., who enriched the collection with a\nmagnificent copy of the Delphin Classics. The Institution is governed\nby six directors, the three first Collegers and the three first Oppidans\nfor the time being; and the subscribers are limited to the one hundred\nsenior members of the school.\n\nIt is only to be regretted that the collection is not so extensive at\nit is interesting and choice. Perhaps its existence is not so generally\nknown as it deserves to be. One would think that every Eton man would\nbe as proud of his name being registered as a donor in the Catalogue of\nthis Library, as a Venetian of his name being inscribed in the Golden\nBook. Indeed an old Etonian, who still remembers with tenderness the\nsacred scene of youth, could scarcely do better than build a Gothic\napartment for the reception of the collection. It cannot be doubted that\nthe Provost and fellows would be gratified in granting a piece of ground\nfor the purpose.\n\nGreat were the obligations of Coningsby to this Eton Library. It\nintroduced him to that historic lore, that accumulation of facts and\nincidents illustrative of political conduct, for which he had imbibed an\nearly relish. His study was especially directed to the annals of his\nown country, in which youth, and not youth alone, is frequently so\ndeficient. This collection could afford him Clarendon and Burnet, and\nthe authentic volumes of Coxe: these were rich materials for one anxious\nto be versed in the great parliamentary story of his country. During\nthe last year of his stay at Eton, when he had completed his eighteenth\nyear, Coningsby led a more retired life than previously; he read much,\nand pondered with all the pride of acquisition over his increasing\nknowledge.\n\nAnd now the hour has come when this youth is to be launched into a world\nmore vast than that in which he has hitherto sojourned, yet for which\nthis microcosm has been no ill preparation. He will become more wise;\nwill he remain as generous? His ambition may be as great; will it be as\nnoble? What, indeed, is to be the future of this existence that is now\nto be sent forth into the great aggregate of entities? Is it an ordinary\norganisation that will jostle among the crowd, and be jostled? Is it a\nfiner temperament, susceptible of receiving the impressions and imbibing\nthe inspirations of superior yet sympathising spirits? Or is it a\nprimordial and creative mind; one that will say to his fellows, 'Behold,\nGod has given me thought; I have discovered truth, and you shall\nbelieve?'\n\nThe night before Coningsby left Eton, alone in his room, before he\nretired to rest, he opened the lattice and looked for the last time upon\nthe landscape before him; the stately keep of Windsor, the bowery meads\nof Eton, soft in the summer moon and still in the summer night. He gazed\nupon them; his countenance had none of the exultation, that under such\ncircumstances might have distinguished a more careless glance, eager\nfor fancied emancipation and passionate for a novel existence. Its\nexpression was serious, even sad; and he covered his brow with his hand.\n\nEND OF BOOK II.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThere are few things more full of delight and splendour, than to travel\nduring the heat of a refulgent summer in the green district of some\nancient forest.\n\nIn one of our midland counties there is a region of this character,\nto which, during a season of peculiar lustre, we would introduce the\nreader.\n\nIt was a fragment of one of those vast sylvan tracts wherein Norman\nkings once hunted, and Saxon outlaws plundered; and although the plough\nhad for centuries successfully invaded brake and bower, the relics\nretained all their original character of wildness and seclusion.\nSometimes the green earth was thickly studded with groves of huge and\nvigorous oaks, intersected with those smooth and sunny glades, that seem\nas if they must be cut for dames and knights to saunter on. Then again\nthe undulating ground spread on all sides, far as the eye could range,\ncovered with copse and fern of immense growth. Anon you found yourself\nin a turfy wilderness, girt in apparently by dark woods. And when you\nhad wound your way a little through this gloomy belt, the landscape\nstill strictly sylvan, would beautifully expand with every combination\nand variety of woodland; while in its centre, the wildfowl covered the\nwaters of a lake, and the deer basked on the knolls that abounded on its\nbanks.\n\nIt was in the month of August, some six or seven years ago, that a\ntraveller on foot, touched, as he emerged from the dark wood, by the\nbeauty of this scene, threw himself under the shade of a spreading tree,\nand stretched his limbs on the turf for enjoyment rather than repose.\nThe sky was deep-coloured and without a cloud, save here and there\na minute, sultry, burnished vapour, almost as glossy as the heavens.\nEverything was still as it was bright; all seemed brooding and basking;\nthe bee upon its wing was the only stirring sight, and its song the only\nsound.\n\nThe traveller fell into a reverie. He was young, and therefore his\nmusings were of the future. He had felt the pride of learning, so\nennobling to youth; he was not a stranger to the stirring impulses of a\nhigh ambition, though the world to him was as yet only a world of books,\nand all that he knew of the schemes of statesmen and the passions of\nthe people, were to be found in their annals. Often had his fitful fancy\ndwelt with fascination on visions of personal distinction, of future\ncelebrity, perhaps even of enduring fame. But his dreams were of another\ncolour now. The surrounding scene, so fair, so still, and sweet; so\nabstracted from all the tumult of the world, its strife, its passions,\nand its cares: had fallen on his heart with its soft and subduing\nspirit; had fallen on a heart still pure and innocent, the heart of\none who, notwithstanding all his high resolves and daring thoughts, was\nblessed with that tenderness of soul which is sometimes linked with an\nardent imagination and a strong will. The traveller was an orphan, more\nthan that, a solitary orphan. The sweet sedulousness of a mother's\nlove, a sister's mystical affection, had not cultivated his early\nsusceptibility. No soft pathos of expression had appealed to his\nchildish ear. He was alone, among strangers calmly and coldly kind.\nIt must indeed have been a truly gentle disposition that could have\nwithstood such hard neglect. All that he knew of the power of the softer\npassions might be found in the fanciful and romantic annals of schoolboy\nfriendship.\n\nAnd those friends too, so fond, so sympathising, so devoted, where were\nthey now? Already they were dispersed; the first great separation of\nlife had been experienced; the former schoolboy had planted his foot on\nthe threshold of manhood. True, many of them might meet again; many of\nthem the University must again unite, but never with the same feelings.\nThe space of time, passed in the world before they again met, would be\nan age of sensation, passion, experience to all of them. They would meet\nagain with altered mien, with different manners, different voices. Their\neyes would not shine with the same light; they would not speak the same\nwords. The favourite phrases of their intimacy, the mystic sounds that\nspoke only to their initiated ear, they would be ashamed to use them.\nYes, they might meet again, but the gushing and secret tenderness was\ngone for ever.\n\nNor could our pensive youth conceal it from himself that it was\naffection, and mainly affection, that had bound him to these dear\ncompanions. They could not be to him what he had been to them. His had\nbeen the inspiring mind that had guided their opinions, formed their\ntastes, directed the bent and tenor of their lives and thoughts.\nOften, indeed, had he needed, sometimes he had even sighed for,\nthe companionship of an equal or superior mind; one who, by the\ncomprehension of his thought, and the richness of his knowledge, and the\nadvantage of his experience, might strengthen and illuminate and guide\nhis obscure or hesitating or unpractised intelligence. He had scarcely\nbeen fortunate in this respect, and he deeply regretted it; for he was\none of those who was not content with excelling in his own circle, if\nhe thought there was one superior to it. Absolute, not relative\ndistinction, was his noble aim.\n\nAlone, in a lonely scene, he doubly felt the solitude of his life and\nmind. His heart and his intellect seemed both to need a companion.\nBooks, and action, and deep thought, might in time supply the want of\nthat intellectual guide; but for the heart, where was he to find solace?\n\nAh! if she would but come forth from that shining lake like a beautiful\nOndine! Ah, if she would but step out from the green shade of that\nsecret grove like a Dryad of sylvan Greece! O mystery of mysteries, when\nyouth dreams his first dream over some imaginary heroine!\n\nSuddenly the brooding wildfowl rose from the bosom of the lake, soared\nin the air, and, uttering mournful shrieks, whirled in agitated tumult.\nThe deer started from their knolls, no longer sunny, stared around, and\nrushed into the woods. Coningsby raised his eyes from the turf on which\nthey had been long fixed in abstraction, and he observed that the azure\nsky had vanished, a thin white film had suddenly spread itself over the\nheavens, and the wind moaned with a sad and fitful gust.\n\nHe had some reason to believe that on the other side of the opposite\nwood the forest was intersected by a public road, and that there were\nsome habitations. Immediately rising, he descended at a rapid pace into\nthe valley, passed the lake, and then struck into the ascending wood on\nthe bank opposite to that on which he had mused away some precious time.\n\nThe wind howled, the branches of the forest stirred, and sent forth\nsounds like an incantation. Soon might be distinguished the various\nvoices of the mighty trees, as they expressed their terror or their\nagony. The oak roared, the beech shrieked, the elm sent forth its deep\nand long-drawn groan; while ever and anon, amid a momentary pause, the\npassion of the ash was heard in moans of thrilling anguish.\n\nConingsby hurried on, the forest became less close. All that he aspired\nto was to gain more open country. Now he was in a rough flat land,\ncovered only here and there with dwarf underwood; the horizon bounded at\nno great distance by a barren hill of moderate elevation. He gained its\nheight with ease. He looked over a vast open country like a wild common;\nin the extreme distance hills covered with woods; the plain intersected\nby two good roads: the sky entirely clouded, but in the distance black\nas ebony.\n\nA place of refuge was at hand: screened from his first glance by some\nelm-trees, the ascending smoke now betrayed a roof, which Coningsby\nreached before the tempest broke. The forest-inn was also a farmhouse.\nThere was a comfortable-enough looking kitchen; but the ingle nook was\nfull of smokers, and Coningsby was glad to avail himself of the only\nprivate room for the simple meal which they offered him, only eggs and\nbacon; but very welcome to a pedestrian, and a hungry one.\n\nAs he stood at the window of his little apartment, watching the large\ndrops that were the heralds of a coming hurricane, and waiting for his\nrepast, a flash of lightning illumined the whole country, and a horseman\nat full speed, followed by his groom, galloped up to the door.\n\nThe remarkable beauty of the animal so attracted Coningsby's attention\nthat it prevented him catching even a glimpse of the rider, who rapidly\ndismounted and entered the inn. The host shortly after came in and asked\nConingsby whether he had any objection to a gentleman, who was driven\nthere by the storm, sharing his room until it subsided. The consequence\nof the immediate assent of Coningsby was, that the landlord retired and\nsoon returned, ushering in an individual, who, though perhaps ten years\nolder than Coningsby, was still, according to Hippocrates, in the period\nof lusty youth. He was above the middle height, and of a distinguished\nair and figure; pale, with an impressive brow, and dark eyes of great\nintelligence.\n\n'I am glad that we have both escaped the storm,' said the stranger;\n'and I am greatly indebted to you for your courtesy.' He slightly and\ngraciously bowed, as he spoke in a voice of remarkable clearness; and\nhis manner, though easy, was touched with a degree of dignity that was\nengaging.\n\n'The inn is a common home,' replied Coningsby, returning his salute.\n\n'And free from cares,' added the stranger. Then, looking through\nthe window, he said, 'A strange storm this. I was sauntering in the\nsunshine, when suddenly I found I had to gallop for my life. 'Tis more\nlike a white squall in the Mediterranean than anything else.'\n\n'I never was in the Mediterranean,' said Coningsby. 'There is nothing I\nshould like so much as to travel.'\n\n'You are travelling,' rejoined his companion. 'Every moment is travel,\nif understood.'\n\n'Ah! but the Mediterranean!' exclaimed Coningsby. 'What would I not give\nto see Athens!'\n\n'I have seen it,' said the stranger, slightly shrugging his shoulders;'\nand more wonderful things. Phantoms and spectres! The Age of Ruins is\npast. Have you seen Manchester?'\n\n'I have seen nothing,' said Coningsby; 'this is my first wandering. I am\nabout to visit a friend who lives in this county, and I have sent on\nmy baggage as I could. For myself, I determined to trust to a less\ncommon-place conveyance.'\n\n'And seek adventures,' said the stranger, smiling, 'Well, according to\nCervantes, they should begin in an inn.'\n\n'I fear that the age of adventures is past, as well as that of ruins,'\nreplied Coningsby.\n\n'Adventures are to the adventurous,' said the stranger.\n\nAt this moment a pretty serving-maid entered the room. She laid the\ndapper cloth and arranged the table with a self-possession quite\nadmirable. She seemed unconscious that any being was in the chamber\nexcept herself, or that there were any other duties to perform in life\nbeyond filling a saltcellar or folding a napkin.\n\n'She does not even look at us,' said Coningsby, when she had quitted the\nroom; 'and I dare say is only a prude.'\n\n'She is calm,' said the stranger, 'because she is mistress of her\nsubject; 'tis the secret of self-possession. She is here as a duchess at\ncourt.'\n\nThey brought in Coningsby's meal, and he invited the stranger to join\nhim. The invitation was accepted with cheerfulness.\n\n''Tis but simple fare,' said Coningsby, as the maiden uncovered the\nstill hissing bacon and the eggs, that looked like tufts of primroses.\n\n'Nay, a national dish,' said the stranger, glancing quickly at the\ntable, 'whose fame is a proverb. And what more should we expect under\na simple roof! How much better than an omelette or a greasy olla, that\nthey would give us in a posada! 'Tis a wonderful country this England!\nWhat a napkin! How spotless! And so sweet; I declare 'tis a perfume.\nThere is not a princess throughout the South of Europe served with the\ncleanliness that meets us in this cottage.'\n\n'An inheritance from our Saxon fathers?' said Coningsby. 'I apprehend\nthe northern nations have a greater sense of cleanliness, of propriety,\nof what we call comfort?'\n\n'By no means,' said the stranger; 'the East is the land of the Bath.\nMoses and Mahomet made cleanliness religion.'\n\n'You will let me help you?' said Coningsby, offering him a plate which\nhe had filled.\n\n'I thank you,' said the stranger, 'but it is one of my bread days. With\nyour permission this shall be my dish;' and he cut from the large loaf a\nsupply of crusts.\n\n''Tis but unsavoury fare after a gallop,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Ah! you are proud of your bacon and your eggs,' said the stranger,\nsmiling, 'but I love corn and wine. They are our chief and our oldest\nluxuries. Time has brought us substitutes, but how inferior! Man has\ndeified corn and wine! but not even the Chinese or the Irish have raised\ntemples to tea and potatoes.'\n\n'But Ceres without Bacchus,' said Coningsby, 'how does that do? Think\nyou, under this roof, we could Invoke the god?'\n\n'Let us swear by his body that we will try,' said the stranger.\n\nAlas! the landlord was not a priest to Bacchus. But then these inquiries\nled to the finest perry in the world. The young men agreed they had\nseldom tasted anything more delicious; they sent for another bottle.\nConingsby, who was much interested by his new companion, enjoyed himself\namazingly.\n\nA cheese, such as Derby alone can produce, could not induce the stranger\nto be even partially inconstant to his crusts. But his talk was as\nvivacious as if the talker had been stimulated by the juices of the\nfinest banquet. Coningsby had never met or read of any one like this\nchance companion. His sentences were so short, his language so racy, his\nvoice rang so clear, his elocution was so complete. On all subjects his\nmind seemed to be instructed, and his opinions formed. He flung out a\nresult in a few words; he solved with a phrase some deep problem that\nmen muse over for years. He said many things that were strange, yet\nthey immediately appeared to be true. Then, without the slightest air of\npretension or parade, he seemed to know everybody as well as everything.\nMonarchs, statesmen, authors, adventurers, of all descriptions and of\nall climes, if their names occurred in the conversation, he described\nthem in an epigrammatic sentence, or revealed their precise position,\ncharacter, calibre, by a curt dramatic trait. All this, too, without any\nexcitement of manner; on the contrary, with repose amounting almost\nto nonchalance. If his address had any fault in it, it was rather a\ndeficiency of earnestness. A slight spirit of mockery played over his\nspeech even when you deemed him most serious; you were startled by his\nsudden transitions from profound thought to poignant sarcasm. A very\nsingular freedom from passion and prejudice on every topic on which\nthey treated, might be some compensation for this want of earnestness,\nperhaps was its consequence. Certainly it was difficult to ascertain his\nprecise opinions on many subjects, though his manner was frank even to\nabandonment. And yet throughout his whole conversation, not a stroke of\negotism, not a word, not a circumstance escaped him, by which you could\njudge of his position or purposes in life. As little did he seem to care\nto discover those of his companion. He did not by any means monopolise\nthe conversation. Far from it; he continually asked questions, and\nwhile he received answers, or had engaged his fellow-traveller in any\nexposition of his opinion or feelings, he listened with a serious and\nfixed attention, looking Coningsby in the face with a steadfast glance.\n\n'I perceive,' said Coningsby, pursuing a strain of thought which the\nother had indicated, 'that you have great confidence in the influence\nof individual character. I also have some confused persuasions of that\nkind. But it is not the Spirit of the Age.'\n\n'The age does not believe in great men, because it does not possess\nany,' replied the stranger. 'The Spirit of the Age is the very thing\nthat a great man changes.'\n\n'But does he not rather avail himself of it?' inquired Coningsby.\n\n'Parvenus do,' rejoined his companion; 'but not prophets, great\nlegislators, great conquerors. They destroy and they create.'\n\n'But are these times for great legislators and great conquerors?' urged\nConingsby.\n\n'When were they wanted more?' asked the stranger. 'From the throne to\nthe hovel all call for a guide. You give monarchs constitutions to\nteach them sovereignty, and nations Sunday-schools to inspire them with\nfaith.'\n\n'But what is an individual,' exclaimed Coningsby, 'against a vast public\nopinion?'\n\n'Divine,' said the stranger. 'God made man in His own image; but the\nPublic is made by Newspapers, Members of Parliament, Excise Officers,\nPoor Law Guardians. Would Philip have succeeded if Epaminondas had not\nbeen slain? And if Philip had not succeeded? Would Prussia have existed\nhad Frederick not been born? And if Frederick had not been born? What\nwould have been the fate of the Stuarts if Prince Henry had not died,\nand Charles I., as was intended, had been Archbishop of Canterbury?'\n\n'But when men are young they want experience,' said Coningsby; 'and when\nthey have gained experience, they want energy.'\n\n'Great men never want experience,' said the stranger.\n\n'But everybody says that experience--'\n\n'Is the best thing in the world, a treasure for you, for me, for\nmillions. But for a creative mind, less than nothing. Almost everything\nthat is great has been done by youth.'\n\n'It is at least a creed flattering to our years,' said Coningsby, with a\nsmile.\n\n'Nay,' said the stranger; 'for life in general there is but one decree.\nYouth is a blunder; Manhood a struggle; Old Age a regret. Do not\nsuppose,' he added, smiling, 'that I hold that youth is genius; all that\nI say is, that genius, when young, is divine. Why, the greatest captains\nof ancient and modern times both conquered Italy at five-and-twenty!\nYouth, extreme youth, overthrew the Persian Empire. Don John of Austria\nwon Lepanto at twenty-five, the greatest battle of modern time; had it\nnot been for the jealousy of Philip, the next year he would have been\nEmperor of Mauritania. Gaston de Foix was only twenty-two when he stood\na victor on the plain of Ravenna. Every one remembers Cond\u00c3\u00a9 and Rocroy\nat the same age. Gustavus Adolphus died at thirty-eight. Look at his\ncaptains: that wonderful Duke of Weimar, only thirty-six when he died.\nBanier himself, after all his miracles, died at forty-five. Cortes was\nlittle more than thirty when he gazed upon the golden cupolas of Mexico.\nWhen Maurice of Saxony died at thirty-two, all Europe acknowledged the\nloss of the greatest captain and the profoundest statesman of the age.\nThen there is Nelson, Clive; but these are warriors, and perhaps you may\nthink there are greater things than war. I do not: I worship the Lord\nof Hosts. But take the most illustrious achievements of civil prudence.\nInnocent III., the greatest of the Popes, was the despot of Christendom\nat thirty-seven. John de Medici was a Cardinal at fifteen, and according\nto Guicciardini, baffled with his statecraft Ferdinand of Arragon\nhimself. He was Pope as Leo X. at thirty-seven. Luther robbed even him\nof his richest province at thirty-five. Take Ignatius Loyola and John\nWesley, they worked with young brains. Ignatius was only thirty when he\nmade his pilgrimage and wrote the \"Spiritual Exercises.\" Pascal wrote\na great work at sixteen, and died at thirty-seven, the greatest of\nFrenchmen.\n\n'Ah! that fatal thirty-seven, which reminds me of Byron, greater even as\na man than a writer. Was it experience that guided the pencil of Raphael\nwhen he painted the palaces of Rome? He, too, died at thirty-seven.\nRichelieu was Secretary of State at thirty-one. Well then, there were\nBolingbroke and Pitt, both ministers before other men left off cricket.\nGrotius was in great practice at seventeen, and Attorney-General at\ntwenty-four. And Acquaviva; Acquaviva was General of the Jesuits,\nruled every cabinet in Europe, and colonised America before he was\nthirty-seven. What a career!' exclaimed the stranger; rising from his\nchair and walking up and down the room; 'the secret sway of Europe! That\nwas indeed a position! But it is needless to multiply instances! The\nhistory of Heroes is the history of Youth.'\n\n'Ah!' said Coningsby, 'I should like to be a great man.'\n\nThe stranger threw at him a scrutinising glance. His countenance was\nserious. He said in a voice of almost solemn melody:\n\n'Nurture your mind with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes\nheroes.'\n\n'You seem to me a hero,' said Coningsby, in a tone of real feeling,\nwhich, half ashamed of his emotion, he tried to turn into playfulness.\n\n'I am and must ever be,' said the stranger, 'but a dreamer of dreams.'\nThen going towards the window, and changing into a familiar tone as if\nto divert the conversation, he added, 'What a delicious afternoon! I\nlook forward to my ride with delight. You rest here?'\n\n'No; I go on to Nottingham, where I shall sleep.'\n\n'And I in the opposite direction.' And he rang the bell, and ordered his\nhorse.\n\n'I long to see your mare again,' said Coningsby. 'She seemed to me so\nbeautiful.'\n\n'She is not only of pure race,' said the stranger, 'but of the highest\nand rarest breed in Arabia. Her name is \"the Daughter of the Star.\"\nShe is a foal of that famous mare, which belonged to the Prince of the\nWahabees; and to possess which, I believe, was one of the principal\ncauses of war between that tribe and the Egyptians. The Pacha of Egypt\ngave her to me, and I would not change her for her statue in pure gold,\neven carved by Lysippus. Come round to the stable and see her.'\n\nThey went out together. It was a soft sunny afternoon; the air fresh\nfrom the rain, but mild and exhilarating.\n\nThe groom brought forth the mare. 'The Daughter of the Star' stood\nbefore Coningsby with her sinewy shape of matchless symmetry; her\nburnished skin, black mane, legs like those of an antelope, her little\nears, dark speaking eye, and tail worthy of a Pacha. And who was her\nmaster, and whither was she about to take him?\n\nConingsby was so naturally well-bred, that we may be sure it was not\ncuriosity; no, it was a finer feeling that made him hesitate and think a\nlittle, and then say:\n\n'I am sorry to part.'\n\n'I also,' said the stranger. 'But life is constant separation.'\n\n'I hope we may meet again,' said Coningsby.\n\n'If our acquaintance be worth preserving,' said the stranger, 'you may\nbe sure it will not be lost.'\n\n'But mine is not worth preserving,' said Coningsby, earnestly. 'It is\nyours that is the treasure. You teach me things of which I have long\nmused.'\n\nThe stranger took the bridle of 'the Daughter of the Star,' and turning\nround with a faint smile, extended his hand to his companion.\n\n'Your mind at least is nurtured with great thoughts,' said Coningsby;\n'your actions should be heroic.'\n\n'Action is not for me,' said the stranger; 'I am of that faith that the\nApostles professed before they followed their master.'\n\nHe vaulted into his saddle, 'the Daughter of the Star' bounded away as\nif she scented the air of the Desert from which she and her rider had\nalike sprung, and Coningsby remained in profound meditation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThe day after his adventure at the Forest Inn, Coningsby arrived at\nBeaumanoir. It was several years since he had visited the family of his\nfriend, who were indeed also his kin; and in his boyish days had often\nproved that they were not unmindful of the affinity. This was a visit\nthat had been long counted on, long promised, and which a variety of\ncircumstances had hitherto prevented. It was to have been made by the\nschoolboy; it was to be fulfilled by the man. For no less a character\ncould Coningsby under any circumstances now consent to claim, since he\nwas closely verging to the completion of his nineteenth year; and it\nappeared manifest that if it were his destiny to do anything great,\nhe had but few years to wait before the full development of his power.\nVisions of Gastons de Foix and Maurices of Saxony, statesmen giving\nup cricket to govern nations, beardless Jesuits plunged in profound\nabstraction in omnipotent cabinets, haunted his fancy from the moment he\nhad separated from his mysterious and deeply interesting companion. To\nnurture his mind with great thoughts had ever been Coningsby's inspiring\nhabit. Was it also destined that he should achieve the heroic?\n\nThere are some books, when we close them; one or two in the course of\nour life, difficult as it may be to analyse or ascertain the cause; our\nminds seem to have made a great leap. A thousand obscure things receive\nlight; a multitude of indefinite feelings are determined. Our intellect\ngrasps and grapples with all subjects with a capacity, a flexibility,\nand a vigour, before unknown to us. It masters questions hitherto\nperplexing, which are not even touched or referred to in the volume just\nclosed. What is this magic? It is the spirit of the supreme author, by\na magentic influence blending with our sympathising intelligence, that\ndirects and inspires it. By that mysterious sensibility we extend to\nquestions which he has not treated, the same intellectual force which he\nhas exercised over those which he has expounded. His genius for a time\nremains in us. 'Tis the same with human beings as with books. All of us\nencounter, at least once in our life, some individual who utters words\nthat make us think for ever.\n\nThere are men whose phrases are oracles; who condense in a sentence the\nsecrets of life; who blurt out an aphorism that forms a character or\nillustrates an existence. A great thing is a great book; but greater\nthan all is the talk of a great man.\n\nAnd what is a great man? Is it a Minister of State? Is it a victorious\nGeneral? A gentleman in the Windsor uniform? A Field Marshal covered\nwith stars? Is it a Prelate, or a Prince? A King, even an Emperor?\nIt may be all these; yet these, as we must all daily feel, are not\nnecessarily great men. A great man is one who affects the mind of his\ngeneration: whether he be a monk in his cloister agitating Christendom,\nor a monarch crossing the Granicus, and giving a new character to the\nPagan World.\n\nOur young Coningsby reached Beaumanoir in a state of meditation. He also\ndesired to be great. Not from the restless vanity that sometimes\nimpels youth to momentary exertion, by which they sometimes obtain a\ndistinction as evanescent as their energy. The ambition of our hero was\naltogether of a different character. It was, indeed, at present not a\nlittle vague, indefinite, hesitating, inquiring, sometimes desponding.\nWhat were his powers? what should be his aim? were often to him, as to\nall young aspirants, questions infinitely perplexing and full of pain.\nBut, on the whole, there ran through his character, notwithstanding his\nmany dazzling qualities and accomplishments, and his juvenile celebrity,\nwhich has spoiled so much promise, a vein of grave simplicity that was\nthe consequence of an earnest temper, and of an intellect that would be\ncontent with nothing short of the profound.\n\nHis was a mind that loved to pursue every question to the centre. But\nit was not a spirit of scepticism that impelled this habit; on the\ncontrary, it was the spirit of faith. Coningsby found that he was born\nin an age of infidelity in all things, and his heart assured him that a\nwant of faith was a want of nature. But his vigorous intellect could not\ntake refuge in that maudlin substitute for belief which consists in\na patronage of fantastic theories. He needed that deep and enduring\nconviction that the heart and the intellect, feeling and reason united,\ncan alone supply. He asked himself why governments were hated,\nand religions despised? Why loyalty was dead, and reverence only a\ngalvanised corpse?\n\nThese were indeed questions that had as yet presented themselves to his\nthought in a crude and imperfect form; but their very occurrence showed\nthe strong predisposition of his mind. It was because he had not found\nguides among his elders, that his thoughts had been turned to the\ngeneration that he himself represented. The sentiment of veneration was\nso developed in his nature, that he was exactly the youth that would\nhave hung with enthusiastic humility on the accents of some sage of old\nin the groves of Academus, or the porch of Zeno. But as yet he had found\nage only perplexed and desponding; manhood only callous and desperate.\nSome thought that systems would last their time; others, that something\nwould turn up. His deep and pious spirit recoiled with disgust and\nhorror from such lax, chance-medley maxims, that would, in their\nconsequences, reduce man to the level of the brutes. Notwithstanding\na prejudice which had haunted him from his childhood, he had, when\nthe occasion offered, applied to Mr. Rigby for instruction, as one\ndistinguished in the republic of letters, as well as the realm of\npolitics; who assumed the guidance of the public mind, and, as the\nphrase runs, was looked up to. Mr. Rigby listened at first to the\ninquiries of Coningsby, urged, as they ever were, with a modesty and\ndeference which do not always characterise juvenile investigations, as\nif Coningsby were speaking to him of the unknown tongues. But Mr.\nRigby was not a man who ever confessed himself at fault. He caught\nup something of the subject as our young friend proceeded, and was\nperfectly prepared, long before he had finished, to take the whole\nconversation into his own hands.\n\nMr. Rigby began by ascribing everything to the Reform Bill, and then\nreferred to several of his own speeches on Schedule A. Then he told\nConingsby that want of religious Faith was solely occasioned by want of\nchurches; and want of Loyalty, by George IV. having shut himself up too\nmuch at the cottage in Windsor Park, entirely against the advice of Mr.\nRigby. He assured Coningsby that the Church Commission was operating\nwonders, and that with private benevolence, he had himself subscribed\n1,000_l._, for Lord Monmouth, we should soon have churches enough. The\ngreat question now was their architecture. Had George IV. lived all\nwould have been right. They would have been built on the model of the\nBudhist pagoda. As for Loyalty, if the present King went regularly to\nAscot races, he had no doubt all would go right. Finally, Mr. Rigby\nimpressed on Coningsby to read the Quarterly Review with great\nattention; and to make himself master of Mr. Wordy's History of the late\nWar, in twenty volumes, a capital work, which proves that Providence was\non the side of the Tories.\n\nConingsby did not reply to Mr. Rigby again; but worked on with his own\nmind, coming often enough to sufficiently crude conclusions, and often\nmuch perplexed and harassed. He tried occasionally his inferences on his\ncompanions, who were intelligent and full of fervour. Millbank was more\nthan this. He was of a thoughtful mood; had also caught up from a new\nschool some principles, which were materials for discussion. One way or\nother, however, before he quitted Eton there prevailed among this circle\nof friends, the initial idea doubtless emanating from Coningsby, an\nearnest, though a rather vague, conviction that the present state of\nfeeling in matters both civil and religious was not healthy; that there\nmust be substituted for this latitudinarianism something sound and deep,\nfervent and well defined, and that the priests of this new faith must be\nfound among the New Generation; so that when the bright-minded rider\nof 'the Daughter of the Star' descanted on the influence of individual\ncharacter, of great thoughts and heroic actions, and the divine power of\nyouth and genius, he touched a string that was the very heart-chord of\nhis companion, who listened with fascinated enthusiasm as he introduced\nhim to his gallery of inspiring models.\n\nConingsby arrived at Beaumanoir at a season when men can neither hunt\nnor shoot. Great internal resources should be found in a country family\nunder such circumstances. The Duke and Duchess had returned from London\nonly a few days with their daughter, who had been presented this year.\nThey were all glad to find themselves again in the country, which they\nloved and which loved them. One of their sons-in-law and his wife, and\nHenry Sydney, completed the party.\n\nThere are few conjunctures in life of a more startling interest, than to\nmeet the pretty little girl that we have gambolled with in our boyhood,\nand to find her changed in the lapse of a very few years, which in some\ninstances may not have brought a corresponding alteration in our own\nappearance, into a beautiful woman. Something of this flitted over\nConingsby's mind, as he bowed, a little agitated from his surprise, to\nLady Theresa Sydney. All that he remembered had prepared him for beauty;\nbut not for the degree or character of beauty that he met. It was a\nrich, sweet face, with blue eyes and dark lashes, and a nose that we\nhave no epithet in English to describe, but which charmed in Roxalana.\nHer brown hair fell over her white and well turned shoulders in long and\nluxuriant tresses. One has met something as brilliant and dainty in a\nmedallion of old S\u00c3\u00a8vres, or amid the terraces and gardens of Watteau.\n\nPerhaps Lady Theresa, too, might have welcomed him with more freedom\nhad his appearance also more accorded with the image which he had left\nbehind. Coningsby was a boy then, as we described him in our first\nchapter. Though only nineteen now, he had attained his full stature,\nwhich was above the middle height, and time had fulfilled that promise\nof symmetry in his figure, and grace in his mien, then so largely\nintimated. Time, too, which had not yet robbed his countenance of any\nof its physical beauty, had strongly developed the intellectual charm\nby which it had ever been distinguished. As he bowed lowly before the\nDuchess and her daughter, it would have been difficult to imagine a\nyouth of a mien more prepossessing and a manner more finished.\n\nA manner that was spontaneous; nature's pure gift, the reflex of his\nfeeling. No artifice prompted that profound and polished homage. Not one\nof those influences, the aggregate of whose sway produces, as they tell\nus, the finished gentleman, had ever exercised its beneficent power on\nour orphan, and not rarely forlorn, Coningsby. No clever and refined\nwoman, with her quick perception, and nice criticism that never offends\nour self-love, had ever given him that education that is more precious\nthan Universities. The mild suggestions of a sister, the gentle raillery\nof some laughing cousin, are also advantages not always appreciated at\nthe time, but which boys, when they have become men, often think over\nwith gratitude, and a little remorse at the ungracious spirit in\nwhich they were received. Not even the dancing-master had afforded his\nmechanical aid to Coningsby, who, like all Eton boys of his generation,\nviewed that professor of accomplishments with frank repugnance. But even\nin the boisterous life of school, Coningsby, though his style was free\nand flowing, was always well-bred. His spirit recoiled from that gross\nfamiliarity that is the characteristic of modern manners, and which\nwould destroy all forms and ceremonies merely because they curb and\ncontrol their own coarse convenience and ill-disguised selfishness. To\nwomen, however, Coningsby instinctively bowed, as to beings set apart\nfor reverence and delicate treatment. Little as his experience was\nof them, his spirit had been fed with chivalrous fancies, and he\nentertained for them all the ideal devotion of a Surrey or a Sydney.\nInstructed, if not learned, as books and thought had already made him in\nmen, he could not conceive that there were any other women in the world\nthan fair Geraldines and Countesses of Pembroke.\n\nThere was not a country-house in England that had so completely the air\nof habitual residence as Beaumanoir. It is a charming trait, and\nvery rare. In many great mansions everything is as stiff, formal, and\ntedious, as if your host were a Spanish grandee in the days of the\nInquisition. No ease, no resources; the passing life seems a solemn\nspectacle in which you play a part. How delightful was the morning room\nat Beaumanoir; from which gentlemen were not excluded with that assumed\nsuspicion that they can never enter it but for felonious purposes.\nSuch a profusion of flowers! Such a multitude of books! Such a various\nprodigality of writing materials! So many easy chairs too, of so many\nshapes; each in itself a comfortable home; yet nothing crowded. Woman\nalone can organise a drawing-room; man succeeds sometimes in a library.\nAnd the ladies' work! How graceful they look bending over their\nembroidery frames, consulting over the arrangement of a group, or the\ncolour of a flower. The panniers and fanciful baskets, overflowing with\nvariegated worsted, are gay and full of pleasure to the eye, and give an\nair of elegant business that is vivifying. Even the sight of employment\ninterests.\n\nThen the morning costume of English women is itself a beautiful work of\nart. At this period of the day they can find no rivals in other climes.\nThe brilliant complexions of the daughters of the north dazzle in\ndaylight; the illumined saloon levels all distinctions. One should see\nthem in their well-fashioned muslin dresses. What matrons, and what\nmaidens! Full of graceful dignity, fresher than the morn! And the\nmarried beauty in her little lace cap. Ah, she is a coquette! A charming\ncharacter at all times; in a country-house an invaluable one.\n\nA coquette is a being who wishes to please. Amiable being! If you do not\nlike her, you will have no difficulty in finding a female companion of\na different mood. Alas! coquettes are but too rare. 'Tis a career that\nrequires great abilities, infinite pains, a gay and airy spirit. 'Tis\nthe coquette that provides all amusement; suggests the riding party,\nplans the picnic, gives and guesses charades, acts them. She is the\nstirring element amid the heavy congeries of social atoms; the soul of\nthe house, the salt of the banquet. Let any one pass a very agreeable\nweek, or it may be ten days, under any roof, and analyse the cause of\nhis satisfaction, and one might safely make a gentle wager that his\nsolution would present him with the frolic phantom of a coquette.\n\n'It is impossible that Mr. Coningsby can remember me!' said a clear\nvoice; and he looked round, and was greeted by a pair of sparkling eyes\nand the gayest smile in the world.\n\nIt was Lady Everingham, the Duke's married daughter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n'And you walked here!' said Lady Everingham to Coningsby, when the stir\nof arranging themselves at dinner had subsided. 'Only think, papa, Mr.\nConingsby walked here! I also am a great walker.'\n\n'I had heard much of the forest,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Which I am sure did not disappoint you,' said the Duke.\n\n'But forests without adventures!' said Lady Everingham, a little\nshrugging her pretty shoulders.\n\n'But I had an adventure,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Oh! tell it us by all means!' said the Lady, with great animation.\n'Adventures are my weakness. I have had more adventures than any one.\nHave I not had, Augustus?' she added, addressing her husband.\n\n'But you make everything out to be an adventure, Isabel,' said Lord\nEveringham. I dare say that Mr. Coningsby's was more substantial.' And\nlooking at our young friend, he invited him to inform them.\n\n'I met a most extraordinary man,' said Coningsby.\n\n'It should have been a heroine,' exclaimed Lady Everingham.\n\n'Do you know anybody in this neighbourhood who rides the finest Arab in\nthe world?' asked Coningsby. 'She is called \"the Daughter of the Star,\"\nand was given to her rider by the Pacha of Egypt.'\n\n'This is really an adventure,' said Lady Everingham, interested.\n\n'The Daughter of the Star!' said Lady Theresa. 'What a pretty name!\nPercy has a horse called \"Sunbeam.\"'\n\n'A fine Arab, the finest in the world!' said the Duke, who was fond of\nhorse. 'Who can it be?'\n\n'Can you throw any light on this, Mr. Lyle?' asked the Duchess of a\nyoung man who sat next her.\n\nHe was a neighbour who had joined their dinner-party, Eustace Lyle,\na Roman Catholic, and the richest commoner in the county; for he had\nsucceeded to a great estate early in his minority, which had only this\nyear terminated.\n\n'I certainly do not know the horse,' said Mr. Lyle; 'but if Mr.\nConingsby would describe the rider, perhaps--'\n\n'He is a man something under thirty,' said Coningsby, 'pale, with dark\nhair. We met in a sort of forest-inn during a storm. A most singular\nman! Indeed, I never met any one who seemed to me so clever, or to say\nsuch remarkable things.'\n\n'He must have been the spirit of the storm,' said Lady Everingham.\n\n'Charles Verney has a great deal of dark hair,' said Lady Theresa. 'But\nthen he is anything but pale, and his eyes are blue.'\n\n'And certainly he keeps his wonderful things for your ear, Theresa,'\nsaid her sister.\n\n'I wish that Mr. Coningsby would tell us some of the wonderful things he\nsaid,' said the Duchess, smiling.\n\n'Take a glass of wine first with my mother, Coningsby,' said Henry\nSydney, who had just finished helping them all to fish.\n\nConingsby had too much tact to be entrapped into a long story. He\nalready regretted that he had been betrayed into any allusion to the\nstranger. He had a wild, fanciful notion, that their meeting ought to\nhave been preserved as a sacred secret. But he had been impelled to\nrefer to it in the first instance by the chance observation of Lady\nEveringham; and he had pursued his remark from the hope that the\nconversation might have led to the discovery of the unknown. When he\nfound that his inquiry in this respect was unsuccessful, he was willing\nto turn the conversation. In reply to the Duchess, then, he generally\ndescribed the talk of the stranger as full of lively anecdote and\nepigrammatic views of life; and gave them, for example, a saying of an\nillustrious foreign Prince, which was quite new and pointed, and which\nConingsby told well. This led to a new train of discourse. The Duke also\nknew this illustrious foreign Prince, and told another story of him; and\nLord Everingham had played whist with this illustrious foreign Prince\noften at the Travellers', and this led to a third story; none of them\ntoo long. Then Lady Everingham came in again, and sparkled agreeably.\nShe, indeed, sustained throughout dinner the principal weight of the\nconversation; but, as she asked questions of everybody, all seemed to\ncontribute. Even the voice of Mr. Lyle, who was rather bashful, was\noccasionally heard in reply. Coningsby, who had at first unintentionally\ntaken a more leading part than he aspired to, would have retired\ninto the background for the rest of the dinner, but Lady Everingham\ncontinually signalled him out for her questions, and as she sat opposite\nto him, he seemed the person to whom they were principally addressed.\n\nAt length the ladies rose to retire. A very great personage in a\nforeign, but not remote country, once mentioned to the writer of these\npages, that he ascribed the superiority of the English in political\nlife, in their conduct of public business and practical views of\naffairs, in a great measure to 'that little half-hour' that separates,\nafter dinner, the dark from the fair sex. The writer humbly submitted,\nthat if the period of disjunction were strictly limited to a 'little\nhalf-hour,' its salutary consequences for both sexes need not be\ndisputed, but that in England the 'little half-hour' was too apt\nto swell into a term of far more awful character and duration. Lady\nEveringham was a disciple of the 'very little half-hour' school; for, as\nshe gaily followed her mother, she said to Coningsby, whose gracious lot\nit was to usher them from the apartment:\n\n'Pray do not be too long at the Board of Guardians to-day.'\n\nThese were prophetic words; for no sooner were they all again seated,\nthan the Duke, filling his glass and pushing the claret to Coningsby,\nobserved,\n\n'I suppose Lord Monmouth does not trouble himself much about the New\nPoor Law?'\n\n'Hardly,' said Coningsby. 'My grandfather's frequent absence from\nEngland, which his health, I believe, renders quite necessary, deprives\nhim of the advantage of personal observation on a subject, than which I\ncan myself conceive none more deeply interesting.'\n\n'I am glad to hear you say so,' said the Duke, 'and it does you great\ncredit, and Henry too, whose attention, I observe, is directed very much\nto these subjects. In my time, the young men did not think so much of\nsuch things, and we suffer consequently. By the bye, Everingham,\nyou, who are a Chairman of a Board of Guardians, can give me some\ninformation. Supposing a case of out-door relief--'\n\n'I could not suppose anything so absurd,' said the son-in-law.\n\n'Well,' rejoined the Duke, 'I know your views on that subject, and it\ncertainly is a question on which there is a good deal to be said. But\nwould you under any circumstances give relief out of the Union, even if\nthe parish were to save a considerable sum?'\n\n'I wish I knew the Union where such a system was followed,' said Lord\nEveringham; and his Grace seemed to tremble under his son-in-law's\nglance.\n\nThe Duke had a good heart, and not a bad head. If he had not made in\nhis youth so many Latin and English verses, he might have acquired\nconsiderable information, for he had a natural love of letters, though\nhis pack were the pride of England, his barrel seldom missed, and his\nfortune on the turf, where he never betted, was a proverb. He was good,\nand he wished to do good; but his views were confused from want of\nknowledge, and his conduct often inconsistent because a sense of duty\nmade him immediately active; and he often acquired in the consequent\nexperience a conviction exactly contrary to that which had prompted his\nactivity.\n\nHis Grace had been a great patron and a zealous administrator of the New\nPoor Law. He had been persuaded that it would elevate the condition of\nthe labouring class. His son-in-law, Lord Everingham, who was a Whig,\nand a clearheaded, cold-blooded man, looked upon the New Poor Law as\nanother Magna Charta. Lord Everingham was completely master of the\nsubject. He was himself the Chairman of one of the most considerable\nUnions of the kingdom. The Duke, if he ever had a misgiving, had no\nchance in argument with his son-in-law. Lord Everingham overwhelmed\nhim with quotations from Commissioners' rules and Sub-commissioners'\nreports, statistical tables, and references to dietaries. Sometimes with\na strong case, the Duke struggled to make a fight; but Lord Everingham,\nwhen he was at fault for a reply, which was very rare, upbraided his\nfather-in-law with the abuses of the old system, and frightened him with\nvisions of rates exceeding rentals.\n\nOf late, however, a considerable change had taken place in the Duke's\nfeelings on this great question. His son Henry entertained strong\nopinions upon it, and had combated his father with all the fervour of a\nyoung votary. A victory over his Grace, indeed, was not very difficult.\nHis natural impulse would have enlisted him on the side, if not of\nopposition to the new system, at least of critical suspicion of its\nspirit and provisions. It was only the statistics and sharp acuteness\nof his son-in-law that had, indeed, ever kept him to his colours. Lord\nHenry would not listen to statistics, dietary tables, Commissioners'\nrides, Sub-commissioners' reports. He went far higher than his father;\nfar deeper than his brother-in-law. He represented to the Duke that the\norder of the peasantry was as ancient, legal, and recognised an order as\nthe order of the nobility; that it had distinct rights and privileges,\nthough for centuries they had been invaded and violated, and permitted\nto fall into desuetude. He impressed upon the Duke that the parochial\nconstitution of this country was more important than its political\nconstitution; that it was more ancient, more universal in its influence;\nand that this parochial constitution had already been shaken to its\ncentre by the New Poor Law. He assured his father that it would never be\nwell for England until this order of the peasantry was restored to its\npristine condition; not merely in physical comfort, for that must vary\naccording to the economical circumstances of the time, like that of\nevery class; but to its condition in all those moral attributes which\nmake a recognised rank in a nation; and which, in a great degree, are\nindependent of economics, manners, customs, ceremonies, rights, and\nprivileges.\n\n'Henry thinks,' said Lord Everingham, 'that the people are to be fed by\ndancing round a May-pole.'\n\n'But will the people be more fed because they do not dance round a\nMay-pole?' urged Lord Henry.\n\n'Obsolete customs!' said Lord Everingham.\n\n'And why should dancing round a May-pole be more obsolete than holding a\nChapter of the Garter?' asked Lord Henry.\n\nThe Duke, who was a blue ribbon, felt this a home thrust. 'I must say,'\nsaid his Grace, 'that I for one deeply regret that our popular customs\nhave been permitted to fall so into desuetude.'\n\n'The Spirit of the Age is against such things,' said Lord Everingham.\n\n'And what is the Spirit of the Age?' asked Coningsby.\n\n'The Spirit of Utility,' said Lord Everingham.\n\n'And you think then that ceremony is not useful?' urged Coningsby,\nmildly.\n\n'It depends upon circumstances,' said Lord Everingham. 'There are some\nceremonies, no doubt, that are very proper, and of course very useful.\nBut the best thing we can do for the labouring classes is to provide\nthem with work.'\n\n'But what do you mean by the labouring classes, Everingham?' asked Lord\nHenry. 'Lawyers are a labouring class, for instance, and by the bye\nsufficiently provided with work. But would you approve of Westminster\nHall being denuded of all its ceremonies?'\n\n'And the long vacation being abolished?' added Coningsby.\n\n'Theresa brings me terrible accounts of the sufferings of the poor about\nus,' said the Duke, shaking his head.\n\n'Women think everything to be suffering!' said Lord Everingham.\n\n'How do you find them about you, Mr. Lyle?' continued the Duke.\n\n'I have revived the monastic customs at St. Genevieve,' said the young\nman, blushing. 'There is an almsgiving twice a-week.'\n\n'I am sure I wish I could see the labouring classes happy,' said the\nDuke.\n\n'Oh! pray do not use, my dear father, that phrase, the labouring\nclasses!' said Lord Henry. 'What do you think, Coningsby, the other day\nwe had a meeting in this neighbourhood to vote an agricultural petition\nthat was to comprise all classes. I went with my father, and I was\nmade chairman of the committee to draw up the petition. Of course, I\ndescribed it as the petition of the nobility, clergy, gentry, yeomanry,\nand peasantry of the county of ----; and, could you believe it,\nthey struck out _peasantry_ as a word no longer used, and inserted\n_labourers_.'\n\n'What can it signify,' said Lord Everingham, 'whether a man be called a\nlabourer or a peasant?'\n\n'And what can it signify,' said his brother-in-law, 'whether a man be\ncalled Mr. Howard or Lord Everingham?'\n\nThey were the most affectionate family under this roof of Beaumanoir,\nand of all members of it, Lord Henry the sweetest tempered, and yet it\nwas astonishing what sharp skirmishes every day arose between him and\nhis brother-in-law, during that 'little half-hour' that forms so happily\nthe political character of the nation. The Duke, who from experience\nfelt that a guerilla movement was impending, asked his guests whether\nthey would take any more claret; and on their signifying their dissent,\nmoved an adjournment to the ladies.\n\nThey joined the ladies in the music-room. Coningsby, not experienced\nin feminine society, and who found a little difficulty from want\nof practice in maintaining conversation, though he was desirous\nof succeeding, was delighted with Lady Everingham, who, instead of\nrequiring to be amused, amused him; and suggested so many subjects,\nand glanced at so many topics, that there never was that cold, awkward\npause, so common with sullen spirits and barren brains. Lady Everingham\nthoroughly understood the art of conversation, which, indeed, consists\nof the exercise of two fine qualities. You must originate, and you must\nsympathise; you must possess at the same time the habit of communicating\nand the habit of listening. The union is rather rare, but irresistible.\n\nLady Everingham was not a celebrated beauty, but she was something\ninfinitely more delightful, a captivating woman. There were combined,\nin her, qualities not commonly met together, great vivacity of mind with\ngreat grace of manner. Her words sparkled and her movements charmed.\nThere was, indeed, in all she said and did, that congruity that\nindicates a complete and harmonious organisation. It was the same just\nproportion which characterised her form: a shape slight and undulating\nwith grace; the most beautifully shaped ear; a small, soft hand; a foot\nthat would have fitted the glass slipper; and which, by the bye, she\nlost no opportunity of displaying; and she was right, for it was a\nmodel.\n\nThen there was music. Lady Theresa sang like a seraph: a rich voice, a\ngrand style. And her sister could support her with grace and sweetness.\nAnd they did not sing too much. The Duke took up a review, and looked\nat Rigby's last slashing article. The country seemed ruined, but it\nappeared that the Whigs were still worse off than the Tories. The\nassassins had committed suicide. This poetical justice is pleasing. Lord\nEveringham, lounging in an easy chair, perused with great satisfaction\nhis _Morning Chronicle_, which contained a cutting reply to Mr. Rigby's\narticle, not quite so 'slashing' as the Right Honourable scribe's\nmanifesto, but with some searching mockery, that became the subject and\nthe subject-monger.\n\nMr. Lyle seated himself by the Duchess, and encouraged by her amenity,\nand speaking in whispers, became animated and agreeable, occasionally\npatting the lap-dog. Coningsby stood by the singers, or talked with\nthem when the music had ceased: and Henry Sydney looked over a volume\nof Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_, occasionally, without taking his eyes\noff the volume, calling the attention of his friends to his discoveries.\n\nMr. Lyle rose to depart, for he had some miles to return; he came\nforward with some hesitation, to hope that Coningsby would visit his\nbloodhounds, which Lord Henry had told him Coningsby had expressed\na wish to do. Lady Everingham remarked that she had not been at St.\nGenevieve since she was a girl, and it appeared Lady Theresa had never\nvisited it. Lady Everingham proposed that they should all ride over\non the morrow, and she appealed to her husband for his approbation,\ninstantly given, for though she loved admiration, and he apparently was\nan iceberg, they were really devoted to each other. Then there was a\nconsultation as to their arrangements. The Duchess would drive over in\nher pony chair with Theresa. The Duke, as usual, had affairs that\nwould occupy him. The rest were to ride. It was a happy suggestion, all\nanticipated pleasure; and the evening terminated with the prospect of\nwhat Lady Everingham called an adventure.\n\nThe ladies themselves soon withdrew; the gentlemen lingered for a\nwhile; the Duke took up his candle, and bid his guests good night; Lord\nEveringham drank a glass of Seltzer water, nodded, and vanished. Lord\nHenry and his friend sat up talking over the past. They were too young\nto call them old times; and yet what a life seemed to have elapsed since\nthey had quitted Eton, dear old Eton! Their boyish feelings, and still\nlatent boyish character, developed with their reminiscences.\n\n'Do you remember Bucknall? Which Bucknall? The eldest: I saw him the\nother day at Nottingham; he is in the Rifles. Do you remember that day\nat Sirly Hall, that Paulet had that row with Dickinson? Did you like\nDickinson? Hum! Paulet was a good fellow. I tell you who was a good\nfellow, Paulet's little cousin. What! Augustus Le Grange? Oh! I liked\nAugustus Le Grange. I wonder where Buckhurst is? I had a letter from him\nthe other day. He has gone with his uncle to Paris. We shall find him at\nCambridge in October. I suppose you know Millbank has gone to Oriel. Has\nhe, though! I wonder who will have our room at Cookesley's? Cookesley\nwas a good fellow! Oh, capital! How well he behaved when there was that\nrow about our going out with the hounds? Do you remember Vere's face? It\nmakes me laugh now when I think of it. I tell you who was a good fellow,\nKangaroo Gray; I liked him. I don't know any fellow who sang a better\nsong!'\n\n'By the bye,' said Coningsby, 'what sort of fellow is Eustace Lyle? I\nrather liked his look.'\n\n'Oh! I will tell you all about him,' said Lord Henry. 'He is a great\nally of mine, and I think you will like him very much. It is a Roman\nCatholic family, about the oldest we have in the county, and the\nwealthiest. You see, Lyle's father was the most violent ultra Whig,\nand so were all Eustace's guardians; but the moment he came of age, he\nannounced that he should not mix himself up with either of the parties\nin the county, and that his tenantry might act exactly as they thought\nfit. My father thinks, of course, that Lyle is a Conservative, and that\nhe only waits the occasion to come forward; but he is quite wrong. I\nknow Lyle well, and he speaks to me without disguise. You see 'tis an\nold Cavalier family, and Lyle has all the opinions and feelings of his\nrace. He will not ally himself with anti-monarchists, and democrats,\nand infidels, and sectarians; at the same time, why should he support a\nparty who pretend to oppose these, but who never lose an opportunity\nof insulting his religion, and would deprive him, if possible, of\nthe advantages of the very institutions which his family assisted in\nestablishing?'\n\n'Why, indeed? I am glad to have made his acquaintance,' said Coningsby.\n'Is he clever?'\n\n'I think so,' said Lord Henry. 'He is the most shy fellow, especially\namong women, that I ever knew, but he is very popular in the county. He\ndoes an amazing deal of good, and is one of the best riders we have. My\nfather says, the very best; bold, but so very certain.'\n\n'He is older than we are?'\n\n'My senior by a year: he is just of age.'\n\n'Oh, ah! twenty-one. A year younger than Gaston de Foix when he won\nRavenna, and four years younger than John of Austria when he won\nLepanto,' observed Coningsby, musingly. 'I vote we go to bed, old\nfellow!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nIn a valley, not far from the margin of a beautiful river, raised on a\nlofty and artificial terrace at the base of a range of wooded heights,\nwas a pile of modern building in the finest style of Christian\narchitecture. It was of great extent and richly decorated. Built of\na white and glittering stone, it sparkled with its pinnacles in the\nsunshine as it rose in strong relief against its verdant background.\nThe winding valley, which was studded, but not too closely studded, with\nclumps of old trees, formed for a great extent on either side of the\nmansion a grassy demesne, which was called the Lower Park; but it was\na region bearing the name of the Upper Park, that was the peculiar and\nmost picturesque feature of this splendid residence. The wooded heights\nthat formed the valley were not, as they appeared, a range of hills.\nTheir crest was only the abrupt termination of a vast and enclosed\ntableland, abounding in all the qualities of the ancient chase: turf and\ntrees, a wilderness of underwood, and a vast spread of gorse and fern.\nThe deer, that abounded, lived here in a world as savage as themselves:\ntrooping down in the evening to the river. Some of them, indeed, were\never in sight of those who were in the valley, and you might often\nobserve various groups clustered on the green heights above the mansion,\nthe effect of which was most inspiriting and graceful. Sometimes in the\ntwilight, a solitary form, magnified by the illusive hour, might be seen\nstanding on the brink of the steep, large and black against the clear\nsky.\n\nWe have endeavoured slightly to sketch St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve as it appeared to\nour friends from Beaumanoir, winding into the valley the day after\nMr. Lyle had dined with them. The valley opened for about half-a-mile\nopposite the mansion, which gave to the dwellers in it a view over an\nextensive and richly-cultivated country. It was through this district\nthat the party from Beaumanoir had pursued their way. The first glance\nat the building, its striking situation, its beautiful form, its\nbrilliant colour, its great extent, a gathering as it seemed of\ngalleries, halls, and chapels, mullioned windows, portals of clustered\ncolumns, and groups of airy pinnacles and fretwork spires, called forth\na general cry of wonder and of praise.\n\nThe ride from Beaumanoir had been delightful; the breath of summer in\nevery breeze, the light of summer on every tree. The gay laugh of\nLady Everingham rang frequently in the air; often were her sunny eyes\ndirected to Coningsby, as she called his attention to some fair object\nor some pretty effect. She played the hostess of Nature, and introduced\nhim to all the beauties.\n\nMr. Lyle had recognised them. He cantered forward with greetings on a\nfat little fawn-coloured pony, with a long white mane and white flowing\ntail, and the wickedest eye in the world. He rode by the side of the\nDuchess, and indicated their gently-descending route.\n\nThey arrived, and the peacocks, who were sunning themselves on the\nturrets, expanded their plumage to welcome them.\n\n'I can remember the old house,' said the Duchess, as she took Mr. Lyle's\narm; 'and I am happy to see the new one. The Duke had prepared me for\nmuch beauty, but the reality exceeds his report.'\n\nThey entered by a short corridor into a large hall. They would have\nstopped to admire its rich roof, its gallery and screen; but their host\nsuggested that they should refresh themselves after their ride, and they\nfollowed him through several apartments into a spacious chamber, its\noaken panels covered with a series of interesting pictures, representing\nthe siege of St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve by the Parliament forces in 1643: the various\nassaults and sallies, and the final discomfiture of the rebels. In all\nthese figured a brave and graceful Sir Eustace Lyle, in cuirass and\nbuff jerkin, with gleaming sword and flowing plume. The sight of these\npictures was ever a source of great excitement to Henry Sydney, who\nalways lamented his ill-luck in not living in such days; nay, would\ninsist that all others must equally deplore their evil destiny.\n\n'See, Coningsby, this battery on the Upper Park,' said Lord Henry.\n'This did the business: how it rakes up the valley; Sir Eustace works it\nhimself. Mother, what a pity Beaumanoir was not besieged!'\n\n'It may be,' said Coningsby.\n\n'I always fancy a siege must be so interesting,' said Lady Everingham.\n'It must be so exciting.'\n\n'I hope the next siege may be at Beaumanoir, instead of St.\nGenevi\u00c3\u00a8ve,' said Lyle, laughing; 'as Henry Sydney has such a military\npredisposition. Duchess, you said the other day that you liked\nMalvoisie, and here is some.\n\n  'Now broach me a cask of Malvoisie,\n  Bring pasty from the doe;'\n\nsaid the Duchess. 'That has been my luncheon.'\n\n'A poetic repast,' said Lady Theresa.\n\n'Their breeds of sheep must have been very inferior in old days,' said\nLord Everingham, 'as they made such a noise about their venison. For my\npart I consider it a thing as much gone by as tilts and tournaments.'\n\n'I am sorry that they have gone by,' said Lady Theresa.\n\n'Everything has gone by that is beautiful,' said Lord Henry.\n\n'Life is much easier,' said Lord Everingham.\n\n'Life easy!' said Lord Henry. 'Life appears to me to be a fierce\nstruggle.'\n\n'Manners are easy,' said Coningsby, 'and life is hard.'\n\n'And I wish to see things exactly the reverse,' said Lord Henry. 'The\nmeans and modes of subsistence less difficult; the conduct of life more\nceremonious.'\n\n'Civilisation has no time for ceremony,' said Lord Everingham.\n\n'How very sententious you all are!' said his wife. 'I want to see the\nhall and many other things.' And they all rose.\n\nThere were indeed many other things to see: a long gallery, rich in\nancestral portraits, specimens of art and costume from Holbein to\nLawrence; courtiers of the Tudors, and cavaliers of the Stuarts,\nterminating in red-coated squires fresh from the field, and gentlemen\nbuttoned up in black coats, and sitting in library chairs, with their\nbacks to a crimson curtain. Woman, however, is always charming; and the\npresent generation may view their mothers painted by Lawrence, as if\nthey were patronesses of Almack's; or their grandmothers by Reynolds,\nas Robinettas caressing birds, with as much delight as they gaze on\nthe dewy-eyed matrons of Lely, and the proud bearing of the heroines\nof Vandyke. But what interested them more than the gallery, or the rich\nsaloons, or even the baronial hall, was the chapel, in which art had\nexhausted all its invention, and wealth offered all its resources.\nThe walls and vaulted roofs entirely painted in encaustic by the first\nartists of Germany, and representing the principal events of the second\nTestament, the splendour of the mosaic pavement, the richness of\nthe painted windows, the sumptuousness of the altar, crowned by a\nmasterpiece of Carlo Dolce and surrounded by a silver rail, the tone\nof rich and solemn light that pervaded all, and blended all the various\nsources of beauty into one absorbing and harmonious whole: all combined\nto produce an effect which stilled them into a silence that lasted for\nsome minutes, until the ladies breathed their feelings in an almost\ninarticulate murmur of reverence and admiration; while a tear stole to\nthe eye of the enthusiastic Henry Sydney.\n\nLeaving the chapel, they sauntered through the gardens, until, arriving\nat their limit, they were met by the prettiest sight in the world; a\ngroup of little pony chairs, each drawn by a little fat fawn-coloured\npony, like the one that Mr. Lyle had been riding. Lord Henry drove his\nmother; Lord Everingham, Lady Theresa; Lady Everingham was attended by\nConingsby. Their host cantered by the Duchess's side, and along winding\nroads of easy ascent, leading through beautiful woods, and offering\ncharming landscapes, they reached in due time the Upper Park.\n\n'One sees our host to great advantage in his own house,' said Lady\nEveringham. 'He is scarcely the same person. I have not observed him\nonce blush. He speaks and moves with ease. It is a pity that he is not\nmore graceful. Above all things I like a graceful man.'\n\n'That chapel,' said Coningsby, 'was a fine thing.'\n\n'Very!' said Lady Everingham. 'Did you observe the picture over the\naltar, the Virgin with blue eyes? I never observed blue eyes before in\nsuch a picture. What is your favourite colour for eyes?'\n\nConingsby felt embarrassed: he said something rather pointless about\nadmiring everything that was beautiful.\n\n'But every one has a favourite style; I want to know yours. Regular\nfeatures, do you like regular features? Or is it expression that pleases\nyou?'\n\n'Expression; I think I like expression. Expression must be always\ndelightful.'\n\n'Do you dance?'\n\n'No; I am no great dancer. I fear I have few accomplishments. I am fond\nof fencing.'\n\n'I don't fence,' said Lady Everingham, with a smile. 'But I think you\nare right not to dance. It is not in your way. You are ambitious, I\nbelieve?' she added.\n\n'I was not aware of it; everybody is ambitious.'\n\n'You see I know something of your character. Henry has spoken of you to\nme a great deal; long before we met,--met again, I should say, for we\nare old friends, remember. Do you know your career much interests me? I\nlike ambitious men.'\n\nThere is something fascinating in the first idea that your career\ninterests a charming woman. Coningsby felt that he was perhaps driving\na Madame de Longueville. A woman who likes ambitious men must be no\nordinary character; clearly a sort of heroine. At this moment they\nreached the Upper Park, and the novel landscape changed the current of\ntheir remarks.\n\nFar as the eye could reach there spread before them a savage sylvan\nscene. It wanted, perhaps, undulation of surface, but that deficiency\nwas greatly compensated for by the multitude and prodigious size of the\ntrees; they were the largest, indeed, that could well be met with in\nEngland; and there is no part of Europe where the timber is so huge.\nThe broad interminable glades, the vast avenues, the quantity of deer\nbrowsing or bounding in all directions, the thickets of yellow gorse and\ngreen fern, and the breeze that even in the stillness of summer was ever\nplaying over this table-land, all produced an animated and renovating\nscene. It was like suddenly visiting another country, living among other\nmanners, and breathing another air. They stopped for a few minutes at\na pavilion built for the purposes of the chase, and then returned, all\ngratified by this visit to what appeared to be the higher regions of the\nearth.\n\nAs they approached the brow of the hill that hung over St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve,\nthey heard the great bell sound.\n\n'What is that?' asked the Duchess.\n\n'It is almsgiving day,' replied Mr. Lyle, looking a little embarrassed,\nand for the first time blushing. 'The people of the parishes with which\nI am connected come to St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve twice a-week at this hour.'\n\n'And what is your system?' inquired Lord Everingham, who had stopped,\ninterested by the scene. 'What check have you?'\n\n'The rectors of the different parishes grant certificates to those\nwho in their belief merit bounty according to the rules which I have\nestablished. These are again visited by my almoner, who countersigns\nthe certificate, and then they present it at the postern-gate. The\ncertificate explains the nature of their necessities, and my steward\nacts on his discretion.\n\n'Mamma, I see them!' exclaimed Lady Theresa.\n\n'Perhaps your Grace may think that they might be relieved without all\nthis ceremony,' said Mr. Lyle, extremely confused. 'But I agree with\nHenry and Mr. Coningsby, that Ceremony is not, as too commonly supposed,\nan idle form. I wish the people constantly and visibly to comprehend\nthat Property is their protector and their friend.'\n\n'My reason is with you, Mr. Lyle,' said the Duchess, 'as well as my\nheart.'\n\nThey came along the valley, a procession of Nature, whose groups an\nartist might have studied. The old man, who loved the pilgrimage too\nmuch to avail himself of the privilege of a substitute accorded to his\ngrey hairs, came in person with his grandchild and his staff. There also\ncame the widow with her child at the breast, and others clinging to her\nform; some sorrowful faces, and some pale; many a serious one, and\nnow and then a frolic glance; many a dame in her red cloak, and many a\nmaiden with her light basket; curly-headed urchins with demure looks,\nand sometimes a stalwart form baffled for a time of the labour which he\ndesired. But not a heart there that did not bless the bell that sounded\nfrom the tower of St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n'My fathers perilled their blood and fortunes for the cause of the\nSovereignty and Church of England,' said Lyle to Coningsby, as they were\nlying stretched out on the sunny turf in the park of Beaumanoir,' and\nI inherit their passionate convictions. They were Catholics, as their\ndescendant. No doubt they would have been glad to see their ancient\nfaith predominant in their ancient land; but they bowed, as I bow, to an\nadverse and apparently irrevocable decree. But if we could not have the\nChurch of our fathers, we honoured and respected the Church of their\nchildren. It was at least a Church; a 'Catholic and Apostolic Church,'\nas it daily declares itself. Besides, it was our friend. When we were\npersecuted by Puritanic Parliaments, it was the Sovereign and the Church\nof England that interposed, with the certainty of creating against\nthemselves odium and mistrust, to shield us from the dark and relentless\nbigotry of Calvinism.'\n\n'I believe,' said Coningsby, 'that if Charles I. had hanged all the\nCatholic priests that Parliament petitioned him to execute, he would\nnever have lost his crown.'\n\n'You were mentioning my father,' continued Lyle. 'He certainly was a\nWhig. Galled by political exclusion, he connected himself with that\nparty in the State which began to intimate emancipation. After all, they\ndid not emancipate us. It was the fall of the Papacy in England that\nfounded the Whig aristocracy; a fact that must always lie at the bottom\nof their hearts, as, I assure you, it does of mine.\n\n'I gathered at an early age,' continued Lyle, 'that I was expected to\ninherit my father's political connections with the family estates. Under\nordinary circumstances this would probably have occurred. In times that\ndid not force one to ponder, it is not likely I should have recoiled\nfrom uniting myself with a party formed of the best families in England,\nand ever famous for accomplished men and charming women. But I enter\nlife in the midst of a convulsion in which the very principles of our\npolitical and social systems are called in question. I cannot unite\nmyself with the party of destruction. It is an operative cause alien\nto my being. What, then, offers itself? The Duke talks to me of\nConservative principles; but he does not inform me what they are. I\nobserve indeed a party in the State whose rule it is to consent to no\nchange, until it is clamorously called for, and then instantly to yield;\nbut those are Concessionary, not Conservative principles. This party\ntreats institutions as we do our pheasants, they preserve only to\ndestroy them. But is there a statesman among these Conservatives who\noffers us a dogma for a guide, or defines any great political truth\nwhich we should aspire to establish? It seems to me a, barren thing,\nthis Conservatism, an unhappy cross-breed; the mule of politics that\nengenders nothing. What do you think of all this, Coningsby? I assure\nyou I feel confused, perplexed, harassed. I know I have public duties to\nperform; I am, in fact, every day of my life solicited by all parties\nto throw the weight of my influence in one scale or another; but I am\nparalysed. I often wish I had no position in the country. The sense\nof its responsibility depresses me; makes me miserable. I speak to you\nwithout reserve; with a frankness which our short acquaintance scarcely\nauthorises; but Henry Sydney has so often talked to me of you, and\nI have so long wished to know you, that I open my heart without\nrestraint.'\n\n'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'you have but described my feelings\nwhen you depicted your own. My mind on these subjects has long been\na chaos. I float in a sea of troubles, and should long ago have\nbeen wrecked had I not been sustained by a profound, however vague,\nconviction, that there are still great truths, if we could but work them\nout; that Government, for instance, should be loved and not hated, and\nthat Religion should be a faith and not a form.'\n\nThe moral influence of residence furnishes some of the most interesting\ntraits of our national manners. The presence of this power was very\napparent throughout the district that surrounded Beaumanoir. The ladies\nof that house were deeply sensible of the responsibility of their\nposition; thoroughly comprehending their duties, they fulfilled them\nwithout affectation, with earnestness, and with that effect which\nsprings from a knowledge of the subject. The consequences were visible\nin the tone of the peasantry being superior to that which we too often\nwitness. The ancient feudal feeling that lingers in these sequestered\nhaunts is an instrument which, when skilfully wielded, may be productive\nof vast social benefit. The Duke understood this well; and his family\nhad imbibed all his views, and seconded them. Lady Everingham, once more\nin the scene of her past life, resumed the exercise of gentle offices,\nas if she had never ceased to be a daughter of the house, and as if\nanother domain had not its claims upon her solicitude. Coningsby was\noften the companion of herself and her sister in their pilgrimages\nof charity and kindness. He admired the graceful energy, and thorough\nacquaintance with details, with which Lady Everingham superintended\nschools, organised societies of relief, and the discrimination which she\nbrought to bear upon individual cases of suffering or misfortune. He was\ndeeply interested as he watched the magic of her manner, as she melted\nthe obdurate, inspired the slothful, consoled the afflicted, and\nanimated with her smiles and ready phrase the energetic and the dutiful.\nNor on these occasions was Lady Theresa seen under less favourable\nauspices. Without the vivacity of her sister, there was in her demeanour\na sweet seriousness of purpose that was most winning; and sometimes a\nburst of energy, a trait of decision, which strikingly contrasted with\nthe somewhat over-controlled character of her life in drawing-rooms.\n\nIn the society of these engaging companions, time for Coningsby glided\naway in a course which he sometimes wished nothing might disturb. Apart\nfrom them, he frequently felt himself pensive and vaguely disquieted.\nEven the society of Henry Sydney or Eustace Lyle, much as under\nordinary circumstances they would have been adapted to his mood, did not\ncompensate for the absence of that indefinite, that novel, that strange,\nyet sweet excitement, which he felt, he knew not exactly how or why,\nstealing over his senses. Sometimes the countenance of Theresa Sydney\nflitted over his musing vision; sometimes the merry voice of Lady\nEveringham haunted his ear. But to be their companion in ride or ramble;\nto avoid any arrangement which for many hours should deprive him of\ntheir presence; was every day with Coningsby a principal object.\n\nOne day he had been out shooting rabbits with Lyle and Henry Sydney, and\nreturned with them late to Beaumanoir to dinner. He had not enjoyed his\nsport, and he had not shot at all well. He had been dreamy, silent, had\ndeeply felt the want of Lady Everingham's conversation, that was ever so\npoignant and so interestingly personal to himself; one of the secrets of\nher sway, though Coningsby was not then quite conscious of it. Talk to a\nman about himself, and he is generally captivated. That is the real way\nto win him. The only difference between men and women in this respect\nis, that most women are vain, and some men are not. There are some men\nwho have no self-love; but if they have, female vanity is but a trifling\nand airy passion compared with the vast voracity of appetite which in\nthe sterner sex can swallow anything, and always crave for more.\n\nWhen Coningsby entered the drawing-room, there seemed a somewhat unusual\nbustle in the room, but as the twilight had descended, it was at first\nrather difficult to distinguish who was present. He soon perceived that\nthere were strangers. A gentleman of pleasing appearance was near a sofa\non which the Duchess and Lady Everingham were seated, and discoursing\nwith some volubility. His phrases seemed to command attention; his\naudience had an animated glance, eyes sparkling with intelligence and\ninterest; not a word was disregarded. Coningsby did not advance as was\nhis custom; he had a sort of instinct, that the stranger was discoursing\nof matters of which he knew nothing. He turned to a table, he took up a\nbook, which he began to read upside downwards. A hand was lightly placed\non his shoulder. He looked round, it was another stranger; who said,\nhowever, in a tone of familiar friendliness,\n\n'How do you do, Coningsby?'\n\nIt was a young man about four-and-twenty years of age, tall,\ngood-looking. Old recollections, his intimate greeting, a strong family\nlikeness, helped Coningsby to conjecture correctly who was the person\nwho addressed him. It was, indeed, the eldest son of the Duke, the\nMarquis of Beaumanoir, who had arrived at his father's unexpectedly with\nhis friend, Mr. Melton, on their way to the north.\n\nMr. Melton was a gentleman of the highest fashion, and a great favourite\nin society. He was about thirty, good-looking, with an air that\ncommanded attention, and manners, though facile, sufficiently finished.\nHe was communicative, though calm, and without being witty, had at his\nservice a turn of phrase, acquired by practice and success, which was,\nor which always seemed to be, poignant. The ladies seemed especially to\nbe delighted at his arrival. He knew everything of everybody they cared\nabout; and Coningsby listened in silence to names which for the first\ntime reached his ears, but which seemed to excite great interest. Mr.\nMelton frequently addressed his most lively observations and his most\nsparkling anecdotes to Lady Everingham, who evidently relished all that\nhe said, and returned him in kind.\n\nThroughout the dinner Lady Everingham and Mr. Melton maintained what\nappeared a most entertaining conversation, principally about things and\npersons which did not in any way interest our hero; who, however, had\nthe satisfaction of hearing Lady Everingham, in the drawing-room, say in\na careless tone to the Duchess.\n\n'I am so glad, mamma, that Mr. Melton has come; we wanted some\namusement.'\n\nWhat a confession! What a revelation to Coningsby of his infinite\ninsignificance! Coningsby entertained a great aversion for Mr. Melton,\nbut felt his spirit unequal to the social contest. The genius of\nthe untutored, inexperienced youth quailed before that of the\nlong-practised, skilful man of the world. What was the magic of this\nman? What was the secret of this ease, that nothing could disturb, and\nyet was not deficient in deference and good taste? And then his dress,\nit seemed fashioned by some unearthly artist; yet it was impossible\nto detect the unobtrusive causes of the general effect that was\nirresistible. Coningsby's coat was made by Stultz; almost every fellow\nin the sixth form had his coats made by Stultz; yet Coningsby fancied\nthat his own garment looked as if it had been furnished by some rustic\nslopseller. He began to wonder where Mr. Melton got his boots from, and\nglanced at his own, which, though made in St. James's Street, seemed to\nhim to have a cloddish air.\n\nLady Everingham was determined that Mr. Melton should see Beaumanoir to\nthe greatest advantage. Mr. Melton had never been there before, except\nat Christmas, with the house full of visitors and factitious gaiety. Now\nhe was to see the country. Accordingly, there were long rides every day,\nwhich Lady Everingham called expeditions, and which generally produced\nsome slight incident which she styled an adventure. She was kind to\nConingsby, but had no time to indulge in the lengthened conversations\nwhich he had previously found so magical. Mr. Melton was always on\nthe scene, the monopolising hero, it would seem, of every thought, and\nphrase, and plan. Coningsby began to think that Beaumanoir was not so\ndelightful a place as he had imagined. He began to think that he had\nstayed there perhaps too long. He had received a letter from Mr. Rigby,\nto inform him that he was expected at Coningsby Castle at the beginning\nof September, to meet Lord Monmouth, who had returned to England, and\nfor grave and special reasons was about to reside at his chief seat,\nwhich he had not visited for many years. Coningsby had intended to have\nremained at Beaumanoir until that time; but suddenly it occurred to\nhim, that the Age of Ruins was past, and that he ought to seize the\nopportunity of visiting Manchester, which was in the same county as the\ncastle of his grandfather. So difficult is it to speculate upon\nevents! Muse as we may, we are the creatures of circumstances; and the\nunexpected arrival of a London dandy at the country-seat of an English\nnobleman sent this representative of the New Generation, fresh from\nEton, nursed in prejudices, yet with a mind predisposed to inquiry\nand prone to meditation, to a scene apt to stimulate both intellectual\nprocesses; which demanded investigation and induced thought, the great\nMETROPOLIS OF LABOUR.\n\nEND OF BOOK III.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nA great city, whose image dwells in the memory of man, is the type of\nsome great idea. Rome represents conquest; Faith hovers over the towers\nof Jerusalem; and Athens embodies the pre-eminent quality of the antique\nworld, Art.\n\nIn modern ages, Commerce has created London; while Manners, in the most\ncomprehensive sense of the word, have long found a supreme capital in\nthe airy and bright-minded city of the Seine.\n\nArt was to the ancient world, Science is to the modern: the distinctive\nfaculty. In the minds of men the useful has succeeded to the beautiful.\nInstead of the city of the Violet Crown, a Lancashire village has\nexpanded into a mighty region of factories and warehouses. Yet, rightly\nunderstood, Manchester is as great a human exploit as Athens.\n\nThe inhabitants, indeed, are not so impressed with their idiosyncrasy as\nthe countrymen of Pericles and Phidias. They do not fully comprehend the\nposition which they occupy. It is the philosopher alone who can conceive\nthe grandeur of Manchester, and the immensity of its future. There are\nyet great truths to tell, if we had either the courage to announce or\nthe temper to receive them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nA feeling of melancholy, even of uneasiness, attends our first entrance\ninto a great town, especially at night. Is it that the sense of all this\nvast existence with which we have no connexion, where we are utterly\nunknown, oppresses us with our insignificance? Is it that it is terrible\nto feel friendless where all have friends?\n\nYet reverse the picture. Behold a community where you are unknown, but\nwhere you will be known, perhaps honoured. A place where you have no\nfriends, but where, also, you have no enemies. A spot that has hitherto\nbeen a blank in your thoughts, as you have been a cipher in its\nsensations, and yet a spot, perhaps, pregnant with your destiny!\n\nThere is, perhaps, no act of memory so profoundly interesting as to\nrecall the careless mood and moment in which we have entered a town,\na house, a chamber, on the eve of an acquaintance or an event that has\ngiven colour and an impulse to our future life.\n\nWhat is this Fatality that men worship? Is it a Goddess?\n\nUnquestionably it is a power that acts mainly by female agents. Women\nare the Priestesses of Predestination.\n\nMan conceives Fortune, but Woman conducts it.\n\nIt is the Spirit of Man that says, 'I will be great;' but it is the\nSympathy of Woman that usually makes him so.\n\nIt was not the comely and courteous hostess of the Adelphi Hotel,\nManchester, that gave occasion to these remarks, though she may deserve\nthem, and though she was most kind to our Coningsby as he came in late\nat night very tired, and not in very good humour.\n\nHe had travelled the whole day through the great district of labour,\nhis mind excited by strange sights, and at length wearied by their\nmultiplication. He had passed over the plains where iron and coal\nsupersede turf and corn, dingy as the entrance of Hades, and flaming\nwith furnaces; and now he was among illumined factories with more\nwindows than Italian palaces, and smoking chimneys taller than Egyptian\nobelisks. Alone in the great metropolis of machinery itself, sitting\ndown in a solitary coffee-room glaring with gas, with no appetite, a\nwhirling head, and not a plan or purpose for the morrow, why was he\nthere? Because a being, whose name even was unknown to him, had met him\nin a hedge alehouse during a thunderstorm, and told him that the Age of\nRuins was past.\n\nRemarkable instance of the influence of an individual; some evidence of\nthe extreme susceptibility of our hero.\n\nEven his bedroom was lit by gas. Wonderful city! That, however, could be\ngot rid of. He opened the window. The summer air was sweet, even in this\nland of smoke and toil. He feels a sensation such as in Lisbon or Lima\nprecedes an earthquake. The house appears to quiver. It is a sympathetic\naffection occasioned by a steam-engine in a neighbouring factory.\n\nNotwithstanding, however, all these novel incidents, Coningsby slept the\ndeep sleep of youth and health, of a brain which, however occasionally\nperplexed by thought, had never been harassed by anxiety. He rose early,\nfreshened, and in fine spirits. And by the time the deviled chicken and\nthe buttered toast, that mysterious and incomparable luxury, which can\nonly be obtained at an inn, had disappeared, he felt all the delightful\nexcitement of travel.\n\nAnd now for action! Not a letter had Coningsby; not an individual in\nthat vast city was known to him. He went to consult his kind hostess,\nwho smiled confidence. He was to mention her name at one place, his\nown at another. All would be right; she seemed to have reliance in the\ndestiny of such a nice young man.\n\nHe saw all; they were kind and hospitable to the young stranger,\nwhose thought, and earnestness, and gentle manners attracted them. One\nrecommended him to another; all tried to aid and assist him. He entered\nchambers vaster than are told of in Arabian fable, and peopled with\nhabitants more wondrous than Afrite or Peri. For there he beheld, in\nlong-continued ranks, those mysterious forms full of existence without\nlife, that perform with facility, and in an instant, what man can fulfil\nonly with difficulty and in days. A machine is a slave that neither\nbrings nor bears degradation; it is a being endowed with the greatest\ndegree of energy, and acting under the greatest degree of excitement,\nyet free at the same time from all passion and emotion. It is,\ntherefore, not only a slave, but a supernatural slave. And why should\none say that the machine does not live? It breathes, for its breath\nforms the atmosphere of some towns. It moves with more regularity than\nman. And has it not a voice? Does not the spindle sing like a merry girl\nat her work, and the steam-engine roar in jolly chorus, like a strong\nartisan handling his lusty tools, and gaining a fair day's wages for a\nfair day's toil?\n\nNor should the weaving-room be forgotten, where a thousand or fifteen\nhundred girls may be observed in their coral necklaces, working like\nPenelope in the daytime; some pretty, some pert, some graceful and\njocund, some absorbed in their occupation; a little serious some, few\nsad. And the cotton you have observed in its rude state, that you have\nseen the silent spinner change into thread, and the bustling weaver\nconvert into cloth, you may now watch as in a moment it is tinted\nwith beautiful colours, or printed with fanciful patterns. And yet the\nmystery of mysteries is to view machines making machines; a spectacle\nthat fills the mind with curious, and even awful, speculation.\n\nFrom early morn to the late twilight, our Coningsby for several days\ndevoted himself to the comprehension of Manchester. It was to him a new\nworld, pregnant with new ideas, and suggestive of new trains of thought\nand feeling. In this unprecedented partnership between capital and\nscience, working on a spot which Nature had indicated as the fitting\ntheatre of their exploits, he beheld a great source of the wealth of\nnations which had been reserved for these times, and he perceived that\nthis wealth was rapidly developing classes whose power was imperfectly\nrecognised in the constitutional scheme, and whose duties in the social\nsystem seemed altogether omitted. Young as he was, the bent of his mind,\nand the inquisitive spirit of the times, had sufficiently prepared him,\nnot indeed to grapple with these questions, but to be sensible of their\nexistence, and to ponder.\n\nOne evening, in the coffee-room of the hotel, having just finished his\nwell-earned dinner, and relaxing his mind for the moment in a fresh\nresearch into the Manchester Guide, an individual, who had also been\ndining in the same apartment, rose from his table, and, after lolling\nover the empty fireplace, reading the framed announcements, looking\nat the directions of several letters waiting there for their owners,\npicking his teeth, turned round to Coningsby, and, with an air of uneasy\nfamiliarity, said,--\n\n'First visit to Manchester, sir?'\n\n'My first.'\n\n'Gentleman traveller, I presume?'\n\n'I am a traveller.' said Coningsby.\n\n'Hem! From south?'\n\n'From the south.'\n\n'And pray, sir, how did you find business as you came along? Brisk, I\ndare say. And yet there is a something, a sort of a something; didn't\nit strike you, sir, there was a something? A deal of queer paper about,\nsir!'\n\n'I fear you are speaking on a subject of which I know nothing,' said\nConingsby, smiling;' I do not understand business at all; though I am\nnot surprised that, being at Manchester, you should suppose so.'\n\n'Ah! not in business. Hem! Professional?'\n\n'No,' said Coningsby, 'I am nothing.'\n\n'Ah! an independent gent; hem! and a very pleasant thing, too. Pleased\nwith Manchester, I dare say?' continued the stranger.\n\n'And astonished,' said Coningsby; 'I think, in the whole course of my\nlife, I never saw so much to admire.'\n\n'Seen all the lions, have no doubt?'\n\n'I think I have seen everything,' said Coningsby, rather eager and with\nsome pride.\n\n'Very well, very well,' exclaimed the stranger, in a patronising tone.\n'Seen Mr. Birley's weaving-room, I dare say?'\n\n'Oh! isn't it wonderful?' said Coningsby.\n\n'A great many people.' said the stranger, with a rather supercilious\nsmile.\n\n'But after all,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'it is the machinery\nwithout any interposition of manual power that overwhelms me. It haunts\nme in my dreams,' continued Coningsby; 'I see cities peopled with\nmachines. Certainly Manchester is the most wonderful city of modern\ntimes!'\n\nThe stranger stared a little at the enthusiasm of his companion, and\nthen picked his teeth.\n\n'Of all the remarkable things here,' said Coningsby, 'what on the whole,\nsir, do you look upon as the most so?'\n\n'In the way of machinery?' asked the stranger.\n\n'In the way of machinery.'\n\n'Why, in the way of machinery, you know,' said the stranger, very\nquietly, 'Manchester is a dead letter.'\n\n'A dead letter!' said Coningsby.\n\n'Dead and buried,' said the stranger, accompanying his words with\nthat peculiar application of his thumb to his nose that signifies so\neloquently that all is up.\n\n'You astonish me!' said Coningsby.\n\n'It's a booked place though,' said the stranger, 'and no mistake. We\nhave all of us a very great respect for Manchester, of course; look upon\nher as a sort of mother, and all that sort of thing. But she is behind\nthe times, sir, and that won't do in this age. The long and short of it\nis, Manchester is gone by.'\n\n'I thought her only fault might be she was too much in advance of the\nrest of the country,' said Coningsby, innocently.\n\n'If you want to see life,' said the stranger, 'go to Staleybridge or\nBolton. There's high pressure.'\n\n'But the population of Manchester is increasing,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Why, yes; not a doubt. You see we have all of us a great respect for\nthe town. It is a sort of metropolis of this district, and there is\na good deal of capital in the place. And it has some firstrate\ninstitutions. There's the Manchester Bank. That's a noble institution,\nfull of commercial enterprise; understands the age, sir; high-pressure\nto the backbone. I came up to town to see the manager to-day. I am\nbuilding a new mill now myself at Staleybridge, and mean to open it by\nJanuary, and when I do, I'll give you leave to pay another visit to Mr.\nBirley's weaving-room, with my compliments.'\n\n'I am very sorry,' said Coningsby, 'that I have only another day left;\nbut pray tell me, what would you recommend me most to see within a\nreasonable distance of Manchester?'\n\n'My mill is not finished,' said the stranger musingly, 'and though there\nis still a great deal worth seeing at Staleybridge, still you had\nbetter wait to see my new mill. And Bolton, let me see; Bolton, there is\nnothing at Bolton that can hold up its head for a moment against my new\nmill; but then it is not finished. Well, well, let us see. What a pity\nthis is not the 1st of January, and then my new mill would be at work! I\nshould like to see Mr. Birley's face, or even Mr. Ashworth's, that day.\nAnd the Oxford Road Works, where they are always making a little change,\nbit by bit reform, eh! not a very particular fine appetite, I suspect,\nfor dinner, at the Oxford Road Works, the day they hear of my new mill\nbeing at work. But you want to see something tip-top. Well, there's\nMillbank; that's regular slap-up, quite a sight, regular lion; if I were\nyou I would see Millbank.'\n\n'Millbank!' said Coningsby; 'what Millbank?'\n\n'Millbank of Millbank, made the place, made it himself. About three\nmiles from Bolton; train to-morrow morning at 7.25, get a fly at the\nstation, and you will be at Millbank by 8.40.'\n\n'Unfortunately I am engaged to-morrow morning,' said Coningsby, 'and yet\nI am most anxious, particularly anxious, to see Millbank.'\n\n'Well, there's a late train,' said the stranger, '3.15; you will be\nthere by 4.30.'\n\n'I think I could manage that,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Do,' said the stranger; 'and if you ever find yourself at Staleybridge,\nI shall be very happy to be of service. I must be off now. My train goes\nat 9.15.' And he presented Coningsby with his card as he wished him good\nnight.\n\nMR. G. O. A. HEAD, STALEYBRIDGE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nIn a green valley of Lancaster, contiguous to that district of factories\non which we have already touched, a clear and powerful stream flows\nthrough a broad meadow land. Upon its margin, adorned, rather than\nshadowed, by some old elm-trees, for they are too distant to serve\nexcept for ornament, rises a vast deep red brick pile, which though\nformal and monotonous in its general character, is not without a\ncertain beauty of proportion and an artist-like finish in its occasional\nmasonry. The front, which is of great extent, and covered with many\ntiers of small windows, is flanked by two projecting wings in the same\nstyle, which form a large court, completed by a dwarf wall crowned\nwith a light, and rather elegant railing; in the centre, the principal\nentrance, a lofty portal of bold and beautiful design, surmounted by a\nstatue of Commerce.\n\nThis building, not without a degree of dignity, is what is technically,\nand not very felicitously, called a mill; always translated by the\nFrench in their accounts of our manufacturing riots, 'moulin;' and which\nreally was the principal factory of Oswald Millbank, the father of that\nyouth whom, we trust, our readers have not quite forgotten.\n\nAt some little distance, and rather withdrawn from the principal stream,\nwere two other smaller structures of the same style. About a quarter of\na mile further on, appeared a village of not inconsiderable size, and\nremarkable from the neatness and even picturesque character of its\narchitecture, and the gay gardens that surrounded it. On a sunny\nknoll in the background rose a church, in the best style of Christian\narchitecture, and near it was a clerical residence and a school-house\nof similar design. The village, too, could boast of another public\nbuilding; an Institute where there were a library and a lecture-room;\nand a reading-hall, which any one might frequent at certain hours, and\nunder reasonable regulations.\n\nOn the other side of the principal factory, but more remote, about\nhalf-a-mile up the valley, surrounded by beautiful meadows, and built\non an agreeable and well-wooded elevation, was the mansion of\nthe mill-owner; apparently a commodious and not inconsiderable\ndwelling-house, built in what is called a villa style, with a variety\nof gardens and conservatories. The atmosphere of this somewhat striking\nsettlement was not disturbed and polluted by the dark vapour, which,\nto the shame of Manchester, still infests that great town, for Mr.\nMillbank, who liked nothing so much as an invention, unless it were an\nexperiment, took care to consume his own smoke.\n\nThe sun was declining when Coningsby arrived at Millbank, and the\ngratification which he experienced on first beholding it, was not a\nlittle diminished, when, on enquiring at the village, he was informed\nthat the hour was past for seeing the works. Determined not to\nrelinquish his purpose without a struggle, he repaired to the principal\nmill, and entered the counting-house, which was situated in one of the\nwings of the building.\n\n'Your pleasure, sir?' said one of three individuals sitting on high\nstools behind a high desk.\n\n'I wish, if possible, to see the works.'\n\n'Quite impossible, sir;' and the clerk, withdrawing his glance,\ncontinued his writing. 'No admission without an order, and no admission\nwith an order after two o'clock.'\n\n'I am very unfortunate,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Sorry for it, sir. Give me ledger K. X., will you, Mr. Benson?'\n\n'I think Mr. Millbank would grant me permission,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Very likely, sir; to-morrow. Mr. Millbank is there, sir, but very much\nengaged.' He pointed to an inner counting-house, and the glass doors\npermitted Coningsby to observe several individuals in close converse.\n\n'Perhaps his son, Mr. Oswald Millbank, is here?' inquired Coningsby.\n\n'Mr. Oswald is in Belgium,' said the clerk.\n\n'Would you give a message to Mr. Millbank, and say a friend of his son's\nat Eton is here, and here only for a day, and wishes very much to see\nhis works?'\n\n'Can't possibly disturb Mr. Millbank now, sir; but, if you like to sit\ndown, you can wait and see him yourself.'\n\nConingsby was content to sit down, though he grew very impatient at the\nend of a quarter of an hour. The ticking of the clock, the scratching\nof the pens of the three silent clerks, irritated him. At length, voices\nwere heard, doors opened, and the clerk said, 'Mr. Millbank is coming,\nsir,' but nobody came; voices became hushed, doors were shut; again\nnothing was heard, save the ticking of the clock and the scratching of\nthe pen.\n\nAt length there was a general stir, and they all did come forth, Mr.\nMillbank among them, a well-proportioned, comely man, with a fair face\ninclining to ruddiness, a quick, glancing, hazel eye, the whitest teeth,\nand short, curly, chestnut hair, here and there slightly tinged with\ngrey. It was a visage of energy and decision.\n\nHe was about to pass through the counting-house with his companions,\nwith whom his affairs were not concluded, when he observed Coningsby,\nwho had risen.\n\n'This gentleman wishes to see me?' he inquired of his clerk, who bowed\nassent.\n\n'I shall be at your service, sir, the moment I have finished with these\ngentlemen.'\n\n'The gentleman wishes to see the works, sir,' said the clerk.\n\n'He can see the works at proper times,' said Mr. Millbank, somewhat\npettishly; 'tell him the regulations;' and he was about to go.\n\n'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Coningsby, coming forward, and with an\nair of earnestness and grace that arrested the step of the manufacturer.\n'I am aware of the regulations, but would beg to be permitted to\ninfringe them.'\n\n'It cannot be, sir,' said Mr. Millbank, moving.\n\n'I thought, sir, being here only for a day, and as a friend of your\nson--'\n\nMr. Millbank stopped and said,\n\n'Oh! a friend of Oswald's, eh? What, at Eton?'\n\n'Yes, sir, at Eton; and I had hoped perhaps to have found him here.'\n\n'I am very much engaged, sir, at this moment,' said Mr. Millbank; 'I am\nsorry I cannot pay you any personal attention, but my clerk will show\nyou everything. Mr. Benson, let this gentleman see everything;' and he\nwithdrew.\n\n'Be pleased to write your name here, sir,' said Mr. Benson, opening\na book, and our friend wrote his name and the date of his visit to\nMillbank:\n\n  'HARRY CONINGSBY, Sept. 2, 1836.'\n\nConingsby beheld in this great factory the last and the most refined\ninventions of mechanical genius. The building had been fitted up by a\ncapitalist as anxious to raise a monument of the skill and power of his\norder, as to obtain a return for the great investment.\n\n'It is the glory of Lancashire!' exclaimed the enthusiastic Mr. Benson.\n\nThe clerk spoke freely of his master, whom he evidently idolised, and\nhis great achievements, and Coningsby encouraged him. He detailed to\nConingsby the plans which Mr. Millbank had pursued, both for the moral\nand physical well-being of his people; how he had built churches,\nand schools, and institutes; houses and cottages on a new system of\nventilation; how he had allotted gardens; established singing classes.\n\n'Here is Mr. Millbank,' continued the clerk, as he and Coningsby,\nquitting the factory, re-entered the court.\n\nMr. Millbank was approaching the factory, and the moment that he\nobserved them, he quickened his pace.\n\n'Mr. Coningsby?' he said, when he reached them. His countenance was\nrather disturbed, and his voice a little trembled, and he looked on our\nfriend with a glance scrutinising and serious. Coningsby bowed.\n\n'I am sorry that you should have been received at this place with\nso little ceremony, sir,' said Mr. Millbank; 'but had your name been\nmentioned, you would have found it cherished here.' He nodded to the\nclerk, who disappeared.\n\nConingsby began to talk about the wonders of the factory, but Mr.\nMillbank recurred to other thoughts that were passing in his mind. He\nspoke of his son: he expressed a kind reproach that Coningsby should\nhave thought of visiting this part of the world without giving them\nsome notice of his intention, that he might have been their guest, that\nOswald might have been there to receive him, that they might have made\narrangements that he should see everything, and in the best manner; in\nshort, that they might all have shown, however slightly, the deep sense\nof their obligations to him.\n\n'My visit to Manchester, which led to this, was quite accidental,' said\nConingsby. 'I am bound for the other division of the county, to pay a\nvisit to my grandfather, Lord Monmouth; but an irresistible desire came\nover me during my journey to view this famous district of industry. It\nis some days since I ought to have found myself at Coningsby, and this\nis the reason why I am so pressed.'\n\nA cloud passed over the countenance of Millbank as the name of Lord\nMonmouth was mentioned, but he said nothing. Turning towards Coningsby,\nwith an air of kindness:\n\n'At least,' said he, 'let not Oswald hear that you did not taste our\nsalt. Pray dine with me to-day; there is yet an hour to dinner; and\nas you have seen the factory, suppose we stroll together through the\nvillage.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe village clock struck five as Mr. Millbank and his guest entered the\ngardens of his mansion. Coningsby lingered a moment to admire the beauty\nand gay profusion of the flowers.\n\n'Your situation,' said Coningsby, looking up the green and silent\nvalley, 'is absolutely poetic.'\n\n'I try sometimes to fancy,' said Mr. Millbank, with a rather fierce\nsmile, 'that I am in the New World.'\n\nThey entered the house; a capacious and classic hall, at the end a\nstaircase in the Italian fashion. As they approached it, the sweetest\nand the clearest voice exclaimed from above, 'Papa! papa!' and instantly\na young girl came bounding down the stairs, but suddenly seeing a\nstranger with her father she stopped upon the landing-place, and was\nevidently on the point of as rapidly retreating as she had advanced,\nwhen Mr. Millbank waved his hand to her and begged her to descend. She\ncame down slowly; as she approached them her father said, 'A friend you\nhave often heard of, Edith: this is Mr. Coningsby.'\n\nShe started; blushed very much; and then, with a trembling and uncertain\ngait, advanced, put forth her hand with a wild unstudied grace, and said\nin a tone of sensibility, 'How often have we all wished to see and to\nthank you!'\n\nThis daughter of his host was of tender years; apparently she could\nscarcely have counted sixteen summers. She was delicate and fragile, but\nas she raised her still blushing visage to her father's guest, Coningsby\nfelt that he had never beheld a countenance of such striking and such\npeculiar beauty.\n\n'My only daughter, Mr. Coningsby, Edith; a Saxon name, for she is the\ndaughter of a Saxon.'\n\nBut the beauty of the countenance was not the beauty of the Saxons. It\nwas a radiant face, one of those that seem to have been touched in\ntheir cradle by a sunbeam, and to have retained all their brilliancy and\nsuffused and mantling lustre. One marks sometimes such faces, diaphanous\nwith delicate splendour, in the southern regions of France. Her eye,\ntoo, was the rare eye of Aquitaine; soft and long, with lashes drooping\nover the cheek, dark as her clustering ringlets.\n\nThey entered the drawing-room.\n\n'Mr. Coningsby,' said Millbank to his daughter, 'is in this part of the\nworld only for a few hours, or I am sure he would become our guest. He\nhas, however, promised to stay with us now and dine.'\n\n'If Miss Millbank will pardon this dress,' said Coningsby, bowing an\napology for his inevitable frock and boots; the maiden raised her eyes\nand bent her head.\n\nThe hour of dinner was at hand. Millbank offered to show Coningsby to\nhis dressing-room. He was absent but a few minutes. When he returned he\nfound Miss Millbank alone. He came somewhat suddenly into the room. She\nwas playing with her dog, but ceased the moment she observed Coningsby.\n\nConingsby, who since his practice with Lady Everingham, flattered\nhimself that he had advanced in small talk, and was not sorry that\nhe had now an opportunity of proving his prowess, made some lively\nobservations about pets and the breeds of lapdogs, but he was not\nfortunate in extracting a response or exciting a repartee. He began then\non the beauty of Millbank, which he would on no account have avoided\nseeing, and inquired when she had last heard of her brother. The young\nlady, apparently much distressed, was murmuring something about Antwerp,\nwhen the entrance of her father relieved her from her embarrassment.\n\nDinner being announced, Coningsby offered his arm to his fair companion,\nwho took it with her eyes fixed on the ground.\n\n'You are very fond, I see, of flowers,' said Coningsby, as they moved\nalong; and the young lady said 'Yes.'\n\nThe dinner was plain, but perfect of its kind. The young hostess seemed\nto perform her office with a certain degree of desperate determination.\nShe looked at a chicken and then at Coningsby, and murmured something\nwhich he understood. Sometimes she informed herself of his tastes\nor necessities in more detail, by the medium of her father, whom she\ntreated as a sort of dragoman; in this way: 'Would not Mr. Coningsby,\npapa, take this or that, or do so and so?' Coningsby was always careful\nto reply in a direct manner, without the agency of the interpreter; but\nhe did not advance. Even a petition for the great honour of taking a\nglass of sherry with her only induced the beautiful face to bow. And yet\nwhen she had first seen him, she had addressed him even with emotion.\nWhat could it be? He felt less confidence in his increased power of\nconversation. Why, Theresa Sydney was scarcely a year older than\nMiss Millbank, and though she did not certainly originate like Lady\nEveringham, he got on with her perfectly well.\n\nMr. Millbank did not seem to be conscious of his daughter's silence:\nat any rate, he attempted to compensate for it. He talked fluently\nand well; on all subjects his opinions seemed to be decided, and his\nlanguage was precise. He was really interested in what Coningsby had\nseen, and what he had felt; and this sympathy divested his manner of the\ndisagreeable effect that accompanies a tone inclined to be dictatorial.\nMore than once Coningsby observed the silent daughter listening with\nextreme attention to the conversation of himself and her father.\n\nThe dessert was remarkable. Millbank was proud of his fruit. A bland\nexpression of self-complacency spread over his features as he surveyed\nhis grapes, his peaches, his figs.\n\n'These grapes have gained a medal,' he told Coningsby. 'Those too are\nprize peaches. I have not yet been so successful with my figs. These\nhowever promise, and perhaps this year I may be more fortunate.'\n\n'What would your brother and myself have given for such a dessert at\nEton!' said Coningsby to Miss Millbank, wishing to say something, and\nsomething too that might interest her.\n\nShe seemed infinitely distressed, and yet this time would speak.\n\n'Let me give you some,' He caught by chance her glance immediately\nwithdrawn; yet it was a glance not only of beauty, but of feeling\nand thought. She added, in a hushed and hurried tone, dividing very\nnervously some grapes, 'I hardly know whether Oswald will be most\npleased or grieved when he hears that you have been here.'\n\n'And why grieved?' said Coningsby.\n\n'That he should not have been here to welcome you, and that your stay is\nfor so brief a time. It seems so strange that after having talked of you\nfor years, we should see you only for hours.'\n\n'I hope I may return,' said Coningsby, 'and that Millbank may be here to\nwelcome me; but I hope I may be permitted to return even if he be not.'\n\nBut there was no reply; and soon after, Mr. Millbank talking of the\nAmerican market, and Coningsby helping himself to a glass of claret, the\ndaughter of the Saxon, looking at her father, rose and left the room, so\nsuddenly and so quickly that Coningsby could scarcely gain the door.\n\n'Yes,' said Millbank, filling his glass, and pursuing some previous\nobservations, 'all that we want in this country is to be masters of our\nown industry; but Saxon industry and Norman manners never will agree;\nand some day, Mr. Coningsby, you will find that out.'\n\n'But what do you mean by Norman manners?' inquired Coningsby.\n\n'Did you ever hear of the Forest of Rossendale?' said Millbank. 'If\nyou were staying here, you should visit the district. It is an area of\ntwenty-four square miles. It was disforested in the early part of the\nsixteenth century, possessing at that time eighty inhabitants.\nIts rental in James the First's time was 120_l._ When the woollen\nmanufacture was introduced into the north, the shuttle competed with the\nplough in Rossendale, and about forty years ago we sent them the Jenny.\nThe eighty souls are now increased to upwards of eighty thousand, and\nthe rental of the forest, by the last county assessment, amounts to more\nthan 50,000_l._, 41,000 per cent, on the value in the reign of James\nI. Now I call that an instance of Saxon industry competing successfully\nwith Norman manners.'\n\n'Exactly,' said Coningsby, 'but those manners are gone.'\n\n'From Rossendale, 'said Millbank, with a grim smile; 'but not from\nEngland.'\n\n'Where do you meet them?'\n\n'Meet them! In every place, at every hour; and feel them, too, in every\ntransaction of life.'\n\n'I know, sir, from your son,' said Coningsby, inquiringly, 'that you are\nopposed to an aristocracy.'\n\n'No, I am not. I am for an aristocracy; but a real one, a natural one.'\n\n'But, sir, is not the aristocracy of England,' said Coningsby, 'a real\none? You do not confound our peerage, for example, with the degraded\npatricians of the Continent.'\n\n'Hum!' said Millbank. 'I do not understand how an aristocracy can exist,\nunless it be distinguished by some quality which no other class of the\ncommunity possesses. Distinction is the basis of aristocracy. If you\npermit only one class of the population, for example, to bear arms, they\nare an aristocracy; not one much to my taste; but still a great fact.\nThat, however, is not the characteristic of the English peerage. I have\nyet to learn they are richer than we are, better informed, wiser, or\nmore distinguished for public or private virtue. Is it not monstrous,\nthen, that a small number of men, several of whom take the titles of\nDuke and Earl from towns in this very neighbourhood, towns which they\nnever saw, which never heard of them, which they did not form, or\nbuild, or establish, I say, is it not monstrous, that individuals\nso circumstanced, should be invested with the highest of conceivable\nprivileges, the privilege of making laws? Dukes and Earls indeed! I say\nthere is nothing in a masquerade more ridiculous.'\n\n'But do you not argue from an exception, sir?' said Coningsby. 'The\nquestion is, whether a preponderance of the aristocratic principle in a\npolitical constitution be, as I believe, conducive to the stability and\npermanent power of a State; and whether the peerage, as established\nin England, generally tends to that end? We must not forget in such an\nestimate the influence which, in this country, is exercised over opinion\nby ancient lineage.'\n\n'Ancient lineage!' said Mr. Millbank; 'I never heard of a peer with an\nancient lineage. The real old families of this country are to be found\namong the peasantry; the gentry, too, may lay some claim to old blood.\nI can point you out Saxon families in this county who can trace their\npedigrees beyond the Conquest; I know of some Norman gentlemen whose\nfathers undoubtedly came over with the Conqueror. But a peer with an\nancient lineage is to me quite a novelty. No, no; the thirty years of\nthe wars of the Roses freed us from those gentlemen. I take it, after\nthe battle of Tewkesbury, a Norman baron was almost as rare a being in\nEngland as a wolf is now.'\n\n'I have always understood,' said Coningsby, 'that our peerage was the\nfinest in Europe.'\n\n'From themselves,' said Millbank, 'and the heralds they pay to paint\ntheir carriages. But I go to facts. When Henry VII. called his first\nParliament, there were only twenty-nine temporal peers to be found,\nand even some of them took their seats illegally, for they had been\nattainted. Of those twenty-nine not five remain, and they, as the\nHowards for instance, are not Norman nobility. We owe the English\npeerage to three sources: the spoliation of the Church; the open\nand flagrant sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts; and the\nboroughmongering of our own times. Those are the three main sources of\nthe existing peerage of England, and in my opinion disgraceful ones. But\nI must apologise for my frankness in thus speaking to an aristocrat.'\n\n'Oh, by no means, sir, I like discussion. Your son and myself at Eton\nhave had some encounters of this kind before. But if your view of the\ncase be correct,' added Coningsby, smiling, 'you cannot at any rate\naccuse our present peers of Norman manners.'\n\n'Yes, I do: they adopted Norman manners while they usurped Norman\ntitles. They have neither the right of the Normans, nor do they fulfil\nthe duty of the Normans: they did not conquer the land, and they do not\ndefend it.'\n\n'And where will you find your natural aristocracy?' asked Coningsby.\n\n'Among those men whom a nation recognises as the most eminent for\nvirtue, talents, and property, and, if you please, birth and standing\nin the land. They guide opinion; and, therefore, they govern. I am no\nleveller; I look upon an artificial equality as equally pernicious with\na factitious aristocracy; both depressing the energies, and checking the\nenterprise of a nation. I like man to be free, really free: free in his\nindustry as well as his body. What is the use of Habeas Corpus, if a man\nmay not use his hands when he is out of prison?'\n\n'But it appears to me you have, in a great measure, this natural\naristocracy in England.'\n\n'Ah, to be sure! If we had not, where should we be? It is the\ncounteracting power that saves us, the disturbing cause in the\ncalculations of short-sighted selfishness. I say it now, and I have said\nit a hundred times, the House of Commons is a more aristocratic body\nthan the House of Lords. The fact is, a great peer would be a greater\nman now in the House of Commons than in the House of Lords. Nobody\nwants a second chamber, except a few disreputable individuals. It is\na valuable institution for any member of it who has no distinction,\nneither character, talents, nor estate. But a peer who possesses all or\nany of these great qualifications, would find himself an immeasurably\nmore important personage in what, by way of jest, they call the Lower\nHouse.'\n\n'Is not the revising wisdom of a senate a salutary check on the\nprecipitation of a popular assembly?'\n\n'Why should a popular assembly, elected by the flower of a nation,\nbe precipitate? If precipitate, what senate could stay an assembly so\nchosen? No, no, no! the thing has been tried over and over again;\nthe idea of restraining the powerful by the weak is an absurdity; the\nquestion is settled. If we wanted a fresh illustration, we need only\nlook to the present state of our own House of Lords. It originates\nnothing; it has, in fact, announced itself as a mere Court of\nRegistration of the decrees of your House of Commons; and if by any\nchance it ventures to alter some miserable detail in a clause of a bill\nthat excites public interest, what a clatter through the country, at\nConservative banquets got up by the rural attorneys, about the power,\nauthority, and independence of the House of Lords; nine times nine, and\none cheer more! No, sir, you may make aristocracies by laws; you can\nonly maintain them by manners. The manners of England preserve it\nfrom its laws. And they have substituted for our formal aristocracy an\nessential aristocracy; the government of those who are distinguished by\ntheir fellow-citizens.'\n\n'But then it would appear,' said Coningsby, 'that the remedial action of\nour manners has removed all the political and social evils of which you\ncomplain?'\n\n'They have created a power that may remove them; a power that has the\ncapacity to remove them. But in a great measure they still exist, and\nmust exist yet, I fear, for a long time. The growth of our civilisation\nhas ever been as slow as our oaks; but this tardy development is\npreferable to the temporary expansion of the gourd.'\n\n'The future seems to me sometimes a dark cloud.'\n\n'Not to me,' said Mr. Millbank. 'I am sanguine; I am the Disciple of\nProgress. But I have cause for my faith. I have witnessed advance. My\nfather has often told me that in his early days the displeasure of\na peer of England was like a sentence of death to a man. Why it was\nesteemed a great concession to public opinion, so late as the reign of\nGeorge II., that Lord Ferrars should be executed for murder. The king of\na new dynasty, who wished to be popular with the people, insisted on\nit, and even then he was hanged with a silken cord. At any rate we\nmay defend ourselves now,' continued Mr. Millbank, 'and, perhaps, do\nsomething more. I defy any peer to crush me, though there is one who\nwould be very glad to do it. No more of that; I am very happy to see you\nat Millbank, very happy to make your acquaintance,' he continued, with\nsome emotion, 'and not merely because you are my son's friend and more\nthan friend.'\n\nThe walls of the dining-room were covered with pictures of great merit,\nall of the modern English school. Mr. Millbank understood no other, he\nwas wont to say! and he found that many of his friends who did, bought\na great many pleasing pictures that were copies, and many originals that\nwere very displeasing. He loved a fine free landscape by Lee, that gave\nhim the broad plains, the green lanes, and running streams of his own\nland; a group of animals by Landseer, as full of speech and sentiment as\nif they were designed by Aesop; above all, he delighted in the household\nhumour and homely pathos of Wilkie. And if a higher tone of imagination\npleased him, he could gratify it without difficulty among his favourite\nmasters. He possessed some specimens of Etty worthy of Venice when\nit was alive; he could muse amid the twilight ruins of ancient cities\nraised by the magic pencil of Danby, or accompany a group of fair\nNeapolitans to a festival by the genial aid of Uwins.\n\nOpposite Coningsby was a portrait, which had greatly attracted his\nattention during the whole dinner. It represented a woman, young and of\na rare beauty. The costume was of that classical character prevalent in\nthis country before the general peace; a blue ribbon bound together as\na fillet her clustering chestnut curls. The face was looking out of the\ncanvas, and Coningsby never raised his eyes without catching its glance\nof blended vivacity and tenderness.\n\nThere are moments when our sensibility is affected by circumstances of\na trivial character. It seems a fantastic emotion, but the gaze of this\npicture disturbed the serenity of Coningsby. He endeavoured sometimes to\navoid looking at it, but it irresistibly attracted him. More than once\nduring dinner he longed to inquire whom it represented; but it is a\ndelicate subject to ask questions about portraits, and he refrained.\nStill, when he was rising to leave the room, the impulse was\nirresistible. He said to Mr. Millbank, 'By whom is that portrait, sir?'\n\nThe countenance of Millbank became disturbed; it was not an expression\nof tender reminiscence that fell upon his features. On the contrary, the\nexpression was agitated, almost angry.\n\n'Oh! that is by a country artist,' he said,' of whom you never heard,'\nand moved away.\n\nThey found Miss Millbank in the drawing-room; she was sitting at a round\ntable covered with working materials, apparently dressing a doll.\n\n'Nay,' thought Coningsby, 'she must be too old for that.'\n\nHe addressed her, and seated himself by her side. There were several\ndolls on the table, but he discovered, on examination, that they were\npincushions; and elicited, with some difficulty, that they were making\nfor a fancy fair about to be held in aid of that excellent institution,\nthe Manchester Athenaeum. Then the father came up and said,\n\n'My child, let us have some tea;' and she rose and seated herself at the\ntea-table. Coningsby also quitted his seat, and surveyed the apartment.\n\nThere were several musical instruments; among others, he observed a\nguitar; not such an instrument as one buys in a music shop, but such an\none as tinkles at Seville, a genuine Spanish guitar. Coningsby repaired\nto the tea-table.\n\n'I am glad that you are fond of music, Miss Millbank.'\n\nA blush and a bow.\n\n'I hope after tea you will be so kind as to touch the guitar.'\n\nSignals of great distress.\n\n'Were you ever at Birmingham?'\n\n'Yes:' a sigh.\n\n'What a splendid music-hall! They should build one at Manchester.'\n\n'They ought,' in a whisper.\n\nThe tea-tray was removed; Coningsby was conversing with Mr. Millbank,\nwho was asking him questions about his son; what he thought of Oxford;\nwhat he thought of Oriel; should himself have preferred Cambridge; but\nhad consulted a friend, an Oriel man, who had a great opinion of Oriel;\nand Oswald's name had been entered some years back. He rather regretted\nit now; but the thing was done. Coningsby, remembering the promise of\nthe guitar, turned round to claim its fulfilment, but the singer\nhad made her escape. Time elapsed, and no Miss Millbank reappeared.\nConingsby looked at his watch; he had to go three miles to the train,\nwhich started, as his friend of the previous night would phrase it, at\n9.45.\n\n'I should be happy if you remained with us,' said Mr. Millbank; 'but as\nyou say it is out of your power, in this age of punctual travelling\na host is bound to speed the parting guest. The carriage is ready for\nyou.'\n\n'Farewell, then, sir. You must make my adieux to Miss Millbank, and\naccept my thanks for your great kindness.'\n\n'Farewell, Mr. Coningsby,' said his host, taking his hand, which he\nretained for a moment, as if he would say more. Then leaving it, he\nrepeated with a somewhat wandering air, and in a voice of emotion,\n'Farewell, farewell, Mr. Coningsby.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nTowards the end of the session of 1836, the hopes of the Conservative\nparty were again in the ascendant. The Tadpoles and the Tapers had\ninfused such enthusiasm into all the country attorneys, who, in their\nturn, had so bedeviled the registration, that it was whispered in the\nutmost confidence, but as a flagrant truth, that Reaction was at length\n'a great fact.' All that was required was the opportunity; but as the\nexisting parliament was not two years old, and the government had an\nexcellent working majority, it seemed that the occasion could scarcely\nbe furnished. Under these circumstances, the backstairs politicians,\nnot content with having by their premature movements already seriously\ndamaged the career of their leader, to whom in public they pretended to\nbe devoted, began weaving again their old intrigues about the court, and\nnot without effect.\n\nIt was said that the royal ear lent itself with no marked repugnance to\nsuggestions which might rid the sovereign of ministers, who, after all,\nwere the ministers not of his choice, but of his necessity. But William\nIV., after two failures in a similar attempt, after his respective\nembarrassing interviews with Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne, on their\nreturn to office in 1832 and 1835, was resolved never to make another\nmove unless it were a checkmate. The king, therefore, listened and\nsmiled, and loved to talk to his favourites of his private feelings and\nsecret hopes; the first outraged, the second cherished; and a little of\nthese revelations of royalty was distilled to great personages, who\nin their turn spoke hypothetically to their hangers-on of royal\ndispositions, and possible contingencies, while the hangers-on and\ngo-betweens, in their turn, looked more than they expressed; took\ncounty members by the button into a corner, and advised, as friends, the\nrepresentatives of boroughs to look sharply after the next registration.\n\nLord Monmouth, who was never greater than in adversity, and whose\nfavourite excitement was to aim at the impossible, had never been more\nresolved on a Dukedom than when the Reform Act deprived him of the\ntwelve votes which he had accumulated to attain that object. While\nall his companions in discomfiture were bewailing their irretrievable\noverthrow, Lord Monmouth became almost a convert to the measure, which\nhad furnished his devising and daring mind, palled with prosperity, and\nsatiated with a life of success, with an object, and the stimulating\nenjoyment of a difficulty.\n\nHe had early resolved to appropriate to himself a division of the county\nin which his chief seat was situate; but what most interested him,\nbecause it was most difficult, was the acquisition of one of the\nnew boroughs that was in his vicinity, and in which he possessed\nconsiderable property. The borough, however, was a manufacturing town,\nand returning only one member, it had hitherto sent up to Westminster a\nradical shopkeeper, one Mr. Jawster Sharp, who had taken what is called\n'a leading part' in the town on every 'crisis' that had occurred since\n1830; one of those zealous patriots who had got up penny subscriptions\nfor gold cups to Lord Grey; cries for the bill, the whole bill, and\nnothing but the bill; and public dinners where the victual was devoured\nbefore grace was said; a worthy who makes speeches, passes resolutions,\nvotes addresses, goes up with deputations, has at all times the\nnecessary quantity of confidence in the necessary individual; confidence\nin Lord Grey; confidence in Lord Durham; confidence in Lord Melbourne:\nand can also, if necessary, give three cheers for the King, or three\ngroans for the Queen.\n\nBut the days of the genus Jawster Sharp were over in this borough as\nwell as in many others. He had contrived in his lustre of agitation\nto feather his nest pretty successfully; by which he had lost public\nconfidence and gained his private end. Three hungry Jawster Sharps,\nhis hopeful sons, had all become commissioners of one thing or another;\ntemporary appointments with interminable duties; a low-church son-in-law\nfound himself comfortably seated in a chancellor's living; and several\ncousins and nephews were busy in the Excise. But Jawster Sharp himself\nwas as pure as Cato. He had always said he would never touch the public\nmoney, and he had kept his word. It was an understood thing that Jawster\nSharp was never to show his face again on the hustings of Darlford; the\nLiberal party was determined to be represented in future by a man of\nstation, substance, character, a true Reformer, but one who wanted\nnothing for himself, and therefore might, if needful, get something for\nthem. They were looking out for such a man, but were in no hurry. The\nseat was looked upon as a good thing; a contest certainly, every place\nis contested now, but as certainly a large majority. Notwithstanding\nall this confidence, however, Reaction or Registration, or some other\nmystification, had produced effects even in this creature of the Reform\nBill, the good Borough of Darlford. The borough that out of gratitude\nto Lord Grey returned a jobbing shopkeeper twice to Parliament as its\nrepresentative without a contest, had now a Conservative Association,\nwith a banker for its chairman, and a brewer for its vice-president, and\nfour sharp lawyers nibbing their pens, noting their memorandum-books,\nand assuring their neighbours, with a consoling and complacent air, that\n'Property must tell in the long run.' Whispers also were about, that\nwhen the proper time arrived, a Conservative candidate would certainly\nhave the honour of addressing the electors. No name mentioned, but it\nwas not concealed that he was to be of no ordinary calibre; a tried man,\na distinguished individual, who had already fought the battle of the\nconstitution, and served his country in eminent posts; honoured by\nthe nation, favoured by his sovereign. These important and encouraging\nintimations were ably diffused in the columns of the Conservative\njournal, and in a style which, from its high tone, evidently\nindicated no ordinary source and no common pen. Indeed, there appeared\noccasionally in this paper, articles written with such unusual vigour,\nthat the proprietors of the Liberal journal almost felt the necessity\nof getting some eminent hand down from town to compete with them. It was\nimpossible that they could emanate from the rival Editor. They knew well\nthe length of their brother's tether. Had they been more versant in the\nperiodical literature of the day, they might in this 'slashing' style\nhave caught perhaps a glimpse of the future candidate for their borough,\nthe Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby.\n\nLord Monmouth, though he had been absent from England since 1832, had\nobtained from his vigilant correspondent a current knowledge of all that\nhad occurred in the interval: all the hopes, fears, plans, prospects,\nmanoeuvres, and machinations; their rise and fall; how some had bloomed,\nothers were blighted; not a shade of reaction that was not represented\nto him; not the possibility of an adhesion that was not duly reported;\nhe could calculate at Naples at any time, within ten, the result of a\ndissolution. The season of the year had prevented him crossing the Alps\nin 1834, and after the general election he was too shrewd a practiser\nin the political world to be deceived as to the ultimate result. Lord\nEskdale, in whose judgment he had more confidence than in that of any\nindividual, had told him from the first that the pear was not ripe;\nRigby, who always hedged against his interest by the fulfilment of his\nprophecy of irremediable discomfiture, was never very sanguine. Indeed,\nthe whole affair was always considered premature by the good judges;\nand a long time elapsed before Tadpole and Taper recovered their secret\ninfluence, or resumed their ostentatious loquacity, or their silent\ninsolence.\n\nThe pear, however, was now ripe. Even Lord Eskdale wrote that after\nthe forthcoming registration a bet was safe, and Lord Monmouth had the\nsatisfaction of drawing the Whig Minister at Naples into a cool thousand\non the event. Soon after this he returned to England, and determined\nto pay a visit to Coningsby Castle, feast the county, patronise the\nborough, diffuse that confidence in the party which his presence never\nfailed to do; so great and so just was the reliance in his unerring\npowers of calculation and his intrepid pluck. Notwithstanding Schedule\nA, the prestige of his power had not sensibly diminished, for his\nessential resources were vast, and his intellect always made the most of\nhis influence.\n\nTrue, however, to his organisation, Lord Monmouth, even to save his\nparty and gain his dukedom, must not be bored. He, therefore, filled his\ncastle with the most agreeable people from London, and even secured for\ntheir diversion a little troop of French comedians. Thus supported, he\nreceived his neighbours with all the splendour befitting his immense\nwealth and great position, and with one charm which even immense wealth\nand great position cannot command, the most perfect manner in the world.\nIndeed, Lord Monmouth was one of the most finished gentlemen that\never lived; and as he was good-natured, and for a selfish man even\ngood-humoured, there was rarely a cloud of caprice or ill-temper to\nprevent his fine manners having their fair play. The country neighbours\nwere all fascinated; they were received with so much dignity and\ndismissed with so much grace. Nobody would believe a word of the stories\nagainst him. Had he lived all his life at Coningsby, fulfilled every\nduty of a great English nobleman, benefited the county, loaded the\ninhabitants with favours, he would not have been half so popular as he\nfound himself within a fortnight of his arrival with the worst county\nreputation conceivable, and every little squire vowing that he would not\neven leave his name at the Castle to show his respect.\n\nLord Monmouth, whose contempt for mankind was absolute; not a\nfluctuating sentiment, not a mournful conviction, ebbing and flowing\nwith circumstances, but a fixed, profound, unalterable instinct; who\nnever loved any one, and never hated any one except his own children;\nwas diverted by his popularity, but he was also gratified by it. At\nthis moment it was a great element of power; he was proud that, with a\nvicious character, after having treated these people with unprecedented\nneglect and contumely, he should have won back their golden opinions\nin a moment by the magic of manner and the splendour of wealth. His\nexperience proved the soundness of his philosophy.\n\nLord Monmouth worshipped gold, though, if necessary, he could squander\nit like a caliph. He had even a respect for very rich men; it was his\nonly weakness, the only exception to his general scorn for his species.\nWit, power, particular friendships, general popularity, public opinion,\nbeauty, genius, virtue, all these are to be purchased; but it does not\nfollow that you can buy a rich man: you may not be able or willing to\nspare enough. A person or a thing that you perhaps could not buy, became\ninvested, in the eyes of Lord Monmouth, with a kind of halo amounting\nalmost to sanctity.\n\nAs the prey rose to the bait, Lord Monmouth resolved they should be\ngorged. His banquets were doubled; a ball was announced; a public\nday fixed; not only the county, but the principal inhabitants of the\nneighbouring borough, were encouraged to attend; Lord Monmouth wished\nit, if possible, to be without distinction of party. He had come to\nreside among his old friends, to live and die where he was born.\nThe Chairman of the Conservative Association and the Vice President\nexchanged glances, which would have become Tadpole and Taper; the\nfour attorneys nibbed their pens with increased energy, and vowed that\nnothing could withstand the influence of the aristocracy 'in the long\nrun.' All went and dined at the Castle; all returned home overpowered\nby the condescension of the host, the beauty of the ladies, several real\nPrincesses, the splendour of his liveries, the variety of his viands,\nand the flavour of his wines. It was agreed that at future meetings of\nthe Conservative Association, they should always give 'Lord Monmouth\nand the House of Lords!' superseding the Duke of Wellington, who was to\nfigure in an after-toast with the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nIt was not without emotion that Coningsby beheld for the first time the\ncastle that bore his name. It was visible for several miles before he\neven entered the park, so proud and prominent was its position, on the\nrichly-wooded steep of a considerable eminence. It was a castellated\nbuilding, immense and magnificent, in a faulty and incongruous style\nof architecture, indeed, but compensating in some degree for these\ndeficiencies of external taste and beauty by the splendour and\naccommodation of its exterior, and which a Gothic castle, raised\naccording to the strict rules of art, could scarcely have afforded. The\ndeclining sun threw over the pile a rich colour as Coningsby approached\nit, and lit up with fleeting and fanciful tints the delicate foliage of\nthe rare shrubs and tall thin trees that clothed the acclivity on which\nit stood. Our young friend felt a little embarrassed when, without a\nservant and in a hack chaise, he drew up to the grand portal, and\na crowd of retainers came forth to receive him. A superior servant\ninquired his name with a stately composure that disdained to be\nsupercilious. It was not without some degree of pride and satisfaction\nthat the guest replied, 'Mr. Coningsby.' The instantaneous effect was\nmagical. It seemed to Coningsby that he was borne on the shoulders\nof the people to his apartment; each tried to carry some part of his\nluggage; and he only hoped his welcome from their superiors might be as\nhearty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nIt appeared to Coningsby in his way to his room, that the Castle was in\na state of great excitement; everywhere bustle, preparation, moving to\nand fro, ascending and descending of stairs, servants in every\ncorner; orders boundlessly given, rapidly obeyed; many desires, equal\ngratification. All this made him rather nervous. It was quite unlike\nBeaumanoir. That also was a palace, but it was a home. This, though it\nshould be one to him, seemed to have nothing of that character. Of\nall mysteries the social mysteries are the most appalling. Going to\nan assembly for the first time is more alarming than the first battle.\nConingsby had never before been in a great house full of company. It\nseemed an overwhelming affair. The sight of the servants bewildered him;\nhow then was he to encounter their masters?\n\nThat, however, he must do in a moment. A groom of the chambers indicates\nthe way to him, as he proceeds with a hesitating yet hurried step\nthrough several ante-chambers and drawing-rooms; then doors are suddenly\nthrown open, and he is ushered into the largest and most sumptuous\nsaloon that he had ever entered. It was full of ladies and gentlemen.\nConingsby for the first time in his life was at a great party. His\nimmediate emotion was to sink into the earth; but perceiving that no\none even noticed him, and that not an eye had been attracted to his\nentrance, he regained his breath and in some degree his composure, and\nstanding aside, endeavoured to make himself, as well as he could, master\nof the land.\n\nNot a human being that he had ever seen before! The circumstance of not\nbeing noticed, which a few minutes since he had felt as a relief, became\nnow a cause of annoyance. It seemed that he was the only person standing\nalone whom no one was addressing. He felt renewed and aggravated\nembarrassment, and fancied, perhaps was conscious, that he was blushing.\nAt length his ear caught the voice of Mr. Rigby. The speaker was not\nvisible; he was at a distance surrounded by a wondering group, whom he\nwas severally and collectively contradicting, but Coningsby could not\nmistake those harsh, arrogant tones. He was not sorry indeed that Mr.\nRigby did not observe him. Coningsby never loved him particularly, which\nwas rather ungrateful, for he was a person who had been kind, and, on\nthe whole, serviceable to him; but Coningsby writhed, especially as he\ngrew older, under Mr. Rigby's patronising air and paternal tone. Even in\nold days, though attentive, Coningsby had never found him affectionate.\nMr. Rigby would tell him what to do and see, but never asked him what\nhe wished to do and see. It seemed to Coningsby that it was always\ncontrived that he should appear the _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_, or poor relation, of a\ndependent of his family. These feelings, which the thought of Mr. Rigby\nhad revived, caused our young friend, by an inevitable association of\nideas, to remember that, unknown and unnoticed as he might be, he was\nthe only Coningsby in that proud Castle, except the Lord of the Castle\nhimself; and he began to be rather ashamed of permitting a sense of his\ninexperience in the mere forms and fashions of society so to oppress\nhim, and deprive him, as it were, of the spirit and carriage which\nbecame alike his character and his position. Emboldened and greatly\nrestored to himself, Coningsby advanced into the body of the saloon.\n\nOn his legs, wearing his blue ribbon and bending his head frequently\nto a lady who was seated on a sofa, and continually addressed him,\nConingsby recognised his grandfather. Lord Monmouth was somewhat balder\nthan four years ago, when he had come down to Montem, and a little\nmore portly perhaps; but otherwise unchanged. Lord Monmouth\nnever condescended to the artifices of the toilet, and, indeed,\nnotwithstanding his life of excess, had little need of them. Nature had\ndone much for him, and the slow progress of decay was carried off by his\nconsummate bearing. He looked, indeed, the chieftain of a house of whom\na cadet might be proud.\n\nFor Coningsby, not only the chief of his house, but his host too. In\neither capacity he ought to address Lord Monmouth. To sit down to dinner\nwithout having previously paid his respects to his grandfather, to whom\nhe was so much indebted, and whom he had not seen for so many years,\nstruck him not only as uncourtly, but as unkind and ungrateful, and,\nindeed, in the highest degree absurd. But how was he to do it? Lord\nMonmouth seemed deeply engaged, and apparently with some very great\nlady. And if Coningsby advanced and bowed, in all probability he would\nonly get a bow in return. He remembered the bow of his first interview.\nIt had made a lasting impression on his mind. For it was more than\nlikely Lord Monmouth would not recognise him. Four years had not\nsensibly altered Lord Monmouth, but four years had changed Harry\nConingsby from a schoolboy into a man. Then how was he to make himself\nknown to his grandfather? To announce himself as Coningsby, as his\nLordship's grandson, seemed somewhat ridiculous: to address his\ngrandfather as Lord Monmouth would serve no purpose: to style Lord\nMonmouth 'grandfather' would make every one laugh, and seem stiff and\nunnatural. What was he to do? To fall into an attitude and exclaim,\n'Behold your grandchild!' or, 'Have you forgotten your Harry?'\n\nEven to catch Lord Monmouth's glance was not an easy affair; he was\nmuch occupied on one side by the great lady, on the other were several\ngentlemen who occasionally joined in the conversation. But something\nmust be done.\n\nThere ran through Coningsby's character, as we have before mentioned, a\nvein of simplicity which was not its least charm. It resulted, no doubt,\nin a great degree from the earnestness of his nature. There never was a\nboy so totally devoid of affectation, which was remarkable, for he had a\nbrilliant imagination, a quality that, from its fantasies, and the\nvague and indefinite desires it engenders, generally makes those whose\ncharacters are not formed, affected. The Duchess, who was a fine judge\nof character, and who greatly regarded Coningsby, often mentioned this\ntrait as one which, combined with his great abilities and acquirements\nso unusual at his age, rendered him very interesting. In the present\ninstance it happened that, while Coningsby was watching his grandfather,\nhe observed a gentleman advance, make his bow, say and receive a few\nwords and retire. This little incident, however, made a momentary\ndiversion in the immediate circle of Lord Monmouth, and before they\ncould all resume their former talk and fall into their previous\npositions, an impulse sent forth Coningsby, who walked up to Lord\nMonmouth, and standing before him, said,\n\n'How do you do, grandpapa?'\n\nLord Monmouth beheld his grandson. His comprehensive and penetrating\nglance took in every point with a flash. There stood before him one of\nthe handsomest youths he had ever seen, with a mien as graceful as his\ncountenance was captivating; and his whole air breathing that freshness\nand ingenuousness which none so much appreciates as the used man of the\nworld. And this was his child; the only one of his blood to whom he had\nbeen kind. It would be exaggeration to say that Lord Monmouth's heart\nwas touched; but his goodnature effervesced, and his fine taste was\ndeeply gratified. He perceived in an instant such a relation might be\na valuable adherent; an irresistible candidate for future elections: a\nbrilliant tool to work out the Dukedom. All these impressions and ideas,\nand many more, passed through the quick brain of Lord Monmouth ere the\nsound of Coningsby's words had seemed to cease, and long before the\nsurrounding guests had recovered from the surprise which they had\noccasioned them, and which did not diminish, when Lord Monmouth,\nadvancing, placed his arms round Coningsby with a dignity of affection\nthat would have become Louis XIV., and then, in the high manner of the\nold Court, kissed him on each cheek.\n\n'Welcome to your home,' said Lord Monmouth. 'You have grown a great\ndeal.'\n\nThen Lord Monmouth led the agitated Coningsby to the great lady, who was\na Princess and an Ambassadress, and then, placing his arm gracefully in\nthat of his grandson, he led him across the room, and presented him\nin due form to some royal blood that was his guest, in the shape of\na Russian Grand-duke. His Imperial Highness received our hero as\ngraciously as the grandson of Lord Monmouth might expect; but no\ngreeting can be imagined warmer than the one he received from the lady\nwith whom the Grand-duke was conversing. She was a dame whose beauty was\nmature, but still radiant. Her figure was superb; her dark hair crowned\nwith a tiara of curious workmanship. Her rounded arm was covered with\ncostly bracelets, but not a jewel on her finely formed bust, and the\nleast possible rouge on her still oval cheek. Madame Colonna retained\nher charms.\n\nThe party, though so considerable, principally consisted of the guests\nat the Castle. The suite of the Grand-duke included several counts and\ngenerals; then there were the Russian Ambassador and his lady; and a\nRussian Prince and Princess, their relations. The Prince and Princess\nColonna and the Princess Lucretia were also paying a visit to the\nMarquess; and the frequency of these visits made some straight-laced\nmagnificoes mysteriously declare it was impossible to go to Coningsby;\nbut as they were not asked, it did not much signify. The Marquess knew\na great many very agreeable people of the highest _ton_, who took a more\nliberal view of human conduct, and always made it a rule to presume the\nbest motives instead of imputing the worst. There was Lady St. Julians,\nfor example, whose position was of the highest; no one more sought; she\nmade it a rule to go everywhere and visit everybody, provided they had\npower, wealth, and fashion. She knew no crime except a woman not\nliving with her husband; that was past pardon. So long as his presence\nsanctioned her conduct, however shameless, it did not signify; but if\nthe husband were a brute, neglected his wife first, and then deserted\nher; then, if a breath but sullies her name she must be crushed; unless,\nindeed, her own family were very powerful, which makes a difference, and\nsometimes softens immorality into indiscretion.\n\nLord and Lady Gaverstock were also there, who never said an unkind thing\nof anybody; her ladyship was pure as snow; but her mother having been\ndivorced, she ever fancied she was paying a kind of homage to her\nparent, by visiting those who might some day be in the same predicament.\nThere were other lords and ladies of high degree; and some who, though\nneither lords nor ladies, were charming people, which Lord Monmouth\nchiefly cared about; troops of fine gentlemen who came and went; and\nsome who were neither fine nor gentlemen, but who were very amusing\nor very obliging, as circumstances required, and made life easy and\npleasant to others and themselves.\n\nA new scene this for Coningsby, who watched with interest all that\npassed before him. The dinner was announced as served; an affectionate\narm guides him at a moment of some perplexity.\n\n'When did you arrive, Harry? We shall sit together. How is the Duchess?'\ninquired Mr. Rigby, who spoke as if he had seen Coningsby for the first\ntime; but who indeed had, with that eye which nothing could escape,\nobserved his reception by his grandfather, marked it well, and inwardly\ndigested it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThere was to be a first appearance on the stage of Lord Monmouth's\ntheatre to-night, the expectation of which created considerable interest\nin the party, and was one of the principal subjects of conversation at\ndinner. Villebecque, the manager of the troop, had married the actress\nStella, once celebrated for her genius and her beauty; a woman who had\nnone of the vices of her craft, for, though she was a fallen angel,\nthere were what her countrymen style extenuating circumstances in\nher declension. With the whole world at her feet, she had remained\nunsullied. Wealth and its enjoyments could not tempt her, although\nshe was unable to refuse her heart to one whom she deemed worthy of\npossessing it. She found her fate in an Englishman, who was the father\nof her only child, a daughter. She thought she had met in him a hero, a\ndemi-god, a being of deep passion and original and creative mind; but\nhe was only a voluptuary, full of violence instead of feeling, and\neccentric, because he had great means with which he could gratify\nextravagant whims. Stella found she had made the great and irretrievable\nmistake. She had exchanged devotion for a passionate and evanescent\nfancy, prompted at first by vanity, and daily dissipating under the\ninfluence of custom and new objects. Though not stainless in conduct,\nStella was pure in spirit. She required that devotion which she had\nyielded; and she separated herself from the being to whom she had made\nthe most precious sacrifice. He offered her the consoling compensation\nof a settlement, which she refused; and she returned with a broken\nspirit to that profession of which she was still the ornament and the\npride.\n\nThe animating principle of her career was her daughter, whom she\neducated with a solicitude which the most virtuous mother could not\nsurpass. To preserve her from the stage, and to secure for her an\nindependence, were the objects of her mother's life; but nature\nwhispered to her, that the days of that life were already numbered.\nThe exertions of her profession had alarmingly developed an inherent\ntendency to pulmonary disease. Anxious that her child should not be left\nwithout some protector, Stella yielded to the repeated solicitations\nof one who from the first had been her silent admirer, and she married\nVillebecque, a clever actor, and an enterprising man who meant to be\nsomething more. Their union was not of long duration, though it was\nhappy on the side of Villebecque, and serene on that of his wife. Stella\nwas recalled from this world, where she had known much triumph and more\nsuffering; and where she had exercised many virtues, which elsewhere,\nthough not here, may perhaps be accepted as some palliation of one great\nerror.\n\nVillebecque acted becomingly to the young charge which Stella had\nbequeathed to him. He was himself, as we have intimated, a man of\nenterprise, a restless spirit, not content to move for ever in the\nsphere in which he was born. Vicissitudes are the lot of such aspirants.\nVillebecque became manager of a small theatre, and made money. If\nVillebecque without a sou had been a schemer, Villebecque with a small\ncapital was the very Chevalier Law of theatrical managers. He took a\nlarger theatre, and even that succeeded. Soon he was recognised as the\nlessee of more than one, and still he prospered. Villebecque began to\ndabble in opera-houses. He enthroned himself at Paris; his envoys\nwere heard of at Milan and Naples, at Berlin and St. Petersburg. His\ncontroversies with the Conservatoire at Paris ranked among state papers.\nVillebecque rolled in chariots and drove cabriolets; Villebecque gave\nrefined suppers to great nobles, who were honoured by the invitation;\nVillebecque wore a red ribbon in the button-hole of his frock, and more\nthan one cross in his gala dress.\n\nAll this time the daughter of Stella increased in years and stature,\nand we must add in goodness: a mild, soft-hearted girl, as yet with no\ndecided character, but one who loved calmness and seemed little fitted\nfor the circle in which she found herself. In that circle, however,\nshe ever experienced kindness and consideration. No enterprise however\nhazardous, no management however complicated, no schemes however vast,\never for a moment induced Villebecque to forget 'La Petite.' If only for\none breathless instant, hardly a day elapsed but he saw her; she was his\ncompanion in all his rapid movements, and he studied every comfort and\nconvenience that could relieve her delicate frame in some degree from\nthe inconvenience and exhaustion of travel. He was proud to surround\nher with luxury and refinement; to supply her with the most celebrated\nmasters; to gratify every wish that she could express.\n\nBut all this time Villebecque was dancing on a volcano. The catastrophe\nwhich inevitably occurs in the career of all great speculators, and\nespecially theatrical ones, arrived to him. Flushed with his prosperity,\nand confident in his constant success, nothing would satisfy him\nbut universal empire. He had established his despotism at Paris, his\ndynasties at Naples and at Milan; but the North was not to him, and\nhe was determined to appropriate it. Berlin fell before a successful\ncampaign, though a costly one; but St. Petersburg and London still\nremained. Resolute and reckless, nothing deterred Villebecque. One\nseason all the opera-houses in Europe obeyed his nod, and at the end\nof it he was ruined. The crash was utter, universal, overwhelming; and\nunder ordinary circumstances a French bed and a brasier of charcoal\nalone remained for Villebecque, who was equal to the occasion. But\nthe thought of La Petite and the remembrance of his promise to Stella\ndeterred him from the deed. He reviewed his position in a spirit\nbecoming a practical philosopher. Was he worse off than before he\ncommenced his career? Yes, because he was older; though to be sure he\nhad his compensating reminiscences. But was he too old to do anything?\nAt forty-five the game was not altogether up; and in a large theatre,\nnot too much lighted, and with the artifices of a dramatic toilet,\nhe might still be able successfully to reassume those characters of\ncoxcombs and muscadins, in which he was once so celebrated. Luxury had\nperhaps a little too much enlarged his waist, but diet and rehearsals\nwould set all right.\n\nVillebecque in their adversity broke to La Petite, that the time had\nunfortunately arrived when it would be wise for her to consider the most\neffectual means for turning her talents and accomplishments to account.\nHe himself suggested the stage, to which otherwise there were\ndoubtless objections, because her occupation in any other pursuit would\nnecessarily separate them; but he impartially placed before her the\nrelative advantages and disadvantages of every course which seemed to\nlie open to them, and left the preferable one to her own decision. La\nPetite, who had wept very much over Villebecque's misfortunes, and often\nassured him that she cared for them only for his sake, decided for the\nstage, solely because it would secure their not being parted; and yet,\nas she often assured him, she feared she had no predisposition for the\ncareer.\n\nVillebecque had now not only to fill his own parts at the theatre\nat which he had obtained an engagement, but he had also to be the\ninstructor of his ward. It was a life of toil; an addition of labour\nand effort that need scarcely have been made to the exciting exertion\nof performance, and the dull exercise of rehearsal; but he bore it all\nwithout a murmur; with a self-command and a gentle perseverance which\nthe finest temper in the world could hardly account for; certainly not\nwhen we remember that its possessor, who had to make all these exertions\nand endure all this wearisome toil, had just experienced the most\nshattering vicissitudes of fortune, and been hurled from the possession\nof absolute power and illimitable self-gratification.\n\nLord Eskdale, who was always doing kind things to actors and actresses,\nhad a great regard for Villebecque, with whom he had often supped. He\nhad often been kind, too, to La Petite. Lord Eskdale had a plan for\nputting Villebecque, as he termed it, 'on his legs again.' It was to\nestablish him with a French Company in London at some pretty theatre;\nLord Eskdale to take a private box and to make all his friends do the\nsame. Villebecque, who was as sanguine as he was good-tempered, was\nravished by this friendly scheme. He immediately believed that he should\nrecover his great fortunes as rapidly as he had lost them. He foresaw in\nLa Petite a genius as distinguished as that of her mother, although as\nyet not developed, and he was boundless in his expressions of gratitude\nto his patron. And indeed of all friends, a friend in need is the most\ndelightful. Lord Eskdale had the talent of being a friend in need.\nPerhaps it was because he knew so many worthless persons. But it often\nhappens that worthless persons are merely people who are worth nothing.\n\nLord Monmouth having written to Mr. Rigby of his intention to reside for\nsome months at Coningsby, and having mentioned that he wished a troop of\nFrench comedians to be engaged for the summer, Mr. Rigby had immediately\nconsulted Lord Eskdale on the subject, as the best current authority.\nThinking this a good opportunity of giving a turn to poor Villebecque,\nand that it might serve as a capital introduction to their scheme of the\nLondon company, Lord Eskdale obtained for him the engagement.\n\nVillebecque and his little troop had now been a month at Coningsby, and\nhad hitherto performed three times a-week. Lord Monmouth was content;\nhis guests much gratified; the company, on the whole, much approved\nof. It was, indeed, considering its limited numbers, a capital company.\nThere was a young lady who played the old woman's parts, nothing\ncould be more garrulous and venerable; and a lady of maturer years who\nperformed the heroines, gay and graceful as May. Villebecque himself was\na celebrity in characters of airy insolence and careless frolic. Their\nold man, indeed, was rather hard, but handy; could take anything either\nin the high serious, or the low droll. Their sentimental lover was\nrather too much bewigged, and spoke too much to the audience, a fault\nrare with the French; but this hero had a vague idea that he was\nultimately destined to run off with a princess.\n\nIn this wise, affairs had gone on for a month; very well, but not too\nwell. The enterprising genius of Villebecque, once more a manager,\nprompted him to action. He felt an itching desire to announce a novelty.\nHe fancied Lord Monmouth had yawned once or twice when the heroine came\non. Villebecque wanted to make a _coup._ It was clear that La Petite\nmust sooner or later begin. Could she find a more favourable audience,\nor a more fitting occasion, than were now offered? True it was she had\na great repugnance to come out; but it certainly seemed more to her\nadvantage that she should make her first appearance at a private theatre\nthan at a public one; supported by all the encouraging patronage of\nConingsby Castle, than subjected to all the cynical criticism of the\nstalls of St. James'.\n\nThese views and various considerations were urged and represented by\nVillebecque to La Petite, with all the practised powers of plausibility\nof which so much experience as a manager had made him master. La Petite\nlooked infinitely distressed, but yielded, as she ever did. And the\nnight of Coningsby's arrival at the Castle was to witness in its private\ntheatre the first appearance of MADEMOISELLE FLORA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nThe guests re-assembled in the great saloon before they repaired to the\ntheatre. A lady on the arm of the Russian Prince bestowed on Coningsby\na haughty, but not ungracious bow; which he returned, unconscious of\nthe person to whom he bent. She was, however, a striking person; not\nbeautiful, her face, indeed, at the first glance was almost repulsive,\nyet it ever attracted a second gaze. A remarkable pallor distinguished\nher; her features had neither regularity nor expression; neither were\nher eyes fine; but her brow impressed you with an idea of power of no\nordinary character or capacity. Her figure was as fine and commanding as\nher face was void of charm. Juno, in the full bloom of her immortality,\ncould have presented nothing more majestic. Coningsby watched her as she\nswept along like a resistless Fate.\n\nServants now went round and presented to each of the guests a billet\nof the performance. It announced in striking characters the _d\u00c3\u00a9but_ of\nMademoiselle Flora. A principal servant, bearing branch lights, came\nforward and bowed to the Marquess. Lord Monmouth went immediately to the\nGrand-duke, and notified to his Imperial Highness that the comedy was\nready. The Grand-duke offered his arm to the Ambassadress; the rest were\nfollowing; Coningsby was called; Madame Colonna wished him to be her\nbeau.\n\nIt was a pretty theatre; had been rapidly rubbed up and renovated here\nand there; the painting just touched; a little gilding on a cornice.\nThere were no boxes, but the ground-floor, which gradually ascended, was\ncarpeted and covered with arm-chairs, and the back of the theatre with a\nnew and rich curtain of green velvet.\n\nThey are all seated; a great artist performs on the violin, accompanied\nby another great artist on the piano. The lights rise; somebody\nevidently crosses the stage behind the curtain. They are disposing the\nscene. In a moment the curtain will rise also.\n\n'Have you seen Lucretia?' said the Princess to Coningsby. 'She is so\nanxious to resume her acquaintance with you.'\n\nBut before he could answer the bell rang, and the curtain rose.\n\nThe old man, who had a droll part to-night, came forward and maintained\na conversation with his housekeeper; not bad. The young woman who played\nthe grave matron performed with great finish. She was a favourite,\nand was ever applauded. The second scene came; a saloon tastefully\nfurnished; a table with flowers, arranged with grace; birds in cages, a\nlap-dog on a cushion; some books. The audience were pleased; especially\nthe ladies; they like to recognise signs of _bon ton_ in the details of\nthe scene. A rather awful pause, and Mademoiselle Flora enters. She was\ngreeted with even vehement approbation. Her agitation is extreme;\nshe curtseys and bows her head, as if to hide her face. The face was\npleasing, and pretty enough, soft and engaging. Her figure slight and\nrather graceful. Nothing could be more perfect than her costume; purely\nwhite, but the fashion consummate; a single rose her only ornament. All\nadmitted that her hair was arranged to admiration.\n\nAt length she spoke; her voice trembled, but she had a good elocution,\nthough her organ wanted force. The gentlemen looked at each other, and\nnodded approbation. There was something so unobtrusive in her mien,\nthat she instantly became a favourite with the ladies. The scene was not\nlong, but it was successful.\n\nFlora did not appear in the next scene. In the fourth and final one\nof the act, she had to make a grand display. It was a love-scene, and\nrather of an impassioned character; Villebecque was her suitor. He\nentered first on the stage. Never had he looked so well, or performed\nwith more spirit. You would not have given him five-and-twenty years; he\nseemed redolent of youth. His dress, too, was admirable. He had studied\nthe most distinguished of his audience for the occasion, and had\noutdone them all. The fact is, he had been assisted a little by a great\nconnoisseur, a celebrated French nobleman, Count D'O----y, who had been\none of the guests. The thing was perfect; and Lord Monmouth took a pinch\nof snuff, and tapped approbation on the top of his box.\n\nFlora now re-appeared, received with renewed approbation. It did not\nseem, however, that in the interval she had gained courage; she looked\nagitated. She spoke, she proceeded with her part; it became impassioned.\nShe had to speak of her feelings; to tell the secrets of her heart; to\nconfess that she loved another; her emotion was exquisitely performed,\nthe mournful tenderness of her tones thrilling. There was, throughout\nthe audience, a dead silence; all were absorbed in their admiration of\nthe unrivalled artist; all felt a new genius had visited the stage; but\nwhile they were fascinated by the actress, the woman was in torture. The\nemotion was the disturbance of her own soul; the mournful tenderness of\nher tones thrilled from the heart: suddenly she clasped her hands with\nall the exhaustion of woe; an expression of agony flitted over her\ncountenance; and she burst into tears. Villebecque rushed forward, and\ncarried, rather than led, her from the stage; the audience looking at\neach other, some of them suspecting that this movement was a part of the\nscene.\n\n'She has talent,' said Lord Monmouth to the Russian Ambassadress,\n'but wants practice. Villebecque should send her for a time to the\nprovinces.'\n\nAt length M. Villebecque came forward to express his deep regret\nthat the sudden and severe indisposition of Mlle. Flora rendered it\nimpossible for the company to proceed with the piece; but that the\ncurtain would descend to rise again for the second and last piece\nannounced.\n\nAll this accordingly took place. The experienced performer who acted the\nheroines now came forward and disported most jocundly. The failure of\nFlora had given fresh animation to her perpetual liveliness. She seemed\nthe very soul of elegant frolic. In the last scene she figured in male\nattire; and in air, fashion, and youth, beat Villebecque out of\nthe field. She looked younger than Coningsby when he went up to his\ngrandpapa.\n\nThe comedy was over, the curtain fell; the audience, much amused,\nchattered brilliant criticism, and quitted the theatre to repair to\nthe saloon, where they were to be diverted tonight with Russian dances.\nNobody thought of the unhappy Flora; not a single message to console her\nin her grief, to compliment her on what she had done, to encourage her\nfuture. And yet it was a season for a word of kindness; so, at least,\nthought one of the audience, as he lingered behind the hurrying crowd,\nabsorbed in their coming amusements.\n\nConingsby had sat very near the stage; he had observed, with great\nadvantage and attention, the countenance and movements of Flora from the\nbeginning. He was fully persuaded that her woe was genuine and profound.\nHe had felt his eyes moist when she wept. He recoiled from the cruelty\nand the callousness that, without the slightest symptom of sympathy,\ncould leave a young girl who had been labouring for their amusement, and\nwho was suffering for her trial.\n\nHe got on the stage, ran behind the scenes, and asked for Mlle. Flora.\nThey pointed to a door; he requested permission to enter. Flora was\nsitting at a table, with her face resting on her hands. Villebecque was\nthere, resting on the edge of the tall fender, and still in the dress in\nwhich he had performed in the last piece.\n\n'I took the liberty,' said Coningsby, 'of inquiring after Mlle. Flora;'\nand then advancing to her, who had raised her head, he added, 'I am sure\nmy grandfather must feel much indebted to you, Mademoiselle, for making\nsuch exertions when you were suffering under so much indisposition.'\n\n'This is very amiable of you, sir,' said the young lady, looking at him\nwith earnestness.\n\n'Mademoiselle has too much sensibility,' said Villebecque, making an\nobservation by way of diversion.\n\n'And yet that must be the soul of fine acting,' said Coningsby; 'I look\nforward, all look forward, with great interest to the next occasion on\nwhich you will favour us.'\n\n'Never!' said La Petite, in a plaintive tone; 'oh, I hope, never!'\n\n'Mademoiselle is not aware at this moment,' said Coningsby, 'how much\nher talent is appreciated. I assure you, sir,' he added, turning\nto Villebecque, 'I heard but one opinion, but one expression of\ngratification at her feeling and her fine taste.'\n\n'The talent is hereditary,' said Villebecque.\n\n'Indeed you have reason to say so,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Pardon; I was not thinking of myself. My child reminded me so much of\nanother this evening. But that is nothing. I am glad you are here, sir,\nto reassure Mademoiselle.'\n\n'I came only to congratulate her, and to lament, for our sakes as well\nas her own, her indisposition.'\n\n'It is not indisposition,' said La Petite, in a low tone, with her eyes\ncast down.\n\n'Mademoiselle cannot overcome the nervousness incidental to a first\nappearance,' said Villebecque.\n\n'A last appearance,' said La Petite: 'yes, it must be the last.' She\nrose gently, she approached Villebecque, she laid her head on his\nbreast, and placed her arms round his neck, 'My father, my best father,\nyes, say it is the last.'\n\n'You are the mistress of your lot, Flora,' said Villebecque; 'but with\nsuch a distinguished talent--'\n\n'No, no, no; no talent. You are wrong, my father. I know myself. I am\nnot of those to whom nature gives talents. I am born only for still\nlife. I have no taste except for privacy. The convent is more suited to\nme than the stage.'\n\n'But you hear what this gentleman says,' said Villebecque, returning\nher embrace. 'He tells you that his grandfather, my Lord Marquess, I\nbelieve, sir, that every one, that--'\n\n'Oh, no, no, no!' said Flora, shaking her head. 'He comes here because\nhe is generous, because he is a gentleman; and he wished to soothe the\nsoul that he knew was suffering. Thank him, my father, thank him for\nme and before me, and promise in his presence that the stage and your\ndaughter have parted for ever.'\n\n'Nay, Mademoiselle,' said Coningsby, advancing and venturing to take her\nhand, a soft hand, 'make no such resolutions to-night. M. Villebecque\ncan have no other thought or object but your happiness; and, believe me,\n'tis not I only, but all, who appreciate, and, if they were here, must\nrespect you.'\n\n'I prefer respect to admiration,' said Flora; 'but I fear that respect\nis not the appanage of such as I am.'\n\n'All must respect those who respect themselves,' said Coningsby. 'Adieu,\nMademoiselle; I trust to-morrow to hear that you are yourself.' He bowed\nto Villebecque and retired.\n\nIn the meantime affairs in the drawing-room assumed a very different\ncharacter from those behind the scenes. Coningsby returned to\nbrilliancy, groups apparently gushing with light-heartedness, universal\ncontent, and Russian dances!\n\n'And you too, do you dance the Russian dances, Mr. Coningsby?' said\nMadame Colonna.\n\n'I cannot dance at all,' said Coningsby, beginning a little to lose his\npride in the want of an accomplishment which at Eton he had thought it\nspirited to despise.\n\n'Ah! you cannot dance the Russian dances! Lucretia shall teach you,'\nsaid the Princess; 'nothing will please her so much.'\n\nOn the present occasion the ladies were not so experienced in the\nentertainment as the gentlemen; but there was amusement in being\ninstructed. To be disciplined by a Grand-duke or a Russian Princess\nwas all very well; but what even good-tempered Lady Gaythorp could not\npardon was, that a certain Mrs. Guy Flouncey, whom they were all of them\ntrying to put down and to keep down, on this, as almost on every\nother occasion, proved herself a more finished performer than even the\nRussians themselves.\n\nLord Monmouth had picked up the Guy Flounceys during a Roman winter.\nThey were people of some position in society. Mr. Guy Flouncey was a man\nof good estate, a sportsman, proud of his pretty wife. Mrs. Guy Flouncey\nwas even very pretty, dressed in a style of ultra fashion. However, she\ncould sing, dance, act, ride, and talk, and all well; and was mistress\nof the art of flirtation. She had amused the Marquess abroad, and had\ntaken care to call at Monmouth House the instant the _Morning Post_\napprised her he had arrived in England; the consequence was an\ninvitation to Coningsby. She came with a wardrobe which, in point of\nvariety, fancy, and fashion, never was surpassed. Morning and evening,\nevery day a new dress equally striking; and a riding habit that was the\ntalk and wonder of the whole neighbourhood. Mrs. Guy Flouncey created\nfar more sensation in the borough when she rode down the High Street,\nthan what the good people called the real Princesses.\n\nAt first the fine ladies never noticed her, or only stared at her over\ntheir shoulders; everywhere sounded, in suppressed whispers, the fatal\nquestion, 'Who is she?' After dinner they formed always into polite\ngroups, from which Mrs. Guy Flouncey was invariably excluded; and if\never the Princess Colonna, impelled partly by goodnature, and partly\nfrom having known her on the Continent, did kindly sit by her, Lady St.\nJulians, or some dame equally benevolent, was sure, by an adroit appeal\nto Her Highness on some point which could not be decided without moving,\nto withdraw her from her pretty and persecuted companion.\n\nIt was, indeed, rather difficult work the first few days for Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey, especially immediately after dinner. It is not soothing to\none's self-love to find oneself sitting alone, pretending to look at\nprints, in a fine drawing-room, full of fine people who don't speak\nto you. But Mrs. Guy Flouncey, after having taken Coningsby Castle by\nstorm, was not to be driven out of its drawing-room by the tactics\neven of a Lady St. Julians. Experience convinced her that all that was\nrequired was a little patience. Mrs. Guy had confidence in herself, her\nquickness, her ever ready accomplishments, and her practised powers of\nattraction. And she was right. She was always sure of an ally the moment\nthe gentlemen appeared. The cavalier who had sat next to her at dinner\nwas only too happy to meet her again. More than once, too, she had\ncaught her noble host, though a whole garrison was ever on the watch to\nprevent her, and he was greatly amused, and showed that he was greatly\namused by her society. Then she suggested plans to him to divert his\nguests. In a country-house the suggestive mind is inestimable. Somehow\nor other, before a week passed, Mrs. Guy Flouncey seemed the soul of\neverything, was always surrounded by a cluster of admirers, and with\nwhat are called 'the best men' ever ready to ride with her, dance\nwith her, act with her, or fall at her feet. The fine ladies found it\nabsolutely necessary to thaw: they began to ask her questions after\ndinner. Mrs. Guy Flouncey only wanted an opening. She was an adroit\nflatterer, with a temper imperturbable, and gifted with a ceaseless\nenergy of conferring slight obligations. She lent them patterns for new\nfashions, in all which mysteries she was very versant; and what with\nsome gentle glozing and some gay gossip, sugar for their tongues and\nsalt for their tails, she contrived pretty well to catch them all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nNothing could present a greater contrast than the respective interiors\nof Coningsby and Beaumanoir. That air of habitual habitation, which so\npleasingly distinguished the Duke's family seat, was entirely wanting\nat Coningsby. Everything, indeed, was vast and splendid; but it seemed\nrather a gala-house than a dwelling; as if the grand furniture and\nthe grand servants had all come down express from town with the grand\ncompany, and were to disappear and to be dispersed at the same time. And\ntruly there were manifold traces of hasty and temporary arrangement;\nnew carpets and old hangings; old paint, new gilding; battalions of odd\nFrench chairs, squadrons of queer English tables; and large tasteless\nlamps and tawdry chandeliers, evidently true cockneys, and only taking\nthe air by way of change. There was, too, throughout the drawing-rooms\nan absence of all those minor articles of ornamental furniture that are\nthe offering of taste to the home we love. There were no books neither;\nfew flowers; no pet animals; no portfolios of fine drawings by our\nEnglish artists like the album of the Duchess, full of sketches by\nLandseer and Stanfield, and their gifted brethren; not a print even,\nexcept portfolios of H. B.'s caricatures. The modes and manners of the\nhouse were not rural; there was nothing of the sweet order of a country\nlife. Nobody came down to breakfast; the ladies were scarcely seen\nuntil dinner-time; they rolled about in carriages together late in the\nafternoon as if they were in London, or led a sort of factitious boudoir\nlife in their provincial dressing-rooms.\n\nThe Marquess sent for Coningsby the morning after his arrival and asked\nhim to breakfast with him in his private rooms. Nothing could be\nmore kind or more agreeable than his grandfather. He appeared to be\ninterested in his grandson's progress, was glad to find Coningsby had\ndistinguished himself at Eton, solemnly adjured him not to neglect his\nFrench. A classical education, he said, was a very admirable thing, and\none which all gentlemen should enjoy; but Coningsby would find some day\nthat there were two educations, one which his position required, and\nanother which was demanded by the world. 'French, my dear Harry,' he\ncontinued, 'is the key to this second education. In a couple of years\nor so you will enter the world; it is a different thing to what you read\nabout. It is a masquerade; a motley, sparkling multitude, in which\nyou may mark all forms and colours, and listen to all sentiments and\nopinions; but where all you see and hear has only one object, plunder.\nWhen you get into this crowd you will find that Greek and Latin are not\nso much diffused as you imagine. I was glad to hear you speaking French\nyesterday. Study your accent. There are a good many foreigners here with\nwhom you may try your wing a little; don't talk to any of them too\nmuch. Be very careful of intimacies. All the people here are good\nacquaintance; at least pretty well. Now, here,' said the Marquess,\ntaking up a letter and then throwing it on the table again, 'now here is\na man whom I should like you to know, Sidonia. He will be here in a few\ndays. Lay yourself out for him if you have the opportunity. He is a\nman of rare capacity, and enormously rich. No one knows the world like\nSidonia. I never met his equal; and 'tis so pleasant to talk with one\nthat can want nothing of you.'\n\nLord Monmouth had invited Coningsby to take a drive with him in the\nafternoon. The Marquess wished to show a part of his domain to the\nAmbassadress. Only Lucretia, he said, would be with them, and there was\na place for him. This invitation was readily accepted by Coningsby, who\nwas not yet sufficiently established in the habits of the house exactly\nto know how to pass his morning. His friend and patron, Mr. Rigby, was\nentirely taken up with the Grand-duke, whom he was accompanying all\nover the neighbourhood, in visits to manufactures, many of which Rigby\nhimself saw for the first time, but all of which he fluently explained\nto his Imperial Highness. In return for this, he extracted much\ninformation from the Grand-duke on Russian plans and projects, materials\nfor a 'slashing' article against the Russophobia that he was preparing,\nand in which he was to prove that Muscovite aggression was an English\ninterest, and entirely to be explained by the want of sea-coast, which\ndrove the Czar, for the pure purposes of commerce, to the Baltic and the\nEuxine.\n\nWhen the hour for the drive arrived, Coningsby found Lucretia, a young\ngirl when he had first seen her only four years back, and still his\njunior, in that majestic dame who had conceded a superb recognition to\nhim the preceding eve. She really looked older than Madame Colonna; who,\nvery beautiful, very young-looking, and mistress of the real arts of\nthe toilet, those that cannot be detected, was not in the least altered\nsince she first so cordially saluted Coningsby as her dear young friend\nat Monmouth House.\n\nThe day was delightful, the park extensive and picturesque, the\nAmbassadress sparkling with anecdote, and occasionally, in a low voice,\nbreathing a diplomatic hint to Lord Monmouth, who bowed his graceful\nconsciousness of her distinguished confidence. Coningsby occasionally\ntook advantage of one of those moments, when the conversation ceased to\nbe general, to address Lucretia, who replied in calm, fine smiles, and\nin affable monosyllables. She indeed generally succeeded in conveying an\nimpression to those she addressed, that she had never seen them before,\ndid not care to see them now, and never wished to see them again. And\nall this, too, with an air of great courtesy.\n\nThey arrived at the brink of a wooded bank; at their feet flowed a\nfine river, deep and rushing, though not broad; its opposite bank the\nboundary of a richly-timbered park.\n\n'Ah! this is beautiful!' exclaimed the Ambassadress. 'And is that yours,\nLord Monmouth?'\n\n'Not yet,' said the Marquess. 'That is Hellingsley; it is one of the\nfinest places in the county, with a splendid estate; not so considerable\nas Coningsby, but very great. It belongs to an old, a very old man,\nwithout a relative in the world. It is known that the estate will be\nsold at his death, which may be almost daily expected. Then it is mine.\nNo one can offer for it what I can afford. For it gives me this division\nof the county, Princess. To possess Hellingsley is one of my objects.'\nThe Marquess spoke with an animation unusual with him, almost with a\ndegree of excitement.\n\nThe wind met them as they returned, the breeze blew rather freshly.\nLucretia all of a sudden seemed touched with unusual emotion. She was\nalarmed lest Lord Monmouth should catch cold; she took a kerchief from\nher own well-turned throat to tie round his neck. He feebly resisted,\nevidently much pleased.\n\nThe Princess Lucretia was highly accomplished. In the evening, having\nrefused several distinguished guests, but instantly yielding to the\nrequest of Lord Monmouth, she sang. It was impossible to conceive a\ncontralto of more thrilling power, or an execution more worthy of the\nvoice. Coningsby, who was not experienced in fine singing, listened as\nif to a supernatural lay, but all agreed it was of the highest class of\nnature and of art; and the Grand-duke was in raptures. Lucretia received\neven his Highness' compliments with a graceful indifference. Indeed, to\nthose who watched her demeanour, it might be remarked that she seemed to\nyield to none, although all bowed before her.\n\nMadame Colonna, who was always kind to Coningsby, expressed to him\nher gratification from the party of the morning. It must have been\ndelightful, she assured Coningsby, for Lord Monmouth to have had both\nLucretia and his grandson with him; and Lucretia too, she added, must\nhave been so pleased.\n\nConingsby could not make out why Madame Colonna was always intimating\nto him that the Princess Lucretia took such great interest in his\nexistence, looked forward with such gratification to his society,\nremembered with so much pleasure the past, anticipated so much happiness\nfrom the future. It appeared to him that he was to Lucretia, if not an\nobject of repugnance, as he sometimes fancied, certainly one only of\nabsolute indifference; but he said nothing. He had already lived long\nenough to know that it is unwise to wish everything explained.\n\nIn the meantime his life was agreeable. Every day, he found, added to\nhis acquaintance. He was never without a companion to ride or to shoot\nwith; and of riding Coningsby was very fond. His grandfather, too, was\ncontinually giving him goodnatured turns, and making him of consequence\nin the Castle: so that all the guests were fully impressed with the\nimportance of Lord Monmouth's grandson. Lady St. Julians pronounced him\ndistinguished; the Ambassadress thought diplomacy should be his part,\nas he had a fine person and a clear brain; Madame Colonna spoke of him\nalways as if she took intense interest in his career, and declared she\nliked him almost as much as Lucretia did; the Russians persisted\nin always styling him 'the young Marquess,' notwithstanding the\nAmbassador's explanations; Mrs. Guy Flouncey made a dashing attack\non him; but Coningsby remembered a lesson which Lady Everingham had\ngraciously bestowed on him. He was not to be caught again easily.\nBesides, Mrs. Guy Flouncey laughed a little too much, and talked a\nlittle too loud.\n\nAs time flew on, there were changes of visitors, chiefly among the\nsingle men. At the end of the first week after Coningsby's arrival, Lord\nEskdale appeared, bringing with him Lucian Gay; and soon after followed\nthe Marquess of Beaumanoir and Mr. Melton. These were all heroes who,\nin their way, interested the ladies, and whose advent was hailed\nwith general satisfaction. Even Lucretia would relax a little to Lord\nEskdale. He was one of her oldest friends, and with a simplicity of\nmanner which amounted almost to plainness, and with rather a cynical\nnonchalance in his carriage towards men, Lord Eskdale was invariably a\nfavourite with women. To be sure his station was eminent; he was noble,\nand very rich, and very powerful, and these are qualities which tell as\nmuch with the softer as the harsher sex; but there are individuals with\nall these qualities who are nevertheless unpopular with women. Lord\nEskdale was easy, knew the world thoroughly, had no prejudices, and,\nabove all, had a reputation for success. A reputation for success has as\nmuch influence with women as a reputation for wealth has with men. Both\nreputations may be, and often are, unjust; but we see persons daily make\ngood fortunes by them all the same. Lord Eskdale was not an impostor;\nand though he might not have been so successful a man had he not been\nLord Eskdale, still, thrown over by a revolution, he would have lighted\non his legs.\n\nThe arrival of this nobleman was the occasion of giving a good turn to\npoor Flora. He went immediately to see his friend Villebecque and his\ntroop. Indeed it was a sort of society which pleased Lord Eskdale more\nthan that which is deemed more refined. He was very sorry about 'La\nPetite;' but thought that everything would come right in the long run;\nand told Villebecque that he was glad to hear him well spoken of here,\nespecially by the Marquess, who seemed to take to him. As for Flora, he\nwas entirely against her attempting the stage again, at least for the\npresent, but as she was a good musician, he suggested to the Princess\nLucretia one night, that the subordinate aid of Flora might be of\nservice to her, and permit her to favour her friends with some pieces\nwhich otherwise she must deny to them. This suggestion was successful;\nFlora was introduced occasionally, soon often, to their parties in the\nevening, and her performances were in every respect satisfactory. There\nwas nothing to excite the jealousy of Lucretia either in her style or\nher person. And yet she sang well enough, and was a quiet, refined,\nretiring, by no means disagreeable person. She was the companion of\nLucretia very often in the morning as well as in the illumined saloon;\nfor the Princess was devoted to the art in which she excelled. This\nconnexion on the whole contributed to the happiness of poor Flora. True\nit was, in the evening she often found herself sitting or standing alone\nand no one noticing her; she had no dazzling quality to attract men of\nfashion, who themselves love to worship ever the fashionable. Even\ntheir goddesses must be _\u00c3\u00a0 la mode_. But Coningsby never omitted an\nopportunity to show Flora some kindness under these circumstances.\nHe always came and talked to her, and praised her singing, and would\nsometimes hand her refreshments and give her his arm if necessary. These\nslight attentions coming from the grandson of Lord Monmouth were for\nthe world redoubled in their value, though Flora thought only of their\nessential kindness; all in character with that first visit which dwelt\non the poor girl's memory, though it had long ago escaped that of her\nvisitor. For in truth Coningsby had no other impulse for his conduct but\nkind-heartedness.\n\nThus we have attempted to give some faint idea how life glided away at\nthe Castle the first fortnight that Coningsby passed there. Perhaps we\nought not to omit that Mrs. Guy Flouncey, to the infinite disgust of\nLady St. Julians, who had a daughter with her, successfully entrapped\nthe devoted attentions of the young Marquess of Beaumanoir, who was\nnever very backward if a lady would take trouble enough; while his\nfriend, Mr. Melton, whose barren homage Lady St. Julians wished\nher daughter ever particularly to shun, employed all his gaiety,\ngood-humour, frivolity, and fashion in amusing that young lady, and with\nirresistible effect. For the rest, they continued, though they had only\npartridges to shoot, to pass the morning without weariness. The weather\nwas fine; the stud numerous; all might be mounted. The Grand-duke and\nhis suite, guided by Mr. Rigby, had always some objects to visit, and\nrailroads returned them just in time for the banquet with an appetite\nwhich they had earned, and during which Rigby recounted their\nachievements, and his own opinions.\n\nThe dinner was always firstrate; the evening never failed; music,\ndancing, and the theatre offered great resources independently of the\nsoul-subduing sentiment harshly called flirtation, and which is the\nspell of a country house. Lord Monmouth was satisfied, for he had\nscarcely ever felt wearied. All that he required in life was to be\namused; perhaps that was not all he required, but it was indispensable.\nNor was it wonderful that on the present occasion he obtained his\npurpose, for there were half a hundred of the brightest eyes\nand quickest brains ever on the watch or the whirl to secure him\ndistraction. The only circumstance that annoyed him was the non-arrival\nof Sidonia. Lord Monmouth could not bear to be disappointed. He could\nnot refrain from saying, notwithstanding all the resources and all the\nexertions of his guests,\n\n'I cannot understand why Sidonia does not come. I wish Sidonia were\nhere.'\n\n'So do I,' said Lord Eskdale; 'Sidonia is the only man who tells one\nanything new.'\n\n'We saw Sidonia at Lord Studcaster's,' said Lord Beaumanoir. 'He told\nMelton he was coming here.'\n\n'You know he has bought all Studcaster's horses,' said Mr. Melton.\n\n'I wonder he does not buy Studcaster himself,' said Lord Monmouth; 'I\nwould if I were he; Sidonia can buy anything,' he turned to Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey.\n\n'I wonder who Sidonia is,' thought Mrs. Guy Flouncey, but she was\ndetermined no one should suppose she did not know.\n\nAt length one day Coningsby met Madame Colonna in the vestibule before\ndinner.\n\n'Milor is in such good temper, Mr. Coningsby,' she said; 'Monsieur de\nSidonia has arrived.'\n\nAbout ten minutes before dinner there was a stir in the chamber.\nConingsby looked round. He saw the Grand-duke advancing, and holding out\nhis hand in a manner the most gracious. A gentleman, of distinguished\nair, but with his back turned to Coningsby, was bowing as he received\nhis Highness' greeting. There was a general pause in the room. Several\ncame forward: even the Marquess seemed a little moved. Coningsby could\nnot resist the impulse of curiosity to see this individual of whom he\nhad heard so much. He glided round the room, and caught the countenance\nof his companion in the forest inn; he who announced to him, that 'the\nAge of Ruins was past.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nSidonia was descended from a very ancient and noble family of Arragon,\nthat, in the course of ages, had given to the state many distinguished\ncitizens. In the priesthood its members had been peculiarly eminent.\nBesides several prelates, they counted among their number an Archbishop\nof Toledo; and a Sidonia, in a season of great danger and difficulty,\nhad exercised for a series of years the paramount office of Grand\nInquisitor.\n\nYet, strange as it may sound, it is nevertheless a fact, of which there\nis no lack of evidence, that this illustrious family during all this\nperiod, in common with two-thirds of the Arragonese nobility, secretly\nadhered to the ancient faith and ceremonies of their fathers; a belief\nin the unity of the God of Sinai, and the rights and observances of the\nlaws of Moses.\n\nWhence came those Mosaic Arabs whose passages across the strait from\nAfrica to Europe long preceded the invasion of the Mohammedan Arabs, it\nis now impossible to ascertain. Their traditions tell us that from time\nimmemorial they had sojourned in Africa; and it is not improbable that\nthey may have been the descendants of some of the earlier dispersions;\nlike those Hebrew colonies that we find in China, and who probably\nemigrated from Persia in the days of the great monarchies. Whatever may\nhave been their origin in Africa, their fortunes in Southern Europe\nare not difficult to trace, though the annals of no race in any age can\ndetail a history of such strange vicissitudes, or one rife with more\ntouching and romantic incident. Their unexampled prosperity in the\nSpanish Peninsula, and especially in the south, where they had become\nthe principal cultivators of the soil, excited the jealousy of the\nGoths; and the Councils of Toledo during the sixth and seventh\ncenturies attempted, by a series of decrees worthy of the barbarians who\npromulgated them, to root the Jewish Arabs out of the land. There is no\ndoubt the Council of Toledo led, as directly as the lust of Roderick,\nto the invasion of Spain by the Moslemin Arabs. The Jewish population,\nsuffering under the most sanguinary and atrocious persecution, looked to\ntheir sympathising brethren of the Crescent, whose camps already gleamed\non the opposite shore. The overthrow of the Gothic kingdoms was as much\nachieved by the superior information which the Saracens received from\ntheir suffering kinsmen, as by the resistless valour of the Desert. The\nSaracen kingdoms were established. That fair and unrivalled civilisation\narose which preserved for Europe arts and letters when Christendom was\nplunged in darkness. The children of Ishmael rewarded the children of\nIsrael with equal rights and privileges with themselves. During these\nhalcyon centuries, it is difficult to distinguish the follower of Moses\nfrom the votary of Mahomet. Both alike built palaces, gardens, and\nfountains; filled equally the highest offices of the state, competed\nin an extensive and enlightened commerce, and rivalled each other in\nrenowned universities.\n\nEven after the fall of the principal Moorish kingdoms, the Jews of\nSpain were still treated by the conquering Goths with tenderness and\nconsideration. Their numbers, their wealth, the fact that, in Arragon\nespecially, they were the proprietors of the soil, and surrounded by\nwarlike and devoted followers, secured for them an usage which, for\na considerable period, made them little sensible of the change of\ndynasties and religions. But the tempest gradually gathered. As the\nGoths grew stronger, persecution became more bold. Where the Jewish\npopulation was scanty they were deprived of their privileges, or obliged\nto conform under the title of 'Nuevos Christianos.' At length the union\nof the two crowns under Ferdinand and Isabella, and the fall of the\nlast Moorish kingdom, brought the crisis of their fate both to the New\nChristian and the nonconforming Hebrew. The Inquisition appeared, the\nInstitution that had exterminated the Albigenses and had desolated\nLanguedoc, and which, it should ever be remembered, was established in\nthe Spanish kingdoms against the protests of the Cortes and amid the\nterror of the populace. The Dominicans opened their first tribunal at\nSeville, and it is curious that the first individuals they summoned\nbefore them were the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Marquess of Cadiz, and\nthe Count of Arcos; three of the most considerable personages in Spain.\nHow many were burned alive at Seville during the first year, how many\nimprisoned for life, what countless thousands were visited with severe\nthough lighter punishments, need not be recorded here. In nothing was\nthe Holy Office more happy than in multiform and subtle means by which\nthey tested the sincerity of the New Christians.\n\nAt length the Inquisition was to be extended to Arragon. The\nhigh-spirited nobles of that kingdom knew that its institution was for\nthem a matter of life or death. The Cortes of Arragon appealed to the\nKing and to the Pope; they organised an extensive conspiracy; the chief\nInquisitor was assassinated in the cathedral of Saragossa. Alas! it\nwas fated that in this, one of the many, and continual, and continuing\nstruggles between the rival organisations of the North and the South,\nthe children of the sun should fall. The fagot and the San Benito were\nthe doom of the nobles of Arragon. Those who were convicted of secret\nJudaism, and this scarcely three centuries ago, were dragged to the\nstake; the sons of the noblest houses, in whose veins the Hebrew taint\ncould be traced, had to walk in solemn procession, singing psalms, and\nconfessing their faith in the religion of the fell Torquemada.\n\nThis triumph in Arragon, the almost simultaneous fall of the last\nMoorish kingdom, raised the hopes of the pure Christians to the\nhighest pitch. Having purged the new Christians, they next turned their\nattention to the old Hebrews. Ferdinand was resolved that the delicious\nair of Spain should be breathed no longer by any one who did not profess\nthe Catholic faith. Baptism or exile was the alternative. More than\nsix hundred thousand individuals, some authorities greatly increase\nthe amount, the most industrious, the most intelligent, and the most\nenlightened of Spanish subjects, would not desert the religion of their\nfathers. For this they gave up the delightful land wherein they\nhad lived for centuries, the beautiful cities they had raised, the\nuniversities from which Christendom drew for ages its most precious\nlore, the tombs of their ancestors, the temples where they had\nworshipped the God for whom they had made this sacrifice. They had but\nfour months to prepare for eternal exile, after a residence of as many\ncenturies; during which brief period forced sales and glutted markets\nvirtually confiscated their property. It is a calamity that the\nscattered nation still ranks with the desolations of Nebuchadnezzar\nand of Titus. Who after this should say the Jews are by nature a sordid\npeople? But the Spanish Goth, then so cruel and so haughty, where is\nhe? A despised suppliant to the very race which he banished, for some\nmiserable portion of the treasure which their habits of industry have\nagain accumulated. Where is that tribunal that summoned Medina Sidonia\nand Cadiz to its dark inquisition? Where is Spain? Its fall, its\nunparalleled and its irremediable fall, is mainly to be attributed\nto the expulsion of that large portion of its subjects, the most\nindustrious and intelligent, who traced their origin to the Mosaic and\nMohammedan Arabs.\n\nThe Sidonias of Arragon were Nuevos Christianos. Some of them, no doubt,\nwere burned alive at the end of the fifteenth century, under the system\nof Torquemada; many of them, doubtless, wore the San Benito; but they\nkept their titles and estates, and in time reached those great offices\nto which we have referred.\n\nDuring the long disorders of the Peninsular war, when so many openings\nwere offered to talent, and so many opportunities seized by the\nadventurous, a cadet of a younger branch of this family made a large\nfortune by military contracts, and supplying the commissariat of the\ndifferent armies. At the peace, prescient of the great financial future\nof Europe, confident in the fertility of his own genius, in his original\nviews of fiscal subjects, and his knowledge of national resources, this\nSidonia, feeling that Madrid, or even Cadiz, could never be a base\non which the monetary transactions of the world could be regulated,\nresolved to emigrate to England, with which he had, in the course of\nyears, formed considerable commercial connections. He arrived here after\nthe peace of Paris, with his large capital. He staked all he was\nworth on the Waterloo loan; and the event made him one of the greatest\ncapitalists in Europe.\n\nNo sooner was Sidonia established in England than he professed Judaism;\nwhich Torquemada flattered himself, with the fagot and the San Benito,\nhe had drained out of the veins of his family more than three centuries\nago. He sent over, also, for several of his brothers, who were as\ngood Catholics in Spain as Ferdinand and Isabella could have possibly\ndesired, but who made an offering in the synagogue, in gratitude for\ntheir safe voyage, on their arrival in England.\n\nSidonia had foreseen in Spain that, after the exhaustion of a war of\ntwenty-five years, Europe must require capital to carry on peace. He\nreaped the due reward of his sagacity. Europe did require money, and\nSidonia was ready to lend it to Europe. France wanted some; Austria\nmore; Prussia a little; Russia a few millions. Sidonia could furnish\nthem all. The only country which he avoided was Spain; he was too well\nacquainted with its resources. Nothing, too, would ever tempt him to\nlend anything to the revolted colonies of Spain. Prudence saved him from\nbeing a creditor of the mother-country; his Spanish pride recoiled from\nthe rebellion of her children.\n\nIt is not difficult to conceive that, after having pursued the career we\nhave intimated for about ten years, Sidonia had become one of the most\nconsiderable personages in Europe. He had established a brother, or\na near relative, in whom he could confide, in most of the principal\ncapitals. He was lord and master of the money-market of the world, and\nof course virtually lord and master of everything else. He literally\nheld the revenues of Southern Italy in pawn; and monarchs and ministers\nof all countries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions.\nHe was still in the vigour of life, and was not a mere money-making\nmachine. He had a general intelligence equal to his position, and looked\nforward to the period when some relaxation from his vast enterprises and\nexertions might enable him to direct his energies to great objects of\npublic benefit. But in the height of his vast prosperity he suddenly\ndied, leaving only one child, a youth still of tender years, and heir to\nthe greatest fortune in Europe, so great, indeed, that it could only be\ncalculated by millions.\n\nShut out from universities and schools, those universities and schools\nwhich were indebted for their first knowledge of ancient philosophy\nto the learning and enterprise of his ancestors, the young Sidonia was\nfortunate in the tutor whom his father had procured for him, and who\ndevoted to his charge all the resources of his trained intellect and\nvast and varied erudition. A Jesuit before the revolution; since then an\nexiled Liberal leader; now a member of the Spanish Cortes; Rebello\nwas always a Jew. He found in his pupil that precocity of intellectual\ndevelopment which is characteristic of the Arabian organisation. The\nyoung Sidonia penetrated the highest mysteries of mathematics with\na facility almost instinctive; while a memory, which never had any\ntwilight hours, but always reflected a noontide clearness, seemed to\nmagnify his acquisitions of ancient learning by the promptness with\nwhich they could be reproduced and applied.\n\nThe circumstances of his position, too, had early contributed to give\nhim an unusual command over the modern languages. An Englishman, and\ntaught from his cradle to be proud of being an Englishman, he first\nevinced in speaking his native language those remarkable powers of\nexpression, and that clear and happy elocution, which ever afterwards\ndistinguished him. But the son of a Spaniard, the sonorous syllables\nof that noble tongue constantly resounded in his ear; while the foreign\nguests who thronged his father's mansion habituated him from an early\nperiod of life to the tones of languages that were not long strange to\nhim. When he was nineteen, Sidonia, who had then resided some time\nwith his uncle at Naples, and had made a long visit to another of his\nfather's relatives at Frankfort, possessed a complete mastery over the\nprincipal European languages.\n\nAt seventeen he had parted with Rebello, who returned to Spain, and\nSidonia, under the control of his guardians, commenced his travels. He\nresided, as we have mentioned, some time in Germany, and then, having\nvisited Italy, settled at Naples, at which city it may be said he\nmade his entrance into life. With an interesting person, and highly\naccomplished, he availed himself of the gracious attentions of a\ncourt of which he was principal creditor; and which, treating him as a\ndistinguished English traveller, were enabled perhaps to show him some\nfavours that the manners of the country might not have permitted them\nto accord to his Neapolitan relatives. Sidonia thus obtained at an\nearly age that experience of refined and luxurious society, which is a\nnecessary part of a finished education. It gives the last polish to the\nmanners; it teaches us something of the power of the passions, early\ndeveloped in the hot-bed of self-indulgence; it instils into us that\nindefinable tact seldom obtained in later life, which prevents us from\nsaying the wrong thing, and often impels us to do the right.\n\nBetween Paris and Naples Sidonia passed two years, spent apparently in\nthe dissipation which was perhaps inseparable from his time of life. He\nwas admired by women, to whom he was magnificent, idolised by artists\nwhom he patronised, received in all circles with great distinction, and\nappreciated for his intellect by the very few to whom he at all\nopened himself. For, though affable and gracious, it was impossible\nto penetrate him. Though unreserved in his manner, his frankness was\nstrictly limited to the surface. He observed everything, thought ever,\nbut avoided serious discussion. If you pressed him for an opinion, he\ntook refuge in raillery, or threw out some grave paradox with which it\nwas not easy to cope.\n\nThe moment he came of age, Sidonia having previously, at a great family\ncongress held at Naples, made arrangements with the heads of the houses\nthat bore his name respecting the disposition and management of his vast\nfortune, quitted Europe.\n\nSidonia was absent from his connections for five years, during which\nperiod he never communicated with them. They were aware of his existence\nonly by the orders which he drew on them for payment, and which arrived\nfrom all quarters of the globe. It would appear from these documents\nthat he had dwelt a considerable time in the Mediterranean regions;\npenetrated Nilotic Africa to Sennaar and Abyssinia; traversed the\nAsiatic continent to Tartary, whence he had visited Hindostan, and the\nisles of that Indian Sea which are so little known. Afterwards he was\nheard of at Valparaiso, the Brazils, and Lima. He evidently remained\nsome time at Mexico, which he quitted for the United States. One\nmorning, without notice, he arrived in London.\n\nSidonia had exhausted all the sources of human knowledge; he was master\nof the learning of every nation, of all tongues dead or living, of every\nliterature, Western and Oriental. He had pursued the speculations\nof science to their last term, and had himself illustrated them by\nobservation and experiment. He had lived in all orders of society, had\nviewed every combination of Nature and of Art, and had observed man\nunder every phasis of civilisation. He had even studied him in the\nwilderness. The influence of creeds and laws, manners, customs,\ntraditions, in all their diversities, had been subjected to his personal\nscrutiny.\n\nHe brought to the study of this vast aggregate of knowledge a\npenetrative intellect that, matured by long meditation, and assisted\nby that absolute freedom from prejudice, which, was the compensatory\npossession of a man without a country, permitted Sidonia to fathom,\nas it were by intuition, the depth of questions apparently the most\ndifficult and profound. He possessed the rare faculty of communicating\nwith precision ideas the most abstruse, and in general a power of\nexpression which arrests and satisfies attention.\n\nWith all this knowledge, which no one knew more to prize, with boundless\nwealth, and with an athletic frame, which sickness had never tried, and\nwhich had avoided excess, Sidonia nevertheless looked upon life with\na glance rather of curiosity than content. His religion walled him\nout from the pursuits of a citizen; his riches deprived him of the\nstimulating anxieties of a man. He perceived himself a lone being, alike\nwithout cares and without duties.\n\nTo a man in his position there might yet seem one unfailing source\nof felicity and joy; independent of creed, independent of country,\nindependent even of character. He might have discovered that perpetual\nspring of happiness in the sensibility of the heart. But this was a\nsealed fountain to Sidonia. In his organisation there was a peculiarity,\nperhaps a great deficiency. He was a man without affections. It would be\nharsh to say he had no heart, for he was susceptible of deep emotions,\nbut not for individuals. He was capable of rebuilding a town that was\nburned down; of restoring a colony that had been destroyed by some awful\nvisitation of Nature; of redeeming to liberty a horde of captives; and\nof doing these great acts in secret; for, void of all self-love, public\napprobation was worthless to him; but the individual never touched him.\nWoman was to him a toy, man a machine.\n\nThe lot the most precious to man, and which a beneficent Providence\nhas made not the least common; to find in another heart a perfect and\nprofound sympathy; to unite his existence with one who could share all\nhis joys, soften all his sorrows, aid him in all his projects, respond\nto all his fancies, counsel him in his cares, and support him in\nhis perils; make life charming by her charms, interesting by her\nintelligence, and sweet by the vigilant variety of her tenderness;\nto find your life blessed by such an influence, and to feel that your\ninfluence can bless such a life: this lot, the most divine of divine\ngifts, that power and even fame can never rival in its delights, all\nthis Nature had denied to Sidonia.\n\nWith an imagination as fiery as his native Desert, and an intellect as\nluminous as his native sky, he wanted, like that land, those softening\ndews without which the soil is barren, and the sunbeam as often a\nmessenger of pestilence as an angel of regenerative grace.\n\nSuch a temperament, though rare, is peculiar to the East. It inspired\nthe founders of the great monarchies of antiquity, the prophets that the\nDesert has sent forth, the Tartar chiefs who have overrun the world;\nit might be observed in the great Corsican, who, like most of the\ninhabitants of the Mediterranean isles, had probably Arab blood in his\nveins. It is a temperament that befits conquerors and legislators, but,\nin ordinary times and ordinary situations, entails on its possessor only\neccentric aberrations or profound melancholy.\n\nThe only human quality that interested Sidonia was Intellect. He cared\nnot whence it came; where it was to be found: creed, country, class,\ncharacter, in this respect, were alike indifferent to him. The author,\nthe artist, the man of science, never appealed to him in vain. Often he\nanticipated their wants and wishes. He encouraged their society; was as\nfrank in his conversation as he was generous in his contributions; but\nthe instant they ceased to be authors, artists, or philosophers, and\ntheir communications arose from anything but the intellectual quality\nwhich had originally interested him, the moment they were rash enough\nto approach intimacy and appealed to the sympathising man instead of\nthe congenial intelligence, he saw them no more. It was not however\nintellect merely in these unquestionable shapes that commanded his\nnotice. There was not an adventurer in Europe with whom he was not\nfamiliar. No Minister of State had such communication with secret agents\nand political spies as Sidonia. He held relations with all the clever\noutcasts of the world. The catalogue of his acquaintance in the shape of\nGreeks, Armenians, Moors, secret Jews, Tartars, Gipsies, wandering\nPoles and Carbonari, would throw a curious light on those subterranean\nagencies of which the world in general knows so little, but which\nexercise so great an influence on public events. His extensive travels,\nhis knowledge of languages, his daring and adventurous disposition, and\nhis unlimited means, had given him opportunities of becoming acquainted\nwith these characters, in general so difficult to trace, and of gaining\ntheir devotion. To these sources he owed that knowledge of strange and\nhidden things which often startled those who listened to him. Nor was it\neasy, scarcely possible, to deceive him. Information reached him from\nso many, and such contrary quarters, that with his discrimination and\nexperience, he could almost instantly distinguish the truth. The secret\nhistory of the world was his pastime. His great pleasure was to contrast\nthe hidden motive, with the public pretext, of transactions.\n\nOne source of interest Sidonia found in his descent and in the\nfortunes of his race. As firm in his adherence to the code of the great\nLegislator as if the trumpet still sounded on Sinai, he might have\nreceived in the conviction of divine favour an adequate compensation\nfor human persecution. But there were other and more terrestrial\nconsiderations that made Sidonia proud of his origin, and confident\nin the future of his kind. Sidonia was a great philosopher, who took\ncomprehensive views of human affairs, and surveyed every fact in its\nrelative position to other facts, the only mode of obtaining truth.\n\nSidonia was well aware that in the five great varieties into which\nPhysiology has divided the human species; to wit, the Caucasian, the\nMongolian, the Malayan, the American, the Ethiopian; the Arabian tribes\nrank in the first and superior class, together, among others, with the\nSaxon and the Greek. This fact alone is a source of great pride and\nsatisfaction to the animal Man. But Sidonia and his brethren could\nclaim a distinction which the Saxon and the Greek, and the rest of\nthe Caucasian nations, have forfeited. The Hebrew is an unmixed race.\nDoubtless, among the tribes who inhabit the bosom of the Desert,\nprogenitors alike of the Mosaic and the Mohammedan Arabs, blood may be\nfound as pure as that of the descendants of the Scheik Abraham. But the\nMosaic Arabs are the most ancient, if not the only, unmixed blood that\ndwells in cities.\n\nAn unmixed race of a firstrate organisation are the aristocracy of\nNature. Such excellence is a positive fact; not an imagination, a\nceremony, coined by poets, blazoned by cozening heralds, but perceptible\nin its physical advantages, and in the vigour of its unsullied\nidiosyncrasy.\n\nIn his comprehensive travels, Sidonia had visited and examined the\nHebrew communities of the world. He had found, in general, the lower\norders debased; the superior immersed in sordid pursuits; but he\nperceived that the intellectual development was not impaired. This gave\nhim hope. He was persuaded that organisation would outlive persecution.\nWhen he reflected on what they had endured, it was only marvellous\nthat the race had not disappeared. They had defied exile, massacre,\nspoliation, the degrading influence of the constant pursuit of gain;\nthey had defied Time. For nearly three thousand years, according to\nArchbishop Usher, they have been dispersed over the globe. To the\nunpolluted current of their Caucasian structure, and to the segregating\ngenius of their great Law-giver, Sidonia ascribed the fact that they\nhad not been long ago absorbed among those mixed races, who presume\nto persecute them, but who periodically wear away and disappear, while\ntheir victims still flourish in all the primeval vigour of the pure\nAsian breed.\n\nShortly after his arrival in England, Sidonia repaired to the principal\nCourts of Europe, that he might become personally acquainted with\nthe monarchs and ministers of whom he had heard so much. His position\ninsured him a distinguished reception; his personal qualities\nimmediately made him cherished. He could please; he could do more, he\ncould astonish. He could throw out a careless observation which would\nmake the oldest diplomatist start; a winged word that gained him the\nconsideration, sometimes the confidence, of Sovereigns. When he had\nfathomed the intelligence which governs Europe, and which can only be\ndone by personal acquaintance, he returned to this country.\n\nThe somewhat hard and literal character of English life suited one who\nshrank from sensibility, and often took refuge in sarcasm. Its masculine\nvigour and active intelligence occupied and interested his mind.\nSidonia, indeed, was exactly the character who would be welcomed in our\ncircles. His immense wealth, his unrivalled social knowledge, his clear\nvigorous intellect, the severe simplicity of his manners, frank, but\nneither claiming nor brooking familiarity, and his devotion to field\nsports, which was the safety-valve of his energy, were all circumstances\nand qualities which the English appreciate and admire; and it may be\nfairly said of Sidonia that few men were more popular, and none less\nunderstood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nAt dinner, Coningsby was seated on the same side as Sidonia, and distant\nfrom him. There had been, therefore, no mutual recognition. Another\nguest had also arrived, Mr. Ormsby. He came straight from London,\nfull of rumours, had seen Tadpole, who, hearing he was on the wing for\nConingsby Castle, had taken him into a dark corner of a club, and\nshown him his book, a safe piece of confidence, as Mr. Ormsby was very\nnear-sighted. It was, however, to be received as an undoubted fact, that\nall was right, and somehow or other, before very long, there would be\nnational demonstration of the same. This arrival of Mr. Ormsby, and the\nnews that he bore, gave a political turn to the conversation after the\nladies had left the room.\n\n'Tadpole wants me to stand for Birmingham,' said Mr. Ormsby, gravely.\n\n'You!' exclaimed Lord Monmouth, and throwing himself back in his chair,\nhe broke into a real, hearty laugh.\n\n'Yes; the Conservatives mean to start two candidates; a manufacturer\nthey have got, and they have written up to Tadpole for a \"West-end\nman.\"'\n\n'A what?'\n\n'A West-end man, who will make the ladies patronise their fancy\narticles.'\n\n'The result of the Reform Bill, then,' said Lucian Gay, 'will be to give\nManchester a bishop, and Birmingham a dandy.'\n\n'I begin to believe the result will be very different from what we\nexpected,' said Lord Monmouth.\n\nMr. Rigby shook his head and was going to prophesy, when Lord Eskdale,\nwho liked talk to be short, and was of opinion that Rigby should keep\nhis amplifications for his slashing articles, put in a brief careless\nobservation, which balked his inspiration.\n\n'Certainly,' said Mr. Ormsby, 'when the guns were firing over Vyvyan's\nlast speech and confession, I never expected to be asked to stand for\nBirmingham.'\n\n'Perhaps you may be called up to the other house by the title,' said\nLucian Gay. 'Who knows?'\n\n'I agree with Tadpole,' said Mr. Ormsby, 'that if we only stick to the\nRegistration the country is saved.'\n\n'Fortunate country!' said Sidonia, 'that can be saved by a good\nregistration!'\n\n'I believe, after all, that with property and pluck,' said Lord\nMonmouth, 'Parliamentary Reform is not such a very bad thing.'\n\nHere several gentlemen began talking at the same time, all agreeing\nwith their host, and proving in their different ways, the irresistible\ninfluence of property and pluck; property in Lord Monmouth's mind\nmeaning vassals, and pluck a total disregard for public opinion. Mr. Guy\nFlouncey, who wanted to get into parliament, but why nobody knew, who\nhad neither political abilities nor political opinions, but had some\nfloating idea that it would get himself and his wife to some more\nballs and dinners, and who was duly ticketed for 'a good thing' in the\ncandidate list of the Tadpoles and the Tapers, was of opinion that an\nimmense deal might be done by properly patronising borough races. That\nwas his specific how to prevent revolution.\n\nTaking advantage of a pause, Lord Monmouth said, 'I should like to know\nwhat you think of this question, Sidonia?'\n\n'I am scarcely a competent judge,' he said, as if wishing to disclaim\nany interference in the conversation, and then added, 'but I have been\never of opinion that revolutions are not to be evaded.'\n\n'Exactly my views,' said Mr. Rigby, eagerly; 'I say it now, I have said\nit a thousand times, you may doctor the registration as you like, but\nyou can never get rid of Schedule A.'\n\n'Is there a person in this room who can now tell us the names of the\nboroughs in Schedule A?' said Sidonia.\n\n'I am sure I cannot, 'said Lord Monmouth, 'though six of them belong to\nmyself.'\n\n'But the principle,' said Mr. Rigby; 'they represented a principle.'\n\n'Nothing else, certainly,' said Lucian Gay.\n\n'And what principle?' inquired Sidonia.\n\n'The principle of nomination.'\n\n'That is a practice, not a principle,' said Sidonia. 'Is it a practice\nthat no longer exists?'\n\n'You think then,' said Lord Eskdale, cutting in before Rigby, 'that the\nReform Bill has done us no harm?'\n\n'It is not the Reform Bill that has shaken the aristocracy of this\ncountry, but the means by which that Bill was carried,' replied Sidonia.\n\n'Physical force?' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'Or social power?' said Sidonia.\n\nUpon this, Mr. Rigby, impatient at any one giving the tone in a\npolitical discussion but himself, and chafing under the vigilance of\nLord Eskdale, which to him ever appeared only fortuitous, violently\nassaulted the argument, and astonished several country gentlemen present\nby its volubility. They at length listened to real eloquence. At the\nend of a long appeal to Sidonia, that gentleman only bowed his head and\nsaid, 'Perhaps;' and then, turning to his neighbour, inquired whether\nbirds were plentiful in Lancashire this season; so that Mr. Rigby was\nreduced to the necessity of forming the political opinions of Mr. Guy\nFlouncey.\n\nAs the gentlemen left the dining-room, Coningsby, though at some\ndistance, was observed by Sidonia, who stopped instantly, then advanced\nto Coningsby, and extending his hand said, 'I said we should meet again,\nthough I hardly expected so quickly.'\n\n'And I hope we shall not separate so soon,' said Coningsby; 'I was much\nstruck with what you said just now about the Reform Bill. Do you know\nthat the more I think the more I am perplexed by what is meant by\nRepresentation?'\n\n'It is a principle of which a limited definition is only current in\nthis country,' said Sidonia, quitting the room with him. 'People may be\nrepresented without periodical elections of neighbours who are incapable\nto maintain their interests, and strangers who are unwilling.'\n\nThe entrance of the gentlemen produced the same effect on the saloon as\nsunrise on the world; universal animation, a general though gentle stir.\nThe Grand-duke, bowing to every one, devoted himself to the daughter\nof Lady St. Julians, who herself pinned Lord Beaumanoir before he could\nreach Mrs. Guy Flouncey. Coningsby instead talked nonsense to that lady.\nBrilliant cavaliers, including Mr. Melton, addressed a band of beautiful\ndamsels grouped on a large ottoman. Everywhere sounded a delicious\nmurmur, broken occasionally by a silver-sounding laugh not too loud.\nSidonia and Lord Eskdale did not join the ladies. They stood for a few\nmoments in conversation, and then threw themselves on a sofa.\n\n'Who is that?' asked Sidonia of his companion rather earnestly, as\nConingsby quitted them.\n\n''Tis the grandson of Monmouth; young Coningsby.'\n\n'Ah! The new generation then promises. I met him once before, by chance;\nhe interests me.'\n\n'They tell me he is a lively lad. He is a prodigious favourite here, and\nI should not be surprised if Monmouth made him his heir.'\n\n'I hope he does not dream of inheritance,' said Sidonia. ''Tis the most\nenervating of visions.'\n\n'Do you admire Lady Augustina St. Julians?' said Mrs. Guy Flouncey to\nConingsby.\n\n'I admire no one except yourself.'\n\n'Oh! how very gallant, Mr. Coningsby!'\n\n'When should men be gallant, if not to the brilliant and the beautiful!'\nsaid Coningsby.\n\n'Ah! you are laughing at me.'\n\n'No, I am not. I am quite grave.'\n\n'Your eyes laugh. Now tell me, Mr. Coningsby, Lord Henry Sydney is a\nvery great friend of yours?'\n\n'Very.'\n\n'He is very amiable.'\n\n'Very.'\n\n'He does a great deal for the poor at Beaumanoir. A very fine place, is\nit not?'\n\n'Very.'\n\n'As fine as Coningsby?'\n\n'At present, with Mrs. Guy Flouncey at Coningsby, Beaumanoir would have\nno chance.'\n\n'Ah! you laugh at me again! Now tell me, Mr. Coningsby, what do you\nthink we shall do to-night? I look upon you, you know, as the real\narbiter of our destinies.'\n\n'You shall decide,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Mon cher Harry,' said Madame Colonna, coming up, 'they wish Lucretia to\nsing and she will not. You must ask her, she cannot refuse you.'\n\n'I assure you she can,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Mon cher Harry, your grandpapa did desire me to beg you to ask her to\nsing.'\n\nSo Coningsby unwillingly approached Lucretia, who was talking with the\nRussian Ambassador.\n\n'I am sent upon a fruitless mission,' said Coningsby, looking at her,\nand catching her glance.\n\n'What and why?' she replied.\n\n'The mission is to entreat you to do us all a great favour; and the\ncause of its failure will be that I am the envoy.'\n\n'If the favour be one to yourself, it is granted; and if you be the\nenvoy, you need never fear failure with me.'\n\n'I must presume then to lead you away,' said Coningsby, bending to the\nAmbassador.\n\n'Remember,' said Lucretia, as they approached the instrument, 'that I am\nsinging to you.'\n\n'It is impossible ever to forget it,' said Coningsby, leading her to the\npiano with great politeness, but only with great politeness.\n\n'Where is Mademoiselle Flora?' she inquired.\n\nConingsby found La Petite crouching as it were behind some furniture,\nand apparently looking over some music. She looked up as he approached,\nand a smile stole over her countenance. 'I am come to ask a favour,' he\nsaid, and he named his request.\n\n'I will sing,' she replied; 'but only tell me what you like.'\n\nConingsby felt the difference between the courtesy of the head and of\nthe heart, as he contrasted the manner of Lucretia and Flora. Nothing\ncould be more exquisitely gracious than the daughter of Colonna was\nto-night; Flora, on the contrary, was rather agitated and embarrassed;\nand did not express her readiness with half the facility and the grace\nof Lucretia; but Flora's arm trembled as Coningsby led her to the piano.\n\nMeantime Lord Eskdale and Sidonia are in deep converse.\n\n'Hah! that is a fine note!' said Sidonia, and he looked round. 'Who is\nthat singing? Some new _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_ of Lord Monmouth?'\n\n''Tis the daughter of the Colonnas,' said Lord Eskdale, 'the Princess\nLucretia.'\n\n'Why, she was not at dinner to-day.'\n\n'No, she was not there.'\n\n'My favourite voice; and of all, the rarest to be found. When I was a\nboy, it made me almost in love even with Pisaroni.'\n\n'Well, the Princess is scarcely more lovely. 'Tis a pity the plumage is\nnot as beautiful as the note. She is plain.'\n\n'No; not plain with that brow.'\n\n'Well, I rather admire her myself,' said Lord Eskdale. 'She has fine\npoints.'\n\n'Let us approach,' said Sidonia.\n\nThe song ceased, Lord Eskdale advanced, made his compliments, and then\nsaid, 'You were not at dinner to-day.'\n\n'Why should I be?' said the Princess.\n\n'For our sakes, for mine, if not for your own,' said Lord Eskdale,\nsmiling. 'Your absence has been remarked, and felt, I assure you, by\nothers as well as myself. There is my friend Sidonia so enraptured with\nyour thrilling tones, that he has abruptly closed a conversation which I\nhave been long counting on. Do you know him? May I present him to you?'\n\nAnd having obtained a consent, not often conceded, Lord Eskdale looked\nround, and calling Sidonia, he presented his friend to the Princess.\n\n'You are fond of music, Lord Eskdale tells me?' said Lucretia.\n\n'When it is excellent,' said Sidonia.\n\n'But that is so rare,' said the Princess.\n\n'And precious as Paradise,' said Sidonia. 'As for indifferent music,\n'tis Purgatory; but when it is bad, for my part I feel myself--'\n\n'Where?' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'In the last circle of the Inferno,' said Sidonia.\n\nLord Eskdale turned to Flora.\n\n'And in what circle do you place us who are here?' the Princess inquired\nof Sidonia.\n\n'One too polished for his verse,' replied her companion.\n\n'You mean too insipid,' said the Princess. 'I wish that life were a\nlittle more Dantesque.'\n\n'There is not less treasure in the world,' said Sidonia, 'because we use\npaper currency; and there is not less passion than of old, though it is\n_bon ton_ to be tranquil.'\n\n'Do you think so?' said the Princess, inquiringly, and then looking\nround the apartment. 'Have these automata, indeed, souls?'\n\n'Some of them,' said Sidonia. 'As many as would have had souls in the\nfourteenth century.'\n\n'I thought they were wound up every day,' said the Princess.\n\n'Some are self-impelling,' said Sidonia.\n\n'And you can tell at a glance?' inquired the Princess. 'You are one of\nthose who can read human nature?'\n\n''Tis a book open to all.'\n\n'But if they cannot read?'\n\n'Those must be your automata.'\n\n'Lord Monmouth tells me you are a great traveller?'\n\n'I have not discovered a new world.'\n\n'But you have visited it?'\n\n'It is getting old.'\n\n'I would sooner recall the old than discover the new,' said the\nPrincess.\n\n'We have both of us cause,' said Sidonia. 'Our names are the names of\nthe Past.'\n\n'I do not love a world of Utility,' said the Princess.\n\n'You prefer to be celebrated to being comfortable,' said Sidonia.\n\n'It seems to me that the world is withering under routine.'\n\n''Tis the inevitable lot of humanity,' said Sidonia. 'Man must ever\nbe the slave of routine: but in old days it was a routine of great\nthoughts, and now it is a routine of little ones.'\n\nThe evening glided on; the dance succeeded the song; the ladies were\nfast vanishing; Coningsby himself was meditating a movement, when Lord\nBeaumanoir, as he passed him, said, 'Come to Lucian Gay's room; we are\ngoing to smoke a cigar.'\n\nThis was a favourite haunt, towards midnight, of several of the younger\nmembers of the party at the Castle, who loved to find relaxation from\nthe decorous gravities of polished life in the fumes of tobacco, the\ninspiration of whiskey toddy, and the infinite amusement of Lucian Gay's\nconversation and company. This was the genial hour when the good story\ngladdened, the pun flashed, and the song sparkled with jolly mirth\nor saucy mimicry. To-night, being Coningsby's initiation, there was a\nspecial general meeting of the Grumpy Club, in which everybody was to\nsay the gayest things with the gravest face, and every laugh carried a\nforfeit. Lucian was the inimitable president. He told a tale for which\nhe was famous, of 'the very respectable county family who had been\nestablished in the shire for several generations, but who, it was\na fact, had been ever distinguished by the strange and humiliating\npeculiarity of being born with sheep's tails.' The remarkable\ncircumstances under which Lucian Gay had become acquainted with this\nfact; the traditionary mysteries by which the family in question had\nsucceeded for generations in keeping it secret; the decided measures to\nwhich the chief of the family had recourse to stop for ever the rumour\nwhen it first became prevalent; and finally the origin and result of the\nlegend; were details which Lucian Gay, with the most rueful countenance,\nloved to expend upon the attentive and expanding intelligence of a new\nmember of the Grumpy Club. Familiar as all present were with the story\nwhose stimulus of agonising risibility they had all in turn experienced,\nit was with extreme difficulty that any of them could resist the fatal\nexplosion which was to be attended with the dreaded penalty. Lord\nBeaumanoir looked on the table with desperate seriousness, an ominous\npucker quivering round his lip; Mr. Melton crammed his handkerchief into\nhis mouth with one hand, while he lighted the wrong end of a cigar with\nthe other; one youth hung over the back of his chair pinching himself\nlike a faquir, while another hid his countenance on the table.\n\n'It was at the Hunt dinner,' continued Lucian Gay, in an almost solemn\ntone, 'that an idea for a moment was prevalent, that Sir Mowbray\nCholmondeley Fetherstonehaugh, as the head of the family, had resolved\nto terminate for ever these mysterious aspersions on his race, that had\ncirculated in the county for more than two centuries; I mean that the\nhighly respectable family of the Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaughs had the\nmisfortune to be graced with that appendage to which I have referred.\nHis health being drunk, Sir Mowbray Cholmondeley Fetherstonehaugh\nrose. He was a little unpopular at the moment, from an ugly story about\nkilling foxes, and the guests were not as quiet as orators generally\ndesire, so the Honourable Baronet prayed particular attention to a\nmatter personal to himself. Instantly there was a dead silence--' but\nhere Coningsby, who had moved for some time very restlessly on his\nchair, suddenly started up, and struggling for a moment against the\ninward convulsion, but in vain, stamped against the floor, and gave a\nshout.\n\n'A song from Mr. Coningsby,' said the president of the Grumpy Club, amid\nan universal, and now permissible roar of laughter.\n\nConingsby could not sing; so he was to favour them as a substitute\nwith a speech or a sentiment. But Lucian Gay always let one off these\npenalties easily, and, indeed, was ever ready to fulfil them for all.\nSong, speech, or sentiment, he poured them all forth; nor were pastimes\nmore active wanting. He could dance a Tarantella like a Lazzarone, and\nexecute a Cracovienne with all the mincing graces of a ballet heroine.\n\nHis powers of mimicry, indeed, were great and versatile. But in nothing\nwas he so happy as in a Parliamentary debate. And it was remarkable\nthat, though himself a man who on ordinary occasions was quite incapable\nwithout infinite perplexity of publicly expressing his sense of the\nmerest courtesy of society, he was not only a master of the style of\nevery speaker of distinction in either house, but he seemed in his\nimitative play to appropriate their intellectual as well as their\nphysical peculiarities, and presented you with their mind as well as\ntheir manner. There were several attempts to-night to induce Lucian to\nindulge his guests with a debate, but he seemed to avoid the exertion,\nwhich was great. As the night grew old, however, and every hour he\ngrew more lively, he suddenly broke without further pressure into the\npromised diversion; and Coningsby listened really with admiration to a\ndiscussion, of which the only fault was that it was more parliamentary\nthan the original, 'plus Arabe que l'Arabie.'\n\nThe Duke was never more curt, nor Sir Robert more specious; he was as\nfiery as Stanley, and as bitter as Graham. Nor did he do their opponents\nless justice. Lord Palmerston himself never treated a profound subject\nwith a more pleasant volatility; and when Lucian rose at an early hour\nof morn, in a full house alike exhausted and excited, and after having\nendured for hours, in sarcastic silence, the menacing finger of Sir\nRobert, shaking over the green table and appealing to his misdeeds in\nthe irrevocable records of Hansard, Lord John himself could not have\nafforded a more perfect representative of pluck.\n\nBut loud as was the laughter, and vehement the cheering, with which\nLucian's performances were received, all these ebullitions sank into\ninsignificance compared with the reception which greeted what he himself\nannounced was to be the speech of the night. Having quaffed full many\na quaigh of toddy, he insisted on delivering, it on the table, a\nproposition with which his auditors immediately closed.\n\nThe orator appeared, the great man of the night, who was to answer\neverybody on both sides. Ah! that harsh voice, that arrogant style,\nthat saucy superficiality which decided on everything, that insolent\nignorance that contradicted everybody; it was impossible to mistake\nthem! And Coningsby had the pleasure of seeing reproduced before him the\nguardian of his youth and the patron of the mimic, the Right Honourable\nNicholas Rigby!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nMadame Colonna, with that vivacious energy which characterises the\nsouth, had no sooner seen Coningsby, and heard his praises celebrated\nby his grandfather, than she resolved that an alliance should sooner\nor later take place between him and her step-daughter. She imparted her\nprojects without delay to Lucretia, who received them in a different\nspirit from that in which they were communicated. Lucretia bore as\nlittle resemblance to her step-mother in character, as in person. If\nshe did not possess her beauty, she was born with an intellect of far\ngreater capacity and reach. She had a deep judgment. A hasty alliance\nwith a youth, arranged by their mutual relatives, might suit very well\nthe clime and manners of Italy, but Lucretia was well aware that it was\naltogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country. She had\nno conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her, or, if\nwilling, that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet\nonly on the threshold of the world. Lucretia therefore received\nthe suggestions and proposals of Madarne Colonna with coldness and\nindifference; one might even say contempt, for she neither felt respect\nfor this lady, nor was she sedulous to evince it. Although really\nyounger than Coningsby, Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is, in\nall worldly considerations, ten years older than a youth of the same\nage. She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before\nConingsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage,\nwhile, on the other hand, she was not only anxious, but resolved, not\nto delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which\nshe very frequently found herself.\n\nLucretia felt rather than expressed these ideas and impressions. She\nwas not naturally communicative, and conversed with no one with less\nfrankness and facility than with her step-mother. Madame Colonna\ntherefore found no reasons in her conversation with Lucretia to change\nher determination. As her mind was not ingenious she did not see\nquestions in those various lights which make us at the same time infirm\nof purpose and tolerant. What she fancied ought to be done, she fancied\nmust be done; for she perceived no middle course or alternative. For\nthe rest, Lucretia's carriage towards her gave her little discomfort.\nBesides, she herself, though good-natured, was obstinate. Her feelings\nwere not very acute; nothing much vexed her. As long as she had fine\ndresses, good dinners, and opera-boxes, she could bear her plans to be\ncrossed like a philosopher; and her consolation under her unaccomplished\ndevices was her admirable consistency, which always assured her that her\nprojects were wise, though unfulfilled.\n\nShe broke her purpose to Mr. Rigby, that she might gain not only his\nadhesion to her views, but his assistance in achieving them. As Madame\nColonna, in Mr. Rigby's estimation, exercised more influence over Lord\nMonmouth than any other individual, faithful to his policy or practice,\nhe agreed with all Madame Colonna's plans and wishes, and volunteered\ninstantly to further them. As for the Prince, his wife never consulted\nhim on any subject, nor did he wish to be consulted. On the contrary, he\nhad no opinion about anything. All that he required was that he should\nbe surrounded by what contributed to his personal enjoyment, that he\nshould never be troubled, and that he should have billiards. He was not\ninexpert in field-sports, rode indeed very well for an Italian, but\nhe never cared to be out-of-doors; and there was only one room in the\ninterior which passionately interested him. It was where the echoing\nballs denoted the sweeping hazard or the effective cannonade. That was\nthe chamber where the Prince Colonna literally existed. Half-an-hour\nafter breakfast he was in the billiard-room; he never quitted it until\nhe dressed for dinner; and he generally contrived, while the world were\namused or amusing themselves at the comedy or in the dance, to steal\ndown with some congenial sprites to the magical and illumined chamber,\nand use his cue until bedtime.\n\nFaithful to her first impressions, Lucretia had made no difference\nin her demeanour to Coningsby to that which she offered to the other\nguests. Polite, but uncommunicative; ready to answer, but never\noriginating conversation; she charmed him as little by her manner as by\nher person; and after some attempts, not very painstaking, to interest\nher, Coningsby had ceased to address her. The day passed by with only a\nfaint recognition between them; even that sometimes omitted.\n\nWhen, however, Lucretia observed that Coningsby had become one of the\nmost notable persons in the Castle; when she heard everywhere of\nhis talents and accomplishments, his beauty and grace and great\nacquirements, and perceived that he was courted by all; that Lord\nMonmouth omitted no occasion publicly to evince towards him his regard\nand consideration; that he seemed generally looked upon in the light of\nhis grandfather's heir; and that Lady St. Julians, more learned in that\nrespect than any lady in the kingdom, was heard more than once to regret\nthat she had not brought another daughter with her, Clara Isabella, as\nwell as Augustina; the Princess Lucretia began to imagine that Madame\nColonna, after all, might not be so extravagant in her purpose as she\nhad first supposed. She, therefore, surprised Coningsby with the almost\naffectionate moroseness with which, while she hated to sing, she yet\nfound pleasure in singing for him alone. And it is impossible to say\nwhat might not have been the next move in her tactics in this respect,\nhad not the very night on which she had resolved to commence the\nenchantment of Coningsby introduced to her Sidonia.\n\nThe Princess Lucretia encountered the dark still glance of the friend of\nLord Eskdale. He, too, beheld a woman unlike other women, and with his\nfine experience, both as a man and as a physiologist, felt that he was\nin the presence of no ordinary organisation. From the evening of his\nintroduction Sidonia sought the society of the Princess Lucretia. He\ncould not complain of her reserve. She threw out her mind in various and\nhighly-cultivated intelligence. He recognised in her a deep and subtile\nspirit, considerable reading for a woman, habits of thought, and a soul\npassionate and daring. She resolved to subdue one whose appreciation she\nhad gained, and who had subdued her. The profound meaning and the calm\nmanner of Sidonia combined to quell her spirit. She struggled against\nthe spell. She tried to rival his power; to cope with him, and with\nthe same weapons. But prompt as was her thought and bright as was\nits expression, her heart beat in tumult; and, with all her apparent\nserenity, her agitated soul was a prey of absorbing passion. She could\nnot contend with that intelligent, yet inscrutable, eye; with that\nmanner so full of interest and respect, and yet so tranquil. Besides,\nthey were not on equal terms. Here was a girl contending with a man\nlearned in the world's way.\n\nBetween Sidonia and Coningsby there at once occurred companionship. The\nmorning after his arrival they went out shooting together. After a long\nramble they would stretch themselves on the turf under a shady tree,\noften by the side of some brook where the cresses grow, that added\na luxury to their sporting-meal; and then Coningsby would lead their\nconversation to some subject on which Sidonia would pour out his mind\nwith all that depth of reflection, variety of knowledge, and richness\nof illustrative memory, which distinguished him; and which offered so\nstriking a contrast to the sharp talent, the shallow information, and\nthe worldly cunning, that make a Rigby.\n\nThis fellowship between Sidonia and Coningsby elevated the latter still\nmore in the estimation of Lucretia, and rendered her still more desirous\nof gaining his good will and opinion. A great friendship seemed to have\narisen between them, and the world began to believe that there must be\nsome foundation for Madame Colonna's innuendos. That lady herself\nwas not in the least alarmed by the attention which Sidonia paid her\nstep-daughter. It was, of course, well known that Sidonia was not a\nmarrying man. He was, however, a great friend of Mr. Coningsby, his\npresence and society brought Coningsby and Lucretia more together; and\nhowever flattered her daughter might be for the moment by Sidonia's\nhomage, still, as she would ultimately find out, if indeed she ever\ncared so to do, that Sidonia could only be her admirer, Madame Colonna\nhad no kind of doubt that ultimately Coningsby would be Lucretia's\nhusband, as she had arranged from the first.\n\nThe Princess Lucretia was a fine horse-woman, though she rarely joined\nthe various riding-parties that were daily formed at the Castle. Often,\nindeed, attended only by her groom, she met the equestrians. Now she\nwould ride with Sidonia and Coningsby, and as a female companion was\nindispensable, she insisted upon La Petite accompanying her. This was a\nfearful trial for Flora, but she encountered it, encouraged by the kind\nsolicitude of Coningsby, who always seemed her friend.\n\nVery shortly after the arrival of Sidonia, the Grand-duke and his suite\nquitted the Castle, which had been his Highness' head-quarters during\nhis visit to the manufacturing districts; but no other great change in\nthe assembled company occurred for some little time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n'You will observe one curious trait,' said Sidonia to Coningsby, 'in the\nhistory of this country: the depository of power is always unpopular;\nall combine against it; it always falls. Power was deposited in the\ngreat Barons; the Church, using the King for its instrument, crushed the\ngreat Barons. Power was deposited in the Church; the King, bribing the\nParliament, plundered the Church. Power was deposited in the King; the\nParliament, using the People, beheaded the King, expelled the King,\nchanged the King, and, finally, for a King substituted an administrative\nofficer. For one hundred and fifty years Power has been deposited in the\nParliament, and for the last sixty or seventy years it has been becoming\nmore and more unpopular. In 1830 it was endeavoured by a reconstruction\nto regain the popular affection; but, in truth, as the Parliament then\nonly made itself more powerful, it has only become more odious. As we\nsee that the Barons, the Church, the King, have in turn devoured each\nother, and that the Parliament, the last devourer, remains, it is\nimpossible to resist the impression that this body also is doomed to be\ndestroyed; and he is a sagacious statesman who may detect in what form\nand in what quarter the great consumer will arise.'\n\n'You take, then, a dark view of our position?'\n\n'Troubled, not dark. I do not ascribe to political institutions that\nparamount influence which it is the feeling of this age to attribute to\nthem. The Senate that confronted Brennus in the Forum was the same body\nthat registered in an after-age the ribald decrees of a Nero. Trial\nby jury, for example, is looked upon by all as the Palladium of our\nliberties; yet a jury, at a very recent period of our own history, the\nreign of Charles II., was a tribunal as iniquitous as the Inquisition.'\nAnd a graver expression stole over the countenance of Sidonia as he\nremembered what that Inquisition had operated on his own race and his\nown destiny. 'There are families in this country,' he continued, 'of\nboth the great historical parties, that in the persecution of their\nhouses, the murder and proscription of some of their most illustrious\nmembers, found judges as unjust and relentless in an open jury of their\ncountrymen as we did in the conclaves of Madrid and Seville.'\n\n'Where, then, would you look for hope?'\n\n'In what is more powerful than laws and institutions, and without which\nthe best laws and the most skilful institutions may be a dead letter,\nor the very means of tyranny in the national character. It is not in\nthe increased feebleness of its institutions that I see the peril of\nEngland; it is in the decline of its character as a community.'\n\n'And yet you could scarcely describe this as an age of corruption?'\n\n'Not of political corruption. But it is an age of social\ndisorganisation, far more dangerous in its consequences, because far\nmore extensive. You may have a corrupt government and a pure community;\nyou may have a corrupt community and a pure administration. Which would\nyou elect?'\n\nNeither,' said Coningsby; 'I wish to see a people full of faith, and a\ngovernment full of duty.'\n\n'Rely upon it,' said Sidonia, 'that England should think more of the\ncommunity and less of the government.'\n\n'But tell me, what do you understand by the term national character?'\n\n'A character is an assemblage of qualities; the character of England\nshould be an assemblage of great qualities.'\n\n'But we cannot deny that the English have great virtues.'\n\n'The civilisation of a thousand years must produce great virtues; but we\nare speaking of the decline of public virtue, not its existence.'\n\n'In what, then, do you trace that decline?'\n\n'In the fact that the various classes of this country are arrayed\nagainst each other.'\n\n'But to what do you attribute those reciprocal hostilities?'\n\n'Not entirely, not even principally, to those economical causes of which\nwe hear so much. I look upon all such as secondary causes, which, in a\ncertain degree, must always exist, which obtrude themselves in troubled\ntimes, and which at all times it is the business of wise statesmen to\nwatch, to regulate, to ameliorate, to modify.'\n\n'I am speaking to elicit truth, not to maintain opinions,' said\nConingsby; 'for I have none,' he added, mournfully.\n\n'I think,' said Sidonia, 'that there is no error so vulgar as to believe\nthat revolutions are occasioned by economical causes. They come in,\ndoubtless, very often to precipitate a catastrophe; very rarely do they\noccasion one. I know no period, for example, when physical comfort\nwas more diffused in England than in 1640. England had a moderate\npopulation, a very improved agriculture, a rich commerce; yet she was\non the eve of the greatest and most violent changes that she has as yet\nexperienced.'\n\n'That was a religious movement.'\n\n'Admit it; the cause, then, was not physical. The imagination of England\nrose against the government. It proves, then, that when that faculty is\nastir in a nation, it will sacrifice even physical comfort to follow its\nimpulses.'\n\n'Do you think, then, there is a wild desire for extensive political\nchange in the country?'\n\n'Hardly that: England is perplexed at the present moment, not inventive.\nThat will be the next phasis in her moral state, and to that I wish\nto draw your thoughts. For myself, while I ascribe little influence to\nphysical causes for the production of this perplexity, I am still less\nof opinion that it can be removed by any new disposition of political\npower. It would only aggravate the evil. That would be recurring to\nthe old error of supposing you can necessarily find national content in\npolitical institutions. A political institution is a machine; the motive\npower is the national character. With that it rests whether the\nmachine will benefit society, or destroy it. Society in this country is\nperplexed, almost paralysed; in time it will move, and it will devise.\nHow are the elements of the nation to be again blended together? In what\nspirit is that reorganisation to take place?'\n\n'To know that would be to know everything.'\n\n'At least let us free ourselves from the double ignorance of the\nPlatonists. Let us not be ignorant that we are ignorant.'\n\n'I have emancipated myself from that darkness for a long time, 'said\nConingsby. 'Long has my mind been musing over these thoughts, but to me\nall is still obscurity.'\n\n'In this country,' said Sidonia, 'since the peace, there has been an\nattempt to advocate a reconstruction of society on a purely rational\nbasis. The principle of Utility has been powerfully developed. I speak\nnot with lightness of the labours of the disciples of that school. I bow\nto intellect in every form: and we should be grateful to any school of\nphilosophers, even if we disagree with them; doubly grateful in this\ncountry, where for so long a period our statesmen were in so pitiable an\narrear of public intelligence. There has been an attempt to reconstruct\nsociety on a basis of material motives and calculations. It has failed.\nIt must ultimately have failed under any circumstances; its failure in\nan ancient and densely-peopled kingdom was inevitable. How limited is\nhuman reason, the profoundest inquirers are most conscious. We are not\nindebted to the Reason of man for any of the great achievements which\nare the landmarks of human action and human progress. It was not Reason\nthat besieged Troy; it was not Reason that sent forth the Saracen\nfrom the Desert to conquer the world; that inspired the Crusades; that\ninstituted the Monastic orders; it was not Reason that produced\nthe Jesuits; above all, it was not Reason that created the French\nRevolution. Man is only truly great when he acts from the passions;\nnever irresistible but when he appeals to the imagination. Even Mormon\ncounts more votaries than Bentham.'\n\n'And you think, then, that as Imagination once subdued the State,\nImagination may now save it?'\n\n'Man is made to adore and to obey: but if you will not command him, if\nyou give him nothing to worship, he will fashion his own divinities, and\nfind a chieftain in his own passions.'\n\n'But where can we find faith in a nation of sectaries? Who can feel\nloyalty to a sovereign of Downing Street?'\n\n'I speak of the eternal principles of human nature, you answer me with\nthe passing accidents of the hour. Sects rise and sects disappear. Where\nare the Fifth-Monarchy men? England is governed by Downing Street; once\nit was governed by Alfred and Elizabeth.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nAbout this time a steeple-chase in the West of England had attracted\nconsiderable attention. This sport was then of recent introduction in\nEngland, and is, in fact, an importation of Irish growth, although it\nhas flourished in our soil. A young guardsman, who was then a guest at\nthe Castle, and who had been in garrison in Ireland, had some experience\nof this pastime in the Kildare country, and he proposed that they should\nhave a steeple-chase at Coningsby. This was a suggestion very agreeable\nto the Marquess of Beaumanoir, celebrated for his feats of horsemanship,\nand, indeed, to most of the guests. It was agreed that the race should\ncome off at once, before any of the present company, many of whom\ngave symptoms of being on the wing, had quitted the Castle. The young\nguardsman and Mr. Guy Flouncey had surveyed the country and had selected\na line which they esteemed very appropriate for the scene of action.\nFrom a hill of common land you looked down upon the valley of Coningsby,\nrichly cultivated, deeply ditched, and stiffly fenced; the valley was\nbounded by another rising ground, and the scene was admirably calculated\nto give an extensive view to a multitude.\n\nThe distance along the valley was to be two miles out, and home again;\nthe starting-post being also the winning-post, and the flags, which were\nplaced on every fence which the horses were to pass, were to be passed\non the left hand of the rider both going and coming; so that although\nthe horses had to leap the same fences forward and backward, they\ncould not come over the same place twice. In the last field before they\nturned, was a brook seventeen feet clear from side to side, with good\ntaking off both banks. Here real business commenced.\n\nLord Monmouth highly approved the scheme, but mentioned that the stakes\nmust be moderate, and open to the whole county. The neighbourhood had\na week of preparation, and the entries for the Coningsby steeple-chase\nwere numerous. Lord Monmouth, after a reserve for his own account,\nplaced his stable at the service of his guests. For himself, he offered\nto back his horse, Sir Robert, which was to be ridden by his grandson.\n\nNow, nothing was spoken or thought of at Coningsby Castle except the\ncoming sport. The ladies shared the general excitement. They embroidered\nhandkerchiefs, and scarfs, and gloves, with the respective colours of\nthe rivals, and tried to make jockey-caps. Lady St. Julians postponed\nher intended departure in consequence. Madame Colonna wished that some\nmeans could be contrived by which they might all win.\n\nSidonia, with the other competitors, had ridden over the ground and\nglanced at the brook with the eye of a workman. On his return to the\nCastle he sent a despatch for some of his stud.\n\nConingsby was all anxiety to win. He was proud of the confidence of\nhis grandfather in backing him. He had a powerful horse and a firstrate\nfencer, and he was resolved himself not to flinch. On the night before\nthe race, retiring somewhat earlier than usual to his chamber, he\nobserved on his dressing-table a small packet addressed to his name, and\nin an unknown handwriting. Opening it, he found a pretty racing-jacket\nembroidered with his colours of pink and white. This was a perplexing\ncircumstance, but he fancied it on the whole a happy omen. And who was\nthe donor? Certainly not the Princess Lucretia, for he had observed her\nfashioning some maroon ribbons, which were the colours of Sidonia. It\ncould scarcely be from Mrs. Guy Flouncey. Perhaps Madame Colonna to\nplease the Marquess? Thinking over this incident he fell asleep.\n\nThe morning before the race Sidonia's horses arrived. All went to\nexamine them at the stables. Among them was an Arab mare. Coningsby\nrecognised the Daughter of the Star. She was greatly admired for her\npoints; but Guy Flouncey whispered to Mr. Melton that she never could do\nthe work.\n\n'But Lord Beaumanoir says he is all for speed against strength in these\naffairs,' said Mr. Melton.\n\nGuy Flouncey smiled incredulously.\n\nThe night before the race it rained rather heavily.\n\n'I take it the country will not be very like the Deserts of Arabia,'\nsaid Mr. Guy Flouncey, with a knowing look to Mr. Melton, who was noting\na bet in his memorandum-book.\n\nThe morning was fine, clear, and sunny, with a soft western breeze. The\nstarting-post was about three miles from the Castle; but, long before\nthe hour, the surrounding hills were covered with people; squire and\nfarmer; with no lack of their wives and daughters; many a hind in his\nsmock-frock, and many an 'operative' from the neighbouring factories.\nThe 'gentlemen riders' gradually arrived. The entries were very\nnumerous, though it was understood that not more than a dozen would\ncome to the post, and half of these were the guests of Lord Monmouth.\nAt half-past one the _cort\u00c3\u00a8ge_ from the Castle arrived, and took up the\npost which had been prepared for them on the summit of the hill. Lord\nMonmouth was much cheered on his arrival. In the carriage with him\nwere Madame Colonna and Lady St. Julians. The Princess Lucretia, Lady\nGaythorp, Mrs. Guy Flouncey, accompanied by Lord Eskdale and other\ncavaliers, formed a brilliant company. There was scarcely a domestic\nin the Castle who was not there. The comedians, indeed, did not care to\ncome, but Villebecque prevailed upon Flora to drive with him to the race\nin a buggy he borrowed of the steward.\n\nThe start was to be at two o'clock. The 'gentlemen jockeys' are\nmustered. Never were riders mounted and appointed in better style. The\nstewards and the clerk of the course attend them to the starting-post.\nThere they are now assembled. Guy Flouncey takes up his stirrup-leathers\na hole; Mr. Melton looks at his girths. In a few moments, the\nirrevocable monosyllable will be uttered.\n\nThe bugle sounds for them to face about; the clerk of the course sings\nout, 'Gentlemen, are you all ready?' No objection made, the word given\nto go, and fifteen riders start in excellent style.\n\nPrince Colonna, who rode like Prince Rupert, took the lead, followed\nclose by a stout yeoman on an old white horse of great provincial\ncelebrity, who made steady running, and, from his appearance and action,\nan awkward customer. The rest, with two exceptions, followed in a\ncluster at no great distance, and in this order they continued, with\nvery slight variation, for the first two miles, though there were\nseveral ox-fences, and one or two of them remarkably stiff. Indeed, they\nappeared more like horses running over a course than over a country. The\ntwo exceptions were Lord Beaumanoir on his horse Sunbeam, and Sidonia on\nthe Arab. These kept somewhat slightly in the rear.\n\nAlmost in this wise they approached the dreaded brook. Indeed, with the\nexception of the last two riders, who were about thirty yards behind, it\nseemed that you might have covered the rest of the field with a sheet.\nThey arrived at the brook at the same moment: seventeen feet of water\nbetween strong sound banks is no holiday work; but they charged with\nunfaltering intrepidity. But what a revolution in their spirited order\ndid that instant produce! A masked battery of canister and grape could\nnot have achieved more terrible execution. Coningsby alone clearly\nlighted on the opposing bank; but, for the rest of them, it seemed for a\nmoment that they were all in the middle of the brook, one over another,\nsplashing, kicking, swearing; every one trying to get out and keep\nothers in. Mr. Melton and the stout yeoman regained their saddles and\nwere soon again in chase. The Prince lost his horse, and was not alone\nin his misfortune. Mr. Guy Flouncey lay on his back with a horse across\nhis diaphragm; only his head above the water, and his mouth full of\nchickweed and dockleaves. And if help had not been at hand, he and\nseveral others might have remained struggling in their watery bed for\na considerable period. In the midst of this turmoil, the Marquess and\nSidonia at the same moment cleared the brook.\n\nAffairs now became interesting. Here Coningsby took up the running,\nSidonia and the Marquess lying close at his quarters. Mr. Melton had\ngone the wrong side of a flag, and the stout yeoman, though close at\nhand, was already trusting much to his spurs. In the extreme distance\nmight be detected three or four stragglers. Thus they continued until\nwithin three fields of home. A ploughed field finished the old white\nhorse; the yeoman struck his spurs to the rowels, but the only effect\nof the experiment was, that the horse stood stock-still. Coningsby,\nSidonia, and the Marquess were now all together. The winning-post is in\nsight, and a high and strong gate leads to the last field. Coningsby,\nlooking like a winner, gallantly dashed forward and sent Sir Robert at\nthe gate, but he had over-estimated his horse's powers at this point of\nthe game, and a rattling fall was the consequence: however, horse and\nrider were both on the right side, and Coningsby was in his saddle and\nat work again in a moment. It seemed that the Marquess was winning.\nThere was only one more fence; and that the foot people had made a\nbreach in by the side of a gate-post, and wide enough, as was said, for\na broad-wheeled waggon to travel by. Instead of passing straight over\nthis gap, Sunbeam swerved against the gate and threw his rider. This\nwas decisive. The Daughter of the Star, who was still going beautifully,\npulling double, and her jockey sitting still, sprang over the gap\nand went in first; Coningsby, on Sir Robert, being placed second. The\ndistance measured was about four miles; there were thirty-nine leaps;\nand it was done under fifteen minutes.\n\nLord Monmouth was well content with the prowess of his grandson, and\nhis extreme cordiality consoled Coningsby under a defeat which was very\nvexatious. It was some alleviation that he was beaten by Sidonia.\nMadame Colonna even shed tears at her young friend's disappointment, and\nmourned it especially for Lucretia, who had said nothing, though a flush\nmight be observed on her usually pale countenance. Villebecque, who had\nbetted, was so extremely excited by the whole affair, especially during\nthe last three minutes, that he quite forgot his quiet companion, and\nwhen he looked round he found Flora fainting.\n\n'You rode well,' said Sidonia to Coningsby; 'but your horse was more\nstrong than swift. After all, this thing is a race; and, notwithstanding\nSolomon, in a race speed must win.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the fatigues of the morning, the evening was passed with\ngreat gaiety at the Castle. The gentlemen all vowed that, far from being\ninconvenienced by their mishaps, they felt, on the whole, rather better\nfor them. Mr. Guy Flouncey, indeed, did not seem quite so limber\nand flexible as usual; and the young guardsman, who had previously\ndiscoursed in an almost alarming style of the perils and feats of the\nKildare country, had subsided into a remarkable reserve. The Provincials\nwere delighted with Sidonia's riding, and even the Leicestershire\ngentlemen admitted that he was a 'customer.'\n\nLord Monmouth beckoned to Coningsby to sit by him on the sofa, and spoke\nof his approaching University life. He gave his grandson a great deal of\ngood advice: told him to avoid drinking, especially if he ever chanced\nto play cards, which he hoped he never would; urged the expediency of\nnever borrowing money, and of confining his loans to small sums, and\nthen only to friends of whom he wished to get rid; most particularly\nimpressed on him never to permit his feelings to be engaged by any\nwoman; nobody, he assured Coningsby, despised that weakness more than\nwomen themselves. Indeed, feeling of any kind did not suit the present\nage: it was not _bon ton_; and in some degree always made a man\nridiculous. Coningsby was always to have before him the possible\ncatastrophe of becoming ridiculous. It was the test of conduct, Lord\nMonmouth said; a fear of becoming ridiculous is the best guide in life,\nand will save a man from all sorts of scrapes. For the rest, Coningsby\nwas to appear at Cambridge as became Lord Monmouth's favourite grandson.\nHis grandfather had opened an account for him with Drummonds', on whom\nhe was to draw for his considerable allowance; and if by any chance he\nfound himself in a scrape, no matter of what kind, he was to be sure to\nwrite to his grandfather, who would certainly get him out of it.\n\n'Your departure is sudden,' said the Princess Lucretia, in a low deep\ntone to Sidonia, who was sitting by her side and screened from general\nobservation by the waltzers who whirled by.\n\n'Departures should be sudden.'\n\n'I do not like departures,' said the Princess.\n\n'Nor did the Queen of Sheba when she quitted Solomon. You know what she\ndid?'\n\n'Tell me.'\n\n'She wept very much, and let one of the King's birds fly into the\ngarden. \"You are freed from your cage,\" she said; \"but I am going back\nto mine.\"'\n\n'But you never weep?' said the Princess.\n\n'Never.'\n\n'And are always free?'\n\n'So are men in the Desert.'\n\n'But your life is not a Desert?'\n\n'It at least resembles the Desert in one respect: it is useless.'\n\n'The only useless life is woman's.'\n\n'Yet there have been heroines,' said Sidonia.\n\n'The Queen of Sheba,' said the Princess, smiling.\n\n'A favourite of mine,' said Sidonia.\n\n'And why was she a favourite of yours?' rather eagerly inquired\nLucretia.\n\n'Because she thought deeply, talked finely, and moved gracefully.'\n\n'And yet might be a very unfeeling dame at the same time,' said the\nPrincess.\n\n'I never thought of that,' said Sidonia.\n\n'The heart, apparently, does not reckon in your philosophy.'\n\n'What we call the heart,' said Sidonia, 'is a nervous sensation, like\nshyness, which gradually disappears in society. It is fervent in the\nnursery, strong in the domestic circle, tumultuous at school. The\naffections are the children of ignorance; when the horizon of\nour experience expands, and models multiply, love and admiration\nimperceptibly vanish.'\n\n'I fear the horizon of your experience has very greatly expanded. With\nyour opinions, what charm can there be in life?'\n\n'The sense of existence.'\n\n'So Sidonia is off to-morrow, Monmouth,' said Lord Eskdale.\n\n'Hah!' said the Marquess. 'I must get him to breakfast with me before he\ngoes.'\n\nThe party broke up. Coningsby, who had heard Lord Eskdale announce\nSidonia's departure, lingered to express his regret, and say farewell.\n\n'I cannot sleep,' said Sidonia, 'and I never smoke in Europe. If you are\nnot stiff with your wounds, come to my rooms.'\n\nThis invitation was willingly accepted.\n\n'I am going to Cambridge in a week,' said Coningsby. I was almost in\nhopes you might have remained as long.'\n\n'I also; but my letters of this morning demand me. If it had not been\nfor our chase, I should have quitted immediately. The minister\ncannot pay the interest on the national debt; not an unprecedented\ncircumstance, and has applied to us. I never permit any business of\nState to be transacted without my personal interposition; and so I must\ngo up to town immediately.'\n\n'Suppose you don't pay it,' said Coningsby, smiling.\n\n'If I followed my own impulse, I would remain here,' said Sidonia. 'Can\nanything be more absurd than that a nation should apply to an individual\nto maintain its credit, and, with its credit, its existence as an\nempire, and its comfort as a people; and that individual one to whom its\nlaws deny the proudest rights of citizenship, the privilege of sitting\nin its senate and of holding land? for though I have been rash enough\nto buy several estates, my own opinion is, that, by the existing law of\nEngland, an Englishman of Hebrew faith cannot possess the soil.'\n\n'But surely it would be easy to repeal a law so illiberal--'\n\n'Oh! as for illiberality, I have no objection to it if it be an element\nof power. Eschew political sentimentalism. What I contend is, that if\nyou permit men to accumulate property, and they use that permission to a\ngreat extent, power is inseparable from that property, and it is in the\nlast degree impolitic to make it the interest of any powerful class to\noppose the institutions under which they live. The Jews, for example,\nindependently of the capital qualities for citizenship which they\npossess in their industry, temperance, and energy and vivacity of mind,\nare a race essentially monarchical, deeply religious, and shrinking\nthemselves from converts as from a calamity, are ever anxious to see\nthe religious systems of the countries in which they live flourish;\nyet, since your society has become agitated in England, and powerful\ncombinations menace your institutions, you find the once loyal\nHebrew invariably arrayed in the same ranks as the leveller, and the\nlatitudinarian, and prepared to support the policy which may even\nendanger his life and property, rather than tamely continue under a\nsystem which seeks to degrade him. The Tories lose an important election\nat a critical moment; 'tis the Jews come forward to vote against them.\nThe Church is alarmed at the scheme of a latitudinarian university, and\nlearns with relief that funds are not forthcoming for its establishment;\na Jew immediately advances and endows it. Yet the Jews, Coningsby,\nare essentially Tories. Toryism, indeed, is but copied from the mighty\nprototype which has fashioned Europe. And every generation they must\nbecome more powerful and more dangerous to the society which is hostile\nto them. Do you think that the quiet humdrum persecution of a decorous\nrepresentative of an English university can crush those who have\nsuccessively baffled the Pharaohs, Nebuchadnezzar, Rome, and the Feudal\nages? The fact is, you cannot destroy a pure race of the Caucasian\norganisation. It is a physiological fact; a simple law of nature, which\nhas baffled Egyptian and Assyrian Kings, Roman Emperors, and Christian\nInquisitors. No penal laws, no physical tortures, can effect that a\nsuperior race should be absorbed in an inferior, or be destroyed by it.\nThe mixed persecuting races disappear; the pure persecuted race remains.\nAnd at this moment, in spite of centuries, of tens of centuries, of\ndegradation, the Jewish mind exercises a vast influence on the affairs\nof Europe. I speak not of their laws, which you still obey; of their\nliterature, with which your minds are saturated; but of the living\nHebrew intellect.\n\n'You never observe a great intellectual movement in Europe in which\nthe Jews do not greatly participate. The first Jesuits were Jews; that\nmysterious Russian Diplomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organised\nand principally carried on by Jews; that mighty revolution which is at\nthis moment preparing in Germany, and which will be, in fact, a second\nand greater Reformation, and of which so little is as yet known in\nEngland, is entirely developing under the auspices of Jews, who almost\nmonopolise the professorial chairs of Germany. Neander, the founder of\nSpiritual Christianity, and who is Regius Professor of Divinity in the\nUniversity of Berlin, is a Jew. Benary, equally famous, and in the same\nUniversity, is a Jew. Wehl, the Arabic Professor of Heidelberg, is a\nJew. Years ago, when I was In Palestine, I met a German student who was\naccumulating materials for the History of Christianity, and studying\nthe genius of the place; a modest and learned man. It was Wehl; then\nunknown, since become the first Arabic scholar of the day, and the\nauthor of the life of Mahomet. But for the German professors of this\nrace, their name is Legion. I think there are more than ten at Berlin\nalone.\n\n'I told you just now that I was going up to town tomorrow, because I\nalways made it a rule to interpose when affairs of State were on\nthe carpet. Otherwise, I never interfere. I hear of peace and war in\nnewspapers, but I am never alarmed, except when I am informed that the\nSovereigns want treasure; then I know that monarchs are serious.\n\n'A few years back we were applied, to by Russia. Now, there has been\nno friendship between the Court of St. Petersburg and my family. It\nhas Dutch connections, which have generally supplied it; and our\nrepresentations in favour of the Polish Hebrews, a numerous race, but\nthe most suffering and degraded of all the tribes, have not been very\nagreeable to the Czar. However, circumstances drew to an approximation\nbetween the Romanoffs and the Sidonias. I resolved to go myself to St.\nPetersburg. I had, on my arrival, an interview with the Russian Minister\nof Finance, Count Cancrin; I beheld the son of a Lithuanian Jew. The\nloan was connected with the affairs of Spain; I resolved on repairing to\nSpain from Russia. I travelled without intermission. I had an audience\nimmediately on my arrival with the Spanish Minister, Senor Mendizabel; I\nbeheld one like myself, the son of a Nuevo Christiano, a Jew of Arragon.\nIn consequence of what transpired at Madrid, I went straight to Paris\nto consult the President of the French Council; I beheld the son of a\nFrench Jew, a hero, an imperial marshal, and very properly so, for who\nshould be military heroes if not those who worship the Lord of Hosts?'\n\n'And is Soult a Hebrew?'\n\n'Yes, and others of the French marshals, and the most famous; Massena,\nfor example; his real name was Manasseh: but to my anecdote. The\nconsequence of our consultations was, that some Northern power should\nbe applied to in a friendly and mediative capacity. We fixed on Prussia;\nand the President of the Council made an application to the Prussian\nMinister, who attended a few days after our conference. Count Arnim\nentered the cabinet, and I beheld a Prussian Jew. So you see, my dear\nConingsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from\nwhat is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.'\n\n'You startle, and deeply interest me.'\n\n'You must study physiology, my dear child. Pure races of Caucasus may be\npersecuted, but they cannot be despised, except by the brutal ignorance\nof some mongrel breed, that brandishes fagots and howls extermination,\nbut is itself exterminated without persecution, by that irresistible law\nof Nature which is fatal to curs.'\n\n'But I come also from Caucasus,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Verily; and thank your Creator for such a destiny: and your race is\nsufficiently pure. You come from the shores of the Northern Sea, land\nof the blue eye, and the golden hair, and the frank brow: 'tis a\nfamous breed, with whom we Arabs have contended long; from whom we have\nsuffered much: but these Goths, and Saxons, and Normans were doubtless\ngreat men.'\n\n'But so favoured by Nature, why has not your race produced great poets,\ngreat orators, great writers?'\n\n'Favoured by Nature and by Nature's God, we produced the lyre of David;\nwe gave you Isaiah and Ezekiel; they are our Olynthians, our Philippics.\nFavoured by Nature we still remain: but in exact proportion as we have\nbeen favoured by Nature we have been persecuted by Man. After a thousand\nstruggles; after acts of heroic courage that Rome has never equalled;\ndeeds of divine patriotism that Athens, and Sparta, and Carthage have\nnever excelled; we have endured fifteen hundred years of supernatural\nslavery, during which, every device that can degrade or destroy man has\nbeen the destiny that we have sustained and baffled. The Hebrew child\nhas entered adolescence only to learn that he was the Pariah of that\nungrateful Europe that owes to him the best part of its laws, a fine\nportion of its literature, all its religion. Great poets require a\npublic; we have been content with the immortal melodies that we sung\nmore than two thousand years ago by the waters of Babylon and wept. They\nrecord our triumphs; they solace our affliction. Great orators are the\ncreatures of popular assemblies; we were permitted only by stealth to\nmeet even in our temples. And as for great writers, the catalogue is not\nblank. What are all the schoolmen, Aquinas himself, to Maimonides? And\nas for modern philosophy, all springs from Spinoza.\n\n'But the passionate and creative genius, that is the nearest link to\nDivinity, and which no human tyranny can destroy, though it can divert\nit; that should have stirred the hearts of nations by its inspired\nsympathy, or governed senates by its burning eloquence; has found a\nmedium for its expression, to which, in spite of your prejudices and\nyour evil passions, you have been obliged to bow. The ear, the voice,\nthe fancy teeming with combinations, the imagination fervent with\npicture and emotion, that came from Caucasus, and which we have\npreserved unpolluted, have endowed us with almost the exclusive\nprivilege of Music; that science of harmonious sounds, which the\nancients recognised as most divine, and deified in the person of their\nmost beautiful creation. I speak not of the past; though, were I to\nenter into the history of the lords of melody, you would find it the\nannals of Hebrew genius. But at this moment even, musical Europe is\nours. There is not a company of singers, not an orchestra in a single\ncapital, that is not crowded with our children under the feigned names\nwhich they adopt to conciliate the dark aversion which your posterity\nwill some day disclaim with shame and disgust. Almost every great\ncomposer, skilled musician, almost every voice that ravishes you with\nits transporting strains, springs from our tribes. The catalogue is too\nvast to enumerate; too illustrious to dwell for a moment on secondary\nnames, however eminent. Enough for us that the three great creative\nminds to whose exquisite inventions all nations at this moment yield,\nRossini, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, are of Hebrew race; and little do your\nmen of fashion, your muscadins of Paris, and your dandies of London, as\nthey thrill into raptures at the notes of a Pasta or a Grisi, little do\nthey suspect that they are offering their homage to \"the sweet singers\nof Israel!\"'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nIt was the noon of the day on which Sidonia was to leave the Castle. The\nwind was high; the vast white clouds scudded over the blue heaven; the\nleaves yet green, and tender branches snapped like glass, were whirled\nin eddies from the trees; the grassy sward undulated like the ocean with\na thousand tints and shadows. From the window of the music-room Lucretia\nColonna gazed on the turbulent sky.\n\nThe heaven of her heart, too, was disturbed.\n\nShe turned from the agitated external world to ponder over her inward\nemotion. She uttered a deep sigh.\n\nSlowly she moved towards her harp; wildly, almost unconsciously, she\ntouched with one hand its strings, while her eyes were fixed on the\nground. An imperfect melody resounded; yet plaintive and passionate. It\nseemed to attract her soul. She raised her head, and then, touching\nthe strings with both her hands, she poured forth tones of deep, yet\nthrilling power.\n\n  'I am a stranger in the halls of a stranger! Ah! whither shall I flee?\n  To the castle of my fathers in the green mountains; to the palace of my\n    fathers in the ancient city?\n  There is no flag on the castle of my fathers in the green mountains,\n    silent is the palace of my fathers in the ancient city.\n  Is there no home for the homeless? Can the unloved never find love?\n  Ah! thou fliest away, fleet cloud: he will leave us swifter than thee!\n    Alas! cutting wind, thy breath is not so cold as his heart!\n  I am a stranger in the halls of a stranger! Ah! whither shall I flee?'\n\nThe door of the music-room slowly opened. It was Sidonia. His hat was in\nhis hand; he was evidently on the point of departure.\n\n'Those sounds assured me,' he said calmly but kindly, as he advanced,\n'that I might find you here, on which I scarcely counted at so early an\nhour.'\n\n'You are going then?' said the Princess.\n\n'My carriage is at the door; the Marquess has delayed me; I must be in\nLondon to-night. I conclude more abruptly than I could have wished one\nof the most agreeable visits I ever made; and I hope you will permit\nme to express to you how much I am indebted to you for a society which\nthose should deem themselves fortunate who can more frequently enjoy.'\n\nHe held forth his hand; she extended hers, cold as marble, which he bent\nover, but did not press to his lips.\n\n'Lord Monmouth talks of remaining here some time,' he observed; 'but I\nsuppose next year, if not this, we shall all meet in some city of the\nearth?'\n\nLucretia bowed; and Sidonia, with a graceful reverence, withdrew.\n\nThe Princess Lucretia stood for some moments motionless; a sound\nattracted her to the window; she perceived the equipage of Sidonia\nwhirling along the winding roads of the park. She watched it till it\ndisappeared; then quitting the window, she threw herself into a chair,\nand buried her face in her shawl.\n\nEND OF BOOK IV.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nAn University life did not bring to Coningsby that feeling of\nemancipation usually experienced by freshmen. The contrast between\nschool and college life is perhaps, under any circumstances, less\nstriking to the Etonian than to others: he has been prepared for\nbecoming his own master by the liberty wisely entrusted to him in his\nboyhood, and which is, in general, discreetly exercised. But there were\nalso other reasons why Coningsby should have been less impressed with\nthe novelty of his life, and have encountered less temptations than\ncommonly are met with in the new existence which an University opens to\nyouth. In the interval which had elapsed between quitting Eton and going\nto Cambridge, brief as the period may comparatively appear, Coningsby\nhad seen much of the world. Three or four months, indeed, may not seem,\nat the first blush, a course of time which can very materially influence\nthe formation of character; but time must not be counted by calendars,\nbut by sensations, by thought. Coningsby had felt a good deal, reflected\nmore. He had encountered a great number of human beings, offering a vast\nvariety of character for his observation. It was not merely manners, but\neven the intellectual and moral development of the human mind, which\nin a great degree, unconsciously to himself, had been submitted to his\nstudy and his scrutiny. New trains of ideas had been opened to him; his\nmind was teeming with suggestions. The horizon of his intelligence had\ninsensibly expanded. He perceived that there were other opinions in the\nworld, besides those to which he had been habituated. The depths of his\nintellect had been stirred. He was a wiser man.\n\nHe distinguished three individuals whose acquaintance had greatly\ninfluenced his mind; Eustace Lyle, the elder Millbank, above all,\nSidonia. He curiously meditated over the fact, that three English\nsubjects, one of them a principal landed proprietor, another one of the\nmost eminent manufacturers, and the third the greatest capitalist in the\nkingdom, all of them men of great intelligence, and doubtless of a\nhigh probity and conscience, were in their hearts disaffected with the\npolitical constitution of the country. Yet, unquestionably, these were\nthe men among whom we ought to seek for some of our first citizens.\nWhat, then, was this repulsive quality in those institutions which we\npersisted in calling national, and which once were so? Here was a great\nquestion.\n\nThere was another reason, also, why Coningsby should feel a little\nfastidious among his new habits, and, without being aware of it, a\nlittle depressed. For three or four months, and for the first time in\nhis life, he had passed his time in the continual society of refined and\ncharming women. It is an acquaintance which, when habitual, exercises a\ngreat influence over the tone of the mind, even if it does not produce\nany more violent effects. It refines the taste, quickens the perception,\nand gives, as it were, a grace and flexibility to the intellect.\nConingsby in his solitary rooms arranging his books, sighed when he\nrecalled the Lady Everinghams and the Lady Theresas; the gracious\nDuchess; the frank, good-natured Madame Colonna; that deeply interesting\nenigma the Princess Lucretia; and the gentle Flora. He thought with\ndisgust of the impending dissipation of an University, which could only\nbe an exaggeration of their coarse frolics at school. It seemed rather\nvapid this mighty Cambridge, over which they had so often talked in\nthe playing fields of Eton, with such anticipations of its vast and\nabsorbing interest. And those University honours that once were the\ngreat object of his aspirations, they did not figure in that grandeur\nwith which they once haunted his imagination.\n\nWhat Coningsby determined to conquer was knowledge. He had watched the\ninfluence of Sidonia in society with an eye of unceasing vigilance.\nConingsby perceived that all yielded to him; that Lord Monmouth even,\nwho seemed to respect none, gave place to his intelligence; appealed\nto him, listened to him, was guided by him. What was the secret of this\ninfluence? Knowledge. On all subjects, his views were prompt and clear,\nand this not more from his native sagacity and reach of view, than from\nthe aggregate of facts which rose to guide his judgment and illustrate\nhis meaning, from all countries and all ages, instantly at his command.\n\nThe friends of Coningsby were now hourly arriving. It seemed when he\nmet them again, that they had all suddenly become men since they had\nseparated; Buckhurst especially. He had been at Paris, and returned with\nhis mind very much opened, and trousers made quite in a new style. All\nhis thoughts were, how soon he could contrive to get back again; and\nhe told them endless stories of actresses, and dinners at fashionable\n_caf\u00c3\u00a9s_. Vere enjoyed Cambridge most, because he had been staying\nwith his family since he quitted Eton. Henry Sydney was full of\nchurch architecture, national sports, restoration of the order of the\nPeasantry, and was to maintain a constant correspondence on these and\nsimilar subjects with Eustace Lyle. Finally, however, they all fell into\na very fair, regular, routine life. They all read a little, but not\nwith the enthusiasm which they had once projected. Buckhurst drove\nfour-in-hand, and they all of them sometimes assisted him; but not\nimmoderately. Their suppers were sometimes gay, but never outrageous;\nand, among all of them, the school friendship was maintained unbroken,\nand even undisturbed.\n\nThe fame of Coningsby preceded him at Cambridge. No man ever went up\nfrom whom more was expected in every way. The dons awaited a sucking\nmember for the University, the undergraduates were prepared to welcome\na new Alcibiades. He was neither: neither a prig nor a profligate; but\na quiet, gentlemanlike, yet spirited young man, gracious to all, but\nintimate only with his old friends, and giving always an impression in\nhis general tone that his soul was not absorbed in his University.\n\nAnd yet, perhaps, he might have been coddled into a prig, or flattered\ninto a profligate, had it not been for the intervening experience which\nhe had gained between his school and college life. That had visibly\nimpressed upon him, what before he had only faintly acquired from books,\nthat there was a greater and more real world awaiting him, than to be\nfound in those bowers of Academus to which youth is apt at first to\nattribute an exaggerated importance. A world of action and passion,\nof power and peril; a world for which a great preparation was indeed\nnecessary, severe and profound, but not altogether such an one as was\nnow offered to him. Yet this want must be supplied, and by himself.\nConingsby had already acquirements sufficiently considerable, with some\nformal application, to ensure him at all times his degree. He was no\nlonger engrossed by the intention he once proudly entertained of trying\nfor honours, and he chalked out for himself that range of reading,\nwhich, digested by his thought, should furnish him in some degree with\nthat various knowledge of the history of man to which he aspired. No, we\nmust not for a moment believe that accident could have long diverted\nthe course of a character so strong. The same desire that prevented the\nCastle of his grandfather from proving a Castle of Indolence to\nhim, that saved him from a too early initiation into the seductive\ndistractions of a refined and luxurious society, would have preserved\nConingsby from the puerile profligacy of a college life, or from being\nthat idol of private tutors, a young pedant. It was that noble ambition,\nthe highest and the best, that must be born in the heart and organised\nin the brain, which will not let a man be content, unless his\nintellectual power is recognised by his race, and desires that it should\ncontribute to their welfare. It is the heroic feeling; the feeling that\nin old days produced demigods; without which no State is safe; without\nwhich political institutions are meat without salt; the Crown a\nbauble, the Church an establishment, Parliaments debating-clubs, and\nCivilisation itself but a fitful and transient dream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nLess than a year after the arrival of Coningsby at Cambridge, and which\nhe had only once quitted in the interval, and that to pass a short\ntime in Berkshire with his friend Buckhurst, occurred the death of\nKing William IV. This event necessarily induced a dissolution of the\nParliament, elected under the auspices of Sir Robert Peel in 1834, and\nafter the publication of the Tamworth Manifesto.\n\nThe death of the King was a great blow to what had now come to be\ngenerally styled the 'Conservative Cause.' It was quite unexpected;\nwithin a fortnight of his death, eminent persons still believed that\n'it was only the hay-fever.' Had his Majesty lived until after the then\nimpending registration, the Whigs would have been again dismissed. Nor\nis there any doubt that, under these circumstances, the Conservative\nCause would have secured for the new ministers a parliamentary majority.\nWhat would have been the consequences to the country, if the four years\nof Whig rule, from 1837 to 1841, had not occurred? It is easier to\ndecide what would have been the consequences to the Whigs. Some of their\ngreat friends might have lacked blue ribbons and lord-lieutenancies,\nand some of their little friends comfortable places in the Customs and\nExcise. They would have lost, undoubtedly, the distribution of four\nyears' patronage; we can hardly say the exercise of four years' power;\nbut they would have existed at this moment as the most powerful and\npopular Opposition that ever flourished in this country, if, indeed, the\ncourse of events had not long ere this carried them back to their old\nposts in a proud and intelligible position. The Reform Bill did not\ndo more injury to the Tories, than the attempt to govern this country\nwithout a decided Parliamentary majority did the Whigs. The greatest of\nall evils is a weak government. They cannot carry good measures, they\nare forced to carry bad ones.\n\nThe death of the King was a great blow to the Conservative Cause; that\nis to say, it darkened the brow of Tadpole, quailed the heart of Taper,\ncrushed all the rising hopes of those numerous statesmen who believe\nthe country must be saved if they receive twelve hundred a-year. It is a\npeculiar class, that; 1,200_l._ per annum, paid quarterly, is their idea\nof political science and human nature. To receive 1,200_l._ per annum is\ngovernment; to try to receive 1,200_l._ per annum is opposition; to wish\nto receive 1,200_l._ per annum is ambition. If a man wants to get into\nParliament, and does not want to get 1,200_l._ per annum, they look upon\nhim as daft; as a benighted being. They stare in each other's face,\nand ask, 'What can ***** want to get into Parliament for?' They have no\nconception that public reputation is a motive power, and with many men\nthe greatest. They have as much idea of fame or celebrity, even of the\nmasculine impulse of an honourable pride, as eunuchs of manly joys.\n\nThe twelve-hundred-a-yearers were in despair about the King's death.\nTheir loyal souls were sorely grieved that his gracious Majesty had not\noutlived the Registration. All their happy inventions about 'hay-fever,'\ncirculated in confidence, and sent by post to chairmen of Conservative\nAssociations, followed by a royal funeral! General election about to\ntake place with the old registration; government boroughs against them,\nand the young Queen for a cry. What a cry! Youth, beauty, and a Queen!\nTaper grew pale at the thought. What could they possibly get up to\ncountervail it? Even Church and Corn-laws together would not do; and\nthen Church was sulky, for the Conservative Cause had just made it a\npresent of a commission, and all that the country gentlemen knew of\nConservatism was, that it would not repeal the Malt Tax, and had made\nthem repeal their pledges. Yet a cry must be found. A dissolution\nwithout a cry, in the Taper philosophy, would be a world without a sun.\nA rise might be got by 'Independence of the House of Lords;' and Lord\nLyndhurst's summaries might be well circulated at one penny per hundred,\nlarge discount allowed to Conservative Associations, and endless credit.\nTadpole, however, was never very fond of the House of Lords; besides, it\nwas too limited. Tadpole wanted the young Queen brought in; the rogue!\nAt length, one morning, Taper came up to him with a slip of paper, and a\nsmile of complacent austerity on his dull visage, 'I think, Mr. Tadpole,\nthat will do!'\n\nTadpole took the paper and read, 'OUR YOUNG QUEEN, AND OUR OLD\nINSTITUTIONS.'\n\nThe eyes of Tadpole sparkled as if they had met a gnomic sentence of\nPeriander or Thales; then turning to Taper, he said,\n\n'What do you think of \"ancient,\" instead of \"old\"?'\n\n'You cannot have \"Our modern Queen and our ancient Institutions,\"' said\nMr. Taper.\n\nThe dissolution was soon followed by an election for the borough of\nCambridge. The Conservative Cause candidate was an old Etonian. That was\na bond of sympathy which imparted zeal even to those who were a little\nsceptical of the essential virtues of Conservatism. Every undergraduate\nespecially who remembered 'the distant spires,' became enthusiastic.\nBuckhurst took a very decided part. He cheered, he canvassed, he brought\nmen to the poll whom none could move; he influenced his friends and\nhis companions. Even Coningsby caught the contagion, and Vere, who had\nimbibed much of Coningsby's political sentiment, prevailed on himself to\nbe neutral. The Conservative Cause triumphed in the person of its Eton\nchampion. The day the member was chaired, several men in Coningsby's\nrooms were talking over their triumph.\n\n'By Jove!' said the panting Buckhurst, throwing himself on the sofa, 'it\nwas well done; never was any thing better done. An immense triumph! The\ngreatest triumph the Conservative Cause has had. And yet,' he added,\nlaughing, 'if any fellow were to ask me what the Conservative Cause is,\nI am sure I should not know what to say.'\n\n'Why, it is the cause of our glorious institutions,' said Coningsby. 'A\nCrown robbed of its prerogatives; a Church controlled by a commission;\nand an Aristocracy that does not lead.'\n\n'Under whose genial influence the order of the Peasantry, \"a country's\npride,\" has vanished from the face of the land,' said Henry Sydney, 'and\nis succeeded by a race of serfs, who are called labourers, and who burn\nricks.'\n\n'Under which,' continued Coningsby, 'the Crown has become a cipher; the\nChurch a sect; the Nobility drones; and the People drudges.'\n\n'It is the great constitutional cause,' said Lord Vere, 'that refuses\neverything to opposition; yields everything to agitation; conservative\nin Parliament, destructive out-of-doors; that has no objection to any\nchange provided only it be effected by unauthorised means.'\n\n'The first public association of men,' said Coningsby, 'who have worked\nfor an avowed end without enunciating a single principle.'\n\n'And who have established political infidelity throughout the land,'\nsaid Lord Henry.\n\n'By Jove!' said Buckhurst, 'what infernal fools we have made ourselves\nthis last week!'\n\n'Nay,' said Coningsby, smiling, 'it was our last schoolboy weakness.\nFloreat Etona, under all circumstances.'\n\n'I certainly, Coningsby,' said Lord Vere, 'shall not assume the\nConservative Cause, instead of the cause for which Hampden died in the\nfield, and Sydney on the scaffold.'\n\n'The cause for which Hampden died in the field and Sydney on the\nscaffold,' said Coningsby, 'was the cause of the Venetian Republic.'\n\n'How, how?' cried Buckhurst.\n\n'I repeat it,' said Coningsby. 'The great object of the Whig leaders\nin England from the first movement under Hampden to the last most\nsuccessful one in 1688, was to establish in England a high aristocratic\nrepublic on the model of the Venetian, then the study and admiration of\nall speculative politicians. Read Harrington; turn over Algernon\nSydney; then you will see how the minds of the English leaders in the\nseventeenth century were saturated with the Venetian type. And they at\nlength succeeded. William III. found them out. He told the Whig leaders,\n\"I will not be a Doge.\" He balanced parties; he baffled them as the\nPuritans baffled them fifty years before. The reign of Anne was a\nstruggle between the Venetian and the English systems. Two great Whig\nnobles, Argyle and Somerset, worthy of seats in the Council of Ten,\nforced their Sovereign on her deathbed to change the ministry. They\naccomplished their object. They brought in a new family on their own\nterms. George I. was a Doge; George II. was a Doge; they were what\nWilliam III., a great man, would not be. George III. tried not to be\na Doge, but it was impossible materially to resist the deeply-laid\ncombination. He might get rid of the Whig magnificoes, but he could not\nrid himself of the Venetian constitution. And a Venetian constitution\ndid govern England from the accession of the House of Hanover until\n1832. Now I do not ask you, Vere, to relinquish the political tenets\nwhich in ordinary times would have been your inheritance. All I say is,\nthe constitution introduced by your ancestors having been subverted by\ntheir descendants your contemporaries, beware of still holding Venetian\nprinciples of government when you have not a Venetian constitution to\ngovern with. Do what I am doing, what Henry Sydney and Buckhurst are\ndoing, what other men that I could mention are doing, hold yourself\naloof from political parties which, from the necessity of things, have\nceased to have distinctive principles, and are therefore practically\nonly factions; and wait and see, whether with patience, energy, honour,\nand Christian faith, and a desire to look to the national welfare and\nnot to sectional and limited interests; whether, I say, we may not\ndiscover some great principles to guide us, to which we may adhere, and\nwhich then, if true, will ultimately guide and control others.'\n\n'The Whigs are worn out,' said Vere, 'Conservatism is a sham, and\nRadicalism is pollution.'\n\n'I certainly,' said Buckhurst, 'when I get into the House of Commons,\nshall speak my mind without reference to any party whatever; and all\nI hope is, we may all come in at the same time, and then we may make a\nparty of our own.'\n\n'I have always heard my father say,' said Vere, 'that there was nothing\nso difficult as to organise an independent party in the House of\nCommons.'\n\n'Ay! but that was in the Venetian period, Vere,' said Henry Sydney,\nsmiling.\n\n'I dare say,' said Buckhurst, 'the only way to make a party in the\nHouse of Commons is just the one that succeeds anywhere else. Men must\nassociate together. When you are living in the same set, dining together\nevery day, and quizzing the Dons, it is astonishing how well men\nagree. As for me, I never would enter into a conspiracy, unless the\nconspirators were fellows who had been at Eton with me; and then there\nwould be no treachery.'\n\n'Let us think of principles, and not of parties,' said Coningsby.\n\n'For my part,' said Buckhurst, 'whenever a political system is breaking\nup, as in this country at present, I think the very best thing is to\nbrush all the old Dons off the stage. They never take to the new road\nkindly. They are always hampered by their exploded prejudices and\nobsolete traditions. I don't think a single man, Vere, that sat in the\nVenetian Senate ought to be allowed to sit in the present English House\nof Commons.'\n\n'Well, no one does in our family except my uncle Philip,' said Lord\nHenry; 'and the moment I want it, he will resign; for he detests\nParliament. It interferes so with his hunting.'\n\n'Well, we all have fair parliamentary prospects,' said Buckhurst. 'That\nis something. I wish we were in now.'\n\n'Heaven forbid!' said Coningsby. 'I tremble at the responsibility of a\nseat at any time. With my present unsettled and perplexed views, there\nis nothing from which I should recoil so much as the House of Commons.'\n\n'I quite agree with you,' said Henry Sydney. 'The best thing we can do\nis to keep as clear of political party as we possibly can. How many\nmen waste the best part of their lives in painfully apologising for\nconscientious deviation from a parliamentary course which they adopted\nwhen they were boys, without thought, or prompted by some local\nconnection, or interest, to secure a seat.'\n\nIt was the midnight following the morning when this conversation\ntook place, that Coningsby, alone, and having just quitted a rather\nboisterous party of wassailers who had been celebrating at Buckhurst's\nrooms the triumph of 'Eton Statesmen,' if not of Conservative\nprinciples, stopped in the precincts of that Royal College that reminded\nhim of his schooldays, to cool his brow in the summer air, that even\nat that hour was soft, and to calm his mind in the contemplation of the\nstill, the sacred, and the beauteous scene that surrounded him.\n\nThere rose that fane, the pride and boast of Cambridge, not unworthy\nto rank among the chief temples of Christendom. Its vast form was\nexaggerated in the uncertain hour; part shrouded in the deepest\ndarkness, while a flood of silver light suffused its southern side,\ndistinguished with revealing beam the huge ribs of its buttresses, and\nbathed with mild lustre its airy pinnacles.\n\n'Where is the spirit that raised these walls?' thought Coningsby. 'Is it\nindeed extinct? Is then this civilisation, so much vaunted, inseparable\nfrom moderate feelings and little thoughts? If so, give me back\nbarbarism! But I cannot believe it. Man that is made in the image of the\nCreator, is made for God-like deeds. Come what come may, I will cling to\nthe heroic principle. It can alone satisfy my soul.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nWe must now revert to the family, or rather the household, of Lord\nMonmouth, in which considerable changes and events had occurred since\nthe visit of Coningsby to the Castle in the preceding autumn.\n\nIn the first place, the earliest frost of the winter had carried off\nthe aged proprietor of Hellingsley, that contiguous estate which Lord\nMonmouth so much coveted, the possession of which was indeed one of the\nfew objects of his life, and to secure which he was prepared to pay\nfar beyond its intrinsic value, great as that undoubtedly was. Yet Lord\nMonmouth did not become its possessor. Long as his mind had been intent\nupon the subject, skilful as had been his combinations to secure his\nprey, and unlimited the means which were to achieve his purpose, another\nstepped in, and without his privity, without even the consolation of a\nstruggle, stole away the prize; and this too a man whom he hated, almost\nthe only individual out of his own family that he did hate; a man who\nhad crossed him before in similar enterprises; who was his avowed foe;\nhad lavished treasure to oppose him in elections; raised associations\nagainst his interest; established journals to assail him; denounced him\nin public; agitated against him in private; had declared more than\nonce that he would make 'the county too hot for him;' his personal,\ninveterate, indomitable foe, Mr. Millbank of Millbank.\n\nThe loss of Hellingsley was a bitter disappointment to Lord Monmouth;\nbut the loss of it to such an adversary touched him to the quick. He did\nnot seek to control his anger; he could not succeed even in concealing\nhis agitation. He threw upon Rigby that glance so rare with him, but\nunder which men always quailed; that play of the eye which Lord Monmouth\nshared in common with Henry VIII., that struck awe into the trembling\nCommons when they had given an obnoxious vote, as the King entered the\ngallery of his palace, and looked around him.\n\nIt was a look which implied that dreadful question, 'Why have I bought\nyou that such things should happen? Why have I unlimited means and\nunscrupulous agents?' It made Rigby even feel; even his brazen tones\nwere hushed.\n\nTo fly from everything disagreeable was the practical philosophy of Lord\nMonmouth; but he was as brave as he was sensual. He would not shrink\nbefore the new proprietor of Hellingsley. He therefore remained at\nthe Castle with an aching heart, and redoubled his hospitalities. An\nordinary mind might have been soothed by the unceasing consideration and\nthe skilful and delicate flattery that ever surrounded Lord Monmouth;\nbut his sagacious intelligence was never for a moment the dupe of his\nvanity. He had no self-love, and as he valued no one, there were really\nno feelings to play upon. He saw through everybody and everything; and\nwhen he had detected their purpose, discovered their weakness or their\nvileness, he calculated whether they could contribute to his pleasure\nor his convenience in a degree that counterbalanced the objections which\nmight be urged against their intentions, or their less pleasing and\nprofitable qualities. To be pleased was always a principal object with\nLord Monmouth; but when a man wants vengeance, gay amusement is not\nexactly a satisfactory substitute.\n\nA month elapsed. Lord Monmouth with a serene or smiling visage to his\nguests, but in private taciturn and morose, scarcely ever gave a word\nto Mr. Rigby, but continually bestowed on him glances which painfully\naffected the appetite of that gentleman. In a hundred ways it was\nintimated to Mr. Rigby that he was not a welcome guest, and yet\nsomething was continually given him to do which rendered it impossible\nfor him to take his departure. In this state of affairs, another event\noccurred which changed the current of feeling, and by its possible\nconsequences distracted the Marquess from his brooding meditations over\nhis discomfiture in the matter of Hellingsley. The Prince Colonna, who,\nsince the steeple-chase, had imbibed a morbid predilection for such\namusements, and indeed for every species of rough-riding, was thrown\nfrom his horse and killed on the spot.\n\nThis calamity broke up the party at Coningsby, which was not at the\nmoment very numerous. Mr. Rigby, by command, instantly seized the\nopportunity of preventing the arrival of other guests who were expected.\nThis catastrophe was the cause of Mr. Rigby resuming in a great measure\nhis old position in the Castle. There were a great many things to\nbe done, and all disagreeable; he achieved them all, and studied\neverybody's convenience. Coroners' inquests, funerals especially,\nweeping women, these were all spectacles which Lord Monmouth could not\nendure, but he was so high-bred, that he would not for the world\nthat there should be in manner or degree the slightest deficiency in\npropriety or even sympathy. But he wanted somebody to do everything that\nwas proper; to be considerate and consoling and sympathetic. Mr. Rigby\ndid it all; gave evidence at the inquest, was chief mourner at the\nfuneral, and arranged everything so well that not a single emblem of\ndeath crossed the sight of Lord Monmouth; while Madame Colonna found\nsubmission in his exhortations, and the Princess Lucretia, a little more\npale and pensive than usual, listened with tranquillity to his discourse\non the vanity of all sublunary things.\n\nWhen the tumult had subsided, and habits and feelings had fallen into\ntheir old routine and relapsed into their ancient channels, the\nMarquess proposed that they should all return to London, and with great\nformality, though with warmth, begged that Madame Colonna would ever\nconsider his roof as her own. All were glad to quit the Castle, which\nnow presented a scene so different from its former animation, and Madame\nColonna, weeping, accepted the hospitality of her friend, until the\nimpending expansion of the spring would permit her to return to Italy.\nThis notice of her return to her own country seemed to occasion the\nMarquess great disquietude.\n\nAfter they had remained about a month in London, Madame Colonna sent\nfor Mr. Rigby one morning to tell him how very painful it was to her\nfeelings to remain under the roof of Monmouth House without the sanction\nof a husband; that the circumstance of being a foreigner, under such\nunusual affliction, might have excused, though not authorised, the step\nat first, and for a moment; but that the continuance of such a course\nwas quite out of the question; that she owed it to herself, to her\nstep-child, no longer to trespass on this friendly hospitality, which,\nif persisted in, might be liable to misconstruction. Mr. Rigby\nlistened with great attention to this statement, and never in the least\ninterrupted Madame Colonna; and then offered to do that which he was\nconvinced the lady desired, namely, to make the Marquess acquainted with\nthe painful state of her feelings. This he did according to his fashion,\nand with sufficient dexterity. Mr. Rigby himself was anxious to\nknow which way the wind blew, and the mission with which he had been\nentrusted, fell in precisely with his inclinations and necessities. The\nMarquess listened to the communication and sighed, then turned gently\nround and surveyed himself in the mirror and sighed again, then said to\nRigby,\n\n'You understand exactly what I mean, Rigby. It is quite ridiculous their\ngoing, and infinitely distressing to me. They must stay.'\n\nRigby repaired to the Princess full of mysterious bustle, and with a\nface beaming with importance and satisfaction. He made much of the\ntwo sighs; fully justified the confidence of the Marquess in his\ncomprehension of unexplained intentions; prevailed on Madame Colonna to\nhave some regard for the feelings of one so devoted; expatiated on the\ninsignificance of worldly misconstructions, when replied to by such\nhonourable intentions; and fully succeeded in his mission. They did\nstay. Month after month rolled on, and still they stayed; every\nmonth all the family becoming more resigned or more content, and more\ncheerful. As for the Marquess himself, Mr. Rigby never remembered him\nmore serene and even joyous. His Lordship scarcely ever entered general\nsociety. The Colonna family remained in strict seclusion; and he\npreferred the company of these accomplished and congenial friends to the\nmob of the great world.\n\nBetween Madame Colonna and Mr. Rigby there had always subsisted\nconsiderable confidence. Now, that gentleman seemed to have achieved\nfresh and greater claims to her regard. In the pleasure with which he\nlooked forward to her approaching alliance with his patron, he reminded\nher of the readiness with which he had embraced her suggestions for the\nmarriage of her daughter with Coningsby. Always obliging, she was never\nwearied of chanting his praises to her noble admirer, who was apparently\nmuch gratified she should have bestowed her esteem on one of whom she\nwould necessarily in after-life see so much. It is seldom the lot of\nhusbands that their confidential friends gain the regards of their\nbrides.\n\n'I am glad you all like Rigby,' said Lord Monmouth, 'as you will see so\nmuch of him.'\n\nThe remembrance of the Hellingsley failure seemed to be erased from the\nmemory of the Marquess. Rigby never recollected him more cordial and\nconfidential, and more equable in his manner. He told Rigby one day,\nthat he wished that Monmouth House should possess the most sumptuous\nand the most fanciful boudoir in London or Paris. What a hint for Rigby!\nThat gentleman consulted the first artists, and gave them some hints in\nreturn; his researches on domestic decoration ranged through all\nages; he even meditated a rapid tour to mature his inventions; but his\nconfidence in his native taste and genius ultimately convinced him that\nthis movement was unnecessary.\n\nThe summer advanced; the death of the King occurred; the dissolution\nsummoned Rigby to Coningsby and the borough of Darlford. His success was\nmarked certain in the secret books of Tadpole and Taper. A manufacturing\ntown, enfranchised under the Reform Act, already gained by the\nConservative cause! Here was reaction; here influence of property!\nInfluence of character, too; for no one was so popular as Lord Monmouth;\na most distinguished nobleman of strict Conservative principles, who,\nif he carried the county and the manufacturing borough also, merited the\nstrawberry-leaf.\n\n'There will be no holding Rigby,' said Taper; 'I'm afraid he will be\nlooking for something very high.'\n\n'The higher the better,' rejoined Tadpole, 'and then he will not\ninterfere with us. I like your high-flyers; it is your plodders I\ndetest, wearing old hats and high-lows, speaking in committee, and\nthinking they are men of business: d----n them!'\n\nRigby went down, and made some impressive speeches; at least they read\nvery well in some of his second-rate journals, where all the uproar\nfigured as loud cheering, and the interruption of a cabbage-stalk was\nrepresented as a question from some intelligent individual in the crowd.\nThe fact is, Rigby bored his audience too much with history, especially\nwith the French Revolution, which he fancied was his 'forte,' so that\nthe people at last, whenever he made any allusion to the subject, were\nalmost as much terrified as if they had seen the guillotine.\n\nRigby had as yet one great advantage; he had no opponent; and without\npersonal opposition, no contest can be very bitter. It was for some days\nRigby _versus_ Liberal principles; and Rigby had much the best of it;\nfor he abused Liberal principles roundly in his harangues, who, not\nbeing represented on the occasion, made no reply; while plenty of ale,\nand some capital songs by Lucian Gay, who went down express, gave the\nright cue to the mob, who declared in chorus, beneath the windows of\nRigby's hotel, that he was 'a fine old English gentleman!'\n\nBut there was to be a contest; no question about that, and a sharp\none, although Rigby was to win, and well. The Liberal party had been so\nfastidious about their new candidate, that they had none ready though\nseveral biting. Jawster Sharp thought at one time that sheer necessity\nwould give him another chance still; but even Rigby was preferable to\nJawster Sharp, who, finding it would not do, published his long-prepared\nvaledictory address, in which he told his constituents, that having long\nsacrificed his health to their interests, he was now obliged to retire\ninto the bosom of his family. And a very well-provided-for family, too.\n\nAll this time the Liberal deputation from Darlford, two aldermen, three\ntown-councillors, and the Secretary of the Reform Association, were\nwalking about London like mad things, eating luncheons and looking for\na candidate. They called at the Reform Club twenty times in the morning,\nbadgered whips and red-tapers; were introduced to candidates, badgered\ncandidates; examined would-be members as if they were at a cattle-show,\nlistened to political pedigrees, dictated political pledges, referred\nto Hansard to see how men had voted, inquired whether men had spoken,\nfinally discussed terms. But they never could hit the right man. If\nthe principles were right, there was no money; and if money were ready,\nmoney would not take pledges. In fact, they wanted a Phoenix: a very\nrich man, who would do exactly as they liked, with extremely low\nopinions and with very high connections.\n\n'If he would go for the ballot and had a handle to his name, it would\nhave the best effect,' said the secretary of the Reform Association,\n'because you see we are fighting against a Right Honourable, and you\nhave no idea how that takes with the mob.'\n\nThe deputation had been three days in town, and urged by despatches\nby every train to bring affairs to a conclusion; jaded, perplexed,\nconfused, they were ready to fall into the hands of the first jobber\nor bold adventurer. They discussed over their dinner at a Strand\ncoffee-house the claims of the various candidates who had presented\nthemselves. Mr. Donald Macpherson Macfarlane, who would only pay the\nlegal expenses; he was soon despatched. Mr. Gingerly Browne, of Jermyn\nStreet, the younger son of a baronet, who would go as far as 1000_l._\nprovided the seat was secured. Mr. Juggins, a distiller, 2000_l._ man;\nbut would not agree to any annual subscriptions. Sir Baptist Placid,\nvague about expenditure, but repeatedly declaring that 'there could\nbe no difficulty on that head.' He however had a moral objection to\nsubscribing to the races, and that was a great point at Darlford. Sir\nBaptist would subscribe a guinea per annum to the infirmary, and the\nsame to all religious societies without any distinction of sects; but\nraces, it was not the sum, 100_l._ per annum, but the principle. He had\na moral objection.\n\nIn short, the deputation began to suspect, what was the truth, that they\nwere a day after the fair, and that all the electioneering rips that\nswarm in the purlieus of political clubs during an impending dissolution\nof Parliament, men who become political characters in their small circle\nbecause they have been talked of as once having an intention to stand\nfor places for which they never offered themselves, or for having stood\nfor places where they never could by any circumstance have succeeded,\nwere in fact nibbling at their dainty morsel.\n\nAt this moment of despair, a ray of hope was imparted to them by a\nconfidential note from a secretary of the Treasury, who wished to\nsee them at the Reform Club on the morrow. You may be sure they were\npunctual to their appointment. The secretary received them with great\nconsideration. He had got them a candidate, and one of high mark, the\nson of a Peer, and connected with the highest Whig houses. Their eyes\nsparkled. A real honourable. If they liked he would introduce them\nimmediately to the Honourable Alberic de Crecy. He had only to introduce\nthem, as there was no difficulty either as to means or opinions,\nexpenses or pledges.\n\nThe secretary returned with a young gentleman, whose diminutive stature\nwould seem, from his smooth and singularly puerile countenance, to be\nmerely the consequence of his very tender years; but Mr. De Crecy was\nreally of age, or at least would be by nomination-day. He did not say\na word, but looked like the rosebud which dangled in the button-hole of\nhis frock-coat. The aldermen and town-councillors were what is\nsometimes emphatically styled flabbergasted; they were speechless from\nbewilderment. 'Mr. De Crecy will go for the ballot,' said the secretary\nof the Treasury, with an audacious eye and a demure look, 'and for Total\nand Immediate, if you press him hard; but don't, if you can help it,\nbecause he has an uncle, an old county member, who has prejudices, and\nmight disinherit him. However, we answer for him. And I am very happy\nthat I have been the means of bringing about an arrangement which,\nI feel, will be mutually advantageous.' And so saying, the secretary\neffected his escape.\n\nCircumstances, however, retarded for a season the political career of\nthe Honourable Alberic de Crecy. While the Liberal party at Darlford\nwere suffering under the daily inflictions of Mr. Rigby's slashing\nstyle, and the post brought them very unsatisfactory prospects of a\nchampion, one offered himself, and in an address which intimated that he\nwas no man of straw, likely to recede from any contest in which he\nchose to embark. The town was suddenly placarded with a letter to\nthe Independent Electors from Mr. Millbank, the new proprietor of\nHellingsley.\n\nHe expressed himself as one not anxious to obtrude himself on their\nattention, and founding no claim to their confidence on his recent\nacquisition; but at the same time as one resolved that the free and\nenlightened community, with which he must necessarily hereafter be much\nconnected, should not become the nomination borough of any Peer of the\nrealm without a struggle, if they chose to make one. And so he offered\nhimself if they could not find a better candidate, without waiting for\nthe ceremony of a requisition. He was exactly the man they wanted; and\nthough he had 'no handle to his name,' and was somewhat impracticable\nabout pledges, his fortune was so great, and his character so high, that\nit might be hoped that the people would be almost as content as if\nthey were appealed to by some obscure scion of factitious nobility,\nsubscribing to political engagements which he could not comprehend,\nand which, in general, are vomited with as much facility as they are\nswallowed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe people of Darlford, who, as long as the contest for their\nrepresentation remained between Mr. Rigby and the abstraction called\nLiberal Principles, appeared to be very indifferent about the result,\nthe moment they learned that for the phrase had been substituted a\nsubstance, and that, too, in the form of a gentleman who was soon\nto figure as their resident neighbour, became excited, speedily\nenthusiastic. All the bells of all the churches rang when Mr. Millbank\ncommenced his canvass; the Conservatives, on the alert, if not alarmed,\ninsisted on their champion also showing himself in all directions; and\nin the course of four-and-twenty hours, such is the contagion of popular\nfeeling, the town was divided into two parties, the vast majority of\nwhich were firmly convinced that the country could only be saved by the\nreturn of Mr. Rigby, or preserved from inevitable destruction by the\nelection of Mr. Millbank.\n\nThe results of the two canvasses were such as had been anticipated from\nthe previous reports of the respective agents and supporters. In these\ndays the personal canvass of a candidate is a mere form. The whole\ncountry that is to be invaded has been surveyed and mapped out before\nentry; every position reconnoitred; the chain of communications\ncomplete. In the present case, as was not unusual, both candidates were\nreally supported by numerous and reputable adherents; and both had good\ngrounds for believing that they would be ultimately successful. But\nthere was a body of the electors sufficiently numerous to turn the\nelection, who would not promise their votes: conscientious men who felt\nthe responsibility of the duty that the constitution had entrusted to\ntheir discharge, and who would not make up their minds without duly\nweighing the respective merits of the two rivals. This class of deeply\nmeditative individuals are distinguished not only by their pensive turn\nof mind, but by a charitable vein that seems to pervade their being. Not\nonly will they think of your request, but for their parts they wish both\nsides equally well. Decision, indeed, as it must dash the hopes of one\nof their solicitors, seems infinitely painful to them; they have always\na good reason for postponing it. If you seek their suffrage during the\ncanvass, they reply, that the writ not having come down, the day of\nelection is not yet fixed. If you call again to inform them that the\nwrit has arrived, they rejoin, that perhaps after all there may not be a\ncontest. If you call a third time, half dead with fatigue, to give them\nfriendly notice that both you and your rival have pledged yourselves to\ngo to the poll, they twitch their trousers, rub their hands, and with a\ndull grin observe,\n\n'Well, sir, we shall see.'\n\n'Come, Mr. Jobson,' says one of the committee, with an insinuating\nsmile, 'give Mr. Millbank one.'\n\n'Jobson, I think you and I know each other,' says a most influential\nsupporter, with a knowing nod.\n\n'Yes, Mr. Smith, I should think we did.'\n\n'Come, come, give us one.'\n\n'Well, I have not made up my mind yet, gentlemen.'\n\n'Jobson!' says a solemn voice, 'didn't you tell me the other night you\nwished well to this gentleman?'\n\n'So I do; I wish well to everybody,' replies the imperturbable Jobson.\n\n'Well, Jobson,' exclaims another member of the committee, with a sigh,\n'who could have supposed that you would have been an enemy?'\n\n'I don't wish to be no enemy to no man, Mr. Trip.'\n\n'Come, Jobson,' says a jolly tanner, 'if I wanted to be a Parliament\nman, I don't think you could refuse me one!'\n\n'I don't think I could, Mr. Oakfield.'\n\n'Well, then, give it to my friend.'\n\n'Well, sir, I'll think about it.'\n\n'Leave him to me,' says another member of the committee, with a\nsignificant look. 'I know how to get round him. It's all right.'\n\n'Yes, leave him to Hayfield, Mr. Millbank; he knows how to manage him.'\n\nBut all the same, Jobson continues to look as little tractable and\nlamb-like as can be well fancied.\n\nAnd here, in a work which, in an unpretending shape, aspires to take\nneither an uninformed nor a partial view of the political history of the\nten eventful years of the Reform struggle, we should pause for a\nmoment to observe the strangeness, that only five years after the\nreconstruction of the electoral body by the Whig party, in a borough\ncalled into political existence by their policy, a manufacturing\ntown, too, the candidate comprising in his person every quality and\ncircumstance which could recommend him to the constituency, and\nhis opponent the worst specimen of the Old Generation, a political\nadventurer, who owed the least disreputable part of his notoriety to\nhis opposition to the Reform Bill; that in such a borough, under such\ncircumstances, there should be a contest, and that, too, one of a very\ndoubtful issue.\n\nWhat was the cause of this? Are we to seek it in the 'Reaction' of the\nTadpoles and the Tapers? That would not be a satisfactory solution.\nReaction, to a certain extent, is the law of human existence. In the\nparticular state of affairs before us, England after the Reform Act, it\nnever could be doubtful that Time would gradually, and in some instances\nrapidly, counteract the national impulse of 1832. There never could\nhave been a question, for example, that the English counties would\nhave reverted to their natural allegiance to their proprietors; but the\nresults of the appeals to the third Estate in 1835 and 1837 are not to\nbe accounted for by a mere readjustment of legitimate influences.\n\nThe truth is, that, considerable as are the abilities of the Whig\nleaders, highly accomplished as many of them unquestionably must be\nacknowledged in parliamentary debate, experienced in council, sedulous\nin office, eminent as scholars, powerful from their position, the\nabsence of individual influence, and of the pervading authority of a\ncommanding mind, have been the cause of the fall of the Whig party.\n\nSuch a supremacy was generally acknowledged in Lord Grey on the\naccession of this party to power: but it was the supremacy of a\ntradition rather than of a fact. Almost at the outset of his authority\nhis successor was indicated. When the crisis arrived, the intended\nsuccessor was not in the Whig ranks. It is in this virtual absence of\na real and recognised leader, almost from the moment that they passed\ntheir great measure, that we must seek a chief cause of all that\ninsubordination, all those distempered ambitions, and all those dark\nintrigues, that finally broke up, not only the Whig government, but the\nWhig party; demoralised their ranks, and sent them to the country, both\nin 1835 and 1837, with every illusion, which had operated so happily in\ntheir favour in 1832, scattered to the winds. In all things we trace the\nirresistible influence of the individual.\n\nAnd yet the interval that elapsed between 1835 and 1837 proved, that\nthere was all this time in the Whig array one entirely competent to the\noffice of leading a great party, though his capacity for that fulfilment\nwas too tardily recognised.\n\nLORD JOHN RUSSELL has that degree of imagination, which, though evinced\nrather in sentiment than expression, still enables him to generalise\nfrom the details of his reading and experience; and to take those\ncomprehensive views, which, however easily depreciated by ordinary\nmen in an age of routine, are indispensable to a statesman in the\nconjunctures in which we live. He understands, therefore, his position;\nand he has the moral intrepidity which prompts him ever to dare that\nwhich his intellect assures him is politic. He is consequently, at the\nsame time, sagacious and bold in council. As an administrator he is\nprompt and indefatigable. He is not a natural orator, and labours under\nphysical deficiencies which even a Demosthenic impulse could scarcely\novercome. But he is experienced in debate, quick in reply, fertile in\nresource, takes large views, and frequently compensates for a dry and\nhesitating manner by the expression of those noble truths that flash\nacross the fancy, and rise spontaneously to the lip, of men of poetic\ntemperament when addressing popular assemblies. If we add to this, a\nprivate life of dignified repute, the accidents of his birth and rank,\nwhich never can be severed from the man, the scion of a great historic\nfamily, and born, as it were, to the hereditary service of the State, it\nis difficult to ascertain at what period, or under what circumstances,\nthe Whig party have ever possessed, or could obtain, a more efficient\nleader.\n\nBut we must return to the Darlford election. The class of thoughtful\nvoters was sufficiently numerous in that borough to render the result\nof the contest doubtful to the last; and on the eve of the day of\nnomination both parties were equally sanguine.\n\nNomination-day altogether is an unsatisfactory affair. There is little\nto be done, and that little mere form. The tedious hours remain, and no\none can settle his mind to anything. It is not a holiday, for every one\nis serious; it is not business, for no one can attend to it; it is not\na contest, for there is no canvassing; nor an election, for there is no\npoll. It is a day of lounging without an object, and luncheons without\nan appetite; of hopes and fears; confidence and dejection; bravado bets\nand secret hedging; and, about midnight, of furious suppers of grilled\nbones, brandy-and-water, and recklessness.\n\nThe president and vice-president of the Conservative Association, the\nsecretary and the four solicitors who were agents, had impressed upon\nMr. Rigby that it was of the utmost importance, and must produce a\ngreat moral effect, if he obtain the show of hands. With his powers of\neloquence and their secret organisation, they flattered themselves it\nmight be done. With this view, Rigby inflicted a speech of more than\ntwo hours' duration on the electors, who bore it very kindly, as the mob\nlikes, above all things, that the ceremonies of nomination-day should\nnot be cut short: moreover, there is nothing that the mob likes so much\nas a speech. Rigby therefore had, on the whole, a far from unfavourable\naudience, and he availed himself of their forbearance. He brought in\nhis crack theme, the guillotine, and dilated so elaborately upon its\nqualities, that one of the gentlemen below could not refrain from\nexclaiming, 'I wish you may get it.' This exclamation gave Mr. Rigby\nwhat is called a great opening, which, like a practised speaker, he\nimmediately seized. He denounced the sentiment as 'un-English,' and got\nmuch cheered. Excited by this success, Rigby began to call everything\nelse 'un-English' with which he did not agree, until menacing murmurs\nbegan to rise, when he shifted the subject, and rose into a grand\nperoration, in which he assured them that the eyes of the whole empire\nwere on this particular election; cries of 'That's true,' from all\nsides; and that England expected every man to do his duty.\n\n'And who do you expect to do yours?' inquired a gentleman below,' about\nthat 'ere pension?'\n\n'Rigby,' screeched a hoarse voice, 'don't you mind; you guv it them\nwell.'\n\n'Rigby, keep up your spirits, old chap: we will have you.'\n\n'Now!' said a stentorian voice; and a man as tall as Saul looked round\nhim. This was the engaged leader of the Conservative mob; the eye of\nevery one of his minions was instantly on him. 'Now! Our young Queen and\nour Old Institutions! Rigby for ever!'\n\nThis was a signal for the instant appearance of the leader of the\nLiberal mob. Magog Wrath, not so tall as Bully Bluck, his rival, had\na voice almost as powerful, a back much broader, and a countenance far\nmore forbidding. 'Now, my boys, the Queen and Millbank for ever!'\n\nThese rival cries were the signals for a fight between the two bands of\ngladiators in the face of the hustings, the body of the people little\ninterfering. Bully Bluck seized Magog Wrath's colours; they wrestled,\nthey seized each other; their supporters were engaged in mutual contest;\nit appeared to be a most alarming and perilous fray; several ladies from\nthe windows screamed, one fainted; a band of special constables pushed\ntheir way through the mob; you heard their staves resounded on the\nskulls of all who opposed them, especially the little boys: order was at\nlength restored; and, to tell the truth, the only hurts inflicted were\nthose which came from the special constables. Bully Bluck and Magog\nWrath, with all their fierce looks, flaunting colours, loud cheers, and\ndesperate assaults, were, after all, only a couple of Condottieri, who\nwere cautious never to wound each other. They were, in fact, a peaceful\npolice, who kept the town in awe, and prevented others from being\nmischievous who were more inclined to do harm. Their hired gangs were\nthe safety-valves for all the scamps of the borough, who, receiving a\nfew shillings per head for their nominal service, and as much drink as\nthey liked after the contest, were bribed and organised into peace\nand sobriety on the days in which their excesses were most to be\napprehended.\n\nNow Mr. Millbank came forward: he was brief compared with Mr. Rigby; but\nclear and terse. No one could misunderstand him. He did not favour his\nhearers with any history, but gave them his views about taxes, free\ntrade, placemen, and pensioners, whoever and wherever they might be.\n\n'Hilloa, Rigby, about that 'ere pension?'\n\n'Millbank for ever! We will have him.'\n\n'Never mind, Rigby, you'll come in next time.'\n\nMr. Millbank was energetic about resident representatives, but did not\nunderstand that a resident representative meant the nominee of a great\nLord, who lived in a great castle; great cheering. There was a Lord\nonce who declared that, if he liked, he would return his negro valet to\nParliament; but Mr. Millbank thought those days were over. It remained\nfor the people of Darlford to determine whether he was mistaken.\n\n'Never!' exclaimed the mob. 'Millbank for ever! Rigby in the river! No\nniggers, no walets!'\n\n'Three groans for Rigby.'\n\n'His language ain't as purty as the Lunnun chap's,' said a critic below;\n'but he speaks from his 'art: and give me the man who 'as got a 'art.'\n\n'That's your time of day, Mr. Robinson.'\n\n'Now!' said Magog Wrath, looking around. 'Now, the Queen and Millbank\nfor ever! Hurrah!'\n\nThe show of hands was entirely in favour of Mr. Millbank. Scarcely a\nhand was held up for Mr. Rigby below, except by Bully Bluck and his\npraetorians. The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative\nAssociation, the Secretary, and the four agents, severally and\nrespectively went up to Mr. Rigby and congratulated him on the result,\nas it was a known fact, 'that the show of hands never won.'\n\nThe eve of polling-day was now at hand. This is the most critical period\nof an election. All night parties in disguise were perambulating the\ndifferent wards, watching each other's tactics; masks, wigs, false\nnoses, gentles in livery coats, men in female attire, a silent carnival\nof manoeuvre, vigilance, anxiety, and trepidation. The thoughtful voters\nabout this time make up their minds; the enthusiasts who have told you\ntwenty times a-day for the last fortnight, that they would get up in the\nmiddle of the night to serve you, require the most watchful cooping; all\nthe individuals who have assured you that 'their word is their bond,'\nchange sides.\n\nTwo of the Rigbyites met in the market-place about an hour after\nmidnight.\n\n'Well, how goes it?' said one.\n\n'I have been the rounds. The blunt's going like the ward-pump. I saw\na man come out of Moffatt's house, muffled up with a mask on. I dodged\nhim. It was Biggs.'\n\n'You don't mean that, do you? D----e, I'll answer for Moffatt.'\n\n'I never thought he was a true man.'\n\n'Told Robins?'\n\n'I could not see him; but I met young Gunning and told him.'\n\n'Young Gunning! That won't do.'\n\n'I thought he was as right as the town clock.'\n\n'So did I, once. Hush! who comes here? The enemy, Franklin and Sampson\nPotts. Keep close.'\n\n'I'll speak to them. Good night, Potts. Up rather late to-night?'\n\n'All fair election time. You ain't snoring, are you?'\n\n'Well, I hope the best man will win.'\n\n'I am sure he will.'\n\n'You must go for Moffatt early, to breakfast at the White Lion; that's\nyour sort. Don't leave him, and poll him your-self. I am going off to\nSolomon Lacey's. He has got four Millbankites cooped up very drunk, and\nI want to get them quietly into the country before daybreak.'\n\n'Tis polling-day! The candidates are roused from their slumbers at an\nearly hour by the music of their own bands perambulating the town, and\neach playing the 'conquering hero' to sustain the courage of their jaded\nemployers, by depriving them of that rest which can alone tranquillise\nthe nervous system. There is something in that matin burst of music,\nfollowed by a shrill cheer from the boys of the borough, the only\ninhabitants yet up, that is very depressing.\n\nThe committee-rooms of each candidate are soon rife with black reports;\neach side has received fearful bulletins of the preceding night\ncampaign; and its consequences as exemplified in the morning,\nunprecedented tergiversations, mysterious absences; men who breakfast\nwith one side and vote with the other; men who won't come to breakfast;\nmen who won't leave breakfast.\n\nAt ten o'clock Mr. Rigby was in a majority of twenty-eight.\n\nThe polling was brisk and equal until the middle of the day, when it\nbecame slack. Mr. Rigby kept a majority, but an inconsiderable one.\nMr. Millbank's friends were not disheartened, as it was known that\nthe leading members of Mr. Rigby's committee had polled; whereas his\nopponent's were principally reserved. At a quarter-past two there was\ngreat cheering and uproar. The four voters in favour of Millbank, whom\nSolomon Lacey had cooped up, made drunk, and carried into the country,\nhad recovered iheir senses, made their escape, and voted as they\noriginally intended. Soon after this, Mr. Millbank was declared by his\ncommittee to be in a majority of one, but the committee of Mr. Rigby\ninstantly posted a placard, in large letters, to announce that, on the\ncontrary, their man was in a majority of nine.\n\n'If we could only have got another registration,' whispered the\nprincipal agent to Mr. Rigby, at a quarter-past four.\n\n'You think it's all over, then?'\n\n'Why, I do not see now how we can win. We have polled all our dead men,\nand Millbank is seven ahead.'\n\n'I have no doubt we shall be able to have a good petition,' said the\nconsoling chairman of the Conservative Association.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nIt was not with feelings of extreme satisfaction that Mr. Rigby returned\nto London. The loss of Hellingsley, followed by the loss of the borough\nto Hellingsley's successful master, were not precisely the incidents\nwhich would be adduced as evidence of Mr. Rigby's good management or\ngood fortune. Hitherto that gentleman had persuaded the world that he\nwas not only very clever, but that he was also always in luck; a quality\nwhich many appreciate more even than capacity. His reputation was\nunquestionably damaged, both with his patron and his party. But what\nthe Tapers and the Tadpoles thought or said, what even might be the\ninjurious effect on his own career of the loss of this election, assumed\nan insignificant character when compared with its influence on the\ntemper and disposition of the Marquess of Monmouth.\n\nAnd yet his carriage is now entering the courtyard of Monmouth House,\nand, in all probability, a few minutes would introduce him to that\npresence before which he had, ere this, trembled. The Marquess was at\nhome, and anxious to see Mr. Rigby. In a few minutes that gentleman was\nascending the private staircase, entering the antechamber, and waiting\nto be received in the little saloon, exactly as our Coningsby did more\nthan five years ago, scarcely less agitated, but by feelings of a very\ndifferent character.\n\n'Well, you made a good fight of it,' exclaimed the Marquess, in a\ncheerful and cordial tone, as Mr. Rigby entered his dressing-room.\n'Patience! We shall win next time.'\n\nThis reception instantly reassured the defeated candidate, though its\ncontrast to that which he expected rather perplexed him. He entered into\nthe details of the election, talked rapidly of the next registration,\nthe propriety of petitioning; accustomed himself to hearing his voice\nwith its habitual volubility in a chamber where he had feared it might\nnot sound for some time.\n\n'D----n politics!' said the Marquess. 'These fellows are in for this\nParliament, and I am really weary of the whole affair. I begin to think\nthe Duke was right, and it would have been best to have left them to\nthemselves. I am glad you have come up at once, for I want you. The fact\nis, I am going to be married.'\n\nThis was not a startling announcement to Mr. Rigby; he was prepared for\nit, though scarcely could have hoped that he would have been favoured\nwith it on the present occasion, instead of a morose comment on his\nmisfortunes. Marriage, then, was the predominant idea of Lord Monmouth\nat the present moment, in whose absorbing interest all vexations were\nforgotten. Fortunate Rigby! Disgusted by the failure of his political\ncombinations, his disappointments in not dictating to the county and not\ncarrying the borough, and the slight prospect at present of obtaining\nthe great object of his ambition, Lord Monmouth had resolved to\nprecipitate his fate, was about to marry immediately, and quit England.\n\n'You will be wanted, Rigby,' continued the Marquess. 'We must have a\ncouple of trustees, and I have thought of you as one. You know you are\nmy executor; and it is better not to bring in unnecessarily new names\ninto the management of my affairs. Lord Eskdale will act with you.'\n\nRigby then, after all, was a lucky man. After such a succession of\nfailures, he had returned only to receive fresh and the most delicate\nmarks of his patron's good feeling and consideration. Lord Monmouth's\ntrustee and executor! 'You know you are my executor.' Sublime truth! It\nought to be blazoned in letters of gold in the most conspicuous part of\nRigby's library, to remind him perpetually of his great and impending\ndestiny. Lord Monmouth's executor, and very probably one of his\nresiduary legatees! A legatee of some sort he knew he was. What a\nsplendid _memento mori_! What cared Rigby for the borough of Darlford?\nAnd as for his political friends, he wished them joy of their barren\nbenches. Nothing was lost by not being in this Parliament.\n\nIt was then with sincerity that Rigby offered his congratulations to\nhis patron. He praised the judicious alliance, accompanied by every\ncircumstance conducive to worldly happiness; distinguished beauty,\nperfect temper, princely rank. Rigby, who had hardly got out of his\nhustings' vein, was most eloquent in his praises of Madame Colonna.\n\n'An amiable woman,' said Lord Monmouth, 'and very handsome. I always\nadmired her; and an agreeable person too; I dare say a very good temper,\nbut I am not going to marry her.'\n\n'Might I then ask who is--'\n\n'Her step-daughter, the Princess Lucretia,' replied the Marquess,\nquietly, and looking at his ring.\n\nHere was a thunderbolt! Rigby had made another mistake. He had been\nworking all this time for the wrong woman! The consciousness of being a\ntrustee alone sustained him. There was an inevitable pause. The Marquess\nwould not speak however, and Rigby must. He babbled rather incoherently\nabout the Princess Lucretia being admired by everybody; also that she\nwas the most fortunate of women, as well as the most accomplished; he\nwas just beginning to say he had known her from a child, when discretion\nstopped his tongue, which had a habit of running on somewhat rashly;\nbut Rigby, though he often blundered in his talk, had the talent of\nextricating himself from the consequence of his mistakes.\n\n'And Madame must be highly gratified by all this?' observed Mr. Rigby,\nwith an enquiring accent. He was dying to learn how she had first\nreceived the intelligence, and congratulated himself that his absence at\nhis contest had preserved him from the storm.\n\n'Madame Colonna knows nothing of our intentions,' said Lord Monmouth.\n'And by the bye, that is the very business on which I wish to see you,\nRigby. I wish you to communicate them to her. We are to be married,\nand immediately. It would gratify me that the wife of Lucretia's father\nshould attend our wedding. You understand exactly what I mean, Rigby; I\nmust have no scenes. Always happy to see the Princess Colonna under my\nroof; but then I like to live quietly, particularly at present;\nharassed as I have been by the loss of these elections, by all this bad\nmanagement, and by all these disappointments on subjects in which I was\nled to believe success was certain. Madame Colonna is at home;' and the\nMarquess bowed Mr. Rigby out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe departure of Sidonia from Coningsby Castle, in the autumn,\ndetermined the Princess Lucretia on a step which had for some time\nbefore his arrival occupied her brooding imagination. Nature had\nbestowed on this lady an ambitious soul and a subtle spirit; she could\ndare much and could execute finely. Above all things she coveted power;\nand though not free from the characteristic susceptibility of her sex,\nthe qualities that could engage her passions or fascinate her fancy must\npartake of that intellectual eminence which distinguished her. Though\nthe Princess Lucretia in a short space of time had seen much of the\nworld, she had as yet encountered no hero. In the admirers whom her\nrank, and sometimes her intelligence, assembled around her, her master\nhad not yet appeared. Her heart had not trembled before any of those\nbrilliant forms whom she was told her sex admired; nor did she envy any\none the homage which she did not appreciate. There was, therefore, no\ndisturbing element in the worldly calculations which she applied to that\nquestion which is, to woman, what a career is to man, the question of\nmarriage. She would marry to gain power, and therefore she wished to\nmarry the powerful. Lord Eskdale hovered around her, and she liked\nhim. She admired his incomparable shrewdness; his freedom from ordinary\nprejudices; his selfishness which was always good-natured, and the\nimperturbability that was not callous. But Lord Eskdale had hovered\nround many; it was his easy habit. He liked clever women, young, but who\nhad seen something of the world. The Princess Lucretia pleased him much;\nwith the form and mind of a woman even in the nursery. He had watched\nher development with interest; and had witnessed her launch in that\nworld where she floated at once with as much dignity and consciousness\nof superior power, as if she had braved for seasons its waves and its\ntempests.\n\nMusing over Lord Eskdale, the mind of Lucretia was drawn to the image\nof his friend; her friend; the friend of her parents. And why not marry\nLord Monmouth? The idea pleased her. There was something great in the\nconception; difficult and strange. The result, if achieved, would give\nher all that she desired. She devoted her mind to this secret thought.\nShe had no confidants. She concentrated her intellect on one point,\nand that was to fascinate the grandfather of Coningsby, while her\nstep-mother was plotting that she should marry his grandson. The\nvolition of Lucretia Colonna was, if not supreme, of a power most\ndifficult to resist. There was something charm-like and alluring in the\nconversation of one who was silent to all others; something in the tones\nof her low rich voice which acted singularly on the nervous system. It\nwas the voice of the serpent; indeed, there was an undulating movement\nin Lucretia, when she approached you, which irresistibly reminded you of\nthat mysterious animal.\n\nLord Monmouth was not insensible to the spell, though totally\nunconscious of its purpose. He found the society of Lucretia very\nagreeable to him; she was animated, intelligent, original; her inquiries\nwere stimulating; her comments on what she saw, and heard, and read,\nracy and often indicating a fine humour. But all this was reserved for\nhis ear. Before her parents, as before all others, Lucretia was silent,\na little scornful, never communicating, neither giving nor seeking\namusement, shut up in herself.\n\nLord Monmouth fell therefore into the habit of riding and driving with\nLucretia alone. It was an arrangement which he found made his life more\npleasant. Nor was it displeasing to Madame Colonna. She looked upon\nLord Monmouth's fancy for Lucretia as a fresh tie for them all. Even the\nPrince, when his wife called his attention to the circumstance, observed\nit with satisfaction. It was a circumstance which represented in his\nmind a continuance of good eating and good drinking, fine horses,\nluxurious baths, unceasing billiards.\n\nIn this state of affairs appeared Sidonia, known before to her\nstep-mother, but seen by Lucretia for the first time. Truly, he came,\nsaw, and conquered. Those eyes that rarely met another's were fixed upon\nhis searching yet unimpassioned glance. She listened to that voice,\nfull of music yet void of tenderness; and the spirit of Lucretia Colonna\nbowed before an intelligence that commanded sympathy, yet offered none.\n\nLucretia naturally possessed great qualities as well as great talents.\nUnder a genial influence, her education might have formed a being\ncapable of imparting and receiving happiness. But she found herself\nwithout a guide. Her father offered her no love; her step-mother gained\nfrom her no respect. Her literary education was the result of her\nown strong mind and inquisitive spirit. She valued knowledge, and she\ntherefore acquired it. But not a single moral principle or a single\nreligious truth had ever been instilled into her being. Frequent\nabsence from her own country had by degrees broken off even an habitual\nobservance of the forms of her creed; while a life of undisturbed\nindulgence, void of all anxiety and care, while it preserved her from\nmany of the temptations to vice, deprived her of that wisdom 'more\nprecious than rubies,' which adversity and affliction, the struggles and\nthe sorrows of existence, can alone impart.\n\nLucretia had passed her life in a refined, but rather dissolute society.\nNot indeed that a word that could call forth a maiden blush, conduct\nthat could pain the purest feelings, could be heard or witnessed in\nthose polished and luxurious circles. The most exquisite taste pervaded\ntheir atmosphere; and the uninitiated who found themselves in those\nperfumed chambers and those golden saloons, might believe, from all that\npassed before them, that their inhabitants were as pure, as orderly, and\nas irreproachable as their furniture. But among the habitual dwellers\nin these delicate halls there was a tacit understanding, a\nprevalent doctrine that required no formal exposition, no proofs and\nillustrations, no comment and no gloss; which was indeed rather a\ntraditional conviction than an imparted dogma; that the exoteric public\nwere, on many subjects, the victims of very vulgar prejudices, which\nthese enlightened personages wished neither to disturb nor to adopt.\n\nA being of such a temper, bred in such a manner; a woman full\nof intellect and ambition, daring and lawless, and satiated with\nprosperity, is not made for equable fortunes and an uniform existence.\nShe would have sacrificed the world for Sidonia, for he had touched\nthe fervent imagination that none before could approach; but that\ninscrutable man would not read the secret of her heart; and prompted\nalike by pique, the love of power, and a weariness of her present life,\nLucretia resolved on that great result which Mr. Rigby is now about to\ncommunicate to the Princess Colonna.\n\nAbout half-an-hour after Mr. Rigby had entered that lady's apartments\nit seemed that all the bells of Monmouth House were ringing at the same\ntime. The sound even reached the Marquess in his luxurious recess; who\nimmediately took a pinch of snuff, and ordered his valet to lock the\ndoor of the ante-chamber. The Princess Lucretia, too, heard the sounds;\nshe was lying on a sofa, in her boudoir, reading the _Inferno_, and\nimmediately mustered her garrison in the form of a French maid, and gave\ndirections that no one should be admitted. Both the Marquess and\nhis intended bride felt that a crisis was at hand, and resolved to\nparticipate in no scenes.\n\nThe ringing ceased; there was again silence. Then there was another\nring; a short, hasty, and violent pull; followed by some slamming of\ndoors. The servants, who were all on the alert, and had advantages\nof hearing and observation denied to their secluded master, caught a\nglimpse of Mr. Rigby endeavouring gently to draw back into her apartment\nMadame Colonna, furious amid his deprecatory exclamations.\n\n'For heaven's sake, my dear Madame; for your own sake; now really; now\nI assure you; you are quite wrong; you are indeed; it is a complete\nmisapprehension; I will explain everything. I entreat, I implore,\nwhatever you like, just what you please; only listen.'\n\nThen the lady, with a mantling visage and flashing eye, violently\nclosing the door, was again lost to their sight. A few minutes after\nthere was a moderate ring, and Mr. Rigby, coming out of the apartments,\nwith his cravat a little out of order, as if he had had a violent\nshaking, met the servant who would have entered.\n\n'Order Madame Colonna's travelling carriage,' he exclaimed in a loud\nvoice, 'and send Mademoiselle Conrad here directly. I don't think the\nfellow hears me,' added Mr. Rigby, and following the servant, he added\nin a low tone and with a significant glance, 'no travelling carriage; no\nMademoiselle Conrad; order the britska round as usual.'\n\nNearly another hour passed; there was another ring; very moderate\nindeed. The servant was informed that Madame Colonna was coming down,\nand she appeared as usual. In a beautiful morning dress, and leaning on\nthe arm of Mr. Rigby, she descended the stairs, and was handed into her\ncarriage by that gentleman, who, seating himself by her side, ordered\nthem to drive to Richmond.\n\nLord Monmouth having been informed that all was calm, and that Madame\nColonna, attended by Mr. Rigby, had gone to Richmond, ordered his\ncarriage, and accompanied by Lucretia and Lucian Gay, departed\nimmediately for Blackwall, where, in whitebait, a quiet bottle of\nclaret, the society of his agreeable friends, and the contemplation of\nthe passing steamers, he found a mild distraction and an amusing repose.\n\nMr. Rigby reported that evening to the Marquess on his return, that all\nwas arranged and tranquil. Perhaps he exaggerated the difficulties,\nto increase the service; but according to his account they were\nconsiderable. It required some time to make Madame Colonna comprehend\nthe nature of his communication. All Rigby's diplomatic skill was\nexpended in the gradual development. When it was once fairly put before\nher, the effect was appalling. That was the first great ringing of\nbells. Rigby softened a little what he had personally endured; but\nhe confessed she sprang at him like a tigress balked of her prey, and\npoured forth on him a volume of epithets, many of which Rigby\nreally deserved. But after all, in the present instance, he was not\ntreacherous, only base, which he always was. Then she fell into a\npassion of tears, and vowed frequently that she was not weeping for\nherself, but only for that dear Mr. Coningsby, who had been treated so\ninfamously and robbed of Lucretia, and whose heart she knew must break.\nIt seemed that Rigby stemmed the first violence of her emotion by\nmysterious intimations of an important communication that he had to\nmake; and piquing her curiosity, he calmed her passion. But really\nhaving nothing to say, he was nearly involved in fresh dangers. He took\nrefuge in the affectation of great agitation which prevented exposition.\nThe lady then insisted on her travelling carriage being ordered and\npacked, as she was determined to set out for Rome that afternoon. This\nlittle occurrence gave Rigby some few minutes to collect himself, at\nthe end of which he made the Princess several announcements of intended\narrangements, all of which pleased her mightily, though they were so\ninconsistent with each other, that if she had not been a woman in a\npassion, she must have detected that Rigby was lying. He assured her\nalmost in the same breath, that she was never to be separated from them,\nand that she was to have any establishment in any country she liked. He\ntalked wildly of equipages, diamonds, shawls, opera-boxes; and while\nher mind was bewildered with these dazzling objects, he, with intrepid\ngravity, consulted her as to the exact amount she would like to have\napportioned, independent of her general revenue, for the purposes of\ncharity.\n\nAt the end of two hours, exhausted by her rage and soothed by these\nvisions, Madame Colonna having grown calm and reasonable, sighed and\nmurmured a complaint, that Lord Monmouth ought to have communicated this\nimportant intelligence in person. Upon this Rigby instantly assured\nher, that Lord Monmouth had been for some time waiting to do so, but\nin consequence of her lengthened interview with Rigby, his Lordship had\ndeparted for Richmond with Lucretia, where he hoped that Madame Colonna\nand Mr. Rigby would join him. So it ended, with a morning drive and\nsuburban dinner; Rigby, after what he had gone through, finding no\ndifficulty in accounting for the other guests not being present, and\nbringing home Madame Colonna in the evening, at times almost as gay and\ngood-tempered as usual, and almost oblivious of her disappointment.\n\nWhen the Marquess met Madame Colonna he embraced her with great\ncourtliness, and from that time consulted her on every arrangement. He\ntook a very early occasion of presenting her with a diamond necklace of\ngreat value. The Marquess was fond of making presents to persons to whom\nhe thought he had not behaved very well, and who yet spared him scenes.\n\nThe marriage speedily followed, by special license, at the villa of the\nRight Hon. Nicholas Rigby, who gave away the bride. The wedding was very\nselect, but brilliant as the diamond necklace: a royal Duke and Duchess,\nLady St. Julians, and a few others. Mr. Ormsby presented the bride with\na bouquet of precious stones, and Lord Eskdale with a French fan in\na diamond frame. It was a fine day; Lord Monmouth, calm as if he were\nwinning the St. Leger; Lucretia, universally recognised as a beauty; all\nthe guests gay, the Princess Colonna especially.\n\nThe travelling carriage is at the door which is to bear away the happy\npair. Madame Colonna embraces Lucretia; the Marquess gives a grand bow:\nthey are gone. The guests remain awhile. A Prince of the blood will\npropose a toast; there is another glass of champagne quaffed, another\nortolan devoured; and then they rise and disperse. Madame Colonna leaves\nwith Lady St. Julians, whose guest for a while she is to become. And in\na few minutes their host is alone.\n\nMr. Rigby retired into his library: the repose of the chamber must\nhave been grateful to his feelings after all this distraction. It was\nspacious, well-stored, classically adorned, and opened on a beautiful\nlawn. Rigby threw himself into an ample chair, crossed his legs, and\nresting his head on his arm, apparently fell into deep contemplation.\n\nHe had some cause for reflection, and though we did once venture to\naffirm that Rigby never either thought or felt, this perhaps may be the\nexception that proves the rule.\n\nHe could scarcely refrain from pondering over the strange event which he\nhad witnessed, and at which he had assisted.\n\nIt was an incident that might exercise considerable influence over his\nfortunes. His patron married, and married to one who certainly did\nnot offer to Mr. Rigby such a prospect of easy management as her\nstep-mother! Here were new influences arising; new characters, new\nsituations, new contingencies. Was he thinking of all this? He suddenly\njumps up, hurries to a shelf and takes down a volume. It is his\ninterleaved peerage, of which for twenty years he had been threatening\nan edition. Turning to the Marquisate of Monmouth, he took up his pen\nand thus made the necessary entry:\n\n'_Married, second time, August 3rd, 1837, The Princess Lucretia Colonna,\ndaughter of Prince Paul Colonna, born at Rome, February 16th, 1819._'\n\nThat was what Mr. Rigby called 'a great fact.' There was not a\npeerage-compiler in England who had that date save himself.\n\nBefore we close this slight narrative of the domestic incidents that\noccurred in the family of his grandfather since Coningsby quitted the\nCastle, we must not forget to mention what happened to Villebecque and\nFlora. Lord Monmouth took a great liking to the manager. He found him\nvery clever in many things independently of his profession; he was\nuseful to Lord Monmouth, and did his work in an agreeable manner. And\nthe future Lady Monmouth was accustomed to Flora, and found her useful\ntoo, and did not like to lose her. And so the Marquess, turning all the\ncircumstances in his mind, and being convinced that Villebecque could\nnever succeed to any extent in England in his profession, and probably\nnowhere else, appointed him, to Villebecque's infinite satisfaction,\nintendant of his household, with a considerable salary, while Flora\nstill lived with her kind step-father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nAnother year elapsed; not so fruitful in incidents to Coningsby as the\npreceding ones, and yet not unprofitably passed. It had been spent in\nthe almost unremitting cultivation of his intelligence. He had read\ndeeply and extensively, digested his acquisitions, and had practised\nhimself in surveying them, free from those conventional conclusions\nand those traditionary inferences that surrounded him. Although he had\nrenounced his once cherished purpose of trying for University honours,\nan aim which he found discordant with the investigations on which his\nmind was bent, he had rarely quitted Cambridge. The society of his\nfriends, the great convenience of public libraries, and the general\ntone of studious life around, rendered an University for him a genial\nresidence. There is a moment in life, when the pride and thirst of\nknowledge seem to absorb our being, and so it happened now to Coningsby,\nwho felt each day stronger in his intellectual resources, and each day\nmore anxious and avid to increase them. The habits of public\ndiscussion fostered by the Debating Society were also for Coningsby no\nInconsiderable tie to the University. This was the arena in which he\nfelt himself at home. The promise of his Eton days was here fulfilled.\nAnd while his friends listened to his sustained argument or his\nimpassioned declamation, the prompt reply or the apt retort, they looked\nforward with pride through the vista of years to the time when the hero\nof the youthful Club should convince or dazzle in the senate. It is\nprobable then that he would have remained at Cambridge with slight\nintervals until he had taken his degree, had not circumstances occurred\nwhich gave altogether a new turn to his thoughts.\n\nWhen Lord Monmouth had fixed his wedding-day he had written himself\nto Coningsby to announce his intended marriage, and to request his\ngrandson's presence at the ceremony. The letter was more than kind; it\nwas warm and generous. He assured his grandson that this alliance\nshould make no difference in the very ample provision which he had\nlong intended for him; that he should ever esteem Coningsby his\nnearest relative; and that, while his death would bring to Coningsby as\nconsiderable an independence as an English gentleman need desire, so\nin his lifetime Coningsby should ever be supported as became his birth,\nbreeding, and future prospects. Lord Monmouth had mentioned to Lucretia,\nthat he was about to invite his grandson to their wedding, and the lady\nhad received the intimation with satisfaction. It so happened that a\nfew hours after, Lucretia, who now entered the private rooms of Lord\nMonmouth without previously announcing her arrival, met Villebecque with\nthe letter to Coningsby in his hand. Lucretia took it away from him,\nand said it should be posted with her own letters. It never reached its\ndestination. Our friend learnt the marriage from the newspapers, which\nsomewhat astounded him; but Coningsby was fond of his grandfather, and\nhe wrote Lord Monmouth a letter of congratulation, full of feeling and\ningenuousness, and which, while it much pleased the person to whom it\nwas addressed, unintentionally convinced him that Coningsby had never\nreceived his original communication. Lord Monmouth spoke to Villebecque,\nwho could throw sufficient light upon the subject, but it was never\nmentioned to Lady Monmouth. The Marquess was a man who always found out\neverything, and enjoyed the secret.\n\nRather more than a year after the marriage, when Coningsby had completed\nhis twenty-first year, the year which he had passed so quietly at\nCambridge, he received a letter from his grandfather, informing him that\nafter a variety of movements Lady Monmouth and himself were established\nin Paris for the season, and desiring that he would not fail to come\nover as soon as practicable, and pay them as long a visit as the\nregulations of the University would permit. So, at the close of the\nDecember term, Coningsby quitted Cambridge for Paris.\n\nPassing through London, he made his first visit to his banker at Charing\nCross, on whom he had periodically drawn since he commenced his college\nlife. He was in the outer counting-house, making some inquiries about a\nletter of credit, when one of the partners came out from an inner room,\nand invited him to enter. This firm had been for generations the bankers\nof the Coningsby family; and it appeared that there was a sealed box\nin their possession, which had belonged to the father of Coningsby, and\nthey wished to take this opportunity of delivering it to his son. This\ncommunication deeply interested him; and as he was alone in London, at\nan hotel, and on the wing for a foreign country, he requested permission\nat once to examine it, in order that he might again deposit it with\nthem: so he was shown into a private room for that purpose. The seal was\nbroken; the box was full of papers, chiefly correspondence: among them\nwas a packet described as letters from 'my dear Helen,' the mother of\nConingsby. In the interior of this packet there was a miniature of that\nmother. He looked at it; put it down; looked at it again and again.\nHe could not be mistaken. There was the same blue fillet in the bright\nhair. It was an exact copy of that portrait which had so greatly excited\nhis attention when at Millbank! This was a mysterious and singularly\nperplexing incident. It greatly agitated him. He was alone in the room\nwhen he made the discovery. When he had recovered himself, he sealed up\nthe contents of the box, with the exception of his mother's letters and\nthe miniature, which he took away with him, and then re-delivered it to\nhis banker for custody until his return.\n\nConingsby found Lord and Lady Monmouth in a splendid hotel in the\nFaubourg St. Honor\u00c3\u00a9, near the English Embassy. His grandfather looked at\nhim with marked attention, and received him with evident satisfaction.\nIndeed, Lord Monmouth was greatly pleased that Harry had come to Paris;\nit was the University of the World, where everybody should graduate.\nParis and London ought to be the great objects of all travellers; the\nrest was mere landscape.\n\nIt cannot be denied that between Lucretia and Coningsby there existed\nfrom the first a certain antipathy; and though circumstances for a short\ntime had apparently removed or modified the aversion, the manner of the\nlady when Coningsby was ushered into her boudoir, resplendent with all\nthat Parisian taste and luxury could devise, was characterised by that\nfrigid politeness which had preceded the days of their more genial\nacquaintance. If the manner of Lucretia were the same as before her\nmarriage, a considerable change might however be observed in her\nappearance. Her fine form had become more developed; while her dress,\nthat she once neglected, was elaborate and gorgeous, and of the last\nmode. Lucretia was the fashion of Paris; a great lady, greatly admired.\nA guest under such a roof, however, Coningsby was at once launched\ninto the most brilliant circles of Parisian society, which he found\nfascinating.\n\nThe art of society is, without doubt, perfectly comprehended and\ncompletely practised in the bright metropolis of France. An Englishman\ncannot enter a saloon without instantly feeling he is among a race more\nsocial than his compatriots. What, for example, is more consummate\nthan the manner in which a French lady receives her guests! She unites\ngraceful repose and unaffected dignity, with the most amiable regard for\nothers. She sees every one; she speaks to every one; she sees them at\nthe right moment; she says the right thing; it is utterly impossible\nto detect any difference in the position of her guests by the spirit in\nwhich she welcomes them. There is, indeed, throughout every circle of\nParisian society, from the chateau to the cabaret, a sincere homage to\nintellect; and this without any maudlin sentiment. None sooner than\nthe Parisians can draw the line between factitious notoriety and honest\nfame; or sooner distinguished between the counterfeit celebrity and\nthe standard reputation. In England, we too often alternate between a\nsupercilious neglect of genius and a rhapsodical pursuit of quacks. In\nEngland when a new character appears in our circles, the first question\nalways is, 'Who is he?' In France it is, 'What is he?' In England, 'How\nmuch a-year?' In France, 'What has he done?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nAbout a week after Coningsby's arrival in Paris, as he was sauntering on\nthe soft and sunny Boulevards, soft and sunny though Christmas, he met\nSidonia.\n\n'So you are here?' said Sidonia. 'Turn now with me, for I see you are\nonly lounging, and tell me when you came, where you are, and what you\nhave done since we parted. I have been here myself but a few days.'\n\nThere was much to tell. And when Coningsby had rapidly related all that\nhad passed, they talked of Paris. Sidonia had offered him hospitality,\nuntil he learned that Lord Monmouth was in Paris, and that Coningsby was\nhis guest.\n\n'I am sorry you cannot come to me,' he remarked; 'I would have shown you\neverybody and everything. But we shall meet often.'\n\n'I have already seen many remarkable things,' said Coningsby; 'and met\nmany celebrated persons. Nothing strikes me more in this brilliant\ncity than the tone of its society, so much higher than our own. What an\nabsence of petty personalities! How much conversation, and how little\ngossip! Yet nowhere is there less pedantry. Here all women are as\nagreeable as is the remarkable privilege in London of some half-dozen.\nMen too, and great men, develop their minds. A great man in England,\non the contrary, is generally the dullest dog in company. And yet, how\npiteous to think that so fair a civilisation should be in such imminent\nperil!'\n\n'Yes! that is a common opinion: and yet I am somewhat sceptical of\nits truth,' replied Sidonia. 'I am inclined to believe that the social\nsystem of England is in infinitely greater danger than that of France.\nWe must not be misled by the agitated surface of this country. The\nfoundations of its order are deep and sure. Learn to understand France.\nFrance is a kingdom with a Republic for its capital. It has been always\nso, for centuries. From the days of the League to the days of the\nSections, to the days of 1830. It is still France, little changed; and\nonly more national, for it is less Frank and more Gallic; as England has\nbecome less Norman and more Saxon.'\n\n'And it is your opinion, then, that the present King may maintain\nhimself?'\n\n'Every movement in this country, however apparently discordant, seems to\ntend to that inevitable end. He would not be on the throne if the nature\nof things had not demanded his presence. The Kingdom of France required\na Monarch; the Republic of Paris required a Dictator. He comprised in\nhis person both qualifications; lineage and intellect; blood for the\nprovinces, brains for the city.'\n\n'What a position! what an individual!' exclaimed Coningsby. 'Tell me,'\nhe added, eagerly, 'what is he? This Prince of whom one hears in all\ncountries at all hours; on whose existence we are told the tranquillity,\nalmost the civilisation, of Europe depends, yet of whom we receive\naccounts so conflicting, so contradictory; tell me, you who can tell me,\ntell me what he is.'\n\nSidonia smiled at his earnestness. 'I have a creed of mine own,' he\nremarked, 'that the great characters of antiquity are at rare epochs\nreproduced for our wonder, or our guidance. Nature, wearied\nwith mediocrity, pours the warm metal into an heroic mould. When\ncircumstances at length placed me in the presence of the King of France,\nI recognised, ULYSSES!'\n\n'But is there no danger,' resumed Coningsby, after the pause of a few\nmoments, 'that the Republic of Paris may absorb the Kingdom of France?'\n\n'I suspect the reverse,' replied Sidonia. 'The tendency of advanced\ncivilisation is in truth to pure Monarchy. Monarchy is indeed a\ngovernment which requires a high degree of civilisation for its full\ndevelopment. It needs the support of free laws and manners, and of\na widely-diffused intelligence. Political compromises are not to be\ntolerated except at periods of rude transition. An educated nation\nrecoils from the imperfect vicariate of what is called a representative\ngovernment. Your House of Commons, that has absorbed all other powers\nin the State, will in all probability fall more rapidly than it rose.\nPublic opinion has a more direct, a more comprehensive, a more efficient\norgan for its utterance, than a body of men sectionally chosen. The\nPrinting-press is a political element unknown to classic or feudal\ntimes. It absorbs in a great degree the duties of the Sovereign, the\nPriest, the Parliament; it controls, it educates, it discusses. That\npublic opinion, when it acts, would appear in the form of one who has no\nclass interests. In an enlightened age the Monarch on the throne, free\nfrom the vulgar prejudices and the corrupt interests of the subject,\nbecomes again divine!'\n\nAt this moment they reached that part of the Boulevards which leads into\nthe Place of the Madeleine, whither Sidonia was bound; and Coningsby was\nabout to quit his companion, when Sidonia said:\n\n'I am only going a step over to the Rue Tronchet to say a few words to a\nfriend of mine, M. P----s. I shall not detain you five minutes; and you\nshould know him, for he has some capital pictures, and a collection of\nLimoges ware that is the despair of the dilettanti.'\n\nSo saying they turned down by the Place of the Madeleine, and soon\nentered the court of the hotel of M. P----s. That gentleman received\nthem in his gallery. After some general conversation, Coningsby turned\ntowards the pictures, and left Sidonia with their host. The collection\nwas rare, and interested Coningsby, though unacquainted with art. He\nsauntered on from picture to picture until he reached the end of the\ngallery, where an open door invited him into a suite of rooms also\nfull of pictures and objects of curiosity and art. As he was entering\na second chamber, he observed a lady leaning back in a cushioned\nchair, and looking earnestly on a picture. His entrance was unheard and\nunnoticed, for the lady's back was to the door; yet Coningsby, advancing\nin an angular direction, obtained nearly a complete view of her\ncountenance. It was upraised, gazing on the picture with an expression\nof delight; the bonnet thrown back, while the large sable cloak of the\ngazer had fallen partly off. The countenance was more beautiful than the\nbeautiful picture. Those glowing shades of the gallery to which love,\nand genius, and devotion had lent their inspiration, seemed without\nlife and lustre by the radiant expression and expressive presence which\nConingsby now beheld.\n\nThe finely-arched brow was a little elevated, the soft dark eyes were\nfully opened, the nostril of the delicate nose slightly dilated, the\nsmall, yet rich, full lips just parted; and over the clear, transparent\nvisage, there played a vivid glance of gratified intelligence.\n\nThe lady rose, advanced towards the picture, looked at it earnestly for\na few moments, and then, turning in a direction opposite to Coningsby,\nwalked away. She was somewhat above the middle stature, and yet could\nscarcely be called tall; a quality so rare, that even skilful dancers\ndo not often possess it, was hers; that elastic gait that is so winning,\nand so often denotes the gaiety and quickness of the spirit.\n\nThe fair object of his observation had advanced into other chambers,\nand as soon as it was becoming, Coningsby followed her. She had joined a\nlady and gentleman, who were examining an ancient carving in ivory. The\ngentleman was middle-aged and portly; the elder lady tall and elegant,\nand with traces of interesting beauty. Coningsby heard her speak; the\nwords were English, but the accent not of a native.\n\nIn the remotest part of the room, Coningsby, apparently engaged in\nexamining some of that famous Limoges ware of which Sidonia had spoken,\nwatched with interest and intentness the beautiful being whom he had\nfollowed, and whom he concluded to be the child of her companions. After\nsome little time, they quitted the apartment on their return to the\ngallery; Coningsby remained behind, caring for none of the rare and\nfanciful objects that surrounded him, yet compelled, from the fear of\nseeming obtrusive, for some minutes to remain. Then he too returned\nto the gallery, and just as he had gained its end, he saw the portly\ngentleman in the distance shaking hands with Sidonia, the ladies\napparently expressing their thanks and gratification to M. P----s, and\nthen all vanishing by the door through which Coningsby had originally\nentered.\n\n'What a beautiful countrywoman of yours!' said M. P----s, as Coningsby\napproached him.\n\n'Is she my countrywoman? I am glad to hear it; I have been admiring\nher,' he replied.\n\n'Yes,' said M. P----s, 'it is Sir Wallinger: one of your deputies; don't\nyou know him?'\n\n'Sir Wallinger!' said Coningsby, 'no, I have not that honour.' He looked\nat Sidonia.\n\n'Sir Joseph Wallinger,' said Sidonia, 'one of the new Whig baronets,\nand member for ----. I know him. He married a Spaniard. That is not his\ndaughter, but his niece; the child of his wife's sister. It is not easy\nto find any one more beautiful.'\n\nEND OF BOOK V.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe knowledge that Sidonia was in Paris greatly agitated Lady Monmouth.\nShe received the intimation indeed from Coningsby at dinner with\nsufficient art to conceal her emotion. Lord Monmouth himself was quite\npleased at the announcement. Sidonia was his especial favourite; he knew\nso much, had such an excellent judgment, and was so rich. He had always\nsomething to tell you, was the best man in the world to bet on, and\nnever wanted anything. A perfect character according to the Monmouth\nethics.\n\nIn the evening of the day that Coningsby met Sidonia, Lady Monmouth made\na little visit to the charming Duchess de G----t who was 'at home'\nevery other night in her pretty hotel, with its embroidered white satin\ndraperies, its fine old cabinets, and ancestral portraits of famous\nname, brave marshals and bright princesses of the olden time, on its\nwalls. These receptions without form, yet full of elegance, are what\nEnglish 'at homes' were before the Continental war, though now, by a\ncurious perversion of terms, the easy domestic title distinguishes in\nEngland a formally-prepared and elaborately-collected assembly, in which\neverything and every person are careful to be as little 'homely' as\npossible. In France, on the contrary, 'tis on these occasions, and in\nthis manner, that society carries on that degree and kind of intercourse\nwhich in England we attempt awkwardly to maintain by the medium of\nthat unpopular species of visitation styled a morning call; which all\ncomplain that they have either to make or to endure.\n\nNowhere was this species of reception more happily conducted than at\nthe Duchess de G----t's. The rooms, though small, decorated with taste,\nbrightly illumined; a handsome and gracious hostess, the Duke the very\npearl of gentlemen, and sons and daughters worthy of such parents. Every\nmoment some one came in, and some one went away. In your way from a\ndinner to a ball, you stopped to exchange agreeable _on dits_. It seemed\nthat every woman was pretty, every man a wit. Sure you were to find\nyourself surrounded by celebrities, and men were welcomed there, if they\nwere clever, before they were famous, which showed it was a house that\nregarded intellect, and did not seek merely to gratify its vanity by\nbeing surrounded by the distinguished.\n\nEnveloped in a rich Indian shawl, and leaning back on a sofa, Lady\nMonmouth was engaged in conversation with the courtly and classic Count\nM----\u00c3\u00a9, when, on casually turning her head, she observed entering the\nsaloon, Sidonia. She just caught his form bowing to the Duchess, and\ninstantly turned her head and replunged into her conversation with\nincreased interest. Lady Monmouth was a person who had the power of\nseeing all about her, everything and everybody, without appearing to\nlook. She was conscious that Sidonia was approaching her neighbourhood.\nHer heart beat in tumult; she dreaded to catch the eye of that very\nindividual whom she was so anxious to meet. He was advancing towards\nthe sofa. Instinctively, Lady Monmouth turned from the Count, and began\nspeaking earnestly to her other neighbour, a young daughter of the\nhouse, innocent and beautiful, not yet quite fledged, trying her wings\nin society under the maternal eye. She was surprised by the extreme\ninterest which her grand neighbour suddenly took in all her pursuits,\nher studies, her daily walks in the Bois de Boulogne. Sidonia, as the\nMarchioness had anticipated, had now reached the sofa. But no, it was to\nthe Count, and not to Lady Monmouth that he was advancing; and they were\nimmediately engaged in conversation. After some little time, when she\nhad become accustomed to his voice, and found her own heart throbbing\nwith less violence, Lucretia turned again, as if by accident, to the\nCount, and met the glance of Sidonia. She meant to have received him\nwith haughtiness, but her self-command deserted her; and slightly rising\nfrom the sofa, she welcomed him with a countenance of extreme pallor and\nwith some awkwardness.\n\nHis manner was such as might have assisted her, even had she been more\ntroubled. It was marked by a degree of respectful friendliness. He\nexpressed without reserve his pleasure at meeting her again; inquired\nmuch how she had passed her time since they last parted; asked more than\nonce after the Marquess. The Count moved away; Sidonia took his seat.\nHis ease and homage combined greatly relieved her. She expressed to\nhim how kind her Lord would consider his society, for the Marquess had\nsuffered in health since Sidonia last saw him. His periodical gout had\nleft him, which made him ill and nervous. The Marquess received his\nfriends at dinner every day. Sidonia, particularly amiable, offered\nhimself as a guest for the following one.\n\n'And do you go to the great ball to-morrow?' inquired Lucretia,\ndelighted with all that had occurred.\n\n'I always go to their balls,' said Sidonia, 'I have promised.'\n\nThere was a momentary pause; Lucretia happier than she had been for a\nlong time, her face a little flushed, and truly in a secret tumult of\nsweet thoughts, remembered she had been long there, and offering her\nhand to Sidonia, bade him adieu until to-morrow, while he, as was his\ncustom, soon repaired to the refined circle of the Countess de C-s-l-ne,\na lady whose manners he always mentioned as his fair ideal, and whose\nhouse was his favourite haunt.\n\nBefore to-morrow comes, a word or two respecting two other characters\nof this history connected with the family of Lord Monmouth. And first\nof Flora. La Petite was neither very well nor very happy. Her hereditary\ndisease developed itself; gradually, but in a manner alarming to those\nwho loved her. She was very delicate, and suffered so much from the\nweakness of her chest, that she was obliged to relinquish singing. This\nwas really the only tie between her and the Marchioness, who, without\nbeing a petty tyrant, treated her often with unfeeling haughtiness. She\nwas, therefore, now rarely seen in the chambers of the great. In her own\napartments she found, indeed, some distraction in music, for which she\nhad a natural predisposition, but this was a pursuit that only fed\nthe morbid passion of her tender soul. Alone, listening only to sweet\nsounds, or indulging in soft dreams that never could be realised, her\nexistence glided away like a vision, and she seemed to become every day\nmore fair and fragile. Alas! hers was the sad and mystic destiny to love\none whom she never met, and by whom, if she met him, she would scarcely,\nperhaps, be recognised. Yet in that passion, fanciful, almost ideal,\nher life was absorbed; nor for her did the world contain an existence,\na thought, a sensation, beyond those that sprang from the image of\nthe noble youth who had sympathised with her in her sorrows, and had\nsoftened the hard fortunes of dependence by his generous sensibility.\nHappy that, with many mortifications, it was still her lot to live under\nthe roof of one who bore his name, and in whose veins flowed the same\nblood! She felt indeed for the Marquess, whom she so rarely saw, and\nfrom whom she had never received much notice, prompted, it would seem,\nby her fantastic passion, a degree of reverence, almost of affection,\nwhich seemed occasionally, even to herself, as something inexplicable\nand without reason.\n\nAs for her fond step-father, M. Villebecque, the world fared very\ndifferently with him. His lively and enterprising genius, his ready and\nmultiform talents, and his temper which defied disturbance, had made\ntheir way. He had become the very right hand of Lord Monmouth; his only\ncounsellor, his only confidant; his secret agent; the minister of his\nwill. And well did Villebecque deserve this trust, and ably did he\nmaintain himself in the difficult position which he achieved. There was\nnothing which Villebecque did not know, nothing which he could not do,\nespecially at Paris. He was master of his subject; in all things the\nsecret of success, and without which, however they may from accident\ndazzle the world, the statesman, the orator, the author, all alike feel\nthe damning consciousness of being charlatans.\n\nConingsby had made a visit to M. Villebecque and Flora the day after\nhis arrival. It was a recollection and a courtesy that evidently greatly\ngratified them. Villebecque talked very much and amusingly; and Flora,\nwhom Coningsby frequently addressed, very little, though she listened\nwith great earnestness. Coningsby told her that he thought, from all he\nheard, she was too much alone, and counselled her to gaiety. But nature,\nthat had made her mild, had denied her that constitutional liveliness of\nbeing which is the graceful property of French women. She was a lily of\nthe valley, that loved seclusion and the tranquillity of virgin glades.\nAlmost every day, as he passed their _entresol_, Coningsby would look\ninto Villebecque's apartments for a moment, to ask after Flora.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nSidonia was to dine at Lord Monmouth's the day after he met Lucretia,\nand afterwards they were all to meet at a ball much talked of, and\nto which invitations were much sought; and which was to be given that\nevening by the Baroness S. de R----d.\n\nLord Monmouth's dinners at Paris were celebrated. It was generally\nagreed that they had no rivals; yet there were others who had as skilful\ncooks, others who, for such a purpose, were equally profuse in their\nexpenditure. What, then, was the secret spell of his success? The\nsimplest in the world, though no one seemed aware of it. His Lordship's\nplates were always hot: whereas at Paris, in the best appointed houses,\nand at dinners which, for costly materials and admirable art in their\npreparation, cannot be surpassed, the effect is always considerably\nlessened, and by a mode the most mortifying: by the mere circumstance\nthat every one at a French dinner is served on a cold plate. The reason\nof a custom, or rather a necessity, which one would think a nation so\ncelebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from, is really,\nit is believed, that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior\nthat it cannot endure the preparatory heat for dinner. The common white\npottery, for example, which is in general use, and always found at the\ncaf\u00c3\u00a9s, will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half-an-hour.\nNow, if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been\nso often on the point of completion, the fabrics of our unrivalled\npotteries, in exchange for their capital wines, would be found\nthroughout France. The dinners of both nations would be improved: the\nEnglish would gain a delightful beverage, and the French, for the first\ntime in their lives, would dine off hot plates. An unanswerable instance\nof the advantages of commercial reciprocity.\n\nThe guests at Lord Monmouth's to-day were chiefly Carlists, individuals\nbearing illustrious names, that animate the page of history, and are\nindissolubly bound up with the glorious annals of their great country.\nThey are the phantoms of a past, but real Aristocracy; an Aristocracy\nthat was founded on an intelligible principle; which claimed great\nprivileges for great purposes; whose hereditary duties were such, that\ntheir possessors were perpetually in the eye of the nation, and\nwho maintained, and, in a certain point of view justified, their\npre-eminence by constant illustration.\n\nIt pleased Lord Monmouth to show great courtesies to a fallen race with\nwhom he sympathised; whose fathers had been his friends in the days of\nhis hot youth; whose mothers he had made love to; whose palaces had been\nhis home; whose brilliant f\u00c3\u00aates he remembered; whose fanciful splendour\nexcited his early imagination; and whose magnificent and wanton luxury\nhad developed his own predisposition for boundless enjoyment. Soubise\nand his suppers; his cutlets and his mistresses; the profuse and\nembarrassed De Lauragais, who sighed for 'entire ruin,' as for a strange\nluxury, which perpetually eluded his grasp; these were the heroes of the\nolden time that Lord Monmouth worshipped; the wisdom of our ancestors\nwhich he appreciated; and he turned to their recollection for relief\nfrom the vulgar prudence of the degenerate days on which he had fallen:\ndays when nobles must be richer than other men, or they cease to have\nany distinction.\n\nIt was impossible not to be struck by the effective appearance of Lady\nMonmouth as she received her guests in grand toilet preparatory to the\nball; white satin and minever, a brilliant tiara. Her fine form, her\ncostume of a fashion as perfect as its materials were sumptuous, and her\npresence always commanding and distinguished, produced a general effect\nto which few could be insensible. It was the triumph of mien over mere\nbeauty of countenance.\n\nThe hotel of Madame S. de R----d is not more distinguished by its\nprofuse decoration, than by the fine taste which has guided the vast\nexpenditure. Its halls of arabesque are almost without a rival; there is\nnot the slightest embellishment in which the hand and feeling of art are\nnot recognised. The rooms were very crowded; everybody distinguished in\nParis was there: the lady of the Court, the duchess of the Faubourg, the\nwife of the financier, the constitutional Throne, the old Monarchy, the\nmodern Bourse, were alike represented. Marshals of the Empire, Ministers\nof the Crown, Dukes and Marquesses, whose ancestors lounged in the\nOeil de Boeuf; diplomatists of all countries, eminent foreigners of all\nnations, deputies who led sections, members of learned and scientific\nacademies, occasionally a stray poet; a sea of sparkling tiaras,\nbrilliant bouquets, glittering stars, and glowing ribbons, many\nbeautiful faces, many famous ones: unquestionably the general air of a\nfirstrate Parisian saloon, on a great occasion, is not easily equalled.\nIn London there is not the variety of guests; nor the same size and\nsplendour of saloons. Our houses are too small for reception.\n\nConingsby, who had stolen away from his grandfather's before the rest of\nthe guests, was delighted with the novelty of the splendid scene. He had\nbeen in Paris long enough to make some acquaintances, and mostly with\ncelebrated personages. In his long fruitless endeavour to enter the\nsaloon in which they danced, he found himself hustled against the\nillustrious Baron von H----t, whom he had sat next to at dinner a few\ndays before at Count M----\u00c3\u00a9's.\n\n'It is more difficult than cutting through the Isthmus of Panama,\nBaron,' said Coningsby, alluding to a past conversation.\n\n'Infinitely,' replied M. de H., smiling; 'for I would undertake to\ncut through the Isthmus, and I cannot engage that I shall enter this\nball-room.'\n\nTime, however, brought Coningsby into that brilliant chamber. What a\nblaze of light and loveliness! How coquettish are the costumes! How\nvivid the flowers! To sounds of stirring melody, beautiful beings move\nwith grace. Grace, indeed, is beauty in action.\n\nHere, where all are fair and everything is attractive, his eye is\nsuddenly arrested by one object, a form of surpassing grace among the\ngraceful, among the beauteous a countenance of unrivalled beauty.\n\nShe was young among the youthful; a face of sunshine amid all that\nartificial light; her head placed upon her finely-moulded shoulders with\na queen-like grace; a coronet of white roses on her dark brown hair; her\nonly ornament. It was the beauty of the picture-gallery.\n\nThe eye of Coningsby never quitted her. When the dance ceased, he had an\nopportunity of seeing her nearer. He met her walking with her cavalier,\nand he was conscious that she observed him. Finally he remarked that she\nresumed a seat next to the lady whom he had mistaken for her mother, but\nhad afterwards understood to be Lady Wallinger.\n\nConingsby returned to the other saloons: he witnessed the entrance and\nreception of Lady Monmouth, who moved on towards the ball-room. Soon\nafter this, Sidonia arrived; he came in with the still handsome and ever\ncourteous Duke D----s. Observing Coningsby, he stopped to present him to\nthe Duke. While thus conversing, the Duke, who is fond of the English,\nobserved, 'See, here is your beautiful countrywoman that all the world\nare talking of. That is her uncle. He brings to me letters from one of\nyour lords, whose name I cannot recollect.'\n\nAnd Sir Joseph and his lovely niece veritably approached. The Duke\naddressed them: asked them in the name of his Duchess to a concert on\nthe next Thursday; and, after a thousand compliments, moved on. Sidonia\nstopped; Coningsby could not refrain from lingering, but stood a little\napart, and was about to move away, when there was a whisper, of which,\nwithout hearing a word, he could not resist the impression that he was\nthe subject. He felt a little embarrassed, and was retiring, when he\nheard Sidonia reply to an inquiry of the lady, 'The same,' and then,\nturning to Coningsby, said aloud, 'Coningsby, Miss Millbank says that\nyou have forgotten her.'\n\nConingsby started, advanced, coloured a little, could not conceal\nhis surprise. The lady, too, though more prepared, was not without\nconfusion, and for an instant looked down. Coningsby recalled at that\nmoment the long dark eyelashes, and the beautiful, bashful countenance\nthat had so charmed him at Millbank; but two years had otherwise\neffected a wonderful change in the sister of his school-day friend,\nand transformed the silent, embarrassed girl into a woman of surpassing\nbeauty and of the most graceful and impressive mien.\n\n'It is not surprising that Mr. Coningsby should not recollect my niece,'\nsaid Sir Joseph, addressing Sidonia, and wishing to cover their mutual\nembarrassment; 'but it is impossible for her, or for anyone connected\nwith her, not to be anxious at all times to express to him our sense of\nwhat we all owe him.'\n\nConingsby and Miss Millbank were now in full routine conversation,\nconsisting of questions; how long she had been at Paris; when she had\nheard last from Millbank; how her father was; also, how was her brother.\nSidonia made an observation to Sir Joseph on a passer-by, and then\nhimself moved on; Coningsby accompanying his new friends, in a contrary\ndirection, to the refreshment-room, to which they were proceeding.\n\n'And you have passed a winter at Rome,' said Coningsby. 'How I envy you!\nI feel that I shall never be able to travel.'\n\n'And why not?'\n\n'Life has become so stirring, that there is ever some great cause that\nkeeps one at home.'\n\n'Life, on the contrary, so swift, that all may see now that of which\nthey once could only read.'\n\n'The golden and silver sides of the shield,' said Coningsby, with a\nsmile.\n\n'And you, like a good knight, will maintain your own.'\n\n'No, I would follow yours.'\n\n'You have not heard lately from Oswald?'\n\n'Oh, yes; I think there are no such faithful correspondents as we are; I\nonly wish we could meet.'\n\n'You will soon; but he is such a devotee of Oxford; quite a monk; and\nyou, too, Mr. Coningsby, are much occupied.'\n\n'Yes, and at the same time as Millbank. I was in hopes, when I once paid\nyou a visit, I might have found your brother.'\n\n'But that was such a rapid visit,' said Miss Millbank.\n\n'I always remember it with delight,' said Coningsby.\n\n'You were willing to be pleased; but Millbank, notwithstanding Rome,\ncommands my affections, and in spite of this surrounding splendour, I\ncould have wished to have passed my Christmas in Lancashire.'\n\n'Mr. Millbank has lately purchased a very beautiful place in the county.\nI became acquainted with Hellingsley when staying at my grandfather's.'\n\n'Ah! I have never seen it; indeed, I was much surprised that papa became\nits purchaser, because he never will live there; and Oswald, I am sure,\ncould never be tempted to quit Millbank. You know what enthusiastic\nideas he has of his order?'\n\n'Like all his ideas, sound, and high, and pure. I always duly\nappreciated your brother's great abilities, and, what is far more\nimportant, his lofty mind. When I recollect our Eton days, I cannot\nunderstand how more than two years have passed away without our being\ntogether. I am sure the fault is mine. I might now have been at Oxford\ninstead of Paris. And yet,' added Coningsby, 'that would have been a sad\nmistake, since I should not have had the happiness of being here.\n\n'Oh, yes, that would have been a sad mistake,' said Miss Millbank.\n\n'Edith,' said Sir Joseph, rejoining his niece, from whom he had been\nmomentarily separated, 'Edith, that is Monsieur Thiers.'\n\nIn the meantime Sidonia reached the ball-room, and sitting near the\nentrance was Lady Monmouth, who immediately addressed him. He was, as\nusual, intelligent and unimpassioned, and yet not without a delicate\ndeference which is flattering to women, especially if not altogether\nunworthy of it. Sidonia always admired Lucretia, and preferred her\nsociety to that of most persons. But the Lady was in error in supposing\nthat she had conquered or could vanquish his heart. Sidonia was one of\nthose men, not so rare as may be supposed, who shrink, above all things,\nfrom an adventure of gallantry with a woman in a position. He had\nneither time nor temper for sentimental circumvolutions. He detested the\ndiplomacy of passion: protocols, protracted negotiations, conferences,\ncorrespondence, treaties projected, ratified, violated. He had no genius\nfor the tactics of intrigue; your reconnoiterings, and marchings, and\ncountermarchings, sappings, and minings, assaults, sometimes surrenders,\nand sometimes repulses. All the solemn and studied hypocrisies were to\nhim infinitely wearisome; and if the movements were not merely formal,\nthey irritated him, distracted his feelings, disturbed the tenor of his\nmind, deranged his nervous system. Something of the old Oriental vein\ninfluenced him in his carriage towards women. He was oftener behind the\nscenes of the Opera-house than in his box; he delighted, too, in the\nsociety of _etairai_; Aspasia was his heroine. Obliged to appear much in\nwhat is esteemed pure society, he cultivated the acquaintance of clever\nwomen, because they interested him; but in such saloons his feminine\nacquaintances were merely psychological. No lady could accuse him of\ntrifling with her feelings, however decided might be his predilection\nfor her conversation. He yielded at once to an admirer; never trespassed\nby any chance into the domain of sentiment; never broke, by any accident\nor blunder, into the irregular paces of flirtation; was a man who\nnotoriously would never diminish by marriage the purity of his race;\nand one who always maintained that passion and polished life were quite\nincompatible. He liked the drawing-room, and he liked the Desert, but he\nwould not consent that either should trench on their mutual privileges.\n\nThe Princess Lucretia had yielded herself to the spell of Sidonia's\nsociety at Coningsby Castle, when she knew that marriage was impossible.\nBut she loved him; and with an Italian spirit. Now they met again,\nand she was the Marchioness of Monmouth, a very great lady, very much\nadmired, and followed, and courted, and very powerful. It is our great\nmoralist who tells us, in the immortal page, that an affair of gallantry\nwith a great lady is more delightful than with ladies of a lower degree.\nIn this he contradicts the good old ballad; but certain it is that\nDr. Johnson announced to Boswell, 'Sir, in the case of a Countess the\nimagination is more excited.'\n\nBut Sidonia was a man on whom the conventional superiorities of life\nproduced as little effect as a flake falling on the glaciers of the high\nAlps. His comprehension of the world and human nature was too vast\nand complete; he understood too well the relative value of things to\nappreciate anything but essential excellence; and that not too much. A\ncharming woman was not more charming to him because she chanced to be\nan empress in a particular district of one of the smallest planets; a\ncharming woman under any circumstances was not an unique animal. When\nSidonia felt a disposition to be spellbound, he used to review in his\nmemory all the charming women of whom he had read in the books of all\nliteratures, and whom he had known himself in every court and clime,\nand the result of his reflections ever was, that the charming woman in\nquestion was by no means the paragon, which some who had read, seen,\nand thought less, might be inclined to esteem her. There was, indeed,\nno subject on which Sidonia discoursed so felicitously as on woman, and\nnone on which Lord Eskdale more frequently endeavoured to attract him.\nHe would tell you Talmudical stories about our mother Eve and the Queen\nof Sheba, which would have astonished you. There was not a free lady of\nGreece, Leontium and Phryne, Lais, Danae, and Lamia, the Egyptian girl\nThonis, respecting whom he could not tell you as many diverting tales as\nif they were ladies of Loretto; not a nook of Athenseus, not an obscure\nscholiast, not a passage in a Greek orator, that could throw light on\nthese personages, which was not at his command. What stories he would\ntell you about Marc Antony and the actress Cytheris in their chariot\ndrawn by tigers! What a character would he paint of that Flora who gave\nher gardens to the Roman people! It would draw tears to your eyes. No\nman was ever so learned in the female manners of the last centuries of\npolytheism as Sidonia. You would have supposed that he had devoted his\nstudies peculiarly to that period if you had not chanced to draw him\nto the Italian middle ages. And even these startling revelations were\nalmost eclipsed by his anecdotes of the Court of Henry III. of France,\nwith every character of which he was as familiar as with the brilliant\ngroups that at this moment filled the saloons of Madame de R----d.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe image of Edith Millbank was the last thought of Coningsby, as he\nsank into an agitated slumber. To him had hitherto in general been\naccorded the precious boon of dreamless sleep. Homer tells us these\nphantasms come from Jove; they are rather the children of a distracted\nsoul. Coningsby this night lived much in past years, varied by\npainful perplexities of the present, which he could neither subdue\nnor comprehend. The scene flitted from Eton to the castle of his\ngrandfather; and then he found himself among the pictures of the Rue de\nTronchet, but their owner bore the features of the senior Millbank. A\nbeautiful countenance that was alternately the face in the mysterious\npicture, and then that of Edith, haunted him under all circumstances. He\nwoke little refreshed; restless, and yet sensible of some secret joy.\n\nHe woke to think of her of whom he had dreamed. The light had dawned on\nhis soul. Coningsby loved.\n\nAh! what is that ambition that haunts our youth, that thirst for power\nor that lust of fame that forces us from obscurity into the sunblaze of\nthe world, what are these sentiments so high, so vehement, so ennobling?\nThey vanish, and in an instant, before the glance of a woman!\n\nConingsby had scarcely quitted her side the preceding eve. He hung\nupon the accents of that clear sweet voice, and sought, with tremulous\nfascination, the gleaming splendour of those soft dark eyes. And now\nhe sat in his chamber, with his eyes fixed on vacancy. All thoughts and\nfeelings, pursuits, desires, life, merge in one absorbing sentiment.\n\nIt is impossible to exist without seeing her again, and instantly. He\nhad requested and gained permission to call on Lady Wallinger; he would\nnot lose a moment in availing himself of it. As early as was tolerably\ndecorous, and before, in all probability, they could quit their hotel,\nConingsby repaired to the Rue de Rivoli to pay his respects to his new\nfriends.\n\nAs he walked along, he indulged in fanciful speculations which connected\nEdith and the mysterious portrait of his mother. He felt himself, as\nit were, near the fulfilment of some fate, and on the threshold of some\ncritical discovery. He recalled the impatient, even alarmed, expressions\nof Rigby at Montem six years ago, when he proposed to invite young\nMillbank to his grandfather's dinner; the vindictive feud that existed\nbetween the two families, and for which political opinion, or even party\npassion, could not satisfactorily account; and he reasoned himself into\na conviction, that the solution of many perplexities was at hand, and\nthat all would be consummated to the satisfaction of every one, by his\nunexpected but inevitable agency.\n\nConingsby found Sir Joseph alone. The worthy Baronet was at any rate\nno participator in Mr. Millbank's vindictive feelings against Lord\nMonmouth. On the contrary, he had a very high respect for a Marquess,\nwhatever might be his opinions, and no mean consideration for a\nMarquess' grandson.\n\nSir Joseph had inherited a large fortune made by commerce, and had\nincreased it by the same means. He was a middle-class Whig, had\nfaithfully supported that party in his native town during the days they\nwandered in the wilderness, and had well earned his share of the milk\nand honey when they had vanquished the promised land. In the springtide\nof Liberalism, when the world was not analytical of free opinions, and\nodious distinctions were not drawn between Finality men and progressive\nReformers, Mr. Wallinger had been the popular leader of a powerful\nbody of his fellow-citizens, who had returned him to the first Reformed\nParliament, and where, in spite of many a menacing registration, he\nhad contrived to remain. He had never given a Radical vote without\nthe permission of the Secretary of the Treasury, and was not afraid\nof giving an unpopular one to serve his friends. He was not like that\ndistinguished Liberal, who, after dining with the late Whig Premier,\nexpressed his gratification and his gratitude, by assuring his Lordship\nthat he might count on his support on all popular questions.\n\n'I want men who will support the government on all unpopular questions,'\nreplied the witty statesman.\n\nMr. Wallinger was one of these men. His high character and strong purse\nwere always in the front rank in the hour of danger. His support in the\nHouse was limited to his votes; but in other places equally important,\nat a meeting at a political club, or in Downing Street, he could find\nhis tongue, take what is called a 'practical' view of a question, adopt\nwhat is called an 'independent tone,' reanimate confidence in ministers,\ncheck mutiny, and set a bright and bold example to the wavering. A man\nof his property, and high character, and sound views, so practical and\nso independent, this was evidently the block from which a Baronet should\nbe cut, and in due time he figured Sir Joseph.\n\nA Spanish gentleman of ample means, and of a good Catalan family, flying\nduring a political convulsion to England, arrived with his two\ndaughters at Liverpool, and bore letters of introduction to the house\nof Wallinger. Some little time after this, by one of those stormy\nvicissitudes of political fortune, of late years not unusual in the\nPeninsula, he returned to his native country, and left his children, and\nthe management of that portion of his fortune that he had succeeded in\nbringing with him, under the guardianship of the father of the present\nSir Joseph. This gentleman was about again to become an exile, when\nhe met with an untimely end in one of those terrible tumults of which\nBarcelona is the frequent scene.\n\nThe younger Wallinger was touched by the charms of one of his father's\nwards. Her beauty of a character to which he was unaccustomed,\nher accomplishments of society, and the refinement of her manners,\nconspicuous in the circle in which he lived, captivated him; and though\nthey had no heir, the union had been one of great felicity. Sir Joseph\nwas proud of his wife; he secretly considered himself, though his 'tone'\nwas as liberal and independent as in old days, to be on the threshold of\naristocracy, and was conscious that Lady Wallinger played her part not\nunworthily in the elevated circles in which they now frequently found\nthemselves. Sir Joseph was fond of great people, and not averse to\ntravel; because, bearing a title, and being a member of the British\nParliament, and always moving with the appendages of wealth, servants,\ncarriages, and couriers, and fortified with no lack of letters from\nthe Foreign Office, he was everywhere acknowledged, and received,\nand treated as a personage; was invited to court-balls, dined with\nambassadors, and found himself and his lady at every festival of\ndistinction.\n\nThe elder Millbank had been Joseph Wallinger's youthful friend.\nDifferent as were their dispositions and the rate of their abilities,\ntheir political opinions were the same; and commerce habitually\nconnected their interests. During a visit to Liverpool, Millbank had\nmade the acquaintance of the sister of Lady Wallinger, and had been a\nsuccessful suitor for her hand. This lady was the mother of Edith and of\nthe schoolfellow of Coningsby. It was only within a very few years\nthat she had died; she had scarcely lived long enough to complete the\neducation of her daughter, to whom she was devoted, and on whom she\nlavished the many accomplishments that she possessed. Lady Wallinger\nhaving no children, and being very fond of her niece, had watched over\nEdith with infinite solicitude, and finally had persuaded Mr. Millbank,\nthat it would be well that his daughter should accompany them in their\nsomewhat extensive travels. It was not, therefore, only that nature\nhad developed a beautiful woman out of a bashful girl since Coningsby's\nvisit to Millbank; but really, every means and every opportunity that\ncould contribute to render an individual capable of adorning the most\naccomplished circles of life, had naturally, and without effort, fallen\nto the fortunate lot of the manufacturer's daughter. Edith possessed\nan intelligence equal to those occasions. Without losing the native\nsimplicity of her character, which sprang from the heart, and which\nthe strong and original bent of her father's mind had fostered, she had\nimbibed all the refinement and facility of the polished circles in which\nshe moved. She had a clear head, a fine taste, and a generous spirit;\nhad received so much admiration, that, though by no means insensible to\nhomage, her heart was free; was strongly attached to her family; and,\nnotwithstanding all the splendour of Rome, and the brilliancy of Paris,\nher thoughts were often in her Saxon valley, amid the green hills and\nbusy factories of Millbank.\n\nSir Joseph, finding himself alone with the grandson of Lord Monmouth,\nwas not very anxious that the ladies should immediately appear. He\nthought this a good opportunity of getting at what are called 'the\nreal feelings of the Tory party;' and he began to pump with a seductive\nsemblance of frankness. For his part, he had never doubted that a\nConservative government was ultimately inevitable; had told Lord John\nso two years ago, and, between themselves, Lord John was of the same\nopinion. The present position of the Whigs was the necessary fate of\nall progressive parties; could not see exactly how it would end; thought\nsometimes it must end in a fusion of parties; but could not well see how\nthat could be brought about, at least at present. For his part, should\nbe happy to witness an union of the best men of all parties, for the\npreservation of peace and order, without any reference to any particular\nopinions. And, in that sense of the word, it was not at all impossible\nhe might find it his duty some day to support a Conservative government.\n\nSir Joseph was much astonished when Coningsby, who being somewhat\nimpatient for the entrance of the ladies was rather more abrupt than his\nwont, told the worthy Baronet that he looked, upon a government without\ndistinct principles of policy as only a stop-gap to a wide-spread and\ndemoralising anarchy; that he for one could not comprehend how a free\ngovernment could endure without national opinions to uphold it; and that\ngovernments for the preservation of peace and order, and nothing else,\nhad better be sought in China, or among the Austrians, the Chinese of\nEurope. As for Conservative government, the natural question was, What\ndo you mean to conserve? Do you mean to conserve things or only names,\nrealities or merely appearances? Or, do you mean to continue the\nsystem commenced in 1834, and, with a hypocritical reverence for the\nprinciples, and a superstitious adhesion to the forms, of the old\nexclusive constitution, carry on your policy by latitudinarian practice?\n\nSir Joseph stared; it was the first time that any inkling of the\nviews of the New Generation had caught his ear. They were strange and\nunaccustomed accents. He was extremely perplexed; could by no means make\nout what his companion was driving at; at length, with a rather knowing\nsmile, expressive as much of compassion as comprehension, he remarked,\n\n'Ah! I see; you are a regular Orangeman.'\n\n'I look upon an Orangeman,' said Coningsby, 'as a pure Whig; the only\nprofessor and practiser of unadulterated Whiggism.'\n\nThis was too much for Sir Joseph, whose political knowledge did not\nreach much further back than the ministry of the Mediocrities; hardly\ntouched the times of the Corresponding Society. But he was a cautious\nman, and never replied in haste. He was about feeling his way, when\nhe experienced the golden advantage of gaining time, for the ladies\nentered.\n\nThe heart of Coningsby throbbed as Edith appeared. She extended to him\nher hand; her face radiant with kind expression. Lady Wallinger seemed\ngratified also by his visit. She had much elegance in her manner;\na calm, soft address; and she spoke English with a sweet Doric\nirregularity. They all sat down, talked of the last night's ball, of a\nthousand things. There was something animating in the frank, cheerful\nspirit of Edith. She had a quick eye both for the beautiful and the\nridiculous, and threw out her observations in terse and vivid phrases.\nAn hour, and more than an hour, passed away, and Coningsby still found\nsome excuse not to depart. It seemed that on this morning they were\nabout to make an expedition into the antique city of Paris, to visit\nsome old hotels which retained their character; especially they had\nheard much of the hotel of the Archbishop of Sens, with its fortified\ncourtyard. Coningsby expressed great interest in the subject, and showed\nsome knowledge. Sir Joseph invited him to join the party, which of all\nthings in the world was what he most desired.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nNot a day elapsed without Coningsby being in the company of Edith. Time\nwas precious for him, for the spires and pinnacles of Cambridge\nalready began to loom in the distance, and he resolved to make the most\ndetermined efforts not to lose a day of his liberty. And yet to call\nevery morning in the Rue de Rivoli was an exploit which surpassed even\nthe audacity of love! More than once, making the attempt, his courage\nfailed him, and he turned into the gardens of the Tuileries, and only\nwatched the windows of the house. Circumstances, however, favoured him:\nhe received a letter from Oswald Millbank; he was bound to communicate\nin person this evidence of his friend's existence; and when he had to\nreply to the letter, he must necessarily inquire whether his friend's\nrelatives had any message to transmit to him. These, however, were only\nslight advantages. What assisted Coningsby in his plans and wishes was\nthe great pleasure which Sidonia, with whom he passed a great deal of\nhis time, took in the society of the Wallingers and their niece. Sidonia\npresented Lady Wallinger with his opera-box during her stay at Paris;\ninvited them frequently to his agreeable dinner-parties; and announced\nhis determination to give a ball, which Lady Wallinger esteemed a\ndelicate attention to Edith; while Lady Monmouth flattered herself that\nthe festival sprang from the desire she had expressed of seeing the\ncelebrated hotel of Sidonia to advantage.\n\nConingsby was very happy. His morning visits to the Rue de Rivoli seemed\nalways welcome, and seldom an evening elapsed in which he did not find\nhimself in the society of Edith. She seemed not to wish to conceal that\nhis presence gave her pleasure, and though she had many admirers, and\nhad an airy graciousness for all of them, Coningsby sometimes indulged\nthe exquisite suspicion that there was a flattering distinction in her\ncarriage to himself. Under the influence of these feelings, he began\ndaily to be more conscious that separation would be an intolerable\ncalamity; he began to meditate upon the feasibility of keeping a half\nterm, and of postponing his departure to Cambridge to a period nearer\nthe time when Edith would probably return to England.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the Parisian world talked much of the grand fete which\nwas about to be given by Sidonia. Coningsby heard much of it one day\nwhen dining at his grandfather's. Lady Monmouth seemed very intent on\nthe occasion. Even Lord Monmouth half talked of going, though, for his\npart, he wished people would come to him, and never ask him to their\nhouses. That was his idea of society. He liked the world, but he liked\nto find it under his own roof. He grudged them nothing, so that they\nwould not insist upon the reciprocity of cold-catching, and would eat\nhis good dinners instead of insisting on his eating their bad ones.\n\n'But Monsieur Sidonia's cook is a gem, they say,' observed an Attach\u00c3\u00a9 of\nan embassy.\n\n'I have no doubt of it; Sidonia is a man of sense, almost the only man\nof sense I know. I never caught him tripping. He never makes a false\nmove. Sidonia is exactly the sort of man I like; you know you cannot\ndeceive him, and that he does not want to deceive you. I wish he liked a\nrubber more. Then he would be perfect.'\n\n'They say he is going to be married,' said the Attach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n'Poh!' said Lord Monmouth.\n\n'Married!' exclaimed Lady Monmouth. 'To whom?'\n\n'To your beautiful countrywoman, \"la belle Anglaise,\" that all the world\ntalks of,' said the Attach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n'And who may she be, pray?' said the Marquess. 'I have so many beautiful\ncountrywomen.'\n\n'Mademoiselle Millbank,' said the Attach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n'Millbank!' said the Marquess, with a lowering brow. 'There are so many\nMillbanks. Do you know what Millbank this is, Harry?' he inquired of his\ngrandson, who had listened to the conversation with a rather embarrassed\nand even agitated spirit.\n\n'What, sir; yes, Millbank?' said Coningsby.\n\n'I say, do you know who this Millbank is?'\n\n'Oh! Miss Millbank: yes, I believe, that is, I know a daughter of the\ngentleman who purchased some property near you.'\n\n'Oh! that fellow! Has he got a daughter here?'\n\n'The most beautiful girl in Paris,' said the Attach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n'Lady Monmouth, have you seen this beauty, that Sidonia is going to\nmarry?' he added, with a fiendish laugh.\n\n'I have seen the young lady,' said Lady Monmouth; 'but I had not heard\nthat Monsieur Sidonia was about to marry her.'\n\n'Is she so very beautiful?' inquired another gentleman.\n\n'Yes,' said Lady Monmouth, calm, but pale.\n\n'Poh!' said the Marquess again.\n\n'I assure you that it is a fact,' said the Attach\u00c3\u00a9, 'not at least an\n_on-dit_. I have it from a quarter that could not well be mistaken.'\n\nBehold a little snatch of ordinary dinner gossip that left a very\npainful impression on the minds of three individuals who were present.\n\nThe name of Millbank revived in Lord Monmouth's mind a sense of defeat,\ndiscomfiture, and disgust; Hellingsley, lost elections, and Mr. Rigby;\nthree subjects which Lord Monmouth had succeeded for a time in expelling\nfrom his sensations. His lordship thought that, in all probability, this\nbeauty of whom they spoke so highly was not really the daughter of his\nfoe; that it was some confusion which had arisen from the similarity of\nnames: nor did he believe that Sidonia was going to marry her, whoever\nshe might be; but a variety of things had been said at dinner, and a\nnumber of images had been raised in his mind that touched his spleen. He\ntook his wine freely, and, the usual consequence of that proceeding with\nLord Monmouth, became silent and sullen. As for Lady Monmouth, she\nhad learnt that Sidonia, whatever might be the result, was paying very\nmarked attention to another woman, for whom undoubtedly he was giving\nthat very ball which she had flattered herself was a homage to her\nwishes, and for which she had projected a new dress of eclipsing\nsplendour.\n\nConingsby felt quite sure that the story of Sidonia's marriage\nwith Edith was the most ridiculous idea that ever entered into the\nimagination of man; at least he thought he felt quite sure. But the\nidlest and wildest report that the woman you love is about to marry\nanother is not comfortable. Besides, he could not conceal from himself\nthat, between the Wallingers and Sidonia there existed a remarkable\nintimacy, fully extended to their niece. He had seen her certainly on\nmore than one occasion in lengthened and apparently earnest conversation\nwith Sidonia, who, by-the-bye, spoke with her often in Spanish, and\nnever concealed his admiration of her charms or the interest he found\nin her society. And Edith; what, after all, had passed between Edith\nand himself which should at all gainsay this report, which he had been\nparticularly assured was not a mere report, but came from a quarter that\ncould not well be mistaken? She had received him with kindness. And\nhow should she receive one who was the friend and preserver of her only\nbrother, and apparently the intimate and cherished acquaintance of\nher future husband? Coningsby felt that sickness of the heart that\naccompanies one's first misfortune. The illusions of life seemed to\ndissipate and disappear. He was miserable; he had no confidence in\nhimself, in his future. After all, what was he? A dependent on a man of\nvery resolute will and passions. Could he forget the glance with which\nLord Monmouth caught the name of Millbank, and received the intimation\nof Hellingsley? It was a glance for a Spagnoletto or a Caravaggio to\ncatch and immortalise. Why, if Edith were not going to marry Sidonia,\nhow was he ever to marry her, even if she cared for him? Oh! what a\nfuture of unbroken, continuous, interminable misery awaited him! Was\nthere ever yet born a being with a destiny so dark and dismal? He was\nthe most forlorn of men, utterly wretched! He had entirely mistaken\nhis own character. He had no energy, no abilities, not a single eminent\nquality. All was over!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nIt was fated that Lady Monmouth should not be present at that ball,\nthe anticipation of which had occasioned her so much pleasure and some\npangs.\n\nOn the morning after that slight conversation, which had so disturbed\nthe souls, though unconsciously to each other, of herself and Coningsby,\nthe Marquess was driving Lucretia up the avenue Marigny in his phaeton.\nAbout the centre of the avenue the horses took fright, and started off\nat a wild pace. The Marquess was an experienced whip, calm, and with\nexertion still very powerful. He would have soon mastered the horses,\nhad not one of the reins unhappily broken. The horses swerved; the\nMarquess kept his seat; Lucretia, alarmed, sprang up, the carriage was\ndashed against the trunk of a tree, and she was thrown out of it, at\nthe very instant that one of the outriders had succeeded in heading the\nequipage and checking the horses.\n\nThe Marchioness was senseless. Lord Monmouth had descended from the\nphaeton; several passengers had assembled; the door of a contiguous\nhouse was opened; there were offers of service, sympathy, inquiries, a\nbabble of tongues, great confusion.\n\n'Get surgeons and send for her maid,' said Lord Monmouth to one of his\nservants.\n\nIn the midst of this distressing tumult, Sidonia, on horseback, followed\nby a groom, came up the avenue from the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. The empty\nphaeton, reins broken, horses held by strangers, all the appearances of\na misadventure, attracted him. He recognised the livery. He instantly\ndismounted. Moving aside the crowd, he perceived Lady Monmouth senseless\nand prostrate, and her husband, without assistance, restraining the\ninjudicious efforts of the bystanders.\n\n'Let us carry her in, Lord Monmouth,' said Sidonia, exchanging a\nrecognition as he took Lucretia in his arms, and bore her into the\ndwelling that was at hand. Those who were standing at the door assisted\nhim. The woman of the house and Lord Monmouth only were present.\n\n'I would hope there is no fracture,' said Sidonia, placing her on a\nsofa, 'nor does it appear to me that the percussion of the head, though\nconsiderable, could have been fatally violent. I have caught her pulse.\nKeep her in a horizontal position, and she will soon come to herself.'\n\nThe Marquess seated himself in a chair by the side of the sofa, which\nSidonia had advanced to the middle of the room. Lord Monmouth was silent\nand very serious. Sidonia opened the window, and touched the brow of\nLucretia with water. At this moment M. Villebecque and a surgeon entered\nthe chamber.\n\n'The brain cannot be affected, with that pulse,' said the surgeon;\n'there is no fracture.'\n\n'How pale she is!' said Lord Monmouth, as if he were examining a\npicture.\n\n'The colour seems to me to return,' said Sidonia.\n\nThe surgeon applied some restoratives which he had brought with him. The\nface of the Marchioness showed signs of life; she stirred.\n\n'She revives,' said the surgeon.\n\nThe Marchioness breathed with some force; again; then half-opened her\neyes, and then instantly closed them.\n\n'If I could but get her to take this draught,' said the surgeon.\n\n'Stop! moisten her lips first,' said Sidonia.\n\nThey placed the draught to her mouth; in a moment she put forth her hand\nas if to repress them, then opened her eyes again, and sighed.\n\n'She is herself,' said the surgeon.\n\n'Lucretia!' said the Marquess.\n\n'Sidonia!' said the Marchioness.\n\nLord Monmouth looked round to invite his friend to come forward.\n\n'Lady Monmouth!' said Sidonia, in a gentle voice.\n\nShe started, rose a little on the sofa, stared around her. 'Where am I?'\nshe exclaimed.\n\n'With me,' said the Marquess; and he bent forward to her, and took her\nhand.\n\n'Sidonia!' she again exclaimed, in a voice of inquiry.\n\n'Is here,' said Lord Monmouth. 'He carried you in after our accident.'\n\n'Accident! Why is he going to marry?'\n\nThe Marquess took a pinch of snuff.\n\nThere was an awkward pause in the chamber.\n\n'I think now,' said Sidonia to the surgeon, 'that Lady Monmouth would\ntake the draught.'\n\nShe refused it.\n\n'Try you, Sidonia,' said the Marquess, rather dryly.\n\n'You feel yourself again?' said Sidonia, advancing.\n\n'Would I did not!' said the Marchioness, with an air of stupor. 'What\nhas happened? Why am I here? Are you married?'\n\n'She wanders a little,' said Sidonia.\n\nThe Marquess took another pinch of snuff.\n\n'I could have borne even repulsion,' said Lady Monmouth, in a voice of\ndesolation, 'but not for another!'\n\n'M. Villebecque!' said the Marquess.\n\n'My Lord?'\n\nLord Monmouth looked at him with that irresistible scrutiny which would\ndaunt a galley-slave; and then, after a short pause, said, 'The carriage\nshould have arrived by this time. Let us get home.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nAfter the conversation at dinner which we have noticed, the restless\nand disquieted Coningsby wandered about Paris, vainly seeking in the\ndistraction of a great city some relief from the excitement of his mind.\nHis first resolution was immediately to depart for England; but when, on\nreflection, he was mindful that, after all, the assertion which had\nso agitated him might really be without foundation, in spite of many\ncircumstances that to his regardful fancy seemed to accredit it, his\nfirm resolution began to waver.\n\nThese were the first pangs of jealousy that Coningsby had ever\nexperienced, and they revealed to him the immensity of the stake which\nhe was hazarding on a most uncertain die.\n\nThe next morning he called in the Rue Rivoli, and was informed that the\nfamily were not at home. He was returning under the arcades, towards the\nRue St. Florentin, when Sidonia passed him in an opposite direction, on\nhorseback, and at a rapid rate. Coningsby, who was not observed by\nhim, could not resist a strange temptation to watch for a moment his\nprogress. He saw him enter the court of the hotel where the Wallinger\nfamily were staying. Would he come forth immediately? No. Coningsby\nstood still and pale. Minute followed minute. Coningsby flattered\nhimself that Sidonia was only speaking to the porter. Then he would\nfain believe Sidonia was writing a note. Then, crossing the street, he\nmounted by some steps the terrace of the Tuileries, nearly opposite the\nHotel of the Minister of Finance, and watched the house. A quarter of an\nhour elapsed; Sidonia did not come forth. They were at home to him; only\nto him. Sick at heart, infinitely wretched, scarcely able to guide his\nsteps, dreading even to meet an acquaintance, and almost feeling that\nhis tongue would refuse the office of conversation, he contrived to\nreach his grandfather's hotel, and was about to bury himself in his\nchamber, when on the staircase he met Flora.\n\nConingsby had not seen her for the last fortnight. Seeing her now, his\nheart smote him for his neglect, excusable as it really was. Any one\nelse at this time he would have hurried by without a recognition, but\nthe gentle and suffering Flora was too meek to be rudely treated by so\nkind a heart as Coningsby's.\n\nHe looked at her; she was pale and agitated. Her step trembled, while\nshe still hastened on.\n\n'What is the matter?' inquired Coningsby.\n\n'My Lord, the Marchioness, are in danger, thrown from their carriage.'\nBriefly she detailed to Coningsby all that had occurred; that M.\nVillebecque had already repaired to them; that she herself only this\nmoment had learned the intelligence that seemed to agitate her to the\ncentre. Coningsby instantly turned with her; but they had scarcely\nemerged from the courtyard when the carriage approached that brought\nLord and Lady Monmouth home. They followed it into the court. They were\nimmediately at its door.\n\n'All is right, Harry,' said the Marquess, calm and grave.\n\nConingsby pressed his grandfather's hand. Then he assisted Lucretia to\nalight.\n\n'I am quite well,' she said, 'now.'\n\n'But you must lean on me, dearest Lady Monmouth,' Coningsby said in a\ntone of tenderness, as he felt Lucretia almost sinking from him. And he\nsupported her into the hall of the hotel.\n\nLord Monmouth had lingered behind. Flora crept up to him, and with\nunwonted boldness offered her arm to the Marquess. He looked at her with\na glance of surprise, and then a softer expression, one indeed of an\nalmost winning sweetness, which, though rare, was not a stranger to\nhis countenance, melted his features, and taking the arm so humbly\npresented, he said,\n\n'Ma Petite, you look more frightened than any of us. Poor child!'\n\nHe had reached the top of the flight of steps; he withdrew his arm from\nFlora, and thanked her with all his courtesy.\n\n'You are not hurt, then, sir?' she ventured to ask with a look that\nexpressed the infinite solicitude which her tongue did not venture to\nconvey.\n\n'By no means, my good little girl;' and he extended his hand to her,\nwhich she reverently bent over and embraced.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nWhen Coningsby had returned to his grandfather's hotel that morning, it\nwas with a determination to leave Paris the next day for England;\nbut the accident to Lady Monmouth, though, as it ultimately appeared,\naccompanied by no very serious consequences, quite dissipated this\nintention. It was impossible to quit them so crudely at such a moment.\nSo he remained another day, and that was the day preceding Sidonia's\nf\u00c3\u00aate, which he particularly resolved not to attend. He felt it quite\nimpossible that he could again endure the sight of either Sidonia or\nEdith. He looked upon them as persons who had deeply injured him;\nthough they really were individuals who had treated him with invariable\nkindness. But he felt their existence was a source of mortification and\nmisery to him. With these feelings, sauntering away the last hours at\nParis, disquieted, uneasy; no present, no future; no enjoyment, no hope;\nreally, positively, undeniably unhappy; unhappy too for the first time\nin his life; the first unhappiness; what a companion piece for the\nfirst love! Coningsby, of all places in the world, in the gardens of the\nLuxembourg, encountered Sir Joseph Wallinger and Edith.\n\nTo avoid them was impossible; they met face to face; and Sir Joseph\nstopped, and immediately reminded him that it was three days since they\nhad seen him, as if to reproach him for so unprecedented a neglect. And\nit seemed that Edith, though she said not as much, felt the same. And\nConingsby turned round and walked with them. He told them he was going\nto leave Paris on the morrow.\n\n'And miss Monsieur de Sidonia's f\u00c3\u00aate, of which we have all talked\nso much!' said Edith, with unaffected surprise, and an expression of\ndisappointment which she in vain attempted to conceal.\n\n'The festival will not be less gay for my absence,' said Coningsby, with\nthat plaintive moroseness not unusual to despairing lovers.\n\n'If we were all to argue from the same premises, and act accordingly,'\nsaid Edith, 'the saloons would be empty. But if any person's absence\nwould be remarked, I should really have thought it would be yours. I\nthought you were one of Monsieur de Sidonia's great friends?'\n\n'He has no friends,' said Coningsby. 'No wise man has. What are friends?\nTraitors.'\n\nEdith looked much astonished. And then she said,\n\n'I am sure you have not quarrelled with Monsieur de Sidonia, for we have\njust parted with him.'\n\n'I have no doubt you have,' thought Coningsby.\n\n'And it is impossible to speak of another in higher terms than he spoke\nof you.' Sir Joseph observed how unusual it was for Monsieur de Sidonia\nto express himself so warmly.\n\n'Sidonia is a great man, and carries everything before him,' said\nConingsby. 'I am nothing; I cannot cope with him; I retire from the\nfield.'\n\n'What field?' inquired Sir Joseph, who did not clearly catch the drift\nof these observations. 'It appears to me that a field for action is\nexactly what Sidonia wants. There is no vent for his abilities and\nintelligence. He wastes his energy in travelling from capital to capital\nlike a King's messenger. The morning after his f\u00c3\u00aate he is going to\nMadrid.'\n\nThis brought some reference to their mutual movements. Edith spoke of\nher return to Lancashire, of her hope that Mr. Coningsby would soon see\nOswald; but Mr. Coningsby informed her that though he was going to leave\nParis, he had no intention of returning to England; that he had not yet\nquite made up his mind whither he should go; but thought that he\nshould travel direct to St. Petersburg. He wished to travel overland to\nAstrachan. That was the place he was particularly anxious to visit.\n\nAfter this incomprehensible announcement, they walked on for some\nminutes in silence, broken only by occasional monosyllables, with which\nConingsby responded at hazard to the sound remarks of Sir Joseph. As\nthey approached the Palace a party of English who were visiting the\nChamber of Peers, and who were acquainted with the companions of\nConingsby, encountered them. Amid the mutual recognitions, Coningsby,\nwas about to take his leave somewhat ceremoniously, but Edith held forth\nher hand, and said,\n\n'Is this indeed farewell?'\n\nHis heart was agitated, his countenance changed; he retained her hand\namid the chattering tourists, too full of their criticisms and their\negotistical commonplaces to notice what was passing. A sentimental\nebullition seemed to be on the point of taking place. Their eyes met.\nThe look of Edith was mournful and inquiring.\n\n'We will say farewell at the ball,' said Coningsby, and she rewarded him\nwith a radiant smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nSidonia lived in the Faubourg St. Germain, in a large hotel that, in\nold days, had belonged to the Crillons; but it had received at his hands\nsuch extensive alterations, that nothing of the original decoration, and\nlittle of its arrangement, remained.\n\nA flight of marble steps, ascending from a vast court, led into a\nhall of great dimensions, which was at the same time an orangery and\na gallery of sculpture. It was illumined by a distinct, yet soft\nand subdued light, which harmonised with the beautiful repose of the\nsurrounding forms, and with the exotic perfume that was wafted about.\nA gallery led from this hall to an inner hall of quite a different\ncharacter; fantastic, glittering, variegated; full of strange shapes and\ndazzling objects.\n\nThe roof was carved and gilt in that honeycomb style prevalent in the\nSaracenic buildings; the walls were hung with leather stamped in rich\nand vivid patterns; the floor was a flood of mosaic; about were statues\nof negroes of human size with faces of wild expression, and holding\nin their outstretched hands silver torches that blazed with an almost\npainful brilliancy.\n\nFrom this inner hall a double staircase of white marble led to the grand\nsuite of apartments.\n\nThese saloons, lofty, spacious, and numerous, had been decorated\nprincipally in encaustic by the most celebrated artists of Munich. The\nthree principal rooms were only separated from each other by columns,\ncovered with rich hangings, on this night drawn aside. The decoration\nof each chamber was appropriate to its purpose. On the walls of the\nball-room nymphs and heroes moved in measure in Sicilian landscapes,\nor on the azure shores of Aegean waters. From the ceiling beautiful\ndivinities threw garlands on the guests, who seemed surprised that\nthe roses, unwilling to quit Olympus, would not descend on earth.\nThe general effect of this fair chamber was heightened, too, by\nthat regulation of the house which did not permit any benches in the\nball-room. That dignified assemblage who are always found ranged in\nprecise discipline against the wall, did not here mar the flowing grace\nof the festivity. The chaperons had no cause to complain. A large saloon\nabounded in ottomans and easy chairs at their service, where their\ndelicate charges might rest when weary, or find distraction when not\nengaged.\n\nAll the world were at this f\u00c3\u00aate of Sidonia. It exceeded in splendour and\nluxury every entertainment that had yet been given. The highest rank,\neven Princes of the blood, beauty, fashion, fame, all assembled in a\nmagnificent and illuminated palace, resounding with exquisite melody.\n\nConingsby, though somewhat depressed, was not insensible to the magic\nof the scene. Since the passage in the gardens of the Luxembourg, that\ntone, that glance, he had certainly felt much relieved, happier. And yet\nif all were, with regard to Sidonia, as unfounded as he could possibly\ndesire, where was he then? Had he forgotten his grandfather, that fell\nlook, that voice of intense detestation? What was Millbank to him?\nWhere, what was the mystery? for of some he could not doubt. The Spanish\nparentage of Edith had only more perplexed Coningsby. It offered no\nsolution. There could be no connection between a Catalan family and his\nmother, the daughter of a clergyman in a midland county. That there\nwas any relationship between the Millbank family and his mother was\ncontradicted by the conviction in which he had been brought up, that\nhis mother had no relations; that she returned to England utterly\nfriendless; without a relative, a connection, an acquaintance to whom\nshe could appeal. Her complete forlornness was stamped upon his brain.\nTender as were his years when he was separated from her, he could yet\nrecall the very phrases in which she deplored her isolation; and there\nwere numerous passages in her letters which alluded to it. Coningsby\nhad taken occasion to sound the Wallingers on this subject; but he felt\nassured, from the manner in which his advances were met, that they knew\nnothing of his mother, and attributed the hostility of Mr. Millbank\nto his grandfather, solely to political emulation and local rivalries.\nStill there were the portrait and the miniature. That was a fact; a clue\nwhich ultimately, he was persuaded, must lead to some solution.\n\nConingsby had met with great social success at Paris. He was at once a\nfavourite. The Parisian dames decided in his favour. He was a specimen\nof the highest style of English beauty, which is popular in France. His\nair was acknowledged as distinguished. The men also liked him; he\nhad not quite arrived at that age when you make enemies. The moment,\ntherefore, that he found himself in the saloons of Sidonia, he was\naccosted by many whose notice was flattering; but his eye wandered,\nwhile he tried to be courteous and attempted to be sprightly. Where was\nshe? He had nearly reached the ball-room when he met her. She was on\nthe arm of Lord Beaumanoir, who had made her acquaintance at Rome, and\noriginally claimed it as the member of a family who, as the reader may\nperhaps not forget, had experienced some kindnesses from the Millbanks.\n\nThere were mutual and hearty recognitions between the young men; great\nexplanations where they had been, what they were doing, where they were\ngoing. Lord Beaumanoir told Coningsby he had introduced steeple-chases\nat Rome, and had parted with Sunbeam to the nephew of a Cardinal.\nConingsby securing Edith's hand for the next dance, they all moved on\ntogether to her aunt.\n\nLady Wallinger was indulging in some Roman reminiscences with the\nMarquess.\n\n'And you are not going to Astrachan to-morrow?' said Edith.\n\n'Not to-morrow,' said Coningsby.\n\n'You know that you said once that life was too stirring in these days to\npermit travel to a man?'\n\n'I wish nothing was stirring,' said Coningsby. 'I wish nothing to\nchange. All that I wish is, that this f\u00c3\u00aate should never end.'\n\n'Is it possible that you can be capricious? You perplex me very much.'\n\n'Am I capricious because I dislike change?'\n\n'But Astrachan?'\n\n'It was the air of the Luxembourg that reminded me of the Desert,' said\nConingsby.\n\nSoon after this Coningsby led Edith to the dance. It was at a ball that\nhe had first met her at Paris, and this led to other reminiscences;\nall most interesting. Coningsby was perfectly happy. All mysteries, all\ndifficulties, were driven from his recollection; he lived only in the\nexciting and enjoyable present. Twenty-one and in love!\n\nSome time after this, Coningsby, who was inevitably separated from\nEdith, met his host.\n\n'Where have you been, child,' said Sidonia, 'that I have not seen you\nfor some days? I am going to Madrid tomorrow.'\n\n'And I must think, I suppose, of Cambridge.'\n\n'Well, you have seen something; you will find it more profitable when\nyou have digested it: and you will have opportunity. That's the true\nspring of wisdom: meditate over the past. Adventure and Contemplation\nshare our being like day and night.'\n\nThe resolute departure for England on the morrow had already changed\ninto a supposed necessity of thinking of returning to Cambridge. In\nfact, Coningsby felt that to quit Paris and Edith was an impossibility.\nHe silenced the remonstrance of his conscience by the expedient of\nkeeping a half-term, and had no difficulty in persuading himself that\na short delay in taking his degree could not really be of the slightest\nconsequence.\n\nIt was the hour for supper. The guests at a French ball are not seen to\nadvantage at this period. The custom of separating the sexes for this\nrefreshment, and arranging that the ladies should partake of it by\nthemselves, though originally founded in a feeling of consideration\nand gallantry, and with the determination to secure, under all\ncircumstances, the convenience and comfort of the fair sex, is really,\nin its appearance and its consequences, anything but European, and\nproduces a scene which rather reminds one of the harem of a sultan than\na hall of chivalry. To judge from the countenances of the favoured fair,\nthey are not themselves particularly pleased; and when their repast is\nover they necessarily return to empty halls, and are deprived of the\ndance at the very moment when they may feel most inclined to participate\nin its graceful excitement.\n\nThese somewhat ungracious circumstances, however, were not attendant on\nthe festival of this night. There was opened in the Hotel of Sidonia for\nthe first time a banqueting-room which could contain with convenience\nall the guests. It was a vast chamber of white marble, the golden panels\nof the walls containing festive sculptures by Schwanthaler, relieved by\nencaustic tinting. In its centre was a fountain, a group of Bacchantes\nencircling Dionysos; and from this fountain, as from a star, diverged\nthe various tables from which sprang orange-trees in fruit and flower.\n\nThe banquet had but one fault; Coningsby was separated from Edith. The\nDuchess of Grand Cairo, the beautiful wife of the heir of one of the\nImperial illustrations, had determined to appropriate Coningsby as\nher cavalier for the moment. Distracted, he made his escape; but his\nwandering eye could not find the object of its search; and he fell\nprisoner to the charming Princess de Petitpoix, a Carlist chieftain,\nwhose witty words avenged the cause of fallen dynasties and a cashiered\nnobility.\n\nBehold a scene brilliant in fancy, magnificent in splendour! All the\ncircumstances of his life at this moment were such as acted forcibly\non the imagination of Coningsby. Separated from Edith, he had still the\ndelight of seeing her the paragon of that bright company, the consummate\nbeing whom he adored! and who had spoken to him in a voice sweeter than\na serenade, and had bestowed on him a glance softer than moonlight! The\nlord of the palace, more distinguished even for his capacity than his\nboundless treasure, was his chosen friend; gained under circumstances\nof romantic interest, when the reciprocal influence of their personal\nqualities was affected by no accessory knowledge of their worldly\npositions. He himself was in the very bloom of youth and health; the\nchild of a noble house, rich for his present wants, and with a future of\nconsiderable fortunes. Entrancing love and dazzling friendship, a\nhigh ambition and the pride of knowledge, the consciousness of a great\nprosperity, the vague, daring energies of the high pulse of twenty-one,\nall combined to stimulate his sense of existence, which, as he looked\naround him at the beautiful objects and listened to the delicious\nsounds, seemed to him a dispensation of almost supernatural ecstasy.\n\nAbout an hour after this, the ball-room still full, but the other\nsaloons gradually emptying, Coningsby entered a chamber which seemed\ndeserted. Yet he heard sounds, as it were, of earnest conversation. It\nwas the voice that invited his progress; he advanced another step, then\nsuddenly stopped. There were two individuals in the room, by whom he was\nunnoticed. They were Sidonia and Miss Millbank. They were sitting on a\nsofa, Sidonia holding her hand and endeavouring, as it seemed, to soothe\nher. Her tones were tremulous; but the expression of her face was fond\nand confiding. It was all the work of a moment. Coningsby instantly\nwithdrew, yet could not escape hearing an earnest request from Edith to\nher companion that he would write to her.\n\nIn a few seconds Coningsby had quitted the hotel of Sidonia, and the\nnext day found him on his road to England.\n\nEND OF BOOK VI.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was one of those gorgeous and enduring sunsets that seemed to linger\nas if they wished to celebrate the mid-period of the year. Perhaps the\nbeautiful hour of impending twilight never exercises a more effective\ninfluence on the soul than when it descends on the aspect of some\ndistant and splendid city. What a contrast between the serenity and\nrepose of our own bosoms and the fierce passions and destructive cares\ngirt in the walls of that multitude whose domes and towers rise in\npurple lustre against the resplendent horizon!\n\nAnd yet the disturbing emotions of existence and the bitter inheritance\nof humanity should exercise but a modified sway, and entail but a light\nburden, within the circle of the city into which the next scene of our\nhistory leads us. For it is the sacred city of study, of learning,\nand of faith; and the declining beam is resting on the dome of the\nRadcliffe, lingering on the towers of Christchurch and Magdalen,\nsanctifying the spires and pinnacles of holy St. Mary's.\n\nA young Oxonian, who had for some time been watching the city in the\nsunset, from a rising ground in its vicinity, lost, as it would seem, in\nmeditation, suddenly rose, and looking at his watch, as if remindful\nof some engagement, hastened his return at a rapid pace. He reached\nthe High Street as the Blenheim light post coach dashed up to the Star\nHotel, with that brilliant precision which even the New Generation can\nremember, and yet which already ranks among the traditions of English\nmanners. A peculiar and most animating spectacle used to be the arrival\nof a firstrate light coach in a country town! The small machine,\ncrowded with so many passengers, the foaming and curvetting leaders, the\nwheelers more steady and glossy, as if they had not done their ten miles\nin the hour, the triumphant bugle of the guard, and the haughty routine\nwith which the driver, as he reached his goal, threw his whip to the\nobedient ostlers in attendance; and, not least, the staring crowd, a\nlittle awestruck, and looking for the moment at the lowest official of\nthe stable with considerable respect, altogether made a picture which\none recollects with cheerfulness, and misses now in many a dreary\nmarket-town.\n\nOur Oxonian was a young man about the middle height, and naturally of a\nthoughtful expression and rather reserved mien. The general character of\nhis countenance was, indeed, a little stern, but it broke into an almost\nbewitching smile, and a blush suffused his face, as he sprang forward\nand welcomed an individual about the same age, who had jumped off the\nBlenheim.\n\n'Well, Coningsby!' he exclaimed, extending both his hands.\n\n'By Jove! my dear Millbank, we have met at last,' said his friend.\n\nAnd here we must for a moment revert to what had occurred to Coningsby\nsince he so suddenly quitted Paris at the beginning of the year. The\nwound he had received was deep to one unused to wounds. Yet, after all,\nnone had outraged his feelings, no one had betrayed his hopes. He had\nloved one who had loved another. Misery, but scarcely humiliation. And\nyet 'tis a bitter pang under any circumstances to find another preferred\nto yourself. It is about the same blow as one would probably feel if\nfalling from a balloon. Your Icarian flight melts into a grovelling\nexistence, scarcely superior to that of a sponge or a coral, or redeemed\nonly from utter insensibility by your frank detestation of your rival.\nIt is quite impossible to conceal that Coningsby had imbibed for Sidonia\na certain degree of aversion, which, in these days of exaggerated\nphrase, might even be described as hatred. And Edith was so beautiful!\nAnd there had seemed between them a sympathy so native and spontaneous,\ncreating at once the charm of intimacy without any of the disenchanting\nattributes that are occasionally its consequence. He would recall the\ntones of her voice, the expression of her soft dark eye, the airy spirit\nand frank graciousness, sometimes even the flattering blush, with which\nshe had ever welcomed one of whom she had heard so long and so kindly.\nIt seemed, to use a sweet and homely phrase, that they were made for\neach other; the circumstances of their mutual destinies might have\ncombined into one enchanting fate.\n\nAnd yet, had she accorded him that peerless boon, her heart, with what\naspect was he to communicate this consummation of all his hopes to his\ngrandfather, ask Lord Monmouth for his blessing, and the gracious favour\nof an establishment for the daughter of his foe, of a man whose name was\nnever mentioned except to cloud his visage? Ah! what was that mystery\nthat connected the haughty house of Coningsby with the humble blood of\nthe Lancashire manufacturer? Why was the portrait of his mother beneath\nthe roof of Millbank? Coningsby had delicately touched upon the subject\nboth with Edith and the Wallingers, but the result of his inquiries\nonly involved the question in deeper gloom. Edith had none but maternal\nrelatives: more than once she had mentioned this, and the Wallingers, on\nother occasions, had confirmed the remark. Coningsby had sometimes drawn\nthe conversation to pictures, and he would remind her with playfulness\nof their first unconscious meeting in the gallery of the Rue Tronchet;\nthen he remembered that Mr. Millbank was fond of pictures; then he\nrecollected some specimens of Mr. Millbank's collection, and after\ntouching on several which could not excite suspicion, he came to\n'a portrait, a portrait of a lady; was it a portrait or an ideal\ncountenance?'\n\nEdith thought she had heard it was a portrait, but she was by no means\ncertain, and most assuredly was quite unacquainted with the name of the\noriginal, if there were an original.\n\nConingsby addressed himself to the point with Sir Joseph. He inquired of\nthe uncle explicitly whether he knew anything on the subject. Sir Joseph\nwas of opinion that it was something that Millbank had somewhere 'picked\nup.' Millbank used often to 'pick up' pictures.\n\nDisappointed in his love, Coningsby sought refuge in the excitement\nof study, and in the brooding imagination of an aspiring spirit. The\nsoftness of his heart seemed to have quitted him for ever. He recurred\nto his habitual reveries of political greatness and public distinction.\nAnd as it ever seemed to him that no preparation could be complete\nfor the career which he planned for himself, he devoted himself with\nincreased ardour to that digestion of knowledge which converts it into\nwisdom. His life at Cambridge was now a life of seclusion. With the\nexception of a few Eton friends, he avoided all society. And, indeed,\nhis acquisitions during this term were such as few have equalled, and\ncould only have been mastered by a mental discipline of a severe and\nexalted character. At the end of the term Coningsby took his degree, and\nin a few days was about to quit that university where, on the whole,\nhe had passed three serene and happy years in the society of fond and\nfaithful friends, and in ennobling pursuits. He had many plans for his\nimpending movements, yet none of them very mature ones. Lord Vere wished\nConingsby to visit his family in the north, and afterwards to go to\nScotland together: Coningsby was more inclined to travel for a year.\nAmid this hesitation a circumstance occurred which decided him to adopt\nneither of these courses.\n\nIt was Commencement, and coming out of the quadrangle of St. John's,\nConingsby came suddenly upon Sir Joseph and Lady Wallinger, who were\nvisiting the marvels and rarities of the university. They were alone.\nConingsby was a little embarrassed, for he could not forget the abrupt\nmanner in which he had parted from them; but they greeted him with\nso much cordiality that he instantly recovered himself, and, turning,\nbecame their companion. He hardly ventured to ask after Edith: at\nlength, in a depressed tone and a hesitating manner, he inquired whether\nthey had lately seen Miss Millbank. He was himself surprised at the\nextreme light-heartedness which came over him the moment he heard she\nwas in England, at Millbank, with her family. He always very much liked\nLady Wallinger, but this morning he hung over her like a lover, lavished\non her unceasing and the most delicate attentions, seemed to exist only\nin the idea of making the Wallingers enjoy and understand Cambridge;\nand no one else was to be their guide at any place or under any\ncircumstances. He told them exactly what they were to see; how they were\nto see it; when they were to see it. He told them of things which nobody\ndid see, but which they should. He insisted that Sir Joseph should dine\nwith him in hall; Sir Joseph could not think of leaving Lady Wallinger;\nLady Wallinger could not think of Sir Joseph missing an opportunity that\nmight never offer again. Besides, they might both join her after dinner.\nExcept to give her husband a dinner, Coningsby evidently intended never\nto leave her side.\n\nAnd the next morning, the occasion favourable, being alone with the\nlady, Sir Joseph bustling about a carriage, Coningsby said suddenly,\nwith a countenance a little disturbed, and in a low voice, 'I was\npleased, I mean surprised, to hear that there was still a Miss Millbank;\nI thought by this time she might have borne another name?'\n\nLady Wallinger looked at him with an expression of some perplexity, and\nthen said, 'Yes, Edith was much admired; but she need not be precipitate\nin marrying. Marriage is for a woman _the_ event. Edith is too precious\nto be carelessly bestowed.'\n\n'But I understood,' said Coningsby, 'when I left Paris,' and here, he\nbecame very confused, 'that Miss Millbank was engaged, on the point of\nmarriage.'\n\n'With whom?'\n\n'Our friend Sidonia.'\n\n'I am sure that Edith would never marry Monsieur de Sidonia, nor\nMonsieur de Sidonia, Edith. 'Tis a preposterous idea!' said Lady\nWallinger.\n\n'But he very much admired her?' said Coningsby with a searching eye.\n\n'Possibly,' said Lady Wallinger; 'but he never even intimated his\nadmiration.'\n\n'But he was very attentive to Miss Millbank?'\n\n'Not more than our intimate friendship authorised, and might expect.'\n\n'You have known Sidonia a long time?'\n\n'It was Monsieur de Sidonia's father who introduced us to the care\nof Mr. Wallinger,' said Lady Wallinger, 'and therefore I have ever\nentertained for his son a sincere regard. Besides, I look upon him as\na compatriot. Recently he has been even more than usually kind to us,\nespecially to Edith. While we were at Paris he recovered for her a great\nnumber of jewels which had been left to her by her uncle in Spain;\nand, what she prized infinitely more, the whole of her mother's\ncorrespondence which she maintained with this relative since her\nmarriage. Nothing but the influence of Sidonia could have effected this.\nTherefore, of course, Edith is attached to him almost as much as I am.\nIn short, he is our dearest friend; our counsellor in all our cares. But\nas for marrying him, the idea is ridiculous to those who know Monsieur\nSidonia. No earthly consideration would ever induce him to impair that\npurity of race on which he prides himself. Besides, there are other\nobvious objections which would render an alliance between him and my\nniece utterly impossible: Edith is quite as devoted to her religion as\nMonsieur Sidonia can be to his race.'\n\nA ray of light flashed on the brain of Coningsby as Lady Wallinger said\nthese words. The agitated interview, which never could be explained\naway, already appeared in quite a different point of view. He became\npensive, remained silent, was relieved when Sir Joseph, whose return he\nhad hitherto deprecated, reappeared. Coningsby learnt in the course of\nthe day that the Wallingers were about to make, and immediately, a visit\nto Hellingsley; their first visit; indeed, this was the first year that\nMr. Millbank had taken up his abode there. He did not much like the\nchange of life, Sir Joseph told Coningsby, but Edith was delighted with\nHellingsley, which Sir Joseph understood was a very distinguished place,\nwith fine gardens, of which his niece was particularly fond.\n\nWhen Coningsby returned to his rooms, those rooms which he was soon\nabout to quit for ever, in arranging some papers preparatory to his\nremoval, his eye lighted on a too-long unanswered letter of Oswald\nMillbank. Coningsby had often projected a visit to Oxford, which he much\ndesired to make, but hitherto it had been impossible for him to effect\nit, except in the absence of Millbank; and he had frequently postponed\nit that he might combine his first visit to that famous seat of learning\nwith one to his old schoolfellow and friend. Now that was practicable.\nAnd immediately Coningsby wrote to apprise Millbank that he had\ntaken his degree, was free, and prepared to pay him immediately the\nlong-projected visit. Three years and more had elapsed since they had\nquitted Eton. How much had happened in the interval! What new ideas, new\nfeelings, vast and novel knowledge! Though they had not met, they were\nnevertheless familiar with the progress and improvement of each other's\nminds. Their suggestive correspondence was too valuable to both of them\nto have been otherwise than cherished. And now they were to meet on\nthe eve of entering that world for which they had made so sedulous a\npreparation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThere are few things in life more interesting than an unrestrained\ninterchange of ideas with a congenial spirit, and there are few things\nmore rare. How very seldom do you encounter in the world a man of great\nabilities, acquirements, experience, who will unmask his mind, unbutton\nhis brains, and pour forth in careless and picturesque phrase all the\nresults of his studies and observation; his knowledge of men, books, and\nnature. On the contrary, if a man has by any chance what he conceives\nan original idea, he hoards it as if it were old gold; and rather avoids\nthe subject with which he is most conversant, from fear that you may\nappropriate his best thoughts. One of the principal causes of our\nrenowned dulness in conversation is our extreme intellectual jealousy.\nIt must be admitted that in this respect authors, but especially poets,\nbear the palm. They never think they are sufficiently appreciated, and\nlive in tremor lest a brother should distinguish himself. Artists have\nthe repute of being nearly as bad. And as for a small rising politician,\na clever speech by a supposed rival or suspected candidate for office\ndestroys his appetite and disturbs his slumbers.\n\nOne of the chief delights and benefits of travel is, that one is\nperpetually meeting men of great abilities, of original mind, and rare\nacquirements, who will converse without reserve. In these discourses\nthe intellect makes daring leaps and marvellous advances. The tone that\ncolours our afterlife is often caught in these chance colloquies, and\nthe bent given that shapes a career.\n\nAnd yet perhaps there is no occasion when the heart is more open, the\nbrain more quick, the memory more rich and happy, or the tongue more\nprompt and eloquent, than when two school-day friends, knit by every\nsympathy of intelligence and affection, meet at the close of their\ncollege careers, after a long separation, hesitating, as it were, on\nthe verge of active life, and compare together their conclusions of the\ninterval; impart to each other all their thoughts and secret plans\nand projects; high fancies and noble aspirations; glorious visions of\npersonal fame and national regeneration.\n\nAh! why should such enthusiasm ever die! Life is too short to be\nlittle. Man is never so manly as when he feels deeply, acts boldly, and\nexpresses himself with frankness and with fervour.\n\nMost assuredly there never was a congress of friendship wherein more was\nsaid and felt than in this meeting, so long projected, and yet perhaps\non the whole so happily procrastinated, between Coningsby and Millbank.\nIn a moment they seemed as if they had never parted. Their faithful\ncorrespondence indeed had maintained the chain of sentiment unbroken.\nBut details are only for conversation. Each poured forth his mind\nwithout stint. Not an author that had influenced their taste or judgment\nbut was canvassed and criticised; not a theory they had framed or a\nprinciple they had adopted that was not confessed. Often, with boyish\nglee still lingering with their earnest purpose, they shouted as they\ndiscovered that they had formed the same opinion or adopted the same\nconclusion. They talked all day and late into the night. They condensed\ninto a week the poignant conclusions of three years of almost unbroken\nstudy. And one night, as they sat together in Millbank's rooms at\nOriel, their conversation having for some time taken a political colour,\nMillbank said,\n\n'Now tell me, Coningsby, exactly what you conceive to be the state of\nparties in this country; for it seems to me that if we penetrate the\nsurface, the classification must be more simple than their many names\nwould intimate.'\n\n'The principle of the exclusive constitution of England having been\nconceded by the Acts of 1827-8-32,' said Coningsby, 'a party has arisen\nin the State who demand that the principle of political liberalism\nshall consequently be carried to its extent; which it appears to them is\nimpossible without getting rid of the fragments of the old constitution\nthat remain. This is the destructive party; a party with distinct and\nintelligible principles. They seek a specific for the evils of our\nsocial system in the general suffrage of the population.\n\n'They are resisted by another party, who, having given up exclusion,\nwould only embrace as much liberalism as is necessary for the moment;\nwho, without any embarrassing promulgation of principles, wish to keep\nthings as they find them as long as they can, and then will manage them\nas they find them as well as they can; but as a party must have the\nsemblance of principles, they take the names of the things that they\nhave destroyed. Thus they are devoted to the prerogatives of the Crown,\nalthough in truth the Crown has been stripped of every one of its\nprerogatives; they affect a great veneration for the constitution in\nChurch and State, though every one knows that the constitution in Church\nand State no longer exists; they are ready to stand or fall with the\n\"independence of the Upper House of Parliament\", though, in practice,\nthey are perfectly aware that, with their sanction, \"the Upper House\"\nhas abdicated its initiatory functions, and now serves only as a court\nof review of the legislation of the House of Commons. Whenever public\nopinion, which this party never attempts to form, to educate, or to\nlead, falls into some violent perplexity, passion, or caprice, this\nparty yields without a struggle to the impulse, and, when the storm has\npassed, attempts to obstruct and obviate the logical and, ultimately,\nthe inevitable results of the very measures they have themselves\noriginated, or to which they have consented. This is the Conservative\nparty.\n\n'I care not whether men are called Whigs or Tories, Radicals or\nChartists, or by what nickname a bustling and thoughtless race may\ndesignate themselves; but these two divisions comprehend at present the\nEnglish nation.\n\n'With regard to the first school, I for one have no faith in the\nremedial qualities of a government carried on by a neglected democracy,\nwho, for three centuries, have received no education. What prospect does\nit offer us of those high principles of conduct with which we have\nfed our imaginations and strengthened our will? I perceive none of the\nelements of government that should secure the happiness of a people and\nthe greatness of a realm.\n\n'But in my opinion, if Democracy be combated only by Conservatism,\nDemocracy must triumph, and at no distant date. This, then, is our\nposition. The man who enters public life at this epoch has to choose\nbetween Political Infidelity and a Destructive Creed.'\n\n'This, then,' said Millbank, 'is the dilemma to which we are brought\nby nearly two centuries of Parliamentary Monarchy and Parliamentary\nChurch.'\n\n''Tis true,' said Coningsby. 'We cannot conceal it from ourselves,\nthat the first has made Government detested, and the second Religion\ndisbelieved.'\n\n'Many men in this country,' said Millbank, 'and especially in the class\nto which I belong, are reconciled to the contemplation of democracy;\nbecause they have accustomed themselves to believe, that it is the\nonly power by which we can sweep away those sectional privileges and\ninterests that impede the intelligence and industry of the community.'\n\n'And yet,' said Coningsby, 'the only way to terminate what, in the\nlanguage of the present day, is called Class Legislation, is not to\nentrust power to classes. You would find a Locofoco majority as much\naddicted to Class Legislation as a factitious aristocracy. The only\npower that has no class sympathy is the Sovereign.'\n\n'But suppose the case of an arbitrary Sovereign, what would be your\ncheck against him?'\n\n'The same as against an arbitrary Parliament.'\n\n'But a Parliament is responsible.'\n\n'To whom?'\n\n'To their constituent body.'\n\n'Suppose it was to vote itself perpetual?'\n\n'But public opinion would prevent that.'\n\n'And is public opinion of less influence on an individual than on a\nbody?'\n\n'But public opinion may be indifferent. A nation may be misled, may be\ncorrupt.'\n\n'If the nation that elects the Parliament be corrupt, the elected body\nwill resemble it. The nation that is corrupt deserves to fall. But this\nonly shows that there is something to be considered beyond forms of\ngovernment, national character. And herein mainly should we repose our\nhopes. If a nation be led to aim at the good and the great, depend upon\nit, whatever be its form, the government will respond to its convictions\nand its sentiments.'\n\n'Do you then declare against Parliamentary government.'\n\n'Far from it: I look upon political change as the greatest of evils,\nfor it comprehends all. But if we have no faith in the permanence of\nthe existing settlement, if the very individuals who established it are,\nyear after year, proposing their modifications or their reconstructions;\nso also, while we uphold what exists, ought we to prepare ourselves for\nthe change we deem impending?\n\n'Now I would not that either ourselves, or our fellow-citizens, should\nbe taken unawares as in 1832, when the very men who opposed the Reform\nBill offered contrary objections to it which destroyed each other, so\nignorant were they of its real character, its historical causes, its\npolitical consequences. We should now so act that, when the occasions\narrives, we should clearly comprehend what we want, and have formed an\nopinion as to the best means by which that want can be supplied.\n\n'For this purpose I would accustom the public mind to the contemplation\nof an existing though torpid power in the constitution, capable\nof removing our social grievances, were we to transfer to it those\nprerogatives which the Parliament has gradually usurped, and used in\na manner which has produced the present material and moral\ndisorganisation. The House of Commons is the house of a few; the\nSovereign is the sovereign of all. The proper leader of the people is\nthe individual who sits upon the throne.'\n\n'Then you abjure the Representative principle?'\n\n'Why so? Representation is not necessarily, or even in a principal\nsense, Parliamentary. Parliament is not sitting at this moment, and yet\nthe nation is represented in its highest as well as in its most minute\ninterests. Not a grievance escapes notice and redress. I see in the\nnewspaper this morning that a pedagogue has brutally chastised his\npupil. It is a fact known over all England. We must not forget that a\nprinciple of government is reserved for our days that we shall not find\nin our Aristotles, or even in the forests of Tacitus, nor in our Saxon\nWittenagemotes, nor in our Plantagenet parliaments. Opinion is now\nsupreme, and Opinion speaks in print. The representation of the Press is\nfar more complete than the representation of Parliament. Parliamentary\nrepresentation was the happy device of a ruder age, to which it was\nadmirably adapted: an age of semi-civilisation, when there was a leading\nclass in the community; but it exhibits many symptoms of desuetude.\nIt is controlled by a system of representation more vigorous and\ncomprehensive; which absorbs its duties and fulfils them more\nefficiently, and in which discussion is pursued on fairer terms, and\noften with more depth and information.'\n\n'And to what power would you entrust the function of Taxation?'\n\n'To some power that would employ it more discreetly than in creating\nour present amount of debt, and in establishing our present system of\nimposts.\n\n'In a word, true wisdom lies in the policy that would effect its ends\nby the influence of opinion, and yet by the means of existing forms.\nNevertheless, if we are forced to revolutions, let us propose to our\nconsideration the idea of a free monarchy, established on fundamental\nlaws, itself the apex of a vast pile of municipal and local government,\nruling an educated people, represented by a free and intellectual press.\nBefore such a royal authority, supported by such a national opinion, the\nsectional anomalies of our country would disappear. Under such a system,\nwhere qualification would not be parliamentary, but personal, even\nstatesmen would be educated; we should have no more diplomatists who\ncould not speak French, no more bishops ignorant of theology, no more\ngenerals-in-chief who never saw a field.\n\n'Now there is a polity adapted to our laws, our institutions, our\nfeelings, our manners, our traditions; a polity capable of great ends\nand appealing to high sentiments; a polity which, in my opinion, would\nrender government an object of national affection, which would terminate\nsectional anomalies, assuage religious heats, and extinguish Chartism.'\n\n'You said to me yesterday,' said Millbank after a pause, 'quoting the\nwords of another, which you adopted, that Man was made to adore and to\nobey. Now you have shown to me the means by which you deem it possible\nthat government might become no longer odious to the subject; you have\nshown how man may be induced to obey. But there are duties and interests\nfor man beyond political obedience, and social comfort, and national\ngreatness, higher interests and greater duties. How would you deal\nwith their spiritual necessities? You think you can combat political\ninfidelity in a nation by the principle of enlightened loyalty; how\nwould you encounter religious infidelity in a state? By what means is\nthe principle of profound reverence to be revived? How, in short, is man\nto be led to adore?'\n\n'Ah! that is a subject which I have not forgotten,' replied Coningsby.\n'I know from your letters how deeply it has engaged your thoughts.\nI confess to you that it has often filled mine with perplexity and\ndepression. When we were at Eton, and both of us impregnated with the\ncontrary prejudices in which we had been brought up, there was still\nbetween us one common ground of sympathy and trust; we reposed with\nconfidence and affection in the bosom of our Church. Time and thought,\nwith both of us, have only matured the spontaneous veneration of our\nboyhood. But time and thought have also shown me that the Church of our\nheart is not in a position, as regards the community, consonant with its\noriginal and essential character, or with the welfare of the nation.'\n\n'The character of a Church is universality,' replied Millbank. 'Once\nthe Church in this country was universal in principle and practice; when\nwedded to the State, it continued at least universal in principle, if\nnot in practice. What is it now? All ties between the State and\nthe Church are abolished, except those which tend to its danger and\ndegradation.\n\n'What can be more anomalous than the present connection between State\nand Church? Every condition on which it was originally consented to\nhas been cancelled. That original alliance was, in my view, an equal\ncalamity for the nation and the Church; but, at least, it was an\nintelligible compact. Parliament, then consisting only of members of\nthe Established Church, was, on ecclesiastical matters, a lay synod, and\nmight, in some points of view, be esteemed a necessary portion of Church\ngovernment. But you have effaced this exclusive character of Parliament;\nyou have determined that a communion with the Established Church shall\nno longer be part of the qualification for sitting in the House of\nCommons. There is no reason, so far as the constitution avails, why\nevery member of the House of Commons should not be a dissenter. But the\nwhole power of the country is concentrated in the House of Commons.\nThe House of Lords, even the Monarch himself, has openly announced and\nconfessed, within these ten years, that the will of the House of Commons\nis supreme. A single vote of the House of Commons, in 1832, made the\nDuke of Wellington declare, in the House of Lords, that he was obliged\nto abandon his sovereign in \"the most difficult and distressing\ncircumstances.\" The House of Commons is absolute. It is the State.\n\"L'Etat c'est moi.\" The House of Commons virtually appoints the bishops.\nA sectarian assembly appoints the bishops of the Established Church.\nThey may appoint twenty Hoadleys. James II was expelled the throne\nbecause he appointed a Roman Catholic to an Anglican see. A Parliament\nmight do this to-morrow with impunity. And this is the constitution in\nChurch and State which Conservative dinners toast! The only consequences\nof the present union of Church and State are, that, on the side of the\nState, there is perpetual interference in ecclesiastical government, and\non the side of the Church a sedulous avoidance of all those principles\non which alone Church government can be established, and by the\ninfluence of which alone can the Church of England again become\nuniversal.'\n\n'But it is urged that the State protects its revenues?'\n\n'No ecclesiastical revenues should be safe that require protection.\nModern history is a history of Church spoliation. And by whom? Not by\nthe people; not by the democracy. No; it is the emperor, the king, the\nfeudal baron, the court minion. The estate of the Church is the estate\nof the people, so long as the Church is governed on its real principles.\nThe Church is the medium by which the despised and degraded classes\nassert the native equality of man, and vindicate the rights and power\nof intellect. It made, in the darkest hour of Norman rule, the son of\na Saxon pedlar Primate of England, and placed Nicholas Breakspear, a\nHertfordshire peasant, on the throne of the Caesars. It would do as\ngreat things now, if it were divorced from the degrading and tyrannical\nconnection that enchains it. You would have other sons of peasants\nBishops of England, instead of men appointed to that sacred office\nsolely because they were the needy scions of a factitious aristocracy;\nmen of gross ignorance, profligate habits, and grinding extortion, who\nhave disgraced the episcopal throne, and profaned the altar.'\n\n'But surely you cannot justly extend such a description to the present\nbench?'\n\n'Surely not: I speak of the past, of the past that has produced so much\npresent evil. We live in decent times; frigid, latitudinarian, alarmed,\ndecorous. A priest is scarcely deemed in our days a fit successor to the\nauthors of the gospels, if he be not the editor of a Greek play; and he\nwho follows St. Paul must now at least have been private tutor of\nsome young nobleman who has taken a good degree! And then you are\nall astonished that the Church is not universal! Why! nothing but the\nindestructibleness of its principles, however feebly pursued, could have\nmaintained even the disorganised body that still survives.\n\n'And yet, my dear Coningsby, with all its past errors and all its\npresent deficiencies, it is by the Church; I would have said until I\nlistened to you to-night; by the Church alone that I see any chance of\nregenerating the national character. The parochial system, though\nshaken by the fatal poor-law, is still the most ancient, the most\ncomprehensive, and the most popular institution of the country; the\nyounger priests are, in general, men whose souls are awake to the high\nmission which they have to fulfil, and which their predecessors so\nneglected; there is, I think, a rising feeling in the community, that\nparliamentary intercourse in matters ecclesiastical has not tended\neither to the spiritual or the material elevation of the humbler\norders. Divorce the Church from the State, and the spiritual power that\nstruggled against the brute force of the dark ages, against tyrannical\nmonarchs and barbarous barons, will struggle again in opposition to\ninfluences of a different form, but of a similar tendency; equally\nselfish, equally insensible, equally barbarising. The priests of God are\nthe tribunes of the people. O, ignorant! that with such a mission they\nshould ever have cringed in the antechambers of ministers, or bowed\nbefore parliamentary committees!'\n\n'The Utilitarian system is dead,' said Coningsby. 'It has passed through\nthe heaven of philosophy like a hailstorm, cold, noisy, sharp, and\npeppering, and it has melted away. And yet can we wonder that it found\nsome success, when we consider the political ignorance and social torpor\nwhich it assailed? Anointed kings turned into chief magistrates, and\ntherefore much overpaid; estates of the realm changed into parliaments\nof virtual representation, and therefore requiring real reform; holy\nChurch transformed into national establishment, and therefore grumbled\nat by all the nation for whom it was not supported. What an inevitable\nharvest of sedition, radicalism, infidelity! I really think there is no\nsociety, however great its resources, that could long resist the united\ninfluences of chief magistrate, virtual representation, and Church\nestablishment!'\n\n'I have immense faith in the new generation,' said Millbank, eagerly.\n\n'It is a holy thing to see a state saved by its youth,' said Coningsby;\nand then he added, in a tone of humility, if not of depression,\n'But what a task! What a variety of qualities, what a combination\nof circumstances is requisite! What bright abilities and what noble\npatience! What confidence from the people, what favour from the Most\nHigh!'\n\n'But He will favour us,' said Millbank. 'And I say to you as Nathan said\nunto David, \"Thou art the man!\" You were our leader at Eton; the friends\nof your heart and boyhood still cling and cluster round you! they are\nall men whose position forces them into public life. It is a nucleus of\nhonour, faith, and power. You have only to dare. And will you not dare?\nIt is our privilege to live in an age when the career of the highest\nambition is identified with the performance of the greatest good. Of the\npresent epoch it may be truly said, \"Who dares to be good, dares to be\ngreat.\"'\n\n'Heaven is above all,' said Coningsby. 'The curtain of our fate is\nstill undrawn. We are happy in our friends, dear Millbank, and whatever\nlights, we will stand together. For myself, I prefer fame to life;\nand yet, the consciousness of heroic deeds to the most wide-spread\ncelebrity.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nThe beautiful light of summer had never shone on a scene and surrounding\nlandscape which recalled happier images of English nature, and better\nrecollections of English manners, than that to which we would now\nintroduce our readers. One of those true old English Halls, now\nunhappily so rare, built in the time of the Tudors, and in its elaborate\ntimber-framing and decorative woodwork indicating, perhaps, the scarcity\nof brick and stone at the period of its structure, as much as the\ngrotesque genius of its fabricator, rose on a terrace surrounded\nby ancient and very formal gardens. The hall itself, during many\ngenerations, had been vigilantly and tastefully preserved by its\nproprietors. There was not a point which was not as fresh as if it had\nbeen renovated but yesterday. It stood a huge and strange blending\nof Grecian, Gothic, and Italian architecture, with a wild dash of the\nfantastic in addition. The lantern watch-towers of a baronial castle\nwere placed in juxtaposition with Doric columns employed for chimneys,\nwhile under oriel windows might be observed Italian doorways with\nGrecian pediments. Beyond the extensive gardens an avenue of Spanish\nchestnuts at each point of the compass approached the mansion, or led\ninto a small park which was table-land, its limits opening on all sides\nto beautiful and extensive valleys, sparkling with cultivation, except\nat one point, where the river Darl formed the boundary of the domain,\nand then spread in many a winding through the rich country beyond.\n\nSuch was Hellingsley, the new home that Oswald Millbank was about to\nvisit for the first time. Coningsby and himself had travelled together\nas far as Darlford, where their roads diverged, and they had separated\nwith an engagement on the part of Coningsby to visit Hellingsley on the\nmorrow. As they had travelled along, Coningsby had frequently led the\nconversation to domestic topics; gradually he had talked, and\ntalked much of Edith. Without an obtrusive curiosity, he extracted,\nunconsciously to his companion, traits of her character and early days,\nwhich filled him with a wild and secret interest. The thought that in a\nfew hours he was to meet her again, infused into his being a degree of\ntransport, which the very necessity of repressing before his companion\nrendered more magical and thrilling. How often it happens in life that\nwe have with a grave face to discourse of ordinary topics, while all the\ntime our heart and memory are engrossed with some enchanting secret!\n\nThe castle of his grandfather presented a far different scene on the\narrival of Coningsby from that which it had offered on his first visit.\nThe Marquess had given him a formal permission to repair to it at\nhis pleasure, and had instructed the steward accordingly. But he came\nwithout notice, at a season of the year when the absence of all sports\nmade his arrival unexpected. The scattered and sauntering household\nroused themselves into action, and contemplated the conviction that it\nmight be necessary to do some service for their wages. There was a stir\nin that vast, sleepy castle. At last the steward was found, and came\nforward to welcome their young master, whose simple wants were limited\nto the rooms he had formerly occupied.\n\nConingsby reached the castle a little before sunset, almost the same\nhour that he had arrived there more than three years ago. How much had\nhappened in the interval! Coningsby had already lived long enough to\nfind interest in pondering over the past. That past too must inevitably\nexercise a great influence over his present. He recalled his morning\ndrive with his grandfather, to the brink of that river which was\nthe boundary between his own domain and Hellingsley. Who dwelt at\nHellingsley now?\n\nRestless, excited, not insensible to the difficulties, perhaps the\ndangers of his position, yet full of an entrancing emotion in which all\nthoughts and feelings seemed to merge, Coningsby went forth into the\nfair gardens to muse over his love amid objects as beautiful. A rosy\nlight hung over the rare shrubs and tall fantastic trees; while a rich\nyet darker tint suffused the distant woods. This euthanasia of the day\nexercises a strange influence on the hearts of those who love. Who has\nnot felt it? Magical emotions that touch the immortal part!\n\nBut as for Coningsby, the mitigating hour that softens the heart made\nhis spirit brave. Amid the ennobling sympathies of nature, the pursuits\nand purposes of worldly prudence and conventional advantage subsided\ninto their essential nothingness. He willed to blend his life and fate\nwith a being beautiful as that nature that subdued him, and he felt in\nhis own breast the intrinsic energies that in spite of all obstacles\nshould mould such an imagination into reality.\n\nHe descended the slopes, now growing dimmer in the fleeting light, into\nthe park. The stillness was almost supernatural; the jocund sounds of\nday had died, and the voices of the night had not commenced. His heart\ntoo was still. A sacred calm had succeeded to that distraction of\nemotion which had agitated him the whole day, while he had mused over\nhis love and the infinite and insurmountable barriers that seemed to\noppose his will. Now he felt one of those strong groundless convictions\nthat are the inspirations of passion, that all would yield to him as to\none holding an enchanted wand.\n\nOnward he strolled; it seemed without purpose, yet always proceeding. A\npale and then gleaming tint stole over the masses of mighty timber; and\nsoon a glittering light flooded the lawns and glades. The moon was high\nin her summer heaven, and still Coningsby strolled on. He crossed the\nbroad lawns, he traversed the bright glades: amid the gleaming and\nshadowy woods, he traced his prescient way.\n\nHe came to the bank of a rushing river, foaming in the moonlight, and\nwafting on its blue breast the shadow of a thousand stars.\n\n'O river!' he said, 'that rollest to my mistress, bear her, bear her my\nheart!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nLady Wallinger and Edith were together in the morning room of\nHellingsley, the morrow after the arrival of Oswald. Edith was arranging\nflowers in a vase, while her aunt was embroidering a Spanish peasant in\ncorrect costume. The daughter of Millbank looked as bright and fragrant\nas the fair creations that surrounded her. Beautiful to watch her as she\narranged their forms and composed their groups; to mark her eye glance\nwith gratification at some happy combination of colour, or to listen to\nher delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume. Oswald and\nSir Joseph were surveying the stables; Mr. Millbank, who had been daily\nexpected for the last week from the factories, had not yet arrived.\n\n'I must say he gained my heart from the first,' said Lady Wallinger.\n\n'I wish the gardener would send us more roses,' said Edith.\n\n'He is so very superior to any young man I ever met,' continued Lady\nWallinger.\n\n'I think we must have this vase entirely of roses; don't you think so,\naunt?' inquired her niece.\n\n'I am fond of roses,' said Lady Wallinger. 'What beautiful bouquets Mr.\nConingsby gave us at Paris, Edith!'\n\n'Beautiful!'\n\n'I must say, I was very happy when I met Mr. Coningsby again at\nCambridge,' said Lady Wallinger. 'It gave me much greater pleasure than\nseeing any of the colleges.'\n\n'How delighted Oswald seems at having Mr. Coningsby for a companion\nagain!' said Edith.\n\n'And very naturally,' said Lady Wallinger. 'Oswald ought to deem\nhimself fortunate in having such a friend. I am sure the kindness of Mr.\nConingsby when we met him at Cambridge is what I never shall forget. But\nhe always was my favourite from the first time I saw him at Paris. Do\nyou know, Edith, I liked him best of all your admirers.'\n\n'Oh! no, aunt,' said Edith, smiling, 'not more than Lord Beaumanoir; you\nforget your great favourite, Lord Beaumanoir.'\n\n'But I did not know Mr. Coningsby at Rome,' said Lady Wallinger; 'I\ncannot agree that anybody is equal to Mr. Coningsby. I cannot tell you\nhow pleased I am that he is our neighbour!'\n\nAs Lady Wallinger gave a finishing stroke to the jacket of her\nAndalusian, Edith, vividly blushing, yet speaking in a voice of affected\ncalmness, said,\n\n'Here is Mr. Coningsby, aunt.'\n\nAnd, truly, at this moment our hero might be discerned, approaching the\nhall by one of the avenues; and in a few minutes there was a ringing at\nthe hall bell, and then, after a short pause, the servants announced Mr.\nConingsby, and ushered him into the morning room.\n\nEdith was embarrassed; the frankness and the gaiety of her manner had\ndeserted her; Coningsby was rather earnest than self-possessed. Each\nfelt at first that the presence of Lady Wallinger was a relief. The\nordinary topics of conversation were in sufficient plenty; reminiscences\nof Paris, impressions of Hellingsley, his visit to Oxford, Lady\nWallinger's visit to Cambridge. In ten minutes their voices seemed to\nsound to each other as they did in the Rue de Rivoli, and their mutual\nperplexity had in a great degree subsided.\n\nOswald and Sir Joseph now entered the room, and the conversation became\ngeneral. Hellingsley was the subject on which Coningsby dwelt; he was\ncharmed with all that he had seen! wished to see more. Sir Joseph was\nquite prepared to accompany him; but Lady Wallinger, who seemed to read\nConingsby's wishes in his eyes, proposed that the inspection should be\ngeneral; and in the course of half an hour Coningsby was walking by the\nside of Edith, and sympathising with all the natural charms to which her\nquick taste and lively expression called his notice and appreciation.\nFew things more delightful than a country ramble with a sweet companion!\nExploring woods, wandering over green commons, loitering in shady lanes,\nresting on rural stiles; the air full of perfume, the heart full of\nbliss!\n\nIt seemed to Coningsby that he had never been happy before. A thrilling\njoy pervaded his being. He could have sung like a bird. His heart was as\nsunny as the summer scene. Past and Future were absorbed in the flowing\nhour; not an allusion to Paris, not a speculation on what might arrive;\nbut infinite expressions of agreement, sympathy; a multitude of slight\nphrases, that, however couched, had but one meaning, congeniality. He\nfelt each moment his voice becoming more tender; his heart gushing\nin soft expressions; each moment he was more fascinated; her step was\ngrace, her glance was beauty. Now she touched him by some phrase of\nsweet simplicity; or carried him spell-bound by her airy merriment.\n\nOswald assumed that Coningsby remained to dine with them. There was not\neven the ceremony of invitation. Coningsby could not but remember his\ndinner at Millbank, and the timid hostess whom he then addressed so\noften in vain, as he gazed upon the bewitching and accomplished woman\nwhom he now passionately loved. It was a most agreeable dinner. Oswald,\nhappy in his friend being his guest, under his own roof, indulged in\nunwonted gaiety.\n\nThe ladies withdrew; Sir Joseph began to talk politics, although the\nyoung men had threatened their fair companions immediately to follow\nthem. This was the period of the Bed-Chamber Plot, when Sir Robert Peel\naccepted and resigned power in the course of three days. Sir Joseph,\nwho had originally made up his mind to support a Conservative government\nwhen he deemed it inevitable, had for the last month endeavoured to\ncompensate for this trifling error by vindicating the conduct of his\nfriends, and reprobating the behaviour of those who would deprive her\nMajesty of the 'friends-of-her-youth.' Sir Joseph was a most chivalrous\nchampion of the 'friends-of-her-youth' principle. Sir Joseph, who was\nalways moderate and conciliatory in his talk, though he would go, at any\ntime, any lengths for his party, expressed himself to-day with\nextreme sobriety, as he was determined not to hurt the feelings of\nMr. Coningsby, and he principally confined himself to urging temperate\nquestions, somewhat in the following fashion:--\n\n'I admit that, on the whole, under ordinary circumstances, it would\nperhaps have been more convenient that these appointments should have\nremained with Sir Robert; but don't you think that, under the peculiar\ncircumstances, being friends of her Majesty's youth?' &c. &c.\n\nSir Joseph was extremely astonished when Coningsby replied that he\nthought, under no circumstances, should any appointment in the Royal\nHousehold be dependent on the voice of the House of Commons, though he\nwas far from admiring the 'friends-of-her-youth' principle, which he\nlooked upon as impertinent.\n\n'But surely,' said Sir Joseph, 'the Minister being responsible to\nParliament, it must follow that all great offices of State should be\nfilled at his discretion.'\n\n'But where do you find this principle of Ministerial responsibility?'\ninquired Coningsby.\n\n'And is not a Minister responsible to his Sovereign?' inquired Millbank.\n\nSir Joseph seemed a little confused. He had always heard that Ministers\nwere responsible to Parliament; and he had a vague conviction,\nnotwithstanding the reanimating loyalty of the Bed-Chamber Plot, that\nthe Sovereign of England was a nonentity. He took refuge in indefinite\nexpressions, and observed, 'The Responsibility of Ministers is surely a\nconstitutional doctrine.'\n\n'The Ministers of the Crown are responsible to their master; they are\nnot the Ministers of Parliament.'\n\n'But then you know virtually,' said Sir Joseph, 'the Parliament, that\nis, the House of Commons, governs the country.'\n\n'It did before 1832,' said Coningsby; 'but that is all past now. We got\nrid of that with the Venetian Constitution.'\n\n'The Venetian Constitution!' said Sir Joseph.\n\n'To be sure,' said Millbank. 'We were governed in this country by the\nVenetian Constitution from the accession of the House of Hanover. But\nthat yoke is past. And now I hope we are in a state of transition from\nthe Italian Dogeship to the English Monarchy.'\n\n'King, Lords, and Commons, the Venetian Constitution!' exclaimed Sir\nJoseph.\n\n'But they were phrases,' said Coningsby, 'not facts. The King was a\nDoge; the Cabinet the Council of Ten. Your Parliament, that you call\nLords and Commons, was nothing more than the Great Council of Nobles.'\n\n'The resemblance was complete,' said Millbank, 'and no wonder, for it\nwas not accidental; the Venetian Constitution was intentionally copied.'\n\n'We should have had the Venetian Republic in 1640,' said Coningsby, 'had\nit not been for the Puritans. Geneva beat Venice.'\n\n'I am sure these ideas are not very generally known,' said Sir Joseph,\nbewildered.\n\n'Because you have had your history written by the Venetian party,' said\nConingsby, 'and it has been their interest to conceal them.'\n\n'I will venture to say that there are very few men on our side in the\nHouse of Commons,' said Sir Joseph, 'who are aware that they were born\nunder a Venetian Constitution.'\n\n'Let us go to the ladies,' said Millbank, smiling.\n\nEdith was reading a letter as they entered.\n\n'A letter from papa,' she exclaimed, looking up at her brother with\ngreat animation. 'We may expect him every day; and yet, alas! he cannot\nfix one.'\n\nThey now all spoke of Millbank, and Coningsby was happy that he was\nfamiliar with the scene. At length he ventured to say to Edith, 'You\nonce made me a promise which you never fulfilled. I shall claim it\nto-night.'\n\n'And what can that be?'\n\n'The song that you promised me at Millbank more than three years ago.'\n\n'Your memory is good.'\n\n'It has dwelt upon the subject.'\n\nThen they spoke for a while of other recollections, and then Coningsby\nappealing to Lady Wallinger for her influence, Edith rose and took up\nher guitar. Her voice was rich and sweet; the air she sang gay, even\nfantastically frolic, such as the girls of Granada chaunt trooping home\nfrom some country festival; her soft, dark eye brightened with joyous\nsympathy; and ever and anon, with an arch grace, she beat the guitar, in\nchorus, with her pretty hand.\n\nThe moon wanes; and Coningsby must leave these enchanted halls. Oswald\nwalked homeward with him until he reached the domain of his grandfather.\nThen mounting his horse, Coningsby bade his friend farewell till the\nmorrow, and made his best way to the Castle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThere is a romance in every life. The emblazoned page of Coningsby's\nexistence was now open. It had been prosperous before, with some moments\nof excitement, some of delight; but they had all found, as it were,\ntheir origin in worldly considerations, or been inevitably mixed up with\nthem. At Paris, for example, he loved, or thought he loved. But there\nnot an hour could elapse without his meeting some person, or hearing\nsomething, which disturbed the beauty of his emotions, or broke his\nspell-bound thoughts. There was his grandfather hating the Millbanks,\nor Sidonia loving them; and common people, in the common world, making\ncommon observations on them; asking who they were, or telling who they\nwere; and brushing the bloom off all life's fresh delicious fancies with\ntheir coarse handling.\n\nBut now his feelings were ethereal. He loved passionately, and he loved\nin a scene and in a society as sweet, as pure, and as refined as his\nimagination and his heart. There was no malicious gossip, no callous\nchatter to profane his ear and desecrate his sentiment. All that he\nheard or saw was worthy of the summer sky, the still green woods, the\ngushing river, the gardens and terraces, the stately and fantastic\ndwellings, among which his life now glided as in some dainty and\ngorgeous masque.\n\nAll the soft, social, domestic sympathies of his nature, which, however\nabundant, had never been cultivated, were developed by the life he was\nnow leading. It was not merely that he lived in the constant presence,\nand under the constant influence of one whom he adored, that made him so\nhappy. He was surrounded by beings who found felicity in the interchange\nof kind feelings and kind words, in the cultivation of happy talents and\nrefined tastes, and the enjoyment of a life which their own good sense\nand their own good hearts made them both comprehend and appreciate.\nAmbition lost much of its splendour, even his lofty aspirations\nsomething of their hallowing impulse of paramount duty, when Coningsby\nfelt how much ennobling delight was consistent with the seclusion of a\nprivate station; and mused over an existence to be passed amid woods and\nwaterfalls with a fair hand locked in his, or surrounded by his friends\nin some ancestral hall.\n\nThe morning after his first visit to Hellingsley Coningsby rejoined his\nfriends, as he had promised Oswald at their breakfast-table; and day\nafter day he came with the early sun, and left them only when the late\nmoon silvered the keep of Coningsby Castle. Mr. Millbank, who wrote\ndaily, and was daily to be expected, did not arrive. A week, a week\nof unbroken bliss, had vanished away, passed in long rides and longer\nwalks, sunset saunterings, and sometimes moonlit strolls; talking of\nflowers, and thinking of things even sweeter; listening to delicious\nsongs, and sometimes reading aloud some bright romance or some inspiring\nlay.\n\nOne day Coningsby, who arrived at the hall unexpectedly late; indeed it\nwas some hours past noon, for he had been detained by despatches\nwhich arrived at the Castle from Mr. Rigby, and which required his\ninterposition; found the ladies alone, and was told that Sir Joseph and\nOswald were at the fishing-cottage where they wished him to join them.\nHe was in no haste to do this; and Lady Wallinger proposed that\nwhen they felt inclined to ramble they should all walk down to the\nfishing-cottage together. So, seating himself by the side of Edith, who\nwas tinting a sketch which she had made of a rich oriel of Hellingsley,\nthe morning passed away in that slight and yet subtle talk in which a\nlover delights, and in which, while asking a thousand questions, that\nseem at the first glance sufficiently trifling, he is indeed often\nconveying a meaning that is not expressed, or attempting to discover a\nfeeling that is hidden. And these are occasions when glances meet\nand glances are withdrawn: the tongue may speak idly, the eye is more\neloquent, and often more true.\n\nConingsby looked up; Lady Wallinger, who had more than once announced\nthat she was going to put on her bonnet, was gone. Yet still he\ncontinued to talk trifles; and still Edith listened.\n\n'Of all that you have told me,' said Edith, 'nothing pleases me so much\nas your description of St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve. How much I should like to catch\nthe deer at sunset on the heights! What a pretty drawing it would make!'\n\n'You would like Eustace Lyle,' said Coningsby. 'He is so shy and yet so\nardent.'\n\n'You have such a band of friends! Oswald was saying this morning there\nwas no one who had so many devoted friends.'\n\n'We are all united by sympathy. It is the only bond of friendship; and\nyet friendship--'\n\n'Edith,' said Lady Wallinger, looking into the room from the garden,\nwith her bonnet on, 'you will find me roaming on the terrace.'\n\n'We come, dear aunt.'\n\nAnd yet they did not move. There were yet a few pencil touches to be\ngiven to the tinted sketch; Coningsby would cut the pencils.\n\n'Would you give me,' he said, 'some slight memorial of Hellingsley and\nyour art? I would not venture to hope for anything half so beautiful as\nthis; but the slightest sketch. It would make me so happy when away to\nhave it hanging in my room.'\n\nA blush suffused the cheek of Edith; she turned her head a little aside,\nas if she were arranging some drawings. And then she said, in a somewhat\nhushed and hesitating voice,\n\n'I am sure I will do so; and with pleasure. A view of the Hall itself;\nI think that would be the best memorial. Where shall we take it from?\nWe will decide in our walk?' and she rose, and promised immediately to\nreturn, left the room.\n\nConingsby leant over the mantel-piece in deep abstraction, gazing\nvacantly on a miniature of the father of Edith. A light step roused\nhim; she had returned. Unconsciously he greeted her with a glance of\nineffable tenderness.\n\nThey went forth; it was a grey, sultry day. Indeed it was the covered\nsky which had led to the fishing scheme of the morning. Sir Joseph was\nan expert and accomplished angler, and the Darl was renowned for its\nsport. They lingered before they reached the terrace where they were to\nfind Lady Wallinger, observing the different points of view which\nthe Hall presented, and debating which was to form the subject of\nConingsby's drawing; for already it was to be not merely a sketch, but a\ndrawing, the most finished that the bright and effective pencil of Edith\ncould achieve. If it really were to be placed in his room, and were\nto be a memorial of Hellingsley, her artistic reputation demanded a\nmasterpiece.\n\nThey reached the terrace: Lady Wallinger was not there, nor could they\nobserve her in the vicinity. Coningsby was quite certain that she had\ngone onward to the fishing-cottage, and expected them to follow her;\nand he convinced Edith of the justness of his opinion. To the\nfishing-cottage, therefore, they bent their steps. They emerged from the\ngardens into the park, sauntering over the table-land, and seeking as\nmuch as possible the shade, in the soft but oppressive atmosphere. At\nthe limit of the table-land their course lay by a wild but winding path\nthrough a gradual and wooded declivity. While they were yet in this\ncraggy and romantic woodland, the big fervent drops began to fall.\nConingsby urged Edith to seek at once a natural shelter; but she, who\nknew the country, assured him that the fishing-cottage was close by, and\nthat they might reach it before the rain could do them any harm.\n\nAnd truly, at this moment emerging from the wood, they found themselves\nin the valley of the Darl. The river here was narrow and winding, but\nfull of life; rushing, and clear but for the dark sky it reflected; with\nhigh banks of turf and tall trees; the silver birch, above all others,\nin clustering groups; infinitely picturesque. At the turn of the river,\nabout two hundred yards distant, Coningsby observed the low, dark roof\nof the fishing-cottage on its banks. They descended from the woods to\nthe margin of the stream by a flight of turfen steps, Coningsby holding\nEdith's hand as he guided her progress.\n\nThe drops became thicker. They reached, at a rapid pace, the cottage.\nThe absent boat indicated that Sir Joseph and Oswald were on the river.\nThe cottage was an old building of rustic logs, with a shelving roof,\nso that you might obtain sufficient shelter without entering its walls.\nConingsby found a rough garden seat for Edith. The shower was now\nviolent.\n\nNature, like man, sometimes weeps from gladness. It is the joy and\ntenderness of her heart that seek relief; and these are summer showers.\nIn this instance the vehemence of her emotion was transient, though the\ntears kept stealing down her cheek for a long time, and gentle sighs and\nsobs might for some period be distinguished. The oppressive atmosphere\nhad evaporated; the grey, sullen tint had disappeared; a soft breeze\ncame dancing up the stream; a glowing light fell upon the woods and\nwaters; the perfume of trees and flowers and herbs floated around. There\nwas a carolling of birds; a hum of happy insects in the air; freshness\nand stir, and a sense of joyous life, pervaded all things; it seemed\nthat the heart of all creation opened.\n\nConingsby, after repeatedly watching the shower with Edith, and\nspeculating on its progress, which did not much annoy them, had seated\nhimself on a log almost at her feet. And assuredly a maiden and a youth\nmore beautiful and engaging had seldom met before in a scene more fresh\nand fair. Edith on her rustic seat watched the now blue and foaming\nriver, and the birch-trees with a livelier tint, and quivering in the\nsunset air; an expression of tranquil bliss suffused her beautiful brow,\nand spoke from the thrilling tenderness of her soft dark eye. Coningsby\ngazed on that countenance with a glance of entranced rapture. His cheek\nwas flushed, his eye gleamed with dazzling lustre. She turned her head;\nshe met that glance, and, troubled, she withdrew her own.\n\n'Edith!' he said in a tone of tremulous passion, 'Let me call you Edith!\nYes,' he continued, gently taking her hand, let me call you my Edith! I\nlove you!'\n\nShe did not withdraw her hand; but turned away a face flushed as the\nimpending twilight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nIt was past the dinner hour when Edith and Coningsby reached the Hall;\nan embarrassing circumstance, but mitigated by the conviction that they\nhad not to encounter a very critical inspection. What, then, were their\nfeelings when the first servant that they met informed them that Mr.\nMillbank had arrived! Edith never could have believed that the return of\nher beloved father to his home could ever have been to her other than\na cause of delight. And yet now she trembled when she heard the\nannouncement. The mysteries of love were fast involving her existence.\nBut this was not the season of meditation. Her heart was still agitated\nby the tremulous admission that she responded to that fervent and\nadoring love whose eloquent music still sounded in her ear, and the\npictures of whose fanciful devotion flitted over her agitated vision.\nUnconsciously she pressed the arm of Coningsby as the servant spoke,\nand then, without looking into his face, whispering him to be quick, she\nsprang away.\n\nAs for Coningsby, notwithstanding the elation of his heart, and the\nethereal joy which flowed in all his veins, the name of Mr. Millbank\nsounded, something like a knell. However, this was not the time to\nreflect. He obeyed the hint of Edith; made the most rapid toilet that\never was consummated by a happy lover, and in a few minutes entered the\ndrawing-room of Hellingsley, to encounter the gentleman whom he hoped by\nsome means or other, quite inconceivable, might some day be transformed\ninto his father-in-law, and the fulfilment of his consequent duties\ntowards whom he had commenced by keeping him waiting for dinner.\n\n'How do you do, sir,' said Mr. Millbank, extending his hand to\nConingsby. 'You seem to have taken a long walk.'\n\nConingsby looked round to the kind Lady Wallinger, and half addressed\nhis murmured answer to her, explaining how they had lost her, and their\nway, and were caught in a storm or a shower, which, as it terminated\nabout three hours back, and the fishing-cottage was little more than a\nmile from the Hall, very satisfactorily accounted for their not being in\ntime for dinner.\n\nLady Wallinger then said something about the lowering clouds having\nfrightened her from the terrace, and Sir Joseph and Oswald talked a\nlittle of their sport, and of their having seen an otter; but there was,\nor at least there seemed to Coningsby, a tone of general embarrassment\nwhich distressed him. The fact is, keeping people from dinner under\nany circumstances is distressing. They are obliged to talk at the very\nmoment when they wish to use their powers of expression for a very\ndifferent purpose. They are faint, and conversation makes them more\nexhausted. A gentleman, too, fond of his family, who in turn are devoted\nto him, making a great and inconvenient effort to reach them by dinner\ntime, to please and surprise them; and finding them all dispersed,\ndinner so late that he might have reached home in good time without any\ngreat inconvenient effort; his daughter, whom he had wished a thousand\ntimes to embrace, taking a singularly long ramble with no other\ncompanion than a young gentleman, whom he did not exactly expect to\nsee; all these are circumstances, individually perhaps slight, and yet,\nencountered collectively, it may be doubted they would not a little\nruffle even the sweetest temper.\n\nMr. Millbank, too, had not the sweetest temper, though not a bad one;\na little quick and fiery. But then he had a kind heart. And when Edith,\nwho had providentially sent down a message to order dinner, entered and\nembraced him at the very moment that dinner was announced, her father\nforgot everything in his joy in seeing her, and his pleasure in being\nsurrounded by his friends. He gave his hand to Lady Wallinger, and Sir\nJoseph led away his niece. Coningsby put his arm around the astonished\nneck of Oswald, as if they were once more in the playing fields of Eton.\n\n'By Jove! my dear fellow,' he exclaimed, 'I am so sorry we kept your\nfather from dinner.'\n\nAs Edith headed her father's table, according to his rigid rule,\nConingsby was on one side of her. They never spoke so little; Coningsby\nwould have never unclosed his lips, had he followed his humour. He was\nin a stupor of happiness; the dining room took the appearance of\nthe fishing-cottage; and he saw nothing but the flowing river. Lady\nWallinger was however next to him, and that was a relief; for he felt\nalways she was his friend. Sir Joseph, a good-hearted man, and\non subjects with which he was acquainted full of sound sense, was\ninvaluable to-day, for he entirely kept up the conversation, speaking\nof things which greatly interested Mr. Millbank. And so their host soon\nrecovered his good temper; he addressed several times his observations\nto Coningsby, and was careful to take wine with him. On the whole,\naffairs went on flowingly enough. The gentlemen, indeed, stayed much\nlonger over their wine than on the preceding days, and Coningsby did not\nventure on the liberty of quitting the room before his host. It was as\nwell. Edith required repose. She tried to seek it on the bosom of her\naunt, as she breathed to her the delicious secret of her life. When the\ngentlemen returned to the drawing-room the ladies were not there.\n\nThis rather disturbed Mr. Millbank again; he had not seen enough of his\ndaughter; he wished to hear her sing. But Edith managed to reappear; and\neven to sing. Then Coningsby went up to her and asked her to sing the\nsong of the Girls of Granada. She said in a low voice, and with a fond\nyet serious look,\n\n'I am not in the mood for such a song, but if you wish me--'\n\nShe sang it, and with inexpressible grace, and with an arch vivacity,\nthat to a fine observer would have singularly contrasted with the\nalmost solemn and even troubled expression of her countenance a moment\nafterwards.\n\nThe day was about to die; the day the most important, the most precious\nin the lives of Harry Coningsby and Edith Millbank. Words had been\nspoken, vows breathed, which were to influence their careers for ever.\nFor them hereafter there was to be but one life, one destiny, one world.\nEach of them was still in such a state of tremulous excitement, that\nneither had found time or occasion to ponder over the mighty result.\nThey both required solitude; they both longed to be alone. Coningsby\nrose to depart. He pressed the soft hand of Edith, and his glance spoke\nhis soul.\n\n'We shall see you at breakfast to-morrow, Coningsby!' said Oswald,\nvery loud, knowing that the presence of his father would make Coningsby\nhesitate about coming. Edith's heart fluttered; but she said nothing. It\nwas with delight she heard her father, after a moment's pause, say,\n\n'Oh! I beg we may have that pleasure.'\n\n'Not quite at so early an hour,' said Coningsby; 'but if you will permit\nme, I hope to have the pleasure of hearing from you to-morrow, sir, that\nyour journey has not fatigued you.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nTo be alone; to have no need of feigning a tranquillity he could not\nfeel; of coining common-place courtesy when his heart was gushing\nwith rapture; this was a great relief to Coningsby, though gained by a\nseparation from Edith.\n\nThe deed was done; he had breathed his long-brooding passion, he\nhad received the sweet expression of her sympathy, he had gained\nthe long-coveted heart. Youth, beauty, love, the innocence of\nunsophisticated breasts, and the inspiration of an exquisite nature,\ncombined to fashion the spell that now entranced his life. He turned to\ngaze upon the moonlit towers and peaked roofs of Hellingsley. Silent and\ndreamlike, the picturesque pile rested on its broad terrace flooded with\nthe silver light and surrounded by the quaint bowers of its fantastic\ngardens tipped with the glittering beam. Half hid in deep shadow, half\nsparkling in the midnight blaze, he recognised the oriel window that had\nbeen the subject of the morning's sketch. Almost he wished there should\nbe some sound to assure him of his reality. But nothing broke the\nall-pervading stillness. Was his life to be as bright and as tranquil?\nAnd what was to be his life?\n\nWhither was he to bear the beautiful bride he had gained? Were the\nportals of Coningsby the proud and hospitable gates that were to greet\nher? How long would they greet him after the achievement of the last\nfour-and-twenty hours was known to their lord? Was this the return for\nthe confiding kindness of his grandsire? That he should pledge his troth\nto the daughter of that grandsire's foe?\n\nAway with such dark and scaring visions! Is it not the noon of a summer\nnight fragrant with the breath of gardens, bright with the beam that\nlovers love, and soft with the breath of Ausonian breezes? Within that\nsweet and stately residence, dwells there not a maiden fair enough to\nrevive chivalry; who is even now thinking of him as she leans on her\npensive hand, or, if perchance she dream, recalls him in her visions?\nAnd himself, is he one who would cry craven with such a lot? What avail\nhis golden youth, his high blood, his daring and devising spirit, and\nall his stores of wisdom, if they help not now? Does not he feel the\nenergy divine that can confront Fate and carve out fortunes? Besides it\nis nigh Midsummer Eve, and what should fairies reign for but to aid such\na bright pair as this?\n\nHe recalls a thousand times the scene, the moment, in which but a few\nhours past he dared to tell her that he loved; he recalls a thousand\ntimes the still, small voice, that murmured her agitated felicity: more\nthan a thousand times, for his heart clenched the idea as a diver grasps\na gem, he recalls the enraptured yet gentle embrace, that had sealed\nupon her blushing cheek his mystical and delicious sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe morning broke lowering and thunderous; small white clouds, dull and\nimmovable, studded the leaden sky; the waters of the rushing Darl seemed\nto have become black and almost stagnant; the terraces of Hellingsley\nlooked like the hard lines of a model; and the mansion itself had a\nharsh and metallic character. Before the chief portal of his Hall, the\nelder Millbank, with an air of some anxiety, surveyed the landscape and\nthe heavens, as if he were speculating on the destiny of the day.\n\nOften his eye wandered over the park; often with an uneasy and restless\nstep he paced the raised walk before him. The clock of Hellingsley\nchurch had given the chimes of noon. His son and Coningsby appeared\nat the end of one of the avenues. His eye lightened; his lip became\ncompressed; he advanced to meet them.\n\n'Are you going to fish to-day, Oswald?' he inquired of his son.\n\n'We had some thoughts of it, sir.'\n\n'A fine day for sport, I should think,' he observed, as he turned\ntowards the Hall with them.\n\nConingsby remarked the fanciful beauty of the portal; its twisted\ncolumns, and Caryatides carved in dark oak.\n\n'Yes, it's very well,' said Millbank; 'but I really do not know why I\ncame here; my presence is an effort. Oswald does not care for the place;\nnone of us do, I believe.'\n\n'Oh! I like it now, father; and Edith doats on it.'\n\n'She was very happy at Millbank,' said the father, rather sharply.\n\n'We are all of us happy at Millbank,' said Oswald.\n\n'I was much struck with the valley and the whole settlement when I first\nsaw it,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Suppose you go and see about the tackle, Oswald,' said Mr. Millbank,\n'and Mr. Coningsby and I will take a stroll on the terrace in the\nmeantime.'\n\nThe habit of obedience, which was supreme in this family, instantly\ncarried Oswald away, though he was rather puzzled why his father should\nbe so anxious about the preparation of the fishing-tackle, as he rarely\nused it. His son had no sooner departed than Mr. Millbank turned to\nConingsby, and said very abruptly,\n\n'You have never seen my own room here, Mr. Coningsby; step in, for I\nwish to say a word to you.' And thus speaking, he advanced before the\nastonished, and rather agitated Coningsby, and led the way through a\ndoor and long passage to a room of moderate dimensions, partly furnished\nas a library, and full of parliamentary papers and blue-books. Shutting\nthe door with some earnestness and pointing to a chair, he begged his\nguest to be seated. Both in their chairs, Mr. Millbank, clearing his\nthroat, said without preface, 'I have reason to believe, Mr. Coningsby,\nthat you are attached to my daughter?'\n\n'I have been attached to her for a long time most ardently,' replied\nConingsby, in a calm and rather measured tone, but looking very pale.\n\n'And I have reason to believe that she returns your attachment?' said\nMr. Millbank.\n\n'I believe she deigns not to disregard it,' said Coningsby, his white\ncheek becoming scarlet.\n\n'It is then a mutual attachment, which, if cherished, must produce\nmutual unhappiness,' said Mr. Millbank.\n\n'I would fain believe the reverse,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Why?' inquired Mr. Millbank.\n\n'Because I believe she possesses every charm, quality, and virtue, that\ncan bless man; and because, though I can make her no equivalent return,\nI have a heart, if I know myself, that would struggle to deserve her.'\n\n'I know you to be a man of sense; I believe you to be a man of honour,'\nreplied Mr. Millbank. 'As the first, you must feel that an union between\nyou and my daughter is impossible; what then should be your duty as a\nman of correct principle is obvious.'\n\n'I could conceive that our union might be attended with difficulties,'\nsaid Coningsby, in a somewhat deprecating tone.\n\n'Sir, it is impossible,' repeated Mr. Millbank, interrupting him, though\nnot with harshness; 'that is to say, there is no conceivable marriage\nwhich could be effected at greater sacrifices, and which would occasion\ngreater misery.'\n\n'The sacrifices are more apparent to me than the misery,' said\nConingsby, 'and even they may be imaginary.'\n\n'The sacrifices and the misery are certain and inseparable,' said Mr.\nMillbank. 'Come now, see how we stand! I speak without reserve, for this\nis a subject which cannot permit misconception, but with no feelings\ntowards you, sir, but fair and friendly ones. You are the grandson of\nmy Lord Monmouth; at present enjoying his favour, but dependent on his\nbounty. You may be the heir of his wealth to-morrow, and to-morrow you\nmay be the object of his hatred and persecution. Your grandfather and\nmyself are foes; bitter, irreclaimable, to the death. It is idle to\nmince phrases; I do not vindicate our mutual feelings, I may regret that\nthey have ever arisen; I may regret it especially at this exigency. They\nare not the feelings of good Christians; they may be altogether to be\ndeplored and unjustifiable; but they exist, mutually exist; and have not\nbeen confined to words. Lord Monmouth would crush me, had he the power,\nlike a worm; and I have curbed his proud fortunes often. Were it not\nfor this feeling I should not be here; I purchased this estate merely\nto annoy him, as I have done a thousand other acts merely for his\ndiscomfiture and mortification. In our long encounter I have done him\ninfinitely more injury than he could do me; I have been on the spot,\nI am active, vigilant, the maker of my fortunes. He is an epicurean,\ncontinually in foreign parts, obliged to leave the fulfilment of his\nwill to others. But, for these very reasons, his hate is more intense.\nI can afford to hate him less than he hates me; I have injured him more.\nHere are feelings to exist between human beings! But they do exist;\nand now you are to go to this man, and ask his sanction to marry my\ndaughter!'\n\n'But I would appease these hatreds; I would allay these dark passions,\nthe origin of which I know not, but which never could justify the end,\nand which lead to so much misery. I would appeal to my grandfather; I\nwould show him Edith.'\n\n'He has looked upon as fair even as Edith,' said Mr. Millbank, rising\nsuddenly from his seat, and pacing the room, 'and did that melt his\nheart? The experience of your own lot should have guarded you from the\nperils that you have so rashly meditated encountering, and the misery\nwhich you have been preparing for others besides yourself. Is my\ndaughter to be treated like your mother? And by the same hand? Your\nmother's family were not Lord Monmouth's foes. They were simple and\ninnocent people, free from all the bad passions of our nature, and\nignorant of the world's ways. But because they were not noble, because\nthey could trace no mystified descent from a foreign invader, or the\nsacrilegious minion of some spoliating despot, their daughter was hunted\nfrom the family which should have exulted to receive her, and the land\nof which she was the native ornament. Why should a happier lot await you\nthan fell to your parents? You are in the same position as your father;\nyou meditate the same act. The only difference being aggravating\ncircumstances in your case, which, even if I were a member of the same\norder as my Lord Monmouth, would prevent the possibility of a prosperous\nunion. Marry Edith, and you blast all the prospects of your life, and\nentail on her a sense of unceasing humiliation. Would you do this?\nShould I permit you to do this?'\n\nConingsby, with his head resting on his arm, his face a little shaded,\nhis eyes fixed on the ground, listened in silence. There was a pause;\nbroken by Coningsby, as in a low voice, without changing his posture or\nraising his glance, he said, 'It seems, sir, that you were acquainted\nwith my mother!'\n\n'I knew sufficient of her,' replied Mr. Millbank, with a kindling cheek,\n'to learn the misery that a woman may entail on herself by marrying out\nof her condition. I have bred my children in a respect for their class.\nI believe they have imbibed my feeling; though it is strange how in\nthe commerce of the world, chance, in their friendships, has apparently\nbaffled my designs.'\n\n'Oh! do not say it is chance, sir,' said Coningsby, looking up, and\nspeaking with much fervour. 'The feelings that animate me towards\nyour family are not the feelings of chance: they are the creation of\nsympathy; tried by time, tested by thought. And must they perish? Can\nthey perish? They were inevitable; they are indestructible. Yes, sir, it\nis in vain to speak of the enmities that are fostered between you and\nmy grandfather; the love that exists between your daughter and myself is\nstronger than all your hatreds.'\n\n'You speak like a young man, and a young man that is in love,' said Mr.\nMillbank. 'This is mere rhapsody; it will vanish in an instant\nbefore the reality of life. And you have arrived at that reality,' he\ncontinued, speaking with emphasis, leaning over the back of his chair,\nand looking steadily at Coningsby with his grey, sagacious eye; 'my\ndaughter and yourself can meet no more.'\n\n'It is impossible you can be so cruel!' exclaimed Coningsby.\n\n'So kind; kind to you both; for I wish to be kind to you as well as to\nher. You are entitled to kindness from us all; though I will tell you\nnow, that, years ago, when the news arrived that my son's life had been\nsaved, and had been saved by one who bore the name of Coningsby, I had\na presentiment, great as was the blessing, that it might lead to\nunhappiness.'\n\n'I can answer for the misery of one,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great\ndespondency. 'I feel as if my sun were set. Oh! why should there be such\nwretchedness? Why are there family hatreds and party feuds? Why am I the\nmost wretched of men?'\n\n'My good young friend, you will live, I doubt not, to be a happy one.\nHappiness is not, as we are apt to fancy, entirely dependent on these\ncontingencies. It is the lot of most men to endure what you are now\nsuffering, and they can look back to such conjunctures through the vista\nof years with calmness.'\n\n'I may see Edith now?'\n\n'Frankly, I should say, no. My daughter is in her room; I have had some\nconversation with her. Of course she suffers not less than yourself. To\nsee her again will only aggravate woe. You leave under this roof, sir,\nsome sad memories, but no unkind ones. It is not likely that I can\nserve you, or that you may want my aid; but whatever may be in my power,\nremember you may command it; without reserve and without restraint. If I\ncontrol myself now, it is not because I do not respect your affliction,\nbut because, in the course of my life, I have felt too much not to be\nable to command my feelings.'\n\n'You never could have felt what I feel now,' said Coningsby, in a tone\nof anguish.\n\n'You touch on delicate ground,' said Millbank; 'yet from me you may\nlearn to suffer. There was a being once, not less fair than the peerless\ngirl that you would fain call your own, and her heart was my proud\npossession. There were no family feuds to baffle our union, nor was\nI dependent on anything, but the energies which had already made me\nflourishing. What happiness was mine! It was the first dream of my life,\nand it was the last; my solitary passion, the memory of which softens my\nheart. Ah! you dreaming scholars, and fine gentlemen who saunter through\nlife, you think there is no romance in the loves of a man who lives in\nthe toil and turmoil of business. You are in deep error. Amid my career\nof travail, there was ever a bright form which animated exertion,\ninspired my invention, nerved my energy, and to gain whose heart and\nlife I first made many of those discoveries, and entered into many\nof those speculations, that have since been the foundation of my wide\nprosperity.\n\n'Her faith was pledged to me; I lived upon her image; the day was even\ntalked of when I should bear her to the home that I had proudly prepared\nfor her.\n\n'There came a young noble, a warrior who had never seen war, glittering\nwith gewgaws. He was quartered in the town where the mistress of my\nheart, who was soon to share my life and my fortunes, resided. The tale\nis too bitter not to be brief. He saw her, he sighed; I will hope that\nhe loved her; she gave him with rapture the heart which perhaps she\nfound she had never given to me; and instead of bearing the name I had\nonce hoped to have called her by, she pledged her faith at the altar to\none who, like you, was called, CONINGSBY.'\n\n'My mother!'\n\n'You see, I too have had my griefs.'\n\n'Dear sir,' said Coningsby, rising and taking Mr. Millbank's hand, 'I am\nmost wretched; and yet I wish to part from you even with affection. You\nhave explained circumstances that have long perplexed me. A curse, I\nfear, is on our families. I have not mind enough at this moment even\nto ponder on my situation. My head is a chaos. I go; yes, I quit this\nHellingsley, where I came to be so happy, where I have been so happy.\nNay, let me go, dear sir! I must be alone, I must try to think. And tell\nher, no, tell her nothing. God will guard over us!'\n\nProceeding down the avenue with a rapid and distempered step, his\ncountenance lost, as it were, in a wild abstraction, Coningsby\nencountered Oswald Millbank. He stopped, collected his turbulent\nthoughts, and throwing on Oswald one look that seemed at the same time\nto communicate woe and to demand sympathy, flung himself into his arms.\n\n'My friend!' he exclaimed, and then added, in a broken voice, 'I need a\nfriend.'\n\nThen in a hurried, impassioned, and somewhat incoherent strain, leaning\non Oswald's arm, as they walked on together, he poured forth all that\nhad occurred, all of which he had dreamed; his baffled bliss, his\nactual despair. Alas! there was little room for solace, and yet all\nthat earnest affection could inspire, and a sagacious brain and a brave\nspirit, were offered for his support, if not his consolation, by the\nfriend who was devoted to him.\n\nIn the midst of this deep communion, teeming with every thought and\nsentiment that could enchain and absorb the spirit of man, they came to\none of the park-gates of Coningsby. Millbank stopped. The command of\nhis father was peremptory, that no member of his family, under any\ncircumstances, or for any consideration, should set his foot on that\ndomain. Lady Wallinger had once wished to have seen the Castle, and\nConingsby was only too happy in the prospect of escorting her and Edith\nover the place; but Oswald had then at once put his veto on the project,\nas a thing forbidden; and which, if put in practice, his father would\nnever pardon. So it passed off, and now Oswald himself was at the gates\nof that very domain with his friend who was about to enter them, his\nfriend whom he might never see again; that Coningsby who, from their\nboyish days, had been the idol of his life; whom he had lived to see\nappeal to his affections and his sympathy, and whom Oswald was now going\nto desert in the midst of his lonely and unsolaced woe.\n\n'I ought not to enter here,' said Oswald, holding the hand of Coningsby\nas he hesitated to advance; 'and yet there are duties more sacred even\nthan obedience to a father. I cannot leave you thus, friend of my best\nheart!'\n\nThe morning passed away in unceasing yet fruitless speculation on the\nfuture. One moment something was to happen, the next nothing could\noccur. Sometimes a beam of hope flashed over the fancy of Coningsby,\nand jumping up from the turf, on which they were reclining, he seemed\nto exult in his renovated energies; and then this sanguine paroxysm was\nsucceeded by a fit of depression so dark and dejected that nothing but\nthe presence of Oswald seemed to prevent Coningsby from flinging himself\ninto the waters of the Darl.\n\nThe day was fast declining, and the inevitable moment of separation was\nat hand. Oswald wished to appear at the dinner-table of Hellingsley,\nthat no suspicion might arise in the mind of his father of his having\naccompanied Coningsby home. But just as he was beginning to mention the\nnecessity of his departure, a flash of lightning seemed to transfix the\nheavens. The sky was very dark; though studded here and there with dingy\nspots. The young men sprang up at the same time.\n\n'We had better get out of these trees,' said Oswald.\n\n'We had better get to the Castle,' said Coningsby.\n\nA clap of thunder that seemed to make the park quake broke over their\nheads, followed by some thick drops. The Castle was close at hand;\nOswald had avoided entering it; but the impending storm was so menacing\nthat, hurried on by Coningsby, he could make no resistance; and, in a\nfew minutes, the companions were watching the tempest from the windows\nof a room in Coningsby Castle.\n\nThe fork-lightning flashed and scintillated from every quarter of the\nhorizon: the thunder broke over the Castle, as if the keep were rocking\nwith artillery: amid the momentary pauses of the explosion, the rain was\nheard descending like dissolving water-spouts.\n\nNor was this one of those transient tempests that often agitate\nthe summer. Time advanced, and its fierceness was little mitigated.\nSometimes there was a lull, though the violence of the rain never\nappeared to diminish; but then, as in some pitched fight between\ncontending hosts, when the fervour of the field seems for a moment to\nallay, fresh squadrons arrive and renew the hottest strife, so a low\nmoaning wind that was now at intervals faintly heard bore up a great\nreserve of electric vapour, that formed, as it were, into field in\nthe space between the Castle and Hellingsley, and then discharged its\nviolence on that fated district.\n\nConingsby and Oswald exchanged looks. 'You must not think of going home\nat present, my dear fellow,' said the first. 'I am sure your father\nwould not be displeased. There is not a being here who even knows you,\nand if they did, what then?'\n\nThe servant entered the room, and inquired whether the gentlemen were\nready for dinner.\n\n'By all means; come, my dear Millbank, I feel reckless as the tempest;\nlet us drown our cares in wine!'\n\nConingsby, in fact, was exhausted by all the agitation of the day, and\nall the harassing spectres of the future. He found wine a momentary\nsolace. He ordered the servants away, and for a moment felt a degree of\nwild satisfaction in the company of the brother of Edith.\n\nThus they sat for a long time, talking only of one subject, and\nrepeating almost the same things, yet both felt happier in being\ntogether. Oswald had risen, and opening the window, examined the\napproaching night. The storm had lulled, though the rain still fell; in\nthe west was a streak of light. In a quarter of an hour, he calculated\non departing. As he was watching the wind he thought he heard the sound\nof wheels, which reminded him of Coningsby's promise to lend him a light\ncarriage for his return.\n\nThey sat down once more; they had filled their glasses for the last\ntime; to pledge to their faithful friendship, and the happiness of\nConingsby and Edith; when the door of the room opened, and there\nappeared, MR. RIGBY!\n\nEND OF BOOK VII.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was the heart of the London season, nearly four years ago, twelve\nmonths having almost elapsed since the occurrence of those painful\npassages at Hellingsley which closed the last book of this history, and\nlong lines of carriages an hour before midnight, up the classic mount of\nSt. James and along Piccadilly, intimated that the world were received\nat some grand entertainment in Arlington Street.\n\nIt was the town mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at\nBeaumanoir we have more than once introduced the reader, to gain whose\ncourtyard was at this moment the object of emulous coachmen, and to\nenter whose saloons was to reward the martyr-like patience of their\nlords and ladies.\n\nAmong the fortunate who had already succeeded in bowing to their hostess\nwere two gentlemen, who, ensconced in a good position, surveyed the\nscene, and made their observations on the passing guests. They\nwere gentlemen who, to judge from their general air and the great\nconsideration with which they were treated by those who were\noccasionally in their vicinity, were personages whose criticism bore\nauthority.\n\n'I say, Jemmy,' said the eldest, a dandy who had dined with the Regent,\nbut who was still a dandy, and who enjoyed life almost as much as in the\ndays when Carlton House occupied the terrace which still bears its name.\n'I say, Jemmy, what a load of young fellows there are! Don't know their\nnames at all. Begin to think fellows are younger than they used to be.\nAmazing load of young fellows, indeed!'\n\nAt this moment an individual who came under the fortunate designation\nof a young fellow, but whose assured carriage hardly intimated that\nthis was his first season in London, came up to the junior of the two\ncritics, and said, 'A pretty turn you played us yesterday at White's,\nMelton. We waited dinner nearly an hour.'\n\n'My dear fellow, I am infinitely sorry; but I was obliged to go down to\nWindsor, and I missed the return train. A good dinner? Who had you?'\n\n'A capital party, only you were wanted. We had Beaumanoir and Vere, and\nJack Tufton and Spraggs.'\n\n'Was Spraggs rich?'\n\n'Wasn't he! I have not done laughing yet. He told us a story about the\nlittle Biron who was over here last year; I knew her at Paris; and an\nIndian screen. Killing! Get him to tell it you. The richest thing you\never heard!'\n\n'Who's your friend?' inquired Mr. Melton's companion, as the young man\nmoved away.\n\n'Sir Charles Buckhurst.'\n\n'A--h! That is Sir Charles Buckhurst. Glad to have seen him. They say he\nis going it.'\n\n'He knows what he is about.'\n\n'Egad! so they all do. A young fellow now of two or three and twenty\nknows the world as men used to do after as many years of scrapes. I\nwonder where there is such a thing as a greenhorn. Effie Crabbs says\nthe reason he gives up his house is, that he has cleaned out the old\ngeneration, and that the new generation would clean him.'\n\n'Buckhurst is not in that sort of way: he swears by Henry Sydney, a\nyounger son of the Duke, whom you don't know; and young Coningsby; a\nsort of new set; new ideas and all that sort of thing. Beau tells me\na good deal about it; and when I was staying with the Everinghams,\nat Easter, they were full of it. Coningsby had just returned from his\ntravels, and they were quite on the _qui vive_. Lady Everingham is one\nof their set. I don't know what it is exactly; but I think we shall hear\nmore of it.'\n\n'A sort of animal magnetism, or unknown tongues, I take it from your\ndescription,' said his companion.\n\n'Well, I don't know what it is,' said Mr. Melton; 'but it has got hold\nof all the young fellows who have just come out. Beau is a little bit\nhimself. I had some idea of giving my mind to it, they made such a fuss\nabout it at Everingham; but it requires a devilish deal of history, I\nbelieve, and all that sort of thing.'\n\n'Ah! that's a bore,' said his companion. 'It is difficult to turn to\nwith a new thing when you are not in the habit of it. I never could\nmanage charades.'\n\nMr. Ormsby, passing by, stopped. 'They told me you had the gout,\nCassilis?' he said to Mr. Melton's companion.\n\n'So I had; but I have found out a fellow who cures the gout instanter.\nTom Needham sent him to me. A German fellow. Pumicestone pills; sort\nof a charm, I believe, and all that kind of thing: they say it rubs the\ngout out of you. I sent him to Luxborough, who was very bad; cured him\ndirectly. Luxborough swears by him.'\n\n'Luxborough believes in the Millennium,' said Mr. Ormsby.\n\n'But here's a new thing that Melton has been telling me of, that all the\nworld is going to believe in,' said Mr. Cassilis, 'something patronised\nby Lady Everingham.'\n\n'A very good patroness,' said Mr. Ormsby.\n\n'Have you heard anything about it?' continued Mr. Cassilis. 'Young\nConingsby brought it from abroad; didn't you you say so, Jemmy?'\n\n'No, no, my dear fellow; it is not at all that sort of thing.'\n\n'But they say it requires a deuced deal of history,' continued Mr.\nCassilis. 'One must brush up one's Goldsmith. Canterton used to be the\nfellow for history at White's. He was always boring one with William the\nConqueror, Julius Caesar, and all that sort of thing.'\n\n'I tell you what,' said Mr. Ormsby, looking both sly and solemn, 'I\nshould not be surprised if, some day or another, we have a history about\nLady Everingham and young Coningsby.'\n\n'Poh!' said Mr. Melton; 'he is engaged to be married to her sister, Lady\nTheresa.'\n\n'The deuce!' said Mr. Ormsby; 'well, you are a friend of the family, and\nI suppose you know.'\n\n'He is a devilish good-looking fellow, that young Coningsby,' said Mr.\nCassilis. 'All the women are in love with him, they say. Lady Eleanor\nDucie quite raves about him.'\n\n'By-the-bye, his grandfather has been very unwell,' said Mr. Ormsby,\nlooking mysteriously.\n\n'I saw Lady Monmouth here just now,' said Mr. Melton.\n\n'Oh! he is quite well again,' said Mr. Ormsby.\n\n'Got an odd story at White's that Lord Monmouth was going to separate\nfrom her,' said Mr. Cassilis.\n\n'No foundation,' said Mr. Ormsby, shaking his head.\n\n'They are not going to separate, I believe,' said Mr. Melton; 'but I\nrather think there was a foundation for the rumour.'\n\nMr. Ormsby still shook his head.\n\n'Well,' continued Mr. Melton, 'all I know is, that it was looked upon\nlast winter at Paris as a settled thing.'\n\n'There was some story about some Hungarian,' said Mr. Cassilis.\n\n'No, that blew over,' said Mr. Melton; 'it was Trautsmansdorff the row\nwas about.'\n\nAll this time Mr. Ormsby, as the friend of Lord and Lady Monmouth,\nremained shaking his head; but as a member of society, and therefore\ndelighting in small scandal, appropriating the gossip with the greatest\navidity.\n\n'I should think old Monmouth was not the sort of fellow to blow up a\nwoman,' said Mr. Cassilis.\n\n'Provided she would leave him quietly,' said Mr. Melton.\n\n'Yes, Lord Monmouth never could live with a woman more than two years,'\nsaid Mr. Ormsby, pensively. 'And that I thought at the time rather an\nobjection to his marriage.'\n\nWe must now briefly revert to what befell our hero after those unhappy\noccurrences in the midst of whose first woe we left him.\n\nThe day after the arrival of Mr. Rigby at the Castle, Coningsby quitted\nit for London, and before a week had elapsed had embarked for Cadiz. He\nfelt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some\nblood, and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she\nspoke it. A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit\nAthens and the AEgean, which he much desired. In the pensive beauties\nof that delicate land, where perpetual autumn seems to reign, Coningsby\nfound solace. There is something in the character of Grecian scenery\nwhich blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of\nthe sorrowful. Coningsby passed his winter at Rome. The wish of his\ngrandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England\nsomewhat abruptly. Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country\nsince his marriage; but the period that had elapsed since that event had\nconsiderably improved the prospects of his party. The majority of the\nWhig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than\nnominal; and though it was circulated among their friends, as if from\nthe highest authority, that 'one was enough,' there seemed daily a\nbetter chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit. For the\nfirst time in the history of this country since the introduction of the\nsystem of parliamentary sovereignty, the Government of England depended\non the fate of single elections; and indeed, by a single vote, it is\nremarkable to observe, the fate of the Whig Government was ultimately\ndecided.\n\nThis critical state of affairs, duly reported to Lord Monmouth, revived\nhis political passions, and offered him that excitement which he was\never seeking, and yet for which he had often sighed. The Marquess, too,\nwas weary of Paris. Every day he found it more difficult to be amused.\nLucretia had lost her charm. He, from whom nothing could be concealed,\nperceived that often, while she elaborately attempted to divert him, her\nmind was wandering elsewhere. Lord Monmouth was quite superior to all\npetty jealousy and the vulgar feelings of inferior mortals, but his\nsublime selfishness required devotion. He had calculated that a wife\nor a mistress who might be in love with another man, however powerfully\ntheir interests might prompt them, could not be so agreeable or amusing\nto their friends and husbands as if they had no such distracting hold\nupon their hearts or their fancy. Latterly at Paris, while Lucretia\nbecame each day more involved in the vortex of society, where all\nadmired and some adored her, Lord Monmouth fell into the easy habit of\ndining in his private rooms, sometimes t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate with Villebecque,\nwhose inexhaustible tales and adventures about a kind of society which\nLord Monmouth had always preferred infinitely to the polished and\nsomewhat insipid circles in which he was born, had rendered him the\nprime favourite of his great patron. Sometimes Villebecque, too, brought\na friend, male or otherwise, whom he thought invested with the rare\nfaculty of distraction: Lord Monmouth cared not who or what they were,\nprovided they were diverting.\n\nVillebecque had written to Coningsby at Rome, by his grandfather's\ndesire, to beg him to return to England and meet Lord Monmouth there.\nThe letter was couched with all the respect and good feeling which\nVillebecque really entertained for him whom he addressed; still a letter\non such a subject from such a person was not agreeable to Coningsby, and\nhis reply to it was direct to his grandfather; Lord Monmouth, however,\nhad entirely given over writing letters.\n\nConingsby had met at Paris, on his way to England, Lord and Lady\nEveringham, and he had returned with them. This revival of an old\nacquaintance was both agreeable and fortunate for our hero. The vivacity\nof a clever and charming woman pleasantly disturbed the brooding memory\nof Coningsby. There is no mortification however keen, no misery however\ndesperate, which the spirit of woman cannot in some degree lighten or\nalleviate. About, too, to make his formal entrance into the great\nworld, he could not have secured a more valuable and accomplished\nfemale friend. She gave him every instruction, every intimation that\nwas necessary; cleared the social difficulties which in some degree are\nexperienced on their entrance into the world even by the most highly\nconnected, unless they have this benign assistance; planted him\nimmediately in the position which was expedient; took care that he was\ninvited at once to the right houses; and, with the aid of her husband,\nthat he should become a member of the right clubs.\n\n'And who is to have the blue ribbon, Lord Eskdale?' said the Duchess to\nthat nobleman, as he entered and approached to pay his respects.\n\n'If I were Melbourne, I would keep it open,' replied his Lordship. 'It\nis a mistake to give away too quickly.'\n\n'But suppose they go out,' said her Grace.\n\n'Oh! there is always a last day to clear the House. But they will be\nin another year. The cliff will not be sapped before then. We made a\nmistake last year about the ladies.'\n\n'I know you always thought so.'\n\n'Quarrels about women are always a mistake. One should make it a rule to\ngive up to them, and then they are sure to give up to us.'\n\n'You have no great faith in our firmness?'\n\n'Male firmness is very often obstinacy: women have always something\nbetter, worth all qualities; they have tact.'\n\n'A compliment to the sex from so finished a critic as Lord Eskdale is\nappreciated.'\n\nBut at this moment the arrival of some guests terminated the\nconversation, and Lord Eskdale moved away, and approached a group which\nLady Everingham was enlightening.\n\n'My dear Lord Fitz-booby,' her Ladyship observed, 'in politics we\nrequire faith as well as in all other things.'\n\nLord Fitz-booby looked rather perplexed; but, possessed of considerable\nofficial experience, having held high posts, some in the cabinet, for\nnearly a quarter of a century, he was too versed to acknowledge that he\nhad not understood a single word that had been addressed to him for the\nlast ten minutes. He looked on with the same grave, attentive stolidity,\noccasionally nodding his head, as he was wont of yore when he received\na deputation on sugar duties or joint-stock banks, and when he made,\nas was his custom when particularly perplexed, an occasional note on a\nsheet of foolscap paper.\n\n'An Opposition in an age of revolution,' continued Lady Everingham,\n'must be founded on principles. It cannot depend on mere personal\nability and party address taking advantage of circumstances. You have\nnot enunciated a principle for the last ten years; and when you seemed\non the point of acceding to power, it was not on a great question of\nnational interest, but a technical dispute respecting the constitution\nof an exhausted sugar colony.'\n\n'If you are a Conservative party, we wish to know what you want to\nconserve,' said Lord Vere.\n\n'If it had not been for the Whig abolition of slavery,' said Lord\nFitz-booby, goaded into repartee, 'Jamaica would not have been an\nexhausted sugar colony.'\n\n'Then what you do want to conserve is slavery?' said Lord Vere.\n\n'No,' said Lord Fitz-booby, 'I am never for retracing our steps.'\n\n'But will you advance, will you move? And where will you advance, and\nhow will you move?' said Lady Everingham.\n\n'I think we have had quite enough of advancing,' said his Lordship. 'I\nhad no idea your Ladyship was a member of the Movement party,' he added,\nwith a sarcastic grin.\n\n'But if it were bad, Lord Fitz-booby, to move where we are, as you\nand your friends have always maintained, how can you reconcile it to\nprinciple to remain there?' said Lord Vere.\n\n'I would make the best of a bad bargain,' said Lord Fitz-booby. 'With\na Conservative government, a reformed Constitution would be less\ndangerous.'\n\n'Why?' said Lady Everingham. 'What are your distinctive principles that\nrender the peril less?'\n\n'I appeal to Lord Eskdale,' said Lord Fitz-booby; 'there is Lady\nEveringham turned quite a Radical, I declare. Is not your Lordship of\nopinion that the country must be safer with a Conservative government\nthan with a Liberal?'\n\n'I think the country is always tolerably secure,' said Lord Eskdale.\n\nLady Theresa, leaning on the arm of Mr. Lyle, came up at this moment,\nand unconsciously made a diversion in favour of Lord Fitz-booby.\n\n'Pray, Theresa,' said Lady Everingham, 'where is Mr. Coningsby?'\n\nLet us endeavour to ascertain. It so happened that on this day Coningsby\nand Henry Sydney dined at Grillion's, at an university club, where,\namong many friends whom Coningsby had not met for a long time, and among\ndelightful reminiscences, the unconscious hours stole on. It was late\nwhen they quitted Grillion's, and Coningsby's brougham was detained for\na considerable time before its driver could insinuate himself into the\nline, which indeed he would never have succeeded in doing had not he\nfortunately come across the coachman of the Duke of Agincourt, who being\nof the same politics as himself, belonging to the same club, and always\nblack-balling the same men, let him in from a legitimate party feeling;\nso they arrived in Arlington Street at a very late hour.\n\nConingsby was springing up the staircase, now not so crowded as it had\nbeen, and met a retiring party; he was about to say a passing word to a\ngentleman as he went by, when, suddenly, Coningsby turned deadly pale.\nThe gentleman could hardly be the cause, for it was the gracious and\nhandsome presence of Lord Beaumanoir: the lady resting on his arm was\nEdith. They moved on while he was motionless; yet Edith and himself\nhad exchanged glances. His was one of astonishment; but what was the\nexpression of hers? She must have recognised him before he had observed\nher. She was collected, and she expressed the purpose of her mind in\na distant and haughty recognition. Coningsby remained for a moment\nstupefied; then suddenly turning back, he bounded downstairs and hurried\ninto the cloak-room. He met Lady Wallinger; he spoke rapidly, he held\nher hand, did not listen to her answers, his eyes wandered about. There\nwere many persons present, at length he recognised Edith enveloped in\nher mantle. He went forward, he looked at her, as if he would have read\nher soul; he said something. She changed colour as he addressed her,\nbut seemed instantly by an effort to rally and regain her equanimity;\nreplied to his inquiries with extreme brevity, and Lady Wallinger's\ncarriage being announced, moved away with the same slight haughty salute\nas before, on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nSadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure\nof Coningsby from Hellingsley. When the first pang was over, Edith\nhad found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always\nappreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired\nonly to soften sorrow, and not to create hope. But Lady Wallinger,\nthough she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time\nquitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.\nHer brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his\nfriend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in\nfuture, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.\nMr. Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend\nSir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports\nfrom his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his\nnumerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of\nthe alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.\nBut when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any\nlonger to be blind to the great change. That happy and equable gaiety of\nspirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,\nand which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting. Her sunny glance\nwas gone. She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was\nfitful, unequal in her tone. That temper whose sweetness had been a\ndomestic proverb had become a little uncertain. Not that her affection\nfor her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual\nirritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of\ntenderness that were the creatures of compunction. And often, after some\nhasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the\nfondness of remorse. She pursued her usual avocations, for she had\nreally too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of\ntoo strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and\ndistraction. Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with\nthese; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.\nBut there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr. Millbank felt it.\n\nMr. Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved. Edith, his Edith, the pride\nand delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of\nexultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;\nand there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond\nfather, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness. It would\nappear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of\ngratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery. Truly\nhad the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.\nAnd yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr. Millbank that he had\nacted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision. How otherwise\nwas he to have acted? The union was impossible; the speedier their\nseparation, therefore, clearly the better. Unfortunate, indeed, had been\nhis absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have\nprevented the catastrophe. Oswald should have hindered all this. And\nyet Mr. Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to\nConingsby. He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from\nthat quarter. Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as\na despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had\nabsolutely acted in an inevitable manner! Edith seemed sad, Oswald\nsullen; all was changed. All the objects for which this clear-headed,\nstrong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed\nto be frustrated. And why? Because a young man had made love to his\ndaughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.\n\nAs the autumn drew on, Mr. Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing\ncircumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that\nthey should pay a visit to their earlier home. Edith assented without\ndifficulty, but without interest. And yet, as Mr. Millbank immediately\nperceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits\nof Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley. There were\nmore objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial. If\nMr. Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from\nConingsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have\nrecognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of\nhis daughter which had so greatly gratified him.\n\nAbout a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.\nMillbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him. But\nLondon in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father\nalways occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them\nall, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or\ncheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother. Oswald had\nheard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did\nnot anticipate his return to England. His tone was affectionate, but\ndispirited.\n\nLady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.\nMillbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took\na house and carried Edith back with him to London. Lady Wallinger,\nwho had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a\nnot inconsiderable position in society. She had a fine house in a\nfashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments. The Whigs\nwere under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were\ngratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom\nthey could be courteous without any annoyance. So that Edith, under the\nauspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise\nshe might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and\nexperience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified\nher to shine in. One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their\nfriend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was\nseldom from their side. His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both\non the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,\nbut to express that consideration for Mr. Millbank which the Duke always\nwished to show. It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.\nMillbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society. He liked the\nHouse of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked\nat committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the\nnight; always dined at Bellamy's when there was a house; and when there\nwas not, liked dining at the Fishmongers' Company, the Russia Company,\ngreat Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities. That was\nhis idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good\ndinner, and good speeches afterwards.\n\nEdith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother\nhad heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.\nA season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,\nperhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together\nover the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each\nother's unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of\nyouth, foreseeing a more felicitous future. She had been nearly a\nfortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as\nConingsby, they had not yet met. It was one of those results which\ncould rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the\nleague against lovers. The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was\ntherefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely\ndoubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord\nBeaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.\nNever, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering\nspirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders\nthe young heart.\n\nIn vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom\nfor a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over. He was not\nthere; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most\nrequired solace, she learned from Mr. Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,\nwhom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.\nConingsby!\n\nWhat a revelation! His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no\nlonger inexplicable. What a return for all her romantic devotion in her\nsad solitude at Hellingsley. Was this the end of their twilight rambles,\nand the sweet pathos of their mutual loves? There seemed to be no truth\nin man, no joy in life! All the feelings that she had so generously\nlavished, all returned upon herself. She could have burst into a passion\nof tears and buried herself in a cloister.\n\nInstead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though\ntortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a\nheadache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,\nher escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.\n\nAs for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the\nunexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which\nshe had received him. To say that her appearance had revived all his\npassionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the\nnature of his feelings. His affection had never for a moment swerved; it\nwas profound and firm. But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought\nbefore him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that\nsubsisted between them. There was the being whom he loved and who loved\nhim; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life\nplaced against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament\nof an unpolluted heart.\n\nConingsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to\nEngland: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit\nfaltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and\nmourning over his chagrined fortunes. Once more in England, once more\nplaced in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased\nconviction the difficulties which surrounded him. The society of Lady\nEveringham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,\nhad been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering\ntoo much from the tension of one idea. But Coningsby had treated the\nmatrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity\nin which he believed it had first half originated. He admired and liked\nLady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even\nhad his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which\nmen of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.\n\nAfter musing and meditating again and again over everything that had\noccurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,\nresolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,\nwho, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.\n\nYet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was\nat breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,\napprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible\non urgent business.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nLord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was\nfirst introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of\npapers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his\nobservations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.\n\nThus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.\n\n'You see, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, 'that I am much occupied to-day,\nyet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing\nthat it could not be postponed.' He made a sign to Villebecque, and his\nsecretary instantly retired.\n\n'I was right in pressing your return to England,' continued Lord\nMonmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending\ncommunication, which he could not in any way anticipate. 'These are not\ntimes when young men should be out of sight. Your public career will\ncommence immediately. The Government have resolved on a dissolution. My\ninformation is from the highest quarter. You may be astonished, but\nit is a fact. They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.\nNotwithstanding this and the Queen's name, we can beat them; but the\nrace requires the finest jockeying. We can't give a point. Tadpole has\nbeen here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may\nsay an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government\ncount on the seat, though with the new Registration 'tis nearly a tie.\nIf we had a good candidate we could win. But Rigby won't do. He is too\nmuch of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse. We are\nassured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable\nsection who support the present fellow who will not vote against a\nConingsby. They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved\nof the suggestion. You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford\nwith my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be\nsuccessful. You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very\ngratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only\nConingsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to\ndo so as early as I could fairly desire.'\n\nConingsby the rival of Mr. Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!\nVanquished or victorious, equally a catastrophe! The fierce passions,\nthe gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and\nthe ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which\nhe was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best\nin the world, occurred to him with anguish. The countenance of\nEdith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again. He saw her\ncanvassing for her father, and against him. Madness! And for what was\nhe to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition? Not even\nfor that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much! Mighty\nambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys! To enter the House of\nCommons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and\nto labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the\nconsolation of being a dupe. What sympathy could there exist between\nConingsby and the 'great Conservative party,' that for ten years in\nan age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only\nintelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very\ngrateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive\nIrish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to\nevince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this\nmoment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in\nopen insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?\n\n'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?' inquired\nConingsby after a moment's pause.\n\n'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful. It may be next\nmonth; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord\nEskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me. He is very safe.\nTadpole believes they will dissolve at once. But whether they dissolve\nnow, or in a month's time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course\nis clear. We must declare our intentions immediately. We must hoist our\nflag. Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford. You\nmust attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you\nto announce yourself.'\n\n'Don't you think, sir,' said Coningsby, 'that such an announcement would\nbe rather premature? It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may\nlast a year; perhaps more.'\n\n'What you say is very true,' said Lord Monmouth; 'no doubt it is very\ntroublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is. But we must take things\nas we find them. You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old\ngentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has\nbeen fostered for our purpose.'\n\nConingsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,\nand then gave something like a sigh.\n\n'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,' said Lord\nMonmouth. 'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in\nso short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.'\n\n'You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,' said\nConingsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,\n'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.'\n\n'What?' said Lord Monmouth.\n\n'I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a\nresponsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Responsibility!' said Lord Monmouth, smiling. 'What responsibility is\nthere? How can any one have a more agreeable seat? The only person to\nwhom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in. And I\ndon't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us. You\nare certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when\nI first went in; and I found no difficulty. There can be no difficulty.\nAll you have got to do is to vote with your party. As for speaking, if\nyou have a talent that way, take my advice; don't be in a hurry. Learn\nto know the House; learn the House to know you. If a man be discreet, he\ncannot enter Parliament too soon.'\n\n'It is not exactly that, sir,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Then what is it, my dear Harry? You see to-day I have much to do; yet\nas your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour. I\nthought you would have been very much gratified.'\n\n'You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,'\nreplied Coningsby. 'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood\nby the Conservative party.'\n\n'Of course; our friends.'\n\n'I am sorry,' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,\n'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.'\n\n'By ----!' exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat, 'some woman\nhas got hold of him, and made him a Whig!'\n\n'No, my dear grandfather,' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a\nsmile, serious as the interview was becoming, 'nothing of the kind, I\nassure you. No person can be more anti-Whig.'\n\n'I don't know what you are driving at, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, in a\nhard, dry tone.\n\n'I wish to be frank, sir,' said Coningsby, 'and am very sensible of your\ngoodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject. What I mean to\nsay is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party\nas a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,\nthan from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal\nto the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real\ncharacter.'\n\n'You mean giving up those Irish corporations?' said Lord Monmouth.\n'Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion. But we must\nmount higher; we must go to '28 for the real mischief. But what is the\nuse of lamenting the past? Peel is the only man; suited to the times and\nall that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can't go\nback. And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of\nthe hands of our own order. It was never thought of in the time of your\ngreat-grandfather, sir. And if a commoner were for a season permitted\nto be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret\ncommittee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.'\n\n'I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles\nagain,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Then what the devil do you want to see?' said Lord Monmouth.\n\n'Political faith,' said Coningsby, 'instead of political infidelity.'\n\n'Hem!' said Lord Monmouth.\n\n'Before I support Conservative principles,' continued Coningsby, 'I\nmerely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve. It\nwould not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal\nportion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late\nroyal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot. Is it the Church\nwhich they wish to conserve? What is a threatened Appropriation Clause\nagainst an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary\nLaymen? Could the Long Parliament have done worse? Well, then, if it\nis neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this\nConservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House\nof Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold? Is it not notorious\nthat the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,\ndeclares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly\nthat used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles\nthat you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is\nto subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial\ntranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?'\n\n'All this is vastly fine,' said Lord Monmouth; 'but I see no means by\nwhich I can attain my object but by supporting Peel. After all, what is\nthe end of all parties and all politics? To gain your object. I want to\nturn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony\ncalled out of abeyance in your favour. It is impossible that Peel can\nrefuse me. I have already purchased an ample estate with the view\nof entailing it on you and your issue. You will make a considerable\nalliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney. I hear the\nreport with pleasure. Count on my at once entering into any arrangement\nconducive to your happiness.'\n\n'My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and\ngenerous.'\n\n'To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never\ncrossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud? Yes, Harry, it\ngratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success. All I want\nnow is to see you in Parliament. A man should be in Parliament early.\nThere is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his\ntalents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the\noccasion offers. You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities\nwell; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the\nBed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;\nstick to the Irish Registration Bill, that's a good card; and, above\nall, my dear Harry, don't spare that fellow Millbank. Remember, in\nturning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause\nand our coronet, but you crush my foe. Spare nothing for that object; I\ncount on you, boy.'\n\n'I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your\ninterest or your honour, sir,' said Coningsby, with an air of great\nembarrassment.\n\n'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,' said Lord Monmouth, in a\ntone of some kindness.\n\n'And I feel at this moment,' continued Coningsby, 'that there is no\npersonal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.\nMy interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,\nif yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might\ninvolve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well\nendure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous\ntolerance.'\n\n'I can't follow you, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.\n'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be\nany sacrifice of conduct on your part. What you mean by sacrifice of\naffections, I don't comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no\nbusiness to have any other than those I uphold. You are too young to\nform opinions.'\n\n'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,'\nreplied Coningsby; 'I have never intruded them on your ear before;\nbut this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about\nto commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be\nfrank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one\nof those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many\npublic men have cause to deplore.'\n\n'You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider\nyour opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'but men going with their\nfamilies like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which\nthe society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform\nBill.'\n\n'D---- the Reform Bill!' said Lord Monmouth; 'if the Duke had not\nquarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had\nthe Reform Bill. And Grey would have gone to Ireland.'\n\n'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,' said Coningsby.\n\n'No, no, no,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the Tory party is organised now; they\nwill not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have\ndone the business.'\n\n'But what are they organised for?' said Coningsby. 'At the best to turn\nout the Whigs. And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then? You\nmay get your ducal coronet, sir. But a duke now is not so great a man\nas a baron was but a century back. We cannot struggle against the\nirresistible stream of circumstances. Power has left our order; this is\nnot an age for factitious aristocracy. As for my grandmother's barony, I\nshould look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the\nact of my political extinction. What we want, sir, is not to fashion\nnew dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles\nwhich may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people. Let\nme see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit\nof our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days\nof faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all\ntenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought\nabout, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,\nand public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in\nParliament an enviable distinction.'\n\n'I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily, 'members\nof this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.\nYou must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate\nfor the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions. I would say,\nyou must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a\nprevious intimation of your movement. And that cannot be done to-day. I\nsent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and\nfind he is out of town. He will return to-morrow; and will be here at\nthree o'clock, when you can meet him. You will meet him, I doubt not,\nlike a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a\nglance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to\nsacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical\npuerilities.'\n\nHis Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent\nany further conversation, resumed his papers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nIt would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,\nto have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the\ncourt-yard of Monmouth House. The love of Edith would have consoled\nhim for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his\nambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed\naffections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source\nof solace. There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at\ntimes the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is\npast; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,\ndespair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:\nand that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of\nbaffled aspirations.\n\nNor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate\nhimself from the perils that were encompassing him. There was something\nabout his grandfather that defied persuasion. Prone as eloquent\nyouth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,\nConingsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth. There had been\na callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,\nthat at once baffled all attempts at influence. Nor could Coningsby\nforget the look he received when he quitted the room. There was no\npossibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,\n'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'\n\nThis was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of\nfriendship might have been grateful. A clever woman might have afforded\neven more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released\nhim from the mesh in which he was involved. And once Coningsby had\nturned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham. But\nsurely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which\nsubsisted between himself and Edith. No, that must never be violated.\nThen there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to\nher. He resolved to tell her all. He looked in for a moment at a club\nto take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction. A few men were\nstanding in a bow window. He heard Mr. Cassilis say,\n\n'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?'\n\n'I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion. 'Has\nshe any tin?'\n\n'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr. Cassilis.' The father is a cotton\nlord, and they all have loads of tin, you know. Nothing like them now.'\n\n'He is in Parliament, is not he?'\n\n''Gad, I believe he is,' said Mr. Cassilis; 'I never know who is in\nParliament in these days. I remember when there were only ten men in the\nHouse of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.\nEverything is so deuced changed.'\n\n'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman. 'It was all\ndone a year ago at Rome or Paris.'\n\n'They say she refused him then,' said Mr. Cassilis.\n\n'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his\nfriend. 'What next?'\n\n'I wonder how the Duke likes it?' said Mr. Cassilis.\n\n'Or the Duchess?' added one of his friends.\n\n'Or the Everinghams?' added the other.\n\n'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.\nCassilis.\n\n'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.\n\nConingsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart. In spite\nof every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his\naspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously\nto himself, was Edith. It was over. The strange manner of last night was\nfatally explained. The heart that once had been his was now another's.\nTo the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound\nand desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable. All the recollection\nof the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into\none bewildering anguish. Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his\nhorse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.\nHe found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and\nundisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the\ncontemplation of his prospects.\n\nEdith was lost. Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his\nmission, and go down to Darlford on Friday? Favour and fortune, power,\nprosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;\nmight not he add even vengeance? Was there to be no term to his\nendurance? Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with\nall his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson? And his\ndaughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her\nflush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,\nif indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the\nhumbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever\ncould have been the hero of her romantic girlhood? What degradation in\nthe idea? His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!\n\nIt was a conjuncture in his life that required decision. He thought of\nhis companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of\nhis fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were\nall these high and fond fancies to be balked? On the very threshold of\nlife was he to blunder? 'Tis the first step that leads to all, and\nhis was to be a wilful error. He remembered his first visit to his\ngrandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his\nreturn. After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then\nso highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on\nwere on the very eve of accomplishment? Parliament and riches, and rank\nand power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could\nmistake. Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,\nperhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain? No, by heaven, no!\nHe was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the\nplanets on its fatal waters. The die was cast.\n\nThe sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation\nof his spirit died away. Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and\ntranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like\nseraphs. He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of\nthe pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of\nhumanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring\npurpose of his life. What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition\nto him? No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his\nknowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience. If he\npossessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world\nwould recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal. If the\nprinciples of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation\nwould respond to their expression. Coningsby felt at this moment a\nprofound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct\nwhich would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the\nconscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.\nConscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his\nlife, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame\nthat was perhaps a dream.\n\nIt was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,\non his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed\nall that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all\nthe pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already\nannounced. In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to\nbecome a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as\nthe master of his own conduct.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nLady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which\nhad been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr. Rigby, but as he\nthen believed for the Princess Colonna. The walls were hung with amber\nsatin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from\nhis brilliant and picturesque pencil. Fair forms, heroes and heroines\nin dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is\ncommonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid\npalaces and gardens. The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion\nof the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet. Upon a violet\ncarpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.\n\nIt was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and\nFlora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to\nher as she was employed with some light work.\n\n''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia. 'They say it is good.'\n\nFlora, seated by her side, began to read. Reading was an accomplishment\nwhich distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression\nwas uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page. More\nthan once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.\nSuddenly Flora stopped and burst into tears.\n\n'O! madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.\nConingsby, all might be right!'\n\n'What is this?' said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,\ncollecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,\nand more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the\nmatter?'\n\n'My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr. Coningsby.'\n\nAn expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.\n\n'Why have they quarrelled?'\n\n'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;\nbut my Lord is very angry with Mr. Coningsby.'\n\n'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'\n\n'Oh! very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully. 'My\nLord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr. Coningsby would never enter\nthe house again.'\n\n'Was it to-day?' asked Lucretia.\n\n'This morning. Mr. Coningsby has only left this hour or two. He will not\ndo what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber. I do not know\nexactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my\nfather is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'\n\n'Has Mr. Rigby been here to-day?' asked Lucretia.\n\n'Mr. Rigby is not in town. My father went for Mr. Rigby this morning\nbefore Mr. Coningsby came, and he found that Mr. Rigby was not in town.\nThat is why I know it.'\n\nLady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down\nthe room. Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is\nstupid; it does not amuse me. Stop: find out all you can for me about\nthe quarrel before I speak to Mr. Coningsby.'\n\nFlora quitted the room. Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;\nthen she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr. Rigby.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nWhat a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby! Here was one\nof the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,\nboth waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to\ntransact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without\nhis interposition! What was the secret of the influence of this man,\nconfided in by everybody, trusted by none? His counsels were not deep,\nhis expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could\ncreate no sympathy. It is that, in most of the transactions of life,\nthere is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which\neverybody wishes to be achieved. This was always the portion of Mr.\nRigby. In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being\nmixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine\nmanagement, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and\nthe airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in\nlife had ever been, to do the dirty work.\n\nMr. Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late. He was concocting,\nyou could not term it composing, an article, a 'very slashing article,'\nwhich was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the\naristocracy. It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style. His\nparallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland\nHill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine. It was full\nof passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew\ntears. The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.\nSeveral of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in\noffice with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against\nthat spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him\nwith information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could\nhave furnished. The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress\nof democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on\nAldborough or Amersham. There never was a fellow for giving a good\nhearty kick to the people like Rigby. Himself sprung from the dregs of\nthe populace, this was disinterested. What could be more patriotic and\nmagnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the\nCrillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners! The\ntruth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,\nby an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the\nmaintenance of an aristocracy. All his rigmarole dissertations on the\nFrench revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he\nwailed over 'la guerre aux ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over\nNottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to\nquarter-day!\n\nArriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his\ngrandfather, Mr. Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,\nand an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing\nto prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the\nMarquess.\n\nLucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the\ncourse of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate\ndetails of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.\nShe could inform Mr. Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was\nhighly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their\nmisunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that\nseat too the one which Mr. Rigby had long appropriated to himself,\nand over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate\nsolicitude.\n\nLady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and\ngave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect\nupon her confederate. The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as\nhe received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,\nplayed over his features.\n\n'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth. 'He is, he\nhas ever been, in the way of both of us.'\n\n'He is in my power,' said Rigby. 'We can crush him!'\n\n'How?'\n\n'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought\nHellingsley.'\n\n'Hah!' exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.\n\n'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her. I found the\nyounger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of\nitself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.'\n\n'And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr. Rigby,'\nsaid Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile. 'It was a weapon of service. I\ngive you my compliments.'\n\n'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr. Rigby.\n\n'But it is now most mature. Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,\nsince his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in\nthe same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.\nMy Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this\nboy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,\nhave apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never\ndoubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit\nis plucked by one who has not watched the garden. You take me? There is\nno reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what\nwe want, and more securely if we work in company.'\n\n'I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'\n\n'Nor to yourself, dear Mr. Rigby. Go now: the game is before you. Rid\nme of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want. Doubt not\nme. There is no reason. I want a firm ally. There must be two.'\n\n'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done. If once the notion\ngets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for\nDarlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised. It must be\ndone at once. I know that the Government will dissolve.'\n\n'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia. 'Be sure there is no time to\nlose. What does he want with you to-day?'\n\n'I know not: there are so many things.'\n\n'To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.\nLet not the occasion be lost. Whatever his mood, the subject may be\nintroduced. If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love\nfor the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,\ndrinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you\nwill omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash\nhim to madness! 'Tis quite ripe. Not a word that you have seen me. Go,\ngo, or he may hear that you have arrived. I shall be at home all the\nmorning. It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit\nwhen you have transacted your business. You understand. _Au revoir!_'\n\nLady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced\nover the page, unattached by its contents. Her own existence was too\ninteresting to find any excitement in fiction. It was nearly three years\nsince her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was\nto lead to results still greater. Of late she had often been filled with\na presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on\nthis day. Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to\nmeditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same\ntime dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart. Notwithstanding the\ngossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's\ncharacter or information, based on the haphazard observations of the\nfloating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her\ninfluence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished. But\nsatisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of\nher position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have\nfound it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.\nShe knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;\nand that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold. Their\npassions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are\nrather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not\nsystematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is\nnot her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates\nthe respect of him who should be devoted to her.\n\nThe health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent\nfrom the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia. She was well assured that\nhis life was no longer secure. She knew that after their marriage he had\nmade a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in\ncase of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all\nhope in that respect was over. Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord\nMonmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to\nwhich his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had\nalarmed Lucretia. To establish in the land another branch of the house\nof Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and\nperhaps a permanent one. If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding\nthe limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start\ncontemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be\nconvinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately\nbe devoted to its practical fulfilment. Her original prejudice against\nConingsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been\nconsiderably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time\nthere was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled\nher with excitement and hope. She knew her Lord well enough to feel\nassured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not\nbe a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not\nbe transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this\nendeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish\nall her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was\ndefending his own position and advancing his own interests.\n\nLady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.\nRigby. His interview with his patron was of unusual length. An hour, and\nmore than an hour, had elapsed. Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book\nwhich more than once she had discarded. She paced the room, restless\nrather than disquieted. She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability\nfor the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,\nshe could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the\ncircumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration. Still time\nstole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting\non her nervous system. She began to think that Rigby had not found\nthe occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from\napprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,\nhad avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination\nfor the moment had missed. Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a\nstate of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr. Rigby\nwere with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that\ngentleman appeared.\n\n'How long you have been!' exclaimed Lady Monmouth. 'Now sit down and\ntell me what has passed.'\n\nLady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.\n\n'I thank your Ladyship,' said Mr. Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet\nperplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little\ndistance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'\n\nThere was a pause. Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady\nMonmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.\nRigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression\nwith regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.\n\n'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?'\n\n'Everything,' said Mr. Rigby.\n\n'And what did he say?'\n\n'His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr. Rigby, with a pious\nexpression of features. 'Such monstrous ingratitude! As his Lordship\nvery justly observed, \"It is impossible to say what is going on under my\nown roof, or to what I can trust.\"'\n\n'But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.\nRigby,' said Lady Monmouth.\n\n'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire\nconfidence,' said Mr. Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his\ndifficulties.'\n\n'Very sensible of him. And what is to become of Mr. Coningsby?'\n\n'The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the\nestablishment generally,' said Mr. Rigby, 'will allow the connection\nthat at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,\nnow that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to\nterminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.'\n\n'But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his\nestablishment generally?'\n\n'Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'\n\n'Oh! is he going to drag me abroad again?' exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with\ngreat impatience.\n\n'Why, not exactly,' said Mr. Rigby, rather demurely.\n\n'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.'\n\n'Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might\nfind some of the German Baths agreeable.'\n\n 'Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German\nbathing-place!'\n\n'Exactly,' said Mr. Rigby.\n\n'Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?'\n\n'He does not want to go to them!'\n\n'What do you mean, Mr. Rigby?' said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and\nlooking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.\n\nThere was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby. It was as if\nmalignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed\nhimself into doggedness.\n\n'I mean what Lord Monmouth means. He suggests that if your Ladyship were\nto pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the\n_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you\nthere, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment\ntake the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately\nreach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.'\n\n'A separation!' said Lady Monmouth.\n\n'Quite amicable,' said Mr. Rigby. 'I would never have consented to\ninterfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.'\n\n'I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural\npallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.\n\n'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr. Rigby, rather stubbornly.\n\n'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.' She bowed\nhaughtily.\n\n'His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'\n\nLucretia sprang from the sofa.\n\n'Miserable craven!' she exclaimed. 'Has the cowardly tyrant fled? And\nhe really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!\nPah! He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not. Begone, sir!'\n\n'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr. Rigby, 'your\nLadyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly\nbefore your excellent judgment. Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:\nyou know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions. He has\nleft peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal. He has\nempowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way\nto consider your convenience. He suggests that everything, in short,\nshould be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;\nthat your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which\nshall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find\nit convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr. Rigby, with some\nhesitation.\n\n'And suppose I cannot?'\n\n'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your\nrights.'\n\n'We!'\n\n'I beg your Ladyship's pardon. I speak as the friend of the family, the\ntrustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's\nexecutor,' said Mr. Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its\nusual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he\nremembered the good things which he enumerated.\n\n'I have decided,' said Lady Monmouth. 'I will assert my rights. Your\nmaster has mistaken my character and his own position. He shall rue the\nday that he assailed me.'\n\n'I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr. Rigby,\n'especially as everything is left to my management and control. An\noffice, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.\nI think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some\nconsiderations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion\nthat it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we\nhave hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'\nRigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.\n\n'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said\nLucretia.\n\n'Now, now, you are unkind. Your Ladyship mistakes my position. I am\ninterfering in this business for your sake. I might have refused the\noffice. It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled\nit without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings. View my\ninterposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances\nwill assume altogether a new colour.'\n\n'I beg that you will quit the house, sir.'\n\nMr. Rigby shook his head. 'I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were\nit in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should\ntake up my residence here permanently. The servants are now my servants.\nIt is useless to ring the bell. For your Ladyship's sake, I wish\neverything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,\nfriendliness and good feeling. You can have even a week for the\npreparations for your departure, if necessary. I will take that upon\nmyself. Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all\nthose that are not at the bankers'. The arrangement about your jointure,\nyour letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;\nonly too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way\ncontributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may\nnaturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,\nwill wear off.'\n\n'I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth. 'He is a\ngentleman.'\n\n'I am quite sure,' said Mr. Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the\nsame advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he\nadded slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.'\n\n'My letters?' said Lady Monmouth.\n\n'Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard\nsome treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I\nhave them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as\na foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,\nhaving the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,\nand having known you so many years.'\n\n'Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth. 'Send me my\nservant, if I have one. I shall not remain here the week which you\nmention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.\nAdieu! Mr. Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot\nhelp feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'\n\nMr. Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the\nhouse, and then withdrew.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nA paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with\nhis grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town\nfor the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day\nat Monmouth House in consequence. There he learnt more authentic details\nof their unexpected movements. It appeared that Lady Monmouth had\ncertainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,\ninformed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could\nnot tell. At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was\nabout to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time\nbeen fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr. Rigby, who, as\nConingsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House. All\nthis intelligence made Coningsby ponder. He was sufficiently acquainted\nwith the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the\nwhole truth. What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of\nthe occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of\nwas, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.\n\nConingsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection. With the\nexception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from\nLord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed. There was\nalso something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating\nto young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but\npleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to\nhis grandson. The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced\nin life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and\nfacility, is bewitching. Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was\nalways pithy, and could be picturesque. He revealed a character in a\nsentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.\nBesides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on\nthe whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,\nthese were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more\nprecious.\n\nWith these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that\nhis grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit. He\nwas informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a\ndrawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he\nsoon discovered to be actresses. They also had come down to pay a visit\nto his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval\nthat must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his\ngrandson. Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest\nspirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious\npractical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works. And\nwell it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,\nand no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and\nno herald to announce his grandfather's advent. The ladies and Coningsby\nhad exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the\nfurniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and\nClotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to\nErmengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage\nwas in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth\nhoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he\ninformed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry\nhe was too much engaged to see him.\n\nNothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.\n'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and\ntell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with\nyou.'\n\nConingsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.\nHe felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;\nand as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong\nimpression that he was destined never to re-enter it. Yet it was decreed\notherwise. It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left\nfor his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment\nthat his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely\nin his favour. Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at\nthe bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to\nsee him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of\nsomething like a scene. Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,\nand an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do\nanything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable\nto Lord Monmouth in his present mood. As in politics a revolution is\noften followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth\nthe separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his\nmeditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation. He did not\nwish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in\nsome degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.\nHe wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the\nconventional interests of what is called 'the World.' He wanted to hear\nnothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our\ncontracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such\nundue importance. For this purpose he wished to have about him persons\nwhose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of\nexistence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources\nof enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of\nRespectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is\ntermed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the\ncommunity as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient\ncircumstances and disguises, to plunder the public. This was the\nMonmouth Philosophy.\n\nWith these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from\ngrandsons and relations and ties of all kinds. He did not wish to be\nreminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in\nhis Epicurean dream. When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who\nopened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who\nwas so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;\nsaw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices\nof thrilling joyousness,--\n\n'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'\n\nAnd then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of\nelocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his\ncharms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really\nhad not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed\nto the pleasure of the day. The message, which was duly given,\nhowever, settled the business. Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of\nexplanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;\nand to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he\nsaid,\n\n'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'\n\nThere is no end to the influence of woman on our life. It is at the\nbottom of everything that happens to us. And so it was, that, in spite\nof all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr. Rigby, and the mortification\nand resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually\nmade on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a\nmonth had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to\nreceive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.\n\nThe party was agreeable. Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling\nas their eyes. There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of\nVillebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna\nof celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist\nnobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,\ncould tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,\nwhich had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom\nLord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the\nelixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.\nRigby. Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the\nbottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.\n\nIn the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and\nat one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances\nstill more interesting. Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to\nbreathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described\nas meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never\nto encounter each other's glance. The charms of Miss Millbank had\nbecome an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were\ndiscussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season. All admired her,\nmany sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord\nBeaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry\nwhich might have made the boldest despair. As for Coningsby, he passed\nhis life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and\nwas almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally\naccompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,\nindeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less\ninseparable. Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured\nmarriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not\nyet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of\nits ultimate occurrence. She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her\nacquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her\nbrother should marry and be happy. 'But Percy is often in love,' she\nwould add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.\nHe thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may\ncompromise his heroic character. However,' she added, 'I really believe\nthat will be a match.'\n\nOn the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby\npassed this month in a state of restless misery. His soul was brooding\non one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell\nthat impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and\nthe circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently\nmentioned. Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his\ndesolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,\napparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the\ndarkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.\n\nHe had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,\nthough never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief. There seemed\nto be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject\nfruitful in painful reminiscences.\n\nThe season waned. In the fulfilment of a project originally formed\nin the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and\ncherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early\nyouth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some\nmoors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town\nfor Scotland. They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,\nwho in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,\nhad surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague\nmention that he rather thought he should go abroad.\n\nIt was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast\ngiven, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks\nof the Thames, by Lady Everingham. The weather was as bright as the\nromances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls\ncolossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the\nair with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on\nturf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering\nshades of winding walks.\n\n'My f\u00c3\u00aate was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.\n'I am glad it is connected with an incident. It gives it a point.'\n\n'You are mystical as well as prophetic. Tell me what we are to\ncelebrate.'\n\n'Theresa is going to be married.'\n\n'Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace\nLyle.'\n\n'You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps\nbecause I was thinking too much of some one else.'\n\n'It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect. I hardly\nknow which I love best. I have had my suspicions a long time; and when\nEustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was\nconvinced.'\n\n'At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling\nface, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr. Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished\nto have been more.'\n\n'Were those your thoughts, dear lady? Ever kind to me! Happiness,' he\nadded, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.'\n\n'And why?'\n\n'Ah! 'tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,\nwe must all determine to be happy.'\n\n'You have already made me miserable.'\n\n'Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he\nmoved on. Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.\nMelton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party. They seemed profuse\nin their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the\nintelligence from her brother.\n\nConingsby stopped to speak to Lady St. Julians, who had still a daughter\nto marry. Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara\nIsabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.\nBut Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St. Julians had a great\nregard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the\ninfluential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst. In case\nConingsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might\ncounsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable\nact.\n\n'Strawberries and cream?' said Lord Eskdale to Mr. Ormsby, who seemed\noccupied with some delicacies.\n\n'Egad! no, no, no; those days are passed. I think there is a little\neasterly wind with all this fine appearance.'\n\n'I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale. 'Do you know, I do\nnot half like the way Monmouth is going on? He never gets out of that\nvilla of his. He should change his air more. Tell him.'\n\n'It is no use telling him anything. Have you heard anything of Miladi?'\n\n'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits. I am sorry\nit broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.'\n\n'I gave them two years,' said Mr. Ormsby. 'Lord Monmouth lived with his\nfirst wife two years. And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at\nleast nearly two years; it was a year and ten months. I must know,\nfor he called me in to settle affairs. I took the lady to the baths at\nLucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there. He went to\nParis. All his great affairs have been two years. I remember I wanted\nto bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being\nhis intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his\ntrustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.'\n\n'You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and\nthen there never would have been a separation.'\n\n'Hah, hah, hah! Do you know, I feel the wind?'\n\nAbout an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,\nmet, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting. Coningsby\nwas about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped\nand would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the f\u00c3\u00aate,\nbut yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her. Mrs.\nGuy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer. Lady\nWallinger followed with Coningsby.\n\n'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'\nsaid Lady Wallinger.\n\n'Indeed!' said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it. And it\nseems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every\none must approve.'\n\n'Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'\n\n'Ah! Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to\nobserve obvious circumstances.'\n\n'Do you know, Mr. Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to\nLady Theresa?'\n\n'I!'\n\n'Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively\ngoing to be married to her.'\n\n'I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such\nrapidity, Lady Wallinger.'\n\nLady Wallinger looked distressed. 'You remember our meeting you on the\nstairs at ---- House, Mr. Coningsby?'\n\n'Painfully. It is deeply graven on my brain.'\n\n'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady\nTheresa.'\n\n'Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?' said\nConingsby, reddening.\n\n'I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one. Lord\nBeaumanoir admires her, has always admired her. But Edith has given\nhim no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she\nbelieved; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr. Coningsby? I\nam to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it\ncruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.'\n\n'You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most\namiable and admirable of women. But tell me, is it indeed true that\nEdith is not going to be married?'\n\nAt this moment Mrs. Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady\nWallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point\nto her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply\ninteresting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with\nbecoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of\nexaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby\nwalked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady\nWallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure. At the end\nof the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the\nmultitude that thronged the lawn.\n\n'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,\nand saw Edith on his arm. They were unconsciously approaching them. Lord\nBeaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before\nBuckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing\nthat no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was\nimpelled by his talent for action to enter the lists. He had talked down\neverybody, unhorsed every cavalier. Nobody had a chance against him:\nhe answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted\neverybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by\nhistoriettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a\njoke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe\nMiller. He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,\nrattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits. Edith was\nextremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual\nexcesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.\n\nThe eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so\ncruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House. A deep, quick blush\nsuffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly\nand quickly she put forth her hand.\n\nYes! he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the\npassion of his life, yet which may never be his! It seemed that for the\nravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness\nall the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since\nhe embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by\nthe waters of the rushing Darl.\n\nHe seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her\nside, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.\n\n'Forgive me!' she said.\n\n'Ah! how could you ever doubt me?' said Coningsby.\n\n'I was unhappy.'\n\n'And now we are to each other as before?'\n\n'And will be, come what come may.'\n\nEND OF BOOK VIII.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IX.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was merry Christmas at St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve. There was a yule log blazing\non every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the\npeasant's roof. The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon\nto sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much\nbold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in\na basket with one hand. For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of\nbroadcloth for every man. All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm\nraiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and\ndispensing cheer. For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace\nLyle.\n\nWithin his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride\nwelcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of\nthe house. All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes\nthe season, at once sacred and merry. There are carols for the eventful\neve, and mummers for the festive day.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this\nyear to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple. Coningsby,\ntoo, was there, and all his friends. The party was numerous, gay,\nhearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.\n\nThey were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of\nMisrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had\nbeen his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.\nTheir host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old\nobservances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas\nhad diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in\nfavour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of\nthe material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must\ninevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate\ntheir condition; that their condition is not merely 'a knife and fork\nquestion,' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian\nschool; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our\nnature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart\nas well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to\nelevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.\n\nThere is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition. An\nindefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been\none of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton. Yet a\nschoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of\ntheir cottage economy. As he advanced in life the horizon of his views\nexpanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of\nthe noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with\nfatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his\ntime and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the\nelevation of the condition of the great body of the people.\n\n'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will\nbe content with being his gentleman usher.'\n\n'It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.\n\n'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.\n\n'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about\nto commence. And what is your will?'\n\n'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst. 'I\nvote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and\nBeau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.\nDuke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman. She is to\nwalk before me, and scatter rosemary. Coningsby shall carry the Boar's\nhead; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord\nEveringham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who\nare found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy\nLand, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse. Some must carry cups of\nHippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'\n\nHe ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into\neffect. Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies\nin robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour\nfrom the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved\nancient banners. They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,\nand Coningsby raised it aloft. They formed into procession, the Duchess\ndistributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of\nTamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;\nand the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the\ncanticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:\n\n  I.\n        Caput Apri defero\n        Reddens laudes Domino.\n  The Boar's heade in hande bring I,\n  With garlandes gay and rosemary:\n  I pray you all singe merrily,\n        Qui estis in convivio.\n\n  II.\n        Caput Apri defero\n        Reddens laudes Domino.\n  The Boar's heade I understande\n  Is the chief servyce in this lande\n  Loke whereever it be fande,\n        Servite cum cantico.\n\nThe procession thrice paraded the hall. Then they stopped; and the Lord\nof Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him\nin circle. Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their\nglittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the\nBoar's head covered with garlands. It was a good picture, and the Lord\nof Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy. He was addressing\nhis court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant\napproached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.\n\nOur hero retired unperceived. A despatch had arrived for him from\nLondon. Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke\nthe seal with a trembling hand. His presence was immediately desired in\ntown: Lord Monmouth was dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThis was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical\nepochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware\nof its character. The first feeling which he experienced at the\nintelligence was sincere affliction. He was fond of his grandfather; had\nreceived great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was\nmost welcome. The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of\nleaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their\nauthor, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly\nsensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his\nhappy youth.\n\nThe next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable\nspeculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes. Lord\nMonmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for\nhim as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner\nwhich ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman. The\nallowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually\naccorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in\nestimating his future patrimony as extremely ample. He was aware,\nindeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for\nhim fortunes of a still more elevated character. He looked to Coningsby\nas the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been\npurchasing territory with the view of supporting the title. But\nConingsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being\nrealised. He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his\ngrandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the\nmoment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's\ncommunication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;\nand he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's\nhabits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to\nresume before his decease the completion of these plans. Indeed there\nwas a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect\nto Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the\nlarge fortune which was to accompany the barony. Had not a separation\nbetween Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with\nConingsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the\nconsequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but\nthe absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent\nremoval, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not\nformal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his\nmemory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the\ntime to shut his eyes. Before he left town for Scotland he had made a\nfarewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in\nold days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the\nmoors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals\nto write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom. On\nthe whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational\neffort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden\nevent might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly\nposition, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the\naffliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at\nall events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,\nand her love.\n\nAlthough he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet\nreconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never\nlong without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the\ncorrespondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they\nwere at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had\nterminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had\nquitted London.\n\nIt was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at\nonce on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he\npersuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.\n\n'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I\nremember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'\n\nLord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord\nMonmouth's property. He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was\nhis grandfather's principal heir.\n\n'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?' said\nLord Eskdale. 'It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with\nwhat you do with it; very often not yourself. To maintain an equable\nexpenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,\nis an art. There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which\nvery few men have. Great wealth wearies. The thing to have is about ten\nthousand a year, and the world to think you have only five. There is\nsome enjoyment then; one is let alone. But the instant you have a large\nfortune, duties commence. And then impudent fellows borrow your money;\nand if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a\nscrew.'\n\nLord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly\nhe never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those\nwho were amusing. He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his\nlips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked\nClotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that\nservice. When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was\ntoo late. The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were\nin despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of\nplundering the house. Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived\nin time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.\n\nThe body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed\nand laid in state. The funeral was not numerously attended. There was\nnobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from\nthe country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.\nAfter the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of\nMonmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the\nboyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and\nnow hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.\n\nThe testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,\nthough the names of his executors had been announced by his family\nsolicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.\nThe executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr. Ormsby, and Mr.\nRigby. By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added. All these\nindividuals were now present. Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,\nstood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long\ntable, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the\nfuneral, including several of the superior members of the household,\namong them M. Villebecque.\n\nThe solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in\nthe habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original\nwill, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was\ntherefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument. So saying,\nhe sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the\nwill of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained\nin his custody since its execution.\n\nBy this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to\nConingsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr. Rigby.\nThere was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of\nthem of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women\nin various countries. There was an almost inconceivable number of small\nannuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.\nThe residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of\nwhom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,\nhad lapsed. The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the\nterms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr. Rigby.\n\nThere followed several codicils which did not materially affect the\nprevious disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to\nthe Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year\n1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to\nConingsby to 50,000_l._.\n\nAfter Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change\noccurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate. The legacy of\n50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the\nPrincess Lucretia. A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr. Rigby; and\nConingsby was left sole residuary legatee.\n\nThe marriage led to a considerable modification. An estate of about\nnine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was\ntherefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby. The legacy to\nMr. Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left\nto his issue by Lady Monmouth. In case he died without issue, the estate\nbequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then\nto be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson. It was\nunder this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and\nto whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of\nthe Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it. To Lord\nEskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr. Ormsby his rare\nand splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his\nTokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this\nlegacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct\nabout the Irish corporations.\n\nThe solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.\nWhile this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the\nroom, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity\nof the lawyer. Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit. Mr. Rigby\nwas pale and restless, but said nothing. Mr. Ormsby took a pinch of\nsnuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him. They\nexchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather. Sidonia\nstood apart, with his arms folded. He had not, of course attended the\nfuneral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.\n\n'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'\n\nThey came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley. This\nappeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while\nConingsby's reached to the culminating point. Mr. Rigby was reduced to\nhis original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount\nwas bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful\nservices; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,\nand she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,\nunder the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was\nleft absolutely to Coningsby.\n\nA subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr. Rigby\nshould be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some\ncompensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby\nthe bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his\nLordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule\nat Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's\ndecease Mr. Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other\nfriend.\n\nLord Eskdale and Mr. Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr. Rigby.\nAs for Coningsby, he saw nobody. He maintained, during the extraordinary\nsituation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and\nregulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really\nstrung to a high pitch.\n\nThere was yet another codicil. It bore the date of June 1840, and was\nmade at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.\nIt was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great\nemergency. He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all\nright. He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed\nof, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,\nsecured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what\nhad occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer. And then to whom\ncould Lord Monmouth leave his money? However he might cut and carve up\nhis fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served\nhim, must come in for a considerable slice.\n\nHis prescient mind was right. All the dispositions in favour of 'my\ngrandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his\ngrandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been\noriginally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood. The executors had\nthe power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper\nfor his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the\ncapital stock of any manufactory.'\n\nConingsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye\nof Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious\ncountenance. What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was\nthought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that\nreveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.\nThere was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle\nthese conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his\nyouth and health, and knowledge and convictions. Even the recollection\nof Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations. At\nleast the mightiest foe to their union was departed.\n\nAll this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading\nof the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the\nMarquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;\nand all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,\nwheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a\nmillion sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly\ncalled Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,\n'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at\nthe Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n'This is a crash!' said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated\ncountenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,\nhowever, any expression of condolence.\n\n'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.\n\nConingsby shrugged his shoulders.\n\n'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,\n'is the condolence of the gentle world. I think we may now depart. I am\ngoing home to dine. Come, and discuss your position. For the present we\nwill not speak of it.' So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby\nout of the room.\n\nThey walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of\nthem making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring\nwhere he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and\nhimself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling\nin his manner than was his custom. When they had arrived there, Sidonia\nordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the\ncommand and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old\nGerman painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint\ncostumes.\n\n'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed\nConingsby somewhat reluctant. 'Take some of that Chablis: it will put\nyou right; you will find it delicious.'\n\nIn this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they\nwere alone together.\n\n'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.\n\n'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.\n\n'I really cannot see that,' said his friend. 'You have experienced this\nmorning a disappointment, but not a calamity. If you had lost your eye\nit would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could\nhave given you another. There are really no miseries except natural\nmiseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions. What seems\nconventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently\nviewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.'\n\n'I hope the day may come when I may feel this.'\n\n'Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is\nthe moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which\nsurround you. Holiday philosophy is mere idleness. You think, for\nexample, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you\nhave lost the fortune on which you counted?'\n\n'I must say I do.'\n\n'I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's\ninheritance or your right leg?'\n\n'Most certainly my inheritance,'\n\n'Or your left arm?'\n\n'Still the inheritance.'\n\n'Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front\nteeth should be knocked out?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?'\n\n'Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.'\n\n'Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.'\n\n'Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is\nnot so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost\neverything.'\n\n'You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer\nto the fortune that you have forfeited. How then can you be said to have\nlost everything?'\n\n'What have I?' said Coningsby, despondingly.\n\n'You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable\nknowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible\nexperience. With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the\ncombination ought to command the highest.'\n\n'You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter\nsmile.\n\n'I teach you the truth. That is always solacing. I think you are a most\nfortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if\nyou had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so. But I wish you\nto comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to\nlament.'\n\n'But what should I do?'\n\n'Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object. I make you no\noffers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed\nI have no wish to see you a lounger in life. If you had inherited a\ngreat patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous\nculture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a\nquestion, even with you. Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,\nif you are not in debt. A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is\nharassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,\ncannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can. You have nothing to haunt\nyour thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies. You have seen\nthe most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what\nheroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on\nyour memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and\ninteresting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the\ncause of what are called scrapes. But you can do nothing if you be in\ndebt. You must be free. Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you\nto be frank on this head. If you have any absolute or contingent\nincumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear\nthem at once to any amount. You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:\nbecause I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start\nwith a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.'\n\n'You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay\nthem. I have nothing of the kind. My grandfather was so lavish in his\nallowance to me that I never got into difficulties. Besides, there\nare horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at\nDrummonds'.'\n\n'That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt. I\nconceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration. In the\nfirst place there is Diplomacy. If you decide upon that, I can assist\nyou. There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can\nat once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.\nAfter that, much, if not all, depends on yourself. But I could advance\nyou, provided you were capable. You should, at least, not languish for\nwant of preferment. In an important post, I could throw in your way\nadvantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets. Information\ncommands the world. I doubt not your success, and for such a career,\nspeedy. Let us assume it as a fact. Is it a result satisfactory? Suppose\nyourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at\na critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate\nperspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.\nWould that satisfy you? You don't look excited. I am hardly surprised.\nIn your position it would not satisfy me. A Diplomatist is, after all,\na phantom. There is a want of nationality about his being. I always look\nupon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political\ncreeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which\npervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.'\n\n'You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby. 'I should be sorry to sever\nmyself from England.'\n\n'There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said\nSidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar. I am absolutely\npersuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,\nsuccess at the Bar is certain. It may be retarded or precipitated by\ncircumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected. You have a right to\ncount with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe\nfor them. You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the\nBar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for\nthe reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your\nexperience.'\n\n'I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nAlone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of\nSidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending\nand bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit\nevaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank. All now depended on himself,\nand in that self he had no trust. Why should he succeed? Success was the\nmost rare of results. Thousands fail; units triumph. And even success\ncould only be conducted to him by the course of many years. His career,\neven if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which\nthe heart of man could be called upon to sustain. Upon the stern altar\nof his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love. Before,\nhe had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none. The future\nmight then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve\nhis present. Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and\nstudies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena\nmust pass years of silent and obscure preparation. 'Twas very bitter.\nHe looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley\nwhich she had given him in the days of their happy hearts. That was all\nthat was to remain of their loves. He was to bear it to the future\nscene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and\nroutine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,\nand whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion. That drawing\nwas to become the altar-piece of his life.\n\nConingsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a\nconsciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an\nindefinite conception of its nature. He woke exhausted and dispirited.\nIt was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of\nthe Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his\nbreakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's\nwill, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him. What\na contrast to St. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve! To the bright, bracing morn of that merry\nChristmas! That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and\nbeaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the\none he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune. The\nGreat Seal indeed! It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied\nhope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have\ninspired such a hallucination! His unstrung heart deserted him. His\nenergies could rally no more. He gave orders that he was at home to no\none; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the\nfireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered\nhimself up to despair.\n\nThe day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie. Nothing rose\nto his consciousness. He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,\na glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades. Towards evening the wind\nchanged, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and\nbright. Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around\nhim, sallied forth. Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by\nmillions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper\nposition. Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation\nto the rest. 'Tis the secret of all wisdom. Here was the mightiest of\nmodern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.\nWhether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing\nthrong? They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his\ncomfort. But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed\nat the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might\ninfluence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect\ntheir destiny. Nothing is great but the personal. As civilisation\nadvances, the accidents of life become each day less important.\nThe power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential\nqualities. Brains every day become more precious than blood. You must\ngive men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify\ntheir manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,\nsubvert convictions, if you wish to be great. Greatness no longer\ndepends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world\nis too knowing.\n\n'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my\ngenius shall conquer its greatness.'\n\nThis conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of\nintrinsic strength. It is indeed the test of a creative spirit. From\nthat moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him. He felt\nthat he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;\nthat there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,\nstruggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty\nhostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the\nwelcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be\nre-echoed.\n\nHe returned to his rooms; calm, resolute. He slept the deep sleep of\na man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his\nvisions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great\nhuman struggle.\n\nAnd the morning came. Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet\ndetermined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already\nresolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit\nto some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his\nservant brought him a note. The handwriting was feminine. The note was\nfrom Flora. The contents were brief. She begged Mr. Coningsby, with\ngreat earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on\nher at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she\nnow resided.\n\nIt was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it\nseemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor\nmanly, to refuse her request. Flora had not injured him. She was, after\nall, his kin. Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of\nher lot? He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.\n\nIn an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first\nmeeting was held under circumstances most strangely different. Then\nConingsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being\nobscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.\nHis favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the\nchosen relative of a powerful noble. That noble was no more; his vast\ninheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,\nwhose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune\nhad risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all\nhis aspirations.\n\nFlora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room. The extreme\ndelicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and\nseated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an\neffort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate\nand prosperous heiress.\n\n'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.\n\nConingsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed\nher own, looking down much embarrassed.\n\n'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break\nthe first awkwardness of their meeting.\n\n'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?'\n\n'You are going abroad?'\n\n'No; I hope never to leave England!'\n\nThere was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,\n\n'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I\nmust speak. You think I have injured you?'\n\n'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you\ncould injure no one.'\n\n'I have robbed you of your inheritance.'\n\n'It was not mine by any right, legal or moral. There were others who\nmight have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now\nthink that you might have preferred a superior one.'\n\n'You had enemies; I was not one. They sought to benefit themselves by\ninjuring you. They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that\nthey have at least injured you.'\n\n'We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my\nlot.'\n\n'Would that I could mine!' said Flora. She sighed again with a downcast\nglance. Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I\nwish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and\nunwillingly deprived you.'\n\n'The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,\nmuch moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may\ncontribute to your happiness than I do.'\n\n'It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual\nanimation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what\nI feel. This fortune is yours. I am happy in the inheritance, if you\ngenerously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means\nof baffling your enemies. I never thought to be so happy as I shall be\nif you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you. I\nhave lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned\nto you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my\nunhappiness.'\n\n'You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most\ntender-hearted of beings. But you misconceive our mutual positions,\nmy gentle Flora. The custom of the world does not permit such acts to\neither of us as you contemplate. The fortune is yours. It is left you by\none on whose affections you had the highest claim. I will not say\nthat so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming\nresponsibility; but you are not unequal to it. Have confidence in\nyourself. You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a\nwell-principled being. Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and\nblend with them. You will be happy.'\n\n'And you?'\n\n'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other\nsources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no\ntime have secured my felicity.'\n\n'But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking\nin a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby. 'You had\nsome views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may\nbe, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice. Speak to me, for I\ncannot speak, dear Mr. Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who\nwould sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such\ncalamities!'\n\n'Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a\ncheek of scarlet.\n\n'Ah! he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!' and\nthe tears stole down her pale cheek.\n\n'No, no, no! dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of\naffection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair\nnearer to her, and took her hand. 'I am gratified by these kind wishes,\nthough they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of\nyour sweet disposition and your noble spirit. There never shall exist\nbetween us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin\nand kindness.'\n\nHe rose as if to depart. When she saw that, she started, and seemed to\nsummon all her energies.\n\n'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said\nnothing; and I shall never see you again. Let me tell you what I mean.\nThis fortune is yours; it must be yours. It is an arrow in my heart. Do\nnot think I am speaking from a momentary impulse. I know myself. I have\nlived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,\nthat I know myself. If you will not let me do justice you declare my\ndoom. I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects\nbeing blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated. When\nI die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent. Refuse my\npresent offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile\nlife has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.'\n\n'You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these\ngloomy feelings. You must live, and you must live happily. You have\nevery charm and virtue which should secure happiness. The duties and\nthe affections of existence will fall to your lot. It is one that will\nalways interest me, for I shall ever be your friend. You have conferred\non me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I\nbless you. I will soon see you again.' Mournfully he bade her farewell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nAbout a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning\nwas about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the\nTemple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a\nbustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.\n\nThere never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his\nfriends were serious. The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had\ncirculated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a\nbrief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions. Immediately they\ncame up to town. Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but\nsympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the\nbar, so that they should not be divided. Buckhurst, after many embraces\nand some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,\nI have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still\nthese are subjects which men like to be discussed in private. Of course\nI expect you to share my fortune. There is enough for both. We will have\nan exact division.'\n\nThere was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a\nlittle humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature\nand life. If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby\nwould share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he\npressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed\nto contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,\nwith our present manners, impossible.\n\n'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with\nyou. The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune\nis a bore. What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of\nready-money, and enter the Austrian service. By Jove! it is the only\nthing to do.'\n\n'There is something in that,' said Coningsby. 'In the meantime, suppose\nyou two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to\nlook at some chambers.'\n\nIt was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk. Though the\ntwo friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and\nmiserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding\nlittle difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their\nhabitual tone. As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which\nhe visited for the first time. The name enchanted him. The tombs in the\nchurch convinced him that the Crusades were the only career. He would\nhave himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his\nstudies in chain armour. The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the\nmisfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion\nof his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that\nmaintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much\nof the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.\nHenry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of\nConingsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to\nmake him a Lord Chancellor.\n\nThese faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was\nestablished in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated\nspecial pleader. They would have remained longer had not he himself\nsuggested that it was better that they should part. It seemed a terrible\ncatastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college\ndreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.\n\n'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all\nloved, that was to be our leader!' said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as\nthey quitted him. 'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its\nbloom.'\n\n'The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of\nour friendship. We must write to him very often, and contrive to be\nfrequently together. It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life\nour hearts may become estranged. I never felt more wretched than I do at\nthis moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'\n\n'Amen!' said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service\nwas, after all, the only thing. The Continent offers a career. He might\nhave been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,\nlook at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others. I had a much\nbetter chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord\nChancellor.'\n\n'I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said\nHenry Sydney, gravely.\n\nThis change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution. It was\nsudden and complete. Within a month after the death of his grandfather\nhis name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses\nand carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple. He\nentirely devoted himself to his new pursuit. His being was completely\nabsorbed in it. There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced\nscene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence. One sacred\nthought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary\nof his heart and consciousness. But it was a tradition, no longer a\nhope. The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of\nhis grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to\nhimself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated\nunreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions\nto the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.\n\nHis letter was answered in person. Millbank met Henry Sydney and\nBuckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby. Once more they were all\nfour together; but under what different circumstances, and with what\ndifferent prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!\nAlone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could\nnot convey. He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but\nthey would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the\npresent state of affairs, all was hopeless. In no way did Coningsby ever\npermit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance. He\nwas, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication\nof the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his\ninmost soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered\na most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated\nin the first chapter of this work. The banners of the Conservative camp\nat this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the\nNorman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex. The Whigs were not\nyet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it. The\nmistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining\noffice in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national\nand constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and\nparty prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into\nthe corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the\nsuperficial could mistake for vitality. Even to form a basis for their\nfuture operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged\nto make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility\nof which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm. It was\nclear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.\n\nUnder all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig\nCabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient\neither in boldness or prudence. The policy which they recommended was\nin itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing\nthat, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the\nWhigs could have obtained general favour in the country. The Whigs were\nknown to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters. The country\nknew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly\nnever was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that\nthat powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their\nview a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,\ninstead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and\na creed.\n\nThe future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be\ndetrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated\npiecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative\nsuccessors. But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig\nparty found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more\nconducive to their precipitate fall. Great interests were menaced by a\nweak government. The consequence was inevitable. Tadpole and Taper\nsaw it in a moment. They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming\nstorm. Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,\nthere was a little latent jealousy between them. Tadpole worshipped\nRegistration: Taper, adored a Cry. Tadpole always maintained that it\nwas the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;\nTaper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of\nopinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour. It\nalways seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be\npopular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders\nnot being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off\nagainst the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the\nTadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had\nhad his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively\nagainst the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl\na much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued\nParliament.\n\nAnd now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right. There was\na great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs\nand in favour of Conservative principles. What Canadian timber-merchants\nmeant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;\nor West Indian planters. It was tolerably clear on the hustings\nwhat squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative\nprinciples. What they mean by Conservative principles now is another\nquestion: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than\na perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of\nthem important. But no matter what different bodies of men understood by\nthe cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed. Taper beat Tadpole;\nand the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.\n\nNotwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could\nnot be altogether insensible to the political crisis. In the political\nworld of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were\ndeeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which\nhe would permit them, of cultivating his society. Their occasional\nfellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes\non Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations. His\ngeneral acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and\ndid not wish to be remembered. Mr. Ormsby asked him to dinner, and\noccasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while\nLord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his\nprogress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called\nto the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam. Coningsby\nhad once met Mr. Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,\nwhich was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer. Mr. Rigby\ncut Coningsby.\n\nLord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the\ncause of Coningsby being disinherited. Our hero, if one in such fallen\nfortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale\nhis sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord\nEskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had\nreason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have\nbeen different. He had altered the disposition of his property at a\nmoment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too\nindolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to\nacknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement. Lord\nEskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about\nthe refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr. Millbank; the\ncommunication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald\nMillbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all\nthese details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly\ntransferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he\nhad sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with\nthe whole history.\n\nThe dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of\nwhich had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody\nbelieved to the last moment, at length took place. All the world was\ndispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the\nTemple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found\nhis eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered\nthat the great event to which he had so looked forward was now\noccurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama. It was\nto have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself\nin that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and\nhigher impulses of his nature had been preparing him. It was a keen\ntrial of a man. Every one of his friends and old companions were\ncandidates, and with sanguine prospects. Lord Henry was certain for a\ndivision of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural\nborough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for\na Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an\nimportant manufacturing constituency. They sent their addresses to\nConingsby. He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence\nof his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he\nhad habituated them. Amid the confusion of a general election, no\nunimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to\nan isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements\nof political parties might have detected in these public declarations\nsome intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that\nhas unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this\ncountry.\n\nIt was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting\ndown Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors\nof the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express\narrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.\nConingsby was walking up Pall Mall. He was going to dine at the Oxford\nand Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his\nname, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or\nCambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former\nfashionable acquaintances. He lighted in his walk on Mr. Tadpole and\nMr. Taper, both of whom he knew. The latter did not notice him, but Mr.\nTadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by\na slight expression of coarse pity.\n\nConingsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where\nhe learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst\ndenouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several\nthousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown\ndanger, now first introduced to their notice. Being true Englishmen,\nthey were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian\nparty, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.\n\nConingsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter\nbrought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins\nfrom the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour. Some large\nletters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye. There\nseemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had\nhappened. The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair! Withdrawal of\nthe Liberal Candidate! Two Tory Candidates in the field!!!'\n\nHis eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr. Millbank, his\ncountenance changed, his heart palpitated. Mr. Millbank had resigned\nthe representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations\ndemanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his\nplace, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a\ndeep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the\nlink between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud\ncheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should\nconciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious\ncontentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative. For\nthese reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a\nname which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the\nindividual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his\ntalents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with\nthe district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their\nconfidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.\n\nThis proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which\noccasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities. The contest\nbetween Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was\nover-confident. The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in\nbehalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no\nConingsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,\nand he was a beaten horse. The Liberals did not like the prospect of a\ndefeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph. The Moderate\nmen, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the\nname of Coningsby. Mr. Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading\nsupporters for the substitution. Some traits of the character and\nconduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated. Thus there was a\ncombination of many favourable causes in his favour. In half an hour's\ntime his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the\nborough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,\nand who deserved to be rewarded. It was whispered that Rigby was his\nenemy. Magog Wrath and his mob offered Mr. Millbank's committee to throw\nMr. Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was\nprudent enough not to show. Mr. Rigby determined to fight to the last.\nAll his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.\nIt were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him\nhigh office. The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted\nto this end. The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr. Rigby in vain\nattempting to address an infuriated populace.\n\nHere was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby! When his\ngrandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was\nnot verging on greater vicissitudes. He rose from his seat, and was\nsurprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark\nhis agitation. Not an individual there that he knew. It was now an hour\nto midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to\nthe poll. In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his\nchambers. He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had\nbeen twice at the Temple. Oswald had been returned without a contest,\nand had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated. He set off\ninstantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative\nof what had happened, with information that he should call on him\nagain on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together\nimmediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one\nentertained a doubt of his triumph.\n\nConingsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early\nfelt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous. He\nfelt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had\nbeen despaired of. At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event\nhad occurred which seemed to restore all. He dared not contemplate the\nultimate result of all these wonderful changes. Enough for him, that\nwhen all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by\nthe father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust\nbefore him was the author of all his misfortunes. Love, Vengeance,\nJustice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant\nsense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from\nwhich order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming\nfeeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected\nhim.\n\nThere was a knock at the door. It was Oswald. They embraced. It seemed\nthat Oswald was as excited as Coningsby. His eye sparkled, his manner\nwas energetic.\n\n'We must talk it all over during our journey. We have not a minute to\nspare.'\n\nDuring that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs\nwhich gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his\nfavour. We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of\nthe circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance\nof Coningsby. These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,\nafterwards in more detail on her arrival in London. Lady Wallinger had\nconferred with her husband. She was not surprised at the goodness of\nConingsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities. He had ever been\nthe favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in\nblending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith. Sir Joseph was a\njudicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but\ngood, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid\nof them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the\nright direction. They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's\nadmirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband\nshould express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison\nwith herself. Sir Joseph spoke to Mr. Millbank, who stared; but Sir\nJoseph spoke feebly. Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and\nall her impressions, to Oswald and Edith. The younger Millbank talked\nwith his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,\ninveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.\n\nAfter some time, Mr. Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an\ninterest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he\nwas called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince\ntheir sincerity. Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought\nthat circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on\nthe subject. The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had\nnecessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his\nfather. When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his\nparent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling\nafter all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining\nin a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to\nask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and\nsupernatural skill? He addressed his father with that irresistible\nfrankness which a strong faith can alone inspire. What are the objects\nof wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts? The only\ndaughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,\nhere are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are\nunhappy. Mr. Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already\nconvinced. But he felt some interest in the present conduct of\nConingsby. A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for\nhim. He wished to be assured of its authenticity. He was resolved to\nconvince himself of the fact. And perhaps he would have gone on yet\nfor a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,\nalready interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the\ndissolution brought affairs to a crisis. The misery of Oswald at the\nposition of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,\nwhich assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take\nthis young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr. Millbank, who\nwas after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided\nrightly. Never making a single admission to all the representations of\nhis son, Mr. Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared\nto desire.\n\nThis is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred\nat Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the\nenchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their\nrapid travel. When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger\nand a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he\nwas at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.\nRigby had resigned. He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,\nas they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so\nhe was to arrive there in the morning. At Birmingham, therefore, they\nremained.\n\nThere was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's. They had\nhardly had time for this. Now they were both Members of Parliament.\nMen must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting\nthus, and realising boyish dreams. Often, years ago, they had talked\nof these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and\ndreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in\nthe freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby\nwere members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible\nagents, with a career.\n\nThis afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually\nfalls to the lot of man. Both of these companions were labouring under\nthat degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity. They had\nenough to talk about. Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful\nsubject. There was rapture in their again meeting under such\ncircumstances. Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who\nhad just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all\ntheir companions of early days. What a sudden and marvellous change in\nall their destinies! Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it\nseemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,\nsprings of the great machine.\n\nA train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the\ndispersion of the passengers. Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,\na little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with\nwhich one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,\nwere lounging on the platform. The train arrived; stopped; the doors\nwere thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr. Rigby! Coningsby, who\nhad dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,\nbut he refrained. Their eyes met. Rigby was dead beat. He was evidently\nused up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;\nhe had met his fate.\n\n'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with\nmy grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you. Such is\nlife!'\n\nAbout eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford\nstation. Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received\nConingsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered\nwith satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,\ncaparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips\nwere blue and white. Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the\nmultitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,\nfell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest\ncorner. Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,\ntrumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving\nfrom every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens\nbedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic\nDarlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon. Uncovered, still\nin deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his\nintelligent brow, at once won every female heart.\n\nThe singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody\ncheered him, every house was adorned with his colours. His triumphal\nreturn was no party question. Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked\ntogether like lambs at the head of his procession.\n\nThe car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street. It was\nMr. Millbank's committee. The broad street was so crowded, that, as\nevery one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.\nEvery window was full; the very roofs were peopled. The car stopped,\nand the populace gave three cheers for Mr. Millbank. Their late member,\nsurrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up\nwith Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic\nletters formed of dahlias. The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby\ncaught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.\n\nThe hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby\nwas carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,\nfor the first time, a public assembly. Anxious as the people were\nto hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into\nsilence. At length that silence was deep and absolute. He spoke; his\npowerful and rich tones reached every ear. In five minutes' time every\none looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there\nnever was anything like this heard in Darlford before.\n\nHe addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to\nsay; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in\nwhich he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which\nthey had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition\nof the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly\nchosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.\n\nHe did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and\npopular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered. His\nlively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment. But when,\ntowards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the\ncharacter of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast\nthrong was singularly affected. There were a great many present at that\nmoment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly\nhave then died for him. Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had\nspoken from his own. His spirit had entirely magnetised them. Darlford\nbelieved in Coningsby: and a very good creed.\n\nAnd now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel. He walked through\nthe crowd. The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands\nwith him. His friends, however, at last safely landed him. He sprang\nup the stairs; he was met by Mr. Millbank, who welcomed him with the\ngreatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.\n\n'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said\nConingsby.\n\n'No,' said Mr. Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great\ntalents, and good heart.'\n\nAfter he had been presented by the late member to the principal\npersonages in the borough, Mr. Millbank said,\n\n'I think we must now give Mr. Coningsby a little rest. Come with me,' he\nadded, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'\n\nSpeaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in\nConingsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment. There\nwas Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love. Their agitated\nhearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy. The father joined their\nhands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThe marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.\nIt was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at\nHellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member\nfor Darlford. The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of\nMr. Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted\nthe newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its\noccupants. All these settlements, as Mr. Millbank assured Coningsby,\nwere effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,\nof his son.\n\nAn event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of\nConingsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no\nlonger necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.\nThe gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with\nwhich her spirit had never greatly sympathised. Perhaps she might have\nlingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal\ninheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting\nher heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious\ninstrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing\nand encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her\nnature. The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from\nthat day she seemed gradually to decline. She died towards the end\nof the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she\nbequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith. Gratifying\nas it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not\nwithout a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.\nEdith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a\nmonument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.\n\nConingsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful\nand gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart\nand his youth.\n\nThey stand now on the threshold of public life. They are in the leash,\nbut in a moment they will be slipped. What will be their fate? Will they\nmaintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in\nstudy and in solitude, they have embraced? Or will their courage exhaust\nitself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted\nridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the\ntawdry temptations of a low ambition? Will their skilled intelligence\nsubside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party? Will Vanity\nconfound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies? Or will\nthey remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and\nworship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise\nthe greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened\nworld the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed\nthe individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by\nbelieving in their own energies, and daring to be great?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Coningsby, by Benjamin Disraeli\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CONINGSBY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7412-8.txt or 7412-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/7\/4\/1\/7412\/\n\nProduced by Anne Soulard, Tiffany Vergon, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1038,"split":"train"}
