{"ori_id":"a8771e0706c5b98b55c60b8dc3b9668295315712","title":"Interstellar (film)","context":"Interstellar (film)\n In a futuristic 21st-century era, crop blight on Earth has made farming increasingly difficult and threatens humanity's survival. Joseph Cooper (McConaughey), a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son, and daughter Murphy, who believes her bedroom is haunted by a poltergeist. When a pattern is created out of dust on the floor, Cooper realizes that gravity is behind its formation, not a \"ghost\". He interprets the pattern as a set of geographic coordinates formed into binary code. Cooper and Murphy follow them to a secret NASA facility, where they are met by Cooper's former professor Dr. Brand (Caine).\nBrand reveals that a wormhole mysteriously appeared near Saturn 48 years earlier, opening a pathway to a distant galaxy with potentially habitable planets. Twelve volunteers traveled through it to assess each planet's suitability as humanity's new home, led by Dr. Mann (Damon). Volunteers Miller, Edmunds and Mann have sent back encouraging data from planets near a black hole called Gargantua. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spaceship Endurance to investigate further, while he works on \"Plan A\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a gravitational theory for propulsion that would allow a mass exodus from Earth. The Endurance also carries 5,000 frozen embryos for the \"Plan B\" backup plan, which is to colonize a habitable planet to ensure humanity's survival. Cooper agrees to go, upsetting Murphy.\nCooper's crew consists of scientists Romilly, Doyle, Brand's daughter Amelia (Hathaway), and robots TARS and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they head to Miller's planet, an ocean world where time is severely dilated because of its proximity to Gargantua; for each hour there, seven years pass on Earth. They find only the wreckage from Miller's expedition. Amelia retrieves Miller's data just before a gigantic tidal wave hits, killing Doyle and water-logging the engines. After returning to Endurance, they discover 23 years have elapsed on Earth.\nMurphy (Chastain), now an adult, has been assisting Dr. Brand with his research. On his deathbed, he admits to her that Plan A was not feasible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he has known since Endurance departed. He reveals that Plan B was the only plan all along. In a recorded video session Murphy notifies Amelia of her father's death, accusing her and Cooper of abandoning Earth. Believing the equations can be solved, she continues working on a solution to Plan A knowing she needs more data on gravitational singularities.\nWith limited fuel, the crew choose Mann's planet over Edmunds' as the next stop, since Mann is still transmitting. Once there, Mann assures the crew that the frozen planet is habitable despite its ammonia-laden atmosphere. Then, while out together surveying the planet, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, revealing that he falsified the data in hopes of being rescued. He steals Cooper's ranger and heads for Endurance. Meanwhile, Romilly is killed by a booby trap set by Mann. Amelia rescues Cooper and they race to Endurance in a second lander, where Mann is attempting a dangerous manual docking operation. Mann ignores Cooper's warnings and is killed in the attempt, severely damaging the Endurance in the process. Cooper uses the lander to stabilize the ship.\nCASE warns Cooper that Endurance is slipping toward Gargantua's pull. Cooper makes a quick decision to use Gargantua as a gravitational slingshot to propel the ship toward Edmunds' planet, but their proximity to Gargantua means more time will elapse on Earth. To shed weight, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves toward the black hole, so that Amelia and CASE can complete the journey. Slipping past the event horizon, Cooper and TARS find themselves inside a tesseract, which resembles a stream of bookshelves capable of peering into Murphy's bedroom at different periods in her life. Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created to enable communication with Murphy, and that he was her \"ghost\" all along. Using the second-hand on the watch he gave her before he left, Cooper relays the quantum data Murphy needs to solve the gravitational equation.\nFollowing a turbulent ejection, Cooper awakens in a space habitat orbiting Saturn. He reunites with an aged Murphy nearing death. At Murphy's request, Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Amelia on Edmunds' habitable planet, where she is preparing a new human colony.\n<html>\n<head><title>Interstellar Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Interstellar script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Interstellar script, Interstellar movie script, Interstellar film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The\n           truth is, most of the fleet's\n           personnel are automated. There are\n           a small number of crewed ships. But\n           there are great numbers of candidates.\n           Very well trained candidates.\n                         \n<b>                          COOPER\n<\/b>           I was hoping to enroll in a course.\n           Try to get myself up to speed on the\n           new systems.\n                         \n<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR\n<\/b>           I don't want you to take this the\n           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I\n           said, you're a hero. But the truth\n           is we have somewhat limited resources.\n                         \n          Cooper remembers this conversation.

He's got a couple centuries on\n          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.\n          He puts his hands in his pockets.\n<b>           151.\n<\/b>                         \n<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           I've got some good news, however.\n<b>                          (BIG SMILE)\n<\/b>           We all know about your early life,\n           Mr Cooper.

A red tractor makes its\n          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.\n                         \n<b>           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)\n<\/b>           The machines do most of the work, of\n           course, but we were able to get you\n           a few acres.

Looks at the front steering linkage, which is\n          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead\n          and begins working the branch out of the machine.\n                         \n          He looks miserable.\n                         \n          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over.

He looks bored.\n                         \n          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher\n          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.\n          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.\n                         \n          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward\n          the town center above.\n                         \n          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a\n          building high above them.\n                         \n          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.\n<b>           152.\n<\/b>                         \n<b>          INT.

The robot is wearing\n          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.\n                         \n          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with\n          a click against the mirror-like floor.\n                         \n          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his\n          finger to his lips.
