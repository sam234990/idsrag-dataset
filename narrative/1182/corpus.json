{"ori_id":"344cddeff8cb90fe176ea9809fd8d3169a7dba34","title":"Uncle Silas","context":"Uncle Silas\n The novel is a first-person narrative told from the point of view of the adolescent girl Maud Ruthyn, an heiress living with her sombre, reclusive father Austin Ruthyn in their mansion at Knowl. Through her father and her worldly, cheerful cousin, Lady Monica Knollys, she gradually learns more regarding her uncle, Silas Ruthyn, a black sheep of the family whom she has never met; once an infamous rake and gambler, he is now apparently a fervently reformed Christian. His reputation has been tainted by the suspicious suicide of a man to whom Silas owed an enormous gambling debt, which took place within a locked, apparently impenetrable room in Silas's mansion at Bartram-Haugh.\nIn the first part of the novel, Maud's father hires a French governess, Madame de la Rougierre, as a companion for her. Madame de la Rougierre terrifies Maud and appears to have designs on her; during two of their walks together, Maud is brought into suspicious contact with strangers that seem to be known to Madame de la Rougierre. (In a cutaway scene that breaks the first-person narrative, we learn that she is in league with Uncle Silas's good-for-nothing son Dudley.) The governess is eventually dismissed when she is discovered by Maud in the act of burgling her father's desk.\nMaud is asked in obscure terms by her father if she is willing to undergo some kind of \"ordeal\" to clear the name of her uncle, and of the family more generally; shortly after she assents, he dies. At the reading of his will, it emerges that her father added a codicil to it: Maud is to stay with Uncle Silas until she comes of age; if she dies whilst still a minor, the estate will pass to Silas. Lady Knollys, together with Austin's executor and fellow Swedenborgian, Dr. Bryerly, attempt in vain to overturn the codicil, realizing its many dangerous implications for the young heiress; despite their efforts, Maud consents willingly to spending the next three and a half years at her uncle's mansion at Bartram-Haugh.\nMaud initially finds life at Bartram-Haugh strange but not unpleasant, despite ominous signs such as the uniformly unfriendly servants and a malevolent factotum of Silas's, the one-legged Dickon Hawkes. Silas himself frightens Maud but is nonetheless seemingly kind to her, in contrast to his treatment of his own children, the loutish Dudley and the uneducated Millicent ('Milly'). Initially deprecating of her rustic mannerisms, Maud and Millicent become best friends, and each other's only source of companionship at the estate. During her stay, Maud is subject to various attempts by Dudley to court her, but she rejects him thoroughly on each occasion. Silas is periodically subject to mysterious catatonic fits, attributed to his massive opium consumption.\nVarious ominous happenings begin to take place at Bartram-Haugh; it becomes increasingly difficult for Maud and Millicent to find any route out of the estate; meanwhile, Dudley's courtship culminates in a marriage proposition to Maud; when she confronts Silas about it, he attempts to coax her into accepting. She is relieved when it emerges that Dudley is already married, and when, after being disowned by his father, he and his wife leave to set sail from Liverpool to New York. It is afterwards decided that Millicent should attend a boarding school in France, and Silas sends her away with the promise that Maud is to join her after three months.\nIn the meantime, Maud is shocked to discover Madame de la Rougierre residing at Bartram-Haugh in the employ of Silas, and she suspects also that Dudley may not have fled. Despite strong protest by Maud, Madame is charged with accompanying her first to London, and then on to Dover and across the Channel. After falling asleep during the journey and being escorted under the cover of darkness, Maud awakes to find herself again at Bartram-Haugh: she had in fact been on a round trip to London and back. Maud finds herself now imprisoned in one of the mansion's many bedrooms under the guard of Madame de la Rougierre, whilst everyone suspects she is in France. Remembering the earlier warnings of her cousin, Lady Knollys, she refuses to drink any of the drugged claret intended for her; instead, Madame de la Rougierre, ignorant of Silas' true intentions, partakes of it and promptly falls asleep on Maud's bed. Later that night, Dudley scales the building and enters the unlit room; the window he uses is set upon concealed hinges that allow it to be opened only from the outside. Hidden out of sight, Maud witnesses Dudley brutally murder Madame de la Rougierre by mistake in the near-darkness. Uncle Silas enters the room, having been waiting outside; as he does this, Maud slips out undetected. Assisted by Dickon Hawkes' daughter, whom Maud had befriended during her stay, she is swiftly conveyed by carriage to Lady Knolly's estate, and away from Bartram-Haugh.\nSilas is discovered in the morning lying dead of an opium overdose, while Dudley becomes a fugitive and is thought to be hiding in Australia. Maud is happily married to the charming and handsome Lord Ilbury and ends her recollections on a philosophical note:\nThis world is a parable\u00e2\u0080\u0094the habitation of symbols\u00e2\u0080\u0094the phantoms of spiritual things immortal shown in material shape.

A leading situation in this\n'Story of Bartram-Haugh' is repeated, with a slight variation, from a short\nmagazine tale of some fifteen pages written by him, and published long ago\nin a periodical under the title of 'A Passage in the Secret History of an\nIrish Countess,' and afterwards, still anonymously, in a small volume under\nan altered title. It is very unlikely that any of his readers should have\nencountered, and still more so that they should remember, this trifle. The\nbare possibility, however, he has ventured to anticipate by this brief\nexplanation, lest he should be charged with plagiarism--always a disrespect\nto a reader.\n\nMay he be permitted a few words also of remonstrance against the\npromiscuous application of the term 'sensation' to that large school of\nfiction which transgresses no one of those canons of construction and\nmorality which, in producing the unapproachable 'Waverley Novels,' their\ngreat author imposed upon himself? No one, it is assumed, would describe\nSir Walter Scott's romances as 'sensation novels;' yet in that marvellous\nseries there is not a single tale in which death, crime, and, in some form,\nmystery, have not a place.\n\nPassing by those grand romances of 'Ivanhoe,' 'Old Mortality,' and\n'Kenilworth,' with their terrible intricacies of crime and bloodshed,\nconstructed with so fine a mastery of the art of exciting suspense and\nhorror, let the reader pick out those two exceptional novels in the series\nwhich profess to paint contemporary manners and the scenes of common life;\nand remembering in the 'Antiquary' the vision in the tapestried chamber,\nthe duel, the horrible secret, and the death of old Elspeth, the drowned\nfisherman, and above all the tremendous situation of the tide-bound party\nunder the cliffs; and in 'St. Ronan's Well,' the long-drawn mystery, the\nsuspicion of insanity, and the catastrophe of suicide;--determine whether\nan epithet which it would be a profanation to apply to the structure of\nany, even the most exciting of Sir Walter Scott's stories, is fairly\napplicable to tales which, though illimitably inferior in execution, yet\nobserve the same limitations of incident, and the same moral aims.\n\nThe author trusts that the Press, to whose masterly criticism and generous\nencouragement he and other humble labourers in the art owe so much, will\ninsist upon the limitation of that degrading term to the peculiar type of\nfiction which it was originally intended to indicate, and prevent, as they\nmay, its being made to include the legitimate school of tragic English\nromance, which has been ennobled, and in great measure founded, by the\ngenius of Sir Walter Scott.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nCHAPTER\n\nI.

Black wainscoting glimmered\nup to the ceiling, in small ebony panels; a cheerful clump of wax candles\non the tea-table; many old portraits, some grim and pale, others pretty,\nand some very graceful and charming, hanging from the walls. Few pictures,\nexcept portraits long and short, were there. On the whole, I think you\nwould have taken the room for our parlour. It was not like our modern\nnotion of a drawing-room. It was a long room too, and every way capacious,\nbut irregularly shaped.\n\nA girl, of a little more than seventeen, looking, I believe, younger still;\nslight and rather tall, with a great deal of golden hair, dark grey-eyed,\nand with a countenance rather sensitive and melancholy, was sitting at the\ntea-table, in a reverie. I was that girl.\n\nThe only other person in the room--the only person in the house related to\nme--was my father. He was Mr. Ruthyn, of Knowl, so called in his county,\nbut he had many other places, was of a very ancient lineage, who had\nrefused a baronetage often, and it was said even a viscounty, being of a\nproud and defiant spirit, and thinking themselves higher in station and\npurer of blood than two-thirds of the nobility into whose ranks, it was\nsaid, they had been invited to enter. Of all this family lore I knew but\nlittle and vaguely; only what is to be gathered from the fireside talk of\nold retainers in the nursery.\n\nI am sure my father loved me, and I know I loved him. With the sure\ninstinct of childhood I apprehended his tenderness, although it was never\nexpressed in common ways. But my father was an oddity. He had been early\ndisappointed in Parliament, where it was his ambition to succeed. Though a\nclever man, he failed there, where very inferior men did extremely well.\nThen he went abroad, and became a connoisseur and a collector; took a part,\non his return, in literary and scientific institutions, and also in the\nfoundation and direction of some charities. But he tired of this mimic\ngovernment, and gave himself up to a country life, not that of a sportsman,\nbut rather of a student, staying sometimes at one of his places and\nsometimes at another, and living a secluded life.\n\nRather late in life he married, and his beautiful young wife died, leaving\nme, their only child, to his care. This bereavement, I have been told,\nchanged him--made him more odd and taciturn than ever, and his temper also,\nexcept to me, more severe. There was also some disgrace about his younger\nbrother--my uncle Silas--which he felt bitterly.\n\nHe was now walking up and down this spacious old room, which, extending\nround an angle at the far end, was very dark in that quarter. It was his\nwont to walk up and down thus, without speaking--an exercise which used to\nremind me of Chateaubriand's father in the great chamber of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau\nde Combourg. At the far end he nearly disappeared in the gloom, and then\nreturning emerged for a few minutes, like a portrait with a background of\nshadow, and then again in silence faded nearly out of view.\n\nThis monotony and silence would have been terrifying to a person less\naccustomed to it than I. As it was, it had its effect. I have known my\nfather a whole day without once speaking to me. Though I loved him very\nmuch, I was also much in awe of him.\n\nWhile my father paced the floor, my thoughts were employed about the events\nof a month before. So few things happened at Knowl out of the accustomed\nroutine, that a very trifling occurrence was enough to set people wondering\nand conjecturing in that serene household. My father lived in remarkable\nseclusion; except for a ride, he hardly ever left the grounds of Knowl; and\nI don't think it happened twice in the year that a visitor sojourned among\nus.\n\nThere was not even that mild religious bustle which sometimes besets the\nwealthy and moral recluse. My father had left the Church of England for\nsome odd sect, I forget its name, and ultimately became, I was told, a\nSwedenborgian. But he did not care to trouble me upon the subject. So the\nold carriage brought my governess, when I had one, the old housekeeper,\nMrs. Rusk, and myself to the parish church every Sunday. And my father, in\nthe view of the honest rector who shook his head over him--'a cloud without\nwater, carried about of winds, and a wandering star to whom is reserved the\nblackness of darkness'--corresponded with the 'minister' of his church, and\nwas provokingly contented with his own fertility and illumination; and\nMrs. Rusk, who was a sound and bitter churchwoman, said he fancied he saw\nvisions and talked with angels like the rest of that 'rubbitch.'\n\nI don't know that she had any better foundation than analogy and conjecture\nfor charging my father with supernatural pretensions; and in all points\nwhen her orthodoxy was not concerned, she loved her master and was a loyal\nhousekeeper.\n\nI found her one morning superintending preparations for the reception of\na visitor, in the hunting-room it was called, from the pieces of tapestry\nthat covered its walls, representing scenes _\u00c3\u00a0 la Wouvermans_, of falconry,\nand the chase, dogs, hawks, ladies, gallants, and pages. In the midst of\nwhom Mrs. Rusk, in black silk, was rummaging drawers, counting linen, and\nissuing orders.\n\n'Who is coming, Mrs. Rusk?'\n\nWell, she only knew his name. It was a Mr. Bryerly. My papa expected him to\ndinner, and to stay for some days.\n\n'I guess he's one of those creatures, dear, for I mentioned his name just\nto Dr. Clay (the rector), and he says there _is_ a Doctor Bryerly, a great\nconjurer among the Swedenborg sect--and that's him, I do suppose.'\n\nIn my hazy notions of these sectaries there was mingled a suspicion of\nnecromancy, and a weird freemasonry, that inspired something of awe and\nantipathy.\n\nMr. Bryerly arrived time enough to dress at his leisure, before dinner. He\nentered the drawing-room--a tall, lean man, all in ungainly black, with a\nwhite choker, with either a black wig, or black hair dressed in imitation\nof one, a pair of spectacles, and a dark, sharp, short visage, rubbing his\nlarge hands together, and with a short brisk nod to me, whom he plainly\nregarded merely as a child, he sat down before the fire, crossed his legs,\nand took up a magazine.\n\nThis treatment was mortifying, and I remember very well the resentment of\nwhich _he_ was quite unconscious.\n\nHis stay was not very long; not one of us divined the object of his visit,\nand he did not prepossess us favourably. He seemed restless, as men of busy\nhabits do in country houses, and took walks, and a drive, and read in the\nlibrary, and wrote half a dozen letters.\n\nHis bed-room and dressing-room were at the side of the gallery, directly\nopposite to my father's, which had a sort of ante-room _en suite_, in which\nwere some of his theological books.\n\nThe day after Mr. Bryerly's arrival, I was about to see whether my father's\nwater caraffe and glass had been duly laid on the table in this ante-room,\nand in doubt whether he was there, I knocked at the door.\n\nI suppose they were too intent on other matters to hear, but receiving no\nanswer, I entered the room. My father was sitting in his chair, with his\ncoat and waistcoat off, Mr. Bryerly kneeling on a stool beside him, rather\nfacing him, his black scratch wig leaning close to my father's grizzled\nhair. There was a large tome of their divinity lore, I suppose, open on\nthe table close by. The lank black figure of Mr. Bryerly stood up, and he\nconcealed something quickly in the breast of his coat.\n\nMy father stood up also, looking paler, I think, than I ever saw him till\nthen, and he pointed grimly to the door, and said, 'Go.'\n\nMr. Bryerly pushed me gently back with his hands to my shoulders, and\nsmiled down from his dark features with an expression quite unintelligible\nto me.\n\nI had recovered myself in a second, and withdrew without a word. The last\nthing I saw at the door was the tall, slim figure in black, and the dark,\nsignificant smile following me: and then the door was shut and locked, and\nthe two Swedenborgians were left to their mysteries.\n\nI remember so well the kind of shock and disgust I felt in the certainty\nthat I had surprised them at some, perhaps, debasing incantation--a\nsuspicion of this Mr. Bryerly, of the ill-fitting black coat, and white\nchoker--and a sort of fear came upon me, and I fancied he was asserting\nsome kind of mastery over my father, which very much alarmed me.\n\nI fancied all sorts of dangers in the enigmatical smile of the lank\nhigh-priest. The image of my father, as I had seen him, it might be,\nconfessing to this man in black, who was I knew not what, haunted me with\nthe disagreeable uncertainties of a mind very uninstructed as to the limits\nof the marvellous.\n\nI mentioned it to no one. But I was immensely relieved when the sinister\nvisitor took his departure the morning after, and it was upon this\noccurrence that my mind was now employed.\n\nSome one said that Dr. Johnson resembled a ghost, who must be spoken to\nbefore it will speak. But my father, in whatever else he may have resembled\na ghost, did not in that particular; for no one but I in his household--and\nI very seldom--dared to address him until first addressed by him. I had no\nnotion how singular this was until I began to go out a little among friends\nand relations, and found no such rule in force anywhere else.\n\nAs I leaned back in my chair thinking, this phantasm of my father came, and\nturned, and vanished with a solemn regularity. It was a peculiar figure,\nstrongly made, thick-set, with a face large, and very stern; he wore a\nloose, black velvet coat and waistcoat. It was, however, the figure of an\nelderly rather than an old man--though he was then past seventy--but firm,\nand with no sign of feebleness.\n\nI remember the start with which, not suspecting that he was close by me, I\nlifted my eyes, and saw that large, rugged countenance looking fixedly on\nme, from less than a yard away.\n\nAfter I saw him, he continued to regard me for a second or two; and then,\ntaking one of the heavy candlesticks in his gnarled hand, he beckoned me to\nfollow him; which, in silence and wondering, I accordingly did.\n\nHe led me across the hall, where there were lights burning, and into a\nlobby by the foot of the back stairs, and so into his library.\n\nIt is a long, narrow room, with two tall, slim windows at the far end, now\ndraped in dark curtains. Dusky it was with but one candle; and he paused\nnear the door, at the left-hand side of which stood, in those days, an\nold-fashioned press or cabinet of carved oak. In front of this he stopped.\n\nHe had odd, absent ways, and talked more to himself, I believe, than to all\nthe rest of the world put together.\n\n'She won't understand,' he whispered, looking at me enquiringly. 'No, she\nwon't. _Will_ she?'\n\nThen there was a pause, during which he brought forth from his breast\npocket a small bunch of some half-dozen keys, on one of which he looked\nfrowningly, every now and then balancing it a little before his eyes,\nbetween his finger and thumb, as he deliberated.\n\nI knew him too well, of course, to interpose a word.\n\n'They are easily frightened--ay, they are. I'd better do it another way.'\n\nAnd pausing, he looked in my face as he might upon a picture.\n\n'They _are_--yes--I had better do it another way--another way; yes--and\nshe'll not suspect--she'll not suppose.'\n\nThen he looked steadfastly upon the key, and from it to me, suddenly\nlifting it up, and said abruptly, 'See, child,' and, after a second or two,\n'_Remember_ this key.'\n\nIt was oddly shaped, and unlike others.\n\n'Yes, sir.' I always called him 'sir.'\n\n'It opens that,' and he tapped it sharply on the door of the cabinet. 'In\nthe daytime it is always here,' at which word he dropped it into his pocket\nagain. 'You see?--and at night under my pillow--you hear me?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'You won't forget this cabinet--oak--next the door--on your left--you won't\nforget?'\n\n'No, sir.'\n\n'Pity she's a girl, and so young--ay, a girl, and so young--no\nsense--giddy. You say, you'll _remember_?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'It behoves you.'\n\nHe turned round and looked full upon me, like a man who has taken a sudden\nresolution; and I think for a moment he had made up his mind to tell me a\ngreat deal more. But if so, he changed it again; and after another pause,\nhe said slowly and sternly--'You will tell nobody what I have said, under\npain of my displeasure.'\n\n'Oh! no, sir!'\n\n'Good child!'\n\n'_Except_,' he resumed, 'under one contingency; that is, in case I should\nbe absent, and Dr. Bryerly--you recollect the thin gentleman, in spectacles\nand a black wig, who spent three days here last month--should come and\nenquire for the key, you understand, in my absence.'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\nSo he kissed me on the forehead, and said--\n\n'Let us return.'\n\nWhich, accordingly, we did, in silence; the storm outside, like a dirge on\na great organ, accompanying our flitting.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_UNCLE SILAS_\n\n\nWhen we reached the drawing-room, I resumed my chair, and my father his\nslow and regular walk to and fro, in the great room. Perhaps it was the\nuproar of the wind that disturbed the ordinary tenor of his thoughts; but,\nwhatever was the cause, certainly he was unusually talkative that night.\n\nAfter an interval of nearly half an hour, he drew near again, and sat down\nin a high-backed arm-chair, beside the fire, and nearly opposite to me, and\nlooked at me steadfastly for some time, as was his wont, before speaking;\nand said he--\n\n'This won't do--you must have a governess.'\n\nIn cases of this kind I merely set down my book or work, as it might be,\nand adjusted myself to listen without speaking.\n\n'Your French is pretty well, and your Italian; but you have no German.\nYour music may be pretty good--I'm no judge--but your drawing might be\nbetter--yes--yes. I believe there are accomplished ladies--finishing\ngovernesses, they call them--who undertake more than any one teacher would\nhave professed in my time, and do very well. She can prepare you, and\nnext winter, then, you shall visit France and Italy, where you may be\naccomplished as highly as you please.'\n\n'Thank you, sir.'\n\n'You shall. It is nearly six months since Miss Ellerton left you--too long\nwithout a teacher.'\n\nThen followed an interval.\n\n'Dr. Bryerly will ask you about that key, and what it opens; you show all\nthat to _him_, and no one else.'\n\n'But,' I said, for I had a great terror of disobeying him in ever so minute\na matter, 'you will then be absent, sir--how am I to find the key?'\n\nHe smiled on me suddenly--a bright but wintry smile--it seldom came, and\nwas very transitory, and kindly though mysterious.\n\n'True, child; I'm glad you are so wise; _that_, you will find, I have\nprovided for, and you shall know exactly where to look. You have remarked\nhow solitarily I live. You fancy, perhaps, I have not got a friend, and\nyou are nearly right--_nearly_, but not altogether. I have a very sure\nfriend--_one_--a friend whom I once misunderstood, but now appreciate.'\n\nI wondered silently whether it could be Uncle Silas.\n\n'He'll make me a call, some day soon; I'm not quite sure when. I won't tell\nyou his name--you'll hear that soon enough, and I don't want it talked of;\nand I must make a little journey with him. You'll not be afraid of being\nleft alone for a time?'\n\n'And have you promised, sir?' I answered, with another question, my\ncuriosity and anxiety overcoming my awe. He took my questioning very\ngood-humouredly.\n\n'Well--_promise_?--no, child; but I'm under condition; he's not to be\ndenied. I must make the excursion with him the moment he calls. I have no\nchoice; but, on the whole, I rather like it--remember, I say, I rather\n_like_ it.'\n\nAnd he smiled again, with the same meaning, that was at once stern and sad.\nThe exact purport of these sentences remained fixed in my mind, so that\neven at this distance of time I am quite sure of them.\n\nA person quite unacquainted with my father's habitually abrupt and odd way\nof talking, would have fancied that he was possibly a little disordered in\nhis mind. But no such suspicion for a moment troubled me. I was quite sure\nthat he spoke of a real person who was coming, and that his journey was\nsomething momentous; and when the visitor of whom he spoke did come, and he\ndeparted with him upon that mysterious excursion, I perfectly understood\nhis language and his reasons for saying so much and yet so little.\n\nYou are not to suppose that all my hours were passed in the sort of\nconference and isolation of which I have just given you a specimen; and\nsingular and even awful as were sometimes my _t\u00c3\u00aate-a-t\u00c3\u00aates_ with my father,\nI had grown so accustomed to his strange ways, and had so unbounded a\nconfidence in his affection, that they never depressed or agitated me in\nthe manner you might have supposed. I had a great deal of quite a different\nsort of chat with good old Mrs. Rusk, and very pleasant talks with Mary\nQuince, my somewhat ancient maid; and besides all this, I had now and then\na visit of a week or so at the house of some one of our country neighbours,\nand occasionally a visitor--but this, I must own, very rarely--at Knowl.\n\nThere had come now a little pause in my father's revelations, and my fancy\nwandered away upon a flight of discovery. Who, I again thought, could this\nintending visitor be, who was to come, armed with the prerogative to make\nmy stay-at-home father forthwith leave his household goods--his books and\nhis child--to whom he clung, and set forth on an unknown knight-errantry?\nWho but Uncle Silas, I thought--that mysterious relative whom I had\nnever seen--who was, it had in old times been very darkly hinted to me,\nunspeakably unfortunate or unspeakably vicious--whom I had seldom heard my\nfather mention, and then in a hurried way, and with a pained, thoughtful\nlook. Once only he had said anything from which I could gather my father's\nopinion of him, and then it was so slight and enigmatical that I might have\nfilled in the character very nearly as I pleased.\n\nIt happened thus. One day Mrs. Rusk was in the oak-room, I being then about\nfourteen. She was removing a stain from a tapestry chair, and I watched the\nprocess with a childish interest. She sat down to rest herself--she had\nbeen stooping over her work--and threw her head back, for her neck was\nweary, and in this position she fixed her eyes on a portrait that hung\nbefore her.\n\nIt was a full-length, and represented a singularly handsome young man,\ndark, slender, elegant, in a costume then quite obsolete, though I believe\nit was seen at the beginning of this century--white leather pantaloons and\ntop-boots, a buff waistcoat, and a chocolate-coloured coat, and the hair\nlong and brushed back.\n\nThere was a remarkable elegance and a delicacy in the features, but also a\ncharacter of resolution and ability that quite took the portrait out of the\ncategory of mere fops or fine men. When people looked at it for the first\ntime, I have so often heard the exclamation--'What a wonderfully handsome\nman!' and then, 'What a clever face!' An Italian greyhound stood by him,\nand some slender columns and a rich drapery in the background. But though\nthe accessories were of the luxurious sort, and the beauty, as I have said,\nrefined, there was a masculine force in that slender oval face, and a fire\nin the large, shadowy eyes, which were very peculiar, and quite redeemed it\nfrom the suspicion of effeminacy.\n\n'Is not that Uncle Silas?' said I.\n\n'Yes, dear,' answered Mrs. Rusk, looking, with her resolute little face,\nquietly on the portrait.\n\n'He must be a very handsome man, Mrs. Rusk. Don't you think so?' I\ncontinued.\n\n'He _was_, my dear--yes; but it is forty years since that was painted--the\ndate is there in the corner, in the shadow that comes from his foot, and\nforty years, I can tell you, makes a change in most of us;' and Mrs. Rusk\nlaughed, in cynical good-humour.\n\nThere was a little pause, both still looking on the handsome man in\ntop-boots, and I said--\n\n'And why, Mrs. Rusk, is papa always so sad about Uncle Silas?'\n\n'What's that, child?' said my father's voice, very near. I looked round,\nwith a start, and flushed and faltered, receding a step from him.\n\n'No harm, dear. You have said nothing wrong,' he said gently, observing\nmy alarm. 'You said I was always sad, I think, about Uncle Silas. Well,\nI don't know how you gather that; but if I were, I will now tell you, it\nwould not be unnatural. Your uncle is a man of great talents, great faults,\nand great wrongs. His talents have not availed him; his faults are long ago\nrepented of; and his wrongs I believe he feels less than I do, but they are\ndeep. Did she say any more, madam?' he demanded abruptly of Mrs. Rusk.\n\n'Nothing, sir,' with a stiff little courtesy, answered Mrs. Rusk, who stood\nin awe of him.\n\n'And there is no need, child,' he continued, addressing himself to me,\n'that you should think more of him at present. Clear your head of Uncle\nSilas. One day, perhaps, you will know him--yes, very well--and understand\nhow villains have injured him.\n\nThen my father retired, and at the door he said--\n\n'Mrs. Rusk, a word, if you please,' beckoning to that lady, who trotted\nafter him to the library.\n\nI think he then laid some injunction upon the housekeeper, which was\ntransmitted by her to Mary Quince, for from that time forth I could never\nlead either to talk with me about Uncle Silas. They let me talk on, but\nwere reserved and silent themselves, and seemed embarrassed, and Mrs. Rusk\nsometimes pettish and angry, when I pressed for information.\n\nThus curiosity was piqued; and round the slender portrait in the leather\npantaloons and top-boots gathered many-coloured circles of mystery, and the\nhandsome features seemed to smile down upon my baffled curiosity with a\nprovoking significance.\n\nWhy is it that this form of ambition--curiosity--which entered into the\ntemptation of our first parent, is so specially hard to resist? Knowledge\nis power--and power of one sort or another is the secret lust of human\nsouls; and here is, beside the sense of exploration, the undefinable\ninterest of a story, and above all, something forbidden, to stimulate the\ncontumacious appetite.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_A NEW FACE_\n\n\nI think it was about a fortnight after that conversation in which my father\nhad expressed his opinion, and given me the mysterious charge about the\nold oak cabinet in his library, as already detailed, that I was one night\nsitting at the great drawing-room window, lost in the melancholy reveries\nof night, and in admiration of the moonlighted scene. I was the only\noccupant of the room; and the lights near the fire, at its farther end,\nhardly reached to the window at which I sat.\n\nThe shorn grass sloped gently downward from the windows till it met the\nbroad level on which stood, in clumps, or solitarily scattered, some of the\nnoblest timber in England. Hoar in the moonbeams stood those graceful\ntrees casting their moveless shadows upon the grass, and in the background\ncrowning the undulations of the distance, in masses, were piled those woods\namong which lay the solitary tomb where the remains of my beloved mother\nrested.\n\nThe air was still. The silvery vapour hung serenely on the far horizon,\nand the frosty stars blinked brightly. Everyone knows the effect of such a\nscene on a mind already saddened. Fancies and regrets float mistily in\nthe dream, and the scene affects us with a strange mixture of memory and\nanticipation, like some sweet old air heard in the distance. As my eyes\nrested on those, to me, funereal but glorious woods, which formed the\nbackground of the picture, my thoughts recurred to my father's mysterious\nintimations and the image of the approaching visitor; and the thought of\nthe unknown journey saddened me.\n\nIn all that concerned his religion, from very early association, there was\nto me something of the unearthly and spectral.\n\nWhen my dear mamma died I was not nine years old; and I remember, two days\nbefore the funeral, there came to Knowl, where she died, a thin little man,\nwith large black eyes, and a very grave, dark face.\n\nHe was shut up a good deal with my dear father, who was in deep affliction;\nand Mrs. Rusk used to say, 'It is rather odd to see him praying with that\nlittle scarecrow from London, and good Mr. Clay ready at call, in the\nvillage; much good that little black whipper-snapper will do him!'\n\nWith that little black man, on the day after the funeral, I was sent out,\nfor some reason, for a walk; my governess was ill, I know, and there was\nconfusion in the house, and I dare say the maids made as much of a holiday\nas they could.\n\nI remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man; but I was not\nafraid of him, for he was gentle, though sad--and seemed kind. He led me\ninto the garden--the Dutch garden, we used to call it--with a balustrade,\nand statues at the farther front, laid out in a carpet-pattern of\nbrilliantly-coloured flowers. We came down the broad flight of Caen stone\nsteps into this, and we walked in silence to the balustrade. The base was\ntoo high at the spot where we reached it for me to see over; but holding my\nhand, he said, 'Look through that, my child. Well, you can't; but _I_ can\nsee beyond it--shall I tell you what? I see ever so much. I see a cottage\nwith a steep roof, that looks like gold in the sunlight; there are tall\ntrees throwing soft shadows round it, and flowering shrubs, I can't say\nwhat, only the colours are beautiful, growing by the walls and windows, and\ntwo little children are playing among the stems of the trees, and we are on\nour way there, and in a few minutes shall be under those trees ourselves,\nand talking to those little children. Yet now to me it is but a picture in\nmy brain, and to you but a story told by me, which you believe. Come, dear;\nlet us be going.'\n\nSo we descended the steps at the right, and side by side walked along the\ngrass lane between tall trim walls of evergreens. The way was in deep\nshadow, for the sun was near the horizon; but suddenly we turned to the\nleft, and there we stood in rich sunlight, among the many objects he had\ndescribed.\n\n'Is this your house, my little men?' he asked of the children--pretty\nlittle rosy boys--who assented; and he leaned with his open hand against\nthe stem of one of the trees, and with a grave smile he nodded down to me,\nsaying--\n\n'You see now, and hear, and _feel_ for yourself that both the vision and\nthe story were quite true; but come on, my dear, we have further to go.'\n\nAnd relapsing into silence we had a long ramble through the wood, the same\non which I was now looking in the distance. Every now and then he made me\nsit down to rest, and he in a musing solemn sort of way would relate some\nlittle story, reflecting, even to my childish mind, a strange suspicion\nof a spiritual meaning, but different from what honest Mrs. Rusk used\nto expound to me from the Parables, and, somehow, startling in its very\nvagueness.\n\nThus entertained, though a little awfully, I accompanied the dark\nmysterious little 'whipper-snapper' through the woodland glades. We came,\nto me quite unexpectedly, in the deep sylvan shadows, upon the grey,\npillared temple, four-fronted, with a slanting pedestal of lichen-stained\nsteps, the lonely sepulchre in which I had the morning before seen poor\nmamma laid. At the sight the fountains of my grief reopened, and I cried\nbitterly, repeating, 'Oh! mamma, mamma, little mamma!' and so went on\nweeping and calling wildly on the deaf and the silent. There was a stone\nbench some ten steps away from the tomb.\n\n'Sit down beside me, my child,' said the grave man with the black eyes,\nvery kindly and gently. 'Now, what do you see there?' he asked, pointing\nhorizontally with his stick towards the centre of the opposite structure.\n\n'Oh, _that_--that place where poor mamma is?'\n\n'Yes, a stone wall with pillars, too high for either you or me to see over.\nBut----'\n\nHere he mentioned a name which I think must have been Swedenborg, from what\nI afterwards learnt of his tenets and revelations; I only know that it\nsounded to me like the name of a magician in a fairy tale; I fancied he\nlived in the wood which surrounded us, and I began to grow frightened as he\nproceeded.\n\n'But Swedenborg sees beyond it, over, and _through_ it, and has told me all\nthat concerns us to know. He says your mamma is not there.'\n\n'She is taken away!' I cried, starting up, and with streaming eyes, gazing\non the building which, though I stamped my feet in my distraction, I was\nafraid to approach. 'Oh, _is_ mamma taken away? Where is she? Where have\nthey brought her to?'\n\nI was uttering unconsciously very nearly the question with which Mary,\nin the grey of that wondrous morning on which she stood by the empty\nsepulchre, accosted the figure standing near.\n\n'Your mamma is alive but too far away to see or hear us. Swedenborg,\nstanding here, can see and hear her, and tells me all he sees, just as I\ntold you in the garden about the little boys and the cottage, and the trees\nand flowers which you could not see, but you believed in when _I_ told you. So\nI can tell you now as I did then; and as we are both, I hope, walking on to\nthe same place just as we did to the trees and cottage. You will surely see\nwith your own eyes how true the description is which I give you.'\n\nI was very frightened, for I feared that when he had done his narrative we\nwere to walk on through the wood into that place of wonders and of shadows\nwhere the dead were visible.\n\nHe leaned his elbow on his knee, and his forehead on his hand, which\nshaded his downcast eyes. In that attitude he described to me a beautiful\nlandscape, radiant with a wondrous light, in which, rejoicing, my mother\nmoved along an airy path, ascending among mountains of fantastic height,\nand peaks, melting in celestial colouring into the air, and peopled with\nhuman beings translated into the same image, beauty, and splendour. And\nwhen he had ended his relation, he rose, took my hand, and smiling gently\ndown on my pale, wondering face, he said the same words he had spoken\nbefore--\n\n'Come, dear, let us go.'\n\n'Oh! no, no, _no_--not now,' I said, resisting, and very much frightened.\n\n'Home, I mean, dear. We cannot walk to the place I have described. We can\nonly reach it through the gate of death, to which we are all tending, young\nand old, with sure steps.'\n\n'And where is the gate of death?' I asked in a sort of whisper, as we\nwalked together, holding his hand, and looking stealthily. He smiled sadly\nand said--\n\n'When, sooner or later, the time comes, as Hagar's eyes were opened in the\nwilderness, and she beheld the fountain of water, so shall each of us see\nthe door open before us, and enter in and be refreshed.'\n\nFor a long time following this walk I was very nervous; more so for the\nawful manner in which Mrs. Rusk received my statement--with stern lips and\nupturned hands and eyes, and an angry expostulation: 'I do wonder at\nyou, Mary Quince, letting the child walk into the wood with that limb of\ndarkness. It is a mercy he did not show her the devil, or frighten her out\nof her senses, in that lonely place!'\n\nOf these Swedenborgians, indeed, I know no more than I might learn from\ngood Mrs. Rusk's very inaccurate talk. Two or three of them crossed in the\ncourse of my early life, like magic-lantern figures, the disk of my very\ncircumscribed observation. All outside was and is darkness. I once tried to\nread one of their books upon the future state--heaven and hell; but I grew\nafter a day or two so nervous that I laid it aside. It is enough for me\nto know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions,\nwhich, so far from superseding, confirmed and interpreted the language of\nthe Bible; and as dear papa accepted their ideas, I am happy in thinking\nthat they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy writ.\n\nLeaning on my hand, I was now looking upon that solemn wood, white and\nshadowy in the moonlight, where, for a long time after that ramble with the\nvisionary, I fancied the gate of death, hidden only by a strange glamour,\nand the dazzling land of ghosts, were situate; and I suppose these earlier\nassociations gave to my reverie about my father's coming visitor a wilder\nand a sadder tinge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_MADAME DE LA ROUGIERRE_\n\n\nOn a sudden, on the grass before me, stood an odd figure--a very tall woman\nin grey draperies, nearly white under the moon, courtesying extraordinarily\nlow, and rather fantastically.\n\nI stared in something like a horror upon the large and rather hollow\nfeatures which I did not know, smiling very unpleasantly on me; and the\nmoment it was plain that I saw her, the grey woman began gobbling\nand cackling shrilly--I could not distinctly hear _what_ through the\nwindow--and gesticulating oddly with her long hands and arms.\n\nAs she drew near the window, I flew to the fireplace, and rang the bell\nfrantically, and seeing her still there, and fearing that she might break\ninto the room, I flew out of the door, very much frightened, and met\nBranston the butler in the lobby.\n\n'There's a woman at the window!' I gasped; 'turn her away, please.'\n\nIf I had said a man, I suppose fat Branston would have summoned and sent\nforward a detachment of footmen. As it was, he bowed gravely, with a--\n\n'Yes, 'm--shall, 'm.'\n\nAnd with an air of authority approached the window.\n\nI don't think that he was pleasantly impressed himself by the first sight\nof our visitor, for he stopped short some steps of the window, and demanded\nrather sternly--\n\n'What ye doin' there, woman?'\n\nTo this summons, her answer, which occupied a little time, was inaudible to\nme. But Branston replied--\n\n'I wasn't aware, ma'am; I heerd nothin'; if you'll go round _that_ way,\nyou'll see the hall-door steps, and I'll speak to the master, and do as he\nshall order.'\n\nThe figure said something and pointed.\n\n'Yes, that's it, and ye can't miss the door.'\n\nAnd Mr. Branston returned slowly down the long room, and halted with\nout-turned pumps and a grave inclination before me, and the faintest amount\nof interrogation in the announcement--\n\n'Please, 'm, she says she's the governess.'\n\n'The governess! _What_ governess?'\n\nBranston was too well-bred to smile, and he said thoughtfully--\n\n'P'raps, 'm, I'd best ask the master?'\n\nTo which I assented, and away strode the flat pumps of the butler to the\nlibrary.\n\nI stood breathless in the hall. Every girl at my age knows how much is\ninvolved in such an advent. I also heard Mrs. Rusk, in a minute or two\nmore, emerge I suppose from the study. She walked quickly, and muttered\nsharply to herself--an evil trick, in which she indulged when much 'put\nabout.' I should have been glad of a word with her; but I fancied she was\nvexed, and would not have talked satisfactorily. She did not, however, come\nmy way; merely crossing the hall with her quick, energetic step.\n\nWas it really the arrival of a governess? Was that apparition which had\nimpressed me so unpleasantly to take the command of me--to sit alone with\nme, and haunt me perpetually with her sinister looks and shrilly gabble?\n\nI was just making up my mind to go to Mary Quince, and learn something\ndefinite, when I heard my father's step approaching from the library: so\nI quietly re-entered the drawing-room, but with an anxious and throbbing\nheart.\n\nWhen he came in, as usual, he patted me on the head gently, with a kind of\nsmile, and then began his silent walk up and down the room. I was yearning\nto question him on the point that just then engrossed me so disagreeably;\nbut the awe in which I stood of him forbade.\n\nAfter a time he stopped at the window, the curtain of which I had drawn,\nand the shutter partly opened, and he looked out, perhaps with associations\nof his own, on the scene I had been contemplating.\n\nIt was not for nearly an hour after, that my father suddenly, after his\nwont, in a few words, apprised me of the arrival of Madame de la Rougierre\nto be my governess, highly recommended and perfectly qualified. My heart\nsank with a sure presage of ill. I already disliked, distrusted, and feared\nher.\n\nI had more than an apprehension of her temper and fear of possibly abused\nauthority. The large-featured, smirking phantom, saluting me so oddly in\nthe moonlight, retained ever after its peculiar and unpleasant hold upon my\nnerves.\n\n'Well, Miss Maud, dear, I hope you'll like your new governess--for it's\nmore than _I_ do, just at present at least,' said Mrs. Rusk, sharply--she\nwas awaiting me in my room. 'I hate them French-women; they're not natural,\nI think. I gave her her supper in my room. She eats like a wolf, she does,\nthe great raw-boned hannimal. I wish you saw her in bed as I did. I put her\nnext the clock-room--she'll hear the hours betimes, I'm thinking. You never\nsaw such a sight. The great long nose and hollow cheeks of her, and oogh!\nsuch a mouth! I felt a'most like little Red Riding-Hood--I did, Miss.'\n\nHere honest Mary Quince, who enjoyed Mrs. Rusk's satire, a weapon in which\nshe was not herself strong, laughed outright.\n\n'Turn down the bed, Mary. She's very agreeable--she is, just now--all\nnew-comers is; but she did not get many compliments from me, Miss--no,\nI rayther think not. I wonder why honest English girls won't answer the\ngentry for governesses, instead of them gaping, scheming, wicked furriners?\nLord forgi' me, I think they're all alike.'\n\nNext morning I made acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre. She was tall,\nmasculine, a little ghastly perhaps, and draped in purple silk, with a\nlace cap, and great bands of black hair, too thick and black, perhaps, to\ncorrespond quite naturally with her bleached and sallow skin, her hollow\njaws, and the fine but grim wrinkles traced about her brows and eyelids.\nShe smiled, she nodded, and then for a good while she scanned me in silence\nwith a steady cunning eye, and a stern smile.\n\n'And how is she named--what is Mademoiselle's name?' said the tall\nstranger.\n\n'_Maud_, Madame.'\n\n'Maud!--what pretty name! Eh bien! I am very sure my dear Maud she will\nbe very good little girl--is not so?--and I am sure I shall love you vary\nmoche. And what 'av you been learning, Maud, my dear cheaile--music,\nFrench, German, eh?'\n\n'Yes, a little; and I had just begun the use of the globes when my\ngoverness went away.'\n\nI nodded towards the globes, which stood near her, as I said this.\n\n'Oh! yes--the globes;' and she spun one of them with her great hand. 'Je\nvous expliquerai tout cela \u00c3\u00a0 fond.'\n\nMadame de la Rougierre, I found, was always quite ready to explain\neverything '\u00c3\u00a0 fond;' but somehow her 'explications,' as she termed them,\nwere not very intelligible, and when pressed her temper woke up; so that I\npreferred, after a while, accepting the expositions just as they came.\n\nMadame was on an unusually large scale, a circumstance which made some of\nher traits more startling, and altogether rendered her, in her strange way,\nmore awful in the eyes of a nervous _child,_ I may say, such as I was. She\nused to look at me for a long time sometimes, with the peculiar smile\nI have mentioned, and a great finger upon her lip, like the Eleusinian\npriestess on the vase.\n\nShe would sit, too, sometimes for an hour together, looking into the fire\nor out of the window, plainly seeing nothing, and with an odd, fixed look\nof something like triumph--very nearly a smile--on her cunning face.\n\nShe was by no means a pleasant _gouvernante_ for a nervous girl of my\nyears. Sometimes she had accesses of a sort of hilarity which frightened me\nstill more than her graver moods, and I will describe these by-and-by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_SIGHTS AND NOISES_\n\n\nThere is not an old house in England of which the servants and young people\nwho live in it do not cherish some traditions of the ghostly. Knowl has its\nshadows, noises, and marvellous records. Rachel Ruthyn, the beauty of Queen\nAnne's time, who died of grief for the handsome Colonel Norbrooke, who\nwas killed in the Low Countries, walks the house by night, in crisp and\nsounding silks. She is not seen, only heard. The tapping of her high-heeled\nshoes, the sweep and rustle of her brocades, her sighs as she pauses in the\ngalleries, near the bed-room doors; and sometimes, on stormy nights, her\nsobs.\n\nThere is, beside, the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man, in\na sable suit, with a link or torch in his hand. It usually only smoulders,\nwith a deep red glow, as he visits his beat. The library is one of the\nrooms he sees to. Unlike 'Lady Rachel,' as the maids called her, he is seen\nonly, never heard. His steps fall noiseless as shadows on floor and carpet.\nThe lurid glow of his smouldering torch imperfectly lights his figure and\nface, and, except when much perturbed, his link never blazes. On those\noccasions, however, as he goes his rounds, he ever and anon whirls it\naround his head, and it bursts into a dismal flame. This is a fearful omen,\nand always portends some direful crisis or calamity. It occurs, only once\nor twice in a century.\n\nI don't know whether Madame had heard anything of these phenomena; but she\ndid report which very much frightened me and Mary Quince. She asked us who\nwalked in the gallery on which her bed-room opened, making a rustling with\nher dress, and going down the stairs, and breathing long breaths here and\nthere. Twice, she said, she had stood at her door in the dark, listening to\nthese sounds, and once she called to know who it was. There was no answer,\nbut the person plainly turned back, and hurried towards her with an\nunnatural speed, which made her jump within her door and shut it.\n\nWhen first such tales are told, they excite the nerves of the young and the\nignorant intensely. But the special effect, I have found, soon wears out\nThe tale simply takes it's place with the rest. It was with Madame's\nnarrative.\n\nAbout a week after its relation, I had my experience of a similar sort.\nMary Quince went down-stairs for a night-light, leaving me in bed, a candle\nburning in the room, and being tired, I fell asleep before her return.\nWhen I awoke the candle had been extinguished. But I heard a step softly\napproaching. I jumped up--quite forgetting the ghost, and thinking only of\nMary Quince--and opened the door, expecting to see the light of her candle.\nInstead, all was dark, and near me I heard the fall of a bare foot on the\noak floor. It was as if some one had stumbled. I said, 'Mary,' but no\nanswer came, only a rustling of clothes and a breathing at the other side\nof the gallery, which passed off towards the upper staircase. I turned into\nmy room, freezing with horror, and clapt my door. The noise wakened Mary\nQuince, who had returned and gone to her bed half an hour before.\n\nAbout a fortnight after this, Mary Quince, a very veracious spinster,\nreported to me, that having got up to fix the window, which was rattling,\nat about four o'clock in the morning, she saw a light shining from the\nlibrary window. She could swear to its being a strong light, streaming\nthrough the chinks of the shutter, and moving. No doubt the link was waved\nabout his head by the angry 'link-man.'\n\nThese strange occurrences helped, I think, just then to make me nervous,\nand prepared the way for the odd sort of ascendency which, through my\nsense of the mysterious and super-natural, that repulsive Frenchwoman was\ngradually, and it seemed without effort, establishing over me.\n\nSome dark points of her character speedily emerged from the prismatic mist\nwith which she had enveloped it.\n\nMrs. Rusk's observation about the agreeability of new-comers I found to be\ntrue; for as Madame began to lose that character, her good-humour abated\nvery perceptibly, and she began to show gleams of another sort of temper,\nthat was lurid and dangerous.\n\nNotwithstanding this, she was in the habit of always having her Bible open\nby her, and was austerely attentive at morning and evening services, and\nasked my father, with great humility, to lend her some translations of\nSwedenborg's books, which she laid much to heart.\n\nWhen we went out for our walk, if the weather were bad we generally made\nour promenade up and down the broad terrace in front of the windows. Sullen\nand malign at times she used to look, and as suddenly she would pat me on\nthe shoulder caressingly, and smile with a grotesque benignity, asking\ntenderly, 'Are you fatigue, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re?' or 'Are you cold-a, dear Maud?'\n\nAt first these abrupt transitions puzzled me, sometimes half frightened\nme, savouring, I fancied, of insanity. The key, however, was accidentally\nsupplied, and I found that these accesses of demonstrative affection were\nsure to supervene whenever my father's face was visible through the library\nwindows.\n\nI did not know well what to make of this woman, whom I feared with a vein\nof superstitious dread. I hated being alone with her after dusk in the\nschool-room. She would sometimes sit for half an hour at a time, with her\nwide mouth drawn down at the corners, and a scowl, looking into the fire.\nIf she saw me looking at her, she would change all this on the instant,\naffect a sort of languor, and lean her head upon her hand, and ultimately\nhave recourse to her Bible. But I fancied she did not read, but pursued her\nown dark ruminations, for I observed that the open book might often lie for\nhalf an hour or more under her eyes and yet the leaf never turned.\n\nI should have been glad to be assured that she prayed when on her knees, or\nread when that book was before her; I should have felt that she was more\ncanny and human. As it was, those external pieties made a suspicion of a\nhollow contrast with realities that helped to scare me; yet it was but a\nsuspicion--I could not be certain.\n\nOur rector and the curate, with whom she was very gracious, and anxious\nabout my collects and catechism, had an exalted opinion of her. In public\nplaces her affection for me was always demonstrative.\n\nIn like manner she contrived conferences with my father. She was always\nmaking excuses to consult him about my reading, and to confide in him her\nsufferings, as I learned, from my contumacy and temper. The fact is, I was\naltogether quiet and submissive. But I think she had a wish to reduce me\nto a state of the most abject bondage. She had designs of domination and\nsubversion regarding the entire household, I now believe, worthy of the\nevil spirit I sometimes fancied her.\n\nMy father beckoned me into the study one day, and said he--\n\n'You ought not to give poor Madame so much pain. She is one of the few\npersons who take an interest in you; why should she have so often to\ncomplain of your ill-temper and disobedience?--why should she be compelled\nto ask my permission to punish you? Don't be afraid, I won't concede that.\nBut in so kind a person it argues much. Affection I can't command--respect\nand obedience I may--and I insist on your rendering _both_ to Madame.'\n\n'But sir,' I said, roused into courage by the gross injustice of the\ncharge, 'I have always done exactly as she bid me, and never said one\ndisrespectful word to Madame.'\n\n'I don't think, child, _you_ are the best judge of that. Go, and _amend_.'\nAnd with a displeased look he pointed to the door. My heart swelled with\nthe sense of wrong, and as I reached the door I turned to say another word,\nbut I could not, and only burst into tears.\n\n'There--don't cry, little Maud--only let us do better for the future.\nThere--there--there has been enough.'\n\nAnd he kissed my forehead, and gently put me out and closed the door.\n\nIn the school-room I took courage, and with some warmth upbraided Madame.\n\n'Wat wicked cheaile!' moaned Madame, demurely. 'Read aloud those\nthree--yes, _those_ three chapters of the Bible, my dear Maud.'\n\nThere was no special fitness in those particular chapters, and when they\nwere ended she said in a sad tone--\n\n'Now, dear, you must commit to memory this pretty priaire for umility of\nart.'\n\nIt was a long one, and in a state of profound irritation I got through the\ntask.\n\nMrs. Rusk hated her. She said she stole wine and brandy whenever the\nopportunity offered--that she was always asking her for such stimulants and\npretending pains in her stomach. Here, perhaps, there was exaggeration; but\nI knew it was true that I had been at different times despatched on that\nerrand and pretext for brandy to Mrs. Rusk, who at last came to her bedside\nwith pills and a mustard blister only, and was hated irrevocably ever\nafter.\n\nI felt all this was done to torture me. But a day is a long time to a\nchild, and they forgive quickly. It was always with a sense of danger that\nI heard Madame say she must go and see Monsieur Ruthyn in the library,\nand I think a jealousy of her growing influence was an ingredient in the\ndetestation in which honest Mrs. Rusk held her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_A WALK IN THE WOOD_\n\n\nTwo little pieces of by-play in which I detected her confirmed my\nunpleasant suspicion. From the corner of the gallery I one day saw her,\nwhen she thought I was out and all quiet, with her ear at the keyhole of\npapa's study, as we used to call the sitting-room next his bed-room. Her\neyes were turned in the direction of the stairs, from which only she\napprehended surprise. Her great mouth was open, and her eyes absolutely\ngoggled with eagerness. She was devouring all that was passing there.\nI drew back into the shadow with a kind of disgust and horror. She was\ntransformed into a great gaping reptile. I felt that I could have thrown\nsomething at her; but a kind of fear made me recede again toward my room.\nIndignation, however, quickly returned, and I came back, treading briskly\nas I did so. When I reached the angle of the gallery again. Madame, I\nsuppose, had heard me, for she was half-way down the stairs.\n\n'Ah, my dear Cheaile, I am so glad to find you, and you are dress to come\nout. We shall have so pleasant walk.'\n\nAt that moment the door of my father's study opened, and Mrs. Rusk, with\nher dark energetic face very much flushed, stepped out in high excitement.\n\n'The Master says you may have the brandy-bottle, Madame and I'm glad to be\nrid of it--_I_ am.'\n\nMadame courtesied with a great smirk, that was full of intangible hate and\ninsult.\n\n'Better your own brandy, if drink you must!' exclaimed Mrs. Rusk. 'You may\ncome to the store-room now, or the butler can take it.'\n\nAnd off whisked Mrs. Rusk for the back staircase.\n\nThere had been no common skirmish on this occasion, but a pitched battle.\n\nMadame had made a sort of pet of Anne Wixted, an under-chambermaid, and\nattached her to her interest economically by persuading me to make her\npresents of some old dresses and other things. Anne was such an angel!\n\nBut Mrs. Rusk, whose eyes were about her, detected Anne, with a\nbrandy-bottle under her apron, stealing up-stairs. Anne, in a panic,\ndeclared the truth. Madame had commissioned her to buy it in the town, and\nconvey it to her bed-room. Upon this, Mrs. Rusk impounded the flask; and,\nwith Anne beside her, rather precipitately appeared before 'the Master.' He\nheard and summoned Madame. Madame was cool, frank, and fluent. The brandy\nwas purely medicinal. She produced a document in the form of a note. Doctor\nSomebody presented his compliments to Madame de la Rougierre, and ordered\nher a table-spoonful of brandy and some drops of laudanum whenever the pain\nof stomach returned. The flask would last a whole year, perhaps two. She\nclaimed her medicine.\n\nMan's estimate of woman is higher than woman's own. Perhaps in their\nrelations to men they are generally more trustworthy--perhaps woman's is\nthe juster, and the other an appointed illusion. I don't know; but so it is\nordained.\n\nMrs. Rusk was recalled, and I saw, as you are aware, Madame's procedure\nduring the interview.\n\nIt was a great battle--a great victory. Madame was in high spirits. The air\nwas sweet--the landscape charming--I, so good--everything so beautiful!\nWhere should we go? _this_ way?\n\nI had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to Madame, I was so\nincensed at the treachery I had witnessed; but such resolutions do not last\nlong with very young people, and by the time we had reached the skirts of\nthe wood we were talking pretty much as usual.\n\n'I don't wish to go into the wood, Madame.\n\n'And for what?'\n\n'Poor mamma is buried there.'\n\n'Is _there_ the vault?' demanded Madame eagerly.\n\nI assented.\n\n'My faith, curious reason; you say because poor mamma is buried there you\nwill not approach! Why, cheaile, what would good Monsieur Ruthyn say if\nhe heard such thing? You are surely not so unkain', and I am with you.\n_Allons_. Let us come--even a little part of the way.'\n\nAnd so I yielded, though still reluctant.\n\nThere was a grass-grown road, which we easily reached, leading to the\nsombre building, and we soon arrived before it.\n\nMadame de la Rougierre seemed rather curious. She sat down on the little\nbank opposite, in her most languid pose--her head leaned upon the tips of\nher fingers.\n\n'How very sad--how solemn!' murmured Madame. 'What noble tomb! How triste,\nmy dear cheaile, your visit 'ere must it be, remembering a so sweet maman.\nThere is new inscription--is it not new?' And so, indeed, it seemed.\n\n'I am fatigue--maybe you will read it aloud to me slowly and solemnly, my\ndearest Maud?'\n\nAs I approached, I happened to look, I can't tell why, suddenly, over my\nshoulder; I was startled, for Madame was grimacing after me with a vile\nderisive distortion. She pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing. But\nit would not do: she saw that I had detected her, and she laughed aloud.\n\n'Come here, dear cheaile. I was just reflecting how foolish is all this\nthing--the tomb--the epitaph. I think I would 'av none--no, no epitaph. We\nregard them first for the oracle of the dead, and find them after only the\nfolly of the living. So I despise. Do you think your house of Knowl down\nthere is what you call haunt, my dear?'\n\n'Why?' said I, flushing and growing pale again. I felt quite afraid of\nMadame, and confounded at the suddenness of all this.\n\n'Because Anne Wixted she says there is ghost. How dark is this place! and\nso many of the Ruthyn family they are buried here--is not so? How high and\nthick are the trees all round! and nobody comes near.'\n\nAnd Madame rolled her eyes awfully, as if she expected to see something\nunearthly, and, indeed, looked very like it herself.\n\n'Come away, Madame,' I said, growing frightened, and feeling that if I were\nonce, by any accident, to give way to the panic that was gathering round\nme, I should instantaneously lose all control of myself. 'Oh, come away!\ndo, Madame--I'm frightened.'\n\n'No, on the contrary, sit here by me. It is very odd, you will think, ma\nch\u00c3\u00aare--un go\u00c3\u00bbt bizarre, vraiment!--but I love very much to be near to the\ndead people--in solitary place like this. I am not afraid of the dead\npeople, nor of the ghosts. 'Av you ever see a ghost, my dear?'\n\n'Do, Madame, _pray_ speak of something else.'\n\n'Wat little fool! But no, you are not afraid. I 'av seen the ghosts myself.\nI saw one, for example, last night, shape like a monkey, sitting in the\ncorner, with his arms round his knees; very wicked, old, old man his face\nwas like, and white eyes so large.'\n\n'Come away, Madame! you are trying to frighten me,' I said, in the childish\nanger which accompanies fear. Madame laughed an ugly laugh, and said--\n\n'Eh bien! little fool!--I will not tell the rest if you are really\nfrightened; let us change to something else.'\n\n'Yes, yes! oh, do--pray do.'\n\n'Wat good man is your father!'\n\n'Very--the kindest darling. I don't know why it is, Madame, I am so afraid\nof him, and never could tell him how much I love him.'\n\nThis confidential talking with Madame, strange to say, implied no\nconfidence; it resulted from fear--it was deprecatory. I treated her as if\nshe had human sympathies, in the hope that they might be generated somehow.\n\n'Was there not a doctor from London with him a few months ago? Dr. Bryerly,\nI think they call him.'\n\n'Yes, a Doctor Bryerly, who remained a few days. Shall we begin to walk\ntowards home, Madame? Do, pray.'\n\n'Immediately, cheaile; and does your father suffer much?'\n\n'No--I think not.'\n\n'And what then is his disease?'\n\n'Disease! he has _no_ disease. Have you heard anything about his health,\nMadame?' I said, anxiously.\n\n'Oh no, ma foi--I have heard nothing; but if the doctor came, it was not\nbecause he was quite well.'\n\n'But that doctor is a doctor in theology, I fancy. I know he is a\nSwedenborgian; and papa is so well he _could_ not have come as a\nphysician.'\n\n'I am very glad, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re, to hear; but still you know your father is\nold man to have so young cheaile as you. Oh, yes--he is old man, and so\nuncertain life is. 'As he made his will, my dear? Every man so rich as he,\nespecially so old, aught to 'av made his will.'\n\n'There is no need of haste, Madame; it is quite time enough when his health\nbegins to fail.'\n\n'But has he really compose no will?'\n\n'I really don't know, Madame.'\n\n'Ah, little rogue! you will not tell--but you are not such fool as you\nfeign yourself. No, no; you know everything. Come, tell me all about--it is\nfor your advantage, you know. What is in his will, and when he wrote?'\n\n'But, Madame, I really know nothing of it. I can't say whether there is a\nwill or not. Let us talk of something else.'\n\n'But, cheaile, it will not kill Monsieur Ruthyn to make his will; he will\nnot come to lie here a day sooner by cause of that; but if he make no will,\nyou may lose a great deal of the property. Would not that be pity?'\n\n'I really don't know anything of his will. If papa has made one, he has\nnever spoken of it to me. I know he loves me--that is enough.'\n\n'Ah! you are not such little goose--you do know everything, of course. Come\ntell me, little obstinate, otherwise I will break your little finger. Tell\nme everything.'\n\n'I know nothing of papa's will. You don't know, Madame, how you hurt me.\nLet us speak of something else.'\n\n'You do know, and you must tell, petite dure-t\u00c3\u00aate, or I will break a your\nlittle finger.'\n\nWith which words she seized that joint, and laughing spitefully, she\ntwisted it suddenly back. I screamed while she continued to laugh.\n\n'Will you tell?'\n\n'Yes, yes! let me go,' I shrieked.\n\nShe did not release it immediately however, but continued her torture and\ndiscordant laughter. At last she finally released my finger.\n\n'So she is going to be good cheaile, and tell everything to her\naffectionate gouvernante. What do you cry for, little fool?'\n\n'You've hurt me very much--you have broken my finger,' I sobbed.\n\n'Rub it and blow it and give it a kiss, little fool! What cross girl! I\nwill never play with you again--never. Let us go home.'\n\nMadame was silent and morose all the way home. She would not answer my\nquestions, and affected to be very lofty and offended.\n\nThis did not last very long, however, and she soon resumed her wonted ways.\nAnd she returned to the question of the will, but not so directly, and with\nmore art.\n\nWhy should this dreadful woman's thoughts be running so continually upon my\nfather's will? How could it concern her?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_CHURCH SCARSDALE_\n\n\nI think all the females of our household, except Mrs. Rusk, who was at open\nfeud with her and had only room for the fiercer emotions, were more or less\nafraid of this inauspicious foreigner.\n\nMrs. Rusk would say in her confidences in my room--\n\n'Where does she come from?--is she a French or a Swiss one, or is she a\nCanada woman? I remember one of _them_ when I was a girl, and a nice limb\n_she_ was, too! And who did she live with? Where was her last family? Not\none of us knows nothing about her, no more than a child; except, of course,\nthe Master--I do suppose he made enquiry. She's always at hugger-mugger\nwith Anne Wixted. I'll pack that _one_ about her business, if she doesn't\nmind. Tattling and whispering eternally. It's not about her own business\nshe's a-talking. Madame de la Rougepot, I call her. She _does_ know how to\npaint up to the ninety-nines--she does, the old cat. I beg your pardon,\nMiss, but _that_ she is--a devil, and no mistake. I found her out first by\nher thieving the Master's gin, that the doctor ordered him, and filling the\ndecanter up with water--the old villain; but she'll be found out yet, she\nwill; and all the maids is afraid on her. She's not right, they think--a\nwitch or a ghost--I should not wonder. Catherine Jones found her in her bed\nasleep in the morning after she sulked with you, you know, Miss, with all\nher clothes on, what-ever was the meaning; and I think she has frightened\n_you,_ Miss and has you as nervous as anythink--I do,' and so forth.\n\nIt was true. I _was_ nervous, and growing rather more so; and I think this\ncynical woman perceived and intended it, and was pleased. I was always\nafraid of her concealing herself in my room, and emerging at night to scare\nme. She began sometimes to mingle in my dreams, too--always awfully; and\nthis nourished, of course, the kind of ambiguous fear in which, in waking\nhours, I held her.\n\nI dreamed one night that she led me, all the time whispering something so\nvery fast that I could not understand her, into the library, holding\na candle in her other hand above her head. We walked on tiptoe, like\ncriminals at the dead of night, and stopped before that old oak cabinet\nwhich my father had indicated in so odd a way to me. I felt that we were\nabout some contraband practice. There was a key in the door, which I\nexperienced a guilty horror at turning, she whispering in the same\nunintelligible way, all the time, at my ear. I _did_ turn it; the door\nopened quite softly, and within stood my father, his face white and\nmalignant, and glaring close in mine. He cried in a terrible voice,\n'Death!' Out went Madame's candle, and at the same moment, with a scream,\nI waked in the dark--still fancying myself in the library; and for an hour\nafter I continued in a hysterical state.\n\nEvery little incident about Madame furnished a topic of eager discussion\namong the maids. More or less covertly, they nearly all hated and feared\nher. They fancied that she was making good her footing with 'the Master;'\nand that she would then oust Mrs. Rusk--perhaps usurp her place--and so\nmake a clean sweep of them all. I fancy the honest little housekeeper did\nnot discourage that suspicion.\n\nAbout this time I recollect a pedlar--an odd, gipsified-looking man--called\nin at Knowl. I and Catherine Jones were in the court when he came, and set\ndown his pack on the low balustrade beside the door.\n\nAll sorts of commodities he had--ribbons, cottons, silks, stockings,\nlace, and even some bad jewellry; and just as he began his display--an\ninteresting matter in a quiet country house--Madame came upon the ground.\nHe grinned a recognition, and hoped 'Madamasel' was well, and 'did not look\nto see _her_ here.'\n\n'Madamasel' thanked him. 'Yes, vary well,' and looked for the first time\ndecidedly 'put out.'\n\n'Wat a pretty things!' she said. 'Catherine, run and tell Mrs. Rusk. She\nwants scissars, and lace too--I heard her say.'\n\nSo Catherine, with a lingering look, departed; and Madame said--\n\n'Will you, dear cheaile, be so kind to bring here my purse, I forgot on the\ntable in my room; also, I advise you, bring _your_.'\n\nCatherine returned with Mrs. Rusk. Here was a man who could tell them\nsomething of the old Frenchwoman, at last! Slyly they dawdled over his\nwares, until Madame had made her market and departed with me. But when the\ncoveted opportunity came, the pedlar was quite impenetrable. 'He forgot\neverything; he did not believe as he ever saw the lady before. He called a\nFrenchwoman, all the world over, Madamasel--that wor the name on 'em all.\nHe never seed her in partiklar afore, as he could bring to mind. He liked\nto see 'em always, 'cause they makes the young uns buy.'\n\nThis reserve and oblivion were very provoking, and neither Mrs. Rusk nor\nCatherine Jones spent sixpence with him;--he was a stupid fellow, or worse.\n\nOf course Madame had tampered with him. But truth, like murder, will out\nsome day. Tom Williams, the groom, had seen her, when alone with him, and\npretending to look at his stock, with her face almost buried in his silks\nand Welsh linseys, talking as fast as she could all the time, and slipping\n_money_, he did suppose, under a piece of stuff in his box.\n\nIn the mean time, I and Madame were walking over the wide, peaty\nsheep-walks that lie between Knowl and Church Scarsdale. Since our visit to\nthe mausoleum in the wood, she had not worried me so much as before. She\nhad been, indeed, more than usually thoughtful, very little talkative, and\ntroubled me hardly at all about French and other accomplishments. A walk\nwas a part of our daily routine. I now carried a tiny basket in my hand,\nwith a few sandwiches, which were to furnish our luncheon when we reached\nthe pretty scene, about two miles away, whither we were tending.\n\nWe had started a little too late; Madame grew unwontedly fatigued and sat\ndown to rest on a stile before we had got half-way; and there she intoned,\nwith a dismal nasal cadence, a quaint old Bretagne ballad, about a lady\nwith a pig's head:--\n\n  'This lady was neither pig nor maid,\n  And so she was not of human mould;\n  Not of the living nor the dead.\n  Her left hand and foot were warm to touch;\n  Her right as cold as a corpse's flesh!\n  And she would sing like a funeral bell, with a ding-dong tune.\n  The pigs were afraid, and viewed her aloof;\n  And women feared her and stood afar.\n  She could do without sleep for a year and a day;\n  She could sleep like a corpse, for a month and more.\n  No one knew how this lady fed--\n  On acorns or on flesh.\n  Some say that she's one of the swine-possessed,\n  That swam over the sea of Gennesaret.\n  A mongrel body and demon soul.\n  Some say she's the wife of the Wandering Jew,\n  And broke the law for the sake of pork;\n  And a swinish face for a token doth bear,\n  That her shame is now, and her punishment coming.'\n\nAnd so it went on, in a gingling rigmarole. The more anxious I seemed to go\non our way, the more likely was she to loiter. I therefore showed no signs\nof impatience, and I saw her consult her watch in the course of her ugly\nminstrelsy, and slyly glance, as if expecting something, in the direction\nof our destination.\n\nWhen she had sung to her heart's content, up rose Madame, and began to walk\nonward silently. I saw her glance once or twice, as before, toward the\nvillage of Trillsworth, which lay in front, a little to our left, and\nthe smoke of which hung in a film over the brow of the hill. I think she\nobserved me, for she enquired--\n\n'Wat is that a smoke there?'\n\n'That is Trillsworth, Madame; there is a railway station there.'\n\n'Oh, le chemin de fer, so near! I did not think. Where it goes?'\n\nI told her, and silence returned.\n\nChurch Scarsdale is a very pretty and odd scene. The slightly undulating\nsheep-walk dips suddenly into a wide glen, in the lap of which, by a\nbright, winding rill, rise from the sward the ruins of a small abbey, with\na few solemn trees scattered round. The crows' nests hung untenanted in the\ntrees; the birds were foraging far away from their roosts. The very cattle\nhad forsaken the place. It was solitude itself.\n\nMadame drew a long breath and smiled.\n\n'Come down, come down, cheaile--come down to the churchyard.'\n\nAs we descended the slope which shut out the surrounding world, and the\nscene grew more sad and lonely. Madame's spirits seemed to rise.\n\n'See 'ow many grave-stones--one, _two_ hundred. Don't you love the dead,\ncheaile? I will teach you to love them. You shall see me die here to-day,\nfor half an hour, and be among them. That is what I love.'\n\nWe were by this time at the little brook's side, and the low churchyard\nwall with a stile, reached by a couple of stepping-stones, across the\nstream, immediately at the other side.\n\n'Come, now!' cried Madame, raising her face, as if to sniff the air; 'we\nare close to them. You will like them soon as I. You shall see five of\nthem. Ah, \u00c3\u00a7a ira, \u00c3\u00a7a ira, \u00c3\u00a7a ira! Come cross quickily! I am Madame la\nMorgue--Mrs. Deadhouse! I will present you my friends, Monsieur Cadavre and\nMonsieur Squelette. Come, come, leetle mortal, let us play. Ouaah!' And\nshe uttered a horrid yell from her enormous mouth, and pushing her wig and\nbonnet back, so as to show her great, bald head. She was laughing, and\nreally looked quite mad.\n\n'No, Madame, I will not go with you,' I said, disengaging my hand with a\nviolent effort, receding two or three steps.\n\n'Not enter the churchyard! Ma foi--wat mauvais go\u00c3\u00bbt! But see, we are\nalready in shade. The sun he is setting soon--where well you remain,\ncheaile? I will not stay long.'\n\n'I'll stay here,' I said, a little angrily--for I _was_ angry as well as\nnervous; and through my fear was that indignation at her extravagances\nwhich mimicked lunacy so unpleasantly, and were, I knew, designed to\nfrighten me.\n\nOver the stepping-stones, pulling up her dress, she skipped with her long,\nlank legs, like a witch joining a Walpurgis. Over the stile she strode, and\nI saw her head wagging, and heard her sing some of her ill-omened rhymes,\nas she capered solemnly, with many a grin and courtesy, among the graves\nand headstones, towards the ruin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_THE SMOKER_\n\n\nThree years later I learned--in a way she probably little expected, and\nthen did not much care about--what really occurred there. I learned even\nphrases and looks--for the story was related by one who had heard it\ntold--and therefore I venture to narrate what at the moment I neither saw\nnor suspected. While I sat, flushed and nervous, upon a flat stone by the\nbank of the little stream, Madame looked over her shoulder, and perceiving\nthat I was out of sight, she abated her pace, and turned sharply towards\nthe ruin which lay at her left. It was her first visit, and she was merely\nexploring; but now, with a perfectly shrewd and businesslike air, turning\nthe corner of the building, she saw, seated upon the edge of a grave-stone,\na rather fat and flashily-equipped young man, with large, light whiskers, a\njerry hat, green cutaway coat with gilt buttons, and waistcoat and trousers\nrather striking than elegant in pattern. He was smoking a short pipe, and\nmade a nod to Madame, without either removing it from his lips or rising,\nbut with his brown and rather good-looking face turned up, he eyed her with\nsomething of the impudent and sulky expression that was habitual to it.\n\n'Ha, Deedle, you are there! an' look so well. I am here, too, quite _a_lon;\nbut my friend, she wait outside the churchyard, by-side the leetle river,\nfor she must not think I know you--so I am come _a_lon.'\n\n'You're a quarter late, and I lost a fight by you, old girl, this morning,'\nsaid the gay man, and spat on the ground; 'and I wish you would not call me\nDiddle. I'll call you Granny if you do.'\n\n'Eh bien! _Dud,_ then. She is vary nice--wat you like. Slim waist, wite\nteeth, vary nice eyes--dark--wat you say is best--and nice leetle foot and\nankle.'\n\nMadame smiled leeringly.\n\nDud smoked on.\n\n'Go on,' said Dud, with a nod of command.\n\n'I am teach her to sing and play--she has such sweet voice!\n\nThere was another interval here.\n\n'Well, that isn't much good. I hate women's screechin' about fairies and\nflowers. Hang her! there's a scarecrow as sings at Curl's Divan. Such a\ncaterwauling upon a stage! I'd like to put my two barrels into her.'\n\nBy this time Dud's pipe was out, and he could afford to converse.\n\n'You shall see her and decide. You will walk down the river, and pass her\nby.'\n\n'That's as may be; howsoever, it would not do, nohow, to buy a pig in a\npoke, you know. And s'pose I shouldn't like her, arter all?'\n\nMadame sneered, with a patois ejaculation of derision.\n\n'Vary good! Then some one else will not be so 'ard to please--as you will\nsoon find.'\n\n'Some one's bin a-lookin' arter her, you mean?' said the young man, with a\nshrewd uneasy glance on the cunning face of the French lady.\n\n'I mean precisely--that which I mean,' replied the lady, with a teazing\npause at the break I have marked.\n\n'Come, old 'un, none of your d---- old chaff, if you want me to stay\nhere listening to you. Speak out, can't you? There's any chap as has bin\na-lookin' arter her--is there?'\n\n'Eh bien! I suppose some.'\n\n'Well, you _suppose,_ and _I_ suppose--we may _all_ suppose, I guess; but\nthat does not make a thing be, as wasn't before; and you tell me as how\nthe lass is kep' private up there, and will be till you're done educating\nher--a precious good 'un that is!' And he laughed a little lazily, with\nthe ivory handle of his cane on his lip, and eyeing Madame with indolent\nderision.\n\nMadame laughed, but looked rather dangerous.\n\n'I'm only chaffin', you know, old girl. _You_'ve bin chaffin'--w'y\nshouldn't _I_? But I don't see why she can't wait a bit; and what's all the\nd----d hurry for? _I_'m in no hurry. I don't want a wife on my back for a\nwhile. There's no fellow marries till he's took his bit o' fun, and seen\nlife--is there! And why should I be driving with her to fairs, or to\nchurch, or to meeting, by jingo!--for they say she's a Quaker--with a babby\non each knee, only to please them as will be dead and rotten when _I_'m\nonly beginning?'\n\n'Ah, you are such charming fellow; always the same--always sensible. So\nI and my friend we will walk home again, and you go see Maggie Hawkes.\nGood-a-by, Dud--good-a-by.'\n\n'Quiet, you fool!--can't ye?' said the young gentleman, with the sort of\ngrin that made his face vicious when a horse vexed him. 'Who ever said I\nwouldn't go look at the girl? Why, you know that's just what I come here\nfor--don't you? Only when I think a bit, and a notion comes across me, why\nshouldn't I speak out? I'm not one o' them shilly-shallies. If I like the\ngirl, I'll not be mug in and mug out about it. Only mind ye, I'll judge for\nmyself. Is that her a-coming?'\n\n'No; it was a distant sound.'\n\nMadame peeped round the corner. No one was approaching.\n\n'Well, you go round that a-way, and you only look at her, you know, for she\nis such fool--so nairvous.'\n\n'Oh, is that the way with her?' said Dud, knocking out the ashes of his\npipe on a tombstone, and replacing the Turkish utensil in his pocket.\n'Well, then, old lass, good-bye,' and he shook her hand. 'And, do ye see,\ndon't ye come up till I pass, for I'm no hand at play-acting; an' if you\ncalled me \"sir,\" or was coming it dignified and distant, you know, I'd be\nsure to laugh, a'most, and let all out. So good-bye, d'ye see, and if you\nwant me again be sharp to time, mind.\n\nFrom habit he looked about for his dogs, but he had not brought one. He had\ncome unostentatiously by rail, travelling in a third-class carriage, for\nthe advantage of Jack Briderly's company, and getting a world of useful\nwrinkles about the steeplechase that was coming off next week.\n\nSo he strode away, cutting off the heads of the nettles with his cane as he\nwent; and Madame walked forth into the open space among the graves, where I\nmight have seen her, had I stood up, looking with the absorbed gaze of an\nartist on the ruin.\n\nIn a little while, along the path, I heard the clank of a step, and the\ngentleman in the green cutaway coat, sucking his cane, and eyeing me\nwith an offensive familiar sort of stare the while, passed me by, rather\nhesitating as he did so. I was glad when he turned the corner in the little\nhollow close by, and disappeared. I stood up at once, and was reassured\nby a sight of Madame, not very many yards away, looking at the ruin, and\napparently restored to her right mind. The last beams of the sun were by\nthis time touching the uplands, and I was longing to recommence our walk\nhome. I was hesitating about calling to Madame, because that lady had a\ncertain spirit of opposition within her, and to disclose a small wish\nof any sort was generally, if it lay in her power, to prevent its\naccomplishment.\n\nAt this moment the gentleman in the green coat returned, approaching me\nwith a slow sort of swagger.\n\n'I say, Miss, I dropped a glove close by here. May you have seen it?'\n\n'No, sir,' I said, drawing back a little, and looking, I dare say, both\nfrightened and offended.\n\n'I do think I must 'a dropped it close by your foot, Miss.'\n\n'No, sir,' I repeated.\n\n'No offence, Miss, but you're sure you didn't hide it?'\n\nI was beginning to grow seriously uncomfortable.\n\n'Don't be frightened, Miss; it's only a bit o' chaff. I'm not going to\nsearch.'\n\nI called aloud, 'Madame, Madame!' and he whistled through his fingers, and\nshouted, 'Madame, Madame,' and added, 'She's as deaf as a tombstone, or\nshe'll hear that. Gi'e her my compliments, and say I said you're a beauty,\nMiss;' and with a laugh and a leer he strode off.\n\nAltogether this had not been a very pleasant excursion. Madame gobbled up\nour sandwiches, commending them every now and then to me. But I had been\ntoo much excited to have any appetite left, and very tired I was when we\nreached home.\n\n'So, there is lady coming to-morrow?' said Madame, who knew everything.\n'Wat is her name? I forget.'\n\n'Lady Knollys,' I answered.\n\n'Lady Knollys--wat odd name! She is very young--is she not?'\n\n'Past fifty, I think.'\n\n'H\u00c3\u00a9las! She's vary old, then. Is she rich?'\n\n'I don't know. She has a place in Derbyshire.'\n\n'Derbyshire--that is one of your English counties, is it not?'\n\n'Oh yes, Madame,' I answered, laughing. 'I have said it to you twice since\nyou came;' and I gabbled through the chief towns and rivers as catalogued\nin my geography.\n\n'Bah! to be sure--of course, cheaile. And is she your relation?'\n\n'Papa's first cousin.'\n\n'Won't you present-a me, pray?--I would so like!'\n\nMadame had fallen into the English way of liking people with titles, as\nperhaps foreigners would if titles implied the sort of power they do\ngenerally with us.\n\n'Certainly, Madame.'\n\n'You will not forget?'\n\n'Oh no.'\n\nMadame reminded me twice, in the course of the evening, of my promise.\nShe was very eager on this point. But it is a world of disappointment,\ninfluenza, and rheumatics; and next morning Madame was prostrate in her\nbed, and careless of all things but flannel and James's powder.\n\nMadame was _d\u00c3\u00a9sol\u00c3\u00a9e_; but she could not raise her head. She only murmured a\nquestion.\n\n'For 'ow long time, dear, will Lady Knollys remain?'\n\n'A very few days, I believe.'\n\n'H\u00c3\u00a9las! 'ow onlucky! maybe to-morrow I shall be better Ouah! my ear. The\nlaudanum, dear cheaile!'\n\nAnd so our conversation for that time ended, and Madame buried her head in\nher old red cashmere shawl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_MONICA KNOLLYS_\n\n\nPunctually Lady Knollys arrived. She was accompanied by her nephew, Captain\nOakley.\n\nThey arrived a little before dinner; just in time to get to their rooms and\ndress. But Mary Quince enlivened my toilet with eloquent descriptions of\nthe youthful Captain whom she had met in the gallery, on his way to his\nroom, with the servant, and told me how he stopped to let her pass, and how\n'he smiled so 'ansom.'\n\nI was very young then, you know, and more childish even than my years; but\nthis talk of Mary Quince's interested me, I must confess, considerably. I\nwas painting all sort of portraits of this heroic soldier, while affecting,\nI am afraid, a hypocritical indifference to her narration, and I know I was\nvery nervous and painstaking about my toilet that evening. When I went down\nto the drawing-room, Lady Knollys was there, talking volubly to my father\nas I entered--a woman not really old, but such as very young people fancy\naged--energetic, bright, saucy, dressed handsomely in purple satin, with a\ngood deal of lace, and a rich point--I know not how to call it--not a cap,\na sort of head-dress--light and simple, but grand withal, over her greyish,\nsilken hair.\n\nRather tall, by no means stout, on the whole a good firm figure, with\nsomething kindly in her look. She got up, quite like a young person, and\ncoming quickly to meet me with a smile--\n\n'My young cousin!' she cried, and kissed me on both cheeks. 'You know who\nI am? Your cousin Monica--Monica Knollys--and very glad, dear, to see you,\nthough she has not set eyes on you since you were no longer than that\npaper-knife. Now come here to the lamp, for I must look at you. Who is she\nlike? Let me see. Like your poor mother, I think, my dear; but you've the\nAylmer nose--yes--not a bad nose either, and, come! very good eyes, upon\nmy life--yes, certainly something of her poor mother--not a bit like you,\nAustin.'\n\nMy father gave her a look as near a smile as I had seen there for a long\ntime, shrewd, cynical, but kindly too, and said he--\n\n'So much the better, Monica, eh?'\n\n'It was not for me to say--but you know, Austin, you always were an ugly\ncreature. How shocked and indignant the little girl looks! You must not be\nvexed, you loyal little woman, with Cousin Monica for telling the truth.\nPapa was and will be ugly all his days. Come, Austin, dear, tell her--is\nnot it so?'\n\n'What! depose against myself! That's not English law, Monica.'\n\n'Well, maybe not; but if the child won't believe her own eyes, how is she\nto believe me? She has long, pretty hands--you have--and very nice feet\ntoo. How old is she?'\n\n'How old, child?' said my father to me, transferring the question.\n\nShe recurred again to my eyes.\n\n'That is the true grey--large, deep, soft--very peculiar. Yes, dear, very\npretty--long lashes, and such bright tints! You'll be in the Book of\nBeauty, my dear, when you come out, and have all the poet people writing\nverses to the tip of your nose--and a very pretty little nose it is!'\n\nI must mention here how striking was the change in my father's spirit while\ntalking and listening to his odd and voluble old Cousin Monica. Reflected\nfrom bygone associations, there had come a glimmer of something, not\ngaiety, indeed, but like an appreciation of gaiety. The gloom and\ninflexibility were gone, and there was an evident encouragement and\nenjoyment of the incessant sallies of his bustling visitor.\n\nHow morbid must have been the tendencies of his habitual solitude, I think,\nappeared from the evident thawing and brightening that accompanied even\nthis transient gleam of human society. I was not a companion--more childish\nthan most girls of my age, and trained in all his whimsical ways, never to\ninterrupt a silence, or force his thoughts by unexpected question or remark\nout of their monotonous or painful channel.\n\nI was as much surprised at the good-humour with which he submitted to\nhis cousin's saucy talk; and, indeed, just then those black-panelled and\npictured walls, and that quaint, misshapen room, seemed to have exchanged\ntheir stern and awful character for something wonderfully pleasanter to me,\nnotwithstanding the unpleasantness of the personal criticism to which the\nplain-spoken lady chose to subject me.\n\nJust at that moment Captain Oakley joined us. He was my first actual vision\nof that awful and distant world of fashion, of whose splendours I had\nalready read something in the three-volumed gospel of the circulating\nlibrary.\n\nHandsome, elegant, with features almost feminine, and soft, wavy, black\nhair, whiskers and moustache, he was altogether such a knight as I had\nnever beheld, or even fancied, at Knowl--a hero of another species, and\nfrom the region of the demigods. I did not then perceive that coldness of\nthe eye, and cruel curl of the voluptuous lip--only a suspicion, yet enough\nto indicate the profligate man, and savouring of death unto death.\n\nBut I was young, and had not yet the direful knowledge of good and evil\nthat comes with years; and he was so very handsome, and talked in a way\nthat was so new to me, and was so much more charming than the well-bred\nconverse of the humdrum county families with whom I had occasionally\nsojourned for a week at a time.\n\nIt came out incidentally that his leave of absence was to expire the\nday after to-morrow. A Lilliputian pang of disappointment followed this\nannouncement. Already I was sorry to lose him. So soon we begin to make a\nproperty of what pleases us.\n\nI was shy, but not awkward. I was flattered by the attention of this\namusing, perhaps rather fascinating, young man of the world; and he plainly\naddressed himself with diligence to amuse and please me. I dare say there\nwas more effort than I fancied in bringing his talk down to my humble\nlevel, and interesting me and making me laugh about people whom I had never\nheard of before, than I then suspected.\n\nCousin Knollys meanwhile was talking to papa. It was just the conversation\nthat suited a man so silent as habit had made him, for her frolic fluency\nleft him little to supply. It was totally impossible, indeed, even in our\ntaciturn household, that conversation should ever flag while she was among\nus.\n\nCousin Knollys and I went into the drawing-room together, leaving the\ngentlemen--rather ill-assorted, I fear--to entertain one another for a\ntime.\n\n'Come here, my dear, and sit near me,' said Lady Knollys, dropping into an\neasy chair with an energetic little plump, 'and tell me how you and your\npapa get on. I can remember him quite a cheerful man once, and rather\namusing--yes, indeed--and now you see what a bore he is--all by shutting\nhimself up and nursing his whims and fancies. Are those your drawings,\ndear?'\n\n'Yes, very bad, I'm afraid; but there are a few, _better_, I think in the\nportfolio in the cabinet in the hall.'\n\n'They are by _no_ means bad, my dear; and you play, of course?'\n\n'Yes--that is, a little--pretty well, I hope.'\n\n'I dare say. I must hear you by-and-by. And how does your papa amuse you?\nYou look bewildered, dear. Well, I dare say, amusement is not a frequent\nword in this house. But you must not turn into a nun, or worse, into a\npuritan. What is he? A Fifth-Monarchy-man, or something--I forget; tell me\nthe name, my dear.'\n\n'Papa is a Swedenborgian, I believe.'\n\n'Yes, yes--I forgot the horrid name--a Swedenborgian, that is it. I don't\nknow exactly what they think, but everyone knows they are a sort of pagans,\nmy dear. He's not making one of _you_, dear--is he?'\n\n'I go to church every Sunday.'\n\n'Well, that's a mercy; Swedenborgian is such an ugly name, and besides,\nthey are all likely to be damned, my dear, and that's a serious\nconsideration. I really wish poor Austin had hit on something else; I'd\nmuch rather have no religion, and enjoy life while I'm in it, than choose\none to worry me here and bedevil me hereafter. But some people, my dear,\nhave a taste for being miserable, and provide, like poor Austin, for its\ngratification in the next world as well as here. Ha, ha, ha! how grave the\nlittle woman looks! Don't you think me very wicked? You know you do; and\nvery likely you are right. Who makes your dresses, my dear? You _are_ such\na figure of fun!'\n\n'Mrs. Rusk, I think, ordered _this_ dress. I and Mary Quince planned it. I\nthought it very nice. We all like it very well.'\n\nThere was something, I dare say, very whimsical about it, probably very\nabsurd, judged at least by the canons of fashion, and old Cousin Monica\nKnollys, in whose eye the London fashions were always fresh, was palpably\nstruck by it as if it had been some enormity against anatomy, for she\ncertainly laughed very heartily; indeed, there were tears on her cheeks\nwhen she had done, and I am sure my aspect of wonder and dignity, as her\nhilarity proceeded, helped to revive her merriment again and again as it\nwas subsiding.\n\n'There, you mustn't be vexed with old Cousin Monica,' she cried, jumping\nup, and giving me a little hug, and bestowing a hearty kiss on my forehead,\nand a jolly little slap on my cheek. 'Always remember your cousin Monica is\nan outspoken, wicked old fool, who likes you, and never be offended by her\nnonsense. A council of three--you all sat upon it--Mrs. Rusk, you said, and\nMary Quince, and your wise self, the weird sisters; and Austin stepped in,\nas Macbeth, and said, 'What is't ye do?' you all made answer together, 'A\nsomething or other without a name!' Now, seriously, my dear, it is quite\nunpardonable in Austin--your papa, I mean--to hand you over to be robed and\nbedizened according to the whimsies of these wild old women--aren't they\nold? If they know better, it's positively _fiendish._ I'll blow him up--I\nwill indeed, my dear. You know you're an heiress, and ought not to appear\nlike a jack-pudding.'\n\n'Papa intends sending me to London with Madame and Mary Quince, and going\nwith me himself, if Doctor Bryerly says he may make the journey, and then I\nam to have dresses and everything.'\n\n'Well, that is better. And who is Doctor Bryerly--is your papa ill?'\n\n'Ill; oh no; he always seems just the same. You don't think him\nill--_looking_ ill, I mean?' I asked eagerly and frightened.\n\n'No, my dear, he looks very well for his time of life; but why is Doctor\nWhat's-his-name here? Is he a physician, or a divine, or a horse-doctor?\nand why is his leave asked?'\n\n'I--I really don't understand.'\n\n'Is he a what d'ye call'em--a Swedenborgian?'\n\n'I believe so.'\n\n'Oh, I see; ha, ha, ha! And so poor Austin must ask leave to go up to town.\nWell, go he shall, whether his doctor likes it or not, for it would not do\nto send you there in charge of your Frenchwoman, my dear. What's her name?'\n\n'Madame de la Rougierre.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_LADY KNOLLYS REMOVES A COVERLET_\n\n\nLady Knollys pursued her enquiries.\n\n'And why does not Madame make your dresses, my dear? I wager a guinea the\nwoman's a milliner. Did not she engage to make your dresses?'\n\n'I--I really don't know; I rather think not. She is my governess--a\nfinishing governess, Mrs. Rusk says.'\n\n'Finishing fiddle! Hoity-toity! and my lady's too grand to cut out your\ndresses and help to sew them? And what _does_ she do? I venture to say\nshe's fit to teach nothing but devilment--not that she has taught _you_\nmuch, my dear--_yet_ at least. I'll see her, my dear; where is she? Come,\nlet us visit Madame. I should so like to talk to her a little.'\n\n'But she is ill,' I answered, and all this time I was ready to cry for\nvexation, thinking of my dress, which must be very absurd to elicit so much\nunaffected laughter from my experienced relative, and I was only longing to\nget away and hide myself before that handsome Captain returned.\n\n'Ill! is she? what's the matter?'\n\n'A cold--feverish and rheumatic, she says.'\n\n'Oh, a cold; is she up, or in bed?'\n\n'In her room, but not in bed.'\n\n'I should so like to see her, my dear. It is not mere curiosity, I assure\nyou. In fact, curiosity has nothing on earth to do with it. A governess may\nbe a very useful or a very useless person; but she may also be about the\nmost pernicious inmate imaginable. She may teach you a bad accent, and\nworse manners, and heaven knows what beside. Send the housekeeper, my dear,\nto tell her that I am going to see her.'\n\n'I had better go myself, perhaps,' I said, fearing a collision between Mrs.\nRusk and the bitter Frenchwoman.\n\n'Very well, dear.'\n\nAnd away I ran, not sorry somehow to escape before Captain Oakley returned.\n\nAs I went along the passage, I was thinking whether my dress could be\nso very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it, and trying in vain to\nrecollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of\nthat beautiful and garrulous dandy. I could not--quite the reverse, indeed.\nStill I was uncomfortable and feverish--girls of my then age will easily\nconceive how miserable, under similar circumstances, such a misgiving would\nmake them.\n\nIt was a long way to Madame's room. I met Mrs. Rusk bustling along the\npassage with a housemaid.\n\n'How is Madame?' I asked.\n\n'Quite well, I believe,' answered the housekeeper, drily. 'Nothing the\nmatter that _I_ know of. She eat enough for two to-day. I wish _I_ could\nsit in my room doing nothing.'\n\nMadame was sitting, or rather reclining, in a low arm-chair, when I entered\nthe room, close to the fire, as was her wont, her feet extended near to the\nbars, and a little coffee equipage beside her. She stuffed a book hastily\nbetween her dress and the chair, and received me in a state of langour\nwhich, had it not been for Mrs. Rusk's comfortable assurances, would have\nfrightened me.\n\n'I hope you are better, Madame,' I said, approaching.\n\n'Better than I deserve, my dear cheaile, sufficiently well. The people\nare all so good, trying me with every little thing, like a bird; here is\ncaf\u00c3\u00a9--Mrs. Rusk-a, poor woman, I try to swallow a little to please her.'\n\n'And your cold, is it better?'\n\nShe shook her head languidly, her elbow resting on the chair, and three\nfinger-tips supporting her forehead, and then she made a little sigh,\nlooking down from the corners of her eyes, in an interesting dejection.\n\n'Je sens des lassitudes in all the members--but I am quaite 'appy, and\nthough I suffer I am console and oblige des bont\u00c3\u00a9s, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re, que vous\navez tous pour moi;' and with these words she turned a languid glance of\ngratitude on me which dropped on the ground.\n\n'Lady Knollys wishes very much to see you, only for a few minutes, if you\ncould admit her.'\n\n'Vous savez les malades see _never_ visitors,' she replied with a startled\nsort of tartness, and a momentary energy. 'Besides, I cannot converse; je\nsens de temps en temps des douleurs de t\u00c3\u00aate--of head, and of the ear, the\nright ear, it is parfois agony absolutely, and now it is here.'\n\nAnd she winced and moaned, with her eyes closed and her hand pressed to the\norgan affected.\n\nSimple as I was, I felt instinctively that Madame was shamming. She was\nover-acting; her transitions were too violent, and beside she forgot that\nI knew how well she could speak English, and must perceive that she was\nheightening the interest of her helplessness by that pretty tessellation\nof foreign idiom. I therefore said with a kind of courage which sometimes\nhelped me suddenly--\n\n'Oh, Madame, don't you really think you might, without much inconvenience,\nsee Lady Knollys for a very few minutes?'\n\n'Cruel cheaile! you know I have a pain of the ear which makes me 'orribly\nsuffer at this moment, and you demand me whether I will not converse\nwith strangers. I did not think you would be so unkain, Maud; but it is\nimpossible, you must see--quite impossible. I never, you _know_, refuse to\ntake trouble when I am able--never--_never_.'\n\nAnd Madame shed some tears, which always came at call, and with her hand\npressed to her ear, said very faintly,\n\n'Be so good to tell your friend how you see me, and how I suffer, and leave\nme, Maud, for I wish to lie down for a little, since the pain will not\nallow me to remain longer.'\n\nSo with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused, but I dare\nsay betraying my suspicion that more was made of her sufferings than need\nbe, I returned to the drawing-room.\n\n'Captain Oakley has been here, my dear, and fancying, I suppose, that you\nhad left us for the evening, has gone to the billiard-room, I think,' said\nLady Knollys, as I entered.\n\nThat, then, accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which I had heard\nas I passed the door.\n\n'I have been telling Maud how detestably she is got up.'\n\n'Very thoughtful of you, Monica!' said my father.\n\n'Yes, and really, Austin, it is quite clear you ought to marry; you want\nsome one to take this girl out, and look after her, and who's to do it?\nShe's a dowdy--don't you see? Such a dust! And it _is_ really such a pity;\nfor she's a very pretty creature, and a clever woman could make her quite\ncharming.'\n\nMy father took Cousin Monica's sallies with the most wonderful good-humour.\nShe had always, I fancy, been a privileged person, and my father, whom we\nall feared, received her jolly attacks, as I fancy the grim Front-de-Boeufs\nof old accepted the humours and personalities of their jesters.\n\n'Am I to accept this as an overture?' said my father to his voluble cousin.\n\n'Yes, you may, but not for myself, Austin--I'm not worthy. Do you remember\nlittle Kitty Weadon that I wanted you to marry eight-and-twenty years ago,\nor more, with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds? Well, you know, she\nhas got ever so much now, and she is really a most amiable old thing, and\nthough _you_ would not have her then, she has had her second husband since,\nI can tell you.'\n\n'I'm glad I was not the first,' said my father.\n\n'Well, they really say her wealth is absolutely immense. Her last husband,\nthe Russian merchant, left her everything. She has not a human relation,\nand she is in the best set.'\n\n'You were always a match-maker, Monica,' said my father, stopping, and\nputting his hand kindly on hers. 'But it won't do. No, no, Monica; we must\ntake care of little Maud some other way.'\n\nI was relieved. We women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages,\nand think that no widower is quite above or below that danger; and I\nremember, whenever my father, which indeed was but seldom, made a visit to\ntown or anywhere else, it was a saying of Mrs. Rusk--\n\n'I shan't wonder, neither need you, my dear, if he brings home a young wife\nwith him.'\n\nSo my father, with a kind look at her, and a very tender one on me, went\nsilently to the library, as he often did about that hour.\n\nI could not help resenting my Cousin Knollys' officious recommendation of\nmatrimony. Nothing I dreaded more than a step-mother. Good Mrs. Rusk\nand Mary Quince, in their several ways, used to enhance, by occasional\nanecdotes and frequent reflections, the terrors of such an intrusion. I\nsuppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at Knowl,\nand thought it no harm to excite my vigilance.\n\nBut it was impossible long to be vexed with Cousin Monica.\n\n'You know, my dear, your father is an oddity,' she said. 'I don't mind\nhim--I never did. You must not. Cracky, my dear, cracky--decidedly cracky!'\n\nAnd she tapped the corner of her forehead, with a look so sly and comical,\nthat I think I should have laughed, if the sentiment had not been so\nawfully irreverent.\n\n'Well, dear, how is our friend the milliner?'\n\n'Madame is suffering so much from pain in her ear, that she says it would\nbe quite impossible to have the honour--'\n\n'Honour--fiddle! I want to see what the woman's like. Pain in her ear, you\nsay? Poor thing! Well, dear, I think I can cure that in five minutes. I\nhave it myself, now and then. Come to my room, and we'll get the bottles.\n\nSo she lighted her candle in the lobby, and with a light and agile step\nshe scaled the stairs, I following; and having found the remedies, we\napproached Madame's room together.\n\nI think, while we were still at the end of the gallery, Madame heard and\ndivined our approach, for her door suddenly shut, and there was a fumbling\nat the handle. But the bolt was out of order.\n\nLady Knollys tapped at the door, saying--'we'll come in, please, and see\nyou. I've some remedies, which I'm sure will do you good.'\n\nThere was no answer; so she opened the door, and we both entered. Madame\nhad rolled herself in the blue coverlet, and was lying on the bed, with her\nface buried in the pillow, and enveloped in the covering.\n\n'Perhaps she's asleep?' said Lady Knollys, getting round to the side of the\nbed, and stooping over her.\n\nMadame lay still as a mouse. Cousin Monica set down her two little vials\non the table, and, stooping again over the bed, began very gently with\nher fingers to lift the coverlet that covered her face. Madame uttered\na slumbering moan, and turned more upon her face, clasping the coverlet\nfaster about her.\n\n'Madame, it is Maud and Lady Knollys. We have come to relieve your ear.\nPray let me see it. She can't be asleep, she's holding the clothes so fast.\nDo, pray, allow me to see it.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_LADY KNOLLYS SEES THE FEATURES_\n\n\nPerhaps, if Madame had murmured, 'It is quite well--pray permit me to\nsleep,' she would have escaped an awkwardness. But having adopted the r\u00c3\u00b4le\nof the exhausted slumberer, she could not consistently speak at the moment;\nneither would it do by main force, to hold the coverlet about her face, and\nso her presence of mind forsook her. Cousin Monica drew it back and hardly\nbeheld the profile of the sufferer, when her good-humoured face was lined\nand shadowed with a dark curiosity and a surprise by no means pleasant. She\nstood erect beside the bed, with her mouth firmly shut and drawn down at\nthe corners, in a sort of recoil and perturbation, looking down upon the\npatient.\n\n'So that's Madame de la Rougierre?' at length exclaimed Lady Knollys, with\na very stately disdain. I think I never saw anyone look more shocked.\n\nMadame sat up, very flushed. No wonder, for she had been wrapped so close\nin the coverlet. She did not look quite at Lady Knollys, but straight\nbefore her, rather downward, and very luridly.\n\nI was very much frightened and amazed, and felt on the point of bursting\ninto tears.\n\n'So, Mademoiselle, you have married, it seems, since I had last the honour\nof seeing you? I did not recognise Mademoiselle under her new name.'\n\n'Yes--I _am_ married, Lady Knollys; I thought everyone who knew me had\nheard of that. Very respectably married, for a person of my rank. I shall\nnot need long the life of a governess. There is no harm, I hope?'\n\n'I hope not,' said Lady Knollys, drily, a little pale, and still looking\nwith a dark sort of wonder upon the flushed face and forehead of the\ngoverness, who was looking downward, straight before her, very sulkily and\ndisconcerted.\n\n'I suppose you have explained everything satisfactorily to Mr. Ruthyn, in\nwhose house I find you?' said Cousin Monica.\n\n'Yes, certainly, everything he requires--in effect there is _nothing_ to\nexplain. I am ready to answer to any question. Let _him_ demand me.'\n\n'Very good, Mademoiselle.'\n\n'_Madame_, if you please.'\n\n'I forgot--_Madame_--yes, I shall apprise him of everything.'\n\nMadame turned upon her a peaked and malign look, smiling askance with a\nstealthy scorn.\n\n'For myself, I have nothing to conceal. I have always done my duty. What\nfine scene about nothing absolutely--what charming remedies for a sick\nperson! Ma foi! how much oblige I am for these so amiable attentions!'\n\n'So far as I can see, Mademoiselle--Madame, I mean--you don't stand very\nmuch in need of remedies. Your ear and head don't seem to trouble you just\nnow. I fancy these pains may now be dismissed.'\n\nLady Knollys was now speaking French.\n\n'Mi ladi has diverted my attention for a moment, but that does not prevent\nthat I suffer frightfully. I am, of course, only poor governess, and such\npeople perhaps ought not to have pain--at least to show when they suffer.\nIt is permitted us to die, but not to be sick.'\n\n'Come, Maud, my dear, let us leave the invalid to her repose and to nature.\nI don't think she needs my chloroform and opium at present.'\n\n'Mi ladi is herself a physic which chases many things, and powerfully\naffects the ear. I would wish to sleep, notwithstanding, and can but gain\nthat in silence, if it pleases mi ladi.'\n\n'Come, my dear,' said Lady Knollys, without again glancing at the scowling,\nsmiling, swarthy face in the bed; 'let us leave your instructress to her\n_concforto_.'\n\n'The room smells all over of brandy, my dear--does she drink?' said Lady\nKnollys, as she closed the door, a little sharply.\n\nI am sure I looked as much amazed as I felt, at an imputation which then\nseemed to me so entirely incredible.\n\n'Good little simpleton!' said Cousin Monica, smiling in my face, and\nbestowing a little kiss on my cheek; 'such a thing as a tipsy lady has\nnever been dreamt of in your philosophy. Well, we live and learn. Let us\nhave our tea in my room--the gentlemen, I dare say, have retired.'\n\nI assented, of course, and we had tea very cosily by her bedroom fire.\n\n'How long have you had that woman?' she asked suddenly, after, for her, a\nvery long rumination.\n\n'She came in the beginning of February--nearly ten months ago--is not it?'\n\n'And who sent her?'\n\n'I really don't know; papa tells me so little--he arranged it all himself,\nI think.'\n\nCousin Monica made a sound of acquiescence--her lips closed and a nod,\nfrowning hard at the bars.\n\n'It _is_ very odd!' she said; 'how people _can_ be such fools!' Here there\ncame a little pause. 'And what sort of person is she--do you like her?'\n\n'Very well--that is, _pretty_ well. You won't tell?--but she rather\nfrightens me. I'm sure she does not intend it, but somehow I am very much\nafraid of her.'\n\n'She does not beat you?' said Cousin Monica, with an incipient frenzy in\nher face that made me love her.\n\n'Oh no!'\n\n'Nor ill-use you in any way?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Upon your honour and word, Maud?'\n\n'No, upon my honour.'\n\n'You know I won't tell her anything you say to me; and I only want to know,\nthat I may put an end to it, my poor little cousin.'\n\n'Thank you, Cousin Monica very much; but really and truly she does not\nill-use me.'\n\n'Nor threaten you, child?'\n\n'Well, _no_--no, she does not threaten.'\n\n'And how the plague _does_ she frighten you, child?'\n\n'Well, I really--I'm half ashamed to tell you--you'll laugh at me--and I\ndon't know that she wishes to frighten me. But there is something, is not\nthere, ghosty, you know, about her?'\n\n'_Ghosty_--is there? well, I'm sure I don't know, but I suspect there's\nsomething devilish--I mean, she seems roguish--does not she? And I really\nthink she has had neither cold nor pain, but has just been shamming\nsickness, to keep out of my way.'\n\nI perceived plainly enough that Cousin Monica's damnatory epithet referred\nto some retrospective knowledge, which she was not going to disclose to me.\n\n'You knew Madame before,' I said. 'Who is she?'\n\n'She assures me she is Madame de la Rougierre, and, I suppose, in French\nphrase she so calls herself,' answered Lady Knollys, with a laugh, but\nuncomfortably, I thought.\n\n'Oh, dear Cousin Monica, do tell me--is she--is she very wicked? I am so\nafraid of her!'\n\n'How should I know, dear Maud? But I do remember her face, and I don't very\nmuch like her, and you may depend on it. I will speak to your father in the\nmorning about her, and don't, darling, ask me any more about her, for I\nreally have not very much to tell that you would care to hear, and the fact\nis I _won't_ say any more about her--there!'\n\nAnd Cousin Monica laughed, and gave me a little slap on the cheek, and then\na kiss.\n\n'Well, just tell me this----'\n\n'Well, I _won't_ tell you this, nor anything--not a word, curious little\nwoman. The fact is, I have little to tell, and I mean to speak to your\nfather, and he, I am sure, will do what is right; so don't ask me any more,\nand let us talk of something pleasanter.'\n\nThere was something indescribably winning, it seemed to me, in Cousin\nMonica. Old as she was, she seemed to me so girlish, compared with those\nslow, unexceptionable young ladies whom I had met in my few visits at the\ncounty houses. By this time my shyness was quite gone, and I was on the\nmost intimate terms with her.\n\n'You know a great deal about her, Cousin Monica, but you won't tell me.'\n\n'Nothing I should like better, if I were at liberty, little rogue; but you\nknow, after all, I don't really say whether I _do_ know anything about\nher or not, or what sort of knowledge it is. But tell me what you mean by\nghosty, and all about it.'\n\nSo I recounted my experiences, to which, so far from laughing at me, she\nlistened with very special gravity.\n\n'Does she write and receive many letters?'\n\nI had seen her write letters, and supposed, though I could only recollect\none or two, that she received in proportion.\n\n'Are _you_ Mary Quince?' asked my lady cousin.\n\nMary was arranging the window-curtains, and turned, dropping a courtesy\naffirmatively toward her.\n\n'You wait on my little cousin, Miss Ruthyn, don't you?'\n\n'Yes, 'm,' said Mary, in her genteelest way.\n\n'Does anyone sleep in her room?'\n\n'Yes, 'm, _I_--please, my lady.'\n\n'And no one else?'\n\n'No, 'm--please, my lady.'\n\n'Not even the _governess_, sometimes?\n\n'No, please, my lady.'\n\n'Never, you are quite sure, my dear?' said Lady Knollys, transferring the\nquestion to me.\n\n'Oh, no, never,' I answered.\n\nCousin Monica mused gravely, I fancied even anxiously, into the grate; then\nstirred her tea and sipped it, still looking into the same point of our\ncheery fire.\n\n'I like your face, Mary Quince; I'm sure you are a good creature,' she\nsaid, suddenly turning toward her with a pleasant countenance. 'I'm very\nglad you have got her, dear. I wonder whether Austin has gone to his bed\nyet!'\n\n'I think not. I am certain he is either in the library or in his private\nroom--papa often reads or prays alone at night, and--and he does not like\nto be interrupted.'\n\n'No, no; of course not--it will do very well in the morning.'\n\nLady Knollys was thinking deeply, as it seemed to me.\n\n'And so you are afraid of goblins, my dear,' she said at last, with a faded\nsort of smile, turning toward me; 'well, if _I_ were, I know what _I_\nshould do--so soon as I, and good Mary Quince here, had got into my\nbed-chamber for the night, I should stir the fire into a good blaze, and\nbolt the door--do you see, Mary Quince?--bolt the door and keep a candle\nlighted all night. You'll be very attentive to her, Mary Quince, for I--I\ndon't think she is very strong, and she must not grow nervous: so get to\nbed early, and don't leave her alone--do you see?--and--and remember to\nbolt the door, Mary Quince, and I shall be sending a little Christmas-box\nto my cousin, and I shan't forget you. Good-night.'\n\nAnd with a pleasant courtesy Mary fluttered out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_A CURIOUS CONVERSATION_\n\n\nWe each had another cup of tea, and were silent for awhile.\n\n'We must not talk of ghosts now. You are a superstitious little woman, you\nknow, and you shan't be frightened.'\n\nAnd now Cousin Monica grew silent again, and looking briskly around the\nroom, like a lady in search of a subject, her eye rested on a small oval\nportrait, graceful, brightly tinted, in the French style, representing\na pretty little boy, with rich golden hair, large soft eyes, delicate\nfeatures, and a shy, peculiar expression.\n\n'It is odd; I think I remember that pretty little sketch, very long ago. I\nthink I was then myself a child, but that is a much older style of dress,\nand of wearing the hair, too, than I ever saw. I am just forty-nine now. Oh\ndear, yes; that is a good while before I was _born_. What a strange, pretty\nlittle boy! a mysterious little fellow. Is he quite sincere, I wonder? What\nrich golden hair! It is very clever--a French artist, I dare say--and who\n_is_ that little boy?'\n\n'I never heard. Some one a hundred years ago, I dare say. But there is a\npicture down-stairs I am so anxious to ask you about!'\n\n'Oh!' murmured Lady Knollys, still gazing dreamily on the crayon.\n\n'It is the full-length picture of Uncle Silas--I want to ask you about\nhim.'\n\nAt mention of his name, my cousin gave me a look so sudden and odd as to\namount almost to a start.\n\n'Your uncle Silas, dear? It is very odd, I was just thinking of him;' and\nshe laughed a little.\n\n'Wondering whether that little boy could be he.'\n\nAnd up jumped active Cousin Monica, with a candle in her hand, upon a\nchair, and scrutinised the border of the sketch for a name or a date.\n\n'Maybe on the back?' said she.\n\nAnd so she unhung it, and there, true enough, not on the back of the\ndrawing, but of the frame, which was just as good, in pen-and-ink round\nItalian letters, hardly distinguishable now from the discoloured wood, we\ntraced--\n\n'_Silas Aylmer Ruthyn, AEtate_ viii. 15 _May_, 1779.'\n\n'It is very odd I should not have been told or remembered who it was.\nI think if I had _ever_ been told I _should_ have remembered it. I do\nrecollect this picture, though, I am nearly certain. What a singular\nchild's face!'\n\nAnd my cousin leaned over it with a candle on each side, and her hand\nshading her eyes, as if seeking by aid of these fair and half-formed\nlineaments to read an enigma.\n\nThe childish features defied her, I suppose; their secret was unfathomable,\nfor after a good while she raised her head, still looking at the portrait,\nand sighed.\n\n'A very singular face,' she said, softly, as a person might who was looking\ninto a coffin. 'Had not we better replace it?'\n\nSo the pretty oval, containing the fair golden hair and large eyes, the\npale, unfathomable sphinx, remounted to its nail, and the _funeste_ and\nbeautiful child seemed to smile down oracularly on our conjectures.\n\n'So is the face in the large portrait--_very_ singular--more, I think, than\nthat--handsomer too. This is a sickly child, I think; but the full-length\nis so manly, though so slender, and so handsome too. I always think him a\nhero and a mystery, and they won't tell me about him, and I can only dream\nand wonder.'\n\n'He has made more people than you dream and wonder, my dear Maud. I don't\nknow what to make of him. He is a sort of idol, you know, of your father's,\nand yet I don't think he helps him much. His abilities were singular; so\nhas been his misfortune; for the rest, my dear, he is neither a hero nor a\nwonder. So far as I know, there are very few sublime men going about the\nworld.'\n\n'You really must tell me all you know about him, Cousin Monica. Now don't\nrefuse.'\n\n'But why should you care to hear? There is really nothing pleasant to\ntell.'\n\n'That is just the reason I wish it. If it were at all pleasant, it would be\nquite commonplace. I like to hear of adventures, dangers, and misfortunes;\nand above all, I love a mystery. You know, papa will never tell me, and I\ndare not ask him; not that he is ever unkind, but, somehow, I am afraid;\nand neither Mrs. Rusk nor Mary Quince will tell me anything, although I\nsuspect they know a good deal.'\n\n'I don't see any good in telling you, dear, nor, to say the truth, any\ngreat harm either.'\n\n'No--now that's _quite_ true--no harm. There _can't_ be, for I _must_ know\nit all some day, you know, and better now, and from _you_, than perhaps\nfrom a stranger, and in a less favourable way.'\n\n'Upon my word, it is a wise little woman; and really, that's not such bad\nsense after all.'\n\nSo we poured out another cup of tea each, and sipped it very comfortably by\nthe fire, while Lady Knollys talked on, and her animated face helped the\nstrange story.\n\n'It is not very much, after all. Your uncle Silas, you know, is living?'\n\n'Oh yes, in Derbyshire.'\n\n'So I see you do know something of him, sly girl! but no matter. You know\nhow very rich your father is; but Silas was the younger brother, and had\nlittle more than a thousand a year. If he had not played, and did not care\nto marry, it would have been quite enough--ever so much more than younger\nsons of dukes often have; but he was--well, a _mauvais sujet_--you know\nwhat that is. I don't want to say any ill of him--more than I really\nknow--but he was fond of his pleasures, I suppose, like other young men,\nand he played, and was always losing, and your father for a long time paid\ngreat sums for him. I believe he was really a most expensive and vicious\nyoung man; and I fancy he does not deny that now, for they say he would\nchange the past if he could.\n\nI was looking at the pensive little boy in the oval frame--aged eight\nyears--who was, a few springs later, 'a most expensive and vicious young\nman,' and was now a suffering and outcast old one, and wondering from what\na small seed the hemlock or the wallflower grows, and how microscopic are\nthe beginnings of the kingdom of God or of the mystery of iniquity in a\nhuman being's heart.\n\n'Austin--your papa--was very kind to him--_very_; but then, you know,\nhe's an oddity, dear--he _is_ an oddity, though no one may have told you\nbefore--and he never forgave him for his marriage. Your father, I suppose,\nknew more about the lady than I did--I was young then--but there were\nvarious reports, none of them pleasant, and she was not visited, and for\nsome time there was a complete estrangement between your father and your\nuncle Silas; and it was made up, rather oddly, on the very occasion which\nsome people said ought to have totally separated them. Did you ever hear\nanything--anything _very_ remarkable--about your uncle?'\n\n'No, never, they would not tell me, though I am sure they know. Pray go\non.'\n\n'Well, Maud, as I have begun, I'll complete the story, though perhaps it\nmight have been better untold. It was something rather shocking--indeed,\n_very_ shocking; in fact, they insisted on suspecting him of having\ncommitted a murder.'\n\nI stared at my cousin for some time, and then at the little boy, so\nrefined, so beautiful, so _funeste_, in the oval frame.\n\n'Yes, dear,' said she, her eyes following mine; 'who'd have supposed he\ncould ever have--have fallen under so horrible a suspicion?'\n\n'The wretches! Of course, Uncle Silas--of course, he's innocent?' I said at\nlast.\n\n'Of course, my dear,' said Cousin Monica, with an odd look; 'but you know\nthere are some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done, and\nthe country gentlemen chose to suspect him. They did not like him, you\nsee. His politics vexed them; and he resented their treatment of his\nwife--though I really think, poor Silas, he did not care a pin about\nher--and he annoyed them whenever he could. Your papa, you know, is very\nproud of his family--_he_ never had the slightest suspicion of your uncle.'\n\n'Oh no!' I cried vehemently.\n\n'That's right, Maud Ruthyn,' said Cousin Monica, with a sad little smile\nand a nod. 'And your papa was, you may suppose, very angry.'\n\n'Of course he was,' I exclaimed.\n\n'You have no idea, my dear, _how_ angry. He directed his attorney to\nprosecute, by wholesale, all who had said a word affecting your uncle's\ncharacter. But the lawyers were against it, and then your uncle tried to\nfight his way through it, but the men would not meet him. He was quite\nslurred. Your father went up and saw the Minister. He wanted to have him a\nDeputy-Lieutenant, or something, in his county. Your papa, you know, had a\nvery great influence with the Government. Beside his county influence, he\nhad two boroughs then. But the Minister was afraid, the feeling was so very\nstrong. They offered him something in the Colonies, but your father would\nnot hear of it--that would have been a banishment, you know. They would\nhave given your father a peerage to make it up, but he would not accept\nit, and broke with the party. Except in that way--which, you know, was\nconnected with the reputation of the family--I don't think, considering his\ngreat wealth, he has done very much for Silas. To say truth, however, he\nwas very liberal before his marriage. Old Mrs. Aylmer says he made a vow\n_then_ that Silas should never have more than five hundred a year, which he\nstill allows him, I believe, and he permits him to live in the place. But\nthey say it is in a very wild, neglected state.'\n\n'You live in the same county--have you seen it lately, Cousin Monica?'\n\n'No, not very lately,' said Cousin Monica, and began to hum an air\nabstractedly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n_BEFORE AND AFTER BREAKFAST_\n\n\nNext morning early I visited my favourite full-length portrait in the\nchocolate coat and top-boots. Scanty as had been my cousin Monica's notes\nupon this dark and eccentric biography, they were everything to me. A soul\nhad entered that enchanted form. Truth had passed by with her torch, and a\nsad light shone for a moment on that enigmatic face.\n\nThere stood the _rou\u00c3\u00a9_--the duellist--and, with all his faults, the hero\ntoo! In that dark large eye lurked the profound and fiery enthusiasm of his\nill-starred passion. In the thin but exquisite lip I read the courage of\nthe paladin, who would have 'fought his way,' though single-handed, against\nall the magnates of his county, and by ordeal of battle have purged the\nhonour of the Ruthyns. There in that delicate half-sarcastic tracery of the\nnostril I detected the intellectual defiance which had politically isolated\nSilas Ruthyn and opposed him to the landed oligarchy of his county, whose\nretaliation had been a hideous slander. There, too, and on his brows and\nlip, I traced the patience of a cold disdain. I could now see him as he\nwas--the prodigal, the hero, and the martyr. I stood gazing on him with a\ngirlish interest and admiration. There was indignation, there was pity,\nthere was hope. Some day it might come to pass that I, girl as I was, might\ncontribute by word or deed towards the vindication of that long-suffering,\ngallant, and romantic prodigal. It was a flicker of the Joan of Arc\ninspiration, common, I fancy, to many girls. I little then imagined how\nprofoundly and strangely involved my uncle's fate would one day become with\nmine.\n\nI was interrupted by Captain Oakley's voice at the window. He was leaning\non the window-sill, and looking in with a smile--the window being open, the\nmorning sunny, and his cap lifted in his hand.\n\n'Good-morning, Miss Ruthyn. What a charming old place! quite the setting\nfor a romance; such timber, and this really _beautiful_ house. I _do_ so\nlike these white and black houses--wonderful old things. By-the-by, you\ntreated us very badly last night--you did, indeed; upon my word, now, it\nreally was too bad--running away, and drinking tea with Lady Knollys--so\nshe says. I really--I should not like to tell you how very savage I felt,\nparticularly considering how very short my time is.'\n\nI was a shy, but not a giggling country miss. I knew I was an heiress; I\nknew I was somebody. I was not the least bit in the world conceited, but\nI think this knowledge helped to give me a certain sense of security and\nself-possession, which might have been mistaken for dignity or simplicity.\nI am sure I looked at him with a fearless enquiry, for he answered my\nthoughts.\n\n'I do really assure you, Miss Ruthyn, I am quite serious; you have no idea\nhow very much we have missed you.'\n\nThere was a little pause, and, like a fool, I lowered my eyes, and blushed.\n\n'I--I was thinking of leaving today; I am so unfortunate--my leave is just\nout--it is so unlucky; but I don't quite know whether my aunt Knollys will\nallow me to go.'\n\n'_I_?--certainly, my dear Charlie, _I_ don't want you at all,' exclaimed a\nvoice--Lady Knollys's--briskly, from an open window close by; 'what could\nput that in your head, dear?'\n\nAnd in went my cousin's head, and the window shut down.\n\n'She is _such_ an oddity, poor dear Aunt Knollys,' murmured the young\nman, ever so little put out, and he laughed. 'I never know quite what she\nwishes, or how to please her; but she's _so_ good-natured; and when she\ngoes to town for the season--she does not always, you know--her house is\nreally very gay--you can't think----'\n\nHere again he was interrupted, for the door opened, and Lady Knollys\nentered. 'And you know, Charles,' she continued, 'it would not do to forget\nyour visit to Snodhurst; you wrote, you know, and you have only to-night\nand to-morrow. You are thinking of nothing but that moor; I heard you\ntalking to the gamekeeper; I know he is--is not he, Maud, the brown man\nwith great whiskers, and leggings? I'm very sorry, you know, but I really\nmust spoil your shooting, for they do expect you at Snodhurst, Charlie; and\ndo not you think this window a little too much for Miss Ruthyn? Maud, my\ndear, the air is very sharp; shut it down, Charles, and you'd better tell\nthem to get a fly for you from the town after luncheon. Come, dear,' she\nsaid to me. 'Was not that the breakfast bell? Why does not your papa get a\ngong?--it is so hard to know one bell from another.'\n\nI saw that Captain Oakley lingered for a last look, but I did not give it,\nand went out smiling with Cousin Knollys, and wondering why old ladies are\nso uniformly disagreeable.\n\nIn the lobby she said, with an odd, goodnatured look--\n\n'Don't allow any of his love-making, my dear. Charles Oakley has not a\nguinea, and an heiress would be very convenient. Of course he has his eyes\nabout him. Charles is not by any means foolish; and I should not be at all\nsorry to see him well married, for I don't think he will do much good\nany other way; but there are degrees, and his ideas are sometimes very\nimpertinent.'\n\nI was an admiring reader of the _Albums_, the _Souvenirs_, the _Keepsakes_,\nand all that flood of Christmas-present lore which yearly irrigated\nEngland, with pretty covers and engravings; and floods of elegant\ntwaddle--the milk, not destitute of water, on which the babes of literature\nwere then fed. On this, my genius throve. I had a little album, enriched\nwith many gems of original thought and observation, which I jotted down in\nsuitable language. Lately, turning over these faded leaves of rhyme\nand prose, I lighted, under this day's date, upon the following sage\nreflection, with my name appended:--\n\n'Is there not in the female heart an ineradicable jealousy, which, if it\nsways the passions of the young, rules also the _advice_ of the _aged_? Do\nthey not grudge to youth the sentiments (though Heaven knows how _shadowed_\nwith sorrow) which they can _no longer inspire_, perhaps even _experience_;\nand does not youth, in turn, sigh over the envy which has _power to\nblight_?\n\nMAUD AYLMER RUTHYN.'\n\n'He has not been making love to me,' I said rather tartly, 'and he does not\nseem to me at all impertinent, and I really don't care the least whether he\ngoes or stays.'\n\nCousin Monica looked in my face with her old waggish smile, and laughed.\n\n'You'll understand those London dandies better some day, dear Maud; they\nare very well, but they like money--not to keep, of course--but still they\nlike it and know its value.'\n\nAt breakfast my father told Captain Oakley where he might have shooting, or\nif he preferred going to Dilsford, only half an hour's ride, he might have\nhis choice of hunters, and find the dogs there that morning.\n\nThe Captain smiled archly at me, and looked at his aunt. There was a\nsuspense. I hope I did not show how much I was interested--but it would not\ndo. Cousin Monica was inexorable.\n\n'Hunting, hawking, fishing, fiddle-de-dee! You know, Charlie, my dear, it\nis quite out of the question. He is going to Snodhurst this afternoon, and\nwithout quite a rudeness, in which I should be involved too, he really\ncan't--you know you can't, Charles! and--and he _must_ go and keep his\nengagement.'\n\nSo papa acquiesced with a polite regret, and hoped another time.\n\n'Oh, leave all that to me. When you want him, only write me a note, and\nI'll send him or bring him if you let me. I always know where to find\nhim--don't I, Charlie?--and we shall be only too happy.'\n\nAunt Monica's influence with her nephew was special, for she 'tipped' him\nhandsomely every now and then, and he had formed for himself agreeable\nexpectations, besides, respecting her will. I felt rather angry at his\nsubmitting to this sort of tutelage, knowing nothing of its motive; I was\nalso disgusted by Cousin Monica's tyranny.\n\nSo soon as he had left the room, Lady Knollys, not minding me, said briskly\nto papa, 'Never let that young man into your house again. I found him\nmaking speeches, this morning, to little Maud here; and he really has not\ntwo pence in the world--it is amazing impudence--and you know such absurd\nthings do happen.'\n\n'Come, Maud, what compliments did he pay you?' asked my father.\n\nI was vexed, and therefore spoke courageously. 'His compliments were not to\nme; they were all to the house,' I said, drily.\n\n'Quite as it should be--the house, of course; it is that he's in love\nwith,' said Cousin Knollys.\n\n  ''Twas on a widow's jointure land,\n  The archer, Cupid, took his stand.'\n\n'Hey! I don't quite understand,' said my father, slily.\n\n'Tut! Austin; you forget Charlie is my nephew.'\n\n'So I did,' said my father.\n\n'Therefore the literal widow in this case _can_ have no interest in view\nbut one, and that is yours and Maud's. I wish him well, but he shan't put\nmy little cousin and her expectations into his empty pocket--_not_ a bit of\nit. And _there's_ another reason, Austin, why you should marry--you have no\neye for these things, whereas a clever _woman_ would see at a glance and\nprevent mischief.'\n\n'So she would,' acquiesced my father, in his gloomy, amused way. 'Maud, you\nmust try to be a clever woman.'\n\n'So she will in her time, but that is not come yet; and I tell you, Austin\nRuthyn, if you won't look about and marry somebody, somebody may possibly\nmarry you.'\n\n'You were always an oracle, Monica; but _here_ I am lost in total\nperplexity,' said my father.\n\n'Yes; sharks sailing round you, with keen eyes and large throats; and you\nhave come to the age precisely when men _are_ swallowed up alive like\nJonah.'\n\n'Thank you for the parallel, but you know that was not a happy union, even\nfor the fish, and there was a separation in a few days; not that I mean to\ntrust to that; but there's no one to throw me into the jaws of the monster,\nand I've no notion of jumping there; and the fact is, Monica, there's no\nmonster at all.'\n\n'I'm not so sure.'\n\n'But I'm quite sure,' said my father, a little drily. 'You forget how old\nI am, and how long I've lived alone--I and little Maud;' and he smiled and\nsmoothed my hair, and, I thought, sighed.\n\n'No one is ever too old to do a foolish thing,' began Lady Knollys.\n\n'Nor to say a foolish thing, Monica. This has gone on too long. Don't you\nsee that little Maud here is silly enough to be frightened at your fun.'\n\nSo I was, but I could not divine how he guessed it.\n\n'And well or ill, wisely or madly, I'll _never_ marry; so put that out of\nyour head.'\n\nThis was addressed rather to me, I think, than to Lady Knollys, who smiled\na little waggishly on me, and said--\n\n'To be sure, Maud; maybe you are right; a stepdame is a risk, and I ought\nto have asked you first what you thought of it; and upon my honour,' she\ncontinued merrily but kindly, observing that my eyes, I know not exactly\nfrom what feeling, filled with tears, 'I'll never again advise your papa to\nmarry, unless you first tell me you wish it.'\n\nThis was a great deal from Lady Knollys, who had a taste for advising her\nfriends and managing their affairs.\n\n'I've a great respect for instinct. I believe, Austin, it is truer than\nreason, and yours and Maud's are both against me, though I know I have\nreason on my side.'\n\nMy father's brief wintry smile answered, and Cousin Monica kissed me, and\nsaid--\n\n'I've been so long my own mistress that I sometimes forget there are such\nthings as fear and jealousy; and are you going to your governess, Maud?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n_ANGRY WORDS_\n\n\nI was going to my governess, as Lady Knollys said; and so I went. The\nundefinable sense of danger that smote me whenever I beheld that woman had\ndeepened since last night's occurrence, and was taken out of the region\nof instinct or prepossession by the strange though slight indications of\nrecognition and abhorrence which I had witnessed in Lady Knollys on that\noccasion.\n\nThe tone in which Cousin Monica had asked, 'are you going to your\ngoverness?' and the curious, grave, and anxious look that accompanied the\nquestion, disturbed me; and there was something odd and cold in the tone as\nif a remembrance had suddenly chilled her. The accent remained in my ear,\nand the sharp brooding look was fixed before me as I glided up the broad\ndark stairs to Madame de la Rougierre's chamber.\n\nShe had not come down to the school-room, as the scene of my studies was\ncalled. She had decided on having a relapse, and accordingly had not made\nher appearance down-stairs that morning. The gallery leading to her room\nwas dark and lonely, and I grew more nervous as I approached; I paused at\nthe door, making up my mind to knock.\n\nBut the door opened suddenly, and, like a magic-lantern figure, presented\nwith a snap, appeared close before my eyes the great muffled face, with the\nforbidding smirk, of Madame de la Rougierre.\n\n'Wat you mean, my dear cheaile?' she inquired with a malevolent shrewdness\nin her eyes, and her hollow smile all the time disconcerting me more even\nthan the suddenness of her appearance; 'wat for you approach so softly? I\ndo not sleep, you see, but you feared, perhaps, to have the misfortune of\nwakening me, and so you came--is it not so?--to leesten, and looke in very\ngentily; you want to know how I was. Vous \u00c3\u00aates bien aimable d'avoir pens\u00c3\u00a9\n\u00c3\u00a0 moi. Bah!' she cried, suddenly bursting through her irony. 'Wy could not\nLady Knollys come herself and leesten to the keyhole to make her report?\nFi donc! wat is there to conceal? Nothing. Enter, if you please. Every one\nthey are welcome!' and she flung the door wide, turned her back upon me,\nand, with an ejaculation which I did not understand, strode into the room.\n\n'I did not come with any intention, Madame, to pry or to intrude--you\ndon't think so--you _can't_ think so--you can't possibly mean to insinuate\nanything so insulting!'\n\nI was very angry, and my tremors had all vanished now.\n\n'No, not for _you_, dear cheaile; I was thinking to miladi Knollys, who,\nwithout cause, is my enemy. Every one has enemy; you will learn all that so\nsoon as you are little older, and without cause she is mine. Come, Maud,\nspeak a the truth--was it not miladi Knollys who sent you here doucement,\ndoucement, so quaite to my door--is it not so, little rogue?'\n\nMadame had confronted me again, and we were now standing in the middle of\nher floor.\n\nI indignantly repelled the charge, and searching me for a moment with her\noddly-shaped, cunning eyes, she said--\n\n'That is good cheaile, you speak a so direct--I like that, and am glad to\nhear; but, my dear Maud, that woman----'\n\n'Lady Knollys is papa's cousin,' I interposed a little gravely.\n\n'She does hate a me so, you av no idea. She as tryed to injure me several\ntimes, and would employ the most innocent person, unconsciously you know,\nmy dear, to assist her malice.'\n\nHere Madame wept a little. I had already discovered that she could shed\ntears whenever she pleased. I have heard of such persons, but I never met\nanother before or since.\n\nMadame was unusually frank--no one ever knew better when to be candid. At\npresent I suppose she concluded that Lady Knollys would certainly relate\nwhatever she knew concerning her before she left Knowl; and so Madame's\nreserves, whatever they might be, were dissolving, and she growing\nchildlike and confiding.\n\n'Et comment va monsieur votre p\u00c3\u00a8re aujourd'hui?'\n\n'Very well,' I thanked her.\n\n'And how long miladi Knollys her visit is likely to be?'\n\n'I could not say exactly, but for some days.'\n\n'Eh bien, my dear cheaile, I find myself better this morning, and we must\nreturn to our lessons. Je veux m'habiller, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re Maud; you will wait me\nin the school-room.'\n\nBy this time Madame, who, though lazy, could make an effort, and was\ncapable of getting into a sudden hurry, had placed herself before her\ndressing-table, and was ogling her discoloured and bony countenance in the\nglass.\n\n'Wat horror! I am so pale. Quel ennui! wat bore! Ow weak av I grow in two\nthree days!'\n\nAnd she practised some plaintive, invalid glances into the mirror. But on a\nsudden there came a little sharp inquisitive frown as she looked over the\nframe of the glass, upon the terrace beneath. It was only a glance, and she\nsat down languidly in her arm-chair to prepare, I suppose, for the fatigues\nof the toilet.\n\nMy curiosity was sufficiently aroused to induce me to ask--\n\n'But why, Madame, do you fancy that Lady Knollys dislikes you?'\n\n''Tis not fancy, my dear Maud. Ah ha, no! Mais c'est toute une\nhistoire--too tedious to tell now--some time maybe--and you will learn when\nyou are little older, the most violent hatreds often they are the most\nwithout cause. But, my dear cheaile, the hours they are running from us,\nand I must dress. Vite, vite! so you run away to the school-room, and I\nwill come after.'\n\nMadame had her dressing-case and her mysteries, and palpably stood in need\nof repairs; so away I went to my studies. The room which we called the\nschool-room was partly beneath the floor of Madame's bed-chamber, and\ncommanded the same view; so, remembering my governess's peering glance from\nher windows, I looked out, and saw Cousin Monica making a brisk promenade\nup and down the terrace-walk. Well, that was quite enough to account for\nit. I had grown very curious, and I resolved when our lessons were over to\njoin her and make another attempt to discover the mystery.\n\nAs I sat over my books, I fancied I heard a movement outside the door. I\nsuspected that Madame was listening. I waited for a time, expecting to see\nthe door open, but she did not come; so I opened it suddenly myself, but\nMadame was not on the threshold nor on the lobby. I heard a rustling,\nhowever, and on the staircase over the banister I saw the folds of her silk\ndress as she descended.\n\nShe is going, I thought, to seek an interview with Lady Knollys. She\nintends to propitiate that dangerous lady; so I amused some eight or ten\nminutes in watching Cousin Monica's quick march and right-about face upon\nthe parade-ground of the terrace. But no one joined her.\n\n'She is certainly talking to papa,' was my next and more probable\nconjecture. Having the profoundest distrust of Madame, I was naturally\nextremely jealous of the confidential interviews in which deceit and malice\nmight make their representations plausibly and without answer.\n\n'Yes, I'll run down and see--see _papa_; she shan't tell lies behind my\nback, horrid woman!'\n\nAt the study-door I knocked, and forthwith entered. My father was sitting\nnear the window, his open book before him, Madame standing at the\nother side of the table, her cunning eyes bathed in tears, and her\npocket-handkerchief pressed to her mouth. Her eyes glittered stealthily on\nme for an instant: she was sobbing--_d\u00c3\u00a9sol\u00c3\u00a9e_, in fact--that grim grenadier\nlady, and her attitude was exquisitely dejected and timid. But she was,\nnotwithstanding, reading closely and craftily my father's face. He was not\nlooking at her, but rather upward toward the ceiling, reflectively leaning\non his hand, with an expression, not angry, but rather surly and annoyed.\n\n'I ought to have heard of this before, Madame,' my father was saying as I\ncame in; 'not that it would have made any difference--not the least; mind\nthat. But it was the kind of thing that I ought to have heard, and the\nomission was not strictly right.'\n\nMadame, in a shrill and lamentable key, opened her voluble reply, but was\narrested by a nod from my father, who asked me if I wanted anything.\n\n'Only--only that I was waiting in the school-room for Madame, and did not\nknow where she was.'\n\n'Well, she is here, you see, and will join you up-stairs in a few minutes.'\n\nSo back I went again, huffed, angry, and curious, and sat back in my chair\nwith a clouded countenance, thinking very little about lessons.\n\nWhen Madame entered, I did not lift my head or eyes.\n\n'Good cheaile! reading,' said she, as she approached briskly and reassured.\n\n'No,' I answered tartly; 'not good, nor a child either; I'm not reading,\nI've been thinking.'\n\n'Tr\u00c3\u00a8s-bien!' she said, with an insufferable smile, 'thinking is very good\nalso; but you look unhappy--very, poor cheaile. Take care you are not grow\njealous for poor Madame talking sometime to your papa; you must not, little\nfool. It is only for a your good, my dear Maud, and I had no objection you\nshould stay.'\n\n'_You_! Madame!' I said loftily. I was very angry, and showed it through my\ndignity, to Madame's evident satisfaction.\n\n'No--it was your papa, Mr. Ruthyn, who weesh to speak alone; for me I do\nnot care; there was something I weesh to tell him. I don't care who know,\nbut Mr. Ruthyn he is deeferent.'\n\nI made no remark.\n\n'Come, leetle Maud, you are not to be so cross; it will be much better you\nand I to be good friends together. Why should a we quarrel?--wat nonsense!\nDo you imagine I would anywhere undertake a the education of a young person\nunless I could speak with her parent?--wat folly! I would like to be your\nfriend, however, my poor Maud, if you would allow--you and I together--wat\nyou say?'\n\n'People grow to be friends by liking, Madame, and liking comes of itself,\nnot by bargain; I like every one who is kind to me.'\n\n'And so I. You are like me in so many things, my dear Maud! Are you quaite\nwell to-day? I think you look fateague; so I feel, too, vary tire. I think\nwe weel put off the lessons to to-morrow. Eh? and we will come to play la\ngrace in the garden.'\n\nMadame was plainly in a high state of exultation. Her audience had\nevidently been satisfactory, and, like other people, when things went well,\nher soul lighted up into a sulphureous good-humour, not very genuine nor\npleasant, but still it was better than other moods.\n\nI was glad when our calisthenics were ended, and Madame had returned to her\napartment, so that I had a pleasant little walk with Cousin Monica.\n\nWe women are persevering when once our curiosity is roused, but she gaily\nfoiled mine, and, I think, had a mischievous pleasure in doing so. As we\nwere going in to dress for dinner, however, she said, quite gravely--\n\n'I am sorry, Maud, I allowed you to see that I have any unpleasant\nimpressions about that governess lady. I shall be at liberty some day to\nexplain all about it, and, indeed, it will be enough to tell your father,\nwhom I have not been able to find all day; but really we are, perhaps,\nmaking too much of the matter, and I cannot say that I know anything\nagainst Madame that is conclusive, or--or, indeed, at all; but that there\nare reasons, and--you must not ask any more--no, you must not.'\n\nThat evening, while I was playing the overture to Cenerentola, for the\nentertainment of my cousin, there arose from the tea-table, where she and\nmy father were sitting, a spirited and rather angry harangue from Lady\nKnollys' lips; I turned my eyes from the music towards the speakers; the\noverture swooned away with a little hesitating babble into silence, and I\nlistened.\n\nTheir conversation had begun under cover of the music which I was making,\nand now they were too much engrossed to perceive its discontinuance. The\nfirst sentence I heard seized my attention; my father had closed the book\nhe was reading, upon his finger, and was leaning back in his chair, as he\nused to do when at all angry; his face was a little flushed, and I knew the\nfierce and glassy stare which expressed pride, surprise, and wrath.\n\n'Yes, Lady Knollys, there's an animus; I know the spirit you speak in--it\ndoes you no honour,' said my father.\n\n'And I know the spirit _you_ speak in, the spirit of _madness_,' retorted\nCousin Monica, just as much in earnest. 'I can't conceive how you _can_ be\nso _demented_, Austin. What has perverted you? are you _blind_?'\n\n'_You_ are, Monica; your own unnatural prejudice--_unnatural_ prejudice,\nblinds you. What is it all?--_nothing_. Were I to act as you say, I should\nbe a _coward_ and a traitor. I see, I _do_ see, all that's real. I'm no\nQuixote, to draw my sword on illusions.'\n\n'There should be no halting here. How _can_ you--do you ever _think_? I\nwonder if you can breathe. I feel as if the evil one were in the house.'\n\nA stern, momentary frown was my father's only answer, as he looked fixedly\nat her.\n\n'People need not nail up horseshoes and mark their door-stones with charms\nto keep the evil spirit out,' ran on Lady Knollys, who looked pale and\nangry, in her way, 'but you open your door in the dark and invoke unknown\ndanger. How can you look at that child that's--she's _not_ playing,' said\nKnollys, abruptly stopping.\n\nMy father rose, muttering to himself, and cast a lurid glance at me, as he\nwent in high displeasure to the door. Cousin Monica, now flushed a little,\nglanced also silently at me, biting the tip of her slender gold cross, and\ndoubtful how much I had heard.\n\nMy father opened the door suddenly, which he had just closed, and looking\nin, said, in a calmer tone--\n\n'Perhaps, Monica, you would come for a moment to the study; I'm sure you\nhave none but kindly feelings towards me and little Maud, there; and\nI thank you for your good-will; but you must see other things more\nreasonably, and I think you will.'\n\nCousin Monica got up silently and followed him, only throwing up her eyes\nand hands as she did so, and I was left alone, wondering and curious more\nthan ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_A WARNING_\n\n\nI sat still, listening and wondering, and wondering and listening; but\nI ought to have known that no sound could reach me where I was from my\nfather's study. Five minutes passed and they did not return. Ten, fifteen.\nI drew near the fire and made myself comfortable in a great arm-chair,\nlooking on the embers, but not seeing all the scenery and _dramatis\npersonae_ of my past life or future fortunes, in their shifting glow,\nas people in romances usually do; but fanciful castles and caverns in\nblood-red and golden glare, suggestive of dreamy fairy-land, salamanders,\nsunsets, and palaces of fire-kings, and all this partly shaping and partly\nshaped by my fancy, and leading my closing eyes and drowsy senses off into\ndream-land. So I nodded and dozed, and sank into a deep slumber, from which\nI was roused by the voice of my cousin Monica. On opening my eyes, I saw\nnothing but Lady Knollys' face looking steadily into mine, and expanding\ninto a good-natured laugh as she watched the vacant and lack-lustre stare\nwith which I returned her gaze.\n\n'Come, dear Maud, it is late; you ought to have been in your bed an hour\nago.'\n\nUp I stood, and so soon as I had begun to hear and see aright, it struck me\nthat Cousin Monica was more grave and subdued than I had seen her.\n\n'Come, let us light our candles and go together.'\n\nHolding hands, we ascended, I sleepy, she silent; and not a word was spoken\nuntil we reached my room. Mary Quince was in waiting, and tea made.\n\n'Tell her to come back in a few minutes; I wish to say a word to you,' said\nLady Knollys.\n\nThe maid accordingly withdrew.\n\nLady Knollys' eyes followed her till she closed the door behind her.\n\n'I'm going in the morning.'\n\n'So soon!'\n\n'Yes, dear; I could not stay; in fact, I should have gone to-night, but it\nwas too late, and I leave instead in the morning.'\n\n'I am so sorry--so _very_ sorry,' I exclaimed, in honest disappointment,\nand the walls seemed to darken round me, and the monotony of the old\nroutine loomed more terrible in prospect.\n\n'So am I, dear Maud.'\n\n'But can't you stay a little longer; _won't_ you?'\n\n'No, Maud; I'm vexed with Austin--very much vexed with your father; in\nshort, I can't conceive anything so entirely preposterous, and dangerous,\nand insane as his conduct, now that his eyes are quite opened, and I must\nsay a word to you before I go, and it is just this:--you must cease to be a\nmere child, you must try and be a woman, Maud: now don't be frightened\nor foolish, but hear me out. That woman--what does she call\nherself--Rougierre? I have reason to believe is--in fact, from\ncircumstances, _must_ be your enemy; you will find her very deep, daring,\nand unscrupulous, I venture to say, and you can't be too much on your\nguard. Do you quite understand me, Maud?'\n\n'I do,' said I, with a gasp, and my eyes fixed on her with a terrified\ninterest, as if on a warning ghost.\n\n'You must bridle your tongue, mind, and govern your conduct, and command\neven your features. It is hard to practise reserve; but you must--you must\nbe secret and vigilant. Try and be in appearance just as usual; don't\nquarrel; tell her nothing, if you do happen to know anything, of your\nfather's business; be always on your guard when with her, and keep your eye\nupon her everywhere. Observe everything, disclose nothing--do you see?'\n\n'Yes,' again I whispered.\n\n'You have good, honest servants about you, and, thank God, they don't like\nher. But you must not repeat to them one word I am now saying to you.\nServants are fond of dropping hints, and letting things ooze out in that\nway, and in their quarrels with her would compromise you--you understand\nme?'\n\n'I do,' I sighed, with a wild stare.\n\n'And--and, Maud, don't let her meddle with your food.'\n\nCousin Monica gave me a pale little nod, and looked away.\n\nI could only stare at her; and under my breath I uttered an ejaculation of\nterror.\n\n'Don't be so frightened; you must not be foolish; I only wish you to be\nupon your guard. I have my suspicions, but I may be quite wrong; your\nfather thinks I am a fool; perhaps I am--perhaps not; maybe he may come to\nthink as I do. But you must not speak to him on the subject; he's an\nodd man, and never did and never will act wisely, when his passions and\nprejudices are engaged.'\n\n'Has she ever committed any great crime?' I asked, feeling as if I were on\nthe point of fainting.\n\n'No, dear Maud, I never said anything of the kind; don't be so frightened:\nI only said I have formed, from something I know, an ill opinion of her;\nand an unprincipled person, under temptation, is capable of a great deal.\nBut no matter how wicked she may be, you may defy her, simply by assuming\nher to be so, and acting with caution; she is cunning and selfish, and\nshe'll do nothing desperate. But I would give her no opportunity.'\n\n'Oh, dear! Oh, Cousin Monica, don't leave me.'\n\n'My dear, I _can't_ stay; your papa and I--we've had a quarrel. I know\nI'm right, and he's wrong, and he'll come to see it soon, if he's left to\nhimself, and then all will be right. But just now he misunderstands me, and\nwe've not been civil to one another. I could not think of staying, and he\nwould not allow you to come away with me for a short visit, which I wished.\nIt won't last, though; and I do assure you, my dear Maud, I am quite happy\nabout you now that you are quite on your guard. Just act respecting that\nperson as if she were capable of any treachery, without showing distrust or\ndislike in your manner, and nothing will remain in her power; and write to\nme whenever you wish to hear from me, and if I can be of any real use, I\ndon't care, I'll come: so there's a wise little woman; do as I've said, and\ndepend upon it everything will go well, and I'll contrive before long to\nget that nasty creature away.'\n\nExcept a kiss and a few hurried words in the morning when she was leaving,\nand a pencilled farewell for papa, there was nothing more from Cousin\nMonica for some time.\n\nKnowl was dark again--darker than ever. My father, gentle always to me, was\nnow--perhaps it was contrast with his fitful return to something like the\nworld's ways, during Lady Knollys' stay--more silent, sad, and isolated\nthan before. Of Madame de la Rougierre I had nothing at first particular to\nremark. Only, reader, if you happen to be a rather nervous and very young\ngirl, I ask you to conceive my fears and imaginings, and the kind of misery\nwhich I was suffering. Its intensity I cannot now even myself recall. But\nit overshadowed me perpetually--a care, an alarm. It lay down with me at\nnight and got up with me in the morning, tinting and disturbing my dreams,\nand making my daily life terrible. I wonder now that I lived through\nthe ordeal. The torment was secret and incessant, and kept my mind in\nunintermitting activity.\n\nExternally things went on at Knowl for some weeks in the usual routine.\nMadame was, so far as her unpleasant ways were concerned, less tormenting\nthan before, and constantly reminded me of 'our leetle vow of friendship,\nyou remember, dearest Maud!' and she would stand beside me, and looked from\nthe window with her bony arm round my waist, and my reluctant hand drawn\nround in hers; and thus she would smile, and talk affectionately and even\nplayfully; for at times she would grow quite girlish, and smile with\nher great carious teeth, and begin to quiz and babble about the young\n'faylows,' and tell bragging tales of her lovers, all of which were\ndreadful to me.\n\nShe was perpetually recurring, too, to the charming walk we had had\ntogether to Church Scarsdale, and proposing a repetition of that delightful\nexcursion, which, you may be sure, I evaded, having by no means so\nagreeable a recollection of our visit.\n\nOne day, as I was dressing to go out for a walk, in came good Mrs. Rusk,\nthe housekeeper, to my room.\n\n'Miss Maud, dear, is not that too far for you? It is a long walk to Church\nScarsdale, and you are not looking very well.'\n\n'To Church Scarsdale?' I repeated; 'I'm not going to Church Scarsdale; who\nsaid I was going to Church Scarsdale? There is nothing I should so much\ndislike.'\n\n'Well, I never!' exclaimed she. 'Why, there's old Madame's been down-stairs\nwith me for fruit and sandwiches, telling me you were longing to go to\nChurch Scarsdale----'\n\n'It's quite untrue,' I interrupted. 'She knows I hate it.'\n\n'She does?' said Mrs. Rusk, quietly; 'and you did not tell her nothing\nabout the basket? Well--if there isn't a story! Now what may she be\nafter--what is it--what _is_ she driving at?'\n\n'I can't tell, but I won't go.'\n\n'No, of course, dear, you won't go. But you may be sure there's some scheme\nin her old head. Tom Fowkes says she's bin two or three times to drink tea\nat Farmer Gray's--now, could it be she's thinking to marry him?' And Mrs.\nRusk sat down and laughed heartily, ending with a crow of derision.\n\n'To think of a young fellow like that, and his wife, poor thing, not dead a\nyear--maybe she's got money?'\n\n'I don't know--I don't care--perhaps, Mrs. Rusk, you mistook Madame. I will\ngo down; I am going out.'\n\nMadame had a basket in her hand. She held it quietly by her capacious\nskirt, at the far side, and made no allusion to the preparation, neither to\nthe direction in which she proposed walking, and prattling artlessly and\naffectionately she marched by my side.\n\nThus we reached the stile at the sheep-walk, and then I paused.\n\n'Now, Madame, have not we gone far enough in this direction?--suppose we\nvisit the pigeon-house in the park?'\n\n'Wat folly! my dear a Maud--you cannot walk so far.'\n\n'Well, towards home, then.'\n\n'And wy not a this way? We ave not walk enough, and Mr. Ruthyn he will not\nbe pleased if you do not take proper exercise. Let us walk on by the path,\nand stop when you like.'\n\n'Where do you wish to go, Madame?'\n\n'Nowhere particular--come along; don't be fool, Maud.'\n\n'This leads to Church Scarsdale.'\n\n'A yes indeed! wat sweet place! bote we need not a walk all the way to\nthere.'\n\n'I'd rather not walk outside the grounds to-day, Madame.'\n\n'Come, Maud, you shall not be fool--wat you mean, Mademoiselle?' said the\nstalworth lady, growing yellow and greenish with an angry mottling, and\naccosting me very gruffly.\n\n'I don't care to cross the stile, thank you, Madame. I shall remain at this\nside.'\n\n'You shall do wat I tell you!' exclaimed she.\n\n'Let go my arm, Madame, you hurt me,' I cried.\n\nShe had griped my arm very firmly in her great bony hand, and seemed\npreparing to drag me over by main force.\n\n'Let me go,' I repeated shrilly, for the pain increased.\n\n'La!' she cried with a smile of rage and a laugh, letting me go and shoving\nme backward at the same time, so that I had a rather dangerous tumble.\n\nI stood up, a good deal hurt, and very angry, notwithstanding my fear of\nher.\n\n'I'll ask papa if I am to be so ill-used.'\n\n'Wat av I done?' cried Madame, laughing grimly from her hollow jaws; I did\nall I could to help you over--'ow could I prevent you to pull back and\ntumble if you would do so? That is the way wen you petites Mademoiselles\nare naughty and hurt yourself they always try to make blame other people.\nTell a wat you like--you think I care?'\n\n'Very well, Madame.'\n\n'Are a you coming?'\n\n'No.'\n\nShe looked steadily in my face and very wickedly. I gazed at her as with\ndazzled eyes--I suppose as the feathered prey do at the owl that glares on\nthem by night. I neither moved back nor forward, but stared at her quite\nhelplessly.\n\n'You are nice pupil--charming young person! So polite, so obedient, so\namiable! I will walk towards Church Scarsdale,' she continued, suddenly\nbreaking through the conventionalism of her irony, and accosting me\nin savage accents. 'You weel stay behind if you dare. I tell you to\naccompany--do you hear?'\n\nMore than ever resolved against following her, I remained where I was,\nwatching her as she marched fiercely away, swinging her basket as though in\nimagination knocking my head off with it.\n\nShe soon cooled, however, and looking over her shoulder, and seeing me\nstill at the other side of the stile, she paused, and beckoned me grimly\nto follow her. Seeing me resolutely maintain my position, she faced about,\ntossed her head, like an angry beast, and seemed uncertain for a while what\ncourse to take with me.\n\nShe stamped and beckoned furiously again. I stood firm. I was very much\nfrightened, and could not tell to what violence she might resort in her\nexasperation. She walked towards me with an inflamed countenance, and a\nslight angry wagging of the head; my heart fluttered, and I awaited the\ncrisis in extreme trepidation. She came close, the stile only separating\nus, and stopped short, glaring and grinning at me like a French grenadier\nwho has crossed bayonets, but hesitates to close.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n_DOCTOR BRYERLY LOOKS IN_\n\n\nWhat had I done to excite this ungovernable fury? We had often before had\nsuch small differences, and she had contented herself with being sarcastic,\nteasing, and impertinent.\n\n'So, for future you are gouvernante and I the cheaile for you to\ncommand--is not so?--and you must direct where we shall walk. Tr\u00c3\u00a8s-bien!\nwe shall see; Monsieur Ruthyn he shall know everything. For me I do not\ncare--not at all--I shall be rather pleased, on the contrary. Let him\ndecide. If I shall be responsible for the conduct and the health of\nMademoiselle his daughter, it must be that I shall have authority to direct\nher wat she must do--it must be that she or I shall obey. I ask only witch\nshall command for the future--voil\u00c3\u00a0 tout!'\n\nI was frightened, but resolute--I dare say I looked sullen and\nuncomfortable. At all events, she seemed to think she might possibly\nsucceed by wheedling; so she tried coaxing and cajoling, and patted my\ncheek, and predicted that I would be 'a good cheaile,' and not 'vex poor\nMadame,' but do for the future 'wat she tell a me.'\n\nShe smiled her wide wet grin, smoothed my hand, and patted my cheek, and\nwould in the excess of her conciliatory paroxysm have kissed me; but I\nwithdrew, and she commented only with a little laugh, and a 'Foolish little\nthing! but you will be quite amiable just now.'\n\n'Why, Madame,' I asked, suddenly raising my head and looking her straight\nin the face, 'do you wish me to walk to Church Scarsdale so particularly\nto-day?'\n\nShe answered my steady look with a contracted gaze and an unpleasant frown.\n\n'Wy do I?--I do not understand a you; there is _no_ particular day--wat\nfolly! Wy I like Church Scarsdale? Well, it is such pretty place. There is\nall! Wat leetle fool! I suppose you think I want to keel a you and bury you\nin the churchyard?'\n\nAnd she laughed, and it would not have been a bad laugh for a ghoul.\n\n'Come, my dearest Maud, you are not a such fool to say, if _you_ tell me me\ngo thees a way, I weel go that; and if you say, go that a way, I weel go\nthees--you are rasonable leetle girl--come along--_alons donc_--we shall av\nsoche agreeable walk--weel a you?'\n\nBut I was immovable. It was neither obstinacy nor caprice, but a profound\nfear that governed me. I was then afraid--yes, _afraid_. Afraid of _what_?\nWell, of going with Madame de la Rougierre to Church Scarsdale that day.\nThat was all. And I believe that instinct was true.\n\nShe turned a bitter glance toward Church Scarsdale, and bit her lip. She\nsaw that she must give it up. A shadow hung upon her drab features. A\nlittle scowl--a little sneer--wide lips compressed with a false smile, and\na leaden shadow mottling all. Such was the countenance of the lady who only\na minute or two before had been smiling and murmuring over the stile so\namiably with her idiomatic 'blarney,' as the Irish call that kind of\nblandishment.\n\nThere was no mistaking the malignant disappointment that hooked and warped\nher features--my heart sank--a tremendous fear overpowered me. Had she\nintended poisoning me? What was in that basket? I looked in her dreadful\nface. I felt for a minute quite frantic. A feeling of rage with my father,\nwith my Cousin Monica, for abandoning me to this dreadful rogue, took\npossession of me, and I cried, helplessly wringing my hands--\n\n'Oh! it is a shame--it is a shame--it is a shame!'\n\nThe countenance of the gouvernante relaxed. I think she in turn was\nfrightened at my extreme agitation. It might have worked unfavourably with\nmy father.\n\n'Come, Maud, it is time you should try to control your temper. You shall\nnot walk to Church Scarsdale if you do not like--I only invite. _There_!\nIt is quite as you please, where we shall walk then? Here to the\npeegeon-house? I think you say. Tout bien! Remember I concede you\neverything. Let us go.'\n\nWe went, therefore, towards the pigeon-house, through the forest trees; I\nnot speaking as the children in the wood did with their sinister conductor,\nbut utterly silent and scared; she silent also, meditating, and sometimes\nwith a sharp side-glance gauging my progress towards equanimity. Her own\nwas rapid; for Madame was a philosopher, and speedily accommodated herself\nto circumstances. We had not walked a quarter of an hour when every trace\nof gloom had left her face, which had assumed its customary brightness, and\nshe began to sing with a spiteful hilarity as we walked forward, and indeed\nseemed to be approaching one of her waggish, frolicsome moods. But her fun\nin these moods was solitary. The joke, whatever it was, remained in her\nown keeping. When we approached the ruined brick tower--in old times a\npigeon-house--she grew quite frisky, and twirled her basket in the air, and\ncapered to her own singing.\n\nUnder the shadow of the broken wall, and its ivy, she sat down with a\nfrolicsome _plump_, and opened her basket, inviting me to partake, which\nI declined. I must do her justice, however, upon the suspicion of poison,\nwhich she quite disposed of by gobbling up, to her own share, everything\nwhich the basket contained.\n\nThe reader is not to suppose that Madame's cheerful demeanour indicated\nthat I was forgiven. Nothing of the kind. One syllable more, on our walk\nhome, she addressed not to me. And when we reached the terrace, she said--\n\n'You will please, Maud, remain for two--three minutes in the Dutch garden,\nwhile I speak with Mr. Ruthyn in the study.'\n\nThis was spoken with a high head and an insufferable smile; and I more\nhaughtily, but quite gravely, turned without disputing, and descended the\nsteps to the quaint little garden she had indicated.\n\nI was surprised and very glad to see my father there. I ran to him, and\nbegan, 'Oh! papa!' and then stopped short, adding only, 'may I speak to you\nnow?'\n\nHe smiled kindly and gravely on me.\n\n'Well, Maud, say your say.'\n\n'Oh, sir, it is only this: I entreat that our walks, mine and Madame's may\nbe confined to the grounds.'\n\n'And why?'\n\n'I--I'm afraid to go with her.'\n\n'_Afraid!_' he repeated, looking hard at me. 'Have you lately had a letter\nfrom Lady Knollys?'\n\n'No, papa, not for two months or more.'\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n'And why _afraid_, Maud?'\n\n'She brought me one day to Church Scarsdale; you know what a solitary place\nit is, sir; and she frightened me so that I was afraid to go with her into\nthe churchyard. But she went and left me alone at the other side of the\nstream, and an impudent man passing by stopped and spoke to me, and seemed\ninclined to laugh at me, and altogether frightened me very much, and he did\nnot go till Madame happened to return.'\n\n'What kind of man--young or old?'\n\n'A young man; he looked like a farmer's son, but very impudent, and stood\nthere talking to me whether I would or not; and Madame did not care at\nall, and laughed at me for being frightened; and, indeed, I am very\nuncomfortable with her.'\n\nHe gave me another shrewd look, and then looked down cloudily and thought.\n\n'You say you are uncomfortable and frightened. How is this--what causes\nthese feelings?'\n\n'I don't know, sir; she likes frightening me; I am afraid of her--we are\nall afraid of her, I think. The servants, I mean, as well as I.'\n\nMy father nodded his head contemptuously, twice or thrice, and muttered, 'A\npack of fools!'\n\n'And she was so very angry to-day with me, because I would not walk again\nwith her to Church Scarsdale. I am very much afraid of her. I--' and quite\nunpremeditatedly I burst into tears.\n\n'There, there, little Maud, you must not cry. She is here only for your\ngood. If you are afraid--even _foolishly_ afraid--it is enough. Be it as\nyou say; your walks are henceforward confined to the grounds; I'll tell her\nso.'\n\nI thanked him through my tears very earnestly.\n\n'But, Maud, beware of prejudice; women are unjust and violent in their\njudgments. Your family has suffered in some of its members by such\ninjustice. It behoves us to be careful not to practise it.'\n\nThat evening in the drawing-room my father said, in his usual abrupt way--\n\n'About my departure, Maud: I've had a letter from London this morning, and\nI think I shall be called away sooner than I at first supposed, and for a\nlittle time we must manage apart from one another. Do not be alarmed. You\nshall not be in Madame de la Rougierre's charge, but under the care of a\nrelation; but even so, little Maud will miss her old father, I think.'\n\nHis tone was very tender, so were his looks; he was looking down on me with\na smile, and tears were in his eyes. This softening was new to me. I felt a\nstrange thrill of surprise, delight, and love, and springing up, I threw my\narms about his neck and wept in silence. He, I think, shed tears also.\n\n'You said a visitor was coming; some one, you mean, to go away with. Ah,\nyes, you love him better than me.'\n\n'No, dear, no; but I _fear_ him; and I am sorry to leave you, little Maud.'\n\n'It won't be very long,' I pleaded.\n\n'No, dear,' he answered with a sigh.\n\nI was tempted almost to question him more closely on the subject, but he\nseemed to divine what was in my mind, for he said--\n\n'Let us speak no more of it, but only bear in mind, Maud, what I told you\nabout the oak cabinet, the key of which is here,' and he held it up as\nformerly: 'you remember what you are to do in case Doctor Bryerly should\ncome while I am away?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\nHis manner had changed, and I had returned to my accustomed formalities.\n\nIt was only a few days later that Dr. Bryerly actually did arrive at Knowl,\nquite unexpectedly, except, I suppose, by my father. He was to stay only\none night.\n\nHe was twice closeted in the little study up-stairs with my father, who\nseemed to me, even for him, unusually dejected, and Mrs. Rusk inveighing\nagainst 'them rubbitch,' as she always termed the Swedenborgians, told me\n'they were making him quite shaky-like, and he would not last no time, if\nthat lanky, lean ghost of a fellow in black was to keep prowling in and out\nof his room like a tame cat.'\n\nI lay awake that night, wondering what the mystery might be that connected\nmy father and Dr. Bryerly. There was something more than the convictions\nof their strange religion could account for. There was something that\nprofoundly agitated my father. It may not be reasonable, but so it is. The\nperson whose presence, though we know nothing of the cause of that effect,\nis palpably attended with pain to anyone who is dear to us, grows odious,\nand I began to detest Doctor Bryerly.\n\nIt was a grey, dark morning, and in a dark pass in the gallery, near the\nstaircase, I came full upon the ungainly Doctor, in his glossy black suit.\n\nI think, if my mind had been less anxiously excited on the subject of\nhis visit, or if I had not disliked him so much, I should not have found\ncourage to accost him as I did. There was something sly, I thought, in his\ndark, lean face; and he looked so low, so like a Scotch artisan in his\nSunday clothes, that I felt a sudden pang of indignation, at the thought\nthat a great gentleman, like my father, should have suffered under his\ninfluence, and I stopped suddenly, instead of passing him by with a mere\nsalutation, as he expected, 'May I ask a question, Doctor Bryerly?'\n\n'Certainly'\n\n'Are you the friend whom my father expects?'\n\n'I don't quite see.'\n\n'The friend, I mean, with whom he is to make an expedition to some\ndistance, I think, and for some little time?'\n\n'No,' said the Doctor, with a shake of his head.\n\n'And who is he?'\n\n'I really have not a notion, Miss.'\n\n'Why, he said that _you knew_,' I replied.\n\nThe Doctor looked honestly puzzled.\n\n'Will he stay long away? pray tell me.'\n\nThe Doctor looked into my troubled face with inquiring and darkened eyes,\nlike one who half reads another's meaning; and then he said a little\nbriskly, but not sharply--\n\n'Well, _I_ don't know, I'm sure, Miss; no, indeed, you must have mistaken;\nthere's nothing that _I_ know.'\n\nThere was a little pause, and he added--\n\n'No. He never mentioned any friend to me.' I fancied that he was made\nuncomfortable by my question, and wanted to hide the truth. Perhaps I was\npartly right.\n\n'Oh! Doctor Bryerly, pray, _pray_ who is the friend, and where is he\ngoing?'\n\n'I do _assure_ you,' he said, with a strange sort of impatience, 'I don't\nknow; it is all nonsense.'\n\nAnd he turned to go, looking, I think, annoyed and disconcerted.\n\nA terrific suspicion crossed my brain like lightning.\n\n'Doctor, one word,' I said, I believe, quite wildly. 'Do you--do you think\nhis mind is at all affected?'\n\n'Insane?' he said, looking at me with a sudden, sharp inquisitiveness, that\nbrightened into a smile. 'Pooh, pooh! Heaven forbid! not a saner man in\nEngland.'\n\nThen with a little nod he walked on, carrying, as I believed,\nnotwithstanding his disclaimer, the secret with him. In the afternoon\nDoctor Bryerly went away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n_AN ADVENTURE_\n\n\nFor many days after our quarrel, Madame hardly spoke to me. As for lessons,\nI was not much troubled with them. It was plain, too, that my father had\nspoken to her, for she never after that day proposed our extending our\nwalks beyond the precincts of Knowl.\n\nKnowl, however, was a very considerable territory, and it was possible\nfor a much better pedestrian than I to tire herself effectually, without\npassing its limits. So we took occasionally long walks.\n\nAfter some weeks of sullenness, during which for days at a time she hardly\nspoke to me, and seemed lost in dark and evil abstraction, she once more,\nand somewhat suddenly, recovered her spirits, and grew quite friendly. Her\ngaieties and friendliness were not reassuring, and in my mind presaged\napproaching mischief and treachery. The days were shortening to the wintry\nspan. The edge of the red sun had already touched the horizon as Madame and\nI, overtaken at the warren by his last beams, were hastening homeward.\n\nA narrow carriage-road traverses this wild region of the park, to which a\ndistant gate gives entrance. On descending into this unfrequented road, I\nwas surprised to see a carriage standing there. A thin, sly postilion,\nwith that pert, turned-up nose which the old caricaturist Woodward used to\nattribute to the gentlemen of Tewkesbury, was leaning on his horses, and\nlooked hard at me as I passed. A lady who sat within looked out, with an\nextra-fashionable bonnet on, and also treated us to a stare. Very pink and\nwhite cheeks she had, very black glossy hair and bright eyes--fat, bold,\nand rather cross, she looked--and in her bold way she examined us curiously\nas we passed.\n\nI mistook the situation. It had once happened before that an intending\nvisitor at Knowl had entered the place by that park-road, and lost several\nhours in a vain search for the house.\n\n'Ask him, Madame, whether they want to go to the house; I dare say they\nhave missed their way,' whispered I.\n\n'_Eh bien,_ they will find again. I do not choose to talk to post-boys;\n_allons_!'\n\nBut I asked the man as we passed, 'Do you want to reach the house?'\n\nBy this time he was at the horses' heads, buckling the harness.\n\n'Noa,' he said in a surly tone, smiling oddly on the winkers, but,\nrecollecting his politeness, he added, 'Noa, thankee, misses, it's what\nthey calls a picnic; we'll be takin' the road now.'\n\nHe was smiling now on a little buckle with which he was engaged.\n\n'Come--nonsense!' whispered Madame sharply in my ear, and she whisked me by\nthe arm, so we crossed the little stile at the other side.\n\nOur path lay across the warren, which undulates in little hillocks. The sun\nwas down by this time, blue shadows were stretching round us, colder in the\nsplendid contrast of the burnished sunset sky.\n\nDescending over these hillocks we saw three figures a little in advance of\nus, not far from the path we were tracing. Two were standing smoking and\nchatting at intervals: one tall and slim, with a high chimney-pot, worn a\nlittle on one side, and a white great-coat buttoned up to the chin; the\nother shorter and stouter, with a dark-coloured wrapper. These gentlemen\nwere facing rather our way as we came over the edge of the eminence, but\nturned their backs on perceiving our approach. As they did so, I remember\nso well each lowered his cigar suddenly with the simultaneousness of a\ndrill. The third figure sustained the picnic character of the group, for he\nwas repacking a hamper. He stood suddenly erect as we drew near, and a very\nill-looking person he was, low-browed, square-chinned, and with a broad,\nbroken nose. He wore gaiters, and was a little bandy, very broad, and had\na closely-cropped bullet head, and deep-set little eyes. The moment I saw\nhim, I beheld the living type of the burglars and bruisers whom I had so\noften beheld with a kind of scepticism in _Punch_. He stood over his hamper\nand scowled sharply at us for a moment; then with the point of his foot he\njerked a little fur cap that lay on the ground into his hand, drew it tight\nover his lowering brows, and called to his companions, just as we passed\nhim--'Hallo! mister. How's this?'\n\n'All right,' said the tall person in the white great-coat, who, as he\nanswered, shook his shorter companion by the arm, I thought angrily.\n\nThis shorter companion turned about. He had a muffler loose about his neck\nand chin. I thought he seemed shy and irresolute, and the tall man gave him\na great jolt with his elbow, which made him stagger, and I fancied a little\nangry, for he said, as it seemed, a sulky word or two.\n\nThe gentleman in the white surtout, however, standing direct in our way,\nraised his hat with a mock salutation, placing his hand on his breast,\nand forthwith began to advance with an insolent grin and an air of tipsy\nfrolic.\n\n'Jist in time, ladies; five minutes more and we'd a bin off. Thankee, Mrs.\nMouser, ma'am, for the honour of the meetin', and more particular for the\npleasure of making your young lady's acquaintance--niece, ma'am? daughter,\nma'am? granddaughter, by Jove, is it? Hallo! there, mild 'n, I say, stop\npackin'.' This was to the ill-favoured person with the broken nose. 'Bring\nus a couple o' glasses and a bottle o' cura\u00c3\u00a7oa; what are you fear'd on, my\ndear? this is Lord Lollipop, here, a reg'lar charmer, wouldn't hurt a fly,\nhey Lolly? Isn't he pretty, Miss? and I'm Sir Simon Sugarstick--so called\nafter old Sir Simon, ma'am; and I'm so tall and straight, Miss, and\nslim--ain't I? and ever so sweet, my honey, when you come to know me, just\nlike a sugarstick; ain't I, Lolly, boy?'\n\n'I'm Miss Ruthyn, tell them, Madame,' I said, stamping on the ground, and\nvery much frightened.\n\n'Be quaite, Maud. If you are angry, they will hurt us; leave me to speak,'\nwhispered the gouvernante.\n\nAll this time they were approaching from separate points. I glanced back,\nand saw the ruffianly-looking man within a yard or two, with his arm raised\nand one finger up, telegraphing, as it seemed, to the gentlemen in front.\n\n'Be quaite, Maud,' whispered Madame, with an awful adjuration, which I do\nnot care to set down. 'They are teepsy; don't seem 'fraid.'\n\nI _was_ afraid--terrified. The circle had now so narrowed that they might\nhave placed their hands on my shoulders.\n\n'Pray, gentlemen, wat you want? _weel_ a you 'av the goodness to permit us\nto go on?'\n\nI now observed for the first time, with a kind of shock, that the shorter\nof the two men, who prevented our advance, was the person who had accosted\nme so offensively at Church Scarsdale. I pulled Madame by the arm,\nwhispering, 'Let us run.'\n\n'Be quaite, my dear Maud,' was her only reply.\n\n'I tell you what,' said the tall man, who had replaced his high hat more\njauntily than before on the side of his head, 'We've caught you now, fair\ngame, and we'll let you off on conditions. You must not be frightened,\nMiss. Upon my honour and soul, I mean no mischief; do I, Lollipop? I call\nhim Lord Lollipop; it's only chaff, though; his name's Smith. Now, Lolly,\nI vote we let the prisoners go, when we just introduce them to Mrs. Smith;\nshe's sitting in the carriage, and keeps Mr. S. here in precious good\norder, I promise you. There's easy terms for you, eh, and we'll have a\nglass o' cura\u00c3\u00a7oa round, and so part friends. Is it a bargain? Come!'\n\n'Yes, Maud, we must go--wat matter?' whispered Madame vehemently.\n\n'You shan't,' I said, instinctively terrified.\n\n'You'll go with Ma'am, young 'un, won't you?' said Mr. Smith, as his\ncompanion called him.\n\nMadame was holding my arm, but I snatched it from her, and would have run;\nthe tall man, however, placed his arms round me and held me fast with an\naffectation of playfulness, but his grip was hard enough to hurt me a good\ndeal. Being now thoroughly frightened, after an ineffectual struggle,\nduring which I heard Madame say, 'You fool, Maud, weel you come with me?\nsee wat you are doing,' I began to scream, shriek after shriek, which the\nman attempted to drown with loud hooting, peals of laughter, forcing\nhis handkerchief against my mouth, while Madame continued to bawl her\nexhortations to 'be quaite' in my ear.\n\n'I'll lift her, I say!' said a gruff voice behind me.\n\nBut at this instant, wild with terror, I distinctly heard other voices\nshouting. The men who surrounded me were instantly silent, and all looked\nin the direction of the sound, now very near, and I screamed with redoubled\nenergy. The ruffian behind me thrust his great hand over my mouth.\n\n'It is the gamekeeper,' cried Madame. '_Two_ gamekeepers--we are\nsafe--thank Heaven!' and she began to call on Dykes by name.\n\nI only remember, feeling myself at liberty--running a few steps--seeing\nDykes' white furious face--clinging to his arm, with which he was bringing\nhis gun to a level, and saying, 'Don't fire--they'll murder us if you do.'\n\nMadame, screaming lustily, ran up at the same moment.\n\n'Run on to the gate and lock it--I'll be wi' ye in a minute,' cried he to\nthe other gamekeeper; who started instantly on this mission, for the three\nruffians were already in full retreat for the carriage.\n\nGiddy--wild--fainting--still terror carried me on.\n\n'Now, Madame Rogers--s'pose you take young Misses on--I must run and len'\nBill a hand.'\n\n'No, no; you moste not,' cried Madame. 'I am fainting myself, and more\nvillains they may be near to us.'\n\nBut at this moment we heard a shot, and, muttering to himself and grasping\nhis gun, Dykes ran at his utmost speed in the direction of the sound.\n\nWith many exhortations to speed, and ejaculations of alarm, Madame hurried\nme on toward the house, which at length we reached without further\nadventure.\n\nAs it happened, my father met us in the hall. He was perfectly transported\nwith fury on hearing from Madame what had happened, and set out at once,\nwith some of the servants, in the hope of intercepting the party at the\npark-gate.\n\nHere was a new agitation; for my father did not return for nearly three\nhours, and I could not conjecture what might be occurring during the period\nof his absence. My alarm was greatly increased by the arrival in the\ninterval of poor Bill, the under-gamekeeper, very much injured.\n\nSeeing that he was determined to intercept their retreat, the three men had\nset upon him, wrested his gun, which exploded in the struggle, from him,\nand beat him savagely. I mention these particulars, because they convinced\neverybody that there was something specially determined and ferocious in\nthe spirit of the party, and that the fracas was no mere frolic, but the\nresult of a predetermined plan.\n\nMy father had not succeeded in overtaking them. He traced them to the\nLugton Station, where they had taken the railway, and no one could tell him\nin what direction the carriage and posthorses had driven.\n\nMadame was, or affected to be, very much shattered by what had occurred.\nHer recollection and mine, when my father questioned us closely, differed\nvery materially respecting many details of the _personnel_ of the\nvillanous party. She was obstinate and clear; and although the gamekeeper\ncorroborated my description of them, still my father was puzzled. Perhaps\nhe was not sorry that some hesitation was forced upon him, because although\nat first he would have gone almost any length to detect the persons, on\nreflection he was pleased that there was not evidence to bring them into\na court of justice, the publicity and annoyance of which would have been\ninconceivably distressing to me.\n\nMadame was in a strange state--tempestuous in temper, talking\nincessantly--every now and then in floods of tears, and perpetually on\nher knees pouring forth torrents of thanksgiving to Heaven for our joint\ndeliverance from the hands of those villains. Notwithstanding our community\nof danger and her thankfulness on my behalf, however, she broke forth into\nwrath and railing whenever we were alone together.\n\n'Wat fool you were! so disobedient and obstinate; if you 'ad done wat _I_\nsay, then we should av been quaite safe; those persons they were tipsy, and\nthere is nothing so dangerous as to quarrel with tipsy persons; I would\n'av brought you quaite safe--the lady she seem so nice and quaite, and we\nshould 'av been safe with her--there would 'av been nothing absolutely; but\ninstead you would scream and pooshe, and so they grow quite wild, and all\nthe impertinence and violence follow of course; and that a poor Bill--all\nhis beating and danger to his life it is cause entairely by you.'\n\nAnd she spoke with more real virulence than that kind of upbraiding\ngenerally exhibits.\n\n'The beast!' exclaimed Mrs. Rusk, when she, I, and Mary Quince were in my\nroom together, 'with all her crying and praying, I'd like to know as much\nas she does, maybe, about them rascals. There never was sich like about the\nplace, long as I remember it, till she came to Knowl, old witch! with them\nunmerciful big bones of hers, and her great bald head, grinning here, and\ncrying there, and her nose everywhere. The old French hypocrite!'\n\nMary Quince threw in an observation, and I believe Mrs. Rusk rejoined, but\nI heard neither. For whether the housekeeper spoke with reflection or not,\nwhat she said affected me strangely. Through the smallest aperture, for\na moment, I had had a peep into Pandemonium. Were not peculiarities of\nMadame's demeanour and advice during the adventure partly accounted for by\nthe suggestion? Could the proposed excursion to Church Scarsdale have had\nany purpose of the same sort? What was proposed? How was Madame interested\nin it? Were such immeasurable treason and hypocrisy possible? I could not\nexplain nor quite believe in the shapeless suspicion that with these light\nand bitter words of the old housekeeper had stolen so horribly into my\nmind.\n\nAfter Mrs. Rusk was gone I awoke from my dismal abstraction with something\nlike a moan and a shudder, with a dreadful sense of danger.\n\n'Oh! Mary Quince,' I cried, 'do you think she really knew?'\n\n'_Who_, Miss Maud?'\n\n'Do you think Madame knew of those dreadful people? Oh, no--say you\ndon't--you don't believe it--tell me she did not. I'm distracted, Mary\nQuince, I'm frightened out of my life.'\n\n'There now, Miss Maud, dear--there now, don't take on so--why should\nshe?--no sich a thing. Mrs. Rusk, law bless you, she's no more meaning in\nwhat she says than the child unborn.'\n\nBut I was really frightened. I was in a horrible state of uncertainty as to\nMadame de la Rougierre's complicity with the party who had beset us at the\nwarren, and afterwards so murderously beat our poor gamekeeper. How was\nI ever to get rid of that horrible woman? How long was she to enjoy her\ncontinual opportunities of affrighting and injuring me?\n\n'She hates me--she hates me, Mary Quince; and she will never stop until she\nhas done me some dreadful injury. Oh! will no one relieve me--will no one\ntake her away? Oh, papa, papa, papa! you will be sorry when it is too\nlate.'\n\nI was crying and wringing my hands, and turning from side to side, at my\nwits' ends, and honest Mary Quince in vain endevoured to quiet and comfort\nme.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n_A MIDNIGHT VISITOR_\n\n\nThe frightful warnings of Lady Knollys haunted me too. Was there no escape\nfrom the dreadful companion whom fate had assigned me? I made up my mind\nagain and again to speak to my father and urge her removal. In other things\nhe indulged me; here, however, he met me drily and sternly, and it was\nplain that he fancied I was under my cousin Monica's influence, and also\nthat he had secret reasons for persisting in an opposite course. Just then\nI had a gay, odd letter from Lady Knollys, from some country house in\nShropshire. Not a word about Captain Oakley. My eye skimmed its pages in\nsearch of that charmed name. With a peevish feeling I tossed the sheet upon\nthe table. Inwardly I thought how ill-natured and unwomanly it was.\n\nAfter a time, however, I read it, and found the letter very good-natured.\nShe had received a note from papa. He had 'had the impudence to forgive\n_her_ for _his_ impertinence.' But for my sake she meant, notwithstanding\nthis aggravation, really to pardon him; and whenever she had a disengaged\nweek, to accept his invitation to Knowl, from whence she was resolved to\nwhisk me off to London, where, though I was too young to be presented at\nCourt and come out, I might yet--besides having the best masters and a good\nexcuse for getting rid of Medusa--see a great deal that would amuse and\nsurprise me.\n\n'Great news, I suppose, from Lady Knollys?' said Madame, who always knew\nwho in the house received letters by the post, and by an intuition from\nwhom they came.\n\n'Two letters--you and your papa. She is quite well, I hope?'\n\n'Quite well, thank you, Madame.'\n\nSome fishing questions, dropped from time to time, fared no better. And\nas usual, when she was foiled even in a trifle, she became sullen and\nmalignant.\n\nThat night, when my father and I were alone, he suddenly closed the book he\nhad been reading, and said--\n\n'I heard from Monica Knollys to-day. I always liked poor Monnie; and though\nshe's no witch, and very wrong-headed at times, yet now and then she does\nsay a thing that's worth weighing. Did she ever talk to you of a time,\nMaud, when you are to be your own mistress?'\n\n'No,' I answered, a little puzzled, and looking straight in his rugged,\nkindly face.\n\n'Well, I thought she might--she's a rattle, you know--always _was_ a\nrattle, and that sort of people say whatever comes uppermost. But that's a\nsubject for me, and more than once, Maud, it has puzzled me.'\n\nHe sighed.\n\n'Come with me to the study, little Maud.'\n\nSo, he carrying a candle, we crossed the lobby, and marched together\nthrough the passage, which at night always seemed a little awesome, darkly\nwainscoted, uncheered by the cross-light from the hall, which was lost at\nthe turn, leading us away from the frequented parts of the house to that\nmisshapen and lonely room about which the traditions of the nursery and the\nservants' hall had had so many fearful stories to recount.\n\nI think my father had intended making some disclosure to me on reaching\nthis room. If so, he changed his mind, or at least postponed his intention.\n\nHe had paused before the cabinet, respecting the key of which he had given\nme so strict a charge, and I think he was going to explain himself more\nfully than he had done. But he went on, instead, to the table where his\ndesk, always jealously locked, was placed, and having lighted the candles\nwhich stood by it, he glanced at me, and said--\n\n'You must wait a little, Maud; I shall have something to say to you. Take\nthis candle and amuse yourself with a book meanwhile.'\n\nI was accustomed to obey in silence. I chose a volume of engravings,\nand ensconced myself in a favourite nook in which I had often passed a\nhalf-hour similarly. This was a deep recess by the fireplace, fenced on the\nother side by a great old escritoir. Into this I drew a stool, and, with\ncandle and book, I placed myself snugly in the narrow chamber. Every now\nand then I raised my eyes and saw my father either writing or ruminating,\nas it seemed to me, very anxiously at his desk.\n\nTime wore on--a longer time than he had intended, and still he continued\nabsorbed at his desk. Gradually I grew sleepy, and as I nodded, the book\nand room faded away, and pleasant little dreams began to gather round me,\nand so I went off into a deep slumber.\n\nIt must have lasted long, for when I wakened my candle had burnt out; my\nfather, having quite forgotten me, was gone, and the room was dark and\ndeserted. I felt cold and a little stiff, and for some seconds did not know\nwhere I was.\n\nI had been wakened, I suppose, by a sound which I now distinctly heard, to\nmy great terror, approaching. There was a rustling; there was a breathing.\nI heard a creaking upon the plank that always creaked when walked upon in\nthe passage. I held my breath and listened, and coiled myself up in the\ninnermost recess of my little chamber.\n\nSudden and sharp, a light shone in from the nearly-closed study door. It\nshone angularly on the ceiling like a letter L reversed. There was a pause.\nThen some one knocked softly at the door, which after another pause was\nslowly pushed open. I expected, I think, to see the dreaded figure of\nthe linkman. I was scarcely less frightened to see that of Madame de la\nRougierre. She was dressed in a sort of grey silk, which she called her\nChinese silk--precisely as she had been in the daytime. In fact, I do not\nthink she had undressed. She had no shoes on. Otherwise her toilet was\ndeficient in nothing. Her wide mouth was grimly closed, and she stood\nscowling into the room with a searching and pallid scrutiny, the candle\nheld high above her head at the full stretch of her arm.\n\nPlaced as I was in a deep recess, and in a seat hardly raised above the\nlevel of the floor, I escaped her, although it seemed to me for some\nseconds, as I gazed on this spectre, that our eyes actually met.\n\nI sat without breathing or winking, staring upon the formidable image which\nwith upstretched arm, and the sharp lights and hard shadows thrown upon her\ncorrugated features, looked like a sorceress watching for the effect of a\nspell.\n\nShe was plainly listening intensely. Unconsciously she had drawn her lower\nlip altogether between her teeth, and I well remember what a deathlike and\nidiotic look the contortion gave her. My terror lest she should discover me\namounted to positive agony. She rolled her eyes stealthily from corner to\ncorner of the room, and listened with her neck awry at the door.\n\nThen to my father's desk she went. To my great relief, her back was towards\nme. She stooped over it, with the candle close by; I saw her try a key--it\ncould be nothing else--and I heard her blow through the wards to clear\nthem.\n\nThen, again, she listened at the door, candle in hand, and then with long\ntiptoe steps came back, and papa's desk in another moment was open, and\nMadame cautiously turning over the papers it contained.\n\nTwice or thrice she paused, glided to the door, and listened again intently\nwith her head near the ground, and then returned and continued her search,\npeeping into papers one after another, tolerably methodically, and reading\nsome quite through.\n\nWhile this felonious business was going on, I was freezing with fear lest\nshe should accidentally look round and her eyes light on me; for I could\nnot say what she might not do rather than have her crime discovered.\n\nSometimes she would read a paper twice over; sometimes a whisper no louder\nthan the ticking of a watch, sometimes a brief chuckle under her breath,\nbespoke the interest with which here and there a letter or a memorandum was\nread.\n\nFor about half an hour, I think, this went on; but at the time it seemed to\nme all but interminable. On a sudden she raised her head and listened for a\nmoment, replaced the papers deftly, closed the desk without noise, except\nfor the tiny click of the lock, extinguished the candle, and rustled\nstealthily out of the room, leaving in the darkness the malign and hag-like\nface on which the candle had just shone still floating filmy in the dark.\n\nWhy did I remain silent and motionless while such an outrage was being\ncommitted? If, instead of being a very nervous girl, preoccupied with\nan undefinable terror of that wicked woman, I had possessed courage and\npresence of mind, I dare say I might have given an alarm, and escaped from\nthe room without the slightest risk. But so it was; I could no more stir\nthan the bird who, cowering under its ivy, sees the white owl sailing back\nand forward under its predatory cruise.\n\nNot only during her presence, but for more than an hour after, I remained\ncowering in my hiding-place, and afraid to stir, lest she might either be\nlurking in the neighborhood, or return and surprise me.\n\nYou will not be astonished, that after a night so passed I was ill and\nfeverish in the morning. To my horror, Madame de la Rougierre came to visit\nme at my bedside. Not a trace of guilty consciousness of what had passed\nduring the night was legible in her face. She had no sign of late watching,\nand her toilet was exemplary.\n\nAs she sat smiling by me, full of anxious and affectionate enquiry,\nand smoothed the coverlet with her great felonious hand, I could quite\ncomprehend the dreadful feeling with which the deceived husband in the\n'Arabian Nights' met his ghoul wife, after his nocturnal discovery.\n\nIll as I was, I got up and found my father in that room which adjoined his\nbedchamber. He perceived, I am sure, by my looks, that something unusual\nhad happened. I shut the door, and came close beside his chair.\n\n'Oh, papa, I have such a thing to tell you!' I forgot to call him 'Sir.' 'A\nsecret; and you won't say who told you? Will you come down to the study?'\n\nHe looked hard at me, got up, and kissing my forehead, said--'Don't be\nfrightened, Maud; I venture to say it is a mare's nest; at all events, my\nchild, we will take care that no danger reaches you; come, child.'\n\nAnd by the hand he led me to the study. When the door was shut, and we had\nreached the far end of the room next the window, I said, but in a low tone,\nand holding his arm fast--\n\n'Oh, sir, you don't know what a dreadful person we have living with\nus--Madame de la Rougierre, I mean. Don't let her in if she comes; she\nwould guess what I am telling you, and one way or another I am sure she\nwould kill me.'\n\n'Tut, tut, child. You _must_ know that's nonsense,' he said, looking pale\nand stern.\n\n'Oh no, papa. I am horribly frightened, and Lady Knollys thinks so too.'\n\n'Ha! I dare say; one fool makes many. We all know what Monica thinks.'\n\n'But I _saw_ it, papa. She stole your key last night, and opened your desk,\nand read all your papers.'\n\n'Stole my key!' said my father, staring at me perplexed, but at the same\ninstant producing it. 'Stole it! Why here it is!'\n\n'She unlocked your desk; she read your papers for ever so long. Open it\nnow, and see whether they have not been stirred.'\n\nHe looked at me this time in silence, with a puzzled air; but he did unlock\nthe desk, and lifted the papers curiously and suspiciously. As he did so\nhe uttered a few of those inarticulate interjections which are made with\nclosed lips, and not always intelligible; but he made no remark.\n\nThen he placed me on a chair beside him, and sitting down himself, told\nme to recollect myself, and tell him distinctly all I had seen. This\naccordingly I did, he listening with deep attention.\n\n'Did she remove any paper?' asked my father, at the same time making a\nlittle search, I suppose, for that which he fancied might have been stolen.\n\n'No; I did not see her take anything.'\n\n'Well, you are a good girl, Maud. Act discreetly. Say nothing to\nanyone--not even to your cousin Monica.'\n\nDirections which, coming from another person would have had no great\nweight, were spoken by my father with an earnest look and a weight of\nemphasis that made them irresistibly impressive, and I went away with the\nseal of silence upon my lips.\n\n'Sit down, Maud, _there_. You have not been very happy with Madame de la\nRougierre. It is time you were relieved. This occurrence decides it.'\n\nHe rang the bell.\n\n'Tell Madame de la Rougierre that I request the honour of seeing her for a\nfew minutes here.'\n\nMy father's communications to her were always equally ceremonious. In a\nfew minutes there was a knock at the door, and the same figure, smiling,\ncourtesying, that had scared me on the threshold last night, like the\nspirit of evil, presented itself.\n\nMy father rose, and Madame having at his request taken a chair opposite,\nlooking, as usual in his presence, all amiability, he proceeded at once to\nthe point.\n\n'Madame de la Rougierre, I have to request you that you will give me the\nkey now in your possession, which unlocks this desk of mine.'\n\nWith which termination he tapped his gold pencil-case suddenly on it.\n\nMadame, who had expected something very different, became instantly so\npale, with a dull purplish hue upon her forehead, that, especially when she\nhad twice essayed with her white lips, in vain, to answer, I expected to\nsee her fall in a fit.\n\nShe was not looking in his face; her eyes were fixed lower, and her mouth\nand cheek sucked in, with a strange distortion at one side.\n\nShe stood up suddenly, and staring straight in his face, she succeeded in\nsaying, after twice clearing her throat--\n\n'I cannot comprehend, Monsieur Ruthyn, unless you intend to insult me.'\n\n'It won't do, Madame; I must have that false key. I give you the\nopportunity of surrendering it quietly here and now.'\n\n'But who dares to say I possess such thing?' demanded Madame, who, having\nrallied from her momentary paralysis, was now fierce and voluble as I had\noften seen her before.\n\n'You know, Madame, that you can rely on what I say, and I tell you that you\nwere seen last night visiting this room, and with a key in your possession,\nopening this desk, and reading my letters and papers contained in it.\nUnless you forthwith give me that key, and any other false keys in your\npossession--in which case I shall rest content with dismissing you\nsummarily--I will take a different course. You know I am a magistrate;--and\nI shall have you, your boxes, and places up-stairs, searched forthwith,\nand I will prosecute you criminally. The thing is clear; you aggravate by\ndenying; you must give me that key, if you please, instantly, otherwise I\nring this bell, and you shall see that I mean what I say.'\n\nThere was a little pause. He rose and extended his hand towards the\nbell-rope. Madame glided round the table, extended her hand to arrest his.\n\n'I will do everything, Monsieur Ruthyn--whatever you wish.'\n\nAnd with these words Madame de la Rougierre broke down altogether. She\nsobbed, she wept, she gabbled piteously, all manner of incomprehensible\nroulades of lamentation and entreaty; coyly, penitently, in a most\ninteresting agitation, she produced the very key from her breast, with a\nstring tied to it. My father was little moved by this piteous tempest. He\ncoolly took the key and tried it in the desk, which it locked and unlocked\nquite freely, though the wards were complicated. He shook his head and\nlooked her in the face.\n\n'Pray, who made this key? It is a new one, and made expressly to pick this\nlock.'\n\nBut Madame was not going to tell any more than she had expressly bargained\nfor; so she only fell once more into her old paroxysm of sorrow,\nself-reproach, extenuation, and entreaty.\n\n'Well,' said my father,' I promised that on surrendering the key you should\ngo. It is enough. I keep my word. You shall have an hour and a half to\nprepare in. You must then be ready to depart. I will send your money to you\nby Mrs. Rusk; and if you look for another situation, you had better not\nrefer to me. Now be so good as to leave me.'\n\nMadame seemed to be in a strange perplexity. She bridled up, dried her eyes\nfiercely, and dropped a great courtesy, and then sailed away towards the\ndoor. Before reaching it she stopped on the way, turning half round, with\na peaked, pallid glance at my father, and she bit her lip viciously as she\neyed him. At the door the same repulsive pantomime was repeated, as she\nstood for a moment with her hand upon the handle. But she changed her\nbearing again with a sniff, and with a look of scorn, almost heightened to\na sneer, she made another very low courtesy and a disdainful toss of her\nhead, and so disappeared, shutting the door rather sharply behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n_AU REVOIR_\n\n\nMrs. Rusk was fond of assuring me that Madame 'did not like a bone in my\nskin.' Instinctively I knew that she bore me no good-will, although I\nreally believe it was her wish to make me think quite the reverse. At all\nevents I had no desire to see Madame again before her departure, especially\nas she had thrown upon me one momentary glance in the study, which seemed\nto me charged with very peculiar feelings.\n\nYou may be very sure, therefore, that I had no desire for a formal\nleave-taking at her departure. I took my hat and cloak, therefore, and\nstole out quietly.\n\nMy ramble was a sequestered one, and well screened, even at this late\nseason, with foliage; the pathway devious among the stems of old trees, and\nits flooring interlaced and groined with their knotted roots. Though near\nthe house, it was a sylvan solitude; a little brook ran darkling and\nglimmering through it, wild strawberries and other woodland plants strewed\nthe ground, and the sweet notes and flutter of small birds made the shadow\nof the boughs cheery.\n\nI had been fully an hour in this picturesque solitude when I heard in the\ndistance the ring of carriage-wheels, announcing to me that Madame de la\nRougierre had fairly set out upon her travels. I thanked heaven; I could\nhave danced and sung with delight; I heaved a great sigh and looked up\nthrough the branches to the clear blue sky.\n\nBut things are oddly timed. Just at this moment I heard Madame's voice\nclose at my ear, and her large bony hand was laid on my shoulder. We were\ninstantly face to face--I recoiling, and for a moment speechless with\nfright.\n\nIn very early youth we do not appreciate the restraints which act upon\nmalignity, or know how effectually fear protects us where conscience is\nwanting. Quite alone, in this solitary spot, detected and overtaken with an\nawful instinct by my enemy, what might not be about to happen to me at that\nmoment?\n\n'Frightened as usual, Maud,' she said quietly, and eyeing me with a\nsinister smile, 'and with cause you think, no doubt. Wat 'av you done to\ninjure poor Madame? Well, I think I know, little girl, and have quite\ndiscover the cleverness of my sweet little Maud. Eh--is not so? Petite\ncarogne--ah, ha, ha!'\n\nI was too much confounded to answer.\n\n'You see, my dear cheaile,' she said, shaking her uplifted finger with a\nhideous archness at me, 'you could not hide what you 'av done from poor\nMadame. You cannot look so innocent but I can see your pretty little\nvillany quite plain--you dear little diablesse.\n\n'Wat I 'av done I 'av no reproach of myself for it. If I could explain,\nyour papa would say I 'av done right, and you should thank me on your\nknees; but I cannot explain yet.'\n\nShe was speaking, as it were, in little paragraphs, with a momentary pause\nbetween each, to allow its meaning to impress itself.\n\n'If I were to choose to explain, your papa he would implore me to remain.\nBut no--I would not--notwithstanding your so cheerful house, your charming\nservants, your papa's amusing society, and your affectionate and sincere\nheart, my sweet little maraude.\n\n'I am to go to London first, where I 'av, oh, so good friends! next I will\ngo abroad for some time; but be sure, my sweetest Maud, wherever I may\n'appen to be, I will remember you--ah, ha! Yes; _most certainly_, I will\nremember you.\n\n'And although I shall not be always near, yet I shall know everything\nabout my charming little Maud; you will not know how, but I shall indeed,\n_everything_. And be sure, my dearest cheaile, I will some time be able to\ngive you the sensible proofs of my gratitude and affection--you understand.\n\n'The carriage is waiting at the yew-tree stile, and I must go on. You did\nnot expect to see me--here; I will appear, perhaps, as suddenly another\ntime. It is great pleasure to us both--this opportunity to make our adieux.\nFarewell! my dearest little Maud. I will never cease to think of you, and\nof some way to recompense the kindness you 'av shown for poor Madame.'\n\nMy hand hung by my side, and she took, not it, but my thumb, and shook\nit, folded in her broad palm, and looking on me as she held it, as if\nmeditating mischief. Then suddenly she said--\n\n'You will always remember Madame, I _think_, and I will remind you of me\nbeside; and for the present farewell, and I hope you may be as 'appy as you\ndeserve.'\n\nThe large sinister face looked on me for a second with its latent sneer,\nand then, with a sharp nod and a spasmodic shake of my imprisoned thumb,\nshe turned, and holding her dress together, and showing her great bony\nankles, she strode rapidly away over the gnarled roots into the perspective\nof the trees, and I did not awake, as it were, until she had quite\ndisappeared in the distance.\n\nEvents of this kind made no difference with my father; but every other face\nin Knowl was gladdened by the removal. My energies had returned, my spirits\nwere come again. The sunlight was happy, the flowers innocent, the songs\nand flutter of the birds once more gay, and all nature delightful and\nrejoicing.\n\nAfter the first elation of relief, now and then a filmy shadow of Madame de\nla Rougierre would glide across the sunlight, and the remembrance of her\nmenace return with an unexpected pang of fear.\n\n'Well, if _there_ isn't impittens!' cried Mrs. Rusk. 'But never you trouble\nyour head about it, Miss. Them sort's all alike--you never saw a rogue yet\nthat was found out and didn't threaten the honest folk as he was leaving\nbehind with all sorts; there was Martin the gamekeeper, and Jervis the\nfootman, I mind well how hard they swore all they would not do when they\nwas a-going, and who ever heard of them since? They always threatens that\nway--them sort always does, and none ever the worse--not but she would if\nshe could, mind ye, but there it is; she can't do nothing but bite her\nnails and cuss us--not she--ha, ha, ha!'\n\nSo I was comforted. But Madame's evil smile, nevertheless, from time to\ntime, would sail across my vision with a silent menace, and my spirits\nsank, and a Fate, draped in black, whose face I could not see, took me by\nthe hand, and led me away, in the spirit, silently, on an awful exploration\nfrom which I would rouse myself with a start, and Madame was gone for a\nwhile.\n\nShe had, however, judged her little parting well. She contrived to leave\nher glamour over me, and in my dreams she troubled me.\n\nI was, however, indescribably relieved. I wrote in high spirits to Cousin\nMonica; and wondered what plans my father might have formed about me, and\nwhether we were to stay at home, or go to London, or go abroad. Of the\nlast--the pleasantest arrangement, in some respects--I had nevertheless an\noccult horror. A secret conviction haunted me that were we to go abroad, we\nshould there meet Madame, which to me was like meeting my evil genius.\n\nI have said more than once that my father was an odd man; and the reader\nwill, by this time, have seen that there was much about him not easily\nunderstood. I often wonder whether, if he had been franker, I should have\nfound him less odd than I supposed, or more odd still. Things that moved me\nprofoundly did not apparently affect him at all. The departure of Madame,\nunder the circumstances which attended it, appeared to my childish mind an\nevent of the vastest importance. No one was indifferent to the occurrence\nin the house but its master. He never alluded again to Madame de la\nRougierre. But whether connected with her exposure and dismissal, I could\nnot say, there did appear to be some new care or trouble now at work in my\nfather's mind.\n\n'I have been thinking a great deal about you, Maud. I am anxious. I have\nnot been so troubled for years. Why has not Monica Knollys a little more\nsense?'\n\nThis oracular sentence he spoke, having stopped me in the hall; and then\nsaying, 'We shall see,' he left me as abruptly as he appeared.\n\nDid he apprehend any danger to me from the vindictiveness of Madame?\n\nA day or two afterwards, as I was in the Dutch garden, I saw him on the\nterrace steps. He beckoned to me, and came to meet me as I approached.\n\n'You must be very solitary, little Maud; it is not good. I have written to\nMonica: in a matter of detail she is competent to advise; perhaps she will\ncome here for a short visit.'\n\nI was very glad to hear this.\n\n'_You_ are more interested than for my time _I_ can be, in vindicating his\ncharacter.'\n\n'Whose character, sir?' I ventured to enquire during the pause that\nfollowed.\n\nOne trick which my father had acquired from his habits of solitude and\nsilence was this of assuming that the context of his thoughts was legible\nto others, forgetting that they had not been spoken.\n\n'Whose?--your uncle Silas's. In the course of nature he must survive me. He\nwill then represent the family name. Would you make some sacrifice to clear\nthat name, Maud?'\n\nI answered briefly; but my face, I believe, showed my enthusiasm.\n\nHe turned on me such an approving smile as you might fancy lighting up the\nrugged features of a pale old Rembrandt.\n\n'I can tell you, Maud; if my life could have done it, it should not have\nbeen undone--_ubi lapsus, quid feci_. But I had almost made up my mind to\nchange my plan, and leave all to time--_edax rerum_--to illuminate or\nto _consume_. But I think little Maud would like to contribute to the\nrestitution of her family name. It may cost you something--are you willing\nto buy it at a sacrifice? Is there--I don't speak of fortune, that is not\ninvolved--but is there any other honourable sacrifice you would shrink from\nto dispel the disgrace under which our most ancient and honourable name\nmust otherwise continue to languish?'\n\n'Oh, none--none indeed, sir--I am delighted!'\n\nAgain I saw the Rembrandt smile.\n\n'Well, Maud, I am sure there is _no_ risk; but you are to suppose there is.\nAre you still willing to accept it?'\n\nAgain I assented.\n\n'You are worthy of your blood, Maud Ruthyn. It will come soon, and it won't\nlast long. But you must not let people like Monica Knollys frighten you.'\n\nI was lost in wonder.\n\n'If you allow them to possess you with their follies, you had better recede\nin time--they may make the ordeal as terrible as hell itself. You have\nzeal--have you nerve?' I thought in such a cause I had nerve for anything.\n\n'Well, Maud, in the course of a few months--and it may be sooner--there\nmust be a change. I have had a letter from London this morning that assures\nme of that. I must then leave you for a time; in my absence be faithful to\nthe duties that will arise. To whom much is committed, of him will much be\nrequired. You shall promise me not to mention this conversation to Monica\nKnollys. If you are a talking girl, and cannot trust yourself, say so, and\nwe will not ask her to come. Also, don't invite her to talk about your\nuncle Silas--I have reasons. Do you quite understand my conditions?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Your uncle Silas,' he said, speaking suddenly in loud and fierce tones\nthat sounded from so old a man almost terrible, 'lies under an intolerable\nslander. I don't correspond with him; I don't sympathise with him; I never\nquite did. He has grown religious, and that's well; but there are things in\nwhich even religion should not bring a man to acquiesce; and from what\nI can learn, he, the person primarily affected--the cause, though the\ninnocent cause--of this great calamity--bears it with an easy apathy which\nis mistaken, and liable easily to be mistaken, and such as no Ruthyn, under\nthe circumstances, ought to exhibit. I told him what he ought to do, and\noffered to open my purse for the purpose; but he would not, or _did_ not;\nindeed, he _never_ took my advice; he followed his own, and a foul and\ndismal shoal he has drifted on. It is not for his sake--why should I?-that\nI have longed and laboured to remove the disgraceful slur under which\nhis ill-fortune has thrown us. He troubles himself little about it, I\nbelieve--he's meek, meeker than I. He cares less about his children than I\nabout you, Maud; he is selfishly sunk in futurity--a feeble visionary. I am\nnot so. I believe it to be a duty to take care of others beside myself. The\ncharacter and influence of an ancient family is a peculiar heritage--sacred\nbut destructible; and woe to him who either destroys or suffers it to\nperish!'\n\nThis was the longest speech I ever heard my father speak before or after.\nHe abruptly resumed--\n\n'Yes, we will, Maud--you and I--we'll leave one proof on record, which,\nfairly read, will go far to convince the world.'\n\nHe looked round, but we were alone. The garden was nearly always solitary,\nand few visitors ever approached the house from that side.\n\n'I have talked too long, I believe; we are children to the last. Leave me,\nMaud. I think I know you better than I did, and I am pleased with you. Go,\nchild--I'll sit here.'\n\nIf he had acquired new ideas of me, so had I of him from that interview. I\nhad no idea till then how much passion still burned in that aged frame, nor\nhow full of energy and fire that face, generally so stern and ashen, could\nappear. As I left him seated on the rustic chair, by the steps, the traces\nof that storm were still discernible on his features. His gathered brows,\nglowing eyes, and strangely hectic face, and the grim compression of his\nmouth, still showed the agitation which, somehow, in grey old age, shocks\nand alarms the young.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n_AUSTIN RUTHYN SETS OUT ON HIS JOURNEY_\n\n\nThe Rev. William Fairfield, Doctor Clay's somewhat bald curate, a mild,\nthin man, with a high and thin nose, who was preparing me for confirmation,\ncame next day; and when our catechetical conference was ended, and before\nlunch was announced, my father sent for him to the study, where he remained\nuntil the bell rang out its summons.\n\n'We have had some interesting--I may say _very_ interesting--conversation,\nyour papa and I, Miss Ruthyn,' said my reverend _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_, so soon as\nnature was refreshed, smiling and shining, as he leaned back in his chair,\nhis hand upon the table, and his finger curled gently upon the stem of his\nwine-glass. 'It never was your privilege, I believe, to see your uncle, Mr.\nSilas Ruthyn, of Bartram-Haugh?'\n\n'No--never; he leads so retired--so _very_ retired a life.'\n\n'Oh, no,--of course, no; but I was going to remark a likeness--I mean,\nof course, a _family_ likeness--only _that_ sort of thing--you\nunderstand--between him and the profile of Lady Margaret in the\ndrawing-room--is not it Lady Margaret?--which you were so good as to show\nme on Wednesday last. There certainly _is_ a likeness. I _think_ you would\nagree with me, if you had the pleasure of seeing your uncle.'\n\n'You know him, then? I have never seen him.'\n\n'Oh dear, yes--I am happy to say, I know him very well. I have that\nprivilege. I was for three years curate of Feltram, and I had the honour of\nbeing a pretty constant visitor at Bartram-Haugh during that, I may say,\nprotracted period; and I think it really never has been my privilege and\nhappiness, I may say, to enjoy the acquaintance and society of so very\nexperienced a Christian, as my admirable friend, I may call him, Mr.\nRuthyn, of Bartram-Haugh. I look upon him, I do assure you, quite in the\nlight of a saint; not, of course, in the Popish sense, but in the very\nhighest, you will understand me, which _our_ Church allows,--a man built up\nin faith--full of faith--faith and grace--altogether exemplary; and I\noften ventured to regret, Miss Ruthyn, that Providence in its mysterious\ndispensations should have placed him so far apart from his brother, your\nrespected father. His influence and opportunities would, no doubt, we may\nventure to hope, at least have been blessed; and, perhaps, we--my valued\nrector and I--might possibly have seen more of him at church, than, I\ndeeply regret, we _have_ done.' He shook his head a little, as he smiled\nwith a sad complacency on me through his blue steel spectacles, and then\nsipped a little meditative sherry.\n\n'And you saw a good deal of my uncle?'\n\n'Well, a _good_ deal, Miss Ruthyn--I may say a _good_ deal--principally at\nhis own house. His health is wretched--miserable health--a sadly afflicted\nman he has been, as, no doubt, you are aware. But afflictions, my dear Miss\nRuthyn, as you remember Doctor Clay so well remarked on Sunday last, though\nbirds of ill omen, yet spiritually resemble the ravens who supplied the\nprophet; and when they visit the faithful, come charged with nourishment\nfor the soul.\n\n'He is a good deal embarrassed pecuniarily, I should say,' continued the\ncurate, who was rather a good man than a very well-bred one. 'He found a\ndifficulty--in fact it was not in his power--to subscribe generally to our\nlittle funds, and--and objects, and I used to say to him, and I really felt\nit, that it was more gratifying, such were his feeling and his power of\nexpression, to be refused by him than assisted by others.'\n\n'Did papa wish you to speak to me about my uncle?' I enquired, as a sudden\nthought struck me; and then I felt half ashamed of my question.\n\nHe looked surprised.\n\n'No, Miss Ruthyn, certainly not. Oh dear, no. It was merely a conversation\nbetween Mr. Ruthyn and me. He never suggested my opening that, or indeed\nany other point in my interview with you, Miss Ruthyn--not the least.'\n\n'I was not aware before that Uncle Silas was so religious.'\n\nHe smiled tranquilly, not quite up to the ceiling, but gently upward, and\nshook his head in pity for my previous ignorance, as he lowered his eyes--\n\n'I don't say that there may not be some little matters in a few points of\ndoctrine which we could, perhaps, wish otherwise. But these, you know,\nare speculative, and in all essentials he is Church--not in the perverted\nmodern sense; far from it--unexceptionably Church, strictly so. Would there\nwere more among us of the same mind that is in him! Ay, Miss Ruthyn, even\nin the highest places of the Church herself.'\n\nThe Rev. William Fairfield, while fighting against the Dissenters with his\nright hand, was, with his left, hotly engaged with the Tractarians. A good\nman I am sure he was, and I dare say sound in doctrine, though naturally, I\nthink, not very wise. This conversation with him gave me new ideas about my\nuncle Silas. It quite agreed with what my father had said. These principles\nand his increasing years would necessarily quiet the turbulence of his\nresistance to injustice, and teach him to acquiesce in his fate.\n\nYou would have fancied that one so young as I, born to wealth so vast, and\nliving a life of such entire seclusion, would have been exempt from care.\nBut you have seen how troubled my life was with fear and anxiety during the\nresidence of Madame de la Rougierre, and now there rested upon my mind a\nvague and awful anticipation of the trial which my father had announced,\nwithout defining it.\n\nAn 'ordeal' he called it, requiring not only zeal but nerve, which might\npossibly, were my courage to fail, become frightful, and even intolerable.\nWhat, and of what nature, could it be? Not designed to vindicate the fair\nfame of the meek and submissive old man--who, it seemed, had ceased to care\nfor his bygone wrongs, and was looking to futurity--but the reputation of\nour ancient family.\n\nSometimes I repented my temerity in having undertaken it. I distrusted my\ncourage. Had I not better retreat, while it was yet time? But there was\nshame and even difficulty in the thought. How should I appear before my\nfather? Was it not important--had I not deliberately undertaken it--and was\nI not bound in conscience? Perhaps he had already taken steps in the matter\nwhich committed _him_. Besides, was I sure that, even were I free again, I\nwould not once more devote myself to the trial, be it what it might?\nYou perceive I had more spirit than courage. I think I had the mental\nattributes of courage; but then I was but a hysterical girl, and in so far\nneither more nor less than a coward.\n\nNo wonder I distrusted myself; no wonder also my will stood out against\nmy timidity. It was a struggle, then; a proud, wild resolve against\nconstitutional cowardice.\n\nThose who have ever had cast upon them more than their strength\nseemed framed to bear--the weak, the aspiring, the adventurous and\nself-sacrificing in will, and the faltering in nerve--will understand the\nkind of agony which I sometimes endured.\n\nBut, again, consolation would come, and it seemed to me that I must be\nexaggerating my risk in the coming crisis; and certain at least, if my\nfather believed it attended with real peril, he would never have wished\nto see me involved in it. But the silence under which I was bound was\nterrifying--double so when the danger was so shapeless and undivulged.\n\nI was soon to understand it all--soon, too, to know all about my father's\nimpending journey, whither, with what visitor, and why guarded from me with\nso awful a mystery.\n\nThat day there came a lively and goodnatured letter from Lady Knollys. She\nwas to arrive at Knowl in two or three days' time. I thought my father\nwould have been pleased, but he seemed apathetic and dejected.\n\n'One does not always feel quite equal to Monica. But for you--yes, thank\nGod. I wish she could only stay, Maud, for a month or two; I may be going\nthen, and would be glad--provided she talks about suitable things--very\nglad, Maud, to leave her with you for a week or so.'\n\nThere was something, I thought, agitating my father secretly that day. He\nhad the strange hectic flush I had observed when he grew excited in our\ninterview in the garden about Uncle Silas. There was something painful,\nperhaps even terrible, in the circumstances of the journey he was about\nto make, and from my heart I wished the suspense were over, the annoyance\npast, and he returned.\n\nThat night my father bid me good-night early and went upstairs. After I\nhad been in bed some little time, I heard his hand-bell ring. This was not\nusual. Shortly after I heard his man, Ridley, talking with Mrs. Rusk in\nthe gallery. I could not be mistaken in their voices. I knew not why I was\nstartled and excited, and had raised myself to listen on my elbow. But they\nwere talking quietly, like persons giving or taking an ordinary direction,\nand not in the haste of an unusual emergency.\n\nThen I heard the man bid Mrs. Rusk good-night and walk down the gallery\nto the stairs, so that I concluded he was wanted no more, and all must\ntherefore be well. So I laid myself down again, though with a throbbing at\nmy heart, and an ominous feeling of expectation, listening and fancying\nfootsteps.\n\nI was going to sleep when I heard the bell ring again; and, in a few\nminutes, Mrs. Rusk's energetic step passed along the gallery; and,\nlistening intently, I heard, or fancied, my father's voice and hers in\ndialogue. All this was very unusual, and again I was, with a beating heart,\nleaning with my elbow on my pillow.\n\nMrs. Rusk came along the gallery in a minute or so after, and stopping at\nmy door, began to open it gently. I was startled, and challenged my visitor\nwith--\n\n'Who's there?'\n\n'It's only Rusk, Miss. Dearie me! and are you awake still?'\n\n'Is papa ill?'\n\n'Ill! not a bit ill, thank God. Only there's a little black book as I took\nfor your prayer-book, and brought in here; ay, here it is, sure enough, and\nhe wants it. And then I must go down to the study, and look out this one,\n\"C, 15;\" but I can't read the name, noways; and I was afraid to ask him\nagain; if you be so kind to read it, Miss--I suspeck my eyes is a-going.'\n\nI read the name; and Mrs. Rusk was tolerably expert at finding out books,\nas she had often been employed in that way before. So she departed.\n\nI suppose that this particular volume was hard to find, for she must have\nbeen a long time away, and I had actually fallen into a doze when I was\nroused in an instant by a dreadful crash and a piercing scream from Mrs.\nRusk. Scream followed scream, wilder and more terror-stricken. I shrieked\nto Mary Quince, who was sleeping in the room with me:--'Mary, do you hear?\nwhat is it? It is something dreadful.'\n\nThe crash was so tremendous that the solid flooring even of my room\ntrembled under it, and to me it seemed as if some heavy man had burst\nthrough the top of the window, and shook the whole house with his descent.\nI found myself standing at my own door, crying, 'Help, help! murder!\nmurder!' and Mary Quince, frightened half out of her wits, by my side.\n\nI could not think what was going on. It was plainly something most\nhorrible, for Mrs. Rusk's screams pealed one after the other unabated,\nthough with a muffled sound, as if the door was shut upon her; and by this\ntime the bells of my father's room were ringing madly.\n\n'They are trying to murder him!' I cried, and I ran along the gallery to\nhis door, followed by Mary Quince, whose white face I shall never forget,\nthough her entreaties only sounded like unmeaning noises in my ears.\n\n'Here! help, help, help!' I cried, trying to force open the door.\n\n'Shove it, shove it, for God's sake! he's across it,' cried Mrs. Rusk's\nvoice from within; 'drive it in. I can't move him.'\n\nI strained all I could at the door, but ineffectually. We heard steps\napproaching. The men were running to the spot, and shouting as they did\nso--\n\n'Never mind; hold on a bit; here we are; all right;' and the like.\n\nWe drew back, as they came up. We were in no condition to be seen. We\nlistened, however, at my open door.\n\nThen came the straining and bumping at the door. Mrs. Rusk's voice subsided\nto a sort of wailing; the men were talking all together, and I suppose the\ndoor opened, for I heard some of the voices, on a sudden, as if in the\nroom; and then came a strange lull, and talking in very low tones, and not\nmuch even of that.\n\n'What is it, Mary? what _can_ it be?' I ejaculated, not knowing what horror\nto suppose. And now, with a counterpane about my shoulders, I called loudly\nand imploringly, in my horror, to know what had happened.\n\nBut I heard only the subdued and eager talk of men engaged in some\nabsorbing task, and the dull sounds of some heavy body being moved.\n\nMrs. Rusk came towards us looking half wild, and pale as a spectre, and\nputting her thin hands to my shoulders, she said--'Now, Miss Maud, darling,\nyou must go back again; 'tisn't no place for you; you'll see all, my\ndarling, time enough--you will. There now, there, like a dear, do get into\nyour room.'\n\nWhat was that dreadful sound? Who had entered my father's chamber? It was\nthe visitor whom we had so long expected, with whom he was to make the\nunknown journey, leaving me alone. The intruder was Death!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n_ARRIVALS_\n\n\nMy father was dead--as suddenly as if he had been murdered. One of those\nfearful aneurisms that lie close to the heart, showing no outward sign of\ngiving way in a moment, had been detected a good time since by Dr. Bryerly.\nMy father knew what must happen, and that it could not be long deferred.\nHe feared to tell me that he was soon to die. He hinted it only in the\nallegory of his journey, and left in that sad enigma some words of true\nconsolation that remained with me ever after. Under his rugged ways was\nhidden a wonderful tenderness. I could not believe that he was actually\ndead. Most people for a minute or two, in the wild tumult of such a shock,\nhave experienced the same skepticism. I insisted that the doctor should be\ninstantly sent for from the village.\n\n'Well, Miss Maud, dear, I _will_ send to please you, but it is all to no\nuse. If only you saw him yourself you'd know that. Mary Quince, run you\ndown and tell Thomas, Miss Maud desires he'll go down this minute to the\nvillage for Dr. Elweys.'\n\nEvery minute of the interval seemed to me like an hour. I don't know what\nI said, but I fancied that if he were not already dead, he would lose his\nlife by the delay. I suppose I was speaking very wildly, for Mrs. Rusk\nsaid--\n\n'My dear child, you ought to come in and see him; indeed but you should,\nMiss Maud. He's quite dead an hour ago. You'd wonder all the blood that's\ncome from him--you would indeed; it's soaked through the bed already.'\n\n'Oh, don't, don't, _don't_, Mrs. Rusk.'\n\n'Will you come in and see him, just?\n\n'Oh, no, no, no, no!'\n\n'Well, then, my dear, don't of course, if you don't like; there's no need.\nWould not you like to lie down, Miss Maud? Mary Quince, attend to her. I\nmust go into the room for a minute or two.'\n\nI was walking up and down the room in distraction. It was a cool night; but\nI did not feel it. I could only cry:--'Oh, Mary, Mary! what shall I do? Oh,\nMary Quince! what shall I do?'\n\nIt seemed to me it must be near daylight by the time the Doctor arrived. I\nhad dressed myself. I dared not go into the room where my beloved father\nlay.\n\nI had gone out of my room to the gallery, where I awaited Dr. Elweys, when\nI saw him walking briskly after the servant, his coat buttoned up to his\nchin, his hat in his hand, and his bald head shining. I felt myself grow\ncold as ice, and colder and colder, and with a sudden sten my heart seemed\nto stand still.\n\nI heard him ask the maid who stood at the door, in that low, decisive,\nmysterious tone which doctors cultivate--\n\n'In _here_?'\n\nAnd then, with a nod, I saw him enter.\n\n'Would not you like to see the Doctor, Miss Maud?' asked Mary Quince.\n\nThe question roused me a little.\n\n'Thank you, Mary; yes, I must see him.'\n\nAnd so, in a few minutes, I did. He was very respectful, very sad,\nsemi-undertakerlike, in air and countenance, but quite explicit. I heard\nthat my dear father 'had died palpably from the rupture of some great\nvessel near the heart.' The disease had, no doubt, been 'long established,\nand is in its nature incurable.' It is 'consolatory in these cases that in\nthe act of dissolution, which is instantaneous, there can be no suffering.'\nThese, and a few more remarks, were all he had to offer; and having had his\nfee from Mrs. Rusk, he, with a respectful melancholy, vanished.\n\nI returned to my room, and broke into paroxysms of grief, and after an hour\nor more grew more tranquil.\n\nFrom Mrs. Rusk I learned that he had seemed very well--better than usual,\nindeed--that night, and that on her return from the study with the book\nhe required, he was noting down, after his wont, some passages which\nillustrated the text on which he was employing himself. He took the book,\ndetaining her in the room, and then mounting on a chair to take down\nanother book from a shelf, he had fallen, with the dreadful crash I had\nheard, dead upon the floor. He fell across the door, which caused the\ndifficulty in opening it. Mrs. Rusk found she had not strength to force it\nopen. No wonder she had given way to terror. I think I should have almost\nlost my reason.\n\nEveryone knows the reserved aspect and the taciturn mood of the house, one\nof whose rooms is tenanted by that mysterious guest.\n\nI do not know how those awful days, and more awful nights, passed over. The\nremembrance is repulsive. I hate to think of them. I was soon draped in the\nconventional black, with its heavy folds of crape. Lady Knollys came, and\nwas very kind. She undertook the direction of all those details which were\nto me so inexpressibly dreadful. She wrote letters for me beside, and was\nreally most kind and useful, and her society supported me indescribably.\nShe was odd, but her eccentricity was leavened with strong common sense;\nand I have often thought since with admiration and gratitude of the tact\nwith which she managed my grief.\n\nThere is no dealing with great sorrow as if it were under the control of\nour wills. It is a terrible phenomenon, whose laws we must study, and to\nwhose conditions we must submit, if we would mitigate it. Cousin Monica\ntalked a great deal of my father. This was easy to her, for her early\nrecollections were full of him.\n\nOne of the terrible dislocations of our habits of mind respecting the dead\nis that our earthly future is robbed of them, and we thrown exclusively\nupon retrospect. From the long look forward they are removed, and every\nplan, imagination, and hope henceforth a silent and empty perspective. But\nin the past they are all they ever were. Now let me advise all who would\ncomfort people in a new bereavement to talk to them, very freely, all they\ncan, in this way of the dead. They will engage in it with interest, they\nwill talk of their own recollections of the dead, and listen to yours,\nthough they become sometimes pleasant, sometimes even laughable. I found it\nso. It robbed the calamity of something of its supernatural and horrible\nabruptness; it prevented that monotony of object which is to the mind what\nit is to the eye, and prepared the faculty for those mesmeric illusions\nthat derange its sense.\n\nCousin Monica, I am sure, cheered me wonderfully. I grow to love her more\nand more, as I think of all her trouble, care, and kindness.\n\nI had not forgotten my promise to dear papa about the key, concerning which\nhe had evinced so great an anxiety. It was found in the pocket where he had\ndesired me to remember he always kept it, except when it was placed, while\nhe slept, under his pillow.\n\n'And so, my dear, that wicked woman was actually found picking the lock of\nyour poor papa's desk. I _wonder_ he did not punish her--you know that is\n_burglary_.'\n\n'Well, Lady Knollys, you know she is gone, and so I care no more about\nher--that is, I mean, I need not fear her.'\n\n'No, my dear, but you must call me Monica--do you mind--I'm your cousin,\nand you call me Monica, unless you wish to vex me. No, of course, you need\nnot be afraid of her. And she's gone. But I'm an old thing, you know, and\nnot so tender-hearted as you; and I confess I should have been very glad to\nhear that the wicked old witch had been sent to prison and hard labour--I\nshould. And what do you suppose she was looking for--what did she want to\nsteal? I think I can guess--what do _you_ think?'\n\n'To read the papers; maybe to take bank-notes--I'm not sure,' I answered.\n\n'Well, I think most likely she wanted to get at your poor papa's\n_will_--that's _my_ idea.\n\n'There is nothing surprising in the supposition, dear,' she resumed. 'Did\nnot you read the curious trial at York, the other day? There is nothing\nso valuable to steal as a will, when a great deal of property is to be\ndisposed of by it. Why, you would have given her ever so much money to get\nit back again. Suppose you go down, dear--I'll go with you, and open the\ncabinet in the study.'\n\n'I don't think I can, for I promised to give the key to Dr. Bryerly, and\nthe meaning was that _he_ only should open it.'\n\nCousin Monica uttered an inarticulate 'H'm!' of surprise or disapprobation.\n\n'Has he been written to?'\n\n'No, I do not know his address.'\n\n'Not know his address! come, that is curious,' said Knollys, a little\ntestily.\n\nI could not--no one now living in the house could furnish even a\nconjecture. There was even a dispute as to which train he had gone\nby--north or south--they crossed the station at an interval of five\nminutes. If Dr. Bryerly had been an evil spirit, evoked by a secret\nincantation, there could not have been more complete darkness as to the\nimmediate process of his approach.\n\n'And how long do you mean to wait, my dear? No matter; at all events you\nmay open the _desk_; you may find papers to direct you--you may find Dr.\nBryerly's address--you may find, heaven knows what.'\n\nSo down we went--I assenting--and we opened the desk. How dreadful the\ndesecration seems--all privacy abrogated--the shocking compensation for the\nsilence of death!\n\nHenceforward all is circumstantial evidence--all conjectural--except the\n_litera scripta_, and to this evidence every note-book, and every scrap of\npaper and private letter, must contribute--ransacked, bare in the light of\nday--what it can.\n\nAt the top of the desk lay two notes sealed, one to Cousin Monica, the\nother to me. Mine was a gentle and loving little farewell--nothing\nmore--which opened afresh the fountains of my sorrow, and I cried and\nsobbed over it bitterly and long. The other was for 'Lady Knollys.' I did\nnot see how she received it, for I was already absorbed in mine. But in\nawhile she came and kissed me in her girlish, goodnatured way. Her eyes\nused to fill with tears at sight of my paroxysms of grief. Then she would\nbegin, 'I remember it was a saying of his,' and so she would repeat\nit--something maybe wise, maybe playful, at all events consolatory--and the\ncircumstances in which she had heard him say it, and then would follow the\nrecollections suggested by these; and so I was stolen away half by him, and\nhalf by Cousin Monica, from my despair and lamentation.\n\nAlong with these lay a large envelope, inscribed with the words 'Directions\nto be complied with immediately on my death.' One of which was, 'Let the\nevent be _forthwith_ published in the _county_ and principal _London_\npapers.' This step had been already taken. We found no record of Dr.\nBryerly's address.\n\nWe made search everywhere, except in the cabinet, which I would on no\naccount permit to be opened except, according to his direction, by Dr.\nBryerly's hand. But nowhere was a will, or any document resembling one, to\nbe found. I had now, therefore, no doubt that his will was placed in the\ncabinet.\n\nIn the search among my dear father's papers we found two sheafs of letters,\nneatly tied up and labelled--these were from my uncle Silas.\n\nMy cousin Monica looked down upon these papers with a strange smile; was it\nsatire--was it that indescribable smile with which a mystery which covers a\nlong reach of years is sometimes approached?\n\nThese were odd letters. If here and there occurred passages that were\nquerulous and even abject, there were also long passages of manly and\naltogether noble sentiment, and the strangest rodomontade and maunderings\nabout religion. Here and there a letter would gradually transform itself\ninto a prayer, and end with a doxology and no signature; and some of them\nexpressed such wild and disordered views respecting religion, as I imagine\nhe can never have disclosed to good Mr. Fairfield, and which approached\nmore nearly to the Swedenborg visions than to anything in the Church of\nEngland.\n\nI read these with a solemn interest, but my cousin Monica was not similarly\nmoved. She read them with the same smile--faint, serenely contemptuous,\nI thought--with which she had first looked down upon them. It was the\ncountenance of a person who amusedly traces the working of a character that\nis well understood.\n\n'Uncle Silas is very religious?' I said, not quite liking Lady Knollys'\nlooks.\n\n'Very,' she said, without raising her eyes or abating her old bitter smile,\nas she glanced over a passage in one of his letters.\n\n'You don't think he _is_, Cousin Monica?' said I. She raised her head and\nlooked straight at me.\n\n'Why do you say that, Maud?'\n\n'Because you smile incredulously, I think, over his letters.'\n\n'Do I?' said she; 'I was not thinking--it was quite an accident. The fact\nis, Maud, your poor papa quite mistook me. I had no prejudice respecting\nhim--no theory. I never knew what to think about him. I do not think\nSilas a product of nature, but a child of the Sphinx, and I never could\nunderstand him--that's all.'\n\n'I always felt so too; but that was because I was left to speculation, and\nto glean conjectures as I might from his portrait, or anywhere. Except what\nyou told me, I never heard more than a few sentences; poor papa did not\nlike me to ask questions about him, and I think he ordered the servants to\nbe silent.'\n\n'And much the same injunction this little note lays upon me--not quite, but\nsomething like it; and I don't know the meaning of it.'\n\nAnd she looked enquiringly at me.\n\n'You are not to be _alarmed_ about your uncle Silas, because your being\nafraid would unfit you for an _important service_ which you have undertaken\nfor your family, the nature of which I shall soon understand, and which,\nalthough it is quite _passive_, would be made very sad if _illusory fears_\nwere allowed to _steal into your mind_.'\n\nShe was looking into the letter in poor papa's handwriting, which she had\nfound addressed to her in his desk, and emphasised the words, I suppose,\nwhich she quoted from it.\n\n'Have you any idea, Maud, darling, what this _service_ may be?' she\nenquired, with a grave and anxious curiosity in her countenance.\n\n'None, Cousin Monica; but I have thought long over my undertaking to do\nit, or submit to it, be it what it may; and I will keep the promise I\nvoluntarily made, although I know what a coward I am, and often distrust my\ncourage.'\n\n'Well, I am not to frighten you.'\n\n'How could you? Why should I be afraid? _Is_ there anything frightful to be\ndisclosed? Do tell me--you _must_ tell me.'\n\n'No, darling, I did not mean _that_--I don't mean that;--I could, if I\nwould; I--I don't know exactly what I meant. But your poor papa knew him\nbetter than I--in fact, I did not know him at all--that is, ever quite\nunderstood him--which your poor papa, I see, had ample opportunities of\ndoing.' And after a little pause, she added--'So you do not know what you\nare expected to do or to undergo.'\n\n'Oh! Cousin Monica, I know you think he committed that murder,' I cried,\nstarting up, I don't know why, and I felt that I grew deadly pale.\n\n'I don't believe any such thing, you little fool; you must not say such\nhorrible things, Maud,' she said, rising also, and looking both pale and\nangry. 'Shall we go out for a little walk? Come, lock up these papers,\ndear, and get your things on; and if that Dr. Bryerly does not turn up\nto-morrow, you must send for the Rector, good Doctor Clay, and let him make\nsearch for the will--there may be directions about many things, you know;\nand, my dear Maud, you are to remember that Silas is _my_ cousin as well as\nyour uncle. Come, dear, put on your hat.'\n\nSo we went out together for a little cloistered walk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n_SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM WITH THE COFFIN_\n\n\nWhen we returned, a 'young' gentleman had arrived. We saw him in the\nparlour as we passed the window. It was simply a glance, but such a one\nas suffices to make a photograph, which we can study afterwards, at our\nleisure. I remember him at this moment--a man of six-and-thirty--dressed in\na grey travelling suit, not over-well made; light-haired, fat-faced,\nand clumsy; and he looked both dull and cunning, and not at all like a\ngentleman.\n\nBranston met us, announced the arrival, and handed me the stranger's\ncredentials. My cousin and I stopped in the passage to read them.\n\n'_That's_ your uncle Silas's,' said Lady Knollys, touching one of the two\nletters with the tip of her finger.\n\n'Shall we have lunch, Miss?'\n\n'Certainly.' So Branston departed.\n\n'Read it with me, Cousin Monica,' I said. And a very curious letter it was.\nIt spoke as follows:--\n\n'How can I thank my beloved niece for remembering her aged and forlorn\nkinsman at such a moment of anguish?'\n\nI had written a note of a few, I dare say, incoherent words by the next\npost after my dear father's death.\n\n'It is, however, in the hour of bereavement that we most value the ties\nthat are broken, and yearn for the sympathy of kindred.'\n\nHere came a little distich of French verse, of which I could only read\n_ciel_ and _l'amour_.\n\n'Our quiet household here is clouded with a new sorrow. How inscrutable are\nthe ways of Providence! I--though a few years younger--how much the more\ninfirm--how shattered in energy and in mind--how mere a burden--how\nentirely _de trop_--am spared to my sad place in a world where I can be no\nlonger useful, where I have but one business--prayer, but one hope--the\ntomb; and he--apparently so robust--the centre of so much good--so\nnecessary to you--so necessary, alas! to me--is taken! He is gone to his\nrest--for us, what remains but to bow our heads, and murmur, \"His will be\ndone\"? I trace these lines with a trembling hand, while tears dim my\nold eyes. I did not think that any earthly event could have moved me so\nprofoundly. From the world I have long stood aloof. I once led a life of\npleasure--alas! of wickedness--as I now do one of austerity; but as I never\nwas rich, so my worst enemy will allow I never was avaricious. My sins, I\nthank my Maker, have been of a more reducible kind, and have succumbed to\nthe discipline which Heaven has provided. To earth and its interests, as\nwell as to its pleasures, I have long been dead. For the few remaining\nyears of my life I ask but quiet--an exemption from the agitations and\ndistractions of struggle and care, and I trust to the Giver of all Good for\nmy deliverance--well knowing, at the same time, that whatever befalls will,\nunder His direction, prove best. Happy shall I be, my dearest niece, if in\nyour most interesting and, in some respects, forlorn situation, I can be\nof any use to you. My present religious adviser--of whom I ventured to ask\ncounsel on your behalf--states that I ought to send some one to represent\nme at the melancholy ceremony of reading the will which my beloved and now\nhappy brother has, no doubt, left behind; and the idea that the experience\nand professional knowledge possessed by the gentleman whom I have selected\nmay possibly be of use to you, my dearest niece, determines me to place\nhim at your disposal. He is the junior partner in the firm of Archer and\nSleigh, who conduct any little business which I may have from time to time;\nmay I entreat your hospitality for him during a brief stay at Knowl? I\nwrite, even for a moment, upon these small matters of business with\nan effort--a painful one, but necessary. Alas! my brother! The cup of\nbitterness is now full. Few and evil must the remainder of my old days be.\nYet, while they last, I remain always for my beloved niece, that which all\nher wealth and splendour cannot purchase--a loving and faithful kinsman and\nfriend,\n\nSILAS RUTHYN.'\n\n'Is not it a kind letter?' I said, while tears stood in my eyes.\n\n'Yes,' answered Lady Knollys, drily.\n\n'But don't you think it so, really?'\n\n'Oh! kind, very kind,' she answered in the same tone, 'and perhaps a little\ncunning.'\n\n'Cunning!--how?'\n\n'Well, you know I'm a peevish old Tabby, and of course I scratch now and\nthen, and see in the dark. I dare say Silas is sorry, but I don't think he\nis in sackcloth and ashes. He has reason to be sorry and anxious, and I say\nI think he is both; and you know he pities you very much, and also himself\na good deal; and he wants money, and you--his beloved niece--have a great\ndeal--and altogether it is an affectionate and prudent letter: and he has\nsent his attorney here to make a note of the will; and you are to give the\ngentleman his meals and lodging; and Silas, very thoughtfully, invites you\nto confide your difficulties and troubles to _his_ solicitor. It is very\nkind, but not imprudent.'\n\n'Oh, Cousin Monica, don't you think at such a moment it is hardly natural\nthat he should form such petty schemes, even were he capable at other times\nof practising so low? Is it not judging him hardly? and you, you know, so\nlittle acquainted with him.'\n\n'I told you, dear, I'm a cross old thing--and there's an end; and I really\ndon't care two pence about him; and of the two I'd much rather he were no\nrelation of ours.'\n\nNow, was not this prejudice? I dare say in part it was. So, too, was\nmy vehement predisposition in his favour. I am afraid we women are\nfactionists; we always take a side, and nature has formed us for advocates\nrather than judges; and I think the function, if less dignified, is more\namiable.\n\nI sat alone at the drawing-room window, at nightfall, awaiting my cousin\nMonica's entrance.\n\nFeverish and frightened I felt that night. It was a sympathy, I fancy, with\nthe weather. The sun had set stormily. Though the air was still, the sky\nlooked wild and storm-swept. The crowding clouds, slanting in the attitude\nof flight, reflected their own sacred aspect upon my spirits. My grief\ndarkened with a wild presaging of danger, and a sense of the supernatural\nfell upon me. It was the saddest and most awful evening that had come since\nmy beloved father's death.\n\nAll kinds of shapeless fears environed me in silence. For the first time,\ndire misgivings about the form of faith affrighted me. Who were these\nSwedenborgians who had got about him--no one could tell how--and held\nhim so fast to the close of his life? Who was this bilious, bewigged,\nblack-eyed Doctor Bryerly, whom none of us quite liked and all a little\nfeared; who seemed to rise out of the ground, and came and went, no one\nknew whence or whither, exercising, as I imagined, a mysterious authority\nover him? Was it all good and true, or a heresy and a witchcraft? Oh, my\nbeloved father! was it all well with you?\n\nWhen Lady Knollys entered, she found me in floods of tears, walking\ndistractedly up and down the room. She kissed me in silence; she walked\nback and forward with me, and did her best to console me.\n\n'I think, Cousin Monica, I would wish to see him once more. Shall we go\nup?'\n\n'Unless you really wish it very much, I think, darling, you had better not\nmind it. It is happier to recollect them as they were; there's a change,\nyou know, darling, and there is seldom any comfort in the sight.'\n\n'But I do wish it _very_ much. Oh! won't you come with me?'\n\nAnd so I persuaded her, and up we went hand in hand, in the deepening\ntwilight; and we halted at the end of the dark gallery, and I called Mrs.\nRusk, growing frightened.\n\n'Tell her to let us in, Cousin Monica,' I whispered.\n\n'She wishes to see him, my lady--does she?' enquired Mrs. Rusk, in an\nunder-tone, and with a mysterious glance at me, as she softly fitted the\nkey to the lock.\n\n'Are you quite sure, Maud, dear?'\n\n'Yes, yes.'\n\nBut when Mrs. Rusk entered bearing the candle, whose beam mixed dismally\nwith the expiring twilight, disclosing a great black coffin standing upon\ntrestles, near the foot of which she took her stand, gazing sternly into\nit, I lost heart again altogether and drew back.\n\n'No, Mrs. Rusk, she won't; and I am very glad, dear,' she added to me.\n'Come, Mrs. Rusk, come away. Yes, darling,' she continued to me, 'it is\nmuch better for you;' and she hurried me away, and down-stairs again. But\nthe awful outlines of that large black coffin remained upon my imagination\nwith a new and terrible sense of death.\n\nI had no more any wish to see him. I felt a horror even of the room, and\nfor more than an hour after a kind of despair and terror, such as I have\nnever experienced before or since at the idea of death.\n\nCousin Monica had had her bed placed in my room, and Mary Quince's moved to\nthe dressing-room adjoining it. For the first time the superstitious awe\nthat follows death, but not immediately, visited me. The idea of seeing my\nfather enter the room, or open the door and look in, haunted me. After Lady\nKnollys and I were in bed, I could not sleep. The wind sounded mournfully\noutside, and the small sounds, the rattlings, and strainings that responded\nfrom within, constantly startled me, and simulated the sounds of steps, of\ndoors opening, of knockings, and so forth, rousing me with a palpitating\nheart as often as I fell into a doze.\n\nAt length the wind subsided, and these ambiguous noises abated, and I,\nfatigued, dropped into a quiet sleep. I was awakened by a sound in the\ngallery--which I could not define. A considerable time had passed, for the\nwind was now quite lulled. I sat up in my bed a good deal scared, listening\nbreathlessly for I knew not what.\n\nI heard a step moving stealthily along the gallery. I called my cousin\nMonica softly; and we both heard the door of the room in which my father's\nbody lay unlocked, some one furtively enter, and the door shut.\n\n'What can it be? Good Heavens, Cousin Monica, do you hear it?'\n\n'Yes, dear; and it is two o'clock.'\n\nEveryone at Knowl was in bed at eleven. We knew very well that Mrs. Rusk\nwas rather nervous, and would not, for worlds, go alone, and at such an\nhour, to the room. We called Mary Quince. We all three listened, but we\nheard no other sound. I set these things down here because they made so\nterrible an impression upon me at the time.\n\nIt ended by our peeping out, all three in a body, upon the gallery. Through\neach window in the perspective came its blue sheet of moonshine; but the\ndoor on which our attention was fixed was in the shade, and we thought we\ncould discern the glare of a candle through the key-hole. While in whispers\nwe were debating this point together, the door opened, the dusky light of\na candle emerged, the shadow of a figure crossed it within, and in another\nmoment the mysterious Doctor Bryerly--angular, ungainly, in the black cloth\ncoat that fitted little better than a coffin--issued from the chamber,\ncandle in hand; murmuring, I suppose, a prayer--it sounded like a\nfarewell--as much frightened as if I had just seen a sorcerer stealing\nstepped cautiously upon the gallery floor, shutting and locking the door\nupon the dead; and then having listened for a second, the saturnine figure,\ncasting a gigantic and distorted shadow upon the ceiling and side-wall from\nthe lowered candle, strode lightly down the long dark passage, away from\nus.\n\nI can only speak for myself, and I can honestly say that I felt as much\nfrightened as if I had just seen a sorcerer stealing from his unhallowed\nbusiness. I think Cousin Monica was also affected in the same way, for she\nturned the key on the inside of the door when we entered. I do not think\none of us believed at the moment that what we had seen was a Doctor Bryerly\nof flesh and blood, and yet the first thing we spoke of in the morning was\nDoctor Bryerly's arrival. The mind is a different organ by night and by\nday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n_I TALK WITH DOCTOR BRYERLY_\n\n\nDoctor Bryerly had, indeed, arrived at half-past twelve o'clock at night.\nHis summons at the hall-door was little heard at our remote side of the old\nhouse of Knowl; and when the sleepy, half-dressed servant opened the\ndoor, the lank Doctor, in glossy black clothing, was standing alone, his\nportmanteau on its end upon the steps, and his vehicle disappearing in the\nshadows of the old trees.\n\nIn he came, sterner and sharper of aspect than usual.\n\n'I've been expected? I'm Doctor Bryerly. Haven't I? So, let whoever is in\ncharge of the body be called. I must visit it forthwith.'\n\nSo the Doctor sat in the back drawing-room, with a solitary candle; and\nMrs. Rusk was called up, and, grumbling much and very peevish, dressed and\nwent down, her ill-temper subsiding in a sort of fear as she approached the\nvisitor.\n\n'How do you do, Madam? A sad visit this. Is anyone watching in the room\nwhere the remains of your late master are laid?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'So much the better; it is a foolish custom. Will you please conduct me to\nthe room? I must pray where he lies--no longer _he_! And be good enough to\nshow me my bedroom, and so no one need wait up, and I shall find my way.'\n\nAccompanied by the man who carried his valise, Mrs. Rusk showed him to his\napartment; but he only looked in, and then glanced rapidly about to take\n'the bearings' of the door.\n\n'Thank you--yes. Now we'll proceed, here, along here? Let me see. A turn to\nthe right and another to the left--yes. He has been dead some days. Is he\nyet in his coffin?'\n\n'Yes, sir; since yesterday afternoon.'\n\nMrs. Rusk was growing more and more afraid of this lean figure sheathed in\nshining black cloth, whose eyes glittered with a horrible sort of cunning,\nand whose long brown fingers groped before him, as if indicating the way by\nguess.\n\n'But, of course, the lid's not on; you've not screwed him down, hey?'\n\n'No, sir.'\n\n'That's well. I must look on the face as I pray. He is in his place; I here\non earth. He in the spirit; I in the flesh. The neutral ground lies there.\nSo are carried the vibrations, and so the light of earth and heaven\nreflected back and forward--apaugasma, a wonderful though helpless engine,\nthe ladder of Jacob, and behold the angels of God ascending and descending\non it. Thanks, I'll take the key. Mysteries to those who _will_ live\naltogether in houses of clay, no mystery to such as will use their eyes and\nread what is revealed. _This_ candle, it is the longer, please; no--no need\nof a pair, thanks; just this, to hold in my hand. And remember, all depends\nupon the willing mind. Why do you look frightened? Where is your faith?\nDon't you know that spirits are about us at all times? Why should you\nfear to be near the body? The spirit is everything; the flesh profiteth\nnothing.'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said Mrs. Rusk, making him a great courtesy in the threshold.\n\nShe was frightened by his eerie talk, which grew, she fancied, more voluble\nand energetic as they approached the corpse.\n\n'Remember, then, that when you fancy yourself alone and wrapt in darkness,\nyou stand, in fact, in the centre of a theatre, as wide as the starry floor\nof heaven, with an audience, whom no man can number, beholding you under a\nflood of light. Therefore, though your body be in solitude and your mortal\nsense in darkness, remember to walk as being in the light, surrounded with\na cloud of witnesses. Thus walk; and when the hour comes, and you pass\nforth unprisoned from the tabernacle of the flesh, although it still has\nits relations and its rights'--and saying this, as he held the solitary\ncandle aloft in the doorway, he nodded towards the coffin, whose large\nblack form was faintly traceable against the shadows beyond--'you will\nrejoice; and being clothed upon with your house from on high, you will not\nbe found naked. On the other hand, he that loveth corruption shall have\nenough thereof. Think upon these things. Good-night.'\n\nAnd the Swedenborgian Doctor stepped into the room, taking the candle with\nhim, and closed the door upon the shadowy still-life there, and on his own\nsharp and swarthy visage, leaving Mrs. Rusk in a sort of panic in the dark\nalone, to find her way to her room the best way she could.\n\nEarly in the morning Mrs. Rusk came to my room to tell me that Doctor\nBryerly was in the parlour, and begged to know whether I had not a message\nfor him. I was already dressed, so, though it was dreadful seeing a\nstranger in my then mood, taking the key of the cabinet in my hand, I\nfollowed Mrs. Rusk downstairs.\n\nOpening the parlour door, she stepped in, and with a little courtesy\nsaid,--\n\n'Please, sir, the young mistress--Miss Ruthyn.'\n\nDraped in black and very pale, tall and slight, 'the young mistress'\nwas; and as I entered I heard a newspaper rustle, and the sound of steps\napproaching to meet me.\n\nFace to face we met, near the door; and, without speaking, I made him a\ndeep courtesy.\n\nHe took my hand, without the least indication on my part, in his hard lean\ngrasp, and shook it kindly, but familiarly, peering with a stern sort of\ncuriosity into my face as he continued to hold it. His ill-fitting, glossy\nblack cloth, ungainly presence, and sharp, dark, vulpine features had in\nthem, as I said before, the vulgarity of a Glasgow artisan in his Sabbath\nsuit. I made an instantaneous motion to withdraw my hand, but he held it\nfirmly.\n\nThough there was a grim sort of familiarity, there was also decision,\nshrewdness, and, above all, kindness, in his dark face--a gleam on the\nwhole of the masterly and the honest--that along with a certain paleness,\nbetraying, I thought, restrained emotion, indicated sympathy and invited\nconfidence.\n\n'I hope, Miss, you are pretty well?' He pronounced 'pretty' as it is spelt.\n'I have come in consequence of a solemn promise exacted more than a year\nsince by your deceased father, the late Mr. Austin Ruthyn of Knowl, for\nwhom I cherished a warm esteem, being knit besides with him in spiritual\nbonds. It has been a shock to you, Miss?'\n\n'It has, indeed, sir.'\n\n'I've a doctor's degree, I have--Doctor of Medicine, Miss. Like St. Luke,\npreacher and doctor. I was in business once, but this is better. As one\nfooting fails, the Lord provides another. The stream of life is black and\nangry; how so many of us get across without drowning, I often wonder. The\nbest way is not to look too far before--just from one stepping-stone to\nanother; and though you may wet your feet, He won't let you drown--He has\nnot allowed me.'\n\nAnd Doctor Bryerly held up his head, and wagged it resolutely.\n\n'You are born to this world's wealth; in its way a great blessing, though a\ngreat trial, Miss, and a great trust; but don't suppose you are destined\nto exemption from trouble on that account, any more than poor Emmanuel\nBryerly. As the sparks fly upwards, Miss Ruthyn! Your cushioned carriage\nmay overturn on the highroad, as I may stumble and fall upon the footpath.\nThere are other troubles than debt and privation. Who can tell how\nlong health may last, or when an accident may happen the brain; what\nmortifications may await you in your own high sphere; what unknown enemies\nmay rise up in your path; or what slanders may asperse your name--ha, ha!\nIt is a wonderful equilibrium--a marvellous dispensation--ha, ha!' and he\nlaughed with a shake of his head, I thought a little sarcastically, as if\nhe was not sorry my money could not avail to buy immunity from the general\ncurse.\n\n'But what money can't do, _prayer_ can--bear that in mind, Miss Ruthyn. We\ncan all pray; and though thorns and snares, and stones of fire lie strewn\nin our way, we need not fear them. He will give His angels charge over us,\nand in their hands they will bear us up, for He hears and sees everywhere,\nand His angels are innumerable.'\n\nHe was now speaking gently and solemnly, and paused. But another vein of\nthought he had unconsciously opened in my mind, and I said--\n\n'And had my dear papa no other medical adviser?'\n\nHe looked at me sharply, and flushed a little under his dark tint. His\nmedical skill was, perhaps, the point on which his human vanity vaunted\nitself, and I dare say there was something very disparaging in my tone.\n\n'And if he _had_ no other, he might have done worse. I've had many critical\ncases in my hands, Miss Ruthyn. I can't charge myself with any miscarriage\nthrough ignorance. My diagnosis in Mr. Ruthyn's case has been verified by\nthe result. But I was _not_ alone; Sir Clayton Barrow saw him, and took my\nview; a note will reach him in London. But this, excuse me, is not to the\npresent purpose. The late Mr. Ruthyn told me I was to receive a key\nfrom you, which would open a cabinet where he had placed his will--ha!\nthanks,--in his study. And, I think, as there may be directions about\nthe funeral, it had better be read forthwith. Is there any gentleman--a\nrelative or man of business--near here, whom you would wish sent for?'\n\n'No, none, thank you; I have confidence in you, sir.'\n\nI think I spoke and looked frankly, for he smiled very kindly, though with\nclosed lips.\n\n'And you may be sure, Miss Ruthyn, your confidence shall not be\ndisappointed.' Here was a long pause. 'But you are very young, and you must\nhave some one by in your interest, who has some experience in business. Let\nme see. Is not the Rector, Dr. Clay, at hand? In the town?--very good; and\nMr. Danvers, who manages the estate, _he_ must come. And get Grimston--you\nsee I know all the names--Grimston, the attorney; for though he was not\nemployed about this will, he has been Mr. Ruthyn's solicitor a great many\nyears: we must have Grimston; for, as I suppose you know, though it is a\nshort will, it is a very strange one. I expostulated, but you know he was\nvery decided when he took a view. He read it to you, eh?'\n\n'No, sir.'\n\n'Oh, but he told you so much as relates to you and your uncle, Mr. Silas\nRuthyn, of Bartram-Haugh?'\n\n'No, indeed, sir.'\n\n'Ha! I wish he had.'\n\nAnd with these words Doctor Bryerly's countenance darkened.\n\n'Mr. Silas Ruthyn is a religious man?'\n\n'Oh, _very_!' said I.\n\n'You've seen a good deal of him?'\n\n'No, I never saw him,' I answered.\n\n'H'm? Odder and odder! But he's a good man, isn't he?'\n\n'Very good, indeed, sir--a very religious man.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly was watching my countenance as I spoke, with a sharp and\nanxious eye; and then he looked down, and read the pattern of the carpet\nlike bad news, for a while, and looking again in my face, askance, he\nsaid--\n\n'He was very near joining _us_--on the point. He got into correspondence\nwith Henry Voerst, one of our best men. They call us Swedenborgians, you\nknow; but I dare say that won't go much further, now. I suppose, Miss\nRuthyn, one o'clock would be a good hour, and I am sure, under the\ncircumstances, the gentlemen will make a point of attending.'\n\n'Yes, Dr. Bryerly, the notes shall be sent, and my cousin, Lady Knollys,\nwould I am sure attend with me while the will is being read--there would be\nno objection to her presence?'\n\n'None in the world. I can't be quite sure who are joined with me as\nexecutors. I'm almost sorry I did not decline; but it is too late\nregretting. One thing you must believe Miss Ruthyn: in framing the\nprovisions of the will I was never consulted--although I expostulated\nagainst the only very unusual one it contains when I heard it. I did\nso strenuously, but in vain. There was one other against which I\nprotested--having a right to do so--with better effect. In no other way\ndoes the will in any respect owe anything to my advice or dissuasion. You\nwill please believe this; also that I am your friend. Yes, indeed, it is my\nduty.'\n\nThe latter words he spoke looking down again, as it were in soliloquy; and\nthanking him, I withdrew.\n\nWhen I reached the hall, I regretted that I had not asked him to state\ndistinctly what arrangements the will made so nearly affecting, as it\nseemed, my relations with my uncle Silas, and for a moment I thought of\nreturning and requesting an explanation. But then, I bethought me, it was\nnot very long to wait till one o'clock--so _he_, at least, would think. I\nwent up-stairs, therefore, to the 'school-room,' which we used at present\nas a sitting-room, and there I found Cousin Monica awaiting me.\n\n'Are you quite well, dear?' asked Lady Knollys, as she came to meet and\nkiss me.\n\n'Quite well, Cousin Monica.'\n\n'No nonsense, Maud! you're as white as that handkerchief--what's the\nmatter? Are you ill--are you frightened? Yes, you're trembling--you're\nterrified, child.'\n\n'I believe I _am_ afraid. There _is_ something in poor papa's will about\nUncle Silas--about _me_. I don't know--Doctor Bryerly says, and he seems so\nuncomfortable and frightened himself, I am sure it is something very bad. I\nam _very_ much frightened--I am--I _am_. Oh, Cousin Monica! you won't leave\nme?'\n\nSo I threw my arms about her neck, clasping her very close, and we kissed\none another, I crying like a frightened child--and indeed in experience of\nthe world I was no more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n_THE OPENING OF THE WILL_\n\n\nPerhaps the terror with which I anticipated the hour of one, and the\ndisclosure of the unknown undertaking to which I had bound myself, was\nirrational and morbid. But, honestly, I doubt it; my tendency has always\nbeen that of many other weak characters, to act impetuously, and afterwards\nto reproach myself for consequences which I have, perhaps, in reality, had\nlittle or no share in producing.\n\nIt was Doctor Bryerly's countenance and manner in alluding to a particular\nprovision in my father's will that instinctively awed me. I have seen faces\nin a nightmare that haunted me with an indescribable horror, and yet I\ncould not say wherein lay the fascination. And so it was with his--an omen,\na menace, lurked in its sallow and dismal glance.\n\n'You must not be so frightened, darling,' said Cousin Monica. 'It is\nfoolish; it _is, really_; they can't cut off your head, you know: they\ncan't really harm you in any essential way. If it involved a risk of a\nlittle money, you would not mind it; but men are such odd creatures--they\nmeasure all sacrifices by money. Doctor Bryerly would look just as you\ndescribe, if you were doomed to lose 500_l_., and yet it would not kill\nyou.'\n\nA companion like Lady Knollys is reassuring; but I could not take her\ncomfort altogether to heart, for I felt that she had no great confidence in\nit herself.\n\nThere was a little French clock over the mantelpiece in the school-room,\nwhich I consulted nearly every minute. It wanted now but ten minutes of\none.\n\n'Shall we go down to the drawing-room, dear?' said Cousin Knollys, who was\ngrowing restless like me.\n\nSo down-stairs we went, pausing by mutual consent at the great window at\nthe stair-head, which looks out on the avenue. Mr. Danvers was riding his\ntall, grey horse at a walk, under the wide branches toward the house, and\nwe waited to see him get off at the door. In his turn he loitered there,\nfor the good Rector's gig, driven by the Curate, was approaching at a smart\necclesiastical trot.\n\nDoctor Clay got down, and shook hands with Mr. Danvers; and after a word\nor two, away drove the Curate with that upward glance at the windows from\nwhich so few can refrain.\n\nI watched the Rector and Mr. Danvers loitering on the steps as a patient\nmight the gathering of surgeons who are to perform some unknown operation.\nThey, too, glanced up at the window as they turned to enter the house, and\nI drew back. Cousin Monica looked at her watch.\n\n'Four minutes only. Shall we go to the drawing-room?'\n\nWaiting for a moment to let the gentlemen get by on the way to the study,\nwe, accordingly, went down, and I heard the Rector talk of the dangerous\nstate of Grindleston bridge, and wondered how he could think of such things\nat a time of sorrow. Everything about those few minutes of suspense remains\nfresh in my recollection. I remember how they loitered and came to a halt\nat the corner of the oak passage leading to the study, and how the Rector\npatted the marble head and smoothed the inflexible tresses of William Pitt,\nas he listened to Mr. Danvers' details about the presentment; and then,\nas they went on, I recollect the boisterous nose-blowing that suddenly\nresounded from the passage, and which I then referred, and still refer,\nintuitively to the Rector.\n\nWe had not been five minutes in the drawing-room when Branston entered, to\nsay that the gentlemen I had mentioned were all assembled in the study.\n\n'Come, dear,' said Cousin Monica; and leaning on her arm I reached the\nstudy door. I entered, followed by her. The gentlemen arrested their talk\nand stood up, those who were sitting, and the Rector came forward very\ngravely, and in low tones, and very kindly, greeted me. There was nothing\nemotional in this salutation, for though my father never quarrelled, yet an\nimmense distance separated him from all his neighbours, and I do not think\nthere lived a human being who knew him at more than perhaps a point or two\nof his character.\n\nConsidering how entirely he secluded himself, my father was, as many people\nliving remember, wonderfully popular in his county. He was neighbourly\nin everything except in seeing company and mixing in society. He had\nmagnificent shooting, of which he was extremely liberal. He kept a pack of\nhounds at Dollerton, with which all his side of the county hunted through\nthe season. He never refused any claim upon his purse which had the\nslightest show of reason. He subscribed to every fund, social, charitable,\nsporting, agricultural, no matter what, provided the honest people of\nhis county took an interest in it, and always with a princely hand; and\nalthough he shut himself up, no one could say that he was inaccessible,\nfor he devoted hours daily to answering letters, and his checque-book\ncontributed largely in those replies. He had taken his turn long ago as\nHigh Sheriff; so there was an end of that claim before his oddity and\nshyness had quite secluded him. He refused the Lord-Lieutenancy of his\ncounty; he declined every post of personal distinction connected with it.\nHe could write an able as well as a genial letter when he pleased; and his\nappearances at public meetings, dinners, and so forth were made in\nthis epistolary fashion, and, when occasion presented, by magnificent\ncontributions from his purse.\n\nIf my father had been less goodnatured in the sporting relations of his\nvast estates, or less magnificent in dealing with his fortune, or even if\nhe had failed to exhibit the intellectual force which always characterised\nhis letters on public matters, I dare say that his oddities would have\ncondemned him to ridicule, and possibly to dislike. But every one of the\nprincipal gentlemen of his county, whose judgment was valuable, has told me\nthat he was a remarkably able man, and that his failure in public life\nwas due to his eccentricities, and in no respect to deficiency in those\npeculiar mental qualities which make men feared and useful in Parliament.\n\nI could not forbear placing on record this testimony to the high mental\nand the kindly qualities of my beloved father, who might have passed for\na misanthrope or a fool. He was a man of generous nature and powerful\nintellect, but given up to the oddities of a shyness which grew with\nyears and indulgence, and became inflexible with his disappointments and\naffliction.\n\nThere was something even in the Rector's kind and ceremonious greeting\nwhich oddly enough reflected the mixed feelings in which awe was not\nwithout a place, with which his neighbours had regarded my dear father.\n\nHaving done the honours--I am sure looking woefully pale--I had time to\nglance quietly at the only figure there with which I was not tolerably\nfamiliar. This was the junior partner in the firm of Archer and Sleigh who\nrepresented my uncle Silas--a fat and pallid man of six-and-thirty, with\na sly and evil countenance, and it has always seemed to me, that ill\ndispositions show more repulsively in a pale fat face than in any other.\n\nDoctor Bryerly, standing near the window, was talking in a low tone to Mr.\nGrimston, our attorney.\n\nI heard good Dr. Clay whisper to Mr. Danvers--\n\n'Is not that Doctor Bryerly--the person with the black--the black--it's a\nwig, I think--in the window, talking to Abel Grimston?'\n\n'Yes; that's he.'\n\n'Odd-looking person--one of the Swedenborg people, is not he?' continued\nthe Rector.\n\n'So I am told.'\n\n'Yes,' said the Rector, quietly; and he crossed one gaitered leg over the\nother, and, with fingers interlaced, twiddled his thumbs, as he eyed\nthe monstrous sectary under his orthodox old brows with a stern\ninquisitiveness. I thought he was meditating theologic battle.\n\nBut Dr. Bryerly and Mr. Grimston, still talking together, began to walk\nslowly from the window, and the former said in his peculiar grim tones--\n\n'I beg pardon, Miss Ruthyn; perhaps you would be so good as to show us\nwhich of the cabinets in this room your late lamented father pointed out as\nthat to which this key belongs.'\n\nI indicated the oak cabinet.\n\n'Very good, ma'am--very good,' said Doctor Bryerly, as he fumbled the key\ninto the lock.\n\nCousin Monica could not forbear murmuring--\n\n'Dear! what a brute!'\n\nThe junior partner, with his dumpy hands in his pocket, poked his fat face\nover Mr. Grimston's shoulder, and peered into the cabinet as the door\nopened.\n\nThe search was not long. A handsome white paper enclosure, neatly tied up\nin pink tape, and sealed with large red seals, was inscribed in my dear\nfather's hand:--'Will of Austin R. Ruthyn, of Knowl.' Then, in smaller\ncharacters, the date, and in the corner a note--'This will was drawn from\nmy instructions by Gaunt, Hogg, and Hatchett, Solicitors, Great Woburn\nStreet, London, A.R.R.'\n\n'Let _me_ have a squint at that indorsement, please, gentlemen,' half\nwhispered the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas.\n\n''_Tisn't_ an indorsement. There, look--a memorandum on an envelope,' said\nAbel Grimston, gruffly.\n\n'Thanks--all right--that will do,' he responded, himself making a\npencil-note of it, in a long clasp-book which he drew from his coat-pocket.\n\nThe tape was carefully cut, and the envelope removed without tearing the\nwriting, and forth came the will, at sight of which my heart swelled and\nfluttered up to my lips, and then dropped down dead as it seemed into its\nplace.\n\n'Mr. Grimston, you will please to read it,' said Doctor Bryerly, who took\nthe direction of the process. 'I will sit beside you, and as we go along\nyou will be good enough to help us to understand technicalities, and give\nus a lift where we want it.' 'It's a short will,' said Mr. Grimston,\nturning over the sheets '_very_--considering. Here's a codicil.'\n\n'I did not see that,' said Doctor Bryerly.\n\n'Dated only a month ago.'\n\n'Oh!' said Doctor Bryerly, putting on his spectacles. Uncle Silas's\nambassador, sitting close behind, had insinuated his face between Doctor\nBryerly's and the reader's of the will.\n\n'On behalf of the surviving brother of the testator,' interposed the\ndelegate, just as Abel Grimston had cleared his voice to begin, 'I take\nleave to apply for a copy of this instrument. It will save a deal of\ntrouble, if the young lady as represents the testator here has no\nobjection.'\n\n'You can have as many copies as you like when the will is proved,' said Mr.\nGrimston.\n\n'I know that; but supposing as all's right, where's the objection?'\n\n'Just the objection there always is to acting irregular,' replied Mr.\nGrimston.\n\n'You don't object to act disobliging, it seems.'\n\n'You can do as I told you,' replied Mr. Grimston.\n\n'Thank you for nothing,' murmured Mr. Sleigh.\n\nAnd the reading of the will proceeded, while he made elaborate notes of its\ncontents in his capacious pocket-book.\n\n'I, Austin Alymer Ruthyn Ruthyn, being, I thank God, of sound mind and\nperfect recollection,' &c, &c.; and then came a bequest of all his\nestates real, chattels real, copyrights, leases, chattels, money, rights,\ninterests, reversions, powers, plate, pictures, and estates and possessions\nwhatsoever, to four persons--Lord Ilbury, Mr. Penrose Creswell of Creswell,\nSir William Aylmer, Bart., and Hans Emmanuel Bryerly, Doctor of Medicine,\n'to have and to hold,' &c. &c. Whereupon my Cousin Monica ejaculated 'Eh?'\nand Doctor Bryerly interposed--\n\n'Four trustees, ma'am. We take little but trouble--you'll see; go on.'\n\nThen it came out that all this multifarious splendour was bequeathed in\ntrust for me, subject to a bequest of 15,000_l_. to his only brother, Silas\nAylmer Ruthyn, and 3,500_l_. each to the two children of his said brother;\nand lest any doubt should arise by reason of his, the testator's decease\nas to the continuance of the arrangement by way of lease under which\nhe enjoyed his present habitation and farm, he left him the use of the\nmansion-house and lands of Bartram-Haugh, in the county of Derbyshire, and\nof the lands of so-and-so and so-and-so, adjoining thereto, in the said\ncounty, for the term of his natural life, on payment of a rent of 5_s_.\nper annum, and subject to the like conditions as to waste, &c., as are\nexpressed in the said lease.\n\n'By your leave, may I ask is them dispositions all the devises to my\nclient, which is his only brother, as it seems to me you've seen the will\nbefore?' enquired Mr. Sleigh.\n\n'Nothing more, unless there is something in the codicil,' answered Dr.\nBryerly.\n\nBut there was no mention of him in the codicil.\n\nMr. Sleigh threw himself back in his chair, and sneered, with the end of\nhis pencil between his teeth. I hope his disappointment was altogether for\nhis client. Mr. Danvers fancied, he afterwards said, that he had probably\nexpected legacies which might have involved litigation, or, at all events,\nlaw costs, and perhaps a stewardship; but this was very barren; and Mr.\nDanvers also remarked, that the man was a very low practitioner, and\nwondered how my uncle Silas could have commissioned such a person to\nrepresent him.\n\nSo far the will contained nothing of which my most partial friend could\nhave complained. The codicil, too, devised only legacies to servants, and\na sum of 1,000_l_., with a few kind words, to Monica, Lady Knollys, and\na further sum of 3,000_l_. to Dr. Bryerly, stating that the legatee had\nprevailed upon him to erase from the draft of his will a bequest to him to\nthat amount, but that, in consideration of all the trouble devolving\nupon him as trustee, he made that bequest by his codicil; and with these\narrangements the permanent disposition of his property was completed.\n\nBut that direction to which he and Doctor Bryerly had darkly alluded, was\nnow to come, and certainly it was a strange one. It appointed my uncle\nSilas my sole guardian, with full parental authority over me until I should\nhave reached the age of twenty-one, up to which time I was to reside under\nhis care at Bartram-Haugh, and it directed the trustees to pay over to him\nyearly a sum of 2,000_l_. during the continuance of the guardianship for my\nsuitable maintenance, education, and expenses.\n\nYou have now a sufficient outline of my father's will. The only thing I\npainfully felt in this arrangement was, the break-up--the dismay that\naccompanies the disappearance of home. Otherwise, there was something\nrather pleasurable in the idea. As long as I could remember, I had always\ncherished the same mysterious curiosity about my uncle, and the same\nlonging to behold him. This was about to be gratified. Then there was my\ncousin Milicent, about my own age. My life had been so lonely, that I\nhad acquired none of those artificial habits that induce the fine-lady\nnature--a second, and not always a very amiable one. She had lived a\nsolitary life, like me. What rambles and readings we should have together!\nwhat confidences and castle-buildings! and then there was a new country\nand a fine old place, and the sense of interest and adventure that always\naccompanies change in our early youth.\n\nThere were four letters all alike with large, red seals, addressed\nrespectively to each of the trustees named in the will. There was also one\naddressed to Silas Alymer Ruthyn, Esq., Bartram-Haugh Manor, &c. &c., which\nMr. Sleigh offered to deliver. But Doctor Bryerly thought the post-office\nwas the more regular channel. Uncle Silas's representative was questioning\nDoctor Bryerly in an under-tone.\n\nI turned my eyes on my cousin Monica--I felt so inexpressibly\nrelieved--expecting to see a corresponding expression in her countenance.\nBut I was startled. She looked ghastly and angry. I stared in her face, not\nknowing what to think. Could the will have personally disappointed her?\nSuch doubts, though we fancy in after-life they belong to maturity and\nexperience only, do sometimes cross our minds in youth. But the suggestion\nwronged Lady Knollys, who neither expected nor wanted anything, being rich,\nchildless, generous, and frank. It was the unexpected character of\nher countenance that scared me, and for a moment the shock called up\ncorresponding moral images.\n\nLady Knollys, starting up, raised her head, so as to see over Mr. Sleigh's\nshoulder, and biting her pale lip, she cleared her voice and demanded--\n\n'Doctor Bryerly, pray, sir, is the reading concluded?'\n\n'Concluded? Quite. Yes, nothing more,' he answered with a nod, and\ncontinued his talk with Mr. Danvers and Abel Grimston.\n\n'And to whom,' said Lady Knollys, with an effort, 'will the property\nbelong, in case--in case my little cousin here should die before she comes\nof age?'\n\n'Eh? Well--wouldn't it go to the heir-at-law and next of kin?' said Doctor\nBryerly, turning to Abel Grimston.\n\n'Ay--to be sure,' said the attorney, thoughtfully.\n\n'And who is that?' pursued my cousin.\n\n'Well, her uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn. He's both heir-at-law and next of kin,'\npursued Abel Grimston.\n\n'Thank you,' said Lady Knollys.\n\nDoctor Clay came forward, bowing very low, in his standing collar and\nsingle-breasted coat, and graciously folded my hand in his soft wrinkled\ngrasp--\n\n'Allow me, my dear Miss Ruthyn, while expressing my regret that we are to\nlose you from among our little flock--though I trust but for a short,\na very short time--to say how I rejoice at the particular arrangement\nindicated by the will we have just heard read. My curate, William\nFairfield, resided for some years in the same spiritual capacity in the\nneighbourhood of your, I will say, admirable uncle, with occasional\nintercourse with whom he was favoured--may I not say blessed?--a true\nChristian Churchman--a Christian gentleman. Can I say more? A most happy,\nhappy choice.' A very low bow here, with eyes nearly closed, and a shake of\nthe head. 'Mrs. Clay will do herself the honour of waiting upon you, to pay\nher respects, before you leave Knowl for your temporary sojourn in another\nsphere.'\n\nSo, with another deep bow--for I had become a great personage all at\nonce--he let go my hand cautiously and delicately, as if he were setting\ndown a curious china tea-cup. And I courtesied low to him, not knowing\nwhat to say, and then to the assembly generally, who all bowed. And Cousin\nMonica whispered, briskly, 'Come away,' and took my hand with a very cold\nand rather damp one, and led me from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n_I HEAR FROM UNCLE SILAS_\n\n\nWithout saying a word, Cousin Monica accompanied me to the school-room, and\non entering she shut the door, not with a spirited clang, but quietly and\ndeterminedly.\n\n'Well, dear,' she said, with the same pale, excited countenance, 'that\ncertainly is a sensible and charitable arrangement. I could not have\nbelieved it possible, had I not heard it with my ears.'\n\n'About my going to Bartram-Haugh?'\n\n'Yes, exactly so, under Silas Ruthyn's guardianship, to spend\ntwo--_three_--of the most important years of your education and your life\nunder that roof. Is _that_, my dear, what was in your mind when you were so\nalarmed about what you were to be called upon to do, or undergo?'\n\n'No, no, indeed. I had no notion what it might be. I was afraid of\nsomething serious,' I answered.\n\n'And, my dear Maud, did not your poor father speak to you as if it _was_\nsomething serious?' said she. 'And so it _is_, I can tell you, something\nserious, and _very_ serious; and I think it ought to be prevented, and I\ncertainly _will_ prevent it if I possibly can.'\n\nI was puzzled utterly by the intensity of Lady Knollys' protest. I looked\nat her, expecting an explanation of her meaning; but she was silent,\nlooking steadfastly on the jewels on her right-hand fingers, with which she\nwas drumming a staccato march on the table, very pale, with gleaming eyes,\nevidently thinking deeply. I began to think she _had_ a prejudice against\nmy uncle Silas.\n\n'He is not very rich,' I commenced.\n\n'Who?' said Lady Knollys.\n\n'Uncle Silas,' I replied.\n\n'No, certainly; he's in debt,' she answered. 'But then, how very highly\nDoctor Clay spoke of him!' I pursued.\n\n'Don't talk of Doctor Clay. I do think that man is the greatest goose I\never heard talk. I have no patience with such men,' she replied.\n\nI tried to remember what particular nonsense Doctor Clay had uttered, and I\ncould recollect nothing, unless his eulogy upon my uncle were to be classed\nwith that sort of declamation.\n\n'Danvers is a very proper man and a good accountant, I dare say; but he\nis either a very deep person, or a fool--_I_ believe a fool. As for your\nattorney, I suppose he knows his business, and also his interest, and I\nhave no doubt he will consult it. I begin to think he best man among them,\nthe shrewdest and the most reliable, is that vulgar visionary in the black\nwig. I saw him look at you, Maud, and I liked his face, though it is\nabominably ugly and vulgar, and cunning, too; but I think he's a just man,\nand I dare say with right feelings--I'm _sure_ he has.'\n\nI was quite at a loss to divine the gist of my cousin's criticism.\n\n'I'll have some talk with Dr. Bryerly; I feel convinced he takes my view,\nand we must really think what had best be done.'\n\n'Is there anything in the will, Cousin Monica, that does not appear?' I\nasked, for I was growing very uneasy. 'I wish you would tell me. What view\ndo you mean?'\n\n'No view in particular; the view that a desolate old park, and the house of\na _neglected_ old man, who is very poor, and has been desperately foolish,\nis not the right place for you, particularly at your years. It is quite\nshocking, and I _will_ speak to Doctor Bryerly. May I ring the bell, dear?'\n\n'Certainly;' and I rang it.\n\n'When does he leave Knowl?'\n\nI could not tell. Mrs. Rusk, however, was sent for, and she could tell\nus that he had announced his intention of taking the night train from\nDrackleton, and was to leave Knowl for that station at half-past six\no'clock.\n\n'May Rusk give or send him a message from me, dear?' asked Lady Knollys.\n\nOf course she might.\n\n'Then please let him know that I request he will be so good as to allow me\na very few minutes, just to say a word before he goes.'\n\n'You kind cousin!' I said, placing my two hands on her shoulders, and\nlooking earnestly in her face; 'you are anxious about me, more than you\nsay. Won't you tell me why? I am much more unhappy, really, in ignorance,\nthan if I understood the cause.'\n\n'Well, dear, haven't I told you? The two or three years of your life which\nare to form you are destined to be passed in utter loneliness, and, I am\nsure, neglect. You can't estimate the disadvantage of such an arrangement.\nIt is full of disadvantages. How it could have entered the head of poor\nAustin--although I should not say that, for I am sure I do understand\nit,--but how he could for any purpose have directed such a measure is quite\ninconceivable. I never heard of anything so foolish and abominable, and I\nwill prevent it if I can.'\n\nAt that moment Mrs. Rusk announced that Doctor Bryerly would see Lady\nKnollys at any time she pleased before his departure.\n\n'It shall be this moment, then,' said the energetic lady, and up she stood,\nand made that hasty general adjustment before the glass, which, no matter\nunder what circumstances, and before what sort of creature one's appearance\nis to be made, is a duty that every woman owes to herself. And I heard her\na moment after, at the stair-head, directing Branston to let Dr. Bryerly\nknow that she awaited him in the drawing-room.\n\nAnd now she was gone, and I began to wonder and speculate. Why should\nmy cousin Monica make all this fuss about, after all, a very natural\narrangement? My uncle, whatever he might have been, was now a good man--a\nreligious man--perhaps a little severe; and with this thought a dark streak\nfell across my sky.\n\nA cruel disciplinarian! had I not read of such characters?--lock and\nkey, bread and water, and solitude! To sit locked up all night in a dark\nout-of-the-way room, in a great, ghosty, old-fashioned house, with no one\nnearer than the other wing. What years of horror in one such night! Would\nnot this explain my poor father's hesitation, and my cousin Monica's\napparently disproportioned opposition? When an idea of terror presents\nitself to a young person's mind, it transfixes and fills the vision,\nwithout respect of probabilities or reason.\n\nMy uncle was now a terrible old martinet, with long Bible lessons,\nlectures, pages of catechism, sermons to be conned by rote, and an awful\ncatalogue of punishments for idleness, and what would seem to him impiety.\nI was going, then, to a frightful isolated reformatory, where for the first\ntime in my life I should be subjected to a rigorous and perhaps barbarous\ndiscipline.\n\nAll this was an exhalation of fancy, but it quite overcame me. I threw\nmyself, in my solitude, on the floor, upon my knees, and prayed for\ndeliverance--prayed that Cousin Monica might prevail with Doctor Bryerly,\nand both on my behalf with the Lord Chancellor, or the High Sheriff, or\nwhoever else my proper deliverer might be; and when my cousin returned, she\nfound me quite in an agony.\n\n'Why, you little fool! what fancy has taken possession of you now?' she\ncried.\n\nAnd when my new terror came to light, she actually laughed a little to\nreassure me, and she said--\n\n'My dear child, your uncle Silas will never put you through your duty to\nyour neighbour; all the time you are under his roof you'll have idleness\nand liberty enough, and too much, I fear. It is neglect, my dear, not\ndiscipline, that I'm afraid of.'\n\n'I think, dear Cousin Monica, you are afraid of something more than\nneglect,' I said, relieved, however.\n\n'I _am_ afraid of more than neglect,' she replied promptly; 'but I hope my\nfears may turn out illusory, and that possibly they may be avoided. And\nnow, for a few hours at least, let us think of something else. I rather\nlike that Doctor Bryerly. I could not get him to say what I wanted. I don't\nthink he's Scotch, but he is very cautious, and I am sure, though he would\nnot say so, that he thinks of the matter exactly as I do. He says that\nthose fine people, who are named as his co-trustees, won't take any\ntrouble, and will leave everything to him, and I am sure he is right. So\nwe must not quarrel with him, Maud, nor call him hard names, although\nhe certainly is intolerably vulgar and ugly, and at times very nearly\nimpertinent--I suppose without knowing, or indeed very much caring.'\n\nWe had a good deal to think of, and talked incessantly. There were bursts\nand interruptions of grief, and my kind cousin's consolations. I have\noften since been so lectured for giving way to grief, that I wonder at the\npatience exercised by her during this irksome visit. Then there was some\nreading of that book whose claims are always felt in the terrible days of\naffliction. After that we had a walk in the yew garden, that quaint little\ncloistered quadrangle--the most solemn, sad, and antiquated of gardens.\n\n'And now, my dear, I must really leave you for two or three hours. I have\never so many letters to write, and my people must think I'm dead by this\ntime.'\n\nSo till tea-time I had poor Mary Quince, with her gushes of simple prattle\nand her long fits of vacant silence, for my companion. And such a one, who\ncan con over by rote the old friendly gossip about the dead, talk about\ntheir ways, and looks, and likings, without much psychologic refinement,\nbut with a simple admiration and liking that never measured them\ncritically, but always with faith and love, is in general about as\ncomfortable a companion as one can find for the common moods of grief.\n\nIt is not easy to recall in calm and happy hours the sensations of an acute\nsorrow that is past. Nothing, by the merciful ordinance of God, is more\ndifficult to remember than pain. One or two great agonies of that time I do\nremember, and they remain to testify of the rest, and convince me, though I\ncan see it no more, how terrible all that period was.\n\nNext day was the funeral, that appalling necessity; smuggled away in\nwhispers, by black familiars, unresisting, the beloved one leaves home,\nwithout a farewell, to darken those doors no more; henceforward to lie\noutside, far away, and forsaken, through the drowsy heats of summer,\nthrough days of snow and nights of tempest, without light or warmth,\nwithout a voice near. Oh, Death, king of terrors! The body quakes and the\nspirit faints before thee. It is vain, with hands clasped over our eyes, to\nscream our reclamation; the horrible image will not be excluded. We have\njust the word spoken eighteen hundred years ago, and our trembling faith.\nAnd through the broken vault the gleam of the Star of Bethlehem.\n\nI was glad in a sort of agony when it was over. So long as it remained to\nbe done, something of the catastrophe was still suspended. Now it was all\nover.\n\nThe house so strangely empty. No owner--no master! I with my strange\nmomentary liberty, bereft of that irreplaceable love, never quite prized\nuntil it is lost. Most people have experienced the dismay that underlies\nsorrow under such circumstances.\n\nThe apartment of the poor outcast from life is now dismantled. Beds and\ncurtains taken down, and furniture displaced; carpets removed, windows open\nand doors locked; the bedroom and anteroom were henceforward, for many a\nday, uninhabited. Every shocking change smote my heart like a reproach.\n\nI saw that day that Cousin Monica had been crying for the first time, I\nthink, since her arrival at Knowl; and I loved her more for it, and felt\nconsoled. My tears have often been arrested by the sight of another person\nweeping, and I never could explain why. But I believe that many persons\nexperience the same odd reaction.\n\nThe funeral was conducted, in obedience to his brief but peremptory\ndirection, very privately and with little expense. But of course there was\nan attendance, and the tenants of the Knowl estate also followed the hearse\nto the mausoleum, as it is called, in the park, where he was laid beside my\ndear mother. And so the repulsive ceremonial of that dreadful day was over.\nThe grief remained, but there was rest from the fatigue of agitation, and a\ncomparative calm supervened.\n\nIt was now the stormy equinoctial weather that sounds the wild dirge of\nautumn, and marches the winter in. I love, and always did, that grand\nundefinable music, threatening and bewailing, with its strange soul of\nliberty and desolation.\n\nBy this night's mail, as we sat listening to the storm, in the drawing-room\nat Knowl, there reached me a large letter with a great black seal, and a\nwonderfully deep-black border, like a widow's crape. I did not recognise\nthe handwriting; but on opening the funereal missive, it proved to be from\nmy uncle Silas, and was thus expressed:--\n\n'MY DEAREST NIECE,--This letter will reach you, probably, on the day which\nconsigns the mortal remains of my beloved brother, Austin, your dear\nfather, to the earth. Sad ceremony, from taking my mournful part in which\nI am excluded by years, distance, and broken health. It will, I trust, at\nthis season of desolation, be not unwelcome to remember that a substitute,\nimperfect--unworthy--but most affectionately zealous, for the honoured\nparent whom you have just lost, has been appointed, in me, your uncle, by\nhis will. I am aware that you were present during the reading of it, but\nI think it will be for our mutual satisfaction that our new and more\naffectionate relations should be forthwith entered upon. My conscience and\nyour safety, and I trust convenience, will thereby be consulted. You will,\nmy dear niece, remain at Knowl, until a few simple arrangements shall have\nbeen completed for your reception at this place. I will then settle\nthe details of your little journey to us, which shall be performed as\ncomfortably and easily as possible. I humbly pray that this affliction may\nbe sanctified to us all, and that in our new duties we may be supported,\ncomforted, and directed. I need not remind you that I now stand to you _in\nloco parentis_, which means in the relation of father, and you will not\nforget that you are to remain at Knowl until you hear further from me.\n\n'I remain, my dear niece, your most affectionate uncle and guardian,\n\nSILAS RUTHYN.'\n\n'P.S.--Pray present my respects to Lady Knollys, who, I understand, is\nsojourning at Knowl. I would observe that a lady who cherishes, I have\nreason to fear, unfriendly feelings against your uncle, is not the most\ndesirable companion for his ward. But upon the express condition that I am\nnot made the subject of your discussions--a distinction which could not\nconduce to your forming a just and respectful estimate of me--I do not\ninterpose my authority to bring your intercourse to an immediate close.'\n\nAs I read this postscript, my cheek tingled as if I had received a box on\nthe ear. Uncle Silas was as yet a stranger. The menace of authority was new\nand sudden, and I felt with a pang of mortification the full force of the\nposition in which my dear father's will had placed me.\n\nI was silent, and handed the letter to my cousin, who read it with a\nkind of smile until she came, as I supposed, to the postscript, when her\ncountenance, on which my eyes were fixed, changed, and with flushed cheeks\nshe knocked the hand that held the letter on the table before her, and\nexclaimed--\n\n'Did I ever hear! Well, if this isn't impertinence! _What_ an old man that\nis!'\n\nThere was a pause, during which Lady Knollys held her head high with a\nfrown, and sniffed a little.\n\n'I did not intend to talk about him, but now I _will_. I'll talk away just\nwhatever I like; and I'll stay here just as long as you let me, Maud, and\nyou need not be one atom afraid of him. Our intercourse to an \"immediate\nclose,\" indeed! I only wish he were here. He should hear something!'\n\nAnd Cousin Monica drank off her entire cup of tea at one draught, and then\nshe said, more in her own way--\n\n'I'm better!' and drew a long breath, and then she laughed a little in a\nwaggish defiance. 'I wish we had him here, Maud, and _would_ not we give\nhim a bit of our minds! And this before the poor will is so much as\nproved!'\n\n'I am almost glad he wrote that postscript; for although I don't think he\nhas any authority in that matter while I am under my own roof,' I said,\nextemporising a legal opinion, 'and, therefore, shan't obey him, it has\nsomehow opened my eyes to my real situation.'\n\nI sighed, I believe, very desolately, for Lady Knollys came over and kissed\nme very gently and affectionately.\n\n'It really seems, Maud, as if he had a supernatural sense, and heard things\nthrough the air over fifty miles of heath and hill. You remember how, just\nas he was probably writing that very postscript yesterday, I was urging you\nto come and stay with me, and planning to move Dr. Bryerly in our favour.\nAnd so I will, Maud, and to me you _shall_ come--my guest, mind--I should\nbe so delighted; and really if Silas is under a cloud, it has been his own\ndoing, and I don't see that it is your business to fight his battle. He\ncan't live very long. The suspicion, whatever it is dies with him, and what\ncould poor dear Austin prove by his will but what everybody knew quite well\nbefore--his own strong belief in Silas's innocence? What an awful storm!\nThe room trembles. Don't you like the sound? What they used to call\n'wolving' in the old organ at Dorminster!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n_THE STORY OF UNCLE SILAS_\n\n\nAnd so it was like the yelling of phantom hounds and hunters, and the\nthunder of their coursers in the air--a furious, grand and supernatural\nmusic, which in my fancy made a suitable accompaniment to the discussion of\nthat enigmatical person--martyr--angel--demon--Uncle Silas--with whom my\nfate was now so strangely linked, and whom I had begun to fear.\n\n'The storm blows from that point,' I said, indicating it with my hand and\neye, although the window shutters and curtains were closed. 'I saw all the\ntrees bend that way this evening. That way stands the great lonely wood,\nwhere my darling father and mother lie. Oh, how dreadful on nights like\nthis, to think of them--a vault!--damp, and dark, and solitary--under the\nstorm.'\n\nCousin Monica looked wistfully in the same direction, and with a short sigh\nshe said--\n\n'We think too much of the poor remains, and too little of the spirit which\nlives for ever. I am sure they are happy.' And she sighed again. 'I wish\nI dare hope as confidently for myself. Yes, Maud, it is sad. We are such\nmaterialists, we can't help feeling so. We forget how well it is for us\nthat our present bodies are not to last always. They are constructed for a\ntime and place of trouble--plainly mere temporary machines that wear out,\nconstantly exhibiting failure and decay, and with such tremendous capacity\nfor pain. The body lies alone, and so it ought, for it is plainly its good\nCreator's will; it is only the tabernacle, not the person, who is clothed\nupon after death, Saint Paul says, \"with a house which is from heaven.\" So\nMaud, darling, although the thought will trouble us again and again, there\nis nothing in it; and the poor mortal body is only the cold ruin of a\nhabitation which _they_ have forsaken before we do. So this great wind, you\nsay, is blowing toward us from the wood there. If so, Maud, it is blowing\nfrom Bartram-Haugh, too, over the trees and chimneys of that old place, and\nthe mysterious old man, who is quite right in thinking I don't like him;\nand I can fancy him an old enchanter in his castle, waving his familiar\nspirits on the wind to fetch and carry tidings of our occupations here.'\n\nI lifted my head and listened to the storm, dying away in the distance\nsometimes--sometimes swelling and pealing around and above us--and through\nthe dark and solitude my thoughts sped away to Bartram-Haugh and Uncle\nSilas.\n\n'This letter,' I said at last, 'makes me feel differently. I think he is a\nstern old man--is he?'\n\n'It is twenty years, now, since I saw him,' answered Lady Knollys. 'I did\nnot choose to visit at his house.'\n\n'Was that before the dreadful occurrence at Bartram-Haugh?'\n\n'Yes--before, dear. He was not a reformed rake, but only a ruined one then.\nAustin was very good to him. Mr. Danvers says it is quite unaccountable how\nSilas can have made away with the immense sums he got from his brother from\ntime to time without benefiting himself in the least. But, my dear, he\nplayed; and trying to help a man who plays, and is unlucky--and some men\nare, I believe, habitually unlucky--is like trying to fill a vessel that\nhas no bottom. I think, by-the-by, my hopeful nephew, Charles Oakley,\nplays. Then Silas went most unjustifiably into all manner of speculations,\nand your poor father had to pay everything. He lost something quite\nastounding in that bank that ruined so many country gentlemen--poor Sir\nHarry Shackleton, in Yorkshire, had to sell half his estate. But your kind\nfather went on helping him, up to his marriage--I mean in that extravagant\nway which was really totally useless.'\n\n'Has my aunt been long dead?'\n\n'Twelve or fifteen years--more, indeed--she died before your poor mamma.\nShe was very unhappy, and I am sure would have given her right hand she had\nnever married Silas.'\n\n'Did you like her?'\n\n'No, dear; she was a coarse, vulgar woman.'\n\n'Coarse and vulgar, and Uncle Silas's wife!' I echoed in extreme surprise,\nfor Uncle Silas was a man of fashion--a beau in his day--and might have\nmarried women of good birth and fortune, I had no doubt, and so I expressed\nmyself. 'Yes, dear; so he might, and poor dear Austin was very anxious he\nshould, and would have helped him with a handsome settlement, I dare say,\nbut he chose to marry the daughter of a Denbigh innkeeper.'\n\n'How utterly incredible!' I exclaimed.\n\n'Not the least incredible, dear--a kind of thing not at all so uncommon as\nyou fancy.'\n\n'What!--a gentleman of fashion and refinement marry a person--'\n\n'A barmaid!--just so,' said Lady Knollys. 'I think I could count half a\ndozen men of fashion who, to my knowledge, have ruined themselves just in a\nsimilar way.'\n\n'Well, at all events, it must be allowed that in this he proved himself\naltogether unworldly.'\n\n'Not a bit unworldly, but very vicious,' replied Cousin Monica, with a\ncareless little laugh. 'She was very beautiful, curiously beautiful, for\na person in her station. She was very like that Lady Hamilton who was\nNelson's sorceress--elegantly beautiful, but perfectly low and stupid.\nI believe, to do him justice, he only intended to ruin her; but she was\ncunning enough to insist upon marriage. Men who have never in all their\nlives denied themselves the indulgence of a single fancy, cost what it\nmay, will not be baulked even by that condition if the _penchant_ be only\nviolent enough.'\n\nI did not half understand this piece of worldly psychology, at which Lady\nKnollys seemed to laugh.\n\n'Poor Silas, certainly he struggled honestly against the consequences,\nfor he tried after the honeymoon to prove the marriage bad. But the Welsh\nparson and the innkeeper papa were too strong for him, and the young lady\nwas able to hold her struggling swain fast in that respectable noose--and a\npretty prize he proved!'\n\n'And she died, poor thing, broken-hearted, I heard.'\n\n'She died, at all events, about ten years after her marriage; but I really\ncan't say about her heart. She certainly had enough ill-usage, I believe,\nto kill her; but I don't know that she had feeling enough to die of it, if\nit had not been that she drank: I am told that Welsh women often do. There\nwas jealousy, of course, and brutal quarrelling, and all sorts of horrid\nstories. I visited at Bartram-Haugh for a year or two, though no one else\nwould. But when that sort of thing began, of course I gave it up; it was\nout of the question. I don't think poor Austin ever knew how bad it was.\nAnd then came that odious business about wretched Mr. Charke. You know\nhe--he committed suicide at Bartram.'\n\n'I never heard about that,' I said; and we both paused, and she looked\nsternly at the fire, and the storm roared and ha-ha-ed till the old house\nshook again.\n\n'But Uncle Silas could not help that,' I said at last.\n\n'No, he could not help it,' she acquiesced unpleasantly.\n\n'And Uncle Silas was'--I paused in a sort of fear.\n\n'He was suspected by some people of having killed him'--she completed the\nsentence.\n\nThere was another long pause here, during which the storm outside bellowed\nand hooted like an angry mob roaring at the windows for a victim. An\nintolerable and sickening sensation overpowered me.\n\n'But _you_ did not suspect him, Cousin Knollys?' I said, trembling very\nmuch.\n\n'No,' she answered very sharply. 'I told you so before. Of course I did\nnot.'\n\nThere was another silence.\n\n'I wish, Cousin Monica,' I said, drawing close to her, 'you had not said\n_that_ about Uncle Silas being like a wizard, and sending his spirits\non the wind to listen. But I'm very glad you never suspected him.' I\ninsinuated my cold hand into hers, and looked into her face I know not with\nwhat expression. She looked down into mine with a hard, haughty stare, I\nthought.\n\n'Of _course_ I never suspected him; and _never_ ask me _that_ question\nagain, Maud Ruthyn.'\n\nWas it family pride, or what was it, that gleamed so fiercely from her eyes\nas she said this? I was frightened--I was wounded--I burst into tears.\n\n'What is my darling crying for? I did not mean to be cross. _Was_ I\ncross?' said this momentary phantom of a grim Lady Knollys, in an instant\ntranslated again into kind, pleasant Cousin Monica, with her arms about my\nneck.\n\n'No, no, indeed--only I thought I had vexed you; and, I believe, thinking\nof Uncle Silas makes me nervous, and I can't help thinking of him nearly\nalways.' 'Nor can I, although we might both easily find something better to\nthink of. Suppose we try?' said Lady Knollys.\n\n'But, first, I must know a little more about that Mr. Charke, and what\ncircumstances enabled Uncle Silas's enemies to found on his death that\nwicked slander, which has done no one any good, and caused some persons so\nmuch misery. There is Uncle Silas, I may say, ruined by it; and we all know\nhow it darkened the life of my dear father.'\n\n'People will talk, my dear. Your uncle Silas had injured himself before\nthat in the opinion of the people of his county. He was a black sheep,\nin fact. Very bad stories were told and believed of him. His marriage\ncertainly was a disadvantage, you know, and the miserable scenes that went\non in his disreputable house--all that predisposed people to believe ill of\nhim.'\n\n'How long is it since it happened?'\n\n'Oh, a long time; I think before you were born,' answered she.\n\n'And the injustice still lives--they have not forgotten it yet?' said I,\nfor such a period appeared to me long enough to have consigned anything in\nits nature perishable to oblivion.\n\nLady Knollys smiled.\n\n'Tell me, like a darling cousin, the whole story as well as you can\nrecollect it. Who was Mr. Charke?'\n\n'Mr. Charke, my dear, was a gentleman on the turf--that is the phrase, I\nthink--one of those London men, without birth or breeding, who merely in\nright of their vices and their money are admitted to associate with young\ndandies who like hounds and horses, and all that sort of thing. That set\nknew him very well, but of course no one else. He was at the Matlock\nraces, and your uncle asked him to Bartram-Haugh; and the creature, Jew\nor Gentile, whatever he was, fancied there was more honour than, perhaps,\nthere really was in a visit to Bartram-Haugh.'\n\n'For the kind of person you describe, it _was_, I think, a rather unusual\nhonour to be invited to stay in the house of a man of Uncle Ruthyn's\nbirth.'\n\n'Well, so it was perhaps; for though they knew him very well on the course,\nand would ask him to their tavern dinners, they would not, of course, admit\nhim to the houses where ladies were. But Silas's wife was not much regarded\nat Bartram-Haugh. Indeed, she was very little seen, for she was every\nevening tipsy in her bedroom, poor woman!'\n\n'How miserable!' I exclaimed.\n\n'I don't think it troubled Silas very much, for she drank gin, they said,\npoor thing, and the expense was not much; and, on the whole, I really think\nhe was glad she drank, for it kept her out of his way, and was likely to\nkill her. At this time your poor father, who was thoroughly disgusted at\nhis marriage, had stopped the supplies, you know, and Silas was very poor,\nand as hungry as a hawk, and they said he pounced upon this rich London\ngamester, intending to win his money. I am telling you now all that was\nsaid afterwards. The races lasted I forget how many days, and Mr. Charke\nstayed at Bartram-Haugh all this time and for some days after. It was\nthought that poor Austin would pay all Silas's gambling debts, and so this\nwretched Mr. Charke made heavy wagers with him on the races, and they\nplayed very deep, besides, at Bartram. He and Silas used to sit up at night\nat cards. All these particulars, as I told you, came out afterwards, for\nthere was an inquest, you know, and then Silas published what he called his\n\"statement,\" and there was a great deal of most distressing correspondence\nin the newspapers.'\n\n'And why did Mr. Charke kill himself?' I asked.\n\n'Well, I will tell you first what all are agreed about. The second night\nafter the races, your uncle and Mr. Charke sat up till between two and\nthree o'clock in the morning, quite by themselves, in the parlour. Mr.\nCharke's servant was at the Stag's Head Inn at Feltram, and therefore could\nthrow no light upon what occurred at night at Bartram-Haugh; but he was\nthere at six o'clock in the morning, and very early at his master's door by\nhis direction. He had locked it, as was his habit, upon the inside, and the\nkey was in the lock, which turned out afterwards a very important point.\nOn knocking he found that he could not awaken his master, because, as it\nappeared when the door was forced open, his master was lying dead at his\nbedside, not in a pool, but a perfect pond of blood, as they described it,\nwith his throat cut.'\n\n'How horrible!' cried I.\n\n'So it was. Your uncle Silas was called up, and greatly shocked of course,\nand he did what I believe was best. He had everything left as nearly as\npossible in the exact state in which it had been found, and he sent his\nown servant forthwith for the coroner, and, being himself a justice of\nthe peace, he took the depositions of Mr. Charke's servant while all the\nincidents were still fresh in his memory.'\n\n'Could anything be more straightforward, more right and wise?' I said.\n\n'Oh, nothing of course,' answered Lady Knollys, I thought a little drily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n_MORE ABOUT TOM CHARKE'S SUICIDE_\n\n\nSo the inquest was held, and Mr. Manwaring, of Wail Forest, was the only\njuryman who seemed to entertain the idea during the inquiry that Mr. Charke\nhad died by any hand but his own.\n\n'And how _could_ he fancy such a thing?' I exclaimed indignantly.\n\n'Well, you will see the result was quite enough to justify them in saying\nas they did, that he died by his own hand. The window was found fastened\nwith a screw on the inside, as it had been when the chambermaid had\narranged it at nine o'-clock; no one could have entered through it.\nBesides, it was on the third story, and the rooms are lofty, so it stood\nat a great height from the ground, and there was no ladder long enough\nto reach it. The house is built in the form of a hollow square, and Mr.\nCharke's room looked into the narrow court-yard within. There is but one\ndoor leading into this, and it did not show any sign of having been open\nfor years. The door was locked upon the inside, and the key in the lock,\nso that nobody could have made an entrance that way either, for it was\nimpossible, you see, to unlock the door from the outside.' 'And how could\nthey affect to question anything so clear?' I asked.\n\n'There did come, nevertheless, a kind of mist over the subject, which\ngave those who chose to talk unpleasantly an opportunity of insinuating\nsuspicions, though they could not themselves find the clue of the mystery.\nIn the first place, it appeared that he had gone to bed very tipsy, and\nthat he was heard singing and noisy in his room while getting to bed--not\nthe mood in which men make away with themselves. Then, although his own\nrazor was found in that dreadful blood (it is shocking to have to hear all\nthis) near his right hand, the fingers of his left were cut to the bone.\nThen the memorandum book in which his bets were noted was nowhere to be\nfound. That, you know, was very odd. His keys were there attached to a\nchain. He wore a great deal of gold and trinkets. I saw him, wretched\nman, on the course. They had got off their horses. He and your uncle were\nwalking on the course.'\n\n'Did he look like a gentleman?' I inquired, as I dare say, other young\nladies would.\n\n'He looked like a Jew, my dear. He had a horrid brown coat with a velvet\ncape, curling black hair over his collar, and great whiskers, very high\nshoulders, and he was puffing a cigar straight up into the air. I was\nshocked to see Silas in such company.'\n\n'And did his keys discover anything?' I asked.\n\n'On opening his travelling desk and a small japanned box within it a vast\ndeal less money was found than was expected--in fact, very little. Your\nuncle said that he had won some of it the night before at play, and\nthat Charke complained to him when tipsy of having had severe losses to\ncounterbalance his gains on the races. Besides, he had been paid but a\nsmall part of those gains. About his book it appeared that there were\nlittle notes of bets on the backs of letters, and it was said that\nhe sometimes made no other memorandum of his wagers--but this was\ndisputed--and among those notes there was not one referring to Silas. But,\nthen, there was an omission of all allusion to his transactions with two\nother well-known gentlemen. So that was not singular.'\n\n'No, certainly; that was quite accounted for,' said I.\n\n'And then came the question,' continued she, 'what motive could Mr. Charke\npossibly have had for making away with himself.'\n\n'But is not that very difficult to make out in many cases?' I interposed.\n\n'It was said that he had some mysterious troubles in London, at which he\nused to hint. Some people said that he really was in a scrape, but others\nthat there was no such thing, and that when he talked so he was only\njesting. There was no suspicion during the inquest that your uncle Silas\nwas involved, except those questions of Mr. Manwaring's.'\n\n'What were they?' I asked.\n\n'I really forget; but they greatly offended your uncle, and there was a\nlittle scene in the room. Mr. Manwaring seemed to think that some one had\nsomehow got into the room. Through the door it could not be, nor down the\nchimney, for they found an iron bar across the flue, near the top in the\nmasonry. The window looked into a court-yard no bigger than a ball-room.\nThey went down and examined it, but, though the ground beneath was moist,\nthey could not discover the slightest trace of a footprint. So far as they\ncould make out, Mr. Charke had hermetically sealed himself into his room,\nand then cut his throat with his own razor.'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'for it was all secured--that is, the window and the\ndoor--upon the inside, and no sign of any attempt to get in.'\n\n'Just so; and when the walls were searched, and, as your uncle Silas\ndirected, the wainscoting removed, some months afterwards, when the scandal\ngrew loudest, then it was evident that there was no concealed access to the\nroom.'\n\n'So the answer to all those calumnies was simply that the crime was\nimpossible,' said I. 'How dreadful that such a slander should have required\nan answer at all!'\n\n'It was an unpleasant affair even then, although I cannot say that anyone\nsupposed Silas guilty; but you know the whole thing was disreputable, that\nMr. Charke was a discreditable inmate, the occurrence was horrible, and\nthere was a glare of publicity which brought into relief the scandals of\nBartram-Haugh. But in a little time it became, all on a sudden, a great\ndeal worse.'\n\nMy cousin paused to recollect exactly.\n\n'There were very disagreeable whispers among the sporting people in London.\nThis person, Charke, had written two letters. Yes--two. They were published\nabout two months after, by the villain to whom they were written; he wanted\nto extort money. They were first talked of a great deal among that set in\ntown; but the moment they were published they produced a sensation in the\ncountry, and a storm of newspaper commentary. The first of these was of no\ngreat consequence, but the second was very startling, embarrassing, and\neven alarming.'\n\n'What was it, Cousin Monica?' I whispered.\n\n'I can only tell you in a general way, it is so very long since I read\nit; but both were written in the same kind of slang, and parts as hard to\nunderstand as a prize fight. I hope you never read those things.'\n\nI satisfied this sudden educational alarm, and Lady Knollys proceeded.\n\n'I am afraid you hardly hear me, the wind makes such an uproar. Well,\nlisten. The letter said distinctly, that he, Mr. Charke, had made a very\nprofitable visit to Bartram-Haugh, and mentioned in exact figures for how\nmuch he held your uncle Silas's I.O.U.'s, for he could not pay him. I can't\nsay what the sum was. I only remember that it was quite frightful. It took\naway my breath when I read it.'\n\n'Uncle Silas had lost it?' I asked.\n\n'Yes, and owed it; and had given him those papers called I.O.U.'s promising\nto pay, which, of course, Mr. Charke had locked up with his money; and the\ninsinuation was that Silas had made away with him, to get rid of this debt,\nand that he had also taken a great deal of his money.\n\n'I just recollect these points which were exactly what made the\nimpression,' continued Lady Knollys, after a short pause; 'the letter was\nwritten in the evening of the last day of the wretched man's life, so that\nthere had not been much time for your uncle Silas to win back his money;\nand he stoutly alleged that he did not owe Mr. Charke a guinea. It\nmentioned an enormous sum as being actually owed by Silas; and it cautioned\nthe man, an agent, to whom he wrote, not to mention the circumstance, as\nSilas could only pay by getting the money from his wealthy brother, who\nwould have the management; and he distinctly said that he had kept the\nmatter very close at Silas's request. That, you know, was a very awkward\nletter, and all the worse that it was written in brutally high spirits, and\nnot at all like a man meditating an exit from the world. You can't imagine\nwhat a sensation the publication of these letters produced. In a moment\nthe storm was up, and certainly Silas did meet it bravely--yes, with great\ncourage and ability. What a pity he did not early enter upon some career of\nambition! Well, well, it is idle regretting. He suggested that the letters\nwere forgeries. He alleged that Charke was in the habit of boasting, and\ntelling enormous falsehoods about his gambling transactions, especially in\nhis letters. He reminded the world how often men affect high animal spirits\nat the very moment of meditating suicide. He alluded, in a manly and\ngraceful way, to his family and their character. He took a high and\nmenacing tone with his adversaries, and he insisted that what they dared to\ninsinuate against him was physically impossible.'\n\nI asked in what form this vindication appeared.\n\n'It was a letter, printed as a pamphlet; everybody admired its ability,\ningenuity, and force, and it was written with immense rapidity.'\n\n'Was it at all in the style of his letters?' I innocently asked.\n\nMy cousin laughed.\n\n'Oh, dear, no! Ever since he avowed himself a religious character, he had\nwritten nothing but the most vapid and nerveless twaddle. Your poor dear\nfather used to send his letters to me to read, and I sometimes really\nthought that Silas was losing his faculties; but I believe he was only\ntrying to write in character.'\n\n'I suppose the general feeling was in his favour?' I said.\n\n'I don't think it was, anywhere; but in his own county it was certainly\nunanimously against him. There is no use in asking why; but so it was, and\nI think it would have been easier for him with his unaided strength to\nuproot the Peak than to change the convictions of the Derbyshire gentlemen.\nThey were all against him. Of course there were predisposing causes. Your\nuncle published a very bitter attack upon them, describing himself as the\nvictim of a political conspiracy: and I recollect he mentioned that from\nthe hour of the shocking catastrophe in his house, he had forsworn the turf\nand all pursuits and amusements connected with it. People sneered, and said\nhe might as well go as wait to be kicked out.'\n\n'Were there law-suits about all this?' I asked.\n\n'Everybody expected that there would, for there were very savage things\nprinted on both sides, and I think, too, that the persons who thought worst\nof him expected that evidence would yet turn up to convict Silas of the\ncrime they chose to impute; and so years have glided away, and many of the\npeople who remembered the tragedy of Bartram-Haugh, and took the strongest\npart in the denunciation, and ostracism that followed, are dead, and no new\nlight had been thrown upon the occurrence, and your uncle Silas remains an\noutcast. At first he was quite wild with rage, and would have fought the\nwhole county, man by man, if they would have met him. But he had since\nchanged his habits and, as he says, his aspirations altogether.'\n\n'He has become religious.'\n\n'The only occupation remaining to him. He owes money; he is poor; he is\nisolated; and he says, sick and religious. Your poor father, who was\nvery decided and inflexible, never helped him beyond the limit he had\nprescribed, after Silas's _m\u00c3\u00a9salliance_. He wanted to get him into\nParliament, and would have paid his expenses, and made him an allowance;\nbut either Silas had grown lazy, or he understood his position better than\npoor Austin, or he distrusted his powers, or possibly he really is in\nill-health; but he objected his religious scruples. Your poor papa thought\nself-assertion possible, where an injured man has right to rely upon, but\nhe had been very long out of the world, and the theory won't do. Nothing is\nharder than to get a person who has once been effectually slurred, received\nagain. Silas, I think, was right. I don't think it was practicable.\n\n'Dear child, how late it is!' exclaimed Lady Knollys suddenly, looking at\nthe Louis Quatorze clock, that crowned the mantelpiece.\n\nIt was near one o'clock. The storm had a little subsided, and I took a less\nagitated and more confident view of Uncle Silas than I had at an earlier\nhour of that evening.\n\n'And what do you think of him?' I asked.\n\nLady Knollys drummed on the table with her finger points as she looked into\nthe fire.\n\n'I don't understand metaphysics, my dear, nor witchcraft. I sometimes\nbelieve in the supernatural, and sometimes I don't. Silas Ruthyn is himself\nalone, and I can't define him, because I don't understand him. Perhaps\nother souls than human are sometimes born into the world, and clothed in\nflesh. It is not only about that dreadful occurrence, but nearly always\nthroughout his life; early and late he has puzzled me. I have tried in vain\nto understand him. But at one time of his life I am sure he was awfully\nwicked--eccentric indeed in his wickedness--gay, frivolous, secret, and\ndangerous. At one time I think he could have made poor Austin do almost\nanything; but his influence vanished with his marriage, never to return\nagain. No; I don't understand him. He always bewildered me, like a shifting\nface, sometimes smiling, but always sinister, in an unpleasant dream.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n_I AM PERSUADED_\n\n\nSo now at last I had heard the story of Uncle Silas's mysterious disgrace.\nWe sat silent for a while, and I, gazing into vacancy, sent him in a\nchariot of triumph, chapletted, ringed, and robed through the city of\nimagination, crying after him, 'Innocent! innocent! martyr and crowned!'\nAll the virtues and honesties, reason and conscience, in myriad\nshapes--tier above tier of human faces--from the crowded pavement, crowded\nwindows, crowded roofs, joined in the jubilant acclamation, and trumpeters\ntrumpeted, and drums rolled, and great organs and choirs through open\ncathedral gates, rolled anthems of praise and thanksgiving, and the bells\nrang out, and cannons sounded, and the air trembled with the roaring\nharmony; and Silas Ruthyn, the full-length portrait, stood in the burnished\nchariot, with a proud, sad, clouded face, that rejoiced not with the\nrejoicers, and behind him the slave, thin as a ghost, white-faced, and\nsneering something in his ear: while I and all the city went on crying\n'Innocent! innocent! martyr and crowned!' And now the reverie was ended;\nand there were only Lady Knollys' stern, thoughtful face, with the pale\nlight of sarcasm on it, and the storm outside thundering and lamenting\ndesolately.\n\nIt was very good of Cousin Monica to stay with me so long. It must have\nbeen unspeakably tiresome. And now she began to talk of business at home,\nand plainly to prepare for immediate flight, and my heart sank.\n\nI know that I could not then have defined my feelings and agitations. I am\nnot sure that I even now could. Any misgiving about Uncle Silas was, in my\nmind, a questioning the foundations of my faith, and in itself an impiety.\nAnd yet I am not sure that some such misgiving, faint, perhaps, and\nintermittent, may not have been at the bottom of my tribulation.\n\nI was not very well. Lady Knollys had gone out for a walk. She was not\neasily tired, and sometimes made a long excursion. The sun was setting now,\nwhen Mary Quince brought me a letter which had just arrived by the post. My\nheart throbbed violently. I was afraid to break the broad black seal. It\nwas from Uncle Silas. I ran over in my mind all the unpleasant mandates\nwhich it might contain, to try and prepare myself for a shock. At last\nI opened the letter. It directed me to hold myself in readiness for the\njourney to Bartram-Haugh. It stated that I might bring two maids with me if\nI wished so many, and that his next letter would give me the details of my\nroute, and the day of my departure for Derbyshire; and he said that I ought\nto make arrangements about Knowl during my absence, but that he was hardly\nthe person properly to be consulted on that matter. Then came a prayer that\nhe might be enabled to acquit himself of his trust to the full satisfaction\nof his conscience, and that I might enter upon my new relations in a spirit\nof prayer.\n\nI looked round my room, so long familiar, and now so endeared by the idea\nof parting and change. The old house--dear, dear Knowl, how could I leave\nyou and all your affectionate associations, and kind looks and voices, for\na strange land!\n\nWith a great sigh I took Uncle Silas's letter, and went down stairs to the\ndrawing-room. From the lobby window, where I loitered for a few moments,\nI looked out upon the well-known forest-trees. The sun was down. It was\nalready twilight, and the white vapours of coming night were already\nfilming their thinned and yellow foliage. Everything looked melancholy.\nHow little did those who envied the young inheritrex of a princely fortune\nsuspect the load that lay at her heart, or, bating the fear of death, how\ngladly at that moment she would have parted with her life!\n\nLady Knollys had not yet returned, and it was darkening rapidly; a mass of\nblack clouds stood piled in the west, through the chasms of which was still\nreflected a pale metallic lustre.\n\nThe drawing-room was already very dark; but some streaks of this cold light\nfell upon a black figure, which would otherwise have been unseen, leaning\nbeside the curtains against the window frame.\n\nIt advanced abruptly, with creaking shoes; it was Doctor Bryerly.\n\nI was startled and surprised, not knowing how he had got there. I stood\nstaring at him in the dusk rather awkwardly, I am afraid.\n\n'How do you do, Miss Ruthyn?' said he, extending his hand, long, hard, and\nbrown as a mummy's, and stooping a little so as to approach more nearly,\nfor it was not easy to see in the imperfect light. 'You're surprised, I\ndare say, to see me here so soon again?'\n\n'I did not know you had arrived. I am glad to see you, Doctor Bryerly.\nNothing unpleasant, I hope, has happened?'\n\n'No, nothing unpleasant, Miss. The will has been lodged, and we shall have\nprobate in due course; but there has been something on my mind, and I'm\ncome to ask you two or three questions which you had better answer very\nconsiderately. Is Miss Knollys still here?'\n\n'Yes, but she is not returned from her walk.'\n\n'I am glad she is here. I think she takes a sound view, and women\nunderstand one another better. As for me, it is plainly my duty to put it\nbefore you as it strikes me, and to offer all I can do in accomplishing,\nshould you wish it, a different arrangement. You don't know your uncle, you\nsaid the other day?'\n\n'No, I've never seen him.'\n\n'You understand your late father's intention in making you his ward?'\n\n'I suppose he wished to show his high opinion of my uncle's fitness for\nsuch a trust.'\n\n'That's quite true; but the nature of the trust in this instance is\nextraordinary.'\n\n'I don't understand.'\n\n'Why, if you die before you come to the age of twenty-one, the entire of\nthe property will go to him--do you see?--and he has the custody of your\nperson in the meantime; you are to live in his house, under his care and\nauthority. You see now, I think, how it is; and I did not like it when your\nfather read the will to me, and I said so. Do _you_?'\n\nI hesitated to speak, not sure that I quite comprehended him.\n\n'And the more I think of it, the less I like it, Miss,' said Doctor\nBryerly, in a calm, stern tone.\n\n'Merciful Heaven! Doctor Bryerly, you can't suppose that I should not be\nas safe in my uncle's house as in the Lord Chancellor's?' I ejaculated,\nlooking full in his face.\n\n'But don't you see, Miss, it is not a fair position to put your uncle in,'\nreplied he, after a little hesitation.\n\n'But suppose _he_ does not think so. You know, if he does, he may decline\nit.'\n\n'Well that's true--but he won't. Here is his letter'--and he produced\nit--'announcing officially that he means to accept the office; but I think\nhe ought to be told it is not _delicate_, under all circumstances.\nYou know, Miss, that your uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn, was talked about\nunpleasantly once.'\n\n'You mean'--I began.\n\n'I mean about the death of Mr. Charke, at Bartram-Haugh.'\n\n'Yes, I have heard that,' I said; he was speaking with a shocking _aplomb_.\n\n'We assume, of course, _unjustly_; but there are many who think quite\ndifferently.'\n\n'And possibly, Doctor Bryerly, it was for that very reason that my dear\npapa made him my guardian.'\n\n'There can be no doubt of that, Miss; it was to purge him of that scandal.'\n\n'And when he has acquitted himself honourably of that trust, don't you\nthink such a proof of confidence so honourably fulfilled must go far to\nsilence his traducers?'\n\n'Why, if all goes well, it may do a little; but a great deal less than you\nfancy. But take it that you happen to _die_, Miss, during your minority. We\nare all mortal, and there are three years and some months to go; how will\nit be then? Don't you see? Just fancy how people will talk.'\n\n'I think you know that my uncle is a religious man?' said I.\n\n'Well, Miss, what of that?' he asked again.\n\n'He is--he has suffered intensely,' I continued. 'He has long retired from\nthe world; he is very religious. Ask our curate, Mr. Fairfield, if you\ndoubt it.'\n\n'But I am not disputing it, Miss; I'm only supposing what may happen--an\naccident, we'll call it small-pox, diphtheria, _that's_ going very much.\nThree years and three months, you know, is a long time. You proceed to\nBartram-Haugh, thinking you have much goods laid up for many years; but\nyour Creator, you know, may say, \"Thou fool, this day is thy soul required\nof thee.\" You go--and what pray is thought of your uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn,\nwho walks in for the entire inheritance, and who has long been abused like\na pickpocket, or worse, in his own county, I'm told?'\n\n'You are a religious man, Doctor Bryerly, according to your lights?' I\nsaid.\n\nThe Swedenborgian smiled.\n\n'Well, knowing that he is so too, and having yourself experienced the power\nof religion, do not you think him deserving of every confidence? Don't you\nthink it well that he should have this opportunity of exhibiting both his\nown character and the reliance which my dear papa reposed on it, and that\nwe should leave all consequences and contingencies in the hands of Heaven?'\n\n'It appears to have been the will of Heaven hitherto,' said Doctor\nBryerly--I could not see with what expression of face, but he was looking\ndown, and drawing little diagrams with his stick on the dark carpet, and\nspoke in a very low tone--'that your uncle should suffer under this ill\nreport. In countervailing the appointment of Providence, we must employ our\nreason, with conscientious diligence, as to the means, and if we find that\nthey are as likely to do mischief as good, we have no right to expect a\nspecial interposition to turn our experiment into an ordeal. I think you\nought to weigh it well--I am sure there are reasons against it. If you make\nup your mind that you would rather be placed under the care, say of Lady\nKnollys, I will endeavour all I can to effect it.'\n\n'That could not be done without his consent, could it?' said I.\n\n'No, but I don't despair of getting that--on terms, of course,' remarked\nhe.\n\n'I don't quite understand,' I said.\n\n'I mean, for instance, if he were allowed to keep the allowance for your\nmaintenance--eh?'\n\n'I mistake my uncle Silas very much,' I said, 'if that allowance is any\nobject whatever to him compared with the moral value of the position. If he\nwere deprived of that, I am sure he would decline the other.'\n\n'We might try him at all events,' said Doctor Bryerly, on whose dark sinewy\nfeatures, even in this imperfect light, I thought I detected a smile.\n\n'Perhaps,' said I, 'I appear very foolish in supposing him actuated by any\nbut sordid motives; but he is my near relation, and I can't help it, sir.'\n\n'That is a very serious thing, Miss Ruthyn,' he replied. 'You are very\nyoung, and cannot see it at present, as you will hereafter. He is very\nreligious, you say, and all that, but his house is not a proper place for\nyou. It is a solitude--its master an outcast, and it has been the repeated\nscene of all sorts of scandals, and of one great crime; and Lady Knollys\nthinks your having been domesticated there will be an injury to you all the\ndays of your life.'\n\n'So I do, Maud,' said Lady Knollys, who had just entered the room\nunperceived,--'How do you do, Doctor Bryerly?--a serious injury. You have\nno idea how entirely that house is condemned and avoided, and the very name\nof its inmates tabooed.'\n\n'How monstrous--how cruel!' I exclaimed.\n\n'Very unpleasant, my dear, but perfectly natural. You are to recollect that\nquite independently of the story of Mr. Charke, the house was talked about,\nand the county people had cut your uncle Silas long before that adventure\nwas dreamed of; and as to the circumstance of your being placed in his\ncharge by his brother, who took, from strong family feeling, a totally\none-sided view of the affair from the first, having the slightest effect in\nrestoring his position in the county, you must quite give that up. Except\nme, if he will allow me, and the clergyman, not a soul in the country will\nvisit at Bartram-Haugh. They may pity you, and think the whole thing the\nclimax of folly and cruelty; but they won't visit at Bartram, or know\nSilas, or have anything to do with his household.'\n\n'They will see, at all events, what my dear papa's opinion was.'\n\n'They know that already,' answered she, 'and it has not, and ought not to\nhave, the slightest weight with them. There are people there who think\nthemselves just as great as the Ruthyns, or greater; and your poor father's\nidea of carrying it by a demonstration was simply the dream of a man who\nhad forgotten the world, and learned to exaggerate himself in his long\nseclusion. I know he was beginning himself to hesitate; and I think if he\nhad been spared another year that provision of his will would have been\nstruck out.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly nodded, and he said--\n\n'And if he had the power to dictate _now_, would he insist on that\ndirection? It is a mistake every way, injurious to you, his child; and\nshould you happen to die during your sojourn under your uncle's care, it\nwould woefully defeat the testator's object, and raise such a storm of\nsurmise and inquiry as would awaken all England, and send the old scandal\non the wing through the world again.'\n\n'Doctor Bryerly will, I have no doubt, arrange it all. In fact, I do not\nthink it would be very difficult to bring Silas to terms; and if you do not\nconsent to his trying, Maud, mark my words, you will live to repent it.'\n\nHere were two persons viewing the question from totally different points;\nboth perfectly disinterested; both in their different ways, I believe,\nshrewd and even wise; and both honourable, urging me against it, and in a\nway that undefinably alarmed my imagination, as well as moved my reason. I\nlooked from one to the other--there was a silence. By this time the candles\nhad come, and we could see one another.\n\n'I only wait your decision, Miss Ruthyn,' said the trustee, 'to see\nyour uncle. If his advantage was the chief object contemplated in this\narrangement, he will be the best judge whether his interest is really best\nconsulted by it or no; and I think he will clearly see that it is _not_ so,\nand will answer accordingly.'\n\n'I cannot answer now--you must allow me to think it over--I will do my\nbest. I am very much obliged, my dear Cousin Monica, you are so very good,\nand you too, Doctor Bryerly.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly by this time was looking into his pocket-book, and did not\nacknowledge my thanks even by a nod.\n\n'I must be in London the day after to-morrow. Bartram-Haugh is nearly sixty\nmiles from here, and only twenty of that by rail, I find. Forty miles of\nposting over those Derbyshire mountains is slow work; but if you say _try_,\nI'll see him to-morrow morning.'\n\n'You must say try--you _must_, my dear Maud.'\n\n'But how can I decide in a moment? Oh, dear Cousin Monica, I am so\ndistracted!'\n\n'But _you_ need not decide at all; the decision rests with _him_. Come; he\nis more competent than you. You _must_ say yes.'\n\nAgain I looked from her to Doctor Bryerly, and from him to her again. I\nthrew my arms about her neck, and hugging her closely to me, I cried--\n\n'Oh, Cousin Monica, dear Cousin Monica, advise me. I am a wretched\ncreature. You must advise me.'\n\nI did not know till now how irresolute a character was mine.\n\nI knew somehow by the tone of her voice that she was smiling as she\nanswered--\n\n'Why, dear, I have advised you; I _do_ advise you;' and then she added,\nimpetuously, 'I entreat and implore, if you really think I love you, that\nyou will _follow_ my advice. It is your duty to leave your uncle Silas,\nwhom you believe to be more competent than you are, to decide, after full\nconference with Doctor Bryerly, who knows more of your poor father's views\nand intentions in making that appointment than either you or I.'\n\n'Shall I say, yes?' I cried, drawing her close, and kissing her\nhelplessly.' Oh, tell me--tell me to say, yes.'\n\n'Yes, of course, _yes_. She agrees, Doctor Bryerly, to your kind proposal.'\n\n'I am to understand so?' he asked.\n\n'Very well--yes, Doctor Bryerly,' I replied.\n\n'You have resolved wisely and well,' said he, briskly, like a man who has\ngot a care off his mind.\n\n'I forgot to say, Doctor Bryerly--it was very rude--that you must stay here\nto-night.'\n\n'He _can't_, my dear,' interposed Lady Knolly's; 'it is a long way.'\n\n'He will dine. Won't you, Doctor Bryerly?'\n\n'No; he can't. You know you can't, sir,' said my cousin, peremptorily. 'You\nmust not worry him, my dear, with civilities he can't accept. He'll bid us\ngood-bye this moment. Good-bye, Doctor Bryerly. You'll write immediately;\ndon't wait till you reach town. Bid him good-bye, Maud. I'll say a word to\nyou in the hall.'\n\nAnd thus she literally hurried him out of the room, leaving me in a state\nof amazement and confusion, not able to review my decision--unsatisfied,\nbut still unable to recall it.\n\nI stood where they had left me, looking after them, I suppose, like a fool.\n\nLady Knollys returned in a few minutes. If I had been a little cooler I was\nshrewd enough to perceive that she had sent poor Doctor Bryerly away upon\nhis travels, to find board and lodging half-way to Bartram, to remove\nhim forthwith from my presence, and thus to make my decision--if mine it\nwas--irrevocable.\n\n'I applaud you, my dear,' said Cousin Knollys, in her turn embracing me\nheartily. 'You are a sensible little darling, and have done exactly what\nyou ought to have done.'\n\n'I hope I have,' I faltered.\n\n'Hope? fiddle! stuff! the thing's as plain as a pikestaff.'\n\nAnd in came Branston to say that dinner was served.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n_HOW THE AMBASSADOR FARED_\n\n\nLady Knollys, I could plainly see, when we got into the brighter lights at\nthe dinner table, was herself a good deal excited; she was relieved\nand glad, and was garrulous during our meal, and told me all her early\nrecollections of dear papa. Most of them I had heard before; but they could\nnot be told too often.\n\nNotwithstanding my mind sometimes wandered, _often_ indeed, to the\nconference so unexpected, so suddenly decisive, possibly so momentous; and\nwith a dismayed uncertainly, the question--had I done right?--was always\nbefore me.\n\nI dare say my cousin understood my character better, perhaps, after all my\nhonest self-study, then I do even now. Irresolute, suddenly reversing my\nown decisions, impetuous in action as she knew me, she feared, I am sure,\na revocation of my commission to Doctor Bryerly, and thought of the\ncountermand I might send galloping after him.\n\nSo, kind creature, she laboured to occupy my thoughts, and when one theme\nwas exhausted found another, and had always her parry prepared as often as\nI directed a reflection or an enquiry to the re-opening of the question\nwhich she had taken so much pains to close.\n\nThat night I was troubled. I was already upbraiding myself. I could not\nsleep, and at last sat up in bed, and cried. I lamented my weakness in\nhaving assented to Doctor Bryerly's and my cousin's advice. Was I not\ndeparting from my engagement to my dear papa? Was I not consenting that\nmy Uncle Silas should be induced to second my breach of faith by a\ncorresponding perfidy?\n\nLady Knollys had done wisely in despatching Doctor Bryerly so promptly;\nfor, most assuredly, had he been at Knowl next morning when I came down I\nshould have recalled my commission.\n\nThat day in the study I found four papers which increased my perturbation.\nThey were in dear papa's handwriting, and had an indorsement in these\nwords--'Copy of my letter addressed to ----, one of the trustees named in\nmy will.' Here, then, were the contents of those four sealed letters which\nhad excited mine and Lady Knollys' curiosity on the agitating day on which\nthe will was read.\n\nIt contained these words:--\n\n'I name my oppressed and unhappy brother, Silas Ruthyn, residing at my\nhouse of Bartram-Haugh, as guardian of the person of my beloved child, to\nconvince the world if possible, and failing that, to satisfy at least all\nfuture generations of our family, that his brother, who knew him best,\nhad implicit confidence in him, and that he deserved it. A cowardly and\npreposterous slander, originating in political malice, and which never have\nbeen whispered had he not been poor and imprudent, is best silenced by this\nordeal of purification. All I possess goes to him if my child dies under\nage; and the custody of her person I commit meanwhile to him alone, knowing\nthat she is as safe in his as she could have been under my own care. I rely\nupon your remembrance of our early friendship to make this known wherever\nan opportunity occurs, and also to say what your sense of justice may\nwarrant.'\n\nThe other letters were in the same spirit. My heart sank like lead as I\nread them. I quaked with fear. What had I done? My father's wise and noble\nvindication of our dishonoured name I had presumed to frustrate. I had,\nlike a coward, receded from my easy share in the task; and, merciful\nHeaven, I had broken my faith with the dead!\n\nWith these letters in my hand, white with fear, I flew like a shadow to the\ndrawing-room where Cousin Monica was, and told her to read them. I saw by\nher countenance how much alarmed she was by my looks, but she said nothing,\nonly read the letters hurriedly, and then exclaimed--\n\n'Is this all, my dear child? I really fancied you had found a second will,\nand had lost everything. Why, my dearest Maud, we knew all this before.\nWe quite understood poor dear Austin's motive. Why are you so easily\ndisturbed?'\n\n'Oh, Cousin Monica, I think he was right; it all seems quite reasonable\nnow; and I--oh, what a crime!--it must be stopped.'\n\n'My dear Maud, listen to reason. Doctor Bryerly has seen your uncle at\nBartram at least two hours ago. You _can't_ stop it, and why on earth\nshould you if you could? Don't you think your uncle should be consulted?'\nsaid she.\n\n'But he has _decided_. I have his letter speaking of it as settled; and\nDoctor Bryerly--oh, Cousin Monica, he's gone _to tempt him_.'\n\n'Nonsense, girl! Doctor Bryerly is a good and just man, I do believe, and\nhas, beside, no imaginable motive to pervert either his conscience or his\njudgment. He's not gone to tempt him--stuff!--but to unfold the facts and\ninvite his consideration; and I say, considering how thoughtlessly such\nduties are often undertaken, and how long Silas has been living in lazy\nsolitude, shut out from the world, and unused to discuss anything, I do\nthink it only conscientious and honourable that he should have a fair and\ndistinct view of the matter in all its bearings submitted to him before he\nindolently incurs what may prove the worst danger he was ever involved in.'\n\nSo Lady Knollys argued, with feminine energy, and I must confess, with a\ngood deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of\nmy own sex, and she puzzled without satisfying me.\n\n'I don't know why I went to that room,' I said, quite frightened; 'or why I\nwent to that press; how it happened that these papers, which we never saw\nthere before, were the first things to strike my eye to-day.'\n\n'What do you mean, dear?' said Lady Knollys.\n\n'I mean this--I think I was _brought_ there, and that _there_ is poor\npapa's appeal to me, as plain as if his hand came and wrote it upon the\nwall.' I nearly screamed the conclusion of this wild confession.\n\n'You are nervous, my darling; your bad nights have worn you out. Let us go\nout; the air will do you good; and I do assure you that you will very soon\nsee that we are quite right, and rejoice conscientiously that you have\nacted as you did.'\n\nBut I was not to be satisfied, although my first vehemence was quieted. In\nmy prayers that night my conscience upbraided me. When I lay down in bed\nmy nervousness returned fourfold. Everybody at all nervously excitable\nhas suffered some time or another by the appearance of ghastly features\npresenting themselves in every variety of contortion, one after another,\nthe moment the eyes are closed. This night my dear father's face troubled\nme--sometimes white and sharp as ivory, sometimes strangely transparent\nlike glass, sometimes all hanging in cadaverous folds, always with the same\nunnatural expression of diabolical fury.\n\nFrom this dreadful vision I could only escape by sitting up and staring\nat the light. At length, worn out, I dropped asleep, and in a dream I\ndistinctly heard papa's voice say sharply outside the bed-curtain:--'Maud,\nwe shall be late at Bartram-Haugh.'\n\nAnd I awoke in a horror, the wall, as it seemed, still ringing with the\nsummons, and the speaker, I fancied, standing at the other side of the\ncurtain.\n\nA miserable night I passed. In the morning, looking myself like a ghost, I\nstood in my night-dress by Lady Knollys' bed.\n\n'I have had my warning,' I said. 'Oh, Cousin Monica, papa has been with me,\nand ordered me to Bartram-Haugh; and go I will.'\n\nShe stared in my face uncomfortably, and then tried to laugh the matter\noff; but I know she was troubled at the strange state to which agitation\nand suspense had reduced me.\n\n'You're taking too much for granted, Maud,' said she; 'Silas Ruthyn,\nmost likely, will refuse his consent, and insist on your going to\nBartram-Haugh.'\n\n'Heaven grant!' I exclaimed; 'but if he doesn't, it is all the same to me,\ngo I will. He may turn me out, but I'll go, and try to expiate the breach\nof faith that I fear is so horribly wicked.'\n\nWe had several hours still to wait for the arrival of the post. For both of\nus the delay was a suspense; for me an almost agonising one. At length,\nat an unlooked-for moment, Branston did enter the room with the post-bag.\nThere was a large letter, with the Feltram post-mark, addressed to Lady\nKnollys--it was Doctor Bryerly's despatch; we read it together. It was\ndated on the day before, and its purport was thus:--\n\n'RESPECTED MADAM,--I this day saw Mr. Silas Ruthyn at Bartram-Haugh, and\nhe peremptorily refuses, on any terms, to vacate the guardianship, or to\nconsent to Miss Ruthyn's residing anywhere but under his own immediate\ncare. As he bases his refusal, first upon a conscientious difficulty,\ndeclaring that he has no right, through fear of personal contingencies, to\nabdicate an office imposed in so solemn a way, and so naturally devolving\non him as only brother to the deceased; and secondly upon the effect such a\nwithdrawal, at the instance of the acting trustee, would have upon his own\ncharacter, amounting to a public self-condemnation; and as he refused to\ndiscuss these positions with me, I could make no way whatsoever with him.\nFinding, therefore, that his mind was quite made up, after a short time I\ntook my leave. He mentioned that preparations for his niece's reception are\nbeing completed, and that he will send for her in a few days; so that I\nthink it will be advisable that I should go down to Knowl, to assist Miss\nRuthyn with any advice she may require before her departure, to discharge\nservants, get inventories made, and provide for the care of the place and\ngrounds during her minority.\n\n'I am, respected Madam, yours truly,\n\nHANS E. BRYERLY.'\n\nI can't describe to you how chapfallen and angry my cousin looked. She\nsniffed once or twice, and then said, rather bitterly, in a subdued tone:--\n\n'Well, _now_; I hope you are pleased?'\n\n'No, no, no; you _know_ I'm not--grieved to the heart, my only friend, my\ndear Cousin Monica; but my conscience is at rest; you don't know what a\nsacrifice it is; I am a most unhappy creature. I feel an indescribable\nforeboding. I am frightened; but you won't forsake me, Cousin Monica.'\n\n'No, darling, never,' she said, sadly.\n\n'And you'll come and see me, won't you, as often as you can?'\n\n'Yes, dear; that is if Silas allows me; and I'm sure he will,' she added\nhastily, seeing, I suppose, my terror in my face. 'All I can do, you may be\nsure I will, and perhaps he will allow you to come to me, now and then, for\na short visit. You know I am only six miles away--little more than half an\nhour's drive, and though I hate Bartram, and detest Silas--Yes, I _detest\nSilas_,' she repeated in reply to my surprised gaze--'I _will_ call at\nBartram--that is, I say, if he allows me; for, you know, I haven't been\nthere for a quarter of a century; and though I never understood Silas, I\nfancy he forgives no sins, whether of omission or commission.'\n\nI wondered what old grudge could make my cousin judge Uncle Silas always\nso hardly--I could not suppose it was justice. I had seen my hero indeed\nlately so disrespectfully handled before my eyes, that he had, as idols\nwill, lost something of his sacredness. But as an article of faith, I still\ncultivated my trust in his divinity, and dismissed every intruding doubt\nwith an exorcism, as a suggestion of the evil one. But I wronged Lady\nKnollys in suspecting her of pique, or malice, or anything more than that\ntendency to take strong views which some persons attribute to my sex.\n\nSo, then, the little project of Cousin Monica's guardianship, which, had it\nbeen poor papa's wish, would have made me so very happy, was quite knocked\non the head, to revive no more. I comforted myself, however, with her\npromise to re-open communications with Bartram-Haugh, and we grew resigned.\n\nI remember, next morning, as we sat at a very late breakfast, Lady Knollys,\nreading a letter, suddenly made an exclamation and a little laugh, and read\non with increased interest for a few minutes, and then, with another little\nlaugh, she looked up, placing her hand, with the open letter in it, beside\nher tea-cup.\n\n'You'll not guess whom I've been reading about,' said she, with her head\nthe least thing on one side, and an arch smile.\n\nI felt myself blushing--cheeks, forehead, even down to the tips of my\nfingers. I anticipated the name I was to hear. She looked very much amused.\nWas it possible that Captain Oakley was married?\n\n'I really have not the least idea,' I replied, with that kind of overdone\ncarelessness which betrays us.\n\n'No, I see quite plainly you have not; but you can't think how prettily you\nblush,' answered she, very much diverted.\n\n'I really don't care,' I replied, with some little dignity, and blushing\ndeeper and deeper.\n\n'Will you make a guess?' she asked.\n\n'I _can't_ guess.'\n\n'Well, shall I tell you?'\n\n'Just as you please.'\n\n'Well, I will--that is, I'll read a page of my letter, which tells it all.\nDo you know Georgina Fanshawe?' she asked.\n\n'Lady Georgina? No.'\n\n'Well, no matter; she's in Paris now, and this letter is from her, and\nshe says--let me see the place--\"Yesterday, what do you think?--quite an\napparition!--you shall hear. My brother Craven yesterday insisted on my\naccompanying him to Le Bas' shop in that odd little antique street near the\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve; it is a wonderful old curiosity shop. I forget what they call them\nhere. When we went into this place it was very nearly deserted, and there\nwere so many curious things to look at all about, that for a minute or two\nI did not observe a tall woman, in a grey silk and a black velvet mantle,\nand quite a nice new Parisian bonnet. You will be _charmed_, by-the-by,\nwith the new shape--it is only out three weeks, and is quite\n_indescribably_ elegant, _I_ think, at least. They have them, I am sure, by\nthis time at Molnitz's, so I need say no more. And now that I am on this\nsubject of dress, I have got your lace; and I think you will be very\nungrateful if you are not _charmed_ with it.\" Well, I need not read all\nthat--here is the rest;' and she read--\n\n'\"But you'll ask about my mysterious _dame_ in the new bonnet and velvet\nmantle; she was sitting on a stool at the counter, not buying, but\nevidently selling a quantity of stones and trinkets which she had in a\ncard-box, and the man was picking them up one by one, and, I suppose,\nvaluing them. I was near enough to see such a darling little pearl cross,\nwith at least half a dozen really good pearls in it, and had begun to covet\nthem for my set, when the lady glanced over my shoulder, and she\nknew me--in fact, we knew one another--and who do you think she was?\nWell--you'll not guess in a week, and I can't wait so long; so I may as\nwell tell you at once--she was that horrid old Mademoiselle Blassemare whom\nyou pointed out to me at Elverston; and I never forgot her face since--nor\nshe, it seems, mine, for she turned away very quickly, and when I next saw\nher, her veil was down.\"'\n\n'Did not you tell me, Maud, that you had lost your pearl cross while that\ndreadful Madame de la Rougierre was here?'\n\n'Yes; but--'\n\n'I know; but what has she to do with Mademoiselle de Blassemare, you were\ngoing to say--they are one and the same person.'\n\n'Oh, I perceive,' answered I, with that dim sense of danger and dismay with\nwhich one hears suddenly of an enemy of whom one has lost sight for a time.\n\n'I'll write and tell Georgie to buy that cross. I wager my life it is\nyours,' said Lady Knollys, firmly.\n\nThe servants, indeed, made no secret of their opinion of Madame de la\nRougierre, and frankly charged her with a long list of larcenies. Even Anne\nWixted, who had enjoyed her barren favour while the gouvernante was here,\nhinted privately that she had bartered a missing piece of lace belonging to\nme with a gipsy pedlar, for French gloves and an Irish poplin.\n\n'And so surely as I find it is yours, I'll set the police in pursuit.'\n\n'But you must not bring me into court,' said I, half amused and half\nalarmed.\n\n'No occasion, my dear; Mary Quince and Mrs. Rusk can prove it perfectly.'\n\n'And why do you dislike her so very much?' I asked.\n\nCousin Monica leaned back in her chair, and searched the cornice from\ncorner to corner with upturned eyes for the reason, and at last laughed a\nlittle, amused at herself.\n\n'Well, really, it is not easy to define, and, perhaps, it is not quite\ncharitable; but I know I hate her, and I know, you little hypocrite, you\nhate her as much as I;' and we both laughed a little.\n\n'But you must tell me all you know of her history.'\n\n'Her history?' echoed she. 'I really know next to nothing about it; only\nthat I used to see her sometimes about the place that Georgina mentions,\nand there were some unpleasant things said about her; but you know they may\nbe all lies. The worst I _know_ of her is her treatment of you, and her\nrobbing the desk'--(Cousin Monica always called it her _robbery_)--'and I\nthink that's enough to hang her. Suppose we go out for a walk?'\n\nSo together we went, and I resumed about Madame; but no more could I\nextract--perhaps there was not much more to hear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n_ON THE ROAD_\n\n\nAll at Knowl was indicative of the break-up that was so near at hand.\nDoctor Bryerly arrived according to promise. He was in a whirl of business\nall the time. He and Mr. Danvers conferred about the management of the\nestate. It was agreed that the grounds and gardens should be let, but not\nthe house, of which Mrs. Rusk was to take the care. The gamekeeper remained\nin office, and some out-door servants. But the rest were to go, except Mary\nQuince, who was to accompany me to Bartram-Haugh as my maid.\n\n'Don't part with Quince,' said Lady Knollys, peremptorily 'they'll want\nyou, but _don't_.'\n\nShe kept harping on this point, and recurred to it half a dozen times every\nday.\n\n'They'll say, you know, that she is not fit for a lady's maid, as she\ncertainly is _not_, if it in the least signified in such a wilderness as\nBartram-Haugh; but she is attached, trustworthy, and honest; and those are\nqualities valuable everywhere, especially in a solitude. Don't allow them\nto get you a wicked young French milliner in her stead.'\n\nSometimes she said things that jarred unpleasantly on my nerves, and left\nan undefined sense of danger. Such as:--\n\n'I know she's true to you, and a good creature; but is she shrewd enough?'\n\nOr, with an anxious look:--\n\n'I hope Mary Quince is not easily frightened.'\n\nOr, suddenly:--\n\n'Can Mary Quince write, in case you were ill?'\n\nOr,\n\n'Can she take a message exactly?'\n\nOr,\n\n'Is she a person of any enterprise and resource, and cool in an emergency?'\n\nNow, these questions did not come all in a string, as I write them down\nhere, but at long intervals, and were followed quickly by ordinary talk;\nbut they generally escaped from my companion after silence and gloomy\nthought; and though I could extract nothing more defined than these\nquestions, yet they seemed to me to point at some possible danger\ncontemplated in my good cousin's dismal ruminations.\n\nAnother topic that occupied my cousin's mind a good deal was obviously the\nlarceny of my pearl cross. She made a note of the description furnished by\nthe recollection, respectively, of Mary Quince, Mrs. Rusk, and myself. I\nhad fancied her little vision of the police was no more than the result of\na momentary impulse; but really, to judge by her methodical examinations of\nus, I should have fancied that she had taken it up in downright earnest.\n\nHaving learned that my departure from Knowl was to be so very soon, she\nresolved not to leave me before the day of my journey to Bartram-Haugh; and\nas day after day passed by, and the hour of our leave-taking approached,\nshe became more and more kind and affectionate. A feverish and sorrowful\ninterval it was to me.\n\nOf Doctor Bryerly, though staying in the house, we saw almost nothing,\nexcept for an hour or so at tea-time. He breakfasted very early, and dined\nsolitarily, and at uncertain hours, as business permitted.\n\nThe second evening of his visit, Cousin Monica took occasion to introduce\nthe subject of his visit to Bartram-Haugh.\n\n'You saw him, of course?' said Lady Knollys.\n\n'Yes, he saw me; he was not well. On hearing who I was, he asked me to go\nto his room, where he sat in a silk dressing-gown and slippers.'\n\n'About business principally,' said Cousin Monica, laconically.\n\n'That was despatched in very few words; for he was quite resolved, and\nplaced his refusal upon grounds which it was difficult to dispute. But\ndifficult or no, mind you, he intimated that he would hear nothing more on\nthe subject--so that was closed.'\n\n'Well; and what is his religion now?' inquired she, irreverently.\n\n'We had some interesting conversation on the subject. He leans much to what\nwe call the doctrine of correspondents. He is read rather deeply in the\nwritings of Swedenborg, and seemed anxious to discuss some points with one\nwho professes to be his follower. To say truth, I did not expect to find\nhim either so well read or so deeply interested in the subject.'\n\n'Was he angry when it was proposed that he should vacate the guardianship?'\n\n'Not at all. Contrariwise, he said he had at first been so minded himself.\nHis years, his habits, and something of the unfitness of the situation, the\nremoteness of Bartram-Haugh from good teachers, and all that, had struck\nhim, and nearly determined him against accepting the office. But then came\nthe views which I stated in my letter, and they governed him; and nothing\ncould shake them, he said, or induce him to re-open the question in his own\nmind.'\n\nAll the time Doctor Bryerly was relating his conference with the head of\nthe family at Bartram-Haugh my cousin commented on the narrative with a\nvariety of little 'pishes' and sneers, which I thought showed more of\nvexation than contempt.\n\nI was glad to hear all that Doctor Bryerly related. It gave me a kind\nof confidence; and I experienced a momentary reaction. After all, could\nBartram-Haugh be more lonely than I had found Knowl? Was I not sure of the\nsociety of my Cousin Millicent, who was about my own age? Was it not quite\npossible that my sojourn in Derbyshire might turn out a happy though very\nquiet remembrance through all my after-life? Why should it not? What time\nor place would be happy if we gave ourselves over to dismal imaginations?\n\nSo the summons reached me from Uncle Silas. The hours at Knowl were\nnumbered.\n\nThe evening before I departed I visited the full-length portrait of Uncle\nSilas, and studied it for the last time carefully, with deep interest, for\nmany minutes; but with results vaguer than ever.\n\nWith a brother so generous and so wealthy, always ready to help him\nforward; with his talents; with his lithe and gorgeous beauty, the shadow\nof which hung on that canvas--what might he not have accomplished? whom\nmight he not have captivated? And yet where and what was he? A poor and\nshunned old man, occupying a lonely house and place that did not belong to\nhim, married to degradation, with a few years of suspected and solitary\nlife before him, and then swift oblivion his best portion.\n\nI gazed on the picture, to fix it well and vividly in my remembrance. I\nmight still trace some of its outlines and tints in its living original,\nwhom I was next day to see for the first time in my life.\n\nSo the morning came--my last for many a day at Knowl--a day of partings, a\nday of novelty and regrets. The travelling carriage and post horses were\nat the door. Cousin Monica's carriage had just carried her away to the\nrailway. We had embraced with tears; and her kind face was still before me,\nand her words of comfort and promise in my ears. The early sharpness\nof morning was still in the air; the frosty dew still glistened on the\nwindow-panes. We had made a hasty breakfast, my share of which was a single\ncup of tea. The aspect of the house how strange! Uncarpeted, uninhabited,\ndoors for the most part locked, all the servants but Mrs. Rusk and Branston\ndeparted. The drawing-room door stood open, and a charwoman was washing the\nbare floor. I was looking my last--for who could say how long?--on the old\nhouse, and lingered. The luggage was all up. I made Mary Quince get in\nfirst, for every delay was precious; and now the moment was come. I hugged\nand kissed Mrs. Rusk in the hall.\n\n'God bless you, Miss Maud, darling. You must not fret; mind, the time won't\nbe long going over--_no_ time at all; and you'll be bringing back a fine\nyoung gentleman--who knows? as great as the Duke of Wellington, for your\nhusband; and I'll take the best of care of everything, and the birds and\nthe dogs, till you come back; and I'll go and see you and Mary, if you'll\nallow, in Derbyshire;' and so forth.\n\nI got into the carriage, and bid Branston, who shut the door, good-bye,\nand kissed hands to Mrs. Rusk, who was smiling and drying her eyes and\ncourtesying on the hall-door steps. The dogs, who had started gleefully\nwith the carriage, were called back by Branston, and driven home, wondering\nand wistful, looking back with ears oddly cocked and tails dejected. My\nheart thanked them for their kindness, and I felt like a stranger, and very\ndesolate.\n\nIt was a bright, clear morning. It had been settled that it was not\nworth the trouble changing from the carriage to the railway for sake of\nfive-and-twenty miles, and so the entire journey of sixty miles was to be\nmade by the post road--the pleasantest travelling, if the mind were free.\nThe grander and more distant features of the landscape we may see well\nenough from the window of the railway-carriage; but it is the foreground\nthat interests and instructs us, like a pleasant gossiping history; and\n_that_ we had, in old days, from the post-chaise window. It was more\nthan travelling picquet. Something of all conditions of life--luxury\nand misery--high spirits and low;--all sorts of costume, livery, rags,\nmillinery; faces buxom, faces wrinkled, faces kind, faces wicked;--no end\nof interest and suggestion, passing in a procession silent and vivid, and\nall in their proper scenery. The golden corn-sheafs--the old dark-alleyed\norchards, and the high streets of antique towns. There were few dreams\nbrighter, few books so pleasant.\n\nWe drove by the dark wood--it always looked dark to me--where the\n'mausoleum' stands--where my dear parents both lay now. I gazed on its\nsombre masses not with a softened feeling, but a peculiar sense of pain,\nand was glad when it was quite past.\n\nAll the morning I had not shed a tear. Good Mary Quince cried at leaving\nKnowl; Lady Knollys' eyes were not dry as she kissed and blessed me,\nand promised an early visit; and the dark, lean, energetic face of the\nhousekeeper was quivering, and her cheeks wet, as I drove away. But I,\nwhose grief was sorest, never shed a tear. I only looked about from one\nfamiliar object to another, pale, excited, not quite apprehending my\ndeparture, and wondering at my own composure.\n\nBut when we reached the old bridge, with the tall osiers standing by the\nbuttress, and looked back at poor Knowl--the places we love and are leaving\nlook so fairy-like and so sad in the clear distance, and this is the finest\nview of the gabled old house, with its slanting meadow-lands and noble\ntimber reposing in solemn groups--I gazed at the receding vision, and the\ntears came at last, and I wept in silence long after the fair picture was\nhidden from view by the intervening uplands.\n\nI was relieved, and when we had made our next change of horses, and got\ninto a country that was unknown to me, the new scenery and the sense of\nprogress worked their accustomed effects on a young traveller who had lived\na particularly secluded life, and I began to experience, on the whole, a\nnot unpleasurable excitement.\n\nMary Quince and I, with the hopefulness of inexperienced travellers, began\nalready to speculate about our proximity to Bartram-Haugh, and were sorely\ndisappointed when we heard from the nondescript courier--more like a\nostler than a servant, who sat behind in charge of us and the luggage, and\nrepresented my guardian's special care--at nearly one o'clock, that we had\nstill forty miles to go, a considerable portion of which was across the\nhigh Derbyshire mountains, before we reached Bartram-Haugh.\n\nThe fact was, we had driven at a pace accommodated rather to the\nconvenience of the horses than to our impatience; and finding, at the\nquaint little inn where we now halted, that we must wait for a nail or two\nin a loose shoe of one of our relay, we consulted, and being both hungry,\nagreed to beguile the time with an early dinner, which we enjoyed very\nsociably in a queer little parlour with a bow window, and commanding, with\na little garden for foreground, a very pretty landscape.\n\nGood Mary Quince, like myself, had quite dried her tears by this time, and\nwe were both highly interested, and I a little nervous, too, about our\narrival and reception at Bartram. Some time, of course, was lost in this\npleasant little parlour, before we found ourselves once more pursuing our\nway.\n\nThe slowest part of our journey was the pull up the long mountain road,\nascending zig-zag, as sailors make way against a head-wind, by tacking. I\nforget the name of the pretty little group of houses--it did not amount\nto a village--buried in trees, where we got our _four_ horses and two\npostilions, for the work was severe. I can only designate it as the place\nwhere Mary Quince and I had our tea, very comfortably, and bought some\ngingerbread, very curious to look upon, but quite uneatable.\n\nThe greater portion of the ascent, when we were fairly upon the mountain,\nwas accomplished at a walk, and at some particularly steep points we had to\nget out and go on foot. But this to me was quite delightful. I had never\nscaled a mountain before, and the ferns and heath, the pure boisterous air,\nand above all the magnificent view of the rich country we were leaving\nbehind, now gorgeous and misty in sunset tints, stretching in gentle\nundulations far beneath us, quite enchanted me.\n\nWe had just reached the summit when the sun went down. The low grounds at\nthe other side were already lying in cold grey shadow, and I got the man\nwho sat behind to point out as well as he could the site of Bartram-Haugh.\nBut mist was gathering over all by this time. The filmy disk of the moon\nwhich was to light us on, so soon as twilight faded into night, hung high\nin air. I tried to see the sable mass of wood which he described. But it\nwas vain, and to acquire a clear idea of the place, as of its master, I\nmust only wait that nearer view which an hour or two more would afford me.\n\nAnd now we rapidly descended the mountain side. The scenery was wilder\nand bolder than I was accustomed to. Our road skirted the edge of a great\nheathy moor. The silvery light of the moon began to glimmer, and we passed\na gipsy bivouac with fires alight and caldrons hanging over them. It was\nthe first I had seen. Two or three low tents; a couple of dark, withered\ncrones, veritable witches; a graceful girl standing behind, gazing after\nus; and men in odd-shaped hats, with gaudy waistcoats and bright-coloured\nneck-handkerchiefs and gaitered legs, stood lazily in front. They had all\na wild tawdry display of colour; and a group of alders in the rear made a\nbackground of shade for tents, fires, and figures.\n\nI opened a front window of the chariot, and called to the postboys to stop.\nThe groom from behind came to the window.\n\n'Are not those gipsies?' I enquired.\n\n'Yes, please'm, them's gipsies, sure, Miss,' he answered, glancing with\nthat odd smile, half contemptuous, half superstitious, with which I have\nsince often observed the peasants of Derbyshire eyeing those thievish and\nuncanny neighbours.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n_BARTRAM-HAUGH_\n\n\nIn a moment a tall, lithe girl, black-haired, black-eyed, and, as I\nthought, inexpressibly handsome, was smiling, with such beautiful rings of\npearly teeth, at the window; and in her peculiar accent, with a suspicion\nof something foreign in it, proposing with many courtesies to tell the lady\nher fortune.\n\nI had never seen this wild tribe of the human race before--children of\nmystery and liberty. Such vagabondism and beauty in the figure before me!\nI looked at their hovels and thought of the night, and wondered at their\nindependence, and felt my inferiority. I could not resist. She held up her\nslim oriental hand.\n\n'Yes, I'll hear my fortune,' I said, returning the sibyl's smile\ninstinctively.\n\n'Give me some money, Mary Quince. No, _not_ that,' I said, rejecting the\nthrifty sixpence she tendered, for I had heard that the revelations of\nthis weird sisterhood were bright in proportion to the kindness of their\nclients, and was resolved to approach Bartram with cheerful auguries. 'That\nfive-shilling piece,' I insisted; and honest Mary reluctantly surrendered\nthe coin.\n\nSo the feline beauty took it, with courtesies and 'thankees,' smiling\nstill, and hid it away as if she stole it, and looked on my open palm still\nsmiling; and told me, to my surprise, that there was _somebody_ I liked\nvery much, and I was almost afraid she would name Captain Oakley; that he\nwould grow very rich, and that I should marry him; that I should move about\nfrom place to place a great deal for a good while to come. That I had some\nenemies, who should be sometimes so near as to be in the same room with me,\nand yet they should not be able to hurt me. That I should see blood spilt\nand yet not my own, and finally be very happy and splendid, like the\nheroine of a fairy tale.\n\nDid this strange, girlish charlatan see in my face some signs of shrinking\nwhen she spoke of enemies, and set me down for a coward whose weakness\nmight be profitable? Very likely. At all events she plucked a long brass\npin, with a round bead for a head, from some part of her dress, and holding\nthe point in her fingers, and exhibiting the treasure before my eyes, she\ntold me that I must get a charmed pin like that, which her grandmother had\ngiven to her, and she ran glibly through a story of all the magic expended\non it, and told me she could not part with it; but its virtue was that you\nwere to stick it through the blanket, and while it was there neither rat,\nnor cat, nor snake--and then came two more terms in the catalogue, which I\nsuppose belonged to the gipsy dialect, and which she explained to mean, as\nwell as I could understand, the first a malevolent spirit, and the second\n'a cove to cut your throat,' could approach or hurt you.\n\nA charm like that, she gave me to understand, I must by hook or by crook\nobtain. She had not a second. None of her people in the camp over there\npossessed one. I am ashamed to confess that I actually paid her a pound for\nthis brass pin! The purchase was partly an indication of my temperament,\nwhich could never let an opportunity pass away irrevocably without a\nstruggle, and always apprehended 'Some day or other I'll reproach myself\nfor having neglected it!' and partly a record of the trepidations of that\nperiod of my life. At all events I had her pin, and she my pound, and I\nventure to say I was the gladder of the two.\n\nShe stood on the road-side bank courtseying and smiling, the first\nenchantress I had encountered, and I watched the receding picture, with its\npatches of firelight, its dusky groups and donkey carts, white as skeletons\nin the moonlight, as we drove rapidly away.\n\nThey, I suppose, had a wild sneer and a merry laugh over my purchase, as\nthey sat and ate their supper of stolen poultry, about their fire, and were\nduly proud of belonging to the superior race.\n\nMary Quince, shocked at my prodigality, hinted a remonstrance.\n\n'It went to my heart, Miss, it did. They're such a lot, young and old, all\nalike thieves and vagabonds, and many a poor body wanting.'\n\n'Tut, Mary, never mind. Everyone has her fortune told some time in her\nlife, and you can't have a good one without paying. I think, Mary, we must\nbe near Bartram now.'\n\nThe road now traversed the side of a steep hill, parallel to which,\nalong the opposite side of a winding river, rose the dark steeps of a\ncorresponding upland, covered with forest that looked awful and dim in the\ndeep shadow, while the moonlight rippled fitfully upon the stream beneath.\n\n'It seems to be a beautiful country,' I said to Mary Quince, who was\nmunching a sandwich in the corner, and thus appealed to, adjusted her\nbonnet, and made an inspection from _her_ window, which, however, commanded\nnothing but the heathy slope of the hill whose side we were traversing.\n\n'Well, Miss, I suppose it is; but there's a deal o' mountains--is not\nthere?'\n\nAnd so saying, honest Mary leaned back again, and went on with her\nsandwich.\n\nWe were now descending at a great pace. I knew we were coming near. I stood\nup as well as I could in the carriage, to see over the postilions' heads.\nI was eager, but frightened too; agitated as the crisis of the arrival and\nmeeting approached. At last, a long stretch of comparatively level\ncountry below us, with masses of wood as well as I could see irregularly\noverspreading it, became visible as the narrow valley through which we were\nspeeding made a sudden bend.\n\nDown we drove, and now I did perceive a change. A great grass-grown\npark-wall, overtopped with mighty trees; but still on and on we came at a\ncanter that seemed almost a gallop. The old grey park-wall flanking us at\none side, and a pretty pastoral hedgerow of ash-trees, irregularly on the\nother.\n\nAt last the postilions began to draw bridle, and at a slight angle, the\nmoon shining full upon them, we wheeled into a wide semicircle formed by\nthe receding park-walls, and halted before a great fantastic iron gate, and\na pair of tall fluted piers, of white stone, all grass-grown and ivy-bound,\nwith great cornices, surmounted with shields and supporters, the Ruthyn\nbearings washed by the rains of Derbyshire for many a generation of\nRuthyns, almost smooth by this time, and looking bleached and phantasmal,\nlike giant sentinels, with each a hand clasped in his comrade's, to bar\nour passage to the enchanted castle--the florid tracery of the iron gate\nshowing like the draperies of white robes hanging from their extended arms\nto the earth.\n\nOur courier got down and shoved the great gate open, and we entered,\nbetween sombre files of magnificent forest trees, one of those very broad\nstraight avenues whose width measures the front of the house. This was all\nbuilt of white stone, resembling that of Caen, which parts of Derbyshire\nproduce in such abundance.\n\nSo this was Bartram, and here was Uncle Silas. I was almost breathless as\nI approached. The bright moon shining full on the white front of the old\nhouse revealed not only its highly decorated style, its fluted pillars and\ndoorway, rich and florid carving, and balustraded summit, but also its\nstained and moss-grown front. Two giant trees, overthrown at last by the\nrecent storm, lay with their upturned roots, and their yellow foliage still\nflickering on the sprays that were to bloom no more, where they had fallen,\nat the right side of the court-yard, which, like the avenue, was studded\nwith tufted weeds and grass.\n\nAll this gave to the aspect of Bartram a forlorn character of desertion and\ndecay, contrasting almost awfully with the grandeur of its proportions and\nrichness of its architecture.\n\nThere was a ruddy glow from a broad window in the second row, and I thought\nI saw some one peep from it and disappear; at the same moment there was a\nfurious barking of dogs, some of whom ran scampering into the court-yard\nfrom a half-closed side door; and amid their uproar, the bawling of the man\nin the back seat, who jumped down to drive them off, and the crack of\nthe postilions' whips, who struck at them, we drew up before the lordly\ndoor-steps of this melancholy mansion.\n\nJust as our attendant had his hand on the knocker the door opened, and we\nsaw, by a not very brilliant candle-light, three figures--a shabby little\nold man, thin, and very much stooped, with a white cravat, and looking as\nif his black clothes were too large, and made for some one else, stood with\nhis hand upon the door; a young, plump, but very pretty female figure, in\nunusually short petticoats, with fattish legs, and nice ankles, in boots,\nstood in the centre; and a dowdy maid, like an old charwoman, behind her.\n\nThe household paraded for welcome was not certainly very brilliant. Amid\nthe riot the trunks were deliberately put down by our attendant, who kept\nshouting to the old man at the door, and to the dogs in turn; and the old\nman was talking and pointing stiffly and tremulously, but I could not hear\nwhat he said.\n\n'Was it possible--could that mean-looking old man be Uncle Silas?'\n\nThe idea stunned me; but I almost instantly perceived that he was much too\nsmall, and I was relieved, and even grateful. It was certainly an odd mode\nof procedure to devote primary attention to the trunks and boxes, leaving\nthe travellers still shut up in the carriage, of which they were by this\ntime pretty well tired. I was not sorry for the reprieve, however: being\nnervous about first impressions, and willing to defer mine, I sat shyly\nback, peeping at the candle and moonlight picture before me, myself unseen.\n\n'Will you tell--yes or no--is my cousin in the coach?' screamed the plump\nyoung lady, stamping her stout black boot, in a momentary lull.\n\nYes, I was there, sure.\n\n'And why the puck don't you let her out, you stupe, you?'\n\n'Run down, Giblets, you never do nout without driving, and let Cousin Maud\nout. You're very welcome to Bartram.' This greeting was screamed at an\namazing pitch, and repeated before I had time to drop the window, and say\n'thank you.' 'I'd a let you out myself--there's a good dog, you would na'\nbite Cousin' (the parenthesis was to a huge mastiff, who thrust himself\nbeside her, by this time quite pacified)--'only I daren't go down the\nsteps, for the governor said I shouldn't.'\n\nThe venerable person who went by the name of Giblets had by this time\nopened the carriage door, and our courier, or 'boots'--he looked more like\nthe latter functionary--had lowered the steps, and in greater trepidation\nthan I experienced when in after-days I was presented to my sovereign,\nI glided down, to offer myself to the greeting and inspection of the\nplain-spoken young lady who stood at the top of the steps to receive me.\n\nShe welcomed me with a hug and a hearty buss, as she called that\nsalutation, on each cheek, and pulled me into the hall, and was evidently\nglad to see me.\n\n'And you're tired a bit, I warrant; and who's the old 'un, who?' she asked\neagerly, in a stage whisper, which made my ear numb for five minutes after.\n'Oh, oh, the maid! and a precious old 'un--ha, ha, ha! But lawk! how grand\nshe is, with her black silk, cloak and crape, and I only in twilled cotton,\nand rotten old Coburg for Sundays. Odds! it's a shame; but you'll be tired,\nyou will. It's a smartish pull, they do say, from Knowl. I know a spell of\nit, only so far as the \"Cat and Fiddle,\" near the Lunnon-road. Come up,\nwill you? Would you like to come in first and talk a bit wi' the governor?\nFather, you know, he's a bit silly, he is, this while.' I found that\nthe phrase meant only _bodily_ infirmity. 'He took a pain o' Friday,\nnewralgie--something or other he calls it--rheumatics it is when it takes\nold \"Giblets\" there; and he's sitting in his own room; or maybe you'd like\nbetter to come to your bedroom first, for it is dirty work travelling, they\ndo say.'\n\nYes; I preferred the preliminary adjustment. Mary Quince was standing\nbehind me; and as my voluble kinswoman talked on, we had each ample time\nand opportunity to observe the personnel of the other; and she made no\nscruple of letting me perceive that she was improving it, for she stared me\nfull in the face, taking in evidently feature after feature; and she felt\nthe material of my mantle pretty carefully between her finger and thumb,\nand manually examined my chain and trinkets, and picked up my hand as she\nmight a glove, to con over my rings.\n\nI can't say, of course, exactly what impression I may have produced on her.\nBut in my cousin Milly I saw a girl who looked younger than her years,\nplump, but with a slender waist, with light hair, lighter than mine, and\nvery blue eyes, rather round; on the whole very good-looking. She had an\nodd swaggering walk, a toss of her head, and a saucy and imperious, but\nrather good-natured and honest countenance. She talked rather loud, with a\ngood ringing voice, and a boisterous laugh when it came.\n\nIf _I_ was behind the fashion, what would Cousin Monica have thought of\nher? She was arrayed, as she had stated, in black twilled cotton expressive\nof her affliction; but it was made almost as short in the skirt as that of\nthe prints of the Bavarian broom girls. She had white cotton stockings,\nand a pair of black leather boots, with leather buttons, and, for a lady,\nprodigiously thick soles, which reminded me of the navvy boots I had so\noften admired in _Punch_. I must add that the hands with which she assisted\nher scrutiny of my dress, though pretty, were very much sunburnt indeed.\n\n'And what's _her_ name?' she demanded, nodding to Mary Quince, who was\ngazing on her awfully, with round eyes, as an inland spinster might upon a\nwhale beheld for the first time.\n\nMary courtesied, and I answered.\n\n'Mary Quince,' she repeated. 'You're welcome, Quince. What shall I call\nher? I've a name for all o' them. Old Giles there, is Giblets. He did not\nlike it first, but he answers quick enough now; and Old Lucy Wyat there,'\nnodding toward the old woman, 'is Lucia de l'Amour.' A slightly erroneous\nreading of Lammermoor, for my cousin sometimes made mistakes, and was not\nmuch versed in the Italian opera. 'You know it's a play, and I call her\nL'Amour for shortness;' and she laughed hilariously, and I could not\nforbear joining; and, winking at me, she called aloud, 'L'Amour.'\n\nTo which the crone, with a high-cauled cap, resembling Mother Hubbard,\nresponded with a courtesy and 'Yes, 'm.'\n\n'Are all the trunks and boxes took up?'\n\nThey were.\n\n'Well, we'll come now; and what shall I call you, Quince? Let me see.'\n\n'According to your pleasure, Miss,' answered Mary, with dignity, and a dry\ncourtesy.\n\n'Why, you're as hoarse as a frog, Quince. We'll call you Quinzy for the\npresent. That'll do. Come along, Quinzy.'\n\nSo my Cousin Milly took me under the arm, and pulled me forward; but as we\nascended, she let me go, leaning back to make inspection of my attire from\na new point of view.\n\n'Hallo, cousin,' she cried, giving my dress a smack with her open hand.\n'What a plague do you want of all that bustle; you'll leave it behind,\nlass, the first bush you jump over.'\n\nI was a good deal astounded. I was also very near laughing, for there was\na sort of importance in her plump countenance, and an indescribable\ngrotesqueness in the fashion of her garments, which heightened the\noutlandishness of her talk, in a way which I cannot at all describe.\n\nWhat palatial wide stairs those were which we ascended, with their\nprodigious carved banisters of oak, and each huge pillar on the\nlanding-place crowned with a shield and carved heraldic supporters; florid\noak panelling covered the walls. But of the house I could form no estimate,\nfor Uncle Silas's housekeeping did not provide light for hall and passages,\nand we were dependent on the glimmer of a single candle; but there would be\nquite enough of this kind of exploration in the daylight.\n\nSo along dark oak flooring we advanced to my room, and I had now an\nopportunity of admiring, at my leisure, the lordly proportions of the\nbuilding. Two great windows, with dark and tarnished curtains, rose half as\nhigh again as the windows of Knowl; and yet Knowl, in its own style, is a\nfine house. The door-frames, like the window-frames, were richly carved;\nthe fireplace was in the same massive style, and the mantelpiece projected\nwith a mass of very rich carving. On the whole I was surprised. I had never\nslept in so noble a room before.\n\nThe furniture, I must confess, was by no means on a par with the\narchitectural pretensions of the apartment. A French bed, a piece of carpet\nabout three yards square, a small table, two chairs, a toilet table--no\nwardrobe--no chest of drawers. The furniture painted white, and of the\nlight and diminutive kind, was particularly ill adapted to the scale and\nstyle of the apartment, one end only of which it occupied, and that but\nsparsely, leaving the rest of the chamber in the nakedness of a stately\ndesolation. My cousin Milly ran away to report progress to 'the Governor,'\nas she termed Uncle Silas.\n\n'Well, Miss Maud, I never did expect to see the like o' that!' exclaimed\nhonest Mary Quince, 'Did you ever see such a young lady? She's no more like\none o' the family than I am. Law bless us! and what's she dressed like?\nWell, well, well!' And Mary, with a rueful shake of her head, clicked her\ntongue pathetically to the back of her teeth, while I could not forbear\nlaughing.\n\n'And such a scrap o' furniture! Well, well, well!' and the same ticking of\nthe tongue followed.\n\nBut, in a few minutes, back came Cousin Milly, and, with a barbarous\nsort of curiosity, assisted in unpacking my trunks, and stowing away the\ntreasures, on which she ventured a variety of admiring criticisms, in the\npresses which, like cupboards, filled recesses in the walls, with great oak\ndoors, the keys of which were in them.\n\nAs I was making my hurried toilet, she entertained me now and then with\nmore strictly personal criticisms.\n\n'Your hair's a shade darker than mine--it's none the better o' that\nthough--is it? Mine's said to be the right shade. I don't know--what do you\nsay?'\n\nI conceded the point with a good grace.\n\n'I wish my hands was as white though--you do lick me there; but it's all\ngloves, and I never could abide 'em. I think I'll try though--they _are_\nvery white, sure.'\n\n'I wonder which is the prettiest, you or me? _I_ don't know, _I_'m\nsure--which do _you_ think?'\n\nI laughed outright at this challenge, and she blushed a little, and for the\nfirst time seemed for a moment a little shy.\n\n'Well, you _are_ a half an inch longer than me, I think--don't you?'\n\nI was fully an inch taller, so I had no difficulty in making the proposed\nadmission.\n\n'Well, you do look handsome! doesn't she, Quinzy, lass? but your frock\ncomes down almost to your heels--it does.'\n\nAnd she glanced from mine to hers, and made a little kick up with the heel\nof the navvy boot to assist her in measuring the comparative distance.\n\n'Maybe mine's a thought too short?' she suggested. 'Who's there? Oh! it's\nyou, is it?' she cried as Mother Hubbard appeared at the door. 'Come in,\nL'Amour--don't you know, lass, you're always welcome?'\n\nShe had come to let us know that Uncle Silas would be happy to see me\nwhenever I was ready; and that my cousin Millicent would conduct me to the\nroom where he awaited me.\n\nIn an instant all the comic sensations awakened by my singular cousin's\neccentricities vanished, and I was thrilled with awe. I was about to see\nin the flesh--faded, broken, aged, but still identical--that being who had\nbeen the vision and the problem of so many years of my short life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n_UNCLE SILAS_\n\n\nI thought my odd cousin was also impressed with a kind of awe, though\ndifferent in degree from mine, for a shade overcast her face, and she was\nsilent as we walked side by side along the gallery, accompanied by the\ncrone who carried the candle which lighted us to the door of that apartment\nwhich I may call Uncle Silas's presence chamber.\n\nMilly whispered to me as we approached--\n\n'Mind how you make a noise; the governor's as sharp as a weasel, and\nnothing vexes him like that.'\n\nShe was herself toppling along on tiptoe. We paused at a door near the head\nof the great staircase, and L'Amour knocked timidly with her rheumatic\nknuckles.\n\nA voice, clear and penetrating, from within summoned us to enter. The old\nwoman opened the door, and the next moment I was in the presence of Uncle\nSilas.\n\nAt the far end of a handsome wainscoted room, near the hearth in which a\nlow fire was burning, beside a small table on which stood four waxlights,\nin tall silver candlesticks, sat a singular-looking old man.\n\nThe dark wainscoting behind him, and the vastness of the room, in the\nremoter parts of which the light which fell strongly upon his face and\nfigure expended itself with hardly any effect, exhibited him with the\nforcible and strange relief of a finely painted Dutch portrait. For some\ntime I saw nothing but him.\n\nA face like marble, with a fearful monumental look, and, for an old man,\nsingularly vivid strange eyes, the singularity of which rather grew upon me\nas I looked; for his eyebrows were still black, though his hair descended\nfrom his temples in long locks of the purest silver and fine as silk,\nnearly to his shoulders.\n\nHe rose, tall and slight, a little stooped, all in black, with an ample\nblack velvet tunic, which was rather a gown than a coat, with loose\nsleeves, showing his snowy shirt some way up the arm, and a pair of wrist\nbuttons, then quite out of fashion, which glimmered aristocratically with\ndiamonds.\n\nI know I can't convey in words an idea of this apparition, drawn as it\nseemed in black and white, venerable, bloodless, fiery-eyed, with its\nsingular look of power, and an expression so bewildering--was it derision,\nor anguish, or cruelty, or patience?\n\nThe wild eyes of this strange old man were fixed upon me as he rose; an\nhabitual contraction, which in certain lights took the character of a\nscowl, did not relax as he advanced toward me with his thin-lipped smile.\nHe said something in his clear, gentle, but cold voice, the import of\nwhich I was too much agitated to catch, and he took both my hands in his,\nwelcomed me with a courtly grace which belonged to another age, and led me\naffectionately, with many inquiries which I only half comprehended, to a\nchair near his own.\n\n'I need not introduce my daughter; she has saved me that mortification.\nYou'll find her, I believe, good-natured and affectionate; _au reste_, I\nfear a very rustic Miranda, and fitted rather for the society of Caliban\nthan of a sick old Prospero. Is it not so, Millicent?'\n\nThe old man paused sarcastically for an answer, with his eyes fixed\nseverely on my odd cousin, who blushed and looked uneasily to me for a\nhint.\n\n'I don't know who they be--neither one nor t'other.'\n\n'Very good, my dear,' he replied, with a little mocking bow. 'You see, my\ndear Maud, what a Shakespearean you have got for a cousin. It's plain,\nhowever, she has made acquaintance with some of our dramatists: she has\nstudied the r\u00c3\u00b4le of _Miss Hoyden_ so perfectly.'\n\nIt was not a reasonable peculiarity of my uncle that he resented, with a\ngood deal of playful acrimony, my poor cousin's want of education, for\nwhich, if he were not to blame, certainly neither was she.\n\n'You see her, poor thing, a result of all the combined disadvantages of\nwant of refined education, refined companionship, and, I fear, naturally,\nof refined tastes; but a sojourn at a good French conventual school will\ndo wonders, and I hope to manage by-and-by. In the meantime we jest at our\nmisfortunes, and love one another, I hope, cordially.'\n\nHe extended his thin, white hand with a chilly smile towards Milly, who\nbounced up, and took it with a frightened look; and he repeated, holding\nher hand rather slightly I thought, 'Yes, I hope, very cordially,' and then\nturning again to me, he put it over the arm of his chair, and let it go, as\na man might drop something he did not want from a carriage window.\n\nHaving made this apology for poor Milly, who was plainly bewildered, he\npassed on, to her and my relief, to other topics, every now and then\nexpressing his fears that I was fatigued, and his anxiety that I should\npartake of some supper or tea; but these solicitudes somehow seemed to\nescape his remembrance almost as soon as uttered; and he maintained the\nconversation, which soon degenerated into a close, and to me a painful\nexamination, respecting my dear father's illness and its symptoms, upon\nwhich I could give no information, and his habits, upon which I could.\n\nPerhaps he fancied that there might be some family predisposition to the\norganic disease of which his brother died, and that his questions were\ndirected rather to the prolonging of his own life than to the better\nunderstanding of my dear father's death.\n\nHow little was there left to this old man to make life desirable, and yet\nhow keenly, I afterwards found, he clung to it. Have we not all of us seen\nthose to whom life was not only _undesirable_, but positively painful--a\nmere series of bodily torments, yet hold to it with a desperate and\npitiable tenacity--old children or young, it is all the same.\n\nSee how a sleepy child will put off the inevitable departure for bed. The\nlittle creature's eyes blink and stare, and it needs constant jogging to\nprevent his nodding off into the slumber which nature craves. His waking is\na pain; he is quite worn out, and peevish, and stupid, and yet he implores\na respite, and deprecates repose, and vows he is not sleepy, even to the\nmoment when his mother takes him in her arms, and carries him, in a sweet\nslumber, to the nursery. So it is with us old children of earth and the\ngreat sleep of death, and nature our kind mother. Just so reluctantly we\npart with consciousness, the picture is, even to the last, so interesting;\nthe bird in the hand, though sick and moulting, so inestimably better than\nall the brilliant tenants of the bush. We sit up, yawning, and blinking,\nand stupid, the whole scene swimming before us, and the stories and music\nhumming off into the sound of distant winds and waters. It is not time yet;\nwe are not fatigued; we are good for another hour still, and so protesting\nagainst bed, we falter and drop into the dreamless sleep which nature\nassigns to fatigue and satiety.\n\nHe then spoke a little eulogy of his brother, very polished, and,\nindeed, in a kind of way, eloquent. He possessed in a high degree that\naccomplishment, too little cultivated, I think, by the present generation,\nof expressing himself with perfect precision and fluency. There was, too,\na good deal of slight illustrative quotation, and a sprinkling of French\nflowers, over his conversation, which gave to it a character at once\nelegant and artificial. It was all easy, light, and pointed, and being\nquite new to me, had a wonderful fascination.\n\nHe then told me that Bartram was the temple of liberty, that the health of\na whole life was founded in a few years of youth, air, and exercise, and\nthat accomplishments, at least, if not education, should wait upon health.\nTherefore, while at Bartram, I should dispose of my time quite as I\npleased, and the more I plundered the garden and gipsied in the woodlands,\nthe better.\n\nThen he told me what a miserable invalid he was, and how the doctors\ninterfered with his frugal tastes. A glass of beer and a mutton chop--his\nideal of a dinner--he dared not touch. They made him drink light wines,\nwhich he detested, and live upon those artificial abominations all liking\nfor which vanishes with youth.\n\nThere stood on a side-table, in its silver coaster, a long-necked Rhenish\nbottle, and beside it a thin pink glass, and he quivered his fingers in a\npeevish way toward them.\n\nBut unless he found himself better very soon, he would take his case into\nhis own hands, and try the dietary to which nature pointed.\n\nHe waved his fingers toward his bookcases, and told me his books were\naltogether at my service during my stay; but this promise ended, I must\nconfess, disappointingly. At last, remarking that I must be fatigued, he\nrose, and kissed me with a solemn tenderness, placed his hand upon what I\nnow perceived to be a large Bible, with two broad silk markers, red and\ngold, folded in it--the one, I might conjecture, indicating the place in\nthe Old, the other in the New Testament. It stood on the small table that\nsupported the waxlights, with a handsome cut bottle of eau-de-cologne, his\ngold and jewelled pencil-case, and his chased repeater, chain, and seals,\nbeside it. There certainly were no indications of poverty in Uncle Silas's\nroom; and he said impressively--\n\n'Remember that book; in it your father placed his trust, in it he found his\nreward, in it lives my only hope; consult it, my beloved niece, day and\nnight, as the oracle of life.'\n\nThen he laid his thin hand on my head, and blessed me, and then kissed my\nforehead.\n\n'No--a!' exclaimed Cousin Milly's lusty voice. I had quite forgotten her\npresence, and looked at her with a little start. She was seated on a very\nhigh old-fashioned chair; she had palpably been asleep; her round eyes were\nblinking and staring glassily at us; and her white legs and navvy boots\nwere dangling in the air.\n\n'Have you anything to remark about Noah?' enquired her father, with a\npolite inclination and an ironical interest.\n\n'No--a,' she repeated in the same blunt accents; 'I didn't snore; did I?\nNo--a.'\n\nThe old man smiled and shrugged a little at me--it was the smile of\ndisgust.\n\n'Good night, my dear Maud;' and turning to her, he said, with a peculiar\ngentle sharpness, 'Had not you better wake, my dear, and try whether your\ncousin would like some supper?'\n\nSo he accompanied us to the door, outside which we found L'Amour's candle\nawaiting us.\n\n'I'm awful afraid of the Governor, I am. Did I snore that time?'\n\n'No, dear; at least, I did not hear it,' I said, unable to repress a smile.\n\n'Well, if I didn't, I was awful near it,' she said, reflectively.\n\nWe found poor Mary Quince dozing over the fire; but we soon had tea and\nother good things, of which Milly partook with a wonderful appetite.\n\n'I _was_ in a qualm about it,' said Milly, who by this time was quite\nherself again. 'When he spies me a-napping, maybe he don't fetch me a prod\nwith his pencil-case over the head. Odd! girl, it _is_ sore.'\n\nWhen I contrasted the refined and fluent old gentleman whom I had just\nleft, with this amazing specimen of young ladyhood, I grew sceptical almost\nas to the possibility of her being his child.\n\nI was to learn, however, how little she had, I won't say of his society,\nbut even of his presence--that she had no domestic companion of the least\npretensions to education--that she ran wild about the place--never, except\nin church, so much as saw a person of that rank to which she was born--and\nthat the little she knew of reading and writing had been picked up, in\ndesultory half-hours, from a person who did not care a pin about her\nmanners or decorum, and perhaps rather enjoyed her grotesqueness--and that\nno one who was willing to take the least trouble about her was competent\nto make her a particle more refined than I saw her--the wonder ceased. We\ndon't know how little is heritable, and how much simply training, until we\nencounter some-such spectacle as that of my poor cousin Milly.\n\nWhen I lay down in my bed and reviewed the day, it seemed like a month of\nwonders. Uncle Silas was always before me; the voice so silvery for an old\nman--so preternaturally soft; the manners so sweet, so gentle; the aspect,\nsmiling, suffering, spectral. It was no longer a shadow; I had now seen\nhim in the flesh. But, after all, was he more than a shadow to me? When I\nclosed my eyes I saw him before me still, in necromantic black, ashy with a\npallor on which I looked with fear and pain, a face so dazzlingly pale,\nand those hollow, fiery, awful eyes! It sometimes seemed as if the curtain\nopened, and I had seen a ghost.\n\nI had seen him; but he was still an enigma and a marvel. The living face\ndid not expound the past, any more than the portrait portended the future.\nHe was still a mystery and a vision; and thinking of these things I fell\nasleep.\n\nMary Quince, who slept in the dressing-room, the door of which was close\nto my bed, and lay open to secure me against ghosts, called me up; and the\nmoment I knew where I was I jumped up, and peeped eagerly from the window.\nIt commanded the avenue and court-yard; but we were many windows removed\nfrom that over the hall-door, and immediately beneath ours lay the two\ngiant lime trees, prostrate and uprooted, which I had observed as we drove\nup the night before.\n\nI saw more clearly in the bright light of morning the signs of neglect and\nalmost of dilapidation which had struck me as I approached. The court-yard\nwas tufted over with grass, seldom from year to year crushed by the\ncarriage-wheels, or trodden by the feet of visitors. This melancholy\nverdure thickened where the area was more remote from the centre; and under\nthe windows, and skirting the walls to the left, was reinforced by a thick\ngrove of nettles. The avenue was all grass-grown, except in the very\ncentre, where a narrow track still showed the roadway. The handsome carved\nbalustrade of the court-yard was discoloured with lichens, and in two\nplaces gapped and broken; and the air of decay was heightened by the fallen\ntrees, among whose sprays and yellow leaves the small birds were hopping.\n\nBefore my toilet was completed, in marched my cousin Milly. We were to\nbreakfast alone that morning, 'and so much the better,' she told me.\nSometimes the Governor ordered her to breakfast with him, and 'never left\noff chaffing her' till his newspaper came, and 'sometimes he said such\nthings he made her cry,' and then he only 'boshed her more,' and packed her\naway to her room; but she was by chalks nicer than him, talk as he might.\n'_Was_ not she nicer? was not she? was not she?' Upon this point she was so\nstrong and urgent that I was obliged to reply by a protest against awarding\nthe palm of elegance between parent and child, and declaring I liked her\nvery much, which I attested by a kiss.\n\n'I know right well which of us you do think's the nicest, and no mistake,\nonly you're afraid of him; and he had no business boshing me last night\nbefore you. I knew he was at it, though I couldn't twig him altogether; but\nwasn't he a sneak, now, wasn't he?'\n\nThis was a still more awkward question; so I kissed her again, and said she\nmust never ask me to say of my uncle in his absence anything I could not\nsay to his face.\n\nAt which speech she stared at me for a while, and then treated me to one of\nher hearty laughs, after which she seemed happier, and gradually grew into\nbetter humour with her father.\n\n'Sometimes, when the curate calls, he has me up--for he's as religious as\nsix, he is--and they read Bible and prays, ho--don't they? You'll have\nthat, lass, like me, to go through; and maybe I don't hate it; oh, no!'\n\nWe breakfasted in a small room, almost a closet, off the great parlour,\nwhich was evidently quite disused. Nothing could be homelier than our\nequipage, or more shabby than the furniture of the little apartment. Still,\nsomehow, I liked it. It was a total change; but one likes 'roughing it' a\nlittle at first.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n_THE WINDMILL WOOD_\n\n\nI had not time to explore this noble old house as my curiosity prompted;\nfor Milly was in such a fuss to set out for the 'blackberry dell' that I\nsaw little more than just so much as I necessarily traversed in making my\nway to and from my room.\n\nThe actual decay of the house had been prevented by my dear father; and\nthe roof, windows, masonry, and carpentry had all been kept in repair.\nBut short of indications of actual ruin, there are many manifestations of\npoverty and neglect which impress with a feeling of desolation. It was\nplain that not nearly a tithe of this great house was inhabited; long\ncorridors and galleries stretched away in dust and silence, and were\ncrossed by others, whose dark arches inspired me in the distance with an\nawful sort of sadness. It was plainly one of those great structures in\nwhich you might easily lose yourself, and with a pleasing terror it\nreminded me of that delightful old abbey in Mrs. Radcliffe's romance, among\nwhose silent staircases, dim passages, and long suites of lordly, but\nforsaken chambers, begirt without by the sombre forest, the family of La\nMote secured a gloomy asylum.\n\nMy cousin Milly and I, however, were bent upon an open-air ramble, and\ntraversing several passages, she conducted me to a door which led us out\nupon a terrace overgrown with weeds, and by a broad flight of steps we\ndescended to the level of the grounds beneath. Then on, over the short\ngrass, under the noble trees, we walked; Milly in high good-humour,\nand talking away volubly, in her short garment, navvy boots, and a\nweather-beaten hat. She carried a stick in her gloveless hand. Her\nconversation was quite new to me, and resembled very much what I would have\nfancied the holiday recollections of a schoolboy; and the language in which\nit was sustained was sometimes so outlandish, that I was forced to laugh\noutright--a demonstration which she plainly did not like.\n\nHer talk was about the great jumps she had made--how she snow-balled the\nchaps' in winter--how she could slide twice the length of her stick beyond\n'Briddles, the cow-boy.'\n\nWith this and similar conversation she entertained me.\n\nThe grounds were delightfully wild and neglected. But we had now passed\ninto a vast park beautifully varied with hollows and uplands, and such\nglorious old timber massed and scattered over its slopes and levels. Among\nthese, we got at last into a picturesque dingle; the grey rocks peeped from\namong the ferns and wild flowers, and the steps of soft sward along its\nsides were dark in the shadows of silver-stemmed birch, and russet thorn,\nand oak, under which, in the vaporous night, the Erl-king and his daughter\nmight glide on their a\u00c3\u00abrial horses.\n\nIn the lap of this pleasant dell were the finest blackberry bushes, I\nthink, I ever saw, bearing fruit quite fabulous; and plucking these, and\nchatting, we rambled on very pleasantly.\n\nI had first thought of Milly's absurdities, to which, in description, I\ncannot do justice, simply because so many details have, by distance\nof time, escaped my recollection. But her ways and her talk were so\nindescribably grotesque that she made me again and again quiver with\nsuppressed laughter.\n\nBut there was a pitiable and even a melancholy meaning underlying the\nburlesque.\n\nThis creature, with no more education than a dairy-maid, I gradually\ndiscovered had fine natural aptitudes for accomplishment--a very sweet\nvoice, and wonderfully delicate ear, and a talent for drawing which quite\nthrew mine into the shade. It was really astonishing.\n\nPoor Milly, in all her life, had never read three books, and hated to\nthink of them. One, over which she was wont to yawn and sigh, and stare\nfatiguedly for an hour every Sunday, by command of the Governor, was a\nstout volume of sermons of the earlier school of George III., and a drier\ncollection you can't fancy. I don't think she read anything else. But she\nhad, notwithstanding, ten times the cleverness of half the circulating\nlibrary misses one meets with. Besides all this, I had a long sojourn\nbefore me at Bartram-Haugh, and I had learned from Milly, as I had heard\nbefore, what a perennial solitude it was, with a ludicrous fear of learning\nMilly's preposterous dialect, and turning at last into something like her.\nSo I resolved to do all I could for her--teach her whatever I knew, if she\nwould allow me--and gradually, if possible, effect some civilising changes\nin her language, and, as they term it in boarding-schools, her demeanour.\n\nBut I must pursue at present our first day's ramble in what was called\nBartram Chase. People can't go on eating blackberries always; so after a\nwhile we resumed our walk along this pretty dell, which gradually expanded\ninto a wooded valley--level beneath and enclosed by irregular uplands,\nreceding, as it were, in mimic bays and harbours at some points, and\nrunning out at others into broken promontories, ending in clumps of forest\ntrees.\n\nJust where the glen which we had been traversing expanded into this broad,\nbut wooded valley, it was traversed by a high and close paling, which,\nalthough it looked decayed, was still very strong.\n\nIn this there was a wooden gate, rudely but strongly constructed, and at\nthe side we were approaching stood a girl, who was leaning against the\npost, with one arm resting on the top of the gate.\n\nThis girl was neither tall nor short--taller than she looked at a distance;\nshe had not a slight waist; sooty black was her hair, with a broad\nforehead, perpendicular but low; she had a pair of very fine, dark,\nlustrous eyes, and no other good feature--unless I may so call her teeth,\nwhich were very white and even. Her face was rather short, and swarthy as\na gipsy's; observant and sullen too; and she did not move, only eyed us\nnegligently from under her dark lashes as we drew near. Altogether a not\nunpicturesque figure, with a dusky, red petticoat of drugget, and tattered\njacket of bottle-green stuff, with short sleeves, which showed her brown\narms from the elbow.\n\n'That's Pegtop's daughter,' said Milly.\n\n'Who is Pegtop?' I asked.\n\n'He's the miller--see, yonder it is,' and she pointed to a very pretty\nfeature in the landscape, a windmill, crowning the summit of a hillock\nwhich rose suddenly above the level of the treetops, like an island in the\ncentre of the valley.\n\n'The mill not going to-day, Beauty?' bawled Milly.\n\n'No--a, Beauty; it baint,' replied the girl, loweringly, and without\nstirring.\n\n'And what's gone with the stile?' demanded Milly, aghast. 'It's tore away\nfrom the paling!'\n\n'Well, so it be,' replied the wood nymph in the red petticoat, showing her\nfine teeth with a lazy grin.\n\n'Who's a bin and done all that?' demanded Milly.\n\n'Not you nor me, lass,' said the girl.\n\n''Twas old Pegtop, your father, did it,' cried Milly, in rising wrath.\n\n''Appen it wor,' she replied.\n\n'And the gate locked.'\n\n'That's it--the gate locked,' she repeated, sulkily, with a defiant\nside-glance at Milly.\n\n'And where's Pegtop?'\n\n'At t'other side, somewhere; how should I know where he be?' she replied.\n\n'Who's got the key?'\n\n'Here it be, lass,' she answered, striking her hand on her pocket. 'And how\ndurst you stay us here? Unlock it, huzzy, this minute!' cried Milly, with a\nstamp.\n\nHer answer was a sullen smile.\n\n'Open the gate this instant!' bawled Milly.\n\n'Well, I _won't._'\n\nI expected that Milly would have flown into a frenzy at this direct\ndefiance, but she looked instead puzzled and curious--the girl's unexpected\naudacity bewildered her.\n\n'Why, you fool, I could get over the paling as soon as look at you, but I\nwon't. What's come over you? Open the gate, I say, or I'll make you.'\n\n'Do let her alone, dear,' I entreated, fearing a mutual assault. 'She has\nbeen ordered, may be, not to open it. Is it so, my good girl?'\n\n'Well, thou'rt not the biggest fool o' the two,' she observed,\ncommendatively, 'thou'st hit it, lass.'\n\n'And who ordered you?' exclaimed Milly.\n\n'Fayther.'\n\n'Old Pegtop. Well, _that's_ summat to laugh at, it is--our servant\na-shutting us out of our own grounds.'\n\n'No servant o' yourn!'\n\n'Come, lass, what do you mean?'\n\n'He be old Silas's miller, and what's that to thee?'\n\nWith these words the girl made a spring on the hasp of the padlock, and\nthen got easily over the gate.\n\n'Can't you do that, cousin?' whispered Milly to me, with an impatient\nnudge. 'I _wish_ you'd try.'\n\n'No, dear--come away, Milly,' and I began to withdraw.\n\n'Lookee, lass, 'twill be an ill day's work for thee when I tell the\nGovernor,' said Milly, addressing the girl, who stood on a log of timber at\nthe other side, regarding us with a sullen composure.\n\n'We'll be over in spite o' you,' cried Milly.\n\n'You lie!' answered she.\n\n'And why not, huzzy?' demanded my cousin, who was less incensed at the\naffront than I expected. All this time I was urging Milly in vain to come\naway.\n\n'Yon lass is no wild cat, like thee--that's why,' said the sturdy portress.\n\n'If I cross, I'll give you a knock,' said Milly.\n\n'And I'll gi' thee another,' she answered, with a vicious wag of the head.\n\n'Come, Milly, _I'll_ go if _you_ don't,' I said.\n\n'But we must not be beat,' whispered she, vehemently, catching my arm; 'and\nye _shall_ get over, and _see_ what I will gi' her!'\n\n'I'll _not_ get over.'\n\n'Then I'll break the door, for ye _shall_ come through,' exclaimed Milly,\nkicking the stout paling with her ponderous boot.\n\n'Purr it, purr it, purr it!' cried the lass in the red petticoat with a\ngrin.\n\n'Do you know who this lady is?' cried Milly, suddenly.\n\n'She is a prettier lass than thou,' answered Beauty.\n\n'She's _my_ cousin Maud--Miss Ruthyn of Knowl--and she's a deal richer than\nthe Queen; and the Governor's taking care of her; and he'll make old Pegtop\nbring you to reason.'\n\nThe girl eyed me with a sulky listlessness, a little inquisitively, I\nthought.\n\n'See if he don't,' threatened Milly.\n\n'You positively _must_ come,' I said, drawing her away with me.\n\n'Well, shall we come in?' cried Milly, trying a last summons.\n\n'You'll not come in that much,' she answered, surlily, measuring an\ninfinitesimal distance on her finger with her thumb, which she pinched\nagainst it, the gesture ending with a snap of defiance, and a smile that\nshowed her fine teeth.\n\n'I've a mind to shy a stone at you,' shouted Milly.\n\n'Faire away; I'll shy wi' ye as long as ye like, lass; take heed o'\nyerself;' and Beauty picked up a round stone as large as a cricket ball.\n\nWith difficulty I got Milly away without an exchange of missiles, and much\ndisgusted at my want of zeal and agility.\n\n'Well, come along, cousin, I know an easy way by the river, when it's low,'\nanswered Milly. 'She's a brute--is not she?'\n\nAs we receded, we saw the girl slowly wending her way towards the old\nthatched cottage, which showed its gable from the side of a little rugged\neminence embowered in spreading trees, and dangling and twirling from its\nstring on the end of her finger the key for which a battle had so nearly\nbeen fought.\n\nThe stream was low enough to make our flank movement round the end of\nthe paling next it quite easy, and so we pursued our way, and Milly's\nequanimity returned, and our ramble grew very pleasant again.\n\nOur path lay by the river bank, and as we proceeded, the dwarf timber was\nsucceeded by grander trees, which crowded closer and taller, and, at last,\nthe scenery deepened into solemn forest, and a sudden sweep in the river\nrevealed the beautiful ruin of a steep old bridge, with the fragments of a\ngate-house on the farther side.\n\n'Oh, Milly darling!' I exclaimed, 'what a beautiful drawing this would\nmake! I should so like to make a sketch of it.'\n\n'So it would. _Make_ a picture--_do_!--here's a stone that's pure and flat\nto sit upon, and you look very tired. Do make it, and I'll sit by you.'\n\n'Yes, Milly, I _am_ tired, a little, and I _will_ sit down; but we must\nwait for another day to make the picture, for we have neither pencil\nnor paper. But it is much too pretty to be lost; so let us come again\nto-morrow.'\n\n'To-morrow be hanged! you'll do it to-day, bury-me-wick, but you _shall_;\nI'm wearying to see you make a picture, and I'll fetch your conundrums out\no' your drawer, for do 't you shall.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n_ZAMIEL_\n\n\nIt was all vain my remonstrating. She vowed that by crossing the\nstepping-stones close by she could, by a short cut, reach the house, and\nreturn with my pencils and block-book in a quarter of an hour. Away then,\nwith many a jump and fling, scampered Milly's queer white stockings and\nnavvy boots across the irregular and precarious stepping-stones, over which\nI dared not follow her; so I was fain to return to the stone so 'pure\nand flat,' on which I sat, enjoying the grand sylvan solitude, the dark\nbackground and the grey bridge mid-way, so tall and slim, across whose\nruins a sunbeam glimmered, and the gigantic forest trees that slumbered\nround, opening here and there in dusky vistas, and breaking in front into\ndetached and solemn groups. It was the setting of a dream of romance.\n\nIt would have been the very spot in which to read a volume of German\nfolk-lore, and the darkening colonnades and silent nooks of the forest\nseemed already haunted with the voices and shadows of those charming elves\nand goblins.\n\nAs I sat here enjoying the solitude and my fancies among the low branches\nof the wood, at my right I heard a crashing, and saw a squat broad figure\nin a stained and tattered military coat, and loose short trousers, one limb\nof which flapped about a wooden leg. He was forcing himself through. His\nface was rugged and wrinkled, and tanned to the tint of old oak; his eyes\nblack, beadlike, and fierce, and a shock of sooty hair escaped from under\nhis battered wide-awake nearly to his shoulders. This forbidding-looking\nperson came stumping and jerking along toward me, whisking his stick now\nand then viciously in the air, and giving his fell of hair a short shake,\nlike a wild bull preparing to attack.\n\nI stood up involuntarily with a sense of fear and surprise, almost fancying\nI saw in that wooden-legged old soldier, the forest demon who haunted Der\nFreisch\u00c3\u00bctz.\n\nSo he approached shouting--\n\n'Hollo! you--how came you here? Dost 'eer?'\n\nAnd he drew near panting, and sometimes tugging angrily in his haste at his\nwooden leg, which sunk now and then deeper than was convenient in the sod.\nThis exertion helped to anger him, and when he halted before me, his dark\nface smirched with smoke and dust, and the nostrils of his flat drooping\nnose expanded and quivered as he panted, like the gills of a fish; an\nangrier or uglier face it would not be easy to fancy.\n\n'Ye'll all come when ye like, will ye? and do nout but what pleases\nyourselves, won't you? And who'rt thou? Dost 'eer--who _are_ ye, I say; and\nwhat the deil seek ye in the woods here? Come, bestir thee!'\n\nIf his wide mouth and great tobacco-stained teeth, his scowl, and loud\ndiscordant tones were intimidating, they were also extremely irritating.\nThe moment my spirit was roused, my courage came.\n\n'I am Miss Ruthyn of Knowl, and Mr. Silas Ruthyn, your master, is my\nuncle.'\n\n'Hoo!' he exclaimed more gently, 'an' if Silas be thy uncle thou'lt be come\nto live wi' him, and thou'rt she as come overnight--eh?'\n\nI made no answer, but I believe I looked both angrily and disdainfully.\n\n'And what make ye alone here? and how was I to know't, an' Milly not wi'\nye, nor no one? But Maud or no Maud, I wouldn't let the Dooke hisself set\nfoot inside the palin' without Silas said let him. And you may tell Silas\nthem's the words o' Dickon Hawkes, and I'll stick to 'm--and what's more\nI'll tell him _myself_--I will; I'll tell him there be no use o' my\nstriving and straining hee, day an' night and night and day, watchin' again\npoachers, and thieves, and gipsies, and they robbing lads, if rules won't\nbe kep, and folk do jist as they pleases. Dang it, lass, thou'rt in luck I\ndidn't heave a brick at thee when I saw thee first.'\n\n'I'll complain of you to my uncle,' I replied.\n\n'So do, and and 'appen thou'lt find thyself in the wrong box, lass; thou\ncanst na' say I set the dogs arter thee, nor cau'd thee so much as a wry\nname, nor heave a stone at thee--did I? Well? and where's the complaint\nthen?'\n\nI simply answered, rather fiercely,\n\n'Be good enough to leave me.'\n\n'Well, I make no objections, mind. I'm takin' thy word--thou'rt Maud\nRuthyn--'appen thou be'st and 'appen thou baint. I'm not aweer on't, but I\ntakes thy word, and all I want to know's just this, did Meg open the gate\nto thee?'\n\nI made him no answer, and to my great relief I saw Milly striding and\nskipping across the unequal stepping-stones.\n\n'Hallo, Pegtop! what are you after now?' she cried, as she drew near.\n\n'This man has been extremely impertinent. You know him, Milly?' I said.\n\n'Why that's Pegtop Dickon. Dirty old Hawkes that never was washed. I tell\nyou, lad, ye'll see what the Governor thinks o't--a-ha! He'll talk to you.'\n\n'I done or said nout--not but I _should_, and there's the fack--she can't\ndeny't; she hadn't a hard word from I; and I don't care the top o' that\nthistle what no one says--not I. But I tell thee, Milly, I stopped _some_\no' thy pranks, and I'll stop more. Ye'll be shying no more stones at the\ncattle.'\n\n'Tell your tales, and welcome, cried Milly. 'I wish I was here when you\njawed cousin. If Winny was here she'd catch you by the timber toe and put\nyou on your back.'\n\n'Ay, she'll be a good un yet if she takes arter thee,' retorted the old man\nwith a fierce sneer.\n\n'Drop it, and get away wi' ye,' cried she, 'or maybe I'd call Winny to\nsmash your timber leg for you.'\n\n'A-ha! there's more on't. She's a sweet un. Isn't she?' he replied\nsardonically.\n\n'You did not like it last Easter, when Winny broke it with a kick.'\n\n''Twas a kick o' a horse,' he growled with a glance at me.\n\n''Twas no such thing--'twas Winny did it--and he laid on his back for a\nweek while carpenter made him a new one.' And Milly laughed hilariously.\n\n'I'll fool no more wi' ye, losing my time; I won't; but mind ye, I'll speak\nwi' Silas.' And going away he put his hand to his crumpled wide-awake, and\nsaid to me with a surly difference--\n\n'Good evening, Miss Ruthyn--good evening, ma'am--and ye'll please remember,\nI did not mean nout to vex thee.'\n\nAnd so he swaggered away, jerking and waddling over the sward, and was soon\nlost in the wood.\n\n'It's well he's a little bit frightened--I never saw him so angry, I think;\nhe is awful mad.'\n\n'Perhaps he really is not aware how very rude he is,' I suggested.\n\n'I hate him. We were twice as pleasant with poor Tom Driver--he never\nmeddled with any one, and was always in liquor; Old Gin was the name he\nwent by. But this brute--I do hate him--he comes from Wigan, I think, and\nhe's always spoiling sport--and he whops Meg--that's Beauty, you know, and\nI don't think she'd be half as bad only for him. Listen to him whistlin'.'\n\n'I did hear whistling at some distance among the trees.'\n\n'I declare if he isn't callin' the dogs! Climb up here, I tell ye,' and we\nclimbed up the slanting trunk of a great walnut tree, and strained our eyes\nin the direction from which we expected the onset of Pegtop's vicious pack.\n\nBut it was a false alarm.\n\n'Well, I don't think he _would_ do that, after all--_hardly_; but he is a\nbrute, sure!'\n\n'And that dark girl who would not let us through, is his daughter, is she?'\n\n'Yes, that's Meg--Beauty, I christened her, when I called him Beast; but I\ncall him Pegtop now, and she's Beauty still, and that's the way o't.'\n\n'Come, sit down now, an' make your picture,' she resumed so soon as we had\ndismounted from our position of security.\n\n'I'm afraid I'm hardly in the vein. I don't think I could draw a straight\nline. My hand trembles.'\n\n'I wish you could, Maud,' said Milly, with a look so wistful and\nentreating, that considering the excursion she had made for the pencils, I\ncould not bear to disappoint her.\n\n'Well, Milly, we must only try; and if we fail we can't help it. Sit you\ndown beside me and I'll tell you why I begin with one part and not another,\nand you'll see how I make trees and the river, and--yes, _that_ pencil,\nit is hard and answers for the fine light lines; but we must begin at the\nbeginning, and learn to copy drawings before we attempt real views like\nthis. And if you wish it, Milly, I'm resolved to teach you everything I\nknow, which, after all, is not a great deal, and we shall have such fun\nmaking sketches of the same landscapes, and then comparing.'\n\nAnd so on, Milly, quite delighted, and longing to begin her course of\ninstruction, sat down beside me in a rapture, and hugged and kissed me so\nheartily that we were very near rolling together off the stone on which we\nwere seated. Her boisterous delight and good-nature helped to restore me,\nand both laughing heartily together, I commenced my task.\n\n'Dear me! who's that?' I exclaimed suddenly, as looking up from my\nblock-book I saw the figure of a slight man in the careless morning-dress\nof a gentleman, crossing the ruinous bridge in our direction, with\nconsiderable caution, upon the precarious footing of the battlement, which\nalone offered an unbroken passage.\n\nThis was a day of apparitions! Milly recognised him instantly. The\ngentleman was Mr. Carysbroke. He had taken The Grange only for a year. He\nlived quite to himself, and was very good to the poor, and was the only\ngentleman, for ever so long, who had visited at Bartram, and oddly enough\nnowhere else. But he wanted leave to cross through the grounds, and having\nobtained it, had repeated his visit, partly induced, no doubt, by the\nfact that Bartram boasted no hospitalities, and that there was no risk of\nmeeting the county folk there.\n\nWith a stout walking-stick in his hand, and a short shooting-coat, and a\nwide-awake hat in much better trim than Zamiel's, he emerged from the copse\nthat covered the bridge, walking at a quick but easy pace.\n\n'He'll be goin' to see old Snoddles, I guess,' said Milly, looking a little\nfrightened and curious; for Milly, I need not say, was a bumpkin, and stood\nin awe of this gentleman's good-breeding, though she was as brave as a\nlion, and would have fought the Philistines at any odds, with the jawbone\nof an ass.\n\n''Appen he won't see us,' whispered Milly, hopefully.\n\nBut he did, and raising his hat, with a cheerful smile, that showed very\nwhite teeth, he paused.\n\n'Charming day, Miss Ruthyn.'\n\nI raised my head suddenly as he spoke, from habit appropriating the\naddress; it was so marked that he raised his hat respectfully to me, and\nthen continued to Milly--\n\n'Mr. Ruthyn, I hope, quite well? but I need hardly ask, you seem so happy.\nWill you kindly tell him, that I expect the book I mentioned in a day or\ntwo, and when it comes I'll either send or bring it to him immediately?'\n\nMilly and I were standing, by this time, but she only stared at him,\ntongue-tied, her cheeks rather flushed, and her eyes very round, and to\nfacilitate the dialogue, as I suppose, he said again--\n\n'He's quite well, I hope?'\n\nStill no response from Milly, and I, provoked, though myself a little shy,\nmade answer--\n\n'My uncle, Mr. Ruthyn, is very well, thank you,' and I felt that I blushed\nas I spoke.\n\n'Ah, pray excuse me, may I take a great liberty? you are Miss Ruthyn,\nof Knowl? Will you think me very impertinent--I'm afraid you will--if I\nventure to introduce myself? My name is Carysbroke, and I had the honour of\nknowing poor Mr. Ruthyn when I was quite a little boy, and he has shown a\nkindness for me since, and I hope you will pardon the liberty I fear I've\ntaken. I think my friend, Lady Knollys, too, is a relation of yours; what a\ncharming person she is!'\n\n'Oh, is not she? such a darling!' I said, and then blushed at my outspoken\naffection.\n\nBut he smiled kindly, as if he liked me for it; and he said--\n\n'You know whatever I think, I dare not quite say that; but frankly I can\nquite understand it. She preserves her youth so wonderfully, and her fun\nand her good-nature are so entirely girlish. What a sweet view you have\nselected,' he continued, changing all at once. 'I've stood just at\nthis point so often to look back at that exquisite old bridge. Do you\nobserve--you're an artist, I see--something very peculiar in that tint of\nthe grey, with those odd cross stains of faded red and yellow?'\n\n'I do, indeed; I was just remarking the peculiar beauty of the\ncolouring--was not I, Milly?'\n\nMilly stared at me, and uttered an alarmed 'Yes,' and looked as if she had\nbeen caught in a robbery.\n\n'Yes, and you have so very peculiar a background,' he resumed. 'It was\nbetter before the storm though; but it is very good still.'\n\nThen a little pause, and 'Do you know this country at all?' rather\nsuddenly.\n\n'No, not in the least--that is, I've only had the drive to this place; but\nwhat I did see interested me very much.'\n\n'You will be charmed with it when you know it better--the very place for an\nartist. I'm a wretched scribbler myself, and I carry this little book in\nmy pocket,' and he laughed deprecatingly while he drew forth a thin\nfishing-book, as it looked. 'They are mere memoranda, you see. I walk so\nmuch and come unexpectedly on such pretty nooks and studies, I just try\nto make a note of them, but it is really more writing than sketching; my\nsister says it is a cipher which nobody but myself understands. However,\nI'll try and explain just two--because you really ought to go and see the\nplaces. Oh, no; not that,' he laughed, as accidentally the page blew over,\n'that's the Cat and Fiddle, a curious little pot-house, where they gave me\nsome very good ale one day.'\n\nMilly at this exhibited some uneasy tokens of being about to speak, but not\nknowing what might be coming, I hastened to observe on the spirited little\nsketches to which he meant to draw my attention.\n\n'I want to show you only the places within easy reach--a short ride or\ndrive.'\n\nSo he proceeded to turn over two or three, in addition to the two he had\nat first proposed, and then another; then a little sketch just tinted, and\nreally quite a charming little gem, of Cousin Monica's pretty gabled old\nhouse; and every subject had its little criticism, or its narrative, or\nadventure.\n\nAs he was about returning this little sketch-book to his pocket, still\nchatting to me, he suddenly recollected poor Milly, who was looking rather\nlowering; but she brightened a good deal as he presented it to her, with a\nlittle speech which she palpably misunderstood, for she made one of her odd\ncourtesies, and was about, I thought, to put it into her large pocket, and\naccept it as a present.\n\n'Look at the drawings, Milly, and then return it,' I whispered.\n\nAt his request I allowed him to look at my unfinished sketch of the bridge,\nand while he was measuring distances and proportions with his eye, Milly\nwhispered rather angrily to me.\n\n'And why should I?'\n\n'Because he wants it back, and only meant to lend it to you,' whispered I.\n\n'_Lend_ it to me--and after you! Bury-me-wick if I look at a leaf of it,'\nshe retorted in high dudgeon. 'Take it, lass; give it him yourself--I'll\nnot,' and she popped it into my hand, and made a sulky step back.\n\n'My cousin is very much obliged,' I said, returning the book, and smiling\nfor her, and he took it smiling also and said--\n\n'I think if I had known how very well you draw, Miss Ruthyn, I should have\nhesitated about showing you my poor scrawls. But these are not my best, you\nknow; Lady Knollys will tell you that I can really do better--a great deal\nbetter, I think.'\n\nAnd then with more apologies for what he called his impertinence, he took\nhis leave, and I felt altogether very much pleased and flattered.\n\nHe could not be more than twenty-nine or thirty, I thought, and he was\ndecidedly handsome--that is, his eyes and teeth, and clear brown complexion\nwere--and there was something distinguished and graceful in his figure\nand gesture; and altogether there was the indescribable attraction of\nintelligence; and I fancied--though this, of course, was a secret--that\nfrom the moment he spoke to us he felt an interest in me. I am not going to\nbe vain. It was a _grave_ interest, but still an interest, for I could see\nhim studying my features while I was turning over his sketches, and he\nthought I saw nothing else. It was flattering, too, his anxiety that\nI should think well of his drawing, and referring me to Lady Knollys.\nCarysbroke--had I ever heard my dear father mention that name? I could not\nrecollect it. But then he was habitually so silent, that his not doing so\nargued nothing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n_WE VISIT A ROOM IN THE SECOND STOREY_\n\n\nMr. Carysbroke amused my fancy sufficiently to prevent my observing Milly's\nsilence, till we had begun our return homeward.\n\n'The Grange must be a pretty house, if that little sketch be true; is it\nfar from this?'\n\n''Twill be two mile.'\n\n'Are you vexed, Milly?' I asked, for both her tone and looks were angry.\n\n'Yes, I am vexed; and why not lass?'\n\n'What has happened?'\n\n'Well, now, that is rich! Why, look at that fellow, Carysbroke: he took no\nmore notice to me than a dog, and kep' talking to you all the time of his\npictures, and his walks, and his people. Why, a pig's better manners than\nthat.'\n\n'But, Milly dear, you forget, he tried to talk to you, and you would not\nanswer him,' I expostulated.\n\n'And is not that just what I say--I can't talk like other folk--ladies, I\nmean. Every one laughs at me; an' I'm dressed like a show, I am. It's a\nshame! I saw Polly Shives--what a lady she is, my eyes!--laughing at me in\nchurch last Sunday. I was minded to give her a bit of my mind. An' I know\nI'm queer. It's a shame, it is. Why should _I_ be so rum? it is a shame! I\ndon't want to be so, nor it isn't my fault.'\n\nAnd poor Milly broke into a flood of tears, and stamped on the ground, and\nburied her face in her short frock, which she whisked up to her eyes; and\nan odder figure of grief I never beheld.\n\n'And I could not make head or tail of what he was saying,' cried poor Milly\nthrough her buff cotton, with a stamp; 'and you twigged every word o't. An'\nwhy am I so? It's a shame--a shame! Oh, ho, ho! it's a shame!'\n\n'But, my dear Milly, we were talking of _drawing_, and you have not learned\nyet, but you shall--I'll teach you; and then you'll understand all about\nit.'\n\n'An' every one laughs at me--even you; though you try, Maud, you can scarce\nkeep from laughing sometimes. I don't blame you, for I know I'm queer; but\nI can't help it; and it's a shame.'\n\n'Well, my dear Milly, listen to me: if you allow me, I assure you, I'll\nteach you all the music and drawing I know. You have lived very much\nalone; and, as you say, ladies have a way of speaking of their own that is\ndifferent from the talk of other people.'\n\n'Yes, that they have, an' gentlemen too--like the Governor, and that\nCarysbroke; and a precious lingo it is--dang it--why, the devil himself\ncould not understand it; an' I'm like a fool among you. I could 'most drown\nmyself. It's a shame! It is--you know it is.--It's a shame!'\n\n'But I'll teach you that lingo too, if you wish it, Milly; and you shall\nknow everything that I know; and I'll manage to have your dresses better\nmade.'\n\nBy this time she was looking very ruefully, but attentively, in my face,\nher round eyes and nose swelled, and her cheeks all wet.\n\n'I think if they were a little longer--yours is longer, you know;' and the\nsentence was interrupted by a sob.\n\n'Now, Milly, you must not be crying; if you choose you may be just as the\nsame as any other lady--and you shall; and you will be very much admired, I\ncan tell you, if only you will take the trouble to quite unlearn all your\nodd words and ways, and dress yourself like other people; and I will take\ncare of that if you let me; and I think you are very clever, Milly; and I\nknow you are very pretty.'\n\nPoor Milly's blubbered face expanded into a smile in spite of herself; but\nshe shook her head, looking down.\n\n'Noa, noa, Maud, I fear 'twon't be.' And indeed it seemed I had proposed to\nmyself a labour of Hercules.\n\nBut Milly was really a clever creature, could see quickly, and when her\nungainly dialect was mastered, describe very pleasantly; and if only she\nwould endure the restraint and possessed the industry requisite, I did not\ndespair, and was resolved at least to do my part.\n\nPoor Milly! she was really very grateful, and entered into the project of\nher education with great zeal, and with a strange mixture of humility and\ninsubordination.\n\nMilly was in favour of again attacking 'Beauty's' position on her return,\nand forcing a passage from this side; but I insisted on following the route\nby which we had arrived, and so we got round the paling by the river, and\nwere treated to a provoking grin of defiance by 'Beauty,' who was talking\nacross the gate to a slim young man, arrayed in fustian, and with an\nodd-looking cap of rabbit-skin on his head, which, on seeing us, he pulled\nsheepishly to the side of his face next to us, as he lounged, with his arm\nunder his chin, on the top bar of the gate.\n\nAfter our encounter of to-day, indeed, it was Miss 'Beauty's' wont to\nexhibit a kind of jeering disdain in her countenance whenever we passed.\n\nI think Milly would have engaged her again, had I not reminded her of her\nundertaking, and exerted my new authority.\n\n'Look at that sneak, Pegtop, there, going up the path to the mill. He makes\nbelief now he does not see us; but he does, though, only he's afraid we'll\ntell the Governor, and he thinks Governor won't give him his way with you.\nI hate that Pegtop: he stopped me o' riding the cows a year ago, he did.'\n\nI thought Pegtop might have done worse. Indeed it was plain that a total\nreformation was needed here; and I was glad to find that poor Milly seemed\nherself conscious of it; and that her resolution to become more like other\npeople of her station was not a mere spasm of mortification and jealousy,\nbut a genuine and very zealous resolve.\n\nI had not half seen this old house of Bartram-Haugh yet. At first, indeed,\nI had but an imperfect idea of its extent. There was a range of rooms along\none side of the great gallery, with closed window-shutters, and the doors\ngenerally locked. Old L'Amour grew cross when we went into them, although\nwe could see nothing; and Milly was afraid to open the windows--not that\nany Bluebeard revelations were apprehended, but simply because she knew\nthat Uncle Silas's order was that things should be left undisturbed; and\nthis boisterous spirit stood in awe of him to a degree which his gentle\nmanners and apparent quietude rendered quite surprising.\n\nThere were in this house, what certainly did not exist at Knowl, and what\nI have never observed, thought they may possibly be found in other old\nhouses--I mean, here and there, very high hatches, which we could only\npeep over by jumping in the air. They crossed the long corridors and great\ngalleries; and several of them were turned across and locked, so as to\nintercept the passage, and interrupt our explorations.\n\nMilly, however, knew a queer little, very steep and dark back stair, which\nreached the upper floor; so she and I mounted, and made a long ramble\nthrough rooms much lower and ruder in finish than the lordly chambers we\nhad left below. These commanded various views of the beautiful though\nneglected grounds; but on crossing a gallery we entered suddenly a chamber,\nwhich looked into a small and dismal quadrangle, formed by the inner walls\nof this great house, and of course designed only by the architect to afford\nthe needful light and air to portions of the structure.\n\nI rubbed the window-pane with my handkerchief and looked out. The\nsurrounding roof was steep and high. The walls looked soiled and dark. The\nwindows lined with dust and dirt, and the window-stones were in places\ntufted with moss, and grass, and groundsel. An arched doorway had opened\nfrom the house into this darkened square, but it was soiled and dusty; and\nthe damp weeds that overgrew the quadrangle drooped undisturbed against it.\nIt was plain that human footsteps tracked it little, and I gazed into that\nblind and sinister area with a strange thrill and sinking.\n\n'This is the second floor--there is the enclosed court-yard'--I, as it\nwere, soliloquised.\n\n'What are you afraid of, Maud? you look as ye'd seen a ghost,' exclaimed\nMilly, who came to the window and peeped over my shoulder.\n\n'It reminded me suddenly, Milly, of that frightful business.'\n\n'What business, Maud?--what a plague are ye thinking on?' demanded Milly,\nrather amused.\n\n'It was in one of these rooms--maybe this--yes, it certainly _was_\nthis--for see, the panelling has been pulled off the wall--that Mr. Charke\nkilled himself.'\n\nI was staring ruefully round the dim chamber, in whose corners the shadows\nof night were already gathering.\n\n'Charke!--what about him?--who's Charke?' asked Milly.\n\n'Why, you must have heard of him,' said I.\n\n'Not as I'm aware on,' answered she. 'And he killed himself, did he, hanged\nhimself, eh, or blowed his brains out?'\n\n'He cut his throat in one of these rooms--_this_ one, I'm sure--for your\npapa had the wainscoting stripped from the wall to ascertain whether there\nwas any second door through which a murderer could have come; and you see\nthese walls are stripped, and bear the marks of the woodwork that has been\nremoved,' I answered.\n\n'Well, that _was_ awful! I don't know how they have pluck to cut their\nthroats; if I was doing it, I'd like best to put a pistol to my head and\nfire, like the young gentleman did, they say, in Deadman's Hollow. But the\nfellows that cut their throats, they must be awful game lads, I'm thinkin',\nfor it's a long slice, you know.'\n\n'Don't, don't, Milly dear. Suppose we come away,' I said, for the evening\nwas deepening rapidly into night.\n\n'Hey and bury-me-wick, but here's the blood; don't you see a big black\ncloud all spread over the floor hereabout, don't ye see?' Milly was\nstooping over the spot, and tracing the outline of this, perhaps, imaginary\nmapping, in the air with her finger.\n\n'No, Milly, you could not see it: the floor is too dark, and it's all in\nshadow. It must be fancy; and perhaps, after all, this is not the room.'\n\n'Well--I think, I'm _sure_ it _is_. Stand--just look.'\n\n'We'll come in the morning, and if you are right we can see it better then.\nCome away,' I said, growing frightened.\n\nAnd just as we stood up to depart, the white high-cauled cap and large\nsallow features of old L'Amour peeped in at the door.\n\n'Lawk! what brings you here?' cried Milly, nearly as much startled as I at\nthe intrusion.\n\n'What brings _you_ here, miss?' whistled L'Amour through her gums.\n\n'We're looking where Charke cut his throat,' replied Milly.\n\n'Charke the devil!' said the old woman, with an odd mixture of scorn and\nfury. ''Tisn't his room; and come ye out of it, please. Master won't like\nwhen he hears how you keep pulling Miss Maud from one room to another, all\nthrough the house, up and down.'\n\nShe was gabbling sternly enough, but dropped a low courtesy as I passed\nher, and with a peaked and nodding stare round the room, the old woman\nclapped the door sharply, and locked it.\n\n'And who has been a talking about Charke--a pack o lies, I warrant. I\ns'pose you want to frighten Miss Maud here' (another crippled courtesy)\n'wi' ghosts and like nonsense.'\n\n'You're out there: 'twas she told me; and much about it. Ghosts, indeed!\nI don't vally them, not I; if I did, I know who'd frighten me,' and Milly\nlaughed.\n\nThe old woman stuffed the key in her pocket, and her wrinkled mouth pouted\nand receded with a grim uneasiness.\n\n'A harmless brat, and kind she is; but wild--wild--she will be wild.'\n\nSo whispered L'Amour in my ear, during the silence that followed, nodding\nshakily toward Milly over the banister, and she courtesied again as we\ndeparted, and shuffled off toward Uncle Silas's room.\n\nThe Governor is queerish this evening,' said Milly, when we were seated at\nour tea. 'You never saw him queerish, did you?'\n\n'You must say what you mean, more plainly, Milly. You don't mean ill, I\nhope?'\n\n'Well! I don't know what it is; but he does grow very queer\nsometimes--you'd think he was dead a'most, maybe two or three days and\nnights together. He sits all the time like an old woman in a swound. Well,\nwell, it is awful!'\n\n'Is he insensible when in that state?' I asked, a good deal alarmed.\n\n'I don't know; but it never signifies anything. It won't kill him, I do\nbelieve; but old L'Amour knows all about it. I hardly ever go into the room\nwhen he's so, only when I'm sent for; and he sometimes wakes up and takes a\nfancy to call for this one or that. One day he sent for Pegtop all the way\nto the mill; and when he came, he only stared at him for a minute or two,\nand ordered him out o' the room. He's like a child a'most, when he's in one\no' them dazes.'\n\nI always knew when Uncle Silas was 'queerish,' by the injunctions of old\nL'Amour, whistled and spluttered over the banister as we came up-stairs,\nto mind how we made a noise passing master's door; and by the sound of\nmysterious to-ings and fro-ings about his room.\n\nI saw very little of him. He sometimes took a whim to have us breakfast\nwith him, which lasted perhaps for a week; and then the order of our living\nwould relapse into its old routine.\n\nI must not forget two kind letters from Lady Knollys, who was detained\naway, and delighted to hear that I enjoyed my quiet life; and promised to\napply, in person, to Uncle Silas, for permission to visit me.\n\nShe was to be for the Christmas at Elverston, and that was only six miles\naway from Bartram-Haugh, so I had the excitement of a pleasant look\nforward.\n\nShe also said that she would include poor Milly in her invitation; and a\nvision of Captain Oakley rose before me, with his handsome gaze turned in\nwonder on poor Milly, for whom I had begun to feel myself responsible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n_AN ARRIVAL AT DEAD OF NIGHT_\n\n\nI have sometimes been asked why I wear an odd little turquois ring--which\nto the uninstructed eye appears quite valueless and altogether an unworthy\ncompanion of those jewels which flash insultingly beside it. It is a little\nkeepsake, of which I became possessed about this time.\n\n'Come, lass, what name shall I give you?' cried Milly, one morning,\nbursting into my room in a state of alarming hilarity.\n\n'My own, Milly.'\n\n'No, but you must have a nickname, like every one else.'\n\n'Don't mind it, Milly.'\n\n'Yes, but I will. Shall I call you Mrs. Bustle?'\n\n'You shall do no such thing.'\n\n'But you must have a name.'\n\n'I refuse a name.'\n\n'But I'll give you one, lass.'\n\n'And _I_ won't have it.'\n\n'But you can't help me christening you.'\n\n'I can decline answering.'\n\n'But I'll make you,' said Milly, growing very red.\n\nPerhaps there was something provoking in my tone, for I certainly was very\nmuch disgusted at Milly's relapse into barbarism.\n\n'You can't,' I retorted quietly.\n\n'See if I don't, and I'll give ye one twice as ugly.'\n\nI smiled, I fear, disdainfully.\n\n'And I think you're a minx, and a slut, and a fool,' she broke out,\nflushing scarlet.\n\nI smiled in the same unchristian way.\n\n'And I'd give ye a smack o' the cheek as soon as look at you.'\n\nAnd she gave her dress a great slap, and drew near me, in her wrath. I\nreally thought she was about tendering the ordeal of single combat.\n\nI made her, however, a paralysing courtesy, and, with immense dignity,\nsailed out of the room, and into Uncle Silas's study, where it happened we\nwere to breakfast that morning, and for several subsequent ones.\n\nDuring the meal we maintained the most dignified reserve; and I don't think\neither so much as looked at the other.\n\nWe had no walk together that day.\n\nI was sitting in the evening, quite alone, when Milly entered the room. Her\neyes were red, and she looked very sullen.\n\n'I want your hand, cousin,' she said, at the same time taking it by the\nwrist, and administering with it a sudden slap on her plump cheek, which\nmade the room ring, and my fingers tingle; and before I had recovered from\nmy surprise, she had vanished.\n\nI called after her, but no answer; I pursued, but she was running too; and\nI quite lost her at the cross galleries.\n\nI did not see her at tea, nor before going to bed; but after I had fallen\nasleep I was awakened by Milly, in floods of tears.\n\n'Cousin Maud, will ye forgi' me--you'll never like me again, will ye? No--I\nknow ye won't--I'm such a brute--I hate it--it's a shame. And here's a\nBanbury cake for you--I sent to the town for it, and some taffy--won't ye\neat it? and here's a little ring--'tisn't as pretty as your own rings; and\nye'll wear it, maybe, for my sake--poor Milly's sake, before I was so bad\nto ye--if ye forgi' me; and I'll look at breakfast, and if it's on your\nfinger I'll know you're friends wi' me again; and if ye don't, I won't\ntrouble you no more; and I think I'll just drown myself out o' the way, and\nyou'll never see wicked Milly no more.'\n\nAnd without waiting a moment, leaving me only half awake, and with the\nsensations of dreaming, she scampered from the room, in her bare feet, with\na petticoat about her shoulders.\n\nShe had left her candle by my bed, and her little offerings on the coverlet\nby me. If I had stood an atom less in terror of goblins than I did, I\nshould have followed her, but I was afraid. I stood in my bare feet at my\nbedside, and kissed the poor little ring and put it on my finger, where it\nhas remained ever since and always shall. And when I lay down, longing for\nmorning, the image of her pale, imploring, penitential face was before me\nfor hours; and I repented bitterly of my cool provoking ways, and thought\nmyself, I dare say justly, a thousand times more to blame than Milly.\n\nI searched in vain for her before breakfast. At that meal, however, we met,\nbut in the presence of Uncle Silas, who, though silent and apathetic, was\nformidable; and we, sitting at a table disproportionably large, under the\ncold, strange gaze of my guardian, talked only what was inevitable, and\nthat in low tones; for whenever Milly for a moment raised her voice, Uncle\nSilas would wince, place his thin white fingers quickly over his ear, and\nlook as if a pain had pierced his brain, and then shrug and smile piteously\ninto vacancy. When Uncle Silas, therefore, was not in the talking vein\nhimself--and that was not often--you may suppose there was very little\nspoken in his presence.\n\nWhen Milly, across the table, saw the ring upon my finger, she, drawing\nin her breath, said, 'Oh!' and, with round eyes and mouth, she looked so\ndelighted; and she made a little motion, as if she was on the point of\njumping up; and then her poor face quivered, and she bit her lip; and\nstaring imploringly at me, her eyes filled fast with tears, which rolled\ndown her round penitential cheeks.\n\nI am sure I felt more penitent than she. I know I was crying and smiling,\nand longing to kiss her. I suppose we were very absurd; but it is well that\nsmall matters can stir the affections so profoundly at a time of life when\ngreat troubles seldom approach us.\n\nWhen at length the opportunity did come, never was such a hug out of the\nwrestling ring as poor Milly bestowed on me, swaying me this way and that,\nand burying her face in my dress, and blubbering--\n\n'I was so lonely before you came, and you so good to me, and I such a\ndevil; and I'll never call you a name, but Maud--my darling Maud.'\n\n'You must, Milly--Mrs. Bustle. I'll be Mrs. Bustle, or anything you like.\nYou must.' I was blubbering like Milly, and hugging my best; and, indeed, I\nwonder how we kept our feet.\n\nSo Milly and I were better friends than ever.\n\nMeanwhile, the winter deepened, and we had short days and long nights,\nand long fireside gossipings at Bartram-Haugh. I was frightened at the\nfrequency of the strange collapses to which Uncle Silas was subject. I\ndid not at first mind them much, for I naturally fell into Milly's way of\ntalking about them.\n\nBut one day, while in one of his 'queerish' states, he called for me, and I\nsaw him, and was unspeakably scared.\n\nIn a white wrapper, he lay coiled in a great easy chair. I should have\nthought him dead, had I not been accompanied by old L'Amour, who knew every\ngradation and symptom of these strange affections.\n\nShe winked and nodded to me with a ghastly significance, and whispered--\n\n'Don't make no noise, miss, till he talks; he'll come to for a bit, anon.'\n\nExcept that there was no sign of convulsions, the countenance was like that\nof an epileptic arrested in one of his contortions.\n\nThere was a frown and smirk like that of idiotcy, and a strip of white\neyeball was also disclosed.\n\nSuddenly, with a kind of chilly shudder, he opened his eyes wide, and\nscrewed his lips together, and blinked and stared on me with a fatuised\nuncertainty, that gradually broke into a feeble smile.\n\n'Ah! the girl--Austin's child. Well, dear, I'm hardly able--I'll speak\nto-morrow--next day--it is tic--neuralgia, or something--_torture_--tell\nher.'\n\nSo, huddling himself together, he lay again in his great chair, with the\nsame inexpressible helplessness in his attitude, and gradually his face\nresumed its dreadful cast.\n\n'Come away, miss: he's changed his mind; he'll not be fit to talk to you\nnoways all day, maybe,' said the old woman, again in a whisper.\n\nSo forth we stole from the room, I unspeakably shocked. In fact, he looked\nas if he were dying, and so, in my agitation, I told the crone, who,\nforgetting the ceremony with which she usually treated me, chuckled out\nderisively,\n\n'A-dying is he? Well, he be like Saint Paul--he's bin a-dying daily this\nmany a day.'\n\nI looked at her with a chill of horror. She did not care, I suppose, what\nsort of feelings she might excite, for she went on mumbling sarcastically\nto herself. I had paused, and overcame my reluctance to speak to her again,\nfor I was really very much frightened. 'Do you think he is in danger? Shall\nwe send for a doctor?' I whispered.\n\n'Law bless ye, the doctor knows all about it, miss.' The old woman's face\nhad a gleam of that derision which is so shocking in the features of\nfeebleness and age.\n\n'But it is a _fit_, it is paralytic, or something horrible--it can't be\n_safe_ to leave him to chance or nature to get through these terrible\nattacks.'\n\n'There's no fear of him, 'tisn't no fits at all, he's nout the worse o't.\nJest silly a bit now and again. It's been the same a dozen year and more;\nand the doctor knows all about it,' answered the old woman sturdily. 'And\nye'll find he'll be as mad as bedlam if ye make any stir about it.'\n\nThat night I talked the matter over with Mary Quince.\n\n'They're very dark, miss; but I think he takes a deal too much laudlum,'\nsaid Mary.\n\nTo this hour I cannot say what was the nature of those periodical seizures.\nI have often spoken to medical men about them, since, but never could learn\nthat excessive use of opium could altogether account for them. It was,\nI believe, certain, however, that he did use that drug in startling\nquantities. It was, indeed, sometimes a topic of complaint with him that\nhis neuralgia imposed this sad necessity upon him.\n\nThe image of Uncle Silas, as I had seen him that day, troubled and\naffrighted my imagination, as I lay in my bed; I had slept very well since\nmy arrival at Bartram. So much of the day was passed in the open air, and\nin active exercise, that this was but natural. But that night I was nervous\nand wakeful, and it was past two o'clock when I fancied I heard the sound\nof horses and carriage-wheels on the avenue.\n\nMary Quince was close by, and therefore I was not afraid to get up and peep\nfrom the window. My heart beat fast as I saw a post-chaise approach the\ncourt-yard. A front window was let down, and the postilion pulled up for a\nfew seconds.\n\nIn consequence of some directions received by him, I fancied he resumed his\nroute at a walk, and so drew up at the hall-door, on the steps of which a\nfigure awaited his arrival. I think it was old L'Amour, but I could not be\nquite certain. There was a lantern on the top of the balustrade, close by\nthe door. The chaise-lamps were lighted, for the night was rather dark. A\nbag and valise, as well as I could see, were pulled from the interior by\nthe post-boy, and a box from the top of the vehicle, and these were carried\ninto the hall.\n\nI was obliged to keep my cheek against the window-pane to command a view\nof the point of debarkation, and my breath upon the glass, which dimmed it\nagain almost as fast as I wiped it away, helped to obscure my vision. But\nI saw a tall figure, in a cloak, get down and swiftly enter the house, but\nwhether male or female I could not discern.\n\nMy heart beat fast. I jumped at once to a conclusion. My uncle was\nworse--was, in fact, dying; and this was the physician, too late summoned\nto his bedside.\n\nI listened for the ascent of the doctor, and his entrance at my uncle's\ndoor, which, in the stillness of the night, I thought I might easily hear,\nbut no sound reached me. I listened so for fully five minutes, but\nwithout result. I returned to the window, but the carriage and horses had\ndisappeared.\n\nI was strongly tempted to wake Mary Quince, and take counsel with her, and\npersuade her to undertake a reconnoissance. The fact is, I was persuaded\nthat my uncle was in extremity, and I was quite wild to know the doctor's\nopinion. But, after all, it would be cruel to summon the good soul from her\nrefreshing nap. So, as I began to feel very cold, I returned to my bed,\nwhere I continued to listen and conjecture until I fell asleep.\n\nIn the morning, as was usual, before I was dressed, in came Milly.\n\n'How is Uncle Silas?' I eagerly enquired.\n\n'Old L'Amour says he's queerish still; but he's not so dull as yesterday,'\nanswered she.\n\n'Was not the doctor sent for?' I asked.\n\n'Was he? Well, that's odd; and she said never a word o't to me,' answered\nshe.\n\n'I'm asking only,' said I.\n\n'I don't know whether he came or no,' she replied; 'but what makes you take\nthat in your head?'\n\n'A chaise arrived here between two and three o'clock last night.'\n\n'Hey! and who told you?' Milly seemed all on a sudden highly interested.\n\n'I saw it, Milly; and some one, I fancy the doctor, came from it into the\nhouse.'\n\n'Fudge, lass! who'd send for the doctor? 'Twasn't he, I tell you. What was\nhe like?' said Milly.\n\n'I could only see clearly that he, or _she_, was tall, and wore a cloak,' I\nreplied.\n\n'Then 'twasn't him nor t'other I was thinking on, neither; and I'll be\nhanged but I think it will be Cormoran,' cried Milly, with a thoughtful rap\nwith her knuckle on the table.\n\nPrecisely at this juncture a tapping came to the door.\n\n'Come in,' said I.\n\nAnd old L'Amour entered the room, with a courtesy.\n\n'I came to tell Miss Quince her breakfast's ready,' said the old lady.\n\n'Who came in the chaise, L'Amour?' demanded Milly.\n\n'What chaise?' spluttered the beldame tartly.\n\n'The chaise that came last night, past two o'clock,' said Milly.\n\n'That's a lie, and a damn lie!' cried the beldame. 'There worn't no chaise\nat the door since Miss Maud there come from Knowl.'\n\nI stared at the audacious old menial who could utter such language.\n\n'Yes, there was a chaise, and Cormoran, as I think, be come in it,' said\nMilly, who seemed accustomed to L'Amour's daring address.\n\n'And there's another damn lie, as big as the t'other,' said the crone, her\nhaggard and withered face flushing orange all over.\n\n'I beg you will not use such language in my room,' I replied, very angrily.\n'I saw the chaise at the door; your untruth signifies very little, but\nyour impertinence here I will not permit. Should it be repeated, I will\nassuredly complain to my uncle.'\n\nThe old woman flushed more fiercely as I spoke, and fixed her bleared glare\non me, with a compression of her mouth that amounted to a wicked grimace.\nShe resisted her angry impulse, however, and only chuckled a little\nspitefully, saying,\n\n'No offence, miss: it be a way we has in Derbyshire o' speaking our minds.\nNo offence, miss, were meant, and none took, as I hopes,' and she made me\nanother courtesy. 'And I forgot to tell you, Miss Milly, the master wants\nyou this minute.'\n\nSo Milly, in mute haste, withdrew, followed closely by L'Amour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n_DOCTOR BRYERLY EMERGES_\n\n\nWhen Milly joined me at breakfast, her eyes were red and swollen. She was\nstill sniffing with that little sobbing hiccough, which betrays, even were\nthere no other signs, recent violent weeping. She sat down quite silent.\n\n'Is he worse, Milly?' I enquired, anxiously.\n\n'No, nothing's wrong wi' him; he's right well,' said Milly, fiercely.\n\n'What's the matter then, Milly dear?'\n\n'The poisonous old witch! 'Twas just to tell the Gov'nor how I'd said 'twas\nCormoran that came by the po'shay last night.'\n\n'And who is Cormoran?' I enquired.\n\n'Ay, there it is; I'd like to tell, and you want to hear--and I just\ndaren't, for he'll send me off right to a French school--hang it--hang them\nall!--if I do.'\n\n'And why should Uncle Silas care?' said I, a good deal surprised.\n\n'They're a-tellin' lies.'\n\n'Who?' said I.\n\n'L'Amour--that's who. So soon as she made her complaint of me, the Gov'nor\nasked her, sharp enough, did anyone come last night, or a po'shay; and she\nwas ready to swear there was no one. Are ye quite sure, Maud, you really\ndid see aught, or 'appen 'twas all a dream?'\n\n'It was no dream, Milly; so sure as you are there, I saw exactly what I\ntold you,' I replied.\n\n'Gov'nor won't believe it anyhow; and he's right mad wi' me; and he\nthreatens me he'll have me off to France; I wish 'twas under the sea. I\nhate France--I do--like the devil. Don't you? They're always a-threatening\nme wi' France, if I dare say a word more about the po'shay, or--or anyone.'\n\nI really was curious about Cormoran; but Cormoran was not to be defined\nto me by Milly; nor did she, in reality, know more than I respecting the\narrival of the night before.\n\nOne day I was surprised to see Doctor Bryerly on the stairs. I was standing\nin a dark gallery as he walked across the floor of the lobby to my uncle's\ndoor, his hat on, and some papers in his hand.\n\nHe did not see me; and when he had entered Uncle Silas's door, I went down\nand found Milly awaiting me in the hall.\n\n'So Doctor Bryerly is here,' I said.\n\n'That's the thin fellow, wi' the sharp look, and the shiny black coat, that\nwent up just now?' asked Milly.\n\n'Yes, he's gone into your papa's room,' said I.\n\n''Appen 'twas he come 'tother night. He may be staying here, though we see\nhim seldom, for it's a barrack of a house--it is.'\n\nThe same thought had struck me for a moment, but was dismissed immediately.\nIt certainly was _not_ Doctor Bryerly's figure which I had seen.\n\nSo, without any new light gathered from this apparition, we went on our\nway, and made our little sketch of the ruined bridge. We found the gate\nlocked as before; and, as Milly could not persuade me to climb it, we got\nround the paling by the river's bank.\n\nWhile at our drawing, we saw the swarthy face, sooty locks, and old\nweather-stained red coat of Zamiel, who was glowering malignly at us\nfrom among the trunks of the forest trees, and standing motionless as a\nmonumental figure in the side aisle of a cathedral. When we looked again he\nwas gone.\n\nAlthough it was a fine mild day for the wintry season, we yet, cloaked as\nwe were, could not pursue so still an occupation as sketching for more than\nten or fifteen minutes. As we returned, in passing a clump of trees, we\nheard a sudden outbreak of voices, angry and expostulatory; and saw, under\nthe trees, the savage old Zamiel strike his daughter with his stick two\ngreat blows, one of which was across the head. 'Beauty' ran only a short\ndistance away, while the swart old wood-demon stumped lustily after her,\ncursing and brandishing his cudgel.\n\nMy blood boiled. I was so shocked that for a moment I could not speak; but\nin a moment more I screamed--\n\n'You brute! How dare you strike the poor girl?'\n\nShe had only run a few steps, and turned about confronting him and us, her\neyes gleaming fire, her features pale and quivering to suppress a burst of\nweeping. Two little rivulets of blood were trickling over her temple.\n\n'I say, fayther, look at that,' she said, with a strange tremulous smile,\nlifting her hand, which was smeared with blood.\n\nPerhaps he was ashamed, and the more enraged on that account, for he\ngrowled another curse, and started afresh to reach her, whirling his stick\nin the air. Our voices, however, arrested him.\n\n'My uncle shall hear of your brutality. The poor girl!'\n\n'Strike him, Meg, if he does it again; and pitch his leg into the river\nto-night, when he's asleep.'\n\n'I'd serve _you_ the same;' and out came an oath. 'You'd have her lick her\nfayther, would ye? Look out!'\n\nAnd he wagged his head with a scowl at Milly, and a flourish of his cudgel.\n\n'Be quiet, Milly,' I whispered, for Milly was preparing for battle; and I\nagain addressed him with the assurance that, on reaching home, I would tell\nmy uncle how he had treated the poor girl.\n\n''Tis you she may thank for't, a wheedling o' her to open that gate,' he\nsnarled.\n\n'That's a lie; we went round by the brook,' cried Milly.\n\nI did not think proper to discuss the matter with him; and looking very\nangry, and, I thought, a little put out, he jerked and swayed himself out\nof sight. I merely repeated my promise of informing my uncle as he went, to\nwhich, over his shoulder, he bawled--\n\n'Silas won't mind ye _that_;' snapping his horny finger and thumb.\n\nThe girl remained where she had stood, wiping the blood off roughly with\nthe palm of her hand, and looking at it before she rubbed it on her apron.\n'My poor girl,' I said, 'you must not cry. I'll speak to my uncle about\nyou.'\n\nBut she was not crying. She raised her head, and looked at us a little\naskance, with a sullen contempt, I thought.\n\n'And you must have these apples--won't you?' We had brought in our basket\ntwo or three of those splendid apples for which Bartram was famous.\n\nI hesitated to go near her, these Hawkeses, Beauty and Pegtop, were such\nsavages. So I rolled the apples gently along the ground to her feet.\n\nShe continued to look doggedly at us with the same expression, and kicked\naway the apples sullenly that approached her feet. Then, wiping her temple\nand forehead in her apron, without a word, she turned and walked slowly\naway.\n\n'Poor thing! I'm afraid she leads a hard life. What strange, repulsive\npeople they are!'\n\nWhen we reached home, at the head of the great staircase old L'Amour was\nawaiting me; and with a courtesy, and very respectfully, she informed me\nthat the Master would be happy to see me.\n\nCould it be about my evidence as to the arrival of the mysterious chaise\nthat he summoned me to this interview? Gentle as were his ways, there was\nsomething undefinable about Uncle Silas which inspired fear; and I should\nhave liked few things less than meeting his gaze in the character of a\nculprit.\n\nThere was an uncertainty, too, as to the state in which I might find him,\nand a positive horror of beholding him again in the condition in which I\nhad last seen him.\n\nI entered the room, then, in some trepidation, but was instantly relieved.\nUncle Silas was in the same health apparently, and, as nearly as I could\nrecollect it, in precisely the same rather handsome though negligent garb\nin which I had first seen him.\n\nDoctor Bryerly--what a marked and vulgar contrast, and yet, somehow, how\nreassuring!--sat at the table near him, and was tying up papers. His eyes\nwatched me, I thought, with an anxious scrutiny as I approached; and I\nthink it was not until I had saluted him that he recollected suddenly that\nhe had not seen me before at Bartram, and stood up and greeted me in his\nusual abrupt and somewhat familiar way. It was vulgar and not cordial, and\nyet it was honest and indefinably kind. Up rose my uncle, that strangely\nvenerable, pale portrait, in his loose Rembrandt black velvet. How gentle,\nhow benignant, how unearthly, and inscrutable!\n\n'I need not say how she is. Those lilies and roses, Doctor Bryerly, speak\ntheir own beautiful praises of the air of Bartram. I almost regret that her\ncarriage will be home so soon. I only hope it may not abridge her rambles.\nIt positively does me good to look at her. It is the glow of flowers in\nwinter, and the fragrance of a field which the Lord hath blessed.'\n\n'Country air, Miss Ruthyn, is a right good kitchen to country fare. I like\nto see young women eat heartily. You have had some pounds of beef and\nmutton since I saw you last,' said Dr. Bryerly.\n\nAnd this sly speech made, he scrutinised my countenance in silence rather\nembarrassingly.\n\n'My system, Doctor Bryerly, as a disciple of Aesculapius you will\napprove--health first, accomplishment afterwards. The Continent is the\nbest field for elegant instruction, and we must see the world a little,\nby-and-by, Maud; and to me, if my health be spared, there would be an\nunspeakable though a melancholy charm in the scenes where so many happy,\nthough so many wayward and foolish, young days were passed; and I think I\nshould return to these picturesque solitudes with, perhaps, an increased\nrelish. You remember old Chaulieu's sweet lines--\n\n  D\u00c3\u00a9sert, aimable solitude,\n  S\u00c3\u00a9jour du calme et de la paix,\n  Asile o\u00c3\u00b9 n'entr\u00c3\u00a8rent jamais\n  Le tumulte et l'inqui\u00c3\u00a9tude.\n\nI can't say that care and sorrow have not sometimes penetrated these sylvan\nfastnesses; but the tumults of the world, thank Heaven!--never.'\n\nThere was a sly scepticism, I thought, in Doctor Bryerly's sharp face; and\nhardly waiting for the impressive 'never,' he said--\n\n'I forgot to ask, who is your banker?'\n\n'Oh! Bartlet and Hall, Lombard Street,' answered Uncle Silas, dryly and\nshortly.\n\nDr. Bryerly made a note of it, with an expression of face which seemed,\nwith a sly resolution, to say, 'You shan't come the anchorite over me.'\n\nI saw Uncle Silas's wild and piercing eye rest suspiciously on me for a\nmoment, as if to ascertain whether I felt the spirit of Doctor Bryerly's\nalmost interruption; and, nearly at the same moment, stuffing his papers\ninto his capacious coat pockets, Doctor Bryerly rose and took his leave.\n\nWhen he was gone, I bethought me that now was a good opportunity of making\nmy complaint of Dickon Hawkes. Uncle Silas having risen, I hesitated, and\nbegan,\n\n'Uncle, may I mention an occurrence--which I witnessed?'\n\n'Certainly, child,' he answered, fixing his eye sharply on me. I really\nthink he fancied that the conversation was about to turn upon the phantom\nchaise.\n\nSo I described the scene which had shocked Milly and me, an hour or so ago,\nin the Windmill Wood.\n\n'You see, my dear child, they are rough persons; their ideas are not ours;\ntheir young people must be chastised, and in a way and to a degree that we\nwould look upon in a serious light. I've found it a bad plan interfering in\nstrictly domestic misunderstandings, and should rather not.'\n\n'But he struck her violently on the head, uncle, with a heavy cudgel, and\nshe was bleeding very fast.'\n\n'Ah?' said my uncle, dryly.\n\n'And only that Milly and I deterred him by saying that we would certainly\ntell you, he would have struck her again; and I really think if he goes on\ntreating her with so much violence and cruelty he may injure her seriously,\nor perhaps kill her.'\n\n'Why, you romantic little child, people in that rank of life think\nabsolutely nothing of a broken head,' answered Uncle Silas, in the same\nway.\n\n'But is it not horrible brutality, uncle?'\n\n'To be sure it is brutality; but then you must remember they are brutes,\nand it suits them,' said he.\n\nI was disappointed. I had fancied that Uncle Silas's gentle nature would\nhave recoiled from such an outrage with horror and indignation; and\ninstead, here he was, the apologist of that savage ruffian, Dickon Hawkes.\n\n'And he is always so rude and impertinent to Milly and to me,' I continued.\n'Oh! impertinent to you--that's another matter. I must see to that. Nothing\nmore, my dear child?'\n\n'Well, there _was_ nothing more.'\n\n'He's a useful servant, Hawkes; and though his looks are not prepossessing,\nand his ways and language rough, yet he is a very kind father, and a most\nhonest man--a thoroughly moral man, though severe--a very rough diamond\nthough, and has no idea of the refinements of polite society. I venture to\nsay he honestly believes that he has been always unexceptionably polite to\nyou, so we must make allowances.'\n\nAnd Uncle Silas smoothed my hair with his thin aged hand, and kissed my\nforehead.\n\n'Yes, we must make allowances; we must be kind. What says the Book?--\"Judge\nnot, that ye be not judged.\" Your dear father acted upon that maxim--so\nnoble and so awful--and I strive to do so. Alas! dear Austin, _longo\nintervalle_, far behind! and you are removed--my example and my help; you\nare gone to your rest, and I remain beneath my burden, still marching on by\nbleak and alpine paths, under the awful night.\n\n  O nuit, nuit douloureuse! O toi, tardive aurore!\n  Viens-tu? vas-tu venir? es-tu bien loin encore?\n\nAnd repeating these lines of Chenier, with upturned eyes, and one hand\nlifted, and an indescribable expression of grief and fatigue, he sank\nstiffly into his chair, and remained mute, with eyes closed for some time.\nThen applying his scented handkerchief to them hastily, and looking very\nkindly at me, he said--\n\n'Anything more, dear child?'\n\n'Nothing, uncle, thank you, very much, only about that man, Hawkes; I dare\nsay that he does not mean to be so uncivil as he is, but I am really afraid\nof him, and he makes our walks in that direction quite unpleasant.'\n\n'I understand quite, my dear. I will see to it; and you must remember that\nnothing is to be allowed to vex my beloved niece and ward during her stay\nat Bartram--nothing that her old kinsman, Silas Ruthyn, can remedy.'\n\nSo with a tender smile, and a charge to shut the door 'perfectly, but\nwithout clapping it,' he dismissed me. Doctor Bryerly had not slept at\nBartram, but at the little inn in Feltram, and he was going direct to\nLondon, as I afterwards learned.\n\n'Your ugly doctor's gone away in a fly,' said Milly, as we met on the\nstairs, she running up, I down.\n\nOn reaching the little apartment which was our sitting-room, however, I\nfound that she was mistaken; for Doctor Bryerly, with his hat and a great\npair of woollen gloves on, and an old Oxford grey surtout that showed his\nlank length to advantage, buttoned all the way up to his chin, had set down\nhis black leather bag on the table, and was reading at the window a little\nvolume which I had borrowed from my uncle's library.\n\nIt was Swedenborg's account of the other worlds, Heaven and Hell.\n\nHe closed it on his finger as I entered, and without recollecting to remove\nhis hat, he made a step or two towards me with his splay, creaking boots.\nWith a quick glance at the door, he said--\n\n'Glad to see you alone for a minute--very glad.'\n\nBut his countenance, on the contrary, looked very anxious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n_A MIDNIGHT DEPARTURE_\n\n\n'I'm going this minute--I--I want to know'--another glance at the\ndoor--'are you really quite comfortable here?'\n\n'Quite,' I answered promptly.\n\n'You have only your cousin's company?' he continued, glancing at the table,\nwhich was laid for two.\n\n'Yes; but Milly and I are very happy together.'\n\n'That's very nice; but I think there are no teachers, you see--painters,\nand singers, and that sort of thing that is usual with young ladies. No\nteachers of that kind--of _any_ kind--are there?' 'No; my uncle thinks it\nbetter I should lay in a store of health, he says.'\n\n'I know; and the carriage and horses have not come; how soon are they\nexpected?'\n\n'I really can't say, and I assure you I don't much care. I think running\nabout great fun.'\n\n'You walk to church?'\n\n'Yes; Uncle Silas's carriage wants a new wheel, he told me.'\n\n'Ay, but a young woman of your rank, you know, it is not usual she should\nbe without the use of a carriage. Have you horses to ride?'\n\nI shook my head.\n\n'Your uncle, you know, has a very liberal allowance for your maintenance\nand education.'\n\nI remembered something in the will about it, and Mary Quince was constantly\ngrumbling that 'he did not spend a pound a week on our board.'\n\nI answered nothing, but looked down.\n\nAnother glance at the door from Doctor Bryerly's sharp black eyes.\n\n'Is he kind to you?'\n\n'Very kind--most gentle and affectionate.'\n\n'Why doesn't he keep company with you? Does he ever dine with you, or drink\ntea, or talk to you? Do you see much of him?'\n\n'He is a miserable invalid--his hours and regimen are peculiar. Indeed\nI wish very much you would consider his case; he is, I believe, often\ninsensible for a long time, and his mind in a strange feeble state\nsometimes.'\n\n'I dare say--worn out in his young days; and I saw that preparation of\nopium in his bottle--he takes too much.'\n\n'Why do you think so, Doctor Bryerly?'\n\n'It's made on water: the spirit interferes with the use of it beyond a\ncertain limit. You have no idea what those fellows can swallow. Read the\n\"Opium Eater.\" I knew two cases in which the quantity exceeded De Quincy's.\nAha! it's new to you?' and he laughed quietly at my simplicity.\n\n'And what do you think his complaint is?' I asked.\n\n'Pooh! I haven't a notion; but, probably, one way or another, he has been\nall his days working on his nerves and his brain. These men of pleasure,\nwho have no other pursuit, use themselves up mostly, and pay a smart price\nfor their sins. And so he's kind and affectionate, but hands you over to\nyour cousin and the servants. Are his people civil and obliging?'\n\n'Well, I can't say much for them; there is a man named Hawkes, and his\ndaughter, who are very rude, and even abusive sometimes, and say they have\norders from my uncle to shut us out from a portion of the grounds; but I\ndon't believe that, for Uncle Silas never alluded to it when I was making\nmy complaint of them to-day.'\n\n'From what part of the grounds is that?' asked Doctor Bryerly, sharply.\n\nI described the situation as well as I could.\n\n'Can we see it from this?' he asked, peeping from the window.\n\n'Oh, no.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly made a note in his pocket-book here, and I said--\n\n'But I am really quite sure it was a story of Dickon's, he is such a surly,\ndisobliging man.'\n\n'And what sort is that old servant that came in and out of his room?'\n\n'Oh, that is old L'Amour,' I answered, rather indirectly, and forgetting\nthat I was using Milly's nickname.\n\n'And is _she_ civil?' he asked.\n\nNo, she certainly was not; a most disagreeable old woman, with a vein of\nwickedness. I thought I had heard her swearing.\n\n'They don't seem to be a very engaging lot,' said Doctor Bryerly;' but\nwhere there's one, there will be more. See here, I was just reading a\npassage,' and he opened the little volume at the place where his finger\nmarked it, and read for me a few sentences, the purport of which I well\nremember, although, of course, the words have escaped me.\n\nIt was in that awful portion of the book which assumes to describe the\ncondition of the condemned; and it said that, independently of the physical\ncauses in that state operating to enforce community of habitation, and an\nisolation from superior spirits, there exist sympathies, aptitudes,\nand necessities which would, of themselves, induce that depraved\ngregariousness, and isolation too. 'And what of the rest of the servants,\nare they better?' he resumed.\n\nWe saw little or nothing of the others, except of old 'Giblets,' the\nbutler, who went about like a little automaton of dry bones, poking here\nand there, and whispering and smiling to himself as he laid the cloth; and\nseeming otherwise quite unconscious of an external world.\n\n'This room is not got up like Mr. Ruthyn's: does he talk of furnishings and\nmaking things a little smart? No! Well, I must say, I think he might.'\n\nHere there was a little silence, and Doctor Bryerly, with his accustomed\nsimultaneous glance at the door, said in low, cautious tones, very\ndistinctly--\n\n'Have you been thinking at all over that matter again, I mean about getting\nyour uncle to forego his guardianship? I would not mind his first refusal.\nYou could make it worth his while, unless he--that is--unless he's very\nunreasonable indeed; and I think you would consult your interest, Miss\nRuthyn, by doing so and, if possible, getting out of this place.'\n\n'But I have not thought of it at all; I am much happier here than I had at\nall expected, and I am very fond of my cousin Milly.'\n\n'How long have you been here exactly?'\n\nI told him. It was some two or three months.\n\n'Have you seen your other cousin yet--the young gentleman?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'H'm! Aren't you very lonely?' he enquired.\n\n'We see no visitors here; but that, you know, I was prepared for.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly read the wrinkles on his splay boot intently and peevishly,\nand tapped the sole lightly on the ground.\n\n'Yes, it is very lonely, and the people a bad lot. You'd be pleasanter\nsomewhere else--with Lady Knollys, for instance, eh?'\n\n'Well, _there_ certainly. But I am very well here: really the time passes\nvery pleasantly; and my uncle is so kind. I have only to mention anything\nthat annoys me, and he will see that it is remedied: he is always\nimpressing that on me.'\n\n'Yes, it is not a fit place for you,' said Doctor Bryerly. 'Of course,\nabout your uncle,' he resumed, observing my surprised look, 'it is all\nright: but he's quite helpless, you know. At all events, _think_ about it.\nHere's my address--Hans Emmanuel Bryerly, M.D., 17 King Street, Covent\nGarden, London--don't lose it, mind,' and he tore the leaf out of his\nnote-book.\n\n'Here's my fly at the door, and you must--you must' (he was looking at his\nwatch)--'mind you _must_ think of it seriously; and so, you see, don't let\nanyone see that. You'll be sure to leave it throwing about. The best way\nwill be just to scratch it on the door of your press, inside, you know; and\ndon't put my name--you'll remember that--only the rest of the address; and\nburn this. Quince is with you?'\n\n'Yes,' I answered, glad to have a satisfactory word to say.\n\n'Well, don't let her go; it's a bad sign if they wish it. Don't consent,\nmind; but just tip me a hint and you'll have me down. And any letters you\nget from Lady Knollys, you know, for she's very plain-spoken, you'd better\nburn them off-hand. And I've stayed too long, though; mind what I say,\nscratch it with a pin, and burn that, and not a word to a mortal about it.\nGood-bye; oh, I was taking away your book.'\n\nAnd so, in a fuss, with a slight shake of the hand, getting up his\numbrella, his bag, and tin box, he hurried from the room; and in a minute\nmore, I heard the sound of his vehicle as it drove away.\n\nI looked after it with a sigh; the uneasy sensations which I had\nexperienced respecting my sojourn at Bartram-Haugh were re-awakened.\n\nMy ugly, vulgar, true friend was disappearing beyond those gigantic lime\ntrees which hid Bartram from the eyes of the outer world. The fly, with the\ndoctor's valise on top, vanished, and I sighed an anxious sigh. The shadow\nof the over-arching trees contracted, and I felt helpless and forsaken; and\nglancing down the torn leaf, Doctor Bryerly's address met my eye, between\nmy fingers.\n\nI slipt it into my breast, and ran up-stairs stealthily, trembling lest the\nold woman should summon me again, at the head of the stairs, into Uncle\nSilas's room, where under his gaze, I fancied, I should be sure to betray\nmyself.\n\nBut I glided unseen and safely by, entered my room, and shut my door. So\nlistening and working, I, with my scissors' point, scratched the address\nwhere Doctor Bryerly had advised. Then, in positive terror, lest some one\nshould even knock during the operation, I, with a match, consumed to ashes\nthe tell-tale bit of paper.\n\nNow, for the first time, I experienced the unpleasant sensations of\nhaving a secret to keep. I fancy the pain of this solitary liability was\ndisproportionately acute in my case, for I was naturally very open and\nvery nervous. I was always on the point of betraying it _apropos des\nbottes_--always reproaching myself for my duplicity; and in constant terror\nwhen honest Mary Quince approached the press, or good-natured Milly made\nher occasional survey of the wonders of my wardrobe. I would have given\nanything to go and point to the tiny inscription, and say:--'This is Doctor\nBryerly's address in London. I scratched it with my scissors' point, taking\nevery precaution lest anyone--you, my good friends, included--should\nsurprise me. I have ever since kept this secret to myself, and trembled\nwhenever your frank kind faces looked into the press. There--you at last\nknow all about it. Can you ever forgive my deceit?'\n\nBut I could not make up my mind to reveal it; nor yet to erase the\ninscription, which was my alternative thought. Indeed I am a wavering,\nirresolute creature as ever lived, in my ordinary mood. High excitement or\npassion only can inspire me with decision. Under the inspiration of either,\nhowever, I am transformed, and often both prompt and brave.\n\n'Some one left here last night, I think, Miss,' said Mary Quince, with a\nmysterious nod, one morning. ''Twas two o'clock, and I was bad with the\ntoothache, and went down to get a pinch o' red pepper--leaving the candle\na-light here lest you should awake. When I was coming up--as I was crossing\nthe lobby, at the far end of the long gallery--what should I hear, but a\nhorse snorting, and some people a-talking, short and quiet like. So I looks\nout o' the window; and there surely I did see two horses yoked to a shay,\nand a fellah a-pullin' a box up o' top; and out comes a walise and a bag;\nand I think it was old Wyat, please'm, that Miss Milly calls L'Amour, that\nstood in the doorway a-talking to the driver.'\n\n'And who got into the chaise, Mary?' I asked.\n\n'Well, Miss, I waited as long as I could; but the pain was bad, and me so\nawful cold; I gave it up at last, and came back to bed, for I could not say\nhow much longer they might wait. And you'll find, Miss,'twill be kep' a\nsecret, like the shay as you saw'd, Miss, last week. I hate them dark ways,\nand secrets; and old Wyat--she does tell stories, don't she?--and she as\nought to be partickler, seein' her time be short now, and she so old. It is\nawful, an old un like that telling such crams as she do.'\n\nMilly was as curious as I, but could throw no light on this. We both\nagreed, however, that the departure was probably that of the person whose\narrival I had accidentally witnessed. This time the chaise had drawn up\nat the side door, round the corner of the left side of the house; and, no\ndoubt, driven away by the back road.\n\nAnother accident had revealed this nocturnal move. It was very provoking,\nhowever, that Mary Quince had not had resolution to wait for the appearance\nof the traveller. We all agreed, however, that we were to observe a strict\nsilence, and that even to Wyat--L'Amour I had better continue to call\nher--Mary Quince was not to hint what she had seen. I suspect, however,\nthat injured curiosity asserted itself, and that Mary hardly adhered to\nthis self-denying resolve.\n\nBut cheerful wintry suns and frosty skies, long nights, and brilliant\nstarlight, with good homely fires in our snuggery--gossipings, stories,\nshort readings now and then, and brisk walks through the always beautiful\nscenery of Bartram-Haugh, and, above all, the unbroken tenor of our life,\nwhich had fallen into a serene routine, foreign to the idea of danger\nor misadventure, gradually quieted the qualms and misgivings which my\ninterview with Doctor Bryerly had so powerfully resuscitated.\n\nMy cousin Monica, to my inexpressible joy, had returned to her\ncountry-house; and an active diplomacy, through the post-office, was\nnegotiating the re-opening of friendly relations between the courts of\nElverston and of Bartram.\n\nAt length, one fine day, Cousin Monica, smiling pleasantly, with her cloak\nand bonnet on, and her colour fresh from the shrewd air of the Derbyshire\nhills, stood suddenly before me in our sitting-room. Our meeting was that\nof two school-companions long separated. Cousin Monica was always a girl in\nmy eyes.\n\nWhat a hug it was; what a shower of kisses and ejaculations, enquiries\nand caresses! At last I pressed her down into a chair, and, laughing, she\nsaid--\n\n'You have no idea what self-denial I have exercised to bring this visit\nabout. I, who detest writing, have actually written five letters to Silas;\nand I don't think I said a single impertinent thing in one of them! What a\nwonderful little old thing your butler is! I did not know what to make of\nhim on the steps. Is he a struldbrug, or a fairy, or only a ghost? Where on\nearth did your uncle pick him up? I'm sure he came in on All Hallows E'en,\nto answer an incantation--not your future husband, I hope--and he'll vanish\nsome night into gray smoke, and whisk sadly up the chimney. He's the most\nvenerable little thing I ever beheld in my life. I leaned back in the\ncarriage and thought I should absolutely die of laughing. He's gone up to\nprepare your uncle for my visit; and I really am very glad, for I'm sure I\nshall look as young as Hebe after _him_. But who is this? Who are you, my\ndear?'\n\nThis was addressed to poor Milly, who stood at the corner of the\nchimney-piece, staring with her round eyes and plump cheeks in fear and\nwonder upon the strange lady.\n\n'How stupid of me,' I exclaimed. 'Milly, dear, this is your cousin, Lady\nKnollys.'\n\n'And so _you_ are Millicent. Well, dear, I am very glad to see you.' And\nCousin Monica was on her feet again in an instant, with Milly's hand very\ncordially in hers; and she gave her a kiss upon each cheek, and patted her\nhead.\n\nMilly, I must mention, was a much more presentable figure than when I first\nencountered her. Her dresses were at least a quarter of a yard longer.\nThough very rustic, therefore, she was not so barbarously grotesque, by any\nmeans.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n_COUSIN MONICA AND UNCLE SILAS MEET_\n\n\nCousin Monica, with her hands upon Milly's shoulders, looked amusedly and\nkindly in her face. 'And,' said she, 'we must be very good friends--you\nfunny creature, you and I. I'm allowed to be the most saucy old woman in\nDerbyshire--quite incorrigibly privileged; and nobody is ever affronted\nwith me, so I say the most shocking things constantly.'\n\n'I'm a bit that way, myself; and I think,' said poor Milly, making an\neffort, and growing very red; she quite lost her head at that point, and\nwas incompetent to finish the sentiment she had prefaced.\n\n'You think? Now, take my advice, and never wait to think my dear; talk\nfirst, and think afterwards, that is my way; though, indeed, I can't say\nI ever think at all. It is a very cowardly habit. Our cold-blooded cousin\nMaud, there, thinks sometimes; but it is always such a failure that I\nforgive her. I wonder when your little pre-Adamite butler will return. He\nspeaks the language of the Picts and Ancient Britons, I dare say, and your\nfather requires a little time to translate him. And, Milly dear, I am very\nhungry, so I won't wait for your butler, who would give me, I suppose, one\nof the cakes baked by King Alfred, and some Danish beer in a skull; but\nI'll ask you for a little of that nice bread and butter.'\n\nWith which accordingly Lady Knollys was quickly supplied; but it did not at\nall impede her utterance.\n\n'Do you think, girls, you could be ready to come away with me, if Silas\ngives leave, in an hour or two? I should so like to take you both home with\nme to Elverston.'\n\n'How delightful! you darling,' cried I, embracing and kissing her; 'for my\npart, I should be ready in five minutes; what do you say, Milly?'\n\nPoor Milly's wardrobe, I am afraid, was more portable than handsome; and\nshe looked horribly affrighted, and whispered in my ear--\n\n'My best petticoat is away at the laundress; say in a week, Maud.'\n\n'What does she say?' asked Lady Knollys.\n\n'She fears she can't be ready,' I answered, dejectedly.\n\n'There's a deal of my slops in the wash,' blurted out poor Milly, staring\nstraight at Lady Knollys.\n\n'In the name of wonder, what does my cousin mean?' asked Lady Knollys.\n\n'Her things have not come home yet from the laundress,' I replied; and at\nthis moment our wondrous old butler entered to announce to Lady Knollys\nthat his master was ready to receive her, whenever she was disposed to\nfavour him; and also to make polite apologies for his being compelled, by\nhis state of health, to give her the trouble of ascending to his room.\n\nSo Cousin Monica was at the door in a moment, over her shoulder calling to\nus, 'Come, girls.'\n\n'Please, not yet, my lady--you alone; and he requests the young ladies will\nbe in the way, as he will send for them presently.'\n\nI began to admire poor 'Giblets' as the wreck of a tolerably respectable\nservant.\n\n'Very good; perhaps it is better we should kiss and be friends in private\nfirst,' said Cousin Knollys, laughing; and away she went under the guidance\nof the mummy.\n\nI had an account of this _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ afterwards from Lady Knollys.\n\n'When I saw him, my dear,' she said, 'I could hardly believe my eyes; such\nwhite hair--such a white face--such mad eyes--such a death-like smile.\nWhen I saw him last, his hair was dark; he dressed himself like a modern\nEnglishman; and he really preserved a likeness to the full-length portrait\nat Knowl, that you fell in love with, you know; but, angels and ministers\nof grace! such a spectre! I asked myself, is it necromancy, or is it\ndelirium tremens that has reduced him to this? And said he, with that\nodious smile, that made me fancy myself half insane--\n\n'\"You see a change, Monica.\"\n\n'What a sweet, gentle, insufferable voice he has! Somebody once told me\nabout the tone of a glass flute that made some people hysterical to listen\nto, and I was thinking of it all the time. There was always a peculiar\nquality in his voice.\n\n'\"I do see a change, Silas,\" I said at last; \"and, no doubt, so do you in\nme--a great change.\"\n\n'\"There has been time enough to work a greater than I observe in you since\nyou last honoured me with a visit,\" said he.\n\n'I think he was at his old sarcasms, and meant that I was the same\nimpertinent minx he remembered long ago, uncorrected by time; and so I am,\nand he must not expect compliments from old Monica Knollys.\n\n'\"It is a long time, Silas; but that, you know, is not my fault,\" said I.\n\n'\"Not your fault, my dear--your instinct. We are all imitative creatures:\nthe great people ostracised me, and the small ones followed. We are very\nlike turkeys, we have so much good sense and so much generosity. Fortune,\nin a freak, wounded my head, and the whole brood were upon me, pecking and\ngobbling, gobbling and pecking, and you among them, dear Monica. It wasn't\nyour fault, only your instinct, so I quite forgive you; but no wonder the\npeckers wear better than the pecked. You are robust; and I, what I am.\"\n\n'\"Now, Silas, I have not come here to quarrel. If we quarrel now, mind, we\ncan never make it up--we are too old, so let us forget all we can, and try\nto forgive something; and if we can do neither, at all events let there be\ntruce between us while I am here.\"\n\n'\"My personal wrongs I can quite forgive, and I do, Heaven knows, from my\nheart; but there are things which ought not to be forgiven. My children\nhave been ruined by it. I may, by the mercy of Providence, be yet set right\nin the world, and so soon as that time comes, I will remember, and I\nwill act; but my children--you will see that wretched girl, my\ndaughter--education, society, all would come too late--my children have\nbeen ruined by it.\"\n\n'\"I have not done it; but I know what you mean,\" I said. \"You menace\nlitigation whenever you have the means; but you forget that Austin placed\nyou under promise, when he gave you the use of this house and place, never\nto disturb my title to Elverston. So there is my answer, if you mean that.\"\n\n'\"I mean what I mean,\" he replied, with his old smile.\n\n'\"You mean then,\" said I, \"that for the pleasure of vexing me with\nlitigation, you are willing to forfeit your tenure of this house and\nplace.\"\n\n'\"Suppose I _did_ mean precisely that, why should I forfeit anything?\nMy beloved brother, by his will, has given me a right to the use of\nBartram-Haugh for my life, and attached no absurd condition of the kind you\nfancy to his gift.\"\n\n'Silas was in one of his vicious old moods, and liked to menace me. His\nvindictiveness got the better of his craft; but he knows as well as I do\nthat he never could succeed in disturbing the title of my poor dear Harry\nKnollys; and I was not at all alarmed by his threats; and I told him so, as\ncoolly as I speak to you now.\n\n'\"Well, Monica,\" he said, \"I have weighed you in the balance, and you are\nnot found wanting. For a moment the old man possessed me: the thought of\nmy children, of past unkindness, and present affliction and disgrace,\nexasperated me, and I was mad. It was but for a moment--the galvanic spasm\nof a corpse. Never was breast more dead than mine to the passions and\nambitions of the world. They are not for white locks like these, nor for\na man who, for a week in every month, lies in the gate of death. Will you\nshake hands? _Here_--I _do_ strike a truce; and I _do_ forget and forgive\n_everything_.\"\n\n'I don't know what he meant by this scene. I have no idea whether he was\nacting, or lost his head, or, in fact, why or how it occurred; but I am\nglad, darling, that, unlike myself, I was calm, and that a quarrel has not\nbeen forced upon me.'\n\nWhen our turn came and we were summoned to the presence, Uncle Silas was\nquite as usual; but Cousin Monica's heightened colour, and the flash of her\neyes, showed plainly that something exciting and angry had occurred.\n\nUncle Silas commented in his own vein upon the effect of Bartram air and\nliberty, all he had to offer; and called on me to say how I liked them. And\nthen he called Milly to him, kissed her tenderly, smiled sadly upon her,\nand turning to Cousin Monica, said--\n\n'This is my daughter Milly--oh! she has been presented to you down-stairs,\nhas she? You have, no doubt, been interested by her. As I told her cousin\nMaud, though I am not yet quite a Sir Tunbelly Clumsy, she is a very\nfinished Miss Hoyden. Are not you, my poor Milly? You owe your distinction,\nmy dear, to that line of circumvallation which has, ever since your birth,\nintercepted all civilisation on its way to Bartram. You are much obliged,\nMilly, to everybody who, whether naturally or _un_-naturally, turned a sod\nin that invisible, but impenetrable, work. For your accomplishments--rather\nsingular than fashionable--you are indebted, in part, to your cousin, Lady\nKnollys. Is not she, Monica? _Thank_ her, Milly.'\n\n'This is your _truce_, Silas,' said Lady Knollys, with a quiet sharpness.\n'I think, Silas Ruthyn, you want to provoke me to speak in a way before\nthese young creatures which we should all regret.'\n\n'So my badinage excites your temper, Monnie. Think how you _would_ feel,\nthen, if I had found you by the highway side, mangled by robbers, and set\nmy foot upon your throat, and spat in your face. But--stop this. Why have I\nsaid this? simply to emphasize my forgiveness. See, girls, Lady Knollys and\nI, cousins long estranged, forget and forgive the past, and join hands over\nits buried injuries.'\n\n'Well, _be_ it so; only let us have done with ironies and covert taunts.'\n\nAnd with these words their hands were joined; and Uncle Silas, after he had\nreleased hers, patted and fondled it with his, laughing icily and very low\nall the time.\n\n'I wish so much, dear Monica,' he said, when this piece of silent by-play\nwas over, 'that I could ask you to stay to-night; but absolutely I have not\na bed to offer, and even if I had, I fear my suit would hardly prevail.'\n\nThen came Lady Knollys' invitation for Milly and me. He was very much\nobliged; he smiled over it a great deal, meditating. I thought he was\npuzzled; and amid his smiles, his wild eyes scanned Cousin Monica's frank\nface once or twice suspiciously.\n\nThere was a difficulty--an _undefined_ difficulty--about letting us go that\nday; but on a future one--soon--_very_ soon--he would be most happy.\n\nWell, there was an end of that little project, for to-day at least; and\nCousin Monica was too well-bred to urge it beyond a certain point.\n\n'Milly, my dear, will you put on your hat and show me the grounds about the\nhouse? May she, Silas? I should like to renew my acquaintance.'\n\n'You'll see them sadly neglected, Monnie. A poor man's pleasure grounds\nmust rely on Nature, and trust to her for effects. Where there is fine\ntimber, however, and abundance of slope, and rock, and hollow, we sometimes\ngain in picturesqueness what we lose by neglect in luxury.'\n\nThen, as Cousin Monica said she would cross the grounds by a path, and meet\nher carriage at a point to which we would accompany her, and so make her\nway home, she took leave of Uncle Silas; a ceremony whereat--without, I\nthought, much zeal at either side--a kiss took place.\n\n'Now, girls!' said Cousin Knollys, when we were fairly in motion over the\ngrass, 'what do you say--will he let you come--yes or no? I can't say, but\nI think, dear,'--this to Milly--' he ought to let you see a little more of\nthe world than appears among the glens and bushes of Bartram. Very pretty\nthey are, like yourself; but very wild, and very little seen. Where is your\nbrother, Milly; is not he older than you?'\n\n'I don't know where; and he is older by six years and a bit.'\n\nBy-and-by, when Milly was gesticulating to frighten some herons by the\nriver's brink into the air, Cousin Monica said confidentially to me--\n\n'He has run away, I'm told--I wish I could believe it--and enlisted in a\nregiment going to India, perhaps the best thing for him. Did you see him\nhere before his judicious self-banishment?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Well, I suppose you have had no loss. Doctor Bryerly says from all he can\nlearn he is a very bad young man. And now tell me, dear, _is_ Silas kind to\nyou?'\n\n'Yes, always gentle, just as you saw him to-day; but we don't see a great\ndeal of him--very little, in fact.'\n\n'And how do you like your life and the people?' she asked.\n\n'My life, very well; and the people, _pretty_ well. There's an old women we\ndon't like, old Wyat, she is cross and mysterious and tells untruths; but I\ndon't think she is dishonest--so Mary Quince says--and that, you know, is a\npoint; and there is a family, father and daughter, called Hawkes, who live\nin the Windmill Wood, who are perfect savages, though my uncle says they\ndon't mean it; but they are very disagreeable, rude people; and except them\nwe see very little of the servants or other people. But there has been a\nmysterious visit; some one came late at night, and remained for some days,\nthough Milly and I never saw them, and Mary Quince saw a chaise at the\nside-door at two o'clock at night.'\n\nCousin Monica was so highly interested at this that she arrested her walk\nand stood facing me, with her hand on my arm, questioning and listening,\nand lost, as it seemed, in dismal conjecture.\n\n'It is not pleasant, you know,' I said.\n\n'No, it is not pleasant,' said Lady Knollys, very gloomily.\n\nAnd just then Milly joined us, shouting to us to look at the herons flying;\nso Cousin Monica did, and smiled and nodded in thanks to Milly, and was\nagain silent and thoughtful as we walked on.\n\n'You are to come to me, mind, both of you girls,' she said, abruptly;' you\n_shall_. I'll manage it.'\n\nWhen silence returned, and Milly ran away once more to try whether the old\ngray trout was visible in the still water under the bridge, Cousin Monica\nsaid to me in a low tone, looking hard at me--\n\n'You've not seen anything to frighten you, Maud? Don't look so alarmed,\ndear,' she added with a little laugh, which was not very merry, however. 'I\ndon't mean frighten in any awful sense--in fact, I did not mean frighten\nat all. I meant--I can't exactly express it--anything to vex, or make you\nuncomfortable; have you?'\n\n'No, I can't say I have, except that room in which Mr. Charke was found\ndead.'\n\n'Oh! you saw that, did you?--I should like to see it so much. Your bedroom\nis not near it?'\n\n'Oh, no; on the floor beneath, and looking to the front. And Doctor Bryerly\ntalked a little to me, and there seemed to be something on his mind more\nthan he chose to tell me; so that for some time after I saw him I really\nwas, as you say, frightened; but, except that, I really have had no cause.\nAnd what was in your mind when you asked me?'\n\n'Well, you know, Maud, you are afraid of ghosts, banditti, and\n_every_thing; and I wished to know whether you were uncomfortable, and what\nyour particular bogle was just now--that, I assure you, was all; and I\nknow,' she continued, suddenly changing her light tone and manner for one\nof pointed entreaty, 'what Doctor Bryerly said; and I _implore_ of you,\nMaud, to think of it seriously; and when you come to me, you shall do so\nwith the intention of remaining at Elverston.'\n\n'Now, Cousin Monica, is this fair? You and Doctor Bryerly both talk in the\nsame awful way to me; and I assure you, you don't know how nervous I am\nsometimes, and yet you won't, either of you, say what you mean. Now,\nMonica, dear cousin, won't you tell me?'\n\n'You see, dear, it is so lonely; it's a strange place, and he so odd. I\ndon't like the place, and I don't like him. I've tried, but I can't, and I\nthink I never shall. He may be a very--what was it that good little silly\ncurate at Knowl used to call him?--a very advanced Christian--that is it,\nand I hope he is; but if he is only what he used to be, his utter seclusion\nfrom society removes the only check, except personal fear--and he never had\nmuch of that--upon a very bad man. And you must know, my dear Maud, what a\nprize you are, and what an immense trust it is.'\n\nSuddenly Cousin Monica stopped short, and looked at me as if she had gone\ntoo far.\n\n'But, you know, Silas may be very good _now_, although he was wild and\nselfish in his young days. Indeed I don't know what to make of him; but I\nam sure when you have thought it over, you will agree with me and Doctor\nBryerly, that you must not stay here.'\n\nIt was vain trying to induce my cousin to be more explicit.\n\n'I hope to see you at Elverston in a very few days. I will _shame_ Silas\ninto letting you come. I don't like his reluctance.'\n\n'But don't you think he must know that Milly would require some little\noutfit before her visit?'\n\n'Well, I can't say. I hope that is all; but be it what it may, I'll\n_make_ him let you come, and _immediately_, too.' After she had gone, I\nexperienced a repetition of those undefined doubts which had tortured me\nfor some time after my conversation with Dr. Bryerly. I had truly said,\nhowever, I was well enough contented with my mode of life here, for I had\nbeen trained at Knowl to a solitude very nearly as profound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n_IN WHICH I MAKE ANOTHER COUSIN'S ACQUAINTANCE_\n\n\nMy correspondence about this time was not very extensive. About once a\nfortnight a letter from honest Mrs. Rusk conveyed to me how the dogs and\nponies were, in queer English, oddly spelt; some village gossip, a critique\nupon Doctor Clay's or the Curate's last sermon, and some severities\ngenerally upon the Dissenters' doings, with loves to Mary Quince, and all\ngood wishes to me. Sometimes a welcome letter from cheerful Cousin Monica;\nand now, to vary the series, a copy of complimentary verses, without a\nsignature, very adoring--very like Byron, I then fancied, and now, I must\nconfess, rather vapid. Could I doubt from whom they came?\n\nI had received, about a month after my arrival, a copy of verses in the\nsame hand, in a plaintive ballad style, of the soldierly sort, in which the\nwriter said, that as living his sole object was to please me, so dying I\nshould be his latest thought; and some more poetic impieties, asking only\nin return that when the storm of battle had swept over, I should 'shed\na tear' on seeing 'the _oak lie_, where it fell.' Of course, about\nthis lugubrious pun, there could be no misconception. The Captain was\nunmistakably indicated; and I was so moved that I could no longer retain\nmy secret; but walking with Milly that day, confided the little romance to\nthat unsophisticated listener, under the chestnut trees. The lines were so\namorously dejected, and yet so heroically redolent of blood and gunpowder,\nthat Milly and I agreed that the writer must be on the verge of a\nsanguinary campaign.\n\nIt was not easy to get at Uncle Silas's 'Times' or 'Morning Post,' which we\nfancied would explain these horrible allusions; but Milly bethought her of\na sergeant in the militia, resident in Feltram, who knew the destination\nand quarters of every regiment in the service; and circuitously, from\nthis authority, we learned, to my infinite relief, that Captain Oakley's\nregiment had still two years to sojourn in England.\n\nI was summoned one evening by old L'Amour, to my uncle's room. I remember\nhis appearance that evening so well, as he lay back in his chair; the\npillow; the white glare of his strange eye; his feeble, painful smile.\n\n'You'll excuse my not rising, dear Maud, I am so miserably ill this\nevening.'\n\nI expressed my respectful condolence.\n\n'Yes; I _am_ to be pitied; but pity is of no use, dear,' he murmured,\npeevishly. 'I sent for you to make you acquainted with your cousin, my son.\nWhere are you Dudley?'\n\nA figure seated in a low lounging chair, at the other side of the fire, and\nwhich till then I had not observed, at these words rose up a little slowly,\nlike a man stiff after a day's hunting; and I beheld with a shock that held\nmy breath, and fixed my eyes upon him in a stare, the young man whom I had\nencountered at Church Scarsdale, on the day of my unpleasant excursion\nthere with Madame, and who, to the best of my belief, was also one of that\nruffianly party who had so unspeakably terrified me in the warren at Knowl.\n\nI suppose I looked very much affrighted. If I had been looking at a ghost I\ncould not have felt much more scared and incredulous.\n\nWhen I was able to turn my eyes upon my uncle he was not looking at me; but\nwith a glimmer of that smile with which a father looks on a son whose youth\nand comeliness he admires, his white face was turned towards the young man,\nin whom I beheld nothing but the image of odious and dreadful associations.\n\n'Come, sir,' said my uncle, we must not be too modest. Here's your cousin\nMaud--what do you say?'\n\n'How are ye, Miss?' he said, with a sheepish grin.\n\n'Miss! Come, come. Miss us, no Misses,' said my uncle; 'she is Maud, and\nyou Dudley, or I mistake; or we shall have you calling Milly, madame.\nShe'll not refuse you her hand, I venture to think. Come, young gentleman,\nspeak for yourself.'\n\n'How are ye, Maud?' he said, doing his best, and drawing near, he extended\nhis hand.' You're welcome to Bartram-Haugh, Miss.'\n\n'Kiss your cousin, sir. Where's your gallantry? On my honour, I disown\nyou,' exclaimed my uncle, with more energy than he had shown before.\n\nWith a clumsy effort, and a grin that was both sheepish and impudent, he\ngrasped my hand and advanced his face. The imminent salute gave me strength\nto spring back a step or two, and he hesitated.\n\nMy uncle laughed peevishly.\n\n'Well, well, that will do, I suppose. In my time first-cousins did not meet\nlike strangers; but perhaps we were wrong; we are learning modesty from the\nAmericans, and old English ways are too gross for us.'\n\n'I have--I've seen him before--that is;' and at this point I stopped.\n\nMy uncle turned his strange glare, in a sort of scowl of enquiry, upon me.\n\n'Oh!--hey! why this is news. You never told me. Where have you met--eh,\nDudley?'\n\n'Never saw her in my days, so far as I'm aweer on,' said the young man.\n\n'No! Well, then, Maud, will _you_ enlighten us?' said Uncle Silas, coldly.\n\n'I _did_ see that young gentleman before,' I faltered.\n\n'Meaning _me_, ma'am?' he asked, coolly.\n\n'Yes--certainly _you_. I _did_, uncle,' answered I.\n\n'And where was it, my dear? Not at Knowl, I fancy. Poor dear Austin did not\ntrouble me or mine much with his hospitalities.'\n\nThis was not a pleasant tone to take in speaking of his dead brother and\nbenefactor; but at the moment I was too much engaged upon the one point to\nobserve it.\n\n'I met'--I could not say my cousin--'I met him, uncle--your son--that young\ngentleman--I _saw_ him, I should say, at Church Scarsdale, and afterwards\nwith some other persons in the warren at Knowl. It was the night our\ngamekeeper was beaten.'\n\n'Well, Dudley, what do you say to that?' asked Uncle Silas.\n\n'I never _was_ at them places, so help me. I don't know where they be; and\nI never set eyes on the young lady before, as I hope to be saved, in all\nmy days,' said he, with a countenance so unchanged and an air so confident\nthat I began to think I must be the dupe of one of those strange\nresemblances which have been known to lead to positive identification in\nthe witness-box, afterwards proved to be utterly mistaken.\n\n'You look so--so _uncomfortable_, Maud, at the idea of having seen him\nbefore, that I hardly wonder at the vehemence of his denial. There was\nplainly something disagreeable; but you see as respects him it is a total\nmistake. My boy was always a truth-telling fellow--you may rely implicitly\non what he says. You were _not_ at those places?'\n\n'I wish I may----,' began the ingenuous youth, with increased vehemence.\n\n'There, there--that will do; your honour and word as a gentleman--and\n_that_ you are, though a poor one--will quite satisfy your cousin Maud. Am\nI right, my dear? I do assure you, as a gentleman, I never knew him to say\nthe thing that was not.'\n\nSo Mr. Dudley Ruthyn began, not to curse, but to swear, in the prescribed\nform, that he had never seen me before, or the places I had named, 'since I\nwas weaned, by----'\n\n'That's enough--now shake hands, if you won't kiss, like cousins,'\ninterrupted my uncle.\n\nAnd very uncomfortably I did lend him my hand to shake.\n\n'You'll want some supper, Dudley, so Maud and I will excuse your going.\nGood-night, my dear boy,' and he smiled and waved him from the room.\n\n'That's as fine a young fellow, I think, as any English father can boast\nfor his son--true, brave, and kind, and quite an Apollo. Did you observe\nhow finely proportioned he is, and what exquisite features the fellow has?\nHe's rustic and rough, as you see; but a year or two in the militia--I've a\npromise of a commission for him--he's too old for the line--will form and\npolish him. He wants nothing but manner; and I protest when he has had a\nlittle drilling of that kind, I do believe he'll be as pretty a fellow as\nyou'd find in England.'\n\nI listened with amazement. I could discover nothing but what was\ndisagreeable in the horrid bumpkin, and thought such an instance of the\nblindness of parental partiality was hardly credible.\n\nI looked down, dreading another direct appeal to my judgment; and Uncle\nSilas, I suppose, referred those downcast looks to maiden modesty, for he\nforbore to task mine by any new interrogatory.\n\nDudley Ruthyn's cool and resolute denial of ever having seen me or the\nplaces I had named, and the inflexible serenity of his countenance while\ndoing so, did very much shake my confidence in my own identification of\nhim. I could not be _quite_ certain that the person I had seen at Church\nScarsdale was the very same whom I afterwards saw at Knowl. And now, in\nthis particular instance, after the lapse of a still longer period, could I\nbe perfectly certain that my memory, deceived by some accidental points of\nresemblance, had not duped me, and wronged my cousin, Dudley Ruthyn?\n\nI suppose my uncle had expected from me some signs of acquiesence in his\nsplendid estimate of his cub, and was nettled at my silence. After a short\ninterval he said--\n\n'I've seen something of the world in my day, and I can say without a\nmisgiving of partiality, that Dudley is the material of a perfect English\ngentleman. I am not blind, of course--the training must be supplied; a year\nor two of good models, active self-criticism, and good society. I simply\nsay that the _material_ is there.'\n\nHere was another interval of silence.\n\n'And now tell me, child, what these recollections of\nChurch--Church--_what_?'\n\n'Church Scarsdale,' I replied.\n\n'Yes, thank you--Church Scarsdale and Knowl--are?'\n\nSo I related my stories as well as I could.\n\n'Well, dear Maud, the adventure of Church Scarsdale is hardly so terrific\nas I expected,' said Uncle Silas with a cold little laugh; 'and I don't\nsee, if he had really been the hero of it, why he should shrink from\navowing it. I know I should not. And I really can't say that your pic-nic\nparty in the grounds of Knowl has frightened me much more. A lady waiting\nin the carriage, and two or three tipsy young men. Her presence seems to\nme a guarantee that no mischief was meant; but champagne is the soul of\nfrolic, and a row with the gamekeepers a natural consequence. It happened\nto me once--forty years ago, when I was a wild young buck--one of the worst\nrows I ever was in.'\n\nAnd Uncle Silas poured some eau-de-cologne over the corner of his\nhandkerchief, and touched his temples with it.\n\n'If my boy had been there, I do assure you--and I know him--he would say so\nat once. I fancy he would rather _boast_ of it. I never knew him utter an\nuntruth. When you know him a little you'll say so.'\n\nWith these words Uncle Silas leaned back exhausted, and languidly poured\nsome of his favourite eau-de-cologne over the palms of his hands, nodded a\nfarewell, and, in a whisper, wished me good-night.\n\n'Dudley's come,' whispered Milly, taking me under the arm as I entered the\nlobby. 'But I don't care: he never gives me nout; and he gets money from\nGovernor, as much as he likes, and I never a sixpence. It's a shame!'\n\nSo there was no great love between the only son and only daughter of the\nyounger line of the Ruthyns.\n\nI was curious to learn all that Milly could tell me of this new inmate of\nBartram-Haugh; and Milly was communicative without having a great deal to\nrelate, and what I heard from her tended to confirm my own disagreeable\nimpressions about him. She was afraid of him. He was a 'woundy ugly\ncustomer in a wax, she could tell me.' He was the only one 'she ever knowed\nas had pluck to jaw the Governor.' But he was 'afeard on the Governor,\ntoo.'\n\nHis visits to Bartram-Haugh, I heard, were desultory; and this, to my\nrelief, would probably not outlast a week or a fortnight. 'He _was_ such a\nfashionable cove:' he was always 'a gadding about, mostly to Liverpool and\nBirmingham, and sometimes to Lunnun, itself.' He was 'keeping company\none time with Beauty, Governor thought, and he was awfully afraid he'd a\nmarried her; but that was all bosh and nonsense; and Beauty would have none\nof his chaff and wheedling, for she liked Tom Brice;' and Milly thought\nthat Dudley never 'cared a crack of a whip for her.' He used to go to the\nWindmill to have 'a smoke with Pegtop;' and he was a member of the Feltram\nClub, that met at the 'Plume o' Feathers.' He was 'a rare good shot,' she\nheard; and 'he was before the justices for poaching, but they could make\nnothing of it.' And the Governor said 'it was all through spite of him--for\nthey hate us for being better blood than they.' And 'all but the squires\nand those upstart folk loves Dudley, he is so handsome and gay--though he\nbe a bit cross at home.' And, 'Governor says, he'll be a Parliament man\nyet, spite o' them all.'\n\nNext morning, when our breakfast was nearly ended, Dudley tapped at the\nwindow with the end of his clay pipe--a 'churchwarden' Milly called\nit--just such a long curved pipe as Joe Willet is made to hold between his\nlips in those charming illustrations of 'Barnaby Rudge'--which we all know\nso well--and lifting his 'wide-awake' with a burlesque salutation, which, I\nsuppose, would have charmed the 'Plume of Feathers,' he dropped, kicked and\ncaught his 'wide-awake,' with an agility and gravity, as he replaced it, so\ninexpressibly humorous, that Milly went off in a loud fit of laughter, with\nthe ejaculation--\n\n'Did you ever?'\n\nIt was odd how repulsively my confidence in my original identification\nalways revived on unexpectedly seeing Dudley after an interval.\n\nI could perceive that this piece of comic by-play was meant to make a\nsuitable impression on me. I received it, however, with a killing gravity;\nand after a word or two to Milly, he lounged away, having first broken his\npipe, bit by bit, into pieces, which he balanced in turn on his nose and\non his chin, from which features he jerked them into his mouth, with a\nprecision which, along with his excellent pantomime of eating them, highly\nexcited Milly's mirth and admiration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n_MY COUSIN DUDLEY_\n\n\nGreatly to my satisfaction, this engaging person did not appear again that\nday. But next day Milly told me that my uncle had taken him to task for the\nneglect with which he was treating us.\n\n'He did pitch into him, sharp and short, and not a word from him, only\nsulky like; and I so frightened, I durst not look up almost; and they said\na lot I could not make head or tail of; and Governor ordered me out o' the\nroom, and glad I was to go; and so they had it out between them.'\n\nMilly could throw no light whatsoever upon the adventures at Church\nScarsdale and Knowl; and I was left still in doubt, which sometimes\noscillated one way and sometimes another. But, on the whole, I could\nnot shake off the misgivings which constantly recurred and pointed very\nobstinately to Dudley as the hero of those odious scenes.\n\nOddly enough, though, I now felt far less confident upon the point than I\ndid at first sight. I had begun to distrust my memory, and to suspect my\nfancy; but of this there could be no question, that between the person so\nunpleasantly linked in my remembrance with those scenes, and Dudley Ruthyn,\na striking, though possibly only a general resemblance did exist.\n\nMilly was certainly right as to the gist of Uncle Silas's injunction, for\nwe saw more of Dudley henceforward.\n\nHe was shy; he was impudent; he was awkward; he was conceited;--altogether\na most intolerable bumpkin. Though he sometimes flushed and stammered, and\nnever for a moment was at his ease in my presence, yet, to my inexpressible\ndisgust, there was a self-complacency in his manner, and a kind of triumph\nin his leer, which very plainly told me how satisfied he was as to the\nnature of the impression he was making upon me.\n\nI would have given worlds to tell him how odious I thought him. Probably,\nhowever, he would not have believed me. Perhaps he fancied that 'ladies'\naffected airs of indifference and repulsion to cover their real feelings. I\nnever looked at or spoke to him when I could avoid either, and then it was\nas briefly as I could. To do him justice, however, he seemed to have no\nliking for our society, and certainly never seemed altogether comfortable\nin it.\n\nI find it hard to write quite impartially even of Dudley Ruthyn's personal\nappearance; but, with an effort, I confess that his features were good, and\nhis figure not amiss, though a little fattish. He had light whiskers, light\nhair, and a pink complexion, and very good blue eyes. So far my uncle was\nright; and if he had been perfectly gentlemanlike, he really might have\npassed for a handsome man in the judgment of some critics.\n\nBut there was that odious mixture of _mauvaise honte_ and impudence, a\nclumsiness, a slyness, and a consciousness in his bearing and countenance,\nnot distinctly boorish, but _low_, which turned his good looks into an\nugliness more intolerable than that of feature; and a corresponding\nvulgarity pervading his dress, his demeanour, and his very walk, marred\nwhatever good points his figure possessed. If you take all this into\naccount, with the ominous and startling misgivings constantly recurring,\nyou will understand the mixed feelings of anger and disgust with which I\nreceived the admiration he favoured me with.\n\nGradually he grew less constrained in my presence, and certainly his\nmanners were not improved by his growing ease and confidence.\n\nHe came in while Milly and I were at luncheon, jumped up, with a\n'right-about face' performed in the air, sitting on the sideboard, whence\ngrinning slyly and kicking his heels, he leered at us.\n\n'Will you have something, Dudley?' asked Milly.\n\n'No, lass; but I'll look at ye, and maybe drink a drop for company.'\n\nAnd with these words, he took a sportsman's flask from his pocket; and\nhelping himself to a large glass and a decanter, he compounded a glass of\nstrong brandy-and-water, as he talked, and refreshed himself with it from\ntime to time.\n\n'Curate's up wi' the Governor,' he said, with a grin. 'I wanted a word wi'\nhim; but I s'pose I'll hardly git in this hour or more; they're a praying\nand disputing, and a Bible-chopping, as usual. Ha, ha! But 'twon't hold\nmuch longer, old Wyat says, now that Uncle Austin's dead; there's nout to\nbe made o' praying and that work no longer, and it don't pay of itself.'\n\n'O fie! For shame, you sinner!' laughed Milly. 'He wasn't in a church these\nfive years, he says, and then only to meet a young lady. Now, isn't he a\nsinner, Maud--isn't he?'\n\nDudley, grinning, looked with a languishing slyness at me, biting the edge\nof his wide-awake, which he held over his breast.\n\nDudley Ruthyn probably thought there was a manly and desperate sort of\nfascination in the impiety he professed.\n\n'I wonder, Milly,' said I, 'at your laughing. How _can_ you laugh?'\n\n'You'd have me cry, would ye?' answered Milly.\n\n'I certainly would not have you laugh,' I replied.\n\n'I know I wish _some_ one 'ud cry for me, and I know who,' said Dudley, in\nwhat he meant for a very engaging way, and he looked at me as if he thought\nI must feel flattered by his caring to have my tears.\n\nInstead of crying, however, I leaned back in my chair, and began quietly to\nturn over the pages of Walter Scott's poems, which I and Milly were then\nreading in the evenings.\n\nThe tone in which this odious young man spoke of his father, his coarse\nmention of mine, and his low boasting of his irreligion, disgusted me more\nthan ever with him.\n\n'They parsons be slow coaches--awful slow. I'll have a good bit to wait, I\ns'pose. I should be three miles away and more by this time--drat it!' He\nwas eyeing the legging of the foot which he held up while he spoke, as if\ncalculating how far away that limb should have carried him by this time.\n'Why can't folk do their Bible and prayers o' Sundays, and get it off\ntheir stomachs? I say, Milly lass, will ye see if Governor be done wi' the\nCurate? Do. I'm a losing the whole day along o' him.'\n\nMilly jumped up, accustomed to obey her brother, and as she passed me,\nwhispered, with a wink--\n\n'_Money_.'\n\nAnd away she went. Dudley whistled a tune, and swung his foot like a\npendulum, as he followed her with his side-glance.\n\n'I say, it is a hard case, Miss, a lad o' spirit should be kept so tight. I\nhaven't a shilling but what comes through his fingers; an' drat the tizzy\nhe'll gi' me till he knows the reason why.'\n\n'Perhaps,' I said, 'my uncle thinks you should earn some for yourself.'\n\n'I'd like to know how a fella's to earn money now-a-days. You wouldn't have\na gentleman to keep a shop, I fancy. But I'll ha' a fistful jist now, and\nno thanks to he. Them executors, you know, owes me a deal o' money. Very\nhonest chaps, of course; but they're cursed slow about paying, I know.'\n\nI made no remark upon this elegant allusion to the executors of my dear\nfather's will.\n\n'An' I tell ye, Maud, when I git the tin, I know who I'll buy a farin' for.\nI do, lass.'\n\nThe odious creature drawled this with a sidelong leer, which, I suppose, he\nfancied quite irresistible.\n\nI am one of those unfortunate persons who always blushed when I most\nwished to look indifferent; and now, to my inexpressible chagrin, with its\naccustomed perversity, I felt the blush mount to my cheeks, and glow even\non my forehead.\n\nI saw that he perceived this most disconcerting indication of a sentiment\nthe very idea of which was so detestable, that, equally enraged with myself\nand with him, I did not know how to exhibit my contempt and indignation.\n\nMistaking the cause of my discomposure, Mr. Dudley Ruthyn laughed softly,\nwith an insufferable suavity.\n\n'And there's some'at, lass, I must have in return. Honour thy father, you\nknow; you would not ha' me disobey the Governor? No, you wouldn't--would\nye?'\n\nI darted at him a look which I hoped would have quelled his impertinence;\nbut I blushed most provokingly--more violently than ever.\n\n'I'd back them eyes again' the county, I would,' he exclaimed, with a\ncondescending enthusiasm. 'You're awful pretty, you are, Maud. I don't know\nwhat came over me t'other night when Governor told me to buss ye; but dang\nit, ye shan't deny me now, and I'll have a kiss, lass, in spite o' thy\nblushes.'\n\nHe jumped from his elevated seat on the sideboard, and came swaggering\ntoward me, with an odious grin, and his arms extended. I started to my\nfeet, absolutely transported with fury.\n\n'Drat me, if she baint a-going to fight me!' he chuckled humorously.\n\n'Come, Maud, you would not be ill-natured, sure? Arter all, it's only our\nduty. Governor bid us kiss, didn't he?'\n\n'Don't--_don't_, sir. Stand back, or I'll call the servants.'\n\nAnd as it was I began to scream for Milly.\n\n'There's how it is wi' all they cattle! You never knows your own mind--ye\ndon't,' he said, surlily. 'You make such a row about a bit o' play. Drop\nit, will you? There's no one a-harming you--is there? _I_'m not, for\nsartain.'\n\nAnd, with an angry chuckle, he turned on his heel, and left the room.\n\nI think I was perfectly right to resist, with all the vehemence of which I\nwas capable, this attempt to assume an intimacy which, notwithstanding my\nuncle's opinion to the contrary, seemed to me like an outrage.\n\nMilly found me alone--not frightened, but very angry. I had quite made up\nmy mind to complain to my uncle, but the Curate was still with him; and,\nby the time he had gone, I was cooler. My awe of my uncle had returned. I\nfancied that he would treat the whole affair as a mere playful piece of\ngallantry. So, with the comfortable conviction that he had had a lesson,\nand would think twice before repeating his impertinence, I resolved, with\nMilly's approbation, to leave matters as they were.\n\nDudley, greatly to my comfort, was huffed with me, and hardly appeared, and\nwas sulky and silent when he did. I lived then in the pleasant anticipation\nof his departure, which, Milly thought, would be very soon.\n\nMy uncle had his Bible and his consolations; but it cannot have been\npleasant to this old _rou\u00c3\u00a9_, converted though he was--this refined man\nof fashion--to see his son grow up an outcast, and a Tony Lumpkin; for\nwhatever he may have thought of his natural gifts, he must have known how\nmere a boor he was.\n\nI try to recall my then impressions of my uncle's character. Grizzly and\nchaotic the image rises--silver head, feet of clay. I as yet knew little of\nhim.\n\nI began to perceive that he was what Mary Quince used to call 'dreadful\nparticular'--I suppose a little selfish and impatient. He used to get cases\nof turtle from Liverpool. He drank claret and hock for his health, and ate\nwoodcock and other light and salutary dainties for the same reason; and\nwas petulant and vicious about the cooking of these, and the flavour and\nclearness of his coffee.\n\nHis conversation was easy, polished, and, with a sentimental glazing, cold;\nbut across this artificial talk, with its French rhymes, racy phrases,\nand fluent eloquence, like a streak of angry light, would, at intervals,\nsuddenly gleam some dismal thought of religion. I never could quite satisfy\nmyself whether they were affectations or genuine, like intermittent thrills\nof pain.\n\nThe light of his large eyes was very peculiar. I can liken it to nothing\nbut the sheen of intense moonlight on burnished metal. But that cannot\nexpress it. It glared white and suddenly--almost fatuous. I thought of\nMoore's lines whenever I looked on it:--\n\n  Oh, ye dead! oh, ye dead! whom we know by the light you give\n  From your cold gleaming eyes, though you move like men who live.\n\nI never saw in any other eye the least glimmer of the same baleful\neffulgence. His fits, too--his hoverings between life and death--between\nintellect and insanity--a dubious, marsh-fire existence, horrible to look\non!\n\nI was puzzled even to comprehend his feelings toward his children.\nSometimes it seemed to me that he was ready to lay down his soul for them;\nat others, he looked and spoke almost as if he hated them. He talked as if\nthe image of death was always before him, yet he took a terrible interest\nin life, while seemingly dozing away the dregs of his days in sight of his\ncoffin.\n\nOh! Uncle Silas, tremendous figure in the past, burning always in memory in\nthe same awful lights; the fixed white face of scorn and anguish! It\nseems as if the Woman of Endor had led me to that chamber and showed me a\nspectre.\n\nDudley had not left Bartram-Haugh when a little note reached me from Lady\nKnollys. It said--\n\n'DEAREST MAUD,--I have written by this post to Silas, beseeching a loan of\nyou and my Cousin Milly. I see no reason your uncle can possibly have for\nrefusing me; and, therefore, I count confidently on seeing you both at\nElverston to-morrow, to stay for at least a week. I have hardly a creature\nto meet you. I have been disappointed in several visitors; but another time\nwe shall have a gayer house. Tell Milly--with my love--that I will not\nforgive her if she fails to accompany you.\n\n'Believe me ever your affectionate cousin,\n\n'MONICA KNOLLYS.'\n\nMilly and I were both afraid that Uncle Silas would refuse his consent,\nalthough we could not divine any sound reason for his doing so, and there\nwere many in favour of his improving the opportunity of allowing poor Milly\nto see some persons of her own sex above the rank of menials.\n\nAt about twelve o'clock my uncle sent for us, and, to our great delight,\nannounced his consent, and wished us a very happy excursion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n_ELVERSTON AND ITS PEOPLE_\n\n\nSo Milly and I drove through the gabled high street of Feltram next day. We\nsaw my gracious cousin smoking with a man like a groom, at the door of the\n'Plume of Feathers.' I drew myself back as we passed, and Milly popped her\nhead out of the window.\n\n'I'm blessed,' said she, laughing, 'if he hadn't his thumb to his nose, and\nwinding up his little finger, the way he does with old Wyat--L'Amour, ye\nknow; and you may be sure he said something funny, for Jim Jolliter was\nlaughin', with his pipe in his hand.'\n\n'I wish I had not seen him, Milly. I feel as if it were an ill omen. He\nalways looks so cross; and I dare say he wished us some ill,' I said.\n\n'No, no, you don't know Dudley: if he were angry, he'd say nothing that's\nfunny; no, he's not vexed, only shamming vexed.'\n\nThe scenery through which we passed was very pretty. The road brought us\nthrough a narrow and wooded glen. Such studies of ivied rocks and twisted\nroots! A little stream tinkled lonely through the hollow. Poor Milly! In\nher odd way she made herself companionable. I have sometimes fancied an\nenjoyment of natural scenery not so much a faculty as an acquirement. It is\nso exquisite in the instructed, so strangely absent in uneducated humanity.\nBut certainly with Milly it was inborn and hearty; and so she could enter\ninto my raptures, and requite them.\n\nThen over one of those beautiful Derbyshire moors we drove, and so into\na wide wooded hollow, where was our first view of Cousin Monica's pretty\ngabled house, beautified with that indescribable air of shelter and comfort\nwhich belongs to an old English residence, with old timber grouped round\nit, and something in its aspect of the quaint old times and bygone\nmerrymakings, saying sadly, but genially, 'Come in: I bid you welcome.\nFor two hundred years, or more, have I been the home of this beloved old\nfamily, whose generations I have seen in the cradle and in the coffin, and\nwhose mirth and sorrows and hospitalities I remember. All their friends,\nlike you, were welcome; and you, like them, will here enjoy the warm\nillusions that cheat the sad conditions of mortality; and like them you\nwill go your way, and others succeed you, till at last I, too, shall yield\nto the general law of decay, and disappear.'\n\nBy this time poor Milly had grown very nervous; a state which she described\nin such very odd phraseology as threw me, in spite of myself--for I\naffected an impressive gravity in lecturing her upon her language--into a\nhearty fit of laughter.\n\nI must mention, however, that in certain important points Milly was very\nessentially reformed. Her dress, though not very fashionable, was no longer\nabsurd. And I had drilled her into speaking and laughing quietly; and\nfor the rest I trusted to the indulgence which is always, I think, more\nhonestly and easily obtained from well-bred than from under-bred people.\n\nCousin Monica was out when we arrived; but we found that she had arranged a\ndouble-bedded room for me and Milly, greatly to our content; and good Mary\nQuince was placed in the dressing-room beside us.\n\nWe had only just commenced our toilet when our hostess entered, as usual in\nhigh spirits, welcomed and kissed us both again and again. She was, indeed,\nin extraordinary delight, for she had anticipated some stratagem or evasion\nto prevent our visit; and in her usual way she spoke her mind as frankly\nabout Uncle Silas to poor Milly as she used to do of my dear father to me.\n\n'I did not think he would let you come without a battle; and you know if\nhe chose to be obstinate it would not have been easy to get you out of the\nenchanted ground, for so it seems to be with that awful old wizard in the\nmidst of it. I mean, Silas, your papa, my dear. Honestly, is not he very\nlike Michael Scott?'\n\n'I never saw him,' answered poor Milly. 'At least, that I'm aware of,' she\nadded, perceiving us smile. 'But I do think he's a thought like old Michael\nDobbs, that sells the ferrets, maybe you mean him?'\n\n'Why, you told me, Maud, that you and Milly were reading Walter Scott's\npoems. Well, no matter. Michael Scott, my dear, was a dead wizard, with\never so much silvery hair, lying in his grave for ever so many years, with\njust life enough to scowl when they took his book; and you'll find him in\nthe \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" exactly like your papa, my dear. And my\npeople tell me that your brother Dudley has been seen drinking and smoking\nabout Feltram this week. How long does he remain at home? Not very long,\neh? And, Maud, dear, he has not been making love to you? Well, I see; of\ncourse he has. And _apropos_ of love-making, I hope that impudent creature,\nCharles Oakley, has not been teasing you with notes or verses.'\n\n'Indeed but he has though,' interposed Miss Milly; a good deal to my\nchagrin, for I saw no particular reason for placing his verses in Cousin\nMonica's hands. So I confessed the two little copies of verses, with the\nqualification, however, that I did not know from whom they came.\n\n'Well now, dear Maud, have not I told you fifty times over to have nothing\nto say to him? I've found out, my dear, he plays, and he is very much in\ndebt. I've made a vow to pay no more for him. I've been such a fool, you\nhave no notion; and I'm speaking, you know, against myself; it would be\nsuch a relief if he were to find a wife to support him; and he has been,\nI'm told, very sweet upon a rich old maid--a button-maker's sister, in\nManchester.'\n\nThis arrow was well shot.\n\n'But don't be frightened: you are richer as well as younger; and, no doubt,\nwill have your chance first, my dear; and in the meantime, I dare say,\nthose verses, like Falstaff's _billet-doux,_ you know, are doing double\nduty.'\n\nI laughed, but the button-maker was a secret trouble to me; and I would\nhave given I know not what that Captain Oakley were one of the company,\nthat I might treat him with the refined contempt which his deserts and my\ndignity demanded.\n\nCousin Monica busied herself about Milly's toilet, and was a very useful\nlady's maid, chatting in her own way all the time; and, at last, tapping\nMilly under the chin with her finger, she said, very complacently--\n\n'I think I have succeeded, Miss Milly; look in the glass. She really is a\nvery pretty creature.'\n\nAnd Milly blushed, and looked with a shy gratification, which made her\nstill prettier, on the mirror.\n\nMilly indeed was very pretty. She looked much taller now that her dresses\nwere made of the usual length. A little plump she was, beautifully fair,\nwith such azure eyes, and rich hair.\n\n'The more you laugh the better, Milly, for you've got very pretty\nteeth--very pretty; and if you were my daughter, or if your father would\nbecome president of a college of magicians, and give you up to me, I\nventure to say I would place you very well; and even as it is we must try,\nmy dear.'\n\nSo down to the drawing-room we went; and Cousin Monica entered, leading us\nboth by the hands.\n\nBy this time the curtains were closed, and the drawing-room dependent on\nthe pleasant glow of the fire, and the slight provisional illumination\nusual before dinner.\n\n'Here are my two cousins,' began Lady Knollys: 'this is Miss Ruthyn, of\nKnowl, whom I take the liberty of calling Maud; and this is Miss Millicent\nRuthyn, Silas's daughter, you know, whom I venture to call Milly; and they\nare very pretty, as you will see, when we get a little more light, and they\nknow it very well themselves.'\n\nAnd as she spoke, a frank-eyed, gentle, prettyish lady, not so tall as I,\nbut with a very kind face, rose up from a book of prints, and, smiling,\ntook our hands.\n\nShe was by no means young, as I then counted youth--past thirty, I\nsuppose--and with an air that was very quiet, and friendly, and engaging.\nShe had never been a mere fashionable woman plainly; but she had the ease\nand polish of the best society, and seemed to take a kindly interest both\nin Milly and me; and Cousin Monica called her Mary, and sometimes Polly.\nThat was all I knew of her for the present.\n\nSo very pleasantly the time passed by till the dressing-bell rang, and we\nran away to our room.\n\n'Did I say anything very bad?' asked poor Milly, standing exactly before\nme, so soon as our door was shut.\n\n'Nothing, Milly; you are doing admirably.'\n\n'And I do look a great fool, don't I?' she demanded.\n\n'You look extremely pretty, Milly; and not a bit like a fool.'\n\n'I watch everything. I think I'll learn it at last; but it comes a little\ntroublesome at first; and they do talk different from what I used--you were\nquite right there.'\n\nWhen we returned to the drawing-room, we found the party already assembled,\nand chatting, evidently with spirit.\n\nThe village doctor, whose name I forget, a small man, grey, with shrewd\ngrey eyes, sharp and mulberry nose, whose conflagration extended to his\nrugged cheeks, and touched his chin and forehead, was conversing, no doubt\nagreeably, with Mary, as Cousin Monica called her guest.\n\nOver my shoulder, Milly whispered--\n\n'Mr. Carysbroke.'\n\nAnd Milly was quite right: that gentleman chatting with Lady Knollys, his\nelbow resting on the chimney-piece, was, indeed, our acquaintance of the\nWindmill Wood. He instantly recognised us, and met us with his pleased and\nintelligent smile.\n\n'I was just trying to describe to Lady Knollys the charming scenery of the\nWindmill Wood, among which I was so fortunate as to make your acquaintance,\nMiss Ruthyn. Even in this beautiful county I know of nothing prettier.'\n\nThen he sketched it, as it were, with a few light but glowing words.\n\n'What a sweet scene!' said Cousin Monica: 'only think of her never bringing\nme through it. She reserves it, I fancy, for her romantic adventures; and\nyou, I know, are very benevolent, Ilbury, and all that kind of thing; but I\nam not quite certain that you would have walked along that narrow parapet,\nover a river, to visit a sick old woman, if you had not happened to see two\nvery pretty demoiselles on the other side.'\n\n'What an ill-natured speech! I must either forfeit my character for\ndisinterested benevolence, so justly admired, or disavow a motive that does\nsuch infinite credit to my taste,' exclaimed Mr. Carysbroke. 'I think a\ncharitable person would have said that a philanthropist, in prosecuting his\nvirtuous, but perilous vocation, was unexpectedly _rewarded_ by a vision of\nangels.'\n\n'And with these angels loitered away the time which ought to have been\ndevoted to good Mother Hubbard, in her fit of lumbago, and returned without\nhaving set eyes on that afflicted Christian, to amaze his worthy sister\nwith poetic babblings about wood-nymphs and such pagan impieties,' rejoined\nLady Knollys.\n\n'Well, be just,' he replied, laughing; 'did not I go next day and see the\npatient?'\n\n'Yes; next day you went by the same route--in quest of the dryads, I am\nafraid--and were rewarded by the spectacle of Mother Hubbard.'\n\n'Will nobody help a humane man in difficulties?' Mr. Carysbroke appealed.\n\n'I do believe,' said the lady whom as yet I knew only as Mary, 'that every\nword that Monica says is perfectly true.'\n\n'And if it be so, am I not all the more in need of help? Truth is simply\nthe most dangerous kind of defamation, and I really think I'm most cruelly\npersecuted.'\n\nAt this moment dinner was announced, and a meek and dapper little\nclergyman, with smooth pink cheeks, and tresses parted down the middle,\nwhom I had not seen before, emerged from shadow.\n\nThis little man was assigned to Milly, Mr. Carysbroke to me, and I know not\nhow the remaining ladies divided the doctor between them.\n\nThat dinner, the first at Elverston, I remember as a very pleasant repast.\nEveryone talked--it was impossible that conversation should flag where Lady\nKnollys was; and Mr. Carysbroke was very agreeable and amusing. At the\nother side of the table, the little pink curate, I was happy to see, was\nprattling away, with a modest fluency, in an under-tone to Milly, who was\nfollowing my instructions most conscientiously, and speaking in so low a\nkey that I could hardly hear at the opposite side one word she was saying.\n\nThat night Cousin Monica paid us a visit, as we sat chatting by the fire in\nour room; and I told her--\n\n'I have just been telling Milly what an impression she has made. The pretty\nlittle clergyman--_il en est \u00c3\u00a9pris_--he has evidently quite lost his heart\nto her. I dare say he'll preach next Sunday on some of King Solomon's wise\nsayings about the irresistible strength of women.'\n\n'Yes,' said Lady Knollys,' or maybe on the sensible text, \"Whoso findeth\na wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour,\" and so forth. At all\nevents, I may say, Milly, whoso findeth a husband such as he, findeth a\ntolerably good thing. He is an exemplary little creature, second son of Sir\nHarry Biddlepen, with a little independent income of his own, beside his\nchurch revenues of ninety pounds a year; and I don't think a more harmless\nand docile little husband could be found anywhere; and I think, Miss Maud,\n_you_ seemed a good deal interested, too.'\n\nI laughed and blushed, I suppose; and Cousin Monica, skipping after her\nwont to quite another matter, said in her odd frank way--\n\n'And how has Silas been?--not cross, I hope, or very odd. There was a\nrumour that your brother, Dudley, had gone a soldiering to India, Milly, or\nsomewhere; but that was all a story, for he has turned up, just as usual.\nAnd what does he mean to do with himself? He has got some money now--your\npoor father's will, Maud. Surely he doesn't mean to go on lounging and\nsmoking away his life among poachers, and prize-fighters, and worse people.\nHe ought to go to Australia, like Thomas Swain, who, they say, is making a\nfortune--a great fortune--and coming home again. That's what your brother\nDudley should do, if he has either sense or spirit; but I suppose he\nwon't--too long abandoned to idleness and low company--and he'll not have a\nshilling left in a year or two. Does he know, I wonder, that his father has\nserved a notice or something on Dr. Bryerly, telling him to pay sixteen\nhundred pounds of poor Austin's legacy to _him_, and saying that he has\npaid debts of the young man, and holds his acknowledgments to that amount?\nHe won't have a guinea in a year if he stays here. I'd give fifty pounds he\nwas in Van Diemen's Land--not that I care for the cub, Milly, any more than\nyou do; but I really don't see any honest business he has in England.'\n\nMilly gaped in a total puzzle as Lady Knollys rattled on.\n\n'You know, Milly, you must not be talking about this when you go home to\nBartram, because Silas would prevent your coming to me any more if he\nthought I spoke so freely; but I can't help it: so you must promise to be\nmore discreet than I. And I am told that all kinds of claims are about to\nbe pressed against him, now that he is thought to have got some money; and\nhe has been cutting down oak and selling the bark, Doctor Bryerly has been\ntold, in that Windmill Wood; and he has kilns there for burning charcoal,\nand got a man from Lancashire who understands it--Hawk, or something like\nthat.'\n\n'Ay, Hawkes--Dickon Hawkes; that's Pegtop, you know, Maud,' said Milly.\n\n'Well, I dare say; but a man of very bad character, Dr. Bryerly says; and\nhe has written to Mr. Danvers about it--for that is what they call waste,\ncutting down and selling the timber, and the oakbark, and burning the\nwillows, and other trees that are turned into charcoal. It is all _waste_,\nand Dr. Bryerly is about to put a stop to it.'\n\n'Has he got your carriage for you, Maud, and your horses?' asked Cousin\nMonica, suddenly.\n\n'They have not come yet, but in a few weeks, Dudley says, positively--'\n\nCousin Monica laughed a little and shook her head.\n\n'Yes, Maud, the carriage and horses will always be coming in a few weeks,\ntill the time is over; and meanwhile the old travelling chariot and\npost-horses will do very well;' and she laughed a little again.\n\n'That's why the stile's pulled away at the paling, I suppose; and\nBeauty--Meg Hawkes, that is--is put there to stop us going through; for I\noften spied the smoke beyond the windmill,' observed Milly.\n\nCousin Monica listened with interest, and nodded silently.\n\nI was very much shocked. It seemed to me quite incredible. I think Lady\nKnollys read my amazement and my exalted estimate of the heinousness of the\nprocedure in my face, for she said--\n\n'You know we can't quite condemn Silas till we have heard what he has to\nsay. He may have done it in ignorance; or, it is just possible, he may have\nthe right.'\n\n'Quite true. He may have the right to cut down trees at Bartram-Haugh. At\nall events, I am sure he thinks he has,' I echoed.\n\nThe fact was, that I would not avow to myself a suspicion of Uncle Silas.\nAny falsehood there opened an abyss beneath my feet into which I dared not\nlook.\n\n'And now, dear girls, good-night. You must be tired. We breakfast at a\nquarter past nine--not too early for you, I know.'\n\nAnd so saying, she kissed us, smiling, and was gone.\n\nI was so unpleasantly occupied, for some time after her departure, with the\nknaveries said to be practised among the dense cover of the Windmill Wood,\nthat I did not immediately recollect that we had omitted to ask her any\nparticulars about her guests.\n\n'Who can Mary be?' asked Milly.\n\n'Cousin Monica says she's engaged to be married, and I think I heard the\nDoctor call her _Lady_ Mary, and I intended asking her ever so much about\nher; but what she told us about cutting down the trees, and all that, quite\nput it out of my head. We shall have time enough to-morrow, however, to ask\nquestions. I like her very much, I know.'\n\n'And I think,' said Milly, 'it is to Mr. Carysbroke she's to be married.'\n\n'Do you?' said I, remembering that he had sat beside her for more than a\nquarter of an hour after tea in very close and low-toned conversation; 'and\nhave you any particular reason?' I asked.\n\n'Well, I heard her once or twice call him \"dear,\" and she called him his\nChristian name, just like Lady Knollys did--Ilbury, I think--and I saw him\ngi' her a sly kiss as she was going up-stairs.'\n\nI laughed.\n\n'Well, Milly,' I said, 'I remarked something myself, I thought, like\nconfidential relations; but if you really saw them kiss on the staircase,\nthe question is pretty well settled.'\n\n'Ay, lass.'\n\n'You're not to say _lass_.'\n\n'Well, _Maud, then_. I did see them with the corner of my eye, and my back\nturned, when they did not think I could spy anything, as plain as I see you\nnow.'\n\nI laughed again; but I felt an odd pang--something of\nmortification--something of regret; but I smiled very gaily, as I stood\nbefore the glass, un-making my toilet preparatory to bed.\n\n'Maud--Maud--fickle Maud!--What, Captain Oakley already superseded! and Mr.\nCarysbroke--oh! humiliation--engaged.' So I smiled on, very much vexed;\nand being afraid lest I had listened with too apparent an interest to this\nimpostor, I sang a verse of a gay little chanson, and tried to think of\nCaptain Oakley, who somehow had become rather silly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n_NEWS AT BARTRAM GATE_\n\n\nMilly and I, thanks to our early Bartram hours, were first down next\nmorning; and so soon as Cousin Monica appeared we attacked her.\n\n'So Lady Mary is the _fianc\u00c3\u00a9e_ of Mr. Carysbroke,' said I, very cleverly;\n'and I think it was very wicked of you to try and involve me in a\nflirtation with him yesterday.'\n\n'And who told you that, pray?' asked Lady Knollys, with a pleasant little\nlaugh.\n\n'Milly and I discovered it, simple as we stand here,' I answered.\n\n'But you did not flirt with Mr. Carysbroke, Maud, did you?' she asked.\n\n'No, certainly not; but that was not your doing, wicked woman, but my\ndiscretion. And now that we know your secret, you must tell us all about\nher, and all about him; and in the first place, what is her name--Lady Mary\nwhat?' I demanded.\n\n'Who would have thought you so cunning? Two country misses--two little nuns\nfrom the cloisters of Bartram! Well, I suppose I must answer. It is vain\ntrying to hide anything from you; but how on earth did you find it out?'\n\n'We'll tell you that presently, but you shall first tell us who she is,' I\npersisted.\n\n'Well, that I will, of course, without compulsion. She is Lady Mary\nCarysbroke,' said Lady Knollys.\n\n'A relation of Mr. Carysbroke's,' I asserted.\n\n'Yes, a relation; but who told you he was Mr. Carysbroke?' asked Cousin\nMonica.\n\n'Milly told me, when we saw him in the Windmill Wood.'\n\n'And who told you, Milly?'\n\n'It was L'Amour,' answered Milly, with her blue eyes very wide open.\n\n'What does the child mean? L'Amour! You don't mean _love_?' exclaimed Lady\nKnollys, puzzled in her turn.\n\n'I mean old Wyat; _she_ told me and the Governor.'\n\n'You're _not_ to say that,' I interposed.\n\n'You mean your father?' suggested Lady Knollys.\n\n'Well, yes; father told her, and so I knew him.'\n\n'What could he mean?' exclaimed Lady Knollys, laughing, as it were, in\nsoliloquy; 'and I did not mention his name, I recollect now. He recognised\nyou, and you him, when you came into the room yesterday; and now you must\ntell me how you discovered that he and Lady Mary were to be married.'\n\nSo Milly restated her evidence, and Lady Knollys laughed unaccountably\nheartily; and she said--\n\n'They _will_ be _so_ confounded! but they deserve it; and, remember, _I_\ndid not say so.'\n\n'Oh! we acquit you.'\n\n'All I say is, such a deceitful, dangerous pair of girls--all things\nconsidered--I never heard of before,' exclaimed Lady Knollys. 'There's no\nsuch thing as conspiring in your presence.'\n\n'Good morning. I hope you slept well.' She was addressing the lady and\ngentleman who were just entering the room from the conservatory. 'You'll\nhardly sleep so well to-night, when you have learned what eyes are upon\nyou. Here are two very pretty detectives who have found out your secret,\nand entirely by your imprudence and their own cleverness have discovered\nthat you are a pair of betrothed lovers, about to ratify your vows at\nthe hymeneal altar. I assure you I did not tell of you; you betrayed\nyourselves. If you will talk in that confidential way on sofas, and call\none another stealthily by your Christian names, and actually kiss at the\nfoot of the stairs, while a clever detective is scaling them, apparently\nwith her back toward you, you must only take the consequences, and be known\nprematurely as the hero and heroine of the forthcoming paragraph in the\n\"Morning Post.\"'\n\nMilly and I were horribly confounded, but Cousin Monica was resolved to\nplace us all upon the least formal terms possible, and I believe she had\nset about it in the right way.\n\n'And now, girls, I am going to make a counter-discovery, which, I fear, a\nlittle conflicts with yours. This Mr. Carysbroke is Lord Ilbury, brother\nof this Lady Mary; and it is all my fault for not having done my honours\nbetter; but you see what clever match-making little creatures they are.'\n\n'You can't think how flattered I am at being made the subject of a theory,\neven a mistaken one, by Miss Ruthyn.'\n\nAnd so, after our modest fit was over, Milly and I were very merry, like\nthe rest, and we all grew a great deal more intimate that morning.\n\nI think altogether those were the pleasantest and happiest days of my\nlife: gay, intelligent, and kindly society at home; charming\nexcursions--sometimes riding--sometimes by carriage--to distant points of\nbeauty in the county. Evenings varied with music, reading, and spirited\nconversation. Now and then a visitor for a day or two, and constantly some\nneighbour from the town, or its dependencies, dropt in. Of these I but\nremember tall old Miss Wintletop, most entertaining of rustic old\nmaids, with her nice lace and thick satin, and her small, kindly round\nface--pretty, I dare say, in other days, and now frosty, but kindly--who\ntold us such delightful old stories of the county in her father's and\ngrandfather's time; who knew the lineage of every family in it, and could\nrecount all its duels and elopements; give us illustrative snatches from\nold election squibs, and lines from epitaphs, and tell exactly where all\nthe old-world highway robberies had been committed: how it fared with the\nchief delinquents after the assizes; and, above all, where, and of what\nsort, the goblins and elves of the county had made themselves seen, from\nthe phantom post-boy, who every third night crossed Windale Moor, by the\nold coach-road, to the fat old ghost, in mulberry velvet, who showed his\ngreat face, crutch, and ruffles, by moonlight, at the bow window of the old\ncourt-house that was taken down in 1803.\n\nYou cannot imagine what agreeable evenings we passed in this society,\nor how rapidly my good Cousin Milly improved in it. I remember well the\nintense suspense in which she and I awaited the answer from Bartram-Haugh\nto kind Cousin Monica's application for an extension of our leave of\nabsence.\n\nIt came, and with it a note from Uncle Silas, which was curious, and,\ntherefore, is printed here:--\n\n'MY DEAR LADY KNOLLYS,--To your kind letter I say yes (that is, for another\nweek, not a fortnight), with all my heart. I am glad to hear that my\nstarlings chatter so pleasantly; at all events the refrain is not that of\nSterne's. They can get out; and do get out; and shall get out as much as\nthey please. I am no gaoler, and shut up nobody but myself. I have always\nthought that young people have too little liberty. My principle has been\nto make little free men and women of them from the first. In morals,\naltogether--in intellect, more than we allow--_self_-education is that\nwhich abides; and _it_ only begins where constraint ends. Such is my\ntheory. My practice is consistent. Let them remain for a week longer, as\nyou say. The horses shall be at Elverston on Tuesday, the 7th. I shall be\nmore than usually sad and solitary till their return; so pray, I selfishly\nentreat, do not extend their absence. You will smile, remembering how\nlittle my health will allow me to see of them, even when at home; but as\nChaulieu so prettily says--I stupidly forget the words, but the sentiment\nis this--\"although concealed by a sylvan wall of leaves, impenetrable--(he\nis pursuing his favourite nymphs through the alleys and intricacies of a\nrustic labyrinth)--yet, your songs, your prattle, and your laughter, faint\nand far away, inspire my fancy; and, through my ears, I see your unseen\nsmiles, your blushes, your floating tresses, and your ivory feet; and so,\nthough sad, am happy; though alone, in company;\"--and such is my case.\n\n'One only request, and I have done. Pray remind them of a promise made to\nme. The Book of Life--the fountain of life--it must be drunk of, night and\nmorning, or their spiritual life expires.\n\n'And now, Heaven bless and keep you, my dear cousin; and with all\nassurances of affection to my beloved niece and my child, believe me ever\nyours affectionately.\n\n'SILAS RUTHYN.'\n\nSaid Cousin Monica, with a waggish smile--\n\n'And so, girls, you have Chaulieu and the evangelists; the French rhymester\nin his alley, and Silas in the valley of the shadow of death; perfect\nliberty, and a peremptory order to return in a week;--all illustrating one\nanother. Poor Silas! old as he is, I don't think his religion fits him.'\n\n_I_ really rather liked his letter. I was struggling hard to think well of\nhim, and Cousin Monica knew it; and I really think if I had not been by,\nshe would often have been less severe on him.\n\nAs we were all sitting pleasantly about the breakfast table a day or two\nafter, the sun shining on the pleasant wintry landscape, Cousin Monica\nsuddenly exclaimed--\n\n'I quite forgot to tell you that Charles Oakley has written to say he is\ncoming on Wednesday. I really don't want him. Poor Charlie! I wonder how\nthey manage those doctors' certificates. I know nothing ails him, and he'd\nbe much better with his regiment.'\n\nWednesday!--how odd. Exactly the day after my departure. I tried to look\nperfectly unconcerned. Lady Knollys had addressed herself more to Lady\nMary and Milly than to me, and nobody in particular was looking at me.\nNotwithstanding, with my usual perversity, I felt myself blushing with a\nbrilliancy that may have been very becoming, but which was so intolerably\nprovoking that I would have risen and left the room but that matters would\nhave been so infinitely worse. I could have boxed my odious ears. I could\nalmost have jumped from the window.\n\nI felt that Lord Ilbury saw it. I saw Lady Mary's eyes for a moment resting\ngravely on my tell-tale--my lying cheeks--for I really had begun to think\nmuch less celestially of Captain Oakley. I was angry with Cousin Monica,\nwho, knowing my blushing infirmity, had mentioned her nephew so suddenly\nwhile I was strapped by etiquette in my chair, with my face to the window,\nand two pair of most disconcerting eyes, at least, opposite. I was angry\nwith myself--generally angry--refused more tea rather dryly, and was\nlaconic to Lord Ilbury, all which, of course, was very cross and foolish;\nand afterwards, from my bed-room window, I saw Cousin Monica and Lady\nMary among the flowers, under the drawing-room window, talking, as I\ninstinctively knew, of that little incident. I was standing at the glass.\n\n'My odious, stupid, _perjured_ face' I whispered, furiously, at the same\ntime stamping on the floor, and giving myself quite a smart slap on the\ncheek. 'I _can't_ go down--I'm ready to cry--I've a mind to return to\nBartram to-day; I am _always_ blushing; and I wish that impudent Captain\nOakley was at the bottom of the sea.'\n\nI was, perhaps, thinking more of Lord Ilbury than I was aware; and I am\nsure if Captain Oakley had arrived that day, I should have treated him with\nmost unjustifiable rudeness.\n\nNotwithstanding this unfortunate blush, the remainder of our visit passed\nvery happily for me. No one who has not experienced it can have an idea\nhow intimate a small party, such as ours, will grow in a short time in a\ncountry house.\n\nOf course, a young lady of a well-regulated mind cannot possibly care a\npin about any one of the opposite sex until she is well assured that he is\nbeginning, at least, to like her better than all the world beside; but I\ncould not deny to myself that I was rather anxious to know more about Lord\nIlbury than I actually did know.\n\nThere was a 'Peerage,' in its bright scarlet and gold uniform, corpulent\nand tempting, upon the little marble table in the drawing-room. I had many\nopportunities of consulting it, but I never could find courage to do so.\n\nFor an inexperienced person it would have been a matter of several minutes,\nand during those minutes what awful risk of surprise and detection. One\nday, all being quiet, I did venture, and actually, with a beating heart,\ngot so far as to find out the letter 'Il,' when I heard a step outside the\ndoor, which opened a little bit, and I heard Lady Knollys, luckily arrested\nat the entrance, talk some sentences outside, her hand still upon the\ndoor-handle. I shut the book, as Mrs. Bluebeard might the door of the\nchamber of horrors at the sound of her husband's step, and skipped to a\nremote part of the room, where Cousin Knollys found me in a mysterious\nstate of agitation.\n\nOn any other subject I would have questioned Cousin Monica unhesitatingly;\nupon this, somehow, I was dumb. I distrusted myself, and dreaded my odious\nhabit of blushing, and knew that I should look so horribly guilty, and\nbecome so agitated and odd, that she would have reasonably concluded that I\nhad quite lost my heart to him.\n\nAfter the lesson I had received, and my narrow escape of detection in the\nvery act, you may be sure I never trusted myself in the vicinity of that\nfat and cruel 'Peerage,' which possessed the secret, but would not disclose\nwithout compromising me.\n\nIn this state of tantalizing darkness and conjecture I should have\ndeparted, had not Cousin Monica quite spontaneously relieved me.\n\nThe night before our departure she sat with us in our room, chatting a\nlittle farewell gossip.\n\n'And what do you think of Ilbury?' she asked.\n\n'I think him clever and accomplished, and amusing; but he sometimes appears\nto me very melancholy--that is, for a few minutes together--and then, I\nfancy, with an effort, re-engages in our conversation.'\n\n'Yes, poor Ilbury! He lost his brother only about five months since, and\nis only beginning to recover his spirits a little. They were very much\nattached, and people thought that he would have succeeded to the title,\nhad he lived, because Ilbury is _difficile_--or a philosopher--or a _Saint\nKevin_; and, in fact, has begun to be treated as a premature old bachelor.'\n\n'What a charming person his sister, Lady Mary, is. She has made me promise\nto write to her,' I said, I suppose--such hypocrites are we--to prove to\nCousin Knollys that I did not care particularly to hear anything more about\nhim.\n\n'Yes, and so devoted to him. He came down here, and took The Grange, for\nchange of scene and solitude--of all things the worst for a man in grief--a\nmorbid whim, as he is beginning to find out; for he is very glad to stay\nhere, and confesses that he is much better since he came. His letters are\nstill addressed to him as Mr. Carysbroke; for he fancied if his rank were\nknown, that the county people would have been calling upon him, and so he\nwould have found himself soon involved in a tiresome round of dinners, and\nmust have gone somewhere else. You saw him, Milly, at Bartram, before Maud\ncame?'\n\nYes, she had, when he called there to see her father.\n\n'He thought, as he had accepted the trusteeship, that he could hardly,\nresiding so near, omit to visit Silas. He was very much struck and\ninterested by him, and he has a better opinion of him--you are not angry,\nMilly--than some ill-natured people I could name; and he says that the\ncutting down of the trees will turn out to have been a mere slip. But these\nslips don't occur with clever men in other things; and some persons have\na way of always making them in their own favour. And, to talk of other\nthings, I suspect that you and Milly will probably see Ilbury at Bartram;\nfor I think he likes you very much.'\n\n_You_; did she mean _both_, or only me?\n\nSo our pleasant visit was over. Milly's good little curate had been much\nthrown in her way by our deep and dangerous cousin Monica. He was most\nlaudably steady; and his flirtation advanced upon the field of theology,\nwhere, happily, Milly's little reading had been concentrated. A mild and\nearnest interest in poor, pretty Milly's orthodoxy was the leading feature\nof his case; and I was highly amused at her references to me, when we had\nretired at night, upon the points which she had disputed with him, and\nher anxious reports of their low-toned conferences, carried on upon a\nsequestered ottoman, where he patted and stroked his crossed leg, as he\nsmiled tenderly and shook his head at her questionable doctrine. Milly's\nreverence for her instructor, and his admiration, grew daily; and he was\nknown among us as Milly's confessor.\n\nHe took luncheon with us on the day of our departure, and with an adroit\nprivacy, which in a layman would have been sly, presented her, in right of\nhis holy calling, with a little book, the binding of which was mediaeval\nand costly, and whose letter-press dealt in a way which he commended,\nwith some points on which she was not satisfactory; and she found on the\nfly-leaf this little inscription:--'Presented to Miss Millicent Ruthyn by\nan earnest well-wisher, 1st December 1844.' A text, very neatly penned,\nfollowed this; and the 'presentation' was made unctiously indeed, but with\na blush, as well as the accustomed smile, and with eyes that were lowered.\n\nThe early crimson sun of December had gone down behind the hills before we\ntook our seats in the carriage.\n\nLord Ilbury leaned with his elbow on the carriage window, looking in, and\nhe said to me--\n\n'I really don't know what we shall do, Miss Ruthyn; we shall all feel so\nlonely. For myself, I think I shall run away to Grange.'\n\nThis appeared to me as nearly perfect eloquence as human lips could utter.\n\nHis hand still rested on the window, and the Rev. Sprigge Biddlepen was\nstanding with a saddened smirk on the door steps, when the whip smacked,\nthe horses scrambled into motion, and away we rolled down the avenue,\nleaving behind us the pleasantest house and hostess in the world, and\ntrotting fleetly into darkness towards Bartram-Haugh.\n\nWe were both rather silent. Milly had her book in her lap, and I saw\nher every now and then try to read her 'earnest well-wisher's' little\ninscription, but there was not light to read by.\n\nWhen we reached the great gate of Bartram-Haugh it was dark. Old Crowl, who\nkept the gate, I heard enjoining the postilion to make no avoidable noise\nat the hall-door, for the odd but startling reason that he believed my\nuncle 'would be dead by this time.'\n\nVery much shocked and frightened, we stopped the carriage, and questioned\nthe tremulous old porter.\n\nUncle Silas, it seemed, had been 'silly-ish' all yesterday, and 'could not\nbe woke this morning,' and 'the doctor had been here twice, being now in\nthe house.'\n\n'Is he better?' I asked, tremblingly.\n\n'Not as I'm aweer on, Miss; he lay at God's mercy two hours agone; 'appen\nhe's in heaven be this time.'\n\n'Drive on--drive fast,' I said to the driver. 'Don't be frightened, Milly;\nplease Heaven we shall find all going well.'\n\nAfter some delay, during which my heart sank, and I quite gave up Uncle\nSilas, the aged little servant-man opened the door, and trotted shakily\ndown the steps to the carriage side.\n\nUncle Silas had been at death's door for hours; the question of life had\ntrembled in the scale; but now the doctor said 'he might do.'\n\n'Where was the doctor?'\n\n'In master's room; he blooded him three hours agone.'\n\nI don't think that Milly was so frightened as I. My heart beat, and I was\ntrembling so that I could hardly get upstairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n_A FRIEND ARISES_\n\n\nAt the top of the great staircase I was glad to see the friendly face\nof Mary Quince, who stood, candle in hand, greeting us with many little\ncourtesies, and a very haggard and pallid smile.\n\n'Very welcome, Miss, hoping you are very well.'\n\n'All well, and you are well, Mary? and oh! tell us quickly how is Uncle\nSilas?'\n\n'We thought he was gone, Miss, this morning, but doing fairly now; doctor\nsays in a trance like. I was helping old Wyat most of the day, and was\nthere when doctor blooded him, an' he spoke at last; but he must be awful\nweak, he took a deal o' blood from his arm, Miss; I held the basin.'\n\n'And he's better--decidedly better?' I asked.\n\n'Well, he's better, doctor says; he talked some, and doctor says if he goes\noff asleep again, and begins a-snoring like he did before, we're to loose\nthe bandage, and let him bleed till he comes to his self again; which, it\nseems to me and Wyat, is the same thing a'most as saying he's to be killed\noff-hand, for I don't believe he has a drop to spare, as you'll say\nlikewise, Miss, if you'll please look in the basin.'\n\nThis was not an invitation with which I cared to comply. I thought I was\ngoing to faint. I sat on the stairs and sipped a little water, and Quince\nsprinkled a little in my face, and my strength returned.\n\nMilly must have felt her father's danger more than I, for she was\naffectionate, and loved him from habit and relation, although he was not\nkind to her. But I was more nervous and more impetuous, and my feelings\nboth stimulated and overpowered me more easily. The moment I was able to\nstand I said--thinking of nothing but the one idea--\n\n'We must see him--_come_, Milly.'\n\nI entered his sitting-room; a common 'dip' candle hanging like the tower\nof Pisa all to one side, with a dim, long wick, in a greasy candlestick,\nprofaned the table of the fastidious invalid. The light was little better\nthan darkness, and I crossed the room swiftly, still transfixed by the one\nidea of seeing my uncle.\n\nHis bed-room door beside the fireplace stood partly open, and I looked in.\n\nOld Wyat, a white, high-cauled ghost, was pottering in her slippers in the\nshadow at the far side of the bed. The doctor, a stout little bald man,\nwith a paunch and a big bunch of seals, stood with his back to the\nfireplace, which corresponded with that in the next room, eyeing his\npatient through the curtains of the bed with a listless sort of importance.\n\nThe head of the large four-poster rested against the opposite wall. Its\nfoot was presented toward the fireplace; but the curtains at the side,\nwhich alone I could see from my position, were closed.\n\nThe little doctor knew me, and thinking me, I suppose, a person of\nconsequence, removed his hands from behind him, suffering the skirts of his\ncoat to fall forward, and with great celerity and gravity made me a low but\nimportant bow; then choosing more particularly to make my acquaintance\nhe further advanced, and with another reverence he introduced himself\nas Doctor Jolks, in a murmured diapason. He bowed me back again into my\nuncle's study, and the light of old Wyat's dreadful candle.\n\nDoctor Jolks was suave and pompous. I longed for a fussy practitioner who\nwould have got over the ground in half the time.\n\nComa, madam; coma. Miss Ruthyn, your uncle, I may tell you, has been in a\nvery critical state; highly so. Coma of the most obstinate type. He would\nhave sunk--he must have gone, in fact, had I not resorted to a very extreme\nremedy, and bled him freely, which happily told precisely as we could have\nwished. A wonderful constitution--a marvellous constitution--prodigious\nnervous fibre; the greatest pity in the world he won't give himself fair\nplay. His habits, you know, are quite, I may say, destructive. We do\nour best--we do all we can, but if the patient won't cooperate it can't\npossibly end satisfactorily.'\n\nAnd Jolks accompanied this with an awful shrug. 'Is there _anything_? Do\nyou think change of air? What an awful complaint it is,' I exclaimed.\n\nHe smiled, mysteriously looking down, and shook his head undertaker-like.\n\n'Why, we can hardly call it a _complaint_, Miss Ruthyn. I look upon it he\nhas been poisoned--he has had, you understand me,' he pursued, observing my\nstartled look, 'an overdose of opium; you know he takes opium habitually;\nhe takes it in laudanum, he takes it in water, and, most dangerous of all,\nhe takes it solid, in lozenges. I've known people take it moderately.\nI've known people take it to excess, _but_ they all were particular as to\n_measure,_ and _that_ is exactly the point I've tried to impress upon him.\nThe habit, of course, you understand is formed, there's no uprooting that;\nbut he won't _measure_--he goes by the eye and by sensation, which I need\nnot tell you, Miss Ruthyn, is going by _chance;_ and opium, as no doubt\nyou are aware, is strictly a poison; a poison, no doubt, which habit will\nenable you to partake of, I may say, in considerable quantities, without\nfatal consequences, but still a poison; and to exhibit a poison _so_, is,\nI need scarcely tell you, to trifle with death. He has been so threatened,\nand for a time he changes his haphazard mode of dealing with it, and then\nreturns; he may escape--of course, that is possible--but he may any day\noverdo the thing. I don't think the present crisis will result seriously. I\nam very glad, independently of the honour of making your acquaintance, Miss\nRuthyn, that you and your cousin have returned; for, however zealous, I\nfear the servants are deficient in intelligence; and as in the event of a\nrecurrence of the symptoms--which, however, is not probable--I would beg to\ninform you of their nature, and how exactly best to deal with them.'\n\nSo upon these points he delivered us a pompous little lecture, and begged\nthat either Milly or I would remain in the room with the patient until his\nreturn at two or three o'clock in the morning; a reappearance of the coma\n'might be very bad indeed.'\n\nOf course Milly and I did as we were directed. We sat by the fire, scarcely\ndaring to whisper. Uncle Silas, about whom a new and dreadful suspicion\nbegan to haunt me, lay still and motionless as if he were actually dead.\n\n'Had he attempted to poison himself?'\n\nIf he believed his position to be as desperate as Lady Knollys had\ndescribed it, was this, after all, improbable? There were strange wild\ntheories, I had been told, mixed up in his religion.\n\nSometimes, at an hour's interval, a sign of life would come--a moan from\nthat tall sheeted figure in the bed--a moan and a pattering of the lips.\nWas it prayer--_what_ was it? who could guess what thoughts were passing\nbehind that white-fillited forehead?\n\nI had peeped at him: a white cloth steeped in vinegar and water was folded\nround his head; his great eyes were closed, so were his marble lips; his\nfigure straight, thin, and long, dressed in a white dressing-gown, looked\nlike a corpse 'laid out' in the bed; his gaunt bandaged arm lay outside the\nsheet that covered his body.\n\nWith this awful image of death we kept our vigil, until poor Milly grew so\nsleepy that old Wyat proposed that she should take her place and watch with\nme.\n\nLittle as I liked the crone with the high-cauled cap, she would, at all\nevents, keep awake, which Milly could not. And so at one o'clock this new\narrangement began.\n\n'Mr. Dudley Ruthyn is not at home?' I whispered to old Wyat.\n\n'He went away wi' himself yesternight, to Cloperton, Miss, to see the\nwrestling; it was to come off this morning.'\n\n'Was he sent for?'\n\n'Not he.'\n\n'And why not?'\n\n'He would na' leave the sport for this, I'm thinking,' and the old woman\ngrinned uglily.\n\n'When is he to return?'\n\n'When he wants money.'\n\nSo we grew silent, and again I thought of suicide, and of the unhappy old\nman, who just then whispered a sentence or two to himself with a sigh.\n\nFor the next hour he had been quite silent, and old Wyat informed me that\nshe must go down for candles. Ours were already burnt down to the sockets.\n\n'There's a candle in the next room,' I suggested, hating the idea of being\nleft alone with the patient.\n\n'Hoot! Miss. I _dare_ na' set a candle but wax in his presence,' whispered\nthe old woman, scornfully.\n\n'I think if we were to stir the fire, and put on a little more coal, we\nshould have a great deal of light.'\n\n'He'll ha' the candles,' said Dame Wyat, doggedly; and she tottered from\nthe chamber, muttering to herself; and I heard her take her candle from the\nnext room and depart, shutting the outer door after her.\n\nHere was I then alone, but for this unearthly companion, whom I feared\ninexpressibly, at two o'clock, in the vast old house of Bartram.\n\nI stirred the fire. It was low, and would not blaze. I stood up, and, with\nmy hand on the mantelpiece, endeavoured to think of cheerful things. But\nit was a struggle against wind and tide--vain; and so I drifted away into\nhaunted regions.\n\nUncle Silas was perfectly still. I would not suffer myself to think of the\nnumber of dark rooms and passages which now separated me from the other\nliving tenants of the house. I awaited with a false composure the return of\nold Wyat.\n\nOver the mantelpiece was a looking-glass. At another time this might have\nhelped to entertain my solitary moments, but now I did not like to venture\na peep. A small thick Bible lay on the chimneypiece, and leaning its back\nagainst the mirror, I began to read in it with a mind as attentively\ndirected as I could. While so engaged in turning over the leaves, I lighted\nupon two or three odd-looking papers, which had been folded into it. One\nwas a broad printed thing, with names and dates written into blank spaces,\nand was about the size of a quarter of a yard of very broad ribbon. The\nothers were mere scraps, with 'Dudley Ruthyn' penned in my cousin's vulgar\nround-hand at the foot. While I folded and replaced these, I really don't\nknow what caused me to fancy that something was moving behind me, as I\nstood with my back toward the bed. I do not recollect any sound whatever;\nbut instinctively I glanced into the mirror, and my eyes were instantly\nfixed by what I saw.\n\nThe figure of Uncle Silas rose up, and dressed in a long white morning\ngown, slid over the end of the bed, and with two or three swift\nnoiseless steps, stood behind me, with a death-like scowl and a simper.\nPreternaturally tall and thin, he stood for a moment almost touching me,\nwith the white bandage pinned across his forehead, his bandaged arm stiffly\nby his side, and diving over my shoulder, with his long thin hand he\nsnatched the Bible, and whispered over my head--'The serpent beguiled her\nand she did eat;' and after a momentary pause, he glided to the farthest\nwindow, and appeared to look out upon the midnight prospect.\n\nIt was cold, but he did not seem to feel it. With the same inflexible scowl\nand smile, he continued to look out for several minutes, and then with a\ngreat sigh, he sat down on the side of his bed, his face immovably turned\ntowards me, with the same painful look.\n\nIt seemed to me an hour before old Wyat came back; and never was lover made\nhappier at sight of his mistress than I to behold that withered crone.\n\nYou may be sure I did not prolong my watch. There was now plainly no risk\nof my uncle's relapsing into lethargy. I had a long hysterical fit of\nweeping when I got into my room, with honest Mary Quince by my side.\n\nWhenever I closed my eyes, the face of Uncle Silas was before me, as I had\nseen it reflected in the glass. The sorceries of Bartram were enveloping me\nonce more.\n\nNext morning the doctor said he was quite out of danger, but very weak.\nMilly and I saw him; and again in our afternoon walk we saw the doctor\nmarching under the trees in the direction of the Windmill Wood.\n\n'Going down to see that poor girl there?' he said, when he had made his\nsalutation, prodding with his levelled stick in the direction. 'Hawke, or\nHawkes, I think.'\n\n'Beauty's sick, Maud,' exclaimed Milly.\n\n'_Hawkes_. She's upon my dispensary list. Yes,' said the doctor, looking\ninto his little note-book--'Hawkes.'\n\n'And what is her complaint?'\n\n'Rheumatic fever.'\n\n'Not infectious?'\n\n'Not the least--no more, as we say, Miss Ruthyn, than a broken leg,' and he\nlaughed obligingly.\n\nSo soon as the doctor had departed, Milly and I agreed to follow to Hawkes'\ncottage and enquire more particularly how she was. To say truth, I am\nafraid it was rather for the sake of giving our walk a purpose and a point\nof termination, than for any very charitable interest we might have felt in\nthe patient.\n\nOver the inequalities of the upland slope, clumped with trees, we reached\nthe gabled cottage, with its neglected little farm-yard. A rheumatic old\nwoman was the only attendant; and, having turned her ear in an attitude of\nattention, which induced us in gradually exalted keys to enquire how Meg\nwas, she informed us in very loud tones that she had long lost her hearing\nand was perfectly deaf. And added considerately--\n\n'When the man comes in, 'appen he'll tell ye what ye want.'\n\nThrough the door of a small room at the further end of that in which we\nwere, we could see a portion of the narrow apartment of the patient, and\nhear her moans and the doctor's voice.\n\n'We'll see him, Milly, when he comes out. Let us wait here.'\n\nSo we stood upon the door-stone awaiting him. The sounds of suffering had\nmoved my compassion and interested us for the sick girl.\n\n'Blest if here isn't Pegtop,' said Milly.\n\nAnd the weather-stained red coat, the swarthy forbidding face and sooty\nlocks of old Hawkes loomed in sight, as he stumped, steadying himself with\nhis stick, over the uneven pavement of the yard. He touched his hat gruffly\nto me, but did not seem half to like our being where we were, for he looked\nsurlily, and scratched his head under his wide-awake.\n\n'Your daughter is very ill, I'm afraid,' said I.\n\n'Ay--she'll be costin' me a handful, like her mother did,' said Pegtop.\n\n'I hope her room is comfortable, poor thing.'\n\n'Ay, that's it; she be comfortable enough, I warrant--more nor I. It be all\nMeg, and nout o' Dickon.'\n\n'When did her illness commence?' I asked.\n\n'Day the mare wor shod--_Saturday_. I talked a bit wi' the workus folk, but\nthey won't gi'e nout--dang 'em--an' how be _I_ to do't? It be all'ays hard\nbread wi' Silas, an' a deal harder now she' ta'en them pains. I won't stan'\nit much longer. Gammon! If she keeps on that way I'll just cut. See how the\nworkus fellahs 'ill like _that_!'\n\n'The Doctor gives his services for nothing,' I said.\n\n'An' _does_ nothin', bless him! ha, ha. No more nor that old deaf gammon\nthere that costs me three tizzies a week, and haint worth a h'porth--no\nmore nor Meg there, that's making all she can o' them pains. They be all a\nfoolin' o' me, an' thinks I don't know't. Hey? _we_'ll see.'\n\nAll this time he was cutting a bit of tobacco into shreds on the\nwindow-stone.\n\n'A workin' man be same as a hoss; if he baint cared, he can't work--'tisn't\nin him:' and with these words, having by this time stuffed his pipe with\ntobacco, he poked the deaf lady, who was pattering about with her back\ntoward him, rather viciously with the point of his stick, and signed for a\nlight.\n\n'It baint in him, you can't get it out o' 'im, no more nor ye'll draw smoke\nout o' this,' and he raised his pipe an inch or two, with his thumb on the\nbowl, 'without backy and fire. 'Tisn't in it.'\n\n'Maybe I can be of some use?' I said, thinking.\n\n'Maybe,' he rejoined.\n\nBy this time he received from the old deaf abigail a flaming roll of brown\npaper, and, touching his hat to me, he withdrew, lighting his pipe and\nsending up little white puffs, like the salute of a departing ship.\n\nSo he did not care to hear how his daughter was, and had only come here to\nlight his pipe!\n\nJust then the Doctor emerged.\n\n'We have been waiting to hear how your poor patient is to-day?' I said.\n\n'Very ill, indeed, and utterly neglected, I fear. If she were equal\nto it--but she's not--I think she ought to be removed to the hospital\nimmediately.'\n\n'That poor old woman is quite deaf, and the man is so surly and selfish!\nCould you recommend a nurse who would stay here till she's better? I will\npay her with pleasure, and anything you think might be good for the poor\ngirl.'\n\nSo this was settled on the spot. Doctor Jolks was kind, like most men\nof his calling, and undertook to send the nurse from Feltram with a few\ncomforts for the patient; and he called Dickon to the yard-gate, and I\nsuppose told him of the arrangement; and Milly and I went to the poor\ngirl's door and asked, 'May we come in?'\n\nThere was no answer. So, with the conventional construction of silence, we\nentered. Her looks showed how ill she was. We adjusted her bed-clothes, and\ndarkened the room, and did what we could for her--noting, beside, what her\ncomfort chiefly required. She did not answer any questions. She did not\nthank us. I should almost have fancied that she had not perceived our\npresence, had I not observed her dark, sunken eyes once or twice turned up\ntowards my face, with a dismal look of wonder and enquiry.\n\nThe girl was very ill, and we went every day to see her. Sometimes she\nwould answer our questions--sometimes not. Thoughtful, observant, surly,\nshe seemed; and as people like to be thanked, I sometimes wonder that\nwe continued to throw our bread upon these ungrateful waters. Milly was\nspecially impatient under this treatment, and protested against it, and\nfinally refused to accompany me into poor Beauty's bed-room.\n\n'I think, my good Meg,' said I one day, as I stood by her bed--she was now\nrecovering with the sure reascent of youth--'that you ought to thank Miss\nMilly.'\n\n'I'll _not_ thank her,' said Beauty, doggedly.\n\n'Very well, Meg; I only thought I'd ask you, for I think you ought.'\n\nAs I spoke, she very gently took just the tip of my finger, which hung\nclose to her coverlet, in her fingers, and drew it beneath, and before I\nwas aware, burying her head in the clothes, she suddenly clasped my hand\nin both hers to her lips, and kissed it passionately, again and again,\nsobbing. I felt her tears.\n\nI tried to withdraw my hand, but she held it with an angry pull, continuing\nto weep and kiss it.\n\n'Do you wish to say anything, my poor Meg?' I asked.\n\n'Nout, Miss,' she sobbed gently; and she continued to kiss my hand and\nweep. But suddenly she said, 'I won't thank Milly, for it's a' _you_; it\nbaint her, she hadn't the thought--no, no, it's a' you, Miss. I cried\nhearty in the dark last night, thinkin' o' the apples, and the way I\nknocked them awa' wi' a pur o' my foot, the day father rapped me ower the\nhead wi' his stick; it was kind o' you and very bad o' me. I wish you'd\nbeat me, Miss; ye're better to me than father or mother--better to me than\na'; an' I wish I could die for you, Miss, for I'm not fit to look at you.'\n\nI was surprised. I began to cry. I could have hugged poor Meg.\n\nI did not know her history. I have never learned it since. She used to\ntalk with the most utter self-abasement before me. It was no religious\nfeeling--it was a kind of expression of her love and worship of me--all the\nmore strange that she was naturally very proud. There was nothing she\nwould not have borne from me except the slightest suspicion of her entire\ndevotion, or that she could in the most trifling way wrong or deceive me.\n\nI am not young now. I have had my sorrows, and with them all that wealth,\nvirtually unlimited, can command; and through the retrospect a few bright\nand pure lights quiver along my life's dark stream--dark, but for them; and\nthese are shed, not by the splendour of a splendid fortune, but by two or\nthree of the simplest and kindest remembrances, such as the poorest and\nhomeliest life may count up, and beside which, in the quiet hours of\nmemory, all artificial triumphs pale, and disappear, for they are never\nquenched by time or distance, being founded on the affections, and so far\nheavenly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n_A CHAPTER-FULL OF LOVERS_\n\n\nWe had about this time a pleasant and quite unexpected visit from Lord\nIlbury. He had come to pay his respects, understanding that my uncle Silas\nwas sufficiently recovered to see visitors. 'And I think I'll run up-stairs\nfirst, and see him, if he admits me, and then I have ever so long a message\nfrom my sister, Mary, for you and Miss Millicent; but I had better dispose\nof my business first--don't you think so?--and I shall return in a few\nminutes.'\n\nAnd as he spoke our tremulous old butler returned to say that Uncle Silas\nwould be happy to see him. So he departed; and you can't think how pleasant\nour homely sitting-room looked with his coat and stick in it--guarantees of\nhis return.\n\n'Do you think, Milly, he is going to speak about the timber, you know, that\nCousin Knollys spoke of? I do hope not.'\n\n'So do I,' said Milly. 'I wish he'd stayed a bit longer with us first, for\nif he does, father will sure to turn him out of doors, and we'll see no\nmore of him.'\n\n'Exactly, my dear Milly; and he's so pleasant and good-natured.'\n\n'And he likes you awful well, he does.'\n\n'I'm sure he likes us both equally, Milly; he talked a great deal to you at\nElverston, and used to ask you so often to sing those two pretty Lancashire\nballads,' I said; 'but you know when you were at your controversies and\nreligious exercises in the window, with that pillar of the church, the Rev.\nSpriggs Biddlepen--'\n\n'Get awa' wi' your nonsense, Maud; how could I help answering when he\ndodged me up and down my Testament and catechism?--an I 'most hate him, I\ntell you, and Cousin Knollys, you're such fools, I do. And whatever you\nsay, the lord likes you uncommon, and well you know it, ye hussy.'\n\n'I know no such thing; and you don't think it, _you_ hussy, and I really\ndon't care who likes me or who doesn't, except my relations; and I make the\nlord a present to you, if you'll have him.'\n\nIn this strain were we talking when he re-entered the room, a little sooner\nthan we had expected to see him.\n\nMilly, who, you are to recollect, was only in process of reformation, and\nstill retained something of the Derbyshire dairymaid, gave me a little\nclandestine pinch on the arm just as he made his appearance.\n\n'I just refused a present from her,' said odious Milly, in answer to his\nenquiring look, 'because I knew she could not spare it.'\n\nThe effect of all this was that I blushed one of my overpowering blushes.\nPeople told me they became me very much; I hope so, for the misfortune was\nfrequent; and I think nature owed me that compensation.\n\n'It places you both in a most becoming light,' said Lord Ilbury, quite\ninnocently. 'I really don't know which most to admire--the generosity of\nthe offer or of the refusal.'\n\n'Well, it _was_ kind, if you but knew. I'm 'most tempted to tell him,' said\nMilly.\n\nI checked her with a really angry look, and said, 'Perhaps you have not\nobserved it; but I really think, for a sensible person, my cousin Milly\nhere talks more nonsense than any twenty other girls.'\n\n'A twenty-girl power! That's an immense compliment. I've the greatest\nrespect for nonsense, I owe it so much; and I really think if nonsense were\nbanished, the earth would grow insupportable.'\n\n'Thank you, Lord Ilbury,' said Milly, who had grown quite easy in his\ncompany during our long visit at Elverston; 'and I tell you, Miss Maud, if\nyou grow saucy, I'll accept your present, and what will you say then?'\n\n'I really don't know; but just now I want to ask Lord Ilbury how he thinks\nmy uncle looks; neither I nor Milly have seen him since his illness.'\n\n'Very much weaker, I think; but he may be gaining strength. Still, as my\nbusiness was not quite pleasant, I thought it better to postpone it, and\nif you think it would be right, I'll write to Doctor Bryerly to ask him to\npostpone the discussion for a little time.'\n\nI at once assented, and thanked him; indeed, if I had had my way, the\nsubject should never have been mentioned, I felt so hardhearted and\nrapacious; but Lord Ilbury explained that the trustees were constrained by\nthe provisions of the will, and that I really had no power to release them;\nand I hoped that Uncle Silas also understood all this.\n\n'And now,' said he, 'we've returned to Grange, my sister and I, and it is\nnearer than Elverston, so that we are really neighbours; and Mary wants\nLady Knollys to fix a time she owes us a visit, you know--and you really\nmust come at the same time; it will be so very pleasant, the same party\nexactly meeting in a new scene; and we have not half explored our\nneighbourhood; and I've got down all those Spanish engravings I told you\nof, and the Venetian missals, and all the rest. I think I remember very\naccurately the things you were most interested by, and they're all there;\nand really you must promise, you and Miss Millicent Ruthyn. And I forgot to\nmention--you know you complained that you were ill supplied with books,\nso Mary thought you would allow her to share her supply--they are the new\nbooks, you know--and when you have read yours, you and she can exchange.'\n\nWhat girl was ever quite frank about her likings? I don't think I was more\nof a cheat than others; but I never could tell of myself. It is quite true\nthat this duplicity and reserve seldom deceives. Our hypocrisies are forced\nupon some of our sex by the acuteness and vigilance of all in this field of\nenquiry; but if we are sly, we are also lynx-eyed, capital detectives, most\ningenious in fitting together the bits and dovetails of a cumulative case;\nand in those affairs of love and liking, have a terrible exploratory\ninstinct, and so, for the most part, when detected we are found out not\nonly to be in love, but to be rogues moreover.\n\nLady Mary was very kind; but had Lady Mary of her own mere motion taken all\nthis trouble? Was there no more energetic influence at the bottom of\nthat welcome chest of books, which arrived only half an hour later? The\ncirculating library of those days was not the epidemic and ubiquitous\ninfluence to which it has grown; and there were many places where it could\nnot find you out.\n\nAltogether that evening Bartram had acquired a peculiar beauty--a bright\nand mellow glow, in which even its gate-posts and wheelbarrow were\ninteresting, and next day came a little cloud--Dudley appeared.\n\n'You may be sure he wants money,' said Milly. 'He and father had words this\nmorning.'\n\nHe took a chair at our luncheon, found fault with everything in his own\nlaconic dialect, ate a good deal notwithstanding, and was sulky, and with\nMilly snappish. To me, on the contrary, when Milly went into the hall, he\nwas mild and whimpering, and disposed to be confidential.\n\n'There's the Governor says he hasn't a bob! Danged if I know how an old\nfellah in his bed-room muddles away money at that rate. I don't suppose he\nthinks I can git along without tin, and he knows them trustees won't gi'e\nme a tizzy till they get what they calls an opinion--dang 'em! Bryerly says\nhe doubts it must all go under settlement. They'll settle me nicely if\nthey do; and Governor knows all about it, and won't gi'e me a danged brass\nfarthin', an' me wi' bills to pay, an' lawyers--dang 'em--writing\nletters. He knows summat o' that hisself, does Governor; and he might ha'\nconsideration a bit for his own flesh and blood, _I_ say. But he never does\nnout for none but hisself. I'll sell his books and his jewels next fit he\ntakes--that's how I'll fit him.'\n\nThis amiable young man, glowering, with his elbows on the table and his\nfingers in his great whiskers, followed his homily, where clergymen append\nthe blessing, with a muttered variety of very different matter.\n\n'Now, Maud,' said he, pathetically, leaning back suddenly in his chair,\nwith all his conscious beauty and misfortunes in his face, 'is not it hard\nlines?'\n\nI thought the appeal was going to shape itself into an application for\nmoney; but it did not.\n\n'I never know'd a reel beauty--first-chop, of course, I mean--that\nwasn't kind along of it, and I'm a fellah as can't git along without\nsympathy--that's why I say it--an' isn't it hard lines? Now, _say_ it's\nhard lines--_haint_ it, Maud?'\n\nI did not know exactly what hard lines meant, but I said--\n\n'I suppose it is very disagreeable.'\n\nAnd with this concession, not caring to hear any more in the same vein, I\nrose, intending to take my departure.\n\n'No, that's jest it. I knew ye'd say it, Maud. Ye're a kind lass--ye\nbe--'tis in yer pretty face. I like ye awful, I do--there's not a handsomer\nlass in Liverpool nor Lunnon itself--_no_ where.'\n\nHe had seized my hand, and trying to place his arm about my waist, essayed\nthat salute which I had so narrowly escaped on my first introduction.\n\n'_Don't_, sir,' I exclaimed in high indignation, escaping at the same\nmoment from his grasp.\n\n'No offence, lass; no harm, Maud; you must not be so shy--we're cousins,\nyou know--an' I wouldn't hurt ye, Maud, no more nor I'd knock my head off.\nI wouldn't.'\n\nI did not wait to hear the rest of his tender protestations, but, without\nshowing how nervous I was, I glided out of the room quietly, making\nan orderly retreat, the more meritorious as I heard him call after me\npersuasively--'Come back, Maud. What are ye afeard on, lass? Come back, I\nsay--do now; there's a good wench.'\n\nAs Milly and I were taking our walk that day, in the direction of the\nWindmill Wood, to which, in consequence perhaps of some secret order, we\nhad now free access, we saw Beauty, for the first time since her illness,\nin the little yard, throwing grain to the poultry.\n\n'How do you find yourself to-day, Meg? I am _very_ glad to see you able to\nbe about again; but I hope it is not too soon.'\n\nWe were standing at the barred gate of the little enclosure, and quite\nclose to Meg, who, however, did not choose to raise her head, but,\ncontinuing to shower her grain and potato-skins among her hens and\nchickens, said in a low tone--\n\n'Father baint in sight? Look jist round a bit and say if ye see him.'\n\nBut Dickon's dusky red costume was nowhere visible.\n\nSo Meg looked up, pale and thin, and with her old grave, observant eyes,\nand she said quietly--\n\n''Tisn't that I'm not glad to see ye; but if father was to spy me talking\nfriendly wi' ye, now that I'm hearty, and you havin' no more call to me,\nhe'd be all'ays a watching and thinkin' I was tellin' o' tales, and 'appen\nhe'd want me to worrit ye for money, Miss Maud; an' 'tisn't here he'd spend\nit, but in the Feltram pottusses, he would, and we want for nothin' that's\ngood for us. But that's how 'twould be, an' he'd all'ays be a jawing and a\nlickin' of I; so don't mind me, Miss Maud, and 'appen I might do ye a good\nturn some day.'\n\nA few days after this little interview with Meg, as Milly and I were\nwalking briskly--for it was a clear frosty day--along the pleasant slopes\nof the sheep-walk, we were overtaken by Dudley Ruthyn. It was not a\npleasant surprise. There was this mitigation, however: we were on foot, and\nhe driving in a dog-cart along the track leading to the moor, with his dogs\nand gun. He brought his horse for a moment to a walk, and with a careless\nnod to me, removing his short pipe from his mouth, he said--\n\n'Governor's callin' for ye, Milly; and he told me to send you slick home to\nhim if I saw you, and I think he'll gi'e ye some money; but ye better take\nhim while he's in the humour, lass, or mayhap ye'll go long without.'\n\nAnd with those words, apparently intent on his game, he nodded again,\nand, pipe in mouth, drove at a quick trot over the slope of the hill, and\ndisappeared.\n\nSo I agreed to await Milly's return while she ran home, and rejoined me\nwhere I was. Away she ran, in high spirits, and I wandered listlessly about\nin search of some convenient spot to sit down upon, for I was a little\ntired.\n\nShe had not been gone five minutes, when I heard a step approaching, and\nlooking round, saw the dog-cart close by, the horse browsing on the short\ngrass, and Dudley Ruthyn within a few paces of me.\n\n'Ye see, Maud, I've bin thinkin' why you're so vexed wi' me, an' I thought\nI'd jest come back an' ask ye what I may a' done to anger ye so; there's no\nsin in that, I think--is there?'\n\n'I'm not angry. I did not say so. I hope that's enough,' I said, startled;\nand, notwithstanding my speech, _very_ angry, for I felt instinctively that\nMilly's despatch homeward was a mere trick, and I the dupe of this coarse\nstratagem.\n\n'Well then, if ye baint angry, so much the better, Maud. I only want to\nknow why you're afeard o' me. I never struck a man foul, much less hurt a\ngirl, in my days; besides, Maud, I likes ye too well to hurt ye. Dang it,\nlass, you're my cousin, ye know, and cousins is all'ays together and lovin'\nlike, an' none says again' it.'\n\n'I've nothing to explain--there _is_ nothing to explain. I've been quite\nfriendly,' I said, hurriedly.\n\n'_Friendly!_ Well, if there baint a cram! How can ye think it friendly,\nMaud, when ye won't a'most shake hands wi' me? It's enough to make a fellah\nsware, or cry a'most. Why d'ye like aggravatin' a poor devil? Now baint\nye an ill-natured little puss, Maud, an' I likin' ye so well? You're the\nprettiest lass in Derbyshire; there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ye.'\n\nAnd he backed his declaration with an oath.\n\n'Be so good, then, as to re-enter your dog-cart and drive away,' I replied,\nvery much incensed.\n\n'Now, there it is again! Ye can't speak me civil. Another fellah'd fly out,\nan' maybe kiss ye for spite; but I baint that sort, I'm all for coaxin' and\nkindness, an' ye won't let me. What _be_ you drivin' at, Maud?'\n\n'I think I've said very plainly, sir, that I wish to be alone. You've\n_nothing_ to say, except utter nonsense, and I've heard quite enough. Once\nfor all, I beg, sir, that you will be so good as to leave me.'\n\n'Well, now, look here, Maud; I'll do anything you like--burn me if I\ndon't--if you'll only jest be kind to me, like cousins should. What did\nI ever do to vex you? If you think I like any lass better than you--some\nfellah at Elverston's bin talkin', maybe--it's nout but lies an' nonsense.\nNot but there's lots o' wenches likes me well enough, though I be a plain\nlad, and speaks my mind straight out.'\n\n'I can't see that you are so frank, sir, as you describe; you have just\nplayed a shabby trick to bring about this absurd and most disagreeable\ninterview.'\n\n'And supposin' I did send that fool, Milly, out o' the way, to talk a bit\nwi' you here, where's the harm? Dang it, lass, ye mustn't be too hard.\nDidn't I say I'd do whatever ye wished?'\n\n'And you _won't_,' said I.\n\n'Ye mean to get along out o' this? Well, now, I _will_. There! No use, of\ncourse, askin' you to kiss and be friends, before I go, as cousins should.\nWell, don't be riled, lass, I'm not askin' it; only mind, I do like you\nawful, and 'appen I'll find ye in better humour another time. Good-bye,\nMaud; I'll make ye like me at last.'\n\nAnd with these words, to my comfort, he addressed himself to his horse and\npipe, and was soon honestly on his way to the moor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n_THE RIVALS_\n\n\nAll the time that Dudley chose to persecute me with his odious society, I\ncontinued to walk at a brisk pace toward home, so that I had nearly reached\nthe house when Milly met me, with a note which had arrived for me by the\npost, in her hand.\n\n'Here, Milly, are more verses. He is a very persevering poet, whoever he\nis.' So I broke the seal; but this time it was prose. And the first words\nwere 'Captain Oakley!'\n\nI confess to an odd sensation as these remarkable words met my eye. It\nmight possibly be a proposal. I did not wait to speculate, however, but\nread these sentences traced in the identical handwriting which had copied\nthe lines with which I had been twice favoured.\n\n'Captain Oakley presents his compliments to Miss Ruthyn, and trusts she\nwill excuse his venturing to ask whether, during his short stay in Feltram,\nhe might be permitted to pay his respects at Bartram-Haugh. He has been\nmaking a short visit to his aunt, and could not find himself so near\nwithout at least attempting to renew an acquaintance which he has never\nceased to cherish in memory. If Miss Ruthyn would be so very good as to\nfavour him with ever so short a reply to the question he ventures most\nrespectfully to ask, her decision would reach him at the Hall Hotel,\nFeltram.'\n\n'Well, he's a roundabout fellah, anyhow. Couldn't he come up and see you if\nhe wanted to? They poeters, they do love writing long yarns--don't they?'\nAnd with this reflection, Milly took the note and read it through again.\n\n'It's jolly polite anyhow, isn't it Maud?' said Milly, who had conned it\nover, and accepted it as a model composition.\n\nI must have been, I think, naturally a rather shrewd girl; and considering\nhow very little I had seen of the world--nothing in fact--I often wonder\nnow at the sage conclusions at which I arrived.\n\nWere I to answer this handsome and cunning fool according to his folly,\nin what position should I find myself? No doubt my reply would induce\na rejoinder, and that compel another note from me, and that invite yet\nanother from him; and however his might improve in warmth, they were sure\nnot to abate. Was it his impertinent plan, with this show of respect and\nceremony, to drag me into a clandestine correspondence? Inexperienced girl\nas I was, I fired at the idea of becoming his dupe, and fancying, perhaps,\nthat there was more in merely answering his note than it would have\namounted to, I said--\n\n'That kind of thing may answer very well with button-makers, but ladies\ndon't like it. What would your papa think of it if he found that I had been\nwriting to him, and seeing him without his permission? If he wanted to\nsee me he could have'--(I really did not know exactly what he could have\ndone)--'he could have timed his visit to Lady Knollys differently; at all\nevents, he has no right to place me in an embarrassing situation, and I am\ncertain Cousin Knollys would say so; and I think his note both shabby and\nimpertinent.'\n\nDecision was not with me an intellectual process. When quite cool I was the\nmost undecided of mortals, but once my feelings were excited I was prompt\nand bold.\n\n'I'll give the note to Uncle Silas,' I said, quickening my pace toward\nhome; 'he'll know what to do.'\n\nBut Milly, who, I fancy, had no objection to the little romance which the\nyoung officer proposed, told me that she could not see her father, that he\nwas ill, and not speaking to anyone.\n\n'And arn't ye making a plaguy row about nothin'? I lay a guinea if ye had\nnever set eyes on Lord Ilbury you'd a told him to come, and see ye, an'\nwelcome.'\n\n'Don't talk like a fool, Milly. You never knew me do anything deceitful.\nLord Ilbury has no more to do with it, you know very well, than the man in\nthe moon.'\n\nI was altogether very indignant. I did not speak another word to Milly. The\nproportions of the house are so great, that it is a much longer walk than\nyou would suppose from the hall-door to Uncle Silas's room. But I did not\ncool all that way; and it was not till I had just reached the lobby,\nand saw the sour, jealous face, and high caul of old Wyat, and felt the\ninfluence of that neighbourhood, that I paused to reconsider. I fancied\nthere was a cool consciousness of success behind all the deferential\nphraseology of Captain Oakley, which nettled me extremely. No; there could\nbe no doubt. I tapped softly at the door.\n\n'What is it _now_, Miss?' snarled the querulous old woman, with her\nshrivelled fingers on the door-handle.\n\n'Can I see my uncle for a moment?'\n\n'He's tired, and not a word from him all day long.'\n\n'Not ill, though?'\n\n'Awful bad in the night,' said the old crone, with a sudden savage glare in\nmy face, as if _I_ had brought it about.\n\n'Oh! I'm very sorry. I had not heard a word of it.'\n\n'No one does but old Wyat. There's Milly there never asks neither--his own\nchild!'\n\n'Weakness, or what?'\n\n'One o' them fits. He'll slide awa' in one o' them some day, and no one but\nold Wyat to know nor ask word about it; that's how 'twill be.'\n\n'Will you please hand him this note, if he is well enough to look at it,\nand say I am at the door?'\n\nShe took it with a peevish nod and a grunt, closing the door in my face,\nand in a few minutes returned--\n\n'Come in wi' ye,' said Dame Wyat, and I appeared.\n\nUncle Silas, who, after his nightly horror or vision, lay extended on a\nsofa, with his faded yellow silk dressing-gown about him, his long white\nhair hanging toward the ground, and that wild and feeble smile lighting his\nface--a glimmer I feared to look upon--his long thin arms lay by his sides,\nwith hands and fingers that stirred not, except when now and then, with a\nfeeble motion, he wet his temples and forehead with eau de Cologne from a\nglass saucer placed beside him.\n\n'Excellent girl! dutiful ward and niece!' murmured the oracle; 'heaven\nreward you--your frank dealing is your own safety and my peace. Sit you\ndown, and say who is this Captain Oakley, when you made his acquaintance,\nwhat his age, fortune, and expectations, and who the aunt he mentions.'\n\nUpon all these points I satisfied him as fully as I was able.\n\n'Wyat--the white drops,' he called, in a thin, stern tone. 'I'll write a\nline presently. I can't see visitors, and, of course, you can't receive\nyoung captains before you've come out. Farewell! God bless you, dear.'\n\nWyat was dropping the 'white' restorative into a wine-glass and the room\nwas redolent of ether. I was glad to escape. The figures and whole _mise en\nsc\u00c3\u00a8ne_ were unearthly.\n\n'Well, Milly,' I said, as I met her in the hall, 'your papa is going to\nwrite to him.'\n\nI sometimes wonder whether Milly was right, and how I should have acted a\nfew months earlier.\n\nNext day whom should we meet in the Windmill Wood but Captain Oakley. The\nspot where this interesting _rencontre_ occurred was near that ruinous\nbridge on my sketch of which I had received so many compliments. It was\nso great a surprise that I had not time to recollect my indignation, and,\nhaving received him very affably, I found it impossible, during our brief\ninterview, to recover my lost altitude.\n\nAfter our greetings were over, and some compliments neatly made, he said--\n\n'I had such a curious note from Mr. Silas Ruthyn. I am sure he thinks me a\nvery impertinent fellow, for it was really anything but inviting--extremely\nrude, in fact. But I could not quite see that because he does not want\nme to invade his bed-room--an incursion I never dreamed of--I was not to\npresent myself to you, who had already honoured me with your acquaintance,\nwith the sanction of those who were most interested in your welfare, and\nwho were just as well qualified as he, I fancy, to say who were qualified\nfor such an honour.'\n\n'My uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn, you are aware, is my guardian; and this is my\ncousin, his daughter.'\n\nThis was an opportunity of becoming a little lofty, and I improved it. He\nraised his hat and bowed to Milly.\n\n'I'm afraid I've been very rude and stupid. Mr. Ruthyn, of course, has a\nperfect right to--to--in fact, I was not the least aware that I had the\nhonour of so near a relation's--a--a--and what exquisite scenery you\nhave! I think this country round Feltram particularly fine; and this\nBartram-Haugh is, I venture to say, about the very most beautiful spot in\nthis beautiful region. I do assure you I am tempted beyond measure to make\nFeltram and the Hall Hotel my head-quarters for at least a week. I only\nregret the foliage; but your trees show wonderfully, even in winter, so\nmany of them have got that ivy about them. They say it spoils trees, but it\ncertainly beautifies them. I have just ten days' leave unexpired; I wish\nI could induce you to advise me how to apply them. What shall I do, Miss\nRuthyn?'\n\n'I am the worst person in the world to make plans, even for myself, I find\nit so troublesome. What do you say? Suppose you try Wales or Scotland, and\nclimb up some of those fine mountains that look so well in winter?'\n\n'I should much prefer Feltram. I so wish you would recommend _it_. What is\nthis pretty plant?'\n\n'We call that Maud's myrtle. She planted it, and it's very pretty when it's\nfull in blow,' said Milly.\n\nOur visit to Elverston had been of immense use to us both.\n\n'Oh! planted by _you?_' he said, very softly, with a momentary\ncorresponding glance. 'May I--ever so little--just a leaf?'\n\nAnd without waiting for permission, he held a sprig of it next his\nwaistcoat.\n\n'Yes, it goes very prettily with those buttons. They are _very_ pretty\nbuttons; are not they, Milly? A present, a souvenir, I dare say?'\n\nThis was a terrible hit at the button-maker, and I thought he looked a\nlittle oddly at me, but my countenance was so 'bewitchingly simple' that I\nsuppose his suspicions were allayed.\n\nNow, it was very odd of me, I must confess, to talk in this way, and to\nreceive all those tender allusions from a gentleman about whom I had spoken\nand felt so sharply only the evening before. But Bartram was abominably\nlonely. A civilised person was a valuable waif or stray in that region of\nthe picturesque and the brutal; and to my lady reader especially, because\nshe will probably be hardest upon me, I put it--can you not recollect any\nsuch folly in your own past life? Can you not in as many minutes call to\nmind at least six similar inconsistencies of your own practising? For my\npart, I really can't see the advantage of being the weaker sex if we are\nalways to be as strong as our masculine neighbours.\n\nThere was, indeed, no revival of the little sentiment which I had once\nexperienced. When these things once expire, I do believe they are as hard\nto revive as our dead lap-dogs, guinea-pigs, and parrots. It was my perfect\ncoolness which enabled me to chat, I flatter myself, so agreeably with the\nrefined Captain, who plainly thought me his captive, and was probably\nnow and then thinking what was to be done to utilise that little bit of\nBartram, or to beautify some other, when he should see fit to become its\nmaster, as we rambled over these wild but beautiful grounds.\n\nIt was just about then that Milly nudged me rather vehemently, and\nwhispered 'Look there!'\n\nI followed with mine the direction of her eyes, and saw my odious cousin,\nDudley, in a flagrant pair of cross-barred peg-tops, and what Milly before\nher reformation used to call other 'slops' of corresponding atrocity,\napproaching our refined little party with great strides. I really think\nthat Milly was very nearly ashamed of him. I certainly was. I had no\napprehension, however, of the scene which was imminent.\n\nThe charming Captain mistook him probably for some rustic servant of the\nplace, for he continued his agreeable remarks up to the very moment when\nDudley, whose face was pale with anger, and whose rapid advance had not\nserved to cool him, without recollecting to salute either Milly or me,\naccosted our elegant companion as follows:--\n\n'By your leave, master, baint you summat in the wrong box here, don't you\nthink?'\n\nHe had planted himself directly in his front, and looked unmistakably\nmenacing.\n\n'May I speak to him? Will you excuse me?' said the Captain blandly.\n\n'Ow--ay, they'll excuse ye ready enough, I dessay; you're to deal wi' me\nthough. Baint ye in the wrong box now?'\n\n'I'm not conscious, sir, of being in a box at all,' replied the Captain,\nwith severe disdain. 'It strikes me you are disposed to get up a row. Let\nus, if you please, get a little apart from the ladies if that is your\npurpose.'\n\n'I mean to turn you out o' this the way ye came. If you make a row, so much\nthe wuss for you, for I'll lick ye to fits.'\n\n'Tell him not to fight,' whispered Milly; 'he'll a no chance wi' Dudley.'\n\nI saw Dickon Hawkes grinning over the paling on which he leaned.\n\n'Mr. Hawkes,' I said, drawing Milly with me toward that unpromising\nmediator, 'pray prevent unpleasantness and go between them.'\n\n'An' git licked o' both sides? Rather not, Miss, thank ye,' grinned Dickon,\ntranquilly.\n\n'Who are you, sir?' demanded our romantic acquaintance, with military\nsternness.\n\n'I'll tell you who you are--you're Oakley, as stops at the Hall, that\nGovernor wrote, over-night, not to dare show your nose inside the grounds.\nYou're a half-starved cappen, come down here to look for a wife, and----'\n\nBefore Dudley could finish his sentence, Captain Oakley, than whose face no\nregimentals could possibly have been more scarlet, at that moment, struck\nwith his switch at Dudley's handsome features.\n\nI don't know how it was done--by some 'devilish cantrip slight.' A smack\nwas heard, and the Captain lay on his back on the ground, with his mouth\nfull of blood.\n\n'How do ye like the taste o' that?' roared Dickon, from his post of\nobservation.\n\nIn an instant Captain Oakley was on his feet again, hatless, looking quite\nfrantic, and striking out at Dudley, who was ducking and dipping quite\ncoolly, and again the same horrid sound, only this time it was double, like\na quick postman's knock, and Captain Oakley was on the grass again.\n\n'Tapped his smeller, by--!' thundered Dickon, with a roar of laughter.\n\n'Come away, Milly--I'm growing ill,' said I.\n\n'Drop it, Dudley, I tell ye; you'll kill him,' screamed Milly.\n\nBut the devoted Captain, whose nose, and mouth, and shirt-front formed now\nbut one great patch of blood, and who was bleeding beside over one eye,\ndashed at him again.\n\nI turned away. I felt quite faint, and on the point of crying, with mere\nhorror.\n\n'Hammer away at his knocker,' bellowed Dickon, in a frenzy of delight.\n\n'He'll break it now, if it ain't already,' cried Milly, alluding, as I\nafterwards understood, to the Captain's Grecian nose.\n\n'Brayvo, little un!' The Captain was considerably the taller.\n\nAnother smack, and, I suppose, Captain Oakley fell once more.\n\n'Hooray! the dinner-service again, by ----,' roared Dickon. 'Stick to that.\nOver the same ground--subsoil, I say. He han't enough yet.'\n\nIn a perfect tremor of disgust, I was making as quick a retreat as I could,\nand as I did, I heard Captain Oakley shriek hoarsely--\n\n'You're a d---- prizefighter; I can't box you.'\n\n'I told ye I'd lick ye to fits,' hooted Dudley.\n\n'But you're the son of a gentleman, and by ---- you shall fight me _as_ a\ngentleman.'\n\nA yell of hooting laughter from Dudley and Dickon followed this sally.\n\n'Gi'e my love to the Colonel, and think o' me when ye look in the\nglass--won't ye? An' so you're goin' arter all; well, follow what's left o'\nyer nose. Ye forgot some o' yer ivories, didn't ye, on th' grass?'\n\nThese and many similar jibes followed the mangled Captain in his retreat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n_DOCTOR BRYERLY REAPPEARS_\n\n\nNo one who has not experienced it can imagine the nervous disgust and\nhorror which such a spectacle as we had been forced in part to witness\nleaves upon the mind of a young person of my peculiar temperament.\n\nIt affected ever after my involuntary estimate of the principal actors in\nit. An exhibition of such thorough inferiority, accompanied by such a shock\nto the feminine sense of elegance, is not forgotten by any woman. Captain\nOakley had been severely beaten by a smaller man. It was pitiable, but also\nundignified; and Milly's anxieties about his teeth and nose, though in a\ncertain sense horrible, had also a painful suspicion of the absurd.\n\nPeople say, on the other hand, that superior prowess, even in such\nbarbarous contests, inspires in our sex an interest akin to admiration. I\ncan positively say in my case it was quite the reverse. Dudley Ruthyn stood\nlower than ever in my estimation; for though I feared him more, it was by\nreason of these brutal and cold-blooded associations.\n\nAfter this I lived in constant apprehension of being summoned to my uncle's\nroom, and being called on for an explanation of my meeting with Captain\nOakley, which, notwithstanding my perfect innocence, looked suspicious, but\nno such inquisition resulted. Perhaps he did not suspect me; or, perhaps,\nhe thought, not in his haste, all women are liars, and did not care to hear\nwhat I might say. I rather lean to the latter interpretation.\n\nThe exchequer just now, I suppose, by some means, was replenished, for next\nmorning Dudley set off upon one of his fashionable excursions, as poor\nMilly thought them, to Wolverhampton. And the same day Dr. Bryerly arrived.\n\nMilly and I, from my room window, saw him step from his vehicle to the\ncourt-yard.\n\nA lean man, with sandy hair and whiskers, was in the chaise with him. Dr.\nBryerly descended in the unchangeable black suit that always looked new and\nnever fitted him.\n\nThe Doctor looked careworn, and older, I thought, by several years, than\nwhen I last saw him. He was not shown up to my uncle's room; on the\ncontrary, Milly, who was more actively curious than I, ascertained that our\ntremulous butler informed him that my uncle was not sufficiently well for\nan interview. Whereupon Dr. Bryerly had pencilled a note, the reply to\nwhich was a message from Uncle Silas, saying that he would be happy to see\nhim in five minutes.\n\nAs Milly and I were conjecturing what it might mean, and before the five\nminutes had expired, Mary Quince entered.\n\n'Wyat bid me tell you, Miss, your uncle wants you _this minute_.'\n\nWhen I entered his room, Uncle Silas was seated at the table, with his desk\nbefore him. He looked up. Could anything be more dignified, suffering, and\nvenerable?\n\n'I sent for you, dear,' he said very gently, extending his thin, white\nhand, and taking mine, which he held affectionately while he spoke,\n'because I desire to have no secrets, and wish you thoroughly to know all\nthat concerns your own interests while subject to my guardianship; and I am\nhappy to think, my beloved niece, that you requite my candour. Oh, here is\nthe gentleman. Sit down, dear.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly was advancing, as it seemed, to shake hands with Uncle\nSilas, who, however, rose with a severe and haughty air, not the least\nover-acted, and made him a slow, ceremonious bow. I wondered how the homely\nDoctor could confront so tranquilly that astounding statue of hauteur.\n\nA faint and weary smile, rather sad than comtemptuous, was the only sign he\nshowed of feeling his repulse.\n\n'How do _you_ do, Miss?' he said, extending his hand, and greeting me after\nhis ungallant fashion, as if it were an afterthought.\n\n'I think I may as well take a chair, sir,' said Doctor Bryerly, sitting\ndown serenely, near the table, and crossing his ungainly legs.\n\nMy uncle bowed.\n\n'You understand the nature of the business, sir. Do you wish Miss Ruthyn to\nremain?' asked Doctor Bryerly.\n\n'I _sent_ for her, sir,' replied my uncle, in a very gentle and sarcastic\ntone, a smile on his thin lips, and his strangely-contorted eyebrows raised\nfor a moment contemptuously. 'This gentleman, my dear Maud, thinks proper\nto insinuate that I am robbing you. It surprises me a little, and, no\ndoubt, you--I've nothing to conceal, and wished you to be present while\nhe favours me more particularly with his views. I'm right, I think, in\ndescribing it as _robbery_, sir?'\n\n'Why,' said Doctor Bryerly thoughtfully, for he was treating the matter\nas one of right, and not of feeling, 'it would be, certainly, taking that\nwhich does not belong to you, and converting it to your own use; but, at\nthe worst, it would more resemble _thieving_, I think, than robbery.'\n\nI saw Uncle Silas's lip, eyelid, and thin cheek quiver and shrink, as if\nwith a thrill of tic-douloureux, as Doctor Bryerly spoke this unconsciously\ninsulting answer. My uncle had, however, the self-command which is learned\nat the gaming-table. He shrugged, with a chilly, sarcastic, little laugh,\nand a glance at me.\n\n'Your note says _waste_, I think, sir?'\n\n'Yes, waste--the felling and sale of timber in the Windmill Wood, the\nselling of oak bark and burning of charcoal, as I'm informed,' said\nBryerly, as sadly and quietly as a man might relate a piece of intelligence\nfrom the newspaper.\n\n'Detectives? or private spies of your own--or, perhaps, my servants, bribed\nwith my poor brother's money? A very high-minded procedure.'\n\n'Nothing of the kind, sir.'\n\nMy uncle sneered.\n\n'I mean, sir, there has been no undue canvass for evidence, and the\nquestion is simply one of right; and it is our duty to see that this\ninexperienced young lady is not defrauded.'\n\n'By her own uncle?'\n\n'By anyone,' said Doctor Bryerly, with a natural impenetrability that\nexcited my admiration.\n\n'Of course you come armed with an opinion?' said my smiling uncle,\ninsinuatingly.\n\n'The case is before Mr. Serjeant Grinders. These bigwigs don't return their\ncases sometimes so quickly as we could wish.'\n\n'Then you have _no_ opinion?' smiled my uncle.\n\n'My solicitor is quite clear upon it; and it seems to me there can be no\nquestion raised, but for form's sake.'\n\n'Yes, for form's sake you take one, and in the meantime, upon a nice\nquestion of law, the surmises of a thick-headed attorney and of an\ningenious apoth--I beg pardon, physician--are sufficient warrant for\ntelling my niece and ward, in my presence, that I am defrauding her!'\n\nMy uncle leaned back in his chair, and smiled with a contemptuous patience\nover Doctor Bryerly's head, as he spoke.\n\n'I don't know whether I used that expression, sir, but I am speaking merely\nin a technical sense. I mean to say, that, whether by mistake or otherwise,\nyou are exercising a power which you don't lawfully possess, and that the\neffect of that is to impoverish the estate, and, by so much as it benefits\nyou, to wrong this young lady.'\n\n'I'm a technical defrauder, I see, and your manner conveys the rest. I\nthank my God, sir, I am a _very_ different man from what I once was.' Uncle\nSilas was speaking in a low tone, and with extraordinary deliberation. 'I\nremember when I should have certainly knocked you down, sir, or _tried_ it,\nat least, for a great deal less.'\n\n'But seriously, sir, what _do_ you propose?' asked Doctor Bryerly, sternly\nand a little flushed, for I think the old man was stirred within him; and\nthough he did not raise his voice, his manner was excited.\n\n'I propose to defend my rights, sir,' murmured Uncle Silas, very grim. 'I'm\nnot without an opinion, though you are.'\n\nYou seem to think, sir, that I have a pleasure in annoying you; you are\nquite wrong. I hate annoying anyone--constitutionally--I _hate_ it; but\ndon't you see, sir, the position I'm placed in? I wish I could please\neveryone, and do my duty.'\n\nUncle Silas bowed and smiled.\n\n'I've brought with me the Scotch steward from Tolkingden, _your_ estate,\nMiss, and if you let us we will visit the spot and make a note of what we\nobserve, that is, assuming that you admit waste, and merely question our\nlaw.'\n\n'If you please, sir, you and your Scotchman shall do _no such thing_; and,\nbearing in mind that I neither deny nor admit anything, you will please\nfurther never more to present yourself, under any pretext whatsoever,\neither in this house or on the grounds of Bartram-Haugh, during my\nlifetime.'\n\nUncle Silas rose up with the same glassy smile and scowl, in token that the\ninterview was ended.\n\n'Good-bye, sir,' said Doctor Bryerly, with a sad and thoughtful air, and\nhesitating for a moment, he said to me, 'Do you think, Miss, you could\nafford me a word in the hall?'\n\n'Not a word, sir,' snarled Uncle Silas, with a white flash from his eyes.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n'Sit where you are, Maud.'\n\nAnother pause.\n\n'If you have anything to say to my ward, sir, you will please to say it\n_here_.'\n\nDoctor Bryerly's dark and homely face was turned on me with an expression\nof unspeakable compassion.\n\n'I was going to say, that if you think of any way in which I can be of the\nleast service, Miss, I'm ready to act, that's all; mind, _any_ way.'\n\nHe hesitated, looking at me with the same expression as if he had something\nmore to say; but he only repeated--\n\n'That's all, Miss.'\n\n'Won't you shake hands, Doctor Bryerly, before you go?' I said, eagerly\napproaching him.\n\nWithout a smile, with the same sad anxiety in his face, with his mind, as\nit seemed to me, on something else, and irresolute whether to speak it or\nbe silent, he took my fingers in a very cold hand, and holding it so, and\nslowly shaking it, his grave and troubled glance unconsciously rested on\nUncle Silas's face, while in a sad tone and absent way he said--\n\n'Good-bye, Miss.'\n\nFrom before that sad gaze my uncle averted his strange eyes quickly, and\nlooked, oddly, to the window.\n\nIn a moment more Doctor Bryerly let my hand go with a sigh, and with an\nabrupt little nod to me, he left the room; and I heard that dismallest of\nsounds, the retreating footsteps of a true friend, _lost_.\n\n'Lead us not into temptation; if we pray so, we must not mock the eternal\nMajesty of Heaven by walking into temptation of our own accord.'\n\nThis oracular sentence was not uttered by my uncle until Doctor Bryerly had\nbeen gone at least five minutes.\n\n'I've forbid him my house, Maud--first, because his perfectly unconscious\ninsolence tries my patience nearly beyond endurance; and again, because I\nhave heard unfavourable reports of him. On the question of right which he\ndisputes, I am perfectly informed. I am your tenant, my dear niece; when\nI am gone you will learn how _scrupulous_ I have been; you will see how,\nunder the pressure of the most agonising pecuniary difficulties, the\nterrific penalty of a misspent youth, I have been careful never by a hair's\nbreadth to transgress the strict line of my legal privileges; alike, as\nyour tenant, Maud, and as your guardian; how, amid frightful agitations,\nI have kept myself, by the miraculous strength and grace vouchsafed\nme--_pure_.\n\n'The world,' he resumed after a short pause, 'has no faith in any man's\nconversion; it never forgets what he was, it never believes him anything\nbetter, it is an inexorable and stupid judge. What I was I will describe in\nblacker terms, and with more heartfelt detestation, than my traducers--a\nreckless prodigal, a godless profligate. Such I was; what I am, I am. If\nI had no hope beyond this world, of all men most miserable; but with that\nhope, a sinner saved.'\n\nThen he waxed eloquent and mystical. I think his Swedenborgian studies had\ncrossed his notions of religion with strange lights. I never could follow\nhim quite in these excursions into the region of symbolism. I only\nrecollect that he talked of the deluge and the waters of Mara, and said, 'I\nam washed--I am sprinkled,' and then, pausing, bathed his thin temples and\nforehead with eau de Cologne; a process which was, perhaps, suggested by\nhis imagery of sprinkling and so forth.\n\nThus refreshed, he sighed and smiled, and passed to the subject of Doctor\nBryerly.\n\n'Of Doctor Bryerly, I know that he is sly, that he loves money, was born\npoor, and makes nothing by his profession. But he possesses many thousand\npounds, under my poor brother's will, of _your money_; and he has glided\nwith, of course a modest \"nolo episcopari,\" into the acting trusteeship,\nwith all its multitudinous opportunities, of your immense property. That\nis not doing so badly for a visionary Swedenborgian. Such a man _must_\nprosper. But if he expected to make money of me, he is disappointed.\nMoney, however, he will make of his trusteeship, as you will see. It is a\ndangerous resolution. But if he will seek the life of Dives, the worst I\nwish him is to find the death of Lazarus. But whether, like Lazarus, he be\nborne of angels into Abraham's bosom, or, like the rich man, only dies\nand is buried, and _the rest_, neither living nor dying do I desire his\ncompany.'\n\nUncle Silas here seemed suddenly overtaken by exhaustion. He leaned back\nwith a ghastly look, and his lean features glistened with the dew of\nfaintness. I screamed for Wyat. But he soon recovered sufficiently to smile\nhis odd smile, and with it and his frown, nodded and waved me away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\n_QUESTION AND ANSWER_\n\n\nMy uncle, after all, was not ill that day, after the strange fashion of his\nmalady, be it what it might. Old Wyat repeated in her sour laconic way that\nthere was 'nothing to speak of amiss with him.' But there remained with\nme a sense of pain and fear. Doctor Bryerly, notwithstanding my uncle's\nsarcastic reflections, remained, in my estimation, a true and wise friend.\nI had all my life been accustomed to rely upon others, and here, haunted by\nmany unavowed and ill-defined alarms and doubts, the disappearance of an\nactive and able friend caused my heart to sink.\n\nStill there remained my dear Cousin Monica, and my pleasant and trusted\nfriend, Lord Ilbury; and in less than a week arrived an invitation from\nLady Mary to the Grange, for me and Milly, to meet Lady Knollys. It\nwas accompanied, she told me, by a note from Lord Ilbury to my uncle,\nsupporting her request; and in the afternoon I received a message to attend\nmy uncle in his room.\n\n'An invitation from Lady Mary Carysbroke for you and Milly to meet Monica\nKnollys; have you received it?' asked my uncle, so soon as I was seated.\nAnswered in the affirmative, he continued--\n\n'Now, Maud Ruthyn, I expect the truth from you; I have been frank, so shall\nyou. Have you ever heard me spoken ill of by Lady Knollys?'\n\nI was quite taken aback.\n\nI felt my cheeks flushing. I was returning his fierce cold gaze with a\nstupid stare, and remained dumb.\n\n'Yes, Maud, you _have_.'\n\nI looked down in silence.\n\n'I _know_ it; but it is right you should answer; have you or have you not?'\n\nI had to clear my voice twice or thrice. There was a kind of spasm in my\nthroat.\n\n'I am trying to recollect,' I said at last.\n\n'_Do_ recollect,' he replied imperiously.\n\nThere was a little interval of silence. I would have given the world to be,\non any conditions, anywhere else in the world.\n\n'Surely, Maud, you don't wish to deceive your guardian? Come, the question\nis a plain one, and I know the truth already. I ask you again--have you\never heard me spoken ill of by Lady Knollys?'\n\n'Lady Knollys,' I said, half articulately,' speaks very freely, and often\nhalf in jest; but,' I continued, observing something menacing in his face,\n'I have heard her express disapprobation of some things you have done.'\n\n'Come, Maud,' he continued, in a stern, though still a low key, 'did she\nnot insinuate that charge--then, I suppose, in a state of incubation,\nthe other day presented here full-fledged, with beak and claws, by that\nscheming apothecary--the statement that I was defrauding you by cutting\ndown timber upon the grounds?'\n\n'She certainly did mention the circumstance; but she also argued that it\nmight have been through ignorance of the extent of your rights.'\n\n'Come, come, Maud, you must not prevaricate, girl. I _will_ have it. Does\nshe not habitually speak disparagingly of me, in your presence, and _to_\nyou? _Answer_.'\n\nI hung my head.\n\n'Yes or no?'\n\n'Well, perhaps so--yes,' I faltered, and burst into tears.\n\n'There, don't cry; it may well shock you. Did she not, to your knowledge,\nsay the same things in presence of my child Millicent? I know it, I\nrepeat--there is no use in hesitating; and I command you to answer.'\n\nSobbing, I told the truth.\n\n'Now sit still, while I write my reply.'\n\nHe wrote, with the scowl and smile so painful to witness, as he looked down\nupon the paper, and then he placed the note before me--\n\n'Read that, my dear.'\n\nIt began--\n\n'MY DEAR LADY KNOLLYS.--You have favoured me with a note, adding your\nrequest to that of Lord Ilbury, that I should permit my ward and my\ndaughter to avail themselves of Lady Mary's invitation. Being perfectly\ncognisant of the ill-feeling you have always and unaccountably cherished\ntoward me, and also of the terms in which you have had the delicacy and the\nconscience to speak of me before and to my child and my ward, I can only\nexpress my amazement at the modesty of your request, while peremptorily\nrefusing it. And I shall conscientiously adopt effectual measures to\nprevent your ever again having an opportunity of endeavouring to destroy my\ninfluence and authority over my ward and my child, by direct or insinuated\nslander.\n\n'Your defamed and injured kinsman,\n\nSILAS RUTHYN.'\n\nI was stunned; yet what could I plead against the blow that was to isolate\nme? I wept aloud, with my hands clasped, looking on the marble face of the\nold man.\n\nWithout seeming to hear, he folded and sealed his note, and then proceeded\nto answer Lord Ilbury.\n\nWhen that note was written, he placed it likewise before me, and I read it\nalso through. It simply referred him to Lady Knollys 'for an explanation\nof the unhappy circumstances which compelled him to decline an invitation\nwhich it would have made his niece and his daughter so happy to accept.'\n\n'You see, my dear Maud, how frank I am with you,' he said, waving the open\nnote, which I had just read, slightly before he folded it. 'I think I may\nask you to reciprocate my candour.'\n\nDismissed from this interview, I ran to Milly, who burst into tears from\nsheer disappointment, so we wept and wailed together. But in my grief I\nthink there was more reason.\n\nI sat down to the dismal task of writing to my dear Lady Knollys. I\nimplored her to make her peace with my uncle. I told her how frank he had\nbeen with me, and how he had shown me his sad reply to her letter. I told\nher of the interview to which he had himself invited me with Dr. Bryerly;\nhow little disturbed he was by the accusation--no sign of guilt; quite the\ncontrary, perfect confidence. I implored of her to think the best, and\nremembering my isolation, to accomplish a reconciliation with Uncle Silas.\n'Only think,' I wrote, 'I only nineteen, and two years of solitude before\nme. What a separation!' No broken merchant ever signed the schedule of his\nbankruptcy with a heavier heart than did I this letter.\n\nThe griefs of youth are like the wounds of the gods--there is an ichor\nwhich heals the scars from which it flows: and thus Milly and I consoled\nourselves, and next day enjoyed our ramble, our talk and readings, with a\nwonderful resignation to the inevitable.\n\nMilly and I stood in the relation of _Lord Duberly_ to _Doctor Pangloss_. I\nwas to mend her 'cackleology,' and the occupation amused us both. I think\nat the bottom of our submission to destiny lurked a hope that Uncle Silas,\nthe inexorable, would relent, or that Cousin Monica, that siren, would win\nand melt him to her purpose.\n\nWhatever comfort, however, I derived from the absence of Dudley was not to\nbe of very long duration; for one morning, as I was amusing myself alone,\nwith a piece of worsted work, thinking, and just at that moment not\nunpleasantly, of many things, my cousin Dudley entered the room.\n\n'Back again, like a bad halfpenny, ye see. And how a' ye bin ever since,\nlass? Purely, I warrant, be your looks. I'm jolly glad to see ye, I am; no\ncattle going like ye, Maud.'\n\n'I think I must ask you to let go my hand, as I can't continue my work,' I\nsaid, very stiffly, hoping to chill his enthusiasm a little.\n\n'Anything to pleasure ye, Maud, 'tain't in my heart to refuse ye nout. I\na'bin to Wolverhampton, lass--jolly row there--and run over to Leamington;\na'most broke my neck, faith, wi' a borrowed horse arter the dogs; ye would\nna care, Maud, if I broke my neck, would ye? Well, 'appen, jest a little,'\nhe good-naturedly supplied, as I was silent.\n\n'Little over a week since I left here, by George; and to me it's half the\nalmanac like; can ye guess the reason, Maud?'\n\n'Have you seen your sister, Milly, or your father, since your return?' I\nasked coldly.\n\n'_They'll_ keep, Maud, never mind 'em; it be you I want to see--it be you\nI wor thinkin' on a' the time. I tell ye, lass, I'm all'ays a thinkin' on\nye.'\n\n'I think you ought to go and see your father; you have been away, you say,\nsome time. I don't think it is respectful,' I said, a little sharply.\n\n'If ye bid me go I'd a'most go, but I could na quite; there's nout on earth\nI would na do for you, Maud, excep' leaving you.'\n\n'And that,' I said, with a petulant flush, 'is the only thing on earth I\nwould ask you to do.'\n\n'Blessed if you baint a blushin', Maud,' he drawled, with an odious grin.\n\nHis stupidity was proof against everything.\n\n'It is _too_ bad!' I muttered, with an indignant little pat of my foot and\nmimic stamp.\n\n'Well, you lasses be queer cattle; ye're angry wi' me now, cos ye think\nI got into mischief--ye do, Maud; ye know't, ye buxsom little fool, down\nthere at Wolverhampton; and jest for that ye're ready to turn me off again\nthe minute I come back; 'tisn't fair.'\n\n'I don't _understand_ you, sir; and I _beg_ that you'll leave me.'\n\n'Now, didn't I tell ye about leavin' ye, Maud? 'tis the only thing I can't\ncompass for yer sake. I'm jest a child in yere hands, I am, ye know. I can\nlick a big fellah to pot as limp as a rag, by George!'--(his oaths were not\nreally so mild)--'ye see summat o' that t'other day. Well, don't be vexed,\nMaud; 'twas all along o' you; ye know, I wor a bit jealous, 'appen; but\nanyhow I can do it; and look at me here, jest a child, I say, in yer\nhands.'\n\n'I wish you'd go away. Have you nothing to do, and no one to see? Why\n_can't_ you leave me alone, sir?'\n\n''Cos I can't, Maud, that's jest why; and I wonder, Maud, how can you be so\nill-natured, when you see me like this; how can ye?'\n\n'I wish Milly would come,' said I peevishly, looking toward the door.\n\n'Well, I'll tell you how it is, Maud. I may as well have it out. I like\nyou better than any lass that ever I saw, a deal; you're nicer by chalks;\nthere's none like ye--there isn't; and I wish you'd have me. I ha'n't much\ntin--father's run through a deal, he's pretty well up a tree, ye know; but\nthough I baint so rich as some folk, I'm a better man, 'appen; and if ye'd\ntake a tidy lad, that likes ye awful, and 'id die for your sake, why here\nhe is.'\n\n'What can you mean, sir?' I exclaimed, rising in indignant bewilderment.\n\n'I mean, Maud, if ye'll marry me, you'll never ha' cause to complain; I'll\nnever let ye want for nout, nor gi'e ye a wry word.'\n\n'Actually a proposal!' I ejaculated, like a person speaking in a dream.\n\nI stood with my hand on the back of a chair, staring at Dudley; and\nlooking, I dare say, as stupefied as I felt.\n\n'There's a good lass, ye would na deny me,' said the odious creature,\nwith one knee on the seat of the chair behind which I was standing, and\nattempting to place his arm lovingly round my neck.\n\nThis effectually roused me, and starting back, I stamped upon the ground\nwith actual fury.\n\n'What has there ever been, sir, in my conduct, words, or looks, to\nwarrant this unparalleled audacity? But that you are as stupid as you are\nimpertinent, brutal, and ugly, you must, long ago, sir, have seen how I\ndislike you. How dare you, sir? Don't presume to obstruct me; I'm going to\nmy uncle.'\n\nI had never spoken so violently to mortal before.\n\nHe in turn looked a little confounded; and I passed his extended but\nmotionless arm with a quick and angry step.\n\nHe followed me a pace or two, however, before I reached the door, looking\nhorridly angry, but stopped, and only swore after me some of those 'wry\nwords' which I was never to have heard. I was myself, however, too much\nincensed, and moving at too rapid a pace, to catch their import; and I had\nknocked at my uncle's door before I began to collect my thoughts.\n\n'Come in,' replied my uncle's voice, clear, thin, and peevish.\n\nI entered and confronted him.\n\n'Your son, sir, has insulted me.'\n\nHe looked at me with a cold curiosity steadly for a few seconds, as I stood\npanting before him with flaming cheeks.\n\n'Insulted you?' repeated he. 'Egad, you surprise me!'\n\nThe ejaculation savoured of 'the old man,' to borrow his scriptural phrase,\nmore than anything I had heard from him before.\n\n'_How?_' he continued; 'how has Dudley _insulted_ you, my dear child? Come,\nyou're excited; sit down; take time, and tell me all about it. I did not\nknow that Dudley was here.'\n\n'I--he--it _is_ an insult. He knew very well--he _must_ know I dislike him;\nand he presumed to make a proposal of marriage to me.'\n\n'O--o--oh!' exclaimed my uncle, with a prolonged intonation which plainly\nsaid, Is that the mighty matter?\n\nHe looked at me as he leaned back with the same steady curiosity, this time\nsmiling, which somehow frightened me, and his countenance looked to me\nwicked, like the face of a witch, with a guilt I could not understand.\n\n'And that is the amount of your complaint. He made you a formal proposal of\nmarriage!'\n\n'Yes; he proposed for me.'\n\nAs I cooled, I began to feel just a very little disconcerted, and a\nsuspicion was troubling me that possibly an indifferent person might think\nthat, having no more to complain of, my language was perhaps a little\nexaggerated, and my demeanour a little too tempestuous.\n\nMy uncle, I dare say, saw some symptoms of this misgiving, for, smiling\nstill, he said--\n\n'My dear Maud, however just, you appear to me a little cruel; you don't\nseem to remember how much you are yourself to blame; you have one faithful\nfriend at least, whom I advise your consulting--I mean your looking-glass.\nThe foolish fellow is young, quite ignorant in the world's ways. He is in\nlove--desperately enamoured.\n\n  Aimer c'est craindre, et craindre c'est souffrir.\n\nAnd suffering prompts to desperate remedies. We must not be too hard on a\nrough but romantic young fool, who talks according to his folly and his\npain.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n_AN APPARITION_\n\n\n'But, after all,' he suddenly resumed, as if a new thought had struck him,\n'is it quite such folly, after all? It really strikes me, dear Maud, that\nthe subject may be worth a second thought. No, no, you won't refuse to hear\nme,' he said, observing me on the point of protesting. 'I am, of course,\nassuming that you are fancy free. I am assuming, too, that you don't care\ntwopence about Dudley, and even that you fancy you dislike him. You know in\nthat pleasant play, poor Sheridan--delightful fellow!--all our fine spirits\nare dead--he makes Mrs. Malaprop say there is nothing like beginning with a\nlittle aversion. Now, though in matrimony, of course, that is only a joke,\nyet in love, believe me, it is no such thing. His own marriage with Miss\nOgle, I _know_, was a case in point. She expressed a positive horror of him\nat their first acquaintance; and yet, I believe, she would, a few months\nlater, have died rather than not have married him.'\n\nI was again about to speak, but with a smile he beckoned me into silence.\n\n'There are two or three points you must bear in mind. One of the happiest\nprivileges of your fortune is that you may, without imprudence, marry\nsimply for love. There are few men in England who could offer you an estate\ncomparable with that you already possess; or, in fact, appreciably increase\nthe splendour of your fortune. If, therefore, he were in all other respects\neligible, I can't see that his poverty would be an objection to weigh for\none moment. He is quite a rough diamond. He has been, like many young men\nof the highest rank, too much given up to athletic sports--to that society\nwhich constitutes the aristocracy of the ring and the turf, and all that\nkind of thing. You see, I am putting all the worst points first. But I have\nknown so many young men in my day, after a madcap career of a few years\namong prizefighters, wrestlers, and jockeys--learning their slang and\naffecting their manners--take up and cultivate the graces and the\ndecencies. There was poor dear Newgate, many degrees lower in that kind of\nfrolic, who, when he grew tired of it, became one of the most elegant and\naccomplished men in the House of Peers. Poor Newgate, he's gone, too! I\ncould reckon up fifty of my early friends who all began like Dudley, and\nall turned out, more or less, like Newgate.'\n\nAt this moment came a knock at the door, and Dudley put in his head most\ninopportunely for the vision of his future graces and accomplishments.\n\n'My good fellow,' said his father, with a sharp sort of playfulness, 'I\nhappen to be talking about my son, and should rather not be overheard; you\nwill, therefore, choose another time for your visit.'\n\nDudley hesitated gruffly at the door, but another look from his father\ndismissed him.\n\n'And now, my dear, you are to remember that Dudley has fine qualities--the\nmost affectionate son in his rough way that ever father was blessed with;\nmost admirable qualities--indomitable courage, and a high sense of honour;\nand lastly, that he has the Ruthyn blood--the purest blood, I maintain it,\nin England.'\n\nMy uncle, as he said this, drew himself up a little, unconsciously, his\nthin hand laid lightly over his heart with a little patting motion, and his\ncountenance looked so strangely dignified and melancholy, that in admiring\ncontemplation of it I lost some sentences which followed next.\n\n'Therefore, dear, naturally anxious that my boy should not be dismissed\nfrom home--as he must be, should you persevere in rejecting his suit--I beg\nthat you will reserve your decision to this day fortnight, when I will with\nmuch pleasure hear what you may have to say on the subject. But till then,\nobserve me, not a word.'\n\nThat evening he and Dudley were closeted for a long time. I suspect that he\nlectured him on the psychology of ladies; for a bouquet was laid beside my\nplate every morning at breakfast, which it must have been troublesome to\nget, for the conservatory at Bartram was a desert. In a few days more an\nanonymous green parrot arrived, in a gilt cage, with a little note in a\nclerk's hand, addressed to 'Miss Ruthyn (of Knowl), Bartram-Haugh,' &c. It\ncontained only 'Directions for caring green parrot,' at the close of which,\n_underlined_, the words appeared--'The bird's name is Maud.'\n\nThe bouquets I invariably left on the table-cloth, where I found them--the\nbird I insisted on Milly's keeping as her property. During the intervening\nfortnight Dudley never appeared, as he used sometimes to do before, at\nluncheon, nor looked in at the window as we were at breakfast. He contented\nhimself with one day placing himself in my way in the hall in his shooting\naccoutrements, and, with a clumsy, shuffling kind of respect, and hat in\nhand, he said--\n\n'I think, Miss, I must a spoke uncivil t'other day. I was so awful put\nabout, and didn't know no more nor a child what I was saying; and I wanted\nto tell ye I'm sorry for it, and I beg your pardon--very humble, I do.'\n\nI did not know what to say. I therefore said nothing, but made a grave\ninclination, and passed on.\n\nTwo or three times Milly and I saw him at a little distance in our walks.\nHe never attempted to join us. Once only he passed so near that some\nrecognition was inevitable, and he stopped and in silence lifted his hat\nwith an awkward respect. But although he did not approach us, he was\nostentatious with a kind of telegraphic civility in the distance. He opened\ngates, he whistled his dogs to 'heel,' he drove away cattle, and then\nhimself withdrew. I really think he watched us occasionally to render these\nservices, for in this distant way we encountered him decidedly oftener than\nwe used to do before his flattering proposal of marriage.\n\nYou may be sure that we discussed, Milly and I, that occurrence pretty\nconstantly in all sorts of moods. Limited as had been her experience of\nhuman society, she very clearly saw _now_ how far below its presentable\nlevel was her hopeful brother.\n\nThe fortnight sped swiftly, as time always does when something we dislike\nand shrink from awaits us at its close. I never saw Uncle Silas during that\nperiod. It may seem odd to those who merely read the report of our last\ninterview, in which his manner had been more playful and his talk more\ntrifling than in any other, that from it I had carried away a profounder\nsense of fear and insecurity than from any other. It was with a foreboding\nof evil and an awful dejection that on a very dark day, in Milly's room,\nI awaited the summons which I was sure would reach me from my punctual\nguardian.\n\nAs I looked from the window upon the slanting rain and leaden sky, and\nthought of the hated interview that awaited me, I pressed my hand to my\ntroubled heart, and murmured, 'O that I had wings like a dove! then would I\nflee away, and be at rest.'\n\nJust then the prattle of the parrot struck my ear. I looked round on the\nwire cage, and remembered the words, 'The bird's name is Maud.'\n\n'Poor bird!' I said. 'I dare say, Milly, it longs to get out. If it were a\nnative of this country, would not you like to open the window, and then the\ndoor of that cruel cage, and let the poor thing fly away?'\n\n'Master wants Miss Maud,' said Wyat's disagreeable tones, at the half-open\ndoor.\n\nI followed in silence, with the pressure of a near alarm at my heart, like\na person going to an operation.\n\nWhen I entered the room, my heart beat so fast that I could hardly speak.\nThe tall form of Uncle Silas rose before me, and I made him a faltering\nreverence.\n\nHe darted from under his brows a wild, fierce glance at old Wyat, and\npointed to the door imperiously with his skeleton finger. The door shut,\nand we were alone.\n\n'A chair?' he said, pointing to a seat.\n\n'Thank you, uncle, I prefer standing,' I faltered.\n\nHe also stood--his white head bowed forward, the phosphoric glare of his\nstrange eyes shone upon me from under his brows--his finger-nails just\nrested on the table.\n\n'You saw the luggage corded and addressed, as it stands ready for removal\nin the hall?' he asked.\n\nI had. Milly and I had read the cards which dangled from the trunk-handles\nand gun-case. The address was--'Mr. Dudley R. Ruthyn, Paris, _vi\u00c3\u00a2_ Dover.'\n\n'I am old--agitated--on the eve of a decision on which much depends. Pray\nrelieve my suspense. Is my son to leave Bartram to-day in sorrow, or to\nremain in joy? Pray answer quickly.'\n\nI stammered I know not what. I was incoherent--wild, perhaps; but somehow\nI expressed my meaning--my unalterable decision. I thought his lips grew\nwhiter and his eyes shone brighter as I spoke.\n\nWhen I had quite made an end, he heaved a great sigh, and turning his eyes\nslowly to the right and the left, like a man in a helpless distraction, he\nwhispered--\n\n'God's will be done.'\n\nI thought he was upon the point of fainting--a clay tint darkened the white\nof his face; and, seeming to forget my presence, he sat down, looking with\na despairing scowl on his ashy old hand, as it lay upon the table.\n\nI stood gazing at him, feeling almost as if I had murdered the old man--he\nstill gazing askance, with an imbecile scowl, upon his hand.\n\n'Shall I go, sir?' I at length found courage to whisper.\n\n'_Go?_' he said, looking up suddenly; and it seemed to me as if a stream of\ncold sheet-lightning had crossed and enveloped me for a moment.\n\n'Go?--oh!--a--yes--_yes_, Maud--go. I must see poor Dudley before his\ndeparture,' he added, as it were, in soliloquy.\n\nTrembling lest he should revoke his permission to depart, I glided quickly\nand noiselessly from the room.\n\nOld Wyat was prowling outside, with a cloth in her hand, pretending to dust\nthe carved door-case. She frowned a stare of enquiry over her shrunken arm\non me, as I passed. Milly, who had been on the watch, ran and met me. We\nheard my uncle's voice, as I shut the door, calling Dudley. He had been\nwaiting, probably, in the adjoining room. I hurried into my chamber, with\nMilly at my side, and there my agitation found relief in tears, as that of\ngirlhood naturally does.\n\nA little while after we saw from the window Dudley, looking, I thought,\nvery pale, get into a vehicle, on the top of which his luggage lay, and\ndrive away from Bartram.\n\nI began to take comfort. His departure was an inexpressible relief. His\nfinal departure! a distant journey!\n\nWe had tea in Milly's room that night. Firelight and candles are inspiring.\nIn that red glow I always felt and feel more safe, as well as more\ncomfortable, than in the daylight--quite irrationally, for we know the\nnight is the appointed day of such as love the darkness better than light,\nand evil walks thereby. But so it is. Perhaps the very consciousness of\nexternal danger enhances the enjoyment of the well-lighted interior, just\nas the storm does that roars and hurtles over the roof.\n\nWhile Milly and I were talking, very cosily, a knock came to the room-door,\nand, without waiting for an invitation to enter, old Wyat came in, and\nglowering at us, with her brown claw upon the door-handle, she said to\nMilly--\n\n'Ye must leave your funnin', Miss Milly, and take your turn in your\nfather's room.'\n\n'Is he ill?' I asked.\n\nShe answered, addressing not me, but Milly--\n\n'A wrought two hours in a fit arter Master Dudley went. 'Twill be the death\no' him, I'm thinkin', poor old fellah. I wor sorry myself when I saw Master\nDudley a going off in the moist to-day, poor fellah. There's trouble enough\nin the family without a' that; but 'twon't be a family long, I'm thinkin'.\nNout but trouble, nout but trouble, since late changes came.'\n\nJudging by the sour glance she threw on me as she said this, I concluded\nthat I represented those 'late changes' to which all the sorrows of the\nhouse were referred.\n\nI felt unhappy under the ill-will even of this odious old woman, being one\nof those unhappily constructed mortals who cannot be indifferent when\nthey reasonably ought, and always yearn after kindness, even that of the\nworthless.\n\n'I must go. I wish you'd come wi' me, Maud, I'm so afraid all alone,' said\nMilly, imploringly.\n\n'Certainly, Milly,' I answered, not liking it, you may be sure; 'you shan't\nsit there alone.'\n\nSo together we went, old Wyat cautioning us for our lives to make no noise.\n\nWe passed through the old man's sitting-room, where that day had occurred\nhis brief but momentous interview with me, and his parting with his only\nson, and entered the bed-room at the farther end.\n\nA low fire burned in the grate. The room was in a sort of twilight. A\ndim lamp near the foot of the bed at the farther side was the only light\nburning there. Old Wyat whispered an injunction not to speak above our\nbreaths, nor to leave the fireside unless the sick man called or showed\nsigns of weariness. These were the directions of the doctor, who had been\nthere.\n\nSo Milly and I sat ourselves down near the hearth, and old Wyat left us to\nour resources. We could hear the patient breathe; but he was quite still.\nIn whispers we talked; but our conversation flagged. I was, after my wont,\nupbraiding myself for the suffering I had inflicted. After about half an\nhour's desultory whispering, and intervals, growing longer and longer, of\nsilence, it was plain that Milly was falling asleep.\n\nShe strove against it, and I tried hard to keep her talking; but it would\nnot do--sleep overcame her; and I was the only person in that ghastly room\nin a state of perfect consciousness.\n\nThere were associations connected with my last vigil there to make my\nsituation very nervous and disagreeable. Had I not had so much to occupy my\nmind of a distinctly practical kind--Dudley's audacious suit, my uncle's\nquestionable toleration of it, and my own conduct throughout that most\ndisagreeable period of my existence,--I should have felt my present\nsituation a great deal more.\n\nAs it was, I thought of my real troubles, and something of Cousin Knollys,\nand, I confess, a good deal of Lord Ilbury. When looking towards the door,\nI thought I saw a human face, about the most terrible my fancy could have\ncalled up, looking fixedly into the room. It was only a 'three-quarter,'\nand not the whole figure--the door hid that in a great measure, and I\nfancied I saw, too, a portion of the fingers. The face gazed toward the\nbed, and in the imperfect light looked like a livid mask, with chalky eyes.\n\nI had so often been startled by similar apparitions formed by accidental\nlights and shadows disguising homely objects, that I stooped forward,\nexpecting, though tremulously, to see this tremendous one in like manner\ndissolve itself into its harmless elements; and now, to my unspeakable\nterror, I became perfectly certain that I saw the countenance of Madame de\nla Rougierre.\n\nWith a cry, I started back, and shook Milly furiously from her trance.\n\n'Look! look!' I cried. But the apparition or illusion was gone.\n\nI clung so fast to Milly's arm, cowering behind her, that she could not\nrise.\n\n'Milly! Milly! Milly! Milly!' I went on crying, like one struck with\nidiotcy, and unable to say anything else.\n\nIn a panic, Milly, who had seen nothing, and could conjecture nothing of\nthe cause of my terror, jumped up, and clinging to one another, we huddled\ntogether into the corner of the room, I still crying wildly, 'Milly! Milly!\n_Milly_!' and nothing else.\n\n'What is it--where is it--what do you see?' cried Milly, clinging to me as\nI did to her.\n\n'It will come again; it will come; oh, heaven!'\n\n'What--what is it, Maud?'\n\n'The face! the face!' I cried. 'Oh, Milly! Milly! Milly!'\n\nWe heard a step softly approaching the open door, and, in a horrible _sauve\nqui peut_, we rushed and stumbled together toward the light by Uncle\nSilas's bed. But old Wyat's voice and figure reassured us.\n\n'Milly,' I said, so soon as, pale and very faint, I reached my apartment,\n'no power on earth shall ever tempt me to enter that room again after\ndark.'\n\n'Why, Maud dear, what, in Heaven's name, did you see?' said Milly, scarcely\nless terrified.\n\n'Oh, I can't; I can't; I can't, Milly. Never ask me. It is haunted. The\nroom is haunted _horribly_.'\n\n'Was it Charke?' whispered Milly, looking over her shoulder, all aghast.\n\n'No, no--don't ask me; a fiend in a worse shape.' I was relieved at last by\na long fit of weeping; and all night good Mary Quince sat by me, and Milly\nslept by my side. Starting and screaming, and drugged with sal-volatile, I\ngot through that night of supernatural terror, and saw the blessed light of\nheaven again.\n\nDoctor Jolks, when he came to see my uncle in the morning, visited me also.\nHe pronounced me very hysterical, made minute enquiries respecting my hours\nand diet, asked what I had had for dinner yesterday. There was something\na little comforting in his cool and confident pooh-poohing of the ghost\ntheory. The result was, a regimen which excluded tea, and imposed chocolate\nand porter, earlier hours, and I forget all beside; and he undertook to\npromise that, if I would but observe his directions, I should never see a\nghost again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\n_MILLY'S FAREWELL_\n\n\nA few days' time saw me much better. Doctor Jolks was so contemptuously\nsturdy and positive on the point, that I began to have comfortable doubts\nabout the reality of my ghost; and having still a horror indescribable\nof the illusion, if such it were, the room in which it appeared, and\neverything concerning it, I would neither speak, nor, so far as I could,\nthink of it.\n\nSo, though Bartram-Haugh was gloomy as well as beautiful, and some of its\nassociations awful, and the solitude that reigned there sometimes almost\nterrible, yet early hours, bracing exercise, and the fine air that\npredominates that region, soon restored my nerves to a healthier tone.\n\nBut it seemed to me that Bartram-Haugh was to be to me a vale of tears; or\nrather, in my sad pilgrimage, that valley of the shadow of death through\nwhich poor Christian fared alone and in the dark.\n\nOne day Milly ran into the parlour, pale, with wet cheeks, and, without\nsaying a word, threw her arms about my neck, and burst into a paroxysm of\nweeping.\n\n'What is it, Milly--what's the matter, dear--what is it?' I cried aghast,\nbut returning her close embrace heartily.\n\n'Oh! Maud--Maud darling, he's going to send me away.'\n\n'Away, dear! _where_ away? And leave me alone in this dreadful solitude,\nwhere he knows I shall die of fear and grief without you? Oh! no--no, it\n_must_ be a mistake.'\n\n'I'm going to France, Maud--I'm going away. Mrs. Jolks is going to London,\nday ar'ter to-morrow, and I'm to go wi' her; and an old French lady, he\nsays, from the school will meet me there, and bring me the rest o' the\nway.'\n\n'Oh--ho--ho--ho--ho--o--o--o!' cried poor Milly, hugging me closer still,\nwith her head buried in my shoulder, and swaying me about like a wrestler,\nin her agony.\n\n'I never wor away from home afore, except that little bit wi' you over\nthere at Elverston; and you wor wi' me then, Maud; an' I love ye--better\nthan Bartram--better than a'; an' I think I'll die, Maud, if they take me\naway.'\n\nI was just as wild in my woe as poor Milly; and it was not until we had\nwept together for a full hour--sometimes standing--sometimes walking up and\ndown the room--sometimes sitting and getting up in turns to fall on one\nanother's necks,--that Milly, plucking her handkerchief from her pocket,\ndrew a note from it at the same time, which, as it fell upon the floor, she\nat once recollected to be one from Uncle Silas to me.\n\nIt was to this effect:--\n\n'I wish to apprise my dear niece and ward of my plans. Milly proceeds to\nan admirable French school, as a pensionnaire, and leaves this on Thursday\nnext. If after three months' trial she finds it in any way objectionable,\nshe returns to us. If, on the contrary, she finds it in all respects the\ncharming residence it has been presented to me, you, on the expiration of\nthat period, join her there, until the temporary complication of my affairs\nshall have been so far adjusted as to enable me to receive you once more\nat Bartram. Hoping for happier days, and wishing to assure you that three\nmonths is the extreme limit of your separation from my poor Milly, I have\nwritten this, feeling alas! unequal to seeing you at present. 'Bartram,\nTuesday.\n\n'P.S.--I can have no objection to your apprising Monica Knollys of these\narrangements. You will understand, of course, not a copy of this letter,\nbut its substance.'\n\nOver this document, scanning it as lawyers do a new Act of Parliament, we\ntook comfort. After all, it was limited; a separation not to exceed three\nmonths, possibly much shorter. On the whole, too, I pleased myself with\nthinking Uncle Silas's note, though peremptory, was kind.\n\nOur paroxysms subsided into sadness; a close correspondence was arranged.\nSomething of the bustle and excitement of change supervened. If it turned\nout to be, in truth, a 'charming residence,' how very delightful our\nmeeting in France, with the interest of foreign scenery, ways, and faces,\nwould be!\n\nSo Thursday arrived--a new gush of sorrow--a new brightening up--and, amid\nregrets and anticipations, we parted at the gate at the farther end of the\nWindmill Wood. Then, of course, were more good-byes, more embraces, and\ntearful smiles. Good Mrs. Jolks, who met us there, was in a huge fuss; I\nbelieve it was her first visit to the metropolis, and she was in proportion\nheated and important, and terrified about the train, so we had not many\nlast words.\n\nI watched poor Milly, whose head was stretched from the window, her hand\nwaving many adieux, until the curve of the road, and the clump of old\nash-trees, thick with ivy, hid Milly, carriage and all, from view. My eyes\nfilled again with tears. I turned towards Bartram. At my side stood honest\nMary Quince.\n\n'Don't take on so, Miss; 'twon't be no time passing; three months is\nnothing at all,' she said, smiling kindly.\n\nI smiled through my tears and kissed the good creature, and so side by side\nwe re-entered the gate.\n\nThe lithe young man in fustian, whom I had seen talking with Beauty on the\nmorning of our first encounter with that youthful Amazon, was awaiting our\nre-entrance with the key in his hand. He stood half behind the open wicket.\nOne lean brown cheek, one shy eye, and his sharp up-turned nose, I saw as\nwe passed. He was treating me to a stealthy scrutiny, and seemed to shun my\nglance, for he shut the door quickly, and busied himself locking it, and\nthen began stubbing up some thistles which grew close by, with the toe of\nhis thick shoe, his back to us all the time.\n\nIt struck me that I recognised his features, and I asked Mary Quince.\n\n'Have you seen that young man before, Quince?'\n\n'He brings up game for your uncle, sometimes, Miss, and lends a hand in the\ngarden, I believe.'\n\n'Do you know his name, Mary?'\n\n'They call him Tom, I don't know what more, Miss.'\n\n'Tom,' I called; 'please, Tom, come here for a moment.'\n\nTom turned about, and approached slowly. He was more civil than the Bartram\npeople usually were, for he plucked off his shapeless cap of rabbit-skin\nwith a clownish respect.\n\n'Tom, what is your other name,--Tom _what_, my good man?' I asked.\n\n'Tom Brice, ma'am.'\n\n'Haven't I seen you before, Tom Brice?' I pursued, for my curiosity was\nexcited, and with it much graver feelings; for there certainly _was_ a\nresemblance in Tom's features to those of the postilion who had looked so\nhard at me as I passed the carriage in the warren at Knowl, on the evening\nof the outrage which had scared that quiet place.\n\n''Appen you may have, ma'am,' he answered, quite coolly, looking down the\nbuttons of his gaiters.\n\n'Are you a good whip--do you drive well?'\n\n'I'll drive a plough wi' most lads hereabout,' answered Tom.\n\n'Have you ever been to Knowl, Tom?'\n\nTom gaped very innocently.\n\n'Anan,' he said.\n\n'Here, Tom, is half-a-crown.'\n\nHe took it readily enough.\n\n'That be very good,' said Tom, with a nod, having glanced sharply at the\ncoin.\n\nI can't say whether he applied that term to the coin, or to his luck, or to\nmy generous self.\n\n'Now, Tom, you'll tell me, have you ever been to Knowl?'\n\n'Maught a' bin, ma'am, but I don't mind no sich place--no.'\n\nAs Tom spoke this with great deliberation, like a man who loves truth,\nputting a strain upon his memory for its sake, he spun the silver coin two\nor three times into the air and caught it, staring at it the while, with\nall his might.\n\n'Now, Tom, recollect yourself, and tell me the truth, and I'll be a friend\nto you. Did you ride postilion to a carriage having a lady in it, and, I\nthink, several gentlemen, which came to the grounds of Knowl, when the\nparty had their luncheon on the grass, and there was a--a quarrel with the\ngamekeepers? Try, Tom, to recollect; you shall, upon my honour, have no\ntrouble about it, and I'll try to serve you.'\n\nTom was silent, while with a vacant gape he watched the spin of his\nhalf-crown twice, and then catching it with a smack in his hand, which he\nthrust into his pocket, he said, still looking in the same direction--\n\n'I never rid postilion in my days, ma'am. I know nout o' sich a place,\nthough 'appen I maught a' bin there; Knowl, ye ca't. I was ne'er out o'\nDerbyshire but thrice to Warwick fair wi' horses be rail, an' twice to\nYork.'\n\n'You're certain, Tom?'\n\n'Sartin sure, ma'am.'\n\nAnd Tom made another loutish salute, and cut the conference short by\nturning off the path and beginning to hollo after some trespassing cattle.\n\nI had not felt anything like so nearly sure in this essay at identification\nas I had in that of Dudley. Even of Dudley's identity with the Church\nScarsdale man, I had daily grown less confident; and, indeed, had it been\nproposed to bring it to the test of a wager, I do not think I should,\nin the language of sporting gentlemen, have cared to 'back' my original\nopinion. There was, however, a sufficient uncertainty to make me\nuncomfortable; and there was another uncertainty to enhance the unpleasant\nsense of ambiguity.\n\nOn our way back we passed the bleaching trunks and limbs of several ranks\nof barkless oaks lying side by side, some squared by the hatchet, perhaps\nsold, for there were large letters and Roman numerals traced upon them in\nred chalk. I sighed as I passed them by, not because it was wrongfully\ndone, for I really rather leaned to the belief that Uncle Silas was well\nadvised in point of law. But, alas! here lay low the grand old family\ndecorations of Bartram-Haugh, not to be replaced for centuries to come,\nunder whose spreading boughs the Ruthyns of three hundred years ago had\nhawked and hunted!\n\nOn the trunk of one of these I sat down to rest, Mary Quince meanwhile\npattering about in unmeaning explorations. While thus listlessly seated,\nthe girl Meg Hawkes, walked by, carrying a basket.\n\n'Hish!' she said quickly, as she passed, without altering a pace or raising\nher eyes; 'don't ye speak nor look--fayther spies us; I'll tell ye next\nturn.'\n\n'Next turn'--when was that? Well, she might be returning; and as she could\nnot then say more than she had said, in merely passing without a pause, I\nconcluded to wait for a short time and see what would come of it.\n\nAfter a short time I looked about me a little, and I saw Dickon\nHawkes--Pegtop, as poor Milly used to call him--with an axe in his hand,\nprowling luridly among the timber.\n\nObserving that I saw him, he touched his hat sulkily, and by-and-by passed\nme, muttering to himself. He plainly could not understand what business I\ncould have in that particular part of the Windmill Wood, and let me see it\nin his countenance.\n\nHis daughter did pass me again; but this time he was near, and she was\nsilent. Her next transit occurred as he was questioning Mary Quince at some\nlittle distance; and as she passed precisely in the same way, she said--\n\n'Don't you be alone wi' Master Dudley nowhere for the world's worth.'\n\nThe injunction was so startling that I was on the point of questioning the\ngirl. But I recollected myself, and waited in the hope that in her future\ntransits she might be more explicit. But one word more she did not utter,\nand the jealous eye of old Pegtop was so constantly upon us that I\nrefrained.\n\nThere was vagueness and suggestion enough in the oracle to supply work for\nmany an hour of anxious conjecture, and many a horrible vigil by night. Was\nI never to know peace at Bartram-Haugh?\n\nTen days of poor Milly's absence, and of my solitude, had already passed,\nwhen my uncle sent for me to his room.\n\nWhen old Wyat stood at the door, mumbling and snarling her message, my\nheart died within me.\n\nIt was late--just that hour when dejected people feel their anxieties\nmost--when the cold grey of twilight has deepened to its darkest shade, and\nbefore the cheerful candles are lighted, and the safe quiet of the night\nsets in.\n\nWhen I entered my uncle's sitting-room--though his window-shutters were\nopen and the wan streaks of sunset visible through them, like narrow lakes\nin the chasms of the dark western clouds--a pair of candles were burning;\none stood upon the table by his desk, the other on the chimneypiece, before\nwhich his tall, thin figure stooped. His hand leaned on the mantelpiece,\nand the light from the candle just above his bowed head touched his silvery\nhair. He was looking, as it seemed, into the subsiding embers of the fire,\nand was a very statue of forsaken dejection and decay.\n\n'Uncle!' I ventured to say, having stood for some time unperceived near his\ntable.\n\n'Ah, yes, Maud, my dear child--my _dear_ child.'\n\nHe turned, and with the candle in his hand, smiling his silvery smile of\nsuffering on me. He walked more feebly and stiffly, I thought, than I had\never seen him move before.\n\n'Sit down, Maud--pray sit there.'\n\nI took the chair he indicated.\n\n'In my misery and my solitude, Maud, I have invoked you like a spirit, and\nyou appear.'\n\nWith his two hands leaning on the table, he looked across at me, in a\nstooping attitude; he had not seated himself. I continued silent until it\nshould be his pleasure to question or address me.\n\nAt last he said, raising himself and looking upward, with a wild\nadoration--his finger-tips elevated and glimmering in the faint mixed\nlight--\n\n'No, I thank my Creator, I am not quite forsaken.'\n\nAnother silence, during which he looked steadfastly at me, and muttered, as\nif thinking aloud--\n\n'My guardian angel!--my guardian angel! Maud, _you_ have a heart.' He\naddressed me suddenly--'Listen, for a few moments, to the appeal of an old\nand broken-hearted man--your guardian--your uncle--your _suppliant_. I had\nresolved never to speak to you more on this subject. But I was wrong. It\nwas pride that inspired me--mere pride.'\n\nI felt myself growing pale and flushed by turns during the pause that\nfollowed.\n\n'I'm very miserable--very nearly desperate. What remains for me--what\nremains? Fortune has done her worst--thrown in the dust, her wheels rolled\nover me; and the servile world, who follow her chariot like a mob, stamp\nupon the mangled wretch. All this had passed over me, and left me scarred\nand bloodless in this solitude. It was not my fault, Maud--I say it was no\nfault of mine; I have no remorse, though more regrets than I can count,\nand all scored with fire. As people passed by Bartram, and looked upon its\nneglected grounds and smokeless chimneys, they thought my plight, I dare\nsay, about the worst a proud man could be reduced to. They could not\nimagine one half its misery. But this old hectic--this old epileptic--this\nold spectre of wrongs, calamities, and follies, had still one hope--my\nmanly though untutored son--the last male scion of the Ruthyns. Maud, have\nI lost him? His fate--my fate--I may say _Milly's fate_;--we all await your\nsentence. He loves you, as none but the very young can love, and that once\nonly in a life. He loves you desperately--a most affectionate nature--a\nRuthyn, the best blood in England--the last man of the race; and I--if I\nlose him I lose all; and you will see me in my coffin, Maud, before many\nmonths. I stand before you in the attitude of a suppliant--shall I kneel?'\n\nHis eyes were fixed on me with the light of despair, his knotted hands\nclasped, his whole figure bowed toward me. I was inexpressibly shocked and\npained.\n\n'Oh, uncle! uncle!' I cried, and from very excitement I burst into tears.\n\nI saw that his eyes were fixed on me with a dismal scrutiny. I think he\ndivined the nature of my agitation; but he determined, notwithstanding, to\npress me while my helpless agitation continued.\n\n'You see my suspense--you see my miserable and frightful suspense. You are\nkind, Maud; you love your father's memory; your pity your father's brother;\nyou would not say no, and place a pistol at his head?'\n\n'Oh! I must--I must--I _must_ say no. Oh! spare me, uncle, for Heaven's\nsake. Don't question me--don't press me. I could not--I _could_ not do what\nyou ask.'\n\n'I yield, Maud--I yield, my dear. I will _not_ press you; you shall have\ntime, your _own_ time, to think. I will accept no answer now--no, _none_,\nMaud.'\n\nHe said this, raising his thin hand to silence me.\n\n'There, Maud, enough. I have spoken, as I always do to you, frankly,\nperhaps too frankly; but agony and despair will speak out, and plead, even\nwith the most obdurate and cruel.'\n\nWith these words Uncle Silas entered his bed-chamber, and shut the door,\nnot violently, but with a resolute hand, and I thought I heard a cry.\n\nI hastened to my own room. I threw myself on my knees, and thanked Heaven\nfor the firmness vouchsafed me; I could not believe it to have been my own.\n\nI was more miserable in consequence of this renewed suit on behalf of\nmy odious cousin than I can describe. My uncle had taken such a line of\nimportunity that it became a sort of agony to resist. I thought of the\npossibility of my hearing of his having made away with himself, and was\nevery morning relieved when I heard that he was still as usual. I have\noften wondered since at my own firmness. In that dreadful interview with my\nuncle I had felt, in the whirl and horror of my mind, on the very point\nof submitting, just as nervous people are said to throw themselves over\nprecipices through sheer dread of falling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\n_SARAH MATILDA COMES TO LIGHT_\n\n\nSome time after this interview, one day as I sat, sad enough, in my room,\nlooking listlessly from the window, with good Mary Quince, whom, whether\nin the house or in my melancholy rambles, I always had by my side, I\nwas startled by the sound of a loud and shrill female voice, in violent\nhysterical action, gabbling with great rapidity, sobbing, and very nearly\nscreaming in a sort of fury.\n\nI started up, staring at the door.\n\n'Lord bless us!' cried honest Mary Quince, with round eyes and mouth agape,\nstaring in the same direction.\n\n'Mary--Mary, what can it be?'\n\n'Are they beating some one down yonder? I don't know where it comes from,'\ngasped Quince.\n\n'I will--I will--I'll see her. It's her I want.\nOo--hoo--hoo--hoo--oo--o--Miss Maud Ruthyn of Knowl. Miss Ruthyn of Knowl.\nHoo--hoo--hoo--hoo--oo!'\n\n'What on earth can it be?' I exclaimed, in great bewilderment and terror.\n\nIt was now plainly very near indeed, and I heard the voice of our mild and\nshaky butler evidently remonstrating with the distressed damsel.\n\n'I'll see her,' she continued, pouring a torrent of vile abuse upon me,\nwhich stung me with a sudden sense of anger. What had I done to be afraid\nof anyone? How dared anyone in my uncle's house--in _my_ house--mix my name\nup with her detestable scurrilities?\n\n'For Heaven's sake, Miss, don't ye go out,' cried poor Quince; 'it's some\ndrunken creature.'\n\nBut I was very angry, and, like a fool as I was, I threw open the door,\nexclaiming in a loud and haughty key--\n\n'Here is Miss Ruthyn of Knowl. Who wants to see her?'\n\nA pink and white young lady, with black tresses, violent, weeping, shrill,\nvoluble, was flouncing up the last stair, and shook her dress out on the\nlobby; and poor old Giblets, as Milly used to call him, was following in\nher wake, with many small remonstrances and entreaties, perfectly unheeded.\n\nThe moment I looked at this person, it struck me that she was the identical\nlady whom I had seen in the carriage at Knowl Warren. The next moment I was\nin doubt; the next, still more so. She was decidedly thinner, and dressed\nby no means in such lady-like taste. Perhaps she was hardly like her at\nall. I began to distrust all these resemblances, and to fancy, with a\nshudder, that they originated, perhaps, only in my own sick brain.\n\nOn seeing me, this young lady--as it seemed to me, a good deal of the\nbarmaid or lady's-maid species--dried her eyes fiercely, and, with a\nflaming countenance, called upon me peremptorily to produce her 'lawful\nhusband.' Her loud, insolent, outrageous attack had the effect of enhancing\nmy indignation, and I quite forget what I said to her, but I well remember\nthat her manner became a good deal more decent. She was plainly under the\nimpression that I wanted to appropriate her husband, or, at least, that he\nwanted to marry me; and she ran on at such a pace, and her harangue was so\npassionate, incoherent, and unintelligible, that I thought her out of her\nmind: she was far from it, however. I think if she had allowed me even\na second for reflection, I should have hit upon her meaning. As it was,\nnothing could exceed my perplexity, until, plucking a soiled newspaper from\nher pocket, she indicated a particular paragraph, already sufficiently\nemphasised by double lines of red ink at its sides. It was a Lancashire\npaper, of about six weeks since, and very much worn and soiled for its age.\nI remember in particular a circular stain from the bottom of a vessel,\neither of coffee or brown stout. The paragraph was as follows, recording an\nevent a year or more anterior to the date of the paper:--\n\n'MARRIAGE.--On Tuesday, August 7, 18--, at Leatherwig Church, by the Rev.\nArthur Hughes, Dudley R. Ruthyn, Esq., only son and heir of Silas Ruthyn,\nEsq., of Bartram-Haugh, Derbyshire, to Sarah Matilda, second daughter of\nJohn Mangles, Esq., of Wiggan, in this county.'\n\nAt first I read nothing but amazement in this announcement, but in another\nmoment I felt how completely I was relieved; and showing, I believe, my\nintense satisfaction in my countenance--for the young lady eyed me with\nconsiderable surprise and curiosity--I said--\n\n'This is extremely important. You must see Mr. Silas Ruthyn this moment. I\nam certain he knows nothing of it. I will conduct you to him.'\n\n'No more he does--I know that myself,' she replied, following me with a\nself-asserting swagger, and a great rustling of cheap silk.\n\nAs we entered, Uncle Silas looked up from his sofa, and closed his _Revue\ndes Deux Mondes_.\n\n'What is all this?' he enquired, drily.\n\n'This lady has brought with her a newspaper containing an extraordinary\nstatement which affects our family,' I answered.\n\nUncle Silas raised himself, and looked with a hard, narrow scrutiny at the\nunknown young lady.\n\n'A libel, I suppose, in the paper?' he said, extending his hand for it.\n\n'No, uncle--no; only a marriage,' I answered.\n\n'Not Monica?' he said, as he took it. 'Pah, it smells all over of tobacco\nand beer,' he added, throwing a little eau de Cologne over it.\n\nHe raised it with a mixture of curiosity and disgust, saying again 'pah,'\nas he did so.\n\nHe read the paragraph, and as he did his face changed from white, all over,\nto lead colour. He raised his eyes, and looked steadily for some seconds at\nthe young lady, who seemed a little awed by his strange presence.\n\n'And you are, I suppose, the young lady, Sarah Matilda _n\u00c3\u00a9e_ Mangles,\nmentioned in this little paragraph?' he said, in a tone you would have\ncalled a sneer, were it not that it trembled.\n\nSarah Matilda assented.\n\n'My son is, I dare say, within reach. It so happens that I wrote to arrest\nhis journey, and summon him here, some days since--some days since--some\ndays since,' he repeated slowly, like a person whose mind has wandered far\naway from the theme on which he is speaking.\n\nHe had rung his bell, and old Wyat, always hovering about his rooms,\nentered.\n\n'I want my son, immediately. If not in the house, send Harry to the\nstables; if not there, let him be followed, instantly. Brice is an active\nfellow, and will know where to find him. If he is in Feltram, or at a\ndistance, let Brice take a horse, and Master Dudley can ride it back. He\nmust be here without the loss of one moment.'\n\nThere intervened nearly a quarter of an hour, during which whenever he\nrecollected her, Uncle Silas treated the young lady with a hyper-refined\nand ceremonious politeness, which appeared to make her uneasy, and even a\nlittle shy, and certainly prevented a renewal of those lamentations and\ninvectives which he had heard faintly from the stair-head.\n\nBut for the most part Uncle Silas seemed to forget us and his book, and all\nthat surrounded him, lying back in the corner of his sofa, his chin upon\nhis breast, and such a fearful shade and carving on his features as made me\nprefer looking in any direction but his.\n\nAt length we heard the tread of Dudley's thick boots on the oak boards,\nand faint and muffled the sound of his voice as he cross-examined old Wyat\nbefore entering the chamber of audience.\n\nI think he suspected quite another visitor, and had no expectation of\nseeing the particular young lady, who rose from her chair as he entered, in\nan opportune flood of tears, crying--\n\n'Oh, Dudley, Dudley!--oh, Dudley, could you? Oh, Dudley, your own poor Sal!\nYou could not--you would not--your lawful wife!'\n\nThis and a good deal more, with cheeks that streamed like a window-pane in\na thunder-shower, spoke Sarah Matilda with all her oratory, working his\narm, which she clung to, up and down all the time, like the handle of a\npump. But Dudley was, manifestly, confounded and dumbfoundered. He stood\nfor a long time gaping at his father, and stole just one sheepish glance\nat me; and, with red face and forehead, looked down at his boots, and then\nagain at his father, who remained just in the attitude I have described,\nand with the same forbidding and dreary intensity in his strange face.\n\nLike a quarrelsome man worried in his sleep by a noise, Dudley suddenly\nwoke up, as it were, with a start, in a half-suppressed exasperation,\nand shook her off with a jerk and a muttered curse, as she whisked\ninvoluntarily into a chair, with more violence than could have been\npleasant.\n\n'Judging by your looks and demeanour, sir, I can almost anticipate your\nanswers,' said my uncle, addressing him suddenly. 'Will you be good\nenough--pray, madame (parenthetically to our visitor), command yourself for\na few moments. Is this young person the daughter of a Mr. Mangles, and is\nher name Sarah Matilda?'\n\n'I dessay,' answered Dudley, hurriedly.\n\n'Is she your wife?'\n\n'Is she my wife?' repeated Dudley, ill at ease.\n\n'Yes, sir; it is a plain question.'\n\nAll this time Sarah Matilda was perpetually breaking into talk, and with\ndifficulty silenced by my uncle.\n\n'Well, 'appen she says I am--does she?' replied Dudley.\n\n'Is she your wife, sir?'\n\n'Mayhap she so considers it, after a fashion,' he replied, with an impudent\nswagger, seating himself as he did so.\n\n'What do _you_ think, sir?' persisted Uncle Silas.\n\n'I don't think nout about it,' replied Dudley, surlily.\n\n'Is that account true?' said my uncle, handing him the paper.\n\n'They wishes us to believe so, at any rate.'\n\n'Answer directly, sir. We have our thoughts upon it. If it be true, it is\ncapable of _every_ proof. For expedition's sake I ask you. There is no use\nin prevaricating.'\n\n'Who wants to deny it? It _is_ true--there!'\n\n'_There!_ I knew he would,' screamed the young woman, hysterically, with a\nlaugh of strange joy.\n\n'Shut up, will ye?' growled Dudley, savagely.\n\n'Oh, Dudley, Dudley, darling! what have I done?'\n\n'Bin and ruined me, jest--that's all.'\n\n'Oh! no, no, no, Dudley. Ye know I wouldn't. I could not--_could_ not hurt\nye, Dudley. No, no, no!'\n\nHe grinned at her, and, with a sharp side-nod, said--\n\n'Wait a bit.'\n\n'Oh, Dudley, don't be vexed, dear. I did not mean it. I would not hurt ye\nfor all the world. Never.'\n\n'Well, never mind. You and yours tricked me finely; and now you've got\nme--that's all.'\n\nMy uncle laughed a very odd laugh.\n\n'I knew it, of course; and upon my word, madame, you and he make a very\npretty couple,' sneered Uncle Silas.\n\nDudley made no answer, looking, however, very savage.\n\nAnd with this poor young wife, so recently wedded, the low villain had\nactually solicited me to marry him!\n\nI am quite certain that my uncle was as entirely ignorant as I of Dudley's\nconnection, and had, therefore, no participation in this appalling\nwickedness.\n\n'And I have to congratulate you, my good fellow, on having secured the\naffections of a very suitable and vulgar young woman.'\n\n'I baint the first o' the family as a' done the same,' retorted Dudley.\n\nAt this taunt the old man's fury for a moment overpowered him. In an\ninstant he was on his feet, quivering from head to foot. I never saw such\na countenance--like one of those demon-grotesques we see in the Gothic\nside-aisles and groinings--a dreadful grimace, monkey-like and insane--and\nhis thin hand caught up his ebony stick, and shook it paralytically in the\nair.\n\n'If ye touch me wi' that, I'll smash ye, by ----!' shouted Dudley, furious,\nraising his hands and hitching his shoulder, just as I had seen him when he\nfought Captain Oakley.\n\nFor a moment this picture was suspended before me, and I screamed, I know\nnot what, in my terror. But the old man, the veteran of many a scene of\nexcitement, where men disguise their ferocity in calm tones, and varnish\ntheir fury with smiles, had not quite lost his self-command. He turned\ntoward me and said--\n\n'Does he know what he's saying?'\n\nAnd with an icy laugh of contempt, his high, thin forehead still flushed,\nhe sat down trembling.\n\n'If you want to say aught, I'll hear ye. Ye may jaw me all ye like, and\nI'll stan' it.'\n\n'Oh, I may speak? Thank you,' sneered Uncle Silas, glancing slowly round at\nme, and breaking into a cold laugh.\n\n'Ay, I don't mind cheek, not I; but you must not go for to do that, ye\nknow. Gammon. I won't stand a blow--I won't fro _no_ one.\n\n'Well, sir, availing myself of your permission to speak, I may remark,\nwithout offence to the young lady, that I don't happen to recollect the\nname Mangles among the old families of England. I presume you have chosen\nher chiefly for her virtues and her graces.'\n\nMrs. Sarah Matilda, not apprehending this compliment quite as Uncle Silas\nmeant it, dropped a courtesy, notwithstanding her agitation, and, wiping\nher eyes, said, with a blubbered smile--\n\n'You're very kind, sure.'\n\n'I hope, for both your sakes, she has got a little money. I don't see how\nyou are to live else. You're too lazy for a game-keeper; and I don't\nthink you could keep a pot-house, you are so addicted to drinking and\nquarrelling. The only thing I am quite clear upon is, that you and your\nwife must find some other abode than this. You shall depart this evening:\nand now, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley Ruthyn, you may quit this room, if you\nplease.'\n\nUncle Silas had risen, and made them one of his old courtly bows, smiling a\ndeath-like sneer, and pointing to the door with his trembling fingers.\n\n'Come, will ye?' said Dudley, grinding his teeth. 'You're pretty well done\nhere.'\n\nNot half understanding the situation, but looking woefully bewildered, she\ndropped a farewell courtesy at the door.\n\n'Will ye _cut_?' barked Dudley, in a tone that made her jump; and suddenly,\nwithout looking about, he strode after her from the room.\n\n'Maud, how shall I recover this? The vulgar _villain_--the _fool_! What an\nabyss were we approaching! and for me the last hope gone--and for me utter,\nutter, irretrievable ruin.'\n\nHe was passing his fingers tremulously back and forward along the top of\nthe mantelpiece, like a man in search of something, and continued so,\nlooking along it, feebly and vacantly, although there was nothing there.\n\n'I wish, uncle--you do not know how much I wish--I could be of any use to\nyou. Maybe I can?'\n\nHe turned, and looked at me sharply.\n\n'Maybe you can,' he echoed slowly. 'Yes, maybe you can,' he repeated more\nbriskly.' Let us--let us see--let us think--that d---- fellow!--my head!'\n\n'You're not well, uncle?'\n\n'Oh! yes, very well. We'll talk in the evening--I'll send for you.'\n\nI found Wyat in the next room, and told her to hasten, as I thought he was\nill. I hope it was not very selfish, but such had grown to be my horror of\nseeing him in one of his strange seizures, that I hastened from the room\nprecipitately--partly to escape the risk of being asked to remain.\n\nThe walls of Bartram House are thick, and the recess at the doorway deep.\nAs I closed my uncle's door, I heard Dudley's voice on the stairs. I did\nnot wish to be seen by him or by his 'lady', as his poor wife called\nherself, who was engaged in vehement dialogue with him as I emerged, and\nnot caring either to re-enter my uncle's room, I remained quietly ensconced\nwithin the heavy door-case, in which position I overheard Dudley say with a\nsavage snarl--\n\n'You'll jest go back the way ye came. I'm not goin' wi' ye, if that's what\nye be drivin' at--dang your impitins!'\n\n'Oh! Dudley, dear, what have I done--what _have_ I done--ye hate me so?'\n\n'What a' ye done? Ye vicious little beast, ye! You've got us turned out an'\ndisinherited wi' yer d----d bosh, that's all; don't ye think it's enough?'\n\nI could only hear her sobs and shrill tones in reply, for they were\ndescending the stairs; and Mary Quince reported to me, in a horrified sort\nof way, that she saw him bundle her into the fly at the door, like a truss\nof hay into a hay-loft. And he stood with his head in at the window,\nscolding her, till it drove away.\n\n'I knew he wor jawing her, poor thing! By the way he kep' waggin' his\nhead--an' he had his fist inside, a shakin' in her face I'm sure he looked\nwicked enough for anything; an' she a crying like a babby, an' lookin'\nback, an' wavin' her wet hankicher to him--poor thing!--and she so young!\n'Tis a pity. Dear me! I often think, Miss, 'tis well for me I never was\nmarried. And see how we all would like to get husbands for all that, though\nso few is happy together. 'Tis a queer world, and them that's single is\nmaybe the best off after all.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\n_THE PICTURE OF A WOLF_\n\n\nI went down that evening to the sitting-room which had been assigned to\nMilly and me, in search of a book--my good Mary Quince always attending me.\nThe door was a little open, and I was startled by the light of a candle\nproceeding from the fireside, together with a considerable aroma of tobacco\nand brandy.\n\nOn my little work-table, which he had drawn beside the hearth, lay Dudley's\npipe, his brandy-flask, and an empty tumbler; and he was sitting with one\nfoot on the fender, his elbow on his knee, and his head resting in his\nhand, weeping. His back being a little toward the door, he did not perceive\nus; and we saw him rub his knuckles in his eyes, and heard the sounds of\nhis selfish lamentation.\n\nMary and I stole away quietly, leaving him in possession, wondering when\nhe was to leave the house, according to the sentence which I had heard\npronounced upon him.\n\nI was delighted to see old 'Giblets' quietly strapping his luggage in the\nhall, and heard from him in a whisper that he was to leave that evening by\nrail--he did not know whither.\n\nAbout half an hour afterwards, Mary Quince, going out to reconnoitre, heard\nfrom old Wyat in the lobby that he had just started to meet the train.\n\nBlessed be heaven for that deliverance! An evil spirit had been cast out,\nand the house looked lighter and happier. It was not until I sat down in\nthe quiet of my room that the scenes and images of that agitating day began\nto move before my memory in orderly procession, and for the first time\nI appreciated, with a stunning sense of horror and a perfect rapture of\nthanksgiving, the value of my escape and the immensity of the danger which\nhad threatened me. It may have been miserable weakness--I think it was. But\nI was young, nervous, and afflicted with a troublesome sort of conscience,\nwhich occasionally went mad, and insisted, in small things as well as\ngreat, upon sacrifices which my reason now assures me were absurd. Of\nDudley I had a perfect horror; and yet had that system of solicitation,\nthat dreadful and direct appeal to my compassion, that placing of my feeble\ngirlhood in the seat of the arbiter of my aged uncle's hope or despair,\nbeen long persisted in, my resistance might have been worn out--who can\ntell?--and I self-sacrificed! Just as criminals in Germany are teased, and\nwatched, and cross-examined, year after year, incessantly, into a sort of\nmadness; and worn out with the suspense, the iteration, the self-restraint,\nand insupportable fatigue, they at last cut all short, accuse themselves,\nand go infinitely relieved to the scaffold--you may guess, then, for me,\nnervous, self-diffident, and alone, how intense was the comfort of knowing\nthat Dudley was actually married, and the harrowing importunity which had\njust commenced for ever silenced.\n\nThat night I saw my uncle. I pitied him, though I feared him. I was longing\nto tell him how anxious I was to help him, if only he could point out the\nway. It was in substance what I had already said, but now strongly urged.\nHe brightened; he sat up perpendicularly in his chair with a countenance,\nnot weak or fatuous now, but resolute and searching, and which contracted\ninto dark thought or calculation as I talked.\n\nI dare say I spoke confusedly enough. I was always nervous in his presence;\nthere was, I fancy, something mesmeric in the odd sort of influence which,\nwithout effort, he exercised over my imagination.\n\nSometimes this grew into a dismal panic, and Uncle Silas--polished,\nmild--seemed unaccountably horrible to me. Then it was no longer an\naccidental fascination of electro-biology. It was something more. His\nnature was incomprehensible by me. He was without the nobleness, without\nthe freshness, without the softness, without the frivolities of such human\nnature as I had experienced, either within myself or in other persons. I\ninstinctively felt that appeals to sympathies or feelings could no\nmore affect him than a marble monument. He seemed to accommodate his\nconversation to the moral structure of others, just as spirits are said to\nassume the shape of mortals. There were the sensualities of the gourmet for\nhis body, and there ended his human nature, as it seemed to me. Through\nthat semi-transparent structure I thought I could now and then discern the\nlight or the glare of his inner life. But I understood it not.\n\nHe never scoffed at what was good or noble--his hardest critic could not\nnail him to one such sentence; and yet, it seemed somehow to me that his\nunknown nature was a systematic blasphemy against it all. If fiend he was,\nhe was yet something higher than the garrulous, and withal feeble, demon of\nGoethe. He assumed the limbs and features of our mortal nature. He shrouded\nhis own, and was a profoundly reticent Mephistopheles. Gentle he had been\nto me--kindly he had nearly always spoken; but it seemed like the mild talk\nof one of those goblins of the desert, whom Asiatic superstition tells of,\nwho appear in friendly shapes to stragglers from the caravan, beckon to\nthem from afar, call them by their names, and lead them where they are\nfound no more. Was, then, all his kindness but a phosphoric radiance\ncovering something colder and more awful than the grave?\n\n'It is very noble of you, Maud--it is angelic; your sympathy with a ruined\nand despairing old man. But I fear you will recoil. I tell you frankly that\nless than twenty thousand pounds will not extricate me from the quag of\nruin in which I am entangled--lost!'\n\n'Recoil! Far from it. I'll do it. There must be some way.'\n\n'Enough, my fair young protectress--celestial enthusiast, enough. Though\nyou do not, yet I recoil. I could not bring myself to accept this\nsacrifice. What signifies, even to me, my extrication? I lie a mangled\nwretch, with fifty mortal wounds on my crown; what avails the healing of\none wound, when there are so many beyond all cure? Better to let me perish\nwhere I fall; and reserve your money for the worthier objects whom,\nperhaps, hereafter may avail to save.'\n\n'But I _will_ do this. I must. I cannot see you suffer with the power in my\nhands unemployed to help you,' I exclaimed.\n\n'Enough, dear Maud; the will is here--enough: there is balm in your\ncompassion and good-will. Leave me, ministering angel; for the present I\ncannot. If you _will_, we can talk of it again. Good-night.'\n\nAnd so we parted.\n\nThe attorney from Feltram, I afterwards heard, was with him nearly all that\nnight, trying in vain to devise by their joint ingenuity any means by which\nI might tie myself up. But there were none. I could not bind myself.\n\nI was myself full of the hope of helping him. What was this sum to me,\ngreat as it seemed? Truly nothing. I could have spared it, and never felt\nthe loss.\n\nI took up a large quarto with coloured prints, one of the few books I had\nbrought with me from dear old Knowl. Too much excited to hope for sleep in\nbed, I opened it, and turned over the leaves, my mind still full of Uncle\nSilas and the sum I hoped to help him with.\n\nUnaccountably one of those coloured engravings arrested my attention.\nIt represented the solemn solitude of a lofty forest; a girl, in Swiss\ncostume, was flying in terror, and as she fled flinging a piece of meat\nbehind her which she had taken from a little market-basket hanging upon her\narm. Through the glade a pack of wolves were pursuing her.\n\nThe narrative told, that on her return homeward with her marketing, she had\nbeen chased by wolves, and barely escaped by flying at her utmost speed,\nfrom time to time retarding, as she did so, the pursuit, by throwing, piece\nby piece, the contents of her basket, in her wake, to be devoured and\nfought for by the famished beasts of prey.\n\nThis print had seized my imagination. I looked with a curious interest on\nthe print: something in the disposition of the trees, their great height,\nand rude boughs, interlacing, and the awful shadow beneath, reminded me of\na portion of the Windmill Wood where Milly and I had often rambled. Then I\nlooked at the figure of the poor girl, flying for her life, and glancing\nterrified over her shoulder. Then I gazed on the gaping, murderous pack,\nand the hoary brute that led the van; and then I leaned back in my chair,\nand I thought--perhaps some latent association suggested what seemed a\nthing so unlikely--of a fine print in my portfolio from Vandyke's noble\npicture of Belisarius. Idly I traced with my pencil, as I leaned back, on\nan envelope that lay upon the table, this little inscription. It was mere\nfiddling; and, absurd as it looked, there was nothing but an honest meaning\nin it:--'20,000_l_. Date Obolum Belisario!' My dear father had translated\nthe little Latin inscription for me, and I had written it down as a sort\nof exercise of memory; and also, perhaps, as expressive of that sort of\ncompassion which my uncle's fall and miserable fate excited invariably in\nme. So I threw this queer little memorandum upon the open leaf of the book,\nand again the flight, the pursuit, and the bait to stay it, engaged my eye.\nAnd I heard a voice near the hearthstone, as I thought, say, in a stern\nwhisper, 'Fly the fangs of Belisarius!'\n\n'What's that?' said I, turning sharply to Mary Quince.\n\nMary rose from her work at the fireside, staring at me with that odd sort\nof frown that accompanies fear and curiosity.\n\n'You spoke? Did you speak?' I said, catching her by the arm, very much\nfrightened myself.\n\n'No, Miss; no, dear!' answered she, plainly thinking that I was a little\nwrong in my head.\n\nThere could be no doubt it was a trick of the imagination, and yet to this\nhour I could recognise that clear stern voice among a thousand, were it to\nspeak again.\n\nJaded after a night of broken sleep and much agitation, I was summoned next\nmorning to my uncle's room.\n\nHe received me _oddly_, I thought. His manner had changed, and made an\nuncomfortable impression upon me. He was gentle, kind, smiling, submissive,\nas usual; but it seemed to me that he experienced henceforth toward me the\nsame half-superstitous repulsion which I had always felt from him. Dream,\nor voice, or vision--which had done it? There seemed to be an unconscious\nantipathy and fear. When he thought I was not looking, his eyes were\nsometimes grimly fixed for a moment upon me. When I looked at him, his eyes\nwere upon the book before him; and when he spoke, a person not heeding what\nhe uttered would have fancied that he was reading aloud from it.\n\nThere was nothing tangible but this shrinking from the encounter of our\neyes. I said he was kind as usual. He was even more so. But there was this\nnew sign of our silently repellant natures. Dislike it could not be. He\nknew I longed to serve him. Was it shame? Was there not a shade of horror\nin it?\n\n'I have not slept,' said he. 'For me the night has passed in thought, and\nthe fruit of it is this--I _cannot_, Maud, accept your noble offer.'\n\n'I am _very_ sorry,' exclaimed I, in all honesty.\n\n'I know it, my dear niece, and appreciate your goodness; but there are\nmany reasons--none of them, I trust, ignoble--and which together render\nit impossible. No. It would be misunderstood--my honour shall not be\nimpugned.'\n\n'But, sir, that could not be; you have never proposed it. It would be all,\nfrom first to last, _my_ doing.'\n\n'True, dear Maud, but I know, alas! more of this evil and slanderous world\nthan your happy inexperience can do. Who will receive our testimony?\nNone--no, not one. The difficulty--the insuperable moral difficulty is\nthis--that I should expose myself to the plausible imputation of having\nworked upon you, unduly, for this end; and more, that I could not hold\nmyself quite free from blame. It is your voluntary goodness, Maud. But you\nare young, inexperienced; and it is, I hold it, my duty to stand between\nyou and any dealing with your property at so unripe an age. Some people may\ncall this Quixotic. In my mind it is an imperious mandate of conscience;\nand I peremptorily refuse to disobey it, although within three weeks an\nexecution will be in this house!'\n\nI did not quite know what an execution meant; but from two harrowing\nnovels, with whose distresses I was familiar, I knew that it indicated some\ndireful process of legal torture and spoliation.\n\n'Oh, uncle I--oh, sir!--you cannot allow this to happen. What will people\nsay of me? And--and there is poor Milly--and _everything_! Think what it\nwill be.'\n\n'It cannot be helped--_you_ cannot help it, Maud. Listen to me. There will\nbe an execution here, I cannot say exactly how soon, but, I think, in a\nlittle more than a fortnight. I must provide for your comfort. You must\nleave. I have arranged that you shall join Milly, for the present, in\nFrance, till I have time to look about me. You had better, I think, write\nto your cousin, Lady Knollys. She, with all her oddities, has a heart. Can\nyou say, Maud, that I have been kind?'\n\n'You have never been anything but kind,' I exclaimed.\n\n'That I've been self-denying when you made me a generous offer?' he\ncontinued. 'That I now act to spare you pain? You may tell her, not as a\nmessage from me, but as a fact, that I am seriously thinking of vacating my\nguardianship--that I feel I have done her an injustice, and that, so\nsoon as my mind is a little less tortured, I shall endeavour to effect a\nreconciliation with her, and would wish ultimately to transfer the care\nof your person and education to _her_. You may say I have no longer an\ninterest even in vindicating my name. My son has wrecked himself by a\nmarriage. I forgot to tell you he stopped at Feltram, and this morning\nwrote to pray a parting interview. If I grant it, it shall be the last. I\nshall never see him or correspond with him more.'\n\nThe old man seemed much overcome, and held his hankerchief to his eyes.\n\n'He and his wife are, I understand, about to emigrate; the sooner the\nbetter,' he resumed, bitterly. 'Deeply, Maud, I regret having tolerated his\nsuit to you, even for a moment. Had I thought it over, as I did the whole\ncase last night, nothing could have induced me to permit it. But I have\nlived for so long like a monk in his cell, my wants and observation limited\nto the narrow compass of this chamber, that my knowledge of the world has\ndied out with my youth and my hopes: and I did not, as I ought to have\ndone, consider many objections. Therefore, dear Maud, on this one subject,\nI entreat, be silent; its discussion can effect nothing now. I was wrong,\nand frankly ask you to forget my mistake.'\n\nI had been on the point of writing to Lady Knollys on this odious subject,\nwhen, happily, it was set at rest by the disclosure of yesterday; and being\nso, I could have no difficulty in acceding to my uncle's request. He was\nconceding so much that I could not withhold so trifling a concession in\nreturn.\n\n'I hope Monica will continue to be kind to poor Milly after I am gone.'\n\nHere there were a few seconds of meditation.\n\n'Maud, you will not, I think, refuse to convey the substance of what I\nhave just said in a letter to Lady Knollys, and perhaps you would have\nno objection to let me see it when it is written. It will prevent the\npossibility of its containing any misconception of what I have just spoken:\nand, Maud, you won't forget to say whether I have been kind. It would be\na satisfaction to me to know that Monica was assured that I never either\nteased or bullied my young ward.'\n\nWith these words he dismissed me; and forthwith I completed such a letter\nas would quite embody what he had said; and in my own glowing terms,\nbeing in high good-humour with Uncle Silas, recorded my estimate of his\ngentleness and good-nature; and when I submitted it to him, he expressed\nhis admiration of what he was pleased to call my cleverness in so exactly\nconveying what he wished, and his gratitude for the handsome terms in which\nI had spoken of my old guardian.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\n_AN ODD PROPOSAL_\n\n\nAs I and Mary Quince returned from our walk that day, and had entered the\nhall, I was surprised most disagreeably by Dudley's emerging from the\nvestibule at the foot of the great staircase. He was, I suppose, in his\ntravelling costume--a rather soiled white surtout, a great coloured muffler\nin folds about his throat, his 'chimney-pot' on, and his fur cap sticking\nout from his pocket. He had just descended, I suppose, from my uncle's\nroom. On seeing me he stepped back, and stood with his shoulders to the\nwall, like a mummy in a museum.\n\nI pretended to have a few words to say to Mary before leaving the hall,\nin the hope that, as he seemed to wish to escape me, he would take the\nopportunity of getting quickly off the scene.\n\nBut he had changed his mind, it would seem, in the interval; for when I\nglanced in that direction again he had moved toward us, and stood in the\nhall with his hat in his hand. I must do him the justice to say he looked\nhorribly dismal, sulky, and frightened.\n\n'Ye'll gi'e me a word, Miss--only a thing I ought to say--for your good; by\n----, mind, it's for _your_ good, Miss.'\n\nDudley stood a little way off, viewing me, with his hat in both hands and a\n'glooming' countenance.\n\nI detested the idea of either hearing or speaking to him; but I had no\nresolution to refuse, and only saying 'I can't imagine what you can wish to\nspeak to me about,' I approached him. 'Wait there at the banister, Quince.'\n\nThere was a fragrance of alcohol about the flushed face and gaudy muffler\nof this odious cousin, which heightened the effect of his horribly dismal\nfeatures. He was speaking, besides, a little thickly; but his manner was\ndejected, and he was treating me with an elaborate and discomfited respect\nwhich reassured me.\n\n'I'm a bit up a tree, Miss,' he said shuffling his feet on the oak floor.\n'I behaved a d---- fool; but I baint one o' they sort. I'm a fellah as 'ill\nfight his man, an' stan' up to 'm fair, don't ye see? An' _baint_ one o'\nthey sort--no, _dang_ it, I baint.'\n\nDudley delivered his puzzling harangue with a good deal of undertoned\nvehemence, and was strangely agitated. He, too, had got an unpleasant way\nof avoiding my eye, and glancing along the floor from corner to corner as\nhe spoke, which gave him a very hang-dog air.\n\nHe was twisting his fingers in his great sandy whisker, and pulling it\nroughly enough to drag his cheek about by that savage purchase; and with\nhis other hand he was crushing and rubbing his hat against his knee.\n\n'The old boy above there be half crazed, I think; he don't mean half as he\nsays thof, not he. But I'm in a bad fix anyhow--a regular sell it's been,\nand I can't get a tizzy out of him. So, ye see, I'm up a tree, Miss; and he\nsich a one, he'll make it a wuss mull if I let him. He's as sharp wi' me as\none o' them lawyer chaps, dang 'em, and he's a lot of I O's and rubbitch o'\nmine; and Bryerly writes to me he can't gi'e me my legacy, 'cause he's got\na notice from Archer and Sleigh a warnin' him not to gi'e me as much as a\nbob; for I signed it away to governor, he says--which I believe's a lie. I\nmay a' signed some writing--'appen I did--when I was a bit cut one night.\nBut that's no way to catch a gentleman, and 'twon't stand. There's justice\nto be had, and 'twon't _stand_, I say; and I'm not in 'is hands that way.\nThof I may be a bit up the spout, too, I don't deny; only I baint agoin'\nthe whole hog all at once. I'm none o' they sort. He'll find I baint.'\n\nHere Mary Quince coughed demurely from the foot of the stair, to remind me\nthat the conversation was protracted.\n\n'I don't very well understand,' I said gravely; 'and I am now going\nupstairs.'\n\n'Don't jest a minute, Miss; it's only a word, ye see. We'll be goin' t'\nAustralia, Sary Mangles, an' me, aboard the _Seamew_, on the 5th. I'm\nfor Liverpool to-night, and she'll meet me there, an'--an', please God\nAlmighty, ye'll never see me more; an I'd rather gi'e ye a lift, Maud,\nbefore I go: an' I tell ye what, if ye'll just gi'e me your written promise\nye'll gi'e me that twenty thousand ye were offering to gi'e the Governor,\nI'll take ye cleverly out o' Bartram, and put ye wi' your cousin Knollys,\nor anywhere ye like best.'\n\n'Take me from Bartram--for twenty thousand pounds! Take me away from my\nguardian! You seem to forget, sir,' my indignation rising as I spoke, 'that\nI can visit my cousin, Lady Knollys, whenever I please.'\n\n'Well, that is as it may be,' he said, with a sulky deliberation, scraping\nabout a little bit of paper that lay on the floor with the toe of his boot.\n\n'It _is_ as it may be, and that is as I say, sir; and considering how you\nhave treated me--your mean, treacherous, and infamous suit, and your cruel\ntreason to your poor wife, I am amazed at your effrontery.'\n\nI turned to leave him, being, in truth, in one of my passions.\n\n'Don't ye be a flying' out,' he said peremptorily, and catching me roughly\nby the wrist,' I baint a-going to vex ye. What a mouth you be, as can't see\nyour way! Can't ye speak wi' common sense, like a woman--dang it--for once,\nand not keep brawling like a brat--can't ye see what I'm saying? I'll take\nye out o' all this, and put ye wi' your cousin, or wheresoever you list, if\nye'll gi'e me what I say.'\n\nHe was, for the first time, looking me in the face, but with contracted\neyes, and a countenance very much agitated.\n\n'Money?' said I, with a prompt disdain.\n\n'Ay, money--twenty thousand pounds--_there_. On or off?' he replied, with\nan unpleasant sort of effort.\n\n'You ask my promise for twenty thousand pounds, and you shan't have it.'\n\nMy cheeks were flaming, and I stamped on the ground as I spoke.\n\nIf he had known how to appeal to my better feelings, I am sure I should\nhave done, perhaps not quite that, all at once at least, but something\nhandsome, to assist him. But this application was so shabby and insolent!\nWhat could he take me for? That I should suppose his placing me with Cousin\nMonica constituted her my guardian? Why, he must fancy me the merest baby.\nThere was a kind of stupid cunning in this that disgusted my good-nature\nand outraged my self-importance.\n\n'You won't gi'e me that, then?' he said, looking down again, with a frown,\nand working his mouth and cheeks about as I could fancy a man rolling a\npiece of tobacco in his jaw.\n\n'Certainly _not_, sir,' I replied.\n\n'_Take_ it, then,' he replied, still looking down, very black and\ndiscontented.\n\nI joined Mary Quince, extremely angry. As I passed under the carved oak\narch of the vestibule, I saw his figure in the deepening twilight. The\npicture remains in its murky halo fixed in memory. Standing where he last\nspoke in the centre of the hall, not looking after me, but downward, and,\nas well as I could see, with the countenance of a man who has lost a game,\nand a ruinous wager too--that is black and desperate. I did not utter a\nsyllable on the way up. When I reached my room, I began to reconsider the\ninterview more at my leisure. I was, such were my ruminations, to have\nagreed at once to his preposterous offer, and to have been driven, while he\nsmirked and grimaced behind my back at his acquaintances, through Feltram\nin his dog-cart to Elverston; and then, to the just indignation of my\nuncle, to have been delivered up to Lady Knolly's guardianship, and to\nhave handed my driver, as I alighted, the handsome fare of 20.000_l_. It\nrequired the impudence of Tony Lumpkin, without either his fun or his\nshrewdness, to have conceived such a prodigious practical joke.\n\n'Maybe you'd like a little tea, Miss?' insinuated Mary Quince.\n\n'What impertinence!' I exclaimed, with one of my angry stamps on the floor.\n'Not you, dear old Quince,' I added. 'No--no tea just now.'\n\nAnd I resumed my ruminations, which soon led me to this train of\nthought--'Stupid and insulting as Dudley's proposition was, it yet involved\na great treason against my uncle. Should I be weak enough to be silent, may\nhe not, wishing to forestall me, misrepresent all that has passed, so as to\nthrow the blame altogether upon me?'\n\nThis idea seized upon me with a force which I could not withstand; and on\nthe impulse of the moment I obtained admission to my uncle, and related\nexactly what had passed. When I had finished my narrative, which he\nlistened to without once raising his eyes, my uncle cleared his throat once\nor twice, as if to speak. He was smiling--I thought with an effort, and\nwith elevated brows. When I concluded, he hummed one of those sliding\nnotes, which a less refined man might have expressed by a whistle of\nsurprise and contempt, and again he essayed to speak, but continued silent.\nThe fact is, he seemed to me very much disconcerted. He rose from his seat,\nand shuffled about the room in his slippers, I believe affecting only to\nbe in search of something, opening and shutting two or three drawers, and\nturning over some books and papers; and at length, taking up some loose\nsheets of manuscript, he appeared to have found what he was looking for,\nand began to read them carelessly, with his back towards me, and with\nanother effort to clear his voice, he said at last--\n\n'And pray, what could the fool mean by all that?'\n\n'I think he must have taken me for an idiot, sir,' I answered.\n\n'Not unlikely. He has lived in a stable, among horses and ostlers; he has\nalways seemed to me something like a centaur--that is a centaur composed\nnot of man and horse, but of an ape and an ass.'\n\nAnd upon this jibe he laughed, not coldly and sarcastically, as was his\nwont, but, I thought, flurriedly. And, continuing to look into his papers,\nhe said, his back still toward me as he read--\n\n'And he did not favour you with an exposition of his meaning, which, except\nin so far as it estimated his deserts at the modest sum you have\nnamed, appears to me too oracular to be interpreted without a kindred\ninspiration?'\n\nAnd again he laughed. He was growing more like himself.\n\n'As to your visiting your cousin, Lady Knollys, the stupid rogue had only\nfive minutes before heard me express my wish that you should do so before\nleaving this. I am quite resolved you shall--that is, unless, dear Maud,\nyou should yourself object; but, of course, we must wait for an invitation,\nwhich, I conjecture, will not be long in coming. In fact, your letter\nwill naturally bring it about, and, I trust, open the way to a permanent\nresidence with her. The more I think it over, the more am I convinced, dear\nniece, that as things are likely to turn out, my roof would be no desirable\nshelter for you; and that, under all circumstances, hers would. Such were\nmy motives, Maud, in opening, through your letter, a door of reconciliation\nbetween us.'\n\nI felt that I ought to have kissed his hand--that he had indicated\nprecisely the future that I most desired; and yet there was within me a\nvague feeling, akin to suspicion--akin to dismay which chilled and overcast\nmy soul.\n\n'But, Maud,' he said, 'I am disquieted to think of that stupid jackanapes\npresuming to make you such an offer! A creditable situation truly--arriving\nin the dark at Elverston, under the solitary escort of that wild young man,\nwith whom you would have fled from my guardianship; and, Maud, I tremble as\nI ask myself the question, would he have conducted you to Elverston at all?\nWhen you have lived as long in the world as I, you will appreciate its\nwickedness more justly.' Here there was a little pause.\n\n'I know, my dear, that were he convinced of his legal marriage with that\nyoung woman,' he resumed, perceiving how startled I looked, 'such an idea,\nof course, would not have entered his head; but he does not believe any\nsuch thing. Contrary to fact and logic, he does honestly think that his\nhand is still at his disposal; and I certainly do suspect that he would\nhave employed that excursion in endeavouring to persuade you to think as he\ndoes. Be that how it may, however, it is satisfactory to me to know that\nyou shall never more be troubled by one word from that ill-regulated young\nman. I made him my adieux, such as they were, this evening; and never more\nshall he enter the walls of Bartram-Haugh while we two live.'\n\nUncle Silas replaced the papers which had ostensibly interested him so\nmuch, and returned. There was a vein which was visible near the angle\nof his lofty temple, and in moments of agitation stood out against the\nsurrounding pallor in a knotted blue cord; and as he came back smiling\naskance, I saw this sign of inward tumult.\n\n'We can, however, afford to despise the follies and knaveries of the world,\nMaud, as long as we act, as we have hitherto done, with perfect confidence\nin each other. Heaven bless you, dear Maud! Your report troubled me, I\nbelieve, more than it need--troubled me a good deal; but reflection assures\nme it is nothing. He is gone. In a few days' time he will be on the sea. I\nwill issue my orders to-morrow morning, and he will never more, during his\nbrief stay in England, gain admission to Bartram-Haugh. Good-night, my good\nniece; I thank you.'\n\nAnd so I returned to Mary Quince, on the whole happier than I had left\nher, but still with the confused and jarring vision I could not interpret\nperpetually rising before me; and as, from time to time, shapeless\nanxieties agitated me, relieving them by appeals to Him who alone is wise\nand strong.\n\nNext day brought me a goodnatured gossiping letter from dear Milly,\nwritten in compulsory French, which was, in some places, very difficult\nto interpret. She gave me a very pleasant account of the place, and her\nopinion of the girls who were inmates, and mentioned some of the nuns with\nhigh commendation. The language plainly cramped poor Milly's genius; but\nalthough there was by no means so much fun as an honest English letter\nwould have brought me, there could be no mistake about her liking the\nplace, and she expressed her honest longing to see me in the most\naffectionate terms.\n\nThis letter came enclosed in one to my uncle, from the proper authority\nin the convent; and as there was neither address within, nor post-mark\nwithout, I was as much in the dark as ever as to poor Milly's whereabouts.\n\nPencilled across the envelope of this letter, in my uncle's hand, were the\nwords, 'Let me have your answer when sealed, and I will transmit it.--S.R.'\n\nWhen, accordingly, some days later, I did place my letter to Milly in my\nuncle's hands, he told me the reason of his reserves on the subject.\n\n'I thought it best, dear Maud, not to plague you with a secret, and Milly's\npresent address is one. It will in a few weeks become the rallying-point of\nour diverse routes, when you shall meet her, and I join you both. Nobody,\nuntil the storm shall have blown over, must know where I am to be found,\nexcept my lawyer; and I think you would prefer ignorance to the trouble of\nkeeping a secret on which so much may depend.'\n\nThis being reasonable, and even considerate, I acquiesced.\n\nIn that interval there reached me such a charming, gay, and affectionate\nletter--a very _long_ letter, too--though the writer was scarcely seven\nmiles away, from dear Cousin Monica, full of pleasant gossip, and\nrose-coloured and golden castles in the air, and the kindest interest in\npoor Milly, and the warmest affection for me.\n\nOne other incident varied that interval, if possible more pleasantly than\nthose. It was the announcement, in a Liverpool paper, of the departure of\nthe _Seamew_, bound for Melbourne; and among the passengers were reported\n'Dudley Ruthyn, Esquire, of Bartram-H., and Mrs. D. Ruthyn.'\n\nAnd now I began to breathe freely, I plainly saw the end of my probation\napproaching: a short excursion to France, a happy meeting with Milly, and\nthen a delightful residence with Cousin Monica for the remainder of my\nnonage.\n\nYou will say then that my spirits and my serenity were quite restored. Not\nquite. How marvellously lie our anxieties, in filmy layers, one over the\nother! Take away that which has lain on the upper surface for so long--the\ncare of cares--the only one, as it seemed to you, between your soul and the\nradiance of Heaven--and straight you find a new stratum there. As physical\nscience tells us no fluid is without its skin, so does it seem with this\nfine medium of the soul, and these successive films of care that form upon\nits surface on mere contact with the upper air and light.\n\nWhat was my new trouble? A very fantastic one, you will say--the illusion\nof a self-tormentor. It was the face of Uncle Silas which haunted me.\nNotwithstanding the old pale smile, there was a shrinking grimness, and the\nalways-averted look.\n\nSometimes I fancied his mind was disordered. I could not account for the\neerie lights and shadows that flickered on his face, except so. There was\na look of shame and fear of me, amazing as that seems, in the sheen of his\npeaked smile.\n\nI thought, 'Perhaps he blames himself for having tolerated Dudley's\nsuit--for having urged it on grounds of personal distress--for having\naltogether lowered, though under sore temptation, both himself and his\noffice; and he thinks that he has forfeited my respect.'\n\nSuch was my analysis; but in the _coup-d'oeil_ of that white face that\ndazzled me in darkness, and haunted my daily reveries with a faded light,\nthere was an intangible character of the insidious and the terrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\n_IN SEARCH OF MR. CHARKE'S SKELETON_\n\n\nOn the whole, however, I was unspeakably relieved. Dudley Ruthyn, Esq.,\nand Mrs. D. Ruthyn, were now skimming the blue waves on the wings of the\n_Seamew_, and every morning widened the distance between us, which was to\ngo on increasing until it measured a point on the antipodes. The Liverpool\npaper containing this golden line was carefully preserved in my room; and\nlike the gentleman who, when much tried by the shrewish heiress whom he\nhad married, used to retire to his closet and read over his marriage\nsettlement, I used, when blue devils haunted me, to unfold my newspaper and\nread the paragraph concerning the _Seamew_.\n\nThe day I now speak of was a dismal one of sleety snow. My own room seemed\nto me cheerier than the lonely parlour, where I could not have had good\nMary Quince so decorously.\n\nA good fire, that kind and trusty face, the peep I had just indulged in at\nmy favourite paragraph, and the certainty of soon seeing my dear cousin\nMonica, and afterwards affectionate Milly, raised my spirits.\n\n'So,' said I, 'as old Wyat, you say, is laid up with rheumatism, and can't\nturn up to scold me, I think I'll run up stairs and make an exploration,\nand find poor Mr. Charke's skeleton in a closet.'\n\n'Oh, law, Miss Maud, how can you say such things!' exclaimed good old\nQuince, lifting up her honest grey head and round eyes from her knitting.\n\nI had grown so familiar with the frightful tradition of Mr. Charke and his\nsuicide, that I could now afford to frighten old Quince with him.\n\n'I am quite serious. I am going to have a ramble up-stairs and down-stairs,\nlike goosey-goosey-gander; and if I do light upon his chamber, it is all\nthe more interesting. I feel so like Adelaide, in the \"Romance of the\nForest,\" the book I was reading to you last night, when she commenced her\ndelightful rambles through the interminable ruined abbey in the forest.'\n\n'Shall I go with you, Miss?'\n\n'No, Quince; stay there; keep a good fire, and make some tea. I suspect I\nshall lose heart and return very soon;' and with a shawl about me, cowl\nfashion, over my head, I stole up-stairs.\n\nI shall not recount with the particularity of the conscientious heroine of\nMrs. Ann Radcliffe, all the suites of apartments, corridors, and lobbies,\nwhich I threaded in my ramble. It will be enough to mention that I lighted\nupon a door at the end of a long gallery, which, I think, ran parallel with\nthe front of the house; it interested me because it had the air of having\nbeen very long undisturbed. There were two rusty bolts, which did not\nevidently belong to its original securities, and had been, though very long\nago, somewhat clumsily superadded. Dusty and rusty they were, but I had no\ndifficulty in drawing them back. There was a rusty key, I remember it well,\nwith a crooked handle in the lock; I tried to turn it, but could not.\nMy curiosity was piqued. I was thinking of going back and getting Mary\nQuince's assistance. It struck me, however, that possibly it was not\nlocked, so I pulled the door and it opened quite easily. I did not find\nmyself in a strangely-furnished suite of apartments, but at the entrance\nof a gallery, which diverged at right angles from that through which I had\njust passed; it was very imperfectly lighted, and ended in total darkness.\n\nI began to think how far I had already come, and to consider whether I\ncould retrace my steps with accuracy in case of a panic, and I had serious\nthoughts of returning.\n\nThe idea of Mr. Charke was growing unpleasantly sharp and menacing; and\nas I looked down the long space before me, losing itself among ambiguous\nshadows, lulled in a sinister silence, and as it were inviting my entrance\nlike a trap, I was very near yielding to the cowardly impulse.\n\nBut I took heart of grace and determined to see a little more. I opened a\nside-door, and entered a large room, where were, in a corner, some rusty\nand cobwebbed bird-cages, but nothing more. It was a wainscoted room, but\na white mildew stained the panels. I looked from the window: it commanded\nthat dismal, weed-choked quadrangle into which I had once looked from\nanother window. I opened a door at its farther end, and entered another\nchamber, not quite so large, but equally dismal, with the same prison-like\nlook-out, not very easily discerned through the grimy panes and the sleet\nthat was falling thickly outside. The door through which I had entered made\na little accidental creak, and, with my heart at my lips, I gazed at it,\nexpecting to see Charke, or the skeleton of which I had talked so lightly,\nstalk in at the half-open aperture. But I had an odd sort of courage which\nwas always fighting against my cowardly nerves, and I walked to the door,\nand looking up and down the dismal passage, was reassured.\n\nWell, one room more--just that whose deep-set door fronted me, with a\nmelancholy frown, at the opposite end of the chamber. So to it I glided,\nshoved it open, advancing one step, and the great bony figure of Madame de\nla Rougierre was before me.\n\nI could see nothing else.\n\nThe drowsy traveller who opens his sheets to slip into bed, and sees a\nscorpion coiled between them, may have experienced a shock the same in\nkind, but immeasurably less in degree.\n\nShe sat in a clumsy old arm-chair, with an ancient shawl about her, and\nher bare feet in a delft tub. She looked a thought more withered. Her wig\nshoved back disclosed her bald wrinkled forehead, and enhanced the ugly\neffect of her exaggerated features and the gaunt hollows of her face. With\na sense of incredulity and terror I gazed, freezing, at this evil phantom,\nwho returned my stare for a few seconds with a shrinking scowl, dismal and\ngrim, as of an evil spirit detected.\n\nThe meeting, at least then and there, was as complete a surprise for her as\nfor me. She could not tell how I might take it; but she quickly rallied,\nburst into a loud screeching laugh, and, with her old Walpurgis gaiety,\ndanced some fantastic steps in her bare wet feet, tracking the floor with\nwater, and holding out with finger and thumb, in dainty caricature, her\nslammakin old skirt, while she sang some of her nasal patois with an\nabominable hilarity and emphasis.\n\nWith a gasp, I too recovered from the fascination of the surprise. I could\nnot speak though for some seconds, and Madame was first.\n\n'Ah, dear Maud, what surprise! Are we not overjoy, dearest, and cannot\nspeak? I am full of joy--quite charmed--_ravie_--of seeing you. So are you\nof me, your face betray. Ah! yes, thou dear little baboon! here is poor\nMadame once more! Who could have imagine?'\n\n'I thought you were in France, Madame,' I said, with a dismal effort.\n\n'And so I was, dear Maud; I 'av just arrive. Your uncle Silas he wrote to\nthe superioress for gouvernante to accompany a young lady--that is you,\nMaud--on her journey, and she send me; and so, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re, here is poor\nMadame arrive to charge herself of that affair.'\n\n'How soon do we leave for France, Madame?' I asked.\n\n'I do not know, but the old women--wat is her name?'\n\n'Wyat,' I suggested.\n\n'Oh! oui, Waiatt;--she says two, three week. And who conduct you to poor\nMadame's apartment, my dear Maud?' She inquired insinuatingly.\n\n'No one, I answered promptly: 'I reached it quite accidentally, and I\ncan't imagine why you should conceal yourself.' Something like indignation\nkindled in my mind as I began to wonder at the sly strategy which had been\npractised upon me.\n\n'I 'av not conceal myself, Mademoiselle,' retorted the governness. 'I 'av\nact precisally as I 'av been ordered. Your uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn, he is\nafraid, Waiatt says, to be interrupted by his creditors, and everything\nmust be done very quaitly. I have been commanded to avoid _me faire voir_,\nyou know, and I must obey my employer--voil\u00c3\u00a0 tout!'\n\n'And for how long have you been residing here?' I persisted, in the same\nresentful vein.\n\n''Bout a week. It is soche triste place! I am so glad to see you, Maud!\nI've been so isol\u00c3\u00a9e, you dear leetle fool!'\n\n'You are _not_ glad, Madame; you don't love me--you never did,' I exclaimed\nwith sudden vehemence.\n\n'Yes, I am _very_ glad; you know not, ch\u00c3\u00a8re petite _niaise_, how I 'av\ndesire to educate you a leetle more. Let us understand one another. You\nthink I do not love you, Mademoiselle, because you have mentioned to your\npoor papa that little _d\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8glement_ in his library. I have repent very\noften that so great indiscretion of my life. I thought to find some letters\nof Dr. Braierly. I think that man was trying to get your property, my dear\nMaud, and if I had found something I would tell you all about. But it was\nvery great _sottise_, and you were very right to denounce me to Monsieur.\nJe n'ai point de rancune contre vous. No, no, none at all. On the contrary,\nI shall be your _gardienne tutelaire_--wat you call?--guardian angel--ah,\nyes, that is it. You think I speak _par d\u00c3\u00a9rision_; not at all. No, my dear\ncheaile, I do not speak _par moquerie_, unless perhaps the very least\ndegree in the world.'\n\nAnd with these words Madame laughed unpleasantly, showing the black caverns\nat the side of her mouth, and with a cold, steady malignity in her gaze.\n\n'Yes,' I said; 'I know what you mean, Madame--you _hate_ me.'\n\n'Oh! wat great ogly word! I am shock! _vous me faites honte_. Poor Madame,\nshe never hate any one; she loves all her friends, and her enemies she\nleaves to Heaven; while I am, as you see, more gay, more _joyeuse_ than\never, they have not been 'appy--no, they have not been fortunate these\nothers. Wen I return, I find always some of my enemy they 'av die, and some\nthey have put themselves into embarrassment, or there has arrived to them\nsome misfortune;' and Madame shrugged and laughed a little scornfully.\n\nA kind of horror chilled my rising anger, and I was silent.\n\n'You see, my dear Maud, it is very natural you should think I hate you.\nWhen I was with Mr. Austin Ruthyn, at Knowl, you know you did not like a\nme--never. But in consequence of our intimacy I confide you that which I\n'av of most dear in the world, my reputation. It is always so. The pupil\ncan _calomniate_, without been discover, the gouvernante. 'Av I not been\nalways kind to you, Maud? Which 'av I use of violence or of sweetness the\nmost? I am, like other persons, _jalouse de ma r\u00c3\u00a9putation_; and it was\ndifficult to suffer with patience the banishment which was invoked by you,\nbecause chiefly for your good, and for an indiscretion to which I was\nexcited by motives the most pure and laudable. It was you who spied so\ncleverly--eh! and denounce me to Monsieur Ruthyn? Helas! wat bad world it\nis!'\n\n'I do not mean to speak at all about that occurrence, Madame; I will not\ndiscuss it. I dare say what you tell me of the cause of your engagement\nhere is true, and I suppose we must travel, as you say, in company; but\nyou must know that the less we see of each other while in this house the\nbetter.'\n\n'I am not so sure of that, my sweet little _b\u00c3\u00a9te_; your education has been\nneglected, or rather entirely abandoned, since you 'av arrive at this\nplace, I am told. You must not be a _bestiole_. We must do, you and I, as\nwe are ordered. Mr. Silas Ruthyn he will tell us.'\n\nAll this time Madame was pulling on her stockings, getting her boots on,\nand otherwise proceeding with her dowdy toilet. I do not know why I stood\nthere talking to her. We often act very differently from what we would\nhave done upon reflection. I had involved myself in a dialogue, as wiser\ngenerals than I have entangled themselves in a general action when they\nmeant only an affair of outposts. I had grown a little angry, and would\nnot betray the least symptom of fear, although I felt that sensation\nprofoundly.\n\n'My beloved father thought you so unfit a companion for me that he\ndismissed you at an hour's notice, and I am very sure that my uncle will\nthink as he did; you are _not_ a fit companion for me, and had my\nuncle known what had passed he would never have admitted you to this\nhouse--never!'\n\n'Helas! _Quelle disgrace_! And you really think so, my dear Maud,'\nexclaimed Madame, adjusting her wig before her glass, in the corner of\nwhich I could see half of her sly, grinning face, as she ogled herself in\nit.\n\n'I do, and so do you, Madame,' I replied, growing more frightened.\n\n'It may be--we shall see; but everyone is not so cruel as you, _ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re\npetite calomniatrice_.'\n\n'You shan't call me those names,' I said, in an angry tremor.\n\n'What name, dearest cheaile?'\n\n'_Calomniatrice_--that is an insult.'\n\n'Why, my most foolish little Maud, we may say rogue, and a thousand other\nlittle words in play which we do not say seriously.\n\n'You are not playing--you never play--you are angry, and you hate me,' I\nexclaimed, vehemently.\n\n'Oh, fie!--wat shame! Do you not perceive, dearest cheaile, how much\neducation you still need? You are proud, little demoiselle; you must\nbecome, on the contrary, quaite humble. Je ferai baiser le babouin \u00c3\u00a0\nvous--ha, ha, ha! I weel make a you to kees the monkey. You are too proud,\nmy dear cheaile.'\n\n'I am not such a fool as I was at Knowl,' I said; 'you shall not terrify me\nhere. I will tell my uncle the whole truth,' I said.\n\n'Well, it may be that is the best,' she replied, with provoking coolness.\n\n'You think I don't mean it?'\n\n'Of course you _do_,' she replied.\n\n'And we shall see what my uncle thinks of it.'\n\n'We shall see, my dear,' she replied, with an air of mock contrition.\n\n'Adieu, Madame!'\n\n'You are going to Monsieur Ruthyn?--very good!'\n\nI made her no answer, but more agitated than I cared to show her, I left\nthe room. I hurried along the twilight passage, and turned into the long\ngallery that opened from it at right angles. I had not gone half-a-dozen\nsteps on my return when I heard a heavy tread and a rustling behind me.\n\n'I am ready, my dear; I weel accompany you,' said the smirking phantom,\nhurrying after me.\n\n'Very well,' was my reply; and threading our way, with a few hesitations\nand mistakes, we reached and descended the stairs, and in a minute more\nstood at my uncle's door.\n\nMy uncle looked hard and strangely at us as we entered. He looked, indeed,\nas if his temper was violently excited, and glared and muttered to himself\nfor a few seconds; and treating Madame to a stare of disgust, he asked\npeevishly--\n\n'Why am I disturbed, pray?'\n\n'Miss Maud a Ruthyn, she weel explain,' replied Madame, with a great\ncourtesy, like a boat going down in a ground swell.\n\n'_Will_ you explain, my dear?' he asked, in his coldest and most sarcastic\ntone.\n\nI was agitated, and I am sure my statement was confused. I succeeded,\nhowever, in saying what I wanted.\n\n'Why, Madame, this is a grave charge! Do you admit it, pray?'\n\nMadame, with the coolest possible effrontery, denied it all; with the most\nsolemn asseverations, and with streaming eyes and clasped hands, conjured\nme melodramatically to withdraw that intolerable story, and to do her\njustice. I stared at her for a while astounded, and turning suddenly to my\nuncle, as vehemently asserted the truth of every syllable I had related.\n\n'You hear, my dear child, you hear her deny everything; what am I to think?\nYou must excuse the bewilderment of my old head. Madame de la--that lady\nhas arrived excellently recommended by the superioress of the place where\ndear Milly awaits you, and such persons are particular. It strikes me, my\ndear niece, that you must have made a mistake.'\n\nI protested here. But he went on without seeming to hear the parenthesis--\n\n'I know, my dear Maud, that you are quite incapable of wilfully deceiving\nanyone; but you are liable to be deceived like other young people. You\nwere, no doubt, very nervous, and but half awake when you fancied you saw\nthe occurrence you describe; and Madame de--de--'\n\n'De la Rougierre,' I supplied.\n\n'Yes, thank you--Madame de la Rougierre, who has arrived with excellent\ntestimonials, strenuously denies the whole thing. Here is a conflict, my\ndear--in my mind a presumption of mistake. I confess I should prefer that\ntheory to a peremptory assumption of guilt.'\n\nI felt incredulous and amazed; it seemed as if a dream were being enacted\nbefore me. A transaction of the most serious import, which I had witnessed\nwith my own eyes, and described with unexceptionable minuteness and\nconsistency, is discredited by that strange and suspicious old man with\nan imbecile coolness. It was quite in vain my reiterating my statement,\nbacking it with the most earnest asseverations. I was beating the air. It\ndid not seem to reach his mind. It was all received with a simper of feeble\nincredulity.\n\nHe patted and smoothed my head--he laughed gently, and shook his while\nI insisted; and Madame protested her purity in now tranquil floods\nof innocent tears, and murmured mild and melancholy prayers for my\nenlightenment and reformation. I felt as if I should lose my reason.\n\n'There now, dear Maud, we have heard enough; it is, I do believe, a\ndelusion. Madame de la Rougierre will be your companion, at the utmost, for\nthree or four weeks. Do exercise a little of your self-command and\ngood sense--you know how I am tortured. Do not, I entreat, add to my\nperplexities. You may make yourself very happy with Madame if you will, I\nhave no doubt.'\n\n'I propose to Mademoiselle,' said Madame, drying her eyes with a gentle\nalacrity, 'to profit of my visit for her education. But she does not seem\nto weesh wat I think is so useful.'\n\n'She threatened me with some horrid French vulgarism--_de faire baiser le\nbabouin \u00c3\u00a0 moi_, whatever that means; and I know she hates me,' I replied,\nimpetuously.\n\n'Doucement--doucement!' said my uncle, with a smile at once amused and\ncompassionate. 'Doucement! ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re.'\n\nWith great hands and cunning eyes uplifted, Madame tearfully--for her tears\ncame on short notice--again protested her absolute innocence. She had never\nin all her life so much as heard one so villain phrase.\n\n'You see, my dear, you have misheard; young people never attend. You will\ndo well to take advantage of Madame's short residence to get up your French\na little, and the more you are with her the better.'\n\n'I understand then, Mr. Ruthyn, you weesh I should resume my instructions?'\nasked Madame.\n\n'Certainly; and converse all you can in French with Mademoiselle Maud. You\nwill be glad, my dear, that I've insisted on it,' he said, turning to me,\n'when you have reached France, where you will find they speak nothing else.\nAnd now, dear Maud--no, not a word more--you must leave me. Farewell,\nMadame!'\n\nAnd he waved us out a little impatiently; and I, without one look toward\nMadame de la Rougierre, stunned and incensed, walked into my room and shut\nthe door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\n_THE FOOT OF HERCULES_\n\n\nI stood at the window--still the same leaden sky and feathery sleet before\nme--trying to estimate the magnitude of the discovery I had just made.\nGradually a kind of despair seized me, and I threw myself passionately on\nmy bed, weeping aloud.\n\nGood Mary Quince was, of course, beside me in a moment, with her pale,\nconcerned face.\n\n'Oh, Mary, Mary, she's come--that dreadful woman, Madame de la Rougierre,\nhas come to be my governess again; and Uncle Silas won't hear or believe\nanything about her. It is vain talking; he is prepossessed. Was ever so\nunfortunate a creature as I? Who could have fancied or feared such a thing?\nOh, Mary, Mary, what am I to do? what is to become of me? Am I never to\nshake off that vindictive, terrible woman?'\n\nMary said all she could to console me. I was making too much of her. What\nwas she, after all, more than a governess?--she could not hurt me. I was\nnot a child no longer--she could not bully me now; and my uncle, though he\nmight be deceived for a while, would not be long finding her out.\n\nThus and soforth did good Mary Quince declaim, and at last she did impress\nme a little, and I began to think that I had, perhaps, been making too much\nof Madame's visit. But still imagination, that instrument and mirror\nof prophecy, showed her formidable image always on its surface, with a\nterrible moving background of shadows.\n\nIn a few minutes there was a knock at my door, and Madame herself entered.\nShe was in walking costume. There had been a brief clearing of the weather,\nand she proposed our making a promenade together.\n\nOn seeing Mary Quince she broke into a rapture of compliment and greeting,\nand took what Mr. Richardson would have called her passive hand, and\npressed it with wonderful tenderness.\n\nHonest Mary suffered all this somewhat reluctantly, never smiling, and, on\nthe contrary, looking rather ruefully at her feet.\n\n'Weel you make a some tea? When I come back, dear Mary Quince, I 'av so\nmuch to tell you and dear Miss Maud of all my adventures while I 'av been\naway; it will make a you laugh ever so much. I was--what you theenk?--near,\never so near to be married!' And upon this she broke into a screeching\nlaugh, and shook Mary Quince merrily by the shoulder.\n\nI sullenly declined going out, or rising; and when she had gone away, I\ntold Mary that I should confine myself to my room while Madame stayed.\n\nBut self-denying ordinances self-imposed are not always long observed by\nyouth. Madame de la Rougierre laid herself out to be agreeable; she had no\nend of stories--more than half, no doubt, pure fictions--to tell, but all,\nin that triste place, amusing. Mary Quince began to entertain a better\nopinion of her. She actually helped to make beds, and tried to be in\nevery way of use, and seemed to have quite turned over a new leaf; and so\ngradually she moved me, first to listen, and at last to talk.\n\nOn the whole, these terms were better than a perpetual skirmish; but,\nnotwithstanding all her gossip and friendliness, I continued to have a\nprofound distrust and even terror of her.\n\nShe seemed curious about the Bartram-Haugh family, and all their ways, and\nlistened darkly when I spoke. I told her, bit by bit, the whole story of\nDudley, and she used, whenever there was news of the Seamew, to read the\nparagraph for my benefit; and in poor Milly's battered little Atlas she\nused to trace the ship's course with a pencil, writing in, from point to\npoint, the date at which the vessel was 'spoken' at sea. She seemed amused\nat the irrepressible satisfaction with which I received these minutes of\nhis progress; and she used to calculate the distance;--on such a day he was\ntwo hundred and sixty miles, on such another five hundred; the last point\nwas more than eight hundred--good, better, best--best of all would be those\n'deleecious antipode, w'ere he would so soon promener on his head twelve\nthousand mile away;' and at the conceit she would fall into screams of\nlaughter.\n\nLaugh as she might, however, there was substantial comfort in thinking\nof the boundless stretch of blue wave that rolled between me and that\nvillainous cousin.\n\nI was now on very odd terms with Madame. She had not relapsed into her\nfavourite vein of oracular sarcasm and menace; she had, on the contrary,\naffected her good-humoured and genial vein. But I was not to be deceived\nby this. I carried in my heart that deep-seated fear of her which her\nunpleasant good-humour and gaiety never disturbed for a moment. I was very\nglad, therefore, when she went to Todcaster by rail, to make some purchases\nfor the journey which we were daily expecting to commence; and happy in the\nopportunity of a walk, good old Mary Quince and I set forth for a little\nramble.\n\nAs I wished to make some purchases in Feltram, I set out, with Mary Quince\nfor my companion. On reaching the great gate we found it locked. The key,\nhowever, was in it, and as it required more than the strength of my hand to\nturn, Mary tried it. At the same moment old Crowle came out of the sombre\nlodge by its side, swallowing down a mouthful of his dinner in haste. No\none, I believe, liked the long suspicious face of the old man, seldom shorn\nor washed, and furrowed with great, grimy perpendicular wrinkles. Leering\nfiercely at Mary, not pretending to see me, he wiped his mouth hurriedly\nwith the back of his hand, and growled--\n\n'Drop it.'\n\n'Open it, please, Mr. Crowle,' said Mary, renouncing the task.\n\nCrowle wiped his mouth as before, looking inauspicious; shuffling to the\nspot, and muttering to himself, he first satisfied himself that the lock\nwas fast, and then lodged the key in his coat-pocket, and still muttering,\nretraced his steps.\n\n'We want the gate open, please,' said Mary.\n\nNo answer.\n\n'Miss Maud wants to go into the town,' she insisted.\n\n'We wants many a thing we can't get,' he growled, stepping into his\nhabitation.\n\n'Please open the gate,' I said, advancing.\n\nHe half turned on his threshold, and made a dumb show of touching his hat,\nalthough he had none on.\n\n'Can't, ma'am; without an order from master, no one goes out here.'\n\n'You won't allow me and my maid to pass the gate?' I said.\n\n''Tisn't _me_, ma'am,' said he; 'but I can't break orders, and no one goes\nout without the master allows.'\n\nAnd without awaiting further parley, he entered, shutting his hatch behind\nhim.\n\nSo Mary and I stood, looking very foolish at one another. This was the\nfirst restraint I had experienced since Milly and I had been refused a\npassage through the Windmill paling. The rule, however, on which Crowle\ninsisted I felt confident could not have been intended to apply to me. A\nword to Uncle Silas would set all right; and in the meantime I proposed to\nMary that we should take a walk--my favourite ramble--into the Windmill\nWood.\n\nI looked toward Dickon's farmstead as we passed, thinking that Beauty might\nhave been there. I did see the girl, who was plainly watching us. She stood\nin the doorway of the cottage, withdrawn into the shade, and, I fancied,\nanxious to escape observation. When we had passed on a little, I was\nconfirmed in that belief by seeing her run down the footpath which led from\nthe rear of the farm-yard in the direction contrary to that in which we\nwere moving.\n\n'So,' I thought, 'poor Meg falls from me!'\n\nMary Quince and I rambled on through the wood, till we reached the windmill\nitself, and seeing its low arched door open, we entered the chiaro-oscuro\nof its circular basement. As we did so I heard a rush and the creak of a\nplank, and looking up, I saw just a foot--no more--disappearing through the\ntrap-door.\n\nIn the case of one we love or fear intensely, what feats of comparative\nanatomy will not the mind unconsciously perform? Constructing the whole\nliving animal from the turn of an elbow, the curl of a whisker, a segment\nof a hand. How instantaneous and unerring is the instinct!\n\n'Oh, Mary, what have I seen!' I whispered, recovering from the fascination\nthat held my gaze fast to the topmost rounds of the ladder, that\ndisappeared in the darkness above the open door in the loft. 'Come,\nMary--come away.'\n\nAt the same instant appeared the swarthy, sullen face of Dickon Hawkes in\nthe shadow of the aperture. Having but one serviceable leg, his descent\nwas slow and awkward, and having got his head to the level of the loft he\nstopped to touch his hat to me, and to hasp and lock the trap-door.\n\nWhen this was done, the man again touched his hat, and looked steadily and\nsearchingly at me for a second or so, while he got the key into his pocket.\n\n'These fellahs stores their flour too long 'ere, ma'am. There's a deal o'\ntrouble a-looking arter it. I'll talk wi' Silas, and settle that.'\n\nBy this time he had got upon the worn-tiled floor, and touching his hat\nagain, he said--\n\n'I'm a-goin' to lock the door, ma'am!'\n\nSo with a start, and again whispering--\n\n'Come, Mary--come away'--\n\nWith my arm fast in hers, we made a swift departure.\n\n'I feel very faint, Mary,' said I. 'Come quickly. There's nobody following\nus?'\n\n'No, Miss, dear. That man with the wooden leg is putting a padlock on the\ndoor.'\n\n'Come _very_ fast,' I said; and when we had got a little farther, I said,\n'Look again, and see whether anyone is following.'\n\n'No one, Miss,' answered Mary, plainly surprised. 'He's putting the key in\nhis pocket, and standin' there a-lookin' after us.'\n\n'Oh, Mary, did not you see it?'\n\n'What, Miss?' asked Mary, almost stopping.\n\n'Come on, Mary. Don't pause. They will observe us,' I whispered, hurrying\nher forward.\n\n'What did you see, Miss?' repeated Mary.\n\n'_Mr. Dudley_,' I whispered, with a terrified emphasis, not daring to turn\nmy head as I spoke.\n\n'Lawk, Miss!' remonstrated honest Quince, with a protracted intonation\nof wonder and incredulity, which plainly implied a suspicion that I was\ndreaming.\n\n'Yes, Mary. When we went into that dreadful room--that dark, round place--I\nsaw his foot on the ladder. _His_ foot, Mary I can't be mistaken. _I won't\nbe questioned_. You'll _find_ I'm right. He's _here_. He never went in\nthat ship at all. A fraud has been practised on me--it is infamous--it\nis terrible. I'm frightened out of my life. For heaven's sake, look back\nagain, and tell me what you see.'\n\n'_Nothing_, Miss,' answered Mary, in contagious whispers, 'but that\nwooden-legged chap, standin' hard by the door.'\n\n'And no one with him?'\n\n'No one, Miss.'\n\nWe got without pursuit through the gate in the paling. I drew breath so\nsoon as we had reached the cover of the thicket near the chestnut hollow,\nand I began to reflect that whoever the owner of the foot might be--and\nI was still instinctively certain that it was no other than\nDudley--concealment was plainly his object. I need not, then, be at all\nuneasy lest he should pursue us.\n\nAs we walked slowly and in silence along the grassy footpath, I heard a\nvoice calling my name from behind. Mary Quince had not heard it at all, but\nI was quite certain.\n\nIt was repeated twice or thrice, and, looking in considerable doubt and\ntrepidation under the hanging boughs, I saw Beauty, not ten yards away,\nstanding among the underwood.\n\nI remember how white the eyes and teeth of the swarthy girl looked, as with\nhand uplifted toward her ear, she watched us while, as it seemed, listening\nfor more distant sounds.\n\nBeauty beckoned eagerly to me, advancing, with looks of great fear and\nanxiety, two or three short steps toward me.\n\n'_She_ baint to come,' said Beauty, under her breath, so soon as I had\nnearly reached her, pointing without raising her hand at Mary Quince.\n\n'Tell her to sit on the ash-tree stump down yonder, and call ye as loud as\nshe can if she sees any fellah a-comin' this way, an' rin ye back to me;'\nand she impatiently beckoned me away on her errand.\n\nWhen I returned, having made this dispositions, I perceived how pale the\ngirl was.\n\n'Are you ill, Meg?' I asked.\n\n'Never ye mind. Well enough. Listen, Miss; I must tell it all in a crack,\nan' if she calls, rin awa' to her, and le' me to myself, for if fayther or\nt'other un wor to kotch me here, I think they'd kill me a'most. Hish!'\n\nShe paused a second, looking askance, in the direction where she fancied\nMary Quince was. Then she resumed in a whisper--\n\n'Now, lass, mind ye, ye'll keep what I say to yourself. You're not to tell\nthat un nor any other for your life, mind, a word o' what I'm goin' to tell\nye.'\n\n'I'll not say a word. Go on.'\n\n'Did ye see Dudley?'\n\n'I think I saw him getting up the ladder.'\n\n'In the mill? Ha! that's him. He never went beyond Todcaster. He staid in\nFeltram after.'\n\nIt was my turn to look pale now. My worst conjecture was established.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\n_I CONSPIRE_\n\n\n'That's a bad un, he is--oh, Miss, Miss Maud! It's nout that's good as\nkeeps him an' fayther--(mind, lass, ye promised you would not tell no\none)--as keeps them two a-talkin' and a-smokin' secret-like together in the\nmill. An' fayther don't know I found him out. They don't let me into the\ntown, but Brice tells me, and he knows it's Dudley; and it's nout that's\ngood, but summat very bad. An' I reckon, Miss, it's all about you. Be ye\nfrightened, Miss Maud?'\n\nI felt on the point of fainting, but I rallied.\n\n'Not much, Meg. Go on, for Heaven's sake. Does Uncle Silas know he is\nhere?'\n\n'Well, Miss, they were with him, Brice told me, from eleven o'clock to nigh\none o' Tuesday night, an' went in and come out like thieves, 'feard ye'd\nsee 'em.'\n\n'And how does Brice know anything bad?' I asked, with a strange freezing\nsensation creeping from my heels to my head and down again--I am sure\ndeadly pale, but speaking very collectedly.\n\n'Brice said, Miss, he saw Dudley a-cryin' and lookin' awful black, and says\nhe to fayther, \"'Tisn't in my line nohow, an' I can't;\" and says fayther\nto he, \"No one likes they soart o' things, but how can ye help it? The old\nboy's behind ye wi' his pitchfork, and ye canna stop.\" An' wi' that he\nbethought him o' Brice, and says he, \"What be ye a-doin' there? Get ye down\nwi' the nags to blacksmith, do ye.\" An' oop gits Dudley, pullin' his hat\nower his brows, an' says he, \"I wish I was in the _Seamew_. I'm good for\nnout wi' this thing a-hangin' ower me.\" An' that's all as Brice heard. An'\nhe's afeard o' fayther and Dudley awful. Dudley could lick him to pot if\nhe crossed him, and he and fayther 'ud think nout o' havin' him afore the\njustices for poachin', and swearin' him into gaol.'\n\n'But why does he think it's about _me_?'\n\n'Hish!' said Meg, who fancied she heard a sound, but all was quiet. 'I\ncan't say--we're in danger, lass. I don't know why--but _he_ does, an' so\ndo I, an', for that matter, so do _ye_.'\n\n'Meg, I'll leave Bartram.'\n\n'Ye can't.'\n\n'Can't. What do you mean, girl?'\n\n'They won't let ye oot. The gates is all locked. They've dogs--they've\nbloodhounds, Brice says. Ye _can't_ git oot, mind; put that oot o' your\nhead.\n\n'I tell ye what ye'll do. Write a bit o' a note to the lady yonder at\nElverston; an' though Brice be a wild fellah, and 'appen not ower good\nsometimes, he likes me, an' I'll make him take it. Fayther will be grindin'\nat mill to-morrow. Coom ye here about one o'clock--that's if ye see the\nmill-sails a-turnin'--and me and Brice will meet ye here. Bring that old\nlass wi' ye. There's an old French un, though, that talks wi' Dudley. Mind\nye, that un knows nout o' the matter. Brice be a kind lad to me, whatsoe'er\nhe be wi' others, and I think he won't split. Now, lass, I must go. God\nhelp ye; God bless ye; an', for the world's wealth, don't ye let one o'\nthem see ye've got ought in your head, not even that un.'\n\nBefore I could say another word, the girl had glided from me, with a wild\ngesture of silence, and a shake of her head.\n\nI can't at all account for the state in which I was. There are resources\nboth of energy and endurance in human nature which we never suspect until\nthe tremendous voice of necessity summons them into play. Petrified with a\ntotally new horror, but with something of the coldness and impassiveness of\nthe transformation, I stood, spoke, and acted--a wonder, almost a terror,\nto myself.\n\nI met Madame on my return as if nothing had happened. I heard her ugly\ngabble, and looked at the fruits of her hour's shopping, as I might hear,\nand see, and talk, and smile, in a dream.\n\nBut the night was dreadful. When Mary Quince and I were alone, I locked\nthe door. I continued walking up and down the room, with my hands clasped,\nlooking at the inexorable floor, the walls, the ceiling, with a sort\nof imploring despair. I was afraid to tell my dear old Mary. The least\nindiscretion would be failure, and failure destruction.\n\nI answered her perplexed solicitudes by telling her that I was not very\nwell--that I was uneasy; but I did not fail to extract from her a promise\nthat she would not hint to mortal, either my suspicions about Dudley, or\nour rencontre with Meg Hawkes.\n\nI remember how, when, after we had got, late at night, into bed, I sat up,\nshivering with horror, in mine, while honest Mary's tranquil breathing told\nhow soundly she slept. I got up, and looked from the window, expecting to\nsee some of those wolfish dogs which they had brought to the place prowling\nabout the court-yard. Sometimes I prayed, and felt tranquillised, and\nfancied that I was perhaps to have a short interval of sleep. But the\nserenity was delusive, and all the time my nerves were strung hysterically.\nSometimes I felt quite wild, and on the point of screaming. At length that\ndreadful night passed away. Morning came, and a less morbid, though hardly\na less terrible state of mind. Madame paid me an early visit. A thought\nstruck me. I knew that she loved shopping, and I said, quite carelessly--\n\n'Your yesterday's shopping tempts me, Madame, and I must get a few things\nbefore we leave for France. Suppose we go into Feltram to-day, and make my\npurchases, you and I?'\n\nShe looked from the corner of her cunning eye in my face without answering.\nI did not blench, and she said--\n\n'Vary good. I would be vary 'appy,' and again she looked oddly at me.\n\n'Wat hour, my dear Maud? One o'clock? I think that weel de very well, eh?'\n\nI assented, and she grew silent.\n\nI wonder whether I did look as careless as I tried. I do not know. Through\nthe whole of this awful period I was, I think, supernatural; and I even now\nlook back with wonder upon my strange self-command.\n\nMadame, I hoped, had heard nothing of the order which prohibited my exit\nfrom the place. She would herself conduct me to Feltram, and secure, by\naccompanying me, my free egress.\n\nOnce in Feltram, I would assert my freedom, and manage to reach my dear\ncousin Knollys. Back to Bartram no power should convey me. My heart swelled\nand fluttered in the awful suspense of that hour.\n\nOh, Bartram-Haugh! how came you by those lofty walls? Which of my ancestors\nhad begirt me with an impassable barrier in this horrible strait?\n\nSuddenly I remembered my letter to Lady Knollys. If I were disappointed in\neffecting my escape through Feltram, all would depend upon it.\n\nHaving locked my door, I wrote as follows:--\n\n'Oh, my beloved cousin, as you hope for comfort in _your_ hour of fear, aid\nme now. Dudley has returned, and is secreted somewhere about the grounds.\nIt is a _fraud_. They all pretend to me that he is gone away in the\n_Seamew_; and he or they had his name published as one of the passengers.\nMadame de la Rougierre has appeared! She is here, and my uncle insists on\nmaking her my close companion. I am at my wits' ends. I cannot escape--the\nwalls are a prison; and I believe the eyes of my gaolers are always upon\nme. Dogs are kept for pursuit--yes, _dogs_! and the gates are locked\nagainst my escape. God help me! I don't know where to look, or whom to\ntrust. I fear my uncle more than all. I think I could bear this better if I\nknew what their plans are, even the worst. If ever you loved or pitied me,\ndear cousin, I conjure you, help me in this extremity. Take me away from\nthis. Oh, darling, for God's sake take me away!\n\n'Your distracted and terrified cousin,\n\nMAUD'\n\n'Bartram-Haugh.'\n\nI sealed this letter jealously, as if the inanimate missive would burst its\ncerements, and proclaim my desperate appeal through all the chambers and\npassages of silent Bartram.\n\nOld Quince, greatly to cousin Monica's amusement, persisted in furnishing\nme with those capacious pockets which belonged to a former generation. I\nwas glad of this old-world eccentricity now, and placed my guilty letter,\nthat, amidst all my hypocrisies, spoke out with terrible frankness, deep\nin this receptacle, and having hid away the pen and ink, my accomplices, I\nopened the door, and resumed my careless looks, awaiting Madame's return.\n\n'I was to demand to Mr. Ruthyn the permission to go to Feltram, and I think\nhe will allow. He want to speak to you.'\n\nWith Madame I entered my uncle's room. He was reclining on a sofa, his back\ntowards us, and his long white hair, as fine as spun glass, hung over the\nback of the couch.\n\n'I was going to ask you, dear Maud, to execute two or three little\ncommissions for me in Feltram.'\n\nMy dreadful letter felt lighter in my pocket, and my heart beat violently.\n\n'But I have just recollected that this is a market-day, and Feltram will\nbe full of doubtful characters and tipsy persons, so we must wait till\nto-morrow; and Madame says, very kindly, that she will, as she does not\nso much mind, make any little purchases to-day which cannot conveniently\nwait.'\n\nMadame assented with a courtesy to Uncle Silas, and a great hollow smile to\nme.\n\nBy this time Uncle Silas had raised himself from his reclining posture, and\nwas sitting, gaunt and white, upon the sofa.\n\n'News of my prodigal to-day,' he said, with a peevish smile, drawing the\nnewspaper towards him. 'The vessel has been spoken again. How many miles\naway, do you suppose?'\n\nHe spoke in a plaintive key, looking at me, with hungry eyes, and a\nhorribly smiling countenance.\n\n'How far do you suppose Dudley is to-day?' and he laid the palm of his hand\non the paragraph as he spoke. _Guess_!'\n\nFor a moment I fancied this was a theatric preparation to give point to the\ndisclosure of Dudley's real whereabouts.\n\n'It was a very long way. Guess!' he repeated.\n\nSo, stammering a little and pale, I performed the required hypocrisy, after\nwhich my uncle read aloud for my benefit the line or two in which were\nrecorded the event, and the latitude and longitude of the vessel at the\ntime, of which Madame made a note in her memory, for the purpose of making\nher usual tracing in poor Milly's Atlas.\n\nI cannot say how it really was, but I fancied that Uncle Silas was all\nthe time reading my countenance, with a grim and practised scrutiny; but\nnothing came of it, and we were dismissed.\n\nMadame loved shopping, even for its own sake, but shopping with\nopportunities of peculation still more. She she had had her luncheon,\nand was dressed for the excursion, she did precisely what I now most\ndesired--she proposed to take charge of my commissions and my money; and\nthus entrusted, left me at liberty to keep tryst at the Chestnut Hollow.\n\nSo soon as I had seen Madame fairly off, I hurried Mary Quince, and got my\nthings on quickly. We left the house by the side entrance, which I knew my\nuncle's windows did not command. Glad was I to feel a slight breeze, enough\nto make the mill-sails revolve; and as we got further into the grounds,\nand obtained a distant view of the picturesque old windmill, I felt\ninexpressibly relieved on seeing that it was actually working.\n\nWe were now in the Chestnut Hollow, and I sent Mary Quince to her old point\nof observation, which commanded a view of the path in the direction of the\nWindmill Wood, with her former order to call 'I've found it,' as loudly as\nshe could, in case she should see anyone approaching.\n\nI stopped at the point of our yesterday's meeting. I peered under the\nbranches, and my heart beat fast as I saw Meg Hawkes awaiting me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\n_THE LETTER_\n\n\n'Come away, lass,' whispered Beauty, very pale; 'he's here--Tom Brice.'\n\nAnd she led the way, shoving aside the leafless underwood, and we reached\nTom. The slender youth, groom or poacher--he might answer for either--with\nhis short coat and gaitered legs, was sitting on a low horizontal bough,\nwith his shoulder against the trunk.\n\n'_Don't_ ye mind; sit ye still, lad,' said Meg, observing that he was\npreparing to rise, and had entangled his hat in the boughs. 'Sit ye still,\nand hark to the lady. He'll take it, Miss Maud, if he can; wi' na ye, lad?'\n\n'E'es, I'll take it,' he replied, holding out his hand.\n\n'Tom Brice, you won't deceive me?'\n\n'Noa, sure,' said Tom and Meg nearly in the same breath.\n\n'You are an honest English lad, Tom--you would not betray me?' I was\nspeaking imploringly.\n\n'Noa, sure,' repeated Tom.\n\nThere was something a little unsatisfactory in the countenance of this\nlight-haired youth, with the sharpish up-turned nose. Throughout our\ninterview he said next to nothing, and smiled lazily to himself, like a man\nlistening to a child's solemn nonsense, and leading it on, with an amused\nirony, from one wise sally to another.\n\nThus it seemed to me that this young clown, without in the least intending\nto be offensive, was listening to me with a profound and lazy mockery.\n\nI could not choose, however; and, such as he was, I must employ him or\nnone.\n\n'Now, Tom Brice, a great deal depends on this.'\n\n'That's true for her, Tom Brice,' said Meg, who now and then confirmed my\nasseverations.\n\n'I'll give you a pound _now_, Tom,' and I placed the coin and the letter\ntogether in his hand. 'And you are to give this letter to Lady Knollys, at\nElverston; you know Elverston, don't you?'\n\n'He does, Miss. Don't ye, lad?'\n\n'E'es.'\n\n'Well, do so, Tom, and I'll be good to you so long as I live.'\n\n'D'ye hear, lad?'\n\n'E'es,' said Tom; 'it's very good.'\n\n'You'll take the letter, Tom? 'I said, in much greater trepidation as to\nhis answer than I showed.\n\n'E'es, I'll take the letter,' said he, rising, and turning it about in his\nfingers under his eye, like a curiosity.\n\n'Tom Brice,' I said, 'If you can't be true to me, say so; but don't take\nthe letter except to give it to Lady Knollys, at Elverston. If you won't\npromise that, let me have the note back. Keep the pound; but tell me that\nyou won't mention my having asked you to carry a letter to Elverston to\nanyone.'\n\nFor the first time Tom looked perfectly serious. He twiddled the corner of\nmy letter between his finger and thumb, and wore very much the countenance\nof a poacher about to be committed.\n\n'I don't want to chouce ye, Miss; but I must take care o' myself, ye see.\nThe letters goes all through Silas's fingers to the post, and he'd know\ndamn well this worn't among 'em. They do say he opens 'em, and reads 'em\nbefore they go; an' that's his diversion. I don't know; but I do believe\nthat's how it be; an' if this one turned up, they'd all know it went be\nhand, and I'd be spotted for't.'\n\n'But you know who I am, Tom, and I'd save you,' said I, eagerly.\n\n'Ye'd want savin' yerself, I'm thinkin', if that feel oot,' said Tom,\ncynically. 'I don't say, though, I'll not take it--only this--I won't run\nmy head again a wall for no one.'\n\n'Tom,' I said, with a sudden inspiration, 'give me back the letter,\nand take me out of Bartram; take me to Elverston; it will be the best\nthing--for _you_, Tom, I mean--it will indeed--that ever befell you.'\n\nWith this clown I was pleading, as for my life; my hand was on his sleeve.\nI was gazing imploringly in his face.\n\nBut it would not do; Tom Brice looked amused again, swung his head a little\non one side, grinning sheepishly over his shoulder on the roots of the\ntrees beside him, as if he were striving to keep himself from an uncivil\nfit of laughter.\n\n'I'll do what a wise lad may, Miss; but ye don't know they lads; they\nbain't that easy come over; and I won't get knocked on the head, nor sent\nto gaol 'appen, for no good to thee nor me. There's Meg there, she knows\nwell enough I could na' manage that; so I won't try it, Miss, by no chance;\nno offence, Miss; but I'd rayther not, an' I'll just try what I can make\no'this; that's all I can do for ye.'\n\nTom Brice, with these words, stood up, and looked uneasily in the direction\nof the Windmill Wood.\n\n'Mind ye, Miss, coom what will, ye'll not tell o' me?'\n\n'Whar 'ill ye go now, Tom?' inquired Meg, uneasily.\n\n'Never ye mind, lass,' answered he, breaking his way through the thicket,\nand soon disappearing.\n\n'E'es that 'ill be it--he'll git into the sheepwalk behind the mound.\nThey're all down yonder; git ye back, Miss, to the hoose--be the side-door;\nmind ye, don't go round the corner; and I'll jest sit awhile among the\nbushes, and wait a good time for a start. And good-bye, Miss; and don't ye\nshow like as if there was aught out o' common on your mind. Hish!'\n\nThere was a distant hallooing.\n\n'That be fayther!' she whispered, with a very blank countenance, and\nlistened with her sunburnt hand to her ear.\n\n'Tisn't me, only Davy he'll be callin',' she said, with a great sigh, and a\njoyless smile. 'Now git ye away i' God's name.'\n\nSo running lightly along the path, under cover of this thick wood, I\nrecalled Mary Quince, and together we hastened back again to the house, and\nentered, as directed, by the side-door, which did not expose us to be\nseen from the Windmill Wood, and, like two criminals, we stole up by the\nbackstairs, and so through the side-gallery to my room; and there sat down\nto collect my wits, and try to estimate the exact effect of what had just\noccurred.\n\nMadame had not returned. That was well; she always visited my room first,\nand everything was precisely as I had left it--a certain sign that her\nprying eyes and busy fingers had not been at work during my absence.\n\nWhen she did appear, strange to say, it was to bring me unexpected comfort.\nShe had in her hand a letter from my dear Lady Knollys--a gleam of sunlight\nfrom the free and happy outer world entered with it. The moment Madame left\nme to myself, I opened it and read as follows:--\n\n'I am so happy, my dearest Maud, in the immediate prospect of seeing you. I\nhave had a really kind letter from poor Silas--_poor_ I say, for I really\ncompassionate his situation, about which he has been, I do believe, quite\nfrank--at least Ilbury says so, and somehow he happens to know. I have had\nquite an affecting, changed letter. I will tell you all when I see you.\nHe wants me ultimately to undertake that which would afford me the most\nunmixed happiness--I mean the care of you, my dear girl. I only fear lest\nmy too eager acceptance of the trust should excite that vein of opposition\nwhich is in most human beings, and induce him to think over his offer less\nfavourably again. He says I must come to Bartram, and stay a night, and\npromises to lodge me comfortably; about which last I honestly do not care a\npin, when the chance of a comfortable evening's gossip with you is in view.\nSilas explains his sad situation, and must hold himself in readiness for\nearly flight, if he would avoid the risk of losing his personal liberty. It\nis a sad thing that he should have so irretrievably ruined himself,\nthat poor Austin's liberality seems to have positively precipitated his\nextremity. His great anxiety is that I should see you before you leave for\nyour short stay in France. He thinks you must leave before a fortnight. I\nam thinking of asking you to come over here; I know you would be just as\nwell at Elverston as in France; but perhaps, as he seems disposed to do\nwhat we all wish, it may be safer to let him set about it in his own way.\nThe truth is, I have so set my heart upon it that I fear to risk it by\ncrossing him even in a trifle. He says I must fix an early day next week,\nand talks as if he meant to urge me to make a longer visit than he defined.\nI shall be only too happy. I begin, my dear Maud, to think that there is no\nuse in trying to control events, and that things often turn out best, and\nmost exactly to our wishes, by being left quite to themselves. I think\nit was Talleyrand who praised the talent of _waiting_ so much. In high\nspirits, and with my head brimful of plans, I remain, dearest Maud, ever\nyour affectionate cousin,\n\nMONICA.'\n\nHere was an inexplicable puzzle! A faint radiance of hope, however, began\nto overspread a landscape only a few minutes before darkened by total\neclipse; but construct what theory I might, all were inconsistent with many\nwell-established and awful incongruities, and their wrecks lay strown over\nthe troubled waters of the gulf into which I gazed.\n\nWhy was Madame here? Why was Dudley concealed about the place? Why was I a\nprisoner within the walls? What were those dangers which Meg Hawkes seemed\nto think so great and so imminent as to induce her to risk her lover's\nsafety for my deliverance? All these menacing facts stood grouped together\nagainst the dark certainty that never were men more deeply interested in\nmaking away with one human being, than were Uncle Silas and Dudley in\nremoving me.\n\nSometimes to these dreadful evidences I abandoned my soul. Sometimes,\nreading Cousin Monica's sunny letter, the sky would clear, and my terrors\nmelt away like nightmares in the morning. I never repented, however, that\nI had sent my letter by Tom Brice. Escape from Bartram-Haugh was my hourly\nlonging.\n\nThat evening Madame invited herself to tea with me. I did not object.\nIt was better just then to be on friendly relations with everybody, if\npossible, even on their own terms. She was in one of her boisterous and\nhilarious moods, and there was a perfume of brandy.\n\nShe narrated some compliments paid her that morning in Feltram by that\n'good crayature' Mrs. Litheways, the silk-mercer, and what ''ansom faylow'\nwas her new foreman--(she intended plainly that I should 'queez' her)--and\nhow 'he follow' her with his eyes wherever she went. I thought, perhaps, he\nfancied she might pocket some of his lace or gloves. And all the time her\ngreat wicked eyes were rolling and glancing according to her ideas of\nfascination, and her bony face grinning and flaming with the 'strong drink'\nin which she delighted. She sang twaddling chansons, and being, as was her\nwont under such exhilarating influences, in a vapouring mood, she vowed\nthat I should have my carriage and horses immediately.\n\n'I weel try what I can do weeth your Uncle Silas. We are very good\nold friends, Mr. Ruthyn and I,' she said with a leer which I did not\nunderstand, and which yet frightened me.\n\nI never could quite understand why these Jezebels like to insinuate the\ndreadful truth against themselves; but they do. Is it the spirit of\nfeminine triumph overcoming feminine shame, and making them vaunt their\nfall as an evidence of bygone fascination and existing power? Need we\nwonder? Have not women preferred hatred to indifference, and the reputation\nof witchcraft, with all its penalties, to absolute insignificance? Thus, as\nthey enjoyed the fear inspired among simple neighbours by their imagined\ntraffic with the father of ill, did Madame, I think, relish with a cynical\nvainglory the suspicion of her satanic superiority.\n\nNext morning Uncle Silas sent for me. He was seated at his table, and spoke\nhis little French greeting, smiling as usual, pointing to a chair opposite.\n\n'How far, I forget,' he said, carelessly laying his newspaper on the table,\n'did you yesterday guess Dudley to be?'\n\n'Eleven hundred miles I thought it was.'\n\n'Oh yes, so it was;' and then there was an abstracted pause. 'I have been\nwriting to Lord Ilbury, your trustee,' he resumed. I ventured to say, my\ndear Maud--(for having thoughts of a different arrangement for you, more\nsuitable under my distressing circumstances, I do not wish to vacate\nwithout some expression of your estimate of my treatment of you while\nunder my roof)--I ventured to say that you thought me kind, considerate,\nindulgent,--may I say so?'\n\nI assented. What could I say?\n\n'I said you had enjoyed our poor way of living here--our rough ways and\nliberty. Was I right?'\n\nAgain I assented.\n\n'And, in fact, that you had nothing to object against your poor old uncle,\nexcept indeed his poverty, which you forgave. I think I said truth. Did I,\ndear Maud?'\n\nAgain I acquiesced.\n\nAll this time he was fumbling among the papers in his coatpocket.\n\n'That is satisfactory. So I expected you to say,' he murmured. 'I expected\nno less.'\n\nOn a sudden a frightful change spread across his face. He rose like a\nspectre with a white scowl.\n\n'Then how do you account for that?' he shrieked in a voice of thunder, and\nsmiting my open letter to Lady Knollys, face upward, upon the table.\n\nI stared at my uncle, unable to speak, until I seemed to lose sight of him;\nbut his voice, like a bell, still yelled in my ears.\n\n'There! young hypocrite and liar! explain that farrago of slander which you\nbribed my servant to place in the hands of my kinswoman, Lady Knollys.'\n\nAnd so on and on it went, I gazing into darkness, until the voice itself\nbecame indistinct, grew into a buzz, and hummed away into silence.\n\nI think I must have had a fit.\n\nWhen I came to myself I was drenched with water, my hair, face, neck, and\ndress. I did not in the least know where I was. I thought my father was\nill, and spoke to him. Uncle Silas was standing near the window, looking\nunspeakably grim. Madame was seated beside me, and an open bottle of ether,\none of Uncle Silas's restoratives, on the table before me.\n\n'Who's that--who's ill--is anyone dead?' I cried.\n\nAt last I was relieved by long paroxysms of weeping. When I was\nsufficiently recovered, I was conveyed into my own room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\n_LADY KNOLLYS' CARRIAGE_\n\n\nNext morning--it was Sunday--I lay on my bed in my dressing-gown, dull,\napathetic, with all my limbs sore, and, as I thought, rheumatic,\nand feeling so ill that I did not care to speak or lift my head. My\nrecollection of what had passed in Uncle Silas's room was utterly confused,\nand it seemed to me as if my poor father had been there and taken a\nshare--I could not remember how--in the conference.\n\nI was too exhausted and stupid to clear up this horrible muddle, and merely\nlay with my face toward the wall, motionless and silent, except for a great\nsigh every now and then.\n\nGood Mary Quince was in the room--there was some comfort in that; but I\nfelt quite worn out, and had rather she did not speak to me; and indeed for\nthe time I felt absolutely indifferent as to whether I lived or died.\n\nCousin Monica this morning, at pleasant Elverston, all-unconscious of my\nsad plight, proposed to Lady Mary Carysbroke and Lord Ilbury, her\nguests, to drive over to church at Feltram, and then pay us a visit at\nBartram-Haugh, to which they readily agreed.\n\nAccordingly, at about two o'clock, this pleasant party of three arrived at\nBartram. They walked, having left the carriage to follow when the horses\nwere fed; and Madame de la Rougierre, who was in my uncle's room when\nlittle Giblets arrived to say that the party were in the parlour, whispered\nfor a little with my uncle, who then said--\n\n'Miss Maud Ruthyn has gone out to drive, but I shall be happy to see Lady\nKnollys here, if she will do me the favour to come upstairs and see me for\na few moments; and you can mention that I am very far from well.'\n\nMadame followed him out upon the lobby, and added, holding him by the\ncollar, and whispering earnestly in his ear--\n\n'Bring hair ladysheep up by the backstairs--mind, the _back_stairs.'\n\nAnd the next moment Madame entered my room, with long tiptoe steps, and\nlooking, Mary Quince said, as if she were going to be hanged.\n\nOn entering she looked sharply round, and being satisfied of Mary Quince's\npresence, she turned the key in the door, and made some affectionate\nenquiries about me in a whisper; and then she stole to the window and\npeeped out, standing back some way; after which she came to my bedside,\nmurmured some tender sentences, drew the curtain a little, and making some\nlittle fidgety adjustments about the room; among the rest she took the key\nfrom the lock, quietly, and put it into her pocket.\n\nThis was so odd a procedure that honest Mary Quince rose stoutly from her\nchair, pointing to the lock, with her frank little blue eyes fixed on\nMadame, and she whispered--'Won't you put the key in the lock, please?'\n\n'Oh, certainly, Mary Queence; but it is better it shall be locked, for I\nthink her uncle he is coming to see her, and I am sure she would be very\nmuch frightened, for he is very much displease, don't you see? and we can\ntell him she is not well enough, or asleep, and so he weel go away again,\nwithout any trouble.'\n\nI heard nothing of this, which was conducted in close whispers; and Mary,\nalthough she did not give Madame credit for caring whether I was frightened\nor not, and suspected her motives in everything, acquiesced grudgingly,\nfearing lest her alleged reason might possibly be the true one.\n\nSo Madame hovered about the door, uneasily; and of what went on elsewhere\nduring that period Lady Knollys afterwards gave me the following account:--\n\n'We were very much disappointed; but of course I was glad to see Silas, and\nyour little hobgoblin butler led me upstairs to his room a different way, I\nthink, from that I came before; but I don't know the house of Bartram well\nenough to speak positively. I only know that I was conducted quite across\nhis bedroom, which I had not seen on my former visit, and so into his\nsitting-room, where I found him.\n\n'He seemed very glad to see me, came forward smiling--I disliked his smile\nalways--with both hands out, and shook mine with more warmth than I ever\nremembered in his greeting before, and said--\n\n'\"My dear, _dear_ Monica, how _very_ good of you--the very person I longed\nto see! I have been miserably ill, the sad consequence of still more\nmiserable anxiety. Sit down, pray, for a moment.\"\n\n'And he paid me some nice little French compliment in verse.\n\n'\"And where is Maud?\" said I.\n\n'\"I think Maud is by this time about halfway to Elverston,\" said the old\ngentleman. \"I persuaded her to take a drive, and advised a call there,\nwhich seemed to please her, so I conjecture she obeyed.\"\n\n'\"How _very_ provoking!\" cried I.\n\n'\"My poor Maud will be sadly disappointed, but you will console her by a\nvisit--you have promised to come, and I shall try to make you comfortable.\nI shall be happier, Monica, with this proof of our perfect reconciliation.\nYou won't deny me?\"\n\n'\"Certainly not. I am only too glad to come,\" said I; \"and I want to thank\nyou, Silas.\"\n\n'\"For what?\" said he.\n\n'\"For wishing to place Maud in my care. I am very much obliged to you.\"\n\n'\"I did not suggest it, I must say, Monica, with the least intention of\nobliging _you_,\" said Silas.\n\n'I thought he was going to break into one of his ungracious moods.\n\n'\"But I _am_ obliged to you--very much obliged to you, Silas; and you\nsha'n't refuse my thanks.\"\n\n'\"I am happy, at all events, Monica, in having won your good-will; we learn\nat last that in the affections only are our capacities for happiness; and\nhow true is St. Paul's preference of love--the principle that abideth! The\naffections, dear Monica, are eternal; and being so, celestial, divine, and\nconsequently happy, deriving happiness, and bestowing it.\"\n\n'I was always impatient of his or anybody else's metaphysics; but I\ncontrolled myself, and only said, with my customary impudence--\n\n'\"Well, dear Silas, and when do you wish me to come?\"\n\n'\"The earlier the better,\" said he.\n\n'\"Lady Mary and Ilbury will be leaving me on Tuesday morning. I can come to\nyou in the afternoon, if you think Tuesday a good day.\"\n\n'\"Thank you, dear Monica. I shall be, I trust, enlightened by that day as\nto my enemies' plans. It is a humiliating confession, Monica, but I am past\nfeeling that. It is quite possible that an execution may be sent into\nthis house to-morrow, and an end of all my schemes. It is not likely,\nhowever--hardly possible--before three weeks, my attorney tells me. I shall\nhear from him to-morrow morning, and then I shall ask you to name a very\nearly day. If we are to have an unmolested fortnight certain, you shall\nhear, and name your own day.\"\n\n'Then he asked me who had accompanied me, and lamented ever so much his not\nbeing able to go down to receive them; and he offered luncheon, with a sort\nof Ravenswood smile, and a shrug, and I declined, telling him that we had\nbut a few minutes, and that my companions were walking in the grounds near\nthe house.\n\n'I asked whether Maud was likely to return soon?\n\n'\"Certainly not before five o'clock.\" He thought we should probably meet\nher on our way back to Elverston; but could not be certain, as she might\nhave changed her plans.\n\n'So then came--no more remaining to be said--a very affectionate parting. I\nbelieve all about his legal dangers was strictly true. How he could, unless\nthat horrid woman had deceived him, with so serene a countenance tell me\nall those gross untruths about Maud, I can only admire.'\n\nIn the meantime, as I lay in my bed, Madame, gliding hither and thither,\nwhispering sometimes, listening at others, I suddenly startled them both by\nsaying--\n\n'Whose carriage?'\n\n'What carriage, dear?' inquired Quince, whose ears were not so sharp as\nmine.\n\nMadame peeped from the window.\n\n''Tis the physician, Doctor Jolks. He is come to see your uncle, my dear,'\nsaid Madame.\n\n'But I hear a female voice,' I said, sitting up.\n\n'No, my dear; there is only the doctor,' said Madame. 'He is come to your\nuncle. I tell you he is getting out of his carriage,' and she affected to\nwatch the doctor's descent.\n\n'The carriage is driving away!' I cried.\n\n'Yes, it is draiving away,' she echoed.\n\nBut I had sprung from my bed, and was looking over her shoulder, before she\nperceived me.\n\n'It is Lady Knollys!' I screamed, seizing the window-frame to force it up,\nand, vainly struggling to open it, I cried--\n\n'I'm here, Cousin Monica. For God's sake, Cousin Monica--Cousin Monica!'\n\n'You are mad, Meess--go back,' screamed Madame, exerting her superior\nstrength to force me back.\n\nBut I saw deliverance and escape gliding away from my reach, and, strung\nto unnatural force by desperation, I pushed past her, and beat the window\nwildly with my hands, screaming--\n\n'Save me--save me! Here, here, Monica, here! Cousin, cousin, oh! save me!'\n\nMadame had seized my wrists, and a wild struggle was going on. A\nwindow-pane was broken, and I was shrieking to stop the carriage. The\nFrenchwoman looked black and haggard as a fury, as if she could have\nmurdered me.\n\nNothing daunted--frantic--I screamed in my despair, seeing the carriage\ndrive swiftly away--seeing Cousin Monica's bonnet, as she sat chatting with\nher _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_.\n\n'Oh, oh, oh!' I shrieked, in vain and prolonged agony, as Madame, exerting\nher strength and matching her fury against my despair, forced me back in\nspite of my wild struggles, and pushed me sitting on the bed, where she\nheld me fast, glaring in my face, and chuckling and panting over me.\n\nI think I felt something of the despair of a lost spirit.\n\nI remember the face of poor Mary Quince--its horror, its wonder--as she\nstood gaping into my face, over Madame's shoulder, and crying--\n\n'What is it, Miss Maud? What is it, dear?' And turning fiercely on Madame,\nand striving to force her grasp from my wrists, 'Are you hurting the child?\nLet her go--let her go.'\n\n'I _weel_ let her go. Wat old fool are you, Mary Queence! She is mad, I\nthink. She 'as lost hair head.'\n\n'Oh, Mary, cry from the window. Stop the carriage!' I cried.\n\nMary looked out, but there was by this time, of course, nothing in sight.\n\n'Why don't a you stop the carriage?' sneered Madame. 'Call a the coachman\nand the postilion. W'ere is the footman? Bah! _elle a le cerveau mal\ntimbr\u00c3\u00a9_.'\n\n'Oh, Mary, Mary, is it gone--is it gone? Is there nothing there?' cried I,\nrushing to the window; and turning to Madame, after a vain straining of my\neyes, my face against the glass--\n\n'Oh, cruel, cruel, wicked woman! why have you done this? What was it to\nyou? Why do you persecute me? What good _can_ you gain by my ruin?'\n\n'Rueen! Par bleu! ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re, you talk too fast. Did not a you see it, Mary\nQueence? It was the doctor's carriage, and Mrs. Jolks, and that eempudent\nfaylow, young Jolks, staring up to the window, and Mademoiselle she come in\nsoche shocking d\u00c3\u00a9shabille to show herself knocking at the window. 'Twould\nbe very nice thing, Mary Queence, don't you think?'\n\nI was sitting now on the bedside, crying in mere despair. I did not care to\ndispute or to resist. Oh! why had rescue come so near, only to prove that\nit could not reach me? So I went on crying, with a clasping of my hands and\nturning up of my eyes, in incoherent prayer. I was not thinking of Madame,\nor of Mary Quince, or any other person, only babbling my anguish and\ndespair helplessly in the ear of heaven.\n\n'I did not think there was soche fool. Wat _enfant gat\u00c3\u00a9_! My dear cheaile,\nwat a can you _mean_ by soche strange language and conduct? Wat for should\na you weesh to display yourself in the window in soche 'orrible d\u00c3\u00a9shabille\nto the people in the doctor's coach?'\n\n'It was _Cousin Knollys_--Cousin Knollys. Oh, Cousin Knollys! You're\ngone--you're gone--you're _gone_!'\n\n'And if it was Lady Knollys' coach, there was certainly a coachman and a\nfootman; and whoever has the coach there was young gentlemen in it. If it\nwas Lady Knollys' carriage it would 'av been _worse_ than the doctor.'\n\n'It is no matter--it is all over. Oh, Cousin Monica, your poor Maud--where\nis she to turn? Is there no help?'\n\nThat evening Madame visited me again, in one of her sedate and moral moods.\nShe found me dejected and passive, as she had left me.\n\n'I think, Maud, there is news; but I am not certain.'\n\nI raised my head and looked at her wistfully.\n\n'I think there is letter of _bad_ news from the attorney in London.'\n\n'Oh!' I said, in a tone which I am sure implied the absolute indifference\nof dejection.\n\n'But, my dear Maud, if't be so, we shall go at once, you and me, to join\nMeess Millicent in France. La belle France! You weel like so moche! We\nshall be so gay. You cannot imagine there are such naice girl there. They\nall love a me so moche, you will be delight.'\n\n'How soon do we go?' I asked.\n\n'I do not know. Bote I was to bring in a case of eau de cologne that came\nthis evening, and he laid down a letter and say:--\"The blow has descended,\nMadame! My niece must hold herself in readiness.\" I said, \"For what,\nMonsieur?\" _twice_; bote he did not answer. I am sure it is _un proc\u00c3\u00a8s_.\nThey 'av ruin him. Eh bien, my dear. I suppose we shall leave this triste\nplace immediately. I am so rejoice. It appears to me _un cimeti\u00c3\u00a8re_!'\n\n'Yes, I should like to leave it,' I said, sitting up, with a great sigh and\nsunken eyes. It seemed to me that I had quite lost all sense of resentment\ntowards Madame. A debility of feeling had supervened--the fatigue, I\nsuppose, and prostration of the passions.\n\n'I weel make excuse to go into his room again,' said Madame; 'and I weel\nendeavor to learn something more from him, and I weel come back again to\nyou in half an hour.'\n\nShe departed. But in half an hour did not return. I had a dull longing to\nleave Bartram-Haugh. For me, since the departure of poor Milly, it had\ngrown like the haunt of evil spirits, and to escape on any terms from it\nwas a blessing unspeakable.\n\nAnother half-hour passed, and another, and I grew insufferably feverish.\nI sent Mary Quince to the lobby to try and see Madame, who, I feared, was\nprobably to-ing and fro-ing in and out of Uncle Silas's room.\n\nMary returned to tell me that she had seen old Wyat, who told her that she\nthought Madame had gone to her bed half an hour before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\n_A SUDDEN DEPARTURE_\n\n\n'Mary,' said I, 'I am miserably anxious to hear what Madame may have to\ntell; she knows the state I am in, and she would not like so much trouble\nas to look in at my door to say a word. Did you hear what she told me?'\n\n'No, Miss Maud,' she answered, rising and drawing near.\n\n'She thinks we are going to France immediately, and to leave this place\nperhaps for ever.'\n\n'Heaven be praised for that, if it be so, Miss!' said Mary, with more\nenergy than was common with her, 'for there is no luck about it, and I\ndon't expect to see you ever well or happy in it.'\n\n'You must take your candle, Mary, and make out her room, upstairs; I found\nit accidentally myself one evening.'\n\n'But Wyat won't let us upstairs.'\n\n'Don't mind her, Mary; I tell you to go. You must try. I can't sleep till\nwe hear.'\n\n'What direction is her room in, Miss?' asked Mary.\n\n'Somewhere in _that_ direction, Mary,' I answered, pointing. 'I cannot\ndescribe the turns; but I think you will find it if you go along the great\npassage to your left, on getting to the top of the stairs, till you come to\nthe cross-galleries, and then turn to your left; and when you have passed\nfour or perhaps five doors, you must be very near it, and I am sure she\nwill hear if you call.'\n\n'But will she tell me--she _is_ such a rum un, Miss?' suggested Mary.\n\n'Tell her exactly what I have said to you, and when she learns that you\nalready know as much as I do, she may--unless, indeed, she wishes to\ntorture me. If she won't, perhaps at least you can persuade her to come to\nme for a moment. Try, dear Mary; we can but fail.'\n\n'Will you be very lonely, Miss, while I am away?' asked Mary, uneasily, as\nshe lighted her candle.\n\n'I can't help it, Mary. Go. I think if I heard we were going, I could\nalmost get up and dance and sing. I can't bear this dreadful uncertainty\nany longer.'\n\n'If old Wyat is outside, I'll come back and wait here a bit, till she's out\no' the way,' said Mary; 'and, anyhow, I'll make all the haste I can. The\ndrops and the sal-volatile is here, Miss, by your hand.'\n\nAnd with an anxious look at me, she made her exit, softly, and did not\nimmediately return, by which I concluded that she had found the way clear,\nand had gained the upper story without interruption.\n\nThis little anxiety ended, its subsidence was followed by a sense of\nloneliness, and with it, of vague insecurity, which increased at last to\nsuch a pitch, that I wondered at my own madness in sending my companion\naway; and at last my terrors so grew, that I drew back into the farthest\ncorner of the bed, with my shoulders to the wall, and my bed-clothes\nhuddled about me, with only a point open to peep at.\n\nAt last the door opened gently.\n\n'Who's there?' I cried, in extremity of horror, expecting I knew not whom.\n\n'Me, Miss,' whispered Mary Quince, to my unutterable relief; and with her\ncandle flared, and a wild and pallid face, Mary Quince glided into the\nroom, locking the door as she entered.\n\nI do not know how it was, but I found myself holding Mary fast with both my\nhands as we stood side by side on the floor.\n\n'Mary, you are terrified; for God's sake, what is the matter?' I cried.\n\n'No, Miss,' said Mary, faintly, 'not much.'\n\n'I see it in your face. What is it?'\n\n'Let me sit down, Miss. I'll tell you what I saw; only I'm just a bit\nqueerish.'\n\nMary sat down by my bed.\n\n'Get in, Miss; you'll take cold. Get into bed, and I'll tell you. It is not\nmuch.'\n\nI did get into bed, and gazing on Mary's frightened face, I felt a\ncorresponding horror.\n\n'For mercy's sake, Mary, say what it is?'\n\nSo again assuring me 'it was not much,' she gave me in a somewhat diffuse\nand tangled narrative the following facts:--\n\nOn closing my door, she raised her candle above her head and surveyed the\nlobby, and seeing no one there she ascended the stairs swiftly. She passed\nalong the great gallery to the left, and paused a moment at the cross\ngallery, and then recollected my directions clearly, and followed the\npassage to the right.\n\nThere are doors at each side, and she had forgotten to ask me at which\nMadame's was. She opened several. In one room she was frightened by a bat,\nwhich had very nearly put her candle out. She went on a little, paused, and\nbegan to lose heart in the dismal solitude, when on a sudden, a few doors\nfarther on, she thought she heard Madame's voice.\n\nShe said that she knocked at the door, but receiving no answer, and hearing\nMadame still talking within, she opened it.\n\nThere was a candle on the chimneypiece, and another in a stable lantern\nnear the window. Madame was conversing volubly on the hearth, with her face\ntoward the window, the entire frame of which had been taken from its place:\nDickon Hawkes, the Zamiel of the wooden leg, was supporting it with one\nhand, as it leaned imperfectly against the angle of the recess. There was\na third figure standing, buttoned up in a surtout, with a bundle of tools\nunder his arm, like a glazier, and, with a silent thrill of fear, she\ndistinctly recognised the features as those of Dudley Ruthyn.\n\n''Twas him, Miss, so sure as I sit here! Well, like that, they were as mute\nas mice; three pairs of eyes were on me. I don't know what made me so study\nlike, but som'at told me I should not make as though I knew any but Madame;\nand so I made a courtesy, as well as I could, and I said, \"Might I speak a\nword wi' ye, please, on the lobby?\"\n\n'Mr. Dudley was making belief be this time to look out at window, wi' his\nback to me, and I kept looking straight on Madame, and she said, \"They're\nmendin' my broken glass, Mary,\" walking between them and me, and coming\nclose up to me very quick; and so she marched me backward out o' the door,\nprating all the time.\n\n'When we were on the lobby, she took my candle from my hand, shutting the\ndoor behind her, and she held the light a bit behind her ear; so'twas full\non my face, as she looked sharp into it; and, after a bit, she said again,\nin her queer lingo--there was two panes broke in her room, and men sent for\nto mend it.\n\n'I was awful frightened when I saw Mr. Dudley, for I could not believe any\nsuch thing before, and I don't know how I could look her in the face as I\ndid and not show it. I was as smooth and cool as yonder chimneypiece, and\nshe has an awful evil eye to stan' against; but I never flinched, and I\nthink she's puzzled, for as cunning as she is, whether I believe all she\nsaid, or knowed 'twas a pack o' stories. So I told her your message, and\nshe said she had not heard another word since; but she did believe we had\nnot many more days here, and would tell you if she heard to-night, when she\nbrought his soup to your uncle, in half an hour's time.'\n\nI asked her, as soon as I could speak, whether she was perfectly certain as\nto the fact that the man in the surtout was Dudley, and she made answer--\n\n'I'd swear to him on that Bible, Miss.'\n\nSo far from any longer wishing Madame's return that night, I trembled at\nthe idea of it. Who could tell who might enter the room with her when the\ndoor opened to admit her?\n\nDudley, so soon as he recovered the surprise, had turned about, evidently\nanxious to prevent recognition; Dickon Hawkes stood glowering at her. Both\nmight have hope of escaping recognition in the imperfect light, for the\ncandle on the chimneypiece was flaring in the air, and the light from the\nlantern fell in spots, and was confusing.\n\nWhat could that ruffian, Hawkes, be doing in the house? Why was Dudley\nthere? Could a more ominous combination be imagined? I puzzled my\ndistracted head over all Mary Quince's details, but could make nothing of\ntheir occupation. I know of nothing so terrifying as this kind of perpetual\npuzzling over ominous problems.\n\nYou may imagine how the long hours of that night passed, and how my heart\nbeat at every fancied sound outside my door.\n\nBut morning came, and with its light some reassurance. Early, Madame de la\nRougierre made her appearance; she searched my eyes darkly and shrewdly,\nbut made no allusion to Mary Quince's visit. Perhaps she expected some\nquestion from me, and, hearing none, thought it as well to leave the\nsubject at rest.\n\nShe had merely come in to say that she had heard nothing since, but was now\ngoing to make my uncle's chocolate; and that so soon as her interview was\nended she would see me again, and let me hear anything she should have\ngleaned.\n\nIn a little while a knock came to my door, and Mary Quince was ordered by\nold Wyat into my uncle's room. She returned flushed, in a huge fuss, to say\nthat I was to be up and dressed for a journey in half an hour, and to go\nstraight, when dressed, to my uncle's room.\n\nIt was good news; at the same time it was a shock. I was glad. I was\nstunned. I jumped out of bed, and set about my toilet with an energy quite\nnew to me. Good Mary Quince was busily packing my boxes, and consulting as\nto what I should take with me, and what not.\n\nWas Mary Quince to accompany me? He had not said a word on that point; and\nI feared from his silence she was to remain. There was comfort, however, in\nthis--that the separation would not be for long; I felt confident of that;\nand I was about to join Milly, whom I loved better than I could have\nbelieved before our separation; but whatsoever the conditions might be,\nit was an indescribable relief to have done with Bartram-Haugh, and leave\nbehind me its sinister lines of circumvallation, its haunted recesses, and\nthe awful spectres that had lately appeared within its walls.\n\nI stood too much in awe of my uncle to fail in presenting myself punctually\nat the close of the half-hour. I entered his sitting-room under the shadow\nof sour old Wyat's high-cauled cap; she closed the door behind me, and the\nconference commenced.\n\nMadame de la Rougierre sat there, dressed and draped for a journey, and\nwith a thick black lace veil on. My uncle rose, gaunt and venerable, and\nwith a harsh and severe countenance. He did not offer his hand; he made me\na kind of bow, more of repulsion than of respect. He remained in a standing\nposition, supporting his crooked frame by his hand, which he leaned on a\ndespatch-box; he glared on me steadily with his wild phosphoric eyes, from\nunder the dark brows I have described to you, now corrugated in lines\nindescribably stern.\n\n'You shall join my daughter at the Pension, in France; Madame de la\nRougierre shall accompany you,' said my uncle, delivering his directions\nwith the stern monotony and the measured pauses of a person dictating an\nimportant despatch to a secretary.' Old Mrs. Quince shall follow with me,\nor, if alone, in a week. You shall pass to-night in London; to-morrow night\nyou proceed thence to Dover, and cross by the mail-packet. You shall now\nsit down and write a letter to your cousin Monica Knollys, which I will\nfirst read and then despatch. Tomorrow you shall write a note to Lady\nKnollys, from _London_, telling her how you have got over so much of your\njourney, and that you cannot write from Dover, as you must instantly start\nby the packet on reaching it; and that until my affairs are a little\nsettled, you cannot write to her from France, as it is of high importance\nto my safety that no clue should exist as to our address. Intelligence,\nhowever, shall reach her through my attorneys, Archer and Sleigh, and I\ntrust we shall soon return. You will, please, submit that latter note to\nMadame de la Rougierre, who has my directions to see that it contains no\n_libels_ upon my character. Now, sit down.'\n\nSo, with those unpleasant words tingling in my ears, I obeyed.\n\n'_Write_,' said he, when I was duly placed. 'You shall convey the substance\nof what I say in your own language. The immiment danger this morning\nannounced of an execution--remember the word,' and he spelled it for\nme--'being put into this house either this afternoon or to-morrow, compels\nme to anticipate my plans, and despatch you for France this day. That you\nare starting with an attendant.' Here an uneasy movement from Madame,\nwhose dignity was perhaps excited. 'An _attendant_,' he repeated, with a\ndiscordant emphasis; 'and you can, if you please--but I don't _solicit_\nthat justice--say that you have been as kindly treated here as my\nunfortunate circumstances would permit. That is all. You have just fifteen\nminutes to write. Begin.'\n\nI wrote accordingly. My hysterical state had made me far less combative\nthan I might have proved some months since, for there was much that was\ninsulting as well as formidable in his manner. I completed my letter,\nhowever, to his satisfaction in the prescribed time; and he said, as he\nlaid it and its envelope on the table--\n\n'Please to remember that this lady is not your attendant only, but that she\nhas authority to direct every detail respecting your journey, and will make\nall the necessary payments on the way. You will please, then, implicitly to\ncomply with her directions. The carriage awaits you at the hall-door.'\n\nHaving thus spoken, with another grim bow, and 'I wish you a safe and\npleasant journey,' he receded a step or two, and I, with an undefinable\nkind of melancholy, though also with a sense of relief, withdrew.\n\nMy letter, I afterwards found, reached Lady Knollys, accompanied by one\nfrom Uncle Silas, who said--'Dear Maud apprises me that she has written\nto tell you something of our movements. A sudden crisis in my miserable\naffairs compels a break-up as sudden here. Maud joins my daughter at the\nPension, in France. I purposely omit the address, because I mean to\nreside in its vicinity until this storm shall have blown over; and as the\nconsequences of some of my unhappy entanglements might pursue me even\nthere, I must only for the present spare you the pain and trouble of\nkeeping a secret. I am sure that for some little time you will excuse\nthe girl's silence; in the meantime you shall hear of them, and perhaps\ncircuitously, from me. Our dear Maud started this morning _en route_ for\nher destination, very sorry, as am I, that she could not enjoy first a\nflying visit to Elverston, but in high spirits, notwithstanding, at the new\nlife and sights before her.'\n\nAt the door my beloved old friend, Mary Quince, awaited me.\n\n'Am I going with you, Miss Maud?'\n\nI burst into tears and clasped her in my arms.\n\n'I'm not,' said Mary, very sorrowfully; 'and I never was from you yet,\nMiss, since you wasn't the length of my arm.'\n\nAnd kind old Mary began to cry with me.\n\n'Bote you are coming in a few days, Mary Quince,' expostulated Madame. 'I\nwonder you are soche fool. What is two, three days? Bah! nonsense, girl.'\n\nAnother farewell to poor Mary Quince, quite bewildered at the suddenness of\nher bereavement. A serious and tremulous bow from our little old butler on\nthe steps. Madame bawling through the open window to the driver to make\ngood speed, and remember that we had but nineteen minutes to reach the\nstation. Away we went. Old Crowle's iron _grille_ rolled back before us.\nI looked on the receding landscape, the giant trees--the palatial,\ntime-stained mansion. A strange conflict of feelings, sweet and bitter,\nrose and mingled in the reverie. Had I been too hard and suspicious with\nthe inhabitants of that old house of my family? Was my uncle _justly_\nindignant? Was I ever again to know such pleasant rambles as some of those\nI had enjoyed with dear Millicent through the wild and beautiful woodlands\nI was leaving behind me? And there, with my latest glimpse of the front\nof Bartram-Haugh, I beheld dear old Mary Quince gazing after us. Again\nmy tears flowed. I waved my handkerchief from the window; and now the\npark-wall hid all from view, and at a great pace, throught the steep wooded\nglen, with the rocky and precipitous character of a ravine, we glided; and\nwhen the road next emerged, Bartram-Haugh was a misty mass of forest and\nchimneys, slope and hollow, and we within a few minutes of the station.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\n_THE JOURNEY_\n\n\nWaiting for the train, as we stood upon the platform, I looked back again\ntoward the wooded uplands of Bartram; and far behind, the fine range of\nmountains, azure and soft in the distance, beyond which lay beloved old\nKnowl, and my lost father and mother, and the scenes of my childhood, never\nembittered except by the sibyl who sat beside me.\n\nUnder happier circumstances I should have been, at my then early age, quite\nwild with pleasurable excitement on entering London for the first time.\nBut black Care sat by me, with her pale hand in mine: a voice of fear and\nwarning, whose words I could not catch, was always in my ear. We drove\nthrough London, amid the glare of lamps, toward the West-end, and for a\nlittle while the sense of novelty and curiosity overcame my despondency,\nand I peeped eagerly from the window; while Madame, who was in high\ngood-humour, spite of the fatigues of our long railway flight, screeched\nscraps of topographic information in my ear; for London was a picture-book\nin which she was well read.\n\n'That is Euston Square, my dear--Russell Square. Here is Oxford\nStreet--Haymarket. See, there is the Opera House--Hair Majesty's Theatre.\nSee all the carriages waiting;' and so on, till we reached at length a\nlittle narrow street, which she told me was off Piccadilly, where we drew\nup before a private house, as it seemed to me--a family hotel--and I was\nglad to be at rest for the night.\n\nFatigued with the peculiar fatigue of railway travelling, dusty, a little\nchilly, with eyes aching and wearied, I ascended the stairs silently, our\ngarrulous and bustling landlady leading the way, and telling her oft-told\nstory of the house, its noble owner in old time, and how those fine\ndrawing-rooms were taken every year during the Session by the Bishop of\nRochet-on-Copeley, and at last into our double-bedded room.\n\nI would fain have been alone, but I was too tired and dejected to care very\nmuch for anything.\n\nAt tea, Madame expanded in spirit, like a giant refreshed, and chattered\nand sang; and at last, seeing that I was nodding, advised my going to bed,\nwhile she ran across the street to see 'her dear old friend, Mademoiselle\nSt. Eloi, who was sure to be up, and would be offended if she failed to\nmake her ever so short a call.'\n\nI cared little what she said, and was glad to be rid of her even for a\nshort time, and was soon fast asleep.\n\nI saw her, I know not how much later, poking about the room, like a figure\nin a dream, and taking off her things.\n\nShe had her breakfast in bed next morning, and I was, to my comfort, left\nto take mine in solitary possession of our sitting-room; where I began to\nwonder how little annoyance I had as yet suffered from her company, and\nbegan to speculate upon the chances of my making the journey with tolerable\ncomfort.\n\nOur hostess gave me five minutes of her valuable time. Her talk ran chiefly\nupon nuns and convents, and her old acquaintance with Madame; and it seemed\nto me that she had at one time driven a kind of trade, no doubt profitable\nenough, in escorting young ladies to establishments on the Continent; and\nalthough I did not then quite understand the tone in which she spoke to me,\nI often thought afterwards that Madame had represented me as a young person\ndestined for the holy vocation of the veil.\n\nWhen she was gone, I sat listlessly looking out of the window, and saw some\nchance equipages drive by, and now and then a fashionable pedestrian; and\nwondered if this quiet thoroughfare could really be one of the arteries so\nnear the heart of the tumultuous capital.\n\nI think my nervous vitality must have burnt very low just then, for I felt\nperfectly indifferent about all the novelty and world of wonders beyond,\nand should have hated to leave the dull tranquillity of my window for an\nexcursion through the splendours of the unseen streets and palaces that\nsurrounded me.\n\nIt was one o'clock before Madame joined me; and finding me in this dull\nmood, she did not press me to accompany her in her drive, no doubt well\npleased to be rid of me.\n\nAfter tea that evening, as we sat alone in our room, she entertained me\nwith some very odd conversation--at the time unintelligible--but which\nacquired a tolerably distinct meaning from the events that followed.\n\nTwo or three times that day Madame appeared to me on the point of saying\nsomething of grave import, as she scanned me with her bleak wicked stare.\n\nIt was a peculiarity of hers, that whenever she was pressed upon by an\nanxiety that really troubled her, her countenance did not look sad or\nsolicitous, as other people's would, but simply wicked. Her great gaunt\nmouth was compressed and drawn down firmly at the corners, and her eyes\nglared with a dismal scowl.\n\nAt last she said suddenly--\n\n'Are you ever grateful, Maud?'\n\n'I hope so, Madame,' I answered.\n\n'And how do you show your gratitude? For instance, would a you do great\ndeal for a person who would run _risque_ for your sake?'\n\nIt struck me all at once that she was sounding me about poor Meg Hawkes,\nwhose fidelity, notwithstanding the treason or cowardice of her lover, Tom\nBrice, I never doubted; and I grew at once wary and reserved.\n\n'I know of no opportunity, thank Heaven, for any such service, Madame. How\ncan anyone serve me at present, by themselves incurring danger? What do you\nmean?'\n\n'Do you like, for example, to go to that French Pension? Would you not like\nbetter some other arrangement?'\n\n'Of course there are other arrangements I should like better; but I see no\nuse in talking of them; they are not to be,' I answered.\n\n'What other arrangements do you mean, my dear cheaile?' enquired Madame.\n'You mean, I suppose, you would like better to go to Lady Knollys?'\n\n'My uncle does not choose it at present; and except with his consent\nnothing can be done!'\n\n'He weel never consent, dear cheaile.'\n\n'But he _has_ consented--not immediately indeed, but in a short time, when\nhis affairs are settled.'\n\n'_Lanternes_! They will never be settle,' said Madame.\n\n'At all events, for the present I am to go to France. Milly seems very\nhappy, and I dare say I shall like it too. I am very glad to leave\nBartram-Haugh, at all events.'\n\n'But your uncle weel bring you back there,' said Madame, drily.\n\n'It is doubtful whether he will ever return to Bartram himself,' I said.\n\n'Ah!' said Madame, with a long-drawn nasal intonation, 'you theenk I hate\nyou. You are quaite wrong, my dear Maud. I am, on the contrary, very much\ninterested for you--I am, I assure you, dear a cheaile.'\n\nAnd she laid her great hand, with joints misshapen by old chilblains, upon\nthe back of mine. I looked up in her face. She was not smiling. On the\ncontrary, her wide mouth was drawn down at the corners ruefully, as before,\nand she gazed on my face with a scowl from her abysmal eyes.\n\nI used to think the flare of that irony which lighted her face so often\nimmeasurably worse than any other expression she could assume; but this\nlack-lustre stare and dismal collapse of feature was more wicked still.\n\n'Suppose I should bring you to Lady Knollys, and place you in her charge,\nwhat would a you do then for poor Madame?' said this dark spectre.\n\nI was inwardly startled at these words. I looked into her unsearchable\nface, but could draw thence nothing but fear. Had she made the same\noverture only two days since, I think I would have offered her half my\nfortune. But circumstances were altered. I was no longer in the panic of\ndespair. The lesson I had received from Tom Brice was fresh in my mind, and\nmy profound distrust of her was uppermost. I saw before me only a tempter\nand betrayer, and said--\n\n'Do you mean to imply, Madame, that my guardian is not to be trusted, and\nthat I ought to make my escape from him, and that you are really willing to\naid me in doing so?'\n\nThis, you see, was turning the tables upon her. I looked her steadily in\nthe face as I spoke. She returned my gaze with a strange stare and a gape,\nwhich haunted me long after; and it seemed as we sat in utter silence that\neach was rather horribly fascinated by the other's gaze.\n\nAt last she shut her mouth sternly, and eyes me with a more determined and\nmeaning scowl, and then said in a low tone--\n\n'I believe, Maud, that you are a cunning and wicked little thing.'\n\n'Wisdom is not cunning, Madame; nor is it wicked to ask your meaning in\nexplicit language,' I replied.\n\n'And so, you clever cheaile, we two sit here, playing at a game of chess,\nover this little table, to decide which shall destroy the other--is it not\nso?'\n\n'I will not allow you to destroy me,' I retorted, with a sudden flash.\n\nMadame stood up, and rubbed her mouth with her open hand. She looked to me\nlike some evil being seen in a dream. I was frightened.\n\n'You are going to hurt me!' I ejaculated, scarce knowing what I said.\n\n'If I were, you deserve it. You are very _malicious_, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re: or, it may\nbe, only very stupid.'\n\nA knock came to the door.\n\n'Come in,' I cried, with a glad sense of relief.\n\nA maid entered.\n\n'A letter, please, 'm,' she said, handing it to me.\n\n'For _me_,' snarled Madame, snatching it.\n\nI had seen my uncle's hand, and the Feltram post-mark.\n\nMadame broke the seal, and read. It seemed but a word, for she turned it\nabout after the first momentary glance, and examined the interior of the\nenvelope, and then returned to the line she had already read.\n\nShe folded the letter again, drawing her nails in a sharp pinch along the\ncreases, as she stared in a blank, hesitating way at me.\n\n'You are stupid little ingrate, I am employ by Monsieur Ruthyn, and of\ncourse I am faithful to my employer. I do not want to talk to you. _There_,\nyou may read that.'\n\nShe jerked the letter before me on the table. It contained but these\nwords:--\n\nBartram-Haugh:\n\n'_30th January, 1845_.\n\n'MY DEAR MADAME,\n\n'Be so good as to take the half-past eight o'clock train to _Dover_\nto-night. Beds are prepared.--Yours very truly,\n\nSILAS RUTHYN.'\n\nI cannot say what it was in this short advice that struck me with fear. Was\nit the thick line beneath the word 'Dover,' that was so uncalled for, and\ngave me a faint but terrible sense of something preconcerted?\n\nI said to Madame--\n\n'Why is \"Dover\" underlined?'\n\n'I do not know, little fool, no more than you. How can I tell what is\npassing in your oncle's head when he make that a mark?'\n\n'Has it not a meaning, Madame?'\n\n'How can you talk like that?' she answered, more in her old way. 'You are\neither mocking of me, or you are becoming truly a fool!'\n\nShe rang the bell, called for our bill, saw our hostess; while I made a few\nhasty prepartions in my room.\n\n'You need not look after the trunks--they will follow us all right. Let us\ngo, cheaile--we 'av half an hour only to reach the train.'\n\nNo one ever fussed like Madame when occasion offered. There was a cab at\nthe door, into which she hurried me. I assumed that she would give all\nneedful directions, and leaned back, very weary and sleepy already, though\nit was so early, listening to her farewell screamed from the cab-step, and\nseeing her black cloak flitting and flapping this way and that, like the\nwings of a raven disturbed over its prey.\n\nIn she got, and away we drove through a glare of lamps, and shop-windows,\nstill open; gas everywhere, and cabs, busses, and carriages, still\nthundering through the streets. I was too tired and too depressed to look\nat those things. Madame, on the contrary, had her head out of the window\ntill we reached the station.\n\n'Where are the rest of the boxes?' I asked, as Madame placed me in charge\nof her box and my bag in the office of the terminus.\n\n'They will follow with Boots in another cab, and will come safe with us in\nthis train. Mind those two, we weel bring in the carriage with us.'\n\nSo into a carriage we got; in came Madame's box and my bag; Madame stood at\nthe door, and, I think, frightened away intending passengers, by her size\nand shrillness.\n\nAt last the bell rang her into her place, the door clapt, the whistle\nsounded, and we were off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\n_OUR BED-CHAMBER_\n\n\nI had passed a miserable night, and, indeed, for many nights had not had my\ndue proportion of sleep. Still I sometimes fancy that I may have swallowed\nsomething in my tea that helped to make me so irresistibly drowsy. It was a\nvery dark night--no moon, and the stars soon hid by the gathering clouds.\nMadame sat silent, and ruminating in her place, with her rugs about her.\nI, in my corner similarly enveloped, tried to keep awake. Madame plainly\nthought I was asleep already, for she stole a leather flask from her\npocket, and applied it to her lips, causing an aroma of brandy.\n\nBut it was vain struggling against the influence that was stealing over me,\nand I was soon in a profound and dreamless slumber.\n\nMadame awoke me at last, in a huge fuss. She had got out all our things and\nhurried them away to a close carriage which was awaiting us. It was still\ndark and starless. We got along the platform, I half asleep, the porter\ncarrying our rugs, by the glare of a pair of gas-jets in the wall, and out\nby a small door at the end.\n\nI remember that Madame, contrary to her wont, gave the man some money. By\nthe puzzling light of the carriage-lamps we got in and took our seats.\n\n'Go on,' screamed Madame, and drew up the window with a great chuck; and we\nwere enclosed in darkness and silence, the most favourable conditions for\nthought.\n\nMy sleep had not restored me as it might; I felt feverish, fatigued, and\nstill very drowsy, though unable to sleep as I had done.\n\nI dozed by fits and starts, and lay awake, or half-awake, sometimes, not\nthinking but in a way imagining what kind of a place Dover would be; but\ntoo tired and listless to ask Madame any questions, and merely seeing the\nhedges, grey in the lamplight, glide backward into darkness, as I leaned\nback.\n\nWe turned off the main road, at right angles, and drew up.\n\n'Get down and poosh it, it is open,' screamed Madame from the window.\n\nA gate, I suppose, was thus passed; for when we resumed our brisk trot,\nMadame bawled across the carriage--\n\n'We are now in the 'otel grounds.'\n\nAnd so all again was darkness and silence, and I fell into another doze,\nfrom which, on waking, I found that we had come to a standstill, and Madame\nwas standing on the low step of an open door, paying the driver. She,\nherself, pulled her box and the bag in. I was too tired to care what had\nbecome of the rest of our luggage.\n\nI descended, glancing to the right and left, but there was nothing visible\nbut a patch of light from the lamps on a paved ground and on the wall.\n\nWe stepped into the hall or vestibule, and Madame shut the door, and I\nthought I heard the key turn in it. We were in total darkness.\n\n'Where are the lights, Madame--where are the people?' I asked, more awake\nthan I had been.\n\n''Tis pass three o'clock, cheaile, bote there is always light here.' She\nwas groping at the side; and in a moment more lighted a lucifer match, and\nso a bedroom candle.\n\nWe were in a flagged lobby, under an archway at the right, and at the left\nof which opened long flagged passages, lost in darkness; a winding stair,\nbarely wide enough to admit Madame, dragging her box, led upward under a\ndoorway, in a corner at the right.\n\n'Come, dear cheaile, take your bag; don't mind the rugs, they are safe\nenough.'\n\n'But where are we to go? There is no one!' I said, looking round in wonder.\nIt certainly was a strange reception at an hotel.\n\n'Never mind, my dear cheaile. They know me here, and I have always the same\nroom ready when I write for it. Follow me quaitely.'\n\nSo she mounted, carrying the candle. The stair was steep, and the march\nlong. We halted at the second landing, and entered a gaunt, grimy passage.\nAll the way up we had not heard a single sound of life, nor seen a human\nbeing, nor so much as passed a gaslight.\n\n'Viola! here 'tis, my dear old room. Enter, dearest Maud.'\n\nAnd so I did. The room was large and lofty, but shabby and dismal. There\nwas a tall four-post bed, with its foot beside the window, hung with\ndark-green curtains, of some plush or velvet texture, that looked like\na dusty pall. The remaining furniture was scant and old, and a ravelled\nsquare of threadbare carpet covered a patch of floor at the bedside. The\nroom was grim and large, and had a cold, vault-like atmosphere, as if\nlong uninhabited; but there were cinders in the grate and under it. The\nimperfect light of our mutton-fat candle made all this look still more\ncomfortless.\n\nMadame placed the candle on the chimneypiece, locked the door, and put the\nkey in her pocket.\n\n'I always do so in '_otel_' said she, with a wink at me.\n\nAnd, then with a long 'ha!' expressive of fatigue and relief, she threw\nherself into a chair.\n\n'So 'ere we are at last!' said she; 'I'm glad. _There's_ your bed, Maud.\n_Mine_ is in the dressing-room.'\n\nShe took the candle, and I went in with her. A shabby press bed, a\nchair, and table were all its furniture; it was rather a closet than a\ndressing-room, and had no door except that through which we had entered. So\nwe returned, and very tired, wondering, I sat down on the side of my bed\nand yawned.\n\n'I hope they will call us in time for the packet,' I said.\n\n'Oh yes, they never fail,' she answered, looking steadfastly on her box,\nwhich she was diligently uncording.\n\nUninviting as was my bed, I was longing to lie down in it; and having made\nthose ablutions which our journey rendered necessary, I at length lay\ndown, having first religiously stuck my talismanic pin, with the head of\nsealing-wax, into the bolster.\n\nNothing escaped the restless eye of Madame.\n\n'Wat is that, dear cheaile?' she enquired, drawing near and scrutinising\nthe head of the gipsy charm, which showed like a little ladybird newly\nlighted on the sheet.\n\n'Nothing--a charm--folly. Pray, Madame, allow me to go to sleep.'\n\nSo, with another look and a little twiddle between her finger and thumb,\nshe seemed satisfied; but, unhappily for me, she did not seem at all\nsleepy. She busied herself in unpacking and displaying over the back of the\nchair a whole series of London purchases--silk dresses, a shawl, a sort of\nlace demi-coiffure then in vogue, and a variety of other articles.\n\nThe vainest and most slammakin of women--the merest slut at home,\na milliner's lay figure out of doors--she had one square foot of\nlooking-glass upon the chimneypiece, and therein tried effects, and\nconjured up grotesque simpers upon her sinister and weary face.\n\nI knew that the sure way to prolong this worry was to express my uneasiness\nunder it, so I bore it as quietly as I could; and at last fell fast asleep\nwith the gaunt image of Madame, with a festoon of grey silk with a cerise\nstripe, pinched up in her finger and thumb, and smiling over her shoulder\nacross it into the little shaving-glass that stood on the chimney.\n\nI awoke suddenly in the morning, and sat up in my bed, having for a moment\nforgotten all about our travelling. A moment more, however, brought all\nback again.\n\n'Are we in time, Madame?'\n\n'For the packet?' she enquired, with one of her charming smiles, and\ncutting a caper on the floor. 'To be sure; you don't suppose they would\nforget. We have two hours yet to wait.'\n\n'Can we see the sea from the window?'\n\n'No, dearest cheaile; you will see't time enough.\n\n'I'd like to get up,' I said.\n\n'Time enough, my dear Maud; you are fatigued; are you sure you feel quite\nwell?'\n\n'Well enough to get up; I should be better, I think, out of bed.'\n\n'There is no hurry, you know; you need not even go by the next packet. Your\nuncle, he tell me, I may use my discretion.'\n\n'Is there any water?'\n\n'They will bring some.'\n\n'Please, Madame, ring the bell.'\n\nShe pulled it with alacrity. I afterwards learnt that it did not ring.\n\n'What has become of my gipsy pin?' I demanded, with an unaccountable\nsinking of the heart.\n\n'Oh! the little pin with the red top? maybe it 'as fall on the ground; we\nweel find when you get up.'\n\nI suspected that she had taken it merely to spite me. It would have been\nquite the thing she would have liked. I cannot describe to you how the loss\nof this little 'charm' depressed and excited me. I searched the bed; I\nturned over all the bed-clothes; I searched in and outside; at last I gave\nup.\n\n'How odious!' I cried; 'somebody has stolen it merely to vex me.'\n\nAnd, like a fool as I was, I threw myself on my face on the bed and wept,\npartly in anger, partly in dismay.\n\nAfter a time, however, this blew over. I had a hope of recovering it.\nIf Madame had stolen it, it would turn up yet. But in the meantime its\ndisappearance troubled me like an omen.\n\n'I am afraid, my dear cheaile, you are not very well. It is really very odd\nyou should make such fuss about a pin! Nobody would believe! Do you not\ntheenk it would be a good plan to take a your breakfast in your bed?\n\nShe continued to urge this point for some time. At last, however, having\nby this time quite recovered my self-command, and resolved to preserve\nostensibly fair terms with Madame, who could contribute so essentially to\nmake me wretched during the rest of my journey, and possibly to prejudice\nme very seriously on my arrival, I said quietly--\n\n'Well, Madame, I know it is very silly; but I had kept that foolish little\npin so long and so carefully, that I had grown quite fond of it; but I\nsuppose it is lost, and I must content myself, though I cannot laugh as you\ndo. So I will get up now, and dress.'\n\n'I think you will do well to get all the repose you can,' answered Madame;\n'but as you please,' she added, observing that I was getting up.\n\nSo soon as I had got some of my things on, I said--\n\n'Is there a pretty view from the window?'\n\n'No,' said Madame.\n\nI looked out and saw a dreary quadrangle of cut stone, in one side of which\nmy window was placed. As I looked a dream rose up before me.\n\n'This hotel,' I said, in a puzzled way. '_Is_ it a hotel? Why this is just\nlike--it _is_ the inner court of Bartram-Haugh!'\n\nMadame clapped her large hands together, made a fantastic _chass\u00c3\u00a9_ on the\nfloor, burst into a great nasal laugh like the scream of a parrot, and then\nsaid--\n\n'Well, dearest Maud, is not clever trick?'\n\nI was so utterly confounded that I could only stare about me in stupid\nsilence, a spectacle which renewed Madame's peals of laughter.\n\n'We are at Bartram-Haugh!' I repeated, in utter consternation. 'How was\nthis done?'\n\nI had no reply but shrieks of laughter, and one of those Walpurgis dances\nin which she excelled.\n\n'It is a mistake--is it? _What_ is it?'\n\n'All a mistake, of course. Bartram-Haugh, it is so like Dover, as all\nphilosophers know.'\n\nI sat down in total silence, looking out into the deep and dark enclosure,\nand trying to comprehend the reality and the meaning of all this.\n\n'Well, Madame, I suppose you will be able to satisfy my uncle of your\nfidelity and intelligence. But to me it seems that his money has been\nill-spent, and his directions anything but well observed.'\n\n'Ah, ha! Never mind; I think he will forgive me,' laughed Madame.\n\nHer tone frightened me. I began to think, with a vague but overpowering\nsense of danger, that she had acted under the Machiavellian directions of\nher superior.\n\n'You have brought me back, then, by my uncle's orders?'\n\n'Did I say so?'\n\n'No; but what you have said can have no other meaning, though I can't\nbelieve it. And why have I been brought here? What is the object of all\nthis duplicity and trick. I _will_ know. It is not possible that my uncle,\na gentleman and a kinsman, can be privy to so disreputable a manouvre.'\n\n'First you will eat your breakfast, dear Maud; next you can tell your story\nto your uncle, Monsieur Ruthyn; and then you shall hear what he thinks of\nmy so terrible misconduct. What nonsense, cheaile! Can you not think how\nmany things may 'appen to change a your uncle's plans? Is he not in danger\nto be arrest? Bah! You are cheaile still; you cannot have intelligence more\nthan a cheaile. Dress yourself, and I will order breakfast.'\n\nI could not comprehend the strategy which had been practised on me. Why had\nI been so shamelessly deceived? If it were decided that I should remain\nhere, for what imaginable reason had I been sent so far on my journey to\nFrance? Why had I been conveyed back with such mystery? Why was I removed\nto this uncomfortable and desolate room, on the same floor with the\napartment in which Charke had met his death, and with no window commanding\nthe front of the house, and no view but the deep and weed-choked court,\nthat looked like a deserted churchyard in a city?\n\n'I suppose I may go to my own room?' I said.\n\n'Not to-day, my dear cheaile, for it was all disarrange when we go 'way;\n'twill be ready again in two three days.'\n\n'Where is Mary Quince?' I asked.\n\n'Mary Quince!--she has follow us to France,' said Madame, making what in\nIreland they call a bull.\n\n'They are not sure where they will go or what will do for day or two more.\nI will go and get breakfast. Adieu for a moment.'\n\nMadame was out of the door as she said this, and I thought I heard the key\nturn in the lock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\n_A WELL-KNOWN FACE LOOKS IN_\n\n\nYou who have never experienced it can have no idea how angry and frightened\nyou become under the sinister insult of being locked into a room, as on\ntrying the door I found I was.\n\nThe key was in the lock; I could see it through the hole. I called after\nMadame, I shook at the solid oak-door, beat upon it with my hands, kicked\nit--but all to no purpose.\n\nI rushed into the next room, forgetting--if indeed I had observed it, that\nthere was no door from it upon the gallery. I turned round in an angry and\ndismayed perplexity, and, like prisoners in romances, examined the windows.\n\nI was shocked and affrighted on discovering in reality what they\noccasionally find--a series of iron bars crossing the window! They were\nfirmly secured in the oak woodwork of the window-frame, and each window\nwas, besides, so compactly screwed down that it could not open. This\nbedroom was converted into a prison. A momentary hope flashed on\nme--perhaps all the windows were secured alike! But it was no such thing:\nthese gaol-like precautions were confined to the windows to which I had\naccess.\n\nFor a few minutes I felt quite distracted; but I bethought me that I must\nnow, if ever, control my terrors and exert whatever faculties I possessed.\n\nI stood upon a chair and examined the oak-work. I thought I detected marks\nof new chiselling here and there. The screws, too, looked new; and they\nand the scars on the woodwork were freshly smeared over with some coloured\nstuff by way of disguise.\n\nWhile I was making these observations, I heard the key stealthily stirred.\nI suspect that Madame wished to surprise me. Her approaching step, indeed,\nwas seldom audible; she had the soft tread of the feline tribe.\n\nI was standing in the centre of the room confronting her when she entered.\n\n'Why did you lock the door, Madame?' I demanded.\n\nShe slipped in suddenly with an insidious smirk, and locked the door\nhastily.\n\n'Hish!' whispered Madame, raising her broad palm; and then screwing in her\ncheeks, she made an ogle over her shoulder in the direction of the passage.\n\n'Hish! be quiate, cheaile, weel you, and I weel tale you everything\npresently.'\n\nShe paused, with her ear laid to the door.\n\n'Now I can speak, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re; I weel tale a you there is bailiff in the\nhouse, two, three, four soche impertinent fallows! They have another as bad\nas themselve to make a leest of the furniture: we most keep them out of\nthese rooms, dear Maud.'\n\n'You left the key in the door on the outside,' I retorted; 'that was not to\nkeep them out, but me in, Madame.'\n\n'_Deed_ I leave the key in the door?' ejaculated Madame, with both hands\nraised, and such a genuine look of consternation as for a moment shook me.\n\nIt was the nature of this woman's deceptions that they often puzzled though\nthey seldom convinced me.\n\n'I re-ally think, Maud, all those so frequent changes and excite-ments they\nweel overturn my poor head.'\n\n'And the windows are secured with iron bars--what are they for?' I\nwhispered sternly, pointing with my finger at these grim securities.\n\n'That is for more a than forty years, when Sir Phileep Aylmer was to reside\nhere, and had this room for his children's nursery, and was afraid they\nshould fall out.'\n\n'But if you look you will find these bars have been put here very recently:\nthe screws and marks are quite new.'\n\n'_Eendeed!_' ejaculated Madame, with prolonged emphasis, in precisely the\nsame consternation. 'Why, my dear, they told a me down stair what I have\ntell a you, when I ask the reason! Late a me see.'\n\nAnd Madame mounted on a chair, and made her scrutiny with much curiosity,\nbut could not agree with me as to the very recent date of the carpentry.\n\nThere is nothing, I think, so exasperating as that sort of falsehood which\naffects not to see what is quite palpable.\n\n'Do you mean to say, Madame, that you really think those chisellings and\nscrews are forty years old?'\n\n'How can I tell, cheaile? What does signify whether it is forty or only\nfourteen years? Bah! we av other theeng to theenk about. Those villain men!\nI am glad to see bar and bolt, and lock and key, at least, to our room, to\nkeep soche faylows out!'\n\nAt that moment a knock came to the door, and Madame's nasal 'in moment'\nanswered promptly, and she opened the door, stealthily popping out her\nhead.\n\n'Oh, that is all right; go you long, no ting more, go way.'\n\n'Who's there?' I cried.\n\n'Hold a your tongue,' said Madame imperiously to the visitor, whose voice I\nfancied I recognised--'_go_ way.'\n\nOut slipped Madame again, locking the door; but this time she returned\nimmediately, bearing a tray with breakfast.\n\nI think she fancied that I would perhaps attempt to break away and escape;\nbut I had no such thought at that moment. She hastily set down the tray on\nthe floor at the threshold, locking the door as before.\n\nMy share of breakfast was a little tea; but Madame's digestion was seldom\ndisturbed by her sympathies, and she ate voraciously. During this process\nthere was a silence unusual in her company; but when her meal was ended she\nproposed a reconnaissance, professing much uncertainty as to whether my\nUncle had been arrested or not.\n\n'And in case the poor old gentleman be poot in what you call stone jug,\nwhere are _we_ to go my dear Maud--to Knowl or to Elverston? You must\ndirect.'\n\nAnd so she disappeared, turning the key in the door as before. It was an\nold custom of hers, locking herself in her room, and leaving the key in the\nlock; and the habit prevailed, for she left it there again.\n\nWith a heavy heart I completed my simple toilet, wondering all the while\nhow much of Madame's story might be false and how much, if any, true. Then\nI looked out upon the dingy courtyard below, in its deep damp shadow, and\nthought, 'How could an assassin have scaled that height in safety, and\nentered so noiselessly as not to awaken the slumbering gamester?' Then\nthere were the iron bars across my window. What a fool had I been to object\nto that security!\n\nI was labouring hard to reassure myself, and keep all ghastly suspicions at\narm's length. But I wished that my room had been to the front of the house,\nwith some view less dismal.\n\nLost in these ruminations of fear, as I stood at the window I was startled\nby the sound of a sharp tread on the lobby, and by the key turning in the\nlock of my door.\n\nIn a panic I sprang back into the corner, and stood with my eyes fixed\nupon the door. It opened a little, and the black head of Meg Hawkes was\nintroduced.\n\n'Oh, Meg!' I cried; 'thank God!'\n\n'I guessed'twas you, Miss Maud. I am feared, Miss.'\n\nThe miller's daughter was pale, and her eyes, I thought, were red and\nswollen.\n\n'Oh, Meg! for God's sake, what is it all?'\n\n'I darn't come in. The old un's gone down, and locked the cross-door, and\nleft me to watch. They think I care nout about ye, no more nor themselves.\nI donna know all, but summat more nor her. They tell her nout, she's so\ngi'n to drink; they say she's not safe, an' awful quarrelsome. I hear a\ndeal when fayther and Master Dudley be a-talkin' in the mill. They think,\ncomin' in an' out, I don't mind; but I put one think an' t'other together.\nAn' don't ye eat nor drink nout here, Miss; hide away this; it's black\nenough, but wholesome anyhow!' and she slipt a piece of a coarse loaf from\nunder her apron. '_Hide_ it mind. Drink nout but the water in the jug\nthere--it's clean spring.'\n\n'Oh, Meg! Oh, Meg! I know what you mean,' said I, faintly.\n\n'Ay, Miss, I'm feared they'll try it; they'll try to make away wi' ye\nsomehow. I'm goin' to your friends arter dark; I darn't try it no sooner.\nI'll git awa to Ellerston, to your lady-cousin, and I'll bring 'em back wi'\nme in a rin; so keep a good hairt, lass. Meg Hawkes will stan' to ye. Ye\nwere better to me than fayther and mother, and a';' and she clasped me\nround the waist, and buried her head in my dress; 'an I'll gie my life for\nye, darling, and if they hurt ye I'll kill myself.'\n\nShe recovered her sterner mood quickly--\n\n'Not a word, lass,' she said, in her old tone. 'Don't ye try to git\naway--they'll _kill_ ye--ye _can't_ do't. Leave a' to me. It won't be,\nwhatever it is, till two or three o'clock in the morning. I'll ha'e them a'\nhere long afore; so keep a brave heart--there's a darling.'\n\nI suppose she heard, or fancied she heard, a step approaching, for she\nsaid--\n\n'Hish!'\n\nHer pale wild face vanished, the door shut quickly and softly, and the key\nturned again in the lock.\n\nMeg, in her rude way, had spoken softly--almost under her breath; but no\nprophecy shrieked by the Pythoness ever thundered so madly in the ears of\nthe hearer. I dare say that Meg fancied I was marvellously little moved by\nher words. I felt my gaze grow intense, and my flesh and bones literally\nfreeze. She did not know that every word she spoke seemed to burst like a\nblaze in my brain. She had delivered her frightful warning, and told\nher story coarsely and bluntly, which, in effect, means distinctly and\nconcisely; and, I dare say, the announcement so made, like a quick bold\nincision in surgery, was more tolerable than the slow imperfect mangling,\nwhich falters and recedes and equivocates with torture. Madame was long\naway. I sat down at the window, and tried to appreciate my dreadful\nsituation. I was stupid--the imagery was all frightful; but I beheld it as\nwe sometimes see horrors--heads cut off and houses burnt--in a dream, and\nwithout the corresponding emotions. It did not seem as if all this were\nreally happening to me. I remember sitting at the window, and looking and\nblinking at the opposite side of the building, like a person unable but\nstriving to see an object distinctly, and every minute pressing my hand to\nthe side of my head and saying--\n\n'Oh, it won't be--it won't be--Oh no!--never!--it could not be!' And in\nthis stunned state Madame found me on her return.\n\nBut the valley of the shadow of death has its varieties of dread. The\n'horror of great darkness' is disturbed by voices and illumed by sights.\nThere are periods of incapacity and collapse, followed by paroxysms\nof active terror. Thus in my journey during those long hours I found\nit--agonies subsiding into lethargies, and these breaking again into\nfrenzy. I sometimes wonder how I carried my reason safely through the\nordeal.\n\nMadame locked the door, and amused herself with her own business, without\nminding me, humming little nasal snatches of French airs, as she smirked on\nher silken purchases displayed in the daylight. Suddenly it struck me that\nit was very dark, considering how early it was. I looked at my watch;\nit seemed to me a great effort of concentration to understand it. Four\no'clock, it said. Four o'clock! It would be dark at five--_night_ in one\nhour!\n\n'Madame, what o'clock is it? Is it evening?' I cried with my hand to my\nforehead, like a person puzzled.\n\n'Two three minutes past four. It had five minutes to four when I came\nupstairs,' answered she, without interrupting her examination of a piece of\ndarned lace which she was holding close to her eyes at the window.\n\n'Oh, Madame! _Madame!_ I'm frightened,' cried I, with a wild and piteous\nvoice, grasping her arm, and looking up, as shipwrecked people may their\nlast to heaven, into her inexorable eyes. Madame looked frightened too, I\nthought, as she stared into my face. At last she said, rather angrily, and\nshaking her arm loose--\n\n'What you mean, cheaile?'\n\n'Oh save me, Madame!--oh save me!--oh save me, Madame!' I pleaded, with the\nwild monotony of perfect terror, grasping and clinging to her dress, and\nlooking up, with an agonised face, into the eyes of that shadowy Atropos.\n\n'Save a you, indeed! Save! What _niaiserie_!'\n\n'Oh, Madame! Oh, _dear_ Madame! for God's sake, only get me away--get me\nfrom this, and I'll do everything you ask me all my life--I will--_indeed_,\nMadame, I will! Oh save me! save me! _save_ me!'\n\nI was clinging to Madame as to my guardian angel in my agony.\n\n'And who told you, cheaile, you are in any danger?' demanded Madame,\nlooking down on me with a black and witchlike stare.\n\n'I am, Madame--I am--in great danger! Oh, Madame, think of me--take pity on\nme! I have none to help me--there is no one but God and you!'\n\nMadame all this time viewed me with the same dismal stare, like a sorceress\nreading futurity in my face.\n\n'Well, maybe you are--how can I tell? Maybe your uncle is mad--maybe you\nare mad. You have been my enemy always--why should I care?'\n\nAgain I burst into wild entreaty, and, clasping her fast, poured forth my\nsupplications with the bitterness of death.\n\n'I have no confidence in you, little Maud; you are little rogue--petite\ntra\u00c3\u00aetresse! Reflect, if you can, how you 'av always treat Madame. You 'av\nattempt to ruin me--you conspire with the bad domestics at Knowl to destroy\nme--and you expect me here to take a your part! You would never listen to\nme--you 'ad no mercy for me--you join to hunt me away from your house like\nwolf. Well, what you expect to find me now? _Bah_!'\n\nThis terrific 'Bah!' with a long nasal yell of scorn, rang in my ears like\na clap of thunder.\n\n'I say you are mad, petite insolente, to suppose I should care for you more\nthan the poor hare it will care for the hound--more than the bird who has\nescape will love the oiseleur. I do not care--I ought not care. It is your\nturn to suffer. Lie down on your bed there, and suffer quaitely.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\n_SPICED CLARET_\n\n\nI did not lie down; but I despaired. I walked round and round the room,\nwringing my hands in utter distraction. I threw myself at the bedside on my\nknees. I could not pray; I could only shiver and moan, with hands clasped,\nand eyes of horror turned up to heaven. I think Madame was, in her\nmalignant way, perplexed. That some evil was intended me I am sure she was\npersuaded; but I dare say Meg Hawkes had said rightly in telling me that\nshe was not fully in their secrets.\n\nThe first paroxysm of despair subsided into another state. All at once my\nmind was filled with the idea of Meg Hawkes, her enterprise, and my chances\nof escape. There is one point at which the road to Elverston makes a short\nascent: there is a sudden curve there, two great ash-trees, with a roadside\nstile between, at the right side, covered with ivy. Driving back and\nforward, I did not recollect having particularly remarked this point in\nthe highway; but now it was before me, in the thin light of the thinnest\nsegment of moon, and the figure of Meg Hawkes, her back toward me, always\nascending towards Elverston. It was constantly the same picture--the same\nmotion without progress--the same dreadful suspense and impatience.\n\nI was now sitting on the side of the bed, looking wistfully across the\nroom. When I did not see Meg Hawkes, I beheld Madame darkly eyeing first\none then another point of the chamber, evidently puzzling over some\nproblem, and in one of her most savage moods--sometimes muttering to\nherself, sometimes protruding, and sometimes screwing up her great mouth.\n\nShe went into her own room, where she remained, I think, nearly ten\nminutes, and on her return there was that in the flash of her eyes, the\nglow of her face, and the peculiar fragrance that surrounded her, that\nshowed she had been partaking of her favourite restorative.\n\nI had not moved since she left my room.\n\nShe paused about the middle of the floor, and looked at me with what I can\nonly describe as her wild-beast stare.\n\n'You are a very secrete family, you Ruthyns--you are so coning. I hate the\nconing people. By my faith, I weel see Mr. Silas Ruthyn, and ask wat he\nmean. I heard him tell old Wyat that Mr. Dudley is gone away to-night. He\nshall tell me everything, or else I weel make echec et mat aussi vrai que\nje vis.'\n\nMadame's words had hardly ceased, when I was again watching Meg Hawkes on\nthe steep road, mounting, but never reaching, the top of the acclivity, on\nthe way to Elverston, and mentally praying that she might be brought\nsafely there. Vain prayer of an agonised heart! Meg's journey was already\nfrustrated: she was not to reach Elverston in time.\n\nMadame revisited her apartment, and returned, not, I think, improved in\ntemper. She walked about the room, hustling the scanty furniture hither and\nthither as she encountered it. She kicked her empty box out of her way,\nwith a horrid crash, and a curse in French. She strode and swaggered round\nthe room, muttering all the way, and turning the corners of her course with\na furious whisk. At last, out of the door she went. I think she fancied she\nhad not been sufficiently taken into confidence as to what was intended for\nme.\n\nIt was now growing late, and yet no succour! I was seized, I remember, with\na dreadful icy shivering.\n\nI was listening for signals of deliverance. At ever distant sound, half\nstifled with a palpitation, these sounds piercing my ear with a horrible\nand exaggerated distinctness--'Oh Meg!--Oh cousin Monica!--Oh come! Oh\nHeaven, have mercy!--Lord, have mercy!' I thought I heard a roaring and\njangle of voices. Perhaps it came from Uncle Silas's room. It might be the\ntipsy violence of Madame. It might--merciful Heaven!--be the arrival of\nfriends. I started to my feet; I listened, quivering with attention. Was\nit in my brain?--was it real? I was at the door, and it seemed to open of\nitself. Madame had forgotten to lock it; she was losing her head a little\nby this time. The key stood in the gallery door beyond; it too, was open.\nI fled wildly. There was a subsiding sound of voices in my uncle's room.\nI was, I know not how, on the lobby at the great stair-head outside my\nuncle's apartment. My hand was on the banisters, my foot on the first step,\nwhen below me and against the faint light that glimmered through the great\nwindow on the landing I saw a bulky human form ascending, and a voice said\n'Hush!' I staggered back, and at that instant fancied, with a thrill of\nconviction, I heard Lady Knollys's voice in Uncle Silas' room.\n\nI don't know how I entered the room; I was there like a ghost. I was\nfrightened at my own state.\n\nLady Knollys was not there--no one but Madame and my guardian.\n\nI can never forget the look that Uncle Silas fixed on me as he cowered,\nseemingly as appalled as I.\n\nI think I must have looked like a phantom newly risen from the grave.\n\n'What's that?--where do you come from?' whispered he.\n\n'Death! death!' was my whispered answer, as I froze with terror where I\nstood.\n\n'What does she mean?--what does all this mean?' said Uncle Silas,\nrecovering wonderfully, and turning with a withering sneer on Madame. 'Do\nyou think it right to disobey my plain directions, and let her run about\nthe house at this hour?'\n\n'Death! death! Oh, pray to God for you and me!' I whispered in the same\ndreadful tones.\n\nMy uncle stared strangely at me again; and after several horrible seconds,\nin which he seemed to have recovered himself, he said, sternly and coolly--\n\n'You give too much place to your imagination, niece. Your spirits are in an\nodd state--you ought to have advice.'\n\n'Oh, uncle, pity me! Oh, uncle, you are good! you're kind; you're kind\nwhen you think. You could not--you could not--could not! Oh, think of your\nbrother that was always so good to you! He sees me here. He sees us both.\nOh, save me, uncle--save me!--and I'll give up everything to you. I'll pray\nto God to bless you--I'll never forget your goodness and mercy. But don't\nkeep me in doubt. If I'm to go, oh, for God's sake, shoot me now!'\n\n'You were always odd, niece; I begin to fear you are insane,' he replied,\nin the same stern icy tone.\n\n'Oh, uncle--oh!--am I? Am I _mad_?'\n\n'I hope not; but you'll conduct yourself like a sane person if you wish to\nenjoy the privileges of one.'\n\nThen, with his finger pointing at me, he turned to Madame, and said, in a\ntone of suppressed ferocity--\n\n'What's the meaning of this?--why is she here?'\n\nMadame was gabbling volubly, but to me it was only a shrilly noise. My\nwhole soul was concentrated in my uncle, the arbiter of my life, before\nwhom I stood in the wildest agony of supplication.\n\nThat night was dreadful. The people I saw dizzily, made of smoke or shining\nvapour, smiling or frowning, I could have passed my hand through them. They\nwere evil spirits.\n\n'There's no ill intended you; by ---- there's none,' said my uncle, for\nthe first time violently agitated. 'Madame told you why we've changed your\nroom. You told her about the bailiffs, did not you? 'with a stamp of fury\nhe demanded of Madame, whose nasal roullades of talk were running on like a\naccompaniment all the time. She had told me indeed only a few hours since,\nand now it sounded to me like the echo of something heard a month ago or\nmore.\n\n'You can't go about the house, d--n it, with bailiffs in occupation. There\nnow--there's the whole thing. Get to your room, Maud, and don't vex me.\nThere's a good girl.'\n\nHe was trying to smile as he spoke these last words, and, with quavering\nsoft tones, to quiet me; but the old scowl was there, the smile was\ncorpse-like and contorted, and the softness of his tones was more dreadful\nthan another man's ferocity.\n\n'There, Madame, she'll go quite gently, and you can call if you want help.\nDon't let it happen again.'\n\n'Come, Maud,' said Madame, encircling but not hurting my arm with her grip;\n'let us go, my friend.'\n\nI did go, you will wonder, as well you may--as you may wonder at the\ndocility with which strong men walk through the press-room to the drop,\nand thank the people of the prison for their civility when they bid them\ngood-bye, and facilitate the fixing of the rope and adjusting of the cap.\nHave you never wondered that they don't make a last battle for life with\nthe unscrupulous energy of terror, instead of surrendering it so gently in\ncold blood, on a silent calculation, the arithmetic of despair?\n\nI went upstairs with Madame like a somnambulist. I rather quickened my\nstep as I drew near my room. I went in, and stood a phantom at the window,\nlooking into the dark quadrange. A thin glimmering crescent hung in the\nfrosty sky, and all heaven was strewn with stars. Over the steep roof at\nthe other side spread on the dark azure of the night this glorious blazonry\nof the unfathomable Creator. To me a dreadful scroll--inexorable eyes--the\ncloud of cruel witnesses looking down in freezing brightness on my prayers\nand agonies.\n\nI turned about and sat down, leaning my head upon my arms. Then suddenly I\nsat up, as for the first time the picture of Uncle Silas's littered\nroom, and the travelling bags and black boxes plied on the floor by his\ntable--the desk, hat-case, umbrella, coats, rugs, and mufflers, all ready\nfor a journey--reached my brain and suggested thought. The _mise en\nsc\u00c3\u00a8ne_ had remained in every detail fixed upon my retina; and how I\nwondered--'When is he going--how soon? Is he going to carry me away and\nplace me in a madhouse?'\n\n'Am I--am I mad?' I began to think. 'Is this all a dream, or is it real?'\n\nI remembered how a thin polite gentleman, with a tall grizzled head and a\nblack velvet waistcoat, came into the carriage on our journey, and said a\nfew words to me; how Madame whispered him something, and he murmured 'Oh!'\nvery gently, with raised eyebrows, and a glance at me, and thenceforward\nspoke no more to me, only to Madame, and at the next station carried his\nhat and other travelling chattels into another carriage. Had she told him I\nwas mad?\n\nThese horrid bars! Madame always with me! The direful hints that dropt from\nmy uncle! My own terrific sensations!--All these evidences revolved in my\nbrain, and presented themselves in turn like writings on a wheel of fire.\n\nThere came a knock to the door--\n\nOh, Meg! Was it she? No; old Wyat whispered Madame something about her\nroom.\n\nSo Madame re-entered, with a little silver tray and flagon in her hands,\nand a glass. Nothing came from Uncle Silas in ungentlemanlike fashion.\n\n'Drink, Maud,' said Madame, raising the cover, and evidently enjoying the\nfragrant steam.\n\nI could not. I might have done so had I been able to swallow anything--for\nI was too distracted to think of Meg's warning.\n\nMadame suddenly recollected her mistake of that evening, and tried the\ndoor; but it was duly locked. She took the key from her pocket and placed\nit in her breast.\n\n'You weel 'av these rooms to yourself, ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re. I shall sleep downstairs\nto-night.'\n\nShe poured out some of the hot claret into the glass abstractedly, and\ndrank it off.\n\n''Tis very good--I drank without theenk. Bote 'tis very good. Why don't you\ndrink some?'\n\n'I could not', I repeated. And Madame boldly helped herself.\n\n'Vary polite, certally, to Madame was it to send nothing at all for _hair_'\n(so she pronounced 'her'); 'bote is all same thing.' And so she ran on in\nher tipsy vein, which was loud and sarcastic, with a fierce laugh now and\nthen.\n\nAfterwards I heard that they were afraid of Madame, who was given to cross\npurposes, and violent in her cups. She had been noisy and quarrelsome\ndownstairs. She was under the delusion that I was to be conveyed away that\nnight to a remote and safe place, and she was to be handsomely compensated\nfor services and evidence to be afterwards given. She was not to be\ntrusted, however, with the truth. That was to be known but to three people\non earth.\n\nI never knew, but I believe that the spiced claret which Madame drank was\ndrugged. She was a person who could, I have been told, drink a great deal\nwithout exhibiting any change from it but an inflamed colour and furious\ntemper. I can only state for certain what I saw, and that was, that shortly\nafter she had finished the claret she laid down upon my bed, and, I now\nknow, fell asleep. I then thought she was _feigning_ sleep only, and that\nshe was really watching me.\n\nAbout an hour after this I suddenly heard a little _clink_ in the\nyard beneath. I peeped out, but saw nothing. The sound was repeated,\nhowever--sometimes more frequently, sometimes at long intervals. At last,\nin the deep shadow next the farther wall, I thought I could discover a\nfigure, sometimes erect, sometimes stooping and bowing toward the earth. I\ncould see this figure only in the rudest outline mingling with the dark.\n\nLike a thunderbolt it smote my brain. 'They are making my grave!'\n\nAfter the first dreadful stun I grew quite wild, and ran up and down the\nroom wringing my hands and gasping prayers to heaven. Then a calm stole\nover me--such a dreadful calm as I could fancy glide over one who floated\nin a boat under the shadow of the 'Traitor's Gate,' leaving life and hope\nand trouble behind.\n\nShortly after there came a very low tap at my door; then another, like a\ntiny post-knock. I could never understand why it was I made no answer. Had\nI done so, and thus shown that I was awake, it might have sealed my fate.\nI was standing in the middle of the floor staring at the door, which I\nexpected to see open, and admit I knew not what troop of spectres.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\n_THE HOUR OF DEATH_\n\n\nIt was a very still night and frosty. My candle had long burnt out. There\nwas still a faint moonlight, which fell in a square of yellow on the floor\nnear the window, leaving the rest of the room in what to an eye less\naccustomed than mine had become to that faint light would have been total\ndarkness. Now, I am sure, I heard a soft whispering outside my door. I knew\nthat I was in a state of siege! The crisis was come, and strange to say,\nI felt myself grow all at once resolute and self-possessed. It was not a\nsubsidence, however, of the dreadful excitement, but a sudden screwing-up\nof my nerves to a pitch such as I cannot describe.\n\nI suppose the people outside moved with great caution; and the perfect\nsolidity of the floor, which had not anywhere a creaking board in it,\nfavoured their noiseless movements. It was well for me that there were\nin the house three persons whom it was part of their plan to mystify\nrespecting my fate. This alone compelled the extreme caution of their\nproceedings. They suspected that I had placed furniture against the door,\nand were afraid to force it, lest a crash, a scream, perhaps a long and\nshrilly struggle, might follow.\n\nI remained for a space which I cannot pretend to estimate in the same\nposture, afraid to stir--afraid to move my eye from the door.\n\nA very peculiar grating sound above my head startled me from my\nwatch--something of the character of sawing, only more crunching, and with\na faint continued rumble in it--utterly inexplicable. It sounded over that\nportion of the roof which was farthest from the door, toward which I now\nglided; and as I took my stand under cover of the projecting angle of a\nclumsy old press that stood close by it, I perceived the room a little\ndarkened, and I saw a man descend and take his stand upon the window-stone.\nHe let go a rope, which, however, was still fast round his body, and\nemployed both his hands, with apparently some exertion, about something at\nthe side of the window, which in a moment more, in one mass, bars and all,\nswung noiselessly open, admitting the frosty night-air; and the man, whom\nI now distinctly saw to be Dudley Ruthyn, kneeled on the sill, and stept,\nafter a moment's listening, into the room. His foot made no sound upon the\nfloor; his head was bare, and he wore his usual short shooting-jacket.\n\nI cowered to the ground in my post of observation. He stood, as it\nseemed to me irresolutely for a moment, and then drew from his pocket an\ninstrument which I distinctly saw against the faint moonlight. Imagine a\nhammer, one end of which had been beaten out into a longish tapering spike,\nwith a handle something longer than usual. He drew stealthily to the\nwindow, and seemed to examine this hurriedly, and tested its strength with\na twist or two of his hand. And then he adjusted it very carefully in his\ngrasp, and made two or three little experimental picks with it in the air.\n\nI remained perfectly still, with a terrible composure, crouched in my\nhiding-place, my teeth clenched, and prepared to struggle like a tigress\nfor my life when discovered. I thought his next measure would be to light a\nmatch. I saw a lantern, I fancied, on the window-sill. But this was not his\nplan. He stole, in a groping way, which seemed strange to me, who could\ndistinguish objects in this light, to the side of my bed, the exact\nposition of which he evidently knew; he stooped over it. Madame was\nbreathing in the deep respiration of heavy sleep. Suddenly but softly he\nlaid, as it seemed to me, his left hand over her face, and nearly at the\nsame instant there came a scrunching blow; an unnatural shriek, beginning\nsmall and swelling for two or three seconds into a yell such as are\nimagined in haunted houses, accompanied by a convulsive sound, as of the\nmotion of running, and the arms drumming on the bed; and then another\nblow--and with a horrid gasp he recoiled a step or two, and stood perfectly\nstill. I heard a horrible tremor quivering through the joints and curtains\nof the bedstead--the convulsions of the murdered woman. It was a dreadful\nsound, like the shaking of a tree and rustling of leaves. Then once more\nhe steps to the side of the bed, and I heard another of those horrid\nblows--and silence--and another--and more silence--and the diabolical\nsurgery was ended. For a few seconds, I think, I was on the point of\nfainting; but a gentle stir outside the door, close to my ear, startled me,\nand proved that there had been a watcher posted outside. There was a little\ntapping at the door.\n\n'Who's that?' whispered Dudley, hoarsely.\n\n'A friend,' answered a sweet voice.\n\nAnd a key was introduced, the door quickly unlocked, and Uncle Silas\nentered. I saw that frail, tall, white figure, the venerable silver locks\nthat resembled those upon the honoured head of John Wesley, and his thin\nwhite hand, the back of which hung so close to my face that I feared to\nbreathe. I could see his fingers twitching nervously. The smell of perfumes\nand of ether entered the room with him.\n\nDudley was trembling now like a man in an ague-fit.\n\n'Look what you made me do!' he said, maniacally.\n\n'Steady, sir!' said the old man, close beside me.\n\n'Yes, you damned old murderer! I've a mind to do for you.'\n\n'There, Dudley, like a dear boy, don't give way; it's done. Right or wrong,\nwe can't help it. You must be quiet,' said the old man, with a stern\ngentleness.\n\nDudley groaned.\n\n'Whoever advised it, you're a gainer, Dudley,' said Uncle Silas.\n\nThen there was a pause.\n\n'I hope that was not heard,' said Uncle Silas.\n\nDudley walked to the window and stood there.\n\n'Come, Dudley, you and Hawkes must use expedition. You know you must get\nthat out of the way.'\n\n'I've done too much. I won't do nout; I'll not touch it. I wish my hand was\noff first; I wish I was a soger. Do as ye like, you an' Hawkes. I won't go\nnigh it; damn ye both--and _that_!' and he hurled the hammer with all his\nforce upon the floor.\n\n'Come, come, be reasonable, Dudley, dear boy. There's nothing to fear but\nyour own folly. You won't make a noise?'\n\n'Oh, oh, my God!' said Dudley, hoarsely, and wiped his forehead with his\nopen hand.\n\n'There now, you'll be all well in a minute,' continued the old man.\n\n'You said 'twouldn't hurt her. If I'd a known she'd a screeched like that\nI'd never a done it. 'Twas a damn lie. You're the damndest villain on\nearth.'\n\n'Come, Dudley!' said the old man under his breath, but very sternly, 'make\nup your mind. If you don't choose to go on, it can't be helped; only it's\na pity you began. For _you_ it is a good deal--it does not much matter for\n_me_.'\n\n'Ay, for _you_!' echoed Dudley, through his set teeth. 'The old talk!'\n\n'Well, sir,' snarled the old man, in the same low tones, 'you should have\nthought of all this before. It's only taking leave of the world a year or\ntwo sooner, but a year or two's something. I'll leave you to do as you\nplease.'\n\n'Stop, will you? Stop here. I know it's a fixt thing now. If a fella does\na thing he's damned for, you might let him talk a bit anyhow. I don't care\nmuch if I was shot.'\n\n'There now--_there_--just stick to that, and don't run off again. There's a\nbox and a bag here; we must change the direction, and take them away. The\nbox has some jewels. Can you see them? I wish we had a light.'\n\n'No, I'd rayther not; I can see well enough. I wish we were out o' this.\n_Here's_ the box.'\n\n'Pull it to the window,' said the old man, to my inexpressible relief\nadvancing at last a few steps.\n\nCoolness was given me in that dreadful moment, and I knew that all depended\non my being prompt and resolute. I stood up swiftly. I often thought if I\nhad happened to wear silk instead of the cachmere I had on that night, its\nrustle would have betrayed me.\n\nI distinctly saw the tall stooping figure of my uncle, and the outline of\nhis venerable tresses, as he stood between me and the dull light of the\nwindow, like a shape cut in card.\n\nHe was saying 'just to _there_,' and pointing with his long arm at that\ncontracting patch of moonlight which lay squared upon the floor. The door\nwas about a quarter open, and just as Dudley began to drag Madame's heavy\nbox, with my jewel-case in it, across the floor from her room, inhaling a\ngreat breath--with a mental prayer for help--I glided on tiptoe from the\nroom and found myself on the gallery floor.\n\nI turned to my right, simply by chance, and followed a long gallery in the\ndark, not running--I was too fearful of making the least noise--but walking\nwith the tiptoe-swiftness of terror. At the termination of this was a\ncross-gallery, one end of which--that to my left--terminated in a great\nwindow, through which the dusky night-view was visible. With the instinct\nof terror I chose the darker, and turned again to my right; hurrying\nthrough this long and nearly dark passage, I was terrified by a light,\nabout thirty feet before me, emerging from the ceiling. In spotted patches\nthis light fell through the door and sides of a stable lantern, and showed\nme a ladder, down which, from an open skylight I suppose for the cool\nnight-air floated in my face, came Dickon Hawkes notwithstanding his\nmaimed condition, with so much celerity as to leave me hardly a moment for\nconsideration.\n\nHe sat on the last round of the ladder, and tightened the strap of his\nwooden leg.\n\nAt my left was a door-case open, but no door. I entered; it was a short\npassage about six feet long, leading perhaps to a backstair, but the door\nat the end was locked.\n\nI was forced to stand in this recess, then, which afforded no shelter,\nwhile Pegtop stumped by with his lantern in his hand. I fancy he had some\nidea of listening to his master unperceived, for he stopped close to my\nhiding-place, blew out the candle, and pinched the long snuff with his\nhorny finger and thumb.\n\nHaving listened for a few seconds, he stumped stealthily along the gallery\nwhich I had just traversed, and turned the corner in the direction of the\nchamber where the crime had just been committed, and the discovery was\nimpending. I could see him against the broad window which in the daytime\nlighted this long passage, and the moment he had passed the corner I\nresumed my flight.\n\nI descended a stair corresponding with that backstair, as I am told, up\nwhich Madame had led me only the night before. I tried the outer door. To\nmy wild surprise it was open. In a moment I was upon the step, in the free\nair, and as instantaneously was seized by the arm in the gripe of a man.\n\nIt was Tom Brice, who had already betrayed me, and who was now, in surtout\nand hat, waiting to drive the carriage with the guilty father and son from\nthe scene of their abhorred outrage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\n_IN THE OAK PARLOUR_\n\n\nSo it was vain: I was trapped, and all was over.\n\nI stood before him on the step, the white moon shining on my face. I was\ntrembling so that I wonder I could stand, my helpless hands raised towards\nhim, and I looked up in his face. A long shuddering moan--'Oh--oh--oh!' was\nall I uttered.\n\nThe man, still holding my arm, looked, I thought frightened, into my white\ndumb face.\n\nSuddenly he said, in a wild, fierce whisper--\n\n'Never say another word' (I had not uttered one). 'They shan't hurt ye,\nMiss; git ye in; I don't care a damn!'\n\nIt was an uncouth speech. To me it was the voice of an angel. With a burst\nof gratitude that sounded in my own ears like a laugh, I thanked God for\nthose blessed words.\n\nIn a moment more he had placed me in the carriage, and almost instantly we\nwere in motion--very cautiously while crossing the court, until he had got\nthe wheels upon the grass, and then at a rapid pace, improving his speed as\nthe distance increased. He drove along the side of the back-approach to the\nhouse, keeping on the grass; so that our progress, though swaying like that\nof a ship in a swell, was very nearly as noiseless.\n\nThe gate had been left unlocked--he swung it open, and remounted the box.\nAnd we were now beyond the spell of Bartram-Haugh, thundering--Heaven be\npraised!--along the Queen's highway, right in the route to Elverston. It\nwas literally a gallop. Through the chariot windows I saw Tom stand as he\ndrove, and every now and then throw an awful glance over his shoulder. Were\nwe pursued? Never was agony of prayer like mine, as with clasped hands and\nwild stare I gazed through the windows on the road, whose trees and hedges\nand gabled cottages were chasing one another backward at so giddy a speed.\n\nWe were now ascending that identical steep, with the giant ash-trees at the\nright and the stile between, which my vision of Meg Hawkes had presented\nall that night, when my excited eye detected a running figure within the\nhedge. I saw the head of some one crossing the stile in pursuit, and I\nheard Brice's name shrieked.\n\n'Drive on--on--on!' I screamed.\n\nBut Brice pulled up. I was on my knees on the floor of the carriage, with\nclasped hands, expecting capture, when the door opened, and Meg Hawkes,\npale as death, her cloak drawn over her black tresses, looked in.\n\n'Oh!--ho!--ho!--thank God!' she screamed. 'Shake hands, lass. Tom, yer a\ngood un! He's a good lad, Tom.'\n\n'Come in, Meg--you must sit by me,' I said, recovering all at once.\n\nMeg made no demur. 'Take my hand,' I said offering mine to her disengaged\none.\n\n'I can't, Miss--my arm's broke.'\n\nAnd so it was, poor thing! She had been espied and overtaken in her errand\nof mercy for me, and her ruffian father had felled her with his cudgel, and\nthen locked her into the cottage, whence, however, she had contrived to\nescape, and was now flying to Elverston, having tried in vain to get a\nhearing in Feltram, whose people had been for hours in bed.\n\nThe door being shut upon Meg, the steaming horses were instantly at a\ngallop again.\n\nTom was still watching as before, with many an anxious glance to rearward,\nfor pursuit. Again he pulled up, and came to the window.\n\n'Oh, what is it?' cried I.\n\n''Bout that letter, Miss; I couldn't help. 'Twas Dickon, he found it in my\npocket. That's a'.'\n\n'Oh yes!--no matter--thank you--thank Heaven! Are we near Elverston?'\n\n''Twill be a mile, Miss: and please'm to mind I had no finger in't.'\n\n'Thanks--thank you--you're very good--I shall _always_ thank you, Tom, as\nlong as I live!'\n\nAt length we entered Elverston. I think I was half wild. I don't know how I\ngot into the hall. I was in the oak-parlour, I believe, when I saw cousin\nMonica. I was standing, my arms extended. I could not speak; but I ran with\na loud long scream into her arms. I forget a great deal after that.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOh, my beloved cousin Monica! Thank Heaven, you are living still, and\nyounger, I think, than I in all things but in years.\n\nAnd Milly, my dear companion, she is now the happy wife of that good little\nclergyman, Sprigge Biddlepen. It has been in my power to be of use to them,\nand he shall have the next presentation to Dawling.\n\nMeg Hawkes, proud and wayward, and the most affectionate creature on earth,\nwas married to Tom Brice a few months after these events; and, as both\nwished to emigrate, I furnished them with the capital, and I am told they\nare likely to be rich. I hear from my kind Meg often, and she seems very\nhappy.\n\nMy dear old friends, Mary Quince and Mrs. Rusk, are, alas! growing old, but\nliving with me, and very happy. And after long solicitation, I persuaded\nDoctor Bryerly, the best and truest of ministers, with my dearest friend's\nconcurrence, to undertake the management of the Derbyshire estates. In this\nI have been most fortunate. He is the very person for such a charge--so\npunctual, so laborious, so kind, and so shrewd.\n\nIn compliance with medical advice, cousin Monica hurried me away to the\nContinent, where she would never permit me to allude to the terrific scenes\nwhich remain branded so awfully on my brain. It needed no constraint. It is\na sort of agony to me even now to think of them.\n\nThe plan was craftily devised. Neither old Wyat nor Giles, the butler, had\na suspicion that I had returned to Bartram. Had I been put to death, the\nsecret of my fate would have been deposited in the keeping of four persons\nonly--the two Ruthyns, Hawkes, and ultimately Madame. My dear cousin Monica\nhad been artfully led to believe in my departure for France, and prepared\nfor my silence. Suspicion might not have been excited for a year after my\ndeath, and then would never, in all probability, have pointed to Bartram as\nthe scene of the crime. The weeds would have grown over me, and I should\nhave lain in that deep grave where the corpse of Madame de la Rougierre was\nunearthed in the darksome quadrangle of Bartram-Haugh.\n\nIt was more than two years after that I heard what had befallen at Bartram\nafter my flight. Old Wyat, who went early to Uncle Silas's room, to her\nsurprise--for he had told her that he was that night to accompany his son,\nwho had to meet the mailtrain to Derby at five o'clock in the morning--saw\nher old master lying on the sofa, much in his usual position.\n\n'There was nout much strange about him,' old Wyat said, 'but that his\nscent-bottle was spilt on its side over on the table, and he dead.'\n\nShe thought he was not quite cold when she found him, and she sent the old\nbutler for Doctor Jolks, who said he died of too much 'loddlum.'\n\nOf my wretched uncle's religion what am I to say? Was it utter hypocrisy,\nor had it at any time a vein of sincerity in it? I cannot say. I don't\nbelieve that he had any heart left for religion, which is the highest form\nof affection, to take hold of. Perhaps he was a sceptic with misgivings\nabout the future, but past the time for finding anything reliable in it.\nThe devil approached the citadel of his heart by stealth, with many zigzags\nand parallels. The idea of marrying me to his son by fair means, then by\nfoul, and, when that wicked chance was gone, then the design of seizing all\nby murder, supervened. I dare say that Uncle Silas thought for a while that\nhe was a righteous man. He wished to have heaven and to escape hell, if\nthere were such places. But there were other things whose existence was\nnot speculative, of which some he coveted, and some he dreaded more, and\ntemptation came. 'Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver,\nprecious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made\nmanifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by\nfire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.' There\ncomes with old age a time when the heart is no longer fusible or malleable,\nand must retain the form in which it has cooled down. 'He that is unjust,\nlet him be unjust still; he which is filthy, let him be filthy still.'\n\nDudley had disappeared; but in one of her letters, Meg, writing from her\nAustralian farm, says: 'There's a fella in toon as calls hisself Colbroke,\nwi' a good hoose o' wood, 15 foot length, and as by 'bout as silling o' the\npearler o' Bartram--only lots o' rats, they do say, my lady--a bying and\nsellin' of goold back and forred wi' the diggin foke and the marchants. His\nchick and mouth be wry wi' scar o' burns or vitterel, an' no wiskers, bless\nyou; but my Tom ee toll him he knowed him for Master Doodley. I ant seed\nhim; but he sade ad shute Tom soon is look at 'im, an' denide it, wi'\nmouthful o' curses and oaf. Tom baint right shure; if I seed un wons i'd no\nfor sartin; but 'appen,'twil best be let be.' This was all.\n\nOld Hawkes stood his ground, relying on the profound cunning with which\ntheir actual proceedings had been concealed, even from the suspicions of\nthe two inmates of the house, and on the mystery that habitually shrouded\nBartram-Haugh and all its belongings from the eyes of the outer world.\n\nStrangely enough, he fancied that I had made my escape long before the room\nwas entered; and, even if he were arrested, there was no evidence, he was\ncertain, to connect _him_ with the murder, all knowledge of which he would\nstoutly deny.\n\nThere was an inquest on the body of my uncle, and Dr. Jolks was the chief\nwitness. They found that his death was caused by 'an excessive dose of\nlaudanum, accidentally administered by himself.'\n\nIt was not until nearly a year after the dreadful occurrences at Bartram\nthat Dickon Hawkes was arrested on a very awful charge, and placed in gaol.\nIt was an old crime, committed in Lancashire, that had found him out.\nAfter his conviction, as a last chance, he tried a disclosure of all the\ncircumstances of the unsuspected death of the Frenchwoman. Her body was\ndiscovered buried where he indicated, in the inner court of Bartram-Haugh,\nand, after due legal enquiry, was interred in the churchyard of Feltram.\n\nThus I escaped the horrors of the witness-box, or the far worse torture of\na dreadful secret.\n\nDoctor Bryerly, shortly after Lady Knollys had described to him the manner\nin which Dudley entered my room, visited the house of Bartram-Haugh, and\nminutely examined the windows of the room in which Mr. Charke had slept on\nthe night of his murder. One of these he found provided with powerful steel\nhinges, very craftily sunk and concealed in the timber of the window-frame,\nwhich was secured by an iron pin outside, and swung open on its removal.\nThis was the room in which they had placed me, and this the contrivance\nby means of which the room had been entered. The problem of Mr. Charke's\nmurder was solved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have penned it. I sit for a moment breathless. My hands are cold and\ndamp. I rise with a great sigh, and look out on the sweet green landscape\nand pastoral hills, and see the flowers and birds and the waving boughs of\nglorious trees--all images of liberty and safety; and as the tremendous\nnightmare of my youth melts into air, I lift my eyes in boundless gratitude\nto the God of all comfort, whose mighty hand and outstretched arm delivered\nme. When I lower my eyes and unclasp my hands, my cheeks are wet with\ntears. A tiny voice is calling me 'Mamma!' and a beloved smiling face, with\nhis dear father's silken brown tresses, peeps in.\n\n'Yes, darling, our walk. Come away!'\n\nI am Lady Ilbury, happy in the affection of a beloved and noblehearted\nhusband. The shy useless girl you have known is now a mother--trying to be\na good one; and this, the last pledge, has lived.\n\nI am not going to tell of sorrows--how brief has been my pride of early\nmaternity, or how beloved were those whom the Lord gave and the Lord has\ntaken away. But sometimes as, smiling on my little boy, the tears gather\nin my eyes, and he wonders, I can see, why they come, I am thinking--and\ntrembling while I smile--to think, how strong is love, how frail is life;\nand rejoicing while I tremble that, in the deathless love of those who\nmourn, the Lord of Life, who never gave a pang in vain, conveys the sweet\nand ennobling promise of a compensation by eternal reunion. So, through\nmy sorrows, I have heard a voice from heaven say, 'Write, from hencefore\nblessed are the dead that die in the Lord!'\n\nThis world is a parable--the habitation of symbols--the phantoms of\nspiritual things immortal shown in material shape. May the blessed\nsecond-sight be mine--to recognise under these beautiful forms of earth the\nANGELS who wear them; for I am sure we may walk with them if we will, and\nhear them speak!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Uncle Silas, by J.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1182,"split":"test"}
