There Rupert tries to win the trust of the conservative mountaineer population by using his fortune to buy them modern arms (from a South American country that has unexpectedly found itself at peace) for their fight against Turkish invasion (the story was written shortly before the Balkan Wars). One wet night, he is visited in his room in the castle by a pale woman wearing a wet shroud, seeking warmth. He lets her dry herself before his fire, and she flees before morning. She visits several more times, all at night, and they hardly speak, but he falls in love with her, despite thinking she is a vampire. He visits the local church and finds her in a glass-topped stone coffin in the crypt. Despite misgivings he declares his love, be she living or undead, and she arranges the marriage in an Orthodox ceremony conducted by candlelight in the church one night, although he still does not know her name, and she says she must still live alone in the crypt for the present.\nSoon afterwards, she is kidnapped by a forward party of Turkish troops, and he learns that she, Teuta, is not undead, but the living daughter of the local Voivode, who is currently returning from a visit to America. She had fallen into a trance, and was declared dead, but then revived, and the local leaders and clergy spread a story of vampirism which was more acceptable, after the (mistaken) news of her death, to the uneducated locals than the truth. Living up to this story, she had spent her days in the coffin in the crypt, but during heavy rain when the crypt flooded, came out seeking warmth in the castle in which she had grown up, and knew all the secret entrances, and hence her meetings with Rupert behind locked gates.\nRupert leads a relief force which kills her kidnappers and rescues her. But news immediately arrives that the Voivode has just returned to the country only to be kidnapped by Turks himself. They race back to the coast, and Rupert unloads an aeroplane with a near-silent engine from the munitions ship which has also just arrived, along with sets of bullet-proof clothes. The kidnapped Voivode is tracked to a nearby castle ruin, and Rupert pilots the plane onto the castle wall as if it were a balloon or dirigible, lowers Teuta by rope to her father. He dons a set of the bullet proof clothes which Teuta and Rupert are also wearing, and Rupert hauls both up to the aircraft which he silently flies off. The castle is then attacked by local troops and the Turks defeated.\nTeuta subsequently reveals her marriage to Rupert to her father, who welcomes him into the family, and the country.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Lady of the Shroud, by Bram Stoker\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It appears that on the night of\nthe 9th, as the Italia Steamship Company's vessel \"Victorine\" was passing\na little before midnight the point known as \"the Spear of Ivan,\" on the\ncoast of the Blue Mountains, the attention of the Captain, then on the\nbridge, was called by the look-out man to a tiny floating light close\ninshore.  It is the custom of some South-going ships to run close to the\nSpear of Ivan in fine weather, as the water is deep, and there is no\nsettled current; also there are no outlying rocks.  Indeed, some years\nago the local steamers had become accustomed to hug the shore here so\nclosely that an intimation was sent from Lloyd's that any mischance under\nthe circumstances would not be included in ordinary sea risks.  Captain\nMirolani is one of those who insist on a wholesome distance from the\npromontory being kept; but on his attention having been called to the\ncircumstance reported, he thought it well to investigate it, as it might\nbe some case of personal distress.  Accordingly, he had the engines\nslowed down, and edged cautiously in towards shore.  He was joined on the\nbridge by two of his officers, Signori Falamano and Destilia, and by one\npassenger on board, Mr. Peter Caulfield, whose reports of Spiritual\nPhenomena in remote places are well known to the readers of \"The Journal\nof Occultism.\"  The following account of the strange occurrence written\nby him, and attested by the signatures of Captain Mirolani and the other\ngentleman named, has been sent to us.\n\n\" . . . It was eleven minutes before twelve midnight on Saturday, the 9th\nday of January, 1907, when I saw the strange sight off the headland known\nas the Spear of Ivan on the coast of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  It\nwas a fine night, and I stood right on the bows of the ship, where there\nwas nothing to obstruct my view.  We were some distance from the Spear of\nIvan, passing from northern to southern point of the wide bay into which\nit projects.  Captain Mirolani, the Master, is a very careful seaman, and\ngives on his journeys a wide berth to the bay which is tabooed by\nLloyd's.  But when he saw in the moonlight, though far off, a tiny white\nfigure of a woman drifting on some strange current in a small boat, on\nthe prow of which rested a faint light (to me it looked like a\ncorpse-candle!), he thought it might be some person in distress, and\nbegan to cautiously edge towards it.  Two of his officers were with him\non the bridge--Signori Falamano and Destilia.  All these three, as well\nas myself, saw It.  The rest of the crew and passengers were below.  As\nwe got close the true inwardness of It became apparent to me; but the\nmariners did not seem to realize till the very last.  This is, after all,\nnot strange, for none of them had either knowledge or experience in\nOccult matters, whereas for over thirty years I have made a special study\nof this subject, and have gone to and fro over the earth investigating to\nthe nth all records of Spiritual Phenomena.  As I could see from their\nmovements that the officers did not comprehend that which was so apparent\nto myself, I took care not to enlighten them, lest such should result in\nthe changing of the vessel's course before I should be near enough to\nmake accurate observation.  All turned out as I wished--at least, nearly\nso--as shall be seen.  Being in the bow, I had, of course, a better view\nthan from the bridge.   Presently I made out that the boat, which had all\nalong seemed to be of a queer shape, was none other than a _Coffin_, and\nthat the woman standing up in it was clothed in a shroud.  Her back was\ntowards us, and she had evidently not heard our approach.  As we were\ncreeping along slowly, the engines were almost noiseless, and there was\nhardly a ripple as our fore-foot cut the dark water.  Suddenly there was\na wild cry from the bridge--Italians are certainly very excitable; hoarse\ncommands were given to the Quartermaster at the wheel; the engine-room\nbell clanged.  On the instant, as it seemed, the ship's head began to\nswing round to starboard; full steam ahead was in action, and before one\ncould understand, the Apparition was fading in the distance.  The last\nthing I saw was the flash of a white face with dark, burning eyes as the\nfigure sank down into the coffin--just as mist or smoke disappears under\na breeze.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I: THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON\n\n\nThe Reading of the Will of Roger Melton and all that Followed\n\n\nRecord made by Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, law-student of the Inner\nTemple, eldest son of Ernest Halbard Melton, eldest son of Ernest Melton,\nelder brother of the said Roger Melton and his next of kin.\n\nI consider it at least useful--perhaps necessary--to have a complete and\naccurate record of all pertaining to the Will of my late grand-uncle\nRoger Melton.\n\nTo which end let me put down the various members of his family, and\nexplain some of their occupations and idiosyncrasies.  My father, Ernest\nHalbard Melton, was the only son of Ernest Melton, eldest son of Sir\nGeoffrey Halbard Melton of Humcroft, in the shire of Salop, a Justice of\nthe Peace, and at one time Sheriff.  My great-grandfather, Sir Geoffrey,\nhad inherited a small estate from his father, Roger Melton.  In his time,\nby the way, the name was spelled Milton; but my great-great-grandfather\nchanged the spelling to the later form, as he was a practical man not\ngiven to sentiment, and feared lest he should in the public eye be\nconfused with others belonging to the family of a Radical person called\nMilton, who wrote poetry and was some sort of official in the time of\nCromwell, whilst we are Conservatives.  The same practical spirit which\noriginated the change in the spelling of the family name inclined him to\ngo into business.  So he became, whilst still young, a tanner and\nleather-dresser.  He utilized for the purpose the ponds and streams, and\nalso the oak-woods on his estate--Torraby in Suffolk.  He made a fine\nbusiness, and accumulated a considerable fortune, with a part of which he\npurchased the Shropshire estate, which he entailed, and to which I am\ntherefore heir-apparent.\n\nSir Geoffrey had, in addition to my grandfather, three sons and a\ndaughter, the latter being born twenty years after her youngest brother.\nThese sons were: Geoffrey, who died without issue, having been killed in\nthe Indian Mutiny at Meerut in 1857, at which he took up a sword, though\na civilian, to fight for his life; Roger (to whom I shall refer\npresently); and John--the latter, like Geoffrey, dying unmarried.  Out of\nSir Geoffrey's family of five, therefore, only three have to be\nconsidered: My grandfather, who had three children, two of whom, a son\nand a daughter, died young, leaving only my father, Roger and Patience.\nPatience, who was born in 1858, married an Irishman of the name of\nSellenger--which was the usual way of pronouncing the name of St. Leger,\nor, as they spelled it, Sent Leger--restored by later generations to the\nstill older form.  He was a reckless, dare-devil sort of fellow, then a\nCaptain in the Lancers, a man not without the quality of bravery--he won\nthe Victoria Cross at the Battle of Amoaful in the Ashantee Campaign.\nBut I fear he lacked the seriousness and steadfast strenuous purpose\nwhich my father always says marks the character of our own family.  He\nran through nearly all of his patrimony--never a very large one; and had\nit not been for my grand-aunt's little fortune, his days, had he lived,\nmust have ended in comparative poverty.  Comparative, not actual; for the\nMeltons, who are persons of considerable pride, would not have tolerated\na poverty-stricken branch of the family.  We don't think much of that\nlot--any of us.\n\nFortunately, my great-aunt Patience had only one child, and the premature\ndecease of Captain St. Leger (as I prefer to call the name) did not allow\nof the possibility of her having more.  She did not marry again, though\nmy grandmother tried several times to arrange an alliance for her.  She\nwas, I am told, always a stiff, uppish person, who would not yield\nherself to the wisdom of her superiors.  Her own child was a son, who\nseemed to take his character rather from his father's family than from my\nown.  He was a wastrel and a rolling stone, always in scrapes at school,\nand always wanting to do ridiculous things.  My father, as Head of the\nHouse and his own senior by eighteen years, tried often to admonish him;\nbut his perversity of spirit and his truculence were such that he had to\ndesist.  Indeed, I have heard my father say that he sometimes threatened\nhis life.  A desperate character he was, and almost devoid of reverence.\nNo one, not even my father, had any influence--good influence, of course,\nI mean--over him, except his mother, who was of my family; and also a\nwoman who lived with her--a sort of governess--aunt, he called her.  The\nway of it was this: Captain St. Leger had a younger brother, who made an\nimprovident marriage with a Scotch girl when they were both very young.\nThey had nothing to live on except what the reckless Lancer gave them,\nfor he had next to nothing himself, and she was \"bare\"--which is, I\nunderstand, the indelicate Scottish way of expressing lack of fortune.\nShe was, however, I understand, of an old and somewhat good family,\nthough broken in fortune--to use an expression which, however, could\nhardly be used precisely in regard to a family or a person who never had\nfortune to be broken in!  It was so far well that the MacKelpies--that\nwas the maiden name of Mrs. St. Leger--were reputable--so far as fighting\nwas concerned.  It would have been too humiliating to have allied to our\nfamily, even on the distaff side, a family both poor and of no account.\nFighting alone does not make a family, I think.  Soldiers are not\neverything, though they think they are.  We have had in our family men\nwho fought; but I never heard of any of them who fought because they\n_wanted_ to.  Mrs. St. Leger had a sister; fortunately there were only\nthose two children in the family, or else they would all have had to be\nsupported by the money of my family.\n\nMr. St. Leger, who was only a subaltern, was killed at Maiwand; and his\nwife was left a beggar.  Fortunately, however, she died--her sister\nspread a story that it was from the shock and grief--before the child\nwhich she expected was born.  This all happened when my cousin--or,\nrather, my father's cousin, my first-cousin-once-removed, to be\naccurate--was still a very small child.  His mother then sent for Miss\nMacKelpie, her brother-in-law's sister-in-law, to come and live with her,\nwhich she did--beggars can't be choosers; and she helped to bring up\nyoung St. Leger.\n\nI remember once my father giving me a sovereign for making a witty remark\nabout her.  I was quite a boy then, not more than thirteen; but our\nfamily were always clever from the very beginning of life, and father was\ntelling me about the St. Leger family.  My family hadn't, of course, seen\nanything of them since Captain St. Leger died--the circle to which we\nbelong don't care for poor relations--and was explaining where Miss\nMacKelpie came in.  She must have been a sort of nursery governess, for\nMrs. St. Leger once told him that she helped her to educate the child.\n\n\"Then, father,\" I said, \"if she helped to educate the child she ought to\nhave been called Miss MacSkelpie!\"\n\nWhen my first-cousin-once-removed, Rupert, was twelve years old, his\nmother died, and he was in the dolefuls about it for more than a year.\nMiss MacKelpie kept on living with him all the same.  Catch her quitting!\nThat sort don't go into the poor-house when they can keep out!  My\nfather, being Head of the Family, was, of course, one of the trustees,\nand his uncle Roger, brother of the testator, another.  The third was\nGeneral MacKelpie, a poverty-stricken Scotch laird who had a lot of\nvalueless land at Croom, in Ross-shire.  I remember father gave me a new\nten-pound note when I interrupted him whilst he was telling me of the\nincident of young St. Leger's improvidence by remarking that he was in\nerror as to the land.  From what I had heard of MacKelpie's estate, it\nwas productive of one thing; when he asked me \"What?\" I answered\n\"Mortgages!\"  Father, I knew, had bought, not long before, a lot of them\nat what a college friend of mine from Chicago used to call \"cut-throat\"\nprice.  When I remonstrated with my father for buying them at all, and so\ninjuring the family estate which I was to inherit, he gave me an answer,\nthe astuteness of which I have never forgotten.\n\n\"I did it so that I might keep my hand on the bold General, in case he\nshould ever prove troublesome.  And if the worst should ever come to the\nworst, Croom is a good country for grouse and stags!\"  My father can see\nas far as most men!\n\nWhen my cousin--I shall call him cousin henceforth in this record, lest\nit might seem to any unkind person who might hereafter read it that I\nwished to taunt Rupert St. Leger with his somewhat obscure position, in\nreiterating his real distance in kinship with my family--when my cousin,\nRupert St. Leger, wished to commit a certain idiotic act of financial\nfolly, he approached my father on the subject, arriving at our estate,\nHumcroft, at an inconvenient time, without permission, not having had\neven the decent courtesy to say he was coming.  I was then a little chap\nof six years old, but I could not help noticing his mean appearance.  He\nwas all dusty and dishevelled.  When my father saw him--I came into the\nstudy with him--he said in a horrified voice:\n\n\"Good God!\"  He was further shocked when the boy brusquely acknowledged,\nin reply to my father's greeting, that he had travelled third class.  Of\ncourse, none of my family ever go anything but first class; even the\nservants go second.  My father was really angry when he said he had\nwalked up from the station.\n\n\"A nice spectacle for my tenants and my tradesmen!  To see my--my--a\nkinsman of my house, howsoever remote, trudging like a tramp on the road\nto my estate!  Why, my avenue is two miles and a perch!  No wonder you\nare filthy and insolent!\"  Rupert--really, I cannot call him cousin\nhere--was exceedingly impertinent to my father.\n\n\"I walked, sir, because I had no money; but I assure you I did not mean\nto be insolent.  I simply came here because I wished to ask your advice\nand assistance, not because you are an important person, and have a long\navenue--as I know to my cost--but simply because you are one of my\ntrustees.\"\n\n\"_Your_ trustees, sirrah!\" said my father, interrupting him.  \"Your\ntrustees?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said, quite quietly.  \"I meant the trustees\nof my dear mother's will.\"\n\n\"And what, may I ask you,\" said father, \"do you want in the way of advice\nfrom one of the trustees of your dear mother's will?\"  Rupert got very\nred, and was going to say something rude--I knew it from his look--but he\nstopped, and said in the same gentle way:\n\n\"I want your advice, sir, as to the best way of doing something which I\nwish to do, and, as I am under age, cannot do myself.  It must be done\nthrough the trustees of my mother's will.\"\n\n\"And the assistance for which you wish?\" said father, putting his hand in\nhis pocket.  I know what that action means when I am talking to him.\n\n\"The assistance I want,\" said Rupert, getting redder than ever, \"is from\nmy--the trustee also.  To carry out what I want to do.\"\n\n\"And what may that be?\" asked my father.  \"I would like, sir, to make\nover to my Aunt Janet--\"  My father interrupted him by asking--he had\nevidently remembered my jest:\n\n\"Miss MacSkelpie?\"  Rupert got still redder, and I turned away; I didn't\nquite wish that he should see me laughing.  He went on quietly:\n\n\"_MacKelpie_, sir!  Miss Janet MacKelpie, my aunt, who has always been so\nkind to me, and whom my mother loved--I want to have made over to her the\nmoney which my dear mother left to me.\"  Father doubtless wished to have\nthe matter take a less serious turn, for Rupert's eyes were all shiny\nwith tears which had not fallen; so after a little pause he said, with\nindignation, which I knew was simulated:\n\n\"Have you forgotten your mother so soon, Rupert, that you wish to give\naway the very last gift which she bestowed on you?\"  Rupert was sitting,\nbut he jumped up and stood opposite my father with his fist clenched.  He\nwas quite pale now, and his eyes looked so fierce that I thought he would\ndo my father an injury.  He spoke in a voice which did not seem like his\nown, it was so strong and deep.\n\n\"Sir!\" he roared out.  I suppose, if I was a writer, which, thank God, I\nam not--I have no need to follow a menial occupation--I would call it\n\"thundered.\"  \"Thundered\" is a longer word than \"roared,\" and would, of\ncourse, help to gain the penny which a writer gets for a line.  Father\ngot pale too, and stood quite still.  Rupert looked at him steadily for\nquite half a minute--it seemed longer at the time--and suddenly smiled\nand said, as he sat down again:\n\n\"Sorry.  But, of course, you don't understand such things.\"  Then he went\non talking before father had time to say a word.\n\n\"Let us get back to business.  As you do not seem to follow me, let me\nexplain that it is _because_ I do not forget that I wish to do this.  I\nremember my dear mother's wish to make Aunt Janet happy, and would like\nto do as she did.\"\n\n\"_Aunt_ Janet?\" said father, very properly sneering at his ignorance.\n\"She is not your aunt.  Why, even her sister, who was married to your\nuncle, was only your aunt by courtesy.\"  I could not help feeling that\nRupert meant to be rude to my father, though his words were quite polite.\nIf I had been as much bigger than him as he was than me, I should have\nflown at him; but he was a very big boy for his age.  I am myself rather\nthin.  Mother says thinness is an \"appanage of birth.\"\n\n\"My Aunt Janet, sir, is an aunt by love.  Courtesy is a small word to use\nin connection with such devotion as she has given to us.  But I needn't\ntrouble you with such things, sir.  I take it that my relations on the\nside of my own house do not affect you.  I am a Sent Leger!\"  Father\nlooked quite taken aback.  He sat quite still before he spoke.\n\n\"Well, Mr. St. Leger, I shall think over the matter for a while, and\nshall presently let you know my decision.  In the meantime, would you\nlike something to eat?  I take it that as you must have started very\nearly, you have not had any breakfast?\"  Rupert smiled quite genially:\n\n\"That is true, sir.  I haven't broken bread since dinner last night, and\nI am ravenously hungry.\"  Father rang the bell, and told the footman who\nanswered it to send the housekeeper.  When she came, father said to her:\n\n\"Mrs. Martindale, take this boy to your room and give him some\nbreakfast.\"  Rupert stood very still for some seconds.  His face had got\nred again after his paleness.  Then he bowed to my father, and followed\nMrs. Martindale, who had moved to the door.\n\nNearly an hour afterwards my father sent a servant to tell him to come to\nthe study.  My mother was there, too, and I had gone back with her.  The\nman came back and said:\n\n\"Mrs. Martindale, sir, wishes to know, with her respectful service, if\nshe may have a word with you.\"  Before father could reply mother told him\nto bring her.  The housekeeper could not have been far off--that kind are\ngenerally near a keyhole--for she came at once.  When she came in, she\nstood at the door curtseying and looking pale.  Father said:\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I thought, sir and ma'am, that I had better come and tell you about\nMaster Sent Leger.  I would have come at once, but I feared to disturb\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well?\"  Father had a stern way with servants.  When I'm head of the\nfamily I'll tread them under my feet.  That's the way to get real\ndevotion from servants!\n\n\"If you please, sir, I took the young gentleman into my room and ordered\na nice breakfast for him, for I could see he was half famished--a growing\nboy like him, and so tall!  Presently it came along.  It was a good\nbreakfast, too!  The very smell of it made even me hungry.  There were\neggs and frizzled ham, and grilled kidneys, and coffee, and buttered\ntoast, and bloater-paste--\"\n\n\"That will do as to the menu,\" said mother.  \"Go on!\"\n\n\"When it was all ready, and the maid had gone, I put a chair to the table\nand said, 'Now, sir, your breakfast is ready!'  He stood up and said,\n'Thank you, madam; you are very kind!' and he bowed to me quite nicely,\njust as if I was a lady, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said mother.\n\n\"Then, sir, he held out his hand and said, 'Good-bye, and thank you,' and\nhe took up his cap.\n\n\"'But aren't you going to have any breakfast, sir?' I says.\n\n\"'No, thank you, madam,' he said; 'I couldn't eat here . . . in this\nhouse, I mean!'  Well, ma'am, he looked so lonely that I felt my heart\nmelting, and I ventured to ask him if there was any mortal thing I could\ndo for him.  'Do tell me, dear,' I ventured to say.  'I am an old woman,\nand you, sir, are only a boy, though it's a fine man you will be--like\nyour dear, splendid father, which I remember so well, and gentle like\nyour poor dear mother.'\n\n\"'You're a dear!' he says; and with that I took up his hand and kissed\nit, for I remember his poor dear mother so well, that was dead only a\nyear.  Well, with that he turned his head away, and when I took him by\nthe shoulders and turned him round--he is only a young boy, ma'am, for\nall he is so big--I saw that the tears were rolling down his cheeks.\nWith that I laid his head on my breast--I've had children of my own,\nma'am, as you know, though they're all gone.  He came willing enough, and\nsobbed for a little bit.  Then he straightened himself up, and I stood\nrespectfully beside him.\n\n\"'Tell Mr. Melton,' he said, 'that I shall not trouble him about the\ntrustee business.'\n\n\"'But won't you tell him yourself, sir, when you see him?' I says.\n\n\"'I shall not see him again,' he says; 'I am going back now!'\n\n\"Well, ma'am, I knew he'd had no breakfast, though he was hungry, and\nthat he would walk as he come, so I ventured to say: 'If you won't take\nit a liberty, sir, may I do anything to make your going easier?  Have you\nsufficient money, sir?  If not, may I give, or lend, you some?  I shall\nbe very proud if you will allow me to.'\n\n\"'Yes,' he says quite hearty.  'If you will, you might lend me a\nshilling, as I have no money.  I shall not forget it.'  He said, as he\ntook the coin: 'I shall return the amount, though I never can the\nkindness.  I shall keep the coin.'  He took the shilling, sir--he\nwouldn't take any more--and then he said good-bye.  At the door he turned\nand walked back to me, and put his arms round me like a real boy does,\nand gave me a hug, and says he:\n\n\"'Thank you a thousand times, Mrs. Martindale, for your goodness to me,\nfor your sympathy, and for the way you have spoken of my father and\nmother.  You have seen me cry, Mrs. Martindale,' he said; 'I don't often\ncry: the last time was when I came back to the lonely house after my poor\ndear was laid to rest.  But you nor any other shall ever see a tear of\nmine again.'  And with that he straightened out his big back and held up\nhis fine proud head, and walked out.  I saw him from the window striding\ndown the avenue.  My! but he is a proud boy, sir--an honour to your\nfamily, sir, say I respectfully.  And there, the proud child has gone\naway hungry, and he won't, I know, ever use that shilling to buy food!\"\n\nFather was not going to have that, you know, so he said to her:\n\n\"He does not belong to my family, I would have you to know.  True, he is\nallied to us through the female side; but we do not count him or his in\nmy family.\"  He turned away and began to read a book.  It was a decided\nsnub to her.\n\nBut mother had a word to say before Mrs. Martindale was done with.\nMother has a pride of her own, and doesn't brook insolence from\ninferiors; and the housekeeper's conduct seemed to be rather presuming.\nMother, of course, isn't quite our class, though her folk are quite\nworthy and enormously rich.  She is one of the Dalmallingtons, the salt\npeople, one of whom got a peerage when the Conservatives went out.  She\nsaid to the housekeeper:\n\n\"I think, Mrs. Martindale, that I shall not require your services after\nthis day month!  And as I don't keep servants in my employment when I\ndismiss them, here is your month's wages due on the 25th of this month,\nand another month in lieu of notice.  Sign this receipt.\"  She was\nwriting a receipt as she spoke.  The other signed it without a word, and\nhanded it to her.  She seemed quite flabbergasted.  Mother got up and\nsailed--that is the way that mother moves when she is in a wax--out of\nthe room.\n\nLest I should forget it, let me say here that the dismissed housekeeper\nwas engaged the very next day by the Countess of Salop.  I may say in\nexplanation that the Earl of Salop, K.G., who is Lord-Lieutenant of the\nCounty, is jealous of father's position and his growing influence.\nFather is going to contest the next election on the Conservative side,\nand is sure to be made a Baronet before long.\n\n_Letter from Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie_, _V.C._,\n_K.C.B._, _of Croom_, _Ross_, _N.B._, _to Rupert Sent Leger_, _Esq._, 14,\n_Newland Park_, _Dulwich_, _London_, _S.E._\n\n                                                           _July_ 4, 1892.\n\n    MY DEAR GODSON,\n\n    I am truly sorry I am unable to agree with your request that I should\n    acquiesce in your desire to transfer to Miss Janet MacKelpie the\n    property bequeathed to you by your mother, of which property I am a\n    trustee.  Let me say at once that, had it been possible to me to do\n    so, I should have held it a privilege to further such a wish--not\n    because the beneficiare whom you would create is a near kinswoman of\n    my own.  That, in truth, is my real difficulty.  I have undertaken a\n    trust made by an honourable lady on behalf of her only son--son of a\n    man of stainless honour, and a dear friend of my own, and whose son\n    has a rich heritage of honour from both parents, and who will, I am\n    sure, like to look back on his whole life as worthy of his parents,\n    and of those whom his parents trusted.  You will see, I am sure, that\n    whatsoever I might grant regarding anyone else, my hands are tied in\n    this matter.\n\n    And now let me say, my dear boy, that your letter has given me the\n    most intense pleasure.  It is an unspeakable delight to me to find in\n    the son of your father--a man whom I loved, and a boy whom I\n    love--the same generosity of spirit which endeared your father to all\n    his comrades, old as well as young.  Come what may, I shall always be\n    proud of you; and if the sword of an old soldier--it is all I\n    have--can ever serve you in any way, it and its master's life are,\n    and shall be, whilst life remains to him, yours.\n\n    It grieves me to think that Janet cannot, through my act, be given\n    that ease and tranquillity of spirit which come from competence.\n    But, my dear Rupert, you will be of full age in seven years more.\n    Then, if you are in the same mind--and I am sure you will not\n    change--you, being your own master, can do freely as you will.  In\n    the meantime, to secure, so far as I can, my dear Janet against any\n    malign stroke of fortune, I have given orders to my factor to remit\n    semi-annually to Janet one full half of such income as may be derived\n    in any form from my estate of Croom.  It is, I am sorry to say,\n    heavily mortgaged; but of such as is--or may be, free from such\n    charge as the mortgage entails--something at least will, I trust,\n    remain to her.  And, my dear boy, I can frankly say that it is to me\n    a real pleasure that you and I can be linked in one more bond in this\n    association of purpose.  I have always held you in my heart as though\n    you were my own son.  Let me tell you now that you have acted as I\n    should have liked a son of my own, had I been blessed with one, to\n    have acted.  God bless you, my dear.\n\n                                                               Yours ever,\n                                                    COLIN ALEX. MACKELPIE.\n\n_Letter from Roger Melton_, _of Openshaw Grange_, _to Rupert Sent Leger_,\n_Esq._, 14, _Newland Park_, _Dulwich_, _London_, _S.E._\n\n                                                           _July_ 1, 1892.\n\n    MY DEAR NEPHEW,\n\n    Your letter of the 30th ult. received.  Have carefully considered\n    matter stated, and have come to the conclusion that my duty as a\n    trustee would not allow me to give full consent, as you wish.  Let me\n    explain.  The testator, in making her will, intended that such\n    fortune as she had at disposal should be used to supply to you her\n    son such benefits as its annual product should procure.  To this end,\n    and to provide against wastefulness or foolishness on your part, or,\n    indeed, against any generosity, howsoever worthy, which might\n    impoverish you and so defeat her benevolent intentions regarding your\n    education, comfort, and future good, she did not place the estate\n    directly in your hands, leaving you to do as you might feel inclined\n    about it.  But, on the contrary, she entrusted the corpus of it in\n    the hands of men whom she believed should be resolute enough and\n    strong enough to carry out her intent, even against any cajolements\n    or pressure which might be employed to the contrary.  It being her\n    intention, then, that such trustees as she appointed would use for\n    your benefit the interest accruing annually from the capital at\n    command, _and that only_ (as specifically directed in the will), so\n    that on your arriving at full age the capital entrusted to us should\n    be handed over to you intact, I find a hard-and-fast duty in the\n    matter of adhering exactly to the directions given.  I have no doubt\n    that my co-trustees regard the matter in exactly the same light.\n    Under the circumstances, therefore, we, the trustees, have not only a\n    single and united duty towards you as the object of the testator's\n    wishes, but towards each other as regards the manner of the carrying\n    out of that duty.  I take it, therefore, that it would not be\n    consonant with the spirit of the trust or of our own ideas in\n    accepting it that any of us should take a course pleasant to himself\n    which would or might involve a stern opposition on the part of other\n    of the co-trustees.  We have each of us to do the unpleasant part of\n    this duty without fear or favour.  You understand, of course, that\n    the time which must elapse before you come into absolute possession\n    of your estate is a limited one.  As by the terms of the will we are\n    to hand over our trust when you have reached the age of twenty-one,\n    there are only seven years to expire.  But till then, though I should\n    gladly meet your wishes if I could, I must adhere to the duty which I\n    have undertaken.  At the expiration of that period you will be quite\n    free to divest yourself of your estate without protest or comment of\n    any man.\n\n    Having now expressed as clearly as I can the limitations by which I\n    am bound with regard to the corpus of your estate, let me say that in\n    any other way which is in my power or discretion I shall be most\n    happy to see your wishes carried out so far as rests with me.\n    Indeed, I shall undertake to use what influence I may possess with my\n    co-trustees to induce them to take a similar view of your wishes.  In\n    my own thinking you are quite free to use your own property in your\n    own way.  But as, until you shall have attained your majority, you\n    have only life-user in your mother's bequest, you are only at liberty\n    to deal with the annual increment.  On our part as trustees we have a\n    first charge on that increment to be used for purposes of your\n    maintenance, clothes, and education.  As to what may remain over each\n    half-year, you will be free to deal with it as you choose.  On\n    receiving from you a written authorization to your trustees, if you\n    desire the whole sum or any part of it to be paid over to Miss Janet\n    MacKelpie, I shall see that it is effected.  Believe me, that our\n    duty is to protect the corpus of the estate, and to this end we may\n    not act on any instruction to imperil it.  But there our warranty\n    stops.  We can deal during our trusteeship with the corpus only.\n    Further, lest there should arise any error on your part, we can deal\n    with any general instruction for only so long as it may remain\n    unrevoked.  You are, and must be, free to alter your instructions or\n    authorizations at any time.  Thus your latest document must be used\n    for our guidance.\n\n    As to the general principle involved in your wish I make no comment.\n    You are at liberty to deal with your own how you will.  I quite\n    understand that your impulse is a generous one, and I fully believe\n    that it is in consonance with what had always been the wishes of my\n    sister.  Had she been happily alive and had to give judgment of your\n    intent, I am convinced that she would have approved.  Therefore, my\n    dear nephew, should you so wish, I shall be happy for her sake as\n    well as your own to pay over on your account (as a confidential\n    matter between you and me), but from my own pocket, a sum equal to\n    that which you wish transferred to Miss Janet MacKelpie.  On hearing\n    from you I shall know how to act in the matter.  With all good\n    wishes,\n\n                                                         Believe me to be,\n                                                  Your affectionate uncle,\n                                                             ROGER MELTON.\n\n    TO RUPERT SENT LEGER, ESQ.\n\n_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Roger Melton_,\n\n                                                           _July_ 5, 1892.\n\n    MY DEAR UNCLE,\n\n    Thank you heartily for your kind letter.  I quite understand, and now\n    see that I should not have asked you as a trustee, such a thing.  I\n    see your duty clearly, and agree with your view of it.  I enclose a\n    letter directed to my trustees, asking them to pay over annually till\n    further direction to Miss Janet MacKelpie at this address whatever\n    sum may remain over from the interest of my mother's bequest after\n    deduction of such expenses as you may deem fit for my maintenance,\n    clothing, and education, together with a sum of one pound sterling\n    per month, which was the amount my dear mother always gave me for my\n    personal use--\"pocket-money,\" she called it.\n\n    With regard to your most kind and generous offer to give to my dear\n    Aunt Janet the sum which I would have given myself, had such been in\n    my power, I thank you most truly and sincerely, both for my dear aunt\n    (to whom, of course, I shall not mention the matter unless you\n    specially authorize me) and myself.  But, indeed, I think it will be\n    better not to offer it.  Aunt Janet is very proud, and would not\n    accept any benefit.  With me, of course, it is different, for since I\n    was a wee child she has been like another mother to me, and I love\n    her very much.  Since my mother died--and she, of course, was\n    all-in-all to me--there has been no other.  And in such a love as\n    ours pride has no place.  Thank you again, dear uncle, and God bless\n    you.\n\n                                                       Your loving nephew,\n                                                        RUPERT SENT LEGER.\n\n\n\nERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD--_Continued_.\n\n\nAnd now _re_ the remaining one of Sir Geoffrey's children, Roger.  He was\nthe third child and third son, the only daughter, Patience, having been\nborn twenty years after the last of the four sons.  Concerning Roger, I\nshall put down all I have heard of him from my father and grandfather.\nFrom my grand-aunt I heard nothing, I was a very small kid when she died;\nbut I remember seeing her, but only once.  A very tall, handsome woman of\na little over thirty, with very dark hair and light-coloured eyes.  I\nthink they were either grey or blue, but I can't remember which.  She\nlooked very proud and haughty, but I am bound to say that she was very\nnice to me.  I remember feeling very jealous of Rupert because his mother\nlooked so distinguished.  Rupert was eight years older than me, and I was\nafraid he would beat me if I said anything he did not like.  So I was\nsilent except when I forgot to be, and Rupert said very unkindly, and I\nthink very unfairly, that I was \"A sulky little beast.\"  I haven't forgot\nthat, and I don't mean to.  However, it doesn't matter much what he said\nor thought.  There he is--if he is at all--where no one can find him,\nwith no money or nothing, for what little he had he settled when he came\nof age, on the MacSkelpie.  He wanted to give it to her when his mother\ndied, but father, who was a trustee, refused; and Uncle Roger, as I call\nhim, who is another, thought the trustees had no power to allow Rupert to\nthrow away his matrimony, as I called it, making a joke to father when he\ncalled it patrimony.  Old Sir Colin MacSkelpie, who is the third, said he\ncouldn't take any part in such a permission, as the MacSkelpie was his\nniece.  He is a rude old man, that.  I remember when, not remembering his\nrelationship, I spoke of the MacSkelpie, he caught me a clip on the ear\nthat sent me across the room.  His Scotch is very broad.  I can hear him\nsay, \"Hae some attempt at even Soothern manners, and dinna misca' yer\nbetters, ye young puddock, or I'll wring yer snoot!\"  Father was, I could\nsee, very much offended, but he didn't say anything.  He remembered, I\nthink, that the General is a V.C. man, and was fond of fighting duels.\nBut to show that the fault was not his, _he_ wrung _my_ ear--and the same\near too!  I suppose he thought that was justice!  But it's only right to\nsay that he made up for it afterwards.  When the General had gone he gave\nme a five-pound note.\n\nI don't think Uncle Roger was very pleased with the way Rupert behaved\nabout the legacy, for I don't think he ever saw him from that day to\nthis.  Perhaps, of course, it was because Rupert ran away shortly\nafterwards; but I shall tell about that when I come to him.  After all,\nwhy should my uncle bother about him?  He is not a Melton at all, and I\nam to be Head of the House--of course, when the Lord thinks right to take\nfather to Himself!  Uncle Roger has tons of money, and he never married,\nso if he wants to leave it in the right direction he needn't have any\ntrouble.  He made his money in what he calls \"the Eastern Trade.\"  This,\nso far as I can gather, takes in the Levant and all east of it.  I know\nhe has what they call in trade \"houses\" in all sorts of places--Turkey,\nand Greece, and all round them, Morocco, Egypt, and Southern Russia, and\nthe Holy Land; then on to Persia, India, and all round it; the\nChersonese, China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands.  It is not to be\nexpected that we landowners can know much about trade, but my uncle\ncovers--or alas! I must say \"covered\"--a lot of ground, I can tell you.\nUncle Roger was a very grim sort of man, and only that I was brought up\nto try and be kind to him I shouldn't ever have dared to speak to him.\nBut when was a child father and mother--especially mother--forced me to\ngo and see him and be affectionate to him.  He wasn't ever even civil to\nme, that I can remember--grumpy old bear!  But, then, he never saw Rupert\nat all, so that I take it Master R--- is out of the running altogether\nfor testamentary honours.  The last time I saw him myself he was\ndistinctly rude.  He treated me as a boy, though I was getting on for\neighteen years of age.  I came into his office without knocking; and\nwithout looking up from his desk, where he was writing, he said: \"Get\nout!  Why do you venture to disturb me when I'm busy?  Get out, and be\ndamned to you!\"  I waited where I was, ready to transfix him with my eye\nwhen he should look up, for I cannot forget that when my father dies I\nshall be Head of my House.  But when he did there was no transfixing\npossible.  He said quite coolly:\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it?  I thought it was one of my office boys.  Sit down,\nif you want to see me, and wait till I am ready.\"  So I sat down and\nwaited.  Father always said that I should try to conciliate and please my\nuncle.  Father is a very shrewd man, and Uncle Roger is a very rich one.\n\nBut I don't think Uncle R--- is as shrewd as he thinks he is.  He\nsometimes makes awful mistakes in business.  For instance, some years ago\nhe bought an enormous estate on the Adriatic, in the country they call\nthe \"Land of Blue Mountains.\"  At least, he says he bought it.  He told\nfather so in confidence.  But he didn't show any title-deeds, and I'm\ngreatly afraid he was \"had.\"  A bad job for me that he was, for father\nbelieves he paid an enormous sum for it, and as I am his natural heir, it\nreduces his available estate to so much less.\n\nAnd now about Rupert.  As I have said, he ran away when he was about\nfourteen, and we did not hear about him for years.  When we--or, rather,\nmy father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard.  He had gone as\na cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn.  Then he joined an\nexploring party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in\nAlaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands.  After that he went through\nCentral America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India,\nand a lot of places.  We all know the wisdom of the adage that \"A rolling\nstone gathers no moss\"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss,\nCousin Rupert will die a poor man.  Indeed, nothing will stand his\nidiotic, boastful wastefulness.  Look at the way in which, when he came\nof age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I\nam sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as\nHead of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not\npleased.  My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had\nthe sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is\nnot in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her\nspirited conduct in the matter.  We never did think much of Rupert,\nanyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a\ndangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider.  We know what he\nreally is.  For my own part, I loathe and despise him.  Just now we are\nirritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear\nUncle Roger's Will.  For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear\nuncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to\nknow where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the\nWill public, so we all have to wait.  It is especially hard on me, who am\nthe natural heir.  It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away\nlike that.  I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to\nunderstand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir!  He said that\nprobably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not\nknow of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our\nanxiety.  Our anxiety, forsooth!  We are not anxious; we only wish to\n_know_.  And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of\nthinking of the detestable and unfair death-duties, are anxious, we\nshould be so.  Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment\nand set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper\nwithout hope!\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nTo-day we (father and I) had letters from Mr. Trent, telling us that the\nwhereabouts of \"Mr. Rupert Sent Leger\" had been discovered, and that a\nletter disclosing the fact of poor Uncle Roger's death had been sent to\nhim.  He was at Titicaca when last heard of.  So goodness only knows when\nhe may get the letter, which \"asks him to come home at once, but only\ngives to him such information about the Will as has already been given to\nevery member of the testator's family.\"  And that is nil.  I dare say we\nshall be kept waiting for months before we get hold of the estate which\nis ours.  It is too bad!\n\n_Letter from Edward Bingham Trent to Ernest Roger Halbard Melton_.\n\n                                                176, LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS,\n                                                      _December_ 28, 1906.\n\n    DEAR SIR,\n\n    I am glad to be able to inform you that I have just heard by letter\n    from Mr. Rupert St. Leger that he intended leaving Rio de Janeiro by\n    the S.S. _Amazon_, of the Royal Mail Company, on December 15.

As all the others possibly interested in the Will of the\n    late Roger Melton, and whose names are given to me in his\n    instructions regarding the reading of the Will, have been advised,\n    and have expressed their intention of being present at that event on\n    being apprised of the time and place, I now beg to inform you that by\n    cable message received the date scheduled for arrival at the Port of\n    London was January 1 prox.  I therefore beg to notify you, subject to\n    postponement due to the non-arrival of the _Amazon_, the reading of\n    the Will of the late Roger Melton, Esq., will take place in my office\n    on Thursday, January 3 prox., at eleven o'clock a.m.\n\n                                             I have the honour to be, sir,\n                                                         Yours faithfully,\n                                                     EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT.\n\n                                     TO ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON, ESQ.,\n                                                                 HUMCROFT,\n                                                                    SALOP.\n\nCable: _Rupert Sent Leger to Edward Bingham Trent_.\n_Amazon_ arrives London January 1.

Father got a duplicate of Mr.\nTrent's letter to me, and of the cable and two telegrams pasted into this\nRecord.  We both waited patiently till the third--that is, we did not say\nanything.  The only impatient member of our family was my mother.  She\n_did_ say things, and if old Trent had been here his ears would have been\nred.  She said what ridiculous nonsense it was delaying the reading of\nthe Will, and keeping the Heir waiting for the arrival of an obscure\nperson who wasn't even a member of the family, inasmuch as he didn't bear\nthe name.  I don't think it's quite respectful to one who is some day to\nbe Head of the House!  I thought father was weakening in his patience\nwhen he said: \"True, my dear--true!\" and got up and left the room.  Some\ntime afterwards when I passed the library I heard him walking up and\ndown.\n\nFather and I went up to town on the afternoon of Wednesday, January 2.\nWe stayed, of course, at Claridge's, where we always stay when we go to\ntown.  Mother wanted to come, too, but father thought it better not.  She\nwould not agree to stay at home till we both promised to send her\nseparate telegrams after the reading.\n\nAt five minutes to eleven we entered Mr. Trent's office.  Father would\nnot go a moment earlier, as he said it was bad form to seem eager at any\ntime, but most of all at the reading of a will.  It was a rotten grind,\nfor we had to be walking all over the neighbourhood for half an hour\nbefore it was time, not to be too early.\n\nWhen we went into the room we found there General Sir Colin MacKelpie and\na big man, very bronzed, whom I took to be Rupert St. Leger--not a very\ncreditable connection to look at, I thought!  He and old MacKelpie took\ncare to be in time!  Rather low, I thought it.  Mr. St. Leger was reading\na letter.  He had evidently come in but lately, for though he seemed to\nbe eager about it, he was only at the first page, and I could see that\nthere were many sheets.  He did not look up when we came in, or till he\nhad finished the letter; and you may be sure that neither I nor my father\n(who, as Head of the House, should have had more respect from him) took\nthe trouble to go to him.  After all, he is a pauper and a wastrel, and\nhe has not the honour of bearing our Name.  The General, however, came\nforward and greeted us both cordially.  He evidently had forgotten--or\npretended to have--the discourteous way he once treated me, for he spoke\nto me quite in a friendly way--I thought more warmly than he did to\nfather.  I was pleased to be spoken to so nicely, for, after all,\nwhatever his manners may be, he is a distinguished man--has won the V.C.\nand a Baronetcy.  He got the latter not long ago, after the Frontier War\nin India.  I was not, however, led away into cordiality myself.  I had\nnot forgotten his rudeness, and I thought that he might be sucking up to\nme.  I knew that when I had my dear Uncle Roger's many millions I should\nbe a rather important person; and, of course, he knew it too.  So I got\neven with him for his former impudence.  When he held out his hand I put\none finger in it, and said, \"How do?\"  He got very red and turned away.\nFather and he had ended by glaring at each other, so neither of us was\nsorry to be done with him.  All the time Mr. St. Leger did not seem to\nsee or hear anything, but went on reading his letter.  I thought the old\nMacSkelpie was going to bring him into the matter between us, for as he\nturned away I heard him say something under his breath.  It sounded like\n\"Help!\" but Mr. S--- did not hear.  He certainly no notice of it.\n\nAs the MacS--- and Mr. S--- sat quite silent, neither looking at us, and\nas father was sitting on the other side of the room with his chin in his\nhand, and as I wanted to show that I was indifferent to the two S's, I\ntook out this notebook, and went on with the Record, bringing it up to\nthis moment.\n\n\n\nTHE RECORD--_Continued_.\n\n\nWhen I had finished writing I looked over at Rupert.\n\nWhen he saw us, he jumped up and went over to father and shook his hand\nquite warmly.  Father took him very coolly.  Rupert, however, did not\nseem to see it, but came towards me heartily.  I happened to be doing\nsomething else at the moment, and at first I did not see his hand; but\njust as I was looking at it the clock struck eleven.  Whilst it was\nstriking Mr. Trent came into the room.  Close behind him came his clerk,\ncarrying a locked tin box.  There were two other men also.  He bowed to\nus all in turn, beginning with me.  I was standing opposite the door; the\nothers were scattered about.  Father sat still, but Sir Colin and Mr. St.\nLeger rose.  Mr. Trent not did shake hands with any of us--not even me.\nNothing but his respectful bow.  That is the etiquette for an attorney, I\nunderstand, on such formal occasions.\n\nHe sat down at the end of the big table in the centre of the room, and\nasked us to sit round.  Father, of course, as Head of the Family, took\nthe seat at his right hand.  Sir Colin and St. Leger went to the other\nside, the former taking the seat next to the attorney.  The General\nknows, of course, that a Baronet takes precedence at a ceremony.  I may\nbe a Baronet some day myself, and have to know these things.\n\nThe clerk took the key which his master handed to him, opened the tin\nbox, and took from it a bundle of papers tied with red tape.  This he\nplaced before the attorney, and put the empty box behind him on the\nfloor.  Then he and the other man sat at the far end of the table; the\nlatter took out a big notebook and several pencils, and put them before\nhim.  He was evidently a shorthand-writer.   Mr. Trent removed the tape\nfrom the bundle of papers, which he placed a little distance in front of\nhim.  He took a sealed envelope from the top, broke the seal, opened the\nenvelope, and from it took a parchment, in the folds of which were some\nsealed envelopes, which he laid in a heap in front of the other paper.\nThen he unfolded the parchment, and laid it before him with the outside\npage up.  He fixed his glasses, and said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, the sealed envelope which you have seen me open is endorsed\n'My Last Will and Testament--ROGER MELTON, _June_, 1906.'  This\ndocument\"--holding it up--\"is as follows:\n\n    \"'I Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange in the County of Dorset; of\n    number one hundred and twenty-three Berkeley Square London; and of\n    the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains, being of\n    sound mind do make this my Last Will and Testament on this day Monday\n    the eleventh day of the month of June in the year of Our Lord one\n    thousand nine hundred and six at the office of my old friend and\n    Attorney Edward Bingham Trent in number one hundred and seventy-six\n    Lincoln's Inn Fields London hereby revoking all other wills that I\n    may have formerly made and giving this as my sole and last Will\n    making dispositions of my property as follows:\n\n    \"'1.

Many of the beneficiaries were old friends,\ncomrades, dependents, and servants, some of them being left quite large\nsums of money and specific objects, such as curios and pictures.\n\n    \"'5.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Roger Halbard Melton presently\n    living in the house of his father at Humcroft Salop the sum of Ten\n    thousand pounds sterling.\n\n    \"'6.

To my dear nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my dear sister\n    Patience Melton by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger the\n    sum of one thousand pounds sterling.  I also bequeath to the said\n    Rupert Sent Leger a further sum conditional upon his acceptance of\n    the terms of a letter addressed to him marked B, and left in the\n    custody of the above Edward Bingham Trent and which letter is an\n    integral part of this my Will.  In case of the non-acceptance of the\n    conditions of such letter, I devise and bequeath the whole of the\n    sums and properties reserved therein to the executors herein\n    appointed Colin Alexander MacKelpie and Edward Bingham Trent in trust\n    to distribute the same in accordance with the terms of the letter in\n    the present custody of Edward Bingham Trent marked C, and now\n    deposited sealed with my seal in the sealed envelope containing my\n    last Will to be kept in the custody of the said Edward Bingham Trent\n    and which said letter C is also an integral part of my Will.

And if any beneficiary under this\n    Will shall challenge the same or any part of it, or dispute the\n    validity thereof, he shall forfeit to the general estate the bequest\n    made herein to him, and any such bequest shall cease and be void to\n    all intents and purposes whatsoever.\n\n    \"'8.  For proper compliance with laws and duties connected with\n    testamentary proceedings and to keep my secret trusts secret I direct\n    my Executors to pay all Death, Estate, Settlement, Legacy,\n    Succession, or other duties charges impositions and assessments\n    whatever on the residue of my estate beyond the bequests already\n    named, at the scale charged in the case of most distant relatives or\n    strangers in blood.\n\n    \"'9.

Holding the bundle\nin his hand, he stood up, saying as he did so:\n\n\"That is all, gentlemen, unless any of you wish to ask me any questions;\nin which case I shall answer, of course, to the best of my power.  I\nshall ask you, Sir Colin, to remain with me, as we have to deal with some\nmatters, or to arrange a time when we may meet to do so.  And you also,\nMr. Sent Leger, as there is this letter to submit to you.  It is\nnecessary that you should open it in the presence of the executors, but\nthere is no necessity that anyone else should be present.\"\n\nThe first to speak was my father.  Of course, as a county gentleman of\nposition and estate, who is sometimes asked to take the chair at\nSessions--of course, when there is not anyone with a title present--he\nfound himself under the duty of expressing himself first.  Old MacKelpie\nhas superior rank; but this was a family affair, in which my father is\nHead of the House, whilst old MacKelpie is only an outsider brought into\nit--and then only to the distaff side, by the wife of a younger brother\nof the man who married into our family.  Father spoke with the same look\non his face as when he asks important questions of witnesses at Quarter\nSessions.\n\n\"I should like some points elucidated.\"  The attorney bowed (he gets his\n120 thou', any way, so he can afford to be oily--suave, I suppose he\nwould call it); so father looked at a slip of paper in his hand and\nasked:\n\n\"How much is the amount of the whole estate?\"\n\nThe attorney answered quickly, and I thought rather rudely.  He was red\nin the face, and didn't bow this time; I suppose a man of his class\nhasn't more than a very limited stock of manners:\n\n\"That, sir, I am not at liberty to tell you.  And I may say that I would\nnot if I could.\"\n\n\"Is it a million?\" said father again.  He was angry this time, and even\nredder than the old attorney.  The attorney said in answer, very quietly\nthis time:\n\n\"Ah, that's cross-examining.  Let me say, sir, that no one can know that\nuntil the accountants to be appointed for the purpose have examined the\naffairs of the testator up to date.\"\n\nMr. Rupert St. Leger, who was looking all this time angrier than even the\nattorney or my father--though at what he had to be angry about I can't\nimagine--struck his fist on the table and rose up as if to speak, but as\nhe caught sight of both old MacKelpie and the attorney he sat down again.\n_Mem._--Those three seem to agree too well.  I must keep a sharp eye on\nthem.  I didn't think of this part any more at the time, for father asked\nanother question which interested me much:\n\n\"May I ask why the other matters of the Will are not shown to us?\"  The\nattorney wiped his spectacles carefully with a big silk bandanna\nhandkerchief before he answered:\n\n\"Simply because each of the two letters marked 'B' and 'C' is enclosed\nwith instructions regarding their opening and the keeping secret of their\ncontents.  I shall call your attention to the fact that both envelopes\nare sealed, and that the testator and both witnesses have signed their\nnames across the flap of each envelope.  I shall read them.  The letter\nmarked 'B,' directed to 'Rupert Sent Leger,' is thus endorsed:\n\n    \"'This letter is to be given to Rupert Sent Leger by the Trustees and\n    is to be opened by him in their presence.  He is to take such copy or\n    make such notes as he may wish and is then to hand the letter with\n    envelope to the Executors who are at once to read it, each of them\n    being entitled to make copy or notes if desirous of so doing.  The\n    letter is then to be replaced in its envelope and letter and envelope\n    are to be placed in another envelope to be endorsed on outside as to\n    its contents and to be signed across the flap by both the Executors\n    and by the said Rupert Sent Leger.\n\n                                          \"'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1\/6\/'06.\n\n\"The letter marked 'C,' directed to 'Edward Bingham Trent,' is thus\nendorsed:\n\n    \"'This letter directed to Edward Bingham Trent is to be kept by him\n    unopened for a term of two years after the reading of my Last Will\n    unless said period is earlier terminated by either the acceptance or\n    refusal of Rupert Sent Leger to accept the conditions mentioned in my\n    letter to him marked 'B' which he is to receive and read in the\n    presence of my Executors at the same meeting as but subsequent to the\n    Reading of the clauses (except those to be ultimately numbers ten and\n    eleven) of my Last Will.  This letter contains instructions as to\n    what both the Executors and the said Rupert Sent Leger are to do when\n    such acceptance or refusal of the said Rupert Sent Leger has been\n    made known, or if he omit or refuse to make any such acceptance or\n    refusal, at the end of two years next after my decease.\n\n    \"'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1\/6\/'06.'\"\n\nWhen the attorney had finished reading the last letter he put it\ncarefully in his pocket.  Then he took the other letter in his hand, and\nstood up.  \"Mr. Rupert Sent Leger,\" he said, \"please to open this letter,\nand in such a way that all present may see that the memorandum at top of\nthe contents is given as--\n\n    \"'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will.'\"\n\nSt. Leger rolled up his sleeves and cuffs just as if he was going to\nperform some sort of prestidigitation--it was very theatrical and\nridiculous--then, his wrists being quite bare, he opened the envelope and\ntook out the letter.  We all saw it quite well.  It was folded with the\nfirst page outward, and on the top was written a line just as the\nattorney said.  In obedience to a request from the attorney, he laid both\nletter and envelope on the table in front of him.  The clerk then rose\nup, and, after handing a piece of paper to the attorney, went back to his\nseat.  Mr. Trent, having written something on the paper, asked us all who\nwere present, even the clerk and the shorthand man, to look at the\nmemorandum on the letter and what was written on the envelope, and to\nsign the paper, which ran:\n\n\"We the signatories of this paper hereby declare that we have seen the\nsealed letter marked B and enclosed in the Will of Roger Melton opened in\nthe presence of us all including Mr. Edward Bingham Trent and Sir Colin\nAlexander MacKelpie and we declare that the paper therein contained was\nheaded 'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will' and that there were no\nother contents in the envelope.  In attestation of which we in the\npresence of each other append our signatures.\"\n\nThe attorney motioned to my father to begin.  Father is a cautious man,\nand he asked for a magnifying-glass, which was shortly brought to him by\na clerk for whom the clerk in the room called.  Father examined the\nenvelope all over very carefully, and also the memorandum at top of the\npaper.  Then, without a word, he signed the paper.  Father is a just man.\nThen we all signed.  The attorney folded the paper and put it in an\nenvelope.  Before closing it he passed it round, and we all saw that it\nhad not been tampered with.  Father took it out and read it, and then put\nit back.  Then the attorney asked us all to sign it across the flap,\nwhich we did.  Then he put the sealing-wax on it and asked father to seal\nit with his own seal.  He did so.  Then he and MacKelpie sealed it also\nwith their own seals, Then he put it in another envelope, which he sealed\nhimself, and he and MacKelpie signed it across the flap.\n\nThen father stood up, and so did I.  So did the two men--the clerk and\nthe shorthand writer.  Father did not say a word till we got out into the\nstreet.  We walked along, and presently we passed an open gate into the\nfields.  He turned back, saying to me:\n\n\"Come in here.  There is no one about, and we can be quiet.  I want to\nspeak to you.\"  When we sat down on a seat with none other near it,\nfather said:\n\n\"You are a student of the law.  What does all that mean?\"  I thought it a\ngood occasion for an epigram, so I said one word:\n\n\"Bilk!\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said father; \"that is so far as you and I are concerned.  You with\na beggarly ten thousand, and I with twenty.  But what is, or will be, the\neffect of those secret trusts?\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" I said, \"will, I dare say, be all right.  Uncle Roger\nevidently did not intend the older generation to benefit too much by his\ndeath.  But he only gave Rupert St. Leger one thousand pounds, whilst he\ngave me ten.  That looks as if he had more regard for the direct line.\nOf course--\"  Father interrupted me:\n\n\"But what was the meaning of a further sum?\"\n\n\"I don't know, father.  There was evidently some condition which he was\nto fulfil; but he evidently didn't expect that he would.  Why, otherwise,\ndid he leave a second trust to Mr. Trent?\"\n\n\"True!\" said father.  Then he went on: \"I wonder why he left those\nenormous sums to Trent and old MacKelpie.  They seem out of all\nproportion as executors' fees, unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what, father?\"\n\n\"Unless the fortune he has left is an enormous one.  That is why I\nasked.\"\n\n\"And that,\" I laughed, \"is why he refused to answer.\"\n\n\"Why, Ernest, it must run into big figures.\"\n\n\"Right-ho, father.  The death-duties will be annoying.  What a beastly\nswindle the death-duties are!  Why, I shall suffer even on your own\nlittle estate . . . \"\n\n\"That will do!\" he said curtly.  Father is so ridiculously touchy.  One\nwould think he expects to live for ever.  Presently he spoke again:\n\n\"I wonder what are the conditions of that trust.  They are as\nimportant--almost--as the amount of the bequest--whatever it is.  By the\nway, there seems to be no mention in the will of a residuary legatee.\nErnest, my boy, we may have to fight over that.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out, father?\" I asked.  He had been very rude over\nthe matter of the death-duties of his own estate, though it is entailed\nand I _must_ inherit.  So I determined to let him see that I know a good\ndeal more than he does--of law, at any rate.  \"I fear that when we come\nto look into it closely that dog won't fight.  In the first place, that\nmay be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which is a part of the\nWill.  And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the\nconditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins\nto work.  What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked\nat it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation.  But\neven if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the\ncorpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn\npleases.  He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one\ncan say a word.  In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said father to himself.  \"It is a queer kind of will, I take it,\nthat can override the Court of Chancery.  We shall perhaps have to try it\nbefore we are done with this!\"  With that he rose, and we walked home\ntogether--without saying another word.\n\nMy mother was very inquisitive about the whole thing--women always are.\nFather and I between us told her all it was necessary for her to know.  I\nthink we were both afraid that, woman-like, she would make trouble for us\nby saying or doing something injudicious.  Indeed, she manifested such\nhostility towards Rupert St. Leger that it is quite on the cards that she\nmay try to injure him in some way.  So when father said that he would\nhave to go out shortly again, as he wished to consult his solicitor, I\njumped up and said I would go with him, as I, too, should take advice as\nto how I stood in the matter.\n\n_The Contents of Letter marked_ \"_B_\" _attached as an Integral Part to\nthe Last Will of Roger Melton_.\n\n                                                          _June_ 11, 1907.\n\n    \"This letter an integral part of my Last Will regards the entire\n    residue of my estate beyond the specific bequests made in the body of\n    my Will.

I make the first memorandum immediately after\n    the event, whilst every detail of act and conversation is still fresh\n    in my mind.  I shall also try to make such comments thereon as may\n    serve to refresh my memory hereafter, and which in case of my death\n    may perhaps afford as opinions contemporaneously recorded some\n    guiding light to other or others who may later on have to continue\n    and complete the tasks entrusted to me.\n\n    I.\n\n    CONCERNING THE READING OF THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON.\n\n    When, beginning at 11 o'clock a.m. on this the forenoon of Thursday,\n    the 3rd day of January, 1907, I opened the Will and read it in full,\n    except the clauses contained in the letters marked \"B\" and \"C\"; there\n    were present in addition to myself, the following:\n\n    1.  Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P, nephew of the testator.\n\n    2.  Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, son of the above.\n\n    3.  Rupert Sent Leger, nephew of the testator.\n\n    4.  Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie, Bart., co-executor\n    with myself of the Will.\n\n    5.  Andrew Rossiter, my clerk, one of the witnesses of the testator's\n    Will.\n\n    6.  Alfred Nugent, stenographer (of Messrs. Castle's office, 21,\n    Bream's Buildings, W.C.).\n\nWhen the Will had been read, Mr. E. H. Melton asked the value of the\nestate left by the testator, which query I did not feel empowered or\notherwise able to answer; and a further query, as to why those present\nwere not shown the secret clauses of the Will.  I answered by reading the\ninstructions endorsed on the envelopes of the two letters marked \"B\" and\n\"C,\" which were sufficiently explanatory.\n\nBut, lest any question should hereafter arise as to the fact that the\nmemoranda in letters marked \"B\" and \"C,\" which were to be read as clauses\n10 and 11 of the Will, I caused Rupert Sent Leger to open the envelope\nmarked \"B\" in the presence of all in the room.  These all signed a paper\nwhich I had already prepared, to the effect that they had seen the\nenvelope opened, and that the memorandum marked \"B.  To be read as clause\nten of my Will,\" was contained in the envelope, of which it was to be the\nsole contents.  Mr. Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P., before signing,\ncarefully examined with a magnifying-glass, for which he had asked, both\nthe envelope and the heading of the memorandum enclosed in the letter.\nHe was about to turn the folded paper which was lying on the table over,\nby which he might have been able to read the matter of the memorandum had\nhe so desired.  I at once advised him that the memorandum he was to sign\ndealt only with the heading of the page, and not with the matter.  He\nlooked very angry, but said nothing, and after a second scrutiny signed.\nI put the memorandum in an envelope, which we all signed across the flap.\nBefore signing, Mr Ernest Halbard Melton took out the paper and verified\nit.  I then asked him to close it, which he did, and when the sealing-wax\nwas on it he sealed it with his own seal.  Sir Colin A. MacKelpie and I\nalso appended our own seals.  I put the envelope in another, which I\nsealed with my own seal, and my co-executor and I signed it across the\nflap and added the date.  I took charge of this.  When the others present\nhad taken their departure, my co-executor and I, together with Mr. Rupert\nSent Leger, who had remained at my request, went into my private room.\n\nHere Mr. Rupert Sent Leger read the memorandum marked \"B,\" which is to be\nread as clause 10 of the Will.  He is evidently a man of considerable\nnerve, for his face was quite impassive as he read the document, which\nconveyed to him (subject to the conditions laid down) a fortune which has\nno equal in amount in Europe, even, so far as I know, amongst the crowned\nheads.  When he had read it over a second time he stood up and said:\n\n\"I wish I had known my uncle better.  He must have had the heart of a\nking.  I never heard of such generosity as he has shown me.  Mr. Trent, I\nsee, from the conditions of this memorandum, or codicil, or whatever it\nis, that I am to declare within a week as to whether I accept the\nconditions imposed on me.  Now, I want you to tell me this: must I wait a\nweek to declare?\"  In answer, I told him that the testator's intention\nwas manifestly to see that he had full time to consider fully every point\nbefore making formal decision and declaration.  But, in answer to the\nspecific question, I could answer that he might make declaration when he\nwould, provided it was _within_, or rather not after, the week named.  I\nadded:\n\n\"But I strongly advise you not to act hurriedly.  So enormous a sum is\ninvolved that you may be sure that all possible efforts will be made by\nsomeone or other to dispossess you of your inheritance, and it will be\nwell that everything shall be done, not only in perfect order, but with\nsuch manifest care and deliberation that there can be no question as to\nyour intention.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" he answered; \"I shall do as you shall kindly advise me\nin this as in other things.  But I may tell you now--and you, too, my\ndear Sir Colin--that I not only accept my Uncle Roger's conditions in\nthis, but that when the time comes in the other matters I shall accept\nevery condition that he had in his mind--and that I may know of--in\neverything.\"  He looked exceedingly in earnest, and it gave me much\npleasure to see and hear him.  It was just what a young man should do who\nhad seen so generously treated.  As the time had now come, I gave him the\nbulky letter addressed to him, marked \"D\" which I had in my safe.  As I\nfulfilled my obligation in the matter, I said:\n\n\"You need not read the letter here.  You can take it away with you, and\nread it by yourself at leisure.  It is your own property, without any\nobligation whatever attached to it.  By the way, perhaps it would be well\nif you knew.  I have a copy sealed up in an envelope, and endorsed, 'To\nbe opened if occasion should arise,' but not otherwise.  Will you see me\nto-morrow, or, better still, dine with me alone here to-night?  I should\nlike to have a talk with you, and you may wish to ask me some questions.\"\nHe answered me cordially.  I actually felt touched by the way he said\ngood-bye before he went away.  Sir Colin MacKelpie went with him, as Sent\nLeger was to drop him at the Reform.\n\n_Letter from Roger Melton to Rupert Sent Leger_, _endorsed_ \"_D. re\nRupert Sent Leger_.  _To be given to him by Edward Bingham Trent if and\nas soon as he has declared_ (_formally or informally_) _his intention of\naccepting the conditions named in Letter B._, _forming Clause_ 10 _in my\nWill_.  _R.

The specific conditions\n    contained in Clause 10 of my Will have to be observed, for such I\n    deem to be of service to your own fortune; but herein I give my\n    advice, which you are at liberty to follow or not as you will, and my\n    wishes, which I shall try to explain fully and clearly, so that you\n    may be in possession of my views in case you should desire to carry\n    them out, or, at least, to so endeavour that the results I hope for\n    may be ultimately achieved.  First let me explain--for your\n    understanding and your guidance--that the power, or perhaps it had\n    better be called the pressure, behind the accumulation of my fortune\n    has been ambition.  In obedience to its compulsion, I toiled early\n    and late until I had so arranged matters that, subject to broad\n    supervision, my ideas could be carried out by men whom I had selected\n    and tested, and not found wanting.  This was for years to the\n    satisfaction, and ultimately to the accumulation by these men of\n    fortune commensurate in some measure to their own worth and their\n    importance to my designs.  Thus I had accumulated, whilst still a\n    young man, a considerable fortune.  This I have for over forty years\n    used sparingly as regards my personal needs, daringly with regard to\n    speculative investments.  With the latter I took such very great\n    care, studying the conditions surrounding them so thoroughly, that\n    even now my schedule of bad debts or unsuccessful investments is\n    almost a blank.  Perhaps by such means things flourished with me, and\n    wealth piled in so fast that at times I could hardly use it to\n    advantage.  This was all done as the forerunner of ambition, but I\n    was over fifty years of age when the horizon of ambition itself\n    opened up to me.  I speak thus freely, my dear Rupert, as when you\n    read it I shall have passed away, and not ambition nor the fear of\n    misunderstanding, nor even of scorn can touch me.  My ventures in\n    commerce and finance covered not only the Far East, but every foot of\n    the way to it, so that the Mediterranean and all its opening seas\n    were familiar to me.  In my journeyings up and down the Adriatic I\n    was always struck by the great beauty and seeming richness--native\n    richness--of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  At last Chance took me\n    into that delectable region.  When the \"Balkan Struggle\" of '90 was\n    on, one of the great Voivodes came to me in secret to arrange a large\n    loan for national purposes.  It was known in financial circles of\n    both Europe and Asia that I took an active part in the _haute\n    politique_ of national treasuries, and the Voivode Vissarion came to\n    me as to one able and willing to carry out his wishes.  After\n    confidential pour-parlers, he explained to me that his nation was in\n    the throes of a great crisis.  As you perhaps know, the gallant\n    little Nation in the Land of the Blue Mountains has had a strange\n    history.  For more than a thousand years--ever since its settlement\n    after the disaster of Rossoro--it had maintained its national\n    independence under several forms of Government.  At first it had a\n    King whose successors became so despotic that they were dethroned.\n    Then it was governed by its Voivodes, with the combining influence of\n    a Vladika somewhat similar in power and function to the\n    Prince-Bishops of Montenegro; afterwards by a Prince; or, as at\n    present, by an irregular elective Council, influenced in a modified\n    form by the Vladika, who was then supposed to exercise a purely\n    spiritual function.  Such a Council in a small, poor nation did not\n    have sufficient funds for armaments, which were not immediately and\n    imperatively necessary; and therefore the Voivode Vissarion, who had\n    vast estates in his own possession, and who was the present\n    representative a family which of old had been leaders in the land,\n    found it a duty to do on his own account that which the State could\n    not do.  For security as to the loan which he wished to get, and\n    which was indeed a vast one, he offered to sell me his whole estate\n    if I would secure to him a right to repurchase it within a given time\n    (a time which I may say has some time ago expired).  He made it a\n    condition that the sale and agreement should remain a strict secret\n    between us, as a widespread knowledge that his estate had changed\n    hands would in all probability result in my death and his own at the\n    hands of the mountaineers, who are beyond everything loyal, and were\n    jealous to the last degree.  An attack by Turkey was feared, and new\n    armaments were required; and the patriotic Voivode was sacrificing\n    his own great fortune for the public good.  What a sacrifice this was\n    he well knew, for in all discussions regarding a possible change in\n    the Constitution of the Blue Mountains it was always taken for\n    granted that if the principles of the Constitution should change to a\n    more personal rule, his own family should be regarded as the Most\n    Noble.  It had ever been on the side of freedom in olden time; before\n    the establishment of the Council, or even during the rule of the\n    Voivodes, the Vissarion had every now and again stood out against the\n    King or challenged the Princedom.  The very name stood for freedom,\n    for nationality, against foreign oppression; and the bold\n    mountaineers were devoted to it, as in other free countries men\n    follow the flag.\n\n    Such loyalty was a power and a help in the land, for it knew danger\n    in every form; and anything which aided the cohesion of its integers\n    was a natural asset.  On every side other powers, great and small,\n    pressed the land, anxious to acquire its suzerainty by any\n    means--fraud or force.  Greece, Turkey, Austria, Russia, Italy,\n    France, had all tried in vain.  Russia, often hurled back, was\n    waiting an opportunity to attack.  Austria and Greece, although\n    united by no common purpose or design, were ready to throw in their\n    forces with whomsoever might seem most likely to be victor.  Other\n    Balkan States, too, were not lacking in desire to add the little\n    territory of the Blue Mountains to their more ample possessions.\n    Albania, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Servia, Bulgaria, looked with lustful\n    eyes on the land, which was in itself a vast natural fortress, having\n    close under its shelter perhaps the finest harbour between Gibraltar\n    and the Dardanelles.\n\n    But the fierce, hardy mountaineers were unconquerable.  For centuries\n    they had fought, with a fervour and fury that nothing could withstand\n    or abate, attacks on their independence.  Time after time, century\n    after century, they had opposed with dauntless front invading armies\n    sent against them.  This unquenchable fire of freedom had had its\n    effect.  One and all, the great Powers knew that to conquer that\n    little nation would be no mean task, but rather that of a tireless\n    giant.  Over and over again had they fought with units against\n    hundreds, never ceasing until they had either wiped out their foes\n    entirely or seen them retreat across the frontier in diminished\n    numbers.\n\n    For many years past, however, the Land of the Blue Mountains had\n    remained unassailable, for all the Powers and States had feared lest\n    the others should unite against the one who should begin the attack.\n\n    At the time I speak of there was a feeling throughout the Blue\n    Mountains--and, indeed, elsewhere--that Turkey was preparing for a\n    war of offence.  The objective of her attack was not known anywhere,\n    but here there was evidence that the Turkish \"Bureau of Spies\" was in\n    active exercise towards their sturdy little neighbour.  To prepare\n    for this, the Voivode Peter Vissarion approached me in order to\n    obtain the necessary \"sinews of war.\"\n\n    The situation was complicated by the fact that the Elective Council\n    was at present largely held together by the old Greek Church, which\n    was the religion of the people, and which had had since the beginning\n    its destinies linked in a large degree with theirs.  Thus it was\n    possible that if a war should break out, it might easily\n    become--whatever might have been its cause or beginnings--a war of\n    creeds.  This in the Balkans must be largely one of races, the end of\n    which no mind could diagnose or even guess at.\n\n    I had now for some time had knowledge of the country and its people,\n    and had come to love them both.  The nobility of Vissarion's\n    self-sacrifice at once appealed to me, and I felt that I, too, should\n    like to have a hand in the upholding of such a land and such a\n    people.  They both deserved freedom.  When Vissarion handed me the\n    completed deed of sale I was going to tear it up; but he somehow\n    recognized my intention, and forestalled it.  He held up his hand\n    arrestingly as he said:\n\n    \"I recognize your purpose, and, believe me, I honour you for it from\n    the very depths of my soul.  But, my friend, it must not be.  Our\n    mountaineers are proud beyond belief.  Though they would allow\n    me--who am one of themselves, and whose fathers have been in some way\n    leaders and spokesmen amongst them for many centuries--to do all that\n    is in my power to do--and what, each and all, they would be glad to\n    do were the call to them--they would not accept aid from one outside\n    themselves.  My good friend, they would resent it, and might show to\n    you, who wish us all so well, active hostility, which might end in\n    danger, or even death.  That was why, my friend, I asked to put a\n    clause in our agreement, that I might have right to repurchase my\n    estate, regarding which you would fain act so generously.\"\n\n    Thus it is, my dear nephew Rupert, only son of my dear sister, that I\n    hereby charge you solemnly as you value me--as you value yourself--as\n    you value honour, that, should it ever become known that that noble\n    Voivode, Peter Vissarion, imperilled himself for his country's good,\n    and if it be of danger or evil repute to him that even for such a\n    purpose he sold his heritage, you shall at once and to the knowledge\n    of the mountaineers--though not necessarily to others--reconvey to\n    him or his heirs the freehold that he was willing to part with--and\n    that he has _de facto_ parted with by the effluxion of the time\n    during which his right of repurchase existed.  This is a secret trust\n    and duty which is between thee and me alone in the first instance; a\n    duty which I have undertaken on behalf of my heirs, and which must be\n    carried out, at whatsoever cost may ensue.  You must not take it that\n    it is from any mistrust of you or belief that you will fail that I\n    have taken another measure to insure that this my cherished idea is\n    borne out.  Indeed, it is that the law may, in case of need--for no\n    man can know what may happen after his own hand be taken from the\n    plough--be complied with, that I have in another letter written for\n    the guidance of others, directed that in case of any failure to carry\n    out this trust--death or other--the direction become a clause or\n    codicil to my Will.  But in the meantime I wish that this be kept a\n    secret between us two.  To show you the full extent of my confidence,\n    let me here tell you that the letter alluded to above is marked \"C,\"\n    and directed to my solicitor and co-executor, Edward Bingham Trent,\n    which is finally to be regarded as clause eleven of my Will.  To\n    which end he has my instructions and also a copy of this letter,\n    which is, in case of need, and that only, to be opened, and is to be\n    a guide to my wishes as to the carrying out by you of the conditions\n    on which you inherit.\n\n    And now, my dear nephew, let me change to another subject more dear\n    to me--yourself.  When you read this I shall have passed away, so\n    that I need not be hampered now by that reserve which I feel has\n    grown upon me through a long and self-contained life.  Your mother\n    was very dear to me.  As you know, she was twenty years younger than\n    her youngest brother, who was two years younger than me.  So we were\n    all young men when she was a baby, and, I need not say, a pet amongst\n    us--almost like our own child to each of us, as well as our sister.\n    You knew her sweetness and high quality, so I need say nothing of\n    these; but I should like you to understand that she was very dear to\n    me.  When she and your father came to know and love each other I was\n    far away, opening up a new branch of business in the interior of\n    China, and it was not for several months that I got home news.  When\n    I first heard of him they had already been married.  I was delighted\n    to find that they were very happy.  They needed nothing that I could\n    give.  When he died so suddenly I tried to comfort her, and all I had\n    was at her disposal, did she want it.  She was a proud woman--though\n    not with me.  She had come to understand that, though I seemed cold\n    and hard (and perhaps was so generally), I was not so to her.  But\n    she would not have help of any kind.  When I pressed her, she told me\n    that she had enough for your keep and education and her own\n    sustenance for the time she must still live; that your father and she\n    had agreed that you should be brought up to a healthy and strenuous\n    life rather than to one of luxury; and she thought that it would be\n    better for the development of your character that you should learn to\n    be self-reliant and to be content with what your dear father had left\n    you.  She had always been a wise and thoughtful girl, and now all her\n    wisdom and thought were for you, your father's and her child.  When\n    she spoke of you and your future, she said many things which I\n    thought memorable.  One of them I remember to this day.  It was\n    apropos of my saying that there is a danger of its own kind in\n    extreme poverty.  A young man might know too much want.  She answered\n    me: \"True!  That is so!  But there is a danger that overrides it;\"\n    and after a time went on:\n\n    \"It is better not to know wants than not to know want!\"  I tell you,\n    boy, that is a great truth, and I hope you will remember it for\n    yourself as well as a part of the wisdom of your mother.  And here\n    let me say something else which is a sort of corollary of that wise\n    utterance:\n\n    I dare say you thought me very hard and unsympathetic that time I\n    would not, as one of your trustees, agree to your transferring your\n    little fortune to Miss MacKelpie.  I dare say you bear a grudge\n    towards me about it up to this day.  Well, if you have any of that\n    remaining, put it aside when you know the truth.  That request of\n    yours was an unspeakable delight to me.  It was like your mother\n    coming back from the dead.  That little letter of yours made me wish\n    for the first time that I had a son--and that he should be like you.\n    I fell into a sort of reverie, thinking if I were yet too old to\n    marry, so that a son might be with me in my declining years--if such\n    were to ever be for me.  But I concluded that this might not be.\n    There was no woman whom I knew or had ever met with that I could love\n    as your mother loved your father and as he loved her.  So I resigned\n    myself to my fate.  I must go my lonely road on to the end.  And then\n    came a ray of light into my darkness: there was you.  Though you\n    might not feel like a son to me--I could not expect it when the\n    memory of that sweet relationship was more worthily filled.  But I\n    could feel like a father to you.  Nothing could prevent that or\n    interfere with it, for I would keep it as my secret in the very holy\n    of holies of my heart, where had been for thirty years the image of a\n    sweet little child--your mother.  My boy, when in your future life\n    you shall have happiness and honour and power, I hope you will\n    sometimes give a thought to the lonely old man whose later years your\n    very existence seemed to brighten.\n\n    The thought of your mother recalled me to my duty.  I had undertaken\n    for her a sacred task: to carry out her wishes regarding her son.  I\n    knew how she would have acted.  It might--would--have been to her a\n    struggle of inclination and duty; and duty would have won.  And so I\n    carried out my duty, though I tell you it was a harsh and bitter task\n    to me at the time.  But I may tell you that I have since been glad\n    when I think of the result.  I tried, as you may perhaps remember, to\n    carry out your wishes in another way, but your letter put the\n    difficulty of doing so so clearly before me that I had to give it up.\n    And let me tell you that that letter endeared you to me more than\n    ever.\n\n    I need not tell you that thenceforth I followed your life very\n    closely.  When you ran away to sea, I used in secret every part of\n    the mechanism of commerce to find out what had become of you.  Then,\n    until you had reached your majority, I had a constant watch kept upon\n    you--not to interfere with you in any way, but so that I might be\n    able to find you should need arise.  When in due course I heard of\n    your first act on coming of age I was satisfied.  I had to know of\n    the carrying out of your original intention towards Janet Mac Kelpie,\n    for the securities had to be transferred.\n\n    From that time on I watched--of course through other eyes--your chief\n    doings.  It would have been a pleasure to me to have been able to\n    help in carrying out any hope or ambition of yours, but I realized\n    that in the years intervening between your coming of age and the\n    present moment you were fulfilling your ideas and ambitions in your\n    own way, and, as I shall try to explain to you presently, my\n    ambitions also.  You were of so adventurous a nature that even my own\n    widely-spread machinery of acquiring information--what I may call my\n    private \"intelligence department\"--was inadequate.  My machinery was\n    fairly adequate for the East--in great part, at all events.  But you\n    went North and South, and West also, and, in addition, you essayed\n    realms where commerce and purely real affairs have no\n    foothold--worlds of thought, of spiritual import, of psychic\n    phenomena--speaking generally, of mysteries.  As now and again I was\n    baffled in my inquiries, I had to enlarge my mechanism, and to this\n    end started--not in my own name, of course--some new magazines\n    devoted to certain branches of inquiry and adventure.  Should you\n    ever care to know more of these things, Mr. Trent, in whose name the\n    stock is left, will be delighted to give you all details.  Indeed,\n    these stocks, like all else I have, shall be yours when the time\n    comes, if you care to ask for them.  By means of _The Journal of\n    Adventure_, _The Magazine of Mystery_, _Occultism_, _Balloon and\n    Aeroplane_, _The Submarine_, _Jungle and Pampas_, _The Ghost World_,\n    _The Explorer_, _Forest and Island_, _Ocean and Creek_, I was often\n    kept informed when I should otherwise have been ignorant of your\n    whereabouts and designs.  For instance, when you had disappeared into\n    the Forest of the Incas, I got the first whisper of your strange\n    adventures and discoveries in the buried cities of Eudori from a\n    correspondent of _The Journal of Adventure_ long before the details\n    given in _The Times_ of the rock-temple of the primeval savages,\n    where only remained the little dragon serpents, whose giant ancestors\n    were rudely sculptured on the sacrificial altar.  I well remember how\n    I thrilled at even that meagre account of your going in alone into\n    that veritable hell.  It was from _Occultism_ that I learned how you\n    had made a stay alone in the haunted catacombs of Elora, in the far\n    recesses of the Himalayas, and of the fearful experiences which, when\n    you came out shuddering and ghastly, overcame to almost epileptic\n    fear those who had banded themselves together to go as far as the\n    rock-cut approach to the hidden temple.\n\n    All such things I read with rejoicing.  You were shaping yourself for\n    a wider and loftier adventure, which would crown more worthily your\n    matured manhood.  When I read of you in a description of Mihask, in\n    Madagascar, and the devil-worship there rarely held, I felt I had\n    only to wait for your home-coming in order to broach the enterprise I\n    had so long contemplated.  This was what I read:\n\n    \"He is a man to whom no adventure is too wild or too daring.  His\n    reckless bravery is a byword amongst many savage peoples and amongst\n    many others not savages, whose fears are not of material things, but\n    of the world of mysteries in and beyond the grave.  He dares not only\n    wild animals and savage men; but has tackled African magic and Indian\n    mysticism.  The Psychical Research Society has long exploited his\n    deeds of valiance, and looked upon him as perhaps their most trusted\n    agent or source of discovery.  He is in the very prime of life, of\n    almost giant stature and strength, trained to the use of all arms of\n    all countries, inured to every kind of hardship, subtle-minded and\n    resourceful, understanding human nature from its elemental form up.\n    To say that he is fearless would be inadequate.  In a word, he is a\n    man whose strength and daring fit him for any enterprise of any kind.\n    He would dare and do anything in the world or out of it, on the earth\n    or under it, in the sea or--in the air, fearing nothing material or\n    unseen, not man or ghost, nor God nor Devil.\"\n\n    If you ever care to think of it, I carried that cutting in my\n    pocket-book from that hour I read it till now.\n\n    Remember, again, I say, that I never interfered in the slightest way\n    in any of your adventures.  I wanted you to \"dree your own weird,\" as\n    the Scotch say; and I wanted to know of it--that was all.  Now, as I\n    hold you fully equipped for greater enterprise, I want to set your\n    feet on the road and to provide you with the most potent\n    weapon--beyond personal qualities--for the winning of great honour--a\n    gain, my dear nephew, which, I am right sure, does and will appeal to\n    you as it has ever done to me.  I have worked for it for more than\n    fifty years; but now that the time has come when the torch is\n    slipping from my old hands, I look to you, my dearest kinsman, to\n    lift it and carry it on.\n\n    The little nation of the Blue Mountains has from the first appealed\n    to me.  It is poor and proud and brave.  Its people are well worth\n    winning, and I would advise you to throw in your lot with them.  You\n    may find them hard to win, for when peoples, like individuals, are\n    poor and proud, these qualities are apt to react on each other to an\n    endless degree.  These men are untamable, and no one can ever succeed\n    with them unless he is with them in all-in-all, and is a leader\n    recognized.  But if you can win them they are loyal to death.  If you\n    are ambitious--and I know you are--there may be a field for you in\n    such a country.  With your qualifications, fortified by the fortune\n    which I am happy enough to be able to leave you, you may dare much\n    and go far.  Should I be alive when you return from your exploration\n    in Northern South America, I may have the happiness of helping you to\n    this or any other ambition, and I shall deem it a privilege to share\n    it with you; but time is going on.  I am in my seventy-second year .\n    . . the years of man are three-score and ten--I suppose you\n    understand; I do . . . Let me point out this: For ambitious projects\n    the great nationalities are impossible to a stranger--and in our own\n    we are limited by loyalty (and common-sense).  It is only in a small\n    nation that great ambitions can be achieved.  If you share my own\n    views and wishes, the Blue Mountains is your ground.  I hoped at one\n    time that I might yet become a Voivode--even a great one.  But age\n    has dulled my personal ambitions as it has cramped my powers.  I no\n    longer dream of such honour for myself, though I do look on it as a\n    possibility for you if you care for it.  Through my Will you will\n    have a great position and a great estate, and though you may have to\n    yield up the latter in accordance with my wish, as already expressed\n    in this letter, the very doing so will give you an even greater hold\n    than this possession in the hearts of the mountaineers, should they\n    ever come to know it.  Should it be that at the time you inherit from\n    me the Voivode Vissarion should not be alive, it may serve or aid you\n    to know that in such case you would be absolved from any conditions\n    of mine, though I trust you would in that, as in all other matters,\n    hold obligation enforced by your own honour as to my wishes.\n    Therefore the matter stands thus: If Vissarion lives, you will\n    relinquish the estates.  Should such not be the case, you will act as\n    you believe that I would wish you to.  In either case the\n    mountaineers should not know from you in any way of the secret\n    contracts between Vissarion and myself.  Enlightenment of the many\n    should (if ever) come from others than yourself.  And unless such\n    take place, you would leave the estates without any _quid pro quo_\n    whatever.  This you need not mind, for the fortune you will inherit\n    will leave you free and able to purchase other estates in the Blue\n    Mountains or elsewhere that you may select in the world.\n\n    If others attack, attack them, and quicker and harder than they can,\n    if such be a possibility.  Should it ever be that you inherit the\n    Castle of Vissarion on the Spear of Ivan, remember that I had it\n    secretly fortified and armed against attack.  There are not only\n    massive grilles, but doors of chilled bronze where such be needed.\n    My adherent Rooke, who has faithfully served me for nearly forty\n    years, and has gone on my behalf on many perilous expeditions, will,\n    I trust, serve you in the same way.  Treat him well for my sake, if\n    not for your own.  I have left him provision for a life of ease; but\n    he would rather take a part in dangerous enterprises.  He is silent\n    as the grave and as bold as a lion.  He knows every detail of the\n    fortification and of the secret means of defence.  A word in your\n    ear--he was once a pirate.  He was then in his extreme youth, and\n    long since changed his ways in this respect; but from this fact you\n    can understand his nature.  You will find him useful should occasion\n    ever arise.  Should you accept the conditions of my letter, you are\n    to make the Blue Mountains--in part, at least--your home, living\n    there a part of the year, if only for a week, as in England men of\n    many estates share the time amongst them.  To this you are not bound,\n    and no one shall have power to compel you or interfere with you.  I\n    only express a hope.  But one thing I do more than hope--I desire, if\n    you will honour my wishes, that, come what may, you are to keep your\n    British nationality, unless by special arrangement with and consent\n    of the Privy Council.  Such arrangement to be formally made by my\n    friend, Edward Bingham Trent, or whomsoever he may appoint by deed or\n    will to act in the matter, and made in such a way that no act save\n    that alone of Parliament in all its estates, and endorsed by the\n    King, may or can prevail against it.\n\n    My last word to you is, Be bold and honest, and fear not.  Most\n    things--even kingship--_somewhere_ may now and again be won by the\n    sword.  A brave heart and a strong arm may go far.  But whatever is\n    so won cannot be held merely by the sword.  Justice alone can hold in\n    the long run.  Where men trust they will follow, and the rank and\n    file of people want to follow, not to lead.  If it be your fortune to\n    lead, be bold.  Be wary, if you will; exercise any other faculties\n    that may aid or guard.  Shrink from nothing.  Avoid nothing that is\n    honourable in itself.  Take responsibility when such presents itself.\n    What others shrink from, accept.  That is to be great in what world,\n    little or big, you move.  Fear nothing, no matter of what kind danger\n    may be or whence it come.  The only real way to meet danger is to\n    despise it--except with your brains.  Meet it in the gate, not the\n    hall.\n\n    My kinsman, the name of my race and your own, worthily mingled in\n    your own person, now rests with you!\n\n_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger_, 32 _Bodmin Street_, _Victoria_, _S.W._,\n_to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_, _Ross-shire_.\n\n                                                        _January_ 3, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,\n\n    You will, I know, be rejoiced to hear of the great good-fortune which\n    has come to me through the Will of Uncle Roger.  Perhaps Sir Colin\n    will have written to you, as he is one of the executors, and there is\n    a bequest to you, so I must not spoil his pleasure of telling you of\n    that part himself.  Unfortunately, I am not free to speak fully of my\n    own legacy yet, but I want you to know that at worst I am to receive\n    an amount many times more than I ever dreamt of possessing through\n    any possible stroke of fortune.  So soon as I can leave\n    London--where, of course, I must remain until things are settled--I\n    am coming up to Croom to see you, and I hope I shall by then be able\n    to let you know so much that you will be able to guess at the\n    extraordinary change that has come to my circumstances.  It is all\n    like an impossible dream: there is nothing like it in the \"Arabian\n    Nights.\"  However, the details must wait, I am pledged to secrecy for\n    the present.  And you must be pledged too.  You won't mind, dear,\n    will you?  What I want to do at present is merely to tell you of my\n    own good-fortune, and that I shall be going presently to live for a\n    while at Vissarion.  Won't you come with me, Aunt Janet?  We shall\n    talk more of this when I come to Croom; but I want you to keep the\n    subject in your mind.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_From Rupert Sent Leger's Journal_.\n\n                                                        _January_ 4, 1907.\n\n    Things have been humming about me so fast that I have had hardly time\n    to think.  But some of the things have been so important, and have so\n    changed my entire outlook on life, that it may be well to keep some\n    personal record of them.  I may some day want to remember some\n    detail--perhaps the sequence of events, or something like that--and\n    it may be useful.  It ought to be, if there is any justice in things,\n    for it will be an awful swot to write it when I have so many things\n    to think of now.  Aunt Janet, I suppose, will like to keep it locked\n    up for me, as she does with all my journals and papers.  That is one\n    good thing about Aunt Janet amongst many: she has no curiosity, or\n    else she has some other quality which keeps her from prying as other\n    women would.  It would seem that she has not so much as opened the\n    cover of one of my journals ever in her life, and that she would not\n    without my permission.  So this can in time go to her also.\n\n    I dined last night with Mr. Trent, by his special desire.  The dinner\n    was in his own rooms.  Dinner sent in from the hotel.  He would not\n    have any waiters at all, but made them send in the dinner all at\n    once, and we helped ourselves.  As we were quite alone, we could talk\n    freely, and we got over a lot of ground while we were dining.  He\n    began to tell me about Uncle Roger.  I was glad of that, for, of\n    course, I wanted to know all I could of him, and the fact was I had\n    seen very little of him.  Of course, when I was a small kid he was\n    often in our house, for he was very fond of mother, and she of him.\n    But I fancy that a small boy was rather a nuisance to him.  And then\n    I was at school, and he was away in the East.  And then poor mother\n    died while he was living in the Blue Mountains, and I never saw him\n    again.  When I wrote to him about Aunt Janet he answered me very\n    kindly but he was so very just in the matter that I got afraid of\n    him.  And after that I ran away, and have been roaming ever since; so\n    there was never a chance of our meeting.  But that letter of his has\n    opened my eyes.  To think of him following me that way all over the\n    world, waiting to hold out a helping hand if I should want it, I only\n    wish I had known, or even suspected, the sort of man he was, and how\n    he cared for me, and I would sometimes have come back to see him, if\n    I had to come half round the world.  Well, all I can do now is to\n    carry out his wishes; that will be my expiation for my neglect.  He\n    knew what he wanted exactly, and I suppose I shall come in time to\n    know it all and understand it, too.\n\n    I was thinking something like this when Mr. Trent began to talk, so\n    that all he said fitted exactly into my own thought.  The two men\n    were evidently great friends--I should have gathered that, anyhow,\n    from the Will--and the letters--so I was not surprised when Mr. Trent\n    told me that they had been to school together, Uncle Roger being a\n    senior when he was a junior; and had then and ever after shared each\n    other's confidence.  Mr. Trent, I gathered, had from the very first\n    been in love with my mother, even when she was a little girl; but he\n    was poor and shy, and did not like to speak.  When he had made up his\n    mind to do so, he found that she had by then met my father, and could\n    not help seeing that they loved each other.  So he was silent.  He\n    told me he had never said a word about it to anyone--not even to my\n    Uncle Roger, though he knew from one thing and another, though he\n    never spoke of it, that he would like it.  I could not help seeing\n    that the dear old man regarded me in a sort of parental way--I have\n    heard of such romantic attachments being transferred to the later\n    generation.  I was not displeased with it; on the contrary, I liked\n    him better for it.  I love my mother so much--I always think of her\n    in the present--that I cannot think of her as dead.  There is a tie\n    between anyone else who loved her and myself.  I tried to let Mr.\n    Trent see that I liked him, and it pleased him so much that I could\n    see his liking for me growing greater.  Before we parted he told me\n    that he was going to give up business.  He must have understood how\n    disappointed I was--for how could I ever get along at all without\n    him?--for he said, as he laid a hand quite affectionately, I\n    thought--on my shoulder:\n\n    \"I shall have one client, though, whose business I always hope to\n    keep, and for whom I shall be always whilst I live glad to act--if he\n    will have me.\"  I did not care to speak as I took his hand.  He\n    squeezed mine, too, and said very earnestly:\n\n    \"I served your uncle's interests to the very best of my ability for\n    nearly fifty years.  He had full confidence in me, and I was proud of\n    his trust.  I can honestly say, Rupert--you won't mind me using that\n    familiarity, will you?--that, though the interests which I guarded\n    were so vast that without abusing my trust I could often have used my\n    knowledge to my personal advantage, I never once, in little matters\n    or big, abused that trust--no, not even rubbed the bloom off it.  And\n    now that he has remembered me in his Will so generously that I need\n    work no more, it will be a very genuine pleasure and pride to me to\n    carry out as well as I can the wishes that I partly knew, and now\n    realize more fully towards you, his nephew.\"\n\n    In the long chat which we had, and which lasted till midnight, he\n    told me many very interesting things about Uncle Roger.  When, in the\n    course of conversation, he mentioned that the fortune Uncle Roger\n    left must be well over a hundred millions, I was so surprised that I\n    said out loud--I did not mean to ask a question:\n\n    \"How on earth could a man beginning with nothing realize such a\n    gigantic fortune?\"\n\n    \"By all honest ways,\" he answered, \"and his clever human insight.  He\n    knew one half of the world, and so kept abreast of all public and\n    national movements that he knew the critical moment to advance money\n    required.  He was always generous, and always on the side of freedom.\n    There are nations at this moment only now entering on the\n    consolidation of their liberty, who owe all to him, who knew when and\n    how to help.  No wonder that in some lands they will drink to his\n    memory on great occasions as they used to drink his health.\"\n\n    \"As you and I shall do now, sir!\" I said, as I filled my glass and\n    stood up.  We drank it in bumpers.  We did not say a word, either of\n    us; but the old gentleman held out his hand, and I took it.  And so,\n    holding hands, we drank in silence.  It made me feel quite choky; and\n    I could see that he, too, was moved.\n\n_From E. B. Trent's Memoranda_.\n\n                                                        _January_ 4, 1907.\n\n    I asked Mr. Rupert Sent Leger to dine with me at my office alone, as\n    I wished to have a chat with him.  To-morrow Sir Colin and I will\n    have a formal meeting with him for the settlement of affairs, but I\n    thought it best to have an informal talk with him alone first, as I\n    wished to tell him certain matters which will make our meeting\n    to-morrow more productive of utility, as he can now have more full\n    understanding of the subjects which we have to discuss.  Sir Colin is\n    all that can be in manhood, and I could wish no better colleague in\n    the executorship of this phenomenal Will; but he has not had the\n    privilege of a lifelong friendship with the testator as I have had.\n    And as Rupert Sent Leger had to learn intimate details regarding his\n    uncle, I could best make my confidences alone.  To-morrow we shall\n    have plenty of formality.  I was delighted with Rupert.  He is just\n    what I could have wished his mother's boy to be--or a son of my own\n    to be, had I had the good-fortune to have been a father.  But this is\n    not for me.  I remember long, long ago reading a passage in Lamb's\n    Essays which hangs in my mind: \"The children of Alice call Bartrum\n    father.\"  Some of my old friends would laugh to see _me_ write this,\n    but these memoranda are for my eyes alone, and no one shall see them\n    till after my death, unless by my own permission.  The boy takes some\n    qualities after his father; he has a daring that is disturbing to an\n    old dryasdust lawyer like me.  But somehow I like him more than I\n    ever liked anyone--any man--in my life--more even than his uncle, my\n    old friend, Roger Melton; and Lord knows I had much cause to like\n    him.  I have more than ever now.  It was quite delightful to see the\n    way the young adventurer was touched by his uncle's thought of him.\n    He is a truly gallant fellow, but venturesome exploits have not\n    affected the goodness of heart.  It is a pleasure to me to think that\n    Roger and Colin came together apropos of the boy's thoughtful\n    generosity towards Miss MacKelpie.  The old soldier will be a good\n    friend to him, or I am much mistaken.  With an old lawyer like me,\n    and an old soldier like him, and a real old gentlewoman like Miss\n    MacKelpie, who loves the very ground he walks on, to look after him,\n    together with all his own fine qualities and his marvellous\n    experience of the world, and the gigantic wealth that will surely be\n    his, that young man will go far.\n\n_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                        _January_ 5, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,\n\n    It is all over--the first stage of it; and that is as far as I can\n    get at present.  I shall have to wait for a few days--or it may be\n    weeks--in London for the doing of certain things now necessitated by\n    my acceptance of Uncle Roger's bequest.  But as soon as I can, dear,\n    I shall come down to Croom and spend with you as many days as\n    possible.  I shall then tell you all I am at liberty to tell, and I\n    shall thank you personally for your consent to come with me to\n    Vissarion.  Oh, how I wish my dear mother had lived to be with us!\n    It would have made her happy, I know, to have come; and then we three\n    who shared together the old dear, hard days would have shared in the\n    same way the new splendour.  I would try to show all my love and\n    gratitude to you both . . . You must take the whole burden of it now,\n    dear, for you and I are alone.  No, not alone, as we used to be, for\n    I have now two old friends who are already dear to me.  One is so to\n    you already.  Sir Colin is simply splendid, and so, in his own way,\n    is Mr. Trent.  I am lucky, Aunt Janet, to have two such men to think\n    of affairs for me.  Am I not?  I shall send you a wire as soon as\n    ever I can see my way to get through my work; and I want you to think\n    over all the things you ever wished for in your life, so that I\n    may--if there is any mortal way of doing so--get them for you.  You\n    will not stand in the way of my having this great pleasure, will you,\n    dear?  Good-bye.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_E. B. Trent's Memoranda_.\n\n                                                        _January_ 6, 1907.\n\n    The formal meeting of Sir Colin and myself with Rupert Sent Leger\n    went off quite satisfactorily.  From what he had said yesterday, and\n    again last night, I had almost come to expect an unreserved\n    acceptance of everything stated or implied in Roger Melton's Will;\n    but when we had sat round the table--this appeared, by the way, to be\n    a formality for which we were all prepared, for we sat down as if by\n    instinct--the very first words he said were:\n\n    \"As I suppose I must go through this formality, I may as well say at\n    once that I accept every possible condition which was in the mind of\n    Uncle Roger; and to this end I am prepared to sign, seal, and\n    deliver--or whatever is the ritual--whatever document you,\n    sir\"--turning to me--\"may think necessary or advisable, and of which\n    you both approve.\"  He stood up and walked about the room for a few\n    moments, Sir Colin and I sitting quite still, silent.  He came back\n    to his seat, and after a few seconds of nervousness--a rare thing\n    with him, I fancy--said: \"I hope you both understand--of course, I\n    know you do; I only speak because this is an occasion for\n    formality--that I am willing to accept, and at once!  I do so,\n    believe me, not to get possession of this vast fortune, but because\n    of him who has given it.  The man who was fond of me, and who trusted\n    me, and yet had strength to keep his own feelings in check--who\n    followed me in spirit to far lands and desperate adventures, and who,\n    though he might be across the world from me, was ready to put out a\n    hand to save or help me, was no common man; and his care of my\n    mother's son meant no common love for my dear mother.  And so she and\n    I together accept his trust, come of it what may.  I have been\n    thinking it over all night, and all the time I could not get out of\n    the idea that mother was somewhere near me.  The only thought that\n    could debar me from doing as I wished to do--and intend to do--would\n    be that she would not approve.  Now that I am satisfied she would\n    approve, I accept.  Whatever may result or happen, I shall go on\n    following the course that he has set for me.  So help me, God!\"  Sir\n    Colin stood up, and I must say a more martial figure I never saw.  He\n    was in full uniform, for he was going on to the King's levee after\n    our business.  He drew his sword from the scabbard and laid it naked\n    on the table before Rupert, and said:\n\n    \"You are going, sir, into a strange and danger country--I have been\n    reading about it since we met--and you will be largely alone amongst\n    fierce mountaineers who resent the very presence of a stranger, and\n    to whom you are, and must be, one.  If you should ever be in any\n    trouble and want a man to stand back to back with you, I hope you\n    will give me the honour!\"  As he said this pointed to his sword.\n    Rupert and I were also standing now--one cannot sit down in the\n    presence of such an act as that.  \"You are, I am proud to say, allied\n    with my family: and I only wish to God it was closer to myself.\"\n    Rupert took him by the hand and bent his head before him as answered:\n\n    \"The honour is mine, Sir Colin; and no greater can come to any man\n    than that which you have just done me.  The best way I can show how I\n    value it will be to call on you if I am ever in such a tight place.\n    By Jove, sir, this is history repeating itself.  Aunt Janet used to\n    tell me when I was a youngster how MacKelpie of Croom laid his sword\n    before Prince Charlie.  I hope I may tell her of this; it would make\n    her so proud and happy.  Don't imagine, sir, that I am thinking\n    myself a Charles Edward.  It is only that Aunt Janet is so good to me\n    that I might well think I was.\"\n\n    Sir Colin bowed grandly:\n\n    \"Rupert Sent Leger, my dear niece is a woman of great discretion and\n    discernment.  And, moreover, I am thinking she has in her some of the\n    gift of Second Sight that has been a heritage of our blood.  And I am\n    one with my niece--in everything!\"  The whole thing was quite regal\n    in manner; it seemed to take me back to the days of the Pretender.\n\n    It was not, however, a time for sentiment, but for action--we had met\n    regarding the future, not the past; so I produced the short document\n    I had already prepared.  On the strength of his steadfast declaration\n    that he would accept the terms of the Will and the secret letters, I\n    had got ready a formal acceptance.  When I had once again formally\n    asked Mr. Sent Leger's wishes, and he had declared his wish to\n    accept, I got in a couple of my clerks as witnesses.\n\n    Then, having again asked him in their presence if it was his wish to\n    declare acceptance of the conditions, the document was signed and\n    witnessed, Sir Colin and I both appending our signatures to the\n    Attestation.\n\n    And so the first stage of Rupert Sent Leger's inheritance is\n    completed.  The next step will not have to be undertaken on my part\n    until the expiration of six months from his entry on his estate at\n    Vissarion.  As he announces his intention of going within a\n    fortnight, this will mean practically a little over six months from\n    now.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II: VISSARION\n\n\n_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger_, _Castle of Vissarion_, _the Spear of\nIvan_, _Land of the Blue Mountains_, _to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom\nCastle_, _Ross-shire_, _N.B._\n\n                                                       _January_ 23, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,\n\n    As you see, I am here at last.  Having got my formal duty done, as\n    you made me promise--my letters reporting arrival to Sir Colin and\n    Mr. Trent are lying sealed in front of me ready to post (for nothing\n    shall go before yours)--I am free to speak to you.\n\n    This is a most lovely place, and I hope you will like it.  I am quite\n    sure you will.  We passed it in the steamer coming from Trieste to\n    Durazzo.  I knew the locality from the chart, and it was pointed out\n    to me by one of the officers with whom I had become quite friendly,\n    and who kindly showed me interesting places whenever we got within\n    sight of shore.  The Spear of Ivan, on which the Castle stands, is a\n    headland running well out into the sea.  It is quite a peculiar\n    place--a sort of headland on a headland, jutting out into a deep,\n    wide bay, so that, though it is a promontory, it is as far away from\n    the traffic of coast life as anything you can conceive.  The main\n    promontory is the end of a range of mountains, and looms up vast,\n    towering over everything, a mass of sapphire blue.  I can well\n    understand how the country came to be called the \"Land of the Blue\n    Mountains,\" for it is all mountains, and they are all blue!  The\n    coast-line is magnificent--what is called \"iron-bound\"--being all\n    rocky; sometimes great frowning precipices; sometimes jutting spurs\n    of rock; again little rocky islets, now and again clad with trees and\n    verdure, at other places stark and bare.  Elsewhere are little rocky\n    bays and indentations--always rock, and often with long, interesting\n    caves.  Some of the shores of the bays are sandy, or else ridges of\n    beautiful pebbles, where the waves make endless murmur.\n\n    But of all the places I have seen--in this land or any other--the\n    most absolutely beautiful is Vissarion.  It stands at the ultimate\n    point of the promontory--I mean the little, or, rather, lesser\n    promontory--that continues on the spur of the mountain range.  For\n    the lesser promontory or extension of the mountain is in reality\n    vast; the lowest bit of cliff along the sea-front is not less than a\n    couple of hundred feet high.  That point of rock is really very\n    peculiar.  I think Dame Nature must, in the early days of her\n    housekeeping--or, rather, house-_building_--have intended to give her\n    little child, man, a rudimentary lesson in self-protection.  It is\n    just a natural bastion such as a titanic Vauban might have designed\n    in primeval times.  So far as the Castle is concerned, it is alone\n    visible from the sea.  Any enemy approaching could see only that\n    frowning wall of black rock, of vast height and perpendicular\n    steepness.  Even the old fortifications which crown it are not built,\n    but cut in the solid rock.  A long narrow creek of very deep water,\n    walled in by high, steep cliffs, runs in behind the Castle, bending\n    north and west, making safe and secret anchorage.  Into the creek\n    falls over a precipice a mountain-stream, which never fails in volume\n    of water.  On the western shore of that creek is the Castle, a huge\n    pile of buildings of every style of architecture, from the Twelfth\n    century to where such things seemed to stop in this dear old-world\n    land--about the time of Queen Elizabeth.  So it is pretty\n    picturesque.  I can tell you.  When we got the first glimpse of the\n    place from the steamer the officer, with whom I was on the bridge,\n    pointed towards it and said:\n\n    \"That is where we saw the dead woman floating in a coffin.\"  That was\n    rather interesting, so I asked him all about it.  He took from his\n    pocket-book a cutting from an Italian paper, which he handed to me.\n    As I can read and speak Italian fairly well, it was all right; but as\n    you, my dear Aunt Janet, are not skilled in languages, and as I doubt\n    if there is any assistance of the kind to be had at Croom, I do not\n    send it.  But as I have heard that the item has been produced in the\n    last number of _The Journal of Occultism_, you will be easily able to\n    get it.  As he handed me the cutting he said: \"I am Destilia!\"  His\n    story was so strange that I asked him a good many questions about it.\n    He answered me quite frankly on every point, but always adhering\n    stoutly to the main point--namely, that it was no phantom or mirage,\n    no dream or imperfect vision in a fog.  \"We were four in all who saw\n    it,\" he said--\"three from the bridge and the Englishman,\n    Caulfield--from the bows--whose account exactly agreed with what we\n    saw.  Captain Mirolani and Falamano and I were all awake and in good\n    trim.  We looked with our night-glasses, which are more than usually\n    powerful.  You know, we need good glasses for the east shore of the\n    Adriatic and for among the islands to the south.  There was a full\n    moon and a brilliant light.  Of course we were a little way off, for\n    though the Spear of Ivan is in deep water, one has to be careful of\n    currents, for it is in just such places that the dangerous currents\n    run.\"  The agent of Lloyd's told me only a few weeks ago that it was\n    only after a prolonged investigation of the tidal and sea currents\n    that the house decided to except from ordinary sea risks losses due\n    to a too close course by the Spear of Ivan.  When I tried to get a\n    little more definite account of the coffin-boat and the dead lady\n    that is given in _The Journal of Occultism_ he simply shrugged his\n    shoulders.  \"Signor, it is all,\" he said.  \"That Englishman wrote\n    everything after endless questioning.\"\n\n    So you see, my dear, that our new home is not without superstitious\n    interests of its own.  It is rather a nice idea, is it not, to have a\n    dead woman cruising round our promontory in a coffin?  I doubt if\n    even at Croom you can beat that.  \"Makes the place kind of homey,\" as\n    an American would say.  When you come, Aunt Janet, you will not feel\n    lonesome, at any rate, and it will save us the trouble of importing\n    some of your Highland ghosts to make you feel at home in the new\n    land.  I don't know, but we might ask the stiff to come to tea with\n    us.  Of course, it would be a late tea.  Somewhere between midnight\n    and cock-crow would be about the etiquette of the thing, I fancy!\n\n    But I must tell you all the realities of the Castle and around it.\n    So I will write again within a day or two, and try to let you know\n    enough to prepare you for coming here.  Till then adieu, my dear.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                       _January_ 25, 1907.\n\n    I hope I did not frighten you, dear Aunt Janet, by the yarn of the\n    lady in the coffin.  But I know you are not afraid; you have told me\n    too many weird stories for me to dread that.  Besides, you have\n    Second Sight--latent, at all events.  However, there won't be any\n    more ghosts, or about ghosts, in this letter.  I want to tell you all\n    about our new home.  I am so glad you are coming out so soon; I am\n    beginning to feel so lonesome--I walk about sometimes aimlessly, and\n    find my thoughts drifting in such an odd way.  If I didn't know\n    better, I might begin to think I was in love!  There is no one here\n    to be in love with; so make your mind easy, Aunt Janet.  Not that you\n    would be unhappy, I know, dear, if I _did_ fall in love.  I suppose I\n    must marry some day.  It is a duty now, I know, when there is such an\n    estate as Uncle Roger has left me.  And I know this: I shall never\n    marry any woman unless I love her.  And I am right sure that if I do\n    love her you will love her, too, Aunt Janet!  Won't you, dear?  It\n    wouldn't be half a delight if you didn't.  It won't if you don't.\n    There, now!\n\n    But before I begin to describe Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you\n    as a chatelaine; that may give you patience to read the rest.  The\n    Castle needs a lot of things to make it comfortable--as you would\n    consider it.  In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a\n    domestic nature.  Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and\n    so far it could stand a siege.  But it couldn't cook a dinner or go\n    through a spring-cleaning!  As you know, I am not much up in domestic\n    matters, and so I cannot give you details; but you may take it that\n    it wants everything.  I don't mean furniture, or silver, or even\n    gold-plate, or works of art, for it is full of the most magnificent\n    old things that you can imagine.  I think Uncle Roger must have been\n    a collector, and gathered a lot of good things in all sorts of\n    places, stored them for years, and then sent them here.  But as to\n    glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household\n    appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the\n    simplest--there are none.  I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived\n    here more than on a temporary picnic.  So far as I only am concerned,\n    I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all _I_ want--and I can\n    use them myself.  But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it.\n    I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the\n    very best.  Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and\n    so I want you to order all.  I know you, dear--being a woman--won't\n    object to shopping.  But it will have to be wholesale.  This is an\n    enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a\n    quicksand.  Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you\n    can.  Don't be afraid of getting too much.  You can't, or of being\n    idle when you are here.  I assure you that when you come there will\n    be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to\n    get away from it all.  And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be\n    too long.  Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is\n    lonely, and wants you.  And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS.\n    I don't altogether like doing so, lest I should offend a\n    millionairess like you; but it may facilitate matters, and the way's\n    of commerce are strict, though devious.  So I send you a cheque for\n    1,000 pounds for the little things: and a letter to the bank to\n    honour your own cheques for any amount I have got.\n\n    I think, by the way, I should, if I were you, take or send out a few\n    servants--not too many at first, only just enough to attend on our\n    two selves.  You can arrange to send for any more you may want later.\n    Engage them, and arrange for their being paid--when they are in our\n    service we must treat them well--and then they can be at our call as\n    you find that we want them.  I think you should secure, say, fifty or\n    a hundred--'tis an awfu' big place, Aunt Janet!  And in the same way\n    will you secure--and, of course, arrange for pay similarly--a hundred\n    men, exclusive of any servants you think it well to have.  I should\n    like the General, if he can give the time, to choose or pass them.  I\n    want clansmen that I can depend on, if need be.  We are going to live\n    in a country which is at present strange to us, and it is well to\n    look things in the face.  I know Sir Colin will only have men who are\n    a credit to Scotland and to Ross and to Croom--men who will impress\n    the Blue Mountaineers.  I know they will take them to their\n    hearts--certainly if any of them are bachelors the girls will!\n    Forgive me!  But if we are to settle here, our followers will\n    probably want to settle also.  Moreover, the Blue Mountaineers may\n    want followers also!  And will want them to settle, too, and have\n    successors!\n\n    Now for the description of the place.  Well, I simply can't just now.\n    It is all so wonderful and so beautiful.  The Castle--I have written\n    so much already about other things that I really must keep the Castle\n    for another letter!  Love to Sir Colin if he is at Croom.  And oh,\n    dear Aunt Janet, how I wish that my dear mother was coming out!  It\n    all seems so dark and empty without her.  How she would have enjoyed\n    it!  How proud she would have been!  And, my dear, if she could be\n    with us again, how grateful she would have been to you for all you\n    have done for her boy!  As I am, believe me, most truly and sincerely\n    and affectionately grateful.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                       _January_ 26, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,\n\n    Please read this as if it was a part of the letter I wrote yesterday.\n\n    The Castle itself is so vast that I really can't describe it in\n    detail.  So I am waiting till you come; and then you and I will go\n    over it together and learn all that we can about it.  We shall take\n    Rooke with us, and, as he is supposed to know every part of it, from\n    the keep to the torture-chamber, we can spend a few days over it.  Of\n    course, I have been over most of it, since I came--that, is, I went\n    at various times to see different portions--the battlements, the\n    bastions, the old guard-room, the hall, the chapel, the walls, the\n    roof.  And I have been through some of the network of rock passages.\n    Uncle Roger must have spent a mint of money on it, so far as I can\n    see; and though I am not a soldier, I have been in so many places\n    fortified in different ways that I am not entirely ignorant of the\n    subject.  He has restored it in such an up-to-date way that it is\n    practically impregnable to anything under big guns or a siege-train.\n    He has gone so far as to have certain outworks and the keep covered\n    with armoured plating of what looks like harveyized steel.  You will\n    wonder when you see it.  But as yet I really know only a few rooms,\n    and am familiar with only one--my own room.  The drawing-room--not\n    the great hall, which is a vast place; the library--a magnificent\n    one, but in sad disorder--we must get a librarian some day to put it\n    in trim; and the drawing-room and boudoir and bedroom suite which I\n    have selected for you, are all fine.  But my own room is what suits\n    me best, though I do not think you would care for it for yourself.\n    If you do, you shall have it.  It was Uncle Roger's own room when he\n    stayed here; living in it for a few days served to give me more\n    insight to his character--or rather to his mind--than I could have\n    otherwise had.  It is just the kind of place I like myself; so,\n    naturally, I understand the other chap who liked it too.  It is a\n    fine big room, not quite within the Castle, but an outlying part of\n    it.  It is not detached, or anything of that sort, but is a sort of\n    garden-room built on to it.  There seems to have been always some\n    sort of place where it is, for the passages and openings inside seem\n    to accept or recognize it.  It can be shut off if necessary--it would\n    be in case of attack--by a great slab of steel, just like the door of\n    a safe, which slides from inside the wall, and can be operated from\n    either inside or outside--if you know how.  That is from my room or\n    from within the keep.  The mechanism is a secret, and no one but\n    Rooke and I know it.  The room opens out through a great French\n    window--the French window is modern, I take it, and was arranged by\n    or for Uncle Roger; I think there must have been always a large\n    opening there, for centuries at least--which opens on a wide terrace\n    or balcony of white marble, extending right and left.  From this a\n    white marble stair lies straight in front of the window, and leads\n    down to the garden.  The balcony and staircase are quite ancient--of\n    old Italian work, beautifully carved, and, of course, weather-worn\n    through centuries.  There is just that little tinging of green here\n    and there which makes all outdoor marble so charming.  It is hard to\n    believe at times that it is a part of a fortified castle, it is so\n    elegant and free and open.  The first glance of it would make a\n    burglar's heart glad.  He would say to himself: \"Here is the sort of\n    crib I like when I'm on the job.  You can just walk in and out as you\n    choose.\"  But, Aunt Janet, old Roger was cuter than any burglar.  He\n    had the place so guarded that the burglar would have been a baffled\n    burglar.  There are two steel shields which can slide out from the\n    wall and lock into the other side right across the whole big window.\n    One is a grille of steel bands that open out into diamond-shaped\n    lozenges.  Nothing bigger than a kitten could get through; and yet\n    you can see the garden and the mountains and the whole view--much the\n    same as you ladies can see through your veils.  The other is a great\n    sheet of steel, which slides out in a similar way in different\n    grooves.  It is not, of course, so heavy and strong as the safe-door\n    which covers the little opening in the main wall, but Rooke tells me\n    it is proof against the heaviest rifle-hall.\n\n    Having told you this, I must tell you, too, Aunt Janet, lest you\n    should be made anxious by the _arriere-pensee_ of all these warlike\n    measures of defence, that I always sleep at night with one of these\n    iron screens across the window.  Of course, when I am awake I leave\n    it open.  As yet I have tried only, but not used, the grille; and I\n    don't think I shall ever use anything else, for it is a perfect\n    guard.  If it should be tampered with from outside it would sound an\n    alarm at the head of the bed, and the pressing of a button would roll\n    out the solid steel screen in front of it.  As a matter of fact, I\n    have been so used to the open that I don't feel comfortable shut in.\n    I only close windows against cold or rain.  The weather here is\n    delightful--as yet, at all events--but they tell me that the rainy\n    season will be on us before very long.\n\n    I think you will like my den, aunty dear, though it will doubtless be\n    a worry to you to see it so untidy.  But that can't be helped.  I\n    must be untidy _somewhere_; and it is best in my own den!\n\n    Again I find my letter so long that I must cut it off now and go on\n    again to-night.  So this must go as it stands.  I shall not cause you\n    to wait to hear all I can tell you about our new home.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                       _January_ 29, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,\n\n    My den looks out, as I told you in my last letter, on the garden, or,\n    to speak more accurately, on _one_ of the gardens, for there are\n    acres of them.  This is the old one, which must be almost as old as\n    the Castle itself, for it was within the defences in the old days of\n    bows.  The wall that surrounds the inner portion of it has long ago\n    been levelled, but sufficient remains at either end where it joined\n    the outer defences to show the long casemates for the bowmen to shoot\n    through and the raised stone gallery where they stood.  It is just\n    the same kind of building as the stone-work of the sentry's walk on\n    the roof and of the great old guard-room under it.\n\n    But whatever the garden may have been, and no matter how it was\n    guarded, it is a most lovely place.  There are whole sections of\n    garden here of various styles--Greek, Italian, French, German, Dutch,\n    British, Spanish, African, Moorish--all the older nationalities.  I\n    am going to have a new one laid out for you--a Japanese garden.  I\n    have sent to the great gardener of Japan, Minaro, to make the plans\n    for it, and to come over with workmen to carry it out.  He is to\n    bring trees and shrubs and flowers and stone-work, and everything\n    that can be required; and you shall superintend the finishing, if not\n    the doing, of it yourself.  We have such a fine head of water here,\n    and the climate is, they tell me, usually so lovely that we can do\n    anything in the gardening way.  If it should ever turn out that the\n    climate does not suit, we shall put a great high glass roof over it,\n    and _make_ a suitable climate.\n\n    This garden in front of my room is the old Italian garden.  It must\n    have been done with extraordinary taste and care, for there is not a\n    bit of it which is not rarely beautiful.  Sir Thomas Browne himself,\n    for all his _Quincunx_, would have been delighted with it, and have\n    found material for another \"Garden of Cyrus.\"  It is so big that\n    there are endless \"episodes\" of garden beauty I think all Italy must\n    have been ransacked in old times for garden stone-work of exceptional\n    beauty; and these treasures have been put together by some\n    master-hand.  Even the formal borders of the walks are of old porous\n    stone, which takes the weather-staining so beautifully, and are\n    carved in endless variety.  Now that the gardens have been so long\n    neglected or left in abeyance, the green staining has become perfect.\n    Though the stone-work is itself intact, it has all the picturesque\n    effect of the wear and ruin wrought by many centuries.  I am having\n    it kept for you just as it is, except that I have had the weeds and\n    undergrowth cleared away so that its beauties might be visible.\n\n    But it is not merely the architect work of the garden that is so\n    beautiful, nor is the assembling there of the manifold wealth of\n    floral beauty--there is the beauty that Nature creates by the hand of\n    her servant, Time.  You see, Aunt Janet, how the beautiful garden\n    inspires a danger-hardened old tramp like me to high-grade sentiments\n    of poetic fancy!  Not only have limestone and sandstone, and even\n    marble, grown green in time, but even the shrubs planted and then\n    neglected have developed new kinds of beauty of their own.  In some\n    far-distant time some master-gardener of the Vissarions has tried to\n    realize an idea--that of tiny plants that would grow just a little\n    higher than the flowers, so that the effect of an uneven floral\n    surface would be achieved without any hiding of anything in the\n    garden seen from anywhere.  This is only my reading of what has been\n    from the effect of what is!  In the long period of neglect the shrubs\n    have outlived the flowers.  Nature has been doing her own work all\n    the time in enforcing the survival of the fittest.  The shrubs have\n    grown and grown, and have overtopped flower and weed, according to\n    their inherent varieties of stature; to the effect that now you see\n    irregularly scattered through the garden quite a number--for it is a\n    big place--of vegetable products which from a landscape standpoint\n    have something of the general effect of statues without the cramping\n    feeling of detail.  Whoever it was that laid out that part of the\n    garden or made the choice of items, must have taken pains to get\n    strange specimens, for all those taller shrubs are in special\n    colours, mostly yellow or white--white cypress, white holly, yellow\n    yew, grey-golden box, silver juniper, variegated maple, spiraea, and\n    numbers of dwarf shrubs whose names I don't know.  I only know that\n    when the moon shines--and this, my dear Aunt Janet, is the very land\n    of moonlight itself!--they all look ghastly pale.  The effect is\n    weird to the last degree, and I am sure that you will enjoy it.  For\n    myself, as you know, uncanny things hold no fear.  I suppose it is\n    that I have been up against so many different kinds of fears, or,\n    rather, of things which for most people have terrors of their own,\n    that I have come to have a contempt--not an active contempt, you\n    know, but a tolerative contempt--for the whole family of them.  And\n    you, too, will enjoy yourself here famously, I know.  You'll have to\n    collect all the stories of such matters in our new world and make a\n    new book of facts for the Psychical Research Society.  It will be\n    nice to see your own name on a title-page, won't it, Aunt Janet?\n\n_From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                       _January_ 30, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,\n\n    I stopped writing last night--do you know why?  Because I wanted to\n    write more!  This sounds a paradox, but it is true.  The fact is\n    that, as I go on telling you of this delightful place, I keep finding\n    out new beauties myself.  Broadly speaking, it _is all_ beautiful.\n    In the long view or the little view--as the telescope or the\n    microscope directs--it is all the same.  Your eye can turn on nothing\n    that does not entrance you.  I was yesterday roaming about the upper\n    part of time Castle, and came across some delightful nooks, which at\n    once I became fond of, and already like them as if I had known them\n    all my life.  I felt at first a sense of greediness when I had\n    appropriated to myself several rooms in different places--I who have\n    never in my life had more than one room which I could call my\n    own--and that only for a time!  But when I slept on it the feeling\n    changed, and its aspect is now not half bad.  It is now under another\n    classification--under a much more important label--_proprietorship_.\n    If I were writing philosophy, I should here put in a cynical remark:\n\n    \"Selfishness is an appanage of poverty.  It might appear in the\n    stud-book as by 'Morals' out of 'Wants.'\"\n\n    I have now three bedrooms arranged as my own particular dens.  One of\n    the other two was also a choice of Uncle Roger's.  It is at the top\n    of one of the towers to the extreme east, and from it I can catch the\n    first ray of light over the mountains.  I slept in it last night, and\n    when I woke, as in my travelling I was accustomed to do, at dawn, I\n    saw from my bed through an open window--a small window, for it is in\n    a fortress tower--the whole great expanse to the east.  Not far off,\n    and springing from the summit of a great ruin, where long ago a seed\n    had fallen, rose a great silver-birch, and the half-transparent,\n    drooping branches and hanging clusters of leaf broke the outline of\n    the grey hills beyond, for the hills were, for a wonder, grey instead\n    of blue.  There was a mackerel sky, with the clouds dropping on the\n    mountain-tops till you could hardly say which was which.  It was a\n    mackerel sky of a very bold and extraordinary kind--not a dish of\n    mackerel, but a world of mackerel!  The mountains are certainly most\n    lovely.  In this clear air they usually seem close at hand.  It was\n    only this morning, with the faint glimpse of the dawn whilst the\n    night clouds were still unpierced by the sunlight, that I seemed to\n    realize their greatness.  I have seen the same enlightening effect of\n    aerial perspective a few times before--in Colorado, in Upper India,\n    in Thibet, and in the uplands amongst the Andes.\n\n    There is certainly something in looking at things from above which\n    tends to raise one's own self-esteem.  From the height, inequalities\n    simply disappear.  This I have often felt on a big scale when\n    ballooning, or, better still, from an aeroplane.  Even here from the\n    tower the outlook is somehow quite different from below.  One\n    realizes the place and all around it, not in detail, but as a whole.\n    I shall certainly sleep up here occasionally, when you have come and\n    we have settled down to our life as it is to be.  I shall live in my\n    own room downstairs, where I can have the intimacy of the garden.\n    But I shall appreciate it all the more from now and again losing the\n    sense of intimacy for a while, and surveying it without the sense of\n    one's own self-importance.\n\n    I hope you have started on that matter of the servants.  For myself,\n    I don't care a button whether or not there are any servants at all;\n    but I know well that you won't come till you have made your\n    arrangements regarding them!  Another thing, Aunt Janet.  You must\n    not be killed with work here, and it is all so vast . . . Why can't\n    you get some sort of secretary who will write your letters and do all\n    that sort of thing for you?  I know you won't have a man secretary;\n    but there are lots of women now who can write shorthand and\n    typewrite.  You could doubtless get one in the clan--someone with a\n    desire to better herself.  I know you would make her happy here.  If\n    she is not too young, all the better; she will have learned to hold\n    her tongue and mind her own business, and not be too inquisitive.\n    That would be a nuisance when we are finding our way about in a new\n    country and trying to reconcile all sorts of opposites in a whole new\n    country with new people, whom at first we shan't understand, and who\n    certainly won't understand us; where every man carries a gun with as\n    little thought of it as he has of buttons!  Good-bye for a while.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                       _February_ 3, 1907.\n\n    I am back in my own room again.  Already it seems to me that to get\n    here again is like coming home.  I have been going about for the last\n    few days amongst the mountaineers and trying to make their\n    acquaintance.  It is a tough job; and I can see that there will be\n    nothing but to stick to it.  They are in reality the most primitive\n    people I ever met--the most fixed to their own ideas, which belong to\n    centuries back.  I can understand now what people were like in\n    England--not in Queen Elizabeth's time, for that was civilized time,\n    but in the time of Coeur-de-Lion, or even earlier--and all the time\n    with the most absolute mastery of weapons of precision.  Every man\n    carries a rifle--and knows how to use it, too.  I do believe they\n    would rather go without their clothes than their guns if they had to\n    choose between them.  They also carry a handjar, which used to be\n    their national weapon.  It is a sort of heavy, straight cutlass, and\n    they are so expert with it as well as so strong that it is as facile\n    in the hands of a Blue Mountaineer as is a foil in the hands of a\n    Persian _maitre d'armes_.  They are so proud and reserved that they\n    make one feel quite small, and an \"outsider\" as well.  I can see\n    quite well that they rather resent my being here at all.  It is not\n    personal, for when alone with me they are genial, almost brotherly;\n    but the moment a few of them get together they are like a sort of\n    jury, with me as the criminal before them.  It is an odd situation,\n    and quite new to me.  I am pretty well accustomed to all sorts of\n    people, from cannibals to Mahatmas, but I'm blessed if I ever struck\n    such a type as this--so proud, so haughty, so reserved, so distant,\n    so absolutely fearless, so honourable, so hospitable.  Uncle Roger's\n    head was level when he chose them out as a people to live amongst.\n    Do you know, Aunt Janet, I can't help feeling that they are very much\n    like your own Highlanders--only more so.  I'm sure of one thing: that\n    in the end we shall get on capitally together.  But it will be a slow\n    job, and will need a lot of patience.  I have a feeling in my bones\n    that when they know me better they will be very loyal and very true;\n    and I am not a hair's-breadth afraid of them or anything they shall\n    or might do.  That is, of course, if I live long enough for them to\n    have time to know me.  Anything may happen with such an indomitable,\n    proud people to whom pride is more than victuals.  After all, it only\n    needs one man out of a crowd to have a wrong idea or to make a\n    mistake as to one's motive--and there you are.  But it will be all\n    right that way, I am sure.  I am come here to stay, as Uncle Roger\n    wished.  And stay I shall even if it has to be in a little bed of my\n    own beyond the garden--seven feet odd long, and not too narrow--or\n    else a stone-box of equal proportions in the vaults of St. Sava's\n    Church across the Creek--the old burial-place of the Vissarions and\n    other noble people for a good many centuries back . . .\n\n    I have been reading over this letter, dear Aunt Janet, and I am\n    afraid the record is rather an alarming one.  But don't you go\n    building up superstitious horrors or fears on it.  Honestly, I am\n    only joking about death--a thing to which I have been rather prone\n    for a good many years back.  Not in very good taste, I suppose, but\n    certainly very useful when the old man with the black wings goes\n    flying about you day and night in strange places, sometimes visible\n    and at others invisible.  But you can always hear wings, especially\n    in the dark, when you cannot see them.  _You_ know that, Aunt Janet,\n    who come of a race of warriors, and who have special sight behind or\n    through the black curtain.\n\n    Honestly, I am in no whit afraid of the Blue Mountaineers, nor have I\n    a doubt of them.  I love them already for their splendid qualities,\n    and I am prepared to love them for themselves.  I feel, too, that\n    they will love me (and incidentally they are sure to love you).  I\n    have a sort of undercurrent of thought that there is something in\n    their minds concerning me--something not painful, but disturbing;\n    something that has a base in the past; something that has hope in it\n    and possible pride, and not a little respect.  As yet they can have\n    had no opportunity of forming such impression from seeing me or from\n    any thing I have done.  Of course, it may be that, although they are\n    fine, tall, stalwart men, I am still a head and shoulders over the\n    tallest of them that I have yet seen.  I catch their eyes looking up\n    at me as though they were measuring me, even when they are keeping\n    away from me, or, rather, keeping me from them at arm's length.  I\n    suppose I shall understand what it all means some day.  In the\n    meantime there is nothing to do but to go on my own way--which is\n    Uncle Roger's--and wait and be patient and just.  I have learned the\n    value of that, any way, in my life amongst strange peoples.\n    Good-night.\n\n                                                               Your loving\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.\n\n                                                      _February_ 24, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,\n\n    I am more than rejoiced to hear that you are coming here so soon.\n    This isolation is, I think, getting on my nerves.  I thought for a\n    while last night that I was getting on, but the reaction came all too\n    soon.  I was in my room in the east turret, the room on the\n    _corbeille_, and saw here and there men passing silently and swiftly\n    between the trees as though in secret.  By-and-by I located their\n    meeting-place, which was in a hollow in the midst of the wood just\n    outside the \"natural\" garden, as the map or plan of the castle calls\n    it.  I stalked that place for all I was worth, and suddenly walked\n    straight into the midst of them.  There were perhaps two or three\n    hundred gathered, about the very finest lot of men I ever saw in my\n    life.  It was in its way quite an experience, and one not likely to\n    be repeated, for, as I told you, in this country every man carries a\n    rifle, and knows how to use it.  I do not think I have seen a single\n    man (or married man either) without his rifle since I came here.  I\n    wonder if they take them with them to bed!  Well, the instant after I\n    stood amongst them every rifle in the place was aimed straight at me.\n    Don't be alarmed, Aunt Janet; they did not fire at me.  If they had I\n    should not be writing to you now.  I should be in that little bit of\n    real estate or the stone box, and about as full of lead as I could\n    hold.  Ordinarily, I take it, they would have fired on the instant;\n    that is the etiquette here.  But this time they--all separately but\n    all together--made a new rule.  No one said a word or, so far as I\n    could see, made a movement.  Here came in my own experience.  I had\n    been more than once in a tight place of something of the same kind,\n    so I simply behaved in the most natural way I could.  I felt\n    conscious--it was all in a flash, remember--that if I showed fear or\n    cause for fear, or even acknowledged danger by so much as even\n    holding up my hands, I should have drawn all the fire.  They all\n    remained stock-still, as though they had been turned into stone, for\n    several seconds.  Then a queer kind of look flashed round them like\n    wind over corn--something like the surprise one shows unconsciously\n    on waking in a strange place.  A second after they each dropped the\n    rifle to the hollow of his arm and stood ready for anything.  It was\n    all as regular and quick and simultaneous as a salute at St. James's\n    Palace.\n\n    Happily I had no arms of any kind with me, so that there could be no\n    complication.  I am rather a quick hand myself when there is any\n    shooting to be done.  However, there was no trouble here, but the\n    contrary; the Blue Mountaineers--it sounds like a new sort of Bond\n    Street band, doesn't it?--treated me in quite a different way than\n    they did when I first met them.  They were amazingly civil, almost\n    deferential.  But, all time same, they were more distant than ever,\n    and all the time I was there I could get not a whit closer to them.\n    They seemed in a sort of way to be afraid or in awe of me.  No doubt\n    that will soon pass away, and when we know one another better we\n    shall become close friends.  They are too fine fellows not to be\n    worth a little waiting for.  (That sentence, by the way, is a pretty\n    bad sentence!  In old days you would have slippered me for it!)  Your\n    journey is all arranged, and I hope you will be comfortable.  Rooke\n    will meet you at Liverpool Street and look after everything.\n\n    I shan't write again, but when we meet at Fiume I shall begin to tell\n    you all the rest.  Till then, good-bye.  A good journey to you, and a\n    happy meeting to us both.\n\n                                                                   RUPERT.\n\n_Letter from Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_, _to Sir Colin MacKelpie_,\n_United Service Club_, _London_.\n\n                                                      _February_ 28, 1907.\n\n    DEAREST UNCLE,\n\n    I had a very comfortable journey all across Europe.  Rupert wrote to\n    me some time ago to say that when I got to Vissarion I should be an\n    Empress, and he certainly took care that on the way here I should be\n    treated like one.  Rooke, who seems a wonderful old man, was in the\n    next compartment to that reserved for me.  At Harwich he had\n    everything arranged perfectly, and so right on to Fiume.  Everywhere\n    there were attentive officials waiting.  I had a carriage all to\n    myself, which I joined at Antwerp--a whole carriage with a suite of\n    rooms, dining-room, drawing-room, bedroom, even bath-room.  There was\n    a cook with a kitchen of his own on board, a real chef like a French\n    nobleman in disguise.  There were also a waiter and a servant-maid.\n    My own maid Maggie was quite awed at first.  We were as far as\n    Cologne before she summoned up courage to order them about.  Whenever\n    we stopped Rooke was on the platform with local officials, and kept\n    the door of my carriage like a sentry on duty.\n\n    At Fiume, when the train slowed down, I saw Rupert waiting on the\n    platform.  He looked magnificent, towering over everybody there like\n    a giant.  He is in perfect health, and seemed glad to see me.  He\n    took me off at once on an automobile to a quay where an electric\n    launch was waiting.  This took us on board a beautiful big\n    steam-yacht, which was waiting with full steam up and--how he got\n    there I don't know--Rooke waiting at the gangway.\n\n    I had another suite all to myself.  Rupert and I had dinner\n    together--I think the finest dinner I ever sat down to.  This was\n    very nice of Rupert, for it was all for me.  He himself only ate a\n    piece of steak and drank a glass of water.  I went to bed early, for,\n    despite the luxury of the journey, I was very tired.\n\n    I awoke in the grey of the morning, and came on deck.  We were close\n    to the coast.  Rupert was on the bridge with the Captain, and Rooke\n    was acting as pilot.  When Rupert saw me, he ran down the ladder and\n    took me up on the bridge.  He left me there while he ran down again\n    and brought me up a lovely fur cloak which I had never seen.  He put\n    it on me and kissed me.  He is the tenderest-hearted boy in the\n    world, as well as the best and bravest!  He made me take his arm\n    whilst he pointed out Vissarion, towards which we were steering.  It\n    is the most lovely place I ever saw.  I won't stop to describe it\n    now, for it will be better that you see it for yourself and enjoy it\n    all fresh as I did.\n\n    The Castle is an immense place.  You had better ship off, as soon as\n    all is ready here and you can arrange it, the servants whom I\n    engaged; and I am not sure that we shall not want as many more.\n    There has hardly been a mop or broom on the place for centuries, and\n    I doubt if it ever had a thorough good cleaning all over since it was\n    built.  And, do you know, Uncle, that it might be well to double that\n    little army of yours that you are arranging for Rupert?  Indeed, the\n    boy told me himself that he was going to write to you about it.  I\n    think old Lachlan and his wife, Sandy's Mary, had better be in charge\n    of the maids when they come over.  A lot of lassies like yon will be\n    iller to keep together than a flock of sheep.  So it will be wise to\n    have authority over them, especially as none of them speaks a word of\n    foreign tongues.  Rooke--you saw him at the station at Liverpool\n    Street--will, if he be available, go over to bring the whole body\n    here.  He has offered to do it if I should wish.  And, by the way, I\n    think it will be well, when the time comes for their departure, if\n    not only the lassies, but Lachlan and Sandy's Mary, too, will call\n    him _Mister_ Rooke.  He is a very important person indeed here.  He\n    is, in fact, a sort of Master of the Castle, and though he is very\n    self-suppressing, is a man of rarely fine qualities.  Also it will be\n    well to keep authority.  When your clansmen come over, he will have\n    charge of them, too.  Dear me!  I find I have written such a long\n    letter, I must stop and get to work.  I shall write again.\n\n                                                    Your very affectionate\n                                                                    JANET.\n\n_From the Same to the Same_.\n\n                                                          _March_ 3, 1907.\n\n    DEAREST UNCLE,\n\n    All goes well here, and as there is no news, I only write because you\n    are a dear, and I want to thank you for all the trouble you have\n    taken for me--and for Rupert.  I think we had better wait awhile\n    before bringing out the servants.  Rooke is away on some business for\n    Rupert, and will not be back for some time; Rupert thinks it may be a\n    couple of months.  There is no one else that he could send to take\n    charge of the party from home, and I don't like the idea of all those\n    lassies coming out without an escort.  Even Lachlan and Sandy's Mary\n    are ignorant of foreign languages and foreign ways.  But as soon as\n    Rooke returns we can have them all out.  I dare say you will have\n    some of your clansmen ready by then, and I think the poor girls, who\n    may feel a bit strange in a new country like this, where the ways are\n    so different from ours, will feel easier when they know that there\n    are some of their own mankind near them.  Perhaps it might be well\n    that those of them who are engaged to each other--I know there are\n    some--should marry before they come out here.  It will be more\n    convenient in many ways, and will save lodgment, and, besides, these\n    Blue Mountaineers are very handsome men.  Good-night.\n\n                                                                    JANET.\n\n_Sir Colin MacKelpie_, _Croom_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_.\n\n                                                          _March_ 9, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAR JANET,\n\n    I have duly received both your letters, and am delighted to find you\n    are so well pleased with your new home.  It must certainly be a very\n    lovely and unique place, and I am myself longing to see it.  I came\n    up here three days ago, and am, as usual, feeling all the better for\n    a breath of my native air.  Time goes on, my dear, and I am beginning\n    to feel not so young as I was.  Tell Rupert that the men are all fit,\n    and longing to get out to him.  They are certainly a fine lot of men.\n    I don't think I ever saw a finer.  I have had them drilled and\n    trained as soldiers, and, in addition, have had them taught a lot of\n    trades just as they selected themselves.  So he shall have nigh him\n    men who can turn their hands to anything--not, of course, that they\n    all know every trade, but amongst them there is someone who can do\n    whatever may be required.  There are blacksmiths, carpenters,\n    farriers, saddle-makers, gardeners, plumbers, cutlers, gunsmiths, so,\n    as they all are farmers by origin and sportsmen by practice, they\n    will make a rare household body of men.  They are nearly all\n    first-class shots, and I am having them practise with revolvers.\n    They are being taught fencing and broadsword and ju-jitsu; I have\n    organized them in military form, with their own sergeants and\n    corporals.  This morning I had an inspection, and I assure you, my\n    dear, they could give points to the Household troop in matters of\n    drill.  I tell you I am proud of my clansmen!\n\n    I think you are quite wise about waiting to bring out the lassies,\n    and wiser still about the marrying.  I dare say there will be more\n    marrying when they all get settled in a foreign country.  I shall be\n    glad of it, for as Rupert is going to settle there, it will be good\n    for him to have round him a little colony of his own people.  And it\n    will be good for them, too, for I know he will be good to them--as\n    you will, my dear.  The hills are barren here, and life is hard, and\n    each year there is more and more demand for crofts, and sooner or\n    later our people must thin out.  And mayhap our little settlement of\n    MacKelpie clan away beyond the frontiers of the Empire may be some\n    service to the nation and the King.  But this is a dream!  I see that\n    here I am beginning to realise in myself one part of Isaiah's\n    prophecy:\n\n    \"Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream\n    dreams.\"\n\n    By the way, my dear, talking about dreams, I am sending you out some\n    boxes of books which were in your rooms.  They are nearly all on odd\n    subjects that _we_ understand--Second Sight, Ghosts, Dreams (that was\n    what brought the matter to my mind just now), superstitions,\n    Vampires, Wehr-Wolves, and all such uncanny folk and things.  I\n    looked over some of these books, and found your marks and underlining\n    and comments, so I fancy you will miss them in your new home.  You\n    will, I am sure, feel more at ease with such old friends close to\n    you.  I have taken the names and sent the list to London, so that\n    when you pay me a visit again you will be at home in all ways.  If\n    you come to me altogether, you will be more welcome still--if\n    possible.  But I am sure that Rupert, who I know loves you very much,\n    will try to make you so happy that you will not want to leave him.\n    So I will have to come out often to see you both, even at the cost of\n    leaving Croom for so long.  Strange, is it not? that now, when,\n    through Roger Melton's more than kind remembrance of me, I am able to\n    go where I will and do what I will, I want more and more to remain at\n    home by my own ingle.  I don't think that anyone but you or Rupert\n    could get me away from it.  I am working very hard at my little\n    regiment, as I call it.  They are simply fine, and will, I am sure,\n    do us credit.  The uniforms are all made, and well made, too.  There\n    is not a man of them that does not look like an officer.  I tell you,\n    Janet, that when we turn out the Vissarion Guard we shall feel proud\n    of them.  I dare say that a couple of months will do all that can be\n    done here.  I shall come out with them myself.  Rupert writes me that\n    he thinks it will be more comfortable to come out direct in a ship of\n    our own.  So when I go up to London in a few weeks' time I shall see\n    about chartering a suitable vessel.  It will certainly save a lot of\n    trouble to us and anxiety to our people.  Would it not be well when I\n    am getting the ship, if I charter one big enough to take out all your\n    lassies, too?  It is not as if they were strangers.  After all, my\n    dear, soldiers are soldiers and lassies are lassies.  But these are\n    all kinsfolk, as well as clansmen and clanswomen, and I, their Chief,\n    shall be there.  Let me know your views and wishes in this respect.\n    Mr. Trent, whom I saw before leaving London, asked me to \"convey to\n    you his most respectful remembrances\"--these were his very words, and\n    here they are.  Trent is a nice fellow, and I like him.  He has\n    promised to pay me a visit here before the month is up, and I look\n    forward to our both enjoying ourselves.\n\n    Good-bye, my dear, and the Lord watch over you and our dear boy.\n\n                                                  Your affectionate Uncle,\n                                                COLIN ALEXANDER MACKELPIE.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III: THE COMING OF THE LADY\n\n\nRupert Sent Leger's Journal.\n\n\n                                                          _April_ 3, 1907.\n\nI have waited till now--well into midday--before beginning to set down\nthe details of the strange episode of last night.  I have spoken with\npersons whom I know to be of normal type.  I have breakfasted, as usual\nheartily, and have every reason to consider myself in perfect health and\nsanity.  So that the record following may be regarded as not only true in\nsubstance, but exact as to details.  I have investigated and reported on\ntoo many cases for the Psychical Research Society to be ignorant of the\nnecessity for absolute accuracy in such matters of even the minutest\ndetail.\n\nYesterday was Tuesday, the second day of April, 1907.  I passed a day of\ninterest, with its fair amount of work of varying kinds.  Aunt Janet and\nI lunched together, had a stroll round the gardens after tea--especially\nexamining the site for the new Japanese garden, which we shall call\n\"Janet's Garden.\"  We went in mackintoshes, for the rainy season is in\nits full, the only sign of its not being a repetition of the Deluge being\nthat breaks in the continuance are beginning.  They are short at present\nbut will doubtless enlarge themselves as the season comes towards an end.\nWe dined together at seven.  After dinner I had a cigar, and then joined\nAunt Janet for an hour in her drawing-room.  I left her at half-past ten,\nwhen I went to my own room and wrote some letters.  At ten minutes past\neleven I wound my watch, so I know the time accurately.  Having prepared\nfor bed, I drew back the heavy curtain in front of my window, which opens\non the marble steps into the Italian garden.  I had put out my light\nbefore drawing back the curtain, for I wanted to have a look at the scene\nbefore turning in.  Aunt Janet has always had an old-fashioned idea of\nthe need (or propriety, I hardly know which) of keeping windows closed\nand curtains drawn.  I am gradually getting her to leave my room alone in\nthis respect, but at present the change is in its fitful stage, and of\ncourse I must not hurry matters or be too persistent, as it would hurt\nher feelings.  This night was one of those under the old regime.  It was\na delight to look out, for the scene was perfect of its own kind.  The\nlong spell of rain--the ceaseless downpour which had for the time flooded\neverywhere--had passed, and water in abnormal places rather trickled than\nran.  We were now beginning to be in the sloppy rather than the deluged\nstage.  There was plenty of light to see by, for the moon had begun to\nshow out fitfully through the masses of flying clouds.  The uncertain\nlight made weird shadows with the shrubs and statues in the garden.  The\nlong straight walk which leads from the marble steps is strewn with fine\nsand white from the quartz strand in the nook to the south of the Castle.\nTall shrubs of white holly, yew, juniper, cypress, and variegated maple\nand spiraea, which stood at intervals along the walk and its branches,\nappeared ghost-like in the fitful moonlight.  The many vases and statues\nand urns, always like phantoms in a half-light, were more than ever\nweird.  Last night the moonlight was unusually effective, and showed not\nonly the gardens down to the defending wall, but the deep gloom of the\ngreat forest-trees beyond; and beyond that, again, to where the mountain\nchain began, the forest running up their silvered slopes flamelike in\nform, deviated here and there by great crags and the outcropping rocky\nsinews of the vast mountains.\n\nWhilst I was looking at this lovely prospect, I thought I saw something\nwhite flit, like a modified white flash, at odd moments from one to\nanother of the shrubs or statues--anything which would afford cover from\nobservation.  At first I was not sure whether I really saw anything or\ndid not.  This was in itself a little disturbing to me, for I have been\nso long trained to minute observation of facts surrounding me, on which\noften depend not only my own life, but the lives of others, that I have\nbecome accustomed to trust my eyes; and anything creating the faintest\ndoubt in this respect is a cause of more or less anxiety to me.  Now,\nhowever, that my attention was called to myself, I looked more keenly,\nand in a very short time was satisfied that something was\nmoving--something clad in white.  It was natural enough that my thoughts\nshould tend towards something uncanny--the belief that this place is\nhaunted, conveyed in a thousand ways of speech and inference.  Aunt\nJanet's eerie beliefs, fortified by her books on occult subjects--and of\nlate, in our isolation from the rest of the world, the subject of daily\nconversations--helped to this end.  No wonder, then, that, fully awake\nand with senses all on edge, I waited for some further manifestation from\nthis ghostly visitor--as in my mind I took it to be.  It must surely be a\nghost or spiritual manifestation of some kind which moved in this silent\nway.  In order to see and hear better, I softly moved back the folding\ngrille, opened the French window, and stepped out, bare-footed and\npyjama-clad as I was, on the marble terrace.  How cold the wet marble\nwas!  How heavy smelled the rain-laden garden!  It was as though the\nnight and the damp, and even the moonlight, were drawing the aroma from\nall the flowers that blossomed.  The whole night seemed to exhale heavy,\nhalf-intoxicating odours!  I stood at the head of the marble steps, and\nall immediately before me was ghostly in the extreme--the white marble\nterrace and steps, the white walks of quartz-sand glistening under the\nfitful moonlight; the shrubs of white or pale green or yellow,--all\nlooking dim and ghostly in the glamorous light; the white statues and\nvases.  And amongst them, still flitting noiselessly, that mysterious\nelusive figure which I could not say was based on fact or imagination.  I\nheld my breath, listening intently for every sound; but sound there was\nnone, save those of the night and its denizens.  Owls hooted in the\nforest; bats, taking advantage of the cessation of the rain, flitted\nabout silently, like shadows in the air.  But there was no more sign of\nmoving ghost or phantom, or whatever I had seen might have been--if,\nindeed, there had been anything except imagination.\n\nSo, after waiting awhile, I returned to my room, closed the window, drew\nthe grille across again, and dragged the heavy curtain before the\nopening; then, having extinguished my candles, went to bed in the dark.\nIn a few minutes I must have been asleep.\n\n\"What was that?\"  I almost heard the words of my own thought as I sat up\nin bed wide awake.  To memory rather than present hearing the disturbing\nsound had seemed like the faint tapping at the window.  For some seconds\nI listened, mechanically but intently, with bated breath and that quick\nbeating of the heart which in a timorous person speaks for fear, and for\nexpectation in another.  In the stillness the sound came again--this time\na very, very faint but unmistakable tapping at the glass door.\n\nI jumped up, drew back the curtain, and for a moment stood appalled.\n\nThere, outside on the balcony, in the now brilliant moonlight, stood a\nwoman, wrapped in white grave-clothes saturated with water, which dripped\non the marble floor, making a pool which trickled slowly down the wet\nsteps.  Attitude and dress and circumstance all conveyed the idea that,\nthough she moved and spoke, she was not quick, but dead.  She was young\nand very beautiful, but pale, like the grey pallor of death.  Through the\nstill white of her face, which made her look as cold as the wet marble\nshe stood on, her dark eyes seemed to gleam with a strange but enticing\nlustre.  Even in the unsearching moonlight, which is after all rather\ndeceptive than illuminative, I could not but notice one rare quality of\nher eyes.  Each had some quality of refraction which made it look as\nthough it contained a star.  At every movement she made, the stars\nexhibited new beauties, of more rare and radiant force.  She looked at me\nimploringly as the heavy curtain rolled back, and in eloquent gestures\nimplored me to admit her.  Instinctively I obeyed; I rolled back the\nsteel grille, and threw open the French window.  I noticed that she\nshivered and trembled as the glass door fell open.  Indeed, she seemed so\novercome with cold as to seem almost unable to move.  In the sense of her\nhelplessness all idea of the strangeness of the situation entirely\ndisappeared.  It was not as if my first idea of death taken from her\ncerements was negatived.  It was simply that I did not think of it at\nall; I was content to accept things as they were--she was a woman, and in\nsome dreadful trouble; that was enough.\n\nI am thus particular about my own emotions, as I may have to refer to\nthem again in matters of comprehension or comparison.  The whole thing is\nso vastly strange and abnormal that the least thing may afterwards give\nsome guiding light or clue to something otherwise not understandable.  I\nhave always found that in recondite matters first impressions are of more\nreal value than later conclusions.  We humans place far too little\nreliance on instinct as against reason; and yet instinct is the great\ngift of Nature to all animals for their protection and the fulfilment of\ntheir functions generally.\n\nWhen I stepped out on the balcony, not thinking of my costume, I found\nthat the woman was benumbed and hardly able to move.  Even when I asked\nher to enter, and supplemented my words with gestures in case she should\nnot understand my language, she stood stock-still, only rocking slightly\nto and fro as though she had just strength enough left to balance herself\non her feet.  I was afraid, from the condition in which she was, that she\nmight drop down dead at any moment.  So I took her by the hand to lead\nher in.  But she seemed too weak to even make the attempt.  When I pulled\nher slightly forward, thinking to help her, she tottered, and would have\nfallen had I not caught her in my arms.  Then, half lifting her, I moved\nher forwards.  Her feet, relieved of her weight, now seemed able to make\nthe necessary effort; and so, I almost carrying her, we moved into the\nroom.  She was at the very end of her strength; I had to lift her over\nthe sill.  In obedience to her motion, I closed the French window and\nbolted it.  I supposed the warmth of the room--though cool, it was warmer\nthan the damp air without--affected her quickly, for on the instant she\nseemed to begin to recover herself.  In a few seconds, as though she had\nreacquired her strength, she herself pulled the heavy curtain across the\nwindow.  This left us in darkness, through which I heard her say in\nEnglish:\n\n\"Light.  Get a light!\"\n\nI found matches, and at once lit a candle.  As the wick flared, she moved\nover to the door of the room, and tried if the lock and bolt were\nfastened.  Satisfied as to this, she moved towards me, her wet shroud\nleaving a trail of moisture on the green carpet.  By this time the wax of\nthe candle had melted sufficiently to let me see her clearly.  She was\nshaking and quivering as though in an ague; she drew the wet shroud\naround her piteously.  Instinctively I spoke:\n\n\"Can I do anything for you?\"\n\nShe answered, still in English, and in a voice of thrilling, almost\npiercing sweetness, which seemed somehow to go straight to my heart, and\naffected me strangely: \"Give me warmth.\"\n\nI hurried to the fireplace.  It was empty; there was no fire laid.  I\nturned to her, and said:\n\n\"Wait just a few minutes here.  I shall call someone, and get help--and\nfire.\"\n\nHer voice seemed to ring with intensity as she answered without a pause:\n\n\"No, no!  Rather would I be\"--here she hesitated for an instant, but as\nshe caught sight of her cerements went on hurriedly--\"as I am.  I trust\nyou--not others; and you must not betray my trust.\"  Almost instantly she\nfell into a frightful fit of shivering, drawing again her death-clothes\nclose to her, so piteously that it wrung my heart.  I suppose I am a\npractical man.  At any rate, I am accustomed to action.  I took from its\nplace beside my bed a thick Jaeger dressing-gown of dark brown--it was,\nof course, of extra length--and held it out to her as I said:\n\n\"Put that on.  It is the only warm thing here which would be suitable.\nStay; you must remove that wet--wet\"--I stumbled about for a word that\nwould not be offensive--\"that frock--dress--costume--whatever it is.\"  I\npointed to where, in the corner of the room, stood a chintz-covered\nfolding-screen which fences in my cold sponge bath, which is laid ready\nfor me overnight, as I am an early riser.\n\nShe bowed gravely, and taking the dressing-gown in a long, white,\nfinely-shaped hand, bore it behind the screen.  There was a slight\nrustle, and then a hollow \"flop\" as the wet garment fell on the floor;\nmore rustling and rubbing, and a minute later she emerged wrapped from\nhead to foot in the long Jaeger garment, which trailed on the floor\nbehind her, though she was a tall woman.  She was still shivering\npainfully, however.  I took a flask of brandy and a glass from a\ncupboard, and offered her some; but with a motion of her hand she refused\nit, though she moaned grievously.\n\n\"Oh, I am so cold--so cold!\"  Her teeth were chattering.  I was pained at\nher sad condition, and said despairingly, for I was at my wits' end to\nknow what to do:\n\n\"Tell me anything that I can do to help you, and I will do it.  I may not\ncall help; there is no fire--nothing to make it with; you will not take\nsome brandy.  What on earth can I do to give you warmth?\"\n\nHer answer certainly surprised me when it came, though it was practical\nenough--so practical that I should not have dared to say it.  She looked\nme straight in the face for a few seconds before speaking.  Then, with an\nair of girlish innocence which disarmed suspicion and convinced me at\nonce of her simple faith, she said in a voice that at once thrilled me\nand evoked all my pity:\n\n\"Let me rest for a while, and cover me up with rugs.  That may give me\nwarmth.  I am dying of cold.  And I have a deadly fear upon me--a deadly\nfear.  Sit by me, and let me hold your hand.  You are big and strong, and\nyou look brave.  It will reassure me.  I am not myself a coward, but\nto-night fear has got me by the throat.  I can hardly breathe.  Do let me\nstay till I am warm.  If you only knew what I have gone through, and have\nto go through still, I am sure you would pity me and help me.\"\n\nTo say that I was astonished would be a mild description of my feelings.\nI was not shocked.  The life which I have led was not one which makes for\nprudery.  To travel in strange places amongst strange peoples with\nstrange views of their own is to have odd experiences and peculiar\nadventures now and again; a man without human passions is not the type\nnecessary for an adventurous life, such as I myself have had.  But even a\nman of passions and experiences can, when he respects a woman, be\nshocked--even prudish--where his own opinion of her is concerned.  Such\nmust bring to her guarding any generosity which he has, and any\nself-restraint also.  Even should she place herself in a doubtful\nposition, her honour calls to his honour.  This is a call which may not\nbe--_must_ not be--unanswered.  Even passion must pause for at least a\nwhile at sound of such a trumpet-call.\n\nThis woman I did respect--much respect.  Her youth and beauty; her\nmanifest ignorance of evil; her superb disdain of convention, which could\nonly come through hereditary dignity; her terrible fear and\nsuffering--for there must be more in her unhappy condition than meets the\neye--would all demand respect, even if one did not hasten to yield it.\nNevertheless, I thought it necessary to enter a protest against her\nembarrassing suggestion.  I certainly did feel a fool when making it,\nalso a cad.  I can truly say it was made only for her good, and out of\nthe best of me, such as I am.  I felt impossibly awkward; and stuttered\nand stumbled before I spoke:\n\n\"But surely--the convenances!  Your being here alone at night!  Mrs.\nGrundy--convention--the--\"\n\nShe interrupted me with an incomparable dignity--a dignity which had the\neffect of shutting me up like a clasp-knife and making me feel a decided\ninferior--and a poor show at that.  There was such a gracious simplicity\nand honesty in it, too, such self-respecting knowledge of herself and her\nposition, that I could be neither angry nor hurt.  I could only feel\nashamed of myself, and of my own littleness of mind and morals.  She\nseemed in her icy coldness--now spiritual as well as bodily--like an\nincarnate figure of Pride as she answered:\n\n\"What are convenances or conventions to me!  If you only knew where I\nhave come from--the existence (if it can be called so) which I have\nhad--the loneliness--the horror!  And besides, it is for me to _make_\nconventions, not to yield my personal freedom of action to them.  Even as\nI am--even here and in this garb--I am above convention.  Convenances do\nnot trouble me or hamper me.  That, at least, I have won by what I have\ngone through, even if it had never come to me through any other way.  Let\nme stay.\"  She said the last words, in spite of all her pride,\nappealingly.  But still, there was a note of high pride in all this--in\nall she said and did, in her attitude and movement, in the tones of her\nvoice, in the loftiness of her carriage and the steadfast look of her\nopen, starlit eyes.  Altogether, there was something so rarely lofty in\nherself and all that clad her that, face to face with it and with her, my\nfeeble attempt at moral precaution seemed puny, ridiculous, and out of\nplace.  Without a word in the doing, I took from an old chiffonier chest\nan armful of blankets, several of which I threw over her as she lay, for\nin the meantime, having replaced the coverlet, she had lain down at\nlength on the bed.  I took a chair, and sat down beside her.  When she\nstretched out her hand from beneath the pile of wraps, I took it in mine,\nsaying:\n\n\"Get warm and rest.  Sleep if you can.  You need not fear; I shall guard\nyou with my life.\"\n\nShe looked at me gratefully, her starry eyes taking a new light more full\nof illumination than was afforded by the wax candle, which was shaded\nfrom her by my body . . . She was horribly cold, and her teeth chattered\nso violently that I feared lest she should have incurred some dangerous\nevil from her wetting and the cold that followed it.  I felt, however, so\nawkward that I could find no words to express my fears; moreover, I\nhardly dared say anything at all regarding herself after the haughty way\nin which she had received my well-meant protest.  Manifestly I was but to\nher as a sort of refuge and provider of heat, altogether impersonal, and\nnot to be regarded in any degree as an individual.  In these humiliating\ncircumstances what could I do but sit quiet--and wait developments?\n\nLittle by little the fierce chattering of her teeth began to abate as the\nwarmth of her surroundings stole through her.  I also felt, even in this\nstrangely awakening position, the influence of the quiet; and sleep began\nto steal over me.  Several times I tried to fend it off, but, as I could\nnot make any overt movement without alarming my strange and beautiful\ncompanion, I had to yield myself to drowsiness.  I was still in such an\noverwhelming stupor of surprise that I could not even think freely.\nThere was nothing for me but to control myself and wait.  Before I could\nwell fix my thoughts I was asleep.\n\nI was recalled to consciousness by hearing, even through the pall of\nsleep that bound me, the crowing of a cock in some of the out-offices of\nthe castle.  At the same instant the figure, lying deathly still but for\nthe gentle heaving of her bosom, began to struggle wildly.  The sound had\nwon through the gates of her sleep also.  With a swift, gliding motion\nshe slipped from the bed to the floor, saying in a fierce whisper as she\npulled herself up to her full height:\n\n\"Let me out!  I must go!  I must go!\"\n\nBy this time I was fully awake, and the whole position of things came to\nme in an instant which I shall never--can never--forget: the dim light of\nthe candle, now nearly burned down to the socket, all the dimmer from the\nfact that the first grey gleam of morning was stealing in round the edges\nof the heavy curtain; the tall, slim figure in the brown dressing-gown\nwhose over-length trailed on the floor, the black hair showing glossy in\nthe light, and increasing by contrast the marble whiteness of the face,\nin which the black eyes sent through their stars fiery gleams.  She\nappeared quite in a frenzy of haste; her eagerness was simply\nirresistible.\n\nI was so stupefied with amazement, as well as with sleep, that I did not\nattempt to stop her, but began instinctively to help her by furthering\nher wishes.  As she ran behind the screen, and, as far as sound could\ninform me,--began frantically to disrobe herself of the warm\ndressing-gown and to don again the ice-cold wet shroud, I pulled back the\ncurtain from the window, and drew the bolt of the glass door.  As I did\nso she was already behind me, shivering.  As I threw open the door she\nglided out with a swift silent movement, but trembling in an agonized\nway.  As she passed me, she murmured in a low voice, which was almost\nlost in the chattering of her teeth:\n\n\"Oh, thank you--thank you a thousand times!  But I must go.  I _must_!  I\n_must_!  I shall come again, and try to show my gratitude.  Do not\ncondemn me as ungrateful--till then.\"  And she was gone.\n\nI watched her pass the length of the white path, flitting from shrub to\nshrub or statue as she had come.  In the cold grey light of the\nundeveloped dawn she seemed even more ghostly than she had done in the\nblack shadow of the night.\n\nWhen she disappeared from sight in the shadow of the wood, I stood on the\nterrace for a long time watching, in case I should be afforded another\nglimpse of her, for there was now no doubt in my mind that she had for me\nsome strange attraction.  I felt even then that the look in those\nglorious starry eyes would be with me always so long as I might live.\nThere was some fascination which went deeper than my eyes or my flesh or\nmy heart--down deep into the very depths of my soul.  My mind was all in\na whirl, so that I could hardly think coherently.  It all was like a\ndream; the reality seemed far away.  It was not possible to doubt that\nthe phantom figure which had been so close to me during the dark hours of\nthe night was actual flesh and blood.  Yet she was so cold, so cold!\nAltogether I could not fix my mind to either proposition: that it was a\nliving woman who had held my hand, or a dead body reanimated for the time\nor the occasion in some strange manner.\n\nThe difficulty was too great for me to make up my mind upon it, even had\nI wanted to.  But, in any case, I did not want to.  This would, no doubt,\ncome in time.  But till then I wished to dream on, as anyone does in a\ndream which can still be blissful though there be pauses of pain, or\nghastliness, or doubt, or terror.\n\nSo I closed the window and drew the curtain again, feeling for the first\ntime the cold in which I had stood on the wet marble floor of the terrace\nwhen my bare feet began to get warm on the soft carpet.  To get rid of\nthe chill feeling I got into the bed on which _she_ had lain, and as the\nwarmth restored me tried to think coherently.  For a short while I was\ngoing over the facts of the night--or what seemed as facts to my\nremembrance.  But as I continued to think, the possibilities of any\nresult seemed to get less, and I found myself vainly trying to reconcile\nwith the logic of life the grim episode of the night.  The effort proved\nto be too much for such concentration as was left to me; moreover,\ninterrupted sleep was clamant, and would not be denied.  What I dreamt\nof--if I dreamt at all--I know not.  I only know that I was ready for\nwaking when the time came.  It came with a violent knocking at my door.\nI sprang from bed, fully awake in a second, drew the bolt, and slipped\nback to bed.  With a hurried \"May I come in?\" Aunt Janet entered.  She\nseemed relieved when she saw me, and gave without my asking an\nexplanation of her perturbation:\n\n\"Oh, laddie, I hae been so uneasy aboot ye all the nicht.  I hae had\ndreams an' veesions an' a' sorts o' uncanny fancies.  I fear that--\"  She\nwas by now drawing back the curtain, and as her eyes took in the marks of\nwet all over the floor the current of her thoughts changed:\n\n\"Why, laddie, whativer hae ye been doin' wi' yer baith?  Oh, the mess ye\nhae made!  'Tis sinful to gie sic trouble an' waste . . . \"  And so she\nwent on.  I was glad to hear the tirade, which was only what a good\nhousewife, outraged in her sentiments of order, would have made.  I\nlistened in patience--with pleasure when I thought of what she would have\nthought (and said) had she known the real facts.  I was well pleased to\nhave got off so easily.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                         _April_ 10, 1907.\n\nFor some days after what I call \"the episode\" I was in a strange\ncondition of mind.  I did not take anyone--not even Aunt Janet--into\nconfidence.  Even she dear, and open-hearted and liberal-minded as she\nis, might not have understood well enough to be just and tolerant; and I\ndid not care to hear any adverse comment on my strange visitor.  Somehow\nI could not bear the thought of anyone finding fault with her or in her,\nthough, strangely enough, I was eternally defending her to myself; for,\ndespite my wishes, embarrassing thoughts _would_ come again and again,\nand again in all sorts and variants of queries difficult to answer.  I\nfound myself defending her, sometimes as a woman hard pressed by\nspiritual fear and physical suffering, sometimes as not being amenable to\nlaws that govern the Living.  Indeed, I could not make up my mind whether\nI looked on her as a living human being or as one with some strange\nexistence in another world, and having only a chance foothold in our own.\nIn such doubt imagination began to work, and thoughts of evil, of danger,\nof doubt, even of fear, began to crowd on me with such persistence and in\nsuch varied forms that I found my instinct of reticence growing into a\nsettled purpose.  The value of this instinctive precaution was promptly\nshown by Aunt Janet's state of mind, with consequent revelation of it.\nShe became full of gloomy prognostications and what I thought were morbid\nfears.  For the first time in my life I discovered that Aunt Janet had\nnerves!  I had long had a secret belief that she was gifted, to some\ndegree at any rate, with Second Sight, which quality, or whatever it is,\nskilled in the powers if not the lore of superstition, manages to keep at\nstretch not only the mind of its immediate pathic, but of others relevant\nto it.  Perhaps this natural quality had received a fresh impetus from\nthe arrival of some cases of her books sent on by Sir Colin.  She\nappeared to read and reread these works, which were chiefly on occult\nsubjects, day and night, except when she was imparting to me choice\nexcerpts of the most baleful and fearsome kind.  Indeed, before a week\nwas over I found myself to be an expert in the history of the cult, as\nwell as in its manifestations, which latter I had been versed in for a\ngood many years.\n\nThe result of all this was that it set me brooding.  Such, at least, I\ngathered was the fact when Aunt Janet took me to task for it.  She always\nspeaks out according to her convictions, so that her thinking I brooded\nwas to me a proof that I did; and after a personal examination I\ncame--reluctantly--to the conclusion that she was right, so far, at any\nrate, as my outer conduct was concerned.  The state of mind I was in,\nhowever, kept me from making any acknowledgment of it--the real cause of\nmy keeping so much to myself and of being so _distrait_.  And so I went\non, torturing myself as before with introspective questioning; and she,\nwith her mind set on my actions, and endeavouring to find a cause for\nthem, continued and expounded her beliefs and fears.\n\nHer nightly chats with me when we were alone after dinner--for I had come\nto avoid her questioning at other times--kept my imagination at high\npressure.  Despite myself, I could not but find new cause for concern in\nthe perennial founts of her superstition.  I had thought, years ago, that\nI had then sounded the depths of this branch of psychicism; but this new\nphase of thought, founded on the really deep hold which the existence of\nmy beautiful visitor and her sad and dreadful circumstances had taken\nupon me, brought me a new concern in the matter of self-importance.  I\ncame to think that I must reconstruct my self-values, and begin a fresh\nunderstanding of ethical beliefs.  Do what I would, my mind would keep\nturning on the uncanny subjects brought before it.  I began to apply them\none by one to my own late experience, and unconsciously to try to fit\nthem in turn to the present case.\n\nThe effect of this brooding was that I was, despite my own will, struck\nby the similarity of circumstances bearing on my visitor, and the\nconditions apportioned by tradition and superstition to such strange\nsurvivals from earlier ages as these partial existences which are rather\nUndead than Living--still walking the earth, though claimed by the world\nof the Dead.  Amongst them are the Vampire, or the Wehr-Wolf.  To this\nclass also might belong in a measure the Doppelganger--one of whose dual\nexistences commonly belongs to the actual world around it.  So, too, the\ndenizens of the world of Astralism.  In any of these named worlds there\nis a material presence--which must be created, if only for a single or\nperiodic purpose.  It matters not whether a material presence already\ncreated can be receptive of a disembodied soul, or a soul unattached can\nhave a body built up for it or around it; or, again, whether the body of\na dead person can be made seeming quick through some diabolic influence\nmanifested in the present, or an inheritance or result of some baleful\nuse of malefic power in the past.  The result is the same in each case,\nthough the ways be widely different: a soul and a body which are not in\nunity but brought together for strange purposes through stranger means\nand by powers still more strange.\n\nThrough much thought and a process of exclusions the eerie form which\nseemed to be most in correspondence with my adventure, and most suitable\nto my fascinating visitor, appeared to be the Vampire.  Doppelganger,\nAstral creations, and all such-like, did not comply with the conditions\nof my night experience.  The Wehr-Wolf is but a variant of the Vampire,\nand so needed not to be classed or examined at all.  Then it was that,\nthus focussed, the Lady of the Shroud (for so I came to hold her in my\nmind) began to assume a new force.  Aunt Janet's library afforded me\nclues which I followed with avidity.  In my secret heart I hated the\nquest, and did not wish to go on with it.  But in this I was not my own\nmaster.  Do what I would--brush away doubts never so often, new doubts\nand imaginings came in their stead.  The circumstance almost repeated the\nparable of the Seven Devils who took the place of the exorcised one.\nDoubts I could stand.  Imaginings I could stand.  But doubts and\nimaginings together made a force so fell that I was driven to accept any\nreading of the mystery which might presumably afford a foothold for\nsatisfying thought.  And so I came to accept tentatively the Vampire\ntheory--accept it, at least, so far as to examine it as judicially as was\ngiven me to do.  As the days wore on, so the conviction grew.  The more I\nread on the subject, the more directly the evidences pointed towards this\nview.  The more I thought, the more obstinate became the conviction.  I\nransacked Aunt Janet's volumes again and again to find anything to the\ncontrary; but in vain.  Again, no matter how obstinate were my\nconvictions at any given time, unsettlement came with fresh thinking over\nthe argument, so that I was kept in a harassing state of uncertainty.\n\nBriefly, the evidence in favour of accord between the facts of the case\nand the Vampire theory were:\n\nHer coming was at night--the time the Vampire is according to the theory,\nfree to move at will.\n\nShe wore her shroud--a necessity of coming fresh from grave or tomb; for\nthere is nothing occult about clothing which is not subject to astral or\nother influences.\n\nShe had to be helped into my room--in strict accordance with what one\nsceptical critic of occultism has called \"the Vampire etiquette.\"\n\nShe made violent haste in getting away at cock-crow.\n\nShe seemed preternaturally cold; her sleep was almost abnormal in\nintensity, and yet the sound of the cock-crowing came through it.\n\nThese things showed her to be subject to _some_ laws, though not in exact\naccord within those which govern human beings.  Under the stress of such\ncircumstances as she must have gone through, her vitality seemed more\nthan human--the quality of vitality which could outlive ordinary burial.\nAgain, such purpose as she had shown in donning, under stress of some\ncompelling direction, her ice-cold wet shroud, and, wrapt in it, going\nout again into the night, was hardly normal for a woman.\n\nBut if so, and if she was indeed a Vampire, might not whatever it may be\nthat holds such beings in thrall be by some means or other exorcised?  To\nfind the means must be my next task.  I am actually pining to see her\nagain.  Never before have I been stirred to my depths by anyone.  Come it\nfrom Heaven or Hell, from the Earth or the Grave, it does not matter; I\nshall make it my task to win her back to life and peace.  If she be\nindeed a Vampire, the task may be hard and long; if she be not so, and if\nit be merely that circumstances have so gathered round her as to produce\nthat impression, the task may be simpler and the result more sweet.  No,\nnot more sweet; for what can be more sweet than to restore the lost or\nseemingly lost soul of the woman you love!  There, the truth is out at\nlast!  I suppose that I have fallen in love with her.  If so, it is too\nlate for me to fight against it.  I can only wait with what patience I\ncan till I see her again.  But to that end I can do nothing.  I know\nabsolutely nothing about her--not even her name.  Patience!\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                         _April_ 16, 1907.\n\nThe only relief I have had from the haunting anxiety regarding the Lady\nof the Shroud has been in the troubled state of my adopted country.\nThere has evidently been something up which I have not been allowed to\nknow.  The mountaineers are troubled and restless; are wandering about,\nsingly and in parties, and holding meetings in strange places.  This is\nwhat I gather used to be in old days when intrigues were on foot with\nTurks, Greeks, Austrians, Italians, Russians.  This concerns me vitally,\nfor my mind has long been made up to share the fortunes of the Land of\nthe Blue Mountains.  For good or ill I mean to stay here: _J'y suis_,\n_j'y reste_.  I share henceforth the lot of the Blue Mountaineers; and\nnot Turkey, nor Greece, nor Austria, nor Italy, nor Russia--no, not\nFrance nor Germany either; not man nor God nor Devil shall drive me from\nmy purpose.  With these patriots I throw in my lot!  My only difficulty\nseemed at first to be with the men themselves.  They are so proud that at\nthe beginning I feared they would not even accord me the honour of being\none of them!  However, things always move on somehow, no matter what\ndifficulties there be at the beginning.  Never mind!  When one looks back\nat an accomplished fact the beginning is not to be seen--and if it were\nit would not matter.  It is not of any account, anyhow.\n\nI heard that there was going to be a great meeting near here yesterday\nafternoon, and I attended it.  I think it was a success.  If such is any\nproof, I felt elated as well as satisfied when I came away.  Aunt Janet's\nSecond Sight on the subject was comforting, though grim, and in a measure\ndisconcerting.  When I was saying good-night she asked me to bend down my\nhead.  As I did so, she laid her hands on it and passed them all over it.\nI heard her say to herself:\n\n\"Strange!  There's nothing there; yet I could have sworn I saw it!\"  I\nasked her to explain, but she would not.  For once she was a little\nobstinate, and refused point blank to even talk of the subject.  She was\nnot worried nor unhappy; so I had no cause for concern.  I said nothing,\nbut I shall wait and see.  Most mysteries become plain or disappear\naltogether in time.  But about the meeting--lest I forget!\n\nWhen I joined the mountaineers who had assembled, I really think they\nwere glad to see me; though some of them seemed adverse, and others did\nnot seem over well satisfied.  However, absolute unity is very seldom to\nbe found.  Indeed, it is almost impossible; and in a free community is\nnot altogether to be desired.  When it is apparent, the gathering lacks\nthat sense of individual feeling which makes for the real consensus of\nopinion--which is the real unity of purpose.  The meeting was at first,\ntherefore, a little cold and distant.  But presently it began to thaw,\nand after some fiery harangues I was asked to speak.  Happily, I had\nbegun to learn the Balkan language as soon as ever Uncle Roger's wishes\nhad been made known to me, and as I have some facility of tongues and a\ngreat deal of experience, I soon began to know something of it.  Indeed,\nwhen I had been here a few weeks, with opportunity of speaking daily with\nthe people themselves, and learned to understand the intonations and\nvocal inflexions, I felt quite easy in speaking it.  I understood every\nword which had up to then been spoken at the meeting, and when I spoke\nmyself I felt that they understood.  That is an experience which every\nspeaker has in a certain way and up to a certain point.  He knows by some\nkind of instinct if his hearers are with him; if they respond, they must\ncertainly have understood.  Last night this was marked.  I felt it every\ninstant I was talking and when I came to realize that the men were in\nstrict accord with my general views, I took them into confidence with\nregard to my own personal purpose.  It was the beginning of a mutual\ntrust; so for peroration I told them that I had come to the conclusion\nthat what they wanted most for their own protection and the security and\nconsolidation of their nation was arms--arms of the very latest pattern.\nHere they interrupted me with wild cheers, which so strung me up that I\nwent farther than I intended, and made a daring venture.  \"Ay,\" I\nrepeated, \"the security and consolidation of your country--of _our_\ncountry, for I have come to live amongst you.  Here is my home whilst I\nlive.  I am with you heart and soul.  I shall live with you, fight\nshoulder to shoulder with you, and, if need be, shall die with you!\"\nHere the shouting was terrific, and the younger men raised their guns to\nfire a salute in Blue Mountain fashion.  But on the instant the Vladika\n{1} held up his hands and motioned them to desist.  In the immediate\nsilence he spoke, sharply at first, but later ascending to a high pitch\nof single-minded, lofty eloquence.  His words rang in my ears long after\nthe meeting was over and other thoughts had come between them and the\npresent.\n\n\"Silence!\" he thundered.  \"Make no echoes in the forest or through the\nhills at this dire time of stress and threatened danger to our land.\nBethink ye of this meeting, held here and in secret, in order that no\nwhisper of it may be heard afar.  Have ye all, brave men of the Blue\nMountains, come hither through the forest like shadows that some of you,\nthoughtless, may enlighten your enemies as to our secret purpose?  The\nthunder of your guns would doubtless sound well in the ears of those who\nwish us ill and try to work us wrong.  Fellow-countrymen, know ye not\nthat the Turk is awake once more for our harming?  The Bureau of Spies\nhas risen from the torpor which came on it when the purpose against our\nTeuta roused our mountains to such anger that the frontiers blazed with\npassion, and were swept with fire and sword.  Moreover, there is a\ntraitor somewhere in the land, or else incautious carelessness has served\nthe same base purpose.  Something of our needs--our doing, whose secret\nwe have tried to hide, has gone out.  The myrmidons of the Turk are close\non our borders, and it may be that some of them have passed our guards\nand are amidst us unknown.  So it behoves us doubly to be discreet.\nBelieve me that I share with you, my brothers, our love for the gallant\nEnglishman who has come amongst us to share our sorrows and\nambitions--and I trust it may be our joys.  We are all united in the wish\nto do him honour--though not in the way by which danger might be carried\non the wings of love.  My brothers, our newest brother comes to us from\nthe Great Nation which amongst the nations has been our only friend, and\nwhich has ere now helped us in our direst need--that mighty Britain whose\nhand has ever been raised in the cause of freedom.  We of the Blue\nMountains know her best as she stands with sword in hand face to face\nwith our foes.  And this, her son and now our brother, brings further to\nour need the hand of a giant and the heart of a lion.  Later on, when\ndanger does not ring us round, when silence is no longer our outer guard;\nwe shall bid him welcome in true fashion of our land.  But till then he\nwill believe--for he is great-hearted--that our love and thanks and\nwelcome are not to be measured by sound.  When the time comes, then shall\nbe sound in his honour--not of rifles alone, but bells and cannon and the\nmighty voice of a free people shouting as one.  But now we must be wise\nand silent, for the Turk is once again at our gates.  Alas! the cause of\nhis former coming may not be, for she whose beauty and nobility and whose\nplace in our nation and in our hearts tempted him to fraud and violence\nis not with us to share even our anxiety.\"\n\nHere his voice broke, and there arose from all a deep wailing sound,\nwhich rose and rose till the woods around us seemed broken by a mighty\nand long-sustained sob.  The orator saw that his purpose was\naccomplished, and with a short sentence finished his harangue: \"But the\nneed of our nation still remains!\"  Then, with an eloquent gesture to me\nto proceed, he merged in the crowd and disappeared.\n\nHow could I even attempt to follow such a speaker with any hope of\nsuccess?  I simply told them what I had already done in the way of help,\nsaying:\n\n\"As you needed arms, I have got them.  My agent sends me word through the\ncode between us that he has procured for me--for us--fifty thousand of\nthe newest-pattern rifles, the French Ingis-Malbron, which has surpassed\nall others, and sufficient ammunition to last for a year of war.  The\nfirst section is in hand, and will soon be ready for consignment.  There\nare other war materials, too, which, when they arrive, will enable every\nman and woman--even the children--of our land to take a part in its\ndefence should such be needed.  My brothers, I am with you in all things,\nfor good or ill!\"\n\nIt made me very proud to hear the mighty shout which arose.  I had felt\nexalted before, but now this personal development almost unmanned me.  I\nwas glad of the long-sustained applause to recover my self-control.\n\nI was quite satisfied that the meeting did not want to hear any other\nspeaker, for they began to melt away without any formal notification\nhaving been given.  I doubt if there will be another meeting soon again.\nThe weather has begun to break, and we are in for another spell of rain.\nIt is disagreeable, of course; but it has its own charm.  It was during a\nspell of wet weather that the Lady of the Shroud came to me.  Perhaps the\nrain may bring her again.  I hope so, with all my soul.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                         _April_ 23, 1907.\n\nThe rain has continued for four whole days and nights, and the low-lying\nground is like a quagmire in places.  In the sunlight the whole mountains\nglisten with running streams and falling water.  I feel a strange kind of\nelation, but from no visible cause.  Aunt Janet rather queered it by\ntelling me, as she said good-night, to be very careful of myself, as she\nhad seen in a dream last night a figure in a shroud.  I fear she was not\npleased that I did not take it with all the seriousness that she did.  I\nwould not wound her for the world if I could help it, but the idea of a\nshroud gets too near the bone to be safe, and I had to fend her off at\nall hazards.  So when I doubted if the Fates regarded the visionary\nshroud as of necessity appertaining to me, she said, in a way that was,\nfor her, almost sharp:\n\n\"Take care, laddie.  'Tis ill jesting wi' the powers o' time Unknown.\"\n\nPerhaps it was that her talk put the subject in my mind.  The woman\nneeded no such aid; she was always there; but when I locked myself into\nmy room that night, I half expected to find her in the room.  I was not\nsleepy, so I took a book of Aunt Janet's and began to read.  The title\nwas \"On the Powers and Qualities of Disembodied Spirits.\"  \"Your\ngrammar,\" said I to the author, \"is hardly attractive, but I may learn\nsomething which might apply to her.  I shall read your book.\"  Before\nsettling down to it, however, I thought I would have a look at the\ngarden.  Since the night of the visit the garden seemed to have a new\nattractiveness for me: a night seldom passed without my having a last\nlook at it before turning in.  So I drew the great curtain and looked\nout.\n\nThe scene was beautiful, but almost entirely desolate.  All was ghastly\nin the raw, hard gleams of moonlight coming fitfully through the masses\nof flying cloud.  The wind was rising, and the air was damp and cold.  I\nlooked round the room instinctively, and noticed that the fire was laid\nready for lighting, and that there were small-cut logs of wood piled\nbeside the hearth.  Ever since that night I have had a fire laid ready.\nI was tempted to light it, but as I never have a fire unless I sleep in\nthe open, I hesitated to begin.  I went back to the window, and, opening\nthe catch, stepped out on the terrace.  As I looked down the white walk\nand let my eyes range over the expanse of the garden, where everything\nglistened as the moonlight caught the wet, I half expected to see some\nwhite figure flitting amongst the shrubs and statues.  The whole scene of\nthe former visit came back to me so vividly that I could hardly believe\nthat any time had passed since then.  It was the same scene, and again\nlate in the evening.  Life in Vissarion was primitive, and early hours\nprevailed--though not so late as on that night.\n\nAs I looked I thought I caught a glimpse of something white far away.  It\nwas only a ray of moonlight coming through the rugged edge of a cloud.\nBut all the same it set me in a strange state of perturbation.  Somehow I\nseemed to lose sight of my own identity.  It was as though I was\nhypnotized by the situation or by memory, or perhaps by some occult\nforce.  Without thinking of what I was doing, or being conscious of any\nreason for it, I crossed the room and set light to the fire.  Then I blew\nout the candle and came to the window again.  I never thought it might be\na foolish thing to do--to stand at a window with a light behind me in\nthis country, where every man carries a gun with him always.  I was in my\nevening clothes, too, with my breast well marked by a white shirt.  I\nopened the window and stepped out on the terrace.  There I stood for many\nminutes, thinking.  All the time my eyes kept ranging over the garden.\nOnce I thought I saw a white figure moving, but it was not followed up,\nso, becoming conscious that it was again beginning to rain, I stepped\nback into the room, shut the window, and drew the curtain.  Then I\nrealized the comforting appearance of the fire, and went over and stood\nbefore it.\n\nHark!  Once more there was a gentle tapping at the window.  I rushed over\nto it and drew the curtain.\n\nThere, out on the rain-beaten terrace, stood the white shrouded figure,\nmore desolate-appearing than ever.  Ghastly pale she looked, as before,\nbut her eyes had an eager look which was new.  I took it that she was\nattracted by the fire, which was by now well ablaze, and was throwing up\njets of flame as the dry logs crackled.  The leaping flames threw fitful\nlight across the room, and every gleam threw the white-clad figure into\nprominence, showing the gleam of the black eyes, and fixing the stars\nthat lay in them.\n\nWithout a word I threw open the window, and, taking the white hand\nextended to me, drew into the room the Lady of the Shroud.\n\nAs she entered and felt the warmth of the blazing fire, a glad look\nspread over her face.  She made a movement as if to run to it.  But she\ndrew back an instant after, looking round with instinctive caution.  She\nclosed the window and bolted it, touched the lever which spread the\ngrille across the opening, and pulled close the curtain behind it.  Then\nshe went swiftly to the door and tried if it was locked.  Satisfied as to\nthis, she came quickly over to the fire, and, kneeling before it,\nstretched out her numbed hands to the blaze.  Almost on the instant her\nwet shroud began to steam.  I stood wondering.  The precautions of\nsecrecy in the midst of her suffering--for that she did suffer was only\ntoo painfully manifest--must have presupposed some danger.  Then and\nthere my mind was made up that there should no harm assail her that I by\nany means could fend off.  Still, the present must be attended to;\npneumonia and other ills stalked behind such a chill as must infallibly\ncome on her unless precautions were taken.  I took again the\ndressing-gown which she had worn before and handed it to her, motioning\nas I did so towards the screen which had made a dressing-room for her on\nthe former occasion.  To my surprise she hesitated.  I waited.  She\nwaited, too, and then laid down the dressing-gown on the edge of the\nstone fender.  So I spoke:\n\n\"Won't you change as you did before?  Your--your frock can then be dried.\nDo!  It will be so much safer for you to be dry clad when you resume your\nown dress.\"\n\n\"How can I whilst you are here?\"\n\nHer words made me stare, so different were they from her acts of the\nother visit.  I simply bowed--speech on such a subject would be at least\ninadequate--and walked over to the window.  Passing behind the curtain, I\nopened the window.  Before stepping out on to the terrace, I looked into\nthe room and said:\n\n\"Take your own time.  There is no hurry.  I dare say you will find there\nall you may want.  I shall remain on the terrace until you summon me.\"\nWith that I went out on the terrace, drawing close the glass door behind\nme.\n\nI stood looking out on the dreary scene for what seemed a very short\ntime, my mind in a whirl.  There came a rustle from within, and I saw a\ndark brown figure steal round the edge of the curtain.  A white hand was\nraised, and beckoned me to come in.  I entered, bolting the window behind\nme.  She had passed across the room, and was again kneeling before the\nfire with her hands outstretched.  The shroud was laid in partially\nopened folds on one side of the hearth, and was steaming heavily.  I\nbrought over some cushions and pillows, and made a little pile of them\nbeside her.\n\n\"Sit there,\" I said, \"and rest quietly in the heat.\"  It may have been\nthe effect of the glowing heat, but there was a rich colour in her face\nas she looked at me with shining eyes.  Without a word, but with a\ncourteous little bow, she sat down at once.  I put a thick rug across her\nshoulders, and sat down myself on a stool a couple of feet away.\n\nFor fully five or six minutes we sat in silence.  At last, turning her\nhead towards me she said in a sweet, low voice:\n\n\"I had intended coming earlier on purpose to thank you for your very\nsweet and gracious courtesy to me, but circumstances were such that I\ncould not leave my--my\"--she hesitated before saying--\"my abode.  I am\nnot free, as you and others are, to do what I will.  My existence is\nsadly cold and stern, and full of horrors that appal.  But I _do_ thank\nyou.  For myself I am not sorry for the delay, for every hour shows me\nmore clearly how good and understanding and sympathetic you have been to\nme.  I only hope that some day you may realize how kind you have been,\nand how much I appreciate it.\"\n\n\"I am only too glad to be of any service,\" I said, feebly I felt, as I\nheld out my hand.  She did not seem to see it.  Her eyes were now on the\nfire, and a warm blush dyed forehead and cheek and neck.  The reproof was\nso gentle that no one could have been offended.  It was evident that she\nwas something coy and reticent, and would not allow me to come at present\nmore close to her, even to the touching of her hand.  But that her heart\nwas not in the denial was also evident in the glance from her glorious\ndark starry eyes.  These glances--veritable lightning flashes coming\nthrough her pronounced reserve--finished entirely any wavering there\nmight be in my own purpose.  I was aware now to the full that my heart\nwas quite subjugated.  I knew that I was in love--veritably so much in\nlove as to feel that without this woman, be she what she might, by my\nside my future must be absolutely barren.\n\nIt was presently apparent that she did not mean to stay as long on this\noccasion as on the last.  When the castle clock struck midnight she\nsuddenly sprang to her feet with a bound, saying:\n\n\"I must go!  There is midnight!\"  I rose at once, the intensity of her\nspeech having instantly obliterated the sleep which, under the influence\nof rest and warmth, was creeping upon me.  Once more she was in a frenzy\nof haste, so I hurried towards the window, but as I looked back saw her,\ndespite her haste, still standing.  I motioned towards the screen, and\nslipping behind the curtain, opened the window and went out on the\nterrace.  As I was disappearing behind the curtain I saw her with the\ntail of my eye lifting the shroud, now dry, from the hearth.\n\nShe was out through the window in an incredibly short time, now clothed\nonce more in that dreadful wrapping.  As she sped past me barefooted on\nthe wet, chilly marble which made her shudder, she whispered:\n\n\"Thank you again.  You _are_ good to me.  You can understand.\"\n\nOnce again I stood on the terrace, saw her melt like a shadow down the\nsteps, and disappear behind the nearest shrub.  Thence she flitted away\nfrom point to point with exceeding haste.  The moonlight had now\ndisappeared behind heavy banks of cloud, so there was little light to see\nby.  I could just distinguish a pale gleam here and there as she wended\nher secret way.\n\nFor a long time I stood there alone thinking, as I watched the course she\nhad taken, and wondering where might be her ultimate destination.  As she\nhad spoken of her \"abode,\" I knew there was some definitive objective of\nher flight.\n\nIt was no use wondering.  I was so entirely ignorant of her surroundings\nthat I had not even a starting-place for speculation.  So I went in,\nleaving the window open.  It seemed that this being so made one barrier\nthe less between us.  I gathered the cushions and rugs from before the\nfire, which was no longer leaping, but burning with a steady glow, and\nput them back in their places.  Aunt Janet might come in the morning, as\nshe had done before, and I did not wish to set her thinking.  She is much\ntoo clever a person to have treading on the heels of a\nmystery--especially one in which my own affections are engaged.  I wonder\nwhat she would have said had she seen me kiss the cushion on which my\nbeautiful guest's head had rested?\n\nWhen I was in bed, and in the dark save for the fading glow of the fire,\nmy thoughts became fixed that whether she came from Earth or Heaven or\nHell, my lovely visitor was already more to me than aught else in the\nworld.  This time she had, on going, said no word of returning.  I had\nbeen so much taken up with her presence, and so upset by her abrupt\ndeparture, that I had omitted to ask her.  And so I am driven, as before,\nto accept the chance of her returning--a chance which I fear I am or may\nbe unable to control.\n\nSurely enough Aunt Janet did come in the morning, early.  I was still\nasleep when she knocked at my door.  With that purely physical\nsubconsciousness which comes with habit I must have realized the cause of\nthe sound, for I woke fully conscious of the fact that Aunt Janet had\nknocked and was waiting to come in.  I jumped from bed, and back again\nwhen I had unlocked the door.  When Aunt Janet came in she noticed the\ncold of the room.\n\n\"Save us, laddie, but ye'll get your death o' cold in this room.\"  Then,\nas she looked round and noticed the ashes of the extinct fire in the\ngrate:\n\n\"Eh, but ye're no that daft after a'; ye've had the sense to light yer\nfire.  Glad I am that we had the fire laid and a wheen o' dry logs ready\nto yer hand.\"  She evidently felt the cold air coming from the window,\nfor she went over and drew the curtain.  When she saw the open window,\nshe raised her hands in a sort of dismay, which to me, knowing how little\nbase for concern could be within her knowledge, was comic.  Hurriedly she\nshut the window, and then, coming close over to my bed, said:\n\n\"Yon has been a fearsome nicht again, laddie, for yer poor auld aunty.\"\n\n\"Dreaming again, Aunt Janet?\" I asked--rather flippantly as it seemed to\nme.  She shook her head:\n\n\"Not so, Rupert, unless it be that the Lord gies us in dreams what we in\nour spiritual darkness think are veesions.\"  I roused up at this.  When\nAunt Janet calls me Rupert, as she always used to do in my dear mother's\ntime, things are serious with her.  As I was back in childhood now,\nrecalled by her word, I thought the best thing I could do to cheer her\nwould be to bring her back there too--if I could.  So I patted the edge\nof the bed as I used to do when I was a wee kiddie and wanted her to\ncomfort me, and said:\n\n\"Sit down, Aunt Janet, and tell me.\"  She yielded at once, and the look\nof the happy old days grew over her face as though there had come a gleam\nof sunshine.  She sat down, and I put out my hands as I used to do, and\ntook her hand between them.  There was a tear in her eye as she raised my\nhand and kissed it as in old times.  But for the infinite pathos of it,\nit would have been comic:\n\nAunt Janet, old and grey-haired, but still retaining her girlish slimness\nof figure, petite, dainty as a Dresden figure, her face lined with the\ncare of years, but softened and ennobled by the unselfishness of those\nyears, holding up my big hand, which would outweigh her whole arm;\nsitting dainty as a pretty old fairy beside a recumbent giant--for my\nbulk never seems so great as when I am near this real little good fairy\nof my life--seven feet beside four feet seven.\n\nSo she began as of old, as though she were about to soothe a frightened\nchild with a fairy tale:\n\n\"'Twas a veesion, I think, though a dream it may hae been.  But whichever\nor whatever it was, it concerned my little boy, who has grown to be a big\ngiant, so much that I woke all of a tremble.  Laddie dear, I thought that\nI saw ye being married.\"  This gave me an opening, though a small one,\nfor comforting her, so I took it at once:\n\n\"Why, dear, there isn't anything to alarm you in that, is there?  It was\nonly the other day when you spoke to me about the need of my getting\nmarried, if it was only that you might have children of your boy playing\naround your knees as their father used to do when he was a helpless wee\nchild himself.\"\n\n\"That is so, laddie,\" she answered gravely.  \"But your weddin' was none\nso merry as I fain would see.  True, you seemed to lo'e her wi' all yer\nhairt.  Yer eyes shone that bright that ye might ha' set her afire, for\nall her black locks and her winsome face.  But, laddie, that was not\nall--no, not though her black een, that had the licht o' all the stars o'\nnicht in them, shone in yours as though a hairt o' love an' passion, too,\ndwelt in them.  I saw ye join hands, an' heard a strange voice that\ntalked stranger still, but I saw none ither.  Your eyes an' her eyes, an'\nyour hand an' hers, were all I saw.  For all else was dim, and the\ndarkness was close around ye twa.  And when the benison was spoken--I\nknew that by the voices that sang, and by the gladness of her een, as\nwell as by the pride and glory of yours--the licht began to glow a wee\nmore, an' I could see yer bride.  She was in a veil o' wondrous fine\nlace.  And there were orange-flowers in her hair, though there were\ntwigs, too, and there was a crown o' flowers on head wi' a golden band\nround it.  And the heathen candles that stood on the table wi' the Book\nhad some strange effect, for the reflex o' it hung in the air o'er her\nhead like the shadow of a crown.  There was a gold ring on her finger and\na silver one on yours.\"  Here she paused and trembled, so that, hoping to\ndispel her fears, I said, as like as I could to the way I used to when I\nwas a child:\n\n\"Go on, Aunt Janet.\"\n\nShe did not seem to recognize consciously the likeness between past and\npresent; but the effect was there, for she went on more like her old\nself, though there was a prophetic gravity in her voice, more marked than\nI had ever heard from her:\n\n\"All this I've told ye was well; but, oh, laddie, there was a dreadful\nlack o' livin' joy such as I should expect from the woman whom my boy had\nchosen for his wife--and at the marriage coupling, too!  And no wonder,\nwhen all is said; for though the marriage veil o' love was fine, an' the\ngarland o' flowers was fresh-gathered, underneath them a' was nane ither\nthan a ghastly shroud.  As I looked in my veesion--or maybe dream--I\nexpectit to see the worms crawl round the flagstane at her feet.  If\n'twas not Death, laddie dear, that stood by ye, it was the shadow o'\nDeath that made the darkness round ye, that neither the light o' candles\nnor the smoke o' heathen incense could pierce.  Oh, laddie, laddie, wae\nis me that I hae seen sic a veesion--waking or sleeping, it matters not!\nI was sair distressed--so sair that I woke wi' a shriek on my lips and\nbathed in cold sweat.  I would hae come doon to ye to see if you were\nhearty or no--or even to listen at your door for any sound o' yer being\nquick, but that I feared to alarm ye till morn should come.  I've counted\nthe hours and the minutes since midnight, when I saw the veesion, till I\ncame hither just the now.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Aunt Janet,\" I said, \"and I thank you for your kind thought\nfor me in the matter, now and always.\"  Then I went on, for I wanted to\ntake precautions against the possibility of her discovery of my secret.\nI could not bear to think that she might run my precious secret to earth\nin any well-meant piece of bungling.  That would be to me disaster\nunbearable.  She might frighten away altogether my beautiful visitor,\neven whose name or origin I did not know, and I might never see her\nagain:\n\n\"You must never do that, Aunt Janet.  You and I are too good friends to\nhave sense of distrust or annoyance come between us--which would surely\nhappen if I had to keep thinking that you or anyone else might be\nwatching me.\"\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                         _April_ 27, 1907.\n\nAfter a spell of loneliness which has seemed endless I have something to\nwrite.  When the void in my heart was becoming the receptacle for many\ndevils of suspicion and distrust I set myself a task which might, I\nthought, keep my thoughts in part, at any rate, occupied--to explore\nminutely the neighbourhood round the Castle.  This might, I hoped, serve\nas an anodyne to my pain of loneliness, which grew more acute as the\ndays, the hours, wore on, even if it should not ultimately afford me some\nclue to the whereabouts of the woman whom I had now grown to love so\nmadly.\n\nMy exploration soon took a systematic form, as I intended that it should\nbe exhaustive.  I would take every day a separate line of advance from\nthe Castle, beginning at the south and working round by the east to the\nnorth.  The first day only took me to the edge of the creek, which I\ncrossed in a boat, and landed at the base of the cliff opposite.  I found\nthe cliffs alone worth a visit.  Here and there were openings to caves\nwhich I made up my mind to explore later.  I managed to climb up the\ncliff at a spot less beetling than the rest, and continued my journey.\nIt was, though very beautiful, not a specially interesting place.  I\nexplored that spoke of the wheel of which Vissarion was the hub, and got\nback just in time for dinner.\n\nThe next day I took a course slightly more to the eastward.  I had no\ndifficulty in keeping a straight path, for, once I had rowed across the\ncreek, the old church of St. Sava rose before me in stately gloom.  This\nwas the spot where many generations of the noblest of the Land of the\nBlue Mountains had from time immemorial been laid to rest, amongst them\nthe Vissarions.  Again, I found the opposite cliffs pierced here and\nthere with caves, some with wide openings,--others the openings of which\nwere partly above and partly below water.  I could, however, find no\nmeans of climbing the cliff at this part, and had to make a long detour,\nfollowing up the line of the creek till further on I found a piece of\nbeach from which ascent was possible.  Here I ascended, and found that I\nwas on a line between the Castle and the southern side of the mountains.\nI saw the church of St. Sava away to my right, and not far from the edge\nof the cliff.  I made my way to it at once, for as yet I had never been\nnear it.  Hitherto my excursions had been limited to the Castle and its\nmany gardens and surroundings.  It was of a style with which I was not\nfamiliar--with four wings to the points of the compass.  The great\ndoorway, set in a magnificent frontage of carved stone of manifestly\nancient date, faced west, so that, when one entered, he went east.  To my\nsurprise--for somehow I expected the contrary--I found the door open.\nNot wide open, but what is called ajar--manifestly not locked or barred,\nbut not sufficiently open for one to look in.  I entered, and after\npassing through a wide vestibule, more like a section of a corridor than\nan ostensible entrance, made my way through a spacious doorway into the\nbody of the church.  The church itself was almost circular, the openings\nof the four naves being spacious enough to give the appearance of the\ninterior as a whole, being a huge cross.  It was strangely dim, for the\nwindow openings were small and high-set, and were, moreover, filled with\ngreen or blue glass, each window having a colour to itself.  The glass\nwas very old, being of the thirteenth or fourteenth century.  Such\nappointments as there were--for it had a general air of desolation--were\nof great beauty and richness,--especially so to be in a place--even a\nchurch--where the door lay open, and no one was to be seen.  It was\nstrangely silent even for an old church on a lonesome headland.  There\nreigned a dismal solemnity which seemed to chill me, accustomed as I have\nbeen to strange and weird places.  It seemed abandoned, though it had not\nthat air of having been neglected which is so often to be noticed in old\nchurches.  There was none of the everlasting accumulation of dust which\nprevails in places of higher cultivation and larger and more strenuous\nwork.\n\nIn the church itself or its appending chambers I could find no clue or\nsuggestion which could guide me in any way in my search for the Lady of\nthe Shroud.  Monuments there were in profusion--statues, tablets, and all\nthe customary memorials of the dead.  The families and dates represented\nwere simply bewildering.  Often the name of Vissarion was given, and the\ninscription which it held I read through carefully, looking to find some\nenlightenment of any kind.  But all in vain: there was nothing to see in\nthe church itself.  So I determined to visit the crypt.  I had no lantern\nor candle with me, so had to go back to the Castle to secure one.\n\nIt was strange, coming in from the sunlight, here overwhelming to one so\nrecently accustomed to northern skies, to note the slender gleam of the\nlantern which I carried, and which I had lit inside the door.  At my\nfirst entry to the church my mind had been so much taken up with the\nstrangeness of the place, together with the intensity of wish for some\nsort of clue, that I had really no opportunity of examining detail.  But\nnow detail became necessary, as I had to find the entrance to the crypt.\nMy puny light could not dissipate the semi-Cimmerian gloom of the vast\nedifice; I had to throw the feeble gleam into one after another of the\ndark corners.\n\nAt last I found, behind the great screen, a narrow stone staircase which\nseemed to wind down into the rock.  It was not in any way secret, but\nbeing in the narrow space behind the great screen, was not visible except\nwhen close to it.  I knew I was now close to my objective, and began to\ndescend.  Accustomed though I have been to all sorts of mysteries and\ndangers, I felt awed and almost overwhelmed by a sense of loneliness and\ndesolation as I descended the ancient winding steps.  These were many in\nnumber, roughly hewn of old in the solid rock on which the church was\nbuilt.\n\nI met a fresh surprise in finding that the door of the crypt was open.\nAfter all, this was different from the church-door being open; for in\nmany places it is a custom to allow all comers at all times to find rest\nand comfort in the sacred place.  But I did expect that at least the\nfinal resting-place of the historic dead would be held safe against\ncasual intrusion.  Even I, on a quest which was very near my heart,\npaused with an almost overwhelming sense of decorum before passing\nthrough that open door.  The crypt was a huge place, strangely lofty for\na vault.  From its formation, however, I soon came to the conclusion that\nit was originally a natural cavern altered to its present purpose by the\nhand of man.  I could hear somewhere near the sound of running water, but\nI could not locate it.  Now and again at irregular intervals there was a\nprolonged booming, which could only come from a wave breaking in a\nconfined place.  The recollection then came to me of the proximity of the\nchurch to the top of the beetling cliff, and of the half-sunk cavern\nentrances which pierced it.\n\nWith the gleam of my lamp to guide me, I went through and round the whole\nplace.  There were many massive tombs, mostly rough-hewn from great slabs\nor blocks of stone.  Some of them were marble, and the cutting of all was\nancient.  So large and heavy were some of them that it was a wonder to me\nhow they could ever have been brought to this place, to which the only\nentrance was seemingly the narrow, tortuous stairway by which I had come.\nAt last I saw near one end of the crypt a great chain hanging.  Turning\nthe light upward, I found that it depended from a ring set over a wide\nopening, evidently made artificially.  It must have been through this\nopening that the great sarcophagi had been lowered.\n\nDirectly underneath the hanging chain, which did not come closer to the\nground than some eight or ten feet, was a huge tomb in the shape of a\nrectangular coffer or sarcophagus.  It was open, save for a huge sheet of\nthick glass which rested above it on two thick balks of dark oak, cut to\nexceeding smoothness, which lay across it, one at either end.  On the far\nside from where I stood each of these was joined to another oak plank,\nalso cut smooth, which sloped gently to the rocky floor.  Should it be\nnecessary to open the tomb, the glass could be made to slide along the\nsupports and descend by the sloping planks.\n\nNaturally curious to know what might be within such a strange receptacle,\nI raised the lantern, depressing its lens so that the light might fall\nwithin.\n\nThen I started back with a cry, the lantern slipping from my nerveless\nhand and falling with a ringing sound on the great sheet of thick glass.\n\nWithin, pillowed on soft cushions, and covered with a mantle woven of\nwhite natural fleece sprigged with tiny sprays of pine wrought in gold,\nlay the body of a woman--none other than my beautiful visitor.  She was\nmarble white, and her long black eyelashes lay on her white cheeks as\nthough she slept.\n\nWithout a word or a sound, save the sounds made by my hurrying feet on\nthe stone flooring, I fled up the steep steps, and through the dim\nexpanse of the church, out into the bright sunlight.  I found that I had\nmechanically raised the fallen lamp, and had taken it with me in my\nflight.\n\nMy feet naturally turned towards home.  It was all instinctive.  The new\nhorror had--for the time, at any rate--drowned my mind in its mystery,\ndeeper than the deepest depths of thought or imagination.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV: UNDER THE FLAGSTAFF\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                            _May_ 1, 1907.\n\nFor some days after the last adventure I was in truth in a half-dazed\ncondition, unable to think sensibly, hardly coherently.  Indeed, it was\nas much as I could do to preserve something of my habitual appearance and\nmanner.  However, my first test happily came soon, and when I was once\nthrough it I reacquired sufficient self-confidence to go through with my\npurpose.  Gradually the original phase of stupefaction passed, and I was\nable to look the situation in the face.  I knew the worst now, at any\nrate; and when the lowest point has been reached things must begin to\nmend.  Still, I was wofully sensitive regarding anything which might\naffect my Lady of the Shroud, or even my opinion of her.  I even began to\ndread Aunt Janet's Second-Sight visions or dreams.  These had a fatal\nhabit of coming so near to fact that they always made for a danger of\ndiscovery.  I had to realize now that the Lady of the Shroud might indeed\nbe a Vampire--one of that horrid race that survives death and carries on\na life-in-death existence eternally and only for evil.  Indeed, I began\nto _expect_ that Aunt Janet would ere long have some prophetic insight to\nthe matter.  She had been so wonderfully correct in her prophetic\nsurmises with regard to both the visits to my room that it was hardly\npossible that she could fail to take cognizance of this last development.\n\nBut my dread was not justified; at any rate, I had no reason to suspect\nthat by any force or exercise of her occult gift she might cause me\nconcern by the discovery of my secret.  Only once did I feel that actual\ndanger in that respect was close to me.  That was when she came early one\nmorning and rapped at my door.  When I called out, \"Who is that?  What is\nit?\" she said in an agitated way:\n\n\"Thank God, laddie, you are all right!  Go to sleep again.\"\n\nLater on, when we met at breakfast, she explained that she had had a\nnightmare in the grey of the morning.  She thought she had seen me in the\ncrypt of a great church close beside a stone coffin; and, knowing that\nsuch was an ominous subject to dream about, came as soon as she dared to\nsee if I was all right.  Her mind was evidently set on death and burial,\nfor she went on:\n\n\"By the way, Rupert, I am told that the great church on time top of the\ncliff across the creek is St. Sava's, where the great people of the\ncountry used to be buried.  I want you to take me there some day.  We\nshall go over it, and look at the tombs and monuments together.  I really\nthink I should be afraid to go alone, but it will be all right if you are\nwith me.\"  This was getting really dangerous, so I turned it aside:\n\n\"Really, Aunt Janet, I'm afraid it won't do.  If you go off to weird old\nchurches, and fill yourself up with a fresh supply of horrors, I don't\nknow what will happen.  You'll be dreaming dreadful things about me every\nnight and neither you nor I shall get any sleep.\"  It went to my heart to\noppose her in any wish; and also this kind of chaffy opposition might\npain her.  But I had no alternative; the matter was too serious to be\nallowed to proceed.  Should Aunt Janet go to the church, she would surely\nwant to visit the crypt.  Should she do so, and there notice the\nglass-covered tomb--as she could not help doing--the Lord only knew what\nwould happen.  She had already Second-Sighted a woman being married to\nme, and before I myself knew that I had such a hope.  What might she not\nreveal did she know where the woman came from?  It may have been that her\npower of Second Sight had to rest on some basis of knowledge or belief,\nand that her vision was but some intuitive perception of my own\nsubjective thought.  But whatever it was it should be stopped--at all\nhazards.\n\nThis whole episode set me thinking introspectively, and led me gradually\nbut imperatively to self-analysis--not of powers, but of motives.  I\nfound myself before long examining myself as to what were my real\nintentions.  I thought at first that this intellectual process was an\nexercise of pure reason; but soon discarded this as inadequate--even\nimpossible.  Reason is a cold manifestation; this feeling which swayed\nand dominated me is none other than passion, which is quick, hot, and\ninsistent.\n\nAs for myself, the self-analysis could lead to but one result--the\nexpression to myself of the reality and definiteness of an already-formed\nthough unconscious intention.  I wished to do the woman good--to serve\nher in some way--to secure her some benefit by any means, no matter how\ndifficult, which might be within my power.  I knew that I loved\nher--loved her most truly and fervently; there was no need for\nself-analysis to tell me that.  And, moreover, no self-analysis, or any\nother mental process that I knew of, could help my one doubt: whether she\nwas an ordinary woman (or an extraordinary woman, for the matter of that)\nin some sore and terrible straits; or else one who lay under some\ndreadful condition, only partially alive, and not mistress of herself or\nher acts.  Whichever her condition might be, there was in my own feeling\na superfluity of affection for her.  The self-analysis taught me one\nthing, at any rate--that I had for her, to start with, an infinite pity\nwhich had softened towards her my whole being, and had already mastered\nmerely selfish desire.  Out of it I began to find excuses for her every\nact.  In the doing so I knew now, though perhaps I did not at the time\nthe process was going on, that my view in its true inwardness was of her\nas a living woman--the woman I loved.\n\nIn the forming of our ideas there are different methods of work, as\nthough the analogy with material life holds good.  In the building of a\nhouse, for instance, there are many persons employed; men of different\ntrades and occupations--architect, builder, masons, carpenters, plumbers,\nand a host of others--and all these with the officials of each guild or\ntrade.  So in the world of thought and feelings: knowledge and\nunderstanding come through various agents, each competent to its task.\n\nHow far pity reacted with love I knew not; I only knew that whatever her\nstate might be, were she living or dead, I could find in my heart no\nblame for the Lady of the Shroud.  It could not be that she was dead in\nthe real conventional way; for, after all, the Dead do not walk the earth\nin corporal substance, even if there be spirits which take the corporal\nform.  This woman was of actual form and weight.  How could I doubt that,\nat all events--I, who had held her in my arms?  Might it not be that she\nwas not quite dead, and that it had been given to me to restore her to\nlife again?  Ah! that would be, indeed, a privilege well worth the giving\nmy life to accomplish.  That such a thing may be is possible.  Surely the\nold myths were not absolute inventions; they must have had a basis\nsomewhere in fact.  May not the world-old story of Orpheus and Eurydice\nhave been based on some deep-lying principle or power of human nature?\nThere is not one of us but has wished at some time to bring back the\ndead.  Ay, and who has not felt that in himself or herself was power in\nthe deep love for our dead to make them quick again, did we but know the\nsecret of how it was to be done?\n\nFor myself, I have seen such mysteries that I am open to conviction\nregarding things not yet explained.  These have been, of course, amongst\nsavages or those old-world people who have brought unchecked traditions\nand beliefs--ay, and powers too--down the ages from the dim days when the\nworld was young; when forces were elemental, and Nature's handiwork was\nexperimental rather than completed.  Some of these wonders may have been\nolder still than the accepted period of our own period of creation.  May\nwe not have to-day other wonders, different only in method, but not more\nsusceptible of belief?  Obi-ism and Fantee-ism have been exercised in my\nown presence, and their results proved by the evidence of my own eyes and\nother senses.  So, too, have stranger rites, with the same object and the\nsame success, in the far Pacific Islands.  So, too, in India and China,\nin Thibet and in the Golden Chersonese.  On all and each of these\noccasions there was, on my own part, enough belief to set in motion the\npowers of understanding; and there were no moral scruples to stand in the\nway of realization.  Those whose lives are so spent that they achieve the\nreputation of not fearing man or God or devil are not deterred in their\ndoing or thwarted from a set purpose by things which might deter others\nnot so equipped for adventure.  Whatever may be before them--pleasant or\npainful, bitter or sweet, arduous or facile, enjoyable or terrible,\nhumorous or full of awe and horror--they must accept, taking them in the\nonward course as a good athlete takes hurdles in his stride.  And there\nmust be no hesitating, no looking back.  If the explorer or the\nadventurer has scruples, he had better give up that special branch of\neffort and come himself to a more level walk in life.  Neither must there\nbe regrets.  There is no need for such; savage life has this advantage:\nit begets a certain toleration not to be found in conventional existence.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                            _May_ 2, 1907.\n\nI had heard long ago that Second Sight is a terrible gift, even to its\npossessor.  I am now inclined not only to believe, but to understand it.\nAunt Janet has made such a practice of it of late that I go in constant\ndread of discovery of my secret.  She seems to parallel me all the time,\nwhatever I may do.  It is like a sort of dual existence to her; for she\nis her dear old self all the time, and yet some other person with a sort\nof intellectual kit of telescope and notebook, which are eternally used\non me.  I know they are _for_ me, too--for what she considers my good.\nBut all the same it makes an embarrassment.  Happily Second Sight cannot\nspeak as clearly as it sees, or, rather, as it understands.  For the\ntranslation of the vague beliefs which it inculcates is both nebulous and\nuncertain--a sort of Delphic oracle which always says things which no one\ncan make out at the time, but which can be afterwards read in any one of\nseveral ways.  This is all right, for in my case it is a kind of safety;\nbut, then, Aunt Janet is a very clever woman, and some time she herself\nmay be able to understand.  Then she may begin to put two and two\ntogether.  When she does that, it will not be long before she knows more\nthan I do of the facts of the whole affair.  And her reading of them and\nof the Lady of the Shroud, round whom they circle, may not be the same as\nmine.  Well, that will be all right too.  Aunt Janet loves me--God knows\nI have good reason to know that all through these years--and whatever\nview she may take, her acts will be all I could wish.  But I shall come\nin for a good lot of scolding, I am sure.  By the way, I ought to think\nof that; if Aunt Janet scolds me, it is a pretty good proof that I ought\nto be scolded.  I wonder if I dare tell her all.  No!  It is too strange.\nShe is only a woman, after all: and if she knew I loved . . . I wish I\nknew her name, and thought--as I might myself do, only that I resist\nit--that she is not alive at all.  Well, what she would either think or\ndo beats me.  I suppose she would want to slipper me as she used to do\nwhen I was a wee kiddie--in a different way, of course.\n\n                                                            _May_ 3, 1907.\n\nI really could not go on seriously last night.  The idea of Aunt Janet\ngiving me a licking as in the dear old days made me laugh so much that\nnothing in the world seemed serious then.  Oh, Aunt Janet is all right\nwhatever comes.  That I am sure of, so I needn't worry over it.  A good\nthing too; there will be plenty to worry about without that.  I shall not\ncheck her telling me of her visions, however; I may learn something from\nthem.\n\nFor the last four-and-twenty hours I have, whilst awake, been looking\nover Aunt Janet's books, of which I brought a wheen down here.  Gee\nwhizz!  No wonder the old dear is superstitious, when she is filled up to\nthe back teeth with that sort of stuff!  There may be some truth in some\nof those yarns; those who wrote them may believe in them, or some of\nthem, at all events.  But as to coherence or logic, or any sort of\nreasonable or instructive deduction, they might as well have been written\nby so many hens!  These occult book-makers seem to gather only a lot of\nbare, bald facts, which they put down in the most uninteresting way\npossible.  They go by quantity only.  One story of the kind, well\nexamined and with logical comments, would be more convincing to a third\nparty than a whole hecatomb of them.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                            _May_ 4, 1907.\n\nThere is evidently something up in the country.  The mountaineers are\nmore uneasy than they have been as yet.  There is constant going to and\nfro amongst them, mostly at night and in the grey of the morning.  I\nspend many hours in my room in the eastern tower, from which I can watch\nthe woods, and gather from signs the passing to and fro.  But with all\nthis activity no one has said to me a word on the subject.  It is\nundoubtedly a disappointment to me.  I had hoped that the mountaineers\nhad come to trust me; that gathering at which they wanted to fire their\nguns for me gave me strong hopes.  But now it is apparent that they do\nnot trust me in full--as yet, at all events.  Well, I must not complain.\nIt is all only right and just.  As yet I have done nothing to prove to\nthem the love and devotion that I feel to the country.  I know that such\nindividuals as I have met trust me, and I believe like me.  But the trust\nof a nation is different.  That has to be won and tested; he who would\nwin it must justify, and in a way that only troublous times can allow.\nNo nation will--can--give full meed of honour to a stranger in times of\npeace.  Why should it?  I must not forget that I am here a stranger in\nthe land, and that to the great mass of people even my name is unknown.\nPerhaps they will know me better when Rooke comes back with that store of\narms and ammunition that he has bought, and the little warship he has got\nfrom South America.  When they see that I hand over the whole lot to the\nnation without a string on them, they may begin to believe.  In the\nmeantime all I can do is to wait.  It will all come right in time, I have\nno doubt.  And if it doesn't come right, well, we can only die once!\n\nIs that so?  What about my Lady of the Shroud?  I must not think of that\nor of her in this gallery.  Love and war are separate, and may not\nmix--cannot mix, if it comes to that.  I must be wise in the matter; and\nif I have got the hump in any degree whatever, must not show it.\n\nBut one thing is certain: something is up, and it must be the Turks.\nFrom what the Vladika said at that meeting they have some intention of an\nattack on the Blue Mountains.  If that be so, we must be ready; and\nperhaps I can help there.  The forces must be organized; we must have\nsome method of communication.  In this country, where are neither roads\nnor railways nor telegraphs, we must establish a signalling system of\nsome sort.  _That_ I can begin at once.  I can make a code, or adapt one\nthat I have used elsewhere already.  I shall rig up a semaphore on the\ntop of the Castle which can be seen for an enormous distance around.  I\nshall train a number of men to be facile in signalling.  And then, should\nneed come, I may be able to show the mountaineers that I am fit to live\nin their hearts . . .\n\nAnd all this work may prove an anodyne to pain of another kind.  It will\nhelp, at any rate, to keep my mind occupied whilst I am waiting for\nanother visit from my Lady of the Shroud.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _May_ 18, 1907.\n\nThe two weeks that have passed have been busy, and may, as time goes on,\nprove eventful.  I really think they have placed me in a different\nposition with the Blue Mountaineers--certainly so far as those in this\npart of the country are concerned.  They are no longer suspicious of\nme--which is much; though they have not yet received me into their\nconfidence.  I suppose this will come in time, but I must not try to\nhustle them.  Already they are willing, so far as I can see, to use me to\ntheir own ends.  They accepted the signalling idea very readily, and are\nquite willing to drill as much as I like.  This can be (and I think is,\nin its way) a pleasure to them.  They are born soldiers, every man of\nthem; and practice together is only a realization of their own wishes and\na further development of their powers.  I think I can understand the\ntrend of their thoughts, and what ideas of public policy lie behind them.\nIn all that we have attempted together as yet they are themselves in\nabsolute power.  It rests with them to carry out any ideas I may suggest,\nso they do not fear any assumption of power or governance on my part.\nThus, so long as they keep secret from me both their ideas of high policy\nand their immediate intentions, I am powerless to do them ill, and I\n_may_ be of service should occasion arise.  Well, all told, this is much.\nAlready they accept me as an individual, not merely one of the mass.  I\nam pretty sure that they are satisfied of my personal _bona fides_.  It\nis policy and not mistrust that hedges me in.  Well, policy is a matter\nof time.  They are a splendid people, but if they knew a little more than\nthey do they would understand that the wisest of all policies is\ntrust--when it can be given.  I must hold myself in check, and never be\nbetrayed into a harsh thought towards them.  Poor souls! with a thousand\nyears behind them of Turkish aggression, strenuously attempted by both\nforce and fraud, no wonder they are suspicious.  Likewise every other\nnation with whom they have ever come in contact--except one, my own--has\ndeceived or betrayed them.  Anyhow, they are fine soldiers, and before\nlong we shall have an army that cannot be ignored.  If I can get so that\nthey trust me, I shall ask Sir Colin to come out here.  He would be a\nsplendid head for their army.  His great military knowledge and tactical\nskill would come in well.  It makes me glow to think of what an army he\nwould turn out of this splendid material, and one especially adapted for\nthe style of fighting which would be necessary in this country.\n\nIf a mere amateur like myself, who has only had experience of organizing\nthe wildest kind of savages, has been able to advance or compact their\nindividual style of fighting into systematic effort, a great soldier like\nMacKelpie will bring them to perfection as a fighting machine.  Our\nHighlanders, when they come out, will foregather with them, as\nmountaineers always do with each other.  Then we shall have a force which\ncan hold its own against any odds.  I only hope that Rooke will be\nreturning soon.  I want to see those Ingis-Malbron rifles either safely\nstored in the Castle or, what is better, divided up amongst the\nmountaineers--a thing which will be done at the very earliest moment that\nI can accomplish it.  I have a conviction that when these men have\nreceived their arms and ammunition from me they will understand me\nbetter, and not keep any secrets from me.\n\nAll this fortnight when I was not drilling or going about amongst the\nmountaineers, and teaching them the code which I have now got perfected,\nI was exploring the side of the mountain nearest to here.  I could not\nbear to be still.  It is torture to me to be idle in my present condition\nof mind regarding my Lady of the Shroud . . . Strange I do not mind\nmentioning the word to myself now.  I used to at first; but that\nbitterness has all gone away.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--Continued.\n\n\n                                                           _May_ 19, 1907.\n\nI was so restless early this morning that before daylight I was out\nexploring on the mountain-side.  By chance I came across a secret place\njust as the day was breaking.  Indeed, it was by the change of light as\nthe first sun-rays seemed to fall down the mountain-side that my\nattention was called to an opening shown by a light behind it.  It was,\nindeed, a secret place--so secret that I thought at first I should keep\nit to myself.  In such a place as this either to hide in or to be able to\nprevent anyone else hiding in might on occasion be an asset of safety.\n\nWhen, however, I saw indications rather than traces that someone had\nalready used it to camp in, I changed my mind, and thought that whenever\nI should get an opportunity I would tell the Vladika of it, as he is a\nman on whose discretion I can rely.  If we ever have a war here or any\nsort of invasion, it is just such places that may be dangerous.  Even in\nmy own case it is much too near the Castle to be neglected.\n\nThe indications were meagre--only where a fire had been on a little shelf\nof rock; and it was not possible, through the results of burning\nvegetation or scorched grass, to tell how long before the fire had been\nalight.  I could only guess.  Perhaps the mountaineers might be able to\ntell or even to guess better than I could.  But I am not so sure of this.\nI am a mountaineer myself, and with larger and more varied experience\nthan any of them.  For myself, though I could not be certain, I came to\nthe conclusion that whoever had used the place had done so not many days\nbefore.  It could not have been quite recently; but it may not have been\nvery long ago.  Whoever had used it had covered up his tracks well.  Even\nthe ashes had been carefully removed, and the place where they had lain\nwas cleaned or swept in some way, so that there was no trace on the spot.\nI applied some of my West African experience, and looked on the rough\nbark of the trees to leeward, to where the agitated air, however\ndirected, must have come, unless it was wanted to call attention to the\nplace by the scattered wood-ashes, however fine.  I found traces of it,\nbut they were faint.  There had not been rain for several days; so the\ndust must have been blown there since the rain had fallen, for it was\nstill dry.\n\nThe place was a tiny gorge, with but one entrance, which was hidden\nbehind a barren spur of rock--just a sort of long fissure, jagged and\ncurving, in the rock, like a fault in the stratification.  I could just\nstruggle through it with considerable effort, holding my breath here and\nthere, so as to reduce my depth of chest.  Within it was tree-clad, and\nfull of possibilities of concealment.\n\nAs I came away I marked well its direction and approaches, noting any\nguiding mark which might aid in finding it by day or night.  I explored\nevery foot of ground around it--in front, on each side, and above.  But\nfrom nowhere could I see an indication of its existence.  It was a\nveritable secret chamber wrought by the hand of Nature itself.  I did not\nreturn home till I was familiar with every detail near and around it.\nThis new knowledge added distinctly to my sense of security.\n\nLater in the day I tried to find the Vladika or any mountaineer of\nimportance, for I thought that such a hiding-place which had been used so\nrecently might be dangerous, and especially at a time when, as I had\nlearned at the meeting where they did _not_ fire their guns that there\nmay have been spies about or a traitor in the land.\n\nEven before I came to my own room to-night I had fully made up my mind to\ngo out early in the morning and find some proper person to whom to impart\nthe information, so that a watch might be kept on the place.  It is now\ngetting on for midnight, and when I have had my usual last look at the\ngarden I shall turn in.  Aunt Janet was uneasy all day, and especially so\nthis evening.  I think it must have been my absence at the usual\nbreakfast-hour which got on her nerves; and that unsatisfied mental or\npsychical irritation increased as the day wore on.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _May_ 20, 1907.\n\nThe clock on the mantelpiece in my room, which chimes on the notes of the\nclock at St. James's Palace, was striking midnight when I opened the\nglass door on the terrace.  I had put out my lights before I drew the\ncurtain, as I wished to see the full effect of the moonlight.  Now that\nthe rainy season is over, the moon is quite as beautiful as it was in the\nwet, and a great deal more comfortable.  I was in evening dress, with a\nsmoking-jacket in lieu of a coat, and I felt the air mild and mellow on\nthe warm side, as I stood on the terrace.\n\nBut even in that bright moonlight the further corners of the great garden\nwere full of mysterious shadows.  I peered into them as well as I\ncould--and my eyes are pretty good naturally, and are well trained.\nThere was not the least movement.  The air was as still as death, the\nfoliage as still as though wrought in stone.\n\nI looked for quite a long time in the hope of seeing something of my\nLady.  The quarters chimed several times, but I stood on unheeding.  At\nlast I thought I saw far off in the very corner of the old defending wall\na flicker of white.  It was but momentary, and could hardly have\naccounted in itself for the way my heart beat.  I controlled myself, and\nstood as though I, too, were a graven image.  I was rewarded by seeing\npresently another gleam of white.  And then an unspeakable rapture stole\nover me as I realized that my Lady was coming as she had come before.  I\nwould have hurried out to meet her, but that I knew well that this would\nnot be in accord with her wishes.  So, thinking to please her, I drew\nback into the room.  I was glad I had done so when, from the dark corner\nwhere I stood, I saw her steal up the marble steps and stand timidly\nlooking in at the door.  Then, after a long pause, came a whisper as\nfaint and sweet as the music of a distant AEolian harp:\n\n\"Are you there?  May I come in?  Answer me!  I am lonely and in fear!\"\nFor answer I emerged from my dim corner so swiftly that she was startled.\nI could hear from the quivering intake of her breath that she was\nstriving--happily with success--to suppress a shriek.\n\n\"Come in,\" I said quietly.  \"I was waiting for you, for I felt that you\nwould come.  I only came in from the terrace when I saw you coming, lest\nyou might fear that anyone might see us.  That is not possible, but I\nthought you wished that I should be careful.\"\n\n\"I did--I do,\" she answered in a low, sweet voice, but very firmly.  \"But\nnever avoid precaution.  There is nothing that may not happen here.\nThere may be eyes where we least expect--or suspect them.\"  As she spoke\nthe last words solemnly and in a low whisper, she was entering the room.\nI closed the glass door and bolted it, rolled back the steel grille, and\npulled the heavy curtain.  Then, when I had lit a candle, I went over and\nput a light to the fire.  In a few seconds the dry wood had caught, and\nthe flames were beginning to rise and crackle.  She had not objected to\nmy closing the window and drawing the curtain; neither did she make any\ncomment on my lighting the fire.  She simply acquiesced in it, as though\nit was now a matter of course.  When I made the pile of cushions before\nit as on the occasion of her last visit, she sank down on them, and held\nout her white, trembling hands to the warmth.\n\nShe was different to-night from what she had been on either of the two\nformer visits.  From her present bearing I arrived at some gauge of her\nself-concern, her self-respect.  Now that she was dry, and not\novermastered by wet and cold, a sweet and gracious dignity seemed to\nshine from her, enwrapping her, as it were, with a luminous veil.  It was\nnot that she was by this made or shown as cold or distant, or in any way\nharsh or forbidding.  On the contrary, protected by this dignity, she\nseemed much more sweet and genial than before.  It was as though she felt\nthat she could afford to stoop now that her loftiness was realized--that\nher position was recognized and secure.  If her inherent dignity made an\nimpenetrable nimbus round her, this was against others; she herself was\nnot bound by it, or to be bound.  So marked was this, so entirely and\nsweetly womanly did she appear, that I caught myself wondering in flashes\nof thought, which came as sharp periods of doubting judgment between\nspells of unconscious fascination, how I had ever come to think she was\naught but perfect woman.  As she rested, half sitting and half lying on\nthe pile of cushions, she was all grace, and beauty, and charm, and\nsweetness--the veritable perfect woman of the dreams of a man, be he\nyoung or old.  To have such a woman sit by his hearth and hold her holy\nof holies in his heart might well be a rapture to any man.  Even an hour\nof such entrancing joy might be well won by a lifetime of pain, by the\nbalance of a long life sacrificed, by the extinction of life itself.\nQuick behind the record of such thoughts came the answer to the doubt\nthey challenged: if it should turn out that she was not living at all,\nbut one of the doomed and pitiful Un-Dead, then so much more on account\nof her very sweetness and beauty would be the winning of her back to Life\nand Heaven--even were it that she might find happiness in the heart and\nin the arms of another man.\n\nOnce, when I leaned over the hearth to put fresh logs on the fire, my\nface was so close to hers that I felt her breath on my cheek.  It\nthrilled me to feel even the suggestion of that ineffable contact.  Her\nbreath was sweet--sweet as the breath of a calf, sweet as the whiff of a\nsummer breeze across beds of mignonette.  How could anyone believe for a\nmoment that such sweet breath could come from the lips of the dead--the\ndead _in esse_ or _in posse_--that corruption could send forth fragrance\nso sweet and pure?  It was with satisfied happiness that, as I looked at\nher from my stool, I saw the dancing of the flames from the beech-logs\nreflected in her glorious black eyes, and the stars that were hidden in\nthem shine out with new colours and new lustre as they gleamed, rising\nand falling like hopes and fears.  As the light leaped, so did smiles of\nquiet happiness flit over her beautiful face, the merriment of the joyous\nflames being reflected in ever-changing dimples.\n\nAt first I was a little disconcerted whenever my eyes took note of her\nshroud, and there came a momentary regret that the weather had not been\nagain bad, so that there might have been compulsion for her putting on\nanother garment--anything lacking the loathsomeness of that pitiful\nwrapping.  Little by little, however, this feeling disappeared, and I\nfound no matter for even dissatisfaction in her wrapping.  Indeed, my\nthoughts found inward voice before the subject was dismissed from my\nmind:\n\n\"One becomes accustomed to anything--even a shroud!\"  But the thought was\nfollowed by a submerging wave of pity that she should have had such a\ndreadful experience.\n\nBy-and-by we seemed both to forget everything--I know I did--except that\nwe were man and woman, and close together.  The strangeness of the\nsituation and the circumstances did not seem of moment--not worth even a\npassing thought.  We still sat apart and said little, if anything.  I\ncannot recall a single word that either of us spoke whilst we sat before\nthe fire, but other language than speech came into play; the eyes told\ntheir own story, as eyes can do, and more eloquently than lips whilst\nexercising their function of speech.  Question and answer followed each\nother in this satisfying language, and with an unspeakable rapture I\nbegan to realize that my affection was returned.  Under these\ncircumstances it was unrealizable that there should be any incongruity in\nthe whole affair.  I was not myself in the mood of questioning.  I was\ndiffident with that diffidence which comes alone from true love, as\nthough it were a necessary emanation from that delightful and\noverwhelming and commanding passion.  In her presence there seemed to\nsurge up within me that which forbade speech.  Speech under present\nconditions would have seemed to me unnecessary, imperfect, and even\nvulgarly overt.  She, too, was silent.  But now that I am alone, and\nmemory is alone with me, I am convinced that she also had been happy.\nNo, not that exactly.  \"Happiness\" is not the word to describe either her\nfeeling or my own.  Happiness is more active, a more conscious enjoyment.\nWe had been content.  That expresses our condition perfectly; and now\nthat I can analyze my own feeling, and understand what the word implies,\nI am satisfied of its accuracy.  \"Content\" has both a positive and\nnegative meaning or antecedent condition.  It implies an absence of\ndisturbing conditions as well as of wants; also it implies something\npositive which has been won or achieved, or which has accrued.  In our\nstate of mind--for though it may be presumption on my part, I am\nsatisfied that our ideas were mutual--it meant that we had reached an\nunderstanding whence all that might come must be for good.  God grant\nthat it may be so!\n\nAs we sat silent, looking into each other's eyes, and whilst the stars in\nhers were now full of latent fire, perhaps from the reflection of the\nflames, she suddenly sprang to her feet, instinctively drawing the\nhorrible shroud round her as she rose to her full height in a voice full\nof lingering emotion, as of one who is acting under spiritual compulsion\nrather than personal will, she said in a whisper:\n\n\"I must go at once.  I feel the morning drawing nigh.  I must be in my\nplace when the light of day comes.\"\n\nShe was so earnest that I felt I must not oppose her wish; so I, too,\nsprang to my feet and ran towards the window.  I pulled the curtain aside\nsufficiently far for me to press back the grille and reach the glass\ndoor, the latch of which I opened.  I passed behind the curtain again,\nand held the edge of it back so that she could go through.  For an\ninstant she stopped as she broke the long silence:\n\n\"You are a true gentleman, and my friend.  You understand all I wish.\nOut of the depth of my heart I thank you.\"  She held out her beautiful\nhigh-bred hand.  I took it in both mine as I fell on my knees, and raised\nit to my lips.  Its touch made me quiver.  She, too, trembled as she\nlooked down at me with a glance which seemed to search my very soul.  The\nstars in her eyes, now that the firelight was no longer on them, had gone\nback to their own mysterious silver.  Then she drew her hand from mine\nvery, very gently, as though it would fain linger; and she passed out\nbehind the curtain with a gentle, sweet, dignified little bow which left\nme on my knees.\n\nWhen I heard the glass door pulled-to gently behind her, I rose from my\nknees and hurried without the curtain, just in time to watch her pass\ndown the steps.  I wanted to see her as long as I could.  The grey of\nmorning was just beginning to war with the night gloom, and by the faint\nuncertain light I could see dimly the white figure flit between shrub and\nstatue till finally it merged in the far darkness.\n\nI stood for a long time on the terrace, sometimes looking into the\ndarkness in front of me, in case I might be blessed with another glimpse\nof her; sometimes with my eyes closed, so that I might recall and hold in\nmy mind her passage down the steps.  For the first time since I had met\nher she had thrown back at me a glance as she stepped on the white path\nbelow the terrace.  With the glamour over me of that look, which was all\nlove and enticement, I could have dared all the powers that be.\n\nWhen the grey dawn was becoming apparent through the lightening of the\nsky I returned to my room.  In a dazed condition--half hypnotized by\nlove--I went to bed, and in dreams continued to think, all happily, of my\nLady of the Shroud.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _May_ 27, 1907.\n\nA whole week has gone since I saw my Love!  There it is; no doubt\nwhatever is left in my mind about it now!  Since I saw her my passion has\ngrown and grown by leaps and bounds, as novelists put it.  It has now\nbecome so vast as to overwhelm me, to wipe out all thought of doubt or\ndifficulty.  I suppose it must be what men suffered--suffering need not\nmean pain--under enchantments in old times.  I am but as a straw whirled\nin the resistless eddies of a whirlpool.  I feel that I _must_ see her\nagain, even if it be but in her tomb in the crypt.  I must, I suppose,\nprepare myself for the venture, for many things have to be thought of.\nThe visit must not be at night, for in such case I might miss her, did\nshe come to me again here . . .\n\nThe morning came and went, but my wish and intention still remained; and\nso in the full tide of noon, with the sun in all its fiery force, I set\nout for the old church of St. Sava.  I carried with me a lantern with\npowerful lens.  I had wrapped it up secretly, for I had a feeling that I\nshould not like anyone to know that I had such a thing with me.\n\nOn this occasion I had no misgivings.  On the former visit I had for a\nmoment been overwhelmed at the unexpected sight of the body of the woman\nI thought I loved--I knew it now--lying in her tomb.  But now I knew all,\nand it was to see this woman, though in her tomb, that I came.\n\nWhen I had lit my lantern, which I did as soon as I had pushed open the\ngreat door, which was once again unlocked, I turned my steps to the steps\nof the crypt, which lay behind the richly carven wood screen.  This I\ncould see, with the better light, was a noble piece of work of priceless\nbeauty and worth.  I tried to keep my heart in full courage with thoughts\nof my Lady, and of the sweetness and dignity of our last meeting; but,\ndespite all, it sank down, down, and turned to water as I passed with\nuncertain feet down the narrow, tortuous steps.  My concern, I am now\nconvinced, was not for myself, but that she whom I adored should have to\nendure such a fearful place.  As anodyne to my own pain I thought what it\nwould be, and how I should feel, when I should have won for her a way out\nof that horror, at any rate.  This thought reassured me somewhat, and\nrestored my courage.  It was in something of the same fashion which has\nhitherto carried me out of tight places as well as into them that at last\nI pushed open the low, narrow door at the foot of the rock-hewn staircase\nand entered the crypt.\n\nWithout delay I made my way to the glass-covered tomb set beneath the\nhanging chain.  I could see by the flashing of the light around me that\nmy hand which held the lantern trembled.  With a great effort I steadied\nmyself, and raising the lantern, turned its light down into the\nsarcophagus.\n\nOnce again the fallen lantern rang on the tingling glass, and I stood\nalone in the darkness, for an instant almost paralyzed with surprised\ndisappointment.\n\nThe tomb was empty!  Even the trappings of the dead had been removed.\n\nI knew not what happened till I found myself groping my way up the\nwinding stair.  Here, in comparison with the solid darkness of the crypt,\nit seemed almost light.  The dim expanse of the church sent a few\nstraggling rays down the vaulted steps, and as I could see, be it never\nso dimly, I felt I was not in absolute darkness.  With the light came a\nsense of power and fresh courage, and I groped my way back into the crypt\nagain.  There, by now and again lighting matches, I found my way to the\ntomb and recovered my lantern.  Then I took my way slowly--for I wished\nto prove, if not my own courage, at least such vestiges of self-respect\nas the venture had left me--through the church, where I extinguished my\nlantern, and out through the great door into the open sunlight.  I seemed\nto have heard, both in the darkness of the crypt and through the dimness\nof the church, mysterious sounds as of whispers and suppressed breathing;\nbut the memory of these did not count for much when once I was free.  I\nwas only satisfied of my own consciousness and identity when I found\nmyself on the broad rock terrace in front of the church, with the fierce\nsunlight beating on my upturned face, and, looking downward, saw far\nbelow me the rippled blue of the open sea.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _June_ 3, 1907.\n\nAnother week has elapsed--a week full of movement of many kinds and in\nmany ways--but as yet I have had no tale or tidings of my Lady of the\nShroud.  I have not had an opportunity of going again in daylight to St.\nSava's as I should have liked to have done.  I felt that I must not go at\nnight.  The night is her time of freedom, and it must be kept for her--or\nelse I may miss her, or perhaps never see her again.\n\nThe days have been full of national movement.  The mountaineers have\nevidently been organizing themselves, for some reason which I cannot\nquite understand, and which they have hesitated to make known to me.  I\nhave taken care not to manifest any curiosity, whatever I may have felt.\nThis would certainly arouse suspicion, and might ultimately cause\ndisaster to my hopes of aiding the nation in their struggle to preserve\ntheir freedom.\n\nThese fierce mountaineers are strangely--almost unduly--suspicious, and\nthe only way to win their confidence is to begin the trusting.  A young\nAmerican attache of the Embassy at Vienna, who had made a journey through\nthe Land of the Blue Mountains, once put it to me in this form:\n\n\"Keep your head shut, and they'll open theirs.  If you don't, they'll\nopen it for you--down to the chine!\"\n\nIt was quite apparent to me that they were completing some fresh\narrangements for signalling with a code of their own.  This was natural\nenough, and in no way inconsistent with the measure of friendliness\nalready shown to me.  Where there are neither telegraphs, railways, nor\nroads, any effective form of communication must--can only be purely\npersonal.  And so, if they wish to keep any secret amongst themselves,\nthey must preserve the secret of their code.  I should have dearly liked\nto learn their new code and their manner of using it, but as I want to be\na helpful friend to them--and as this implies not only trust, but the\nappearance of it--I had to school myself to patience.\n\nThis attitude so far won their confidence that before we parted at our\nlast meeting, after most solemn vows of faith and secrecy, they took me\ninto the secret.  This was, however, only to the extent of teaching me\nthe code and method; they still withheld from me rigidly the fact or\npolitical secret, or whatever it was that was the mainspring of their\nunited action.\n\nWhen I got home I wrote down, whilst it was fresh in my memory, all they\ntold me.  This script I studied until I had it so thoroughly by heart\nthat I _could_ not forget it.  Then I burned the paper.  However, there\nis now one gain at least: with my semaphore I can send through the Blue\nMountains from side to side, with expedition, secrecy, and exactness, a\nmessage comprehensible to all.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _June_ 6, 1907.\n\nLast night I had a new experience of my Lady of the Shroud--in so far as\nform was concerned, at any rate.  I was in bed, and just falling asleep,\nwhen I heard a queer kind of scratching at the glass door of the terrace.\nI listened acutely, my heart beating hard.  The sound seemed to come from\nlow down, close to the floor.  I jumped out of bed, ran to the window,\nand, pulling aside the heavy curtains, looked out.\n\nThe garden looked, as usual, ghostly in the moonlight, but there was not\nthe faintest sign of movement anywhere, and no one was on or near the\nterrace.  I looked eagerly down to where the sound had seemed to come\nfrom.\n\nThere, just inside the glass door, as though it had been pushed under the\ndoor, lay a paper closely folded in several laps.  I picked it up and\nopened it.  I was all in a tumult, for my heart told me whence it came.\nInside was written in English, in a large, sprawling hand, such as might\nbe from an English child of seven or eight:\n\n\"Meet me at the Flagstaff on the Rock!\"\n\nI knew the place, of course.  On the farthermost point of the rock on\nwhich the Castle stands is set a high flagstaff, whereon in old time the\nbanner of the Vissarion family flew.  At some far-off time, when the\nCastle had been liable to attack, this point had been strongly fortified.\nIndeed, in the days when the bow was a martial weapon it must have been\nquite impregnable.\n\nA covered gallery, with loopholes for arrows, had been cut in the solid\nrock, running right round the point, quite surrounding the flagstaff and\nthe great boss of rock on whose centre it was reared.  A narrow\ndrawbridge of immense strength had connected--in peaceful times, and\nstill remained--the outer point of rock with an entrance formed in the\nouter wall, and guarded with flanking towers and a portcullis.  Its use\nwas manifestly to guard against surprise.  From this point only could be\nseen the line of the rocks all round the point.  Thus, any secret attack\nby boats could be made impossible.\n\nHaving hurriedly dressed myself, and taking with me both hunting-knife\nand revolver, I went out on the terrace, taking the precaution, unusual\nto me, of drawing the grille behind me and locking it.  Matters around\nthe Castle are in far too disturbed a condition to allow the taking of\nany foolish chances, either in the way of being unarmed or of leaving the\nprivate entrance to the Castle open.  I found my way through the rocky\npassage, and climbed by the Jacob's ladder fixed on the rock--a device of\nconvenience in time of peace--to the foot of the flagstaff.\n\nI was all on fire with expectation, and the time of going seemed\nexceeding long; so I was additionally disappointed by the contrast when I\ndid not see my Lady there when I arrived.  However, my heart beat freely\nagain--perhaps more freely than ever--when I saw her crouching in the\nshadow of the Castle wall.  From where she was she could not be seen from\nany point save that alone which I occupied; even from there it was only\nher white shroud that was conspicuous through the deep gloom of the\nshadow.  The moonlight was so bright that the shadows were almost\nunnaturally black.\n\nI rushed over towards her, and when close was about to say impulsively,\n\"Why did you leave your tomb?\" when it suddenly struck me that the\nquestion would be malapropos and embarrassing in many ways.  So, better\njudgment prevailing, I said instead:\n\n\"It has been so long since I saw you!  It has seemed an eternity to me!\"\nHer answer came as quickly as even I could have wished; she spoke\nimpulsively and without thought:\n\n\"It has been long to me too!  Oh, so long! so long!  I have asked you to\ncome out here because I wanted to see you so much that I could not wait\nany longer.  I have been heart-hungry for a sight of you!\"\n\nHer words, her eager attitude, the ineffable something which conveys the\nmessages of the heart, the longing expression in her eyes as the full\nmoonlight fell on her face, showing the stars as living gold--for in her\neagerness she had stepped out towards me from the shadow--all set me on\nfire.  Without a thought or a word--for it was Nature speaking in the\nlanguage of Love, which is a silent tongue--I stepped towards her and\ntook her in my arms.  She yielded with that sweet unconsciousness which\nis the perfection of Love, as if it was in obedience to some command\nuttered before the beginning of the world.  Probably without any\nconscious effort on either side--I know there was none on mine--our\nmouths met in the first kiss of love.\n\nAt the time nothing in the meeting struck me as out of the common.  But\nlater in the night, when I was alone and in darkness, whenever I thought\nof it all--its strangeness and its stranger rapture--I could not but be\nsensible of the bizarre conditions for a love meeting.  The place lonely,\nthe time night, the man young and strong, and full of life and hope and\nambition; the woman, beautiful and ardent though she was, a woman\nseemingly dead, clothed in the shroud in which she had been wrapped when\nlying in her tomb in the crypt of the old church.\n\nWhilst we were together, anyhow, there was little thought of the kind; no\nreasoning of any kind on my part.  Love has its own laws and its own\nlogic.  Under the flagstaff, where the Vissarion banner was wont to flap\nin the breeze, she was in my arms; her sweet breath was on my face; her\nheart was beating against my own.  What need was there for reason at all?\n_Inter arma silent leges_--the voice of reason is silent in the stress of\npassion.  Dead she may be, or Un-dead--a Vampire with one foot in Hell\nand one on earth.  But I love her; and come what may, here or hereafter,\nshe is mine.  As my mate, we shall fare along together, whatsoever the\nend may be, or wheresoever our path may lead.  If she is indeed to be won\nfrom the nethermost Hell, then be mine the task!\n\nBut to go back to the record.  When I had once started speaking to her in\nwords of passion I could not stop.  I did not want to--if I could; and\nshe did not appear to wish it either.  Can there be a woman--alive or\ndead--who would not want to hear the rapture of her lover expressed to\nher whilst she is enclosed in his arms?\n\nThere was no attempt at reticence on my part now; I took it for granted\nthat she knew all that I surmised, and, as she made neither protest nor\ncomment, that she accepted my belief as to her indeterminate existence.\nSometimes her eyes would be closed, but even then the rapture of her face\nwas almost beyond belief.  Then, when the beautiful eyes would open and\ngaze on me, the stars that were in them would shine and scintillate as\nthough they were formed of living fire.  She said little, very little;\nbut though the words were few, every syllable was fraught with love, and\nwent straight to the very core of my heart.\n\nBy-and-by, when our transport had calmed to joy, I asked when I might\nnext see her, and how and where I might find her when I should want to.\nShe did not reply directly, but, holding me close in her arms, whispered\nin my ear with that breathless softness which is a lover's rapture of\nspeech:\n\n\"I have come here under terrible difficulties, not only because I love\nyou--and that would be enough--but because, as well as the joy of seeing\nyou, I wanted to warn you.\"\n\n\"To warn me!  Why?\" I queried.  Her reply came with a bashful hesitation,\nwith something of a struggle in it, as of one who for some ulterior\nreason had to pick her words:\n\n\"There are difficulties and dangers ahead of you.  You are beset with\nthem; and they are all the greater because they are, of grim necessity,\nhidden from you.  You cannot go anywhere, look in any direction, do\nanything, say anything, but it may be a signal for danger.  My dear, it\nlurks everywhere--in the light as well as in the darkness; in the open as\nwell as in the secret places; from friends as well as foes; when you are\nleast prepared; when you may least expect it.  Oh, I know it, and what it\nis to endure; for I share it for you--for your dear sake!\"\n\n\"My darling!\" was all I could say, as I drew her again closer to me and\nkissed her.  After a bit she was calmer; seeing this, I came back to the\nsubject that she had--in part, at all events--come to me to speak about:\n\n\"But if difficulty and danger hedge me in so everlastingly, and if I am\nto have no indication whatever of its kind or purpose, what can I do?\nGod knows I would willingly guard myself--not on my own account, but for\nyour dear sake.  I have now a cause to live and be strong, and to keep\nall my faculties, since it may mean much to you.  If you may not tell me\ndetails, may you not indicate to me some line of conduct, of action, that\nwould be most in accord with your wishes--or, rather, with your idea of\nwhat would be best?\"\n\nShe looked at me fixedly before speaking--a long, purposeful, loving look\nwhich no man born of woman could misunderstand.  Then she spoke slowly,\ndeliberately, emphatically:\n\n\"Be bold, and fear not.  Be true to yourself, to me--it is the same\nthing.  These are the best guards you can use.  Your safety does not rest\nwith me.  Ah, I wish it did!  I wish to God it did!\"  In my inner heart\nit thrilled me not merely to hear the expression of her wish, but to hear\nher use the name of God as she did.  I understand now, in the calm of\nthis place and with the sunlight before me, that my belief as to her\nbeing all woman--living woman--was not quite dead: but though at the\nmoment my heart did not recognize the doubt, my brain did.  And I made up\nmy mind that we should not part this time until she knew that I had seen\nher, and where; but, despite my own thoughts, my outer ears listened\ngreedily as she went on.\n\n\"As for me, you may not find _me_, but _I_ shall find _you_, be sure!\nAnd now we must say 'Good-night,' my dear, my dear!  Tell me once again\nthat you love me, for it is a sweetness that one does not wish to\nforego--even one who wears such a garment as this--and rests where I must\nrest.\"  As she spoke she held up part of her cerements for me to see.\nWhat could I do but take her once again in my arms and hold her close,\nclose.  God knows it was all in love; but it was passionate love which\nsurged through my every vein as I strained her dear body to mine.  But\nyet this embrace was not selfish; it was not all an expression of my own\npassion.  It was based on pity--the pity which is twin-born with true\nlove.  Breathless from our kisses, when presently we released each other,\nshe stood in a glorious rapture, like a white spirit in the moonlight,\nand as her lovely, starlit eyes seemed to devour me, she spoke in a\nlanguorous ecstasy:\n\n\"Oh, how you love me! how you love me!  It is worth all I have gone\nthrough for this, even to wearing this terrible drapery.\"  And again she\npointed to her shroud.\n\nHere was my chance to speak of what I knew, and I took it.  \"I know, I\nknow.  Moreover, I know that awful resting-place.\"\n\nI was interrupted, cut short in the midst of my sentence, not by any\nword, but by the frightened look in her eyes and the fear-mastered way in\nwhich she shrank away from me.  I suppose in reality she could not be\npaler than she looked when the colour-absorbing moonlight fell on her;\nbut on the instant all semblance of living seemed to shrink and fall\naway, and she looked with eyes of dread as if in I some awful way held in\nthrall.  But for the movement of the pitiful glance, she would have\nseemed of soulless marble, so deadly cold did she look.\n\nThe moments that dragged themselves out whilst I waited for her to speak\nseemed endless.  At length her words came in an awed whisper, so faint\nthat even in that stilly night I could hardly hear it:\n\n\"You know--you know my resting-place!  How--when was that?\"  There was\nnothing to do now but to speak out the truth:\n\n\"I was in the crypt of St. Sava.  It was all by accident.  I was\nexploring all around the Castle, and I went there in my course.  I found\nthe winding stair in the rock behind the screen, and went down.  Dear, I\nloved you well before that awful moment, but then, even as the lantern\nfell tingling on the glass, my love multiplied itself, with pity as a\nfactor.\"  She was silent for a few seconds.  When she spoke, there was a\nnew tone in her voice:\n\n\"But were you not shocked?\"\n\n\"Of course I was,\" I answered on the spur of the moment, and I now think\nwisely.  \"Shocked is hardly the word.  I was horrified beyond anything\nthat words can convey that you--_you_ should have to so endure!  I did\nnot like to return, for I feared lest my doing so might set some barrier\nbetween us.  But in due time I did return on another day.\"\n\n\"Well?\"  Her voice was like sweet music.\n\n\"I had another shock that time, worse than before, for you were not\nthere.  Then indeed it was that I knew to myself how dear you were--how\ndear you are to me.  Whilst I live, you--living or dead--shall always be\nin my heart.\"  She breathed hard.  The elation in her eyes made them\noutshine the moonlight, but she said no word.  I went on:\n\n\"My dear, I had come into the crypt full of courage and hope, though I\nknew what dreadful sight should sear my eyes once again.  But we little\nknow what may be in store for us, no matter what we expect.  I went out\nwith a heart like water from that dreadful desolation.\"\n\n\"Oh, how you love me, dear!\"  Cheered by her words, and even more by her\ntone, I went on with renewed courage.  There was no halting, no faltering\nin my intention now:\n\n\"You and I, my dear, were ordained for each other.  I cannot help it that\nyou had already suffered before I knew you.  It may be that there may be\nfor you still suffering that I may not prevent, endurance that I may not\nshorten; but what a man can do is yours.  Not Hell itself will stop me,\nif it be possible that I may win through its torments with you in my\narms!\"\n\n\"Will nothing stop you, then?\"  Her question was breathed as softly as\nthe strain of an AEolian harp.\n\n\"Nothing!\" I said, and I heard my own teeth snap together.  There was\nsomething speaking within me stronger than I had ever known myself to be.\nAgain came a query, trembling, quavering, quivering, as though the issue\nwas of more than life or death:\n\n\"Not this?\"  She held up a corner of the shroud, and as she saw my face\nand realized the answer before I spoke, went on: \"With all it implies?\"\n\n\"Not if it were wrought of the cerecloths of the damned!\"  There was a\nlong pause.  Her voice was more resolute when she spoke again.  It rang.\nMoreover, there was in it a joyous note, as of one who feels new hope:\n\n\"But do you know what men say?  Some of them, that I am dead and buried;\nothers, that I am not only dead and buried, but that I am one of those\nunhappy beings that may not die the common death of man.  Who live on a\nfearful life-in-death, whereby they are harmful to all.  Those unhappy\nUn-dead whom men call Vampires--who live on the blood of the living, and\nbring eternal damnation as well as death with the poison of their\ndreadful kisses!\n\n\"I know what men say sometimes,\" I answered.  \"But I know also what my\nown heart says; and I rather choose to obey its calling than all the\nvoices of the living or the dead.  Come what may, I am pledged to you.\nIf it be that your old life has to be rewon for you out of the very jaws\nof Death and Hell, I shall keep the faith I have pledged, and that here I\npledge again!\"  As I finished speaking I sank on my knees at her feet,\nand, putting my arms round her, drew her close to me.  Her tears rained\ndown on my face as she stroked my hair with her soft, strong hand and\nwhispered to me:\n\n\"This is indeed to be one.  What more holy marriage can God give to any\nof His creatures?\"  We were both silent for a time.\n\nI think I was the first to recover my senses.  That I did so was manifest\nby my asking her: \"When may we meet again?\"--a thing I had never\nremembered doing at any of our former partings.  She answered with a\nrising and falling of the voice that was just above a whisper, as soft\nand cooing as the voice of a pigeon:\n\n\"That will be soon--as soon as I can manage it, be sure.  My dear, my\ndear!\"  The last four words of endearment she spoke in a low but\nprolonged and piercing tone which made me thrill with delight.\n\n\"Give me some token,\" I said, \"that I may have always close to me to ease\nmy aching heart till we meet again, and ever after, for love's sake!\"\nHer mind seemed to leap to understanding, and with a purpose all her own.\nStooping for an instant, she tore off with swift, strong fingers a\nfragment of her shroud.  This, having kissed it, she handed to me,\nwhispering:\n\n\"It is time that we part.  You must leave me now.  Take this, and keep it\nfor ever.  I shall be less unhappy in my terrible loneliness whilst it\nlasts if I know that this my gift, which for good or ill is a part of me\nas you know me, is close to you.  It may be, my very dear, that some day\nyou may be glad and even proud of this hour, as I am.\"  She kissed me as\nI took it.\n\n\"For life or death, I care not which, so long as I am with you!\" I said,\nas I moved off.  Descending the Jacob's ladder, I made my way down the\nrock-hewn passage.\n\nThe last thing I saw was the beautiful face of my Lady of the Shroud as\nshe leaned over the edge of the opening.  Her eyes were like glowing\nstars as her looks followed me.  That look shall never fade from my\nmemory.\n\nAfter a few agitating moments of thought I half mechanically took my way\ndown to the garden.  Opening the grille, I entered my lonely room, which\nlooked all the more lonely for the memory of the rapturous moments under\nthe Flagstaff.  I went to bed as one in a dream.  There I lay till\nsunrise--awake and thinking.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V: A RITUAL AT MIDNIGHT\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                          _June_ 20, 1907.\n\nThe time has gone as quickly as work can effect since I saw my Lady.  As\nI told the mountaineers, Rooke, whom I had sent on the service, had made\na contract for fifty thousand Ingis-Malbron rifles, and as many tons of\nammunition as the French experts calculated to be a full supply for a\nyear of warfare.  I heard from him by our secret telegraph code that the\norder had been completed, and that the goods were already on the way.\nThe morning after the meeting at the Flagstaff I had word that at night\nthe vessel--one chartered by Rooke for the purpose--would arrive at\nVissarion during the night.  We were all expectation.  I had always now\nin the Castle a signalling party, the signals being renewed as fast as\nthe men were sufficiently expert to proceed with their practice alone or\nin groups.  We hoped that every fighting-man in the country would in time\nbecome an expert signaller.  Beyond these, again, we have always a few\npriests.  The Church of the country is a militant Church; its priests are\nsoldiers, its Bishops commanders.  But they all serve wherever the battle\nmost needs them.  Naturally they, as men of brains, are quicker at\nlearning than the average mountaineers; with the result that they learnt\nthe code and the signalling almost by instinct.  We have now at least one\nsuch expert in each community of them, and shortly the priests alone will\nbe able to signal, if need be, for the nation; thus releasing for active\nservice the merely fighting-man.  The men at present with me I took into\nconfidence as to the vessel's arrival, and we were all ready for work\nwhen the man on the lookout at the Flagstaff sent word that a vessel\nwithout lights was creeping in towards shore.  We all assembled on the\nrocky edge of the creek, and saw her steal up the creek and gain the\nshelter of the harbour.  When this had been effected, we ran out the boom\nwhich protects the opening, and after that the great armoured\nsliding-gates which Uncle Roger had himself had made so as to protect the\nharbour in case of need.\n\nWe then came within and assisted in warping the steamer to the side of\nthe dock.\n\nRooke looked fit, and was full of fire and vigour.  His responsibility\nand the mere thought of warlike action seemed to have renewed his youth.\n\nWhen we had arranged for the unloading of the cases of arms and\nammunition, I took Rooke into the room which we call my \"office,\" where\nhe gave me an account of his doings.  He had not only secured the rifles\nand the ammunition for them, but he had purchased from one of the small\nAmerican Republics an armoured yacht which had been especially built for\nwar service.  He grew quite enthusiastic, even excited, as he told me of\nher:\n\n\"She is the last word in naval construction--a torpedo yacht.  A small\ncruiser, with turbines up to date, oil-fuelled, and fully armed with the\nlatest and most perfect weapons and explosives of all kinds.  The fastest\nboat afloat to-day.  Built by Thorneycroft, engined by Parsons, armoured\nby Armstrong, armed by Crupp.  If she ever comes into action, it will be\nbad for her opponent, for she need not fear to tackle anything less than\na _Dreadnought_.\"\n\nHe also told me that from the same Government, whose nation had just\nestablished an unlooked-for peace, he had also purchased a whole park of\nartillery of the very latest patterns, and that for range and accuracy\nthe guns were held to be supreme.  These would follow before long, and\nwith them their proper ammunition, with a shipload of the same to follow\nshortly after.\n\nWhen he had told me all the rest of his news, and handed me the accounts,\nwe went out to the dock to see the debarkation of the war material.\nKnowing that it was arriving, I had sent word in the afternoon to the\nmountaineers to tell them to come and remove it.  They had answered the\ncall, and it really seemed to me that the whole of the land must that\nnight have been in motion.\n\nThey came as individuals, grouping themselves as they came within the\ndefences of the Castle; some had gathered at fixed points on the way.\nThey went secretly and in silence, stealing through the forests like\nghosts, each party when it grouped taking the place of that which had\ngone on one of the routes radiating round Vissarion.  Their coming and\ngoing was more than ghostly.  It was, indeed, the outward manifestation\nof an inward spirit--a whole nation dominated by one common purpose.\n\nThe men in the steamer were nearly all engineers, mostly British, well\nconducted, and to be depended upon.  Rooke had picked them separately,\nand in the doing had used well his great experience of both men and\nadventurous life.  These men were to form part of the armoured yacht's\ncrew when she should come into the Mediterranean waters.  They and the\npriests and fighting-men in the Castle worked well together, and with a\nzeal that was beyond praise.  The heavy cases seemed almost of their own\naccord to leave the holds, so fast came the procession of them along the\ngangways from deck to dock-wall.  It was a part of my design that the\narms should be placed in centres ready for local distribution.  In such a\ncountry as this, without railways or even roads, the distribution of war\nmaterial in any quantity is a great labour, for it has to be done\nindividually, or at least from centres.\n\nBut of this work the great number of mountaineers who were arriving made\nlittle account.  As fast as the ship's company, with the assistance of\nthe priests and fighting-men, placed the cases on the quay, the engineers\nopened them and laid the contents ready for portage.  The mountaineers\nseemed to come in a continuous stream; each in turn shouldered his burden\nand passed out, the captain of his section giving him as he passed his\ninstruction where to go and in what route.  The method had been already\nprepared in my office ready for such a distribution when the arms should\narrive, and descriptions and quantities had been noted by the captains.\nThe whole affair was treated by all as a matter of the utmost secrecy.\nHardly a word was spoken beyond the necessary directions, and these were\ngiven in whispers.  All night long the stream of men went and came, and\ntowards dawn the bulk of the imported material was lessened by half.  On\nthe following night the remainder was removed, after my own men had\nstored in the Castle the rifles and ammunition reserved for its defence\nif necessary.  It was advisable to keep a reserve supply in case it\nshould ever be required.  The following night Rooke went away secretly in\nthe chartered vessel.  He had to bring back with him the purchased cannon\nand heavy ammunition, which had been in the meantime stored on one of the\nGreek islands.  The second morning, having had secret word that the\nsteamer was on the way, I had given the signal for the assembling of the\nmountaineers.\n\nA little after dark the vessel, showing no light, stole into the creek.\nThe barrier gates were once again closed, and when a sufficient number of\nmen had arrived to handle the guns, we began to unload.  The actual\ndeportation was easy enough, for the dock had all necessary appliances\nquite up to date, including a pair of shears for gun-lifting which could\nbe raised into position in a very short time.\n\nThe guns were well furnished with tackle of all sorts, and before many\nhours had passed a little procession of them disappeared into the woods\nin ghostly silence.  A number of men surrounded each, and they moved as\nwell as if properly supplied with horses.\n\nIn the meantime, and for a week after the arrival of the guns, the\ndrilling went on without pause.  The gun-drill was wonderful.  In the\narduous work necessary for it the great strength and stamina of the\nmountaineers showed out wonderfully.  They did not seem to know fatigue\nany more than they knew fear.\n\nFor a week this went on, till a perfect discipline and management was\nobtained.  They did not practise the shooting, for this would have made\nsecrecy impossible.  It was reported all along the Turkish frontier that\nthe Sultan's troops were being massed, and though this was not on a war\nfooting, the movement was more or less dangerous.  The reports of our own\nspies, although vague as to the purpose and extent of the movement, were\ndefinite as to something being on foot.  And Turkey does not do something\nwithout a purpose that bodes ill to someone.  Certainly the sound of\ncannon, which is a far-reaching sound, would have given them warning of\nour preparations, and would so have sadly minimized their effectiveness.\n\nWhen the cannon had all been disposed of--except, of course, those\ndestined for defence of the Castle or to be stored there--Rooke went away\nwith the ship and crew.  The ship he was to return to the owners; the men\nwould be shipped on the war-yacht, of whose crew they would form a part.\nThe rest of them had been carefully selected by Rooke himself, and were\nkept in secrecy at Cattaro, ready for service the moment required.  They\nwere all good men, and quite capable of whatever work they might be set\nto.  So Rooke told me, and he ought to know.  The experience of his young\ndays as a private made him an expert in such a job.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                          _June_ 24, 1907.\n\nLast night I got from my Lady a similar message to the last, and\ndelivered in a similar way.  This time, however, our meeting was to be on\nthe leads of the Keep.\n\nI dressed myself very carefully before going on this adventure, lest by\nany chance of household concern, any of the servants should see me; for\nif this should happen, Aunt Janet would be sure to hear of it, which\nwould give rise to endless surmises and questionings--a thing I was far\nfrom desiring.\n\nI confess that in thinking the matter over during the time I was making\nmy hurried preparations I was at a loss to understand how any human body,\neven though it be of the dead, could go or be conveyed to such a place\nwithout some sort of assistance, or, at least, collusion, on the part of\nsome of the inmates.  At the visit to the Flagstaff circumstances were\ndifferent.  This spot was actually outside the Castle, and in order to\nreach it I myself had to leave the Castle privately, and from the garden\nascend to the ramparts.  But here was no such possibility.  The Keep was\nan _imperium in imperio_.  It stood within the Castle, though separated\nfrom it, and it had its own defences against intrusion.  The roof of it\nwas, so far as I knew, as little approachable as the magazine.\n\nThe difficulty did not, however, trouble me beyond a mere passing\nthought.  In the joy of the coming meeting and the longing rapture at the\nmere thought of it, all difficulties disappeared.  Love makes its own\nfaith, and I never doubted that my Lady would be waiting for me at the\nplace designated.  When I had passed through the little arched passages,\nand up the doubly-grated stairways contrived in the massiveness of the\nwalls, I let myself out on the leads.  It was well that as yet the times\nwere sufficiently peaceful not to necessitate guards or sentries at all\nsuch points.\n\nThere, in a dim corner where the moonlight and the passing clouds threw\ndeep shadows, I saw her, clothed as ever in her shroud.  Why, I know not.\nI felt somehow that the situation was even more serious than ever.  But I\nwas steeled to whatever might come.  My mind had been already made up.\nTo carry out my resolve to win the woman I loved I was ready to face\ndeath.  But now, after we had for a few brief moments held each other in\nour arms, I was willing to accept death--or more than death.  Now, more\nthan before, was she sweet and dear to me.  Whatever qualms there might\nhave been at the beginning of our love-making, or during the progress of\nit, did not now exist.  We had exchanged vows and confidences, and\nacknowledged our loves.  What, then, could there be of distrust, or even\ndoubt, that the present might not set at naught?  But even had there been\nsuch doubts or qualms, they must have disappeared in the ardour of our\nmutual embrace.  I was by now mad for her, and was content to be so mad.\nWhen she had breath to speak after the strictness of our embrace, she\nsaid:\n\n\"I have come to warn you to be more than ever careful.\"  It was, I\nconfess, a pang to me, who thought only of love, to hear that anything\nelse should have been the initiative power of her coming, even though it\nhad been her concern for my own safety.  I could not but notice the\nbitter note of chagrin in my voice as I answered:\n\n\"It was for love's sake that _I_ came.\"  She, too, evidently felt the\nundercurrent of pain, for she said quickly:\n\n\"Ah, dearest, I, too, came for love's sake.  It is because I love you\nthat I am so anxious about you.  What would the world--ay, or heaven--be\nto me without you?\"\n\nThere was such earnest truth in her tone that the sense and realization\nof my own harshness smote me.  In the presence of such love as this even\na lover's selfishness must become abashed.  I could not express myself in\nwords, so simply raised her slim hand in mine and kissed it.  As it lay\nwarm in my own I could not but notice, as well as its fineness, its\nstrength and the firmness of its clasp.  Its warmth and fervour struck\ninto my heart--and my brain.  Thereupon I poured out to her once more my\nlove for her, she listening all afire.  When passion had had its say, the\ncalmer emotions had opportunity of expression.  When I was satisfied\nafresh of her affection, I began to value her care for my safety, and so\nI went back to the subject.  Her very insistence, based on personal\naffection, gave me more solid ground for fear.  In the moment of love\ntransports I had forgotten, or did not think, of what wonderful power or\nknowledge she must have to be able to move in such strange ways as she\ndid.  Why, at this very moment she was within my own gates.  Locks and\nbars, even the very seal of death itself, seemed unable to make for her a\nprison-house.  With such freedom of action and movement, going when she\nwould into secret places, what might she not know that was known to\nothers?  How could anyone keep secret from such an one even an ill\nintent?  Such thoughts, such surmises, had often flashed through my mind\nin moments of excitement rather than of reflection, but never long enough\nto become fixed into belief.  But yet the consequences, the convictions,\nof them were with me, though unconsciously, though the thoughts\nthemselves were perhaps forgotten or withered before development.\n\n\"And you?\" I asked her earnestly.  \"What about danger to you?\"  She\nsmiled, her little pearl-white teeth gleaming in the moonlight, as she\nspoke:\n\n\"There is no danger for me.  I am safe.  I am the safest person, perhaps\nthe only safe person, in all this land.\"  The full significance of her\nwords did not seem to come to me all at once.  Some base for\nunderstanding such an assertion seemed to be wanting.  It was not that I\ndid not trust or believe her, but that I thought she might be mistaken.\nI wanted to reassure myself, so in my distress I asked unthinkingly:\n\n\"How the safest?  What is your protection?\"  For several moments that\nspun themselves out endlessly she looked me straight in the face, the\nstars in her eyes seeming to glow like fire; then, lowering her head, she\ntook a fold of her shroud and held it up to me.\n\n\"This!\"\n\nThe meaning was complete and understandable now.  I could not speak at\nonce for the wave of emotion which choked me.  I dropped on my knees, and\ntaking her in my arms, held her close to me.  She saw that I was moved,\nand tenderly stroked my hair, and with delicate touch pressed down my\nhead on her bosom, as a mother might have done to comfort a frightened\nchild.\n\nPresently we got back to the realities of life again.  I murmured:\n\n\"Your safety, your life, your happiness are all-in-all to me.  When will\nyou let them be my care?\"  She trembled in my arms, nestling even closer\nto me.  Her own arms seemed to quiver with delight as she said:\n\n\"Would you indeed like me to be always with you?  To me it would be a\nhappiness unspeakable; and to you, what would it be?\"\n\nI thought that she wished to hear me speak my love to her, and that,\nwoman-like, she had led me to the utterance, and so I spoke again of the\npassion that now raged in me, she listening eagerly as we strained each\nother tight in our arms.  At last there came a pause, a long, long pause,\nand our hearts beat consciously in unison as we stood together.\nPresently she said in a sweet, low, intense whisper, as soft as the\nsighing of summer wind:\n\n\"It shall be as you wish; but oh, my dear, you will have to first go\nthrough an ordeal which may try you terribly!  Do not ask me anything!\nYou must not ask, because I may not answer, and it would be pain to me to\ndeny you anything.  Marriage with such an one as I am has its own ritual,\nwhich may not be foregone.  It may . . . \"  I broke passionately into her\nspeaking:\n\n\"There is no ritual that I fear, so long as it be that it is for your\ngood, and your lasting happiness.  And if the end of it be that I may\ncall you mine, there is no horror in life or death that I shall not\ngladly face.  Dear, I ask you nothing.  I am content to leave myself in\nyour hands.  You shall advise me when the time comes, and I shall be\nsatisfied, content to obey.  Content!  It is but a poor word to express\nwhat I long for!  I shall shirk nothing which may come to me from this or\nany other world, so long as it is to make you mine!\"  Once again her\nmurmured happiness was music to my ears:\n\n\"Oh, how you love me! how you love me, dear, dear!\"  She took me in her\narms, and for a few seconds we hung together.  Suddenly she tore herself\napart from me, and stood drawn up to the full height, with a dignity I\ncannot describe or express.  Her voice had a new dominance, as with firm\nutterance and in staccato manner she said:\n\n\"Rupert Sent Leger, before we go a step further I must say something to\nyou, ask you something, and I charge you, on your most sacred honour and\nbelief, to answer me truly.  Do you believe me to be one of those unhappy\nbeings who may not die, but have to live in shameful existence between\nearth and the nether world, and whose hellish mission is to destroy, body\nand soul, those who love them till they fall to their level?  You are a\ngentleman, and a brave one.  I have found you fearless.  Answer me in\nsternest truth, no matter what the issue may be!\"\n\nShe stood there in the glamorous moonlight with a commanding dignity\nwhich seemed more than human.  In that mystic light her white shroud\nseemed diaphanous, and she appeared like a spirit of power.  What was I\nto say?  How could I admit to such a being that I had actually had at\nmoments, if not a belief, a passing doubt?  It was a conviction with me\nthat if I spoke wrongly I should lose her for ever.  I was in a desperate\nstrait.  In such a case there is but one solid ground which one may rest\non--the Truth.\n\nI really felt I was between the devil and the deep sea.  There was no\navoiding the issue, and so, out of this all-embracing, all-compelling\nconviction of truth, I spoke.\n\nFor a fleeting moment I felt that my tone was truculent, and almost\nhesitated; but as I saw no anger or indignation on my Lady's face, but\nrather an eager approval, I was reassured.  A woman, after all, is glad\nto see a man strong, for all belief in him must be based on that.\n\n\"I shall speak the truth.  Remember that I have no wish to hurt your\nfeelings, but as you conjure me by my honour, you must forgive me if I\npain.  It is true that I had at first--ay, and later, when I came to\nthink matters over after you had gone, when reason came to the aid of\nimpression--a passing belief that you are a Vampire.  How can I fail to\nhave, even now, though I love you with all my soul, though I have held\nyou in my arms and kissed you on the mouth, a doubt, when all the\nevidences seem to point to one thing?  Remember that I have only seen you\nat night, except that bitter moment when, in the broad noonday of the\nupper world, I saw you, clad as ever in a shroud, lying seemingly dead in\na tomb in the crypt of St. Sava's Church . . . But let that pass.  Such\nbelief as I have is all in you.  Be you woman or Vampire, it is all the\nsame to me.  It is _you_ whom I love!  Should it be that you are--you are\nnot woman, which I cannot believe, then it will be my glory to break your\nfetters, to open your prison, and set you free.  To that I consecrate my\nlife.\"  For a few seconds I stood silent, vibrating with the passion\nwhich had been awakened in me.  She had by now lost the measure of her\nhaughty isolation, and had softened into womanhood again.  It was really\nlike a realization of the old theme of Pygmalion's statue.  It was with\nrather a pleading than a commanding voice that she said:\n\n\"And shall you always be true to me?\"\n\n\"Always--so help me, God!\" I answered, and I felt that there could be no\nlack of conviction in my voice.\n\nIndeed, there was no cause for such lack.  She also stood for a little\nwhile stone-still, and I was beginning to expand to the rapture which was\nin store for me when she should take me again in her arms.\n\nBut there was no such moment of softness.  All at once she started as if\nshe had suddenly wakened from a dream, and on the spur of the moment\nsaid:\n\n\"Now go, go!\"  I felt the conviction of necessity to obey, and turned at\nonce.  As I moved towards the door by which I had entered, I asked:\n\n\"When shall I see you again?\"\n\n\"Soon!\" came her answer.  \"I shall let you know soon--when and where.\nOh, go, go!\"  She almost pushed me from her.\n\nWhen I had passed through the low doorway and locked and barred it behind\nme, I felt a pang that I should have had to shut her out like that; but I\nfeared lest there should arise some embarrassing suspicion if the door\nshould be found open.  Later came the comforting thought that, as she had\ngot to the roof though the door had been shut, she would be able to get\naway by the same means.  She had evidently knowledge of some secret way\ninto the Castle.  The alternative was that she must have some\nsupernatural quality or faculty which gave her strange powers.  I did not\nwish to pursue that train of thought, and so, after an effort, shut it\nout from my mind.\n\nWhen I got back to my room I locked the door behind me, and went to sleep\nin the dark.  I did not want light just then--could not bear it.\n\nThis morning I woke, a little later than usual, with a kind of\napprehension which I could not at once understand.  Presently, however,\nwhen my faculties became fully awake and in working order, I realized\nthat I feared, half expected, that Aunt Janet would come to me in a worse\nstate of alarm than ever apropos of some new Second-Sight experience of\nmore than usual ferocity.\n\nBut, strange to say, I had no such visit.  Later on in the morning, when,\nafter breakfast, we walked together through the garden, I asked her how\nshe had slept, and if she had dreamt.  She answered me that she had slept\nwithout waking, and if she had had any dreams, they must have been\npleasant ones, for she did not remember them.  \"And you know, Rupert,\"\nshe added, \"that if there be anything bad or fearsome or warning in\ndreams, I always remember them.\"\n\nLater still, when I was by myself on the cliff beyond the creek, I could\nnot help commenting on the absence of her power of Second Sight on the\noccasion.  Surely, if ever there was a time when she might have had cause\nof apprehension, it might well have been when I asked the Lady whom she\ndid not know to marry me--the Lady of whose identity I knew nothing, even\nwhose name I did not know--whom I loved with all my heart and soul--my\nLady of the Shroud.\n\nI have lost faith in Second Sight.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 1, 1907.\n\nAnother week gone.  I have waited patiently, and I am at last rewarded by\nanother letter.  I was preparing for bed a little while ago, when I heard\nthe same mysterious sound at the door as on the last two occasions.  I\nhurried to the glass door, and there found another close-folded letter.\nBut I could see no sign of my Lady, or of any other living being.  The\nletter, which was without direction, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you are still of the same mind, and feel no misgivings, meet me at\nthe Church of St. Sava beyond the Creek to-morrow night at a quarter\nbefore midnight.  If you come, come in secret, and, of course, alone.  Do\nnot come at all unless you are prepared for a terrible ordeal.  But if\nyou love me, and have neither doubts nor fears, come.  Come!\"\n\nNeedless to say, I did not sleep last night.  I tried to, but without\nsuccess.  It was no morbid happiness that kept me awake, no doubting, no\nfear.  I was simply overwhelmed with the idea of the coming rapture when\nI should call my Lady my very, very own.  In this sea of happy\nexpectation all lesser things were submerged.  Even sleep, which is an\nimperative force with me, failed in its usual effectiveness, and I lay\nstill, calm, content.\n\nWith the coming of the morning, however, restlessness began.  I did not\nknow what to do, how to restrain myself, where to look for an anodyne.\nHappily the latter came in the shape of Rooke, who turned up shortly\nafter breakfast.  He had a satisfactory tale to tell me of the armoured\nyacht, which had lain off Cattaro on the previous night, and to which he\nhad brought his contingent of crew which had waited for her coming.  He\ndid not like to take the risk of going into any port with such a vessel,\nlest he might be detained or otherwise hampered by forms, and had gone\nout upon the open sea before daylight.  There was on board the yacht a\ntiny torpedo-boat, for which provision was made both for hoisting on deck\nand housing there.  This last would run into the creek at ten o'clock\nthat evening, at which time it would be dark.  The yacht would then run\nto near Otranto, to which she would send a boat to get any message I\nmight send.  This was to be in a code, which we arranged, and would\nconvey instructions as to what night and approximate hour the yacht would\ncome to the creek.\n\nThe day was well on before we had made certain arrangements for the\nfuture; and not till then did I feel again the pressure of my personal\nrestlessness.  Rooke, like a wise commander, took rest whilst he could.\nWell he knew that for a couple of days and nights at least there would be\nlittle, if any, sleep for him.\n\nFor myself, the habit of self-control stood to me, and I managed to get\nthrough the day somehow without exciting the attention of anyone else.\nThe arrival of the torpedo-boat and the departure of Rooke made for me a\nwelcome break in my uneasiness.  An hour ago I said good-night to Aunt\nJanet, and shut myself up alone here.  My watch is on the table before\nme, so that I may make sure of starting to the moment.  I have allowed\nmyself half an hour to reach St. Sava.  My skiff is waiting, moored at\nthe foot of the cliff on the hither side, where the zigzag comes close to\nthe water.  It is now ten minutes past eleven.\n\nI shall add the odd five minutes to the time for my journey so as to make\nsafe.  I go unarmed and without a light.\n\nI shall show no distrust of anyone or anything this night.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 2, 1907.\n\nWhen I was outside the church, I looked at my watch in the bright\nmoonlight, and found I had one minute to wait.  So I stood in the shadow\nof the doorway and looked out at the scene before me.  Not a sign of life\nwas visible around me, either on land or sea.  On the broad plateau on\nwhich the church stands there was no movement of any kind.  The wind,\nwhich had been pleasant in the noontide, had fallen completely, and not a\nleaf was stirring.  I could see across the creek and note the hard line\nwhere the battlements of the Castle cut the sky, and where the keep\ntowered above the line of black rock, which in the shadow of the land\nmade an ebon frame for the picture.  When I had seen the same view on\nformer occasions, the line where the rock rose from the sea was a fringe\nof white foam.  But then, in the daylight, the sea was sapphire blue; now\nit was an expanse of dark blue--so dark as to seem almost black.  It had\nnot even the relief of waves or ripples--simply a dark, cold, lifeless\nexpanse, with no gleam of light anywhere, of lighthouse or ship; neither\nwas there any special sound to be heard that one could\ndistinguish--nothing but the distant hum of the myriad voices of the dark\nmingling in one ceaseless inarticulate sound.  It was well I had not time\nto dwell on it, or I might have reached some spiritually-disturbing\nmelancholy.\n\nLet me say here that ever since I had received my Lady's message\nconcerning this visit to St. Sava's I had been all on fire--not, perhaps,\nat every moment consciously or actually so, but always, as it were,\nprepared to break out into flame.  Did I want a simile, I might compare\nmyself to a well-banked furnace, whose present function it is to contain\nheat rather than to create it; whose crust can at any moment be broken by\na force external to itself, and burst into raging, all-compelling heat.\nNo thought of fear really entered my mind.  Every other emotion there\nwas, coming and going as occasion excited or lulled, but not fear.  Well\nI knew in the depths of my heart the purpose which that secret quest was\nto serve.  I knew not only from my Lady's words, but from the teachings\nof my own senses and experiences, that some dreadful ordeal must take\nplace before happiness of any kind could be won.  And that ordeal, though\nmethod or detail was unknown to me, I was prepared to undertake.  This\nwas one of those occasions when a man must undertake, blindfold, ways\nthat may lead to torture or death, or unknown terrors beyond.  But, then,\na man--if, indeed, he have the heart of a man--can always undertake; he\ncan at least make the first step, though it may turn out that through the\nweakness of mortality he may be unable to fulfil his own intent, or\njustify his belief in his own powers.  Such, I take it, was the\nintellectual attitude of the brave souls who of old faced the tortures of\nthe Inquisition.\n\nBut though there was no immediate fear, there was a certain doubt.  For\ndoubt is one of those mental conditions whose calling we cannot control.\nThe end of the doubting may not be a reality to us, or be accepted as a\npossibility.  These things cannot forego the existence of the doubt.\n\"For even if a man,\" says Victor Cousin, \"doubt everything else, at least\nhe cannot doubt that he doubts.\"  The doubt had at times been on me that\nmy Lady of the Shroud was a Vampire.  Much that had happened seemed to\npoint that way, and here, on the very threshold of the Unknown, when,\nthrough the door which I was pushing open, my eyes met only an expanse of\nabsolute blackness, all doubts which had ever been seemed to surround me\nin a legion.  I have heard that, when a man is drowning, there comes a\ntime when his whole life passes in review during the space of time which\ncannot be computed as even a part of a second.  So it was to me in the\nmoment of my body passing into the church.  In that moment came to my\nmind all that had been, which bore on the knowledge of my Lady; and the\ngeneral tendency was to prove or convince that she was indeed a Vampire.\nMuch that had happened, or become known to me, seemed to justify the\nresolving of doubt into belief.  Even my own reading of the books in Aunt\nJanet's little library, and the dear lady's comments on them, mingled\nwith her own uncanny beliefs, left little opening for doubt.  My having\nto help my Lady over the threshold of my house on her first entry was in\naccord with Vampire tradition; so, too, her flying at cock-crow from the\nwarmth in which she revelled on that strange first night of our meeting;\nso, too, her swift departure at midnight on the second.  Into the same\ncategory came the facts of her constant wearing of her Shroud, even her\npledging herself, and me also, on the fragment torn from it, which she\nhad given to me as a souvenir; her lying still in the glass-covered tomb;\nher coming alone to the most secret places in a fortified Castle where\nevery aperture was secured by unopened locks and bolts; her very\nmovements, though all of grace, as she flitted noiselessly through the\ngloom of night.\n\nAll these things, and a thousand others of lesser import, seemed, for the\nmoment, to have consolidated an initial belief.  But then came the\nsupreme recollections of how she had lain in my arms; of her kisses on my\nlips; of the beating of her heart against my own; of her sweet words of\nbelief and faith breathed in my ear in intoxicating whispers; of . . . I\npaused.  No!  I could not accept belief as to her being other than a\nliving woman of soul and sense, of flesh and blood, of all the sweet and\npassionate instincts of true and perfect womanhood.\n\nAnd so, in spite of all--in spite of all beliefs, fixed or transitory,\nwith a mind whirling amid contesting forces and compelling beliefs--I\nstepped into the church overwhelmed with that most receptive of\natmospheres--doubt.\n\nIn one thing only was I fixed: here at least was no doubt or misgiving\nwhatever.  I intended to go through what I had undertaken.  Moreover, I\nfelt that I was strong enough to carry out my intention, whatever might\nbe of the Unknown--however horrible, however terrible.\n\nWhen I had entered the church and closed the heavy door behind me, the\nsense of darkness and loneliness in all their horror enfolded me round.\nThe great church seemed a living mystery, and served as an almost\nterrible background to thoughts and remembrances of unutterable gloom.\nMy adventurous life has had its own schooling to endurance and upholding\none's courage in trying times; but it has its contra in fulness of\nmemory.\n\nI felt my way forward with both hands and feet.  Every second seemed as\nif it had brought me at last to a darkness which was actually tangible.\nAll at once, and with no heed of sequence or order, I was conscious of\nall around me, the knowledge or perception of which--or even speculation\non the subject--had never entered my mind.  They furnished the darkness\nwith which I was encompassed with all the crowded phases of a dream.  I\nknew that all around me were memorials of the dead--that in the Crypt\ndeep-wrought in the rock below my feet lay the dead themselves.  Some of\nthem, perhaps--one of them I knew--had even passed the grim portals of\ntime Unknown, and had, by some mysterious power or agency, come back\nagain to material earth.  There was no resting-place for thought when I\nknew that the very air which I breathed might be full of denizens of the\nspirit-world.  In that impenetrable blackness was a world of imagining\nwhose possibilities of horror were endless.\n\nI almost fancied that I could see with mortal eyes down through that\nrocky floor to where, in the lonely Crypt, lay, in her tomb of massive\nstone and under that bewildering coverlet of glass, the woman whom I\nlove.  I could see her beautiful face, her long black lashes, her sweet\nmouth--which I had kissed--relaxed in the sleep of death.  I could note\nthe voluminous shroud--a piece of which as a precious souvenir lay even\nthen so close to my heart--the snowy woollen coverlet wrought over in\ngold with sprigs of pine, the soft dent in the cushion on which her head\nmust for so long have lain.  I could see myself--within my eyes the\nmemory of that first visit--coming once again with glad step to renew\nthat dear sight--dear, though it scorched my eyes and harrowed my\nheart--and finding the greater sorrow, the greater desolation of the\nempty tomb!\n\nThere!  I felt that I must think no more of that lest the thought should\nunnerve me when I should most want all my courage.  That way madness lay!\nThe darkness had already sufficient terrors of its own without bringing\nto it such grim remembrances and imaginings . . . And I had yet to go\nthrough some ordeal which, even to her who had passed and repassed the\nportals of death, was full of fear.\n\nIt was a merciful relief to me when, in groping my way forwards through\nthe darkness, I struck against some portion of the furnishing of the\nchurch.  Fortunately I was all strung up to tension, else I should never\nhave been able to control instinctively, as I did, the shriek which was\nrising to my lips.\n\nI would have given anything to have been able to light even a match.  A\nsingle second of light would, I felt, have made me my own man again.  But\nI knew that this would be against the implied condition of my being there\nat all, and might have had disastrous consequences to her whom I had come\nto save.  It might even frustrate my scheme, and altogether destroy my\nopportunity.  At that moment it was borne upon me more strongly than ever\nthat this was not a mere fight for myself or my own selfish purposes--not\nmerely an adventure or a struggle for only life and death against unknown\ndifficulties and dangers.  It was a fight on behalf of her I loved, not\nmerely for her life, but perhaps even for her soul.\n\nAnd yet this very thinking--understanding--created a new form of terror.\nFor in that grim, shrouding darkness came memories of other moments of\nterrible stress.\n\nOf wild, mystic rites held in the deep gloom of African forests, when,\namid scenes of revolting horror, Obi and the devils of his kind seemed to\nreveal themselves to reckless worshippers, surfeited with horror, whose\nlives counted for naught; when even human sacrifice was an episode, and\nthe reek of old deviltries and recent carnage tainted the air, till even\nI, who was, at the risk of my life, a privileged spectator who had come\nthrough dangers without end to behold the scene, rose and fled in horror.\n\nOf scenes of mystery enacted in rock-cut temples beyond the Himalayas,\nwhose fanatic priests, cold as death and as remorseless, in the reaction\nof their phrenzy of passion, foamed at the mouth and then sank into\nmarble quiet, as with inner eyes they beheld the visions of the hellish\npowers which they had invoked.\n\nOf wild, fantastic dances of the Devil-worshippers of Madagascar, where\neven the very semblance of humanity disappeared in the fantastic excesses\nof their orgies.\n\nOf strange doings of gloom and mystery in the rock-perched monasteries of\nThibet.\n\nOf awful sacrifices, all to mystic ends, in the innermost recesses of\nCathay.\n\nOf weird movements with masses of poisonous snakes by the medicine-men of\nthe Zuni and Mochi Indians in the far south-west of the Rockies, beyond\nthe great plains.\n\nOf secret gatherings in vast temples of old Mexico, and by dim altars of\nforgotten cities in the heart of great forests in South America.\n\nOf rites of inconceivable horror in the fastnesses of Patagonia.\n\nOf . . . Here I once more pulled myself up.  Such thoughts were no kind\nof proper preparation for what I might have to endure.  My work that\nnight was to be based on love, on hope, on self-sacrifice for the woman\nwho in all the world was the closest to my heart, whose future I was to\nshare, whether that sharing might lead me to Hell or Heaven.  The hand\nwhich undertook such a task must have no trembling.\n\nStill, those horrible memories had, I am bound to say, a useful part in\nmy preparation for the ordeal.  They were of fact which I had seen, of\nwhich I had myself been in part a sharer, and which I had survived.  With\nsuch experiences behind me, could there be aught before me more dreadful?\n. . .\n\nMoreover, if the coming ordeal was of supernatural or superhuman order,\ncould it transcend in living horror the vilest and most desperate acts of\nthe basest men? . . .\n\nWith renewed courage I felt my way before me, till my sense of touch told\nme that I was at the screen behind which lay the stair to the Crypt.\n\nThere I waited, silent, still.\n\nMy own part was done, so far as I knew how to do it.  Beyond this, what\nwas to come was, so far as I knew, beyond my own control.  I had done\nwhat I could; the rest must come from others.  I had exactly obeyed my\ninstructions, fulfilled my warranty to the utmost in my knowledge and\npower.  There was, therefore, left for me in the present nothing but to\nwait.\n\nIt is a peculiarity of absolute darkness that it creates its own\nreaction.  The eye, wearied of the blackness, begins to imagine forms of\nlight.  How far this is effected by imagination pure and simple I know\nnot.  It may be that nerves have their own senses that bring thought to\nthe depository common to all the human functions, but, whatever may be\nthe mechanism or the objective, the darkness seems to people itself with\nluminous entities.\n\nSo was it with me as I stood lonely in the dark, silent church.  Here and\nthere seemed to flash tiny points of light.\n\nIn the same way the silence began to be broken now and again by strange\nmuffled sounds--the suggestion of sounds rather than actual vibrations.\nThese were all at first of the minor importance of movement--rustlings,\ncreakings, faint stirrings, fainter breathings.  Presently, when I had\nsomewhat recovered from the sort of hypnotic trance to which the darkness\nand stillness had during the time of waiting reduced me, I looked around\nin wonder.\n\nThe phantoms of light and sound seemed to have become real.  There were\nmost certainly actual little points of light in places--not enough to see\ndetails by, but quite sufficient to relieve the utter gloom.  I\nthought--though it may have been a mingling of recollection and\nimagination--that I could distinguish the outlines of the church;\ncertainly the great altar-screen was dimly visible.  Instinctively I\nlooked up--and thrilled.  There, hung high above me, was, surely enough,\na great Greek Cross, outlined by tiny points of light.\n\nI lost myself in wonder, and stood still, in a purely receptive mood,\nunantagonistic to aught, willing for whatever might come, ready for all\nthings, in rather a negative than a positive mood--a mood which has an\naspect of spiritual meekness.  This is the true spirit of the neophyte,\nand, though I did not think of it at the time, the proper attitude for\nwhat is called by the Church in whose temple I stood a \"neo-nymph.\"\n\nAs the light grew a little in power, though never increasing enough for\ndistinctness, I saw dimly before me a table on which rested a great open\nbook, whereon were laid two rings--one of sliver, the other of gold--and\ntwo crowns wrought of flowers, bound at the joining of their stems with\ntissue--one of gold, the other of silver.  I do not know much of the\nritual of the old Greek Church, which is the religion of the Blue\nMountains, but the things which I saw before me could be none other than\nenlightening symbols.  Instinctively I knew that I had been brought\nhither, though in this grim way, to be married.  The very idea of it\nthrilled me to the heart's core.  I thought the best thing I could do\nwould be to stay quite still, and not show surprise at anything that\nmight happen; but be sure I was all eyes and ears.\n\nI peered anxiously around me in every direction, but I could see no sign\nof her whom I had come to meet.\n\nIncidentally, however, I noticed that in the lighting, such as it was,\nthere was no flame, no \"living\" light.  Whatever light there was came\nmuffled, as though through some green translucent stone.  The whole\neffect was terribly weird and disconcerting.\n\nPresently I started, as, seemingly out of the darkness beside me, a man's\nhand stretched out and took mine.  Turning, I found close to me a tall\nman with shining black eyes and long black hair and beard.  He was clad\nin some kind of gorgeous robe of cloth of gold, rich with variety of\nadornment.  His head was covered with a high, over-hanging hat draped\nclosely with a black scarf, the ends of which formed a long, hanging veil\non either side.  These veils, falling over the magnificent robes of cloth\nof gold, had an extraordinarily solemn effect.\n\nI yielded myself to the guiding hand, and shortly found myself, so far as\nI could see, at one side of the sanctuary.\n\nIn the floor close to my feet was a yawning chasm, into which, from so\nhigh over my head that in the uncertain light I could not distinguish its\norigin, hung a chain.  At the sight a strange wave of memory swept over\nme.  I could not but remember the chain which hung over the glass-covered\ntomb in the Crypt, and I had an instinctive feeling that the grim chasm\nin the floor of the sanctuary was but the other side of the opening in\nthe roof of the crypt from which the chain over the sarcophagus depended.\n\nThere was a creaking sound--the groaning of a windlass and the clanking\nof a chain.  There was heavy breathing close to me somewhere.  I was so\nintent on what was going on that I did not see that one by one, seeming\nto grow out of the surrounding darkness, several black figures in monkish\ngarb appeared with the silence of ghosts.  Their faces were shrouded in\nblack cowls, wherein were holes through which I could see dark gleaming\neyes.  My guide held me tightly by the hand.  This gave me a feeling of\nsecurity in the touch which helped to retain within my breast some\nsemblance of calm.\n\nThe strain of the creaking windlass and the clanking chain continued for\nso long that the suspense became almost unendurable.  At last there came\ninto sight an iron ring, from which as a centre depended four lesser\nchains spreading wide.  In a few seconds more I could see that these were\nfixed to the corners of the great stone tomb with the covering of glass,\nwhich was being dragged upward.  As it arose it filled closely the whole\naperture.  When its bottom had reached the level of the floor it stopped,\nand remained rigid.  There was no room for oscillation.  It was at once\nsurrounded by a number of black figures, who raised the glass covering\nand bore it away into the darkness.  Then there stepped forward a very\ntall man, black-bearded, and with head-gear like my guide, but made in\ntriple tiers, he also was gorgeously arrayed in flowing robes of cloth of\ngold richly embroidered.  He raised his hand, and forthwith eight other\nblack-clad figures stepped forward, and bending over the stone coffin,\nraised from it the rigid form of my Lady, still clad in her Shroud, and\nlaid it gently on the floor of the sanctuary.\n\nI felt it a grace that at that instant the dim lights seemed to grow\nless, and finally to disappear--all save the tiny points that marked the\noutline of the great Cross high overhead.  These only gave light enough\nto accentuate the gloom.  The hand that held mine now released it, and\nwith a sigh I realized that I was alone.  After a few moments more of the\ngroaning of the winch and clanking of the chain there was a sharp sound\nof stone meeting stone; then there was silence.  I listened acutely, but\ncould not hear near me the slightest sound.  Even the cautious,\nrestrained breathing around me, of which up to then I had been conscious,\nhad ceased.  Not knowing, in the helplessness of my ignorance, what I\nshould do, I remained as I was, still and silent, for a time that seemed\nendless.  At last, overcome by some emotion which I could not at the\nmoment understand, I slowly sank to my knees and bowed my head.  Covering\nmy face with my hands, I tried to recall the prayers of my youth.  It was\nnot, I am certain, that fear in any form had come upon me, or that I\nhesitated or faltered in my intention.  That much I know now; I knew it\neven then.  It was, I believe, that the prolonged impressive gloom and\nmystery had at last touched me to the quick.  The bending of the knees\nwas but symbolical of the bowing of the spirit to a higher Power.  When I\nhad realized that much, I felt more content than I had done since I had\nentered the church, and with the renewed consciousness of courage, took\nmy hands from my face, and lifted again my bowed head.\n\nImpulsively I sprang to my feet and stood erect--waiting.  All seemed to\nhave changed since I had dropped on my knees.  The points of light about\ntime church, which had been eclipsed, had come again, and were growing in\npower to a partial revealing of the dim expanse.  Before me was the table\nwith the open book, on which were laid the gold and silver rings and the\ntwo crowns of flowers.  There were also two tall candles, with tiniest\nflames of blue--the only living light to be seen.\n\nOut of the darkness stepped the same tall figure in the gorgeous robes\nand the triple hat.  He led by the hand my Lady, still clad in her\nShroud; but over it, descending from the crown of her head, was a veil of\nvery old and magnificent lace of astonishing fineness.  Even in that dim\nlight I could note the exquisite beauty of the fabric.  The veil was\nfastened with a bunch of tiny sprays of orange-blossom mingled with\ncypress and laurel--a strange combination.  In her hand she carried a\ngreat bouquet of the same.  Its sweet intoxicating odour floated up to my\nnostrils.  It and the sentiment which its very presence evoked made me\nquiver.\n\nYielding to the guiding of the hand which held hers, she stood at my left\nside before the table.  Her guide then took his place behind her.  At\neither end of the table, to right and left of us, stood a long-bearded\npriest in splendid robes, and wearing the hat with depending veil of\nblack.  One of them, who seemed to be the more important of the two, and\ntook the initiative, signed to us to put our right hands on the open\nbook.  My Lady, of course, understood the ritual, and knew the words\nwhich the priest was speaking, and of her own accord put out her hand.\nMy guide at the same moment directed my hand to the same end.  It\nthrilled me to touch my Lady's hand, even under such mysterious\nconditions.\n\nAfter the priest had signed us each thrice on the forehead with the sign\nof the Cross, he gave to each of us a tiny lighted taper brought to him\nfor the purpose.  The lights were welcome, not so much for the solace of\nthe added light, great as that was, but because it allowed us to see a\nlittle more of each other's faces.  It was rapture to me to see the face\nof my Bride; and from the expression of her face I was assured that she\nfelt as I did.  It gave me an inexpressible pleasure when, as her eyes\nrested on me, there grew a faint blush over the grey pallor of her\ncheeks.\n\nThe priest then put in solemn voice to each of us in turn, beginning with\nme, the questions of consent which are common to all such rituals.  I\nanswered as well as I could, following the murmured words of my guide.\nMy Lady answered out proudly in a voice which, though given softly,\nseemed to ring.  It was a concern--even a grief--to me that I could not,\nin the priest's questioning, catch her name, of which, strangely\nenough,--I was ignorant.  But, as I did not know the language, and as the\nphrases were not in accord literally with our own ritual, I could not\nmake out which word was the name.\n\nAfter some prayers and blessings, rhythmically spoken or sung by an\ninvisible choir, the priest took the rings from the open book, and, after\nsigning my forehead thrice with the gold one as he repeated the blessing\nin each case, placed it on my right hand; then he gave my Lady the silver\none, with the same ritual thrice repeated.  I suppose it was the blessing\nwhich is the effective point in making two into one.\n\nAfter this, those who stood behind us exchanged our rings thrice, taking\nthem from one finger and placing them on the other, so that at the end my\nwife wore the gold ring and I the silver one.\n\nThen came a chant, during which the priest swung the censer himself, and\nmy wife and I held our tapers.  After that he blessed us, the responses\ncoming from the voices of the unseen singers in the darkness.\n\nAfter a long ritual of prayer and blessing, sung in triplicate, the\npriest took the crowns of flowers, and put one on the head of each,\ncrowning me first, and with the crown tied with gold.  Then he signed and\nblessed us each thrice.  The guides, who stood behind us, exchanged our\ncrowns thrice, as they had exchanged the rings; so that at the last, as I\nwas glad to see, my wife wore the crown of gold, and I that of silver.\n\nThen there came, if it is possible to describe such a thing, a hush over\neven that stillness, as though some form of added solemnity were to be\ngone through.  I was not surprised, therefore, when the priest took in\nhis hands the great golden chalice.  Kneeling, my wife and I partook\ntogether thrice.\n\nWhen we had risen from our knees and stood for a little while, the priest\ntook my left hand in his right, and I, by direction of my guide, gave my\nright hand to my wife.  And so in a line, the priest leading, we circled\nround the table in rhythmic measure.  Those who supported us moved behind\nus, holding the crowns over our heads, and replacing them when we\nstopped.\n\nAfter a hymn, sung through the darkness, the priest took off our crowns.\nThis was evidently the conclusion of the ritual, for the priest placed us\nin each other's arms to embrace each other.  Then he blessed us, who were\nnow man and wife!\n\nThe lights went out at once, some as if extinguished, others slowly\nfading down to blackness.\n\nLeft in the dark, my wife and I sought each other's arms again, and stood\ntogether for a few moments heart to heart, tightly clasping each other,\nand kissed each other fervently.\n\nInstinctively we turned to the door of the church, which was slightly\nopen, so that we could see the moonlight stealing in through the\naperture.  With even steps, she holding me tightly by the left arm--which\nis the wife's arm, we passed through the old church and out into the free\nair.\n\nDespite all that the gloom had brought me, it was sweet to be in the open\nair and together--this quite apart from our new relations to each other.\nThe moon rode high, and the full light, coming after the dimness or\ndarkness in the church, seemed as bright as day.  I could now, for the\nfirst time, see my wife's face properly.  The glamour of the moonlight\nmay have served to enhance its ethereal beauty, but neither moonlight nor\nsunlight could do justice to that beauty in its living human splendour.\nAs I gloried in her starry eyes I could think of nothing else; but when\nfor a moment my eyes, roving round for the purpose of protection, caught\nsight of her whole figure, there was a pang to my heart.  The brilliant\nmoonlight showed every detail in terrible effect, and I could see that\nshe wore only her Shroud.  In the moment of darkness, after the last\nbenediction, before she returned to my arms, she must have removed her\nbridal veil.  This may, of course, have been in accordance with the\nestablished ritual of her church; but, all the same, my heart was sore.\nThe glamour of calling her my very own was somewhat obscured by the\nbridal adornment being shorn.  But it made no difference in her sweetness\nto me.  Together we went along the path through the wood, she keeping\nequal step with me in wifely way.\n\nWhen we had come through the trees near enough to see the roof of the\nCastle, now gilded with the moonlight, she stopped, and looking at me\nwith eyes full of love, said:\n\n\"Here I must leave you!\"\n\n\"What?\"  I was all aghast, and I felt that my chagrin was expressed in\nthe tone of horrified surprise in my voice.  She went on quickly:\n\n\"Alas!  It is impossible that I should go farther--at present!\"\n\n\"But what is to prevent you?\" I queried.  \"You are now my wife.  This is\nour wedding-night; and surely your place is with me!\"  The wail in her\nvoice as she answered touched me to the quick:\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know!  There is no dearer wish in my heart--there can be\nnone--than to share my husband's home.  Oh, my dear, my dear, if you only\nknew what it would be to me to be with you always!  But indeed I may\nnot--not yet!  I am not free!  If you but knew how much that which has\nhappened to-night has cost me--or how much cost to others as well as to\nmyself may be yet to come--you would understand.  Rupert\"--it was the\nfirst time she had ever addressed me by name, and naturally it thrilled\nme through and through--\"Rupert, my husband, only that I trust you with\nall the faith which is in perfect love--mutual love, I dare not have done\nwhat I have done this night.  But, dear, I know that you will bear me\nout; that your wife's honour is your honour, even as your honour is mine.\nMy honour is given to this; and you can help me--the only help I can have\nat present--by trusting me.  Be patient, my beloved, be patient!  Oh, be\npatient for a little longer!  It shall not be for long.  So soon as ever\nmy soul is freed I shall come to you, my husband; and we shall never part\nagain.  Be content for a while!  Believe me that I love you with my very\nsoul; and to keep away from your dear side is more bitter for me than\neven it can be for you!  Think, my dear one, I am not as other women are,\nas some day you shall clearly understand.  I am at the present, and shall\nbe for a little longer, constrained by duties and obligations put upon me\nby others, and for others, and to which I am pledged by the most sacred\npromises--given not only by myself, but by others--and which I must not\nforgo.  These forbid me to do as I wish.  Oh, trust me, my beloved--my\nhusband!\"\n\nShe held out her hands appealingly.  The moonlight, falling through the\nthinning forest, showed her white cerements.  Then the recollection of\nall she must have suffered--the awful loneliness in that grim tomb in the\nCrypt, the despairing agony of one who is helpless against the\nunknown--swept over me in a wave of pity.  What could I do but save her\nfrom further pain?  And this could only be by showing her my faith and\ntrust.  If she was to go back to that dreadful charnel-house, she would\nat least take with her the remembrance that one who loved her and whom\nshe loved--to whom she had been lately bound in the mystery of\nmarriage--trusted her to the full.  I loved her more than myself--more\nthan my own soul; and I was moved by pity so great that all possible\nselfishness was merged in its depths.  I bowed my head before her--my\nLady and my Wife--as I said:\n\n\"So be it, my beloved.  I trust you to the full, even as you trust me.\nAnd that has been proven this night, even to my own doubting heart.  I\nshall wait; and as I know you wish it, I shall wait as patiently as I\ncan.  But till you come to me for good and all, let me see you or hear\nfrom you when you can.  The time, dear wife, must go heavily with me as I\nthink of you suffering and lonely.  So be good to me, and let not too\nlong a time elapse between my glimpses of hope.  And, sweetheart, when\nyou _do_ come to me, it shall be for ever!\"  There was something in the\nintonation of the last sentence--I felt its sincerity myself--some\nimplied yearning for a promise, that made her beautiful eyes swim.  The\nglorious stars in them were blurred as she answered with a fervour which\nseemed to me as more than earthly:\n\n\"For ever!  I swear it!\"\n\nWith one long kiss, and a straining in each others arms, which left me\ntingling for long after we had lost sight of each other, we parted.  I\nstood and watched her as her white figure, gliding through the deepening\ngloom, faded as the forest thickened.  It surely was no optical delusion\nor a phantom of the mind that her shrouded arm was raised as though in\nblessing or farewell before the darkness swallowed her up.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI: THE PURSUIT IN THE FOREST\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 3, 1907.\n\nThere is no anodyne but work to pain of the heart; and my pain is all of\nthe heart.  I sometimes feel that it is rather hard that with so much to\nmake me happy I cannot know happiness.  How can I be happy when my wife,\nwhom I fondly love, and who I know loves me, is suffering in horror and\nloneliness of a kind which is almost beyond human belief?  However, what\nis my loss is my country's gain, for the Land of the Blue Mountains is my\ncountry now, despite the fact that I am still a loyal subject of good\nKing Edward.  Uncle Roger took care of that when he said I should have\nthe consent of the Privy Council before I might be naturalized anywhere\nelse.\n\nWhen I got home yesterday morning I naturally could not sleep.  The\nevents of the night and the bitter disappointment that followed my\nexciting joy made such a thing impossible.  When I drew the curtain over\nthe window, the reflection of the sunrise was just beginning to tinge the\nhigh-sailing clouds in front of me.  I laid down and tried to rest, but\nwithout avail.  However, I schooled myself to lie still, and at last, if\nI did not sleep, was at least quiescent.\n\nDisturbed by a gentle tap at the door, I sprang up at once and threw on a\ndressing gown.  Outside, when I opened the door, was Aunt Janet.  She was\nholding a lighted candle in her hand, for though it was getting light in\nthe open, the passages were still dark.  When she saw me she seemed to\nbreathe more freely, and asked if she might come in.\n\nWhilst she sat on the edge of my bed, in her old-time way, she said in a\nhushed voice:\n\n\"Oh, laddie, laddie, I trust yer burden is no too heavy to bear.\"\n\n\"My burden!  What on earth do you mean, Aunt Janet?\" I said in reply.  I\ndid not wish to commit myself by a definite answer, for it was evident\nthat she had been dreaming or Second Sighting again.  She replied with\nthe grim seriousness usual to her when she touched on occult matters:\n\n\"I saw your hairt bleeding, laddie.  I kent it was yours, though how I\nkent it I don't know.  It lay on a stone floor in the dark, save for a\ndim blue light such as corpse-lights are.  On it was placed a great book,\nand close around were scattered many strange things, amongst them two\ncrowns o' flowers--the one bound wi' silver, the other wi' gold.  There\nwas also a golden cup, like a chalice, o'erturned.  The red wine trickled\nfrom it an' mingled wi' yer hairt's bluid; for on the great book was some\nvast dim weight wrapped up in black, and on it stepped in turn many men\nall swathed in black.  An' as the weight of each came on it the bluid\ngushed out afresh.  And oh, yer puir hairt, my laddie, was quick and\nleaping, so that at every beat it raised the black-clad weight!  An' yet\nthat was not all, for hard by stood a tall imperial shape o' a woman, all\narrayed in white, wi' a great veil o' finest lace worn o'er a shrood.\nAn' she was whiter than the snow, an' fairer than the morn for beauty;\nthough a dark woman she was, wi' hair like the raven, an' eyes black as\nthe sea at nicht, an' there was stars in them.  An' at each beat o' yer\npuir bleeding hairt she wrung her white hands, an' the manin' o' her\nsweet voice rent my hairt in twain.  Oh, laddie, laddie! what does it\nmean?\"\n\nI managed to murmur: \"I'm sure I don't know, Aunt Janet.  I suppose it\nwas all a dream!\"\n\n\"A dream it was, my dear.  A dream or a veesion, whilka matters nane, for\na' such are warnin's sent frae God . . . \"  Suddenly she said in a\ndifferent voice:\n\n\"Laddie, hae ye been fause to any lassie?  I'm no blamin' ye.  For ye men\nare different frae us women, an' yer regard on recht and wrang differs\nfrom oors.  But oh, laddie, a woman's tears fa' heavy when her hairt is\nfor sair wi' the yieldin' to fause words.  'Tis a heavy burden for ony\nman to carry wi' him as he goes, an' may well cause pain to ithers that\nhe fain would spare.\"  She stopped, and in dead silence waited for me to\nspeak.  I thought it would be best to set her poor loving heart at rest,\nand as I could not divulge my special secret, spoke in general terms:\n\n\"Aunt Janet, I am a man, and have led a man's life, such as it is.  But I\ncan tell you, who have always loved me and taught me to be true, that in\nall the world there is no woman who must weep for any falsity of mine.\nIf close there be any who, sleeping or waking, in dreams or visions or in\nreality, weeps because of me, it is surely not for my doing, but because\nof something outside me.  It may be that her heart is sore because I must\nsuffer, as all men must in some degree; but she does not weep for or\nthrough any act of mine.\"\n\nShe sighed happily at my assurance, and looked up through her tears, for\nshe was much moved; and after tenderly kissing my forehead and blessing\nme, stole away.  She was more sweet and tender than I have words to say,\nand the only regret that I have in all that is gone is that I have not\nbeen able to bring my wife to her, and let her share in the love she has\nfor me.  But that, too, will come, please God!\n\nIn the morning I sent a message to Rooke at Otranto, instructing him by\ncode to bring the yacht to Vissarion in the coming night.\n\nAll day I spent in going about amongst the mountaineers, drilling them\nand looking after their arms.  I _could_ not stay still.  My only chance\nof peace was to work, my only chance of sleep to tire myself out.\nUnhappily, I am very strong, so even when I came home at dark I was quite\nfresh.  However, I found a cable message from Rooke that the yacht would\narrive at midnight.\n\nThere was no need to summon the mountaineers, as the men in the Castle\nwould be sufficient to make preparations for the yacht's coming.\n\n                                                                  _Later_.\n\nThe yacht has come.  At half-past eleven the lookout signalled that a\nsteamer without lights was creeping in towards the Creek.  I ran out to\nthe Flagstaff, and saw her steal in like a ghost.  She is painted a\nsteely blue-grey, and it is almost impossible to see her at any distance.\nShe certainly goes wonderfully.  Although there was not enough throb from\nthe engines to mar the absolute stillness, she came on at a fine speed,\nand within a few minutes was close to the boom.  I had only time to run\ndown to give orders to draw back the boom when she glided in and stopped\ndead at the harbour wall.  Rooke steered her himself, and he says he\nnever was on a boat that so well or so quickly answered her helm.  She is\ncertainly a beauty, and so far as I can see at night perfect in every\ndetail.  I promise myself a few pleasant hours over her in the daylight.\nThe men seem a splendid lot.\n\nBut I do not feel sleepy; I despair of sleep to-night.  But work demands\nthat I be fit for whatever may come, and so I shall try to sleep--to\nrest, at any rate.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL.--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 4, 1907.\n\nI was up with the first ray of sunrise, so by the time I had my bath and\nwas dressed there was ample light.  I went down to the dock at once, and\nspent the morning looking over the vessel, which fully justifies Rooke's\nenthusiasm about her.  She is built on lovely lines, and I can quite\nunderstand that she is enormously fast.  Her armour I can only take on\nthe specifications, but her armament is really wonderful.  And there are\nnot only all the very newest devices of aggressive warfare--indeed, she\nhas the newest up-to-date torpedoes and torpedo-guns--but also the\nold-fashioned rocket-tubes, which in certain occasions are so useful.\nShe has electric guns and the latest Massillon water-guns, and Reinhardt\nelectro-pneumatic \"deliverers\" for pyroxiline shells.  She is even\nequipped with war-balloons easy of expansion, and with compressible\nKitson aeroplanes.  I don't suppose that there is anything quite like her\nin the world.\n\nThe crew are worthy of her.  I can't imagine where Rooke picked up such a\nsplendid lot of men.  They are nearly all man-of-warsmen; of various\nnationalities, but mostly British.  All young men--the oldest of them\nhasn't got into the forties--and, so far as I can learn, all experts of\none kind or another in some special subject of warfare.  It will go hard\nwith me, but I shall keep them together.\n\nHow I got through the rest of the day I know not.  I tried hard not to\ncreate any domestic trouble by my manner, lest Aunt Janet should, after\nher lurid dream or vision of last night, attach some new importance to\nit.  I think I succeeded, for she did not, so far as I could tell, take\nany special notice of me.  We parted as usual at half-past ten, and I\ncame here and made this entry in my journal.  I am more restless than\never to-night, and no wonder.  I would give anything to be able to pay a\nvisit to St. Sava's, and see my wife again--if it were only sleeping in\nher tomb.  But I dare not do even that, lest she should come to see me\nhere, and I should miss her.  So I have done what I can.  The glass door\nto the Terrace is open, so that she can enter at once if she comes.  The\nfire is lit, and the room is warm.  There is food ready in case she\nshould care for it.  I have plenty of light in the room, so that through\nthe aperture where I have not fully drawn the curtain there may be light\nto guide her.\n\nOh, how the time drags!  The clock has struck midnight.  One, two!  Thank\ngoodness, it will shortly be dawn, and the activity of the day may begin!\nWork may again prove, in a way, to be an anodyne.  In the meantime I must\nwrite on, lest despair overwhelm me.\n\nOnce during the night I thought I heard a footstep outside.  I rushed to\nthe window and looked out, but there was nothing to see, no sound to\nhear.  That was a little after one o'clock.  I feared to go outside, lest\nthat should alarm her; so I came back to my table.  I could not write,\nbut I sat as if writing for a while.  But I could not stand it, so rose\nand walked about the room.  As I walked I felt that my Lady--it gives me\na pang every time I remember that I do not know even her name--was not\nquite so far away from me.  It made my heart beat to think that it might\nmean that she was coming to me.  Could not I as well as Aunt Janet have a\nlittle Second Sight!  I went towards the window, and, standing behind the\ncurtain, listened.  Far away I thought I heard a cry, and ran out on the\nTerrace; but there was no sound to be heard, and no sign of any living\nthing anywhere; so I took it for granted that it was the cry of some\nnight bird, and came back to my room, and wrote at my journal till I was\ncalm.  I think my nerves must be getting out of order, when every sound\nof the night seems to have a special meaning for me.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                            _July_ 7, 1907\n\nWhen the grey of the morning came, I gave up hope of my wife appearing,\nand made up my mind that, so soon as I could get away without exciting\nAunt Janet's attention, I would go to St. Sava's.  I always eat a good\nbreakfast, and did I forgo it altogether, it would be sure to excite her\ncuriosity--a thing I do not wish at present.  As there was still time to\nwait, I lay down on my bed as I was, and--such is the way of\nFate--shortly fell asleep.\n\nI was awakened by a terrific clattering at my door.  When I opened it I\nfound a little group of servants, very apologetic at awaking me without\ninstructions.  The chief of them explained that a young priest had come\nfrom the Vladika with a message so urgent that he insisted on seeing me\nimmediately at all hazards.  I came out at once, and found him in the\nhall of the Castle, standing before the great fire, which was always lit\nin the early morning.  He had a letter in his hand, but before giving it\nto me he said:\n\n\"I am sent by the Vladika, who pressed on me that I was not to lose a\nsingle instant in seeing you; that time is of golden price--nay, beyond\nprice.  This letter, amongst other things, vouches for me.  A terrible\nmisfortune has occurred.  The daughter of our leader has disappeared\nduring last night--the same, he commanded me to remind you, that he spoke\nof at the meeting when he would not let the mountaineers fire their guns.\nNo sign of her can be found, and it is believed that she has been carried\noff by the emissaries of the Sultan of Turkey, who once before brought\nour nations to the verge of war by demanding her as a wife.  I was also\nto say that the Vladika Plamenac would have come himself, but that it was\nnecessary that he should at once consult with the Archbishop, Stevan\nPalealogue, as to what step is best to take in this dire calamity.  He\nhas sent out a search-party under the Archimandrite of Spazac, Petrof\nVlastimir, who is to come on here with any news he can get, as you have\ncommand of the signalling, and can best spread the news.  He knows that\nyou, Gospodar, are in your great heart one of our compatriots, and that\nyou have already proved your friendship by many efforts to strengthen our\nhands for war.  And as a great compatriot, he calls on you to aid us in\nour need.\"  He then handed me the letter, and stood by respectfully\nwhilst I broke the seal and read it.  It was written in great haste, and\nsigned by the Vladika.\n\n\"Come with us now in our nation's peril.  Help us to rescue what we most\nadore, and henceforth we shall hold you in our hearts.  You shall learn\nhow the men of the Blue Mountains can love faith and valour.  Come!\"\n\nThis was a task indeed--a duty worthy of any man.  It thrilled me to the\ncore to know that the men of the Blue Mountains had called on me in their\ndire need.  It woke all the fighting instinct of my Viking forbears, and\nI vowed in my heart that they should be satisfied with my work.  I called\nto me the corps of signallers who were in the house, and led them to the\nCastle roof, taking with me the young messenger-priest.\n\n\"Come with me,\" I said to him, \"and see how I answer the Vladika's\ncommand.\"\n\nThe National flag was run up--the established signal that the nation was\nin need.  Instantly on every summit near and far was seen the flutter of\nan answering flag.  Quickly followed the signal that commanded the call\nto arms.\n\nOne by one I gave the signallers orders in quick succession, for the plan\nof search unfolded itself to me as I went on.  The arms of the semaphore\nwhirled in a way that made the young priest stare.  One by one, as they\ntook their orders, the signallers seemed to catch fire.  Instinctively\nthey understood the plan, and worked like demigods.  They knew that so\nwidespread a movement had its best chance in rapidity and in unity of\naction.\n\nFrom the forest which lay in sight of the Castle came a wild cheering,\nwhich seemed to interpret the former stillness of the hills.  It was good\nto feel that those who saw the signals--types of many--were ready.  I saw\nthe look of expectation on the face of the messenger-priest, and rejoiced\nat the glow that came as I turned to him to speak.  Of course, he wanted\nto know something of what was going on.  I saw the flashing of my own\neyes reflected in his as I spoke:\n\n\"Tell the Vladika that within a minute of his message being read the Land\nof the Blue Mountains was awake.  The mountaineers are already marching,\nand before the sun is high there will be a line of guards within hail of\neach other round the whole frontier--from Angusa to Ilsin; from Ilsin to\nBajana; from Bajana to Ispazar; from Ispazar to Volok; from Volok to\nTatra; from Tatra to Domitan; from Domitan to Gravaja; and from Gravaja\nback to Angusa.  The line is double.  The old men keep guard on the line,\nand the young men advance.  These will close in at the advancing line, so\nthat nothing can escape them.  They will cover mountain-top and forest\ndepth, and will close in finally on the Castle here, which they can\nbehold from afar.  My own yacht is here, and will sweep the coast from\nend to end.  It is the fastest boat afloat, and armed against a squadron.\nHere will all signals come.  In an hour where we stand will be a signal\nbureau, where trained eyes will watch night and day till the lost one has\nbeen found and the outrage has been avenged.  The robbers are even now\nwithin a ring of steel, and cannot escape.\"\n\nThe young priest, all on fire, sprang on the battlements and shouted to\nthe crowd, which was massing round the Castle in the gardens far below.\nThe forest was giving up its units till they seemed like the nucleus of\nan army.  The men cheered lustily, till the sound swung high up to us\nlike the roaring of a winter sea.  With bared heads they were crying:\n\n\"God and the Blue Mountains!  God and the Blue Mountains!\"\n\nI ran down to them as quickly as I could, and began to issue their\ninstructions.  Within a time to be computed by minutes the whole number,\norganized by sections, had started to scour the neighbouring mountains.\nAt first they had only understood the call to arms for general safety.\nBut when they learned that the daughter of a chief had been captured,\nthey simply went mad.  From something which the messenger first said, but\nwhich I could not catch or did not understand, the blow seemed to have\nfor them some sort of personal significance which wrought them to a\nfrenzy.\n\nWhen the bulk of the men had disappeared, I took with me a few of my own\nmen and several of the mountaineers whom I had asked to remain, and\ntogether we went to the hidden ravine which I knew.  We found the place\nempty; but there were unmistakable signs that a party of men had been\nencamped there for several days.  Some of our men, who were skilled in\nwoodcraft and in signs generally, agreed that there must have been some\ntwenty of them.  As they could not find any trail either coming to or\ngoing from the place, they came to the conclusion that they must have\ncome separately from different directions and gathered there, and that\nthey must have departed in something of the same mysterious way.\n\nHowever, this was, at any rate, some sort of a beginning, and the men\nseparated, having agreed amongst themselves to make a wide cast round the\nplace in the search for tracks.  Whoever should find a trail was to\nfollow with at least one comrade, and when there was any definite news,\nit was to be signalled to the Castle.\n\nI myself returned at once, and set the signallers to work to spread\namongst our own people such news as we had.\n\nWhen presently such discoveries as had been made were signalled with\nflags to the Castle, it was found that the marauders had, in their\nflight, followed a strangely zigzag course.  It was evident that, in\ntrying to baffle pursuit, they had tried to avoid places which they\nthought might be dangerous to them.  This may have been simply a method\nto disconcert pursuit.  If so, it was, in a measure, excellent, for none\nof those immediately following could possibly tell in what direction they\nwere heading.  It was only when we worked the course on the great map in\nthe signaller's room (which was the old guard room of the Castle) that we\ncould get an inkling of the general direction of their flight.  This gave\nadded trouble to the pursuit; for the men who followed, being ignorant of\ntheir general intent, could not ever take chance to head them off, but\nhad to be ready to follow in any or every direction.  In this manner the\npursuit was altogether a stern chase, and therefore bound to be a long\none.\n\nAs at present we could not do anything till the intended route was more\nmarked, I left the signalling corps to the task of receiving and giving\ninformation to the moving bands, so that, if occasion served, they might\nhead off the marauders.  I myself took Rooke, as captain of the yacht,\nand swept out of the creek.  We ran up north to Dalairi, then down south\nto Olesso, and came back to Vissarion.  We saw nothing suspicious except,\nfar off to the extreme southward, one warship which flew no flag.  Rooke,\nhowever, who seemed to know ships by instinct, said she was a Turk; so on\nour return we signalled along the whole shore to watch her.  Rooke held\nThe Lady--which was the name I had given the armoured yacht--in readiness\nto dart out in case anything suspicious was reported.  He was not to\nstand on any ceremony, but if necessary to attack.  We did not intend to\nlose a point in this desperate struggle which we had undertaken.  We had\nplaced in different likely spots a couple of our own men to look after\nthe signalling.\n\nWhen I got back I found that the route of the fugitives, who had now\njoined into one party, had been definitely ascertained.  They had gone\nsouth, but manifestly taking alarm from the advancing line of guards, had\nheaded up again to the north-east, where the country was broader and the\nmountains wilder and less inhabited.\n\nForthwith, leaving the signalling altogether in the hands of the fighting\npriests, I took a small chosen band of the mountaineers of our own\ndistrict, and made, with all the speed we could, to cut across the track\nof the fugitives a little ahead of them.  The Archimandrite (Abbot) of\nSpazac, who had just arrived, came with us.  He is a splendid man--a real\nfighter as well as a holy cleric, as good with his handjar as with his\nBible, and a runner to beat the band.  The marauders were going at a\nfearful pace, considering that they were all afoot; so we had to go fast\nalso!  Amongst these mountains there is no other means of progressing.\nOur own men were so aflame with ardour that I could not but notice that\nthey, more than any of the others whom I had seen, had some special cause\nfor concern.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to the Archimandrite, who moved by my side, he\nanswered:\n\n\"All natural enough; they are not only fighting for their country, but\nfor their own!\"  I did not quite understand his answer, and so began to\nask him some questions, to the effect that I soon began to understand a\ngood deal more than he did.\n\n_Letter from Archbishop Stevan Palealogue_, _Head of the Eastern Church\nof the Blue Mountains_, _to the Lady Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_.\n\n                                                   _Written July_ 9, 1907.\n\n    HONOURED LADY,\n\n    As you wish for an understanding regarding the late lamentable\n    occurrence in which so much danger was incurred to this our Land of\n    the Blue Mountains, and one dear to us, I send these words by request\n    of the Gospodar Rupert, beloved of our mountaineers.\n\n    When the Voivode Peter Vissarion made his journey to the great nation\n    to whom we looked in our hour of need, it was necessary that he\n    should go in secret.  The Turk was at our gates, and full of the\n    malice of baffled greed.  Already he had tried to arrange a marriage\n    with the Voivodin, so that in time to come he, as her husband, might\n    have established a claim to the inheritance of the land.  Well he\n    knew, as do all men, that the Blue Mountaineers owe allegiance to\n    none that they themselves do not appoint to rulership.  This has been\n    the history in the past.  But now and again an individual has arisen\n    or come to the front adapted personally for such government as this\n    land requires.  And so the Lady Teuta, Voivodin of the Blue\n    Mountains, was put for her proper guarding in the charge of myself as\n    Head of the Eastern Church in the Land of the Blue Mountains, steps\n    being taken in such wise that no capture of her could be effected by\n    unscrupulous enemies of this our Land.  This task and guardianship\n    was gladly held as an honour by all concerned.  For the Voivodin\n    Teuta of Vissarion must be taken as representing in her own person\n    the glory of the old Serb race, inasmuch as being the only child of\n    the Voivode Vissarion, last male of his princely race--the race which\n    ever, during the ten centuries of our history, unflinchingly gave\n    life and all they held for the protection, safety, and well-being of\n    the Land of the Blue Mountains.  Never during those centuries had any\n    one of the race been known to fail in patriotism, or to draw back\n    from any loss or hardship enjoined by high duty or stress of need.\n    Moreover, this was the race of that first Voivode Vissarion, of whom,\n    in legend, it was prophesied that he--once known as \"The Sword of\n    Freedom,\" a giant amongst men--would some day, when the nation had\n    need of him, come forth from his water-tomb in the lost Lake of Reo,\n    and lead once more the men of the Blue Mountains to lasting victory.\n    This noble race, then, had come to be known as the last hope of the\n    Land.  So that when the Voivode was away on his country's service,\n    his daughter should be closely guarded.  Soon after the Voivode had\n    gone, it was reported that he might be long delayed in his\n    diplomacies, and also in studying the system of Constitutional\n    Monarchy, for which it had been hoped to exchange our imperfect\n    political system.  I may say _inter alia_ that he was mentioned as to\n    be the first king when the new constitution should have been\n    arranged.\n\n    Then a great misfortune came on us; a terrible grief overshadowed the\n    land.  After a short illness, the Voivodin Teuta Vissarion died\n    mysteriously of a mysterious ailment.  The grief of the mountaineers\n    was so great that it became necessary for the governing Council to\n    warn them not to allow their sorrow to be seen.  It was imperatively\n    necessary that the fact of her death should be kept secret.  For\n    there were dangers and difficulties of several kinds.  In the first\n    place it was advisable that even her father should be kept in\n    ignorance of his terrible loss.  It was well known that he held her\n    as the very core of his heart and that if he should hear of her\n    death, he would be too much prostrated to be able to do the intricate\n    and delicate work which he had undertaken.  Nay, more: he would never\n    remain afar off, under the sad circumstances, but would straightway\n    return, so as to be in the land where she lay.  Then suspicions would\n    crop up, and the truth must shortly be known afield, with the\n    inevitable result that the Land would become the very centre of a war\n    of many nations.\n\n    In the second place, if the Turks were to know that the race of\n    Vissarion was becoming extinct, this would encourage them to further\n    aggression, which would become immediate should they find out that\n    the Voivode was himself away.  It was well known that they were\n    already only suspending hostilities until a fitting opportunity\n    should arise.  Their desire for aggression had become acute after the\n    refusal of the nation, and of the girl herself, that she should\n    become a wife of the Sultan.\n\n    The dead girl had been buried in the Crypt of the church of St. Sava,\n    and day after day and night after night, singly and in parties, the\n    sorrowing mountaineers had come to pay devotion and reverence at her\n    tomb.  So many had wished to have a last glimpse of her face that the\n    Vladika had, with my own consent as Archbishop, arranged for a glass\n    cover to be put over the stone coffin wherein her body lay.\n\n    After a little time, however, there came a belief to all concerned in\n    the guarding of the body--these, of course, being the priests of\n    various degrees of dignity appointed to the task--that the Voivodin\n    was not really dead, but only in a strangely-prolonged trance.\n    Thereupon a new complication arose.  Our mountaineers are, as perhaps\n    you know, by nature deeply suspicious--a characteristic of all brave\n    and self-sacrificing people who are jealous of their noble heritage.\n    Having, as they believed, seen the girl dead, they might not be\n    willing to accept the fact of her being alive.  They might even\n    imagine that there was on foot some deep, dark plot which was, or\n    might be, a menace, now or hereafter, to their independence.  In any\n    case, there would be certain to be two parties on the subject, a\n    dangerous and deplorable thing in the present condition of affairs.\n\n    As the trance, or catalepsy, whatever it was, continued for many\n    days, there had been ample time for the leaders of the Council, the\n    Vladika, the priesthood represented by the Archimandrite of Spazac,\n    myself as Archbishop and guardian of the Voivodin in her father's\n    absence, to consult as to a policy to be observed in case of the girl\n    awaking.  For in such case the difficulty of the situation would be\n    multiplied indefinitely.  In the secret chambers of St. Sava's we had\n    many secret meetings, and were finally converging on agreement when\n    the end of the trance came.\n\n    The girl awoke!\n\n    She was, of course, terribly frightened when she found herself in a\n    tomb in the Crypt.  It was truly fortunate that the great candles\n    around her tomb had been kept lighted, for their light mitigated the\n    horror of the place.  Had she waked in darkness, her reason might\n    have become unseated.\n\n    She was, however, a very noble girl; brave, with extraordinary will,\n    and resolution, and self-command, and power of endurance.  When she\n    had been taken into one of the secret chambers of the church, where\n    she was warmed and cared for, a hurried meeting was held by the\n    Vladika, myself, and the chiefs of the National Council.  Word had\n    been at once sent to me of the joyful news of her recovery; and with\n    the utmost haste I came, arriving in time to take a part in the\n    Council.\n\n    At the meeting the Voivodin was herself present, and full confidence\n    of the situation was made to her.  She herself proposed that the\n    belief in her death should be allowed to prevail until the return of\n    her father, when all could be effectively made clear.  To this end\n    she undertook to submit to the terrific strain which such a\n    proceeding would involve.  At first we men could not believe that any\n    woman could go through with such a task, and some of us did not\n    hesitate to voice our doubts--our disbelief.  But she stood to her\n    guns, and actually down-faced us.  At the last we, remembering things\n    that had been done, though long ages ago, by others of her race, came\n    to believe not merely in her self-belief and intention, but even in\n    the feasibility of her plan.  She took the most solemn oaths not to\n    betray the secret under any possible stress.\n\n    The priesthood undertook through the Vladika and myself to further a\n    ghostly belief amongst the mountaineers which would tend to prevent a\n    too close or too persistent observation.  The Vampire legend was\n    spread as a protection against partial discovery by any mischance,\n    and other weird beliefs were set afoot and fostered.  Arrangements\n    were made that only on certain days were the mountaineers to be\n    admitted to the Crypt, she agreeing that for these occasions she was\n    to take opiates or carry out any other aid to the preservation of the\n    secret.  She was willing, she impressed upon us, to make any personal\n    sacrifice which might be deemed necessary for the carrying out her\n    father's task for the good of the nation.\n\n    Of course, she had at first terrible frights lying alone in the\n    horror of the Crypt.  But after a time the terrors of the situation,\n    if they did not cease, were mitigated.  There are secret caverns off\n    the Crypt, wherein in troublous times the priests and others of high\n    place have found safe retreat.  One of these was prepared for the\n    Voivodin, and there she remained, except for such times as she was on\n    show--and certain other times of which I shall tell you.  Provision\n    was made for the possibility of any accidental visit to the church.\n    At such times, warned by an automatic signal from the opening door,\n    she was to take her place in the tomb.  The mechanism was so arranged\n    that the means to replace the glass cover, and to take the opiate,\n    were there ready to her hand.  There was to be always a watch of\n    priests at night in the church, to guard her from ghostly fears as\n    well as from more physical dangers; and if she was actually in her\n    tomb, it was to be visited at certain intervals.  Even the draperies\n    which covered her in the sarcophagus were rested on a bridge placed\n    from side to side just above her, so as to hide the rising and\n    falling of her bosom as she slept under the narcotic.\n\n    After a while the prolonged strain began to tell so much on her that\n    it was decided that she should take now and again exercise out of\n    doors.  This was not difficult, for when the Vampire story which we\n    had spread began to be widely known, her being seen would be accepted\n    as a proof of its truth.  Still, as there was a certain danger in her\n    being seen at all, we thought it necessary to exact from her a solemn\n    oath that so long as her sad task lasted she should under no\n    circumstances ever wear any dress but her shroud--this being the only\n    way to insure secrecy and to prevail against accident.\n\n    There is a secret way from the Crypt to a sea cavern, whose entrance\n    is at high-tide under the water-line at the base of the cliff on\n    which the church is built.  A boat, shaped like a coffin, was\n    provided for her; and in this she was accustomed to pass across the\n    creek whenever she wished to make excursion.  It was an excellent\n    device, and most efficacious in disseminating the Vampire belief.\n\n    This state of things had now lasted from before the time when the\n    Gospodar Rupert came to Vissarion up to the day of the arrival of the\n    armoured yacht.\n\n    That night the priest on duty, on going his round of the Crypt just\n    before dawn, found the tomb empty.  He called the others, and they\n    made full search.  The boat was gone from the cavern, but on making\n    search they found it on the farther side of the creek, close to the\n    garden stairs.  Beyond this they could discover nothing.  She seemed\n    to have disappeared without leaving a trace.\n\n    Straightway they went to the Vladika, and signalled to me by the\n    fire-signal at the monastery at Astrag, where I then was.  I took a\n    band of mountaineers with me, and set out to scour the country.  But\n    before going I sent an urgent message to the Gospodar Rupert, asking\n    him, who showed so much interest and love to our Land, to help us in\n    our trouble.  He, of course, knew nothing then of all have now told\n    you.  Nevertheless, he devoted himself whole-heartedly to our\n    needs--as doubtless you know.\n\n    But the time had now come close when the Voivode Vissarion was about\n    to return from his mission; and we of the council of his daughter's\n    guardianship were beginning to arrange matters so that at his return\n    the good news of her being still alive could be made public.  With\n    her father present to vouch for her, no question as to truth could\n    arise.\n\n    But by some means the Turkish \"Bureau of Spies\" must have got\n    knowledge of the fact already.  To steal a dead body for the purpose\n    of later establishing a fictitious claim would have been an\n    enterprise even more desperate than that already undertaken.  We\n    inferred from many signs, made known to us in an investigation, that\n    a daring party of the Sultan's emissaries had made a secret incursion\n    with the object of kidnapping the Voivodin.  They must have been bold\n    of heart and strong of resource to enter the Land of the Blue\n    Mountains on any errand, let alone such a desperate one as this.  For\n    centuries we have been teaching the Turk through bitter lessons that\n    it is neither a safe task nor an easy one to make incursion here.\n\n    How they did it we know not--at present; but enter they did, and,\n    after waiting in some secret hiding-place for a favourable\n    opportunity, secured their prey.  We know not even now whether they\n    had found entrance to the Crypt and stole, as they thought, the dead\n    body, or whether, by some dire mischance, they found her\n    abroad--under her disguise as a ghost.  At any rate, they had\n    captured her, and through devious ways amongst the mountains were\n    bearing her back to Turkey.  It was manifest that when she was on\n    Turkish soil the Sultan would force a marriage on her so as\n    eventually to secure for himself or his successors as against all\n    other nations a claim for the suzerainty or guardianship of the Blue\n    Mountains.\n\n    Such was the state of affairs when the Gospodar Rupert threw himself\n    into the pursuit with fiery zeal and the Berserk passion which he\n    inherited from Viking ancestors, whence of old came \"The Sword of\n    Freedom\" himself.\n\n    But at that very time was another possibility which the Gospodar was\n    himself the first to realize.  Failing the getting the Voivodin safe\n    to Turkish soil, the ravishers might kill her!  This would be\n    entirely in accord with the base traditions and history of the\n    Moslems.  So, too, it would accord with Turkish customs and the\n    Sultan's present desires.  It would, in its way, benefit the ultimate\n    strategetic ends of Turkey.  For were once the Vissarion race at an\n    end, the subjection of the Land of the Blue Mountains might, in their\n    view, be an easier task than it had yet been found to be.\n\n    Such, illustrious lady, were the conditions of affairs when the\n    Gospodar Rupert first drew his handjar for the Blue Mountains and\n    what it held most dear.\n\n                                                               PALEALOGUE,\n              _Archbishop of the Eastern Church_, _in the Land of the Blue\n                                                               Mountains_.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.\n\nI wonder if ever in the long, strange history of the world had there come\nto any other such glad tidings as came to me--and even then rather\ninferentially than directly--from the Archimandrite's answers to my\nquestioning.  Happily I was able to restrain myself, or I should have\ncreated some strange confusion which might have evoked distrust, and\nwould certainly have hampered us in our pursuit.  For a little I could\nhardly accept the truth which wove itself through my brain as the true\ninwardness of each fact came home to me and took its place in the whole\nfabric.  But even the most welcome truth has to be accepted some time by\neven a doubting heart.  My heart, whatever it may have been, was not then\na doubting heart, but a very, very grateful one.  It was only the\nsplendid magnitude of the truth which forbade its immediate acceptance.\nI could have shouted for joy, and only stilled myself by keeping my\nthoughts fixed on the danger which my wife was in.  My wife!  My wife!\nNot a Vampire; not a poor harassed creature doomed to terrible woe, but a\nsplendid woman, brave beyond belief, patriotic in a way which has but few\npeers even in the wide history of bravery!  I began to understand the\ntrue meaning of the strange occurrences that have come into my life.\nEven the origin and purpose of that first strange visit to my room became\nclear.  No wonder that the girl could move about the Castle in so\nmysterious a manner.  She had lived there all her life, and was familiar\nwith the secret ways of entrance and exit.  I had always believed that\nthe place must have been honeycombed with secret passages.  No wonder\nthat she could find a way to the battlements, mysterious to everybody\nelse.  No wonder that she could meet me at the Flagstaff when she so\ndesired.\n\nTo say that I was in a tumult would be to but faintly express my\ncondition.  I was rapt into a heaven of delight which had no measure in\nall my adventurous life--the lifting of the veil which showed that my\nwife--mine--won in all sincerity in the very teeth of appalling\ndifficulties and dangers--was no Vampire, no corpse, no ghost or phantom,\nbut a real woman of flesh and blood, of affection, and love, and passion.\nNow at last would my love be crowned indeed when, having rescued her from\nthe marauders, I should bear her to my own home, where she would live and\nreign in peace and comfort and honour, and in love and wifely happiness\nif I could achieve such a blessing for her--and for myself.\n\nBut here a dreadful thought flashed across me, which in an instant turned\nmy joy to despair, my throbbing heart to ice:\n\n\"As she is a real woman, she is in greater danger than ever in the hands\nof Turkish ruffians.  To them a woman is in any case no more than a\nsheep; and if they cannot bring her to the harem of the Sultan, they may\ndeem it the next wisest step to kill her.  In that way, too, they might\nfind a better chance of escape.  Once rid of her the party could\nseparate, and there might be a chance of some of them finding escape as\nindividuals that would not exist for a party.  But even if they did not\nkill her, to escape with her would be to condemn her to the worst fate of\nall the harem of the Turk!  Lifelong misery and despair--however long\nthat life might be--must be the lot of a Christian woman doomed to such a\nlot.  And to her, just happily wedded, and after she had served her\ncountry in such a noble way as she had done, that dreadful life of\nshameful slavery would be a misery beyond belief.\n\n\"She must be rescued--and quickly!  The marauders must be caught soon,\nand suddenly, so that they may have neither time nor opportunity to harm\nher, as they would be certain to do if they have warning of immediate\ndanger.\n\n\"On! on!\"\n\nAnd \"on\" it was all through that terrible night as well as we could\nthrough the forest.\n\nIt was a race between the mountaineers and myself as to who should be\nfirst.  I understood now the feeling that animated them, and which\nsingled them out even from amongst their fiery comrades, when the danger\nof the Voivodin became known.  These men were no mean contestants even in\nsuch a race, and, strong as I am, it took my utmost effort to keep ahead\nof them.  They were keen as leopards, and as swift.  Their lives had been\nspent among the mountains, and their hearts and souls on were in the\nchase.  I doubt not that if the death of any one of us could have through\nany means effected my wife's release, we should, if necessary, have\nfought amongst ourselves for the honour.\n\nFrom the nature of the work before us our party had to keep to the top of\nthe hills.  We had not only to keep observation on the flying party whom\nwe followed, and to prevent them making discovery of us, but we had to be\nalways in a position to receive and answer signals made to us from the\nCastle, or sent to us from other eminences.\n\n_Letter from Petrof Vlastimir_, _Archimandrite of Spazac_, _to the Lady\nJanet MacKelpie_, _of Vissarion_.\n\n                                                   _Written July_ 8, 1907.\n\n    GREAT LADY,\n\n    I am asked to write by the Vladika, and have permission of the\n    Archbishop.  I have the honour of transmitting to you the record of\n    the pursuit of the Turkish spies who carried off the Voivodin Teuta,\n    of the noble House of Vissarion.  The pursuit was undertaken by the\n    Gospodar Rupert, who asked that I would come with his party, since\n    what he was so good as to call my \"great knowledge of the country and\n    its people\" might serve much.  It is true that I have had much\n    knowledge of the Land of the Blue Mountains and its people, amongst\n    which and whom my whole life has been passed.  But in such a cause no\n    reason was required.  There was not a man in the Blue Mountains who\n    would not have given his life for the Voivodin Teuta, and when they\n    heard that she had not been dead, as they thought, but only in a\n    trance, and that it was she whom the marauders had carried off, they\n    were in a frenzy.  So why should I--to whom has been given the great\n    trust of the Monastery of Spazac--hesitate at such a time?  For\n    myself, I wanted to hurry on, and to come at once to the fight with\n    my country's foes; and well I knew that the Gospodar Rupert, with a\n    lion's heart meet for his giant body, would press on with a matchless\n    speed.  We of the Blue Mountains do not lag when our foes are in\n    front of us; most of all do we of the Eastern Church press on when\n    the Crescent wars against the Cross!\n\n    We took with us no gear or hamper of any kind; no coverings except\n    what we stood in; no food--nothing but our handjars and our rifles,\n    with a sufficiency of ammunition.  Before starting, the Gospodar gave\n    hurried orders by signal from the Castle to have food and ammunition\n    sent to us (as we might signal) by the nearest hamlet.\n\n    It was high noon when we started, only ten strong--for our leader\n    would take none but approved runners who could shoot straight and use\n    the handjar as it should be used.  So as we went light, we expected\n    to go fast.  By this time we knew from the reports signalled to\n    Vissarion that the enemies were chosen men of no despicable prowess.\n\n    The Keeper of the Green Flag of Islam is well served, and as though\n    the Turk is an infidel and a dog, he is sometimes brave and strong.\n    Indeed, except when he passes the confines of the Blue Mountains, he\n    has been known to do stirring deeds.  But as none who have dared to\n    wander in amongst our hills ever return to their own land, we may not\n    know of how they speak at home of their battles here.  Still, these\n    men were evidently not to be despised; and our Gospodar, who is a\n    wise man as well as a valiant, warned us to be prudent, and not to\n    despise our foes over much.  We did as he counselled, and in proof we\n    only took ten men, as we had only twenty against us.  But then there\n    was at stake much beyond life, and we took no risks.  So, as the\n    great clock at Vissarion clanged of noon, the eight fastest runners\n    of the Blue Mountains, together with the Gospodar Rupert and myself,\n    swept out on our journey.  It had been signalled to us that the\n    course which the marauders had as yet taken in their flight was a\n    zigzag one, running eccentrically at all sorts of angles in all sorts\n    of directions.  But our leader had marked out a course where we might\n    intercept our foes across the main line of their flight; and till we\n    had reached that region we paused not a second, but went as fast as\n    we could all night long.  Indeed, it was amongst us a race as was the\n    Olympic race of old Greece, each one vying with his fellows, though\n    not in jealous emulation, but in high spirit, to best serve his\n    country and the Voivodin Teuta.  Foremost amongst us went the\n    Gospodar, bearing himself as a Paladin of old, his mighty form\n    pausing for no obstacle.  Perpetually did he urge us on.  He would\n    not stop or pause for a moment, but often as he and I ran\n    together--for, lady, in my youth I was the fleetest of all in the\n    race, and even that now can head a battalion when duty calls--he\n    would ask me certain questions as to the Lady Teuta and of the\n    strange manner of her reputed death, as it was gradually unfolded in\n    my answers to his questioning.  And as each new phase of knowledge\n    came to him, he would rush on as one possessed of fiends: whereat our\n    mountaineers, who seem to respect even fiends for their thoroughness,\n    would strive to keep pace with him till they too seemed worked into\n    diabolic possession.  And I myself, left alone in the calmness of\n    sacerdotal office, forgot even that.  With surging ears and eyes that\n    saw blood, I rushed along with best of them.\n\n    Then truly the spirit of a great captain showed itself in the\n    Gospodar, for when others were charged with fury he began to force\n    himself into calm, so that out of his present self-command and the\n    memory of his exalted position came a worthy strategy and thought for\n    every contingency that might arise.  So that when some new direction\n    was required for our guidance, there was no hesitation in its coming.\n    We, nine men of varying kinds, all felt that we had a master; and so,\n    being willing to limit ourselves to strict obedience, we were free to\n    use such thoughts as well as such powers as we had to the best\n    advantage of the doing.\n\n    We came across the trail of the flying marauders on the second\n    morning after the abduction, a little before noon.  It was easy\n    enough to see, for by this time the miscreants were all together, and\n    our people, who were woodlanders, were able to tell much of the party\n    that passed.  These were evidently in a terrified hurry, for they had\n    taken no precautions such as are necessary baffle pursuit, and all of\n    which take time.  Our foresters said that two went ahead and two\n    behind.  In the centre went the mass, moving close together, as\n    though surrounding their prisoner.  We caught not even a single\n    glimpse her--could not have, they encompassed her so closely.  But\n    our foresters saw other than the mass; the ground that had been\n    passed was before them.  They knew that the prisoner had gone\n    unwillingly--nay, more: one of them said as he rose from his knees,\n    where he had been examining of the ground:\n\n    \"The misbegotten dogs have been urging her on with their yataghans!\n    There are drops of blood, though there are no blood-marks on her\n    feet.\"\n\n    Whereupon the Gospodar flamed with passion.  His teeth ground\n    together, and with a deep-breathed \"On, on!\" he sprang off again,\n    handjar in hand, on the track.\n\n    Before long we saw the party in the distance.  They this were far\n    below us in a deep valley, although the track of their going passed\n    away to the right hand.  They were making for the base of the great\n    cliff, which rose before us all.  Their reason was twofold, as we\n    soon knew.  Far off down the valley which they were crossing we saw\n    signs of persons coming in haste, who must be of the search party\n    coming from the north.  Though the trees hid them, we could not\n    mistake the signs.  I was myself forester enough to have no doubt.\n    Again, it was evident that the young Voivodin could travel no longer\n    at the dreadful pace at which they had been going.  Those blood-marks\n    told their own tale!  They meant to make a last stand here in case\n    they should be discovered.\n\n    Then it was that he, who amongst us all had been most fierce and most\n    bent on rapid pursuit, became the most the calm.  Raising his hand\n    for silence--though, God knows, we were and had been silent enough\n    during that long rush through the forest--he said, in a low, keen\n    whisper which cut the silence like a knife:\n\n    \"My friends, the time is come for action.  God be thanked, who has\n    now brought us face to face with our foes!  But we must be careful\n    here--not on our own account, for we wish nothing more than to rush\n    on and conquer or die--but for the sake of her whom you love, and\n    whom I, too, love.  She is in danger from anything which may give\n    warning to those fiends.  If they know or even suspect for an instant\n    that we are near, they will murder her . . . \"\n\n    Here his voice broke for an instant with the extremity of his passion\n    or the depth of his feeling--I hardly know which; I think both acted\n    on him.\n\n    \"We know from those blood-marks what they can do--even to her.\"  His\n    teeth ground together again, but he went on without stopping further:\n\n    \"Let us arrange the battle.  Though we are but little distance from\n    them as the crow flies, the way is far to travel.  There is, I can\n    see, but one path down to the valley from this side.  That they have\n    gone by, and that they will sure to guard--to watch, at any rate.\n    Let us divide, as to surround them.  The cliff towards which they\n    make runs far to the left without a break.  That to the right we\n    cannot see from this spot; but from the nature of the ground it is\n    not unlikely that it turns round in this direction, making the hither\n    end of the valley like a vast pocket or amphitheatre.  As they have\n    studied the ground in other places, they may have done so in this,\n    and have come hither as to a known refuge.  Let one man, a marksman,\n    stay here.\"\n\n    As he spoke a man stepped to the front.  He was, I knew, an excellent\n    shot.\n\n    \"Let two others go to the left and try to find a way down the cliff\n    before us.  When they have descended to the level of the valley--path\n    or no path--let them advance cautiously and secretly, keeping their\n    guns in readiness.  But they must not fire till need.  Remember, my\n    brothers,\" said, turning to those who stepped out a pace or two to\n    the left, \"that the first shot gives the warning which will be the\n    signal for the Voivodin's death.  These men will not hesitate.  You\n    must judge yourselves of the time to shoot.  The others of us will\n    move to the right and try to find a path on that side.  If the valley\n    be indeed a pocket between the cliffs, we must find a way down that\n    is not a path!\"\n\n    As he spoke thus there was a blaze in his eyes that betokened no good\n    to aught that might stand in his way.  I ran by his side as we moved\n    to the right.\n\n    It was as he surmised about the cliff.  When we got a little on our\n    way we saw how the rocky formation trended to our right, till,\n    finally, with a wide curve, it came round to the other side.\n\n    It was a fearful valley that, with its narrow girth and its towering\n    walls that seemed to topple over.  On the farther side from us the\n    great trees that clothed the slope of the mountain over it grew down\n    to the very edge of the rock, so that their spreading branches hung\n    far over the chasm.  And, so far as we could understand, the same\n    condition existed on our own side.  Below us the valley was dark even\n    in the daylight.  We could best tell the movement of the flying\n    marauders by the flashes of the white shroud of their captive in the\n    midst of them.\n\n    From where we were grouped, amid the great tree-trunks on the very\n    brow of the cliff, we could, when our eyes were accustomed to the\n    shadow, see them quite well.  In great haste, and half dragging, half\n    carrying the Voivodin, they crossed the open space and took refuge in\n    a little grassy alcove surrounded, save for its tortuous entrance, by\n    undergrowth.  From the valley level it was manifestly impossible to\n    see them, though we from our altitude could see over the stunted\n    undergrowth.  When within the glade, they took their hands from her.\n    She, shuddering instinctively, withdrew to a remote corner of the\n    dell.\n\n    And then, oh, shame on their manhood!--Turks and heathens though they\n    were--we could see that they had submitted her to the indignity of\n    gagging her and binding her hands!\n\n    Our Voivodin Teuta bound!  To one and all of us it was like lashing\n    us across the face.  I heard the Gospodar's teeth grind again.  But\n    once more he schooled himself to calmness ere he said:\n\n    \"It is, perhaps, as well, great though the indignity be.  They are\n    seeking their own doom, which is coming quickly . . . Moreover, they\n    are thwarting their own base plans.  Now that she is bound they will\n    trust to their binding, so that they will delay their murderous\n    alternative to the very last moment.  Such is our chance of rescuing\n    her alive!\"\n\n    For a few moments he stood as still as a stone, as though revolving\n    something in his mind whilst he watched.  I could see that some grim\n    resolution was forming in his mind, for his eyes ranged to the top of\n    the trees above cliff, and down again, very slowly this time, as\n    though measuring and studying the detail of what was in front of him.\n    Then he spoke:\n\n    \"They are in hopes that the other pursuing party may not come across\n    them.  To know that, they are waiting.  If those others do not come\n    up the valley, they will proceed on their way.  They will return up\n    the path the way they came.  There we can wait them, charge into the\n    middle of them when she is opposite, and cut down those around her.\n    Then the others will open fire, and we shall be rid of them!\n\n    Whilst he was speaking, two of the men of our party, who I knew to be\n    good sharpshooters, and who had just before lain on their faces and\n    had steadied their rifles to shoot, rose to their feet.\n\n    \"Command us, Gospodar!\" they said simply, as they stood to attention.\n    \"Shall we go to the head of the ravine road and there take hiding?\"\n    He thought for perhaps a minute, whilst we all stood as silent as\n    images.  I could hear our hearts beating.  Then he said:\n\n    \"No, not yet.  There is time for that yet.  They will not--cannot\n    stir or make plans in any way till they know whether the other party\n    is coming towards them or not.  From our height here we can see what\n    course the others are taking long before those villains do.  Then we\n    can make our plans and be ready in time.\"\n\n    We waited many minutes, but could see no further signs the other\n    pursuing party.  These had evidently adopted greater caution in their\n    movements as they came closer to where they expected to find the\n    enemy.  The marauders began to grow anxious.  Even at our distance we\n    could gather as much from their attitude and movements.\n\n    Presently, when the suspense of their ignorance grew too much for\n    them, they drew to the entrance of the glade, which was the farthest\n    place to which, without exposing themselves to anyone who might come\n    to the valley, they could withdraw from their captive.  Here they\n    consulted together.  We could follow from their gestures what they\n    were saying, for as they did not wish their prisoner to hear, their\n    gesticulation was enlightening to us as to each other.  Our people,\n    like all mountaineers, have good eyes, and the Gospodar is himself an\n    eagle in this as in other ways.  Three men stood back from the rest.\n    They stacked their rifles so that they could seize them easily.  Then\n    they drew their scimitars, and stood ready, as though on guard.\n\n    These were evidently the appointed murderers.  Well they knew their\n    work; for though they stood in a desert place with none within long\n    distance except the pursuing party, of whose approach they would have\n    good notice, they stood so close to their prisoner that no marksman\n    in the world--now or that ever had been; not William Tell\n    himself--could have harmed any of them without at least endangering\n    her.  Two of them turned the Voivodin round so that her face was\n    towards the precipice--in which position she could not see what was\n    going on--whilst he who was evidently leader of the gang explained,\n    in gesture, that the others were going to spy upon the pursuing\n    party.  When they had located them he, or one of his men, would come\n    out of the opening of the wood wherein they had had evidence of them,\n    and hold up his hand.\n\n    That was to be the signal for the cutting of the victim's\n    throat--such being the chosen method (villainous even for heathen\n    murderers) of her death.  There was not one of our men who did not\n    grind his teeth when we witnessed the grim action, only too\n    expressive, of the Turk as he drew his right hand, clenched as though\n    he held a yataghan in it, across his throat.\n\n    At the opening of the glade all the spying party halted whilst the\n    leader appointed to each his place of entry of the wood, the front of\n    which extended in an almost straight across the valley from cliff to\n    cliff.\n\n    The men, stooping low when in the open, and taking instant advantage\n    of every little obstacle on the ground, seemed to fade like spectres\n    with incredible swiftness across the level mead, and were swallowed\n    up in the wood.\n\n    When they had disappeared the Gospodar Rupert revealed to us the\n    details of the plan of action which he had revolving in his mind.  He\n    motioned us to follow him: we threaded a way between the tree-trunks,\n    keeping all the while on the very edge of the cliff, so that the\n    space below was all visible to us.  When we had got round the curve\n    sufficiently to see the whole of the wood on the valley level,\n    without losing sight of the Voivodin and her appointed assassins, we\n    halted under his direction.  There was an added advantage of this\n    point over the other, for we could see directly the rising of the\n    hill-road, up which farther side ran the continuation of the mountain\n    path which the marauders had followed.  It was somewhere on that path\n    that the other pursuing party had hoped to intercept the fugitives.\n    The Gospodar spoke quickly, though in a voice of command which true\n    soldiers love to hear:\n\n    \"Brothers, the time has come when we can strike a blow for Teuta and\n    the Land.  Do you two, marksmen, take position here facing the wood.\"\n    The two men here lay down and got their rifles ready.  \"Divide the\n    frontage of the wood between you; arrange between yourselves the\n    limits of your positions.  The very instant one of the marauders\n    appears, cover him; drop him before he emerges from the wood.  Even\n    then still watch and treat similarly whoever else may take his place.\n    Do this if they come singly till not a man is left.  Remember,\n    brothers, that brave hearts alone will not suffice at this grim\n    crisis.  In this hour the best safety of the Voivodin is in the calm\n    spirit and the steady eye!\"  Then he turned to the rest of us, and\n    spoke to me:\n\n    \"Archimandrite of Plazac, you who are interpreter to God of the\n    prayers of so many souls, my own hour has come.  If I do not return,\n    convey my love to my Aunt Janet--Miss MacKelpie, at Vissarion.  There\n    is but one thing left to us if we wish to save the Voivodin.  Do you,\n    when the time comes, take these men and join the watcher at the top\n    of the ravine road.  When the shots are fired, do you out handjar,\n    and rush the ravine and across the valley.  Brothers, you may be in\n    time to avenge the Voivodin, if you cannot save her.  For me there\n    must be a quicker way, and to it I go.  As there is not, and will not\n    be, time to traverse the path, I must take a quicker way.  Nature\n    finds me a path that man has made it necessary for me to travel.  See\n    that giant beech-tree that towers above the glade where the Voivodin\n    is held?  There is my path!  When you from here have marked the\n    return of the spies, give me a signal with your hat--do not use a\n    handkerchief, as others might see its white, and take warning.  Then\n    rush that ravine.  I shall take that as the signal for my descent by\n    the leafy road.  If I can do naught else, I can crush the murderers\n    with my falling weight, even if I have to kill her too.  At least we\n    shall die together--and free.  Lay us together in the tomb at St.\n    Sava's.  Farewell, if it be the last!\"\n\n    He threw down the scabbard in which he carried his handjar, adjusted\n    the naked weapon in his belt behind his back, and was gone!\n\n    We who were not watching the wood kept our eyes fixed on the great\n    beech-tree, and with new interest noticed the long trailing branches\n    which hung low, and swayed even in the gentle breeze.  For a few\n    minutes, which seemed amazingly long, we saw no sign of him.  Then,\n    high up on one of the great branches which stood clear of obscuring\n    leaves, we saw something crawling flat against the bark.  He was well\n    out on the branch, hanging far over the precipice.  He was looking\n    over at us, and I waved my hand so that he should know we saw him.\n    He was clad in green--his usual forest dress--so that there was not\n    any likelihood of any other eyes noticing him.  I took off my hat,\n    and held it ready to signal with when the time should come.  I\n    glanced down at the glade and saw the Voivodin standing, still safe,\n    with her guards so close to her as to touch.  Then I, too, fixed my\n    eyes on the wood.\n\n    Suddenly the man standing beside me seized my arm and pointed.  I\n    could just see through the trees, which were lower than elsewhere in\n    the front of the wood, a Turk moving stealthily; so I waved my hat.\n    At the same time a rifle underneath me cracked.  A second or two\n    later the spy pitched forward on his face and lay still.  At the same\n    instant my eyes sought the beech-tree, and I saw the close-lying\n    figure raise itself and slide forward to a joint of the branch.  Then\n    the Gospodar, as he rose, hurled himself forward amid the mass of the\n    trailing branches.  He dropped like a stone, and my heart sank.\n\n    But an instant later he seemed in poise.  He had clutched the thin,\n    trailing branches as he fell; and as he sank a number of leaves which\n    his motion had torn off floated out round him.\n\n    Again the rifle below me cracked, and then again, and again, and\n    again.  The marauders had taken warning, and were coming out in mass.\n    But my own eyes were fixed on the tree.  Almost as a thunderbolt\n    falls fell the giant body of the Gospodar, his size lost in the\n    immensity of his surroundings.  He fell in a series of jerks, as he\n    kept clutching the trailing beech-branches whilst they lasted, and\n    then other lesser verdure growing out from the fissures in the rock\n    after the lengthening branches had with all their elasticity reached\n    their last point.\n\n    At length--for though this all took place in a very few seconds the\n    gravity of the crisis prolonged them immeasurably--there came a large\n    space of rock some three times his own length.  He did not pause, but\n    swung himself to one side, so that he should fall close to the\n    Voivodin and her guards.  These men did not seem to notice, for their\n    attention was fixed on the wood whence they expected their messenger\n    to signal.  But they raised their yataghans in readiness.  The shots\n    had alarmed them; and they meant to do the murder now--messenger or\n    no messenger\n\n    But though the men did not see the danger from above, the Voivodin\n    did.  She raised her eyes quickly at the first sound, and even from\n    where we were, before we began to run towards the ravine path, I\n    could see the triumphant look in her glorious eyes when she\n    recognized the identity of the man who was seemingly coming straight\n    down from Heaven itself to help her--as, indeed, she, and we too, can\n    very well imagine that he did; for if ever heaven had a hand in a\n    rescue on earth, it was now.\n\n    Even during the last drop from the rocky foliage the Gospodar kept\n    his head.  As he fell he pulled his handjar free, and almost as he\n    was falling its sweep took off the head of one of the assassins.  As\n    he touched ground he stumbled for an instant, but it was towards his\n    enemies.  Twice with lightning rapidity the handjar swept the air,\n    and at each sweep a head rolled on the sward.\n\n    The Voivodin held up her tied hands.  Again the handjar flashed, this\n    time downwards, and the lady was free.  Without an instant's pause\n    the Gospodar tore off the gag, and with his left arm round her and\n    handjar in right hand, stood face toward his living foes.  The\n    Voivodin stooped suddenly, and then, raising the yataghan which had\n    fallen from the hand of one of the dead marauders, stood armed beside\n    him.\n\n    The rifles were now cracking fast, as the marauders--those that were\n    left of them--came rushing out into the open.  But well the marksmen\n    knew their work.  Well they bore in mind the Gospodar's command\n    regarding calmness.  They kept picking off the foremost men only, so\n    that the onward rush never seemed to get more forward.\n\n    As we rushed down the ravine we could see clearly all before us.  But\n    now, just as we were beginning to fear lest some mischance might\n    allow some of them to reach the glade, there was another cause of\n    surprise--of rejoicing.\n\n    From the face of the wood seemed to burst all at once a body of men,\n    all wearing the national cap, so we knew them as our own.  They were\n    all armed with the handjar only, and they came like tigers.  They\n    swept on the rushing Turks as though, for all their swiftness, they\n    were standing still--literally wiping them out as a child wipes a\n    lesson from its slate.\n\n    A few seconds later these were followed by a tall figure with long\n    hair and beard of black mingled with grey.  Instinctively we all, as\n    did those in the valley, shouted with joy.  For this was the Vladika\n    Milosh Plamenac himself.\n\n    I confess that, knowing what I knew, I was for a short space of time\n    anxious lest, in the terrific excitement in which we were all lapped,\n    someone might say or do something which might make for trouble later\n    on.  The Gospodar's splendid achievement, which was worthy of any\n    hero of old romance, had set us all on fire.  He himself must have\n    been wrought to a high pitch of excitement to dare such an act; and\n    it is not at such a time that discretion must be expected from any\n    man.  Most of all did I fear danger from the womanhood of the\n    Voivodin.  Had I not assisted at her marriage, I might not have\n    understood then what it must have been to her to be saved from such a\n    doom at such a time by such a man, who was so much to her, and in\n    such a way.  It would have been only natural if at such a moment of\n    gratitude and triumph she had proclaimed the secret which we of the\n    Council of the Nation and her father's Commissioners had so\n    religiously kept.  But none of us knew then either the Voivodin or\n    the Gospodar Rupert as we do now.  It was well that they were as they\n    are, for the jealousy and suspicion of our mountaineers might, even\n    at such a moment, and even whilst they throbbed at such a deed, have\n    so manifested themselves as to have left a legacy of distrust.  The\n    Vladika and I, who of all (save the two immediately concerned) alone\n    knew, looked at each other apprehensively.  But at that instant the\n    Voivodin, with a swift glance at her husband, laid a finger on her\n    lip; and he, with quick understanding, gave assurance by a similar\n    sign.  Then she sank before him on one knee, and, raising his hand to\n    her lips, kissed it, and spoke:\n\n    \"Gospodar Rupert, I owe you all that a woman may owe, except to God.\n    You have given me life and honour!  I cannot thank you adequately for\n    what you have done; my father will try to do so when he returns.  But\n    I am right sure that the men of the Blue Mountains, who so value\n    honour, and freedom, and liberty, and bravery, will hold you in their\n    hearts for ever!\"\n\n    This was so sweetly spoken, with lips that trembled and eyes that\n    swam in tears, so truly womanly and so in accord with the custom of\n    our nation regarding the reverence that women owe to men, that the\n    hearts of our mountaineers were touched to the quick.  Their noble\n    simplicity found expression in tears.  But if the gallant Gospodar\n    could have for a moment thought that so to weep was unmanly, his\n    error would have had instant correction.  When the Voivodin had risen\n    to her feet, which she did with queenly dignity, the men around\n    closed in on the Gospodar like a wave of the sea, and in a second\n    held him above their heads, tossing on their lifted hands as if on\n    stormy breakers.  It was as though the old Vikings of whom we have\n    heard, and whose blood flows in Rupert's veins, were choosing a chief\n    in old fashion.  I was myself glad that the men were so taken up with\n    the Gospodar that they did not see the glory of the moment in the\n    Voivodin's starry eyes; for else they might have guessed the secret.\n    I knew from the Vladika's look that he shared my own satisfaction,\n    even as he had shared my anxiety.\n\n    As the Gospodar Rupert was tossed high on the lifted hands of the\n    mountaineers, their shouts rose to such a sudden volume that around\n    us, as far as I could see, the frightened birds rose from the forest,\n    and their noisy alarm swelled the tumult.\n\n    The Gospodar, ever thoughtful for others, was the first to calm\n    himself.\n\n    \"Come, brothers,\" he said, \"let us gain the hilltop, where we can\n    signal to the Castle.  It is right that the whole nation should share\n    in the glad tidings that the Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion is free.\n    But before we go, let us remove the arms and clothing of these\n    carrion marauders.  We may have use for them later on.\"\n\n    The mountaineers set him down, gently enough.  And he, taking the\n    Voivodin by the hand, and calling the Vladika and myself close to\n    them, led the way up the ravine path which the marauders had\n    descended, and thence through the forest to the top of the hill that\n    dominated the valley.  Here we could, from an opening amongst the\n    trees, catch a glimpse far off of the battlements of Vissarion.\n    Forthwith the Gospodar signalled; and on the moment a reply of their\n    awaiting was given.  Then the Gospodar signalled the glad news.  It\n    was received with manifest rejoicing.  We could not hear any sound so\n    far away, but we could see the movement of lifted faces and waving\n    hands, and knew that it was well.  But an instant after came a calm\n    so dread that we knew before the semaphore had begun to work that\n    there was bad news in store for us.  When the news did come, a bitter\n    wailing arose amongst us; for the news that was signalled ran:\n\n    \"The Voivode has been captured by the Turks on his return, and is\n    held by them at Ilsin.\"\n\n    In an instant the temper of the mountaineers changed.  It was as\n    though by a flash summer had changed to winter, as though the yellow\n    glory of the standing corn had been obliterated by the dreary waste\n    of snow.  Nay, more: it was as when one beholds the track of the\n    whirlwind when the giants of the forest are levelled with the sward.\n    For a few seconds there was silence; and then, with an angry roar, as\n    when God speaks in the thunder, came the fierce determination of the\n    men of the Blue Mountains:\n\n    \"To Ilsin!  To Ilsin!\" and a stampede in the direction of the south\n    began.  For, Illustrious Lady, you, perhaps, who have been for so\n    short a time at Vissarion, may not know that at the extreme southern\n    point of the Land of the Blue Mountains lies the little port of\n    Ilsin, which long ago we wrested from the Turk.\n\n    The stampede was checked by the command, \"Halt!\" spoken in a\n    thunderous voice by the Gospodar.  Instinctively all stopped.  The\n    Gospodar Rupert spoke again:\n\n    \"Had we not better know a little more before we start on our journey?\n    I shall get by semaphore what details are known.  Do you all proceed\n    in silence and as swiftly as possible.  The Vladika and I will wait\n    here till we have received the news and have sent some instructions,\n    when we shall follow, and, if we can, overtake you.  One thing: be\n    absolutely silent on what has been.  Be secret of every detail--even\n    as to the rescue of the Voivodin--except what I send.\"\n\n    Without a word--thus showing immeasurable trust--the whole body--not\n    a very large one, it is true--moved on, and the Gospodar began\n    signalling.  As I was myself expert in the code, I did not require\n    any explanation, but followed question and answer on either side.\n    The first words the Gospodar Rupert signalled were:\n\n    \"Silence, absolute and profound, as to everything which has been.\"\n    Then he asked for details of the capture of the Voivode.  The answer\n    ran:\n\n    \"He was followed from Flushing, and his enemies advised by the spies\n    all along the route.  At Ragusa quite a number of\n    strangers--travellers seemingly--went on board the packet.  When he\n    got out, the strangers debarked too, and evidently followed him,\n    though, as yet, we have no details.  He disappeared at Ilsin from the\n    Hotel Reo, whither he had gone.  All possible steps are being taken\n    to trace his movements, and strictest silence and secrecy are\n    observed.\"\n\n    His answer was:\n\n    \"Good!  Keep silent and secret.  Am hurrying back.  Signal request to\n    Archbishop and all members of National Council to come to Gadaar with\n    all speed.  There the yacht will meet him.  Tell Rooke take yacht all\n    speed to Gadaar; there meet Archbishop and Council--give him list of\n    names--and return full speed.  Have ready plenty arms, six flying\n    artillery.  Two hundred men, provisions three days.  Silence,\n    silence.  All depends on that.  All to go on as usual at Castle,\n    except to those in secret.\"\n\n    When the receipt of his message had been signalled, we three--for, of\n    course, the Voivodin was with us; she had refused to leave the\n    Gospodar--set out hot-foot after our comrades.  But by the time we\n    had descended the hill it was evident that the Voivodin could not\n    keep up the terrific pace at which we were going.  She struggled\n    heroically, but the long journey she had already taken, and the\n    hardship and anxiety she had suffered, had told on her.  The Gospodar\n    stopped, and said that it would be better that he should press on--it\n    was, perhaps, her father's life--and said he would carry her.\n\n    \"No, no!\" she answered.  \"Go on!  I shall follow with the Vladika.\n    And then you can have things ready to get on soon after the\n    Archbishop and Council arrive.\"  They kissed each other after, on her\n    part, a shy glance at me; and he went on the track of our comrades at\n    a great pace.  I could see him shortly after catch them up,--though\n    they, too, were going fast.  For a few minutes they ran together, he\n    speaking--I could note it from the way they kept turning their heads\n    towards him.  Then he broke away from them hurriedly.  He went like a\n    stag breaking covert, and was soon out of sight.  They halted a\n    moment or two.  Then some few ran on, and all the rest came back\n    towards us.  Quickly they improvised a litter with cords and\n    branches, and insisted that the Voivodin should use it.  In an\n    incredibly short time we were under way again, and proceeding with\n    great rapidity towards Vissarion.  The men took it in turns to help\n    with the litter; I had the honour of taking a hand in the work\n    myself.\n\n    About a third of the way out from Vissarion a number of our people\n    met us.  They were fresh, and as they carried the litter, we who were\n    relieved were free for speed.  So we soon arrived at the Castle.\n\n    Here we found all humming like a hive of bees.  The yacht, which\n    Captain Rooke had kept fired ever since the pursuing party under the\n    Gospodar had left Vissarion, was already away, and tearing up the\n    coast at a fearful rate.  The rifles and ammunition were stacked on\n    the quay.  The field-guns, too, were equipped, and the cases of\n    ammunition ready to ship.  The men, two hundred of them, were paraded\n    in full kit, ready to start at a moment's notice.  The provision for\n    three days was all ready to put aboard, and barrels of fresh water to\n    trundle aboard when the yacht should return.  At one end of the quay,\n    ready to lift on board, stood also the Gospodar's aeroplane, fully\n    equipped, and ready, if need were, for immediate flight.\n\n    I was glad to see that the Voivodin seemed none the worse for her\n    terrible experience.  She still wore her shroud; but no one seemed to\n    notice it as anything strange.  The whisper had evidently gone round\n    of what had been.  But discretion ruled the day.  She and the\n    Gospodar met as two who had served and suffered in common; but I was\n    glad to notice that both kept themselves under such control that none\n    of those not already in the secret even suspected that there was any\n    love between them, let alone marriage.\n\n    We all waited with what patience we could till word was signalled\n    from the Castle tower that the yacht had appeared over the northern\n    horizon, and was coming down fast, keeping inshore as she came.\n\n    When she arrived, we heard to our joy that all concerned had done\n    their work well.  The Archbishop was aboard, and of the National\n    Council not one was missing.  The Gospodar hurried them all into the\n    great hall of the Castle, which had in the meantime been got ready.\n    I, too, went with him, but the Voivodin remained without.\n\n    When all were seated, he rose and said:\n\n    \"My Lord Archbishop, Vladika, and Lords of the Council all, I have\n    dared to summon you in this way because time presses, and the life of\n    one you all love--the Voivode Vissarion--is at stake.  This audacious\n    attempt of the Turk is the old aggression under a new form.  It is a\n    new and more daring step than ever to try to capture your chief and\n    his daughter, the Voivodin, whom you love.  Happily, the latter part\n    of the scheme is frustrated.  The Voivodin is safe and amongst us.\n    But the Voivode is held prisoner--if, indeed, he be still alive.  He\n    must be somewhere near Ilsin--but where exactly we know not as yet.\n    We have an expedition ready to start the moment we receive your\n    sanction--your commands.  We shall obey your wishes with our lives.\n    But as the matter is instant, I would venture to ask one question,\n    and one only: 'Shall we rescue the Voivode at any cost that may\n    present itself?'  I ask this, for the matter has now become an\n    international one, and, if our enemies are as earnest as we are, the\n    issue is war!\"\n\n    Having so spoken, and with a dignity and force which is\n    inexpressible, he withdrew; and the Council, having appointed a\n    scribe--the monk Cristoferos, whom I had suggested--began its work.\n\n    The Archbishop spoke:\n\n    \"Lords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I venture to ask you\n    that the answer to the Gospodar Rupert be an instant 'Yes!' together\n    with thanks and honour to that gallant Englisher, who has made our\n    cause his own, and who has so valiantly rescued our beloved Voivodin\n    from the ruthless hands of our enemies.\"  Forthwith the oldest member\n    of the Council--Nicolos of Volok--rose, and, after throwing a\n    searching look round the faces of all, and seeing grave nods of\n    assent--for not a word was spoken--said to him who held the door:\n    \"Summon the Gospodar Rupert forthwith!\"  When Rupert entered, he\n    spoke to him:\n\n    \"Gospodar Rupert, the Council of the Blue Mountains has only one\n    answer to give: Proceed!  Rescue the Voivode Vissarion, whatever the\n    cost may be!  You hold henceforth in your hand the handjar of our\n    nation, as already, for what you have done in your valiant rescue of\n    our beloved Voivodin, your breast holds the heart of our people.\n    Proceed at once!  We give you, I fear, little time; but we know that\n    such is your own wish.  Later, we shall issue formal authorization,\n    so that if war may ensue, our allies may understand that you have\n    acted for the nation, and also such letters credential as may be\n    required by you in this exceptional service.  These shall follow you\n    within an hour.  For our enemies we take no account.  See, we draw\n    the handjar that we offer you.\"  As one man all in the hall drew\n    their handjars, which flashed as a blaze of lightning.\n\n    There did not seem to be an instant's delay.  The Council broke up,\n    and its members, mingling with the people without, took active part\n    in the preparations.  Not many minutes had elapsed when the yacht,\n    manned and armed and stored as arranged, was rushing out of the\n    creek.  On the bridge, beside Captain Rooke, stood the Gospodar\n    Rupert and the still-shrouded form of the Voivodin Teuta.  I myself\n    was on the lower deck with the soldiers, explaining to certain of\n    them the special duties which they might be called on to fulfil.  I\n    held the list which the Gospodar Rupert had prepared whilst we were\n    waiting for the yacht to arrive from Gadaar.\n\n                                                         PETROF VLASTIMIR.\n\n\n\nFROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 9, 1907.\n\nWe went at a terrific pace down the coast, keeping well inshore so as to\navoid, if possible, being seen from the south.  Just north of Ilsin a\nrocky headland juts out, and that was our cover.  On the north of the\npeninsula is a small land-locked bay, with deep water.  It is large\nenough to take the yacht, though a much larger vessel could not safely\nenter.  We ran in, and anchored close to the shore, which has a rocky\nfrontage--a natural shelf of rock, which is practically the same as a\nquay.  Here we met the men who had come from Ilsin and the neighbourhood\nin answer to our signalling earlier in the day.  They gave us the latest\ninformation regarding the kidnapping of the Voivode, and informed us that\nevery man in that section of the country was simply aflame about it.\nThey assured us that we could rely on them, not merely to fight to the\ndeath, but to keep silence absolutely.  Whilst the seamen, under the\ndirection of Rooke, took the aeroplane on shore and found a suitable\nplace for it, where it was hidden from casual view, but from which it\ncould be easily launched, the Vladika and I--and, of course, my\nwife--were hearing such details as were known of the disappearance of her\nfather.\n\nIt seems that he travelled secretly in order to avoid just such a\npossibility as has happened.  No one knew of his coming till he came to\nFiume, whence he sent a guarded message to the Archbishop, which the\nlatter alone would understand.  But this Turkish agents were evidently on\nhis track all the time, and doubtless the Bureau of Spies was kept well\nadvised.  He landed at Ilsin from a coasting steamer from Ragusa to the\nLevant.\n\nFor two days before his coming there had been quite an unusual number of\narrivals at the little port, at which arrivals are rare.  And it turned\nout that the little hotel--the only fairly good one in Ilsin--was almost\nfilled up.  Indeed, only one room was left, which the Voivode took for\nthe night.  The innkeeper did not know the Voivode in his disguise, but\nsuspected who it was from the description.  He dined quietly, and went to\nbed.  His room was at the back, on the ground-floor, looking out on the\nbank of the little River Silva, which here runs into the harbour.  No\ndisturbance was heard in the night.  Late in the morning, when the\nelderly stranger had not made his appearance, inquiry was made at his\ndoor.  He did not answer, so presently the landlord forced the door, and\nfound the room empty.  His luggage was seemingly intact, only the clothes\nwhich he had worn were gone.  A strange thing was that, though the bed\nhad been slept in and his clothes were gone, his night-clothes were not\nto be found, from which it was argued by the local authorities, when they\ncame to make inquiry, that he had gone or been taken from the room in his\nnight-gear, and that his clothes had been taken with him.  There was\nevidently some grim suspicion on the part of the authorities, for they\nhad commanded absolute silence on all in the house.  When they came to\nmake inquiry as to the other guests, it was found that one and all had\ngone in the course of the morning, after paying their bills.  None of\nthem had any heavy luggage, and there was nothing remaining by which they\nmight be traced or which would afford any clue to their identity.  The\nauthorities, having sent a confidential report to the seat of government,\ncontinued their inquiries, and even now all available hands were at work\non the investigation.  When I had signalled to Vissarion, before my\narrival there, word had been sent through the priesthood to enlist in the\ninvestigation the services of all good men, so that every foot of ground\nin that section of the Blue Mountains was being investigated.  The\nport-master was assured by his watchmen that no vessel, large or small,\nhad heft the harbour during the night.  The inference, therefore, was\nthat the Voivode's captors had made inland with him--if, indeed, they\nwere not already secreted in or near the town.\n\nWhilst we were receiving the various reports, a hurried message came that\nit was now believed that the whole party were in the Silent Tower.  This\nwas a well-chosen place for such an enterprise.  It was a massive tower\nof immense strength, built as a memorial--and also as a \"keep\"--after one\nof the massacres of the invading Turks.\n\nIt stood on the summit of a rocky knoll some ten miles inland from the\nPort of Ilsin.  It was a place shunned as a rule, and the country all\naround it was so arid and desolate that there were no residents near it.\nAs it was kept for state use, and might be serviceable in time of war, it\nwas closed with massive iron doors, which were kept locked except upon\ncertain occasions.  The keys were at the seat of government at Plazac.\nIf, therefore, it had been possible to the Turkish marauders to gain\nentrance and exit, it might be a difficult as well as a dangerous task to\ntry to cut the Voivode out.  His presence with them was a dangerous\nmenace to any force attacking them, for they would hold his life as a\nthreat.\n\nI consulted with the Vladika at once as to what was best to be done.  And\nwe decided that, though we should put a cordon of guards around it at a\nsafe distance to prevent them receiving warning, we should at present\nmake no attack.\n\nWe made further inquiry as to whether there had been any vessel seen in\nthe neighbourhood during the past few days, and were informed that once\nor twice a warship had been seen on the near side of the southern\nhorizon.  This was evidently the ship which Rooke had seen on his rush\ndown the coast after the abduction of the Voivodin, and which he had\nidentified as a Turkish vessel.  The glimpses of her which had been had\nwere all in full daylight--there was no proof that she had not stolen up\nduring the night-time without lights.  But the Vladika and I were\nsatisfied that the Turkish vessel was watching--was in league with both\nparties of marauders--and was intended to take off any of the strangers,\nor their prey, who might reach Ilsin undetected.  It was evidently with\nthis view that the kidnappers of Teuta had, in the first instance, made\nwith all speed for the south.  It was only when disappointed there that\nthey headed up north, seeking in desperation for some chance of crossing\nthe border.  That ring of steel had so far well served its purpose.\n\nI sent for Rooke, and put the matter before him.  He had thought it out\nfor himself to the same end as we had.  His deduction was:\n\n\"Let us keep the cordon, and watch for any signal from the Silent Tower.\nThe Turks will tire before we shall.  I undertake to watch the Turkish\nwarship.  During the night I shall run down south, without lights, and\nhave a look at her, even if I have to wait till the grey of the dawn to\ndo so.  She may see us; but if she does I shall crawl away at such pace\nthat she shall not get any idea of our speed.  She will certainly come\nnearer before a day is over, for be sure the bureau of spies is kept\nadvised, and they know that when the country is awake each day increases\nthe hazard of them and their plans being discovered.  From their caution\nI gather that they do not court discovery; and from that that they do not\nwish for an open declaration of war.  If this be so, why should we not\ncome out to them and force an issue if need be?\"\n\nWhen Teuta and I got a chance to be alone, we discussed the situation in\nevery phase.  The poor girl was in a dreadful state of anxiety regarding\nher father's safety.  At first she was hardly able to speak, or even to\nthink, coherently.  Her utterance was choked, and her reasoning palsied\nwith indignation.  But presently the fighting blood of her race restored\nher faculties, and then her woman's quick wit was worth the reasoning of\na camp full of men.  Seeing that she was all on fire with the subject, I\nsat still and waited, taking care not to interrupt her.  For quite a long\ntime she sat still, whilst the coming night thickened.  When she spoke,\nthe whole plan of action, based on subtle thinking, had mapped itself out\nin her mind:\n\n\"We must act quickly.  Every hour increases the risk to my father.\"  Here\nher voice broke for an instant; but she recovered herself and went on:\n\n\"If you go to the ship, I must not go with you.  It would not do for me\nto be seen.  The Captain doubtless knows of both attempts: that to carry\nme off as well as that against my father.  As yet he is in ignorance of\nwhat has happened.  You and your party of brave, loyal men did their work\nso well that no news could go forth.  So long, therefore, as the naval\nCaptain is ignorant, he must delay till the last.  But if he saw me he\nwould know that _that_ branch of the venture had miscarried.  He would\ngather from our being here that we had news of my father's capture, and\nas he would know that the marauders would fail unless they were relieved\nby force, he would order the captive to be slain.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, to-morrow you had, perhaps, better see the Captain, but\nto-night we must try to rescue my father.  Here I think I see a way.  You\nhave your aeroplane.  Please take me with you into the Silent Tower.\"\n\n\"Not for a world of chrysolite!\" said I, horrified.  She took my hand and\nheld it tight whilst she went on:\n\n\"Dear, I know, I know!  Be satisfied.  But it is the only way.  You can,\nI know, get there, and in the dark.  But if you were to go in it, it\nwould give warning to the enemies, and besides, my father would not\nunderstand.  Remember, he does not know you; he has never seen you, and\ndoes not, I suppose, even know as yet of your existence.  But he would\nknow me at once, and in any dress.  You can manage to lower me into the\nTower by a rope from the aeroplane.  The Turks as yet do not know of our\npursuit, and doubtless rely, at all events in part, on the strength and\nsecurity of the Tower.  Therefore their guard will be less active than it\nwould at first or later on.  I shall post father in all details, and we\nshall be ready quickly.  Now, dear, let us think out the scheme together.\nLet your man's wit and experience help my ignorance, and we shall save my\nfather!\"\n\nHow could I have resisted such pleading--even had it not seemed wise?\nBut wise it was; and I, who knew what the aeroplane could do under my own\nguidance, saw at once the practicalities of the scheme.  Of course there\nwas a dreadful risk in case anything should go wrong.  But we are at\npresent living in a world of risks--and her father's life was at stake.\nSo I took my dear wife in my arms, and told her that my mind was hers for\nthis, as my soul and body already were.  And I cheered her by saying that\nI thought it might be done.\n\nI sent for Rooke, and told him of the new adventure, and he quite agreed\nwith me in the wisdom of it.  I then told him that he would have to go\nand interview the Captain of the Turkish warship in the morning, if I did\nnot turn up.  \"I am going to see the Vladika,\" I said.  \"He will lead our\nown troops in the attack on the Silent Tower.  But it will rest with you\nto deal with the warship.  Ask the Captain to whom or what nation the\nship belongs.  He is sure to refuse to tell.  In such case mention to him\nthat if he flies no nation's flag, his vessel is a pirate ship, and that\nyou, who are in command of the navy of the Blue Mountains, will deal with\nhim as a pirate is dealt with--no quarter, no mercy.  He will temporize,\nand perhaps try a bluff; but when things get serious with him he will\nland a force, or try to, and may even prepare to shell the town.  He will\nthreaten to, at any rate.  In such case deal with him as you think best,\nor as near to it as you can.\"  He answered:\n\n\"I shall carry out your wishes with my life.  It is a righteous task.\nNot that anything of that sort would ever stand in my way.  If he attacks\nour nation, either as a Turk or a pirate, I shall wipe him out.  We shall\nsee what our own little packet can do.  Moreover, any of the marauders\nwho have entered the Blue Mountains, from sea or otherwise, shall never\nget out by sea!  I take it that we of my contingent shall cover the\nattacking party.  It will be a sorry time for us all if that happens\nwithout our seeing you and the Voivodin; for in such case we shall\nunderstand the worst!\"  Iron as he was, the man trembled.\n\n\"That is so, Rooke,\" I said.  \"We are taking a desperate chance, we know.\nBut the case is desperate!  But we all have our duty to do, whatever\nhappens.  Ours and yours is stern; but when we have done it, the result\nwill be that life will be easier for others--for those that are left.\"\n\nBefore he left, I asked him to send up to me three suits of the Masterman\nbullet-proof clothes of which we had a supply on the yacht.\n\n\"Two are for the Voivodin and myself,\" I said; \"the third is for the\nVoivode to put on.  The Voivodin will take it with her when she descends\nfrom the aeroplane into the Tower.\"\n\nWhilst any daylight was left I went out to survey the ground.  My wife\nwanted to come with me, but I would not let her.  \"No,\" said I; \"you will\nhave at the best a fearful tax on your strength and your nerves.  You\nwill want to be as fresh as is possible when you get on the aeroplane.\"\nLike a good wife, she obeyed, and lay down to rest in the little tent\nprovided for her.\n\nI took with me a local man who knew the ground, and who was trusted to be\nsilent.  We made a long detour when we had got as near the Silent Tower\nas we could without being noticed.  I made notes from my compass as to\ndirections, and took good notice of anything that could possibly serve as\na landmark.  By the time we got home I was pretty well satisfied that if\nall should go well I could easily sail over the Tower in the dark.  Then\nI had a talk with my wife, and gave her full instructions:\n\n\"When we arrive over the Tower,\" I said, \"I shall lower you with a long\nrope.  You will have a parcel of food and spirit for your father in case\nhe is fatigued or faint; and, of course, the bullet-proof suit, which he\nmust put on at once.  You will also have a short rope with a belt at\neither end--one for your father, the other for you.  When I turn the\naeroplane and come back again, you will have ready the ring which lies\nmidway between the belts.  This you will catch into the hook at the end\nof the lowered rope.  When all is secure, and I have pulled you both up\nby the windlass so as to clear the top, I shall throw out ballast which\nwe shall carry on purpose, and away we go!  I am sorry it must be so\nuncomfortable for you both, but there is no other way.  When we get well\nclear of the Tower, I shall take you both up on the platform.  If\nnecessary, I shall descend to do it--and then we shall steer for Ilsin.\"\n\n\"When all is safe, our men will attack the Tower.  We must let them do\nit, for they expect it.  A few men in the clothes and arms which we took\nfrom your captors will be pursued by some of ours.  It is all arranged.\nThey will ask the Turks to admit them, and if the latter have not learned\nof your father's escape, perhaps they will do so.  Once in, our men will\ntry to open the gate.  The chances are against them, poor fellows! but\nthey are all volunteers, and will die fighting.  If they win out, great\nglory will be theirs.\"\n\n\"The moon does not rise to-night till just before midnight, so we have\nplenty of time.  We shall start from here at ten.  If all be well, I\nshall place you in the Tower with your father in less than a quarter-hour\nfrom that.  A few minutes will suffice to clothe him in bullet-proof and\nget on his belt.  I shall not be away from the Tower more than a very few\nminutes, and, please God, long before eleven we shall be safe.  Then the\nTower can be won in an attack by our mountaineers.  Perhaps, when the\nguns are heard on the ship of war--for there is sure to be firing--the\nCaptain may try to land a shore party.  But Rooke will stand in the way,\nand if I know the man and _The Lady_, we shall not be troubled with many\nTurks to-night.  By midnight you and your father can be on the way to\nVissarion.  I can interview the naval Captain in the morning.\"\n\nMy wife's marvellous courage and self-possession stood to her.  At half\nan hour before the time fixed she was ready for our adventure.  She had\nimproved the scheme in one detail.  She had put on her own belt and\ncoiled the rope round her waist, so the only delay would be in bringing\nher father's belt.  She would keep the bullet-proof dress intended to be\nhis strapped in a packet on her back, so that if occasion should be\nfavourable he would not want to put it on till he and she should have\nreached the platform of the aeroplane.  In such case, I should not steer\naway from the Tower at all, but would pass slowly across it and take up\nthe captive and his brave daughter before leaving.  I had learned from\nlocal sources that the Tower was in several stories.  Entrance was by the\nfoot, where the great iron-clad door was; then came living-rooms and\nstorage, and an open space at the top.  This would probably be thought\nthe best place for the prisoner, for it was deep-sunk within the massive\nwalls, wherein was no loophole of any kind.  This, if it should so\nhappen, would be the disposition of things best for our plan.  The guards\nwould at this time be all inside the Tower--probably resting, most of\nthem--so that it was possible that no one might notice the coming of the\nairship.  I was afraid to think that all might turn out so well, for in\nsuch case our task would be a simple enough one, and would in all human\nprobability be crowned with success.\n\nAt ten o'clock we started.  Teuta did not show the smallest sign of fear\nor even uneasiness, though this was the first time she had even seen an\naeroplane at work.  She proved to be an admirable passenger for an\nairship.  She stayed quite still, holding herself rigidly in the position\narranged, by the cords which I had fixed for her.\n\nWhen I had trued my course by the landmarks and with the compass lit by\nthe Tiny my electric light in the dark box, I had time to look about me.\nAll seemed quite dark wherever I looked--to land, or sea, or sky.  But\ndarkness is relative, and though each quarter and spot looked dark in\nturn, there was not such absolute darkness as a whole.  I could tell the\ndifference, for instance, between land and sea, no matter how far off we\nmight be from either.  Looking upward, the sky was dark; yet there was\nlight enough to see, and even distinguish broad effects.  I had no\ndifficulty in distinguishing the Tower towards which we were moving, and\nthat, after all, was the main thing.  We drifted slowly, very slowly, as\nthe air was still, and I only used the minimum pressure necessary for the\nengine.  I think I now understood for the first time the extraordinary\nvalue of the engine with which my Kitson was equipped.  It was noiseless,\nit was practically of no weight, and it allowed the machine to progress\nas easily as the old-fashioned balloon used to drift before a breeze.\nTeuta, who had naturally very fine sight, seemed to see even better than\nI did, for as we drew nearer to the Tower, and its round, open top began\nto articulate itself, she commenced to prepare for her part of the task.\nShe it was who uncoiled the long drag-rope ready for her lowering.  We\nwere proceeding so gently that she as well as I had hopes that I might be\nable to actually balance the machine on the top of the curving wall--a\nthing manifestly impossible on a straight surface, though it might have\nbeen possible on an angle.\n\nOn we crept--on, and on!  There was no sign of light about the Tower, and\nnot the faintest sound to be heard till we were almost close to the line\nof the rising wall; then we heard a sound of something like mirth, but\nmuffled by distance and thick walls.  From it we took fresh heart, for it\ntold us that our enemies were gathered in the lower chambers.  If only\nthe Voivode should be on the upper stage, all would be well.\n\nSlowly, almost inch by inch, and with a suspense that was agonizing, we\ncrossed some twenty or thirty feet above the top of the wall.  I could\nsee as we came near the jagged line of white patches where the heads of\nthe massacred Turks placed there on spikes in old days seemed to give\nstill their grim warning.  Seeing that they made in themselves a\ndifficulty of landing on the wall, I deflected the plane so that, as we\ncrept over the wall, we might, if they became displaced, brush them to\nthe outside of the wall.  A few seconds more, and I was able to bring the\nmachine to rest with the front of the platform jutting out beyond the\nTower wall.  Here I anchored her fore and aft with clamps which had been\nalready prepared.\n\nWhilst I was doing so Teuta had leaned over the inner edge of the\nplatform, and whispered as softly as the sigh of a gentle breeze:\n\n\"Hist! hist!\"  The answer came in a similar sound from some twenty feet\nbelow us, and we knew that the prisoner was alone.  Forthwith, having\nfixed the hook of the rope in the ring to which was attached her belt, I\nlowered my wife.  Her father evidently knew her whisper, and was ready.\nThe hollow Tower--a smooth cylinder within--sent up the voices from it\nfaint as were the whispers:\n\n\"Father, it is I--Teuta!\"\n\n\"My child, my brave daughter!\"\n\n\"Quick, father; strap the belt round you.  See that it is secure.  We\nhave to be lifted into the air if necessary.  Hold together.  It will be\neasier for Rupert to lift us to the airship.\"\n\n\"Rupert?\"\n\n\"Yes; I shall explain later.  Quick, quick!  There is not a moment to\nlose.  He is enormously strong, and can lift us together; but we must\nhelp him by being still, so he won't have to use the windlass, which\nmight creak.\"  As she spoke she jerked slightly at the rope, which was\nour preconcerted signal that I was to lift.  I was afraid the windlass\nmight creak, and her thoughtful hint decided me.  I bent my back to the\ntask, and in a few seconds they were on the platform on which they, at\nTeuta's suggestion, lay flat, one at each side of my seat, so as to keep\nthe best balance possible.\n\nI took off the clamps, lifted the bags of ballast to the top of the wall,\nso that there should be no sound of falling, and started the engine.  The\nmachine moved forward a few inches, so that it tilted towards the outside\nof the wall.  I threw my weight on the front part of the platform, and we\ncommenced our downward fall at a sharp angle.  A second enlarged the\nangle, and without further ado we slid away into the darkness.  Then,\nascending as we went, when the engine began to work at its strength, we\nturned, and presently made straight for Ilsin.\n\nThe journey was short--not many minutes.  It almost seemed as if no time\nwhatever had elapsed till we saw below us the gleam of lights, and by\nthem saw a great body of men gathered in military array.  We slackened\nand descended.  The crowd kept deathly silence, but when we were amongst\nthem we needed no telling that it was not due to lack of heart or absence\nof joy.  The pressure of their hands as they surrounded us, and the\ndevotion with which they kissed the hands and feet of both the Voivode\nand his daughter, were evidence enough for me, even had I not had my own\nshare of their grateful rejoicing.\n\nIn the midst of it all the low, stern voice of Rooke, who had burst a way\nto the front beside the Vladika, said:\n\n\"Now is the time to attack the Tower.  Forward, brothers, but in silence.\nLet there not be a sound till you are near the gate; then play your\nlittle comedy of the escaping marauders.  And 'twill be no comedy for\nthem in the Tower.  The yacht is all ready for the morning, Mr. Sent\nLeger, in case I do not come out of the scrimmage if the bluejackets\narrive.  In such case you will have to handle her yourself.  God keep\nyou, my Lady; and you, too, Voivode!  Forward!\"\n\nIn a ghostly silence the grim little army moved forwards.  Rooke and the\nmen with him disappeared into the darkness in the direction of the\nharbour of Ilsin.\n\n\n\nFROM THE SCRIPT OF THE VOIVODE, PETER VISSARION,\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 7, 1907.\n\nI had little idea, when I started on my homeward journey, that it would\nhave such a strange termination.  Even I, who ever since my boyhood have\nlived in a whirl of adventure, intrigue, or diplomacy--whichever it may\nbe called--statecraft, and war, had reason to be surprised.  I certainly\nthought that when I locked myself into my room in the hotel at Ilsin that\nI would have at last a spell, however short, of quiet.  All the time of\nmy prolonged negotiations with the various nationalities I had to be at\ntension; so, too, on my homeward journey, lest something at the last\nmoment should happen adversely to my mission.  But when I was safe on my\nown Land of the Blue Mountains, and laid my head on my pillow, where only\nfriends could be around me, I thought I might forget care.\n\nBut to wake with a rude hand over my mouth, and to feel myself grasped\ntight by so many hands that I could not move a limb, was a dreadful\nshock.  All after that was like a dreadful dream.  I was rolled in a\ngreat rug so tightly that I could hardly breathe, let alone cry out.\nLifted by many hands through the window, which I could hear was softly\nopened and shut for the purpose, and carried to a boat.  Again lifted\ninto some sort of litter, on which I was borne a long distance, but with\nconsiderable rapidity.  Again lifted out and dragged through a doorway\nopened on purpose--I could hear the clang as it was shut behind me.  Then\nthe rug was removed, and I found myself, still in my night-gear, in the\nmidst of a ring of men.  There were two score of them, all Turks, all\nstrong-looking, resolute men, armed to the teeth.  My clothes, which had\nbeen taken from my room, were thrown down beside me, and I was told to\ndress.  As the Turks were going from the room--shaped like a vault--where\nwe then were, the last of them, who seemed to be some sort of officer,\nsaid:\n\n\"If you cry out or make any noise whatever whilst you are in this Tower,\nyou shall die before your time!\"  Presently some food and water were\nbrought me, and a couple of blankets.  I wrapped myself up and slept till\nearly in the morning.  Breakfast was brought, and the same men filed in.\nIn the presence of them all the same officer said:\n\n\"I have given instructions that if you make any noise or betray your\npresence to anyone outside this Tower, the nearest man is to restore you\nto immediate quiet with his yataghan.  It you promise me that you will\nremain quiet whilst you are within the Tower, I can enlarge your\nliberties somewhat.  Do you promise?\"  I promised as he wished; there was\nno need to make necessary any stricter measure of confinement.  Any\nchance of escape lay in having the utmost freedom allowed to me.\nAlthough I had been taken away with such secrecy, I knew that before long\nthere would be pursuit.  So I waited with what patience I could.  I was\nallowed to go on the upper platform--a consideration due, I am convinced,\nto my captors' wish for their own comfort rather than for mine.\n\nIt was not very cheering, for during the daytime I had satisfied myself\nthat it would be quite impossible for even a younger and more active man\nthan I am to climb the walls.  They were built for prison purposes, and a\ncat could not find entry for its claws between the stones.  I resigned\nmyself to my fate as well as I could.  Wrapping my blanket round me, I\nlay down and looked up at the sky.  I wished to see it whilst I could.  I\nwas just dropping to sleep--the unutterable silence of the place broken\nonly now and again by some remark by my captors in the rooms below\nme--when there was a strange appearance just over me--an appearance so\nstrange that I sat up, and gazed with distended eyes.\n\nAcross the top of the tower, some height above, drifted, slowly and\nsilently, a great platform.  Although the night was dark, it was so much\ndarker where I was within the hollow of the Tower that I could actually\nsee what was above me.  I knew it was an aeroplane--one of which I had\nseen in Washington.  A man was seated in the centre, steering; and beside\nhim was a silent figure of a woman all wrapped in white.  It made my\nheart beat to see her, for she was figured something like my Teuta, but\nbroader, less shapely.  She leaned over, and a whispered \"Ssh!\" crept\ndown to me.  I answered in similar way.  Whereupon she rose, and the man\nlowered her down into the Tower.  Then I saw that it was my dear daughter\nwho had come in this wonderful way to save me.  With infinite haste she\nhelped me to fasten round my waist a belt attached to a rope, which was\ncoiled round her; and then the man, who was a giant in strength as well\nas stature, raised us both to the platform of the aeroplane, which he set\nin motion without an instant's delay.\n\nWithin a few seconds, and without any discovery being made of my escape,\nwe were speeding towards the sea.  The lights of Ilsin were in front of\nus.  Before reaching the town, however, we descended in the midst of a\nlittle army of my own people, who were gathered ready to advance upon the\nSilent Tower, there to effect, if necessary, my rescue by force.  Small\nchance would there have been of my life in case of such a struggle.\nHappily, however, the devotion and courage of my dear daughter and of her\ngallant companion prevented such a necessity.  It was strange to me to\nfind such joyous reception amongst my friends expressed in such a\nwhispered silence.  There was no time for comment or understanding or the\nasking of questions--I was fain to take things as they stood, and wait\nfor fuller explanation.\n\nThis came later, when my daughter and I were able to converse alone.\n\nWhen the expedition went out against the Silent Tower, Teuta and I went\nto her tent, and with us came her gigantic companion, who seemed not\nwearied, but almost overcome with sleep.  When we came into the tent,\nover which at a little distance a cordon of our mountaineers stood on\nguard, he said to me:\n\n\"May I ask you, sir, to pardon me for a time, and allow the Voivodin to\nexplain matters to you?  She will, I know, so far assist me, for there is\nso much work still to be done before we are free of the present peril.\nFor myself, I am almost overcome with sleep.  For three nights I have had\nno sleep, but all during that time much labour and more anxiety.  I could\nhold on longer; but at daybreak I must go out to the Turkish warship that\nlies in the offing.  She is a Turk, though she does not confess to it;\nand she it is who has brought hither the marauders who captured both your\ndaughter and yourself.  It is needful that I go, for I hold a personal\nauthority from the National Council to take whatever step may be\nnecessary for our protection.  And when I go I should be clear-headed,\nfor war may rest on that meeting.  I shall be in the adjoining tent, and\nshall come at once if I am summoned, in case you wish for me before\ndawn.\"  Here my daughter struck in:\n\n\"Father, ask him to remain here.  We shall not disturb him, I am sure, in\nour talking.  And, moreover, if you knew how much I owe to him--to his\nown bravery and his strength--you would understand how much safer I feel\nwhen he is close to me, though we are surrounded by an army of our brave\nmountaineers.\"\n\n\"But, my daughter,\" I said, for I was as yet all in ignorance, \"there are\nconfidences between father and daughter which none other may share.  Some\nof what has been I know, but I want to know all, and it might be better\nthat no stranger--however valiant he may be, or no matter in what measure\nwe are bound to him--should be present.\"  To my astonishment, she who had\nalways been amenable to my lightest wish actually argued with me:\n\n\"Father, there are other confidences which have to be respected in like\nwise.  Bear with me, dear, till I have told you all, and I am right sure\nthat you will agree with me.  I ask it, father.\"\n\nThat settled the matter, and as I could see that the gallant gentleman\nwho had rescued me was swaying on his feet as he waited respectfully, I\nsaid to him:\n\n\"Rest with us, sir.  We shall watch over your sleep.\"\n\nThen I had to help him, for almost on the instant he sank down, and I had\nto guide him to the rugs spread on the ground.  In a few seconds he was\nin a deep sleep.  As I stood looking at him, till I had realized that he\nvas really asleep, I could not help marvelling at the bounty of Nature\nthat could uphold even such a man as this to the last moment of work to\nbe done, and then allow so swift a collapse when all was over, and he\ncould rest peacefully.\n\nHe was certainly a splendid fellow.  I think I never saw so fine a man\nphysically in my life.  And if the lesson of his physiognomy be true, he\nis as sterling inwardly as his external is fair.  \"Now,\" said I to Teuta,\n\"we are to all intents quite alone.  Tell me all that has been, so that I\nmay understand.\"\n\nWhereupon my daughter, making me sit down, knelt beside me, and told me\nfrom end to end the most marvellous story I had ever heard or read of.\nSomething of it I had already known from the Archbishop Paleologue's\nlater letters, but of all else I was ignorant.  Far away in the great\nWest beyond the Atlantic, and again on the fringe of the Eastern seas, I\nhad been thrilled to my heart's core by the heroic devotion and fortitude\nof my daughter in yielding herself for her country's sake to that fearful\nordeal of the Crypt; of the grief of the nation at her reported death,\nnews of which was so mercifully and wisely withheld from me as long as\npossible; of the supernatural rumours that took root so deep; but no word\nor hint had come to me of a man who had come across the orbit of her\nlife, much less of all that has resulted from it.  Neither had I known of\nher being carried off, or of the thrice gallant rescue of her by Rupert.\nLittle wonder that I thought so highly of him even at the first moment I\nhad a clear view of him when he sank down to sleep before me.  Why, the\nman must be a marvel.  Even our mountaineers could not match such\nendurance as his.  In the course of her narrative my daughter told me of\nhow, being wearied with her long waiting in the tomb, and waking to find\nherself alone when the floods were out, and even the Crypt submerged, she\nsought safety and warmth elsewhere; and how she came to the Castle in the\nnight, and found the strange man alone.  I said: \"That was dangerous,\ndaughter, if not wrong.  The man, brave and devoted as he is, must answer\nme--your father.\"  At that she was greatly upset, and before going on\nwith her narrative, drew me close in her arms, and whispered to me:\n\n\"Be gentle to me, father, for I have had much to bear.  And be good to\nhim, for he holds my heart in his breast!\"  I reassured her with a gentle\npressure--there was no need to speak.  She then went on to tell me about\nher marriage, and how her husband, who had fallen into the belief that\nshe was a Vampire, had determined to give even his soul for her; and how\nshe had on the night of the marriage left him and gone back to the tomb\nto play to the end the grim comedy which she had undertaken to perform\ntill my return; and how, on the second night after her marriage, as she\nwas in the garden of the Castle--going, as she shyly told me, to see if\nall was well with her husband--she was seized secretly, muffled up,\nbound, and carried off.  Here she made a pause and a digression.\nEvidently some fear lest her husband and myself should quarrel assailed\nher, for she said:\n\n\"Do understand, father, that Rupert's marriage to me was in all ways\nregular, and quite in accord with our customs.  Before we were married I\ntold the Archbishop of my wish.  He, as your representative during your\nabsence, consented himself, and brought the matter to the notice of the\nVladika and the Archimandrites.  All these concurred, having exacted from\nme--very properly, I think--a sacred promise to adhere to my\nself-appointed task.  The marriage itself was orthodox in all\nways--though so far unusual that it was held at night, and in darkness,\nsave for the lights appointed by the ritual.  As to that, the Archbishop\nhimself, or the Archimandrite of Spazac, who assisted him, or the\nVladika, who acted as Paranymph, will, all or any of them, give you full\ndetails.  Your representative made all inquiries as to Rupert Sent Leger,\nwho lived in Vissarion, though he did not know who I was, or from his\npoint of view who I had been.  But I must tell you of my rescue.\"\n\nAnd so she went on to tell me of that unavailing journey south by her\ncaptors; of their bafflement by the cordon which Rupert had established\nat the first word of danger to \"the daughter of our leader,\" though he\nlittle knew who the \"leader\" was, or who was his \"daughter\"; of how the\nbrutal marauders tortured her to speed with their daggers; and how her\nwounds left blood-marks on the ground as she passed along; then of the\nhalt in the valley, when the marauders came to know that their road north\nwas menaced, if not already blocked; of the choosing of the murderers,\nand their keeping ward over her whilst their companions went to survey\nthe situation; and of her gallant rescue by that noble fellow, her\nhusband--my son I shall call him henceforth, and thank God that I may\nhave that happiness and that honour!\n\nThen my daughter went on to tell me of the race back to Vissarion, when\nRupert went ahead of all--as a leader should do; of the summoning of the\nArchbishop and the National Council; and of their placing the nation's\nhandjar in Rupert's hand; of the journey to Ilsin, and the flight of my\ndaughter--and my son--on the aeroplane.\n\nThe rest I knew.\n\nAs she finished, the sleeping man stirred and woke--broad awake in a\nsecond--sure sign of a man accustomed to campaign and adventure.  At a\nglance he recalled everything that had been, and sprang to his feet.  He\nstood respectfully before me for a few seconds before speaking.  Then he\nsaid, with an open, engaging smile:\n\n\"I see, sir, you know all.  Am I forgiven--for Teuta's sake as well as my\nown?\"  By this time I was also on my feet.  A man like that walks\nstraight into my heart.  My daughter, too, had risen, and stood by my\nside.  I put out my hand and grasped his, which seemed to leap to meet\nme--as only the hand of a swordsman can do.\n\n\"I am glad you are my son!\" I said.  It was all I could say, and I meant\nit and all it implied.  We shook hands warmly.  Teuta was pleased; she\nkissed me, and then stood holding my arm with one hand, whilst she linked\nher other hand in the arm of her husband.\n\nHe summoned one of the sentries without, and told him to ask Captain\nRooke to come to him.  The latter had been ready for a call, and came at\nonce.  When through the open flap of the tent we saw him coming,\nRupert--as I must call him now, because Teuta wishes it; and I like to do\nit myself--said:\n\n\"I must be off to board the Turkish vessel before it comes inshore.\nGood-bye, sir, in case we do not meet again.\"  He said the last few words\nin so low a voice that I only could hear them.  Then he kissed his wife,\nand told her he expected to be back in time for breakfast, and was gone.\nHe met Rooke--I am hardly accustomed to call him Captain as yet, though,\nindeed, he well deserves it--at the edge of the cordon of sentries, and\nthey went quickly together towards the port, where the yacht was lying\nwith steam up.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII: THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR\n\n\nFROM THE REPORT OF CRISTOFEROS, WAR-SCRIBE TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 7, 1907.\n\nWhen the Gospodar Rupert and Captain Rooke came within hailing distance\nof the strange ship, the former hailed her, using one after another the\nlanguages of England, Germany, France, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Spain,\nPortugal, and another which I did not know; I think it must have been\nAmerican.  By this time the whole line of the bulwark was covered by a\nrow of Turkish faces.  When, in Turkish, the Gospodar asked for the\nCaptain, the latter came to the gangway, which had been opened, and stood\nthere.  His uniform was that of the Turkish navy--of that I am prepared\nto swear--but he made signs of not understanding what had been said;\nwhereupon the Gospodar spoke again, but in French this time.  I append\nthe exact conversation which took place, none other joining in it.  I\ntook down in shorthand the words of both as they were spoken:\n\nTHE GOSPODAR.  \"Are you the Captain of this ship?\"\n\nTHE CAPTAIN.  \"I am.\"\n\nGOSPODAR.  \"To what nationality do you belong?\"\n\nCAPTAIN.  \"It matters not.  I am Captain of this ship.\"\n\nGOSPODAR.  \"I alluded to your ship.  What national flag is she under?\"\n\nCAPTAIN (_throwing his eye over the top-hamper_).  \"I do not see that any\nflag is flying.\"\n\nGOSPODAR.  \"I take it that, as commander, you can allow me on board with\nmy two companions?\"\n\nCAPTAIN.  \"I can, upon proper request being made!\"\n\nGOSPODAR (_taking off his cap_).  \"I ask your courtesy, Captain.  I am\nthe representative and accredited officer of the National Council of the\nLand of the Blue Mountains, in whose waters you now are; and on their\naccount I ask for a formal interview on urgent matters.\"\n\nThe Turk, who was, I am bound to say, in manner most courteous as yet,\ngave some command to his officers, whereupon the companion-ladders and\nstage were lowered and the gangway manned, as is usual for the reception\non a ship of war of an honoured guest.\n\nCAPTAIN.  \"You are welcome, sir--you and your two companions--as you\nrequest.\"\n\nThe Gospodar bowed.  Our companion-ladder was rigged on the instant, and\na launch lowered.  The Gospodar and Captain Rooke--taking me with\nthem--entered, and rowed to the warship, where we were all honourably\nreceived.  There were an immense number of men on board, soldiers as well\nas seamen.  It looked more like a warlike expedition than a fighting-ship\nin time of peace.  As we stepped on the deck, the seamen and marines, who\nwere all armed as at drill, presented arms.  The Gospodar went first\ntowards the Captain, and Captain Rooke and I followed close behind him.\nThe Gospodar spoke:\n\n\"I am Rupert Sent Leger, a subject of his Britannic Majesty, presently\nresiding at Vissarion, in the Land of the Blue Mountains.  I am at\npresent empowered to act for the National Council in all matters.  Here\nis my credential!\"  As he spoke he handed to the Captain a letter.  It\nwas written in five different languages--Balkan, Turkish, Greek, English,\nand French.  The Captain read it carefully all through, forgetful for the\nmoment that he had seemingly been unable to understand the Gospodar's\nquestion spoken in the Turkish tongue.  Then he answered:\n\n\"I see the document is complete.  May I ask on what subject you wish to\nsee me?\"\n\nGOSPODAR.  \"You are here in a ship of war in Blue Mountain waters, yet\nyou fly no flag of any nation.  You have sent armed men ashore in your\nboats, thus committing an act of war.  The National Council of the Land\nof the Blue Mountains requires to know what nation you serve, and why the\nobligations of international law are thus broken.\"\n\nThe Captain seemed to wait for further speech, but the Gospodar remained\nsilent; whereupon the former spoke.\n\nCAPTAIN.  \"I am responsible to my own--chiefs.  I refuse to answer your\nquestion.\"\n\nThe Gospodar spoke at once in reply.\n\nGOSPODAR.  \"Then, sir, you, as commander of a ship--and especially a ship\nof war--must know that in thus violating national and maritime laws you,\nand all on board this ship, are guilty of an act of piracy.  This is not\neven piracy on the high seas.  You are not merely within territorial\nwaters, but you have invaded a national port.  As you refuse to disclose\nthe nationality of your ship, I accept, as you seem to do, your status as\nthat of a pirate, and shall in due season act accordingly.\"\n\nCAPTAIN (_with manifest hostility_).  \"I accept the responsibility of my\nown acts.  Without admitting your contention, I tell you now that\nwhatever action you take shall be at your own peril and that of your\nNational Council.  Moreover, I have reason to believe that my men who\nwere sent ashore on special service have been beleaguered in a tower\nwhich can be seen from the ship.  Before dawn this morning firing was\nheard from that direction, from which I gather that attack was made on\nthem.  They, being only a small party, may have been murdered.  If such\nbe so, I tell you that you and your miserable little nation, as you call\nit, shall pay such blood-money as you never thought of.  I am responsible\nfor this, and, by Allah! there shall be a great revenge.  You have not in\nall your navy--if navy you have at all--power to cope with even one ship\nlike this, which is but one of many.  My guns shall be trained on Ilsin,\nto which end I have come inshore.  You and your companions have free\nconduct back to port; such is due to the white flag which you fly.\nFifteen minutes will bring you back whence you came.  Go!  And remember\nthat whatever you may do amongst your mountain defiles, at sea you cannot\neven defend yourselves.\"\n\nGOSPODAR (_slowly and in a ringing voice_).  \"The Land of the Blue\nMountains has its own defences on sea and land.  Its people know how to\ndefend themselves.\"\n\nCAPTAIN (_taking out his watch_).  \"It is now close on five bells.  At\nthe first stroke of six bells our guns shall open fire.\"\n\nGOSPODAR (_calmly_).  \"It is my last duty to warn you, sir--and to warn\nall on this ship--that much may happen before even the first stroke of\nsix bells.  Be warned in time, and give over this piratical attack, the\nvery threat of which may be the cause of much bloodshed.\"\n\nCAPTAIN (_violently_).  \"Do you dare to threaten me, and, moreover, my\nship's company?  We are one, I tell you, in this ship; and the last man\nshall perish like the first ere this enterprise fail.  Go!\"\n\nWith a bow, the Gospodar turned and went down the ladder, we following\nhim.  In a couple of minutes the yacht was on her way to the port.\n\n\n\nFROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL.\n\n\n                                                          _July_ 10, 1907.\n\nWhen we turned shoreward after my stormy interview with the pirate\nCaptain--I can call him nothing else at present, Rooke gave orders to a\nquartermaster on the bridge, and _The Lady_ began to make to a little\nnorthward of Ilsin port.  Rooke himself went aft to the wheel-house,\ntaking several men with him.\n\nWhen we were quite near the rocks--the water is so deep here that there\nis no danger--we slowed down, merely drifting along southwards towards\nthe port.  I was myself on the bridge, and could see all over the decks.\nI could also see preparations going on upon the warship.  Ports were\nopened, and the great guns on the turrets were lowered for action.  When\nwe were starboard broadside on to the warship, I saw the port side of the\nsteering-house open, and Rooke's men sliding out what looked like a huge\ngrey crab, which by tackle from within the wheel-house was lowered softly\ninto the sea.  The position of the yacht hid the operation from sight of\nthe warship.   The doors were shut again, and the yacht's pace began to\nquicken.  We ran into the port.  I had a vague idea that Rooke had some\ndesperate project on hand.  Not for nothing had he kept the wheel-house\nlocked on that mysterious crab.\n\nAll along the frontage was a great crowd of eager men.  But they had\nconsiderately left the little mole at the southern entrance, whereon was\na little tower, on whose round top a signal-gun was placed, free for my\nown use.  When I was landed on this pier I went along to the end, and,\nclimbing the narrow stair within, went out on the sloping roof.  I stood\nup, for I was determined to show the Turks that I was not afraid for\nmyself, as they would understand when the bombardment should begin.  It\nwas now but a very few minutes before the fatal hour--six bells.  But all\nthe same I was almost in a state of despair.  It was terrible to think of\nall those poor souls in the town who had done nothing wrong, and who were\nto be wiped out in the coming blood-thirsty, wanton attack.  I raised my\nglasses to see how preparations were going on upon the warship.\n\nAs I looked I had a momentary fear that my eyesight was giving way.  At\none moment I had the deck of the warship focussed with my glasses, and\ncould see every detail as the gunners waited for the word to begin the\nbombardment with the great guns of the barbettes.  The next I saw nothing\nbut the empty sea.  Then in another instant there was the ship as before,\nbut the details were blurred.  I steadied myself against the signal-gun,\nand looked again.  Not more than two, or at the most three, seconds had\nelapsed.  The ship was, for the moment, full in view.  As I looked, she\ngave a queer kind of quick shiver, prow and stern, and then sideways.  It\nwas for all the world like a rat shaken in the mouth of a skilled\nterrier.  Then she remained still, the one placid thing to be seen, for\nall around her the sea seemed to shiver in little independent eddies, as\nwhen water is broken without a current to guide it.\n\nI continued to look, and when the deck was, or seemed, quite still--for\nthe shivering water round the ship kept catching my eyes through the\nouter rays of the lenses--I noticed that nothing was stirring.  The men\nwho had been at the guns were all lying down; the men in the\nfighting-tops had leaned forward or backward, and their arms hung down\nhelplessly.  Everywhere was desolation--in so far as life was concerned.\nEven a little brown bear, which had been seated on the cannon which was\nbeing put into range position, had jumped or fallen on deck, and lay\nthere stretched out--and still.  It was evident that some terrible shock\nhad been given to the mighty war-vessel.  Without a doubt or a thought\nwhy I did so, I turned my eyes towards where _The Lady_ lay, port\nbroadside now to the inside, in the harbour mouth.  I had the key now to\nthe mystery of Rooke's proceedings with the great grey crab.\n\nAs I looked I saw just outside the harbour a thin line of cleaving water.\nThis became more marked each instant, till a steel disc with glass eyes\nthat shone in the light of the sun rose above the water.  It was about\nthe size of a beehive, and was shaped like one.  It made a straight line\nfor the aft of the yacht.  At the same moment, in obedience to some\ncommand, given so quietly that I did not hear it, the men went below--all\nsave some few, who began to open out doors in the port side of the\nwheel-house.  The tackle was run out through an opened gangway on that\nside, and a man stood on the great hook at the lower end, balancing\nhimself by hanging on the chain.  In a few seconds he came up again.  The\nchain tightened and the great grey crab rose over the edge of the deck,\nand was drawn into the wheel-house, the doors of which were closed,\nshutting in a few only of the men.\n\nI waited, quite quiet.  After a space of a few minutes, Captain Rooke in\nhis uniform walked out of the wheel-house.  He entered a small boat,\nwhich had been in the meantime lowered for the purpose, and was rowed to\nthe steps on the mole.  Ascending these, he came directly towards the\nsignal-tower.  When he had ascended and stood beside me, he saluted.\n\n\"Well?\" I asked.\n\n\"All well, sir,\" he answered.  \"We shan't have any more trouble with that\nlot, I think.  You warned that pirate--I wish he had been in truth a\nclean, honest, straightforward pirate, instead of the measly Turkish swab\nhe was--that something might occur before the first stroke of six bells.\nWell, something has occurred, and for him and all his crew that six bells\nwill never sound.  So the Lord fights for the Cross against the Crescent!\nBismillah.  Amen!\"  He said this in a manifestly formal way, as though\ndeclaiming a ritual.  The next instant he went on in the thoroughly\npractical conventional way which was usual to him:\n\n\"May I ask a favour, Mr. Sent Leger?\"\n\n\"A thousand, my dear Rooke,\" I said.  \"You can't ask me anything which I\nshall not freely grant.  And I speak within my brief from the National\nCouncil.  You have saved Ilsin this day, and the Council will thank you\nfor it in due time.\"\n\n\"Me, sir?\" he said, with a look of surprise on his face which seemed\nquite genuine.  \"If you think that, I am well out of it.  I was afraid,\nwhen I woke, that you might court-martial me!\"\n\n\"Court-martial you!  What for?\" I asked, surprised in my turn.\n\n\"For going to sleep on duty, sir!  And the fact is, I was worn out in the\nattack on the Silent Tower last night, and when you had your interview\nwith the pirate--all good pirates forgive me for the blasphemy!\nAmen!--and I knew that everything was going smoothly, I went into the\nwheel-house and took forty winks.\"  He said all this without moving so\nmuch as an eyelid, from which I gathered that he wished absolute silence\nto be observed on my part.  Whilst I was revolving this in my mind he\nwent on:\n\n\"Touching that request, sir.  When I have left you and the Voivode--and\nthe Voivodin, of course--at Vissarion, together with such others as you\nmay choose to bring there with you, may I bring the yacht back here for a\nspell?  I rather think that there is a good deal of cleaning up to be\ndone, and the crew of _The Lady_ with myself are the men to do it.  We\nshall be back by nightfall at the creek.\"\n\n\"Do as you think best, Admiral Rooke,\" I said.\n\n\"Admiral?\"\n\n\"Yes, Admiral.  At present I can only say that tentatively, but by\nto-morrow I am sure the National Council will have confirmed it.  I am\nafraid, old friend, that your squadron will be only your flagship for the\npresent; but later we may do better.\"\n\n\"So long as I am Admiral, your honour, I shall have no other flagship\nthan _The Lady_.  I am not a young man, but, young or old, my pennon\nshall float over no other deck.  Now, one other favour, Mr. Sent Leger?\nIt is a corollary of the first, so I do not hesitate to ask.  May I\nappoint Lieutenant Desmond, my present First Officer, to the command of\nthe battleship?  Of course, he will at first only command the prize crew;\nbut in such case he will fairly expect the confirmation of his rank\nlater.  I had better, perhaps, tell you, sir, that he is a very capable\nseaman, learned in all the sciences that pertain to a battleship, and\nbred in the first navy in the world.\"\n\n\"By all means, Admiral.  Your nomination shall, I think I may promise\nyou, be confirmed.\"\n\nNot another word we spoke.  I returned with him in his boat to _The\nLady_, which was brought to the dock wall, where we were received with\ntumultuous cheering.\n\nI hurried off to my Wife and the Voivode.  Rooke, calling Desmond to him,\nwent on the bridge of _The Lady_, which turned, and went out at terrific\nspeed to the battleship, which was already drifting up northward on the\ntide.\n\n\n\nFROM THE REPORT OF CRISTOFEROS, SCRIBE OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE\nLAND OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.\n\nThe meeting of the National Council, July 6, was but a continuation of\nthat held before the rescue of the Voivodin Vissarion, the members of the\nCouncil having been during the intervening night housed in the Castle of\nVissarion.   When, in the early morning, they met, all were jubilant; for\nlate at night the fire-signal had flamed up from Ilsin with the glad news\nthat the Voivode Peter Vissarion was safe, having been rescued with great\ndaring on an aeroplane by his daughter and the Gospodar Rupert, as the\npeople call him--Mister Rupert Sent Leger, as he is in his British name\nand degree.\n\nWhilst the Council was sitting, word came that a great peril to the town\nof Ilsin had been averted.  A war-vessel acknowledging to no nationality,\nand therefore to be deemed a pirate, had threatened to bombard the town;\nbut just before the time fixed for the fulfilment of her threat, she was\nshaken to such an extent by some sub-aqueous means that, though she\nherself was seemingly uninjured, nothing was left alive on board.  Thus\nthe Lord preserves His own!  The consideration of this, as well as the\nother incident, was postponed until the coming Voivode and the Gospodar\nRupert, together with who were already on their way hither.\n\n\n\nTHE SAME (LATER IN THE SAME DAY).\n\n\nThe Council resumed its sitting at four o'clock.  The Voivode Peter\nVissarion and the Voivodin Teuta had arrived with the \"Gospodar Rupert,\"\nas the mountaineers call him (Mr. Rupert Sent Leger) on the armoured\nyacht he calls _The Lady_.  The National Council showed great pleasure\nwhen the Voivode entered the hall in which the Council met.  He seemed\nmuch gratified by the reception given to him.  Mr. Rupert Sent Leger, by\nthe express desire of the Council, was asked to be present at the\nmeeting.  He took a seat at the bottom of the hall, and seemed to prefer\nto remain there, though asked by the President of the Council to sit at\nthe top of the table with himself and the Voivode.\n\nWhen the formalities of such Councils had been completed, the Voivode\nhanded to the President a memorandum of his report on his secret mission\nto foreign Courts on behalf of the National Council.  He then explained\nat length, for the benefit of the various members of the Council, the\nbroad results of his mission.  The result was, he said, absolutely\nsatisfactory.  Everywhere he had been received with distinguished\ncourtesy, and given a sympathetic hearing.  Several of the Powers\nconsulted had made delay in giving final answers, but this, he explained,\nwas necessarily due to new considerations arising from the international\ncomplications which were universally dealt with throughout the world as\n\"the Balkan Crisis.\"  In time, however (the Voivode went on), these\nmatters became so far declared as to allow the waiting Powers to form\ndefinite judgment--which, of course, they did not declare to him--as to\ntheir own ultimate action.  The final result--if at this initial stage\nsuch tentative setting forth of their own attitude in each case can be so\nnamed--was that he returned full of hope (founded, he might say, upon a\njustifiable personal belief) that the Great Powers throughout the\nworld--North, South, East, and West--were in thorough sympathy with the\nLand of the Blue Mountains in its aspirations for the continuance of its\nfreedom.  \"I also am honoured,\" he continued, \"to bring to you, the Great\nCouncil of the nation, the assurance of protection against unworthy\naggression on the part of neighbouring nations of present greater\nstrength.\"\n\nWhilst he was speaking, the Gospodar Rupert was writing a few words on a\nstrip of paper, which he sent up to the President.  When the Voivode had\nfinished speaking, there was a prolonged silence.  The President rose,\nand in a hush said that the Council would like to hear Mr. Rupert Sent\nLeger, who had a communication to make regarding certain recent events.\n\nMr. Rupert Sent Leger rose, and reported how, since he had been entrusted\nby the Council with the rescue of the Voivode Peter of Vissarion, he had,\nby aid of the Voivodin, effected the escape of the Voivode from the\nSilent Tower; also that, following this happy event, the mountaineers,\nwho had made a great cordon round the Tower so soon as it was known that\nthe Voivode had been imprisoned within it, had stormed it in the night.\nAs a determined resistance was offered by the marauders, who had used it\nas a place of refuge, none of these escaped.  He then went on to tell how\nhe sought interview with the Captain of the strange warship, which,\nwithout flying any flag, invaded our waters.  He asked the President to\ncall on me to read the report of that meeting.  This, in obedience to his\ndirection, I did.  The acquiescent murmuring of the Council showed how\nthoroughly they endorsed Mr. Sent Leger's words and acts.\n\nWhen I resumed my seat, Mr. Sent Leger described how, just before the\ntime fixed by the \"pirate Captain\"--so he designated him, as did every\nspeaker thereafter--the warship met with some under-sea accident, which\nhad a destructive effect on all on board her.  Then he added certain\nwords, which I give verbatim, as I am sure that others will some time\nwish to remember them in their exactness:\n\n\"By the way, President and Lords of the Council, I trust I may ask you to\nconfirm Captain Rooke, of the armoured yacht _The Lady_, to be Admiral of\nthe Squadron of the Land of the Blue Mountains, and also Captain\n(tentatively) Desmond, late First-Lieutenant of _The Lady_, to the\ncommand of the second warship of our fleet--the as yet unnamed vessel,\nwhose former Captain threatened to bombard Ilsin.  My Lords, Admiral\nRooke has done great service to the Land of the Blue Mountains, and\ndeserves well at your hands.  You will have in him, I am sure, a great\nofficial.  One who will till his last breath give you good and loyal\nservice.\"\n\nHe had sat down, the President put to the Council resolutions, which were\npassed by acclamation.  Admiral Rooke was given command of the navy, and\nCaptain Desmond confirmed in his appointment to the captaincy of the new\nship, which was, by a further resolution, named _The Gospodar Rupert_.\n\nIn thanking the Council for acceding to his request, and for the great\nhonour done him in the naming of the ship, Mr. Sent Leger said:\n\n\"May I ask that the armoured yacht _The Lady_ be accepted by you, the\nNational Council, on behalf of the nation, as a gift on behalf of the\ncause of freedom from the Voivodin Teuta?\"\n\nIn response to the mighty cheer of the Council with which the splendid\ngift was accepted the Gospodar Rupert--Mr. Sent Leger--bowed, and went\nquietly out of the room.\n\nAs no agenda of the meeting had been prepared, there was for a time, not\nsilence, but much individual conversation.  In the midst of it the\nVoivode rose up, whereupon there was a strict silence.  All listened with\nan intensity of eagerness whilst he spoke.\n\n\"President and Lords of the Council, Archbishop, and Vladika, I should\nbut ill show my respect did I hesitate to tell you at this the first\nopportunity I have had of certain matters personal primarily to myself,\nbut which, in the progress of recent events, have come to impinge on the\naffairs of the nation.  Until I have done so, I shall not feel that I\nhave done a duty, long due to you or your predecessors in office, and\nwhich I hope you will allow me to say that I have only kept back for\npurposes of statecraft.  May I ask that you will come back with me in\nmemory to the year 1890, when our struggle against Ottoman aggression,\nlater on so successfully brought to a close, was begun.  We were then in\na desperate condition.  Our finances had run so low that we could not\npurchase even the bread which we required.  Nay, more, we could not\nprocure through the National Exchequer what we wanted more than\nbread--arms of modern effectiveness; for men may endure hunger and yet\nfight well, as the glorious past of our country has proved again and\nagain and again.  But when our foes are better armed than we are, the\npenalty is dreadful to a nation small as our own is in number, no matter\nhow brave their hearts.  In this strait I myself had to secretly raise a\nsufficient sum of money to procure the weapons we needed.  To this end I\nsought the assistance of a great merchant-prince, to whom our nation as\nwell as myself was known.  He met me in the same generous spirit which he\nhad shown to other struggling nationalities throughout a long and\nhonourable career.  When I pledged to him as security my own estates, he\nwished to tear up the bond, and only under pressure would he meet my\nwishes in this respect.  Lords of the Council, it was his money, thus\ngenerously advanced, which procured for us the arms with which we hewed\nout our freedom.\n\n\"Not long ago that noble merchant--and here I trust you will pardon me\nthat I am so moved as to perhaps appear to suffer in want of respect to\nthis great Council--this noble merchant passed to his account--leaving to\na near kinsman of his own the royal fortune which he had amassed.  Only a\nfew hours ago that worthy kinsman of the benefactor of our nation made it\nknown to me that in his last will he had bequeathed to me, by secret\ntrust, the whole of those estates which long ago I had forfeited by\neffluxion of time, inasmuch as I had been unable to fulfil the terms of\nmy voluntary bond.  It grieves me to think that I have had to keep you so\nlong in ignorance of the good thought and wishes and acts of this great\nman.\n\n\"But it was by his wise counsel, fortified by my own judgment, that I was\nsilent; for, indeed, I feared, as he did, lest in our troublous times\nsome doubting spirit without our boundaries, or even within it, might\nmistrust the honesty of my purposes for public good, because I was no\nlonger one whose whole fortune was invested within our confines.  This\nprince-merchant, the great English Roger Melton--let his name be for ever\ngraven on the hearts of our people!--kept silent during his own life, and\nenjoined on others to come after him to keep secret from the men of the\nBlue Mountains that secret loan made to me on their behalf, lest in their\neyes I, who had striven to be their friend and helper, should suffer\nwrong repute.  But, happily, he has left me free to clear myself in your\neyes.  Moreover, by arranging to have--under certain contingencies, which\nhave come to pass--the estates which were originally my own retransferred\nto me, I have no longer the honour of having given what I could to the\nnational cause.  All such now belongs to him; for it was his money--and\nhis only--which purchased our national armament.\n\n\"His worthy kinsman you already know, for he has not only been amongst\nyou for many months, but has already done you good service in his own\nperson.  He it was who, as a mighty warrior, answered the summons of the\nVladika when misfortune came upon my house in the capture by enemies of\nmy dear daughter, the Voivodin Teuta, whom you hold in your hearts; who,\nwith a chosen band of our brothers, pursued the marauders, and himself,\nby a deed of daring and prowess, of which poets shall hereafter sing,\nsaved her, when hope itself seemed to be dead, from their ruthless hands,\nand brought her back to us; who administered condign punishment to the\nmiscreants who had dared to so wrong her.  He it was who later took me,\nyour servant, out of the prison wherein another band of Turkish\nmiscreants held me captive; rescued me, with the help of my dear\ndaughter, whom he had already freed, whilst I had on my person the\ndocuments of international secrecy of which I have already advised\nyou--rescued me whilst I had been as yet unsubjected to the indignity of\nsearch.\n\n\"Beyond this you know now that of which I was in partial ignorance: how\nhe had, through the skill and devotion of your new Admiral, wrought\ndestruction on a hecatomb of our malignant foes.  You who have received\nfor the nation the splendid gift of the little warship, which already\nrepresents a new era in naval armament, can understand the great-souled\ngenerosity of the man who has restored the vast possessions of my House.\nOn our way hither from Ilsin, Rupert Sent Leger made known to me the\nterms of the trust of his noble uncle, Roger Melton, and--believe me that\nhe did so generously, with a joy that transcended my own--restored to the\nlast male of the Vissarion race the whole inheritance of a noble line.\n\n\"And now, my Lords of the Council, I come to another matter, in which I\nfind myself in something of a difficulty, for I am aware that in certain\nways you actually know more of it than even I myself do.  It is regarding\nthe marriage of my daughter to Rupert Sent Leger.  It is known to me that\nthe matter has been brought before you by the Archbishop, who, as\nguardian of my daughter during my absence on the service of the nation,\nwished to obtain your sanction, as till my return he held her safety in\ntrust.  This was so, not from any merit of mine, but because she, in her\nown person, had undertaken for the service of our nation a task of almost\nincredible difficulty.  My Lords, were she child of another father, I\nshould extol to the skies her bravery, her self-devotion, her loyalty to\nthe land she loves.  Why, then, should I hesitate to speak of her deeds\nin fitting terms, since it is my duty, my glory, to hold them in higher\nhonour than can any in this land?  I shall not shame her--or even\nmyself--by being silent when such a duty urges me to speak, as Voivode,\nas trusted envoy of our nation, as father.  Ages hence loyal men and\nwomen of our Land of the Blue Mountains will sing her deeds in song and\ntell them in story.  Her name, Teuta, already sacred in these regions,\nwhere it was held by a great Queen, and honoured by all men, will\nhereafter be held as a symbol and type of woman's devotion.  Oh, my\nLords, we pass along the path of life, the best of us but a little time\nmarching in the sunlight between gloom and gloom, and it is during that\nmarch that we must be judged for the future.  This brave woman has won\nknightly spurs as well as any Paladin of old.  So is it meet that ere she\nmight mate with one worthy of her you, who hold in your hands the safety\nand honour of the State, should give your approval.  To you was it given\nto sit in judgment on the worth of this gallant Englisher, now my son.\nYou judged him then, before you had seen his valour, his strength, and\nskill exercised on behalf of a national cause.  You judged wisely, oh, my\nbrothers, and out of a grateful heart I thank you one and all for it.\nWell has he justified your trust by his later acts.  When, in obedience\nto the summons of the Vladika, he put the nation in a blaze and ranged\nour boundaries with a ring of steel, he did so unknowing that what was\ndearest to him in the world was at stake.  He saved my daughter's honour\nand happiness, and won her safety by an act of valour that outvies any\ntold in history.  He took my daughter with him to bring me out from the\nSilent Tower on the wings of the air, when earth had for me no\npossibility of freedom--I, that had even then in my possession the\ndocuments involving other nations which the Soldan would fain have\npurchased with the half of his empire.\n\n\"Henceforth to me, Lords of the Council, this brave man must ever be as a\nson of my heart, and I trust that in his name grandsons of my own may\nkeep in bright honour the name which in glorious days of old my fathers\nmade illustrious.  Did I know how adequately to thank you for your\ninterest in my child, I would yield up to you my very soul in thanks.\"\n\nThe speech of the Voivode was received with the honour of the Blue\nMountains--the drawing and raising of handjars.\n\n\n\nFROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL.\n\n\n                                                          _July_ 14, 1907.\n\nFor nearly a week we waited for some message from Constantinople, fully\nexpecting either a declaration of war, or else some inquiry so couched as\nto make war an inevitable result.  The National Council remained on at\nVissarion as the guests of the Voivode, to whom, in accordance with my\nuncle's will, I had prepared to re-transfer all his estates.  He was, by\nthe way, unwilling at first to accept, and it was only when I showed him\nUncle Roger's letter, and made him read the Deed of Transfer prepared in\nanticipation by Mr. Trent, that he allowed me to persuade him.  Finally\nhe said:\n\n\"As you, my good friends, have so arranged, I must accept, be it only in\nhonour to the wishes of the dead.  But remember, I only do so but for the\npresent, reserving to myself the freedom to withdraw later if I so\ndesire.\"\n\nBut Constantinople was silent.  The whole nefarious scheme was one of the\n\"put-up jobs\" which are part of the dirty work of a certain order of\nstatecraft--to be accepted if successful; to be denied in case of\nfailure.\n\nThe matter stood thus: Turkey had thrown the dice--and lost.  Her men\nwere dead; her ship was forfeit.  It was only some ten days after the\nwarship was left derelict with every living thing--that is, everything\nthat had been living--with its neck broken, as Rooke informed me, when he\nbrought the ship down the creek, and housed it in the dock behind the\narmoured gates--that we saw an item in _The Roma_ copied from _The\nConstantinople Journal_ of July 9:\n\n    \"LOSS OF AN OTTOMAN IRONCLAD WITH ALL HANDS.\n\n    \"News has been received at Constantinople of the total loss, with all\n    hands, of one of the newest and finest warships in the Turkish\n    fleet--_The Mahmoud_, Captain Ali Ali--which foundered in a storm on\n    the night of July 5, some distance off Cabrera, in the Balearic\n    Isles.  There were no survivors, and no wreckage was discovered by\n    the ships which went in relief--the _Pera_ and the _Mustapha_--or\n    reported from anywhere along the shores of the islands, of which\n    exhaustive search was made.  _The Mahmoud_ was double-manned, as she\n    carried a full extra crew sent on an educational cruise on the most\n    perfectly scientifically equipped warship on service in the\n    Mediterranean waters.\"\n\nWhen the Voivode and I talked over the matter, he said:\n\n\"After all, Turkey is a shrewd Power.  She certainly seems to know when\nshe is beaten, and does not intend to make a bad thing seem worse in the\neyes of the world.\"\n\nWell, 'tis a bad wind that blows good to nobody.  As _The Mahmoud_ was\nlost off the Balearics, it cannot have been her that put the marauders on\nshore and trained her big guns on Ilsin.  We take it, therefore, that the\nlatter must have been a pirate, and as we have taken her derelict in our\nwaters, she is now ours in all ways.  Anyhow, she is ours, and is the\nfirst ship of her class in the navy of the Blue Mountains.  I am inclined\nto think that even if she was--or is still--a Turkish ship, Admiral Rooke\nwould not be inclined to let her go.  As for Captain Desmond, I think he\nwould go straight out of his mind if such a thing was to be even\nsuggested to him.\n\nIt will be a pity if we have any more trouble, for life here is very\nhappy with us all now.  The Voivode is, I think, like a man in a dream.\nTeuta is ideally happy, and the real affection which sprang up between\nthem when she and Aunt Janet met is a joy to think of.  I had posted\nTeuta about her, so that when they should meet my wife might not, by any\ninadvertence, receive or cause any pain.  But the moment Teuta saw her\nshe ran straight over to her and lifted her in her strong young arms,\nand, raising her up as one would lift a child, kissed her.  Then, when\nshe had put her sitting in the chair from which she had arisen when we\nentered the room, she knelt down before her, and put her face down in her\nlap.  Aunt Janet's face was a study; I myself could hardly say whether at\nthe first moment surprise or joy predominated.  But there could be no\ndoubt about it the instant after.  She seemed to beam with happiness.\nWhen Teuta knelt to her, she could only say:\n\n\"My dear, my dear, I am glad!  Rupert's wife, you and I must love each\nother very much.\"  Seeing that they were laughing and crying in each\nother's arms, I thought it best to come away and leave them alone.  And I\ndidn't feel a bit lonely either when I was out of sight of them.  I knew\nthat where those two dear women were there was a place for my own heart.\n\nWhen I came back, Teuta was sitting on Aunt Janet's knee.  It seemed\nrather stupendous for the old lady, for Teuta is such a splendid creature\nthat even when she sits on my own knee and I catch a glimpse of us in\nsome mirror, I cannot but notice what a nobly-built girl she is.\n\nMy wife was jumping up as soon as I was seen, but Aunt Janet held her\ntight to her, and said:\n\n\"Don't stir, dear.  It is such happiness to me to have you there.  Rupert\nhas always been my 'little boy,' and, in spite of all his being such a\ngiant, he is so still.  And so you, that he loves, must be my little\ngirl--in spite of all your beauty and your strength--and sit on my knee,\ntill you can place there a little one that shall be dear to us all, and\nthat shall let me feel my youth again.  When first I saw you I was\nsurprised, for, somehow, though I had never seen you nor even heard of\nyou, I seemed to know your face.  Sit where you are, dear.  It is only\nRupert--and we both love him.\"\n\nTeuta looked at me, flushing rosily; but she sat quiet, and drew the old\nlady's white head on her young breast.\n\n\n\nJANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.\n\n\n                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.\n\nI used to think that whenever Rupert should get married or start on the\nway to it by getting engaged--I would meet his future wife with something\nof the same affection that I have always had for himself.  But I know now\nthat what was really in my mind was _jealousy_, and that I was really\nfighting against my own instincts, and pretending to myself that I was\nnot jealous.  Had I ever had the faintest idea that she would be anything\nthe least like Teuta, that sort of feeling should never have had even a\nfoothold.  No wonder my dear boy is in love with her, for, truth to tell,\nI am in love with her myself.  I don't think I ever met a creature--a\nwoman creature, of course, I mean--with so many splendid qualities.  I\nalmost fear to say it, lest it should seem to myself wrong; but I think\nshe is as good as a woman as Rupert is as a man.  And what more than that\ncan I say?  I thought I loved her and trusted her, and knew her all I\ncould, until this morning.\n\nI was in my own room, as it is still called.  For, though Rupert tells me\nin confidence that under his uncle's will the whole estate of Vissarion,\nCastle and all, really belongs to the Voivode, and though the Voivode has\nbeen persuaded to accept the position, he (the Voivode) will not allow\nanything to be changed.  He will not even hear a word of my going, or\nchanging my room, or anything.  And Rupert backs him up in it, and Teuta\ntoo.  So what am I to do but let the dears have their way?\n\nWell, this morning, when Rupert was with the Voivode at a meeting of the\nNational Council in the Great Hall, Teuta came to me, and (after closing\nthe door and bolting it, which surprised me a little) came and knelt down\nbeside me, and put her face in my lap.  I stroked her beautiful black\nhair, and said:\n\n\"What is it, Teuta darling?  Is there any trouble?  And why did you bolt\nthe door?  Has anything happened to Rupert?\"  When she looked up I saw\nthat her beautiful black eyes, with the stars in them, were overflowing\nwith tears not yet shed.  But she smiled through them, and the tears did\nnot fall.  When I saw her smile my heart was eased, and I said without\nthinking: \"Thank God, darling, Rupert is all right.\"\n\n\"I thank God, too, dear Aunt Janet!\" she said softly; and I took her in\nmy arms and laid her head on my breast.\n\n\"Go on, dear,\" I said; \"tell me what it is that troubles you?\"  This time\nI saw the tears drop, as she lowered her head and hid her face from me.\n\n\"I'm afraid I have deceived you, Aunt Janet, and that you will\nnot--cannot--forgive me.\"\n\n\"Lord save you, child!\" I said, \"there's nothing that you could do that I\ncould not and would not forgive.  Not that you would ever do anything\nbase, for that is the only thing that is hard to forgive.  Tell me now\nwhat troubles you.\"\n\nShe looked up in my eyes fearlessly, this time with only the signs of\ntears that had been, and said proudly:\n\n\"Nothing base, Aunt Janet.  My father's daughter would not willingly be\nbase.  I do not think she could.  Moreover, had I ever done anything base\nI should not be here, for--for--I should never have been Rupert's wife!\"\n\n\"Then what is it?  Tell your old Aunt Janet, dearie.\"  She answered me\nwith another question:\n\n\"Aunt Janet, do you know who I am, and how I first met Rupert?\"\n\n\"You are the Voivodin Teuta Vissarion--the daughter of the Voivode--Or,\nrather, you were; you are now Mrs. Rupert Sent Leger.  For he is still an\nEnglishman, and a good subject of our noble King.\"\n\n\"Yes, Aunt Janet,\" she said, \"I am that, and proud to be it--prouder than\nI would be were I my namesake, who was Queen in the old days.  But how\nand where did I see Rupert first?\"  I did not know, and frankly told her\nso.  So she answered her question herself:\n\n\"I saw him first in his own room at night.\"  I knew in my heart that in\nwhatever she did had been nothing wrong, so I sat silent waiting for her\nto go on:\n\n\"I was in danger, and in deadly fear.  I was afraid I might die--not that\nI fear death--and I wanted help and warmth.  I was not dressed as I am\nnow!\"\n\nOn the instant it came to me how I knew her face, even the first time I\nhad seen it.  I wished to help her out of the embarrassing part of her\nconfidence, so I said:\n\n\"Dearie, I think I know.  Tell me, child, will you put on the frock . . .\nthe dress . . . costume you wore that night, and let me see you in it?\nIt is not mere idle curiosity, my child, but something far, far above\nsuch idle folly.\"\n\n\"Wait for me a minute, Aunt Janet,\" she said, as she rose up; \"I shall\nnot be long.\"  Then she left the room.\n\nIn a very few minutes she was back.  Her appearance might have frightened\nsome people, for she was clad only in a shroud.  Her feet were bare, and\nshe walked across the room with the gait of an empress, and stood before\nme with her eyes modestly cast down.  But when presently she looked up\nand caught my eyes, a smile rippled over her face.  She threw herself\nonce more before me on her knees, and embraced me as she said:\n\n\"I was afraid I might frighten you, dear.\"  I knew I could truthfully\nreassure her as to that, so I proceeded to do so:\n\n\"Do not worry yourself, my dear.  I am not by nature timid.  I come of a\nfighting stock which has sent out heroes, and I belong to a family\nwherein is the gift of Second Sight.  Why should we fear?  We know!\nMoreover, I saw you in that dress before.  Teuta, I saw you and Rupert\nmarried!\"  This time she herself it was that seemed disconcerted.\n\n\"Saw us married!  How on earth did you manage to be there?\"\n\n\"I was not there.  My Seeing was long before!  Tell me, dear, what day,\nor rather what night, was it that you first saw Rupert?\"  She answered\nsadly:\n\n\"I do not know.  Alas!  I lost count of the days as I lay in the tomb in\nthat dreary Crypt.\"\n\n\"Was your--your clothing wet that night?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.  I had to leave the Crypt, for a great flood was out, and the\nchurch was flooded.  I had to seek help--warmth--for I feared I might\ndie.  Oh, I was not, as I have told you, afraid of death.  But I had\nundertaken a terrible task to which I had pledged myself.  It was for my\nfather's sake, and the sake of the Land, and I felt that it was a part of\nmy duty to live.  And so I lived on, when death would have been relief.\nIt was to tell you all about this that I came to your room to-day.  But\nhow did you see me--us--married?\"\n\n\"Ah, my child!\" I answered, \"that was before the marriage took place.\nThe morn after the night that you came in the wet, when, having been\ntroubled in uncanny dreaming, I came to see if Rupert was a'richt, I lost\nremembrance o' my dreaming, for the floor was all wet, and that took off\nmy attention.  But later, the morn after Rupert used his fire in his room\nfor the first time, I told him what I had dreamt; for, lassie, my dear, I\nsaw ye as bride at that weddin' in fine lace o'er yer shrood, and\norange-flowers and ithers in yer black hair; an' I saw the stars in yer\nbonny een--the een I love.  But oh, my dear, when I saw the shrood, and\nkent what it might mean, I expeckit to see the worms crawl round yer\nfeet.  But do ye ask yer man to tell ye what I tell't him that morn.\n'Twill interest ye to know how the hairt o' men can learn by dreams.  Has\nhe ever tellt ye aught o' this?\"\n\n\"No, dear,\" she said simply.  \"I think that perhaps he was afraid that\none or other of us, if not both, might be upset by it if he did.  You\nsee, he did not tell you anything at all of our meeting, though I am sure\nthat he will be glad when he knows that we both know all about it, and\nhave told each other everything.\"\n\nThat was very sweet of her, and very thoughtful in all ways, so I said\nthat which I thought would please her best--that is, the truth:\n\n\"Ah, lassie, that is what a wife should be--what a wife should do.\nRupert is blessed and happy to have his heart in your keeping.\"\n\nI knew from the added warmth of her kiss what I had said had pleased her.\n\n_Letter from Ernest Roger Halbard Melton_, _Humcroft_, _Salop_, _to\nRupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _Land of the Blue Mountains_.\n\n                                                          _July_ 29, 1907.\n\n    MY DEAR COUSIN RUPERT,\n\n    We have heard such glowing accounts of Vissarion that I am coming out\n    to see you.  As you are yourself now a landowner, you will understand\n    that my coming is not altogether a pleasure.  Indeed, it is a duty\n    first.  When my father dies I shall be head of the family--the family\n    of which Uncle Roger, to whom we were related, was a member.  It is\n    therefore meet and fitting that I should know something of our family\n    branches and of their Seats.  I am not giving you time for much\n    warning, so am coming on immediately--in fact, I shall arrive almost\n    as soon as this letter.  But I want to catch you in the middle of\n    your tricks.  I hear that the Blue Mountaineer girls are peaches, so\n    don't send them _all_ away when you hear I'm coming!\n\n    Do send a yacht up to Fiume to meet me.  I hear you have all sorts of\n    craft at Vissarion.  The MacSkelpie, I hear, said you received her as\n    a Queen; so I hope you will do the decent by one of your own flesh\n    and blood, and the future Head of the House at that.  I shan't bring\n    much of a retinue with me.  _I_ wasn't made a billionaire by old\n    Roger, so can only take my modest \"man Friday\"--whose name is\n    Jenkinson, and a Cockney at that.  So don't have too much gold lace\n    and diamond-hilted scimitars about, like a good chap, or else he'll\n    want the very worst--his wyges ryzed.  That old image Rooke that came\n    over for Miss McS., and whom by chance I saw at the attorney man's,\n    might pilot me down from Fiume.  The old\n    gentleman-by-Act-of-Parliament Mr. Bingham Trent (I suppose he has\n    hyphened it by this time) told me that Miss McS. said he \"did her\n    proud\" when she went over under his charge.  I shall be at Fiume on\n    the evening of Wednesday, and shall stay at the Europa, which is, I\n    am told, the least indecent hotel in the place.  So you know where to\n    find me, or any of your attendant demons can know, in case I am to\n    suffer \"substituted service.\"\n\n                                                 Your affectionate Cousin,\n                                              ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON.\n\n_Letter from Admiral Rooke to the Gospodar Rupert_.\n\n                                                         _August_ 1, 1907.\n\n    SIR,\n\n    In obedience to your explicit direction that I should meet Mr. Ernest\n    R. H. Melton at Fiume, and report to you exactly what occurred,\n    \"without keeping anything back,\"--as you will remember you said, I\n    beg to report.\n\n    I brought the steam-yacht _Trent_ to Fiume, arriving there on the\n    morning of Thursday.  At 11.30 p.m.  I went to meet the train from\n    St. Peter, due 11.40.  It was something late, arriving just as the\n    clock was beginning to strike midnight.  Mr. Melton was on board, and\n    with him his valet Jenkinson.  I am bound to say that he did not seem\n    very pleased with his journey, and expressed much disappointment at\n    not seeing Your Honour awaiting him.  I explained, as you directed,\n    that you had to attend with the Voivode Vissarion and the Vladika the\n    National Council, which met at Plazac, or that otherwise you would\n    have done yourself the pleasure of coming to meet him.  I had, of\n    course, reserved rooms (the Prince of Wales's suite), for him at the\n    Re d'Ungheria, and had waiting the carriage which the proprietor had\n    provided for the Prince of Wales when he stayed there.  Mr. Melton\n    took his valet with him (on the box-seat), and I followed in a\n    _Stadtwagen_ with the luggage.  When I arrived, I found the _maitre\n    d'hotel_ in a stupor of concern.  The English nobleman, he said, had\n    found fault with everything, and used to him language to which he was\n    not accustomed.  I quieted him, telling him that the stranger was\n    probably unused to foreign ways, and assuring him that Your Honour\n    had every faith in him.  He announced himself satisfied and happy at\n    the assurance.  But I noticed that he promptly put everything in the\n    hands of the headwaiter, telling him to satisfy the milor at any\n    cost, and then went away to some urgent business in Vienna.  Clever\n    man!\n\n    I took Mr. Melton's orders for our journey in the morning, and asked\n    if there was anything for which he wished.  He simply said to me:\n\n    \"Everything is rotten.  Go to hell, and shut the door after you!\"\n    His man, who seems a very decent little fellow, though he is as vain\n    as a peacock, and speaks with a Cockney accent which is simply\n    terrible, came down the passage after me, and explained \"on his own,\"\n    as he expressed it, that his master, \"Mr. Ernest,\" was upset by the\n    long journey, and that I was not to mind.  I did not wish to make him\n    uncomfortable, so I explained that I minded nothing except what Your\n    Honour wished; that the steam-yacht would be ready at 7 a.m.; and\n    that I should be waiting in the hotel from that time on till Mr.\n    Melton cared to start, to bring him aboard.\n\n    In the morning I waited till the man Jenkinson came and told me that\n    Mr. Ernest would start at ten.  I asked if he would breakfast on\n    board; he answered that he would take his _cafe-complet_ at the\n    hotel, but breakfast on board.\n\n    We left at ten, and took the electric pinnace out to the _Trent_,\n    which lay, with steam up, in the roads.  Breakfast was served on\n    board, by his orders, and presently he came up on the bridge, where I\n    was in command.  He brought his man Jenkinson with him.  Seeing me\n    there, and not (I suppose) understanding that I was in command, he\n    unceremoniously ordered me to go on the deck.  Indeed, he named a\n    place much lower.  I made a sign of silence to the quartermaster at\n    the wheel, who had released the spokes, and was going, I feared, to\n    make some impertinent remark.  Jenkinson joined me presently, and\n    said, as some sort of explanation of his master's discourtesy (of\n    which he was manifestly ashamed), if not as an amende:\n\n    \"The governor is in a hell of a wax this morning.\"\n\n    When we got in sight of Meleda, Mr. Melton sent for me and asked me\n    where we were to land.  I told him that, unless he wished to the\n    contrary, we were to run to Vissarion; but that my instructions were\n    to land at whatever port he wished.  Whereupon he told me that he\n    wished to stay the night at some place where he might be able to see\n    some \"life.\"  He was pleased to add something, which I presume he\n    thought jocular, about my being able to \"coach\" him in such matters,\n    as doubtless even \"an old has-been like you\" had still some sort of\n    an eye for a pretty girl.  I told him as respectfully as I could that\n    I had no knowledge whatever on such subjects, which were possibly of\n    some interest to younger men, but of none to me.  He said no more; so\n    after waiting for further orders, but without receiving any, I said:\n\n    \"I suppose, sir, we shall run to Vissarion?\"\n\n    \"Run to the devil, if you like!\" was his reply, as he turned away.\n    When we arrived in the creek at Vissarion, he seemed much\n    milder--less aggressive in his manner; but when he heard that you\n    were detained at Plazac, he got rather \"fresh\"--I use the American\n    term--again.  I greatly feared there would be a serious misfortune\n    before we got into the Castle, for on the dock was Julia, the wife of\n    Michael, the Master of the Wine, who is, as you know, very beautiful.\n    Mr. Melton seemed much taken with her; and she, being flattered by\n    the attention of a strange gentleman and Your Honour's kinsman, put\n    aside the stand-offishness of most of the Blue Mountain women.\n    Whereupon Mr. Melton, forgetting himself, took her in his arms and\n    kissed her.  Instantly there was a hubbub.  The mountaineers present\n    drew their handjars, and almost on the instant sudden death appeared\n    to be amongst us.  Happily the men waited as Michael, who had just\n    arrived on the quay-wall as the outrage took place, ran forward,\n    wheeling his handjar round his head, and manifestly intending to\n    decapitate Mr. Melton.  On the instant--I am sorry to say it, for it\n    created a terribly bad effect--Mr. Melton dropped on his knees in a\n    state of panic.  There was just this good use in it--that there was a\n    pause of a few seconds.  During that time the little Cockney valet,\n    who has the heart of a man in him, literally burst his way forward,\n    and stood in front of his master in boxing attitude, calling out:\n\n    \"'Ere, come on, the 'ole lot of ye! 'E ain't done no 'arm.  He honly\n    kissed the gal, as any man would.  If ye want to cut off somebody's\n    'ed, cut off mine.  I ain't afride!\"  There was such genuine pluck in\n    this, and it formed so fine a contrast to the other's craven attitude\n    (forgive me, Your Honour; but you want the truth!), that I was glad\n    he was an Englishman, too.  The mountaineers recognized his spirit,\n    and saluted with their handjars, even Michael amongst the number.\n    Half turning his head, the little man said in a fierce whisper:\n\n    \"Buck up, guv'nor!  Get up, or they'll slice ye!  'Ere's Mr. Rooke;\n    'e'll see ye through it.\"\n\n    By this time the men were amenable to reason, and when I reminded\n    them that Mr. Melton was Your Honour's cousin, they put aside their\n    handjars and went about their work.  I asked Mr. Melton to follow,\n    and led the way to the Castle.\n\n    When we got close to the great entrance within the walled courtyard,\n    we found a large number of the servants gathered, and with them many\n    of the mountaineers, who have kept an organized guard all round the\n    Castle ever since the abducting of the Voivodin.  As both Your Honour\n    and the Voivode were away at Plazac, the guard had for the time been\n    doubled.  When the steward came and stood in the doorway, the\n    servants stood off somewhat, and the mountaineers drew back to the\n    farther sides and angles of the courtyard.  The Voivodin had, of\n    course, been informed of the guest's (your cousin) coming, and came\n    to meet him in the old custom of the Blue Mountains.  As Your Honour\n    only came to the Blue Mountains recently, and as no occasion has been\n    since then of illustrating the custom since the Voivode was away, and\n    the Voivodin then believed to be dead, perhaps I, who have lived here\n    so long, may explain:\n\n    When to an old Blue Mountain house a guest comes whom it is wished to\n    do honour, the Lady, as in the vernacular the mistress of the house\n    is called, comes herself to meet the guest at the door--or, rather,\n    _outside_ the door--so that she can herself conduct him within.  It\n    is a pretty ceremony, and it is said that of old in kingly days the\n    monarch always set much store by it.  The custom is that, when she\n    approaches the honoured guest (he need not be royal), she bends--or\n    more properly kneels--before him and kisses his hand.  It has been\n    explained by historians that the symbolism is that the woman, showing\n    obedience to her husband, as the married woman of the Blue Mountains\n    always does, emphasizes that obedience to her husband's guest.  The\n    custom is always observed in its largest formality when a young wife\n    receives for the first time a guest, and especially one whom her\n    husband wishes to honour.  The Voivodin was, of course, aware that\n    Mr. Melton was your kinsman, and naturally wished to make the\n    ceremony of honour as marked as possible, so as to show overtly her\n    sense of her husband's worth.\n\n    When we came into the courtyard, I held back, of course, for the\n    honour is entirely individual, and is never extended to any other, no\n    matter how worthy he may be.  Naturally Mr. Melton did not know the\n    etiquette of the situation, and so for that is not to be blamed.  He\n    took his valet with him when, seeing someone coming to the door, he\n    went forward.  I thought he was going to rush to his welcomer.  Such,\n    though not in the ritual, would have been natural in a young kinsman\n    wishing to do honour to the bride of his host, and would to anyone\n    have been both understandable and forgivable.  It did not occur to me\n    at the time, but I have since thought that perhaps he had not then\n    heard of Your Honour's marriage, which I trust you will, in justice\n    to the young gentleman, bear in mind when considering the matter.\n    Unhappily, however, he did not show any such eagerness.  On the\n    contrary, he seemed to make a point of showing indifference.  It\n    seemed to me myself that he, seeing somebody wishing to make much of\n    him, took what he considered a safe opportunity of restoring to\n    himself his own good opinion, which must have been considerably\n    lowered in the episode of the Wine Master's wife.\n\n    The Voivodin, thinking, doubtless, Your Honour, to add a fresh lustre\n    to her welcome, had donned the costume which all her nation has now\n    come to love and to accept as a dress of ceremonial honour.  She wore\n    her shroud.  It moved the hearts of all of us who looked on to see\n    it, and we appreciated its being worn for such a cause.  But Mr.\n    Melton did not seem to care.  As he had been approaching she had\n    begun to kneel, and was already on her knees whilst he was several\n    yards away.  There he stopped and turned to speak to his valet, put a\n    glass in his eye, and looked all round him and up and down--indeed,\n    everywhere except at the Great Lady, who was on her knees before him,\n    waiting to bid him welcome.  I could see in the eyes of such of the\n    mountaineers as were within my range of vision a growing animosity;\n    so, hoping to keep down any such expression, which I knew would cause\n    harm to Your Honour and the Voivodin, I looked all round them\n    straight in their faces with a fixed frown, which, indeed, they\n    seemed to understand, for they regained, and for the time maintained,\n    their usual dignified calm.  The Voivodin, may I say, bore the trial\n    wonderfully.  No human being could see that she was in any degree\n    pained or even surprised.  Mr. Melton stood looking round him so long\n    that I had full time to regain my own attitude of calm.  At last he\n    seemed to come back to the knowledge that someone was waiting for\n    him, and sauntered leisurely forward.  There was so much\n    insolence--mind you, not insolence that was intended to appear as\n    such--in his movement that the mountaineers began to steal forward.\n    When he was close up to the Voivodin, and she put out her hand to\n    take his, he put forward _one finger_!  I could hear the intake of\n    the breath of the men, now close around, for I had moved forward,\n    too.  I thought it would be as well to be close to your guest, lest\n    something should happen to him.  The Voivodin still kept her splendid\n    self-control.  Raising the finger put forward by the guest with the\n    same deference as though it had been the hand of a King, she bent her\n    head down and kissed it.  Her duty of courtesy now done, she was\n    preparing to rise, when he put his hand into his pocket, and, pulling\n    out a sovereign, offered it to her.  His valet moved his hand\n    forward, as if to pull back his arm, but it was too late.  I am sure,\n    Your Honour, that no affront was intended.  He doubtless thought that\n    he was doing a kindness of the sort usual in England when one \"tips\"\n    a housekeeper.  But all the same, to one in her position, it was an\n    affront, an insult, open and unmistakable.  So it was received by the\n    mountaineers, whose handjars flashed out as one.  For a second it was\n    so received even by the Voivodin, who, with face flushing scarlet,\n    and the stars in her eves flaming red, sprang to her feet.  But in\n    that second she had regained herself, and to all appearances her\n    righteous anger passed away.  Stooping, she took the hand of her\n    guest and raised it--you know how strong she is--and, holding it in\n    hers, led him into the doorway, saying:\n\n    \"You are welcome, kinsman of my husband, to the house of my father,\n    which is presently my husband's also.  Both are grieved that, duty\n    having called them away for the time, they are unable to be here to\n    help me to greet you.\"\n\n    I tell you, Your Honour, that it was a lesson in self-respect which\n    anyone who saw it can never forget.  As to me, it makes my flesh\n    quiver, old as I am, with delight, and my heart leap.\n\n    May I, as a faithful servant who has had many years of experience,\n    suggest that Your Honour should seem--for the present, at any\n    rate--not to know any of these things which I have reported, as you\n    wished me to do.  Be sure that the Voivodin will tell you her\n    gracious self aught that she would wish you to know.  And such\n    reticence on your part must make for her happiness, even if it did\n    not for your own.\n\n    So that you may know all, as you desired, and that you may have time\n    to school yourself to whatever attitude you think best to adopt, I\n    send this off to you at once by fleet messenger.  Were the aeroplane\n    here, I should take it myself.  I leave here shortly to await the\n    arrival of Sir Colin at Otranto.\n\n                                           Your Honour's faithful servant,\n                                                                    ROOKE.\n\n\n\nJANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.\n\n\n                                                         _August_ 9, 1907.\n\nTo me it seems very providential that Rupert was not at home when that\ndreadful young man Ernest Melton arrived, though it is possible that if\nRupert had been present he would not have dared to conduct himself so\nbadly.  Of course, I heard all about it from the maids; Teuta never\nopened her lips to me on the subject.  It was bad enough and stupid\nenough for him to try to kiss a decent young woman like Julia, who is\nreally as good as gold and as modest as one of our own Highland lassies;\nbut to think of him insulting Teuta!  The little beast!  One would think\nthat a champion idiot out of an Equatorial asylum would know better!  If\nMichael, the Wine Master, wanted to kill him, I wonder what my Rupert and\nhers would have done?  I am truly thankful that he was not present.  And\nI am thankful, too, that I was not present either, for I should have made\nan exhibition of myself, and Rupert would not have liked that.  He--the\nlittle beast! might have seen from the very dress that the dear girl wore\nthat there was something exceptional about her.  But on one account I\nshould have liked to see her.  They tell me that she was, in her true\ndignity, like a Queen, and that her humility in receiving her husband's\nkinsman was a lesson to every woman in the Land.  I must be careful not\nto let Rupert know that I have heard of the incident.  Later on, when it\nis all blown over and the young man has been got safely away, I shall\ntell him of it.  Mr. Rooke--Lord High Admiral Rooke, I should say--must\nbe a really wonderful man to have so held himself in check; for, from\nwhat I have heard of him, he must in his younger days have been worse\nthan Old Morgan of Panama.  Mr. Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, of Humcroft,\nSalop, little knows how near he was to being \"cleft to the chine\" also.\n\nFortunately, I had heard of his meeting with Teuta before he came to see\nme, for I did not get back from my walk till after he had arrived.\nTeuta's noble example was before me, and I determined that I, too, would\nshow good manners under any circumstances.  But I didn't know how mean he\nis.  Think of his saying to me that Rupert's position here must be a\ngreat source of pride to me, who had been his nursery governess.  He said\n\"nursemaid\" first, but then stumbled in his words, seeming to remember\nsomething.  I did not turn a hair, I am glad to say.  It is a mercy Uncle\nColin was not here, for I honestly believe that, if he had been, he would\nhave done the \"cleaving to the chine\" himself.  It has been a narrow\nescape for Master Ernest, for only this morning Rupert had a message,\nsent on from Gibraltar, saying that he was arriving with his clansmen,\nand that they would not be far behind his letter.  He would call at\nOtranto in case someone should come across to pilot him to Vissarion.\nUncle told me all about that young cad having offered him one finger in\nMr. Trent's office, though, of course, he didn't let the cad see that he\nnoticed it.  I have no doubt that, when he does arrive, that young man,\nif he is here still, will find that he will have to behave himself, if it\nbe only on Sir Colin's account alone.\n\n\n\nTHE SAME (LATER).\n\n\nI had hardly finished writing when the lookout on the tower announced\nthat the _Teuta_, as Rupert calls his aeroplane, was sighted crossing the\nmountains from Plazac.  I hurried up to see him arrive, for I had not as\nyet seen him on his \"aero.\"  Mr. Ernest Melton came up, too.  Teuta was,\nof course, before any of us.  She seems to know by instinct when Rupert\nis coming.\n\nIt was certainly a wonderful sight to see the little aeroplane, with\noutspread wings like a bird in flight, come sailing high over the\nmountains.  There was a head-wind, and they were beating against it;\notherwise we should not have had time to get to the tower before the\narrival.\n\nWhen once the \"aero\" had begun to drop on the near side of the mountains,\nhowever, and had got a measure of shelter from them, her pace was\nextraordinary.  We could not tell, of course, what sort of pace she came\nat from looking at herself.  But we gathered some idea from the rate at\nwhich the mountains and hills seemed to slide away from under her.  When\nshe got over the foot-hills, which are about ten miles away, she came on\nat a swift glide that seemed to throw the distance behind her.  When\nquite close, she rose up a little till she was something higher than the\nTower, to which she came as straight as an arrow from the bow, and glided\nto her moorings, stopping dead as Rupert pulled a lever, which seemed to\nturn a barrier to the wind.  The Voivode sat beside Rupert, but I must\nsay that he seemed to hold on to the bar in front of him even more firmly\nthan Rupert held to his steering-gear.\n\nWhen they had alighted, Rupert greeted his cousin with the utmost\nkindness, and bade him welcome to Vissarion.\n\n\"I see,\" he said, \"you have met Teuta.  Now you may congratulate me, if\nyou wish.\"\n\nMr. Melton made a long rodomontade about her beauty, but presently,\nstumbling about in his speech, said something regarding it being unlucky\nto appear in grave-clothes.  Rupert laughed, and clapped him on the\nshoulder as he answered:\n\n\"That pattern of frock is likely to become a national dress for loyal\nwomen of the Blue Mountains.  When you know something of what that dress\nmeans to us all at present you will understand.  In the meantime, take it\nthat there is not a soul in the nation that does not love it and honour\nher for wearing it.\"  To which the cad replied:\n\n\"Oh, indeed!  I thought it was some preparation for a fancy-dress ball.\"\nRupert's comment on this ill-natured speech was (for him) quite grumpily\ngiven:\n\n\"I should not advise you to think such things whilst you are in this part\nof the world, Ernest.  They bury men here for much less.\"\n\nThe cad seemed struck with something--either what Rupert had said or his\nmanner of saying it--for he was silent for several seconds before he\nspoke.\n\n\"I'm very tired with that long journey, Rupert.  Would you and Mrs. Sent\nLeger mind if I go to my own room and turn in?  My man can ask for a cup\nof tea and a sandwich for me.\"\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL.\n\n\n                                                        _August_ 10, 1907.\n\nWhen Ernest said he wished to retire it was about the wisest thing he\ncould have said or done, and it suited Teuta and me down to the ground.\nI could see that the dear girl was agitated about something, so thought\nit would be best for her to be quiet, and not worried with being civil to\nthe Bounder.  Though he is my cousin, I can't think of him as anything\nelse.  The Voivode and I had certain matters to attend to arising out of\nthe meeting of the Council, and when we were through the night was\nclosing in.  When I saw Teuta in our own rooms she said at once:\n\n\"Do you mind, dear, if I stay with Aunt Janet to-night?  She is very\nupset and nervous, and when I offered to come to her she clung to me and\ncried with relief.\"\n\nSo when I had had some supper, which I took with the Voivode, I came down\nto my old quarters in the Garden Room, and turned in early.\n\nI was awakened a little before dawn by the coming of the fighting monk\nTheophrastos, a notable runner, who had an urgent message for me.  This\nwas the letter to me given to him by Rooke.  He had been cautioned to\ngive it into no other hand, but to find me wherever I might be, and\nconvey it personally.  When he had arrived at Plazac I had left on the\naeroplane, so he had turned back to Vissarion.\n\nWhen I read Rooke's report of Ernest Melton's abominable conduct I was\nmore angry with him than I can say.  Indeed, I did not think before that\nthat I could be angry with him, for I have always despised him.  But this\nwas too much.  However, I realized the wisdom of Rooke's advice, and went\naway by myself to get over my anger and reacquire my self-mastery.  The\naeroplane _Teuta_ was still housed on the tower, so I went up alone and\ntook it out.\n\nWhen I had had a spin of about a hundred miles I felt better.  The\nbracing of the wind and the quick, exhilarating motion restored me to\nmyself, and I felt able to cope with Master Ernest, or whatever else\nchagrinable might come along, without giving myself away.  As Teuta had\nthought it better to keep silence as to Ernest's affront, I felt I must\nnot acknowledge it; but, all the same, I determined to get rid of him\nbefore the day was much older.\n\nWhen I had had my breakfast I sent word to him by a servant that I was\ncoming to his rooms, and followed not long behind the messenger.\n\nHe was in a suit of silk pyjamas, such as not even Solomon in all his\nglory was arrayed in.  I closed the door behind me before I began to\nspeak.  He listened, at first amazed, then disconcerted, then angry, and\nthen cowering down like a whipped hound.  I felt that it was a case for\nspeaking out.  A bumptious ass like him, who deliberately insulted\neveryone he came across--for if all or any of his efforts in that way\nwere due to mere elemental ignorance he was not fit to live, but should\nbe silenced on sight as a modern Caliban--deserved neither pity nor\nmercy.  To extend to him fine feeling, tolerance, and such-like\ngentlenesses would be to deprive the world of them without benefit to\nany.  So well as I can remember, what I said was something like this:\n\n\"Ernest, as you say, you've got to go, and to go quick, you understand.\nI dare say you look on this as a land of barbarians, and think that any\nof your high-toned refinements are thrown away on people here.  Well,\nperhaps it is so.  Undoubtedly, the structure of the country is rough;\nthe mountains may only represent the glacial epoch; but so far as I can\ngather from some of your exploits--for I have only learned a small part\nas yet--you represent a period a good deal farther back.  You seem to\nhave given our folk here an exhibition of the playfulness of the hooligan\nof the Saurian stage of development; but the Blue Mountains, rough as\nthey are, have come up out of the primeval slime, and even now the people\naim at better manners.  They may be rough, primitive, barbarian,\nelemental, if you will, but they are not low down enough to tolerate\neither your ethics or your taste.  My dear cousin, your life is not safe\nhere!  I am told that yesterday, only for the restraint exercised by\ncertain offended mountaineers on other grounds than your own worth, you\nwould have been abbreviated by the head.  Another day of your fascinating\npresence would do away with this restraint, and then we should have a\nscandal.  I am a new-comer here myself--too new a comer to be able to\nafford a scandal of that kind--and so I shall not delay your going.\nBelieve me, my dear cousin, Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, of Humcroft,\nSalop, that I am inconsolable about your resolution of immediate\ndeparture, but I cannot shut my eyes to its wisdom.  At present the\nmatter is altogether amongst ourselves, and when you have gone--if it be\nimmediately--silence will be observed on all hands for the sake of the\nhouse wherein you are a guest; but if there be time for scandal to\nspread, you will be made, whether you be alive or dead, a European\nlaughing-stock.  Accordingly, I have anticipated your wishes, and have\nordered a fast steam yacht to take you to Ancona, or to whatever other\nport you may desire.  The yacht will be under the command of Captain\nDesmond, of one of our battleships--a most determined officer, who will\ncarry out any directions which may be given to him.  This will insure\nyour safety so far as Italian territory.  Some of his officials will\narrange a special carriage for you up to Flushing, and a cabin on the\nsteamer to Queenboro'.  A man of mine will travel on the train and\nsteamer with you, and will see that whatever you may wish in the way of\nfood or comfort will be provided.  Of course, you understand, my dear\ncousin, that you are my guest until you arrive in London.  I have not\nasked Rooke to accompany you, as when he went to meet you, it was a\nmistake.  Indeed, there might have been a danger to you which I never\ncontemplated--a quite unnecessary danger, I assure you.  But happily\nAdmiral Rooke, though a man of strong passions, has wonderful\nself-control.\"\n\n\"Admiral Rooke?\" he queried.  \"Admiral?\"\n\n\"Admiral, certainly,\" I replied, \"but not an ordinary Admiral--one of\nmany.  He is _the_ Admiral--the Lord High Admiral of the Land of the Blue\nMountains, with sole control of its expanding navy.  When such a man is\ntreated as a valet, there may be . . . But why go into this?  It is all\nover.  I only mention it lest anything of a similar kind should occur\nwith Captain Desmond, who is a younger man, and therefore with probably\nless self-repression.\"\n\nI saw that he had learned his lesson, and so said no more on the subject.\n\nThere was another reason for his going which I did not speak of.  Sir\nColin MacKelpie was coming with his clansmen, and I knew he did not like\nErnest Melton.  I well remembered that episode of his offering one finger\nto the old gentleman in Mr. Trent's office, and, moreover, I had my\nsuspicions that Aunt Janet's being upset was probably in some measure due\nto some rudeness of his that she did not wish to speak about.  He is\nreally an impossible young man, and is far better out of this country\nthan in it.  If he remained here, there would be some sort of a tragedy\nfor certain.\n\nI must say that it was with a feeling of considerable relief that I saw\nthe yacht steam out of the creek, with Captain Desmond on the bridge and\nmy cousin beside him.\n\nQuite other were my feelings when, an hour after, _The Lady_ came flying\ninto the creek with the Lord High Admiral on the bridge, and beside him,\nmore splendid and soldier-like than ever, Sir Colin MacKelpie.  Mr.\nBingham Trent was also on the bridge.\n\nThe General was full of enthusiasm regarding his regiment, for in all,\nthose he brought with him and those finishing their training at home, the\nforce is near the number of a full regiment.  When we were alone he\nexplained to me that all was arranged regarding the non-commissioned\nofficers, but that he had held over the question of officers until we\nshould have had a suitable opportunity of talking the matter over\ntogether.  He explained to me his reasons, which were certainly simple\nand cogent.  Officers, according to him, are a different class, and\naccustomed to a different standard altogether of life and living, of\nduties and pleasures.  They are harder to deal with and more difficult to\nobtain.  \"There was no use,\" he said, \"in getting a lot of failures, with\nold-crusted ways of their own importance.  We must have young men for our\npurpose--that is, men not old, but with some experience--men, of course,\nwho know how to behave themselves, or else, from what little I have seen\nof the Blue Mountaineers, they wouldn't last long here if they went on as\nsome of them do elsewhere.  I shall start things here as you wish me to,\nfor I am here, my dear boy, to stay with you and Janet, and we shall, if\nit be given to us by the Almighty, help to build up together a new\n'nation'--an ally of Britain, who will stand at least as an outpost of\nour own nation, and a guardian of our eastern road.  When things are\norganized here on the military side, and are going strong, I shall, if\nyou can spare me, run back to London for a few weeks.  Whilst I am there\nI shall pick up a lot of the sort of officers we want.  I know that there\nare loads of them to be had.  I shall go slowly, however, and carefully,\ntoo, and every man I bring back will be recommended to me by some old\nsoldier whom I know, and who knows the man he recommends, and has seen\nhim work.  We shall have, I dare say, an army for its size second to none\nin the world, and the day may come when your old country will be proud of\nyour new one.  Now I'm off to see that all is ready for my people--your\npeople now.\"\n\nI had had arrangements made for the comfort of the clansmen and the\nwomen, but I knew that the good old soldier would see for himself that\nhis men were to be comfortable.  It was not for nothing that he\nwas--is--looked on as perhaps the General most beloved by his men in the\nwhole British Army.\n\nWhen he had gone, and I was alone, Mr. Trent, who had evidently been\nwaiting for the opportunity, came to me.  When we had spoken of my\nmarriage and of Teuta, who seems to have made an immense impression on\nhim, he said suddenly:\n\n\"I suppose we are quite alone, and that we shall not be interrupted?\"  I\nsummoned the man outside--there is always a sentry on guard outside my\ndoor or near me, wherever I may be--and gave orders that I was not to be\ndisturbed until I gave fresh orders.  \"If,\" I said, \"there be anything\npressing or important, let the Voivodin or Miss MacKelpie know.  If\neither of them brings anyone to me, it will be all right.\"\n\nWhen we were quite alone Mr. Trent took a slip of paper and some\ndocuments from the bag which was beside him.  He then read out items from\nthe slip, placing as he did so the documents so checked over before him.\n\n1.  New Will made on marriage, to be signed presently.\n\n2.  Copy of the Re-conveyance of Vissarion estates to Peter Vissarion, as\ndirected by Will of Roger Melton.\n\n3.  Report of Correspondence with Privy Council, and proceedings\nfollowing.\n\nTaking up the last named, he untied the red tape, and, holding the bundle\nin his hand, went on:\n\n\"As you may, later on, wish to examine the details of the Proceedings, I\nhave copied out the various letters, the originals of which are put\nsafely away in my strong-room where, of course, they are always available\nin case you may want them.  For your present information I shall give you\na rough synopsis of the Proceedings, referring where advisable to this\npaper.\n\n\"On receipt of your letter of instructions regarding the Consent of the\nPrivy Council to your changing your nationality in accordance with the\nterms of Roger Melton's Will, I put myself in communication with the\nClerk of the Privy Council, informing him of your wish to be naturalized\nin due time to the Land of the Blue Mountains.  After some letters\nbetween us, I got a summons to attend a meeting of the Council.\n\n\"I attended, as required, taking with me all necessary documents, and\nsuch as I conceived might be advisable to produce, if wanted.\n\n\"The Lord President informed me that the present meeting of the Council\nwas specially summoned in obedience to the suggestion of the King, who\nhad been consulted as to his personal wishes on the subject--should he\nhave any.  The President then proceeded to inform me officially that all\nProceedings of the Privy Council were altogether confidential, and were\nnot to be made public under any circumstances.  He was gracious enough to\nadd:\n\n\"'The circumstances of this case, however, are unique; and as you act for\nanother, we have thought it advisable to enlarge your permission in the\nmatter, so as to allow you to communicate freely with your principal.  As\nthat gentleman is settling himself in a part of the world which has been\nin the past, and may be again, united to this nation by some common\ninterest, His Majesty wishes Mr. Sent Leger to feel assured of the\ngood-will of Great Britain to the Land of the Blue Mountains, and even of\nhis own personal satisfaction that a gentleman of so distinguished a\nlineage and such approved personal character is about to be--within his\nown scope--a connecting-link between the nations.  To which end he has\ngraciously announced that, should the Privy Council acquiesce in the\nrequest of Denaturalization, he will himself sign the Patent therefor.\n\n\"'The Privy Council has therefore held private session, at which the\nmatter has been discussed in its many bearings; and it is content that\nthe change can do no harm, but may be of some service to the two nations.\nWe have, therefore, agreed to grant the prayer of the Applicant; and the\nofficials of the Council have the matter of the form of Grant in hand.\nSo you, sir, may rest satisfied that as soon as the formalities--which\nwill, of course, require the formal signing of certain documents by the\nApplicant--can be complied with, the Grant and Patent will obtain.'\"\n\nHaving made this statement in formal style, my old friend went on in more\nfamiliar way:\n\n\"And so, my dear Rupert, all is in hand; and before very long you will\nhave the freedom required under the Will, and will be at liberty to take\nwhatever steps may be necessary to be naturalized in your new country.\n\n\"I may tell you, by the way, that several members of the Council made\nvery complimentary remarks regarding you.  I am forbidden to give names,\nbut I may tell you facts.  One old Field-Marshal, whose name is familiar\nto the whole world, said that he had served in many places with your\nfather, who was a very valiant soldier, and that he was glad that Great\nBritain was to have in the future the benefit of your father's son in a\nfriendly land now beyond the outposts of our Empire, but which had been\none with her in the past, and might be again.\n\n\"So much for the Privy Council.  We can do no more at present until you\nsign and have attested the documents which I have brought with me.\n\n\"We can now formally complete the settlement of the Vissarion estates,\nwhich must be done whilst you are a British citizen.  So, too, with the\nWill, the more formal and complete document, which is to take the place\nof that short one which you forwarded to me the day after your marriage.\nIt may be, perhaps, necessary or advisable that, later on, when you are\nnaturalized here, you shall make a new Will in strictest accordance with\nlocal law.\"\n\n\n\nTEUTA SENT LEGER'S DIARY.\n\n\n                                                        _August_ 19, 1907.\n\nWe had a journey to-day that was simply glorious.  We had been waiting to\ntake it for more than a week.  Rupert not only wanted the weather\nsuitable, but he had to wait till the new aeroplane came home.  It is\nmore than twice as big as our biggest up to now.  None of the others\ncould take all the party which Rupert wanted to go.  When he heard that\nthe aero was coming from Whitby, where it was sent from Leeds, he\ndirected by cable that it should be unshipped at Otranto, whence he took\nit here all by himself.  I wanted to come with him, but he thought it\nbetter not.  He says that Brindisi is too busy a place to keep anything\nquiet--if not secret--and he wants to be very dark indeed about this, as\nit is worked by the new radium engine.  Ever since they found radium in\nour own hills he has been obsessed by the idea of an aerial navy for our\nprotection.  And after to-day's experiences I think he is right.  As he\nwanted to survey the whole country at a glimpse, so that the general\nscheme of defence might be put in hand, we had to have an aero big enough\nto take the party as well as fast enough to do it rapidly, and all at\nonce.  We had, in addition to Rupert, my father, and myself, Sir Colin\nand Lord High Admiral Rooke (I do like to give that splendid old fellow\nhis full title!).  The military and naval experts had with them\nscientific apparatus of various kinds, also cameras and range-finders, so\nthat they could mark their maps as they required.  Rupert, of course,\ndrove, and I acted as his assistant.  Father, who has not yet become\naccustomed to aerial travel, took a seat in the centre (which Rupert had\nthoughtfully prepared for him), where there is very little motion.  I\nmust say I was amazed to see the way that splendid old soldier Sir Colin\nbore himself.  He had never been on an aeroplane before, but, all the\nsame, he was as calm as if he was on a rock.  Height or motion did not\ntrouble him.  Indeed, he seemed to _enjoy_ himself all the time.  The\nAdmiral is himself almost an expert, but in any case I am sure he would\nhave been unconcerned, just as he was in the _Crab_ as Rupert has told\nme.\n\nWe left just after daylight, and ran down south.  When we got to the east\nof Ilsin, we kept slightly within the border-line, and went north or east\nas it ran, making occasional loops inland over the mountains and back\nagain.  When we got up to our farthest point north, we began to go much\nslower.  Sir Colin explained that for the rest all would be comparatively\nplain-sailing in the way of defence; but that as any foreign Power other\nthan the Turk must attack from seaward, he would like to examine the\nseaboard very carefully in conjunction with the Admiral, whose advice as\nto sea defence would be invaluable.\n\nRupert was fine.  No one could help admiring him as he sat working his\nlever and making the great machine obey every touch.  He was wrapped up\nin his work.  I don't believe that whilst he was working he ever thought\nof even me.  He _is_ splendid!\n\nWe got back just as the sun was dropping down over the Calabrian\nMountains.  It is quite wonderful how the horizon changes when you are\nsailing away up high on an aeroplane.  Rupert is going to teach me how to\nmanage one all by myself, and when I am fit he will give me one, which he\nis to have specially built for me.\n\nI think I, too, have done some good work--at least, I have got some good\nideas--from our journey to-day.  Mine are not of war, but of peace, and I\nthink I see a way by which we shall be able to develop our country in a\nwonderful way.  I shall talk the idea over with Rupert to-night, when we\nare alone.  In the meantime Sir Colin and Admiral Rooke will think their\nplans over individually, and to-morrow morning together.  Then the next\nday they, too, are to go over their idea with Rupert and my father, and\nsomething may be decided then.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                        _August_ 21, 1907.\n\nOur meeting on the subject of National Defence, held this afternoon, went\noff well.  We were five in all, for with permission of the Voivode and\nthe two fighting-men, naval and military, I brought Teuta with me.  She\nsat beside me quite quietly, and never made a remark of any kind till the\nDefence business had been gone through.  Both Sir Colin and Admiral Rooke\nwere in perfect agreement as to the immediate steps to be taken for\ndefence.  In the first instance, the seaboard was to be properly\nfortified in the necessary places, and the navy largely strengthened.\nWhen we had got thus far I asked Rooke to tell of the navy increase\nalready in hand.  Whereupon he explained that, as we had found the small\nbattleship _The Lady_ of an excellent type for coast defence, acting only\nin home waters, and of a size to take cover where necessary at many\nplaces on our own shores, we had ordered nine others of the same pattern.\nOf these the first four were already in hand, and were proceeding with\nthe greatest expedition.  The General then supplemented this by saying\nthat big guns could be used from points judiciously chosen on the\nseaboard, which was in all so short a length that no very great quantity\nof armament would be required.\n\n\"We can have,\" he said, \"the biggest guns of the most perfect kind yet\naccomplished, and use them from land batteries of the most up-to-date\npattern.  The one serious proposition we have to deal with is the defence\nof the harbour--as yet quite undeveloped--which is known as the 'Blue\nMouth.'  Since our aerial journey I have been to it by sea with Admiral\nRooke in _The Lady_, and then on land with the Vladika, who was born on\nits shores, and who knows every inch of it.\n\n\"It is worth fortifying--and fortifying well, for as a port it is\npeerless in Mediterranean seas.  The navies of the world might ride in\nit, land-locked, and even hidden from view seawards.  The mountains which\nenclose it are in themselves absolute protection.  In addition, these can\nonly be assailed from our own territory.  Of course, Voivode, you\nunderstand when I say 'our' I mean the Land of the Blue Mountains, for\nwhose safety and well-being I am alone concerned.  Any ship anchoring in\nthe roads of the Blue Mouth would have only one need--sufficient length\nof cable for its magnificent depth.\n\n\"When proper guns are properly placed on the steep cliffs to north and\nsouth of the entrance, and when the rock islet between has been armoured\nand armed as will be necessary, the Mouth will be impregnable.  But we\nshould not depend on the aiming of the entrance alone.  At certain\nsalient points--which I have marked upon this map--armour-plated sunken\nforts within earthworks should be established.  There should be covering\nforts on the hillsides, and, of course, the final summits protected.\nThus we could resist attack on any side or all sides--from sea or land.\nThat port will yet mean the wealth as well as the strength of this\nnation, so it will be well to have it properly protected.  This should be\ndone soon, and the utmost secrecy observed in the doing of it, lest the\nso doing should become a matter of international concern.\"\n\nHere Rooke smote the table hard.\n\n\"By God, that is true!  It has been the dream of my own life for this\nmany a year.\"\n\nIn the silence which followed the sweet, gentle voice of Teuta came clear\nas a bell:\n\n\"May I say a word?  I am emboldened to, as Sir Colin has spoken so\nsplendidly, and as the Lord High Admiral has not hesitated to mention his\ndreaming.  I, too, have had a dream--a day-dream--which came in a flash,\nbut no less a dream, for all that.  It was when we hung on the aeroplane\nover the Blue Mouth.  It seemed to me in an instant that I saw that\nbeautiful spot as it will some time be--typical, as Sir Colin said, of\nthe wealth as well as the strength of this nation; a mart for the world\nwhence will come for barter some of the great wealth of the Blue\nMountains.  That wealth is as yet undeveloped.  But the day is at hand\nwhen we may begin to use it, and through that very port.  Our mountains\nand their valleys are clad with trees of splendid growth, virgin forests\nof priceless worth; hard woods of all kinds, which have no superior\nthroughout the world.  In the rocks, though hidden as yet, is vast\nmineral wealth of many kinds.  I have been looking through the reports of\nthe geological exports of the Commission of Investigation which my\nhusband organized soon after he came to live here, and, according to\nthem, our whole mountain ranges simply teem with vast quantities of\nminerals, almost more precious for industry than gold and silver are for\ncommerce--though, indeed, gold is not altogether lacking as a mineral.\nWhen once our work on the harbour is done, and the place has been made\nsecure against any attempt at foreign aggression, we must try to find a\nway to bring this wealth of woods and ores down to the sea.\n\n\"And then, perhaps, may begin the great prosperity of our Land, of which\nwe have all dreamt.\"\n\nShe stopped, all vibrating, almost choked with emotion.  We were all\nmoved.  For myself, I was thrilled to the core.  Her enthusiasm was\nall-sweeping, and under its influence I found my own imagination\nexpanding.  Out of its experiences I spoke:\n\n\"And there is a way.  I can see it.  Whilst our dear Voivodin was\nspeaking, the way seemed to clear.  I saw at the back of the Blue Mouth,\nwhere it goes deepest into the heart of the cliffs, the opening of a\ngreat tunnel, which ran upward over a steep slope till it debouched on\nthe first plateau beyond the range of the encompassing cliffs.  Thither\ncame by various rails of steep gradient, by timber-shoots and\ncable-rails, by aerial cables and precipitating tubes, wealth from over\nground and under it; for as our Land is all mountains, and as these tower\nup to the clouds, transport to the sea shall be easy and of little cost\nwhen once the machinery is established.  As everything of much weight\ngoes downward, the cars of the main tunnel of the port shall return\nupward without cost.  We can have from the mountains a head of water\nunder good control, which will allow of endless hydraulic power, so that\nthe whole port and the mechanism of the town to which it will grow can be\nworked by it.\n\n\"This work can be put in hand at once.  So soon as the place shall be\nperfectly surveyed and the engineering plans got ready, we can start on\nthe main tunnel, working from the sea-level up, so that the cost of the\ntransport of material will be almost nil.  This work can go on whilst the\nforts are building; no time need be lost.\n\n\"Moreover, may I add a word on National Defence?  We are, though old in\nhonour, a young nation as to our place amongst Great Powers.  And so we\nmust show the courage and energy of a young nation.  The Empire of the\nAir is not yet won.  Why should not we make a bid for it?  As our\nmountains are lofty, so shall we have initial power of attack or defence.\nWe can have, in chosen spots amongst the clouds, depots of war\naeroplanes, with which we can descend and smite our enemies quickly on\nland or sea.  We shall hope to live for Peace; but woe to those who drive\nus to War!\"\n\nThere is no doubt that the Vissarions are a warlike race.  As I spoke,\nTeuta took one of my hands and held it hard.  The old Voivode, his eyes\nblazing, rose and stood beside me and took the other.  The two old\nfighting-men of the land and the sea stood up and saluted.\n\nThis was the beginning of what ultimately became \"The National Committee\nof Defence and Development.\"\n\nI had other, and perhaps greater, plans for the future in my mind; but\nthe time had not come for their utterance.\n\nTo me it seems not only advisable, but necessary, that the utmost\ndiscretion be observed by all our little group, at all events for the\npresent.  There seems to be some new uneasiness in the Blue Mountains.\nThere are constant meetings of members of the Council, but no formal\nmeeting of the Council, as such, since the last one at which I was\npresent.  There is constant coming and going amongst the mountaineers,\nalways in groups, small or large.  Teuta and I, who have been about very\nmuch on the aeroplane, have both noticed it.  But somehow we--that is,\nthe Voivode and myself--are left out of everything; but we have not said\nas yet a word on the subject to any of the others.  The Voivode notices,\nbut he says nothing; so I am silent, and Teuta does whatever I ask.  Sir\nColin does not notice anything except the work he is engaged on--the\nplanning the defences of the Blue Mouth.  His old scientific training as\nan engineer, and his enormous experience of wars and sieges--for he was\nfor nearly fifty years sent as military representative to all the great\nwars--seem to have become directed on that point.  He is certainly\nplanning it all out in a wonderful way.  He consults Rooke almost hourly\non the maritime side of the question.  The Lord High Admiral has been a\nwatcher all his life, and very few important points have ever escaped\nhim, so that he can add greatly to the wisdom of the defensive\nconstruction.  He notices, I think, that something is going on outside\nourselves; but he keeps a resolute silence.\n\nWhat the movement going on is I cannot guess.  It is not like the\nuneasiness that went before the abduction of Teuta and the Voivode, but\nit is even more pronounced.  That was an uneasiness founded on some\nsuspicion.  This is a positive thing, and has definite meaning--of some\nsort.  We shall, I suppose, know all about it in good time.  In the\nmeantime we go on with our work.  Happily the whole Blue Mouth and the\nmountains round it are on my own property, the portion acquired long ago\nby Uncle Roger, exclusive of the Vissarion estate.  I asked the Voivode\nto allow me to transfer it to him, but he sternly refused and forbade me,\nquite peremptorily, to ever open the subject to him again.  \"You have\ndone enough already,\" he said.  \"Were I to allow you to go further, I\nshould feel mean.  And I do not think you would like your wife's father\nto suffer that feeling after a long life, which he has tried to live in\nhonour.\"\n\nI bowed, and said no more.  So there the matter rests, and I have to take\nmy own course.  I have had a survey made, and on the head of it the\nTunnel to the harbour is begun.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII: THE FLASHING OF THE HANDJAR\n\n\nPRIVATE MEMORANDUM OF THE MEETING OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL\nCOUNCIL, HELD AT THE STATE HOUSE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS AT PLAZAC ON\nMONDAY, AUGUST 26, 1907.\n\n\n(_Written by Cristoferos_, _Scribe of the Council_, _by instruction of\nthose present_.)\n\nWhen the private meeting of various Members of the National Council had\nassembled in the Council Hall of the State House at Plazac, it was as a\npreliminary decided unanimously that now or hereafter no names of those\npresent were to be mentioned, and that officials appointed for the\npurposes of this meeting should be designated by office only, the names\nof all being withheld.\n\nThe proceedings assumed the shape of a general conversation, quite\ninformal, and therefore not to be recorded.  The nett outcome was the\nunanimous expression of an opinion that the time, long contemplated by\nvery many persons throughout the nation, had now come when the\nConstitution and machinery of the State should be changed; that the\npresent form of ruling by an Irregular Council was not sufficient, and\nthat a method more in accord with the spirit of the times should be\nadopted.  To this end Constitutional Monarchy, such as that holding in\nGreat Britain, seemed best adapted.  Finally, it was decided that each\nMember of the Council should make a personal canvass of his district,\ntalk over the matter with his electors, and bring back to another\nmeeting--or, rather, as it was amended, to this meeting postponed for a\nweek, until September 2nd--the opinions and wishes received.  Before\nseparating, the individual to be appointed King, in case the new idea\nshould prove grateful to the nation, was discussed.  The consensus of\nopinion was entirely to the effect that the Voivode Peter Vissarion\nshould, if he would accept the high office, be appointed.  It was urged\nthat, as his daughter, the Voivodin Teuta, was now married to the\nEnglishman, Rupert Sent Leger--called generally by the mountaineers \"the\nGospodar Rupert\"--a successor to follow the Voivode when God should call\nhim would be at hand--a successor worthy in every way to succeed to so\nillustrious a post.  It was urged by several speakers, with general\nacquiescence, that already Mr. Sent Leger's services to the State were\nsuch that he would be in himself a worthy person to begin the new\nDynasty; but that, as he was now allied to the Voivode Peter Vissarion,\nit was becoming that the elder, born of the nation, should receive the\nfirst honour.\n\n\n\nTHE SAME--_Continued_.\n\n\nThe adjourned meeting of certain members of the National Council was\nresumed in the Hall of the State House at Plazac on Monday, September\n2nd, 1907.  By motion the same chairman was appointed, and the rule\nregarding the record renewed.\n\nReports were made by the various members of the Council in turn,\naccording to the State Roll.  Every district was represented.  The\nreports were unanimously in favour of the New Constitution, and it was\nreported by each and all of the Councillors that the utmost enthusiasm\nmarked in every case the suggestion of the Voivode Peter Vissarion as the\nfirst King to be crowned under the new Constitution, and that remainder\nshould be settled on the Gospodar Rupert (the mountaineers would only\nreceive his lawful name as an alternative; one and all said that he would\nbe \"Rupert\" to them and to the nation--for ever).\n\nThe above matter having been satisfactorily settled, it was decided that\na formal meeting of the National Council should be held at the State\nHouse, Plazac, in one week from to-day, and that the Voivode Peter\nVissarion should be asked to be in the State House in readiness to\nattend.  It was also decided that instruction should be given to the High\nCourt of National Law to prepare and have ready, in skeleton form, a\nrescript of the New Constitution to be adopted, the same to be founded on\nthe Constitution and Procedure of Great Britain, so far as the same may\nbe applicable to the traditional ideas of free Government in the Land of\nthe Blue Mountains.\n\nBy unanimous vote this private and irregular meeting of \"Various National\nCouncillors\" was then dissolved.\n\n\n\nRECORD OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE LAND OF THE\nBLUE MOUNTAINS, HELD AT PLAZAC ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9TH, 1907, TO\nCONSIDER THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION, AND TO GIVE PERMANENT EFFECT\nTO THE SAME IF, AND WHEN, DECIDED UPON.\n\n\n(_Kept by the Monk Cristoferos_, _Scribe to the National Council_.)\n\nThe adjourned meeting duly took place as arranged.  There was a full\nattendance of Members of the Council, together with the Vladika, the\nArchbishop, the Archimandrites of Spazac, of Ispazar, of Domitan, and\nAstrag; the Chancellor; the Lord of the Exchequer; the President of the\nHigh Court of National Law; the President of the Council of Justice; and\nsuch other high officials as it is customary to summon to meetings of the\nNational Council on occasions of great importance.  The names of all\npresent will be found in the full report, wherein are given the ipsissima\nverba of the various utterances made during the consideration of the\nquestions discussed, the same having been taken down in shorthand by the\nhumble scribe of this precis, which has been made for the convenience of\nMembers of the Council and others.\n\nThe Voivode Peter Vissarion, obedient to the request of the Council, was\nin attendance at the State House, waiting in the \"Chamber of the High\nOfficers\" until such time as he should be asked to come before the\nCouncil.\n\nThe President put before the National Council the matter of the new\nConstitution, outlining the headings of it as drawn up by the High Court\nof National Law, and the Constitution having been formally accepted _nem.\ncon._ by the National Council on behalf of the people, he proposed that\nthe Crown should be offered to the Voivode Peter Vissarion, with\nremainder to the \"Gospodar Rupert\" (legally, Rupert Sent Leger), husband\nof his only child, the Voivodin Teuta.  This also was received with\nenthusiasm, and passed _nem. con._\n\nThereupon the President of Council, the Archbishop, and the Vladika,\nacting together as a deputation, went to pray the attention of the\nVoivode Peter Vassarion.\n\nWhen the Voivode entered, the whole Council and officials stood up, and\nfor a few seconds waited in respectful silence with heads bowed down.\nThen, as if by a common impulse--for no word was spoken nor any signal\ngiven--they all drew their handjars, and stood to attention--with points\nraised and edges of the handjars to the front.\n\nThe Voivode stood very still.  He seemed much moved, but controlled\nhimself admirably.  The only time when be seemed to lose his self-control\nwas when, once again with a strange simultaneity, all present raised\ntheir handjars on high, and shouted: \"Hail, Peter, King!\"  Then lowering\ntheir points till these almost touched the ground, they once again stood\nwith bowed heads.\n\nWhen he had quite mastered himself, the Voivode Peter Vissarion spoke:\n\n\"How can I, my brothers, sufficiently thank you, and, through you, the\npeople of the Blue Mountains, for the honour done to me this day?  In\nvery truth it is not possible, and therefore I pray you to consider it as\ndone, measuring my gratitude in the greatness of your own hearts.  Such\nhonour as you offer to me is not contemplated by any man in whose mind a\nwholesome sanity rules, nor is it even the dream of fervent imagination.\nSo great is it, that I pray you, men with hearts and minds like my own,\nto extend to me, as a further measure of your generosity, a little time\nto think it over.  I shall not want long, for even already, with the\nblaze of honour fresh upon me, I see the cool shadow of Duty, though his\nsubstance is yet hardly visible.  Give me but an hour of solitude--an\nhour at most--if it do not prolong this your session unduly.  It may be\nthat a lesser time will serve, but in any case I promise you that, when I\ncan see a just and fitting issue to my thought, I shall at once return.\"\n\nThe President of the Council looked around him, and, seeing everywhere\nthe bowing heads of acquiescence, spoke with a reverent gravity:\n\n\"We shall wait in patience whatsoever time you will, and may the God who\nrules all worthy hearts guide you to His Will!\"\n\nAnd so in silence the Voivode passed out of the hall.\n\nFrom my seat near a window I could watch him go, as with measured steps\nhe passed up the hill which rises behind the State House, and disappeared\ninto the shadow of the forest.  Then my work claimed me, for I wished to\nrecord the proceedings so far whilst all was fresh in my mind.  In\nsilence, as of the dead, the Council waited, no man challenging opinion\nof his neighbour even by a glance.\n\nAlmost a full hour had elapsed when the Voivode came again to the\nCouncil, moving with slow and stately gravity, as has always been his\nwont since age began to hamper the movement which in youth had been so\nnotable.  The Members of the Council all stood up uncovered, and so\nremained while he made announcement of his conclusion.  He spoke slowly;\nand as his answer was to be a valued record of this Land and its Race, I\nwrote down every word as uttered, leaving here and there space for\ndescription or comment, which spaces I have since then filled in.\n\n\"Lords of the National Council, Archbishop, Vladika, Lords of the Council\nof Justice and of National Law, Archimandrites, and my brothers all, I\nhave, since I left you, held in the solitude of the forest counsel with\nmyself--and with God; and He, in His gracious wisdom, has led my thinking\nto that conclusion which was from the first moment of knowledge of your\nintent presaged in my heart.  Brothers, you know--or else a long life has\nbeen spent in vain--that my heart and mind are all for the nation--my\nexperience, my life, my handjar.  And when all is for her, why should I\nshrink to exercise on her behalf my riper judgment though the same should\nhave to combat my own ambition?  For ten centuries my race has not failed\nin its duty.  Ages ago the men of that time trusted in the hands of my\nancestors the Kingship, even as now you, their children, trust me.  But\nto me it would be base to betray that trust, even by the smallest tittle.\nThat would I do were I to take the honour of the crown which you have\ntendered to me, so long as there is another more worthy to wear it.  Were\nthere none other, I should place myself in your hands, and yield myself\nover to blind obedience of your desires.  But such an one there is; dear\nto you already by his own deeds, now doubly dear to me, since he is my\nson by my daughter's love.  He is young, whereas I am old.  He is strong\nand brave and true; but my days of the usefulness of strength and bravery\nare over.  For myself, I have long contemplated as the crown of my later\nyears a quiet life in one of our monasteries, where I can still watch the\nwhirl of the world around us on your behalf, and be a counsellor of\nyounger men of more active minds.  Brothers, we are entering on stirring\ntimes.  I can see the signs of their coming all around us.  North and\nSouth--the Old Order and the New, are about to clash, and we lie between\nthe opposing forces.  True it is that the Turk, after warring for a\nthousand years, is fading into insignificance.  But from the North where\nconquests spring, have crept towards our Balkans the men of a mightier\ncomposite Power.  Their march has been steady; and as they came, they\nfortified every step of the way.  Now they are hard upon us, and are\nalready beginning to swallow up the regions that we have helped to win\nfrom the dominion of Mahound.  The Austrian is at our very gates.  Beaten\nback by the Irredentists of Italy, she has so enmeshed herself with the\nGreat Powers of Europe that she seems for the moment to be impregnable to\na foe of our stature.  There is but one hope for us--the uniting of the\nBalkan forces to turn a masterly front to North and West as well as to\nSouth and East.  Is that a task for old hands to undertake?  No; the\nhands must be young and supple; and the brain subtle, as well as the\nheart be strong, of whomsoever would dare such an accomplishment.  Should\nI accept the crown, it would only postpone the doing of that which must\nultimately be done.  What avail would it be if, when the darkness closes\nover me, my daughter should be Queen Consort to the first King of a new\ndynasty?  You know this man, and from your record I learn that you are\nalready willing to have him as King to follow me.  Why not begin with\nhim?  He comes of a great nation, wherein the principle of freedom is a\nvital principle that quickens all things.  That nation has more than once\nshown to us its friendliness; and doubtless the very fact that an\nEnglishman would become our King, and could carry into our Government the\nspirit and customs which have made his own country great, would do much\nto restore the old friendship, and even to create a new one, which would\nin times of trouble bring British fleets to our waters, and British\nbayonets to support our own handjars.  It is within my own knowledge,\nthough as yet unannounced to you, that Rupert Sent Leger has already\nobtained a patent, signed by the King of England himself, allowing him to\nbe denaturalized in England, so that he can at once apply for\nnaturalization here.  I know also that he has brought hither a vast\nfortune, by aid of which he is beginning to strengthen our hands for war,\nin case that sad eventuality should arise.  Witness his late ordering to\nbe built nine other warships of the class that has already done such\neffective service in overthrowing the Turk--or the pirate, whichever he\nmay have been.  He has undertaken the defence of the Blue Mouth at his\nown cost in a way which will make it stronger than Gibraltar, and secure\nus against whatever use to which the Austrian may apply the vast forces\nalready gathered in the Bocche di Cattaro.  He is already founding aerial\nstations on our highest peaks for use of the war aeroplanes which are\nbeing built for him.  It is such a man as this who makes a nation great;\nand right sure I am that in his hands this splendid land and our noble,\nfreedom-loving people will flourish and become a power in the world.\nThen, brothers, let me, as one to whom this nation and its history and\nits future are dear, ask you to give to the husband of my daughter the\nhonour which you would confer on me.  For her I can speak as well as for\nmyself.  She shall suffer nothing in dignity either.  Were I indeed King,\nshe, as my daughter, would be a Princess of the world.  As it will be,\nshe shall be companion and Queen of a great King, and her race, which is\nmine, shall flourish in all the lustre of the new Dynasty.\n\n\"Therefore on all accounts, my brothers, for the sake of our dear Land of\nthe Blue Mountains, make the Gospodar Rupert, who has so proved himself,\nyour King.  And make me happy in my retirement to the cloister.\"\n\nWhen the Voivode ceased to speak, all still remained silent and standing.\nBut there was no mistaking their acquiescence in his most generous\nprayer.  The President of the Council well interpreted the general wish\nwhen he said:\n\n\"Lords of the National Council, Archbishop, Vladika, Lords of the\nCouncils of Justice and National Law, Archimandrites, and all who are\npresent, is it agreed that we prepare at leisure a fitting reply to the\nVoivode Peter of the historic House of Vissarion, stating our agreement\nwith his wish?\"\n\nTo which there was a unanimous answer:\n\n\"It is.\"  He went on:\n\n\"Further.  Shall we ask the Gospodar Rupert of the House of Sent Leger,\nallied through his marriage to the Voivodin Teuta, daughter and only\nchild of the Voivode Peter of Vissarion, to come hither to-morrow?  And\nthat, when he is amongst us, we confer on him the Crown and Kingship of\nthe Land of the Blue Mountains?\"\n\nAgain came the answer: \"It is.\"\n\nBut this time it rang out like the sound of a gigantic trumpet, and the\nhandjars flashed.\n\nWhereupon the session was adjourned for the space of a day.\n\n\n\nTHE SAME--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                     _September_ 10, 1907.\n\nWhen the National Council met to-day the Voivode Peter Vissarion sat with\nthem, but well back, so that at first his presence was hardly noticeable.\nAfter the necessary preliminaries had been gone through, they requested\nthe presence of the Gospodar Rupert--Mr. Rupert Sent Leger--who was\nreported as waiting in the \"Chamber of the High Officers.\"  He at once\naccompanied back to the Hall the deputation sent to conduct him.  As he\nmade his appearance in the doorway the Councillors stood up.  There was a\nburst of enthusiasm, and the handjars flashed.  For an instant he stood\nsilent, with lifted hand, as though indicating that he wished to speak.\nSo soon as this was recognized, silence fell on the assembly, and he\nspoke:\n\n\"I pray you, may the Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion, who has accompanied me\nhither, appear with me to hear your wishes?\"  There was an immediate and\nenthusiastic acquiescence, and, after bowing his thanks, he retired to\nconduct her.\n\nHer appearance was received with an ovation similar to that given to\nGospodar Rupert, to which she bowed with dignified sweetness.  She, with\nher husband, was conducted to the top of the Hall by the President, who\ncame down to escort them.  In the meantime another chair had been placed\nbeside that prepared for the Gospodar, and these two sat.\n\nThe President then made the formal statement conveying to the \"Gospodar\nRupert\" the wishes of the Council, on behalf of the nation, to offer to\nhim the Crown and Kingship of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  The\nmessage was couched in almost the same words as had been used the\nprevious day in making the offer to the Voivode Peter Vissarion, only\ndiffering to meet the special circumstances.  The Gospodar Rupert\nlistened in grave silence.  The whole thing was manifestly quite new to\nhim, but he preserved a self-control wonderful under the circumstances.\nWhen, having been made aware of the previous offer to the Voivode and the\ndeclared wish of the latter, he rose to speak, there was stillness in the\nHall.  He commenced with a few broken words of thanks; then he grew\nsuddenly and strangely calm as he went on:\n\n\"But before I can even attempt to make a fitting reply, I should know if\nit is contemplated to join with me in this great honour my dear wife the\nVoivodin Teuta of Vissarion, who has so splendidly proved her worthiness\nto hold any place in the government of the Land.  I fain would . . . \"\n\nHe was interrupted by the Voivodin, who, standing up beside him and\nholding his left arm, said:\n\n\"Do not, President, and Lords all, think me wanting in that respect of a\nwife for husband which in the Blue Mountains we hold so dear, if I\nventure to interrupt my lord.  I am here, not merely as a wife, but as\nVoivodin of Vissarion, and by the memory of all the noble women of that\nnoble line I feel constrained to a great duty.  We women of Vissarion, in\nall the history of centuries, have never put ourselves forward in rivalry\nof our lords.  Well I know that my own dear lord will forgive me as wife\nif I err; but I speak to you, the Council of the nation, from another\nground and with another tongue.  My lord does not, I fear, know as you\ndo, and as I do too, that of old, in the history of this Land, when\nKingship was existent, that it was ruled by that law of masculine\nsupremacy which, centuries after, became known as the _Lex Salica_.\nLords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I am a wife of the Blue\nMountains--as a wife young as yet, but with the blood of forty\ngenerations of loyal women in my veins.  And it would ill become me, whom\nmy husband honours--wife to the man whom you would honour--to take a part\nin changing the ancient custom which has been held in honour for all the\nthousand years, which is the glory of Blue Mountain womanhood.  What an\nexample such would be in an age when self-seeking women of other nations\nseek to forget their womanhood in the struggle to vie in equality with\nmen!  Men of the Blue Mountains, I speak for our women when I say that we\nhold of greatest price the glory of our men.  To be their companions is\nour happiness; to be their wives is the completion of our lives; to be\nmothers of their children is our share of the glory that is theirs.\n\n\"Therefore, I pray you, men of the Blue Mountains, let me but be as any\nother wife in our land, equal to them in domestic happiness, which is our\nwoman's sphere; and if that priceless honour may be vouchsafed to me, and\nI be worthy and able to bear it, an exemplar of woman's rectitude.\"  With\na low, modest, graceful bow, she sat down.\n\nThere was no doubt as to the reception of her renunciation of Queenly\ndignity.  There was more honour to her in the quick, fierce shout which\narose, and the unanimous upward swing of the handjars, than in the\nwearing of any crown which could adorn the head of woman.\n\nThe spontaneous action of the Gospodar Rupert was another source of joy\nto all--a fitting corollary to what had gone before.  He rose to his\nfeet, and, taking his wife in his arms, kissed her before all.  Then they\nsat down, with their chairs close, bashfully holding hands like a pair of\nlovers.\n\nThen Rupert arose--he is Rupert now; no lesser name is on the lips of his\npeople henceforth.  With an intense earnestness which seemed to glow in\nhis face, he said simply:\n\n\"What can I say except that I am in all ways, now and for ever, obedient\nto your wishes?\"  Then, raising his handjar and holding it before him, he\nkissed the hilt, saying:\n\n\"Hereby I swear to be honest and just--to be, God helping me, such a King\nas you would wish--in so far as the strength is given me.  Amen.\"\n\nThis ended the business of the Session, and the Council showed unmeasured\ndelight.  Again and again the handjars flashed, as the cheers rose \"three\ntimes three\" in British fashion.\n\nWhen Rupert--I am told I must not write him down as \"King Rupert\" until\nafter the formal crowning, which is ordained for Wednesday, October\n16th,--and Teuta had withdrawn, the Voivode Peter Vissarion, the\nPresident and Council conferred in committee with the Presidents of the\nHigh Courts of National Law and of Justice as to the formalities to be\nobserved in the crowning of the King, and of the formal notification to\nbe given to foreign Powers.  These proceedings kept them far into the\nnight.\n\n\n\nFROM \"_The London Messenger_.\"\n\n\nCORONATION FESTIVITIES OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.\n\n(_From our Special Correspondent_.)\n\n                                                                   PLAZAC,\n                                                       _October_ 14, 1907.\n\nAs I sat down to a poorly-equipped luncheon-table on board the\nAustro-Orient liner _Franz Joseph_, I mourned in my heart (and I may say\nincidentally in other portions of my internal economy) the comfort and\ngastronomic luxury of the King and Emperor Hotel at Trieste.  A brief\ncomparison between the menus of to-day's lunch and yesterday's will\nafford to the reader a striking object-lesson:\n_Trieste_.                          _Steamer_.\nEggs a la cocotte.                  Scrambled eggs on toast.\nStewed chicken, with paprika.       Cold chicken.\nDevilled slices of Westphalian      Cold ham.\nham  (boiled in wine).\nTunny fish, pickled.                Bismarck herrings.\nRice, burst in cream.               Stewed apples.\nGuava jelly.                        Swiss cheese.\nConsequence: Yesterday I was well and happy, and looked forward to a good\nnight's sleep, which came off.  To-day I am dull and heavy, also\nrestless, and I am convinced that at sleeping-time my liver will have it\nall its own way.\n\nThe journey to Ragusa, and thence to Plazac, is writ large with a pigment\nof misery on at least one human heart.  Let a silence fall upon it!  In\nsuch wise only can Justice and Mercy join hands.\n\nPlazac is a miserable place.  There is not a decent hotel in it.  It was\nperhaps on this account that the new King, Rupert, had erected for the\nalleged convenience of his guests of the Press a series of large\ntemporary hotels, such as were in evidence at the St. Louis Exposition.\nHere each guest was given a room to himself, somewhat after the nature of\nthe cribs in a Rowton house.  From my first night in it I am able to\nspeak from experience of the sufferings of a prisoner of the third class.\nI am, however, bound to say that the dining and reception rooms were,\nthough uncomfortably plain, adequate for temporary use.  Happily we shall\nnot have to endure many more meals here, as to-morrow we all dine with\nthe King in the State House; and as the cuisine is under the control of\nthat _cordon bleu_, Gaston de Faux Pas, who so long controlled the\ngastronomic (we might almost say Gastonomic) destinies of the Rois des\nDiamants in the Place Vendome, we may, I think, look forward to not going\nto bed hungry.  Indeed, the anticipations formed from a survey of our\nmeagre sleeping accommodation were not realized at dinnertime to-night.\nTo our intense astonishment, an excellent dinner was served, though, to\nbe sure, the cold dishes predominated (a thing I always find bad for\none's liver).  Just as we were finishing, the King (nominated) came\namongst us in quite an informal way, and, having bidden us a hearty\nwelcome, asked that we should drink a glass of wine together.  This we\ndid in an excellent (if rather sweet) glass of Cliquot '93.  King Rupert\n(nominated) then asked us to resume our seats.  He walked between the\ntables, now and again recognizing some journalistic friend whom he had\nmet early in life in his days of adventure.  The men spoken to seemed\nvastly pleased--with themselves probably.  Pretty bad form of them, I\ncall it!  For myself, I was glad I had not previously met him in the same\ncasual way, as it saved me from what I should have felt a\nhumiliation--the being patronized in that public way by a prospective\nKing who had not (in a Court sense) been born.  The writer, who is by\nprofession a barrister-at-law, is satisfied at being himself a county\ngentleman and heir to an historic estate in the ancient county of Salop,\nwhich can boast a larger population than the Land of the Blue Mountains.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTE.--We must ask our readers to pardon the report in\nyesterday's paper sent from Plazac.  The writer was not on our regular\nstaff, but asked to be allowed to write the report, as he was a kinsman\nof King Rupert of the Blue Mountains, and would therefore be in a\nposition to obtain special information and facilities of description\n\"from inside,\" as he puts it.  On reading the paper, we cabled his\nrecall; we cabled also, in case he did not obey, to have his ejectment\neffected forthwith.\n\nWe have also cabled Mr. Mordred Booth, the well-known correspondent, who\nwas, to our knowledge, in Plazac for his own purposes, to send us full\n(and proper) details.  We take it our readers will prefer a graphic\naccount of the ceremony to a farrago of cheap menus, comments on his own\nliver, and a belittling of an Englishman of such noble character and\nachievements that a rising nation has chosen him for their King, and one\nwhom our own nation loves to honour.  We shall not, of course, mention\nour abortive correspondent's name, unless compelled thereto by any future\nutterance of his.\n\n\n\nFROM \"_The London Messenger_.\"\n\n\nTHE CORONATION OF KING RUPERT OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.\n\n(_By our Special Correspondent_, _Mordred Booth_.)\n\n                                                                   PLAZAC,\n                                                       _October_ 17, 1907.\n\nPlazac does not boast of a cathedral or any church of sufficient\ndimensions for a coronation ceremony on an adequate scale.  It was\ntherefore decided by the National Council, with the consent of the King,\nthat it should be held at the old church of St. Sava at Vissarion--the\nformer home of the Queen.  Accordingly, arrangements had been made to\nbring thither on the warships on the morning of the coronation the whole\nof the nation's guests.  In St. Sava's the religious ceremony would take\nplace, after which there would be a banquet in the Castle of Vissarion.\nThe guests would then return on the warships to Plazac, where would be\nheld what is called here the \"National Coronation.\"\n\nIn the Land of the Blue Mountains it was customary in the old days, when\nthere were Kings, to have two ceremonies--one carried out by the official\nhead of the national Church, the Greek Church; the other by the people in\na ritual adopted by themselves, on much the same basis as the Germanic\nFolk-Moot.  The Blue Mountains is a nation of strangely loyal tendencies.\nWhat was a thousand years ago is to be to-day--so far, of course, as is\npossible under the altered condition of things.\n\nThe church of St. Sava is very old and very beautiful, built in the\nmanner of old Greek churches, full of monuments of bygone worthies of the\nBlue Mountains.  But, of course, neither it nor the ceremony held in it\nto-day can compare in splendour with certain other ceremonials--for\ninstance, the coronation of the penultimate Czar in Moscow, of Alfonso\nXII. in Madrid, of Carlos I. in Lisbon.\n\nThe church was arranged much after the fashion of Westminster Abbey for\nthe coronation of King Edward VII., though, of course, not so many\npersons present, nor so much individual splendour.  Indeed, the number of\nthose present, outside those officially concerned and the Press of the\nworld, was very few.\n\nThe most striking figure present--next to King Rupert, who is seven feet\nhigh and a magnificent man--was the Queen Consort, Teuta.  She sat in\nfront of a small gallery erected for the purpose just opposite the\nthrone.  She is a strikingly beautiful woman, tall and finely-formed,\nwith jet-black hair and eyes like black diamonds, but with the unique\nquality that there are stars in them which seem to take varied colour\naccording to each strong emotion.  But it was not even her beauty or the\nstars in her eyes which drew the first glance of all.  These details\nshowed on scrutiny, but from afar off the attractive point was her dress.\nSurely never before did woman, be she Queen or peasant, wear such a\ncostume on a festive occasion.\n\nShe was dressed in a white _Shroud_, and in that only.  I had heard\nsomething of the story which goes behind that strange costume, and shall\nlater on send it to you. {2}\n\nWhen the procession entered the church through the great western door,\nthe national song of the Blue Mountains, \"Guide our feet through\ndarkness, O Jehovah,\" was sung by an unseen choir, in which the organ,\nsupplemented by martial instruments, joined.  The Archbishop was robed in\nreadiness before the altar, and close around him stood the Archimandrites\nof the four great monasteries.  The Vladika stood in front of the Members\nof the National Council.  A little to one side of this body was a group\nof high officials, Presidents of the Councils of National Law and\nJustice, the Chancellor, etc.--all in splendid robes of great\nantiquity--the High Marshall of the Forces and the Lord high Admiral.\n\nWhen all was ready for the ceremonial act of coronation, the Archbishop\nraised his hand, whereupon the music ceased.  Turning around, so that he\nfaced the Queen, who thereon stood up, the King drew his handjar and\nsaluted her in Blue Mountain fashion--the point raised as high possible,\nand then dropped down till it almost touches the ground.  Every man in\nthe church, ecclesiastics and all, wear the handjar, and, following the\nKing by the interval of a second, their weapons flashed out.  There was\nsomething symbolic, as well as touching, in this truly royal salute, led\nby the King.  His handjar is a mighty blade, and held high in the hands\nof a man of his stature, it overtowered everything in the church.  It was\nan inspiriting sight.  No one who saw will ever forget that noble\nflashing of blades in the thousand-year-old salute . . .\n\nThe coronation was short, simple, and impressive.  Rupert knelt whilst\nthe Archbishop, after a short, fervent prayer, placed on his head the\nbronze crown of the first King of the Blue Mountains, Peter.  This was\nhanded to him by the Vladika, to whom it was brought from the National\nTreasury by a procession of the high officers.  A blessing of the new\nKing and his Queen Teuta concluded the ceremony.  Rupert's first act on\nrising from his knees was to draw his handjar and salute his people.\n\nAfter the ceremony in St. Sava, the procession was reformed, and took its\nway to the Castle of Vissarion, which is some distance off across a\npicturesque creek, bounded on either side by noble cliffs of vast height.\nThe King led the way, the Queen walking with him and holding his hand . .\n. The Castle of Vissarion is of great antiquity, and picturesque beyond\nbelief.  I am sending later on, as a special article, a description of it\n. . .\n\nThe \"Coronation Feast,\" as it was called on the menu, was held in the\nGreat Hall, which is of noble proportions.  I enclose copy of the menu,\nas our readers may wish to know something of the details of such a feast\nin this part of the world.\n\nOne feature of the banquet was specially noticeable.  As the National\nOfficials were guests of the King and Queen, they were waited on and\nserved by the King and Queen in person.  The rest of the guests,\nincluding us of the Press, were served by the King's household, not the\nservants--none of that cult were visible--but by the ladies and gentlemen\nof the Court.\n\nThere was only one toast, and that was given by the King, all standing:\n\"The Land of the Blue Mountains, and may we all do our duty to the Land\nwe love!\"  Before drinking, his mighty handjar flashed out again, and in\nan instant every table at which the Blue Mountaineers sat was ringed with\nflashing steel.  I may add parenthetically that the handjar is\nessentially the national weapon.  I do not know if the Blue Mountaineers\ntake it to bed with them, but they certainly wear it everywhere else.\nIts drawing seems to emphasize everything in national life . . .\n\nWe embarked again on the warships--one a huge, steel-plated Dreadnought,\nup to date in every particular, the other an armoured yacht most complete\nin every way, and of unique speed.  The King and Queen, the Lords of the\nCouncil, together with the various high ecclesiastics and great\nofficials, went on the yacht, which the Lord High Admiral, a man of\nremarkably masterful physiognomy, himself steered.  The rest of those\npresent at the Coronation came on the warship.  The latter went fast, but\nthe yacht showed her heels all the way.  However, the King's party waited\nin the dock in the Blue Mouth.  From this a new cable-line took us all to\nthe State House at Plazac.  Here the procession was reformed, and wound\nits way to a bare hill in the immediate vicinity.  The King and\nQueen--the King still wearing the ancient bronze crown with which the\nArchbishop had invested him at St. Sava's--the Archbishop, the Vladika,\nand the four Archimandrites stood together at the top of the hill, the\nKing and Queen being, of course, in the front.  A courteous young\ngentleman, to whom I had been accredited at the beginning of the day--all\nguests were so attended--explained to me that, as this was the national\nas opposed to the religious ceremony, the Vladika, who is the official\nrepresentative of the laity, took command here.  The ecclesiastics were\nput prominently forward, simply out of courtesy, in obedience to the wish\nof the people, by whom they were all greatly beloved.\n\nThen commenced another unique ceremony, which, indeed, might well find a\nplace in our Western countries.  As far as ever we could see were masses\nof men roughly grouped, not in any uniform, but all in national costume,\nand armed only with the handjar.  In the front of each of these groups or\nbodies stood the National Councillor for that district, distinguishable\nby his official robe and chain.  There were in all seventeen of these\nbodies.  These were unequal in numbers, some of them predominating\nenormously over others, as, indeed, might be expected in so mountainous a\ncountry.  In all there were present, I was told, over a hundred thousand\nmen.  So far as I can judge from long experience of looking at great\nbodies of men, the estimate was a just one.  I was a little surprised to\nsee so many, for the population of the Blue Mountains is never accredited\nin books of geography as a large one.  When I made inquiry as to how the\nfrontier guard was being for the time maintained, I was told:\n\n\"By the women mainly.  But, all the same, we have also a male guard which\ncovers the whole frontier except that to seaward.  Each man has with him\nsix women, so that the whole line is unbroken.  Moreover, sir, you must\nbear in mind that in the Blue Mountains our women are trained to arms as\nwell as our men--ay, and they could give a good account of themselves,\ntoo, against any foe that should assail us.  Our history shows what women\ncan do in defence.  I tell you, the Turkish population would be bigger\nto-day but for the women who on our frontier fought of old for defence of\ntheir homes!\"\n\n\"No wonder this nation has kept her freedom for a thousand years!\" I\nsaid.\n\nAt a signal given by the President of the National Council one of the\nDivisions moved forwards.  It was not an ordinary movement, but an\nintense rush made with all the _elan_ and vigour of hardy and\nhighly-trained men.  They came on, not merely at the double, but as if\ndelivering an attack.  Handjar in hand, they rushed forward.  I can only\ncompare their rush to an artillery charge or to an attack of massed\ncavalry battalions.  It was my fortune to see the former at Magenta and\nthe latter at Sadowa, so that I know what such illustration means.  I may\nalso say that I saw the relief column which Roberts organized rush\nthrough a town on its way to relieve Mafeking; and no one who had the\ndelight of seeing that inspiring progress of a flying army on their way\nto relieve their comrades needs to be told what a rush of armed men can\nbe.  With speed which was simply desperate they ran up the hill, and,\ncircling to the left, made a ring round the topmost plateau, where stood\nthe King.  When the ring was complete, the stream went on lapping round\nand round till the whole tally was exhausted.  In the meantime another\nDivision had followed, its leader joining close behind the end of the\nfirst.  Then came another and another.  An unbroken line circled and\ncircled round the hill in seeming endless array, till the whole slopes\nwere massed with moving men, dark in colour, and with countless\nglittering points everywhere.  When the whole of the Divisions had thus\nsurrounded the King, there was a moment's hush--a silence so still that\nit almost seemed as if Nature stood still also.  We who looked on were\nalmost afraid to breathe.\n\nThen suddenly, without, so far as I could see, any fugleman or word of\ncommand, the handjars of all that mighty array of men flashed upward as\none, and like thunder pealed the National cry:\n\n\"The Blue Mountains and Duty!\"\n\nAfter the cry there was a strange subsidence which made the onlooker rub\nhis eyes.  It seemed as though the whole mass of fighting men had\npartially sunk into the ground.  Then the splendid truth burst upon\nus--the whole nation was kneeling at the feet of their chosen King, who\nstood upright.\n\nAnother moment of silence, as King Rupert, taking off his crown, held it\nup in his left hand, and, holding his great handjar high in his right,\ncried in a voice so strong that it came ringing over that serried mass\nlike a trumpet:\n\n\"To Freedom of our Nation, and to Freedom within it, I dedicate these and\nmyself.  I swear!\"\n\nSo saying, he, too, sank on his knees, whilst we all instinctively\nuncovered.\n\nThe silence which followed lasted several seconds; then, without a sign,\nas though one and all acted instinctively, the whole body stood up.\nThereupon was executed a movement which, with all my experience of\nsoldiers and war, I never saw equalled--not with the Russian Royal Guard\nsaluting the Czar at his Coronation, not with an impi of Cetewayo's Zulus\nwhirling through the opening of a kraal.\n\nFor a second or two the whole mass seemed to writhe or shudder, and then,\nlo! the whole District Divisions were massed again in completeness, its\nCouncillors next the King, and the Divisions radiating outwards down the\nhill like wedges.\n\nThis completed the ceremony, and everything broke up into units.  Later,\nI was told by my official friend that the King's last movement--the oath\nas he sank to his knees--was an innovation of his own.  All I can say is,\nif, in the future, and for all time, it is not taken for a precedent, and\nmade an important part of the Patriotic Coronation ceremony, the Blue\nMountaineers will prove themselves to be a much more stupid people than\nthey seem at present to be.\n\nThe conclusion of the Coronation festivities was a time of unalloyed joy.\nIt was the banquet given to the King and Queen by the nation; the guests\nof the nation were included in the royal party.  It was a unique\nceremony.  Fancy a picnic-party of a hundred thousand persons, nearly all\nmen.  There must have been made beforehand vast and elaborate\npreparations, ramifying through the whole nation.  Each section had\nbrought provisions sufficient for their own consumption in addition to\nseveral special dishes for the guest-tables; but the contribution of each\nsection was not consumed by its own members.\n\nIt was evidently a part of the scheme that all should derive from a\ncommon stock, so that the feeling of brotherhood and common property\nshould be preserved in this monumental fashion.\n\nThe guest-tables were the only tables to be seen.  The bulk of the\nfeasters sat on the ground.  The tables were brought forward by the men\nthemselves--no such thing as domestic service was known on this day--from\na wood close at hand, where they and the chairs had been placed in\nreadiness.  The linen and crockery used had been sent for the purpose\nfrom the households of every town and village.  The flowers were plucked\nin the mountains early that morning by the children, and the gold and\nsilver plate used for adornment were supplied from the churches.  Each\ndish at the guest-tables was served by the men of each section in turn.\n\nOver the whole array seemed to be spread an atmosphere of joyousness, of\npeace, of brotherhood.  It would be impossible to adequately describe\nthat amazing scene, a whole nation of splendid men surrounding their new\nKing and Queen, loving to honour and serve them.  Scattered about through\nthat vast crowd were groups of musicians, chosen from amongst themselves.\nThe space covered by this titanic picnic was so vast that there were few\nspots from which you could hear music proceeding from different quarters.\n\nAfter dinner we all sat and smoked; the music became rather vocal than\ninstrumental--indeed, presently we did not hear the sound of any\ninstrument at all.  Only knowing a few words of Balkan, I could not\nfollow the meanings of the songs, but I gathered that they were all\nlegendary or historical.  To those who could understand, as I was\ninformed by my tutelary young friend, who stayed beside me the whole of\nthis memorable day, we were listening to the history of the Land of the\nBlue Mountains in ballad form.  Somewhere or other throughout that vast\nconcourse each notable record of ten centuries was being told to eager\nears.\n\nIt was now late in the day.  Slowly the sun had been dropping down over\nthe Calabrian Mountains, and the glamorous twilight was stealing over the\nimmediate scene.  No one seemed to notice the coming of the dark, which\nstole down on us with an unspeakable mystery.  For long we sat still, the\nclatter of many tongues becoming stilled into the witchery of the scene.\nLower the sun sank, till only the ruddiness of the afterglow lit the\nexpanse with rosy light; then this failed in turn, and the night shut\ndown quickly.\n\nAt last, when we could just discern the faces close to us, a simultaneous\nmovement began.  Lights began to flash out in places all over the\nhillside.  At first these seemed as tiny as glow-worms seen in a summer\nwood, but by degrees they grew till the space was set with little circles\nof light.  These in turn grew and grew in both number and strength.\nFlames began to leap out from piles of wood, torches were lighted and\nheld high.  Then the music began again, softly at first, but then louder\nas the musicians began to gather to the centre, where sat the King and\nQueen.  The music was wild and semi-barbaric, but full of sweet melody.\nIt somehow seemed to bring before us a distant past; one and all,\naccording to the strength of our imagination and the volume of our\nknowledge, saw episodes and phases of bygone history come before us.\nThere was a wonderful rhythmic, almost choric, force in the time kept,\nwhich made it almost impossible to sit still.  It was an invitation to\nthe dance such as I had never before heard in any nation or at any time.\nThen the lights began to gather round.  Once more the mountaineers took\nsomething of the same formation as at the crowning.  Where the royal\nparty sat was a level mead, with crisp, short grass, and round it what\none might well call the Ring of the Nation was formed.\n\nThe music grew louder.  Each mountaineer who had not a lit torch already\nlighted one, and the whole rising hillside was a glory of light.  The\nQueen rose, and the King an instant after.  As they rose men stepped\nforward and carried away their chairs, or rather thrones.  The Queen gave\nthe King her hand--this is, it seems, the privilege of the wife as\ndistinguished from any other woman.  Their feet took the time of the\nmusic, and they moved into the centre of the ring.\n\nThat dance was another thing to remember, won from the haunting memories\nof that strange day.  At first the King and Queen danced all alone.  They\nbegan with stately movement, but as the music quickened their feet kept\ntime, and the swing of their bodies with movements kept growing more and\nmore ecstatic at every beat till, in true Balkan fashion, the dance\nbecame a very agony of passionate movement.\n\nAt this point the music slowed down again, and the mountaineers began to\njoin in the dance.  At first slowly, one by one, they joined in, the\nVladika and the higher priests leading; then everywhere the whole vast\ncrowd began to dance, till the earth around us seemed to shake.  The\nlights quivered, flickered, blazed out again, and rose and fell as that\nhundred thousand men, each holding a torch, rose and fell with the rhythm\nof the dance.  Quicker, quicker grew the music, faster grew the rushing\nand pounding of the feet, till the whole nation seemed now in an ecstasy.\n\nI stood near the Vladika, and in the midst of this final wildness I saw\nhim draw from his belt a short, thin flute; then he put it to his lips\nand blew a single note--a fierce, sharp note, which pierced the volume of\nsound more surely than would the thunder of a cannon-shot.  On the\ninstant everywhere each man put his torch under his foot.\n\nThere was complete and immediate darkness, for the fires, which had by\nnow fallen low, had evidently been trodden out in the measure of the\ndance.  The music still kept in its rhythmic beat, but slower than it had\nyet been.  Little by little this beat was pointed and emphasized by the\nclapping of hands--at first only a few, but spreading till everyone\npresent was beating hands to the slow music in the darkness.  This lasted\na little while, during which, looking round, I noticed a faint light\nbeginning to steal up behind the hills.  The moon was rising.\n\nAgain there came a note from the Vladika's flute--a single note, sweet\nand subtle, which I can only compare with a note from a nightingale,\nvastly increased in powers.  It, too, won through the thunder of the\nhand-claps, and on the second the sound ceased.  The sudden stillness,\ntogether with the darkness, was so impressive that we could almost hear\nour hearts beating.  And then came through the darkness the most\nbeautiful and impressive sound heard yet.  That mighty concourse, without\nfugleman of any sort, began, in low, fervent voice, to sing the National\nAnthem.  At first it was of so low tone as to convey the idea of a mighty\nassembly of violinists playing with the mutes on.  But it gradually rose\ntill the air above us seemed to throb and quiver.  Each syllable--each\nword--spoken in unison by the vast throng was as clearly enunciated as\nthough spoken by a single voice:\n\n\"Guide our feet through darkness, O Jehovah.\"\n\nThis anthem, sung out of full hearts, remains on our minds as the last\nperfection of a perfect day.  For myself, I am not ashamed to own that it\nmade me weep like a child.  Indeed, I cannot write of it now as I would;\nit unmans me so!\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nIn the early morning, whilst the mountains were still rather grey than\nblue, the cable-line took us to the Blue Mouth, where we embarked in the\nKing's yacht, _The Lady_, which took us across the Adriatic at a pace\nwhich I had hitherto considered impossible.  The King and Queen came to\nthe landing to see us off.  They stood together at the right-hand side of\nthe red-carpeted gangway, and shook hands with each guest as he went on\nboard.  The instant the last passenger had stepped on deck the gangway\nwas withdrawn.  The Lord High Admiral, who stood on the bridge, raised\nhis hand, and we swept towards the mouth of the gulf.  Of course, all\nhats were off, and we cheered frantically.  I can truly say that if King\nRupert and Queen Teuta should ever wish to found in the Blue Mountains a\ncolony of diplomatists and journalists, those who were their guests on\nthis great occasion will volunteer to a man.  I think old Hempetch, who\nis the doyen of English-speaking journalists, voiced our sentiments when\nhe said:\n\n\"May God bless them and theirs with every grace and happiness, and send\nprosperity to the Land and the rule!\"  I think the King and Queen heard\nus cheer, they turned to look at our flying ship again.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IX: BALKA\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_ (_Longe Intervallo_).\n\n\n                                                      _February_ 10, 1908.\n\nIt is so long since I even thought of this journal that I hardly know\nwhere to begin.  I always heard that a married man is a pretty busy man;\nbut since I became one, though it is a new life to me, and of a happiness\nundreamt of, I _know_ what that life is.  But I had no idea that this\nKing business was anything like what it is.  Why, it never leaves me a\nmoment at all to myself--or, what is worse, to Teuta.  If people who\ncondemn Kings had only a single month of my life in that capacity, they\nwould form an opinion different from that which they hold.  It might be\nuseful to have a Professor of Kingship in the Anarchists'\nCollege--whenever it is founded!\n\nEverything has gone on well with us, I am glad to say.  Teuta is in\nsplendid health, though she has--but only very lately--practically given\nup going on her own aeroplane.  It was, I know, a great sacrifice to\nmake, just as she had become an expert at it.  They say here that she is\none of the best drivers in the Blue Mountains--and that is in the world,\nfor we have made that form of movement our own.  Ever since we found the\npitch-blende pockets in the Great Tunnel, and discovered the simple\nprocess of extracting the radium from it, we have gone on by leaps and\nbounds.  When first Teuta told me she would \"aero\" no more for a while, I\nthought she was wise, and backed her up in it: for driving an aeroplane\nis trying work and hard on the nerves.  I only learned then the reason\nfor her caution--the usual one of a young wife.  That was three months\nago, and only this morning she told me she would not go sailing in the\nair, even with me, till she could do so \"without risk\"--she did not mean\nrisk to herself.  Aunt Janet knew what she meant, and counselled her\nstrongly to stick to her resolution.  So for the next few months I am to\ndo my air-sailing alone.\n\nThe public works which we began immediately after the Coronation are\ngoing strong.  We began at the very beginning on an elaborate system.\nThe first thing was to adequately fortify the Blue Mouth.  Whilst the\nfortifications were being constructed we kept all the warships in the\ngulf.  But when the point of safety was reached, we made the ships do\nsentry-go along the coast, whilst we trained men for service at sea.  It\nis our plan to take by degrees all the young men and teach them this\nwise, so that at the end the whole population shall be trained for sea as\nwell as for land.  And as we are teaching them the airship service, too,\nthey will be at home in all the elements--except fire, of course, though\nif that should become a necessity, we shall tackle it too!\n\nWe started the Great Tunnel at the farthest inland point of the Blue\nMouth, and ran it due east at an angle of 45 degrees, so that, when\ncomplete, it would go right through the first line of hills, coming out\non the plateau Plazac.  The plateau is not very wide--half a mile at\nmost--and the second tunnel begins on the eastern side of it.  This new\ntunnel is at a smaller angle, as it has to pierce the second hill--a\nmountain this time.  When it comes out on the east side of that, it will\ntap the real productive belt.  Here it is that our hardwood-trees are\nfinest, and where the greatest mineral deposits are found.  This plateau\nis of enormous length, and runs north arid south round the great bulk of\nthe central mountain, so that in time, when we put up a circular railway,\nwe can bring, at a merely nominal cost, all sorts of material up or down.\nIt is on this level that we have built the great factories for war\nmaterial.  We are tunnelling into the mountains, where are the great\ndeposits of coal.  We run the trucks in and out on the level, and can get\nperfect ventilation with little cost or labour.  Already we are mining\nall the coal which we consume within our own confines, and we can, if we\nwish, within a year export largely.  The great slopes of these tunnels\ngive us the necessary aid of specific gravity, and as we carry an endless\nwater-supply in great tubes that way also, we can do whatever we wish by\nhydraulic power.  As one by one the European and Asiatic nations began to\nreduce their war preparations, we took over their disbanded workmen\nthough our agents, so that already we have a productive staff of skilled\nworkmen larger than anywhere else in the world.  I think myself that we\nwere fortunate in being able to get ahead so fast with our preparations\nfor war manufacture, for if some of the \"Great Powers,\" as they call\nthemselves, knew the measure of our present production, they would\nimmediately try to take active measures against us.  In such case we\nshould have to fight them, which would delay us.  But if we can have\nanother year untroubled, we shall, so far as war material is concerned,\nbe able to defy any nation in the world.  And if the time may only come\npeacefully till we have our buildings and machinery complete, we can\nprepare war-stores and implements for the whole Balkan nations.  And\nthen--But that is a dream.  We shall know in good time.\n\nIn the meantime all goes well.  The cannon foundries are built and\nactive.  We are already beginning to turn out finished work.  Of course,\nour first guns are not very large, but they are good.  The big guns, and\nespecially siege-guns, will come later.  And when the great extensions\nare complete, and the boring and wire-winding machines are in working\norder, we can go merrily on.  I suppose that by that time the whole of\nthe upper plateau will be like a manufacturing town--at any rate, we have\nplenty of raw material to hand.  The haematite mines seem to be\ninexhaustible, and as the raising of the ore is cheap and easy by means\nof our extraordinary water-power, and as coal comes down to the plateau\nby its own gravity on the cable-line, we have natural advantages which\nexist hardly anywhere else in the world--certainly not all together, as\nhere.  That bird's eye view of the Blue Mouth which we had from the\naeroplane when Teuta saw that vision of the future has not been in vain.\nThe aeroplane works are having a splendid output.  The aeroplane is a\nlarge and visible product; there is no mistaking when it is there!  We\nhave already a large and respectable aerial fleet.  The factories for\nexplosives are, of course, far away in bare valleys, where accidental\neffects are minimized.  So, too, are the radium works, wherein unknown\ndangers may lurk.  The turbines in the tunnel give us all the power we\nwant at present, and, later on, when the new tunnel, which we call the\n\"water tunnel,\" which is already begun, is complete, the available power\nwill be immense.  All these works are bringing up our shipping, and we\nare in great hopes for the future.\n\nSo much for our material prosperity.  But with it comes a larger life and\ngreater hopes.  The stress of organizing and founding these great works\nis practically over.  As they are not only self-supporting, but largely\nproductive, all anxiety in the way of national expenditure is minimized.\nAnd, more than all, I am able to give my unhampered attention to those\nmatters of even more than national importance on which the ultimate\ndevelopment, if not the immediate strength, of our country must depend.\n\nI am well into the subject of a great Balkan Federation.  This, it turns\nout, has for long been the dream of Teuta's life, as also that of the\npresent Archimandrite of Plazac, her father, who, since I last touched\nthis journal, having taken on himself a Holy Life, was, by will of the\nChurch, the Monks, and the People, appointed to that great office on the\nretirement of Petrof Vlastimir.\n\nSuch a Federation had long been in the air.  For myself, I had seen its\ninevitableness from the first.  The modern aggressions of the Dual\nNation, interpreted by her past history with regard to Italy, pointed\ntowards the necessity of such a protective measure.  And now, when Servia\nand Bulgaria were used as blinds to cover her real movements to\nincorporate with herself as established the provinces, once Turkish,\nwhich had been entrusted to her temporary protection by the Treaty of\nBerlin; when it would seem that Montenegro was to be deprived for all\ntime of the hope of regaining the Bocche di Cattaro, which she had a\ncentury ago won, and held at the point of the sword, until a Great Power\nhad, under a wrong conviction, handed it over to her neighbouring\nGoliath; when the Sandjack of Novi-Bazar was threatened with the fate\nwhich seemed to have already overtaken Bosnia and Herzegovina; when\ngallant little Montenegro was already shut out from the sea by the\noctopus-like grip of Dalmatia crouching along her western shore; when\nTurkey was dwindling down to almost ineptitude; when Greece was almost a\nbyword, and when Albania as a nation--though still nominally subject--was\nof such unimpaired virility that there were great possibilities of her\nfuture, it was imperative that something must happen if the Balkan race\nwas not to be devoured piecemeal by her northern neighbours.  To the end\nof ultimate protection I found most of them willing to make defensive\nalliance.\n\nAnd as the true defence consists in judicious attack, I have no doubt\nthat an alliance so based must ultimately become one for all purposes.\nAlbania was the most difficult to win to the scheme, as her own\ncomplications with her suzerain, combined with the pride and\nsuspiciousness of her people, made approach a matter of extreme caution.\nIt was only possible when I could induce her rulers to see that, no\nmatter how great her pride and valour, the magnitude of northern advance,\nif unchecked, must ultimately overwhelm her.\n\nI own that this map-making was nervous work, for I could not shut my eyes\nto the fact that German lust of enlargement lay behind Austria's advance.\nAt and before that time expansion was the dominant idea of the three\nGreat Powers of Central Europe.  Russia went eastward, hoping to gather\nto herself the rich north-eastern provinces of China, till ultimately she\nshould dominate the whole of Northern Europe and Asia from the Gulf of\nFinland to the Yellow Sea.  Germany wished to link the North Sea to the\nMediterranean by her own territory, and thus stand as a flawless barrier\nacross Europe from north to south.\n\nWhen Nature should have terminated the headship of the Empire-Kingdom,\nshe, as natural heir, would creep southward through the German-speaking\nprovinces.  Thus Austria, of course kept in ignorance of her neighbour's\nultimate aims, had to extend towards the south.  She had been barred in\nher western movement by the rise of the Irredentist party in Italy, and\nconsequently had to withdraw behind the frontiers of Carinthia, Carniola,\nand Istria.\n\nMy own dream of the new map was to make \"Balka\"--the Balkan\nFederation--take in ultimately all south of a line drawn from the Isle of\nSerpents to Aquileia.  There would--must--be difficulties in the carrying\nout of such a scheme.  Of course, it involved Austria giving up Dalmatia,\nIstria, and Sclavonia, as well as a part of Croatia and the Hungarian\nBanat.  On the contrary, she might look for centuries of peace in the\nsouth.  But it would make for peace so strongly that each of the States\nimpinging on it would find it worth while to make a considerable\nsacrifice to have it effected.  To its own integers it would offer a\nlasting settlement of interests which at present conflicted, and a share\nin a new world-power.  Each of these integers would be absolutely\nself-governing and independent, being only united for purposes of mutual\ngood.  I did not despair that even Turkey and Greece, recognizing that\nbenefit and safety would ensue without the destruction or even minimizing\nof individuality, would, sooner or later, come into the Federation.  The\nmatter is already so far advanced that within a month the various rulers\nof the States involved are to have a secret and informal meeting.\nDoubtless some larger plan and further action will be then evolved.  It\nwill be an anxious time for all in this zone--and outside it--till this\nmatter is all settled.  In any case, the manufacture of war material will\ngo on until it is settled, one way or another.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                          _March_ 6, 1908.\n\nI breathe more freely.  The meeting has taken place here at Vissarion.\nNominal cause of meeting: a hunting-party in the Blue Mountains.  Not any\nformal affair.  Not a Chancellor or Secretary of State or Diplomatist of\nany sort present.  All headquarters.  It was, after all, a real\nhunting-party.  Good sportsmen, plenty of game, lots of beaters,\neverything organized properly, and an effective tally of results.  I\nthink we all enjoyed ourselves in the matter of sport; and as the\npolitical result was absolute unanimity of purpose and intention, there\ncould be no possible cause of complaint.\n\nSo it is all decided.  Everything is pacific.  There is not a suggestion\neven of war, revolt, or conflicting purpose of any kind.  We all go on\nexactly as we are doing for another year, pursuing our own individual\nobjects, just as at present.  But we are all to see that in our own\nhouseholds order prevails.  All that is supposed to be effective is to be\nkept in good working order, and whatever is, at present, not adequate to\npossibilities is to be made so.  This is all simply protective and\ndefensive.  We understand each other.  But if any hulking stranger should\nundertake to interfere in our domestic concerns, we shall all unite on\nthe instant to keep things as we wish them to remain.  We shall be ready.\nAlfred's maxim of Peace shall be once more exemplified.  In the meantime\nthe factories shall work overtime in our own mountains, and the output\nshall be for the general good of our special community--the bill to be\nsettled afterwards amicably.  There can hardly be any difference of\nopinion about that, as the others will be the consumers of our surplus\nproducts.  We are the producers, who produce for ourselves first, and\nthen for the limited market of those within the Ring.  As we undertake to\nguard our own frontiers--sea and land--and are able to do so, the goods\nare to be warehoused in the Blue Mountains until required--if at all--for\nparticipation in the markets of the world, and especially in the European\nmarket.  If all goes well and the markets are inactive, the goods shall\nbe duly delivered to the purchasers as arranged.\n\nSo much for the purely mercantile aspect.\n\n\n\nTHE VOIVODIN JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.\n\n\n                                                           _May_ 21, 1908.\n\nAs Rupert began to neglect his Journal when he was made a King, so, too,\nI find in myself a tendency to leave writing to other people.  But one\nthing I shall not be content to leave to others--little Rupert.  The baby\nof Rupert and Teuta is much too precious a thing to be spoken of except\nwith love, quite independent of the fact that he will be, in natural\ncourse, a King!  So I have promised Teuta that whatever shall be put into\nthis record of the first King of the Sent Leger Dynasty relating to His\nRoyal Highness the Crown Prince shall only appear in either her hand or\nmy own.  And she has deputed the matter to me.\n\nOur dear little Prince arrived punctually and in perfect condition.  The\nangels that carried him evidently took the greatest care of him, and\nbefore they left him they gave him dower of all their best.  He is a\ndear!  Like both his father and his mother, and that says everything.  My\nown private opinion is that he is a born King!  He does not know what\nfear is, and he thinks more of everyone else than he does of his dear\nlittle self.  And if those things do not show a truly royal nature, I do\nnot know what does . . .\n\nTeuta has read this.  She held up a warning finger, and said:\n\n\"Aunt Janet dear, that is all true.  He is a dear, and a King, and an\nangel!  But we mustn't have too much about him just yet.  This book is to\nbe about Rupert.  So our little man can only be what we shall call a\ncorollary.\"  And so it is.\n\nI should mention here that the book is Teuta's idea.  Before little\nRupert came she controlled herself wonderfully, doing only what was\nthought best for her under the circumstances.  As I could see that it\nwould be a help for her to have some quiet occupation which would\ninterest her without tiring her, I looked up (with his permission, of\ncourse) all Rupert's old letters and diaries, and journals and\nreports--all that I had kept for him during his absences on his\nadventures.  At first I was a little afraid they might harm her, for at\ntimes she got so excited over some things that I had to caution her.\nHere again came in her wonderful self-control.  I think the most soothing\nargument I used with her was to point out that the dear boy had come\nthrough all the dangers safely, and was actually with us, stronger and\nnobler than ever.\n\nAfter we had read over together the whole matter several times--for it\nwas practically new to me too, and I got nearly as excited as she was,\nthough I have known him so much longer--we came to the conclusion that\nthis particular volume would have to be of selected matter.  There is\nenough of Rupert's work to make a lot of volumes and we have an ambitious\nliterary project of some day publishing an _edition de luxe_ of his whole\ncollected works.  It will be a rare showing amongst the works of Kings.\nBut this is to be all about himself, so that in the future it may serve\nas a sort of backbone of his personal history.\n\nBy-and-by we came to a part when we had to ask him questions; and he was\nso interested in Teuta's work--he is really bound up body and soul in his\nbeautiful wife, and no wonder--that we had to take him into full\nconfidence.  He promised he would help us all he could by giving us the\nuse of his later journals, and such letters and papers as he had kept\nprivately.  He said he would make one condition--I use his own words: \"As\nyou two dear women are to be my editors, you must promise to put in\neverything exactly as I wrote it.  It will not do to have any fake about\nthis.  I do not wish anything foolish or egotistical toned down out of\naffection for me.  It was all written in sincerity, and if I had faults,\nthey must not be hidden.  If it is to be history, it must be true\nhistory, even if it gives you and me or any of us away.\"\n\nSo we promised.\n\nHe also said that, as Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Bart.--as he is now--was\nsure to have some matter which we should like, he would write and ask him\nto send such to us.  He also said that Mr. Ernest Roger Halbard Melton,\nof Humcroft, Salop (he always gives this name and address in full, which\nis his way of showing contempt), would be sure to have some relevant\nmatter, and that he would have him written to on the subject.  This he\ndid.  The Chancellor wrote him in his most grandiloquent style.   Mr. E.\nR. H. Melton, of H., S., replied by return post.  His letter is a\ndocument which speaks for itself:\n\n                                                          HUMCROFT, SALOP,\n                                                           _May_ 30, 1908.\n\n    MY DEAR COUSIN KING RUPERT,\n\n    I am honoured by the request made on your behalf by the Lord High\n    Chancellor of your kingdom that I should make a literary contribution\n    to the volume which my cousin, Queen Teuta, is, with the help of your\n    former governess, Miss MacKelpie, compiling.  I am willing to do so,\n    as you naturally wish to have in that work some contemporary record\n    made by the Head of the House of Melton, with which you are\n    connected, though only on the distaff side.  It is a natural ambition\n    enough, even on the part of a barbarian--or perhaps\n    semi-barbarian--King, and far be it from me, as Head of the House, to\n    deny you such a coveted privilege.  Perhaps you may not know that I\n    am now Head of the House; my father died three days ago.  I offered\n    my mother the use of the Dower House--to the incumbency of which,\n    indeed, she is entitled by her marriage settlement.  But she\n    preferred to go to live at her seat, Carfax, in Kent.  She went this\n    morning after the funeral.  In letting you have the use of my\n    manuscript I make only one stipulation, but that I expect to be\n    rigidly adhered to.  It is that all that I have written be put in the\n    book _in extenso_.  I do not wish any record of mine to be garbled to\n    suit other ends than those ostensible, or whatever may be to the\n    honour of myself or my House to be burked.  I dare say you have\n    noticed, my dear Rupert, that the compilers of family histories\n    often, through jealousy, alter matter that they are allowed to use so\n    as to suit their own purpose or minister to their own vanity.  I\n    think it right to tell you that I have had a certified copy made by\n    Petter and Galpin, the law stationers, so that I shall be able to\n    verify whether my stipulation has been honourably observed.  I am\n    having the book, which is naturally valuable, carefully packed, and\n    shall have it forwarded to Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Baronet (which\n    he now is--Heaven save the mark!), the Attorney.  Please see that he\n    returns it to me, and in proper order.  He is not to publish for\n    himself anything in it about him.  A man of that class is apt to\n    advertise the fact of anyone of distinction taking any notice of him.\n    I would bring out the MS. to you myself, and stay for a while with\n    you for some sport, only your lot--subjects I suppose you call\n    them!--are such bounders that a gentleman's life is hardly safe\n    amongst them.  I never met anyone who had so poor an appreciation of\n    a joke as they have.  By the way, how is Teuta?  She is one of them.\n    I heard all about the hatching business.  I hope the kid is all\n    right.  This is only a word in your ear, so don't get cocky, old son.\n    I am open to a godfathership.  Think of that, Hedda!  Of course, if\n    the other godfather and the godmother are up to the mark; I don't\n    want to have to boost up the whole lot!  Savvy?  Kiss Teuta and the\n    kid for me.  I must have the boy over here for a bit later on--when\n    he is presentable, and has learned not to be a nuisance.  It will be\n    good for him to see something of a real first-class English country\n    house like Humcroft.  To a person only accustomed to rough ways and\n    meagre living its luxury will make a memory which will serve in time\n    as an example to be aimed at.  I shall write again soon.  Don't\n    hesitate to ask any favour which I may be able to confer on you.  So\n    long!\n\n                                                 Your affectionate cousin,\n                                              ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON.\n\n_Extract from Letter from E. Bingham Trent to Queen Teuta of the Blue\nMountains_.\n\n    . . . So I thought the best way to serve that appalling cad would be\n    to take him at his word, and put in his literary contribution in\n    full.  I have had made and attested a copy of his \"Record,\" as he\n    calls it, so as to save you trouble.  But I send the book itself,\n    because I am afraid that unless you see his words in his own writing,\n    you will not believe that he or anyone else ever penned seriously a\n    document so incriminating.  I am sure he must have forgotten what he\n    had written, for even such a dull dog as he is could never have made\n    public such a thing knowingly. . . Such a nature has its revenges on\n    itself.  In this case the officers of revenge are his _ipsissima\n    verba_.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                       _February_ 1, 1909.\n\nAll is now well in train.  When the Czar of Russia, on being asked by the\nSclavs (as was meet) to be the referee in the \"Balkan Settlement,\"\ndeclined on the ground that he was himself by inference an interested\nparty, it was unanimously agreed by the Balkan rulers that the Western\nKing should be asked to arbitrate, as all concerned had perfect\nconfidence in his wisdom, as well as his justice.  To their wish he\ngraciously assented.  The matter has now been for more than six months in\nhis hands, and he has taken endless trouble to obtain full information.\nHe has now informed us through his Chancellor that his decision is almost\nready, and will be communicated as soon as possible.\n\nWe have another hunting-party at Vissarion next week.  Teuta is looking\nforward to it with extraordinary interest.  She hopes then to present to\nour brothers of the Balkans our little son, and she is eager to know if\nthey endorse her mother-approval of him.\n\n\n\nRUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.\n\n\n                                                         _April_ 15, 1909.\n\nThe arbitrator's decision has been communicated to us through the\nChancellor of the Western King, who brought it to us himself as a special\nact of friendliness.  It met with the enthusiastic approval of all.  The\nPremier remained with us during the progress of the hunting-party, which\nwas one of the most joyous occasions ever known.  We are all of good\nheart, for the future of the Balkan races is now assured.  The\nstrife--internal and external--of a thousand years has ceased, and we\nlook with hope for a long and happy time.  The Chancellor brought\nmessages of grace and courtliness and friendliness to all.  And when I,\nas spokesman of the party, asked him if we might convey a request of His\nMajesty that he would honour us by attending the ceremony of making known\nformally the Balkan Settlement, he answered that the King had authorized\nhim to say that he would, if such were wished by us, gladly come; and\nthat if he should come, he would attend with a fleet as an escort.  The\nChancellor also told me from himself that it might be possible to have\nother nationalities represented on such a great occasion by Ambassadors\nand even fleets, though the monarchs themselves might not be able to\nattend.  He hinted that it might be well if I put the matter in train.\n(He evidently took it for granted that, though I was only one of several,\nthe matter rested with me--possibly he chose me as the one to whom to\nmake the confidence, as I was born a stranger.)  As we talked it over, he\ngrew more enthusiastic, and finally said that, as the King was taking the\nlead, doubtless all the nations of the earth friendly to him would like\nto take a part in the ceremony.  So it is likely to turn out practically\nan international ceremony of a unique kind.  Teuta will love it, and we\nshall all do what we can.\n\n\n\nJANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.\n\n\n                                                           _June_ 1, 1909.\n\nOur dear Teuta is full of the forthcoming celebration of the Balkan\nFederation, which is to take place this day month, although I must say,\nfor myself, that the ceremony is attaining to such dimensions that I am\nbeginning to have a sort of vague fear of some kind.  It almost seems\nuncanny.  Rupert is working unceasingly--has been for some time.  For\nweeks past he seems to have been out day and night on his aeroplane,\ngoing through and round over the country arranging matters, and seeing\nfor himself that what has been arranged is being done.  Uncle Colin is\nalways about, too, and so is Admiral Rooke.  But now Teuta is beginning\nto go with Rupert.  That girl is simply fearless--just like Rupert.  And\nthey both seem anxious that little Rupert shall be the same.  Indeed, he\nis the same.  A few mornings ago Rupert and Teuta were about to start\njust after dawn from the top of the Castle.  Little Rupert was there--he\nis always awake early and as bright as a bee.  I was holding him in my\narms, and when his mother leant over to kiss him good-bye, he held out\nhis arms to her in a way that said as plainly as if he had spoken, \"Take\nme with you.\"\n\nShe looked appealingly at Rupert, who nodded, and said: \"All right.  Take\nhim, darling.  He will have to learn some day, and the sooner the\nbetter.\"  The baby, looking eagerly from one to the other with the same\nquestioning in his eyes as there is sometimes in the eyes of a kitten or\na puppy--but, of course, with an eager soul behind it--saw that he was\ngoing, and almost leaped into his mother's arms.  I think she had\nexpected him to come, for she took a little leather dress from Margareta,\nhis nurse, and, flushing with pride, began to wrap him in it.  When\nTeuta, holding him in her arms, stepped on the aeroplane, and took her\nplace in the centre behind Rupert, the young men of the Crown Prince's\nGuard raised a cheer, amid which Rupert pulled the levers, and they\nglided off into the dawn.\n\nThe Crown Prince's Guard was established by the mountaineers themselves\nthe day of his birth.  Ten of the biggest and most powerful and cleverest\nyoung men of the nation were chosen, and were sworn in with a very\nimpressive ceremony to guard the young Prince.  They were to so arrange\nand order themselves and matters generally that two at least of them\nshould always have him, or the place in which he was, within their sight.\nThey all vowed that the last of their lives should go before harm came to\nhim.  Of course, Teuta understood, and so did Rupert.  And these young\nmen are the persons most privileged in the whole Castle.  They are dear\nboys, every one of them, and we are all fond of them and respect them.\nThey simply idolize the baby.\n\nEver since that morning little Rupert has, unless it is at a time\nappointed for his sleeping, gone in his mother's arms.  I think in any\nother place there would be some State remonstrance at the whole royal\nfamily being at once and together in a dangerous position, but in the\nBlue Mountains danger and fear are not thought of--indeed, they can\nhardly be in their terminology.  And I really think the child enjoys it\neven more than his parents.  He is just like a little bird that has found\nthe use of his wings.  Bless him!\n\nI find that even I have to study Court ritual a little.  So many\nnationalities are to be represented at the ceremony of the \"Balkan\nSettlement,\" and so many Kings and Princes and notabilities of all kinds\nare coming, that we must all take care not to make any mistakes.  The\nPress alone would drive anyone silly.  Rupert and Teuta come and sit with\nme sometimes in the evening when we are all too tired to work, and they\nrest themselves by talking matters over.  Rupert says that there will be\nover five hundred reporters, and that the applications for permission are\ncoming in so fast that there may be a thousand when the day comes.  Last\nnight he stopped in the middle of speaking of it, and said:\n\n\"I have an inspiration!  Fancy a thousand journalists,--each wanting to\nget ahead of the rest, and all willing to invoke the Powers of Evil for\nexclusive information!  The only man to look after this department is\nRooke.  He knows how to deal with men, and as we have already a large\nstaff to look after the journalistic guests, he can be at the head, and\nappoint his own deputies to act for him.  Somewhere and sometime the\nkeeping the peace will be a matter of nerve and resolution, and Rooke is\nthe man for the job.\"\n\nWe were all concerned about one thing, naturally important in the eyes of\na woman: What robes was Teuta to wear?  In the old days, when there were\nKings and Queens, they doubtless wore something gorgeous or impressive;\nbut whatever it was that they wore has gone to dust centuries ago, and\nthere were no illustrated papers in those primitive days.  Teuta was\ntalking to me eagerly, with her dear beautiful brows all wrinkled, when\nRupert who was reading a bulky document of some kind, looked up and said:\n\n\"Of course, darling, you will wear your Shroud?\"\n\n\"Capital!\" she said, clapping her hands like a joyous child.  \"The very\nthing, and our people will like it.\"\n\nI own that for a moment I was dismayed.  It was a horrible test of a\nwoman's love and devotion.  At a time when she was entertaining Kings and\nnotabilities in her own house--and be sure they would all be decked in\ntheir finery--to have to appear in such a garment!  A plain thing with\nnothing even pretty, let alone gorgeous, about it!  I expressed my views\nto Rupert, for I feared that Teuta might be disappointed, though she\nmight not care to say so; but before he could say a word Teuta answered:\n\n\"Oh, thank you so much, dear!  I should love that above everything, but I\ndid not like to suggest it, lest you should think me arrogant or\npresuming; for, indeed, Rupert, I am very proud of it, and of the way our\npeople look on it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Rupert, in his direct way.  \"It is a thing for us all to\nbe proud of; the nation has already adopted it as a national emblem--our\nemblem of courage and devotion and patriotism, which will always, I hope,\nbe treasured beyond price by the men and women of our Dynasty, the\nNation, that is--of the Nation that is to be.\"\n\nLater on in the evening we had a strange endorsement of the national\nwill.  A \"People's Deputation\" of mountaineers, without any official\nnotice or introduction, arrived at the Castle late in the evening in the\nmanner established by Rupert's \"Proclamation of Freedom,\" wherein all\ncitizens were entitled to send a deputation to the King, at will and in\nprivate, on any subject of State importance.  This deputation was\ncomposed of seventeen men, one selected from each political section, so\nthat the body as a whole represented the entire nation.  They were of all\nsorts of social rank and all degrees of fortune, but they were mainly \"of\nthe people.\"  They spoke hesitatingly--possibly because Teuta, or even\nbecause I, was present--but with a manifest earnestness.  They made but\none request--that the Queen should, on the great occasion of the Balkan\nFederation, wear as robes of State the Shroud that they loved to see her\nin.  The spokesman, addressing the Queen, said in tones of rugged\neloquence:\n\n\"This is a matter, Your Majesty, that the women naturally have a say in,\nso we have, of course, consulted them.  They have discussed the matter by\nthemselves, and then with us, and they are agreed without a flaw that it\nwill be good for the Nation and for Womankind that you do this thing.\nYou have shown to them, and to the world at large, what women should do,\nwhat they can do, and they want to make, in memory of your great act, the\nShroud a garment of pride and honour for women who have deserved well of\ntheir country.  In the future it can be a garment to be worn only by\nprivileged women who have earned the right.  But they hope, and we hope\nwith them, that on this occasion of our Nation taking the lead before the\neyes of the world, all our women may wear it on that day as a means of\nshowing overtly their willingness to do their duty, even to the death.\nAnd so\"--here he turned to the King--\"Rupert, we trust that Her Majesty\nQueen Teuta will understand that in doing as the women of the Blue\nMountains wish, she will bind afresh to the Queen the loyal devotion\nwhich she won from them as Voivodin.  Henceforth and for all time the\nShroud shall be a dress of honour in our Land.\"\n\nTeuta looked all ablaze with love and pride and devotion.  Stars in her\neyes shone like white fire as she assured them of the granting of their\nrequest.  She finished her little speech:\n\n\"I feared that if I carried out my own wish, it might look arrogant, but\nRupert has expressed the same wish, and now I feel that I am free to wear\nthat dress which brought me to you and to Rupert\"--here she beamed on\nhim, and took his hand--\"fortified as I am by your wishes and the command\nof my lord the King.\"\n\nRupert took her in his arms and kissed her fondly before them all,\nsaying:\n\n\"Tell your wives, my brothers, and the rest of the Blue Mountain women,\nthat that is the answer of the husband who loves and honours his wife.\nAll the world shall see at the ceremony of the Federation of Balka that\nwe men love and honour the women who are loyal and can die for duty.\nAnd, men of the Blue Mountains, some day before long we shall organize\nthat great idea, and make it a permanent thing--that the Order of the\nShroud is the highest guerdon that a noble-hearted woman can wear.\"\n\nTeuta disappeared for a few moments, and came back with the Crown Prince\nin her arms.  Everyone present asked to be allowed to kiss him, which\nthey did kneeling.\n\n\n\nTHE FEDERATION BALKA.\n\n\n_By the Correspondents of_ \"_Free America_.\"\n\nThe Editors of _Free America_ have thought it well to put in consecutive\norder the reports and descriptions of their Special Correspondents, of\nwhom there were present no less than eight.  Not a word they wrote is\nomitted, but the various parts of their reports are placed in different\norder, so that, whilst nothing which any of them recorded is left out,\nthe reader may be able to follow the proceedings from the various points\nof view of the writers who had the most favourable opportunity of moment.\nIn so large an assemblage of journalists--there were present over a\nthousand--they could not all be present in one place; so our men, in\nconsultation amongst themselves, arranged to scatter, so as to cover the\nwhole proceeding from the various \"coigns of vantage,\" using their skill\nand experience in selecting these points.  One was situated on the summit\nof the steel-clad tower in the entrance to the Blue Mouth; another on the\n\"Press-boat,\" which was moored alongside King Rupert's armoured yacht,\n_The Lady_, whereon were gathered the various Kings and rulers of the\nBalkan States, all of whom were in the Federation; another was in a swift\ntorpedo-boat, with a roving commission to cruise round the harbour as\ndesired; another took his place on the top of the great mountain which\noverlooks Plazac, and so had a bird's-eye view of the whole scene of\noperations; two others were on the forts to right and left of the Blue\nMouth; another was posted at the entrance to the Great Tunnel which runs\nfrom the water level right up through the mountains to the plateau, where\nthe mines and factories are situate; another had the privilege of a place\non an aeroplane, which went everywhere and saw everything.  This\naeroplane was driven by an old Special Correspondent of _Free America_,\nwho had been a chum of our Special in the Japanese and Russian War, and\nwho has taken service on the Blue Mountain _Official Gazette_.\n\n                                                                   PLAZAC,\n                                                          _June_ 30, 1909.\n\nTwo days before the time appointed for the ceremony the guests of the\nLand of the Blue Mountains began to arrive.  The earlier comers were\nmostly the journalists who had come from almost over the whole inhabited\nworld.  King Rupert, who does things well, had made a camp for their\nexclusive use.  There was a separate tent for each--of course, a small\none, as there were over a thousand journalists--but there were big tents\nfor general use scattered about--refectories, reading and writing rooms,\na library, idle rooms for rest, etc.  In the rooms for reading and\nwriting, which were the work-rooms for general use, were newspapers, the\nlatest attainable from all over the world, Blue-Books, guides,\ndirectories, and all such aids to work as forethought could arrange.\nThere was for this special service a body of some hundreds of capable\nservants in special dress and bearing identification numbers--in fact,\nKing Rupert \"did us fine,\" to use a slang phrase of pregnant meaning.\n\nThere were other camps for special service, all of them well arranged,\nand with plenty of facility for transport.  Each of the Federating\nMonarchs had a camp of his own, in which he had erected a magnificent\npavilion.  For the Western King, who had acted as Arbitrator in the\nmatter of the Federation, a veritable palace had been built by King\nRupert--a sort of Aladdin's palace it must have been, for only a few\nweeks ago the place it occupied was, I was told, only primeval\nwilderness.  King Rupert and his Queen, Teuta, had a pavilion like the\nrest of the Federators of Balka, but infinitely more modest, both in size\nand adornments.\n\nEverywhere were guards of the Blue Mountains, armed only with the\n\"handjar,\" which is the national weapon.  They wore the national dress,\nbut so arranged in colour and accoutrement that the general air of\nuniformity took the place of a rigid uniform.  There must have been at\nleast seventy or eighty thousand of them.\n\nThe first day was one of investigation of details by the visitors.\nDuring the second day the retinues of the great Federators came.  Some of\nthese retinues were vast.  For instance, the Soldan (though only just\nbecome a Federator) sent of one kind or another more than a thousand men.\nA brave show they made, for they are fine men, and drilled to perfection.\nAs they swaggered along, singly or in mass, with their gay jackets and\nbaggy trousers, their helmets surmounted by the golden crescent, they\nlooked a foe not to be despised.  Landreck Martin, the Nestor of\njournalists, said to me, as we stood together looking at them:\n\n\"To-day we witness a new departure in Blue Mountain history.  This is the\nfirst occasion for a thousand years that so large a Turkish body has\nentered the Blue Mountains with a reasonable prospect of ever getting out\nagain.\"\n\n                                                           _July_ 1, 1909.\n\nTo-day, the day appointed for the ceremony, was auspiciously fine, even\nfor the Blue Mountains, where at this time of year the weather is nearly\nalways fine.  They are early folk in the Blue Mountains, but to-day\nthings began to hum before daybreak.  There were bugle-calls all over the\nplace--everything here is arranged by calls of musical\ninstruments--trumpets, or bugles, or drums (if, indeed, the drum can be\ncalled a musical instrument)--or by lights, if it be after dark.  We\njournalists were all ready; coffee and bread-and-butter had been\nthoughtfully served early in our sleeping-tents, and an elaborate\nbreakfast was going on all the time in the refectory pavilions.  We had a\npreliminary look round, and then there was a sort of general pause for\nbreakfast.  We took advantage of it, and attacked the sumptuous--indeed,\nmemorable--meal which was served for us.\n\nThe ceremony was to commence at noon, but at ten o'clock the whole place\nwas astir--not merely beginning to move, but actually moving; everybody\ntaking their places for the great ceremony.  As noon drew near, the\nexcitement was intense and prolonged.  One by one the various signatories\nto the Federation began to assemble.  They all came by sea; such of them\nas had sea-boards of their own having their fleets around them.  Such as\nhad no fleets of their own were attended by at least one of the Blue\nMountain ironclads.  And I am bound to say that I never in my life saw\nmore dangerous craft than these little warships of King Rupert of the\nBlue Mountains.  As they entered the Blue Mouth each ship took her\nappointed station, those which carried the signatories being close\ntogether in an isolated group in a little bay almost surrounded by high\ncliffs in the farthest recesses of the mighty harbour.  King Rupert's\narmoured yacht all the time lay close inshore, hard by the mouth of the\nGreat Tunnel which runs straight into the mountain from a wide plateau,\npartly natural rock, partly built up with mighty blocks of stone.  Here\nit is, I am told, that the inland products are brought down to the modern\ntown of Plazac.  Just as the clocks were chiming the half-hour before\nnoon this yacht glided out into the expanse of the \"Mouth.\"  Behind her\ncame twelve great barges, royally decked, and draped each in the colour\nof the signatory nation.  On each of these the ruler entered with his\nguard, and was carried to Rupert's yacht, he going on the bridge, whilst\nhis suite remained on the lower deck.  In the meantime whole fleets had\nbeen appearing on the southern horizon; the nations were sending their\nmaritime quota to the christening of \"Balka\"!  In such wonderful order as\ncan only be seen with squadrons of fighting ships, the mighty throng\nswept into the Blue Mouth, and took up their stations in groups.  The\nonly armament of a Great Power now missing was that of the Western King.\nBut there was time.  Indeed, as the crowd everywhere began to look at\ntheir watches a long line of ships began to spread up northward from the\nItalian coast.  They came at great speed--nearly twenty knots.  It was a\nreally wonderful sight--fifty of the finest ships in the world; the very\nlatest expression of naval giants, each seemingly typical of its\nclass--Dreadnoughts, cruisers, destroyers.  They came in a wedge, with\nthe King's yacht flying the Royal Standard the apex.  Every ship of the\nsquadron bore a red ensign long enough to float from the masthead to the\nwater.  From the armoured tower in the waterway one could see the myriad\nof faces--white stars on both land and sea--for the great harbour was now\nalive with ships and each and all of them alive with men.\n\nSuddenly, without any direct cause, the white masses became\neclipsed--everyone had turned round, and was looking the other way.  I\nlooked across the bay and up the mountain behind--a mighty mountain,\nwhose slopes run up to the very sky, ridge after ridge seeming like\nitself a mountain.  Far away on the very top the standard of the Blue\nMountains was run up on a mighty Flagstaff which seemed like a shaft of\nlight.  It was two hundred feet high, and painted white, and as at the\ndistance the steel stays were invisible, it towered up in lonely\ngrandeur.  At its foot was a dark mass grouped behind a white space,\nwhich I could not make out till I used my field-glasses.\n\nThen I knew it was King Rupert and the Queen in the midst of a group of\nmountaineers.  They were on the aero station behind the platform of the\naero, which seemed to shine--shine, not glitter--as though it were\noverlaid with plates of gold.\n\nAgain the faces looked west.  The Western Squadron was drawing near to\nthe entrance of the Blue Mouth.  On the bridge of the yacht stood the\nWestern King in uniform of an Admiral, and by him his Queen in a dress of\nroyal purple, splendid with gold.  Another glance at the mountain-top\nshowed that it had seemed to become alive.  A whole park of artillery\nseemed to have suddenly sprung to life, round each its crew ready for\naction.  Amongst the group at the foot of the Flagstaff we could\ndistinguish King Rupert; his vast height and bulk stood out from and\nabove all round him.  Close to him was a patch of white, which we\nunderstood to be Queen Teuta, whom the Blue Mountaineers simply adore.\n\nBy this time the armoured yacht, bearing all the signatories to \"Balka\"\n(excepting King Rupert), had moved out towards the entrance, and lay\nstill and silent, waiting the coming of the Royal Arbitrator, whose whole\nsquadron simultaneously slowed down, and hardly drifted in the seething\nwater of their backing engines.\n\nWhen the flag which was in the yacht's prow was almost opposite the\narmoured fort, the Western King held up a roll of vellum handed to him by\none of his officers.  We onlookers held our breath, for in an instant was\nsuch a scene as we can never hope to see again.\n\nAt the raising of the Western King's hand, a gun was fired away on the\ntop of the mountain where rose the mighty Flagstaff with the standard of\nthe Blue Mountains.  Then came the thunder of salute from the guns,\nbright flashes and reports, which echoed down the hillsides in\nnever-ending sequence.  At the first gun, by some trick of signalling,\nthe flag of the Federated \"Balka\" floated out from the top of the\nFlagstaff, which had been mysteriously raised, and flew above that of the\nBlue Mountains.\n\nAt the same moment the figures of Rupert and Teuta sank; they were taking\ntheir places on the aeroplane.  An instant after, like a great golden\nbird, it seemed to shoot out into the air, and then, dipping its head,\ndropped downward at an obtuse angle.  We could see the King and Queen\nfrom time waist upwards--the King in Blue Mountain dress of green; the\nQueen, wrapped in her white Shroud, holding her baby on her breast.  When\nfar out from the mountain-top and over the Blue Mouth, the wings and tail\nof the great bird-like machine went up, and the aero dropped like a\nstone, till it was only some few hundred feet over the water.  Then the\nwings and tail went down, but with diminishing speed.  Below the expanse\nof the plane the King and Queen were now seen seated together on the tiny\nsteering platform, which seemed to have been lowered; she sat behind her\nhusband, after the manner of matrons of the Blue Mountains.  That coming\nof that aeroplane was the most striking episode of all this wonderful\nday.\n\nAfter floating for a few seconds, the engines began to work, whilst the\nplanes moved back to their normal with beautiful simultaneity.  There was\na golden aero finding its safety in gliding movement.  At the same time\nthe steering platform was rising, so that once more the occupants were\nnot far below, but above the plane.  They were now only about a hundred\nfeet above the water, moving from the far end of the Blue Mouth towards\nthe entrance in the open space between the two lines of the fighting\nships of the various nationalities, all of which had by now their yards\nmanned--a manoeuvre which had begun at the firing of the first gun on the\nmountain-top.  As the aero passed along, all the seamen began to cheer--a\ncheering which they kept up till the King and Queen had come so close to\nthe Western King's vessel that the two Kings and Queens could greet each\nother.  The wind was now beginning to blow westward from the\nmountain-top, and it took the sounds towards the armoured fort, so that\nat moments we could distinguish the cheers of the various nationalities,\namongst which, more keen than the others, came the soft \"Ban Zai!\" of the\nJapanese.\n\nKing Rupert, holding his steering levers, sat like a man of marble.\nBehind him his beautiful wife, clad in her Shroud, and holding in her\narms the young Crown Prince, seemed like a veritable statue.\n\nThe aero, guided by Rupert's unerring hand, lit softly on the after-deck\nof the Western King's yacht; and King Rupert, stepping on deck, lifted\nfrom her seat Queen Teuta with her baby in her arms.  It was only when\nthe Blue Mountain King stood amongst other men that one could realize his\nenormous stature.  He stood literally head and shoulders over every other\nman present.\n\nWhilst the aeroplane was giving up its burden, the Western King and his\nQueen were descending from the bridge.  The host and hostess, hand in\nhand--after their usual fashion, as it seems--hurried forward to greet\ntheir guests.  The meeting was touching in its simplicity.  The two\nmonarchs shook hands, and their consorts, representatives of the foremost\ntypes of national beauty of the North and South, instinctively drew close\nand kissed each other.  Then the hostess Queen, moving towards the\nWestern King, kneeled before him with the gracious obeisance of a Blue\nMountain hostess, and kissed his hand.\n\nHer words of greeting were:\n\n\"You are welcome, sire, to the Blue Mountains.  We are grateful to you\nfor all you have done for Balka, and to you and Her Majesty for giving us\nthe honour of your presence.\"\n\nThe King seemed moved.  Accustomed as he was to the ritual of great\noccasions, the warmth and sincerity, together with the gracious humility\nof this old Eastern custom, touched him, monarch though he was of a great\nland and many races in the Far East.  Impulsively he broke through Court\nritual, and did a thing which, I have since been told, won for him for\never a holy place in the warm hearts of the Blue Mountaineers.  Sinking\non his knee before the beautiful shroud-clad Queen, he raised her hand\nand kissed it.  The act was seen by all in and around the Blue Mouth, and\na mighty cheering rose, which seemed to rise and swell as it ran far and\nwide up the hillsides, till it faded away on the far-off mountain-top,\nwhere rose majestically the mighty Flagstaff bearing the standard of the\nBalkan Federation.\n\nFor myself, I can never forget that wonderful scene of a nation's\nenthusiasm, and the core of it is engraven on my memory.  That spotless\ndeck, typical of all that is perfect in naval use; the King and Queen of\nthe greatest nation of the earth {3} received by the newest King and\nQueen--a King and Queen who won empire for themselves, so that the former\nsubject of another King received him as a brother-monarch on a\nhistory-making occasion, when a new world-power was, under his tutelage,\nspringing into existence.  The fair Northern Queen in the arms of the\ndark Southern Queen with the starry eyes.  The simple splendour of\nNorthern dress arrayed against that of almost peasant plainness of the\ngiant King of the South.  But all were eclipsed--even the thousand years\nof royal lineage of the Western King, Rupert's natural dower of stature,\nand the other Queen's bearing of royal dignity and sweetness--by the\nelemental simplicity of Teuta's Shroud.  Not one of all that mighty\nthrong but knew something of her wonderful story; and not one but felt\nglad and proud that such a noble woman had won an empire through her own\nbravery, even in the jaws of the grave.\n\nThe armoured yacht, with the remainder of the signatories to the Balkan\nFederation, drew close, and the rulers stepped on board to greet the\nWestern King, the Arbitrator, Rupert leaving his task as personal host\nand joining them.  He took his part modestly in the rear of the group,\nand made a fresh obeisance in his new capacity.\n\nPresently another warship, _The Balka_, drew close.  It contained the\nambassadors of Foreign Powers, and the Chancellors and high officials of\nthe Balkan nations.  It was followed by a fleet of warships, each one\nrepresenting a Balkan Power.  The great Western fleet lay at their\nmoorings, but with the exception of manning their yards, took no\nimmediate part in the proceedings.\n\nOn the deck of the new-comer the Balkan monarchs took their places, the\nofficials of each State grading themselves behind their monarch.  The\nAmbassadors formed a foremost group by themselves.\n\nLast came the Western King, quite alone (save for the two Queens),\nbearing in his hand the vellum scroll, the record of his arbitration.\nThis he proceeded to read, a polyglot copy of it having been already\nsupplied to every Monarch, Ambassador, and official present.  It was a\nlong statement, but the occasion was so stupendous--so intense--that the\ntime flew by quickly.  The cheering had ceased the moment the Arbitrator\nopened the scroll, and a veritable silence of the grave abounded.\n\nWhen the reading was concluded Rupert raised his hand, and on the instant\ncame a terrific salvo of cannon-shots from not only the ships in the\nport, but seemingly all up and over the hillsides away to the very\nsummit.\n\nWhen the cheering which followed the salute had somewhat toned down,\nthose on board talked together, and presentations were made.  Then the\nbarges took the whole company to the armour-clad fort in the entrance-way\nto the Blue Mouth.  Here, in front, had been arranged for the occasion,\nplatforms for the starting of aeroplanes.  Behind them were the various\nthrones of state for the Western King and Queen, and the various rulers\nof \"Balka\"--as the new and completed Balkan Federation had become--_de\njure_ as well as _de facto_.  Behind were seats for the rest of the\ncompany.  All was a blaze of crimson and gold.  We of the Press were all\nexpectant, for some ceremony had manifestly been arranged, but of all\ndetails of it we had been kept in ignorance.  So far as I could tell from\nthe faces, those present were at best but partially informed.  They were\ncertainly ignorant of all details, and even of the entire programme of\nthe day.  There is a certain kind of expectation which is not concerned\nin the mere execution of fore-ordered things.\n\nThe aero on which the King and Queen had come down from the mountain now\narrived on the platform in the charge of a tall young mountaineer, who\nstepped from the steering-platform at once.  King Rupert, having handed\nhis Queen (who still carried her baby) into her seat, took his place, and\npulled a lever.  The aero went forward, and seemed to fall head foremost\noff the fort.  It was but a dip, however, such as a skilful diver takes\nfrom a height into shallow water, for the plane made an upward curve, and\nin a few seconds was skimming upwards towards the Flagstaff.  Despite the\nwind, it arrived there in an incredibly short time.  Immediately after\nhis flight another aero, a big one this time, glided to the platform.  To\nthis immediately stepped a body of ten tall, fine-looking young men.  The\ndriver pulled his levers, and the plane glided out on the track of the\nKing.  The Western King, who was noticing, said to the Lord High Admiral,\nwho had been himself in command of the ship of war, and now stood close\nbehind him:\n\n\"Who are those men, Admiral?\"\n\n\"The Guard of the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.  They are appointed by the\nNation.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Admiral, have they any special duties?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" came the answer: \"to die, if need be, for the young\nPrince!\"\n\n\"Quite right!  That is fine service.  But how if any of them should die?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, if one of them should die, there are ten thousand eager to\ntake his place.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine!  It is good to have even one man eager to give his life for\nduty.  But ten thousand!  That is what makes a nation!\"\n\nWhen King Rupert reached the platform by the Flagstaff, the Royal\nStandard of the Blue Mountains was hauled up under it.  Rupert stood up\nand raised his hand.  In a second a cannon beside him was fired; then,\nquick as thought, others were fired in sequence, as though by one\nprolonged lightning-flash.  The roar was incessant, but getting less in\ndetonating sound as the distance and the hills subdued it.  But in the\ngeneral silence which prevailed round us we could hear the sound as\nthough passing in a distant circle, till finally the line which had gone\nnorthward came back by the south, stopping at the last gun to south'ard\nof the Flagstaff.\n\n\"What was that wonderful circle?\" asked the King of the Lord High\nAdmiral.\n\n\"That, Your Majesty, is the line of the frontier of the Blue Mountains.\nRupert has ten thousand cannon in line.\"\n\n\"And who fires them?  I thought all the army must be here.\"\n\n\"The women, Your Majesty.  They are on frontier duty to-day, so that the\nmen can come here.\"\n\nJust at that moment one of the Crown Prince's Guards brought to the side\nof the King's aero something like a rubber ball on the end of a string.\nThe Queen held it out to the baby in her arms, who grabbed at it.  The\nguard drew back.  Pressing that ball must have given some signal, for on\nthe instant a cannon, elevated to perpendicular, was fired.  A shell went\nstraight up an enormous distance.  The shell burst, and sent out both a\nlight so bright that it could be seen in the daylight, and a red smoke,\nwhich might have been seen from the heights of the Calabrian Mountains\nover in Italy.\n\nAs the shell burst, the King's aero seemed once more to spring from the\nplatform out into mid-air, dipped as before, and glided out over the Blue\nMouth with a rapidity which, to look at, took one's breath away.\n\nAs it came, followed by the aero of the Crown Prince's Guard and a group\nof other aeros, the whole mountain-sides seemed to become alive.  From\neverywhere, right away up to the farthest visible mountain-tops, darted\naeroplanes, till a host of them were rushing with dreadful speed in the\nwake of the King.  The King turned to Queen Teuta, and evidently said\nsomething, for she beckoned to the Captain of the Crown Prince's Guard,\nwho was steering the plane.  He swerved away to the right, and instead of\nfollowing above the open track between the lines of warships, went high\nover the outer line.  One of those on board began to drop something,\nwhich, fluttering down, landed on every occasion on the bridge of the\nship high over which they then were.\n\nThe Western King said again to the Gospodar Rooke (the Lord High\nAdmiral):\n\n\"It must need some skill to drop a letter with such accuracy.\"\n\nWith imperturbable face the Admiral replied:\n\n\"It is easier to drop bombs, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe flight of aeroplanes was a memorable sight.  It helped to make\nhistory.  Henceforth no nation with an eye for either defence or attack\ncan hope for success without the mastery of the air.\n\nIn the meantime--and after that time, too--God help the nation that\nattacks \"Balka\" or any part of it, so long as Rupert and Teuta live in\nthe hearts of that people, and bind them into an irresistible unity.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n{1}  Vladika, a high functionary in the Land of the Blue Mountains.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":319,"split":"train"}
