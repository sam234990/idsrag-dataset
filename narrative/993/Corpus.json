Thus Scargate Hall, when first described to the reader, is the property two sisters, Philippa Yordas and Eliza Carnaby. Mr. Jellicorse, the family lawyer, comes by chance upon evidence of a fatal flaw in the sisters' title to the estate, and rides over to make them acquainted with this unpleasant fact.\nIn the sixth chapter of the book we are introduced to Anerley Farm, a place about a hundred and twenty miles from Scargate Hall, and the home of Mary Anerley. As Mary rides down the hollow of the Dyke on the same morning on which Mr. Jellicorse leaves Scargate Hall, she falls in with a man who is running for his life from other men who are pursuing him and shooting at him. Acting on the impulse of a moment, she shows him a place where he can hide. This man is Robin Lyth, who as a child was found washed ashore in a little cove north of Flamborough Head, and raised by foster parents. He is on the run from Captain Carroway, a coastguard officer. Love blossoms between Mary and Robin Lyth, but many obstacles interfere with true love's course.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Mary Anerley, by R. D.

The crossing is\ncalled the \"Seven Corpse Ford,\" because a large party of farmers, riding\nhomeward from Middleton, banded together and perhaps well primed through\nfear of a famous highwayman, came down to this place on a foggy evening,\nafter heavy rain-fall. One of the company set before them what the power\nof the water was, but they laughed at him and spurred into it, and one\nalone spurred out of it. Whether taken with fright, or with too much\ncourage, they laid hold of one another, and seven out of eight of them,\nall large farmers, and thoroughly understanding land, came never upon it\nalive again; and their bodies, being found upon the ridge that cast them\nup, gave a dismal name to a place that never was merry in the best of\nweather.\n\nHowever, worse things than this had happened; and the country is not\nchary of its living, though apt to be scared of its dead; and so the\nford came into use again, with a little attempt at improvement. For\nthose farmers being beyond recall, and their families hard to\nprovide for, Richard Yordas, of Scargate Hall, the chief owner of the\nneighborhood, set a long heavy stone up on either brink, and stretched\na strong chain between them, not only to mark out the course of the\nshallow, whose shelf is askew to the channel, but also that any one\nbeing washed away might fetch up, and feel how to save himself. For the\nTees is a violent water sometimes, and the safest way to cross it is to\ngo on till you come to a good stone bridge.\n\nNow forty years after that sad destruction of brave but not well-guided\nmen, and thirty years after the chain was fixed, that their sons might\nnot go after them, another thing happened at \"Seven Corpse Ford,\" worse\nthan the drowning of the farmers. Or, at any rate, it made more stir\n(which is of wider spread than sorrow), because of the eminence of the\nman, and the length and width of his property. Neither could any one at\nfirst believe in so quiet an end to so turbulent a course. Nevertheless\nit came to pass, as lightly as if he were a reed or a bubble of the\nriver that belonged to him.\n\nIt was upon a gentle evening, a few days after Michaelmas of 1777. No\nflood was in the river then, and no fog on the moor-land, only the usual\ncourse of time, keeping the silent company of stars. The young moon was\ndown, and the hover of the sky (in doubt of various lights) was gone,\nand the equal spread of obscurity soothed the eyes of any reasonable\nman.\n\nBut the man who rode down to the river that night had little love of\nreason. Headstrong chief of a headlong race, no will must depart a\nhair's-breadth from his; and fifty years of arrogant port had stiffened\na neck too stiff at birth. Even now in the dim light his large square\nform stood out against the sky like a cromlech, and his heavy arms swung\nlike gnarled boughs of oak, for a storm of wrath was moving him. In\nhis youth he had rebelled against his father; and now his own son was a\nrebel to him.\n\n\"Good, my boy, good!\" he said, within his grizzled beard, while his eyes\nshone with fire, like the flints beneath his horse; \"you have had your\nown way, have you, then? But never shall you step upon an acre of\nyour own, and your timber shall be the gallows. Done, my boy, once and\nforever.\"\n\nPhilip, the squire, the son of Richard, and father of Duncan Yordas,\nwith fierce satisfaction struck the bosom of his heavy Bradford\nriding-coat, and the crackle of parchment replied to the blow, while\nwith the other hand he drew rein on the brink of the Tees sliding\nrapidly.\n\nThe water was dark with the twinkle of the stars, and wide with the\nvapor of the valley, but Philip Yordas in the rage of triumph laughed\nand spurred his reflecting horse.\n\n\"Fool!\" he cried, without an oath--no Yordas ever used an oath except in\nplayful moments--\"fool! what fear you? There hangs my respected father's\nchain. Ah, he was something like a man! Had I ever dared to flout him\nso, he would have hanged me with it.\"\n\nWild with his wrong, he struck the rowel deep into the flank of his\nwading horse, and in scorn of the depth drove him up the river. The\nshoulders of the swimming horse broke the swirling water, as he panted\nand snorted against it; and if Philip Yordas had drawn back at once, he\nmight even now have crossed safely. But the fury of his blood was up,\nthe stronger the torrent the fiercer his will, and the fight between\npassion and power went on. The poor horse was fain to swerve back at\nlast; but he struck him on the head with a carbine, and shouted to the\ntorrent:\n\n\"Drown me, if you can. My father used to say that I was never born\nto drown. My own water drown me! That would be a little too much\ninsolence.\"\n\n\"Too much insolence\" were his last words. The strength of the horse was\nexhausted. The beat of his legs grew short and faint, the white of his\neyes rolled piteously, and the gurgle of his breath subsided. His\nheavy head dropped under water, and his sodden crest rolled over, like\nsea-weed where a wave breaks. The stream had him all at its mercy, and\nshowed no more than his savage master had, but swept him a wallowing\nlump away, and over the reef of the crossing. With both feet locked in\nthe twisted stirrups, and right arm broken at the elbow, the rider\nwas swung (like the mast of a wreck) and flung with his head upon his\nfather's chain. There he was held by his great square chin--for the\njar of his backbone stunned him--and the weight of the swept-away horse\nbroke the neck which never had been known to bend. In the morning a\npeasant found him there, not drowned but hanged, with eyes wide open, a\nswaying corpse upon a creaking chain. So his father (though long in the\ngrave) was his death, as he often had promised to be to him; while he\n(with the habit of his race) clutched fast with dead hand on dead bosom\nthe instrument securing the starvation of his son.\n\nOf the Yordas family truly was it said that the will of God was nothing\nto their will--as long as the latter lasted--and that every man of them\nscorned all Testament, old or new, except his own.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nSCARGATE HALL\n\n\nNearly twenty-four years had passed since Philip Yordas was carried to\nhis last (as well as his first) repose, and Scargate Hall had enjoyed\nsome rest from the turbulence of owners. For as soon as Duncan (Philip's\nson, whose marriage had maddened his father) was clearly apprised by the\nlate squire's lawyer of his disinheritance, he collected his own little\nmoney and his wife's, and set sail for India. His mother, a Scotchwoman\nof good birth but evil fortunes, had left him something; and his\nbride (the daughter of his father's greatest foe) was not altogether\nempty-handed. His sisters were forbidden by the will to help him with\na single penny; and Philippa, the elder, declaring and believing that\nDuncan had killed her father, strictly obeyed the injunction. But Eliza,\nbeing of a softer kind, and herself then in love with Captain Carnaby,\nwould gladly have aided her only brother, but for his stern refusal. In\nsuch a case, a more gentle nature than ever endowed a Yordas might\nhave grown hardened and bitter; and Duncan, being of true Yordas fibre\n(thickened and toughened with slower Scotch sap), was not of the sort to\nbe ousted lightly and grow at the feet of his supplanters.\n\nTherefore he cast himself on the winds, in search of fairer soil, and\nwas not heard of in his native land; and Scargate Hall and estates were\nheld by the sisters in joint tenancy, with remainder to the first son\nborn of whichever it might be of them. And this was so worded through\nthe hurry of their father to get some one established in the place of\nhis own son.\n\nBut from paltry passions, turn away a little while to the things which\nexcite, but are not excited by them.\n\nScargate Hall stands, high and old, in the wildest and most rugged part\nof the wild and rough North Riding. Many are the tales about it, in the\nfew and humble cots, scattered in the modest distance, mainly to look up\nat it. In spring and summer, of the years that have any, the height and\nthe air are not only fine, but even fair and pleasant. So do the shadows\nand the sunshine wander, elbowing into one another on the moor, and\nso does the glance of smiling foliage soothe the austerity of crag and\nscaur. At such time, also, the restless torrent (whose fury has driven\ncontent away through many a short day and long night) is not in such\ndesperate hurry to bury its troubles in the breast of Tees, but spreads\nthem in language that sparkles to the sun, or even makes leisure to\nturn into corners of deep brown-study about the people on its\nbanks--especially, perhaps, the miller.\n\nBut never had this impetuous water more reason to stop and reflect upon\npeople of greater importance, who called it their own, than now when it\nwas at the lowest of itself, in August of the year 1801.\n\nFrom time beyond date the race of Yordas had owned and inhabited this\nold place. From them the river, and the river's valley, and the mountain\nof its birth, took name, or else, perhaps, gave name to them; for\nthe history of the giant Yordas still remains to be written, and the\nmaterials are scanty. His present descendants did not care an old song\nfor his memory, even if he ever had existence to produce it. Piety\n(whether in the Latin sense or English) never had marked them for her\nown; their days were long in the land, through a long inactivity of the\nDecalogue.\n\nAnd yet in some manner this lawless race had been as a law to itself\nthroughout. From age to age came certain gifts and certain ways of\nmanagement, which saved the family life from falling out of rank\nand land and lot. From deadly feuds, exhausting suits, and ruinous\nprofusion, when all appeared lost, there had always arisen a man of\ndirect lineal stock to retrieve the estates and reprieve the name. And\nwhat is still more conducive to the longevity of families, no member\nhad appeared as yet of a power too large and an aim too lofty, whose\neminence must be cut short with axe, outlawry, and attainder. Therefore\nthere ever had been a Yordas, good or bad (and by his own showing more\noften of the latter kind), to stand before heaven, and hold the land,\nand harass them that dwelt thereon. But now at last the world seemed to\nbe threatened with the extinction of a fine old name.\n\nWhen Squire Philip died in the river, as above recorded, his death, from\none point of view, was dry, since nobody shed a tear for him, unless it\nwas his child Eliza. Still, he was missed and lamented in speech, and\neven in eloquent speeches, having been a very strong Justice of the\nPeace, as well as the foremost of riotous gentlemen keeping the order of\nthe county. He stood above them in his firm resolve to have his own way\nalways, and his way was so crooked that the difficulty was to get out of\nit and let him have it. And when he was dead, it was either too good\nor too bad to believe in; and even after he was buried it was held that\nthis might be only another of his tricks.\n\nBut after his ghost had been seen repeatedly, sitting on the chain and\nswearing, it began to be known that he was gone indeed, and the relief\nafforded by his absence endeared him to sad memory. Moreover, his\ngood successors enhanced the relish of scandal about him by seeming\nthemselves to be always so dry, distant, and unimpeachable. Especially\nso did \"My Lady Philippa,\" as the elder daughter was called by all the\ntenants and dependents, though the family now held no title of honor.\n\nMistress Yordas, as she was more correctly styled by usage of the\nperiod, was a maiden lady of fine presence, uncumbered as yet by\nweight of years, and only dignified thereby. Stately, and straight, and\nsubstantial of figure, firm but not coarse of feature, she had reached\nher forty-fifth year without an ailment or a wrinkle. Her eyes were\nsteadfast, clear, and bright, well able to second her distinct calm\nvoice, and handsome still, though their deep blue had waned into a\nquiet, impenetrable gray; while her broad clear forehead, straight nose,\nand red lips might well be considered as comely as ever, at least by\nthose who loved her. Of these, however, there were not many; and she was\ncontent to have it so.\n\nMrs. Carnaby, the younger sister, would not have been content to have\nit so. Though not of the weak lot which is enfeoffed to popularity, she\nliked to be regarded kindly, and would rather win a smile than exact a\ncourtesy. Continually it was said of her that she was no genuine Yordas,\nthough really she had all the pride and all the stubbornness of that\nrace, enlarged, perhaps, but little weakened, by severe afflictions.\nThis lady had lost a beloved husband, Colonel Carnaby, killed in battle;\nand after that four children of the five she had been so proud of. And\nthe waters of affliction had not turned to bitterness in her soul.\n\nConcerning the outward part--which matters more than the inward at first\nhand--Mrs. Carnaby had no reason to complain of fortune. She had started\nwell as a very fine baby, and grown up well into a lovely maiden,\npassing through wedlock into a sightly matron, gentle, fair, and showing\nreason. For generations it had come to pass that those of the Yordas\nrace who deserved to be cut off for their doings out-of-doors were\nfollowed by ladies of decorum, self-restraint, and regard for their\nneighbor's landmark. And so it was now with these two ladies, the\nhandsome Philippa and the fair Eliza leading a peaceful and reputable\nlife, and carefully studying their rent-roll.\n\nIt was not, however, in the fitness of things that quiet should reign\nat Scargate Hall for a quarter of a century; and one strong element of\ndisturbance grew already manifest. Under the will of Squire Philip the\nheir-apparent was the one surviving child of Mrs. Carnaby.\n\nIf ever a mortal life was saved by dint of sleepless care, warm\ncoddling, and perpetual doctoring, it was the precious life of Master\nLancelot Yordas Carnaby. In him all the mischief of his race revived,\nwithout the strong substance to carry it off. Though his parents were\nhealthy and vigorous, he was of weakly constitution, which would not\nhave been half so dangerous to him if his mind also had been weakly.\nBut his mind (or at any rate that rudiment thereof which appears in the\nshape of self-will even before the teeth appear) was a piece of muscular\ncontortion, tough as oak and hard as iron. \"Pet\" was his name with his\nmother and his aunt; and his enemies (being the rest of mankind) said\nthat pet was his name and his nature.\n\nFor this dear child could brook no denial, no slow submission to his\nwishes; whatever he wanted must come in a moment, punctual as an\necho. In him re-appeared not the stubbornness only, but also the keen\ningenuity of Yordas in finding out the very thing that never should be\ndone, and then the unerring perception of the way in which it could be\ndone most noxiously. Yet any one looking at his eyes would think how\ntender and bright must his nature be! \"He favoreth his forebears; how\ncan he help it?\" kind people exclaimed, when they knew him. And the\nservants of the house excused themselves when condemned for putting up\nwith him, \"Yo know not what 'a is, yo that talk so. He maun get 's own\ngait, lestwise yo wud chok' un.\"\n\nBeing too valuable to be choked, he got his own way always.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA DISAPPOINTING APPOINTMENT\n\n\nFor the sake of Pet Carnaby and of themselves, the ladies of the house\nwere disquieted now, in the first summer weather of a wet cold year, the\nyear of our Lord 1801. And their trouble arose as follows:\n\nThere had long been a question between the sisters and Sir Walter\nCarnaby, brother of the late colonel, about an exchange of outlying\nland, which would have to be ratified by \"Pet\" hereafter. Terms\nbeing settled and agreement signed, the lawyers fell to at the linked\nsweetness of deducing title. The abstract of the Yordas title was nearly\nas big as the parish Bible, so in and out had their dealings been, and\nso intricate their pugnacity.\n\nAmong the many other of the Yordas freaks was a fatuous and generally\nfatal one. For the slightest miscarriage they discharged their lawyer,\nand leaped into the office of a new one. Has any man moved in the\naffairs of men, with a grain of common-sense or half a pennyweight of\nexperience, without being taught that an old tenter-hook sits easier to\nhim than a new one? And not only that, but in shifting his quarters he\nmay leave some truly fundamental thing behind.\n\nOld Mr. Jellicorse, of Middleton in Teesdale, had won golden opinions\nevery where. He was an uncommonly honest lawyer, highly incapable of\nalmost any trick, and lofty in his view of things, when his side of them\nwas the legal one. He had a large collection of those interesting boxes\nwhich are to a lawyer and his family better than caskets of silver\nand gold; and especially were his shelves furnished with what might be\ncalled the library of the Scargate title-deeds. He had been proud to\ntake charge of these nearly thirty years ago, and had married on the\nstrength of them, though warned by the rival from whom they were wrested\nthat he must not hope to keep them long. However, through the peaceful\nincumbency of ladies, they remained in his office all those years.\n\nThis was the gentleman who had drawn and legally sped to its purport the\nwill of the lamented Squire Philip, who refused very clearly to leave\nit, and took horse to flourish it at his rebellious son. Mr. Jellicorse\nhad done the utmost, as behooved him, against that rancorous testament;\nbut meeting with silence more savage than words, and a bow to depart,\nhe had yielded; and the squire stamped about the room until his job was\nfinished.\n\nA fact accomplished, whether good or bad, improves in character with\nevery revolution of this little world around the sun, that heavenly\nexample of subservience. And now Mr. Jellicorse was well convinced, as\nnothing had occurred to disturb that will, and the life of the testator\nhad been sacrificed to it, and the devisees under it were his own good\nclients, and some of his finest turns of words were in it, and the\npreparation, execution, and attestation, in an hour and ten minutes\nof the office clock, had never been equalled in Yorkshire before, and\nperhaps never honestly in London--taking all these things into conscious\nor unconscious balance, Mr. Jellicorse grew into the clear conviction\nthat \"righteous and wise\" were the words to be used whenever this will\nwas spoken of.\n\nWith pleasant remembrance of the starveling fees wherewith he used to\ncharge the public, ere ever his golden spurs were won, the prosperous\nlawyer now began to run his eye through a duplicate of an abstract\nfurnished upon some little sale about forty years before. This would\nform the basis of the abstract now to be furnished to Sir Walter\nCarnaby, with little to be added but the will of Philip Yordas, and\nstatement of facts to be verified. Mr. Jellicorse was fat, but very\nactive still; he liked good living, but he liked to earn it, and could\nnot sit down to his dinner without feeling that he had helped the Lord\nto provide these mercies. He carried a pencil on his chain, and liked to\nuse it ere ever he began with knife and fork. For the young men in the\noffice, as he always said, knew nothing.\n\nThe day was very bright and clear, and the sun shone through soft\nlilac leaves on more important folios, while Mr. Jellicorse, with happy\nsniffs--for his dinner was roasting in the distance--drew a single line\nhere, or a double line there, or a gable on the margin of the paper, to\nshow his head clerk what to cite, and in what letters, and what to omit,\nin the abstract to be rendered. For the good solicitor had spent some\ntime in the chambers of a famous conveyancer in London, and prided\nhimself upon deducing title, directly, exhaustively, and yet tersely, in\none word, scientifically, and not as the mere quill-driver. The title\nto the hereditaments, now to be given in exchange, went back for many\ngenerations; but as the deeds were not to pass, Mr. Jellicorse, like an\nhonest man, drew a line across, and made a star at one quite old enough\nto begin with, in which the little moorland farm in treaty now was\nspecified. With hum and ha of satisfaction he came down the records,\nas far as the settlement made upon the marriage of Richard Yordas, of\nScargate Hall, Esquire, and Eleanor, the daughter of Sir Fursan de Roos.\nThis document created no entail, for strict settlements had never been\nthe manner of the race; but the property assured in trust, to satisfy\nthe jointure, was then declared subject to joint and surviving powers of\nappointment limited to the issue of the marriage, with remainder to the\nuses of the will of the aforesaid Richard Yordas, or, failing such will,\nto his right heirs forever.\n\nAll this was usual enough, and Mr. Jellicorse heeded it little,\nhaving never heard of any appointment, and knowing that Richard, the\ngrandfather of his clients, had died, as became a true Yordas, in a\nfit of fury with a poor tenant, intestate, as well as unrepentant.\nThe lawyer, being a slightly pious man, afforded a little sigh to this\nremembrance, and lifted his finger to turn the leaf, but the leaf stuck\na moment, and the paper being raised at the very best angle to the\nsun, he saw, or seemed to see, a faint red line, just over against that\nappointment clause. And then the yellow margin showed some faint red\nmarks.\n\n\"Well, I never,\" Mr. Jellicorse exclaimed--\"certainly never saw these\nmarks before. Diana, where are my glasses?\"\n\nMrs. Jellicorse had been to see the potatoes on (for the new cook simply\nmade \"kettlefuls of fish\" of every thing put upon the fire), and now at\nher husband's call she went to her work-box for his spectacles, which\nhe was not allowed to wear except on Sundays, for fear of injuring his\neyesight. Equipped with these, and drawing nearer to the window, the\nlawyer gradually made out this: first a broad faint line of red, as if\nsome attorney, now a ghost, had cut his finger, and over against that in\nsmall round hand the letters \"v. b. c.\" Mr. Jellicorse could swear that\nthey were \"v. b. c.\"\n\n\"Don't ask me to eat any dinner to-day,\" he exclaimed, when his wife\ncame to fetch him. \"Diana, I am occupied; go and eat it up without me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, James,\" she answered, calmly; \"you never get any clever\nthoughts by starving.\"\n\nMoved by this reasoning, he submitted, fed his wife and children and\nown good self, and then brought up a bottle of old Spanish wine to\nstrengthen the founts of discovery. Whose writing was that upon the\nbroad marge of verbosity? Why had it never been observed before? Above\nall, what was meant by \"v. b. c.\"?\n\nUnaided, he might have gone on forever, to the bottom of a butt of Xeres\nwine; but finding the second glass better than the first, he called to\nMrs. Jellicorse, who was in the garden gathering striped roses, to come\nand have a sip with him, and taste the yellow cherries. And when she\ncame promptly, with the flowers in her hand, and their youngest little\ndaughter making sly eyes at the fruit, bothered as he was, he could not\nhelp smiling and saying, \"Oh, Diana, what is 'v. b. c.'?\"\n\n\"Very black currants, papa!\" cried Emily, dancing a long bunch in the\nair.\n\n\"Hush, dear child, you are getting too forward,\" said her mother, though\nproud of her quickness. \"James, how should I know what 'v. b. c.' is?\nBut I wish most heartily that you would rid me of my old enemy, box C.\nI want to put a hanging press in that corner, instead of which you turn\nthe very passages into office.\"\n\n\"Box C? I remember no box C.\"\n\n\"You may not have noticed the letter C upon it, but the box you must\nknow as well as I do. It belongs to those proud Yordas people, who hold\ntheir heads so high, forsooth, as if nobody but themselves belonged to a\ngood old county family! That makes me hate the box the more.\"\n\n\"I will take it out of your way at once. I may want it. It should\nbe with the others. I know it as well as I know my snuff-box. It was\nAberthaw who put it in that corner; but I had forgotten that it was\nlettered. The others are all numbered.\"\n\nOf course Mr. Jellicorse was not weak enough to make the partner of his\nbosom the partner of his business; and much as she longed to know why\nhe had put an unusual question to her, she trusted to the future for\ndiscovery of that point. She left him, and he with no undue haste--for\nthe business, after all, was not his own--began to follow out his train\nof thought, in manner much as follows:\n\n\"This is that old Duncombe's writing--'Dunder-headed Duncombe,' as he\nused to be called in his lifetime, but 'Long-headed Duncombe' afterward.\nNone but his wife knew whether he was a wise man, or a wiseacre. Perhaps\neither, according to the treatment he received. Richard Yordas treated\nhim badly; that may have made him wiser. V. b. c. means 'vide box C,'\nunless I am greatly mistaken. He wrote those letters as plainly and\nclearly as he could against this power of appointment as recited here.\nBut afterward, with knife and pounce, he scraped them out, as now\nbecomes plain with this magnifying-glass; probably he did so when all\nthese archives, as he used to call them, were rudely ordered over to my\npredecessor. A nice bit of revenge, if my suspicions are correct; and a\npretty confusion will follow it.\"\n\nThe lawyer's suspicions proved too correct. He took that box to his\nprivate room, and with some trouble unlocked it. A damp and musty smell\ncame forth, as when a man delves a potato-bury; and then appeared layers\nof parchment yellow and brown, in and out with one another, according to\nthe curing of the sheep-skin, perhaps, or the age of the sheep when\nhe began to die; skins much older than any man's who handled them, and\ndrier than the brains of any lawyer.\n\n\"Anno Jacobi tertio, and Quadragesimo Elisabethae! How nice it sounds!\"\nMr. Jellicorse exclaimed; \"they ought all to go in, and be charged for.\nPeople to be satisfied with sixty years' title! Why, bless the Lord,\nI am sixty-eight myself, and could buy and sell the grammar school at\neight years old. It is no security, no security at all. What did the\nlearned Bacupiston say--'If a rogue only lives to be a hundred and\neleven, he may have been for ninety years disseized, and nobody alive to\nknow it!'\"\n\nOlder and older grew the documents as the lawyer's hand travelled\ndownward; any flaw or failure must have been healed by lapse of time\nlong and long ago; dust and grime and mildew thickened, ink became\npaler, and contractions more contorted; it was rather an antiquary's\nbusiness now than a lawyer's to decipher them.\n\n\"What a fool I am!\" the solicitor thought. \"My cuffs will never wash\nwhite again, and all I have found is a mare's-nest. However, I'll go to\nthe bottom now. There may be a gold seal--they used to put them in with\nthe deeds three hundred years ago. A charter of Edward the Fourth, I\ndeclare! Ah, the Yordases were Yorkists--halloa! what is here? By the\nTouchstone of Shepherd, I was right after all! Well done, Long-headed\nDuncombe!\"\n\nFrom the very bottom of the box he took a parchment comparatively fresh\nand new, indorsed \"Appointment by Richard Yordas, Esquire, and Eleanor\nhis wife, of lands and heredits at Scargate and elsewhere in the county\nof York, dated Nov. 15th, A.D. 1751.\" Having glanced at the signatures\nand seals, Mr. Jellicorse spread the document, which was of moderate\ncompass, and soon convinced himself that his work of the morning had\nbeen wholly thrown away. No title could be shown to Whitestone Farm, nor\neven to Scargate Hall itself, on the part of the present owners.\n\nThe appointment was by deed-poll, and strictly in accordance with the\npowers of the settlement. Duly executed and attested, clearly though\nclumsily expressed, and beyond all question genuine, it simply nullified\n(as concerned the better half of the property) the will which had cost\nPhilip Yordas his life. For under this limitation Philip held a mere\nlife-interest, his father and mother giving all men to know by those\npresents that they did thereby from and after the decease of their said\nson Philip grant limit and appoint &c. all and singular the said lands\n&c. to the heirs of his body lawfully begotten &c. &c. in tail general,\nwith remainder over, and final remainder to the right heirs of the said\nRichard Yordas forever. From all which it followed that while Duncan\nYordas, or child, or other descendant of his, remained in the land\nof the living, or even without that if he having learned it had been\nenabled to bar the entail and then sell or devise the lands away, the\nladies in possession could show no title, except a possessory one, as\nyet unhallowed by the lapse of time.\n\nMr. Jellicorse was a very pleasant-looking man, also one who took a\npleasant view of other men and things; but he could not help pulling a\nlong and sad face as he thought of the puzzle before him. Duncan Yordas\nhad not been heard of among his own hills and valleys since 1778, when\nhe embarked for India. None of the family ever had cared to write or\nread long letters, their correspondence (if any) was short, without\nbeing sweet by any means. It might be a subject for prayer and hope that\nDuncan should be gone to a better world, without leaving hostages to\nfortune here; but sad it is to say that neither prayer nor hope produces\nany faith in the counsel who prepares \"requisitions upon title.\"\n\nOn the other hand, inquiry as to Duncan's history since he left his\nnative land would be a delicate and expensive work, and perhaps even\ndangerous, if he should hear of it, and inquire about the inquirers. For\nthe last thing to be done from a legal point of view--though the\nfirst of all from a just one--was to apprise the rightful owner of his\nunexpected position. Now Mr. Jellicorse was a just man; but his justice\nwas due to his clients first.\n\nAfter a long brown-study he reaped his crop of meditation thus: \"It is a\nticklish job; and I will sleep three nights upon it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nDISQUIETUDE\n\n\nThe ladies of Scargate Hall were uneasy, although the weather was so\nfine, upon this day of early August, in the year now current. It was a\nremarkable fact, that in spite of the distance they slept asunder, which\ncould not be less than five-and-thirty yards, both had been visited by\na dream, which appeared to be quite the same dream until examined\nnarrowly, and being examined, grew more surprising in its points of\ndifference. They were much above paying any heed to dreams, though\ninstructed by the patriarchs to do so; and they seemed to be quite\ngetting over the effects, when the lesson and the punishment astonished\nthem.\n\nLately it had been established (although many leading people went\nagainst it, and threatened to prosecute the man for trespass) that here\nin these quiet and reputable places, where no spy could be needed, a man\nshould come twice every week with letters, and in the name of the\nking be paid for them. Such things were required in towns, perhaps, as\ncorporations and gutters were; but to bring them where people could mind\ntheir own business, and charge them two groats for some fool who knew\ntheir names, was like putting a tax upon their christening. So it was\nthe hope of many, as well as every one's belief, that the postman, being\nof Lancastrian race, would very soon be bogged, or famished, or get lost\nin a fog, or swept off by a flood, or go and break his own neck from a\nprecipice.\n\nThe postman, however, was a wiry fellow, and as tough as any native, and\nhe rode a pony even tougher than himself, whose cradle was a marsh, and\nwhose mother a mountain, his first breath a fog, and his weaning meat\nwire-grass, and his form a combination of sole-leather and corundum. He\nwore no shoes for fear of not making sparks at night, to know the road\nby, and although his bit had been a blacksmith's rasp, he would yield\nto it only when it suited him. The postman, whose name was George King\n(which confounded him with King George, in the money to pay), carried a\nsword and blunderbuss, and would use them sooner than argue.\n\nNow this man and horse had come slowly along, without meaning any\nmischief, to deliver a large sealed packet, with sixteen pence to pay\nput upon it, \"to Mistress Philippa Yordas, etc., her own hands, and\nspeed, speed, speed;\" which they carried out duly by stop, stop, stop,\nwhensoever they were hungry, or saw any thing to look at. None the less\nfor that, though with certainty much later, they arrived in good trim,\nby the middle of the day, and ready for the comfort which they both\ndeserved.\n\nAs yet it was not considered safe to trust any tidings of importance to\nthe post in such a world as this was; and even were it safe, it would be\nbad manners from a man of business. Therefore Mr. Jellicorse had sealed\nup little, except his respectful consideration and request to be allowed\nto wait upon his honored clients, concerning a matter of great moment,\nupon the afternoon of Thursday then next ensuing. And the post had gone\nso far, to give good distance for the money, that the Thursday of the\nfuture came to be that very day.\n\nThe present century opened with a chilly and dark year, following three\nbad seasons of severity and scarcity. And in the northwest of Yorkshire,\nthough the summer was now so far advanced, there had been very little\nsunshine. For the last day or two, the sun had labored to sweep up the\nmist and cloud, and was beginning to prevail so far that the mists drew\ntheir skirts up and retired into haze, while the clouds fell away to the\nring of the sky, and there lay down to abide their time. Wherefore it\nhappened that \"Yordas House\" (as the ancient building was in old time\ncalled) had a clearer view than usual of the valley, and the river\nthat ran away, and the road that tried to run up to it. Now this\nwas considered a wonderful road, and in fair truth it was wonderful,\nwithstanding all efforts of even the Royal Mail pony to knock it to\npieces. In its rapidity down hill it surpassed altogether the river,\nwhich galloped along by the side of it, and it stood out so boldly with\nstones of no shame that even by moonlight nobody could lose it, until\nit abruptly lost itself. But it never did that, until the house it came\nfrom was two miles away, and no other to be seen; and so why should it\ngo any further?\n\nAt the head of this road stood the old gray house, facing toward the\nsouth of east, to claim whatever might come up the valley, sun, or\nstorm, or columned fog. In the days of the past it had claimed much\nmore--goods, and cattle, and tribute of the traffic going northward--as\nthe loop-holed quadrangle for impounded stock, and the deeply embrasured\ntower, showed. At the back of the house rose a mountain spine, blocking\nout the westering sun, but cut with one deep portal where a pass ran\ninto Westmoreland--the scaur-gate whence the house was named; and\nthrough this gate of mountain often, when the day was waning, a bar of\nslanting sunset entered, like a plume of golden dust, and hovered on a\nbroad black patch of weather-beaten fir-trees. The day was waning now,\nand every steep ascent looked steeper, while down the valley light and\nshade made longer cast of shuttle, and the margin of the west began to\nglow with a deep wine-color, as the sun came down--the tinge of many\nmountains and the distant sea--until the sun himself settled quietly\ninto it, and there grew richer and more ripe (as old bottled wine is fed\nby the crust), and bowed his rubicund farewell, through the postern of\nthe scaur-gate, to the old Hall, and the valley, and the face of Mr.\nJellicorse.\n\nThat gentleman's countenance did not, however, reply with its usual\nbrightness to the mellow salute of evening. Wearied and shaken by the\nlong, rough ride, and depressed by the heavy solitude, he hated and\nalmost feared the task which every step brought nearer. As the house\nrose higher and higher against the red sky, and grew darker, and as the\nsullen roar of blood-hounds (terrors of the neighborhood) roused the\nslow echoes of the crags, the lawyer was almost fain to turn his horse's\nhead, and face the risks of wandering over the moor by night. But the\nhoisting of a flag, the well-known token (confirmed by large letters\non a rock) that strangers might safely approach, inasmuch as the savage\ndogs were kennelled--this, and the thought of such an entry for his\nday-book, kept Mr. Jellicorse from ignominious flight. He was in for it\nnow, and must carry it through.\n\nIn a deep embayed window of leaded glass Mistress Yordas and her widowed\nsister sat for an hour, without many words, watching the zigzag of shale\nand rock which formed their chief communication with the peopled world.\nThey did not care to improve their access, or increase their traffic;\nnot through cold morosity, or even proud indifference, but because they\nhad been so brought up, and so confirmed by circumstance. For the Yordas\nblood, however hot and wild and savage in the gentlemen, was generally\ncalm and good, though steadfast, in the weaker vessels. For the main\npart, however, a family takes it character more from the sword than the\nspindle; and their sword hand had been like Esau's.\n\nLittle as they meddled with the doings of the world, of one thing at\nleast these stately Madams--as the baffled squires of the Riding called\nthem--were by no means heedless. They dressed themselves according to\ntheir rank, or perhaps above it. Many a nobleman's wife in Yorkshire\nhad not such apparel; and even of those so richly gifted, few could have\ncome up to the purpose better. Nobody, unless of their own sex, thought\nof their dresses when looking at them.\n\n\"He rides very badly,\" Philippa said; \"the people from the lowlands\nalways do. He may not have courage to go home tonight. But he ought to\nhave thought of that before.\"\n\n\"Poor man! We must offer him a bed, of course,\" Mrs. Carnaby answered;\n\"but he should have come earlier in the day. What shall we do with him,\nwhen he has done his business?\"\n\n\"It is not our place to amuse our lawyer. He might go and smoke in the\nJustice-room, and then Welldrum could play bagatelle with him.\"\n\n\"Philippa, you forget that the Jellicorses are of a good old county\nstock. His wife is a stupid, pretentious thing; but we need not treat\nhim as we must treat her. And it may be as well to make much of him,\nperhaps, if there really is any trouble coming.\"\n\n\"You are thinking of Pet. By-the-bye, are you certain that Pet can not\nget at Saracen? You know how he let him loose last Easter, when the flag\nwas flying, and the poor man has been in his bed ever since.\"\n\n\"Jordas will see to that. He can be trusted to mind the dogs well,\never since you fined him in a fortnight's wages. That was an excellent\nthought of yours.\"\n\nJordas might have been called the keeper, or the hind, or the henchman,\nor the ranger, or the porter, or the bailiff, or the reeve, or some\nother of some fifty names of office, in a place of more civilization, so\nmany and so various were his tasks. But here his professional name was\nthe \"dogman;\" and he held that office according to an ancient custom of\nthe Scargate race, whence also his surname (if such it were) arose. For\nof old time and in outlandish parts a finer humanity prevailed, and a\nricher practical wisdom upon certain questions. Irregular offsets of the\nstock, instead of being cast upon the world as waifs and strays, were\nallowed a place in the kitchen-garden or stable-yard, and flourished\nthere without disgrace, while useful and obedient. Thus for generations\nhere the legitimate son was Yordas, and took the house and manors; the\nillegitimate became Jordas, and took to the gate, and the minding of the\ndogs, and any other office of fidelity.\n\nThe present Jordas was, however, of less immediate kin to the owners,\nbeing only the son of a former Jordas, and in the enjoyment of a\nChristian name, which never was provided for a first-hand Jordas; and\nnow as his mistress looked out on the terrace, his burly figure came\nduly forth, and his keen eyes ranged the walks and courts, in search of\nMaster Lancelot, who gave him more trouble in a day, sometimes, than all\nthe dogs cost in a twelvemonth. With a fine sense of mischief, this\nboy delighted to watch the road for visitors, and then (if barbarously\ndenied his proper enjoyment and that of the dogs) he still had goodly\ndevices of his own for producing little tragedies.\n\nMr. Jellicorse knew Jordas well, and felt some pity for him, because, if\nhis grandmother had been wiser, he might have been the master now; and\nthe lawyer, having much good feeling, liked not to make a groom of him.\nJordas, however, knew his place, and touched his hat respectfully, then\nhelped the solicitor to dismount, the which was sorely needed.\n\n\"You came not by the way of the ford, Sir?\" the dogman asked, while\nconsidering the leathers. \"The water is down; you might have saved three\nmiles.\"\n\n\"Better lose thirty than my life. Will any of your men, Master Jordas,\nshow me a room, where I may prepare to wait upon your ladies?\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse walked through the old arched gate of the reever's court,\nand was shown to a room, where he unpacked his valise, and changed his\nriding clothes, and refreshed himself. A jug of Scargate ale was brought\nto him, and a bottle of foreign wine, with the cork drawn, lest\nhe should hesitate; also a cold pie, bread and butter, and a small\ncase-bottle of some liqueur. He was not hungry, for his wife had cared\nto victual him well for the journey; but for fear of offense he ate a\nmorsel, found it good, and ate some more. Then after a sip or two of the\nliqueur, and a glance or two at his black silk stockings, buckled shoes,\nand best small-clothes, he felt himself fit to go before a duchess, as\nonce upon a time he had actually done, and expressed himself very well\nindeed, according to the dialogue delivered whenever he told the story\nabout it every day.\n\nWelldrum, the butler, was waiting for him--a man who had his own ideas,\nand was going to be put upon by nobody. \"If my father could only come\nto life for one minute, he would spend it in kicking that man,\" Mrs.\nCarnaby had exclaimed, about him, after carefully shutting the door; but\nhe never showed airs before Miss Yordas.\n\n\"Come along, Sir,\" Welldrum said, after one professional glance at the\ntray, to ascertain his residue. \"My ladies have been waiting this half\nhour; and for sure, Sir, you looks wonderful! This way, Sir, and have a\ncare of them oak fagots. My ladies, Lawyer Jellicorse!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nDECISION\n\n\nThe sun was well down and away behind the great fell at the back of the\nhouse, and the large and heavily furnished room was feebly lit by four\nwax candles, and the glow of the west reflected as a gleam into eastern\nwindows. The lawyer was pleased to have it so, and to speak with a\ndimly lighted face. The ladies looked beautiful; that was all that\nMr. Jellicorse could say, when cross-examined by his wife next day\nconcerning their lace and velvet. Whether they wore lace or net was\nalmost more than he could say, for he did not heed such trifles; but\nvelvet was within his knowledge (though not the color or the shape),\nbecause he thought it hot for summer, until he remembered what the\nclimate was. Really he could say nothing more, except that they looked\nbeautiful; and when Mrs. Jellicorse jerked her head, he said that he\nonly meant, of course, considering their time of life.\n\nThe ladies saw his admiration, and felt that it was but natural. Mrs.\nCarnaby came forward kindly, and offered him a nice warm hand; while the\nelder sister was content to bow, and thank him for coming, and hope that\nhe was well. As yet it had not become proper for a gentleman, visiting\nladies, to yawn, and throw himself into the nearest chair, and cross\nhis legs, and dance one foot, and ask how much the toy-terrier cost.\nMr. Jellicorse made a fine series of bows, not without a scrape or two,\nwhich showed his goodly calf; and after that he waited for the gracious\ninvitation to sit down.\n\n\"If I understood your letter clearly,\" Mistress Yordas began, when these\nlittle rites were duly accomplished, \"you have something important\nto tell us concerning our poor property here. A small property, Mr.\nJellicorse, compared with that of the Duke of Lunedale, but perhaps a\nlittle longer in one family.\"\n\n\"The duke is a new-fangled interloper,\" replied hypocritical Jellicorse,\nthough no other duke was the husband of the duchess of whom he indited\ndaily; \"properties of that sort come and go, and only tradesmen notice\nit. Your estates have been longer in the seisin of one family, madam,\nthan any other in the Riding, or perhaps in Yorkshire.\"\n\n\"We never seized them!\" cried Mrs. Carnaby, being sensitive as to\nancestral thefts, through tales about cattle-lifting. \"You must be aware\nthat they came to us by grant from the Crown, or even before there was\nany Crown to grant them.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon for using a technical word, without explaining it.\nSeisin is a legal word, which simply means possession, or rather\nthe bodily holding of a thing, and is used especially of corporeal\nhereditaments. You ladies have seisin of this house and lands, although\nyou never seized them.\"\n\n\"The last thing we would think of doing,\" answered Mrs. Carnaby, who was\nmore impulsive than her sister, also less straightforward. \"How often\nwe have wished that our poor lost brother had not been deprived of them!\nBut our father's will was sacred, and you told us we were helpless. We\nstruggled, as you know; but we could do nothing.\"\n\n\"That is the question which brought me here,\" the lawyer said, very\nquietly, at the same time producing a small roll of parchment sealed in\ncartridge paper. \"Last week I discovered a document which I am forced\nto submit to your judgment. Shall I read it to you, or tell its purport\nbriefly?\"\n\n\"Whatever it may be, it can not in any way alter our conclusions. Our\nconclusions have never varied, however deeply they may have grieved us.\nWe were bound to do justice to our dear father.\"\n\n\"Certainly, madam; and you did it. Also, as I know, you did it as kindly\nas possible toward other relatives, and you only met with perversity.\nI had the honor of preparing your respected father's will, a model of\nclearness and precision, considering--considering the time afforded,\nand other disturbing influences. I know for a fact that a copy was laid\nbefore the finest draftsman in London, by--by those who were displeased\nwith it, and his words were: 'Beautiful! beautiful! Every word of it\nholds water.' Now that, madam, can not be said of many; indeed, of not\none in--\"\n\n\"Pardon, me for interrupting you, but I have always understood you to\nspeak highly of it. And in such a case, what can be the matter?\"\n\n\"The matter of all matters, madam, is that the testator should have\ndisposing power.\"\n\n\"He could dispose of his own property as he was disposed, you mean.\"\n\n\"You misapprehend me.\" Mr. Jellicorse now was in his element, for he\nloved to lecture--an absurdity just coming into vogue. \"Indulge me one\nmoment. I take this silver dish, for instance; it is in my hands, I have\nthe use of it; but can I give it to either of you ladies?\"\n\n\"Not very well, because it belongs to us already.\"\n\n\"You misapprehend me. I can not give it because it is not mine to give.\"\nMrs. Carnaby looked puzzled.\n\n\"Eliza, allow me,\" said Mistress Yordas, in her stiffer manner, and\nnow for the first time interfering. \"Mr. Jellicorse assures us that his\nlanguage is a model of clearness and precision; perhaps he will prove it\nby telling us now, in plain words, what his meaning is.\"\n\n\"What I mean, madam, is that your respected father could devise you a\npart only of this property, because the rest was not his to devise. He\nonly had a life-interest in it.\"\n\n\"His will, therefore, fails as to some part of the property? How much,\nand what part, if you please?\"\n\n\"The larger and better part of the estates, including this house and\ngrounds, and the home-farm.\"\n\nMrs. Carnaby started and began to speak; but her sister moved only to\nstop her, and showed no signs of dismay or anger.\n\n\"For fear of putting too many questions at once,\" she said, with a\nslight bow and a smile, \"let me beg you to explain, as shortly as\npossible, this very surprising matter.\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse watched her with some suspicion, because she called it\nso surprising, yet showed so little surprise herself. For a moment he\nthought that she must have heard of the document now in his hands; but\nhe very soon saw that it could not be so. It was only the ancient\nYordas pride, perversity, and stiffneckedness. And even Mrs. Carnaby,\nstrengthened by the strength of her sister, managed to look as if\nnothing more than a tale of some tenant were pending. But this, or\nten times this, availed not to deceive Mr. Jellicorse. That gentleman,\nhaving seen much of the world, whispered to himself that this was all\n\"high jinks,\" felt himself placed on the stool of authority, and even\nventured upon a pinch of snuff. This was unwise, and cost him dear,\nfor the ladies would not have been true to their birth if they had not\nstored it against him.\n\nHe, however, with a friendly mind, and a tap now and then upon his\ndocument, to give emphasis to his story, recounted the whole of it, and\nset forth how much was come of it already, and how much it might lead\nto. To Scargate Hall, and the better part of the property always enjoyed\ntherewith, Philippa Yordas and Eliza Carnaby had no claim whatever,\nexcept on the score of possession, until it could be shown that their\nbrother Duncan was dead, without any heirs or assignment (which might\nhave come to pass through a son adult), and even so, his widow might\ncome forward and give trouble. Concerning all that, there was time\nenough to think; but something must be done at once to cancel the\nbargain with Sir Walter Carnaby, without letting his man of law get\nscent of the fatal defect in title. And now that the ladies knew all,\nwhat did they say?\n\nIn answer to this, the ladies were inclined to put the whole blame upon\nhim, for not having managed matters better; and when he had shown that\nthe whole of it was done before he had any thing to do with it, they\nwere firmly convinced that he ought to have known it, and found a proper\nremedy. And in the finished manner of well-born ladies they gave him\nto know, without a strong expression, that such an atrocity was a black\nstain on every legal son of Satan, living, dead, or still to issue from\nGerizim.\n\n\"That can not affect the title now--I assure you, madam, that it can\nnot,\" the unfortunate lawyer exclaimed at last; \"and as for damages,\npoor old Duncombe has left no representatives, even if an action would\nlie now, which is simply out of the question. On my part no neglect can\nbe shown, and indeed for your knowledge of the present state of things,\nif humbly I may say so, you are wholly indebted to my zeal.\"\n\n\"Sir, I heartily wish,\" Mrs. Carnaby replied, \"that your zeal had been\nexhausted on your own affairs.\"\n\n\"Eliza, Mr. Jellicorse has acted well, and we can not feel too much\nobliged to him.\" Miss Yordas, having humor of a sort, smiled faintly at\nthe double meaning of her own words, which was not intended. \"Whatever\nis right must be done, of course, according to the rule of our family.\nIn such a case it appears to me that mere niceties of laws, and quips\nand quirks, are entirely subordinate to high sense of honor. The first\nconsideration must be thoroughly unselfish and pure justice.\"\n\nThe lawyer looked at her with admiration. He was capable of large\nsentiments. And yet a faint shadow of disappointment lingered in the\nfolios of his heart--there might have been such a very grand long suit,\nupon which his grandson (to be born next month) might have been enabled\nto settle for life, and bring up a legal family. Justice, however, was\njustice, and more noble than even such prospects. So he bowed his head,\nand took another pinch of snuff.\n\nBut Mrs. Carnaby (who had wept a little, in a place beyond the\ncandle-light) came back with a passionate flush in her eyes, and a\nresolute bearing of her well-formed neck.\n\n\"Philippa, I am amazed at you,\" she said, \"Mr. Jellicorse, my share\nis equal with my sister's, and more, because my son comes after me.\nWhatever she may do, I will never yield a pin's point of my rights, and\nleave my son a beggar. Philippa, would you make Pet a beggar? And his\nturtle in bed, before the sun is on the window, and his sturgeon jelly\nwhen he gets out of bed! There never was any one, by a good Providence,\nless sent into the world to be a beggar.\"\n\nMrs. Carnaby, having discharged her meaning, began to be overcome by it.\nShe sat down, in fear of hysteria, but with her mind made up to stop it;\nwhile the gallant Jellicorse was swept away by her eloquence, mixed with\nprofessional views. But it came home to him, from experience with his\nwife, that the less he said the wiser. But while he moved about, and\nalmost danced, in his strong desire to be useful, there was another who\nsat quite still, and meant to have the final say.\n\n\"From some confusion of ideas, I suppose, or possibly through my own\nfault,\" Philippa Yordas said, with less contempt in her voice than in\nher mind, \"it seems that I can not make my meaning clear, even to my\nown sister. I said that we first must do the right, and scorn all legal\nsubtleties. That we must maintain unselfish justice, and high sense of\nhonor. Can there be any doubt what these dictate? What sort of daughters\nshould we be if we basely betrayed our own father's will?\"\n\n\"Excellent, madam,\" the lawyer said; \"that view of the case never struck\nme. But there is a great deal in it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Philippa, how noble you are!\" her sister Eliza cried; and cried no\nmore, so far as tears go, for a long time afterward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nANERLEY FARM\n\n\nOn the eastern coast of the same great county, at more than ninety\nmiles of distance for a homing pigeon, and some hundred and twenty for\na carriage from the Hall of Yordas, there was in those days, and there\nstill may be found, a property of no vast size--snug, however, and of\ngood repute--and called universally \"Anerley Farm.\" How long it has\nborne that name it knows not, neither cares to moot the question; and\nthere lives no antiquary of enough antiquity to decide it. A place of\nsmiling hope, and comfort, and content with quietude; no memory of man\nabout it runneth to the contrary; while every ox, and horse, and sheep,\nand fowl, and frisky porker, is full of warm domestic feeling and each\nhomely virtue.\n\nFor this land, like a happy country, has escaped, for years and years,\nthe affliction of much history. It has not felt the desolating tramp of\nlawyer or land-agent, nor been bombarded by fine and recovery, lease and\nrelease, bargain and sale, Doe and Roe and Geoffrey Styles, and the rest\nof the pitiless shower of slugs, ending with a charge of Demons. Blows,\nand blights, and plagues of that sort have not come to Anerley, nor any\nother drain of nurture to exhaust the green of meadow and the gold of\nharvest. Here stands the homestead, and here lies the meadow-land;\nthere walk the kine (having no call to run), and yonder the wheat in the\nhollow of the hill, bowing to the silvery stroke of the wind, is touched\nwith the promise of increasing gold.\n\nAs good as the cattle and the crops themselves are the people that live\nupon them; or at least, in a fair degree, they try to be so; though\nnot of course so harmless, or faithful, or peaceful, or charitable.\nBut still, in proportion, they may be called as good; and in fact they\nbelieve themselves much better. And this from no conceit of any sort,\nbeyond what is indispensable; for nature not only enables but compels a\nman to look down upon his betters.\n\nFrom generation to generation, man, and beast, and house, and land, have\ngone on in succession here, replacing, following, renewing, repairing\nand being repaired, demanding and getting more support, with such\njudicious give-and-take, and thoroughly good understanding, that now in\nthe August of this year, when Scargate Hall is full of care, and afraid\nto cart a load of dung, Anerley farm is quite at ease, and in the very\nbest of heart, man, and horse, and land, and crops, and the cock that\ncrows the time of day. Nevertheless, no acre yet in Yorkshire, or in the\nwhole wide world, has ever been so farmed or fenced as to exclude the\nstep of change.\n\nFrom father to son the good lands had passed, without even a will to\ndisturb them, except at distant intervals; and the present owner was\nStephen Anerley, a thrifty and well-to-do Yorkshire farmer of the olden\ntype. Master Anerley was turned quite lately of his fifty-second year,\nand hopeful (if so pleased the Lord) to turn a good many more years yet,\nas a strong horse works his furrow. For he was strong and of a cheerful\nface, ruddy, square, and steadfast, built up also with firm body to a\nwholesome stature, and able to show the best man on the farm the way to\nswing a pitchfork. Yet might he be seen, upon every Lord's day, as\nclean as a new-shelled chestnut; neither at any time of the week was he\ndirtier than need be. Happy alike in the place of his birth, his lot in\nlife, and the wisdom of the powers appointed over him, he looked up with\na substantial faith, yet a solid reserve of judgment, to the Church, the\nJustices of the Peace, spiritual lords and temporal, and above all His\nMajesty George the Third. Without any reserve of judgmemt, which could\nnot deal with such low subjects, he looked down upon every Dissenter,\nevery pork-dealer, and every Frenchman. What he was brought up to, that\nhe would abide by; and the sin beyond repentance, to his mind, was the\nsin of the turncoat.\n\nWith all these hard-set lines of thought, or of doctrine (the scabbard\nof thought, which saves its edge, and keeps it out of mischief), Stephen\nAnerley was not hard, or stern, or narrow-hearted. Kind, and gentle, and\ngood to every one who knew \"how to behave himself,\" and dealing to\nevery man full justice--meted by his own measure--he was liable even\nto generous acts, after being severe and having his own way. But if any\nbody ever got the better of him by lies, and not fair bettering, that\nman had wiser not begin to laugh inside the Riding. Stephen Anerley\nwas slow but sure; not so very keen, perhaps, but grained with kerns\nof maxim'd thought, to meet his uses as they came, and to make a rogue\nuneasy. To move him from such thoughts was hard; but to move him from a\nspoken word had never been found possible.\n\nThe wife of this solid man was solid and well fitted to him. In early\ndays, by her own account, she had possessed considerable elegance, and\nwas not devoid of it even now, whenever she received a visitor capable\nof understanding it. But for home use that gift had been cut short,\nalmost in the honey-moon, by a total want of appreciation on the part\nof her husband. And now, after five-and-twenty years of studying and\nentering into him, she had fairly earned his firm belief that she was\nthe wisest of women. For she always agreed with him, when he wished it;\nand she knew exactly when to contradict him, and that was before he had\nsaid a thing at all, and while he was rolling it slowly in his mind,\nwith a strong tendency against it. In out-door matters she never\nmeddled, without being specially consulted by the master; but in-doors\nshe governed with watchful eyes, a firm hand, and a quiet tongue.\n\nThis good woman now was five-and-forty years of age, vigorous, clean,\nand of a very pleasant look, with that richness of color which settles\non fair women when the fugitive beauty of blushing is past. When the\nwork of the morning was done, and the clock in the kitchen was only\nten minutes from twelve, and the dinner was fit for the dishing, then\nMistress Anerley remembered as a rule the necessity of looking to her\nown appearance. She went up stairs, with a quarter of an hour to spare,\nbut not to squander, and she came down so neat that the farmer was\nobliged to be careful in helping the gravy. For she always sat next to\nhim, as she had done before there came any children, and it seemed ever\nsince to be the best place for her to manage their plates and their\nmanners as well.\n\nAlas! that the kindest and wisest of women have one (if not twenty)\nblind sides to them; and if any such weakness is pointed out, it is sure\nto have come from their father. Mistress Anerley's weakness was almost\nconspicuous to herself--she worshipped her eldest son, perhaps the least\nworshipful of the family.\n\nWillie Anerley was a fine young fellow, two inches taller than his\nfather, with delicate features, and curly black hair, and cheeks as\nbright as a maiden's. He had soft blue eyes, and a rich clear voice,\nwith a melancholy way of saying things, as if he were above all this.\nAnd yet he looked not like a fool; neither was he one altogether, when\nhe began to think of things. The worst of him was that he always wanted\nsomething new to go on with. He never could be idle; and yet he never\nworked to the end which crowns the task. In the early stage he would\nlabor hard, be full of the greatness of his aim, and demand every body's\ninterest, exciting, also, mighty hopes of what was safe to come of it.\nAnd even after that he sometimes carried on with patience; but he\nhad not perseverance. Once or twice he had been on the very nick of\naccomplishing something, and had driven home his nail; but then he let\nit spring back without clinching. \"Oh, any fool can do that!\" he cried,\nand never stood to it, to do it again, or to see that it came not\nundone. In a word, he stuck to nothing, but swerved about, here, there,\nand every where.\n\nHis father, being of so different a cast, and knowing how often the\nwisest of men must do what any fool can do, was bitterly vexed at the\nflighty ways of Willie, and could do no more than hope, with a general\ncontempt, that when the boy grew older he might be a wiser fool. But\nWillie's dear mother maintained, with great consistency, that such a\nperfect wonder could never be expected to do any thing not wonderful.\nTo this the farmer used to listen with a grim, decorous smile; then\ngrumbled, as soon as he was out of hearing, and fell to and did the\nlittle jobs himself.\n\nSore jealousy of Willie, perhaps, and keen sense of injustice, as well\nas high spirit and love of adventure, had driven the younger son, Jack,\nfrom home, and launched him on a sea-faring life. With a stick and a\nbundle he had departed from the ancestral fields and lanes, one summer\nmorning about three years since, when the cows were lowing for the milk\npail, and a royal cutter was cruising off the Head. For a twelvemonth\nnothing was heard of him, until there came a letter beginning, \"Dear\nand respected parents,\" and ending, \"Your affectionate and dutiful son,\nJack.\" The body of the letter was of three lines only, occupied entirely\nwith kind inquiries as to the welfare of every body, especially his pup,\nand his old pony, and dear sister Mary.\n\nMary Anerley, the only daughter and the youngest child, well deserved\nthe best remembrance of the distant sailor, though Jack may have gone\ntoo far in declaring (as he did till he came to his love-time) that the\nworld contained no other girl fit to hold a candle to her. No doubt it\nwould have been hard to find a girl more true and loving, more modest\nand industrious; but hundreds and hundreds of better girls might be\nfound perhaps even in Yorkshire.\n\nFor this maiden had a strong will of her own, which makes against\nabsolute perfection; also she was troubled with a strenuous hate\nof injustice--which is sure, in this world, to find cause for an\noutbreak--and too active a desire to rush after what is right, instead\nof being well content to let it come occasionally. And so firm could\nshe be, when her mind was set, that she would not take parables, or long\nexperience, or even kindly laughter, as a power to move her from the\nthing she meant. Her mother, knowing better how the world goes on,\npromiscuously, and at leisure, and how the right point slides away when\nstronger forces come to bear, was very often vexed by the crotchets\nof the girl, and called her wayward, headstrong, and sometimes nothing\nmilder than \"a saucy miss.\"\n\nThis, however, was absurd, and Mary scarcely deigned to cry about it,\nbut went to her father, as she always did when any weight lay on her\nmind. Nothing was said about any injustice, because that might lead to\nmore of it, as well as be (from a proper point of view) most indecorous.\nNevertheless, it was felt between them, when her pretty hair was shed\nupon his noble waistcoat, that they two were in the right, and cared\nvery little who thought otherwise.\n\nNow it was time to leave off this; for Mary (without heed almost of any\nbut her mother) had turned into a full-grown damsel, comely, sweet,\nand graceful. She was tall enough never to look short, and short enough\nnever to seem too tall, even when her best feelings were outraged;\nand nobody, looking at her face, could wish to do any thing but please\nher--so kind was the gaze of her deep blue eyes, so pleasant the\nfrankness of her gentle forehead, so playful the readiness of rosy lips\nfor a pretty answer or a lovely smile. But if any could be found so\ncallous and morose as not to be charmed or nicely cheered by this,\nlet him only take a longer look, not rudely, but simply in a spirit of\npolite inquiry; and then would he see, on the delicate rounding of each\nsoft and dimpled cheek, a carmine hard to match on palette, morning sky,\nor flower bed.\n\nLovely people ought to be at home in lovely places; and though this can\nnot be so always, as a general rule it is. At Anerley Farm the land was\nequal to the stock it had to bear, whether of trees, or corn, or cattle,\nhogs, or mushrooms, or mankind. The farm was not so large or rambling\nas to tire the mind or foot, yet wide enough and full of change--rich\npasture, hazel copse, green valleys, fallows brown, and golden\nbreast-lands pillowing into nooks of fern, clumps of shade for horse\nor heifer, and for rabbits sandy warren, furzy cleve for hare and\npartridge, not without a little mere for willows and for wild-ducks. And\nthe whole of the land, with a general slope of liveliness and rejoicing,\nspread itself well to the sun, with a strong inclination toward the\nmorning, to catch the cheery import of his voyage across the sea.\n\nThe pleasure of this situation was the more desirable because of all\nthe parts above it being bleak and dreary. Round the shoulders of the\nupland, like the arch of a great arm-chair, ran a barren scraggy ridge,\nwhereupon no tree could stand upright, no cow be certain of her own\ntail, and scarcely a crow breast the violent air by stooping ragged\npinions, so furious was the rush of wind when any power awoke the\nclouds; or sometimes, when the air was jaded with continual conflict, a\nheavy settlement of brackish cloud lay upon a waste of chalky flint.\n\nBy dint of persevering work there are many changes for the better now,\nmore shelter and more root-hold; but still it is a battle-ground of\nwinds, which rarely change their habits, for this is the chump of the\nspine of the Wolds, which hulks up at last into Flamborough Head.\n\nFlamborough Head, the furthest forefront of a bare and jagged coast,\nstretches boldly off to eastward--a strong and rugged barrier. Away\nto the north the land falls back, with coving bends, and some straight\nlines of precipice and shingle, to which the German Ocean sweeps, seldom\nfree from sullen swell in the very best of weather. But to the southward\nof the Head a different spirit seems to move upon the face of every\nthing. For here is spread a peaceful bay, and plains of brighter sea\nmore gently furrowed by the wind, and cliffs that have no cause to be so\nsteep, and bathing-places, and scarcely freckled sands, where towns\nmay lay their drain-pipes undisturbed. In short, to have rounded that\nheadland from the north is as good as to turn the corner of a garden\nwall in March, and pass from a buffeted back, and bare shivers, to a\nsunny front of hope all as busy as a bee, with pears spurring forward\ninto creamy buds of promise, peach-trees already in a flush of tasselled\npink, and the green lobe of the apricot shedding the snowy bloom.\n\nBelow this point the gallant skipper of the British collier, slouching\nwith a heavy load of grime for London, or waddling back in ballast to\nhis native North, alike is delighted to discover storms ahead, and to\ncast his tarry anchor into soft gray calm. For here shall he find the\ngood shelter of friends like-minded with himself, and of hospitable\nturn, having no cause to hurry any more than he has, all too wise to\ncommand their own ships; and here will they all jollify together while\nthe sky holds a cloud or the locker a drop. Nothing here can shake their\nships, except a violent east wind, against which they wet the other eye;\nlazy boats visit them with comfort and delight, while white waves are\nleaping, in the offing; they cherish their well-earned rest, and eat the\nlotus--or rather the onion--and drink ambrosial grog; they lean upon the\nbulwarks, and contemplate their shadows--the noblest possible employment\nfor mankind--and lo! if they care to lift their eyes, in the south\nshines the quay of Bridlington, inland the long ridge of Priory stands\nhigh, and westward in a nook, if they level well a clear glass (after\nholding on the slope so many steamy ones), they may espy Anerley Farm,\nand sometimes Mary Anerley herself.\n\nFor she, when the ripple of the tide is fresh, and the glance of the\nsummer morn glistening on the sands, also if a little rocky basin\nhappens to be fit for shrimping, and only some sleepy ships at anchor\nin the distance look at her, fearless she--because all sailors are\ngenerally down at breakfast--tucks up her skirt and gayly runs upon the\naccustomed play-ground, with her pony left to wait for her. The pony is\nold, while she is young (although she was born before him), and now he\nbelies his name, \"Lord Keppel,\" by starting at every soft glimmer of the\nsea. Therefore now he is left to roam at his leisure above high-water\nmark, poking his nose into black dry weed, probing the winnow casts\nof yellow drift for oats, and snorting disappointment through a gritty\ndance of sand-hoppers.\n\nMary has brought him down the old \"Dane's Dike\" for society rather than\nservice, and to strengthen his nerves with the dew of the salt, for\nthe sake of her Jack who loved him. He may do as he likes, as he always\ndoes. If his conscience allows him to walk home, no one will think the\nless of him. Having very little conscience at his time of life (after\nso much contact with mankind), he considers convenience only. To go home\nwould suit him very well, but his crib would be empty till his young\nmistress came; moreover, there is a little dog that plagues him when his\ndoor is open; and in spite of old age, it is something to be free, and\nin spite of all experience, to hope for something good. Therefore Lord\nKeppel is as faithful as the rocks; he lifts his long heavy head, and\ngazes wistfully at the anchored ships, and Mary is sure that the darling\npines for his absent master.\n\nBut she, with the multitudinous tingle of youth, runs away rejoicing.\nThe buoyant power and brilliance of the morning are upon her, and the\nair of the bright sea lifts and spreads her, like a pillowy skate's egg.\nThe polish of the wet sand flickers like veneer of maple-wood at every\nquick touch of her dancing feet. Her dancing feet are as light as nature\nand high spirits made them, not only quit of spindle heels, but even\nfree from shoes and socks left high and dry on the shingle. And lighter\neven than the dancing feet the merry heart is dancing, laughing at the\nshadows of its own delight; while the radiance of blue eyes springs like\na fount of brighter heaven; and the sunny hair falls, flows, or floats,\nto provoke the wind for playmate.\n\nSuch a pretty sight was good to see for innocence and largeness. So the\nbuoyancy of nature springs anew in those who have been weary, when they\nsee her brisk power inspiring the young, who never stand still to think\nof her, but are up and away with her, where she will, at the breath of\nher subtle encouragement.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA DANE IN THE DIKE\n\n\nNow, whether spy-glass had been used by any watchful mariner, or whether\nonly blind chance willed it, sure it is that one fine morning Mary met\nwith somebody. And this was the more remarkable, when people came to\nthink of it, because it was only the night before that her mother had\nalmost said as much.\n\n\"Ye munna gaw doon to t' sea be yersell,\" Mistress Anerley said to her\ndaughter; \"happen ye mought be one too many.\"\n\nMaster Anerley's wife had been at \"boarding-school,\" as far south as\nSuffolk, and could speak the very best of Southern English (like her\ndaughter Mary) upon polite occasion. But family cares and farm-house\nlife had partly cured her of her education, and from troubles of distant\nspeech she had returned to the ease of her native dialect.\n\n\"And if I go not to the sea by myself,\" asked Mary, with natural logic,\n\"why, who is there now to go with me?\" She was thinking of her sadly\nmissed comrade, Jack.\n\n\"Happen some day, perhaps, one too many.\"\n\nThe maiden was almost too innocent to blush; but her father took her\npart as usual.\n\n\"The little lass sall gaw doon,\" he said, \"wheniver sha likes.\" And so\nshe went down the next morning.\n\nA thousand years ago the Dane's Dike must have been a very grand\nintrenchment, and a thousand years ere that perhaps it was still\ngrander; for learned men say that it is a British work, wrought out\nbefore the Danes had even learned to build a ship. Whatever, however,\nmay be argued about that, the wise and the witless do agree about one\nthing--the stronghold inside it has been held by Danes, while severed by\nthe Dike from inland parts; and these Danes made a good colony of their\nown, and left to their descendants distinct speech and manners, some\ntraces of which are existing even now. The Dike, extending from the\nrough North Sea to the calmer waters of Bridlington Bay, is nothing more\nthan a deep dry trench, skillfully following the hollows of the ground,\nand cutting off Flamborough Head and a solid cantle of high land from\nthe rest of Yorkshire. The corner, so intercepted, used to be and is\nstill called \"Little Denmark;\" and the in-dwellers feel a large contempt\nfor all their outer neighbors. And this is sad, because Anerley Farm\nlies wholly outside of the Dike, which for a long crooked distance\nserves as its eastern boundary.\n\nUpon the morning of the self-same day that saw Mr. Jellicorse set forth\nupon his return from Scargate Hall, armed with instructions to defy the\ndevil, and to keep his discovery quiet--upon a lovely August morning\nof the first year of a new century, Mary Anerley, blithe and gay, came\nriding down the grassy hollow of this ancient Dane's Dike. This was\nher shortest way to the sea, and the tide would suit (if she could only\ncatch it) for a take of shrimps, and perhaps even prawns, in time for\nher father's breakfast. And not to lose this, she arose right early,\nand rousing Lord Keppel, set forth for the spot where she kept her net\ncovered with sea-weed. The sun, though up and brisk already upon sea\nand foreland, had not found time to rout the shadows skulking in\nthe dingles. But even here, where sap of time had breached the turfy\nramparts, the hover of the dew-mist passed away, and the steady light\nwas unfolded.\n\nFor the season was early August still, with beautiful weather come\nat last; and the green world seemed to stand on tiptoe to make the\nextraordinary acquaintance of the sun. Humble plants which had long lain\nflat stood up with a sense of casting something off; and the damp heavy\ntrunks which had trickled for a twelvemonth, or been only sponged with\nmoss, were hailing the fresher light with keener lines and dove-colored\ntints upon their smoother boles. Then, conquering the barrier of the\neastern land crest, rose the glorious sun himself, strewing before him\ntrees and crags in long steep shadows down the hill. Then the sloping\nrays, through furze and brush-land, kindling the sparkles of the dew,\ndescended to the brink of the Dike, and scorning to halt at petty\nobstacles, with a hundred golden hurdles bridged it wherever any opening\nwas.\n\nUnder this luminous span, or through it where the crossing gullies ran,\nMary Anerley rode at leisure, allowing her pony to choose his pace. That\nprivilege he had long secured, in right of age, wisdom, and remarkable\nforce of character. Considering his time of life, he looked well and\nsleek, and almost sprightly; and so, without any reservation, did his\ngentle and graceful rider. The maiden looked well in a place like that,\nas indeed in almost any place; but now she especially set off the color\nof things, and was set off by them. For instance, how could the silver\nof the dew-cloud, and golden weft of sunrise, playing through the\ndapples of a partly wooded glen, do better (in the matter of variety)\nthan frame a pretty moving figure in a pink checked frock, with a skirt\nof russet murrey, and a bright brown hat? Not that the hat itself was\nbright, even under the kiss of sunshine, simply having seen already too\nmuch of the sun, but rather that its early lustre seemed to be revived\nby a sense of the happy position it was in; the clustering hair and the\nbright eyes beneath it answering the sunny dance of life and light. Many\na handsomer face, no doubt, more perfect, grand, and lofty, received--at\nleast if it was out of bed--the greeting of that morning sun; but\nscarcely any prettier one, or kinder, or more pleasant, so gentle\nwithout being weak, so good-tempered without looking void of all temper\nat all.\n\nSuddenly the beauty of the time and place was broken by sharp angry\nsound. Bang! bang! came the roar of muskets fired from the shore at the\nmouth of the Dike, and echoing up the winding glen. At the first report\nthe girl, though startled, was not greatly frightened; for the sound was\ncommon enough in the week when those most gallant volunteers entitled\nthe \"Yorkshire Invincibles\" came down for their annual practice of\nskilled gunnery against the French. Their habit was to bring down a\nred cock, and tether him against a chalky cliff, and then vie with one\nanother in shooting at him. The same cock had tested their skill for\nthree summers, but failed hitherto to attest it, preferring to return in\na hamper to his hens, with a story of moving adventures.\n\nMary had watched those Invincibles sometimes from a respectful distance,\nand therefore felt sure (when she began to think) that she had not them\nto thank for this little scare. For they always slept soundly in the\nfirst watch of the morning; and even supposing they had jumped up with\nnightmare, where was the jubilant crow of the cock? For the cock, being\nalmost as invincible as they were, never could deny himself the glory of\na crow when the bullet came into his neighborhood. He replied to every\nvolley with an elevated comb, and a flapping of his wings, and a clarion\npeal, which rang along the foreshore ere the musket roar died out. But\nbefore the girl had time to ponder what it was, or wherefore, round the\ncorner came somebody, running very swiftly.\n\nIn a moment Mary saw that this man had been shot at, and was making for\nhis life away; and to give him every chance she jerked her pony aside,\nand called and beckoned; and without a word he flew to her. Words were\nbeyond him, till his breath should come back, and he seemed to have no\ntime to wait for that. He had outstripped the wind, and his own wind, by\nhis speed.\n\n\"Poor man!\" cried Mary Anerley, \"what a hurry you are in! But I suppose\nyou can not help it. Are they shooting at you?\"\n\nThe runaway nodded, for he could not spare a breath, but was deeply\ninhaling for another start, and could not even bow without hinderance.\nBut to show that he had manners, he took off his hat. Then he clapped it\non his head and set off again.\n\n\"Come back!\" cried the maid; \"I can show you a place. I can hide you\nfrom your enemies forever.\"\n\nThe young fellow stopped. He was come to that pitch of exhaustion in\nwhich a man scarcely cares whether he is killed or dies. And his face\nshowed not a sign of fear.\n\n\"Look! That little hole--up there--by the fern. Up at once, and this\ncloth over you!\"\n\nHe snatched it, and was gone, like the darting lizard, up a little\npuckering side issue of the Dike, at the very same instant that three\nbroad figures and a long one appeared at the lip of the mouth. The\nquick-witted girl rode on to meet them, to give the poor fugitive time\nto get into his hole and draw the brown skirt over him. The dazzle of\nthe sun, pouring over the crest, made the hollow a twinkling obscurity;\nand the cloth was just in keeping with the dead stuff around. The three\nbroad men, with heavy fusils cocked, came up from the sea mouth of\nthe Dike, steadily panting, and running steadily with a long-enduring\nstride. Behind them a tall bony man with a cutlass was swinging it high\nin the air, and limping, and swearing with great velocity.\n\n\"Coast-riders,\" thought Mary, \"and he a free-trader! Four against one is\ncowardice.\"\n\n\"Halt!\" cried the tall man, while the rest were running past her; \"halt!\nground arms; never scare young ladies.\" Then he flourished his hat, with\na grand bow to Mary. \"Fair young Mistress Anerley, I fear we spoil your\nride. But his Majesty's duty must be done. Hats off, fellows, at the\nname of your king! Mary, my dear, the most daring villain, the devil's\nown son, has just run up here--scarcely two minutes--you must have seen\nhim. Wait a minute; tell no lies--excuse me, I mean fibs. Your father is\nthe right sort. He hates those scoundrels. In the name of his Majesty,\nwhich way is he gone?\"\n\n\"Was it--oh, was it a man, if you please? Captain Carroway, don't say\nso.\"\n\n\"A man? Is it likely that we shot at a woman? You are trifling. It will\nbe the worse for you. Forgive me--but we are in such a hurry. Whoa!\nwhoa! pony.\"\n\n\"You always used to be so polite, Sir, that you quite surprise me. And\nthose guns look so dreadful! My father would be quite astonished to see\nme not even allowed to go down to the sea, but hurried back here, as if\nthe French had landed.\"\n\n\"How can I help it, if your pony runs away so?\" For Mary all this time\nhad been cleverly contriving to increase and exaggerate her pony's fear,\nand so brought the gunners for a long way up the Dike, without giving\nthem any time to spy at all about. She knew that this was wicked from a\nloyal point of view; not a bit the less she did it. \"What a troublesome\nlittle horse it is!\" she cried. \"Oh, Captain Carroway, hold him just a\nmoment. I will jump down, and then you can jump up, and ride after all\nhis Majesty's enemies.\"\n\n\"The Lord forbid! He slews all out of gear, like a carronade with rotten\nlashings. If I boarded him, how could I get out of his way? No, no, my\ndear, brace him up sharp, and bear clear.\"\n\n\"But you wanted to know about some enemy, captain. An enemy as bad as my\npoor Lord Keppel?\"\n\n\"Mary, my dear, the very biggest villain! A hundred golden guineas on\nhis head, and half for you. Think of your father, my dear, and Sunday\ngowns. And you must have a young man by-and-by, you know--such a\nbeautiful maid as you are. And you might get a leather purse, and give\nit to him. Mary, on your duty, now?\"\n\n\"Captain, you drive me so, what can I say? I can not bear the thought of\nbetraying any body.\"\n\n\"Of course not, Mary dear; nobody asks you. He must be half a mile off\nby this time. You could never hurt him now; and you can tell your father\nthat you have done your duty to the king.\"\n\n\"Well, Captain Carroway, if you are quite sure that it is too late to\ncatch him, I can tell you all about him. But remember your word about\nthe fifty guineas.\"\n\n\"Every farthing, every farthing, Mary, whatever my wife may say to it.\nQuick! quick! Which way did he run, my dear?\"\n\n\"He really did not seem to me to be running at all; he was too tired.\"\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure, a worn-out fox! We have been two hours after\nhim; he could not run; no more can we. But which way did he go, I mean?\"\n\n\"I will not say any thing for certain, Sir; even for fifty guineas. But\nhe may have come up here--mind, I say not that he did--and if so, he\nmight have set off again for Sewerby. Slowly, very slowly, because of\nbeing tired. But perhaps, after all, he was not the man you mean.\"\n\n\"Forward, double-quick! We are sure to have him!\" shouted the\nlieutenant--for his true rank was that--flourishing his cutlass again,\nand setting off at a wonderful pace, considering his limp. \"Five guineas\nevery man Jack of you. Thank you, young mistress--most heartily thank\nyou. Dead or alive, five guineas!\"\n\nWith gun and sword in readiness, they all rushed off; but one of the\nparty, named John Cadman, shook his head and looked back with great\nmistrust at Mary, having no better judgment of women than this, that he\nnever could believe even his own wife. And he knew that it was mainly\nby the grace of womankind that so much contraband work was going on.\nNevertheless, it was out of his power to act upon his own low opinions\nnow.\n\nThe maiden, blushing deeply with the sense of her deceit, was informed\nby her guilty conscience of that nasty man's suspicions, and therefore\ngave a smack with her fern whip to Lord Keppel, impelling him to join,\nlike a loyal little horse, the pursuit of his Majesty's enemies. But no\nsooner did she see all the men dispersed, and scouring the distance with\ntrustful ardor, than she turned her pony's head toward the sea again,\nand rode back round the bend of the hollow. What would her mother say if\nshe lost the murrey skirt, which had cost six shillings at Bridlington\nfair? And ten times that money might be lost much better than for her\nfather to discover how she lost it. For Master Stephen Anerley was\na straight-backed man, and took three weeks of training in the Land\nDefense Yeomanry, at periods not more than a year apart, so that many\npeople called him \"Captain\" now; and the loss of his suppleness at knee\nand elbow had turned his mind largely to politics, making him stiffly\npatriotic, and especially hot against all free-traders putting bad\nbargains to his wife, at the cost of the king and his revenue. If the\nbargain were a good one, that was no concern of his.\n\nNot that Mary, however, could believe, or would even have such a bad\nmind as to imagine, that any one, after being helped by her, would be\nmean enough to run off with her property. And now she came to think of\nit, there was something high and noble, she might almost say something\ndownright honest, in the face of that poor persecuted man. And in spite\nof all his panting, how brave he must have been, what a runner, and how\nclever, to escape from all those cowardly coast-riders shooting right\nand left at him! Such a man steal that paltry skirt that her mother\nmade such a fuss about! She was much more likely to find it in her\nclothes-press filled with golden guineas.\n\nBefore she was as certain as she wished to be of this (by reason of\nshrewd nativity), and while she believed that the fugitive must have\nseized such a chance and made good his escape toward North Sea or\nFlamborough, a quick shadow glanced across the long shafts of the sun,\nand a bodily form sped after it. To the middle of the Dike leaped a\nyoung man, smiling, and forth from the gully which had saved his life.\nTo look at him, nobody ever could have guessed how fast he had fled, and\nhow close he had lain hid. For he stood there as clean and spruce and\ncareless as even a sailor can be wished to be. Limber yet stalwart,\nagile though substantial, and as quick as a dart while as strong as a\npike, he seemed cut out by nature for a true blue-jacket; but condition\nhad made him a smuggler, or, to put it more gently, a free-trader.\nBritannia, being then at war with all the world, and alone in the right\n(as usual), had need of such lads, and produced them accordingly, and\nsometimes one too many. But Mary did not understand these laws.\n\nThis made her look at him with great surprise, and almost doubt whether\nhe could be the man, until she saw her skirt neatly folded in his hand,\nand then she said, \"How do you do, Sir?\"\n\nThe free-trader looked at her with equal surprise. He had been in such\na hurry, and his breath so short, and the chance of a fatal bullet after\nhim so sharp, that his mind had been astray from any sense of beauty,\nand of every thing else except the safety of the body. But now he looked\nat Mary, and his breath again went from him.\n\n\"You can run again now; I am sure of it,\" said she; \"and if you would\nlike to do any thing to please me, run as fast as possible.\"\n\n\"What have I to run away from now?\" he answered, in a deep sweet voice.\n\"I run from enemies, but not from friends.\"\n\n\"That is very wise. But your enemies are still almost within call of\nyou. They will come back worse than ever when they find you are not\nthere.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid, fair lady, for I understand their ways. I have led\nthem a good many dances before this; though it would have been my\nlast, without your help. They will go on, all the morning, in the wrong\ndirection, even while they know it. Carroway is the most stubborn of\nmen. He never turns back; and the further he goes, the better his bad\nleg is. They will scatter about, among the fields and hedges, and call\none another like partridges. And when they can not take another step,\nthey will come back to Anerley for breakfast.\"\n\n\"I dare say they will; and we shall be glad to see them. My father is a\nsoldier, and his duty is to nourish and comfort the forces of the king.\"\n\n\"Then you are young Mistress Anerley? I was sure of it before. There are\nno two such. And you have saved my life. It is something to owe it so\nfairly.\"\n\nThe young sailor wanted to kiss Mary's hand; but not being used to any\ngallantry, she held out her hand in the simplest manner to take back\nher riding skirt; and he, though longing in his heart to keep it, for a\ntoken or pretext for another meeting, found no excuse for doing so. And\nyet he was not without some resource.\n\nFor the maiden was giving him a farewell smile, being quite content with\nthe good she had done, and the luck of recovering her property; and that\nsense of right which in those days formed a part of every good young\nwoman said to her plainly that she must be off. And she felt how unkind\nit was to keep him any longer in a place where the muzzle of a gun, with\na man behind it, might appear at any moment. But he, having plentiful\nbreath again, was at home with himself to spend it.\n\n\"Fair young lady,\" he began, for he saw that Mary liked to be called\na lady, because it was a novelty, \"owing more than I ever can pay you\nalready, may I ask a little more? Then it is that, on your way down to\nthe sea, you would just pick up (if you should chance to see it) the\nfellow ring to this, and perhaps you will look at this to know it by.\nThe one that was shot away flew against a stone just on the left of the\nmouth of the Dike, but I durst not stop to look for it, and I must not\ngo back that way now. It is more to me than a hatful of gold, though\nnobody else would give a crown for it.\"\n\n\"And they really shot away one of your ear-rings? Careless, cruel,\nwasteful men! What could they have been thinking of?\"\n\n\"They were thinking of getting what is called 'blood-money.' One hundred\npounds for Robin Lyth. Dead or alive--one hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"It makes me shiver, with the sun upon me. Of course they must offer\nmoney for--for people. For people who have killed other people, and bad\nthings--but to offer a hundred pounds for a free-trader, and fire\ngreat guns at him to get it--I never should have thought it of Captain\nCarroway.\"\n\n\"Carroway only does his duty. I like him none the worse for it. Carroway\nis a fool, of course. His life has been in my hands fifty times; but I\nwill never take it. He must be killed sooner or later, because he rushes\ninto every thing. But never will it be my doing.\"\n\n\"Then are you the celebrated Robin Lyth--the new Robin Hood, as they\ncall him? The man who can do almost any thing?\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley, I am Robin Lyth; but, as you have seen, I can not do\nmuch. I can not even search for my own earring.\"\n\n\"I will search for it till I find it. They have shot at you too much.\nCowardly, cowardly people! Captain Lyth, where shall I put it, if I find\nit?\"\n\n\"If you could hide it for a week, and then--then tell me where to find\nit, in the afternoon, toward four o'clock, in the lane toward Bempton\nCliffs. We are off tonight upon important business. We have been too\ncareless lately, from laughing at poor Carroway.\"\n\n\"You are very careless now. You quite frighten me almost. The\ncoast-riders might come back at any moment. And what could you do then?\"\n\n\"Run away gallantly, as I did before; with this little difference, that\nI should be fresh, while they are as stiff as nut-cracks. They have\nmissed the best chance they ever had at me; it will make their temper\nvery bad. If they shot at me again, they could do no good. Crooked mood\nmakes crooked mode.\"\n\n\"You forget that I should not see such things. You may like very much to\nbe shot at; but--but you should think of other people.\"\n\n\"I shall think of you only--I mean of your great kindness, and your\npromise to keep my ring for me. Of course you will tell nobody, Carroway\nwill have me like a tiger if you do. Farewell, young lady--for one week\nfarewell.\"\n\nWith a wave of his hat he was gone, before Mary had time to retract her\npromise; and she thought of her mother, as she rode on slowly to look\nfor the smuggler's trinket.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCAPTAIN CARROWAY\n\n\nFame, that light-of-love trusted by so many, and never a wife till a\nwidow--fame, the fair daughter of fuss and caprice, may yet take the\nphantom of bold Robin Lyth by the right hand, and lead it to a pedestal\nalmost as lofty as Robin Hood's, or she may let it vanish like a bat\nacross Lethe--a thing not bad enough for eminence.\n\nHowever, at the date and in the part of the world now dealt with, this\ngreat free-trader enjoyed the warm though possibly brief embrace of\nfame, having no rival, and being highly respected by all who were\nunwarped by a sense of duty. And blessed as he was with a lively nature,\nhe proceeded happily upon his path in life, notwithstanding a certain\nticklish sense of being shot at undesirably. This had befallen him\nnow so often, without producing any tangible effect, that a great many\npeople, and especially the shooters (convinced of the accuracy of their\naim), went far to believe that he possessed some charm against wholesome\nbullet and gunpowder. And lately even a crooked sixpence dipped in holy\nwater (which was still to be had in Yorkshire) confirmed and doubled\nthe faith of all good people, by being declared upon oath to have passed\nclean through him, as was proved by its being picked up quite clean.\n\nThis strong belief was of great use to him; for, like many other\nbeliefs, it went a very long way to prove itself. Steady left hands now\ngrew shaky in the level of the carbine, and firm forefingers trembled\nslightly upon draught of trigger, and the chief result of a large\ndischarge was a wale upon the marksman's shoulder. Robin, though so\nclever and well practiced in the world, was scarcely old enough yet to\nhave learned the advantage of misapprehension, which, if well handled by\nany man, helps him, in the cunning of paltry things, better than a truer\nestimate. But without going into that, he was pleased with the fancy of\nbeing invulnerable, which not only doubled his courage, but trebled\nthe discipline of his followers, and secured him the respect of all\ntradesmen. However, the worst of all things is that just when they are\nestablishing themselves, and earning true faith by continuance, out of\npure opposition the direct contrary arises, and begins to prove itself.\nAnd to Captain Lyth this had just happened in the shot which carried off\nhis left ear-ring.\n\nNot that his body, or any fleshly member, could be said directly to have\nparted with its charm, but that a warning and a diffidence arose from so\nnear a visitation. All genuine sailors are blessed with strong faith, as\nthey must be, by nature's compensation. Their bodies continually going\nup and down upon perpetual fluxion, they never could live if their minds\ndid the same, like the minds of stationary landsmen. Therefore their\nminds are of stanch immobility, to restore the due share of firm\nelement. And not only that, but these men have compressed (through\ngenerations of circumstance), from small complications, simplicity.\nBeing out in all weathers, and rolling about so, how can they stand\nupon trifles? Solid stays, and stanchions, and strong bulwarks are their\nneed, and not a dance of gnats in gossamer; hating all fogs, they blow\nnot up with their own breath misty mysteries, and gazing mainly at\nthe sky and sea, believe purely in God and the devil. In a word, these\nsailors have religion.\n\nSome of their religion is not well pronounced, but declares itself\nin overstrong expressions. However, it is in them, and at any moment\nwaiting opportunity of action--a shipwreck or a grape-shot; and the\nchaplain has good hopes of them when the doctor has given them over.\n\nNow one of their principal canons of faith, and the one best observed\nin practice, is (or at any rate used to be) that a man is bound to wear\near-rings. For these, as sure tradition shows, and no pious mariner\nwould dare to doubt, act as a whetstone in all weathers to the keen\nedge of the eyes. Semble--as the lawyers say--that this idea was born of\ngreat phonetic facts in the days when a seaman knew his duty better\nthan the way to spell it; and when, if his outlook were sharpened by\na friendly wring from the captain of the watch, he never dreamed of a\npolice court.\n\nBut Robin Lyth had never cared to ask why he wore ear-rings. His nature\nwas not meditative. Enough for him that all the other men of Flamborough\ndid so; and enough for them that their fathers had done it. Whether his\nown father had done so, was more than he could say, because he knew of\nno such parent; and of that other necessity, a mother, he was equally\nignorant. His first appearance at Flamborough, though it made little\nstir at the moment in a place of so many adventures, might still be\nconsidered unusual, and in some little degree remarkable. So that\nMistress Anerley was not wrong when she pressed upon Lieutenant Carroway\nhow unwise it might be to shoot him, any more than Carroway himself was\nwrong in turning in at Anerley gate for breakfast.\n\nThis he had not done without good cause of honest and loyal necessity.\nFree-trading Robin had predicted well the course of his pursuers.\nRushing eagerly up the Dike, and over its brim, with their muskets, that\ngallant force of revenue men steadily scoured the neighborhood; and the\nfurther they went, the worse they fared. There was not a horse standing\ndown by a pool, with his stiff legs shut up into biped form, nor a cow\nstaring blandly across an old rail, nor a sheep with a pectoral cough\nbehind a hedge, nor a rabbit making rustle at the eyebrow of his hole,\nnor even a moot, that might either be a man or hold a man inside it,\nwhom or which those active fellows did not circumvent and poke into.\nIn none of these, however, could they find the smallest breach of the\nstrictest laws of the revenue; until at last, having exhausted their\nbodies by great zeal both of themselves and of mind, they braced them\nagain to the duty of going, as promptly as possible, to breakfast.\n\nFor a purpose of that kind few better places, perhaps, could be found\nthan this Anerley Farm, though not at the best of itself just now,\nbecause of the denials of the season. It is a sad truth about the\nheyday of the year, such as August is in Yorkshire--where they have no\nspring--that just when a man would like his victuals to rise to the mark\nof the period, to be simple yet varied, exhilarating yet substantial,\nthe heat of the summer day defrauds its increased length for feeding.\nFor instance, to cite a very trifling point--at least in some\nopinions--August has banished that bright content and most devout\nresignation which ensue the removal of a petted pig from this troublous\nworld of grunt. The fat pig rolls in wallowing rapture, defying his\nfriends to make pork of him yet, and hugs with complacence unpickleable\nhams. The partridge among the pillared wheat, tenderly footing the way\nfor his chicks, and teaching little balls of down to hop, knows how\nsacred are their lives to others as well as to himself; and the less\npaternal cock-pheasant scratches the ridge of green-shouldered potatoes,\nwithout fear of keeping them company at table.\n\nBut though the bright glory of the griddle remains in suspense for the\nhoary mornings, and hooks that carried woodcocks once, and hope to do\nso yet again, are primed with dust instead of lard, and the frying-pan\nhangs on the cellar nail with a holiday gloss of raw mutton suet, yet\nis there still some comfort left, yet dappled brawn, and bacon streaked,\nyet golden-hearted eggs, and mushrooms quilted with pink satin, spiced\nbeef carded with pellucid fat, buckstone cake, and brown bread scented\nwith the ash of gorse bloom--of these, and more that pave the way into\nthe good-will of mankind, what lack have fine farm-houses?\n\nAnd then, again, for the liquid duct, the softer and more sensitive,\nthe one that is never out of season, but perennially clear--here we have\nadvantage of the gentle time that mellows thirst. The long ride of the\nsummer sun makes men who are in feeling with him, and like him go up and\ndown, not forego the moral of his labor, which is work and rest. Work\nall day, and light the rounded land with fruit and nurture, and rest at\nevening, looking through bright fluid, as the sun goes down.\n\nBut times there are when sun and man, by stress of work, or clouds, or\nlight, or it may be some Process of the Equinox, make draughts upon the\nuntilted day, and solace themselves in the morning. For lack of dew the\nsun draws lengthy sucks of cloud quite early, and men who have labored\nfar and dry, and scattered the rime of the night with dust, find\nthemselves ready about 8 A.M. for the golden encouragement of gentle\nale.\n\nThe farm-house had an old porch of stone, with a bench of stone on\neither side, and pointed windows trying to look out under brows of\nivy; and this porch led into the long low hall, where the breakfast was\nbeginning. To say what was on the table would be only waste of time,\nbecause it has all been eaten so long ago; but the farmer was vexed\nbecause there were no shrimps. Not that he cared half the clip of a\nwhisker for all the shrimps that ever bearded the sea, only that he\nliked to seem to love them, to keep Mary at work for him. The flower\nof his flock, and of all the flocks of the world of the universe to his\nmind, was his darling daughter Mary: the strength of his love was upon\nher, and he liked to eat any thing of her cooking.\n\nHis body was too firm to fidget; but his mind was out of its usual\ncomfort, because the pride of his heart, his Mary, seemed to be hiding\nsomething from him. And with the justice to be expected from far clearer\nminds than his, being vexed by one, he was ripe for the relief of\nsnapping at fifty others. Mary, who could read him, as a sailor reads\nhis compass, by the corner of one eye, awaited with good content the\nusual result--an outbreak of words upon the indolent Willie, whenever\nthat young farmer should come down to breakfast, then a comforting\nglance from the mother at her William, followed by a plate kept hot for\nhim, and then a fine shake of the master's shoulders, and a stamp of\ndeparture for business. But instead of that, what came to pass was this.\n\nIn the first place, a mighty bark of dogs arose; as needs must be, when\na man does his duty toward the nobler animals; for sure it is that the\ndogs will not fail of their part. Then an inferior noise of men, crying,\n\"Good dog! good dog!\" and other fulsome flatteries, in the hope of\navoiding any tooth-mark on their legs; and after that a shaking down\nand settlement of sounds, as if feet were brought into good order, and\nstopped. Then a tall man, with a body full of corners, and a face of\ngrim temper, stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Well, well, captain, now!\" cried Stephen Anerley, getting up after\nwaiting to be spoken to, \"the breath of us all is hard to get, with\ndoing of our duty, Sir. Come ye in, and sit doon to table, and his\nMajesty's forces along o' ye.\"\n\n\"Cadman, Ellis, and Dick, be damned!\" the lieutenant shouted out to\nthem; \"you shall have all the victuals you want, by-and-by. Cross legs,\nand get your winds up. Captain of the coast-defense, I am under your\norders, in your own house.\" Carroway was starving, as only a man with\nlong and active jaws can starve; and now the appearance of the farmer's\nmouth, half full of a kindly relish, made the emptiness of his own more\nbitter. But happen what might, he resolved, as usual, to enforce strict\ndiscipline, to feed himself first, and his men in proper order.\n\n\"Walk in gentlemen, all walk in,\" Master Anerley shouted, as if all men\nwere alike, and coming to the door with a hospitable stride; \"glad to\nsee all of ye, upon my soul I am. Ye've hit upon the right time for\ncoming, too; though there might 'a been more upon the table. Mary, run,\nthat's a dear, and fetch your grandfather's big Sabbath carver. Them\npeaky little clams a'most puts out all my shoulder-blades, and wunna\nbite through a twine of gristle. Plates for all the gentlemen, Winnie\nlass! Bill, go and drah the black jarge full o' yell.\"\n\nThe farmer knew well enough that Willie was not down yet; but this was\nhis manner of letting people see that he did not approve of such hours.\n\n\"My poor lad Willie,\" said the mistress of the house, returning with a\ncourtesy the brave lieutenant's scrape, \"I fear he hath the rheum again,\noverheating of himself after sungate.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, I forgot. He hath to heat himself in bed again, with the sun\nupon his coverlid. Mary lof, how many hours was ye up?\"\n\n\"Your daughter, Sir,\" answered the lieutenant, with a glance at the\nmaiden over the opal gleam of froth, which she had headed up for\nhim--\"your daughter has been down the Dike before the sun was, and doing\nof her duty by the king and by his revenue. Mistress Anerley, your good\nhealth! Master Anerley, the like to you, and your daughter, and all of\nyour good household.\" Before they had finished their thanks for this\nhonor, the quart pot was set down empty. \"A very pretty brew, Sir--a\npretty brew indeed! Fall back, men! Have heed of discipline. A chalked\nline is what they want, Sir. Mistress Anerley, your good health again.\nThe air is now thirsty in the mornings. If those fellows could be given\na bench against the wall--a bench against the wall is what they feel for\nwith their legs. It comes so natural to their--yes, yes, their legs, and\nthe crook of their heels, ma'am, from what they were brought up to sit\nupon. And if you have any beer brewed for washing days, ma'am, that is\nwhat they like, and the right thing for their bellies. Cadman, Ellis,\nand Dick Hackerbody, sit down and be thankful.\"\n\n\"But surely, Captain Carroway, you would never be happy to sit down\nwithout them. Look at their small-clothes, the dust and the dirt! And\ntheir mouths show what you might make of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, yes; the very worst of them is that. They are always\nlooking out, here, there, and every where, for victuals everlasting. Let\nthem wait their proper time, and then they do it properly.\"\n\n\"Their proper time is now, Sir. Winnie, fill their horns up. Mary, wait\nyou upon the officer. Captain Carroway, I will not have any body starve\nin my house.\"\n\n\"Madam, you are the lawgiver in your own house. Men of the coast-guard,\nfall to upon your victuals.\"\n\nThe lieutenant frowned horribly at his men, as much as to say, \"Take no\nadvantage, but show your best manners;\" and they touched their forelocks\nwith a pleasant grin, and began to feed rapidly; and verily their wives\nwould have said that it was high time for them. Feeding, as a duty,\nwas the order of the day, and discipline had no rank left. Good things\nappeared and disappeared, with the speedy doom of all excellence. Mary,\nand Winnie the maid, flitted in and out like carrier-pigeons.\n\n\"Now when the situation comes to this,\" said the farmer at last, being\nheartily pleased with the style of their feeding and laughing, \"his\nMajesty hath made an officer of me, though void of his own writing.\nMounted Fencibles, Filey Briggers, called in the foreign parts\n'Brigadiers.' Not that I stand upon sermonry about it, except in the\nmatter of his Majesty's health, as never is due without ardent spirits.\nBut my wife hath a right to her own way, and never yet I knowed her go\naway from it.\"\n\n\"Not so, by any means,\" the mistress said, and said it so quietly that\nsome believed her; \"I never was so much for that. Captain, you are a\nmarried man. But reason is reason, in the middle of us all, and what\nelse should I say to my husband? Mary lass, Mary lof, wherever is your\nduty? The captain hath the best pot empty!\"\n\nWith a bright blush Mary sprang up to do her duty. In those days no girl\nwas ashamed to blush; and the bloodless cheek savored of small-pox.\n\n\"Hold up your head, my lof,\" her father said aloud, with a smile of\ntidy pride, and a pat upon her back; \"no call to look at all ashamed,\nmy dear. To my mind, captain, though I may be wrong, however, but to my\nmind, this little maid may stan' upright in the presence of downright\nany one.\"\n\n\"There lies the very thing that never should be said. Captain, you have\nseven children, or it may be eight of them justly. And the pride of\nlife--Mary, you be off!\"\n\nMary was glad to run away, for she liked not to be among so many men.\nBut her father would not have her triumphed over.\n\n\"Speak for yourself, good wife,\" he said. \"I know what you have got\nbehind, as well as rooks know plough-tail. Captain, you never heard me\nsay that the lass were any booty, but the very same as God hath made\nher, and thankful for straight legs and eyes. Howsoever, there might be\nworse-favored maidens, without running out of the Riding.\"\n\n\"You may ride all the way to the city of London,\" the captain exclaimed,\nwith a clinch of his fist, \"or even to Portsmouth, where my wife came\nfrom, and never find a maid fit to hold a candle for Mary to curl her\nhair by.\"\n\nThe farmer was so pleased that he whispered something; but Carroway put\nhis hand before his mouth, and said, \"Never, no, never in the morning!\"\nBut in spite of that, Master Anerley felt in his pocket for a key, and\ndeparted.\n\n\"Wicked, wicked, is the word I use,\" protested Mrs. Anerley, \"for all\nthis fribble about rooks and looks, and holding of candles, and curling\nof hair. When I was Mary's age--oh dear! It may not be so for your\ndaughters, captain; but evil for mine was the day that invented those\nproud swinging-glasses.\"\n\n\"That you may pronounce, ma'am, and I will say Amen. Why, my eldest\ndaughter, in her tenth year now--\"\n\n\"Come, Captain Carroway,\" broke in the farmer, returning softly with a\nsquare old bottle, \"how goes the fighting with the Crappos now? Put your\nlegs up, and light your pipe, and tell us all the news.\"\n\n\"Cadman, and Ellis, and Dick Hackerbody,\" the lieutenant of the\ncoast-guard shouted, \"you have fed well. Be off, men; no more neglect of\nduty! Place an outpost at fork of the Sewerby road, and strictly observe\nthe enemy, while I hold a council of war with my brother officer,\nCaptain Anerley. Half a crown for you, if you catch the rogue, half\na crown each, and promotion of twopence. Attention, eyes right, make\nyourselves scarce! Well, now the rogues are gone, let us make ourselves\nat home. Anerley, your question is a dry one. A dry one; but this is\nuncommonly fine stuff! How the devil has it slipped through our fingers?\nNever mind that, inter amicos--Sir, I was at school at Shrewsbury--but\nas to the war, Sir, the service is going to the devil, for the want of\npure principle.\"\n\nThe farmer nodded; and his looks declared that to some extent he felt\nit. He had got the worst side of some bargains that week; but his wife\nhad another way of thinking.\n\n\"Why, Captain Carroway, whatever could be purer? When you were at sea,\nhad you ever a man of the downright principles of Nelson?\"\n\n\"Nelson has done very well in his way; but he is a man who has risen too\nfast, as other men rise too slowly. Nothing in him; no substance,\nmadam; I knew him as a youngster, and I could have tossed him on a\nmarling-spike. And instead of feeding well, Sir, he quite wore himself\naway. To my firm knowledge, he would scarcely turn the scale upon a good\nFrenchman of half of the peas. Every man should work his own way up,\nunless his father did it for him. In my time we had fifty men as good,\nand made no fuss about them.\"\n\n\"And you not the last of them, captain, I dare say. Though I do love to\nhear of the Lord's Lord Nelson, as the people call him. If ever a man\nfought his own way up--\"\n\n\"Madam, I know him, and respect him well. He would walk up to the devil,\nwith a sword between his teeth, and a boarder's pistol in each hand.\nMadam, I leaped, in that condition, a depth of six fathoms and a half\ninto the starboard mizzen-chains of the French line-of-battle ship Peace\nand Thunder.\"\n\n\"Oh, Captain Carroway, how dreadful! What had you to lay hold with?\"\n\n\"At such times a man must not lay hold. My business was to lay about;\nand I did it to some purpose. This little slash, across my eyes struck\nfire, and it does the same now by moonlight.\"\n\nOne of the last men in the world to brag was Lieutenant Carroway.\nNothing but the great thirst of this morning, and strong necessity\nof quenching it, could ever have led him to speak about himself, and\nremember his own little exploits. But the farmer was pleased, and said,\n\"Tell us some more, Sir.\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley,\" the captain answered, shutting up the scar, which he\nwas able to expand by means of a muscle of excitement, \"you know that\na man should drop these subjects when he has got a large family. I have\nbeen in the Army and the Navy, madam, and now I am in the Revenue; but\nmy duty is first to my own house.\"\n\n\"Do take care, Sir; I beg you to be careful. Those free-traders now are\ncome to such a pitch that any day or night they may shoot you.\"\n\n\"Not they, madam. No, they are not murderers. In a hand-to-hand conflict\nthey might do it, as I might do the same to them. This very morning my\nmen shot at the captain of all smugglers, Robin Lyth, of Flamborough,\nwith a hundred guineas upon his head. It was no wish of mine; but my\nbreath was short to stop them, and a man with a family like mine can\nnever despise a hundred guineas.\"\n\n\"Why, Sophy,\" said the farmer, thinking slowly, with a frown, \"that\nmust have been the noise come in at window, when I were getting up\nthis morning. I said, 'Why, there's some poacher fellow popping at the\nconies!' and out I went straight to the warren to see. Three gun-shots,\nor might 'a been four. How many men was you shooting at?\"\n\n\"The force under my command was in pursuit of one notorious\ncriminal--that well-known villain, Robin Lyth.\"\n\n\"Captain, your duty is to do your duty. But without your own word for\nit, I never would believe that you brought four gun muzzles down upon\none man.\"\n\n\"The force under my command carried three guns only. It was not in their\npower to shoot off four.\"\n\n\"Captain, I never would have done it in your place. I call it no better\nthan unmanly. Now go you not for to stir yourself amiss. To look thunder\nat me is what I laugh at. But many things are done in a hurry, Captain\nCarroway, and I take it that this was one of them.\"\n\n\"As to that, no! I will not have it. All was in thorough good order.\nI was never so much as a cable's length behind, though the devil, some\nyears ago, split my heel up, like his own, Sir.\"\n\n\"Captain, I see it, and I ask your pardon. Your men were out of reach of\nhollering. At our time of life the wind dies quick, from want of blowing\noftener.\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" cried the captain. \"Who was the freshest that came to your\nhospitable door, Sir? I will foot it with any man for six leagues, but\nnot for half a mile, ma'am. I depart from nothing. I said, 'Fire!' and\nfire they did, and they shall again. What do Volunteers know of the\nservice?\"\n\n\"Stephen, you shall not say a single other word;\" Mistress Anerley\nstopped her husband thus; \"these matters are out of your line\naltogether; because you have never taken any body's blood. The captain\nhere is used to it, like all the sons of Belial, brought up in the early\nportions of the Holy Writ.\"\n\nLieutenant Carroway's acquaintance with the Bible was not more extensive\nthan that of other officers, and comprised little more than the story\nof Joseph, and that of David and Goliath; so he bowed to his hostess for\nher comparison, while his gaunt and bristly countenance gave way to\na pleasant smile. For this officer of the British Crown had a face of\nstrong features, and upon it whatever he thought was told as plainly as\nthe time of day is told by the clock in the kitchen. At the same time,\nMaster Anerley was thinking that he might have said more than a host\nshould say concerning a matter which, after all, was no particular\nconcern of his; whereas it was his special place to be kind to any\nvisitor. All this he considered with a sound grave mind, and then\nstretched forth his right hand to the officer.\n\nCarroway, being a generous man, would not be outdone in apologies. So\nthese two strengthened their mutual esteem, without any fighting--which\ngenerally is the quickest way of renewing respect--and Mistress Anerley,\nhaving been a little frightened, took credit to herself for the good\nwords she had used. Then the farmer, who never drank cordials, although\nhe liked to see other people do it, set forth to see a man who was come\nabout a rick, and sundry other business. But Carroway, in spite of all\nhis boasts, was stiff, though he bravely denied that he could be; and\nwhen the good housewife insisted on his stopping to listen to something\nthat was much upon her mind, and of great importance to the revenue, he\ncould not help owning that duty compelled him to smoke another pipe, and\nhearken.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nROBIN COCKSCROFT\n\n\nNothing ever was allowed to stop Mrs. Anerley from seeing to the\nbedrooms. She kept them airing for about three hours at this time of the\nsun-stitch--as she called all the doings of the sun upon the sky--and\nthen there was pushing, and probing, and tossing, and pulling, and\nthumping, and kneading of knuckles, till the rib of every feather was\naching; and then (like dough before the fire) every well-belabored tick\nwas left to yeast itself a while. Winnie, the maid, was as strong as a\npost, and wore them all out in bed-making. Carroway heard the beginning\nof this noise, but none of it meddled at all with his comfort; he lay\nback nicely in a happy fit of chair, stretched his legs well upon a\nbench, and nodded, keeping slow time with the breathings of his pipe,\nand drawing a vapory dream of ease. He had fared many stony miles afoot\nthat morning; and feet, legs, and body were now less young than they\nused to be once upon a time. Looking up sleepily, the captain had idea\nof a pretty young face hanging over him, and a soft voice saying, \"It\nwas me who did it all,\" which was very good grammar in those days; \"will\nyou forgive me? But I could not help it, and you must have been sorry to\nshoot him.\"\n\n\"Shoot every body who attempts to land,\" the weary man ordered,\ndrowsily. \"Mattie, once more, you are not to dust my pistols.\"\n\n\"I could not be happy without telling you the truth,\" the soft voice\ncontinued, \"because I told you such a dreadful story. And now--Oh! here\ncomes mother!\"\n\n\"What has come over you this morning, child? You do the most\nextraordinary things, and now you can not let the captain rest. Go round\nand look for eggs this very moment. You will want to be playing fine\nmusic next. Now, captain, I am at your service, if you please, unless\nyou feel too sleepy.\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley, I never felt more wide-awake in all my life. We of\nthe service must snatch a wink whenever we can, but with one eye open;\nand it is not often that we see such charming sights.\"\n\nThe farmer's wife having set the beds to \"plump,\" had stolen a look at\nthe glass, and put on her second-best Sunday cap, in honor of a real\nofficer; and she looked very nice indeed, especially when she received a\ncompliment. But she had seen too much of life to be disturbed thereby.\n\n\"Ah, Captain Carroway, what ways you have of getting on with simple\npeople, while you are laughing all the time at them! It comes of the\nforeign war experience, going on so long that in the end we shall all\nbe foreigners. But one place there is that you never can conquer, nor\nBoneypart himself, to my belief.\"\n\n\"Ah, you mean Flamborough--Flamborough, yes! It is a nest of\ncockatrices.\"\n\n\"Captain, it is nothing of the sort. It is the most honest place in all\nthe world. A man may throw a guinea on the crossroads in the night, and\nhave it back from Dr. Upandown any time within seven years. You ought to\nknow by this time what they are, hard as it is to get among them.\"\n\n\"I only know that they can shut their mouths; and the devil himself--I\nbeg your pardon, madam--Old Nick himself never could unscrew them.\"\n\n\"You are right, Sir. I know their manner well. They are open as the sky\nwith one another, but close as the grave to all the world outside them,\nand most of all to people of authority like you.\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley, you have just hit it. Not a word can I get out of\nthem. The name of the king--God bless him!--seems to have no weight\namong them.\"\n\n\"And you can not get at them, Sir, by any dint of money, or even by\nliving in the midst of them. The only way to do it is by kin of blood,\nor marriage. And that is how I come to know more about them than almost\nany body else outside. My master can scarcely win a word of them even,\nkind as he is, and well-spoken; and neither might I, though my tongue\nwas tenfold, if it were not for Joan Cockscroft. But being Joan's\ncousin, I am like one of themselves.\"\n\n\"Cockscroft! Cockscroft? I have heard that name. Do they keep the\npublic-house there?\"\n\nThe lieutenant was now on the scent of duty, and assumed his most\nknowing air, the sole effect of which was to put every body upon guard\nagainst him. For this was a man of no subtlety, but straightforward,\ndownright, and ready to believe; and his cleverest device was to seem to\ndisbelieve.\n\n\"The Cockscrofts keep no public-house,\" Mrs. Anerley answered, with a\nlittle flush of pride. \"Why, she was half-niece to my own grandmother,\nand never was beer in the family. Not that it would have been wrong, if\nit was. Captain, you are thinking of Widow Precious, licensed to the Cod\nwith the hook in his gills. I should have thought, Sir, that you might\nhave known a little more of your neighbors having fallen below the path\nof life by reason of bad bank-tokens. Banking came up in her parts like\ndog-madness, as it might have done here, if our farmers were the fools\nto handle their cash with gloves on. And Joan became robbed by the fault\nof her trustees, the very best bakers in Scarborough, though Robin never\nmarried her for it, thank God! Still it was very sad, and scarcely bears\ndescribing of, and pulled them in the crook of this world's swing to\na lower pitch than if they had robbed the folk that robbed and ruined\nthem. And Robin so was driven to the fish again, which he always had\nhankered after. It must have been before you heard of this coast,\ncaptain, and before the long war was so hard on us, that every body\nabout these parts was to double his bags by banking, and no man was\nright to pocket his own guineas, for fear of his own wife feeling them.\nAnd bitterly such were paid out for their cowardice and swindling of\ntheir own bosoms.\"\n\n\"I have heard of it often, and it served them right. Master Anerley knew\nwhere his money was safe, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Neither Captain Robin Cockscroft nor his wife was in any way to blame,\"\nanswered Mrs. Anerley. \"I have framed my mind to tell you about them;\nand I will do it truly, if I am not interrupted. Two hammers never yet\ndrove a nail straight, and I make a rule of silence when my betters wish\nto talk.\"\n\n\"Madam, you remind me of my own wife. She asks me a question, and she\nwill not let me answer.\"\n\n\"That is the only way I know of getting on. Mistress Carroway must\nunderstand you, captain. I was at the point of telling you how my\ncousin Joan was married, before her money went, and when she was really\ngood-looking. I was quite a child, and ran along the shore to see it.\nIt must have been in the high summer-time, with the weather fit for\nbathing, and the sea as smooth as a duck-pond. And Captain Robin, being\nwell-to-do, and established with every thing except a wife, and pleased\nwith the pretty smile and quiet ways of Joan--for he never had heard of\nher money, mind--put his oar into the sea and rowed from Flamborough all\nthe way to Filey Brigg, with thirty-five fishermen after him; for the\nFlamborough people make a point of seeing one another through their\ntroubles. And Robin was known for the handsomest man and the uttermost\nfisher of the landing, with three boats of his own, and good birth, and\nlong sea-lines. And there at once they found my cousin Joan, with her\ntrustees, come overland, four wagons and a cart in all of them; and\nafter they were married, they burned sea-weed, having no fear in those\ndays of invasions. And a merry day they made of it, and rowed back by\nthe moonshine. For every one liked and respected Captain Cockscroft on\naccount of his skill with the deep-sea lines, and the openness of his\nhands when full--a wonderful quiet and harmless man, as the manner is of\nall great fishermen. They had bacon for breakfast whenever they liked,\nand a guinea to lend to any body in distress.\n\n\"Then suddenly one morning, when his hair was growing gray and his eyes\ngetting weary of the night work, so that he said his young Robin must\ngrow big enough to learn all the secrets of the fishes, while his father\ntook a spell in the blankets, suddenly there came to them a shocking\npiece of news. All his wife's bit of money, and his own as well, which\nhe had been putting by from year to year, was lost in a new-fangled\nBank, supposed as faithful as the Bible. Joan was very nearly crazed\nabout it; but Captain Cockscroft never heaved a sigh, though they say\nit was nearly seven hundred guineas. 'There are fish enough still in the\nsea,' he said; 'and the Lord has spared our children. I will build a new\nboat, and not think of feather-beds.'\n\n\"Captain Carroway, he did so, and every body knows what befell him. The\nnew boat, built with his own hands, was called the Mercy Robin, for his\nonly son and daughter, little Mercy and poor Robin. The boat is there\nas bright as ever, scarlet within and white outside; but the name is\npainted off, because the little dears are in their graves. Two nicer\nchildren were never seen, clever, and sprightly, and good to learn; they\nnever even took a common bird's nest, I have heard, but loved all the\nlittle things the Lord has made, as if with a foreknowledge of going\nearly home to Him. Their father came back very tired one morning, and\nwent up the hill to his breakfast, and the children got into the boat\nand pushed off, in imitation of their daddy. It came on to blow, as it\ndoes down there, without a single whiff of warning; and when Robin awoke\nfor his middle-day meal, the bodies of his little ones were lying on the\ntable. And from that very day Captain Cockscroft and his wife began to\ngrow old very quickly. The boat was recovered without much damage; and\nin it he sits by the hour on dry land, whenever there is no one on the\ncliffs to see him, with his hands upon his lap, and his eyes upon the\nplace where his dear little children used to sit. Because he has always\ntaken whatever fell upon him gently; and of course that makes it ever so\nmuch worse when he dwells upon the things that come inside of him.\"\n\n\"Madam, you make me feel quite sorry for him,\" the lieutenant exclaimed,\nas she began to cry, \"If even one of my little ones was drowned, I\ndeclare to you, I can not tell what I should be like. And to lose them\nall at once, and as his own wife perhaps would say, because he was\nthinking of his breakfast! And when he had been robbed, and the world\nall gone against him! Madam, it is a long time, thank God, since I heard\nso sad a tale.\"\n\n\"Now you would not, captain, I am sure you would not,\" said Mistress\nAnerley, getting up a smile, yet freshening his perception of a tear as\nwell--\"you would never have the heart to destroy that poor old couple by\nstriking the last prop from under them. By the will of the Lord they are\nbroken down enough. They are quietly hobbling to their graves, and would\nyou be the man to come and knock them on their heads at once?\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley, have you ever heard that I am a brute and inhuman?\nMadam, I have no less than seven children, and I hope to have fourteen.\"\n\n\"I hope with all my heart you may. And you will deserve them all, for\npromising so very kindly not to shoot poor Robin Lyth.\"\n\n\"Robin Lyth! I never spoke of him, madam. He is outlawed, condemned,\nwith a fine reward upon him. We shot at him to-day; we shall shoot at\nhim again; and before very long we must hit him. Ma'am, it is my duty\nto the king, the Constitution, the service I belong to, and the babes I\nhave begotten.\"\n\n\"Blood-money poisons all innocent mouths, Sir, and breaks out for\ngenerations. And for it you will have to take three lives--Robin's, the\ncaptain's, and my dear old cousin Joan's.\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley, you deprive me of all satisfaction. It is just my\nluck, when my duty was so plain, and would pay so well for doing of.\"\n\n\"Listen now, captain. It is my opinion, and I am generally borne out by\nthe end, that instead of a hundred pounds for killing Robin Lyth, you\nmay get a thousand for preserving him alive. Do you know how he came\nupon this coast, and how he has won his extraordinary name?\"\n\n\"I have certainly heard rumors; scarcely any two alike. But I took no\nheed of them. My duty was to catch him; and it mattered not a straw to\nme who or what he was. But now I must really beg to know all about him,\nand what makes you think such things of him. Why should that excellent\nold couple hang upon him? and what can make him worth such a quantity\nof money? Honestly, of course, I mean; honestly worth it, ma'am, without\nany cheating of his Majesty.\"\n\n\"Captain Carroway,\" his hostess said, not without a little blush, as she\nthought of the king and his revenue, \"cheating of his Majesty is a thing\nwe leave for others. But if you wish to hear the story of that young\nman, so far as known, which is not so even in Flamborough, you must\nplease to come on Sunday, Sir; for Sunday is the only day that I can\nspare for clacking, as the common people say. I must be off now; I have\nfifty things to see to. And on Sunday my master has his best things on,\nand loves no better than to sit with his legs up, and a long clay pipe\nlying on him down below his waist (or, to speak more correctly, where\nit used to be, as he might, indeed, almost say the very same to me), and\nthen not to speak a word, but hear other folk tell stories, that might\nnot have made such a dinner as himself. And as for dinner, Sir, if\nyou will do the honor to dine with them that are no more than in the\nVolunteers, a saddle of good mutton fit for the Body-Guards to ride\nupon, the men with the skins around them all turned up, will be ready\njust at one o'clock, if the parson lets us out.\"\n\n\"My dear madam, I shall scarcely care to look at any slice of victuals\nuntil one o'clock on Sunday, by reason of looking forward.\"\n\nAfter all, this was not such a gross exaggeration, Anerley Farm being\nfamous for its cheer; whereas the poor lieutenant, at the best of times,\nhad as much as he could do to make both ends meet; and his wife, though\na wonderful manager, could give him no better than coarse bread, and\nalmost coarser meat.\n\n\"And, Sir, if your good lady would oblige us also--\"\n\n\"No, madam, no!\" he cried, with vigorous decision, having found many\nfestive occasions spoiled by excess of loving vigilance; \"we thank you\nmost truly; but I must say 'no.' She would jump at the chance; but a\nhusband must consider. You may have heard it mentioned that the Lord is\nnow considering about the production of an eighth little Carroway.\"\n\n\"Captain, I have not, or I should not so have spoken. But with all my\nheart I wish you joy.\"\n\n\"I have pleasure, I assure you, in the prospect, Mistress Anerley. My\nfriends make wry faces, but I blow them away, 'Tush,' I say, 'tush, Sir;\nat the rate we now are fighting, and exhausting all British material,\nthere can not be too many, Sir, of mettle such as mine!' What do you say\nto that, madam?\"\n\n\"Sir, I believe it is the Lord's own truth. And true it is also that our\ncountry should do more to support the brave hearts that fight for it.\"\n\nMrs. Anerley sighed, for she thought of her younger son, by his own\nperversity launched into the thankless peril of fighting England's\nbattles. His death at any time might come home, if any kind person\nshould take the trouble even to send news of it; or he might lie at the\nbottom of the sea unknown, even while they were talking. But Carroway\nbuttoned up his coat and marched, after a pleasant and kind farewell. In\nthe course of hard service he had seen much grief, and suffered plenty\nof bitterness, and he knew that it is not the part of a man to multiply\nany of his troubles but children. He went about his work, and he thought\nof all his comforts, which need not have taken very long to count,\nbut he added to their score by not counting them, and by the self-same\nprocess diminished that of troubles. And thus, upon the whole, he\ndeserved his Sunday dinner, and the tale of his hostess after it, not\na word of which Mary was allowed to hear, for some subtle reason of her\nmother's. But the farmer heard it all, and kept interrupting so, when\nhis noddings and the joggings of his pipe allowed, or, perhaps one\nshould say, compelled him, that merely for the courtesy of saving common\ntime it is better now to set it down without them. Moreover, there are\nmany things well worthy of production which she did not produce, for\nreasons which are now no hinderance. And the foremost of those reasons\nis that the lady did not know the things; the second that she could not\ntell them clearly as a man might; and the third, and best of all, that\nif she could, she would not do so. In which she certainly was quite\nright; for it would have become her very badly, as the cousin of Joan\nCockscroft (half removed, and upon the mother's side), and therefore\nkindly received at Flamborough, and admitted into the inner circle, and\nallowed to buy fish at wholesale prices, if she had turned round upon\nall these benefits, and described all the holes to be found in the\nplace, for the teaching of a revenue officer.\n\nStill, it must be clearly understood that the nature of the people is\nfishing. They never were known to encourage free-trading, but did their\nvery utmost to protect themselves; and if they had produced the very\nnoblest free-trader, born before the time of Mr. Cobden, neither the\ncredit nor the blame was theirs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nROBIN LYTH\n\n\nHalf a league to the north of bold Flamborough Head the billows have\ncarved for themselves a little cove among cliffs which are rugged, but\nnot very high. This opening is something like the grain shoot of a mill,\nor a screen for riddling gravel, so steep is the pitch of the ground,\nand so narrow the shingly ledge at the bottom. And truly in bad weather\nand at high tides there is no shingle ledge at all, but the crest of the\nwave volleys up the incline, and the surf rushes on to the top of it.\nFor the cove, though sheltered from other quarters, receives the full\nbrunt of northeasterly gales, and offers no safe anchorage. But the\nhardy fishermen make the most of its scant convenience, and gratefully\ncall it \"North Landing,\" albeit both wind and tide must be in good\nhumor, or the only thing sure of any landing is the sea. The long\ndesolation of the sea rolls in with a sound of melancholy, the gray fog\ndroops its fold of drizzle in the leaden-tinted troughs, the pent cliffs\noverhang the flapping of the sail, and a few yards of pebble and of weed\nare all that a boat may come home upon harmlessly. Yet here in the old\ntime landed men who carved the shape of England; and here even in these\nlesser days, are landed uncommonly fine cod.\n\nThe difficulties of the feat are these: to get ashore soundly, and then\nto make it good; and after that to clinch the exploit by getting on\nland, which is yet a harder step. Because the steep of the ground, like\na staircase void of stairs, stands facing you, and the cliff upon either\nside juts up close, to forbid any flanking movement, and the scanty\nscarp denies fair start for a rush at the power of the hill front. Yet\nhere must the heavy boats beach themselves, and wallow and yaw in the\nshingly roar, while their cargo and crew get out of them, their gunwales\nswinging from side to side, in the manner of a porpoise rolling, and\ntheir stem and stern going up and down like a pair of lads at seesaw.\n\nBut after these heavy boats have endured all that, they have not found\ntheir rest yet without a crowning effort. Up that gravelly and gliddery\nascent, which changes every groove and run at every sudden shower, but\nnever grows any the softer--up that the heavy boats must make clamber\nsomehow, or not a single timber of their precious frames is safe. A big\nrope from the capstan at the summit is made fast as soon as the tails of\nthe jackasses (laden with three cwt. of fish apiece) have wagged their\nlast flick at the brow of the steep; and then with \"yo-heave-ho\" above\nand below, through the cliffs echoing over the dull sea, the groaning\nand grinding of the stubborn tug begins. Each boat has her own special\ncourse to travel up, and her own special berth of safety, and she knows\nevery jag that will gore her on the road, and every flint from which she\nwill strike fire. By dint of sheer sturdiness of arms, legs, and lungs,\nkeeping true time with the pant and the shout, steadily goes it with\nhoist and haul, and cheerily undulates the melody of call that rallies\nthem all with a strong will together, until the steep bluff and the\nburden of the bulk by masculine labor are conquered, and a long row of\npowerful pinnaces displayed, as a mounted battery, against the fishful\nsea. With a view to this clambering ruggedness of life, all of these\nboats receive from their cradle a certain limber rake and accommodating\ncurve, instead of a straight pertinacity of keel, so that they may ride\nover all the scandals of this arduous world. And happen what may to\nthem, when they are at home, and gallantly balanced on the brow line of\nthe steep, they make a bright show upon the dreariness of coast-land,\nhanging as they do above the gullet of the deep. Painted outside with\nthe brightest of scarlet, and inside with the purest white, at a little\nway off they resemble gay butterflies, preening their wings for a flight\ninto the depth.\n\nHere it must have been, and in the middle of all these, that the very\nfamous Robin Lyth--prophetically treating him, but free as yet of fame\nor name, and simply unable to tell himself--shone in the doubt of the\nearly daylight (as a tidy-sized cod, if forgotten, might have shone)\nupon the morning of St. Swithin, A.D. 1782.\n\nThe day and the date were remembered long by all the good people of\nFlamborough, from the coming of the turn of a long bad luck and a bitter\ntime of starving. For the weather of the summer had been worse than\nusual--which is no little thing to say--and the fish had expressed their\nopinion of it by the eloquent silence of absence. Therefore, as the\nwhole place lives on fish, whether in the fishy or the fiscal form,\ngoodly apparel was becoming very rare, even upon high Sundays; and\nstomachs that might have looked well beneath it, sank into unobtrusive\ngrief. But it is a long lane that has no turning; and turns are the\nessence of one very vital part.\n\nSuddenly over the village had flown the news of a noble arrival of\nfish. From the cross-roads, and the public-house, and the licensed\nhead-quarters of pepper and snuff, and the loop-hole where a sheep had\nbeen known to hang, in times of better trade, but never could dream of\nhanging now; also from the window of the man who had had a hundred\nheads (superior to his own) shaken at him because he set up for making\nbreeches in opposition to the women, and showed a few patterns of what\nhe could do if any man of legs would trade with him--from all these\nhead-centres of intelligence, and others not so prominent but equally\npotent, into the very smallest hole it went (like the thrill in a\ntroublesome tooth) that here was a chance come of feeding, a chance\nat last of feeding. For the man on the cliff, the despairing watchman,\nweary of fastening his eyes upon the sea, through constant fog and\ndrizzle, at length had discovered the well-known flicker, the glassy\nflaw, and the hovering of gulls, and had run along Weighing Lane so\nfast, to tell his good news in the village, that down he fell and\nbroke his leg, exactly opposite the tailor's shop. And this was on St.\nSwithin's Eve.\n\nThere was nothing to be done that night, of course, for mackerel must be\ndelicately worked; but long before the sun arose, all Flamborough, able\nto put leg in front of leg, and some who could not yet do that, gathered\ntogether where the land-hold was, above the incline for the launching\nof the boats. Here was a medley, not of fisher-folk alone, and all their\nbodily belongings, but also of the thousand things that have no soul,\nand get kicked about and sworn at much because they can not answer.\nRollers, buoys, nets, kegs, swabs, fenders, blocks, buckets, kedges,\ncorks, buckie-pots, oars, poppies, tillers, sprits, gaffs, and every\nkind of gear (more than Theocritus himself could tell) lay about,\nand rolled about, and upset their own masters, here and there and\neverywhere, upon this half acre of slip and stumble, at the top of the\nboat channel down to the sea, and in the faint rivalry of three vague\nlights, all making darkness visible.\n\nFor very ancient lanterns, with a gentle horny glimmer, and loop-holes\nof large exaggeration at the top, were casting upon anything quite\nwithin their reach a general idea of the crinkled tin that framed them,\nand a shuffle of inconstant shadows, but refused to shed any light on\nfriend or stranger, or clear up suspicions, more than three yards off.\nIn rivalry with these appeared the pale disk of the moon, just setting\nover the western highlands, and \"drawing straws\" through summer haze;\nwhile away in the northeast over the sea, a slender irregular wisp of\ngray, so weak that it seemed as if it were being blown away, betokened\nthe intention of the sun to restore clear ideas of number and of figure\nby-and-by. But little did anybody heed such things; every one ran\nagainst everybody else, and all was eagerness, haste, and bustle for the\nfirst great launch of the Flamborough boats, all of which must be taken\nin order.\n\nBut when they laid hold of the boat No. 7, which used to be the Mercy\nRobin, and were jerking the timber shores out, one of the men stooping\nunder her stern beheld something white and gleaming. He put his hand\ndown to it, and, lo! it was a child, in imminent peril of a deadly\ncrush, as the boat came heeling over. \"Hold hard!\" cried the man, not in\ntime with his voice, but in time with his sturdy shoulder, to delay the\ndescent of the counter. Then he stooped underneath, while they steadied\nthe boat, and drew forth a child in a white linen dress, heartily asleep\nand happy.\n\nThere was no time to think of any children now, even of a man's own\nfine breed, and the boat was beginning much to chafe upon the rope, and\nthirty or forty fine fellows were all waiting, loath to hurry Captain\nRobin (because of the many things he had dearly lost), yet straining\nupon their own hearts to stand still. And the captain could not find his\nwife, who had slipped aside of the noisy scene, to have her own little\ncry, because of the dance her children would have made if they had lived\nto see it.\n\nThere were plenty of other women running all about to help, and to talk,\nand to give the best advice to their husbands and to one another;\nbut most of them naturally had their own babies, and if words came to\naction, quite enough to do to nurse them. On this account, Cockscroft\ncould do no better, bound as he was to rush forth upon the sea, than lay\nthe child gently aside of the stir, and cover him with an old sail, and\nleave word with an ancient woman for his wife when found. The little boy\nslept on calmly still, in spite of all the din and uproar, the song and\nthe shout, the tramp of heavy feet, the creaking of capstans, and the\nthump of bulky oars, and the crush of ponderous rollers. Away went these\nupon their errand to the sea, and then came back the grating roar and\nplashy jerks of launching, the plunging, and the gurgling, and the quiet\nmurmur of cleft waves.\n\nThat child slept on, in the warm good luck of having no boat keel\nlaunched upon him, nor even a human heel of bulk as likely to prove\nfatal. And the ancient woman fell asleep beside him, because at her time\nof life it was unjust that she should be astir so early. And it happened\nthat Mrs. Cockscroft followed her troubled husband down the steep,\nhaving something in her pocket for him, which she failed to fetch to\nhand. So everybody went about its own business (according to the laws\nof nature), and the old woman slept by the side of the child, without\ngiving him a corner of her scarlet shawl.\n\nBut when the day was broad and brave, and the spirit of the air was\nvigorous, and every cliff had a color of its own, and a character to\ncome out with; and beautiful boats, upon a shining sea, flashed their\noars, and went up waves which clearly were the stairs of heaven; and\nnever a woman, come to watch her husband, could be sure how far he had\ncarried his obedience in the matter of keeping his hat and coat on;\nneither could anybody say what next those very clever fishermen might\nbe after--nobody having a spy-glass--but only this being understood\nall round, that hunger and salt were the victuals for the day, and\nthe children must chew the mouse-trap baits until their dads came home\nagain; and yet in spite of all this, with lightsome hearts (so hope\noutstrips the sun, and soars with him behind her) and a strong will,\nup the hill they went, to do without much breakfast, but prepare for a\nglorious supper. For mackerel are good fish that do not strive to live\nforever, but seem glad to support the human race.\n\nFlamburians speak a rich burr of their own, broadly and handsomely\ndistinct from that of outer Yorkshire. The same sagacious contempt for\nall hot haste and hurry (which people of impatient fibre are too apt to\ncall \"a drawl\") may here be found, as in other Yorkshire, guiding and\nretarding well that headlong instrument the tongue. Yet even here there\nis advantage on the side of Flamborough--a longer resonance, a larger\nbreadth, a deeper power of melancholy, and a stronger turn up of the\ntail of discourse, by some called the end of a sentence. Over and above\nall these there dwell in \"Little Denmark\" many words foreign to the\nreal Yorkshireman. But, alas! these merits of their speech can not be\nembodied in print without sad trouble, and result (if successful)\nstill more saddening. Therefore it is proposed to let them speak in our\ninferior tongue, and to try to make them be not so very long about it.\nFor when they are left to themselves entirely, they have so much solid\nmatter to express, and they ripen it in their minds and throats with a\nprocess so deliberate, that strangers might condemn them briefly, and be\noff without hearing half of it. Whenever this happens to a Flamborough\nman, he finishes what he proposed to say, and then says it all over\nagain to the wind.\n\nWhen the \"lavings\" of the village (as the weaker part, unfit for sea,\nand left behind, were politely called, being very old men, women, and\nsmall children), full of conversation, came, upon their way back from\nthe tide, to the gravel brow now bare of boats, they could not help\ndiscovering there the poor old woman that fell asleep because she ought\nto have been in bed, and by her side a little boy, who seemed to have\nno bed at all. The child lay above her in a tump of stubbly grass, where\nRobin Cockscroft had laid him; he had tossed the old sail off, perhaps\nin a dream, and he threatened to roll down upon the granny. The contrast\nbetween his young, beautiful face, white raiment, and readiness to\nroll, and the ancient woman's weary age (which it would be ungracious to\ndescribe), and scarlet shawl which she could not spare, and satisfaction\nto lie still--as the best thing left her now to do--this difference\nbetween them was enough to take anybody's notice, facing the\nwell-established sun.\n\n\"Nanny Pegler, get oop wi' ye!\" cried a woman even older, but of tougher\nconstitution. \"Shame on ye to lig aboot so. Be ye browt to bed this\ntoime o' loife?\"\n\n\"A wonderful foine babby for sich an owd moother,\" another proceeded\nwith the elegant joke; \"and foine swaddles too, wi' solid gowd upon\n'em!\"\n\n\"Stan' ivery one o' ye oot o' the way,\" cried ancient Nanny, now as\nwide-awake as ever; \"Master Robin Cockscroft gie ma t' bairn, an'\nnawbody sall hev him but Joan Cockscroft.\"\n\nJoan Cockscroft, with a heavy heart, was lingering far behind the rest,\nthinking of the many merry launches, when her smart young Robin would\nhave been in the boat with his father, and her pretty little Mercy\nclinging to her hand upon the homeward road, and prattling of the fish\nto be caught that day; and inasmuch as Joan had not been able to get\nface to face with her husband on the beach, she had not yet heard of the\nstranger child. But soon the women sent a little boy to fetch her, and\nshe came among them, wondering what it could be. For now a debate of\nsome vigor was arising upon a momentous and exciting point, though\nnot so keen by a hundredth part as it would have been twenty years\nafterward. For the eldest old woman had pronounced her decision.\n\n\"Tell ye wat, ah dean't think bud wat yon bairn mud he a Frogman.\"\n\nThis caused some panic and a general retreat; for though the immortal\nNapoleon had scarcely finished changing his teeth as yet, a chronic\nuneasiness about Crappos haunted that coast already, and they might\nhave sent this little boy to pave the way, being capable of almost\neverything.\n\n\"Frogman!\" cried the old woman next to her by birth, and believed to\nhave higher parts, though not yet ripe. \"Na, na; what Frogman here?\nFrogmen ha' skinny shanks, and larks' heels, and holes down their bodies\nlike lamperns. No sign of no frog aboot yon bairn. As fair as a wench,\nand as clean as a tyke. A' mought a'most been born to Flaambro'. And\nwhat gowd ha' Crappos got, poor divils?\"\n\nThis opened the gate for a clamor of discourse; for there surely could\nbe no denial of her words. And yet while her elder was alive and out of\nbed, the habit of the village was to listen to her say, unless any man\nof equal age arose to countervail it. But while they were thus divided,\nMrs. Cockscroft came, and they stood aside. For she had been kind to\neverybody when her better chances were; and now in her trouble all were\ngrieved because she took it so to heart. Joan Cockscroft did not say\na word, but glanced at the child with some contempt. In spite of white\nlinen and yellow gold, what was he to her own dead Robin?\n\nBut suddenly this child, whatever he was, and vastly soever inferior,\nopened his eyes and sent home their first glance to the very heart of\nJoan Cockscroft. It was the exact look--or so she always said--of her\ndead angel, when she denied him something, for the sake of his poor dear\nstomach. With an outburst of tears, she flew straight to the little one,\nsnatched him in her arms, and tried to cover him with kisses.\n\nThe child, however, in a lordly manner, did not seem to like it. He drew\naway his red lips, and gathered up his nose, and passion flew out of his\nbeautiful eyes, higher passion than that of any Cockscroft. And he\ntried to say something which no one could make out. And women of high\nconsideration, looking on, were wicked enough to be pleased at this, and\nsay that he must be a young lord, and they had quite foreseen it. But\nJoan knew what children are, and soothed him down so with delicate\nhands, and a gentle look, and a subtle way of warming his cold places,\nthat he very soon began to cuddle into her, and smile. Then she turned\nround to the other people, with both of his arms flung round her neck,\nand his cheek laid on her shoulder, and she only said, \"The Lord hath\nsent him.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nDR. UPANDOWN\n\n\nThe practice of Flamborough was to listen fairly to anything that might\nbe said by any one truly of the native breed, and to receive it well\ninto the crust of the mind, and let it sink down slowly. But even after\nthat, it might not take root, unless it were fixed in its settlement by\ntheir two great powers--the law, and the Lord.\n\nThey had many visitations from the Lord, as needs must be in such a very\nstormy place; whereas of the law they heard much less; but still they\nwere even more afraid of that; for they never knew how much it might\ncost.\n\nBalancing matters (as they did their fish, when the price was worth it,\nin Weigh Lane), they came to the set conclusion that the law and the\nLord might not agree concerning the child cast among them by the latter.\nA child or two had been thrown ashore before, and trouble once or twice\nhad come of it; and this child being cast, no one could say how, to such\na height above all other children, he was likely enough to bring a spell\nupon their boats, if anything crooked to God's will were done; and even\nto draw them to their last stocking, if anything offended the providence\nof law.\n\nIn any other place it would have been a point of combat what to say and\nwhat to do in such a case as this. But Flamborough was of all the wide\nworld happiest in possessing an authority to reconcile all doubts. The\nlaw and the Lord--two powers supposed to be at variance always, and to\nshare the week between them in proportions fixed by lawyers--the\nholy and unholy elements of man's brief existence, were combined in\nFlamborough parish in the person of its magisterial rector. He was also\nbelieved to excel in the arts of divination and medicine too, for he was\na full Doctor of Divinity. Before this gentleman must be laid, both for\npurse and conscience' sake, the case of the child just come out of the\nfogs.\n\nAnd true it was that all these powers were centred in one famous man,\nknown among the laity as \"Parson Upandown.\" For the Reverend Turner\nUpround, to give him his proper name, was a doctor of divinity, a\njustice of the peace, and the present rector of Flamborough. Of all his\noffices and powers, there was not one that he overstrained; and all that\nknew him, unless they were thorough-going rogues and vagabonds, loved\nhim. Not that he was such a soft-spoken man as many were, who thought\nmore evil; but because of his deeds and nature, which were of the\nkindest. He did his utmost, on demand of duty, to sacrifice this nature\nto his stern position as pastor and master of an up-hill parish, with\nmany wrong things to be kept under. But while he succeeded in the form\nnow and then, he failed continually in the substance.\n\nThis gentleman was not by any means a fool, unless a kind heart proves\nfolly. At Cambridge he had done very well, in the early days of the\ntripos, and was chosen fellow and tutor of Gonville and Caius College.\nBut tiring of that dull round in his prime, he married, and took to a\nliving; and the living was one of the many upon which a perpetual faster\ncan barely live, unless he can go naked also, and keep naked children.\nNow the parsons had not yet discovered the glorious merits of hard\nfasting, but freely enjoyed, and with gratitude to God, the powers with\nwhich He had blessed them. Happily Dr. Upround had a solid income of\nhis own, and (like a sound mathematician) he took a wife of terms\ncoincident. So, without being wealthy, they lived very well, and helped\ntheir poorer neighbors.\n\nSuch a man generally thrives in the thriving of his flock, and does not\nharry them. He gives them spiritual food enough to support them without\ndaintiness, and he keeps the proper distinction between the Sunday and\nthe poorer days. He clangs no bell of reproach upon a Monday, when the\nsquire is leading the lady in to dinner, and the laborer sniffing at his\nsupper pot; and he lets the world play on a Saturday, while he works his\nown head to find good ends for the morrow. Because he is a wise man who\nknows what other men are, and how seldom they desire to be told the\nsame thing more than a hundred and four times in a year. Neither did\nhis clerical skill stop here; for Parson Upround thought twice about it\nbefore he said anything to rub sore consciences, even when he had them\nat his mercy, and silent before him, on a Sunday. He behaved like a\ngentleman in this matter, where so much temptation lurks, looking always\nat the man whom he did not mean to hit, so that the guilty one received\nit through him, and felt himself better by comparison. In a word, this\nparson did his duty well, and pleasantly for all his flock; and nothing\nimbittered him, unless a man pretended to doctrine without holy orders.\n\nFor the doctor reasoned thus--and sound it sounds--if divinity is a\nmatter for Tom, Dick, or Harry, how can there be degrees in it? He held\na degree in it, and felt what it had cost; and not the parish only, but\neven his own wife, was proud to have a doctor every Sunday. And his wife\ntook care that his rich red hood, kerseymere small-clothes, and black\nsilk stockings upon calves of dignity, were such that his congregation\nscorned the surgeons all the way to Beverley.\n\nHappy in a pleasant nature, kindly heart, and tranquil home, he was also\nhappy in those awards of life in which men are helpless. He was blessed\nwith a good wife and three good children, doing well, and vigorous and\nhardy as the air and clime and cliffs. His wife was not quite of his\nown age, but old enough to understand and follow him faithfully down the\nslope of years. A wife with mind enough to know that a husband is not\nfaultless, and with heart enough to feel that if he were, she would not\nlove him so. And under her were comprised their children--two boys at\nschool, and a baby-girl at home.\n\nSo far, the rector of this parish was truly blessed and blessing. But\nin every man's lot must be some crook, since this crooked world turned\nround. In Parson Upround's lot the crook might seem a very small one;\nbut he found it almost too big for him. His dignity and peace of mind,\nlarge good-will of ministry and strong Christian sense of magistracy,\nall were sadly pricked and wounded by a very small thorn in the flesh of\nhis spirit.\n\nAlmost every honest man is the rightful owner of a nickname. When he\nwas a boy at school he could not do without one, and if the other boys\nvalued him, perhaps he had a dozen. And afterward, when there is less\nperception of right and wrong and character, in the weaker time of\nmanhood, he may earn another, if the spirit is within him.\n\nBut woe is him if a nasty foe, or somebody trying to be one, annoyed for\nthe moment with him, yet meaning no more harm than pepper, smite him to\nthe quick, at venture, in his most retired and privy-conscienced hole.\nAnd when this is done by a Nonconformist to a Doctor of Divinity, and\nthe man who does it owes some money to the man he does it to, can the\nlatter gentleman take a large and genial view of his critics.\n\nThis gross wrong and ungrateful outrage was inflicted thus. A leading\nMethodist from Filey town, who owed the doctor half a guinea, came one\nsummer and set up his staff in the hollow of a limekiln, where he lived\nupon fish for change of diet, and because he could get it for nothing.\nThis was a man of some eloquence, and his calling in life was cobbling,\nand to encourage him therein, and keep him from theology, the rector\nnot only forgot his half guinea, but sent him three or four pairs\nof riding-boots to mend, and let him charge his own price, which was\nstrictly heterodox. As a part of the bargain, this fellow came to\nchurch, and behaved as well as could be hoped of a man who had received\nhis money. He sat by a pillar, and no more than crossed his legs at the\nworst thing that disagreed with him. And it might have done him good,\nand made a decent cobbler of him, if the parson had only held him when\nhe got him on the hook. But this is the very thing which all great\npreachers are too benevolent to do. Dr. Upround looked at this sinner,\nwho was getting into a fright upon his own account, though not a bad\npreacher when he could afford it; and the cobbler could no more look up\nto the doctor than when he charged him a full crown beyond the contract.\nIn his kindness for all who seemed convinced of sin, the good preacher\nhalted, and looked at Mr. Jobbins with a soft, relaxing gaze. Jobbins\nappeared as if he would come to church forever, and never cheat any\nsound clergyman again; whereupon the generous divine omitted a whole\npage of menaces prepared for him, and passed prematurely to the tender\nstrain which always winds up a good sermon.\n\nNow what did Jobbins do in return for all this magnanimous mercy?\nInvited to dine with the senior church-warden upon the strength of\nhaving been at church, and to encourage him for another visit, and being\nasked, as soon as ever decency permitted, what he thought of Parson\nUpround's doctrine, between two crackles of young griskin (come straight\nfrom the rectory pig-sty), he was grieved to express a stern opinion\nlong remembered at Flamborough:\n\n\"Ca' yo yon mon 'Dr. Uproond?' I ca' un 'Dr. Upandoon.'\"\n\nFrom that day forth the rector of the parish was known far and wide as\n\"Dr. Upandown,\" even among those who loved him best. For the name well\ndescribed his benevolent practice of undoing any harsh thing he might\nhave said, sometimes by a smile, and very often with a shilling, or a\nbasket of spring cabbages. So that Mrs. Upround, when buttoning up his\ncoat--which he always forgot to do for himself--did it with the words,\n\"My dear, now scold no one; really it is becoming too expensive.\" \"Shall\nI abandon duty,\" he would answer, with some dignity, \"while a shilling\nis sufficient to enforce it?\"\n\nDr. Upround's people had now found out that their minister and\nmagistrate discharged his duty toward his pillow, no less than to his\npulpit. His parish had acquired, through the work of generations, a\nhabit of getting up at night, and being all alive at cock-crow; and the\nrector (while very new amongst them) tried to bow--or rather rise--to\nnight-watch. But a little of that exercise lasted him for long; and he\nliked to talk of it afterward, but for the present was obliged to drop\nit. For he found himself pale, when his wife made him see himself; and\nhis hours of shaving were so dreadful; and scarcely a bit of fair dinner\ncould be got, with the whole of the day thrown out so. In short, he\nsettled it wisely that the fishers of fish must yield to the habits of\nfish, which can not be corrected; but the fishers of men (who can live\nwithout catching them) need not be up to all their hours, but may take\nthem reasonably.\n\nHis parishioners--who could do very well without him, as far as\nthat goes, all the week, and by no means wanted him among their\nboats--joyfully left him to his own time of day, and no more worried\nhim out of season than he worried them so. It became a matter of right\nfeeling with them not to ring a big bell, which the rector had put up to\nchallenge everybody's spiritual need, until the stable clock behind the\nbell had struck ten and finished gurgling.\n\nFor this reason, on St. Swithin's morn, in the said year 1782, the\ngrannies, wives, and babes of Flamborough, who had been to help the\nlaunch, but could not pull the laboring oar, nor even hold the tiller,\nspent the time till ten o'clock in seeing to their own affairs--the\nmost laudable of all pursuits for almost any woman. And then, with some\nlittle dispute among them (the offspring of the merest accident), they\narrived in some force at the gate of Dr. Upround, and no woman liked to\npull the bell, and still less to let another woman do it for her. But an\nold man came up who was quite deaf, and every one asked him to do it.\n\nIn spite of the scarcity of all good things, Mrs. Cockscroft had\nthoroughly fed the little stranger, and washed him, and undressed him,\nand set him up in her own bed, and wrapped him in her woollen shawl,\nbecause he shivered sadly; and there he stared about with wondering\neyes, and gave great orders--so far as his new nurse could make out--but\nspeaking gibberish, as she said, and flying into a rage because it was\nout of Christian knowledge. But he seemed to understand some English,\nalthough he could only pronounce two words, both short, and in such\nconjunction quite unlawful for any except the highest Spiritual Power.\nMrs. Cockscroft, being a pious woman, hoped that her ears were wrong,\nor else that the words were foreign and meant no harm, though the\nchild seemed to take in much of what was said, and when asked his name,\nanswered, wrathfully, and as if everybody was bound to know, \"Izunsabe!\nIzunsabe!\"\n\nBut now, when brought before Dr. Upround, no child of the very best\nEnglish stock could look more calm and peaceful. He could walk well\nenough, but liked better to be carried; and the kind woman who had so\ntaken him up was only too proud to carry him. Whatever the rector and\nmagistrate might say, her meaning was to keep this little one, with her\nhusband's good consent, which she was sure of getting.\n\n\"Set him down, ma'am,\" the doctor said, when he had heard from half a\ndozen good women all about him; \"Mistress Cockscroft, put him on his\nlegs, and let me question him.\"\n\nBut the child resisted this proceeding. With nature's inborn and just\nloathing of examination, he spun upon his little heels, and swore with\nall his might, at the same time throwing up his hands and twirling his\nthumbs in a very odd and foreign way.\n\n\"What a shocking child!\" cried Mrs. Upround, who was come to know all\nabout it. \"Jane, run away with Miss Janetta.\"\n\n\"The child is not to blame,\" said the rector, \"but only the people who\nhave brought him up. A prettier or more clever little head I have never\nseen in all my life; and we studied such things at Cambridge. My fine\nlittle fellow, shake hands with me.\"\n\nThe boy broke off his vicious little dance, and looked up at this tall\ngentleman with great surprise. His dark eyes dwelt upon the parson's\nkindly face, with that power of inquiry which the very young possess,\nand then he put both little hands into the gentleman's, and burst into a\ntorrent of the most heart-broken tears.\n\n\"Poor little man!\" said the rector, very gently, taking him up in his\narms and patting the silky black curls, while great drops fell, and\na nose was rubbed on his shoulder; \"it is early for you to begin bad\ntimes. Why, how old are you, if you please?\"\n\nThe little boy sat up on the kind man's arm, and poked a small\ninvestigating finger into the ear that was next to him, and the locks\njust beginning to be marked with gray; and then he said, \"Sore,\" and\ntossed his chin up, evidently meaning, \"Make your best of that.\" And the\nwomen drew a long breath, and nudged at one another.\n\n\"Well done! Four years old, my dear. You see that he understands English\nwell enough,\" said the parson to his parishioners: \"he will tell us all\nabout himself by-and-by, if we do not hurry him. You think him a French\nchild. I do not, though the name which he gives himself, 'Izunsabe,'\nhas a French aspect about it. Let me think. I will try him with a French\ninterrogation: 'Parlez-vous Francais, mon enfan?'\"\n\nDr. Upround watched the effect of his words with outward calm, but an\ninward flutter. For if this clever child should reply in French, the\ndoctor could never go on with it, but must stand there before his\ncongregation in a worse position than when he lost his place, as\nsometimes happened, in a sermon. With wild temerity he had given vent to\nthe only French words within his knowledge; and he determined to follow\nthem up with Latin if the worst came to the worst.\n\nBut luckily no harm came of this, but, contrariwise, a lasting good.\nFor the child looked none the wiser, while the doctor's influence was\nincreased.\n\n\"Aha!\" the good parson cried. \"I was sure that he was no Frenchman.\nBut we must hear something about him very soon, for what you tell me is\nimpossible. If he had come from the sea, he must have been wet; it could\nnever be otherwise. Whereas, his linen clothes are dry, and even quite\nlately fullered--ironed you might call it.\"\n\n\"Please your worship,\" cried Mrs. Cockscroft, who was growing wild with\njealousy, \"I did up all his little things, hours and hours ere your\nhoose was up.\"\n\n\"Ah, you had night-work! To be sure! Were his clothes dry or wet when\nyou took them off?\"\n\n\"Not to say dry, your worship; and yet not to say very wet. Betwixt and\nbetween, like my good master's, when he cometh from a pour of rain, or a\nheavy spray. And the color of the land was upon them here and there.\nAnd the gold tags were sewn with something wonderful. My best pair of\nscissors would not touch it. I was frightened to put them to the tub,\nyour worship; but they up and shone lovely like a tailor's buttons. My\nmaster hath found him, Sir; and it lies with him to keep him. And the\nLord hath taken away our Bob.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Dr. Upround, gently, and placing the child in her\narms again, \"the Almighty has chastened you very sadly. This child is\nnot mine to dispose of, nor yours; but if he will comfort you, keep him\ntill we hear of him. I will take down in writing the particulars of the\ncase, when Captain Robin has come home and had his rest--say, at this\ntime to-morrow, or later; and then you will sign them, and they shall be\npublished. For you know, Mrs. Cockscroft, however much you may be taken\nwith him, you must not turn kidnapper. Moreover, it is needful, as there\nmay have been some wreck (though none of you seem to have heard of any),\nthat this strange occurrence should be made known. Then, if nothing is\nheard of it, you can keep him, and may the Lord bless him to you!\"\n\nWithout any more ado, she kissed the child, and wanted to carry him\nstraight away, after courtesying to his worship; but all the other women\ninsisted on a smack of him, for pity's sake, and the pleasure of the\ngold, and to confirm the settlement. And a settlement it was, for\nnothing came of any publication of the case, such as in those days could\nbe made without great expense and exertion.\n\nSo the boy grew up, tall, brave, and comely, and full of the spirit of\nadventure, as behooved a boy cast on the winds. So far as that goes, his\nfoster-parents would rather have found him more steady and less comely,\nfor if he was to step into their lost son's shoes, he might do it\nwithout seeming to outshine him. But they got over that little jealousy\nin time, when the boy began to be useful, and, so far as was possible,\nthey kept him under by quoting against him the character of Bob,\nbringing it back from heaven of a much higher quality than ever it was\nupon the earth. In vain did this living child aspire to such level; how\ncan an earthly boy compare with one who never did a wrong thing, as soon\nas he was dead?\n\nPassing that difficult question, and forbearing to compare a boy with\nangels, be he what he will, his first need (after that of victuals) is a\nname whereby his fellow-boys may know him. Is he to be shouted at with,\n\"Come here, what's your name?\" or is he to be called (as if in high\nrebuke), \"Boy?\" And yet there are grown-up folk who do all this without\nhesitation, failing to remember their own predicament at a by-gone\nperiod. Boys are as useful, in their way, as any other order; and if\nthey can be said to do some mischief, they can not be said to do it\nnegligently. It is their privilege and duty to be truly active; and\ntheir Maker, having spread a dull world before them, has provided them\nwith gifts of play while their joints are supple.\n\nThe present boy, having been born without a father or a mother (so far\nas could yet be discovered), was driven to do what our ancestors must\nhave done when it was less needful. That is to say, to work his own name\nout by some distinctive process. When the parson had clearly shown him\nnot to be a Frenchman, a large contumely spread itself about, by reason\nof his gold, and eyes, and hair, and name (which might be meant for\nIsaak), that he was sprung from a race more honored now than a hundred\nyears ago. But the women declared that it could not be; and the rector\ndesiring to christen him, because it might never have been done before,\nrefused point-blank to put any \"Isaac\" in, and was satisfied with\n\"Robin\" only, the name of the man who had saved him.\n\nThe rector showed deep knowledge of his flock, which looked upon Jews\nas the goats of the Kingdom; for any Jew must die for a world of\ngenerations ere ever a Christian thinks much of him. But finding him not\nto be a Jew, the other boys, instead of being satisfied, condemned him\nfor a Dutchman.\n\nWhatever he was, the boy throve well, and being so flouted by his\nplaymates, took to thoughts and habits and amusements of his own.\nIn-door life never suited him at all, nor too much of hard learning,\nalthough his capacity was such that he took more advancement in an hour\nthan the thick heads of young Flamborough made in a whole leap-year of\nSundays. For any Flamburian boy was considered a \"Brain Scholar,\" and a\n\"Head-Languager,\" when he could write down the parson's text, and chalk\nup a fish on the weigh-board so that his father or mother could tell in\nthree guesses what manner of fish it was. And very few indeed had ever\npassed this trial.\n\nFor young Robin it was a very hard thing to be treated so by the other\nboys. He could run, or jump, or throw a stone, or climb a rock with the\nbest of them; but all these things he must do by himself, simply because\nhe had no name. A feeble youth would have moped, but Robin only grew\nmore resolute. Alone he did what the other boys would scarcely in\ncompetition dare. No crag was too steep for him, no cave too dangerous\nand wave-beaten, no race of the tide so strong and swirling as to scare\nhim of his wits. He seemed to rejoice in danger, having very little else\nto rejoice in; and he won for himself by nimble ways and rapid turns on\nland and sea, the name of \"Lithe,\" or \"Lyth,\" and made it famous even\nfar inland.\n\nFor it may be supposed that his love of excitement, versatility,\nand daring demanded a livelier outlet than the slow toil of deep-sea\nfishing. To the most patient, persevering, and long-suffering of the\narts, Robin Lyth did not take kindly, although he was so handy with a\nboat. Old Robin vainly strove to cast his angling mantle over him. The\ngifts of the youth were brighter and higher; he showed an inborn fitness\nfor the lofty development of free trade. Eminent powers must force their\nway, as now they were doing with Napoleon; and they did the same with\nRobin Lyth, without exacting tithe in kind of all the foremost human\nrace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIN A LANE, NOT ALONE\n\n\nStephen Anerley's daughter was by no means of a crooked mind, but open\nas the day in all things, unless any one mistrusted her, and showed it\nby cross-questioning. When this was done, she resented it quickly by\nconcealing the very things which she would have told of her own accord;\nand it so happened that the person to whom of all she should have been\nmost open, was the one most apt to check her by suspicious curiosity.\nAnd now her mother already began to do this, as concerned the smuggler,\nknowing from the revenue officer that Mary must have seen him. Mary,\nbeing a truthful damsel, told no lies about it; but, on the other hand,\nshe did not rush forth with all the history, as she probably would have\ndone if left unexamined. And so she said nothing about the ear-ring, or\nthe run that was to come off that week, or the riding-skirt, or a host\nof little things, including her promise to visit Bempton Lane.\n\nOn the other hand, she had a mind to tell her father, and take his\nopinion about it all. But he was a little cross that evening, not with\nher, but with the world at large; and that discouraged her; and then she\nthought that being an officer of the king--as he liked to call himself\nsometimes--he might feel bound to give information about the impending\nprocess of free trade; which to her would be a breach of honor,\nconsidering how she knew of it.\n\nUpon the whole, she heartily wished that she never had seen that Robin\nLyth; and then she became ashamed of herself for indulging such a\nselfish wish. For he might have been lying dead but for her; and then\nwhat would become of the many poor people whose greatest comfort he was\nsaid to be? And what good could arise from his destruction, if cruel\npeople compassed it? Free trade must be carried on, for the sake of\neverybody, including Captain Carroway himself; and if an old and ugly\nman succeeded a young and generous one as leader of the free-trade\nmovement, all the women in the country would put the blame on her.\n\nLooking at these things loftily, and with a strong determination not\nto think twice of what any one might say who did not understand the\nsubject, Mary was forced at last to the stern conclusion that she must\nkeep her promise. Not only because it was a promise--although that went\na very long way with her--but also because there seemed no other chance\nof performing a positive duty. Simple honesty demanded that she should\nrestore to the owner a valuable, and beyond all doubt important, piece\nof property. Two hours had she spent in looking for it, and deprived\nher dear father of his breakfast shrimps; and was all this trouble to be\nthrown away, and herself, perhaps, accused of theft, because her mother\nwas so short and sharp in wanting to know everything, and to turn it her\nown way?\n\nThe trinket, which she had found at last, seemed to be a very uncommon\nand precious piece of jewelry; it was made of pure gold, minutely chased\nand threaded with curious workmanship, in form like a melon, and bearing\nwhat seemed to be characters of some foreign language: there might be\na spell, or even witchcraft, in it, and the sooner it was out of her\nkeeping the better. Nevertheless she took very good care of it, wrapping\nit in lamb's-wool, and peeping at it many times a day, to be sure that\nit was safe, until it made her think of the owner so much, and the many\nwonders she had heard about him, that she grew quite angry with herself\nand it, and locked it away, and then looked at it again.\n\nAs luck would have it, on the very day when Mary was to stroll down\nBempton Lane (not to meet any one, of course, but simply for the merest\nchance of what might happen), her father had business at Driffield corn\nmarket, which would keep him from home nearly all the day. When his\ndaughter heard of it she was much cast down; for she hoped that he\nmight have been looking about on the northern part of the farm, as he\ngenerally was in the afternoon; and although he could not see Bempton\nLane at all, perhaps, without some newly acquired power of seeing round\nsharp corners, still it would have been a comfort and a strong resource\nfor conscience to have felt that he was not so very far away. And this\nfeeling of want made his daughter resolve to have some one at any\nrate near her. If Jack had only been at home, she need have sought no\nfurther, for he would have entered into all her thoughts about it, and\nobeyed her orders beautifully. But Willie was quite different, and hated\nany trouble, being spoiled so by his mother and the maidens all around\nthem.\n\nHowever, in such a strait, what was there to do but to trust in Willie,\nwho was old enough, being five years in front of Mary, and then to try\nto make him sensible? Willie Anerley had no idea that anybody--far less\nhis own sister--could take such a view of him. He knew himself to be,\nand all would say the same of him, superior in his original gifts,\nand his manner of making use of them, to the rest of the family put\ntogether. He had spent a month in Glasgow, when the whole place was\nastir with the ferment of many great inventions, and another month in\nEdinburgh, when that noble city was aglow with the dawn of large ideas;\nalso, he had visited London, foremost of his family, and seen enough new\nthings there to fill all Yorkshire with surprise; and the result of such\nwide experience was that he did not like hard work at all. Neither could\nhe even be content to accept and enjoy, without labor of his own, the\nmany good things provided for him. He was always trying to discover\nsomething which never seemed to answer, and continually flying after\nsomething new, of which he never got fast hold. In a word, he was\nspoiled, by nature first, and then by circumstances, for the peaceful\nlife of his ancestors, and the unacknowledged blessings of a farmer.\n\n\"Willie dear, will you come with me?\" Mary said to him that day,\ncatching him as he ran down stairs to air some inspiration. \"Will you\ncome with me for just one hour? I wish you would; and I would be so\nthankful.\"\n\n\"Child, it is quite impossible,\" he answered, with a frown which set off\nhis delicate eyebrows and high but rather narrow forehead; \"you always\nwant me at the very moment when I have the most important work in hand.\nAny childish whim of yours matters more than hours and hours of hard\nlabor.\"\n\n\"Oh, Willie, but you know how I try to help you, and all the patterns\nI cut out last week! Do come for once, Willie; if you refuse, you will\nnever, never forgive yourself.\"\n\nWillie Anerley was as good-natured as any self-indulged youth can be; he\nloved his sister in his way, and was indebted to her for getting out of\na great many little scrapes. He saw how much she was in earnest now, and\nfelt some desire to know what it was about. Moreover--which settled\nthe point--he was getting tired of sticking to one thing for a time\nunusually long with him. But he would not throw away the chance of\nscoring a huge debt of gratitude.\n\n\"Well, do what you like with me,\" he answered, with a smile; \"I never\ncan have my own way five minutes. It serves me quite right for being so\ngood-natured.\"\n\nMary gave him a kiss, which must have been an object of ambition to\nanybody else; but it only made him wipe his mouth; and presently the two\nset forth upon the path toward Bempton.\n\nRobin Lyth had chosen well his place for meeting Mary. The lane (of\nwhich he knew every yard as well as he knew the rocks themselves)\nwas deep and winding, and fringed with bushes, so that an active and\nkeen-eyed man might leap into thicket almost before there was a fair\nchance of shooting him. He knew well enough that he might trust Mary;\nbut he never could be sure that the bold \"coast-riders,\" despairing by\nthis time of catching him at sea, and longing for the weight of gold\nput upon his head, might not be setting privy snares to catch him in his\nwalks abroad. They had done so when they pursued him up the Dike; and\nthough he was inclined to doubt the strict legality of that proceeding,\nhe could not see his way to a fair discussion of it, in case of their\nputting a bullet through him. And this consideration made him careful.\n\nThe brother and sister went on well by the foot-path over the uplands of\nthe farm, and crossing the neck of the Flamburn peninsula, tripped away\nmerrily northward. The wheat looked healthy, and the barley also, and a\nfour-acre patch of potatoes smelled sweetly (for the breeze of them was\npleasant in their wholesome days), and Willie, having overworked his\nbrain, according to his own account of it, strode along loftily before\nhis sister, casting over his shoulder an eddy of some large ideas with\nwhich he had been visited before she interrupted him. But as nothing\never came of them, they need not here be stated. From a practical point\nof view, however, as they both had to live upon the profits of the farm,\nit pleased them to observe what a difference there was when they had\nsurmounted the chine and began to descend toward the north upon other\npeople's land. Here all was damp and cold and slow; and chalk looked\nslimy instead of being clean; and shadowy places had an oozy cast; and\ntrees (wherever they could stand) were facing the east with wrinkled\nvisage, and the west with wiry beards. Willie (who had, among other\ngreat inventions, a scheme for improvement of the climate) was reminded\nat once of all the things he meant to do in that way; and making, as he\nalways did, a great point of getting observations first--a point whereon\nhe stuck fast mainly--without any time for delay he applied himself to a\nrapid study of the subject. He found some things just like other things\nwhich he had seen in Scotland, yet differing so as to prove, more\nclearly than even their resemblance did, the value of his discovery.\n\n\"Look!\" he cried; \"can anything be clearer? The cause of all these evils\nis not (as an ignorant person might suppose) the want of sunshine, or\ntoo much wet, but an inadequate movement of the air--\"\n\n\"Why, I thought it was always blowing up here. The very last time I\ncame, my bonnet strings were split.\"\n\n\"You do not understand me; you never do. When I say inadequate, I mean,\nof course, incorrect, inaccurate, unequable. Now the air is a fluid; you\nmay stare as you like, Mary, but the air has been proved to be a\nfluid. Very well; no fluid in large bodies moves with an equal velocity\nthroughout. Part of it is rapid and part quite stagnant. The stagnant\nplaces of the air produce this green scum, this mossy, unwholesome, and\ninjurious stuff; while the overrapid motion causes this iron appearance,\nthis hard surface, and general sterility. By the simplest of simple\ncontrivances, I make this evil its own remedy. An equable impulse given\nto the air produces an adequate uniform flow, preventing stagnation in\none place, and excessive vehemence in another. And the beauty of it is\nthat by my new invention I make the air itself correct and regulate its\nown inequalities.\"\n\n\"How clever you are, to be sure!\" exclaimed Mary, wondering that her\nfather could not see it. \"Oh, Willie, you will make your fortune by it!\nHowever do you do it?\"\n\n\"The simplicity of it is such that even you can understand it. All\ngreat discoveries are simple. I fix in a prominent situation a large\nand vertically revolving fan, of a light and vibrating substance. The\nmovement of the air causes this to rotate by the mere force of the\nimpact. The rotation and the vibration of the fan convert an irregular\nimpulse into a steady and equable undulation; and such is the elasticity\nof the fluid called, in popular language, 'the air,' that for miles\naround the rotation of this fan regulates the circulation, modifies\nextremes, annihilates sterility, and makes it quite impossible for moss\nand green scum and all this sour growth to live. Even you can see, Mary,\nhow beautiful it is.\"\n\n\"Yes, that I can,\" she answered, simply, as they turned the corner upon\na large windmill, with arms revolving merrily; \"but, Willie dear, would\nnot Farmer Topping's mill, perpetually going as it is, answer the same\npurpose? And yet the moss seems to be as thick as ever here, and the\nground as naked.\"\n\n\"Tush!\" cried Willie. \"Stuff and nonsense! When will you girls\nunderstand? Good-by! I will throw away no more time on you.\"\n\nWithout stopping to finish his sentence he was off and out of sight\nboth of the mill and Mary, before the poor girl, who had not the least\nintention of offending him, could even beg his pardon, or say how much\nshe wanted him; for she had not dared as yet to tell him what was the\npurpose of her walk, his nature being such that no one, not even his own\nmother, could tell what conclusion he might come to upon any practical\nquestion. He might rush off at once to put the revenue men on the\nsmuggler's track, or he might stop his sister from going, or he might\n(in the absence of his father) order a feast to be prepared, and fetch\nthe outlaw to be his guest. So Mary had resolved not to tell him until\nthe last moment, when he could do none of these things.\n\nBut now she must either go on all alone, or give up her purpose and\nbreak her promise. After some hesitation she determined to go on, for\nthe place would scarcely seem so very lonely now with the windmill\nin view, which would always remind her henceforth of her dear brother\nWilliam. It was perfectly certain that Captain Robert Lyth, whose fame\nfor chivalry was everywhere, and whose character was all in all to him\nwith the ladies who bought his silks and lace, would see her through all\ndanger caused by confidence in him; and really it was too bad of her\nto admit any paltry misgivings. But reason as she might, her young\nconscience told her that this was not the proper thing to do, and she\nmade up her mind not to do it again. Then she laughed at the notion of\nbeing ever even asked, and told herself that she was too conceited; and\nto cut the matter short, went very bravely down the hill.\n\nThe lane, which came winding from the beach up to the windmill, was as\npretty a lane as may anywhere be found in any other county than that of\nDevon. With a Devonshire lane it could not presume to vie, having little\nof the glorious garniture of fern, and nothing of the crystal brook that\nleaps at every corner; no arches of tall ash, keyed with dog-rose, and\nnot much of honeysuckle, and a sight of other wants which people feel\nwho have lived in the plenitude of everything. But in spite of all that,\nthe lane was very fine for Yorkshire.\n\nOn the other hand, Mary had prettier ankles, and a more graceful and\nlighter walk, than the Devonshire lanes, which like to echo something,\nfor the most part seem accustomed to; and the short dress of the time\nmade good such favorable facts when found. Nor was this all that could\nbe said, for the maiden (while her mother was so busy pickling cabbage,\nfrom which she drove all intruders) had managed to forget what the day\nof the week was, and had opened the drawer that should be locked\nup until Sunday. To walk with such a handsome tall fellow as Willie\ncompelled her to look like something too, and without any thought of it\nshe put her best hat on, and a very pretty thing with some French name,\nand made of a delicate peach-colored silk, which came down over her\nbosom, and tied in the neatest of knots at the small of her back, which\nat that time of life was very small. All these were the gifts of her\ndear uncle Popplewell, upon the other side of Filey, who might have been\nmarried for forty years, but nobody knew how long it was, because he had\nno children, and so he made Mary his darling. And this ancient gentleman\nhad leanings toward free trade.\n\nWhether these goods were French or not--which no decent person could\nthink of asking--no French damsel could have put them on better, or\nshown a more pleasing appearance in them; for Mary's desire was to\nplease all people who meant no harm to her--as nobody could--and yet\nto let them know that her object was only to do what was right, and to\nnever think of asking whether she looked this, that, or the other. Her\nmother, as a matter of duty, told her how plain she was almost every\nday; but the girl was not of that opinion; and when Mrs. Anerley\nfinished her lecture (as she did nine times in ten) by turning the glass\nto the wall, and declaring that beauty was a snare skin-deep, with a\nfrown of warning instead of a smile of comfort, then Mary believed in\nher looking-glass again, and had the smile of comfort on her own face.\n\nHowever, she never thought of that just now, but only of how she could\ndo her duty, and have no trouble in her own mind with thinking, and\nsatisfy her father when she told him all, as she meant to do, when there\ncould be no harm done to any one; and this, as she heartily hoped, would\nbe to-morrow. And truly, if there did exist any vanity at all, it was\nnot confined to the sex in which it is so much more natural and comely.\n\nFor when a very active figure came to light suddenly, at a little elbow\nof the lane, and with quick steps advanced toward Mary, she was lost\nin surprise at the gayety, not to say grandeur, of its apparel. A\nbroad hat, looped at the side, and having a pointed black crown, with a\nscarlet feather and a dove-colored brim, sat well upon the mass of crisp\nblack curls. A short blue jacket of the finest Flemish cloth, and set\n(not too thickly) with embossed silver buttons, left properly open the\nstrong brown neck, while a shirt of pale blue silk, with a turned-down\ncollar of fine needle-work, fitted, without a wrinkle or a pucker, the\nbroad and amply rounded chest. Then a belt of brown leather, with an\nanchor clasp, and empty loops for either fire-arm or steel, supported\ntrue sailor's trousers of the purest white and the noblest man-of-war\ncut; and where these widened at the instep shone a lovely pair of pumps,\nwith buckles radiant of best Bristol diamonds. The wearer of all these\nsplendors smiled, and seemed to become them as they became him.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Mary, \"how free trade must pay! What a pity that he is\nnot in the Royal Navy!\"\n\nWith his usual quickness, and the self-esteem which added such lustre to\nhis character, the smuggler perceived what was passing in her mind, but\nhe was not rude enough to say so.\n\n\"Young lady,\" he began--and Mary, with all her wisdom, could not help\nbeing fond of that--\"young lady, I was quite sure that you would keep\nyour word.\"\n\n\"I never do anything else,\" she answered, showing that she scarcely\nlooked at him. \"I have found this for you, and then good-by.\"\n\n\"Surely you will wait to hear my thanks, and to know what made me dare\nto ask you, after all you had done for me already, to begin again for\nme. But I am such an outcast that I never should have done it.\"\n\n\"I never saw any one look more thoroughly unlike an outcast,\" Mary said;\nand then she was angry with herself for speaking, and glancing, and,\nworst of all, for smiling,\n\n\"Ladies who live on land can never understand what we go through,\" Robin\nreplied, in his softest voice, as rich as the murmur of the summer sea.\n\"When we expect great honors, we try to look a little tidy, as any one\nbut a common boor would do; and we laugh at ourselves for trying to look\nwell, after all the knocking about we get. Our time is short--we must\nmake the most of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, please not to talk in such a dreadful way,\" said Mary.\n\n\"You remind me of my dear friend Dr. Upround--the very best man in the\nwhole world, I believe. He always says to me, 'Robin, Robin--'\"\n\n\"What! is Dr. Upandown a friend of yours?\" Mary exclaimed, in amazement,\nand with a stoppage of the foot that was poised for quick departure.\n\n\"Dr. Upandown, as many people call him,\" said the smuggler, with a tone\nof condemnation, \"is the best and dearest friend I have, next to Captain\nand Mistress Cockscroft, who may have been heard of at Anerley Manor.\nDr. Upround is our magistrate and clergyman, and he lets people say what\nthey like against me, while he honors me with his friendship. I must not\nstay long to thank you even, because I am going to the dear old doctor's\nfor supper at seven o'clock and a game of chess.\"\n\n\"Oh dear! oh dear! And he is such a Justice! And yet they shot at you\nlast week! It makes me wonder when I hear such things.\"\n\n\"Young lady, it makes everybody wonder. In my opinion there never could\nbe a more shameful murder than to shoot me; and yet but for you it would\nsurely have been done.\"\n\n\"You must not dwell upon such things,\" said Mary; \"they may have a very\nbad effect upon your mind. But good-by, Captain Lyth; I forgot that I\nwas robbing Dr. Upround of your society.\"\n\n\"Shall I be so ungrateful as not to see you safe upon your own land\nafter all your trouble? My road to Flamborough lies that way. Surely you\nwill not refuse to hear what made me so anxious about this bauble,\nwhich now will be worth ten times as much. I never saw it look so bright\nbefore.\"\n\n\"It--it must be the sand has made it shine,\" the maiden stammered, with\na fine bright blush; \"it does the same to my shrimping net.\"\n\n\"Ah, shrimping is a very fine pursuit! There is nothing I love better;\nwhat pools I could show you, if I only might; pools where you may fill\na sack with large prawns in a single tide--pools known to nobody but\nmyself. When do you think of going shrimping next?\"\n\n\"Perhaps next summer I may try again, if Captain Carroway will come with\nme.\"\n\n\"That is too unkind of you. How very harsh you are to me! I could hardly\nhave believed it after all that you have done. And you really do not\ncare to hear the story of this relic?\"\n\n\"If I could stop, I should like it very much. But my brother, who came\nwith me, may perhaps be waiting for me.\" Mary knew that this was not\nvery likely; still, it was just possible, for Willie's ill tempers\nseldom lasted very long; and she wanted to let the smuggler know that\nshe had not come all alone to meet him.\n\n\"I shall not be two minutes,\" Robin Lyth replied; \"I have been forced to\nlearn short talking. May I tell you about this trinket?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you will only begin at once, and finish by the time we get to\nthat corner.\"\n\n\"That is very short measure for a tale,\" said Robin, though he liked\nher all the better for such qualities; \"however, I will try; only walk\na little slower. Nobody knows where I was born, any more than they know\nhow or why. Only when I came upon this coast as a very little boy, and\nwithout knowing anything about it, they say that I had very wonderful\nbuttons of gold upon a linen dress, adorned with gold-lace, which I used\nto wear on Sundays. Dr. Upround ordered them to keep those buttons, and\nwas to have had them in his own care; but before that, all of them were\nlost save two. My parents, as I call them from their wonderful goodness,\nkinder than the ones who have turned me on the world (unless themselves\nwent out of it), resolved to have my white coat done up grandly, when\nI grew too big for it, and to lay it by in lavender; and knowing of a\ngreat man in the gold-lace trade, as far away as Scarborough, they sent\nit by a fishing-smack to him, with people whom they knew thoroughly.\nThat was the last of it ever known here. The man swore a manifest that\nhe never saw it, and threatened them with libel; and the smack was\ncondemned, and all her hands impressed, because of some trifle she\nhappened to carry; and nobody knows any more of it. But two of the\nbuttons had fallen off, and good mother had put them by, to give a last\nfinish to the coat herself; and when I grew up, and had to go to sea\nat night, they were turned into a pair of ear-rings. There, now, Miss\nAnerley, I have not been long, and you know all about it.\"\n\n\"How very lonesome it must be for you,\" said Mary, with a gentle gaze,\nwhich, coming from such lovely eyes, went straight into his heart, \"to\nhave no one belonging to you by right, and to seem to belong to nobody!\nI am sure I can not tell whatever I should do without any father, or\nmother, or uncle, or even a cousin to be certain of.\"\n\n\"All the ladies seem to think that it is rather hard upon me,\" Robin\nanswered, with an excellent effort at a sigh; \"but I do my very best\nto get on without them. And one thing that helps me most of all is when\nkind ladies, who have good hearts, allow me to talk to them as if I had\na sister. This makes me forget what I am sometimes.\"\n\n\"You never should try to forget what you are. Everybody in the world\nspeaks well of you. Even that cruel Lieutenant Carroway can not help\nadmiring you. And if you have taken to free trade, what else could you\ndo, when you had no friends, and even your coat was stolen?\"\n\n\"High-minded people take that view of it, I know. But I do not pretend\nto any such excuse. I took to free trade for the sake of my friends--to\nsupport the old couple who have been so good to me.\"\n\n\"That is better still; it shows such good principle. My uncle Popplewell\nhas studied the subject of what they call 'political economy,' and he\nsays that the country requires free trade, and the only way to get it is\nto go on so that the government must give way at last. However, I need\nnot instruct you about that; and you must not stop any longer.\"\n\n\"Miss Anerley, I will not encroach upon your kindness. You have said\nthings that I never shall forget. On the Continent I meet very many\nladies who tell me good things, and make me better; but not at all as\nyou have done. A minute of talk with you is worth an hour with anybody\nelse. But I fear that you laugh at me all the while, and are only too\nglad to be rid of me. Good-by. May I kiss your hand? God bless you!\"\n\nMary had no time to say a single word, or even to express her ideas by\na look, before Robin Lyth, with all his bright apparel, was \"conspicuous\nby his absence.\" As a diving bird disappears from a gun, or a trout from\na shadow on his hover, or even a debtor from his creditor, so the great\nfree-trader had vanished into lightsome air, and left emptiness behind\nhim.\n\nThe young maid, having been prepared to yield him a few yards more of\ngood advice, if he held out for another corner, now could only say to\nherself that she never had met such a wonderful man. So active, strong,\nand astonishingly brave; so thoroughly acquainted with foreign lands,\nyet superior to their ladies; so able to see all the meaning of good\nwords, and to value them when offered quietly; so sweet in his manner,\nand voice, and looks; and with all his fame so unpretending, and--much\nas it frightened her to think it--really seeming to be afraid of her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nGRUMBLING AND GROWLING\n\n\nWhile these successful runs went on, and great authorities smiled at\nseeing the little authorities set at naught, and men of the revenue\nsmote their breasts for not being born good smugglers, and the general\npublic was well pleased, and congratulated them cordially upon their\naccomplishment of naught, one man there was whose noble spirit chafed\nand knew no comfort. He strode up and down at Coast-guard Point, and\ncommuned with himself, while Robin held sweet converse in the lane.\n\n\"Why was I born?\" the sad Carroway cried; \"why was I thoroughly\neducated and trained in both services of the king, expected to rise, and\nbeginning to rise, till a vile bit of splinter stopped me, and then sent\ndown to this hole of a place to starve, and be laughed at, and baffled\nby a boy? Another lucky run, and the revenue bamboozled, and the whole\nof us sent upon a wild-goose chase! Every gapper-mouth zany grinning\nat me, and scoundrels swearing that I get my share! And the only time I\nhave had my dinner with my knees crook'd, for at least a fortnight, was\nat Anerley Farm on Sunday. I am not sure that even they wouldn't turn\nagainst me; I am certain that pretty girl would. I've a great mind to\nthrow it up--a great mind to throw it up. It is hardly the work for\na gentleman born, and the grandson of a rear-admiral. Tinkers' and\ntailors' sons get the luck now; and a man of good blood is put on the\nback shelf, behind the blacking-bottles. A man who has battled for his\ncountry--\"\n\n\"Charles, are you coming to your dinner, once more?\"\n\n\"No, I am not. There's no dinner worth coming to. You and the children\nmay eat the rat pie. A man who has battled for his country, and bled\ntill all his veins were empty, and it took two men to hold him up,\nand yet waved his Sword at the head of them--it is the downright\ncontradiction of the world in everything for him to poke about with pots\nand tubs, like a pig in a brewery, grain-hunting.\"\n\n\"Once more, Charles, there is next to nothing left. The children are\neating for their very lives. If you stay out there another minute, you\nmust take the consequence.\"\n\n\"Alas, that I should have so much stomach, and so little to put into it!\nMy dear, put a little bit under a basin, if any of them has no appetite.\nI wanted just to think a little.\"\n\n\"Charles, they have all got tremendous appetites. It is the way the wind\nis. You may think by-and-by, but if you want to eat, you must do it now,\nor never.\"\n\n\"'Never' never suits me in that matter,\" the brave lieutenant answered.\n\"Matilda, put Geraldine to warm the pewter plate for me. Geraldine\ndarling, you can do it with your mouth full.\"\n\nThe commander of the coast-guard turned abruptly from his long indignant\nstride, and entered the cottage provided for him, and which he had\npeopled so speedily.\n\nSmall as it was, it looked beautifully clean and neat, and everybody\nused to wonder how Mrs. Carroway kept it so. But in spite of all her\ntroubles and many complaints, she was very proud of this little house,\nwith its healthful position and beautiful outlook over the bay of\nBridlington. It stood in a niche of the low soft cliff, where now the\nsea-parade extends from the northern pier of Bridlington Quay; and when\nthe roadstead between that and the point was filled with a fleet of\nevery kind of craft, or, better still, when they all made sail at\nonce--as happened when a trusty breeze arose--the view was lively, and\nvery pleasant, and full of moving interest. Often one of his Majesty's\ncutters, Swordfish, Kestrel, or Albatross, would swoop in with all\nsail set, and hover, while the skipper came ashore to see the \"Ancient\nCarroway,\" as this vigilant officer was called; and sometimes even\na sloop of war, armed brigantine, or light corvette, prowling for\nrecruits, or cruising for their training, would run in under the Head,\nand overhaul every wind-bound ship with a very high hand.\n\n\"Ancient Carroway\"--as old friends called him, and even young people\nwho had never seen him--was famous upon this coast now for nearly\nthree degrees of latitude. He had dwelled here long, and in highly\ngood content, hospitably treated by his neighbors, and himself more\nhospitable than his wife could wish, until two troubles in his life\narose, and from year to year grew worse and worse. One of these troubles\nwas the growth of mouths in number and size, that required to be filled;\nand the other trouble was the rampant growth of smuggling, and the glory\nof that upstart Robin Lyth. Now let it be lawful to take that subject\nfirst.\n\nFair Robin, though not at all anxious for fame, but modestly willing\nto decline it, had not been successful--though he worked so much by\nnight--in preserving sweet obscurity. His character was public, and set\non high by fortune, to be gazed at from wholly different points of view.\nFrom their narrow and lime-eyed outlook the coast-guard beheld in\nhim the latest incarnation of Old Nick; yet they hated him only in an\nabstract manner, and as men feel toward that evil one. Magistrates also,\nand the large protective powers, were arrayed against him, yet happy to\nabstain from laying hands, when their hands were their own, upon him.\nAnd many of the farmers, who should have been his warmest friends and\nbest customers, were now so attached to their king and country, by\nbellicose warmth and army contracts, that instead of a guinea for a\nfour-gallon anker, they would offer three crowns, or the exciseman.\nAnd not only conscience, but short cash, after three bad harvests,\nconstrained them.\n\nYet the staple of public opinion was sound, as it must be where women\npredominate. The best of women could not see why they should not have\nanything they wanted for less than it cost the maker. To gaze at a\nsister woman better dressed at half the money was simply to abjure every\nlofty principle. And to go to church with a counterfeit on, when the\ngenuine lace was in the next pew on a body of inferior standing, was a\ndownright outrage to the congregation, the rector, and all religion. A\ncold-blooded creature, with no pin-money, might reconcile it with her\nprinciples, if any she had, to stand up like a dowdy and allow a poor\nman to risk his life by shot and storm and starvation, and then to deny\nhim a word or a look, because of his coming with the genuine thing at\na quarter the price fat tradesmen asked, who never stirred out of their\nshops when it rained, for a thing that was a story and an imposition.\nCharity, duty, and common honesty to their good husbands in these bad\ntimes compelled them to make the very best of bargains; of which they\ngot really more and more, as those brave mariners themselves bore\nwitness, because of the depression in the free trade now and the\nglorious victories of England. Were they bound to pay three times the\ngenuine value, and then look a figure, and be laughed at?\n\nAnd as for Captain Carroway, let him scold, and threaten, and stride\nabout, and be jealous, because his wife dare not buy true things, poor\ncreature--although there were two stories also about that, and the\nquantities of things that he got for nothing, whenever he was clever\nenough to catch them, which scarcely ever happened, thank goodness! Let\nCaptain Carroway attend to his own business; unless he was much belied,\nhe had a wife who would keep him to it. Who was Captain Carroway to come\ndown here, without even being born in Yorkshire, and lay down the law,\nas if he owned the manor?\n\nLieutenant Carroway had heard such questions, but disdained to answer\nthem. He knew who he was, and what his grandfather had been, and he\nnever cared a--short word--what sort of stuff long tongues might prate\nof him. Barbarous broad-drawlers, murderers of his Majesty's English,\ncould they even pronounce the name of an officer highly distinguished\nfor many years in both of the royal services? That was his description,\nand the Yorkshire yokels might go and read it--if read they could--in\nthe pages of authority.\n\nLike the celebrated calf that sucked two cows, Carroway had drawn royal\npay, though in very small drains, upon either element, beginning with a\nskeleton regiment, and then, when he became too hot for it, diving off\ninto a frigate as a recommended volunteer. Here he was more at home,\nthough he never ceased longing to be a general; and having the credit\nof fighting well ashore, he was looked at with interest when he fought a\nfight at sea. He fought it uncommonly well, and it was good, and so many\nmen fell that he picked up his commission, and got into a fifty-two-gun\nship. After several years of service, without promotion--for his\ngrandfather's name was worn out now, and the wars were not properly\nconstant--there came a very lively succession of fights, and Carroway\ngot into all of them, or at least into all the best of them. And he\nought to have gone up much faster than he did, and he must have done so\nbut for his long lean jaws, the which are the worst things that any man\ncan have. Not only because of their own consumption and slow length\nof leverage, but mainly on account of the sadness they impart, and the\ntimid recollection of a hungry wolf, to the man who might have lifted up\na fatter individual.\n\nBut in Rodney's great encounter with the Spanish fleet, Carroway\nshowed such a dauntless spirit, and received such a wound, that it was\nimpossible not to pay him some attention. His name was near the bottom\nof a very long list, but it made a mark on some one's memory, depositing\na chance of coming up some day, when he should be reported hit again.\nAnd so good was his luck that he soon was hit again, and a very bad\nhit it was; but still he got over it without promotion, because that\nenterprise was one in which nearly all our men ran away, and therefore\nrequired to be well pushed up for the sake of the national honor. When\nsuch things happen, the few who stay behind must be left behind in the\nGazette as well. That wound, therefore, seemed at first to go against\nhim, but he bandaged it, and plastered it, and hoped for better luck.\nAnd his third wound truly was a blessed one, a slight one, and taken in\nthe proper course of things, without a slur upon any of his comrades.\nThis set him up again with advancement and appointment, and enabled him\nto marry and have children seven.\n\nThe lieutenant was now about fifty years of age, gallant and lively as\never, and resolute to attend to his duty and himself as well. His duty\nwas now along shore, in command of the Coast-guard of the East District;\nfor the loss of a good deal of one heel made it hard for him to step\nabout as he should do when afloat. The place suited him, and he was fond\nof it, although he grumbled sometimes about his grandfather, and went\non as if his office was beneath him. He abused all his men, and all the\ngood ones liked him, and respected him for his clear English. And he\nenjoyed this free exercise of language out-of-doors, because inside his\nthreshold he was on his P's and Q's. To call him \"ugly Carroway,\" as\ncoarse people did, because of a scar across his long bold nose, was\npetty and unjust, and directly contradicted by his own and his wife's\nopinion. For nobody could have brighter eyes, or a kindlier smile, and\nmore open aspect in the forepart of the week, while his Sunday shave\nretained its influence, so far as its limited area went, for he kept a\nlong beard always. By Wednesday he certainly began to look grim, and on\nSaturday ferocious, pending the advent of the Bridlington barber, who\nshaved all the Quay every Sunday. But his mind was none the worse, and\nhis daughters liked him better when he rasped their young cheeks with\nhis beard, and paid a penny. For to his children he was a loving and\ntender-hearted father, puzzled at their number, and sometimes perplexed\nat having to feed and clothe them, yet happy to give them his last and\ngo without, and even ready to welcome more, if Heaven should be pleased\nto send them.\n\nBut Mrs. Carroway, most fidgety of women, and born of a well-shorn\nfamily, was unhappy from the middle to the end of the week that she\ncould not scrub her husband's beard off. The lady's sense of human\ncrime, and of everything hateful in creation, expressed itself mainly in\nthe word \"dirt.\" Her rancor against that nobly tranquil and most natural\nof elements inured itself into a downright passion. From babyhood she\nhad been notorious for kicking her little legs out at the least speck\nof dust upon a tiny red shoe. Her father--a clergyman--heard so much of\nthis, and had so many children of a different stamp, that when he came\nto christen her, at six months of age (which used to be considered quite\nan early time of life), he put upon her the name of \"Lauta,\" to which\nshe thoroughly acted up; but people having ignorance of foreign tongues\nsaid that he always meant \"Matilda.\"\n\nSuch was her nature, and it grew upon her; so that when a young and\ngallant officer, tall and fresh, and as clean as a frigate, was captured\nby her neat bright eyes, very clean run, and sharp cut-water, she began\nto like to look at him. Before very long, his spruce trim ducks, careful\nscrape of Brunswick-leather boots, clean pocket-handkerchiefs, and\nfine specklessness, were making and keeping a well-swept path to the\nthoroughly dusted store-room of her heart. How little she dreamed, in\nthose virgin days, that the future could ever contain a week when her\nCharles would decline to shave more than once, and then have it done for\nhim on a Sunday!\n\nShe hesitated, for she had her thoughts--doubts she disdained to call\nthem--but still he forgot once to draw his boots sideways, after having\npurged the toe and heel, across the bristle of her father's mat. With\nthe quick eye of love he perceived her frown, and the very next day he\nconquered her. His scheme was unworthy, as it substituted corporate for\npersonal purity; still it succeeded, as unworthy schemes will do. On the\nbirthday of his sacred Majesty, Charles took Matilda to see his ship,\nthe 48-gun frigate Immaculate, commanded by a well-known martinet. Her\nspirit fell within her, like the Queen of Sheba's, as she gazed, but\ntrembled to set down foot upon the trim order and the dazzling choring.\nShe might have survived the strict purity of all things, the deck lines\nwhiter than Parian marble, the bulwarks brighter than the cheek-piece of\na grate, the breeches of the guns like goodly gold, and not a whisker\nof a rope's end curling the wrong way, if only she could have espied a\nswab, or a bucket, or a flake of holy-stone, or any indicament of labor\ndone. \"Artis est celare artem;\" this art was unfathomable.\n\nMatilda was fain to assure herself that the main part of this might be\nsuperficial, like a dish-cover polished with the spots on, and she lost\nher handkerchief on purpose to come back and try a little test-work\nof her own. This was a piece of unstopped knotting in the panel of a\nhatchway, a resinous hole that must catch and keep any speck of dust\nmeandering on the wayward will of wind. Her cambric came out as white as\nit went in!\n\nShe surrendered at discretion, and became the prize of Carroway.\n\nNow people at Bridlington Quay declared that the lieutenant, though he\nmight have carried off a prize, was certainly not the prize-master; and\nthey even went so far as to say that \"he could scarcely call his soul\nhis own.\" The matter was no concern of theirs, neither were their\nconclusions true. In little things the gallant officer, for the sake of\ndiscipline and peace, submitted to due authority; and being so much from\nhome, he left all household matters to a firm control. In return for\nthis, he was always thought of first, and the best of everything was\nkept for him, and Mrs. Carroway quoted him to others as a wonder, though\nshe may not have done so to himself. And so, upon the whole, they got on\nvery well together.\n\nNow on this day, when the lieutenant had exhausted a grumble of unusual\nintensity, and the fair Geraldine (his eldest child) had obeyed him to\nthe letter, by keeping her mouth full while she warmed a plate for him,\nit was not long before his usual luck befell the bold Carroway. Rap,\nrap, came a knock at the side door of his cottage--a knock only too\nfamiliar; and he heard the gruff voice of Cadman--\"Can I see his honor\nimmediately?\"\n\n\"No, you can not,\" replied Mrs. Carroway. \"One would think you were all\nin a league to starve him. No sooner does he get half a mouthful--\"\n\n\"Geraldine, put it on the hob, my dear, and a basin over it. Matilda, my\nlove, you know my maxim--'Duty first, dinner afterward.' Cadman, I will\ncome with you.\"\n\nThe revenue officer took up his hat (which had less time now than his\ndinner to get cold) and followed Cadman to the usual place for holding\nprivy councils. This was under the heel of the pier (which was then\nabout half as long as now) at a spot where the outer wall combed over,\nto break the crest of the surges in the height of a heavy eastern gale.\nAt neap tides, and in moderate weather, this place was dry, with a fine\nsalt smell; and with nothing in front of it but the sea, and nothing\nbehind it but solid stone wall, any one would think that here must be\ncommune sacred, secret, and secluded from eavesdroppers. And yet it was\nnot so, by reason of a very simple reason.\n\nUpon the roadway of the pier, and over against a mooring-post, where the\nparapet and the pier itself made a needful turn toward the south, there\nwas an equally needful thing, a gully-hole with an iron trap to carry\noff the rain that fell, or the spray that broke upon the fabric; and the\noutlet of this gully was in the face of the masonry outside. Carroway,\nnot being gifted with a crooked mind, had never dreamed that this little\ngut might conduct the pulses of the air, like the Tyrant's Ear, and\nthat the trap at the end might be a trap for him. Yet so it was; and by\ngently raising the movable iron frame at the top, a well-disposed person\nmight hear every word that was spoken in the snug recess below. Cadman\nwas well aware of this little fact, but left his commander to find it\nout.\n\nThe officer, always thinly clad (both through the state of his wardrobe\nand his dread of effeminate comfort), settled his bony shoulders\nagainst the rough stonework, and his heels upon a groyne, and gave his\nsubordinate a nod, which meant, \"Make no fuss, but out with it.\" Cadman,\na short square fellow with crafty eyes, began to do so.\n\n\"Captain, I have hit it off at last. Hackerbody put me wrong last time,\nthrough the wench he hath a hankering after. This time I got it, and no\nmistake, as right as if the villain lay asleep 'twixt you and me, and\ntold us all about it with his tongue out; and a good thing for men of\nlarge families like me.\"\n\n\"All that I have heard such a number of times,\" his commander answered,\ncrustily, \"that I whistle, as we used to do in a dead calm, Cadman. An\nold salt like you knows how little comes of that.\"\n\n\"There I don't quite agree with your honor. I have known a hurricane\ncome from whistling. But this time there is no woman about it, and the\npenny have come down straightforrard. New moon Tuesday next, and Monday\nwe slips first into that snug little cave. He hath a' had his last good\nrun.\"\n\n\"How much is coming this time, Cadman? I am sick and tired of those\nthree caves. It is all old woman's talk of caves, while they are running\nsouth, upon the open beach.\"\n\n\"Captain, it is a big venture--the biggest of all the summer, I do\nbelieve. Two thousand pounds, if there is a penny, in it. The schooner,\nand the lugger, and the ketch, all to once, of purpose to send us\nscattering. But your honor knows what we be after most. No woman in it\nthis time, Sir. The murder has been of the women, all along. When there\nis no woman, I can see my way. We have got the right pig by the ear this\ntime.\"\n\n\"John Cadman, your manner of speech is rude. You forget that your\ncommanding officer has a wife and family, three-quarters of which are\nfemale. You will give me your information without any rude observations\nas to sex, of which you, as a married man, should be ashamed. A man and\nhis wife are one flesh, Cadman, and therefore you are a woman yourself,\nand must labor not to disgrace yourself. Now don't look amazed, but\nconsider these things. If you had not been in a flurry, like a woman,\nyou would not have spoiled my dinner so. I will meet you at the outlook\nat six o'clock. I have business on hand of importance.\"\n\nWith these words Carroway hastened home, leaving Cadman to mutter his\nwrath, and then to growl it, when his officer was out of ear-shot.\n\n\"Never a day, nor an hour a'most, without he insulteth of me. A woman,\nindeed! Well, his wife may be a man, but what call hath he to speak of\nmine so? John Cadman a woman, and one flesh with his wife! Pretty news\nthat would be for my missus!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSERIOUS CHARGES\n\n\n\"Stephen, if it was anybody else, you would listen to me in a moment,\"\nsaid Mrs. Anerley to her lord, a few days after that little interview in\nthe Bempton Lane; \"for instance, if it was poor Willie, how long would\nyou be in believing it? But because it is Mary, you say 'pooh! pooh!'\nAnd I may as well talk to the old cracked churn.\"\n\n\"First time of all my born days,\" the farmer answered, with a pleasant\nsmile, \"that ever I was resembled to a churn. But a man's wife ought to\nknow best about un.\"\n\n\"Stephen, it is not the churn--I mean you; and you never should attempt\nto ride off in that sort of way. I tell you Mary hath a mischief on her\nmind; and you never ought to bring up old churns to me. As long as I\ncan carry almost anything in mind, I have been considered to be full of\ncommon-sense. And what should I use it upon, Captain Anerley, without it\nwas my own daughter?\"\n\nThe farmer was always conquered when she called him \"Captain Anerley.\"\nHe took it to point at him as a pretender, a coxcomb fond of titles, a\nwould-be officer who took good care to hold aloof from fighting. And he\nknew in his heart that he loved to be called \"Captain Anerley\" by every\none who meant it.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, in a tone of submission, and with a look that\ngrieved her, \"the knowledge of such things is with you. I can not enter\ninto young maids' minds, any more than command a company.\"\n\n\"Stephen, you could do both, if you chose, better than ten of eleven\nwho do it. For, Stephen, you have a very tender mind, and are not at all\nlike a churn, my dear. That was my manner of speech, you ought to know,\nbecause from my youngest days I had a crowd of imagination. You remember\nthat, Stephen, don't you?\"\n\n\"I remember, Sophy, that in the old time you never resembled me to a\nchurn, let alone a cracked one. You used to christen me a pillar, and\na tree, and a rock, and a polished corner; but there, what's the odds,\nwhen a man has done his duty? The names of him makes no difference.\"\n\n\"'Twist you and me, my dear,\" she said, \"nothing can make any\ndifference. We know one another too well for that. You are all that I\never used to call you, before I knew better about you, and when I used\nto dwell upon your hair and your smile. You know what I used to say of\nthem, now, Stephen?\"\n\n\"Most complimentary--highly complimentary! Another young woman brought\nme word of it, and it made me stick firm when my mind was doubtful.\"\n\n\"And glad you ought to be that you did stick firm. And you have the Lord\nto thank for it, as well as your own sense. But no time to talk of\nour old times now. They are coming up again, with those younkers, I'm\nafraid. Willie is like a Church; and Jack--no chance of him getting the\nchance of it; but Mary, your darling of the lot, our Mary--her mind is\nunsettled, and a worry coming over her; the same as with me when I saw\nyou first.\"\n\n\"It is the Lord that directs those things,\" the farmer answered,\nsteadfastly; \"and Mary hath the sense of her mother, I believe. That it\nis maketh me so fond on her. If the young maid hath taken a fancy,\nit will pass, without a bit of substance to settle on. Why, how many\nfancies had you, Sophy, before you had the good luck to clap eyes on\nme?\"\n\n\"That is neither here nor there,\" his wife replied, audaciously; \"how\nmany times have you asked such questions, which are no concern of yours?\nYou could not expect me, before ever I saw you, not to have any eyes or\nears. I had plenty to say for myself; and I was not plain; and I acted\naccordingly.\"\n\nMaster Anerley thought about this, because he had heard it and thought\nof it many times before. He hated to think about anything new, having\nnever known any good come of it; and his thoughts would rather flow than\nfly, even in the fugitive brevity of youth. And now, in his settled way,\nhis practice was to tread thought deeper into thought, as a man in\ndeep snow keeps the track of his own boots, or as a child writes ink on\npencil in his earliest copy-books. \"You acted according,\" he said; \"and\nMary might act according to you, mother.\"\n\n\"How can you talk so, Stephen? That would be a different thing\naltogether. Young girls are not a bit like what they used to be in my\ntime. No steadiness, no diligence, no duty to their parents. Gadding\nabout is all they think of, and light-headed chatter, and saucy\nribbons.\"\n\n\"May be so with some of them. But I never see none of that in Mary.\"\n\n\"Mary is a good girl, and well brought up,\" her mother could not help\nadmitting, \"and fond of her home, and industrious. But for all that, she\nmust be looked after sharply. And who can look after a child like her\nmother? I can tell you one thing, Master Stephen: your daughter Mary\nhas more will of her own than the rest of your family all put together,\nincluding even your own good wife.\"\n\n\"Prodigious!\" cried the farmer, while he rubbed his hands and\nlaughed--\"prodigious, and a man might say impossible. A young lass like\nMary, such a coaxing little poppet, as tender as a lambkin, and as soft\nas wool!\"\n\n\"Flannel won't only run one way; no more won't Mary,\" said her mother.\n\"I know her better a long sight than you do; and I say if ever Mary\nsets her heart on any one, have him she will, be he cowboy, thief, or\nchimney-sweep. So now you know what to expect, Master Anerley.\"\n\nStephen Anerley never made light of his wife's opinions in those\nfew cases wherein they differed from his own. She agreed with him so\ngenerally that in common fairness he thought very highly of her wisdom,\nand the present subject was one upon which she had an especial right to\nbe heard.\n\n\"Sophy,\" he said, as he set up his coat to be off to a cutting of clover\non the hill--for no reaping would begin yet for another month--\"the\nthings you have said shall abide in my mind. Only you be a-watching of\nthe little wench. Harry Tanfield is the man I would choose for her of\nall others. But I never would force any husband on a lass; though stern\nwould I be to force a bad one off, or one in an unfit walk of life. No\ninkle in your mind who it is, or wouldst have told me?\"\n\n\"Well, I may, or I may not. I never like to speak promiscuous. You\nhave the first right to know what I think. But I beg you to let me be a\nwhile. Not even to you, Steve, would I say it, without more to go upon\nthan there is yet. I might do the lass a great wrong in my surmising;\nand then you would visit my mistake on me, for she is the apple of your\neye, no doubt.\"\n\n\"There is never such another maid in all York County, nor in England, to\nmy thinking.\"\n\n\"She is my daughter as well as yours, and I would be the last to make\ncheap of her. I will not say another word until I know. But if I am\nright--which the Lord forbid--we shall both be ashamed of her, Stephen.\"\n\n\"The Lord forbid! The Lord forbid! Amen. I will not hear another word.\"\nThe farmer snatched up his hat, and made off with a haste unusual for\nhim, while his wife sat down, and crossed her arms, and began to think\nrather bitterly. For, without any dream of such a possibility, she was\njealous sometimes of her own child. Presently the farmer rushed back\nagain, triumphant with a new idea. His eyes were sparkling, and his step\nfull of spring, and a brisk smile shone upon his strong and ruddy face.\n\n\"What a pair of stupes we must be to go on so!\" he cried, with a couple\nof bright guineas in his hand. \"Mary hath not had a new frock even,\ngoing on now for a year and a half. Sophy, it is enough to turn a\nmaid into thinking of any sort of mischief. Take you these and make\neverything right. I was saving them up for her birthday, but maybe\nanother will turn up by that. My dear, you take them, and never be\nafeared.\"\n\n\"Stephen, you may leave them, if you like. I shall not be in any haste\nto let them go. Either give them to the lass yourself, or leave it to me\npurely. She shall not have a sixpence, unless it is deserved.\"\n\n\"Of course I leave it in your hands, wife. I never come between you and\nyour children. But young folk go piping always after money now; and even\nour Mary might be turning sad without it.\"\n\nHe hastened off again, without hearing any more; for he knew that some\nhours of strong labor were before him, and to meet them with a heavy\nheart would be almost a new thing for him. Some time ago he had begun\nto hold the plough of heaviness, through the difficult looseness of\nWillie's staple, and the sudden maritime slope of Jack; yet he held on\nsteadily through all this, with the strength of homely courage. But if\nin the pride of his heart, his Mary, he should find no better than a\ncrooked furrow, then truly the labor of his latter days would be the\ndull round of a mill horse.\n\nNow Mary, in total ignorance of that council held concerning her, and\neven of her mother's bad suspicions, chanced to come in at the front\nporch door soon after her father set off to his meadows by way of the\nback yard. Having been hard at work among her flowers, she was come to\nget a cupful of milk for herself, and the cheery content and general\ngoodwill encouraged by the gardener's gentle craft were smiling on her\nrosy lips and sparkling in her eyes. Her dress was as plain as plain\ncould be--a lavender twill cut and fitted by herself--and there was not\nan ornament about her that came from any other hand than Nature's. But\nsimple grace of movement and light elegance of figure, fair curves of\ngentle face and loving kindness of expression, gladdened with the hope\nof youth--what did these want with smart dresses, golden brooches, and\ntwo guineas? Her mother almost thought of this when she called Mary into\nthe little parlor. And the two guineas lay upon the table.\n\n\"Mary, can you spare a little time to talk with me? You seem wonderfully\nbusy, as usual.\"\n\n\"Mother, will you never make allowance for my flowers? They depend upon\nthe weather, and they must have things accordingly.\"\n\n\"Very well; let them think about what they want next, while you sit down\na while and talk with me.\"\n\nThe girl was vexed; for to listen to a lecture, already manifest in\nher mother's eyes, was a far less agreeable job than gardening. And the\nlecture would have done as well by candle-light, which seldom can be\nsaid of any gardening. However, she took off her hat, and sat down,\nwithout the least sign of impatience, and without any token of guilt, as\nher mother saw, and yet stupidly proceeded just the same.\n\n\"Mary,\" she began, with a gaze of stern discretion, which the girl met\nsteadfastly and pleasantly, \"you know that I am your own mother, and\nbound to look after you well, while you are so very young; for though\nyou are sensible some ways, Mary, in years and in experience what are\nyou but a child? Of the traps of the world and the wickedness of people\nyou can have no knowledge. You always think the best of everybody; which\nis a very proper thing to do, and what I have always brought you up to,\nand never would dream of discouraging. And with such examples as your\nfather and your mother, you must be perverse to do otherwise. Still,\nit is my duty to warn you, Mary--and you are getting old enough to want\nit--that the world is not made up of fathers and mothers, brothers and\nsisters, and good uncles. There are always bad folk who go prowling\nabout like wolves in--wolves in--what is it--\"\n\n\"Sheep's clothing,\" the maiden suggested, with a smile, and then dropped\nher eyes maliciously.\n\n\"How dare you be pert, miss, correcting your own mother? Do I ever\ncatch you reading of your Bible? But you seem to know so much about it,\nperhaps you have met some of them?\"\n\n\"How can I tell, mother, when you won't tell me?\"\n\n\"I tell you, indeed! It is your place to tell me, I think. And what is\nmore, I insist at once upon knowing all about it. What makes you go\non in the way that you are doing? Do you take me for a drumledore,\nyou foolish child? On Tuesday afternoon I saw you sewing with a double\nthread. Your father had potato-eyes upon his plate on Sunday; and which\nway did I see you trying to hang up a dish-cover? But that is nothing;\nfifty things you go wandering about in; and always out, on some\npretense, as if the roof you were born under was not big enough for\nyou. And then your eyes--I have seen your eyes flash up, as if you were\nfighting; and the bosom of your Sunday frock was loose in church two\nbuttons; it was not hot at all to speak of, and there was a wasp next\npew. All these things make me unhappy, Mary. My darling, tell me what it\nis.\"\n\nMary listened with great amazement to this catalogue of crimes. At the\ntime of their commission she had never even thought of them, although\nshe was vexed with herself when she saw one eye--for in verity that was\nall--of a potato upon her father's plate. Now she blushed when she heard\nof the buttons of her frock--which was only done because of tightness,\nand showed how long she must have worn it; but as to the double thread,\nshe was sure that nothing of that sort could have happened.\n\n\"Why, mother dear,\" she said, quite softly, coming up in her coaxing\nway, which nobody could resist, because it was true and gentle\nlovingness, \"you know a hundred times more than I do. I have never known\nof any of the sad mistakes you speak of, except about the potato-eye,\nand then I had a round-pointed knife. But I want to make no excuses,\nmother; and there is nothing the matter with me. Tell me what you mean\nabout the wolves.\"\n\n\"My child,\" said her mother, whose face she was kissing, while they both\nwent on with talking, \"it is no good trying to get over me. Either you\nhave something on your mind, or you have not--which is it?\"\n\n\"Mother, what can I have on my mind? I have never hurt any one, and\nnever mean to do it. Every one is kind to me, and everybody likes me,\nand of course I like them all again. And I always have plenty to do, in\nand out, as you take very good care, dear mother. My father loves me,\nand so do you, a great deal more than I deserve, perhaps. I am happy\nin a Sunday frock that wants more stuff to button; and I have only one\ntrouble in all the world. When I think of the other girls I see--\"\n\n\"Never mind them, my dear. What is your one trouble?\"\n\n\"Mother, as if you could help knowing! About my dear brother Jack, of\ncourse. Jack was so wonderfully good to me! I would walk on my hands and\nknees all the way to York to get a single glimpse of him.\"\n\n\"You would never get as far as the rick-yard hedge. You children talk\nsuch nonsense. Jack ran away of his own free-will, and out of downright\ncontrariness. He has repented of it only once, I dare say, and that has\nbeen ever since he did it, and every time he thought of it. I wish\nhe was home again, with all my heart, for I can not bear to lose my\nchildren. And Jack was as good a boy as need be, when he got everything\nhis own way. Mary, is that your only trouble? Stand where I can see you\nplainly, and tell me every word the truth. Put your hair back from your\neyes now, like the catechism.\"\n\n\"If I were saying fifty catechisms, what more could I do than speak the\ntruth?\" Mary asked this with some little vexation, while she stood up\nproudly before her mother, and clasped her hands behind her back. \"I\nhave told you everything I know, except one little thing, which I am not\nsure about.\"\n\n\"What little thing, if you please? and how can you help being sure about\nit, positive as you are about everything?\"\n\n\"Mother, I mean that I have not been sure whether I ought to tell you;\nand I meant to tell my father first, when there could be no mischief.\"\n\n\"Mary, I can scarcely believe my ears. To tell your father before your\nmother, and not even him until nothing could be done to stop it, which\nyou call 'mischief!' I insist upon knowing at once what it is. I have\nfelt that you were hiding something. How very unlike you, how unlike a\nchild of mine!\"\n\n\"You need not disturb yourself, mother dear. It is nothing of any\nimportance to me, though to other people it might be. And that is the\nreason why I kept it to myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, we shall come to something by-and-by! One would really think you\nwere older than your mother. Now, miss, if you please, let us judge of\nyour discretion. What is it that you have been hiding so long?\"\n\nMary's face grew crimson now, but with anger rather than with shame; she\nhad never thought twice about Robin Lyth with anything warmer than pity,\nbut this was the very way to drive her into dwelling in a mischievous\nmanner upon him.\n\n\"What I have been hiding,\" she said, most distinctly, and steadfastly\nlooking at her mother, \"is only that I have had two talks with the great\nfree-trader Robin Lyth.\"\n\n\"That arrant smuggler! That leader of all outlaws! You have been meeting\nhim on the sly!\"\n\n\"Certainly not. But I met him once by chance; and then, as a matter of\nbusiness, I was forced to meet him again, dear mother.\"\n\n\"These things are too much for me,\" Mrs. Anerley said, decisively. \"When\nmatters have come to such a pass, I must beg your dear father to see to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Very well, mother; I would rather have it so. May I go now and make an\nend of my gardening?\"\n\n\"Certainly--as soon as you have made an end of me, as you must quite\nhave laid your plans to do. I have seen too much to be astonished any\nmore. But to think that a child of mine, my one and only daughter, who\nlooks as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, should be hand in glove\nwith the wickedest smuggler of the age, the rogue everybody shoots\nat--but can not hit him, because he was born to be hanged---the by-name,\nthe by-word, the by-blow, Robin Lyth!\" Mrs. Anerley covered her face\nwith both hands.\n\n\"How would you like your own second cousin,\" said Mary, plucking up her\nspirit, \"your own second cousin, Mistress Cockscroft, to hear you speak\nso of the man that supports them at the risk of his life, every hour of\nit? He may be doing wrong--it is not for me to say--but he does it very\nwell, and he does it nobly. And what did you show me in your drawer,\ndear mother? And what did you wear when that very cruel man, Captain\nCarroway, came here to dine on Sunday?\"\n\n\"You wicked, undutiful child! Go away! I wish to have nothing more to\nsay to you.\"\n\n\"No, I will not go away,\" cried Mary, with her resolute spirit in her\neyes and brow; \"when false and cruel charges are brought against me, I\nhave the right to speak, and I will use it. I am not hand in glove with\nRobin Lyth, or any other Robin. I think a little more of myself than\nthat. If I have done any wrong, I will meet it, and be sorry, and submit\nto any punishment. I ought to have told you before, perhaps; that is the\nworst you can say of it. But I never attached much importance to it; and\nwhen a man is hunted so, was I to join his enemies? I have only seen him\ntwice: the first time by purest accident, and the second time to give\nhim back a piece of his own property. And I took my brother with me; but\nhe ran away, as usual.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. Every one to blame but you, miss. However, we\nshall see what your father has to say. You have very nearly taken all\nmy breath away; but I shall expect the whole sky to tumble in upon us\nif Captain Anerley approves of Robin Lyth as a sweetheart for his\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"I never thought of Captain Lyth; and Captain Lyth never thought of me.\nBut I can tell you one thing, mother--if you wanted to make me think of\nhim, you could not do it better than by speaking so unjustly.\"\n\n\"After that perhaps you will go back to your flowers. I have heard that\nthey grow very fine ones in Holland. Perhaps you have got some smuggled\ntulips, my dear.\"\n\nMary did not condescend to answer, but said to herself, as she went to\nwork again, \"Tulips in August! That is like the rest of it. However, I\nam not going to be put out, when I feel that I have not done a single\nbit of harm.\" And she tried to be happy with her flowers, but could not\nenter into them as before.\n\nMistress Anerley was as good as her word, at the very first opportunity.\nHer husband returned from the clover-stack tired and hungry, and angry\nwith a man who had taken too much beer, and ran at him with a pitchfork;\nangry also with his own son Willie for not being anywhere in the way to\nhelp. He did not complain; and his wife knew at once that he ought to\nhave done so, to obtain relief. She perceived that her own discourse\nabout their daughter was still on his mind, and would require working\noff before any more was said about it. And she felt as sure as if she\nsaw it that in his severity against poor Willie--for not doing things\nthat were beneath him--her master would take Mary's folly as a joke,\nand fall upon her brother, who was so much older, for not going on to\nprotect and guide her. So she kept till after supper-time her mouthful\nof bad tidings.\n\nAnd when the farmer heard it all, as he did before going to sleep that\nnight, he had smoked three pipes of tobacco, and was calm; he had sipped\n(for once in a way) a little Hollands, and was hopeful. And though he\nsaid nothing about it, he felt that without any order of his, or so much\nas the faintest desire to be told of it, neither of these petty comforts\nwould bear to be rudely examined of its duty. He hoped for the best,\nand he believed the best, and if the king was cheated, why, his loyal\nsubject was the same, and the women were their masters.\n\n\"Have no fear, no fear,\" he muttered back through the closing gate of\nsleep; \"Mary knows her business--business--\" and he buzzed it off into a\nsnore.\n\nIn the morning, however, he took a stronger and more serious view of the\ncase, pronouncing that Mary was only a young lass, and no one could ever\ntell about young lasses. And he quite fell into his wife's suggestion,\nthat the maid could be spared till harvest-time, of which (even with the\nbest of weather) there was little chance now for another six weeks, the\nseason being late and backward. So it was resolved between them both\nthat the girl should go on the following day for a visit to her uncle\nPopplewell, some miles the other side of Filey. No invitation was\nrequired; for Mr. and Mrs. Popplewell, a snug and comfortable pair,\nwere only too glad to have their niece, and had often wanted to have her\naltogether; but the farmer would never hear of that.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nCAUGHT AT LAST\n\n\nWhile these little things were doing thus, the coast from the mouth of\nthe Tees to that of Humber, and even the inland parts, were in a great\nstir of talk and work about events impending. It must not be thought\nthat Flamborough, although it was Robin's dwelling-place--so far as he\nhad any--was the principal scene of his operations, or the stronghold\nof his enterprise. On the contrary, his liking was for quiet coves near\nScarborough, or even to the north of Whitby, when the wind and tide\nwere suitable. And for this there were many reasons which are not of any\nmoment now.\n\nOne of them showed fine feeling and much delicacy on his part. He knew\nthat Flamborough was a place of extraordinary honesty, where every\none of his buttons had been safe, and would have been so forever; and\nstrictly as he believed in the virtue of his own free importation,\nit was impossible for him not to learn that certain people thought\notherwise, or acted as if they did so. From the troubles which such\ndoubts might cause, he strove to keep the natives free.\n\nFlamburians scarcely understood this largeness of good-will to them.\nTheir instincts told them that free trade was every Briton's privilege;\nand they had the finest set of donkeys on the coast for landing it. But\nnone the more did any of them care to make a movement toward it. They\nwere satisfied with their own old way--to cast the net their father\ncast, and bait the hook as it was baited on their good grandfather's\nthumb.\n\nYet even Flamborough knew that now a mighty enterprise was in hand. It\nwas said, without any contradiction, that young Captain Robin had laid\na wager of one hundred guineas with the worshipful mayor of Scarborough\nand the commandant of the castle, that before the new moon he would land\non Yorkshire coast, without firing pistol or drawing steel, free goods\nto the value of two thousand pounds, and carry them inland safely. And\nFlamborough believed that he would do it.\n\nDr. Upround's house stood well, as rectories generally contrive to do.\nNo place in Flamborough parish could hope to swindle the wind of its\nvested right, or to embezzle much treasure of the sun, but the parsonage\nmade a good effort to do both, and sometimes for three days together got\nthe credit of succeeding. And the dwellers therein, who felt the edge\nof the difference outside their own walls, not only said but thoroughly\nbelieved that they lived in a little Goshen.\n\nFor the house was well settled in a wrinkle of the hill expanding\nsouthward, and encouraging the noon. From the windows a pleasant glimpse\nmight be obtained of the broad and tranquil anchorage, peopled with\nwhite or black, according as the sails went up or down; for the rectory\nstood to the southward of the point, as the rest of Flamborough surely\nmust have stood, if built by any other race than armadillos. But to see\nall those vessels, and be sure what they were doing, the proper place\nwas a little snug \"gazebo,\" chosen and made by the doctor himself, near\nthe crest of the gully he inhabited.\n\nHere upon a genial summer day--when it came, as it sometimes dared to\ndo--was the finest little nook upon the Yorkshire coast for watching\nwhat Virgil calls \"the sail-winged sea.\" Not that a man could see round\nthe Head, unless his own were gifted with very crooked eyes; but without\ndoing that (which would only have disturbed the tranquillity of his\nprospect) there was plenty to engage him in the peaceful spread of\ncomparatively waveless waters. Here might he see long vessels rolling,\nnot with great misery, but just enough to make him feel happy in the\nfirmness of his bench, and little jolly-boats it was more jolly to be\nout of, and faraway heads giving genial bobs, and sea-legs straddled\nin predicaments desirable rather for study than for practice. All was\nhighly picturesque and nice, and charming for the critic who had never\ngot to do it.\n\n\"Now, papa, you must come this very moment,\" cried Miss Janetta Upround,\nthe daughter of the house, and indeed the only daughter, with a gush of\nexcitement, rushing into the study of this deeply read divine; \"there\nis something doing that I can not understand. You must bring up the\nspy-glass at once and explain. I am sure that there is something very\nwrong.\"\n\n\"In the parish, my dear?\" the rector asked, with a feeble attempt at\nmalice, for he did not want to be disturbed just now, and for weeks he\nhad tried (with very poor success) to make Janetta useful; for she had\nno gift in that way.\n\n\"No, not in the parish at all, papa, unless it runs out under water,\nas I am certain it ought to do, and make every one of those ships pay\ntithe. If the law was worth anything, they would have to do it. They\nget all the good out of our situation, and they save whole thousands\nof pounds at a time, and they never pay a penny, nor even hoist a flag,\nunless the day is fine, and the flag wants drying. But come along, papa,\nnow. I really can not wait; and they will have done it all without us.\"\n\n\"Janetta, take the glass and get the focus. I will come presently,\npresently. In about two minutes--by the time that you are ready.\"\n\n\"Very well, papa. It is very good of you. I see quite clearly what\nyou want to do; and I hope you will do it. But you promise not to play\nanother game now?\"\n\n\"My dear, I will promise that with pleasure. Only do please be off about\nyour business.\"\n\nThe rector was a most inveterate and insatiable chess-player. In the\nhousehold, rather than by it, he was, as a matter of lofty belief,\nsupposed to be deeply engaged with theology, or magisterial questions of\nalmost equal depth, or (to put it at the lowest) parochial affairs,\nthe while he was solidly and seriously engaged in getting up the sound\ndefense to some Continental gambit. And this, not only to satisfy\nhimself upon some point of theory, but from a nearer and dearer point of\nview--for he never did like to be beaten.\n\nAt present he was laboring to discover the proper defense to a new and\nslashing form of the Algaier gambit, by means of which Robin Lyth had\nwon every game in which he had the move, upon their last encounter.\nThe great free-trader, while a boy, had shown an especial aptitude for\nchess, and even as a child he had seemed to know the men when first, by\nsome accident, he saw them. The rector being struck by this exception\nto the ways of childhood--whose manner it is to take chess-men for\n\"dollies,\" or roll them about like nine-pins--at once included in\nthe education of \"Izunsabe,\" which he took upon himself, a course of\nelemental doctrine in the one true game. And the boy fought his way up\nat such a pace that he jumped from odds of queen and rook to pawn and\ntwo moves in less than two years. And now he could almost give odds to\nhis tutor, though he never presumed to offer them; and trading as he\ndid with enlightened merchants of large Continental sea-ports, who had\nplenty of time on their hands and played well, he imported new openings\nof a dash and freedom which swallowed the ground up under the feet of\nthe steady-going players, who had never seen a book upon their favorite\nsubject. Of course it was competent to all these to decline such fiery\nonslaught; but chivalry and the true love of analysis (which without may\nnone play chess) compelled the acceptance of the challenge, even with a\ntrembling forecast of the taste of dust.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Dr. Upround, as he rose and stretched himself, a good\nstraight man of threescore years, with silver hair that shone like\nsilk; \"it has not come to me yet; but it must, with a little\nmore perseverance. At Cambridge I beat everybody; and who is this\nuncircumcised--at least, I beg his pardon, for I did myself baptize\nhim--but who is Robin Lyth, to mate his pastor and his master? All these\ngambits are like a night attack. If once met properly and expelled,\nyou are in the very heart of the enemy's camp. He has left his own\nwatch-fires to rush at yours. The next game I play, I shall be sure to\nbeat him.\"\n\nFully convinced of this great truth, he took a strong oak staff and\nhastened to obey his daughter. Miss Janetta Upround had not only learned\nby nature, but also had been carefully taught by her parents, and by\nevery one, how to get her own way always, and to be thanked for taking\nit. But she had such a happy nature, full of kindness and good-will,\nthat other people's wishes always seemed to flow into her own, instead\nof being swept aside. Over her father her government was in no sort\nconstitutional, nor even a quiet despotism sweetened with liberal\nillusions, but as pure a piece of autocracy as the Continent could\nitself contain, in the time of this first Napoleon.\n\n\"Papa, what a time you have been, to be sure!\" she exclaimed, as the\ndoctor came gradually up, probing his way in perfect leisure, and\nfragrant still of that gambit; \"one would think that your parish was\non dry land altogether, while the better half of it, as they call\nthemselves--though the women are in righteousness the better half a\nhundredfold--\"\n\n\"My dear, do try to talk with some little sense of arithmetic, if no\nother. A hundredfold the half would be the unit multiplied by fifty. Not\nto mention that there can be no better half--\"\n\n\"Yes, there can, papa, ever so many; and you may see one in mamma every\nday. Now you put one eye to this glass, and the half is better than the\nwhole. With both, you see nothing; with one, you see better, fifty times\nbetter, than with both before. Don't talk of arithmetic after that. It\nis algebra now, and quod demonstrandum.\"\n\n\"To reason with the less worthy gender is degeneration of reason. What\nwould they have said in the Senate-house, Janetta? However, I will obey\nyour orders. What am I to look at?\"\n\n\"A tall and very extraordinary man, striking his arms out, thus and\nthus. I never saw any one looking so excited; and he flourishes a long\nsword now and again, as if he would like to cut everybody's head off.\nThere he has been going from ship to ship, for an hour or more, with a\nlong white boat, and a lot of men jumping after him. Every one seems\nto be scared of him, and he stumps along the deck just as if he were on\nsprings, and one spring longer than the other. You see that heavy brig\noutside the rest, painted with ten port-holes; well, she began to make\nsail and run away, but he fired a gun--quite a real cannon--and she\nhad to come back again and drop her colors. Oh, is it some very great\nadmiral, papa? Perhaps Lord Nelson himself; I would go and be seasick\nfor three days to see Lord Nelson. Papa, it must be Lord Nelson.\"\n\n\"My dear, Lord Nelson is a little, short man, with a very brisk walk,\nand one arm gone. Now let me see who this can be. Whereabout is he now,\nJanetta?\"\n\n\"Do you see that clumsy-looking schooner, papa, just behind a\npilot-boat? He is just in front of her foremast--making such a fuss--\"\n\n\"What eyes you have got, my child! You see better without the glass than\nI do with it.--Oh, now I have him! Why, I might have guessed. Of course\nit is that very active man and vigilant officer Lieutenant Carroway.\"\n\n\"Captain Carroway from Bridlington, papa? Why, what can he be doing with\nsuch authority? I have often heard of him, but I thought he was only a\ncoast-guard.\"\n\n\"He is, as you say, showing great authority, and, I fear, using very\nbad language, for which he is quite celebrated. However, the telescope\nrefuses to repeat it, for which it is much to be commended. But\nevery allowance must be made for a man who has to deal with a wholly\nuncultivated race, and not of natural piety, like ours.\"\n\n\"Well, papa, I doubt if ours have too much, though you always make the\nbest of them. But let me look again, please; and do tell me what he can\nbe doing there.\"\n\n\"You know that the revenue officers must take the law into their\nown hands sometimes. There have lately been certain rumors of some\ncontraband proceedings on the Yorkshire coast. Not in Flamborough\nparish, of course, and perhaps--probably, I may say--a long way off---\"\n\n\"Papa dear, will you never confess that free trade prevails and\nflourishes greatly even under your own dear nose?\"\n\n\"Facts do not warrant me in any such assertion. If the fact were so,\nit must have been brought officially before me. I decline to listen to\nuncharitable rumors. But however that matter may be, there are officers\non the spot to deal with it. My commission as a justice of the peace\ngives me no cognizance of offenses--if such there are--upon the high\nseas. Ah! you see something particular; my dear, what is it?\"\n\n\"Captain Carroway has found something, or somebody, of great importance.\nHe has got a man by the collar, and he is absolutely dancing with\ndelight. Ah! there he goes, dragging him along the deck as if he were\na cod-fish or a conger. And now, I declare, he is lashing his arms\nand legs with a great thick rope. Papa, is that legal, without even a\nwarrant?\"\n\n\"I can hardly say how far his powers may extend, and he is just the man\nto extend them farther. I only hope not to be involved in the matter.\nMaritime law is not my province.\"\n\n\"But, papa, it is much within three miles of the shore, if that has got\nanything to do with it. My goodness me! They are all coming here; I am\nalmost sure that they will apply to you. Yes, two boat-loads of people,\nracing to get their oars out, and to be here first. Where are your\nspectacles, dear papa? You had better go and get up the law before they\ncome. You will scarcely have time, they are coming so fast--a white boat\nand a black boat. The prisoner is in the white boat, and the officer\nhas got him by the collar still. The men in the white boat will want\nto commit him, and the men in the black boat are his friends, no doubt,\ncoming for a habeas corpus--\"\n\n\"My dear, what nonsense you do talk! What has a simple justice of the\npeace--\"\n\n\"Never mind that, papa; my facts are sound--sounder than yours about\nsmuggling, I fear. But do hurry in, and get up the law. I will go and\nlock both gates, to give you more time.\"\n\n\"Do nothing of the kind, Janetta. A magistrate should be accessible\nalways; and how can I get up the law, without knowing what it is to be\nabout--or even a clerk to help me? And perhaps they are not coming here\nat all. They may be only landing their prisoner.\"\n\n\"If that were it, they would not be coming so, but rowing toward the\nproper place, Bridlington Quay, where their station-house is. Papa, you\nare in for it, and I am getting eager. May I come and hear all about it?\nI should be a great support to you, you know. And they would tell the\ntruth so much better!\"\n\n\"Janetta, what are you dreaming of? It may even be a case of secrecy.\"\n\n\"Secrecy, papa, with two boat-loads of men and about thirty ships\ninvolved in it! Oh, do let me hear all about it!\"\n\n\"Whatever it may be, your presence is not required, and would be\nimproper. Unless I should happen to want a book; and in that case I\nmight ring for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, do, papa, do! No one else can ever find them. Promise me now that\nyou will want a book. If I am not there, there will be no justice done.\nI wish you severely to reprimand, whatever the facts of the case may be,\nand even to punish, if you can, that tall, lame, violent, ferocious\nman, for dragging the poor fellow about like that, and cutting him with\nropes, when completely needless, and when he was quite at his mercy.\nIt is my opinion that the other man does not deserve one bit of it; and\nwhatever the law may be, papa, your duty is to strain it benevolently,\nand question every syllable upon the stronger side.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better resign, my dear, upon condition that you shall be\nappointed in the stead of me. It might be a popular measure, and would\nsecure universal justice.\"\n\n\"Papa, I would do justice to myself--which is a thing you never do. But\nhere, they are landing; and they hoist him out as if he were a sack,\nor a thing without a joint. They could scarcely be harder with a man\ncompelled to be hanged to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Condemned is what you mean, Janetta. You never will understand the use\nof words. What a nice magistrate you would make!\"\n\n\"There can be no more correct expression. Would any man be hanged if he\nwere not compelled? Papa, you say the most illegal things sometimes. Now\nplease to go in and get up your legal points. Let me go and meet those\npeople for you. I will keep them waiting till you are quite ready.\"\n\n\"My dear, you will go to your room, and try to learn a little patience.\nYou begin to be too pat with your own opinions, which in a young lady is\nungraceful. There, you need not cry, my darling, because your opinions\nare always sensible, and I value them very highly; but still you must\nbear in mind that you are but a girl.\"\n\n\"And behave accordingly, as they say. Nobody can do more so. But though\nI am only a girl, papa, can you put your hand upon a better one?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, my dear; for going down hill, I can always depend on\nyou.\"\n\nSuiting the action to the word, Dr. Upround, whose feet were a little\ntouched with gout, came down from his outlook to his kitchen-garden, and\nthence through the shrubbery back to his own study, where, with a little\nsigh, he put away his chess-men, and heartily hoped that it might not be\nhis favorite adversary who was coming before him to be sent to jail.\nFor although the good rector had a warm regard, and even affection, for\nRobin Lyth, as a waif cast into his care, and then a pupil wonderfully\napt (which breeds love in the teacher), and after that a most gallant\nand highly distinguished young parishioner--with all this it was a\ndifficulty for him to be ignorant that the law was adverse. More than\nonce he had striven hard to lead the youth into some better path of\nlife, and had even induced him to \"follow the sea\" for a short time in\nthe merchant service. But the force of nature and of circumstances had\nvery soon prevailed again, and Robin returned to his old pursuits with\nlarger experience, and seamanship improved.\n\nA violent ringing at the gate bell, followed by equal urgency upon\nthe front door, apprised the kind magistrate of a sharp call on his\nfaculties, and perhaps a most unpleasant one. \"The poor boy!\" he said to\nhimself--\"poor boy! From Carroway's excitement I greatly fear that it is\nindeed poor Robin. How many a grand game have we had! His new variety of\nthat fine gambit scarcely beginning to be analyzed; and if I commit him\nto the meeting next week, when shall we ever meet again? It will seem\nas if I did it because he won three games; and I certainly was a little\nvexed with him. However, I must be stern, stern, stern. Show them in,\nBetsy; I am quite prepared.\"\n\nA noise, and a sound of strong language in the hall, and a dragging of\nsomething on the oil-cloth, led up to the entry of a dozen rough men,\npushed on by at least another dozen.\n\n\"You will have the manners to take off your hats,\" said the magistrate,\nwith all his dignity; \"not from any undue deference to me, but common\nrespect to his Majesty.\"\n\n\"Off with your covers, you sons of\"--something, shouted a loud voice;\nand then the lieutenant, with his blade still drawn, stood before them.\n\n\"Sheathe your sword, Sir,\" said Dr. Upround, in a voice which amazed the\nofficer.\n\n\"I beg your Worship's pardon,\" he began, with his grim face flushing\npurple, but his sword laid where it should have been; \"but if you knew\nhalf of the worry I have had, you would not care to rebuke me. Cadman,\nhave you got him by the neck? Keep your knuckles into him, while I make\nmy deposition.\"\n\n\"Cast that man free, I receive no depositions with a man half strangled\nbefore me.\"\n\nThe men of the coast-guard glanced at their commander, and receiving a\nsurly nod, obeyed. But the prisoner could not stand as yet; he gasped\nfor breath, and some one set him on a chair.\n\n\"Your Worship, this is a mere matter of form,\" said Carroway, still\nkeeping eyes on his prey; \"if I had my own way, I would not trouble you\nat all, and I believe it to be quite needless. For this man is an outlaw\nfelon, and not entitled to any grace of law; but I must obey my orders.\"\n\n\"Certainly you must, Lieutenant Carroway, even though you are better\nacquainted with the law. You are ready to be sworn? Take this book, and\nfollow me.\"\n\nThis being done, the worthy magistrate prepared to write down what the\ngallant officer might say, which, in brief, came to this, that having\norders to seize Robin Lyth wherever he might find him, and having sure\nknowledge that said Robin was on board of a certain schooner vessel, the\nElizabeth, of Goole, the which he had laden with goods liable to duty,\nhe, Charles Carroway, had gently laid hands on him, and brought him to\nthe nearest justice of the peace, to obtain an order of commitment.\n\nAll this, at fifty times the length here given, Lieutenant Carroway\ndeposed on oath, while his Worship, for want of a clerk, set it down in\nhis own very neat handwriting. But several very coaly-looking men, who\ncould scarcely be taught to keep silence, observed that the magistrate\nsmiled once or twice; and this made them wait a bit, and wink at one\nanother.\n\n\"Very clear indeed, Lieutenant Carroway,\" said Dr. Upround, with\nspectacles on nose. \"Good Sir, have the kindness to sign your\ndeposition. It may become my duty to commit the prisoner, upon\nidentification. Of that I must have evidence, confirmatory evidence. But\nfirst we will hear what he has to say. Robin Lyth, stand forward.\"\n\n\"Me no Robin Lyth, Sar; no Robin man or woman,\" cried the captive,\ntrying very hard to stand; \"me only a poor Francais, make liberty to\nwhat you call--row, row, sweem, sweem, sail, sail, from la belle France;\nfor why, for why, there is no import to nobody.\"\n\n\"Your Worship, he is always going on about imports,\" Cadman said,\nrespectfully; \"that is enough to show who he is.\"\n\n\"You may trust me to know him,\" cried Lieutenant Carroway. \"My\nfine fellow, no more of that stuff! He can pass himself off for any\ncountryman whatever. He knows all their jabber, Sir, better than his\nown. Put a cork between his teeth, Hackerbody. I never did see such a\nnoisy rogue. He is Robin Lyth all over.\"\n\n\"I'll be blest if he is, nor under nayther,\" cried the biggest of the\ncoaly men; \"this here froggy come out of a Chaise and Mary as had run up\nfrom Dunkirk. I know Robin Lyth as well as our own figure-head. But what\ngood to try reason with that there revenue hofficer?\"\n\nAt this, all his friends set a good laugh up, and wanted to give him a\ncheer for such a speech; but that being hushed, they were satisfied with\ncondemning his organs of sight and their own quite fairly.\n\n\"Lieutenant Carroway,\" his Worship said, amidst an impressive silence,\n\"I greatly fear that you have allowed zeal, my dear Sir, to outrun\ndiscretion. Robin Lyth is a young, and in many ways highly respected,\nparishioner of mine. He may have been guilty of casual breaches of the\nlaws concerning importation--laws which fluctuate from year to year, and\nrequire deep knowledge of legislation both to observe and to administer.\nI heartily trust that you may not suffer from having discharged your\nduty in a manner most truly exemplary, if only the example had been the\nright one. This gentleman is no more Robin Lyth than I am.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nDISCIPLINE ASSERTED\n\n\nAs soon as his troublesome visitors were gone, the rector sat down in\nhis deep arm-chair, laid aside his spectacles, and began to think. His\nface, while he thought, lost more and more of the calm and cheerful\nexpression which made it so pleasant a face to gaze upon; and he sighed,\nwithout knowing it, at some dark ideas, and gave a little shake of his\ngrand old head. The revenue officer had called his favorite pupil and\ncleverest parishioner \"a felon outlaw;\" and if that were so, Robin Lyth\nwas no less than a convicted criminal, and must not be admitted within\nhis doors. Formerly the regular penalty for illicit importation had been\nthe forfeiture of the goods when caught, and the smugglers (unless\nthey made resistance or carried fire-arms) were allowed to escape and\nretrieve their bad luck, which they very soon contrived to do. And as\nyet, upon this part of the coast, they had not been guilty of atrocious\ncrimes, such as the smugglers of Sussex and Hampshire--who must have\nbeen utter fiends--committed, thereby raising all the land against\nthem. Dr. Upround had heard of no proclamation, exaction, or even capias\nissued against this young free-trader; and he knew well enough that the\nworst offenders were not the bold seamen who contracted for the run, nor\nthe people of the coast who were hired for the carriage, but the rich\nindwellers who provided all the money, and received the lion's share\nof all the profits. And with these the law never even tried to deal.\nHowever, the magistrate-parson resolved that, in spite of all the\ninterest of tutorship and chess-play, and even all the influence of his\nwife and daughter (who were hearty admirers of brave smuggling), he must\neither reform this young man, or compel him to keep at a distance, which\nwould be very sad.\n\nMeanwhile the lieutenant had departed in a fury, which seemed to be\nincapable of growing any worse. Never an oath did he utter all the way\nto the landing where his boat was left; and his men, who knew how much\nthat meant, were afraid to do more than just wink at one another. Even\nthe sailors of the collier schooner forbore to jeer him, until he was\nafloat, when they gave him three fine rounds of mock cheers, to which\nthe poor Frenchman contributed a shriek. For this man had been most\ninhospitably treated, through his strange but undeniable likeness to a\nperfidious Briton.\n\n\"Home!\" cried the officer, glowering at those fellows, while his men\nheld their oars, and were ready to rush at them. \"Home, with a will!\nGive way, men!\" And not another word he spoke, till they touched the\nsteps at Bridlington. Then he fixed stern eyes upon Cadman, who vainly\nstrove to meet them, and he said, \"Come to me in one hour and a half.\"\nCadman touched his hat without an answer, saw to the boat, and then went\nhome along the quay.\n\nCarroway, though of a violent temper, especially when laughed at,\nwas not of that steadfast and sedentary wrath which chews the cud\nof grievances, and feeds upon it in a shady place. He had a good\nwife--though a little overclean--and seven fine-appetited children, who\ngave him the greatest pleasure in providing victuals. Also, he had his\npipe, and his quiet corners, sacred to the atmosphere and the private\nthoughts of Carroway. And here he would often be ambitious even now,\nperceiving no good reason why he might not yet command a line-of-battle\nship, and run up his own flag, and nobly tread his own lofty\nquarter-deck. If so, he would have Mrs. Carroway on board, and not only\non the boards, but at them; so that a challenge should be issued every\nday for any other ship in all the service to display white so wholly\nspotless, and black so void of streakiness. And while he was dwelling\nupon personal matters--which, after all, concerned the nation most--he\nhad tried very hard to discover any reason (putting paltry luck aside)\nwhy Horatio Nelson should be a Lord, and what was more to the purpose,\nan admiral, while Charles Carroway (his old shipmate, and in every way\nsuperior, who could eat him at a mouthful, if only he were good enough)\nshould now be no more than a 'long-shore lieutenant, and a Jonathan Wild\nof the revenue. However, as for envying Nelson, the Lord knew that he\nwould not give his little Geraldine's worst frock for all the fellow's\ngrand coat of arms, and freedom in a snuff-box, and golden shields, and\ndevices, this, that, and the other, with Bona Robas to support them.\n\nTo this conclusion he was fairly come, after a good meal, and with the\nsecond glass of the finest Jamaica pine-apple rum--which he drank from\npure principle, because it was not smuggled--steaming and scenting the\nblue curls of his pipe, when his admirable wife came in to say that on\nno account would she interrupt him.\n\n\"My dear, I am busy, and am very glad to hear it. Pish! where have I put\nall those accounts?\"\n\n\"Charles, you are not doing any accounts. When you have done your pipe\nand glass, I wish to say a quiet word or two. I am sure that there is\nnot a woman in a thousand--\"\n\n\"Matilda, I know it. Nor one in fifty thousand. You are very good at\nfigures: will you take this sheet away with you? Eight o'clock will be\nquite time enough for it.\"\n\n\"My dear, I am always too pleased to do whatever I can to help you. But\nI must talk to you now; really I must say a few words about something,\ntired as you may be, Charles, and well deserving of a little good sleep,\nwhich you never seem able to manage in bed. You told me, you know, that\nyou expected Cadman, that surly, dirty fellow, who delights to spoil my\nstones, and would like nothing better than to take the pattern out\nof our drawing-room Kidderminster. Now I have a reason for saying\nsomething. Charles, will you listen to me once, just once?\"\n\n\"I never do anything else,\" said the husband, with justice, and meaning\nno mischief.\n\n\"Ah! how very seldom you hear me talk; and when I do, I might just as\nwell address the winds! But for once, my dear, attend, I do implore you.\nThat surly, burly Cadman will be here directly, and I know that you\nare much put out with him. Now I tell you he is dangerous, savagely\ndangerous; I can see it in his unhealthy skin. Oh, Charles, where have\nyou put down your pipe? I cleaned that shelf this very morning! How\nlittle I thought when I promised to be yours that you ever would knock\nout your ashes like that! But do bear in mind, dear, whatever you do, if\nanything happened to you, what ever would become of all of us? All your\nsweet children and your faithful wife--I declare you have made two great\nrings with your tumbler upon the new cover of the table.\"\n\n\"Matilda, that has been done ever so long. But I am almost certain this\ntumbler leaks.\"\n\n\"So you always say; just as if I would allow it. You never will think of\nsimply wiping the rim every time you use it; when I put you a saucer for\nyour glass, you forget it; there never was such a man, I do believe. I\nshall have to stop the rum and water altogether.\"\n\n\"No, no, no. I'll do anything you like. I'll have a tumbler made with\na saucer to it--I'll buy a piece of oil-cloth the size of a\nforetop-sail--I'll--\"\n\n\"Charles, no nonsense, if you please: as if I were ever unreasonable!\nBut your quickness of temper is such that I dread what you may say to\nthat Cadman. Remember what opportunities he has, dear. He might shoot\nyou in the dark any night, my darling, and put it upon the smugglers. I\nentreat you not to irritate the man, and make him your enemy. He is so\nspiteful; and I should be in terror the whole night long.\"\n\n\"Matilda, in the house you may command me as you please--even in my\nown cuddy here. But as regards my duty, you know well that I permit\nno interference. And I should have expected you to have more sense. A\npretty officer I should be if I were afraid of my own men! When a man\nis to blame, I tell him so, in good round language, and shall do so now.\nThis man is greatly to blame, and I doubt whether to consider him a fool\nor a rogue. If it were not that he has seven children, as we have, I\nwould discharge him this very night.\"\n\n\"Charles, I am very sorry for his seven children, but our place is to\nthink of our own seven first. I beg you, I implore you, to discharge the\nman; for he has not the courage to harm you, I believe, except with the\ncowardly advantage he has got. Now promise me either to say nothing to\nhim, or to discharge him, and be done with him.\"\n\n\"Matilda, of such things you know nothing; and I can not allow you to\nsay any more.\"\n\n\"Very well, very well. I know my duty. I shall sit up and pray every\ndark night you are out, and the whole place will go to the dogs, of\ncourse. Of the smugglers I am not afraid one bit, nor of any honest\nfighting, such as you are used to. But oh, my dear Charles, the very\nbravest man can do nothing against base treachery.\"\n\n\"To dream of such things shows a bad imagination,\" Carroway answered,\nsternly; but seeing his wife's eyes fill with tears, he took her hand\ngently, and begged her pardon, and promised to be very careful, \"I am\nthe last man to be rash,\" he said, \"after getting so many more kicks\nthan coppers. I never had a fellow under my command who would lift\na finger to harm me. And you must remember, my darling Tilly, that I\ncommand Englishmen, not Lascars.\"\n\nWith this she was forced to be content, to the best of her ability; and\nGeraldine ran bouncing in from school to fill her father's pipe for him;\nso that by the time John Cadman came, his commander had almost forgotten\nthe wrath created by the failure of the morning. But unluckily Cadman\nhad not forgotten the words and the look he received before his\ncomrades.\n\n\"Here I am, Sir, to give an account of myself,\" he said, in an insolent\ntone, having taken much liquor to brace him for the meeting. \"Is it your\npleasure to say out what you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not here. You will follow me to the station.\" The lieutenant\ntook his favorite staff, and set forth, while his wife, from the little\nwindow, watched him with a very anxious gaze. She saw her husband stride\nin front with the long rough gait she knew so well, and the swing of his\narms which always showed that his temper was not in its best condition;\nand behind him Cadman slouched along, with his shoulders up and his red\nhands clinched. And the poor wife sadly went back to work, for her life\nwas a truly anxious one.\n\nThe station, as it was rather grandly called, was a hut, about the size\nof a four-post bed, upon the low cliff, undermined by the sea, and\neven then threatened to be swept away. Here was a tall flag-staff for\nsignals, and a place for a beacon-light when needed, and a bench with\na rest for a spy-glass. In the hut itself were signal flags, and a few\nspare muskets, and a keg of bullets, with maps and codes hung round the\nwall, and flint and tinder, and a good many pipes, and odds and ends on\nledges. Carroway was very proud of this place, and kept the key strictly\nin his own pocket, and very seldom allowed a man to pass through\nthe narrow doorway. But he liked to sit inside, and see them looking\ndesirous to come in.\n\n\"Stand there, Cadman,\" he said, as soon as he had settled himself in the\none hard chair; and the man, though thoroughly primed for revolt, obeyed\nthe old habit, and stood outside.\n\n\"Once more you have misled me, Cadman, and abused my confidence. More\nthan that, you have made me a common laughing-stock for scores of fools,\nand even for a learned gentleman, magistrate of divinity. I was not\ncontent with your information until you confirmed it by letters you\nproduced from men well known to you, as you said, and even from\nthe inland trader who had contracted for the venture. The schooner\nElizabeth, of Goole, disguised as a collier, was to bring to, with Robin\nLyth on board of her, and the goods in her hold under covering of coal,\nand to run the goods at the South Flamborough landing this very night. I\nhave searched the Elizabeth from stem to stern, and the craft brought\nup alongside of her; and all I have found is a wretched Frenchman, who\nskulked so that I made sure of him, and not a blessed anker of foreign\nbrandy, nor even a forty-pound bag of tea. You had that packet of\nletters in your neck-tie. Hand them to me this moment--\"\n\n\"If your Honor has made up your mind to think that a sailor of the Royal\nNavy--\"\n\n\"Cadman, none of that! No lick-spittle lies to me; those letters, that\nI may establish them! You shall have them back, if they are right. And I\nwill pay you a half crown for the loan.\"\n\n\"If I was to leave they letters in your hand, I could never hold head up\nin Burlington no more.\"\n\n\"That is no concern of mine. Your duty is to hold up your head with me,\nand those who find you in bread and butter.\"\n\n\"Precious little butter I ever gets, and very little bread to speak of.\nThe folk that does the work gets nothing. Them that does nothing gets\nthe name and game.\"\n\n\"Fellow, no reasoning, but obey me!\" Carroway shouted, with his temper\nrising. \"Hand over those letters, or you leave the service.\"\n\n\"How can I give away another man's property?\" As he said these words,\nthe man folded his arms, as who should say, \"That is all you get out of\nme.\"\n\n\"Is that the way you speak to your commanding officer? Who owns those\nletters, then, according to your ideas?\"\n\n\"Butcher Hewson; and he says that you shall have them as soon as he sees\nthe money for his little bill.\"\n\nThis was a trifle too much for Carroway. Up he jumped with surprising\nspeed, took one stride through the station door, and seizing Cadman by\nthe collar, shook him, wrung his ear with the left hand, which was like\na pair of pincers, and then with the other flung him backward as if he\nwere an empty bag. The fellow was too much amazed to strike, or close\nwith him, or even swear, but received the vehement impact without any\nstay behind him. So that he staggered back, hat downward, and striking\none heel on a stone, fell over the brink of the shallow cliff to the\nsand below.\n\nThe lieutenant, who never had thought of this, was terribly scared, and\nhis wrath turned cold. For although the fall was of no great depth, and\nthe ground at the bottom so soft, if the poor man had struck it poll\nforemost, as he fell, it was likely that his neck was broken. Without\nany thought of his crippled heel, Carroway took the jump himself.\n\nAs soon as he recovered from the jar, which shook his stiff joints and\nstiffer back, he ran to the coast-guardsman and raised him, and found\nhim very much inclined to swear. This was a good sign, and the officer\nwas thankful, and raised him in the gravelly sand, and kindly requested\nhim to have it out, and to thank the Lord as soon as he felt better. But\nCadman, although he very soon came round, abstained from every token of\ngratitude. Falling with his mouth wide open in surprise, he had filled\nit with gravel of inferior taste, as a tidy sewer pipe ran out just\nthere, and at every execration he discharged a little.\n\n\"What can be done with a fellow so ungrateful?\" cried the lieutenant,\nstanding stiffly up again; \"nothing but to let him come back to his\nmanners. Hark you, John Cadman, between your bad words, if a glass of\nhot grog will restore your right wits, you can come up and have it, when\nyour clothes are brushed.\"\n\nWith these words Carroway strode off to his cottage, without even\ndeigning to look back, for a minute had been enough to show him that no\nvery serious harm was done.\n\nThe other man did not stir until his officer was out of sight; and then\nhe arose and rubbed himself, but did not care to go for his rummer of\nhot grog.\n\n\"I must work this off,\" the lieutenant said, as soon as he had told\nhis wife, and received his scolding; \"I can not sit down; I must do\nsomething. My mind is becoming too much for me, I fear. Can you expect\nme to be laughed at? I shall take a little sail in the boat; the wind\nsuits, and I have a particular reason. Expect me, my dear, when you see\nme.\"\n\nIn half an hour the largest boat, which carried a brass swivel-gun in\nher bows, was stretching gracefully across the bay, with her three white\nsails flashing back the sunset. The lieutenant steered, and he had four\nmen with him, of whom Cadman was not one, that worthy being left at\nhome to nurse his bruises and his dudgeon. These four men now were quite\nmarvellously civil, having heard of their comrade's plight, and being\npleased alike with that and with their commander's prowess. For Cadman\nwas by no means popular among them, because, though his pay was the same\nas theirs, he always tried to be looked up to; the while his manners\nwere not distinguished, and scarcely could be called polite, when a\nsupper required to be paid for. In derision of this, and of his desire\nfor mastery, they had taken to call him \"Boatswain Jack,\" or \"John\nBoatswain,\" and provoked him by a subscription to present him with a\npig-whistle. For these were men who liked well enough to receive hard\nwords from their betters who were masters of their business, but saw\nneither virtue nor value in submitting to superior airs from their\nequals.\n\nThe Royal George, as this boat was called, passed through the fleet of\nquiet vessels, some of which trembled for a second visitation; but not\ndeigning to molest them, she stood on, and rounding Flamborough Head,\npassed by the pillar rocks called King and Queen, and bore up for the\nNorth Landing cove. Here sail was taken in, and oars were manned; and\nCarroway ordered his men to pull in to the entrance of each of the\nwell-known caves.\n\nTo enter these, when any swell is running, requires great care and\nexperience; and the Royal George had too much beam to do it comfortably,\neven in the best of weather. And now what the sailors call a \"chopping\nsea\" had set in with the turn of the tide, although the wind was still\noff-shore; so that even to lie to at the mouth made rather a ticklish\njob of it. The men looked at one another, and did not like it, for\na badly handled oar would have cast them on the rocks, which are\nvillainously hard and jagged, and would stave in the toughest boat, like\nbiscuit china. However, they durst not say that they feared it; and by\nskill and steadiness they examined all three caves quite enough to be\ncertain that no boat was in them.\n\nThe largest of the three, and perhaps the finest, was the one they first\ncame to, which already was beginning to be called the cave of Robin\nLyth. The dome is very high, and sheds down light when the gleam of the\nsea strikes inward. From the gloomy mouth of it, as far as they could\nventure, the lapping of the wavelets could be heard all round it,\nwithout a boat, or even a balk of wood to break it. Then they tried\necho, whose clear answer hesitates where any soft material is; but the\nshout rang only of hard rock and glassy water. To make assurance doubly\nsure, they lit a blue-light, and sent it floating through the depths,\nwhile they held their position with two boat-hooks and a fender. The\ncavern was lit up with a very fine effect, but not a soul inside of it\nto animate the scene. And to tell the truth, the bold invaders were\nby no means grieved at this; for if there had been smugglers there, it\nwould have been hard to tackle them.\n\nHauling off safely, which was worse than running in, they pulled across\nthe narrow cove, and rounding the little headland, examined the Church\nCave and the Dovecote likewise, and with a like result. Then heartily\ntired, and well content with having done all that man could do, they\nset sail again in the dusk of the night, and forged their way against a\nstrong ebb-tide toward the softer waters of Bridlington, and the warmer\ncomfort of their humble homes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nDELICATE INQUIRIES\n\n\nA genuine summer day pays a visit nearly once in the season to\nFlamborough; and when it does come, it has a wonderful effect. Often the\nsun shines brightly there, and often the air broods hot with thunder;\nbut the sun owes his brightness to sweep of the wind, which sweeps away\nhis warmth as well; while, on the other hand, the thunder-clouds, like\nheavy smoke capping the headland, may oppress the air with heat, but are\nnot of sweet summer's beauty.\n\nFor once, however, the fine day came, and the natives made haste to\nrevile it. Before it was three hours old they had found a hundred and\nfifty faults with it. Most of the men truly wanted a good sleep, after\nbeing lively all the night upon the waves, and the heat and the yellow\nlight came in upon their eyes, and set the flies buzzing all about them.\nAnd even the women, who had slept out their time, and talked quietly,\nlike the clock ticking, were vexed with the sun, which kept their\nkettles from good boiling, and wrote upon their faces the years of their\nlife. But each made allowance for her neighbor's appearance, on the\nstrength of the troubles she had been through. For the matter of that,\nthe sun cared not the selvage of a shadow what was thought of him, but\nwent his bright way with a scattering of clouds and a tossing of vapors\nanywhere. Upon the few fishermen who gave up hope of sleep, and came\nto stand dazed in their doorways, the glare of white walls and chalky\nstones, and dusty roads, produced the same effect as if they had put on\ntheir fathers' goggles. Therefore they yawned their way back to their\nroom, and poked up the fire, without which, at Flamborough, no hot\nweather would be half hot enough.\n\nThe children, however, were wide-awake, and so were the washer-women,\nwhose turn it had been to sleep last night for the labors of the\nmorning. These were plying hand and tongue in a little field by the\nthree cross-roads, where gaffers and gammers of by-gone time had set up\ntroughs of proven wood, and the bilge of a long storm-beaten boat, near\na pool of softish water. Stout brown arms were roped with curd, and\nwedding rings looked slippery things, and thumb-nails bordered with\ninveterate black, like broad beans ripe for planting, shone through a\nhubbub of snowy froth; while sluicing and wringing and rinsing went on\nover the bubbled and lathery turf; and every handy bush or stub, and\nevery tump of wiry grass, was sheeted with white, like a ship in full\nsail, and shining in the sun-glare.\n\nFrom time to time these active women glanced back at their cottages,\nto see that the hearth was still alive, or at their little daughters\nsquatting under the low wall which kept them from the road, where they\nhad got all the babies to nurse, and their toes and other members to\ncompare, and dandelion chains to make. But from their washing ground the\nwomen could not see the hill that brings to the bottom of the village\nthe crooked road from Sewerby. Down that hill came a horseman slowly,\nwith nobody to notice him, though himself on the watch for everybody;\nand there in the bottom below the first cottage he allowed his horse to\nturn aside and cool hot feet and leathery lips, in a brown pool spread\nby Providence for the comfort of wayworn roadsters.\n\nThe horse looked as if he had labored far, while his rider was calmly\nresting; for the cross-felled sutures of his flank were crusted with\ngray perspiration, and the runnels of his shoulders were dabbled; and\nnow it behooved him to be careful how he sucked the earthy-flavored\nwater, so as to keep time with the heaving of his barrel. In a word,\nhe was drinking as if he would burst--as his hostler at home often told\nhim--but the clever old roadster knew better than that, and timing it\nwell between snorts and coughs, was tightening his girths with deep\npleasure.\n\n\"Enough, my friend, is as good as a feast,\" said his rider to him,\ngently, yet strongly pulling up the far-stretched head, \"and too much is\nworse than a famine.\"\n\nThe horse, though he did not belong to this gentleman, but was hired by\nhim only yesterday, had already discovered that, with him on his back,\nhis own judgment must lie dormant, so that he quietly whisked his tail\nand glanced with regret at the waste of his drip, and then, with a\nroundabout step, to prolong the pleasure of this little wade, sadly but\nsteadily out he walked, and, after the necessary shake, began his\nfirst invasion of the village. His rider said nothing, but kept a sharp\nlook-out.\n\nNow this was Master Geoffrey Mordacks, of the ancient city of York, a\ngeneral factor and land agent. What a \"general factor\" is, or is not,\nnone but himself can pretend to say, even in these days of definition,\nand far less in times when thought was loose; and perhaps Mr. Mordacks\nwould rather have it so. But any one who paid him well could trust him,\naccording to the ancient state of things. To look at him, nobody would\neven dare to think that money could be a consideration to him, or\nthe name of it other than an insult. So lofty and steadfast his whole\nappearance was, and he put back his shoulders so manfully. Upright,\nstiff, and well appointed with a Roman nose, he rode with the seat of a\nsoldier and the decision of a tax-collector. From his long steel spurs\nto his hard coned hat not a soft line was there, nor a feeble curve.\nStern honesty and strict purpose stamped every open piece of him so\nstrictly that a man in a hedge-row fostering devious principles, and\nresolved to try them, could do no more than run away, and be thankful\nfor the chance of it.\n\nBut in those rough and dangerous times, when thousands of people were\nstarving, the view of a pistol-butt went further than sternest aspect of\nstrong eyes. Geoffrey Mordacks well knew this, and did not neglect his\nknowledge. The brown walnut stock of a heavy pistol shone above either\nholster, and a cavalry sword in a leathern scabbard hung within easy\nreach of hand. Altogether this gentleman seemed not one to be rashly\nattacked by daylight.\n\nNo man had ever dreamed as yet of coming to this outlandish place for\npleasure of the prospect. So that when this lonely rider was descried\nfrom the washing field over the low wall of the lane, the women made\nup their minds at once that it must be a justice of the peace, or some\ngreat rider of the Revenue, on his way to see Dr. Upandown, or at the\nleast a high constable concerned with some great sheep-stealing. Not\nthat any such crime was known in the village itself of Flamborough,\nwhich confined its operations to the sea; but in the outer world of\nland that malady was rife just now, and a Flamborough man, too fond of\nmutton, had farmed some sheep on the downs, and lost them, which was\nconsidered a judgment on him for willfully quitting ancestral ways.\n\nBut instead of turning at the corner where the rector was trying to grow\nsome trees, the stranger kept on along the rugged highway, and between\nthe straggling cottages, so that the women rinsed their arms, and turned\nround to take a good look at him, over the brambles and furze, and the\nwall of chalky flint and rubble.\n\n\"This is just what I wanted,\" thought Geoffrey Mordacks: \"skill makes\nluck, and I am always lucky. Now, first of all, to recruit the inner\nman.\"\n\nAt this time Mrs. Theophila Precious, generally called \"Tapsy,\" the\nwidow of a man who had been lost at sea, kept the \"Cod with a Hook in\nhis Gills,\" the only hostelry in Flamborough village, although there\nwas another toward the Landing. The cod had been painted from life--or\ndeath--by a clever old fisherman who understood him, and he looked so\nfirm, and stiff, and hard, that a healthy man, with purse enough to tire\nof butcher's-meat, might grow in appetite by gazing. Mr. Mordacks pulled\nup, and fixed steadfast eyes upon this noble fish, the while a score\nof sharp eyes from the green and white meadow were fixed steadfastly on\nhim.\n\n\"How he shines with salt-water! How firm he looks, and his gills as\nbright as a rose in June! I have never yet tasted a cod at first hand.\nIt is early in the day, but the air is hungry. My expenses are paid, and\nI mean to live well, for a strong mind will be required. I will have a\ncut out of that fish, to begin with.\"\n\nInditing of this, and of matters even better, the rider turned into the\nyard of the inn, where an old boat (as usual) stood for a horse-trough,\nand sea-tubs served as buckets. Strong sunshine glared upon the\noversaling tiles, and white buckled walls, and cracky lintels;\nbut nothing showed life, except an old yellow cat, and a pair of\nhouse-martins, who had scarcely time to breathe, such a number of little\nheads flipped out with a white flap under the beak of each, demanding\nmomentous victualling. At these the yellow cat winked with dreamy\njoyfulness, well aware how fat they would be when they came to tumble\nout.\n\n\"What a place of vile laziness!\" grumbled Mr. Mordacks, as he got off\nhis horse, after vainly shouting \"Hostler!\" and led him to the byre,\nwhich did duty for a stable. \"York is a lazy hole enough, but the\nfurther you go from it, the lazier they get. No energy, no movement, no\nambition, anywhere. What a country! what a people! I shall have to go\nback and enlist the washer-women.\"\n\nA Yorkshireman might have answered this complaint, if he thought it\ndeserving of an answer, by requesting Master Mordacks not to be so\noverquick, but to bide a wee bit longer before he made so sure of the\nvast superiority of his own wit, for the long heads might prove better\nthan the sharp ones in the end of it. However, the general factor\nthought that he could not have come to a better place to get all that he\nwanted out of everybody. He put away his saddle, and the saddlebags\nand sword, in a rough old sea-chest with a padlock to it, and having a\nsprinkle of chaff at the bottom. Then he calmly took the key, as if\nthe place were his, gave his horse a rackful of long-cut grass, and\npresented himself, with a lordly aspect, at the front door of the silent\ninn. Here he made noise enough to stir the dead; and at the conclusion\nof a reasonable time, during which she had finished a pleasant dream\nto the simmering of the kitchen pot, the landlady showed herself in the\ndistance, feeling for her keys with one hand, and rubbing her eyes\nwith the other. This was the head-woman of the village, but seldom\ntyrannical, unless ill-treated, Widow Precious, tall and square, and of\nno mean capacity.\n\n\"Young mon,\" with a deep voice she said, \"what is tha' deein' wi' aw\nthat clatter?\"\n\n\"Alas, my dear madam, I am not a young man; and therefore time is more\nprecious to me. I have lived out half my allotted span, and shall never\ncomplete it unless I get food.\"\n\n\"T' life o' mon is aw a hoory,\" replied Widow Precious, with slow truth.\n\"Young mon, what 'll ye hev?\"\n\n\"Dinner, madam; dinner at the earliest moment. I have ridden far, and my\nback is sore, and my substance is calling for renewal.\"\n\n\"Ate, ate, ate, that's t' waa of aw menkins. Bud ye maa coom in, and\ncrack o' it.\"\n\n\"Madam, you are most hospitable; and the place altogether seems to be\nof that description. What a beautiful room! May I sit down? I perceive\na fine smell of most delicate soup. Ah, you know how to do things at\nFlamborough.\"\n\n\"Young mon, ye can ha' nune of yon potty. Yon's for mesell and t'\nchilder.\"\n\n\"My excellent hostess, mistake me not. I do not aspire to such lofty\npot-luck. I simply referred to it as a proof of your admirable culinary\npowers.\"\n\n\"Yon's beeg words. What 'll ye hev te ate?\"\n\n\"A fish like that upon your sign-post, madam, or at least the upper half\nof him; and three dozen oysters just out of the sea, swimming in their\nown juice, with lovely melted butter.\"\n\n\"Young mon, hast tha gotten t' brass? Them 'at ates offens forgets t'\nreck'nin'.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, I have the needful in abundance. Ecce signum! Which is\nLatin, madam, for the stamps of the king upon twenty guineas. One to be\ndeposited in your fair hand for a taste, for a sniff, madam, such as I\nhad of your pot.\"\n\n\"Na, na. No tokkins till a' airned them. What ood your Warship be for\nating when a' boileth?\"\n\nThe general factor, perceiving his way, was steadfast to the shoulder\ncut of a decent cod; and though the full season was scarcely yet come,\nMrs. Precious knew where to find one. Oysters there were none, but she\ngave him boiled limpets, and he thought it the manner of the place that\nmade them tough. After these things he had a duck of the noblest and\nbest that live anywhere in England. Such ducks were then, and perhaps\nare still, the most remarkable residents of Flamborough. Not only\nbecause the air is fine, and the puddles and the dabblings of\nextraordinary merit, and the wind fluffs up their pretty feathers while\nalive, as the eloquent poulterer by-and-by will do; but because they\nhave really distinguished birth, and adventurous, chivalrous, and bright\nblue Norman blood. To such purpose do the gay young Vikings of the\nworld of quack pour in (when the weather and the time of year invite),\nequipped with red boots and plumes of purple velvet, to enchant the coy\nlady ducks in soft water, and eclipse the familiar and too legal drake.\nFor a while they revel in the change of scene, the luxury of unsalted\nmud and scarcely rippled water, and the sweetness and culture of tame\ndilly-ducks, to whom their brilliant bravery, as well as an air\nof romance and billowy peril, commends them too seductively. The\nresponsible sire of the pond is grieved, sinks his unappreciated bill\ninto his back, and vainly reflects upon the vanity of love.\n\nFrom a loftier point of view, however, this is a fine provision; and Mr.\nMordacks always took a lofty view of everything.\n\n\"A beautiful duck, ma'am; a very grand duck!\" in his usual loud and\nmasterful tone, he exclaimed to Widow Precious. \"I understand your\nquestion now as to my ability to pay for him. Madam, he is worth a man's\nlast shilling. A goose is a smaller and a coarser bird. In what manner\ndo you get them?\"\n\n\"They gets their own sells, wi' the will of the Lord. What will your\nWarship be for ating, come after?\"\n\n\"None of your puddings and pies, if you please, nor your excellent\njellies and custards. A red Dutch cheese, with a pat of fresh butter,\nand another imperial pint of ale.\"\n\n\"Now yon is what I call a man,\" thought Mrs. Precious, having neither\npie nor pudding, as Master Mordacks was well aware; \"aisy to please,\nand a' knoweth what a' wants. A' mought 'a been born i' Flaambro. A' maa\nbaide for a week, if a' hath the tokkins.\"\n\nMr. Mordacks felt that he had made his footing; but he was not the man\nto abide for a week where a day would suit his purpose. His rule was\nnever to beat about the bush when he could break through it, and he\nthought that he saw his way to do so now. Having finished his meal,\nhe set down his knife with a bang, sat upright in the oaken chair, and\ngazed in a bold yet pleasant manner at the sturdy hostess.\n\n\"You are wondering what has brought me here. That I will tell you in\na very few words. Whatever I do is straightforward, madam; and all the\nworld may know it. That has been my character throughout life; and in\nthat respect I differ from the great bulk of mankind. You Flamborough\nfolk, however, are much of the very same nature as I am. We ought to\nget on well together. Times are very bad--very bad indeed. I could put\na good trifle of money in your way; but you tell the truth without\nit, which is very, very noble. Yet people with a family have duties to\ndischarge to them, and must sacrifice their feelings to affection. Fifty\nguineas is a tidy little figure, ma'am. With the famine growing in the\nland, no parent should turn his honest back upon fifty guineas. And\nto get the gold, and do good at the same time, is a very rare chance\nindeed.\"\n\nThis speech was too much for Widow Precious to carry to her settled\njudgment, and get verdict in a breath. She liked it, on the whole, but\nyet there might be many things upon the other side; so she did what\nFlamborough generally does, when desirous to consider things, as it\ngenerally is. That is to say, she stood with her feet well apart, and\nher arms akimbo, and her head thrown back to give the hinder part a\nrest, and no sign of speculation in her eyes, although they certainly\nwere not dull. When these good people are in this frame of mind and\nbody, it is hard to say whether they look more wise or foolish. Mr.\nMordacks, impatient as he was, even after so fine a dinner, was not far\nfrom catching the infection of slow thought, which spreads itself as\npleasantly as that of slow discourse.\n\n\"You are heeding me, madam; you have quick wits,\" he said, without any\nsarcasm, for she rescued the time from waste by affording a study of the\ndeepest wisdom; \"you are wondering how the money is to come, and whether\nit brings any risk with it. No, Mistress Precious, not a particle of\nrisk. A little honest speaking is the one thing needed.\"\n\n\"The money cometh scores of times more freely fra wrong-doing.\"\n\n\"Your observation, madam, shows a deep acquaintance with the human race.\nToo often the money does come so; and thus it becomes mere mammon. On\nsuch occasions we should wash our hands, and not forget the charities.\nBut the beauty of money, fairly come by, is that we can keep it all. To\ndo good in getting it, and do good with it, and to feel ourselves better\nin every way, and our dear children happier--this is the true way of\nconsidering the question. I saw some pretty little dears peeping in, and\nwanted to give them a token or two, for I do love superior children. But\nyou called them away, madam. You are too stern.\"\n\nWidow Precious had plenty of sharp sense to tell her that her children\nwere by no means \"pretty dears\" to anybody but herself, and to herself\nonly when in a very soft state of mind; at other times they were but\nthree gew-mouthed lasses, and two looby loons with teeth enough for\ncrunching up the dripping-pan.\n\n\"Your Warship spaketh fair,\" she said; \"a'most too fair, I'm doubting.\nWad ye say what the maning is, and what name goeth pledge for the fafty\npoon, Sir?\"\n\n\"Mistress Precious, my meaning always is plainer than a pikestaff; and\nas to pledges, the pledge is the hard cash down upon the nail, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Bank-tokkins, mayhap, and I prummeese to paa, with the sign of the\nDragon, and a woman among sheeps.\"\n\n\"Madam, a bag of solid gold that can be weighed and counted. Fifty new\nguineas from the mint of King George, in a water-proof bag just fit to\nbe buried at the foot of a tree, or well under the thatch, or sewn up\nin the sacking of your bedstead, ma'am. Ah, pretty dreams, what pretty\ndreams, with a virtuous knowledge of having done the right! Shall we say\nit is a bargain, ma'am, and wet it with a glass, at my expense, of the\ncrystal spring that comes under the sea?\"\n\n\"Naw, Sir, naw!--not till I knaw what. I niver trafficks with the divil,\nSir. There wur a chap of Flaambro deed--\"\n\n\"My good madam, I can not stop all day. I have far to ride before\nnight-fall. All that I want is simply this, and having gone so far, I\nmust tell you all, or make an enemy of you. I want to match this; and I\nhave reason to believe that it can be matched in Flamborough. Produce me\nthe fellow, and I pay you fifty guineas.\"\n\nWith these words Mr. Mordacks took from an inner pocket a little\npill-box, and thence produced a globe, or rather an oblate spheroid, of\nbright gold, rather larger than a musket-ball, but fluted or crenelled\nlike a poppy-head, and stamped or embossed with marks like letters.\nWidow Precious looked down at it, as if to think what an extraordinary\nthing it was, but truly to hide from the stranger her surprise at the\nsudden recognition. For Robin Lyth was a foremost favorite of hers, and\nmost useful to her vocation; and neither fifty guineas nor five hundred\nshould lead her to do him an injury. At a glance she had known that\nthis bead must belong to the set from which Robin's ear-rings came; and\nperhaps it was her conscience which helped her to suspect that a trap\nwas being laid for the free-trade hero. To recover herself, and have\ntime to think, as well as for closer discretion, she invited Master\nMordacks to the choice guest-chamber.\n\n\"Set ye doon, Sir, hereaboot,\" she said, opening a solid door into\nthe inner room; \"neaver gain no fear at aw o' crackin' o' the setties;\nfairm, fairm anoo' they be, thoo sketterish o' their lukes, Sir. Set ye\ndoon, your Warship; fafty poons desarveth a good room, wi'oot ony lugs\no' anemees.\"\n\n\"What a beautiful room!\" exclaimed Mr. Mordacks; \"and how it savors of\nthe place! I never should have thought of finding art and taste of such\ndegree in a little place like Flamborough. Why, madam, you must have\ninherited it direct from the Danes themselves.\"\n\n\"Naw, Sir, naw. I fetched it aw oop fra the breck of the say and the\ncobbles. Book-folk tooneth naw heed o' what we do.\"\n\n\"Well, it is worth a great deal of heed. Lovely patterns of sea-weed\non the floor--no carpet can compare with them; shelves of--I am sure\nI don't know what--fished up from the deep, no doubt; and shells\ninnumerable, and stones that glitter, and fish like glass, and tufts\nlike lace, and birds with most wonderful things in their mouths:\nMistress Precious, you are too bad. The whole of it ought to go to\nLondon, where they make collections!\"\n\n\"Lor, Sir, how ye da be laffin' at me. But purty maa be said of 'em\nwi'out ony lees.\"\n\nThe landlady smiled as she set for him a chair, toward which he trod\ngingerly, and picking every step, for his own sake as well as of the\ngarniture. For the black oak floor was so oiled and polished, to set\noff the pattern of the sea-flowers on it (which really were laid with no\nmean taste and no small sense of color), that for slippery boots there\nwas some peril.\n\n\"This is a sacred as well as beautiful place,\" said Mr. Mordacks. \"I may\nfinish my words with safety here. Madam, I commend your prudence as well\nas your excellent skill and industry. I should like to bring my daughter\nArabella here: what a lesson she would gain for tapestry! But now,\nagain, for business. What do you say? Unless I am mistaken, you have\nsome knowledge of the matter depending on this bauble. You must not\nsuppose that I came to you at random. No, madam, no; I have heard far\naway of your great intelligence, caution, and skill, and influence in\nthis important town. 'Mistress Precious is the Mayor of Flamborough,'\nwas said to me only last Saturday; 'if you would study the wise people\nthere, hang up your hat in her noble hostelry.' Madam, I have taken that\nadvice, and heartily rejoice at doing so. I am a man of few words,\nvery few words--as you must have seen already--but of the strictest\nstraightforwardness in deeds. And now again, what do you say, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Your Warship hath left ma nowt to saa. Your Warship hath had the mooth\naw to yosell.\"\n\n\"Now Mistress, Mistress Precious, truly that is a little too bad of you.\nIt is out of my power to help admiring things which are utterly beyond\nme to describe, and a dinner of such cooking may enlarge the tongue,\nafter all the fine things it has been rolling in. But business is my\nmotto, in the fewest words that may be. You know what I want; you will\nkeep it to yourself, otherwise other people might demand the money.\nThrough very simple channels you will find out whether the fellow thing\nto this can be found here or elsewhere; and if so, who has got it, and\nhow it was come by, and everything else that can be learned about it;\nand when you know all, you just make a mark on this piece of paper,\nready folded and addressed; and then you will seal it, and give it to\nthe man who calls for the letters nearly twice a week. And when I get\nthat, I come and eat another duck, and have oysters with my cod-fish,\nwhich to-day we could not have, except in the form of mussels, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Naw, not a moosel--they was aw gude flithers.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, they may have been unknown animals; but good they were,\nand as fresh as the day. Now, you will remember that my desire is to do\ngood. I have nothing to do with the revenue, nor the magistrates,\nnor his Majesty. I shall not even go to your parson, who is the chief\nauthority, I am told; for I wish this matter to be kept quiet, and\nbeside the law altogether. The whole credit of it shall belong to you,\nand a truly good action you will have performed, and done a little good\nfor your own good self. As for this trinket, I do not leave it with you,\nbut I leave you this model in wax, ma'am, made by my daughter, who is\nvery clever. From this you can judge quite as well as from the other.\nIf there are any more of these things in Flamborough, as I have strong\nreason to believe, you will know best where to find them, and I need\nnot tell you that they are almost certain to be in the possession of a\nwoman. You know all the women, and you skillfully inquire, without even\nletting them suspect it. Now I shall just stretch my legs a little,\nand look at your noble prospect, and in three hours' time a little\nmore refreshment, and then, Mistress Precious, you see the last of your\nobedient servant, until you demand from him fifty gold guineas.\"\n\nAfter seeing to his horse again, he set forth for a stroll, in the\ncourse of which he met with Dr. Upround and his daughter. The rector\nlooked hard at this distinguished stranger, as if he desired to know\nhis name, and expected to be accosted by him, while quick Miss Janetta\nglanced with undisguised suspicion, and asked her father, so that Mr.\nMordacks overheard it, what business such a man could have, and what\ncould he come spying after, in their quiet parish? The general factor\nraised his hat, and passed on with a tranquil smile, taking the crooked\npath which leads along and around the cliffs, by way of the light-house,\nfrom the north to the southern landing. The present light-house was not\nyet built, but an old round tower, which still exists, had long been\nused as a signal station, for semaphore by day, and at night for\nbeacon, in the times of war and tumult; and most people called it the\n\"Monument.\" This station was now of very small importance, and sometimes\ndid nothing for a year together; but still it was very good and useful,\nbecause it enabled an ancient tar, whose feet had been carried away by\na cannon-ball, to draw a little money once a month, and to think himself\nstill a fine British bulwark.\n\nIn the summer-time this hero always slung his hammock here, with plenty\nof wind to rock him off to sleep, but in winter King AEolus himself\ncould not have borne it. \"Monument Joe,\" as almost everybody called him,\nwas a queer old character of days gone by. Sturdy and silent, but as\nhonest as the sun, he made his rounds as regularly as that great orb,\nand with equally beneficent object. For twice a day he stumped to fetch\nhis beer from Widow Precious, and the third time to get his little\npannikin of grog. And now the time was growing for that last important\nduty, when a stranger stood before him with a crown piece in his hand.\n\n\"Now don't get up, captain, don't disturb yourself,\" said Mr. Mordacks,\ngraciously; \"your country has claimed your activity, I see, and I hope\nit makes amends to you. At the same time I know that it very seldom\ndoes. Accept this little tribute from the admiration of a friend.\"\n\nOld Joe took the silver piece and rung it on his tin tobacco-box, then\nstowed it inside, and said, \"Gammon! What d'ye want of me?\"\n\n\"Your manners, my good Sir, are scarcely on a par with your merits.\nI bribe no man; it is the last thing I would ever dream of doing. But\nwhenever a question of memory arises, I have often observed a great\nfailure of that power without--without, if you will excuse the\nexpression, the administration of a little grease.\"\n\n\"Smooggling? Aught about smooggling?\" Old Joe shut his mouth sternly;\nfor he hated and scorned the coast-guards, whose wages were shamefully\nabove his own, and who had the impudence to order him for signals;\nwhile, on the other hand, he found free trade a policy liberal,\nenlightening, and inspiriting.\n\n\"No, captain, no; not a syllable of that. You have been in this place\nabout sixteen years. If you had only been here four years more, your\nevidence would have settled all I want to know. No wreck can take place\nhere, of course, without your knowledge?\"\n\n\"Dunno that. B'lieve one have. There's a twist of the tide here--but\nwhat good to tell landlubbers?\"\n\n\"You are right. I should never understand such things. But I find them\nwonderfully interesting. You are not a native of this place, and knew\nnothing of Flamborough before you came here?\"\n\nMonument Joe gave a grunt at this, and a long squirt of tobacco juice.\n\"And don't want,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course, you are superior, in every way superior. You find these\npeople rough, and far inferior in manners. But either, my good friend,\nyou will re-open your tobacco-box, or else you will answer me a few\nshort questions, which trespass in no way upon your duty to the king, or\nto his loyal smugglers.\"\n\nOld Joe looked up, with weather-beaten eyes, and saw that he had no\nfool to deal with, in spite of all soft palaver. The intensity of Mr.\nMordacks's eyes made him blink, and mutter a bad word or two, but remain\npretty much at his service. And the last intention he could entertain\nwas that of restoring this fine crown piece. \"Spake on, Sir,\" he said;\n\"and I will spake accordin'.\"\n\n\"Very good. I shall give you very little trouble. I wish to know whether\nthere was any wreck here, kept quiet perhaps, but still some ship lost,\nabout three or four years before you came to this station. It does not\nmatter what ship, any ship at all, which may have gone down without any\nfuss at all. You know of none such? Very well. You were not here; and\nthe people of this place are wonderfully close. But a veteran of the\nRoyal Navy should know how to deal with them. Make your inquiries\nwithout seeming to inquire. The question is altogether private, and\ncan not in any way bring you into trouble. Whereas, if you find out\nanything, you will be a made man, and live like a gentleman. You hate\nthe lawyers? All the honest seamen do. I am not a lawyer, and my object\nis to fire a broadside into them. Accept this guinea; and if it would\nsuit you to have one every week for the rest of your life, I will pledge\nyou my word for it, paid in advance, if you only find out for me one\nlittle fact, of which I have no doubt whatever, that a merchant ship was\ncast away near this Head just about nineteen years agone.\"\n\nThat ancient sailor was accustomed to surprises; but this, as he said,\nwhen he came to think of it, made a clean sweep of him, fore and aft.\nNevertheless, he had the presence of mind required for pocketing the\nguinea, which was too good for his tobacco-box; and as one thing at a\ntime was quite enough upon his mind, he probed away slowly, to be sure\nthere was no hole. Then he got up from his squatting form, with the\nusual activity of those who are supposed to have none left, and touched\nhis brown hat, standing cleverly. \"What be I to do for all this?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Nothing more than what I have told you. To find out slowly, and without\nsaying why, in the way you sailors know how to do, whether such a thing\ncame to pass, as I suppose. You must not be stopped by the lies of\nanybody. Of course they will deny it, if they got some of the wrecking;\nor it is just possible that no one even heard of it; and yet there may\nbe some traces. Put two and two together, my good friend, as you have\nthe very best chance of doing; and soon you may put two to that in your\npocket, and twenty, and a hundred, and as much as you can hold.\"\n\n\"When shall I see your good honor again, to score log-run, and come to a\nreckoning?\"\n\n\"Master Joseph, work a wary course. Your rating for life will depend\nupon that. You may come to this address, if you have anything important.\nOtherwise you shall soon hear of me again. Good-by.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nGOYLE BAY\n\n\nWhile all the world was at cross-purposes thus--Mr. Jellicorse uneasy at\nsome rumors he had heard; Captain Carroway splitting his poor heel with\nindignation at the craftiness of free-traders; Farmer Anerley vexed at\nbeing put upon by people, without any daughter to console him, or catch\nshrimps; Master Mordacks pursuing a noble game, strictly above-board, as\nusual; Robin Lyth troubled in his largest principles of revolt against\nrevenue by a nasty little pain that kept going to his heart, with an\nemptiness there, as for another heart; and last, and perhaps of all\nmost important, the rector perpetually pining for his game of chess, and\nutterly discontented with the frigid embraces of analysis--where was the\nbest, and most simple, and least selfish of the whole lot, Mary Anerley?\n\nMary was in as good a place as even she was worthy of. A place not by\nany means so snug and favored by nature as Anerley Farm, but pretty\nwell sheltered by large trees of a strong and hardy order. And the\ncomfortable ways of good old folk, who needed no labor to live by spread\na happy leisure and a gentle ease upon everything under their roof-tree.\nHere was no necessity for getting up until the sun encouraged it; and\nthe time for going to bed depended upon the time of sleepiness. Old\nJohnny Popplewell, as everybody called him, without any protest on his\npart, had made a good pocket by the tanning business, and having no\nchildren to bring up to it, and only his wife to depend upon him, had\nsold the good-will, the yard, and the stock as soon as he had turned his\nsixtieth year. \"I have worked hard all my life,\" he said, \"and I mean to\nrest for the rest of it.\"\n\nAt first he was heartily miserable, and wandered about with a vacant\nlook, having only himself to look after. And he tried to find a hole in\nhis bargain with the man who enjoyed all the smells he was accustomed\nto, and might even be heard through a gap in the fence rating the men\nas old Johnny used to do, at the same time of day, and for the same\nneglect, and almost in the self-same words which the old owner used, but\nstronger. Instead of being happy, Master Popplewell lost more flesh in a\nmonth than he used to lay on in the most prosperous year; and he owed\nit to his wife, no doubt, as generally happens, that he was not speedily\ngathered to the bosom of the hospitable Simon of Joppa. For Mrs.\nPopplewell said, \"Go away; Johnny, go away from this village; smell\nnew smells, and never see a hide without a walking thing inside of it.\nSea-weed smells almost as nice as tan; though of course it is not so\nwholesome.\" The tanner obeyed, and bought a snug little place about ten\nmiles from the old premises, which he called, at the suggestion of the\nparson, \"Byrsa Cottage.\"\n\nHere was Mary, as blithe as a lark, and as petted as a robin-redbreast,\nby no means pining, or even hankering, for any other robin. She was not\nthe girl to give her heart before it was even asked for; and hitherto\nshe had regarded the smuggler with pity more than admiration. For in\nmany points she was like her father, whom she loved foremost of the\nworld; and Master Anerley was a law-abiding man, like every other\ntrue Englishman. Her uncle Popplewell was also such, but exerted his\nprinciples less strictly. Moreover, he was greatly under influence of\nwife, which happens more freely to a man without children, the which are\na source of contradiction. And Mistress Popplewell was a most thorough\nand conscientious free-trader.\n\nNow Mary was from childhood so accustomed to the sea, and the relish\nof salt breezes, and the racy dance of little waves that crowd on one\nanother, and the tidal delivery of delightful rubbish, that to fail\nof seeing the many works and plays and constant variance of her never\nwearying or weary friend was more than she could long put up with. She\ncalled upon Lord Keppel almost every day, having brought him from home\nfor the good of his health, to gird up his loins, or rather get his\nbelly girths on, and come along the sands with her, and dig into new\nplaces. But he, though delighted for a while with Byrsa stable, and\nthe social charms of Master Popplewell's old cob, and a rick of fine\ntan-colored clover hay and bean haulm, when the novelty of these\ndelights was passed, he pined for his home, and the split in his crib,\nand the knot of hard wood he had polished with his neck, and even the\nlittle dog that snapped at him. He did not care for retired people--as\nhe said to the cob every evening--he liked to see farm-work going on, or\nat any rate to hear all about it, and to listen to horses who had worked\nhard, and could scarcely speak, for chewing, about the great quantity\nthey had turned of earth, and how they had answered very bad words with\na bow. In short, to put it in the mildest terms, Lord Keppel was giving\nhimself great airs, unworthy of his age, ungrateful to a degree, and\nungraceful, as the cob said repeatedly; considering how he was fed, and\nbedded, and not a thing left undone for him. But his arrogance soon had\nto pay its own costs.\n\nFor, away to the right of Byrsa Cottage, as you look down the hollow\nof the ground toward the sea, a ridge of high scrubby land runs up to\na forefront of bold cliff, indented with a dark and narrow bay. \"Goyle\nBay,\" as it is called, or sometimes \"Basin Bay,\" is a lonely and rugged\nplace, and even dangerous for unwary visitors. For at low spring tides\na deep hollow is left dry, rather more than a quarter of a mile across,\nstrewn with kelp and oozy stones, among which may often be found pretty\nshells, weeds richly tinted and of subtle workmanship, stars, and\nflowers, and love-knots of the sea, and sometimes carnelians and\ncrystals. But anybody making a collection here should be able to keep\none eye upward and one down, or else in his pocket to have two things--a\ngood watch and a trusty tide-table.\n\nJohn and Deborah Popplewell were accustomed to water in small supplies,\nsuch as that of a well, or a road-side pond, or their own old noble\ntan-pits; but to understand the sea it was too late in life, though it\npleased them, and gave them fine appetites now to go down when it was\nperfectly calm, and a sailor assured them that the tide was mild. But\neven at such seasons they preferred to keep their distance, and called\nout frequently to one another. They looked upon their niece, from all\nshe told them, as a creature almost amphibious; but still they were\noften uneasy about her, and would gladly have kept her well inland. She,\nhowever, laughed at any such idea; and their discipline was to let her\nhave her own way. But now a thing happened which proved forever how much\nbetter old heads are than young ones.\n\nFor Mary, being tired of the quiet places, and the strands where she\nknew every pebble, resolved to explore Goyle Bay at last, and she chose\nthe worst possible time for it. The weather had been very fine and\ngentle, and the sea delightfully plausible, without a wave--tide after\ntide--bigger than the furrow of a two-horse plough; and the maid began\nto believe at last that there never were any storms just here. She had\nheard of the pretty things in Goyle Bay, which was difficult of access\nfrom the land, but she resolved to take opportunity of tide, and thus\ncircumvent the position; she would rather have done it afoot, but her\nuncle and aunt made a point of her riding to the shore, regarding the\npony as a safe companion, and sure refuge from the waves. And so, upon\nthe morning of St. Michael, she compelled Lord Keppel, with an adverse\nmind, to turn a headland they had never turned before.\n\nThe tide was far out and ebbing still, but the wind had shifted, and was\nblowing from the east rather stiffly, and with increasing force. Mary\nknew that the strong equinoctial tides were running at their height; but\nshe had timed her visit carefully, as she thought, with no less than an\nhour and a half to spare. And even without any thought of tide, she was\nbound to be back in less time than that, for her uncle had been most\nparticular to warn her to be home without fail at one o'clock, when the\nsacred goose, to which he always paid his duties, would be on the table.\nAnd if anything marred his serenity of mind, it was to have dinner kept\nwaiting.\n\nWithout any misgivings, she rode into Basin Bay, keeping within the\nblack barrier of rocks, outside of which wet sands were shining. She\nsaw that these rocks, like the bar of a river, crossed the inlet of\nthe cove; but she had not been told of their peculiar frame and upshot,\nwhich made them so treacherous a rampart. At the mouth of the bay they\nformed a level crescent, as even as a set of good teeth, against the\nsea, with a slope of sand running up to their outer front, but a deep\nand long pit inside of them. This pit drained itself very nearly dry\nwhen the sea went away from it, through some stony tubes which only\nworked one way, by the closure of their mouths when the tide returned;\nso that the volume of the deep sometimes, with tide and wind behind it,\nleaped over the brim into the pit, with tenfold the roar, a thousandfold\nthe power, and scarcely less than the speed, of a lion.\n\nMary Anerley thought what a lovely place it was, so deep and secluded\nfrom anybody's sight, and full of bright wet colors. Her pony refused,\nwith his usual wisdom, to be dragged to the bottom of the hole, but she\nmade him come further down than he thought just, and pegged him by\nthe bridle there. He looked at her sadly, and with half a mind to\nexpostulate more forcibly, but getting no glimpse of the sea where he\nstood, he thought it as well to put up with it; and presently he snorted\nout a tribe of little creatures, which puzzled him and took up his\nattention.\n\nMeanwhile Mary was not only puzzled, but delighted beyond description.\nShe never yet had come upon such treasures of the sea, and she scarcely\nknew what to lay hands upon first. She wanted the weeds of such\nwonderful forms, and colors yet more exquisite, and she wanted the\nshells of such delicate fabric that fairies must have made them, and a\nthousand other little things that had no names; and then she seemed most\nof all to want the pebbles. For the light came through them in stripes\nand patterns, and many of them looked like downright jewels. She had\nbrought a great bag of strong canvas, luckily, and with both hands she\nset to to fill it.\n\nSo busy was the girl with the vast delight of sanguine acquisition--this\nfor her father, and that for her mother, and so much for everybody she\ncould think of--that time had no time to be counted at all, but flew\nby with feathers unheeded. The mutter of the sea became a roar, and the\nbreeze waxed into a heavy gale, and spray began to sputter through the\nair like suds; but Mary saw the rampart of the rocks before her, and\nthought that she could easily get back around the point. And her taste\nbegan continually to grow more choice, so that she spent as much time\nin discarding the rubbish which at first she had prized so highly as\nshe did in collecting the real rarities, which she was learning to\ndistinguish. But unluckily the sea made no allowance for all this.\n\nFor just as Mary, with her bag quite full, was stooping with a long\nstretch to get something more--a thing that perhaps was the very best of\nall, and therefore had got into a corner--there fell upon her back quite\na solid lump of wave, as a horse gets the bottom of the bucket cast at\nhim. This made her look up, not a minute too soon; and even then she was\nnot at all aware of danger, but took it for a notice to be moving.\nAnd she thought more of shaking that saltwater from her dress than of\nrunning away from the rest of it.\n\nBut as soon as she began to look about in earnest, sweeping back her\nsalted hair, she saw enough of peril to turn pale the roses and strike\naway the smile upon her very busy face. She was standing several yards\nbelow the level of the sea, and great surges were hurrying to swallow\nher. The hollow of the rocks received the first billow with a thump and\na slush, and a rush of pointed hillocks in a fury to find their way back\nagain, which failing, they spread into a long white pool, taking Mary\nabove her pretty ankles. \"Don't you think to frighten me,\" said Mary; \"I\nknow all your ways, and I mean to take my time.\"\n\nBut even before she had finished her words, a great black wall (doubled\nover at the top with whiteness, that seemed to race along it like a\nfringe) hung above the rampart, and leaped over, casting at Mary such a\nvolley that she fell. This quenched her last audacity, although she was\nnot hurt; and jumping up nimbly, she made all haste through the rising\nwater toward her pony. But as she would not forsake her bag, and the\nrocks became more and more slippery, towering higher and higher surges\ncrashed in over the barrier, and swelled the yeasty turmoil which began\nto fill the basin; while a scurry of foam flew like pellets from the\nrampart, blinding even the very best young eyes.\n\nMary began to lose some of her presence of mind and familiar approval\nof the sea. She could swim pretty well, from her frequent bathing; but\nswimming would be of little service here, if once the great rollers\ncame over the bar, which they threatened to do every moment. And when at\nlength she fought her way to the poor old pony, her danger and distress\nwere multiplied. Lord Keppel was in a state of abject fear; despair was\nknocking at his fine old heart; he was up to his knees in the loathsome\nbrine already, and being so twisted up by his own exertions that to\nbudge another inch was beyond him, he did what a horse is apt to do in\nsuch condition--he consoled himself with fatalism. He meant to expire;\nbut before he did so he determined to make his mistress feel what she\nhad done. Therefore, with a sad nudge of white old nose, he drew her\nattention to his last expression, sighed as plainly as a man could sigh,\nand fixed upon her meek eyes, telling volumes.\n\n\"I know, I know that it is all my fault,\" cried Mary, with the brine\nalmost smothering her tears, as she flung her arms around his neck; \"but\nI never will do it again, my darling. And I never will run away and let\nyou drown. Oh, if I only had a knife! I can not even cast your bridle\noff; the tongue has stuck fast, and my hands are cramped. But, Keppel, I\nwill stay, and be drowned with you.\"\n\nThis resolve was quite unworthy of Mary's common-sense; for how could\nher being drowned with Keppel help him? However, the mere conception\nshowed a spirit of lofty order; though the body might object to be\nordered under. Without any thought of all that, she stood, resolute,\ntearful, and thoroughly wet through, while she hunted in her pocket for\na penknife.\n\nThe nature of all knives is, not to be found; and Mary's knife was loyal\nto its kind. Then she tugged at her pony, and pulled out his bit, and\nlabored again at the obstinate strap; but nothing could be done with it.\nKeppel must be drowned, and he did not seem to care, but to think that\nthe object of his birth was that. If the stupid little fellow would\nhave only stepped forward, the hands of his mistress, though cramped and\nbenumbed, might perhaps have unbuckled his stiff and sodden reins, or\neven undone their tangle; on the other hand, if he would have jerked\nwith all his might, something or other must have given way; but stir he\nwould not from one fatuous position, which kept all his head-gear on the\nstrain, but could not snap it. Mary even struck him with her heavy bag\nof stones, to make him do something; but he only looked reproachful.\n\n\"Was there ever such a stupid?\" the poor girl cried, with the water\nrising almost to her waist, and the inner waves beginning to dash over\nher, while the outer billows threatened to rush in and crush them both.\n\"But I will not abuse you any more, poor Keppel. What will dear father\nsay? Oh, what will he think of it?\"\n\nThen she burst into a fit of sobs, and leaned against the pony, to\nsupport her from a rushing wave which took her breath away, and she\nthought that she would never try to look up any more, but shut her eyes\nto all the rest of it. But suddenly she heard a loud shout and a splash,\nand found herself caught up and carried like an infant.\n\n\"Lie still. Never mind the pony: what is he? I will go for him\nafterward. You first, you first of all the world, my Mary.\"\n\nShe tried to speak, but not a word would come; and that was all the\nbetter. She was carried quick as might be through a whirl of tossing\nwaters, and gently laid upon a pile of kelp; and then Robin Lyth said,\n\"You are quite safe here, for at least another hour. I will go and get\nyour pony.\"\n\n\"No, no; you will be knocked to pieces,\" she cried; for the pony, in the\ndrift and scud, could scarcely be seen but for his helpless struggles.\nBut the young man was half way toward him while she spoke, and she knelt\nupon the kelp, and clasped her hands.\n\nNow Robin was at home in a matter such as this. He had landed many kegs\nin a sea as strong or stronger, and he knew how to deal with the horses\nin a surf. There still was a break of almost a fathom in the level of\nthe inner and the outer waves, for the basin was so large that it could\nnot fill at once; and so long as this lasted, every roller must comb\nover at the entrance, and mainly spend itself. \"At least five minutes to\nspare,\" he shouted back, \"and there is no such thing as any danger.\" But\nthe girl did not believe him.\n\nRapidly and skillfully he made his way, meeting the larger waves\nsideways, and rising at their onset; until he was obliged to swim at\nlast where the little horse was swimming desperately. The leather,\nstill jammed in some crevice at the bottom, was jerking his poor chin\ndownward; his eyes were screwed up like a new-born kitten's, and his\ndainty nose looked like a jelly-fish. He thought how sad it was that\nhe should ever die like this, after all the good works of his life--the\npeople he had carried, and the chaise that he had drawn, and all his\nkindness to mankind. Then he turned his head away to receive the stroke\nof grace, which the next wave would administer.\n\nNo! He was free. He could turn his honest tail on the sea, which he\nalways had detested so; he could toss up his nose and blow the filthy\nsalt out, and sputter back his scorn, while he made off for his life.\nSo intent was he on this that he never looked twice to make out who his\nbenefactor was, but gave him just a taste of his hind-foot on the\nelbow, in the scuffle of his hurry to be round about and off. \"Such is\ngratitude!\" the smuggler cried; but a clot of salt-water flipped into\nhis mouth, and closed all cynical outlet. Bearing up against the waves,\nhe stowed his long knife away, and then struck off for the shore with\nmight and main.\n\nHere Mary ran into the water to meet him, shivering as she was with\nfright and cold, and stretched out both hands to him as he waded forth;\nand he took them and clasped them, quite as if he needed help. Lord\nKeppel stood afar off, recovering his breath, and scarcely dared to look\naskance at the execrable sea.\n\n\"How cold you are!\" Robin Lyth exclaimed. \"You must not stay a moment.\nNo talking, if you please--though I love your voice so. You are not\nsafe yet. You can not get back round the point. See the waves dashing\nup against it! You must climb the cliff, and that is no easy job for a\nlady, in the best of weather. In a couple of hours the tide will be\nover the whole of this beach a fathom deep. There is no boat nearer than\nFiley; and a boat could scarcely live over that bar. You must climb the\ncliff, and begin at once, before you get any colder.\"\n\n\"Then is my poor pony to be drowned, after all? If he is, he had better\nhave been drowned at once.\"\n\nThe smuggler looked at her with a smile, which meant, \"Your gratitude\nis about the same as his;\" but he answered, to assure her, though by no\nmeans sure himself:\n\n\"There is time enough for him; he shall not be drowned. But you must be\ngot out of danger first. When you are off my mind, I will fetch up pony.\nNow you must follow me step by step, carefully and steadily. I would\ncarry you up if I could; but even a giant could scarcely do that, in a\nstiff gale of wind, and with the crag so wet.\"\n\nMary looked up with a shiver of dismay. She was brave and nimble\ngenerally, but now so wet and cold, and the steep cliff looked so\nslippery, that she said: \"It is useless; I can never get up there.\nCaptain Lyth, save yourself, and leave me.\"\n\n\"That would be a pretty thing to do!\" he replied; \"and where should I be\nafterward? I am not at the end of my devices yet. I have got a very snug\nlittle crane up there. It was here we ran our last lot, and beat the\nbrave lieutenant so. But unluckily I have no cave just here. None of my\nlads are about here now, or we would make short work of it. But I could\nhoist you very well, if you would let me.\"\n\n\"I would never think of such a thing. To come up like a keg! Captain\nLyth, you must know that I never would be so disgraced.\"\n\n\"Well, I was afraid that you might take it so, though I can not see why\nit should be any harm. We often hoist the last man so.\"\n\n\"It is different with me,\" said Mary. \"It may be no harm; but I could\nnot have it.\"\n\nThe free-trader looked at her bright eyes and color, and admired her\nspirit, which his words had roused.\n\n\"I pray your forgiveness, Miss Anerley,\" he said; \"I meant no harm. I\nwas thinking of your life. But you look now as if you could do anything\nalmost.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am warm again. I have no fear. I will not go up like a keg, but\nlike myself. I can do it without help from anybody.\"\n\n\"Only please to take care not to cut your little hands,\" said Robin, as\nhe began the climb; for he saw that her spirit was up to do it.\n\n\"My hands are not little; and I will cut them if I choose. Please not\neven to look back at me. I am not in the least afraid of anything.\"\n\nThe cliff was not of the soft and friable stuff to be found at\nBridlington, but of hard and slippery sandstone, with bulky ribs\noversaling here and there, and threatening to cast the climber back. At\nsuch spots nicks for the feet had been cut, or broken with a hammer, but\nscarcely wider than a stirrup-iron, and far less inviting. To surmount\nthese was quite impossible except by a process of crawling; and Mary,\nwith her heart in her mouth, repented of her rash contempt for the crane\nsling. Luckily the height was not very great, or, tired as she was, she\nmust have given way; for her bodily warmth had waned again in the strong\nwind buffeting the cliff. Otherwise the wind had helped her greatly by\nkeeping her from swaying outward; but her courage began to fail at last,\nand very near the top she called for help. A short piece of lanyard was\nthrown to her at once, and Robin Lyth landed her on the bluff, panting,\nbreathless, and blushing again.\n\n\"Well done!\" he cried, gazing as she turned her face away. \"Young ladies\nmay teach even sailors to climb. Not every sailor could get up this\ncliff. Now back to Master Popplewell's as fast as you can run, and your\naunt will know what to do with you.\"\n\n\"You seem well acquainted with my family affairs,\" said Mary, who could\nnot help smiling. \"Pray how did you even know where I am staying?\"\n\n\"Little birds tell me everything, especially about the best, and most\ngentle, and beautiful of all birds.\"\n\nThe maiden was inclined to be vexed; but remembering how much he had\ndone, and how little gratitude she had shown, she forgave him, and asked\nhim to come to the cottage.\n\n\"I will bring up the little horse. Have no fear,\" he replied. \"I will\nnot come up at all unless I bring him. But it may take two or three\nhours.\"\n\nWith no more than a wave of his hat, he set off, as if the coast-riders\nwere after him, by the path along the cliffs toward Filey, for he knew\nthat Lord Keppel must be hoisted by the crane, and he could not manage\nit without another man, and the tide would wait for none of them. Upon\nthe next headland he found one of his men, for the smugglers maintained\na much sharper look-out than did the forces of his Majesty, because they\nwere paid much better; and returning, they managed to strap Lord Keppel,\nand hoist him like a big bale of contraband goods. For their crane had\nbeen left in a brambled hole, and they very soon rigged it out again.\nThe little horse kicked pretty freely in the air, not perceiving his own\nwelfare; but a cross-beam and pulley kept him well out from the cliff,\nand they swung him in over handsomely, and landed him well up on the\nsward within the brink. Then they gave him three cheers for his great\nadventure, which he scarcely seemed to appreciate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA FARM TO LET\n\n\nThat storm on the festival of St. Michael broke up the short summer\nweather of the north. A wet and tempestuous month set in, and the\nharvest, in all but the very best places, lay flat on the ground,\nwithout scythe or sickle. The men of the Riding were not disturbed by\nthis, as farmers would have been in Suffolk; for these were quite used\nto walk over their crops, without much occasion to lift their feet. They\nalways expected their corn to be laid, and would have been afraid of it\nif it stood upright. Even at Anerley Farm this salam of the wheat was\nexpected in bad seasons; and it suited the reapers of the neighborhood,\nwho scarcely knew what to make of knees unbent, and upright discipline\nof stiff-cravated ranks.\n\nIn the northwest corner of the county, where the rocky land was mantled\nso frequently with cloud, and the prevalence of western winds bore sway,\nan upright harvest was a thing to talk of, as the legend of a century,\ncredible because it scarcely could have been imagined. And this year it\nwould have been hard to imagine any more prostrate and lowly position\nthan that of every kind of crop. The bright weather of August and\nattentions of the sun, and gentle surprise of rich dews in the morning,\ntogether with abundance of moisture underneath, had made things look as\nthey scarcely ever looked--clean, and straight, and elegant. But none of\nthem had found time to form the dry and solid substance, without which\nneither man nor his staff of life can stand against adversity.\n\n\"My Lady Philippa,\" as the tenants called her, came out one day to see\nhow things looked, and whether the tenants were likely to pay their\nMichaelmas rents at Christmas. Her sister, Mrs. Carnaby, felt like\ninterest in the question, but hated long walks, being weaker and less\nactive, and therefore rode a quiet pony. Very little wheat was grown on\ntheir estates, both soil and climate declining it; but the barley crop\nwas of more importance, and flourished pretty well upon the southern\nslopes. The land, as a rule, was poor and shallow, and nourished more\ngrouse than partridges; but here and there valleys of soft shelter and\nfair soil relieved the eye and comforted the pocket of the owner. These\nlittle bits of Goshen formed the heart of every farm; though oftentimes\nthe homestead was, as if by some perversity, set up in bleak and barren\nspots, outside of comfort's elbow.\n\nThe ladies marched on, without much heed of any other point than\none--would the barley crop do well? They had many tenants who trusted\nchiefly to that, and to the rough hill oats, and wool, to make up in\ncoin what part of their rent they were not allowed to pay in kind.\nFor as yet machinery and reeking factories had not besmirched the\ncountry-side.\n\n\"How much further do you mean to go, Philippa?\" asked Mrs. Carnaby,\nalthough she was not travelling by virtue of her own legs. \"For my part,\nI think we have gone too far already.\"\n\n\"Your ambition is always to turn back. You may turn back now if you\nlike. I shall go on.\" Miss Yordas knew that her sister would fail of the\ncourage to ride home all alone.\n\nMrs. Carnaby never would ride without Jordas or some other serving-man\nbehind her, as was right and usual for a lady of her position; but \"Lady\nPhilippa\" was of bolder strain, and cared for nobody's thoughts, words,\nor deeds. And she had ordered her sister's servant back for certain\nreasons of her own.\n\n\"Very well, very well. You always will go on, and always on the road you\nchoose yourself. Although it requires a vast deal of knowledge to know\nthat there is any road here at all.\"\n\nThe widow, who looked very comely for her age, and sat her pony\nprettily, gave way (as usual) to the stronger will; though she always\nliked to enter protest, which the elder scarcely ever deigned to notice.\nBut hearing that Eliza had a little cough at night, and knowing that\nher appetite had not been as it ought to be, Philippa (who really was\nwrapped up in her sister, but never or seldom let her dream of such a\nfact) turned round graciously and said:\n\n\"I have ordered the carriage here for half past three o'clock. We will\ngo back by the Scarbend road, and Heartsease can trot behind us.\"\n\n\"Heartsease, uneasy you have kept my heart by your shufflings and\ntrippings perpetual. Philippa, I want a better-stepping pony. Pet has\nruined Heartsease.\"\n\n\"Pet ruins everything and everybody; and you are ruining him, Eliza. I\nam the only one who has the smallest power over him. And he is beginning\nto cast off that. If it comes to open war between us, I shall be sorry\nfor Lancelot.\"\n\n\"And I shall be sorry for you, Philippa. In a few years Pet will be\na man. And a man is always stronger than a woman; at any rate in our\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Stronger than such as you, Eliza. But let him only rebel against me,\nand he will find himself an outcast. And to prove that, I have brought\nyou here.\"\n\nMistress Yordas turned round, and looked in a well-known manner at her\nsister, whose beautiful eyes filled with tears, and fell.\n\n\"Philippa,\" she said, with a breath like a sob, \"sometimes you look\nharder than poor dear papa, in his very worst moments, used to look. I\nam sure that I do not at all deserve it. All that I pray for is peace\nand comfort; and little do I get of either.\"\n\n\"And you will get less, as long as you pray for them, instead of doing\nsomething better. The only way to get such things is to make them.\"\n\n\"Then I think that you might make enough for us both, if you had any\nregard for them, or for me, Philippa.\"\n\nMistress Yordas smiled, as she often did, at her sister's style of\nreasoning. And she cared not a jot for the last word, so long as the\nwill and the way were left to her. And in this frame of mind she turned\na corner from the open moor track into a little lane, or rather the\nexpiring delivery of a lane, which was leading a better existence\nfurther on.\n\nMrs. Carnaby followed dutifully, and Heartsease began to pick up his\nfeet, which he scorned to do upon the negligence of sward. And following\nthis good lane, they came to a gate, corded to an ancient tree, and\nshowing up its foot, as a dog does when he has a thorn in it. This gate\nseemed to stand for an ornament, or perhaps a landmark; for the lane,\ninstead of submitting to it, passed by upon either side, and plunged\ninto a dingle, where a gray old house was sheltering. The lonely\nmoorside farm--if such a wild and desolate spot could be a farm--was\nknown as \"Wallhead,\" from the relics of some ancient wall; and the\nfolk who lived there, or tried to live, although they possessed a\nsurname--which is not a necessary consequence of life--very seldom used\nit, and more rarely still had it used for them. For the ancient fashion\nstill held ground of attaching the idea of a man to that of things more\nextensive and substantial. So the head of the house was \"Will o'\nthe Wallhead;\" his son was \"Tommy o' Will o' the Wallhead;\" and his\ngrandson, \"Willy o' Tommy o' Will o' the Wallhead.\" But the one their\ngreat lady desired to see was the unmarried daughter of the house,\n\"Sally o' Will o' the Wallhead.\"\n\nMistress Yordas knew that the men of the house would be out upon the\nland at this time of day, while Sally would be full of household work,\nand preparing their homely supper. So she walked in bravely at the\nopen door, while her sister waited with the pony in the yard. Sally was\nclumping about in clog-shoes, with a child or two sprawling after her\n(for Tommy's wife was away with him at work), and if the place was not\nas clean as could be, it seemed as clean as need be.\n\nThe natives of this part are rough in manner, and apt to regard civility\nas the same thing with servility. Their bluntness does not proceed from\nthickness, as in the south of England, but from a surety of their own\nworth, and inferiority to no one. And to deal with them rightly, this\nmust be entered into.\n\nSally o' Will o' the Wallhead bobbed her solid and black curly head,\nwith a clout like a jelly on the poll of it, to the owner of their land,\nand a lady of high birth; but she vouchsafed no courtesy, neither did\nMistress Yordas expect one. But the active and self-contained woman set\na chair in the low dark room, which was their best, and stood waiting to\nbe spoken to.\n\n\"Sally,\" said the lady, who also possessed the Yorkshire gift of going\nto the point, \"you had a man ten years ago; you behaved badly to him,\nand he went into the Indian Company.\"\n\n\"A' deed,\" replied the maiden, without any blush, because she had been\nin the right throughout; \"and noo a' hath coom in a better moind.\"\n\n\"And you have come to know your own mind about him. You have been\nsteadfast to him for ten years. He has saved up some money, and is come\nback to marry you.\"\n\n\"I heed nane o' the brass. But my Jack is back again.\"\n\n\"His father held under us for many years. He was a thoroughly honest\nman, and paid his rent as often as he could. Would Jack like to have his\nfather's farm? It has been let to his cousin, as you know; but they have\nbeen going from bad to worse; and everything must be sold off, unless I\nstop it.\"\n\nSally was of dark Lancastrian race, with handsome features and fine\nbrown eyes. She had been a beauty ten years ago, and could still look\ncomely, when her heart was up.\n\n\"My lady,\" she said, with her heart up now, at the hope of soon having\na home of her own, and something to work for that she might keep, \"such\nwords should not pass the mouth wi'out bin meant.\"\n\nWhat she said was very different in sound, and not to be rendered in\necho by any one born far away from that country, where three dialects\nmeet and find it hard to guess what each of the others is up to.\nEnough that this is what Sally meant to say, and that Mistress Yordas\nunderstood it.\n\n\"It is not my custom to say a thing without meaning it,\" she answered;\n\"but unless it is taken up at once, it is likely to come to nothing.\nWhere is your man Jack?\"\n\n\"Jack is awaa to the minister to tell of us cooming tegither.\" Sally\nmade no blush over this, as she might have done ten years ago.\n\n\"He must be an excellent and faithful man. He shall have the farm if he\nwishes it, and can give some security at going in. Let him come and see\nJordas tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter a few more words, the lady left Sally full of gratitude, very\nlittle of which was expressed aloud, and therefore the whole was more\nlikely to work, as Mistress Yordas knew right well.\n\nThe farm was a better one than Wallhead, having some good barley land\nupon it; and Jack did not fail to present himself at Scargate upon the\nfollowing morning. But the lady of the house did not think fit herself\nto hold discourse with him. Jordas was bidden to entertain him, and find\nout how he stood in cash, and whether his character was solid; and then\nto leave him with a jug of ale, and come and report proceedings. The\ndogman discharged this duty well, being as faithful as the dogs he kept,\nand as keen a judge of human nature.\n\n\"The man hath no harm in him,\" he said, touching his hair to the ladies,\nas he entered the audit-room. \"A' hath been knocked aboot a bit in them\nwars i' Injury, and hath only one hand left; but a' can lay it upon\nfifty poon, and get surety for anither fifty.\"\n\n\"Then tell him, Jordas, that he may go to Mr. Jellicorse to-morrow,\nto see about the writings, which he must pay for. I will write full\ninstructions for Mr. Jellicorse, and you go and get your dinner; and\nthen take my letter, that he may have time to consider it. Wait a\nmoment. There are other things to be done in Middleton, and it would be\nlate for you to come back to-night, the days are drawing in so. Sleep at\nour tea-grocer's; he will put you up. Give your letter at once into the\nhands of Mr. Jellicorse, and he will get forward with the writings. Tell\nthis man Jack that he must be there before twelve o'clock to-morrow, and\nthen you can call about two o'clock, and bring back what there may be\nfor signature; and be careful of it. Eliza, I think I have set forth\nyour wishes.\"\n\n\"But, my lady, lawyers do take such a time; and who will look after\nMaster Lancelot? I fear to have my feet two moiles off here--\"\n\n\"Obey your orders, without reasoning; that is for those who give them.\nEliza, I am sure that you agree with me. Jordas, make this man clearly\nunderstand, as you can do when you take the trouble. But you first must\nclearly understand the whole yourself. I will repeat it for you.\"\n\nPhilippa Yordas went through the whole of her orders again most clearly,\nand at every one of them the dogman nodded his large head distinctly,\nand counted the nods on his fingers to make sure; for this part is\ngifted with high mathematics. And the numbers stick fast like pegs\ndriven into clay.\n\n\"Poor Jordas! Philippa, you are working him too hard. You have made\ngreat wrinkles in his forehead. Jordas, you must have no wrinkles until\nyou are married.\"\n\nWhile Mrs. Carnaby spoke so kindly, the dogman took his fingers off\ntheir numeral scale, and looked at her. By nature the two were first\ncousins, of half blood; by law and custom, and education, and vital\ninstitution, they were sundered more widely than black and white. But,\nfor all that, the dogman loved the lady, at a faithful distance.\n\n\"You seem to me now to have it clearly, Jordas,\" said the elder sister,\nlooking at him sternly, because Eliza was so soft; \"you will see that no\nmischief can be done with the dogs or horses while you are away; and\nMr. Jellicorse will give you a letter for me, to say that everything is\nright. My desire is to have things settled promptly, because your friend\nJack has been to set the banns up; and the Church is more speedy in such\nmatters than the law. Now the sooner you are off, the better.\"\n\nJordas, in his steady but by no means stupid way, considered at his\nleisure what such things could mean. He knew all the property, and the\nmany little holdings, as well as, and perhaps a great deal better than,\nif they had happened to be his own. But he never had known such a hurry\nmade before, or such a special interest shown about the letting of\nany tenement, of perhaps tenfold the value. However, he said, like a\nsensible man (and therefore to himself only), that the ways of women\nare beyond compute, and must be suitably carried out, without any\ncontradiction.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nAN OLD SOLDIER\n\n\nNow Mr. Jellicorse had been taking a careful view of everything. He\nwished to be certain of placing himself both on the righteous side and\nthe right one; and in such a case this was not to be done without much\ncircumspection. He felt himself bound to his present clients, and could\nnot even dream of deserting them; but still there are many things that\nmay be done to conciliate the adversary of one's friend, without being\nfalse to the friend himself. And some of these already were occurring to\nthe lawyer.\n\nIt was true that no adversary had as yet appeared, nor even shown token\nof existence; but some little sign of complication had arisen, and one\nserious fact was come to light. The solicitors of Sir Ulphus de Roos\n(the grandson of Sir Fursan, whose daughter had married Richard\nYordas) had pretty strong evidence, in some old letters, that a deed\nof appointment had been made by the said Richard, and Eleanor his wife,\nunder the powers of their settlement. Luckily they had not been employed\nin the matter, and possessed not so much as a draft or a letter of\ninstructions; and now it was no concern of theirs to make, or meddle, or\neven move. Neither did they know that any question could arise about it;\nfor they were a highly antiquated firm, of most rigid respectability,\nbeing legal advisers to the Chapter of York, and clerks of the\nPrerogative Court, and able to charge twice as much as almost any other\nfirm, and nearly three times as much as poor Jellicorse.\n\nMr. Jellicorse had been most skillful and wary in sounding these deep\nand silent people; for he wanted to find out how much they knew, without\nletting them suspect that there was anything to know. And he proved\nan old woman's will gratis, or at least put it down to those who could\nafford it--because nobody meant to have it proved--simply for the\nsake of getting golden contact with Messrs. Akeborum, Micklegate, and\nBrigant. Right craftily then did he fetch a young member of the firm,\nwho delighted in angling, to take his holiday at Middleton, and fish the\ngoodly Tees; and by gentle and casual discourse of gossip, in hours of\nhospitality, out of him he hooked and landed all that his firm knew of\nthe Yordas race. Young Brigant thought it natural enough that his\nhost, as the lawyer of that family, and their trusted adviser for\nfive-and-twenty years, should like to talk over things of an elder date,\nwhich now could be little more than trifles of genealogical history. He\ngot some fine fishing and good dinners, and found himself pleased with\nthe river and the town, and his very kind host and hostess; and it came\ninto his head that if Miss Emily grew up as pretty and lively as she\npromised to be, he might do worse than marry her, and open a connection\nwith such a fishing station. At any rate he left her as a \"chose in\naction,\" which might be reduced into possession some fine day.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when Jordas, after a long and muddy ride,\nsent word that he would like to see the master, for a minute or two,\nif convenient. The days were grown short, and the candles lit, and Mr.\nJellicorse was fast asleep, having had a good deal to get through that\nday, including an excellent supper. The lawyer's wife said: \"Let\nhim call in the morning. Business is over, and the office is closed.\nSusanna, your master must not be disturbed.\" But the master awoke, and\ndeclared that he would see him.\n\nCandles were set in the study, while Jordas was having a trifle of\nrefreshment; and when he came in, Mr. Jellicorse was there, with his\nspectacles on, and full of business.\n\n\"Asking of your pardon. Sir, for disturbing of you now,\" said the\ndogman, with the rain upon his tarred coat shining, in a little course\nof drainage from his great brown beard, \"my orders wur to lay this in\nyour own hand, and seek answer to-morrow by dinner-time, if may be.\"\n\n\"Master Jordas, you shall have it, if it can be. Do you know anybody who\ncan promise more than that?\"\n\n\"Plenty, Sir, to promise it, as you must know by this time; but never a\nbody to perform so much as half. But craving of your pardon again, and\nseparate, I wud foin spake a word or two of myself.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Jordas, I shall listen with great pleasure. A fine-looking\nfellow like you must have affairs. And the lady ought to make some\nsettlement. It shall all be done for you at half price.\"\n\n\"No, Sir, it is none o' that kind of thing,\" the dogman answered, with a\nsmile, as if he might have had such opportunities, but would trouble\nno lawyer about them; \"and I get too much of half price at home. It is\nabout my ladies I desire to make speech. They keep their business too\ntight, master.\"\n\n\"Jordas, you have been well taught and trained; and you are a man of\nsagacity. Tell me faithfully what you mean. It shall go no further. And\nit may be of great service to your ladies.\"\n\n\"It is not much, Master Jellicoose; and you may make less than that\nof it. But a lie shud be met and knocked doon, Sir, according to my\nopinion.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Jordas, when an action will not lie; and sometimes even\nwhere it does, it is wise to commit a defensible assault, and so to\nbecome the defendant. Jordas, you are big enough to do that.\"\n\n\"Master Jellicoose, you are a pleasant man; but you twist my maning, as\na lawyer must. They all does it, to keep their hand in. I am speaking\nof the stories, Sir, that is so much about. And I think that my ladies\nshould be told of them right out, and come forward, and lay their hands\non them. The Yordases always did wrong, of old time; but they never was\nafraid to jump on it.\"\n\n\"My friend, you speak in parables. What stories have arisen to be jumped\nupon?\"\n\n\"Well, Sir, for one thing, they do tell that the proper owner of the\nproperty is Sir Duncan, now away in India. A man hath come home who\nknows him well, and sayeth that he is like a prince out there, with\ncommand of a country twice as big as Great Britain, and they up and made\n'Sir Duncan' of him, by his duty to the king. And if he cometh home, all\nmust fall before him.\"\n\n\"Even the law of the land, I suppose, and the will of his own father.\nPretty well, so far, Jordas. And what next?\"\n\n\"Nought, Sir, nought. But I thought I wur duty-bound to tell you that.\nWhat is women before a man Yordas?\"\n\n\"My good friend, we will not despair. But you are keeping back\nsomething; I know it by your feet. You are duty-bound to tell me every\nword now, Jordas.\"\n\n\"The lawyers is the devil,\" said the dogman to himself; and being quite\nused to this reflection, Mr. Jellicorse smiled and nodded; \"but if you\nmust have it all, Sir, it is no more than this. Jack o' the Smithies,\nas is to marry Sally o' Will o' the Wallhead, is to have the lease of\nShipboro' farm, and he is the man as hath told it all.\"\n\n\"Very well. We will wish him good luck with his farm,\" Mr. Jellicorse\nanswered, cheerfully; \"and what is even rarer nowadays, I fear, good\nluck of his wife, Master Jordas.\"\n\nBut as soon as the sturdy retainer was gone, and the sound of his heavy\nboots had died away, Mr. Jellicorse shook his head very gravely, and\nsaid, as he opened and looked through his packet, which confirmed the\nwords of Jordas, \"Sad indiscretion--want of legal knowledge--headstrong\nwomen--the very way to spoil it all! My troubles are beginning, and I\nhad better go to bed.\"\n\nHis good wife seconded this wise resolve; and without further parley it\nwas put into effect, and proclaimed to be successful by a symphony of\nsnores. For this is the excellence of having other people's cares to\ncarry (with the carriage well paid), that they sit very lightly on the\nsprings of sleep. That well-balanced vehicle rolls on smoothly, without\njerk, or jar, or kick, so long as it travels over alien land.\n\nIn the morning Mr. Jellicorse was up to anything, legitimate, legal, and\nlikely to be paid for. Not that he would stir half the breadth of one\nwheat corn, even for the sake of his daily bread, from the straight and\nstrict line of integrity. He had made up his mind about that long ago,\nnot only from natural virtue, strong and dominant as that was, but also\nby dwelling on his high repute, and the solid foundations of character.\nHe scarcely knew anybody, when he came to think of it, capable of taking\nsuch a lofty course; but that simply confirmed him in his stern resolve\nto do what was right and expedient.\n\nIt was quite one o'clock before Jack o' the Smithies rang the bell to\nsee about his lease. He ought to have done it two hours sooner, if he\nmeant to become a humble tenant; and the lawyer, although he had plenty\nto do of other people's business, looked upon this as a very bad sign.\nThen he read his letter of instructions once more, and could not but\nadmire the nice brevity of these, and the skillful style of hinting much\nand declaring very little.\n\nFor after giving full particulars about the farm, and the rent, and the\ncovenants required, Mistress Yordas proceeded thus:\n\n\"The new tenant is the son of a former occupant, who proved to be a\nremarkably honest man, in a case of strong temptation. As happens too\noften with men of probity, he was misled and made bankrupt, and died\nabout twelve years ago, I think. Please to verify this by reference.\nThe late tenant was his nephew, and has never perceived the necessity of\npaying rent. We have been obliged to distrain, as you know; and I wish\nJohn Smithies to buy in what he pleases. He has saved some capital in\nIndia, where I am told that he fought most gallantly. Singular to say,\nhe has met with, and perhaps served under, our lamented and lost brother\nDuncan, of whom and his family he may give us interesting particulars.\nYou know how this neighborhood excels in idle talk, and if John Smithies\nbecomes our tenant, his discourse must be confined to his own business.\nBut he must not hesitate to impart to you any facts you may think it\nright to ask about. Jordas will bring us your answer, under seal.\"\n\n\"Skillfully put, up to that last word, which savors too much of teaching\nme my own business. Aberthaw, are you quite ready with that lease? It is\nwanted rather in a hurry.\"\n\nAs Mr. Jellicorse thought the former, and uttered the latter part of\nthese words, it was plain to see that he was fidgety. He had put on\nsuperior clothes to get up with; and the clerks had whispered to\none another that it must be his wedding day, and ought to end in a\nhalf-holiday all round, and be chalked thenceforth on the calendar;\nbut instead of being joyful and jocular, like a man who feels a saving\nProvidence over him, the lawyer was as dismal, and unsettled and\nsplenetic, as a prophet on the brink of wedlock. But the very last thing\nthat he ever dreamed of doubting was his power to turn this old soldier\ninside out.\n\nJack o' the Smithies was announced at last; and the lawyer, being vexed\nwith him for taking such a time, resolved to let him take a little\nlonger, and kept him waiting, without any bread and cheese, for nearly\nhalf an hour. The wisdom of doing this depended on the character of\nthe man, and the state of his finances. And both of these being strong\nenough to stand, to keep him so long on his legs was unwise. At last\nhe came in, a very sturdy sort of fellow, thinking no atom the less of\nhimself because some of his anatomy was honorably gone.\n\n\"Servant, Sir,\" he said, making a salute; \"I had orders to come to you\nabout a little lease.\"\n\n\"Right, my man, I remember now. You are thinking of taking to your\nfather's farm, after knocking about for some years in foreign parts. Ah,\nnothing like old England after all. And to tread the ancestral soil, and\ncherish the old associations, and to nurture a virtuous family in the\nfear of the Lord, and to be ready with the rent--\"\n\n\"Rent is too high, Sir; I must have five pounds off. It ought to be ten,\nby right. Cousin Joe has taken all out, and put nought in.\"\n\n\"John o' the Smithies, you astonish me. I have strong reason for\nbelieving that the rent is far too low. I have no instructions to reduce\nit.\"\n\n\"Then I must try for another farm, Sir. I can have one of better land,\nunder Sir Walter; only I seemed to hold on to the old place; and my\nSally likes to be under the old ladies.\"\n\n\"Old ladies! Jack, what are you come to? Beautiful ladies in the prime\nof life--but perhaps they would be old in India. I fear that you have\nnot learned much behavior. But at any rate you ought to know your own\nmind. Is it your intention to refuse so kind an offer (which was only\nmade for your father's sake, and to please your faithful Sally) simply\nbecause another of your family has not been honest in his farming?\"\n\n\"I never have took it in that way before,\" the steady old soldier\nanswered, showing that rare phenomenon, the dawn of a new opinion upon\na stubborn face. \"Give me a bit to turn it over in my mind, Sir. Lawyers\nbe so quick, and so nimble, and all-cornered.\"\n\n\"Turn it over fifty times, Master Smithies. We have no wish to force the\nfarm upon you. Take a pinch of snuff, to help your sense of justice. Or\nif you would like a pipe, go and have it in my kitchen. And if you are\nhungry, cook will give you eggs and bacon.\"\n\n\"No, Sir; I am very much obliged to you. I never make much o' my\nthinking. I go by what the Lord sends right inside o' me, whenever I\nhave decent folk to deal with. And spite of your cloth, Sir, you have a\nhonest look.\"\n\n\"You deserve another pinch of snuff for that. Master Smithies, you have\na gift of putting hard things softly. But this is not business. Is your\nmind made up?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir. I will take the farm, at full rent, if the covenants are to\nmy liking. They must be on both sides--both sides, mind you.\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse smiled as he began to read the draft prepared from a very\nancient form which was firmly established on the Scargate Hall estates.\nThe covenants, as usual, were all upon one side, the lessee being bound\nto a multitude of things, and the lessor to little more than acceptance\nof the rent. But such a result is in the nature of the case. Yet Jack\no' the Smithies was not well content. In him true Yorkshire stubbornness\nwas multiplied by the dogged tenacity of a British soldier, and the\naggregate raised to an unknown power by the efforts of shrewd ignorance;\nand at last the lawyer took occasion to say,\n\n\"Master John Smithies, you are worthy to serve under the colors of a\nYordas.\"\n\n\"That I have, Sir, that I have,\" cried the veteran, taken unawares, and\nshaking the stump of his arm in proof; \"I have served under Sir Duncan\nYordas, who will come home some day and claim his own; and he won't want\nno covenants of me.\"\n\n\"You can not have served under Duncan Yordas,\" Mr. Jellicorse answered,\nwith a smile of disbelief, craftily rousing the pugnacity of the man;\n\"because he was not even in the army of the Company, or any other army.\nI mean, of course, unless there was some other Duncan Yordas.\"\n\n\"Tell me!\" Jack o' Smithies almost shouted--\"tell me about Duncan\nYordas, indeed! Who he was, and what he wasn't! And what do lawyers\nknow of such things? Why, you might have to command a regiment, and read\ncovenants to them out there! Sir Duncan was not our colonel, nor our\ncaptain; but we was under his orders all the more; and well he knew how\nto give them. Not one in fifty of us was white; but he made us all as\ngood as white men; and the enemy never saw the color of our backs. I\nwish I was out there again, I do, and would have staid, but for being\nhoarse of combat; though the fault was never in my throat, but in my\narm.\"\n\n\"There is no fault in your throat, John Smithies, except that it is a\ngreat deal too loud. I am sorry for Sally, with a temper such as yours.\"\n\n\"That shows how much you know about it. I never lose my temper, without\nI hearken lies. And for you to go and say that I never saw Sir Duncan--\"\n\n\"I said nothing of the kind, my friend. But you did not come here\nto talk about Duncan, or Captain, or Colonel, or Nabob, or Rajah, or\nwhatever potentate he may be--of him we desire to know nothing more--a\nman who ran away, and disgraced his family, and killed his poor father,\nknows better than ever to set his foot on Scargate land again. You talk\nabout having a lease from him, a man with fifty wives, I dare say, and a\nhundred children! We all know what they are out there.\"\n\nThere are very few tricks of the human face divine more forcibly\nexpressive of contempt than the lowering of the eyelids so that only a\nnarrow streak of eye is exposed to the fellow-mortal, and that streak\nfixed upon him steadfastly; and the contumely is intensified when (as in\nthe present instance) the man who does it is gifted with yellow lashes\non the under lid. Jack o' the Smithies treated Mr. Jellicorse to a gaze\nof this sort; and the lawyer, whose wrath had been feigned, to rouse the\nother's, and so extract full information, began to feel his own temper\nrise. And if Jack had known when to hold his tongue, he must have had\nthe best of it. But the lawyer knew this, and the soldier did not.\n\n\"Master Jellicorse,\" said the latter, with his forehead deeply wrinkled,\nand his eyes now opened to their widest, \"in saying of that you make\na liar of yourself. Lease or no lease--that you do. Leasing stands for\nlying in the Bible, and a' seemeth to do the same thing in Yorkshire.\nFifty wives, and a hundred children! Sir Duncan hath had one wife, and\nlost her, through the Neljan fever and her worry; and a Yorkshire lady,\nas you might know--and never hath he cared to look at any woman since.\nThere now, what you make of that--you lawyers that make out every man\na rake, and every woman a light o' love? Get along! I hate the lot o'\nyou.\"\n\n\"What a strange character you are! You must have had jungle fever, I\nshould think. No, Diana, there is no danger\"--for Jack o' the Smithies\nhad made such a noise that Mrs. Jellicorse got frightened and ran in:\n\"this poor man has only one arm; and if he had two, he could not hurt\nme, even if he wished it. Be pleased to withdraw, Diana. John Smithies,\nyou have simply made a fool of yourself. I have not said a word against\nSir Duncan Yordas, or his wife, or his son--\"\n\n\"He hath no son, I tell you; and that was partly how he lost his wife.\"\n\n\"Well, then, his daughters, I have said no harm of them.\"\n\n\"And very good reason--because he hath none. You lawyers think you are\nso clever; and you never know anything rightly. Sir Duncan hath himself\nalone to see to, and hundreds of thousands of darkies to manage, with\na score of British bayonets. But he never heedeth of the bayonets, not\nhe.\"\n\n\"I have read of such men, but I never saw them,\" Mr. Jellicorse said,\nas if thinking to himself; \"I always feel doubt about the possibility of\nthem.\"\n\n\"He hath ten elephants,\" continued Soldier Smithies, resolved to crown\nthe pillar of his wonders while about it--\"ten great elephants that come\nand kneel before him, and a thousand men ready to run to his thumb; and\nhis word is law--better law than is in England--for scores and scores of\nmiles on the top of hundreds.\"\n\n\"Why did you come away, John Smithies? Why did you leave such a great\nprince, and come home?\"\n\n\"Because it was home, Sir. And for sake of Sally.\"\n\n\"There is some sense in that, my friend. And now if you wish to make\na happy life for Sally, you will do as I advise you. Will you take my\nadvice? My time is of value; and I am not accustomed to waste my words.\"\n\n\"Well, Sir, I will hearken to you. No man that meaneth it can say more\nthan that.\"\n\n\"Jack o' the Smithies, you are acute. You have not been all over the\nworld for nothing. But if you have made up your mind to settle, and be\nhappy in your native parts, one thing must be attended to. It is a maxim\nof law, time-honored and of the highest authority, that the tenant must\nnever call in question the title of his landlord. Before attorning, you\nmay do so; after that you are estopped. Now is it or is it not your wish\nto become the tenant of the Smithies farm, which your father held so\nhonorably? Farm produce is fetching great prices now; and if you refuse\nthis offer, we can have a man, the day after to-morrow, who will give my\nladies 10 pounds more, and who has not been a soldier, but a farmer all\nhis life.\"\n\n\"Lawyer Jellicorse, I will take it; for Sally hath set her heart on it;\nand I know every crumple of the ground better than the wisest farmer\ndoth. Sir, I will sign the articles.\"\n\n\"The lease will be engrossed by next market day; and the sale will\nbe stopped until you have taken whatever you wish at a valuation. But\nremember what I said--you are not to go prating about this wonderful\nSir Duncan, who is never likely to come home, if he lives in such grand\nstate out there, and who is forbidden by his father's will from taking\nan acre of the property. And as he has no heirs, and is so wealthy, it\ncan not matter much to him.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the soldier; \"but he might love to come home, as\nall our folk in India do; and if he doth, I will not deny him. I tell\nyou fairly, Master Jellicorse.\"\n\n\"I like you for being an outspoken man, and true to those who have used\nyou well. You could do him no good, and you might do harm to others, and\nunsettle simple minds, by going on about him among the tenants.\"\n\n\"His name hath never crossed my lips till now, and shall not again\nwithout good cause. Here is my hand upon it, Master Lawyer.\"\n\nThe lawyer shook hands with him heartily, for he could not but respect\nthe man for his sturdiness and sincerity. And when Jack was gone, Mr.\nJellicorse played with his spectacles and his snuff-box for several\nminutes before he could make up his mind how to deal with the matter.\nThen hearing the solid knock of Jordas, who was bound to take horse for\nScargate House pretty early at this time of year (with the weakening of\nthe day among the mountains), he lost a few moments in confusion. The\ndogman could not go without any answer; and how was any good answer to\nbe given in half an hour, at the utmost? A time had been when the lawyer\nstudied curtness and precision under minds of abridgment in London. But\nthe more he had labored to introduce rash brevity into Yorkshire, and to\ncut away nine words out of ten, when all the ten meant one thing only,\nthe more of contempt for his ignorance he won, and the less money he\nmade out of it. And no sooner did he marry than he was forced to give up\nthat, and, like a respectable butcher, put in every pennyweight of fat\nthat could be charged for. Thus had he thriven and grown like a goodly\ndeed of fine amplification; and if he had made Squire Philip's will now,\nit would scarcely have gone into any breast pocket. Unluckily it is\nan easier thing to make a man's will than to carry it out, even though\nfortune be favorable.\n\nIn the present case obstacles seemed to be arising which might at any\nmoment require great skill and tact to surmount them; and the lawyer,\nhearing Jordas striding to and fro impatiently in the waiting-room, was\nfain to win time for consideration by writing a short note to say\nthat he proposed to wait upon the ladies the very next day. For he had\nimportant news which seemed expedient to discuss with them. In the mean\ntime he begged them not to be at all uneasy, for his news upon the whole\nwas propitious.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nJACK AND JILL GO DOWN THE GILL\n\n\nUpon a little beck that runs away into the Lune, which is a tributary of\nthe Tees, there stood at this time a small square house of gray stone,\npartly greened with moss, or patched with drip, and opening to the sun\nwith small dark windows. It looked as if it never could be warm inside,\nby sunshine or by fire-glow, and cared not, although it was the only\nhouse for miles, whether it were peopled or stood empty. But this cold,\nhard-looking place just now was the home of some hot and passionate\nhearts.\n\nThe people were poor; and how they made their living would have been a\nmystery to their neighbors, if there had been any. They rented no land,\nand they followed no trade, and they took no alms by land or post; for\nthe begging-letter system was not yet invented. For the house itself\nthey paid a small rent, which Jordas received on behalf of his ladies,\nand always found it ready; and that being so, he had nothing more to\nask, and never meddled with them. They had been there before he came\ninto office, and it was not his place to seek into their history; and if\nit had been, he would not have done it. For his sympathies were (as\nwas natural and native to a man so placed) with all outsiders, and\nthe people who compress into one or two generations that ignorance of\nlineage which some few families strive to defer for centuries, showing\nthereby unwise insistence, if latter-day theories are correct.\n\nBut if Master Jordas knew little of these people, somebody else knew\nmore about them, and perhaps too much about one of them. Lancelot\nCarnaby, still called \"Pet,\" in one of those rushes after random change\nwhich the wildness of his nature drove upon him, had ridden his pony to\na stand-still on the moor one sultry day of that August. No pity or care\nfor the pony had he, but plenty of both for his own dear self. The pony\nmight be left for the crows to pick his bones, so far as mattered to Pet\nCarnaby; but it mattered very greatly to a boy like him to have to go\nhome upon his own legs. Long exertion was hateful to him, though he\nloved quick difficulty; for he was one of the many who combine activity\nwith laziness. And while he was wondering what he should do, and\nworrying the fine little animal, a wave of the wind carried into his\near the brawling of a beck, like the humming of a hive. The boy had\nforgotten that the moor just here was broken by a narrow glen, engrooved\nwith sliding water.\n\nNow with all his strength, which was not much, he tugged the panting and\nlimping little horse to the flat breach, and then down the steep of the\ngill, and let him walk into the water and begin to slake off a little of\nthe crust of thirst. But no sooner did he see him preparing to rejoice\nin large crystal draughts (which his sobs had first forbidden) than he\njerked him with the bit, and made a bad kick at him, because he could\nbear to see nothing happy. The pony had sense enough to reply, weary as\nhe was, with a stronger kick, which took Master Lancelot in the knee,\nand discouraged him for any further contest. Bully as he was, the boy\nhad too much of ancient Yordas pith in him to howl, or cry, or even\nwhimper, but sat down on a little ridge to nurse his poor knee, and\nmeditate revenge against the animal with hoofs. Presently pain and wrath\ncombined became too much for the weakness of his frame, and he fell back\nand lay upon the hard ground in a fainting fit.\n\nAt such times, as everybody said (especially those whom he knocked about\nin his lively moments), this boy looked wonderfully lovely. His features\nwere almost perfect; and he had long eyelashes like an Andalusian girl,\nand cheeks more exquisite than almost any doll's, a mouth of fine curve,\nand a chin of pert roundness, a neck of the mould that once was called\n\"Byronic,\" and curly dark hair flying all around, as fine as the very\nbest peruke. In a word, he was just what a boy ought not to be, who\nmeans to become an Englishman.\n\nSuch, however, was not the opinion of a creature even more beautiful\nthan he, in the truer points of beauty. Coming with a pitcher for some\nwater from the beck, Insie of the Gill (the daughter of Bat and Zilpie\nof the Gill) was quite amazed as she chanced round a niche of the bank\nupon this image. An image fallen from the sun, she thought it, or at any\nrate from some part of heaven, until she saw the pony, who was testing\nthe geology of the district by the flavor of its herbage. Then Insie\nknew that here was a mortal boy, not dead, but sadly wounded; and she\ndrew her short striped kirtle down, because her shapely legs were bare.\n\nLancelot Carnaby, coming to himself (which was a poor return for him),\nopened his large brown eyes, and saw a beautiful girl looking at him. As\ntheir eyes met, his insolent languor fell--for he generally awoke from\nthese weak lapses into a slow persistent rage--and wonder and unknown\nadmiration moved something in his nature that had never moved before.\nHis words, however, were scarcely up to the high mark of the moment.\n\"Who are you?\" was all he said.\n\n\"I am called 'Insie of the Gill.' My father is Bat of the Gill, and my\nmother Zilpie of the Gill. You must be a stranger, not to know us.\"\n\n\"I never heard of you in all my life; although you seem to be living on\nmy land. All the land about here belongs to me; though my mother has it\nfor a little time.\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" she answered, softly, and scarcely thinking what she\nsaid, \"that the land belonged to anybody, besides the birds and animals.\nAnd is the water yours as well?\"\n\n\"Yes; every drop of it, of course. But you are quite welcome to a\npitcherful.\" This was the rarest affability of Pet; and he expected\nextraordinary thanks.\n\nBut Insie looked at him with surprise. \"I am very much obliged to you,\"\nshe said; \"but I never asked any one to give it me, unless it is the\nbeck itself; and the beck never seems to grudge it.\"\n\n\"You are not like anybody I ever saw. You speak very different from the\npeople about here; and you look very different ten times over.\"\n\nInsie reddened at his steadfast gaze, and turned her sweet soft face\naway. And yet she wanted to know more. \"Different means a great many\nthings. Do you mean that I look better, or worse?\"\n\n\"Better, of course; fifty thousand times better! Why, you look like a\nbeautiful lady. I tell you, I have seen hundreds of ladies; perhaps you\nhaven't, but I have. And you look better than all of them.\"\n\n\"You say a great deal that you do not think,\" Insie answered, quietly,\nyet turning round to show her face again. \"I have heard that gentlemen\nalways do; and I suppose that you are a young gentleman.\"\n\n\"I should hope so indeed. Don't you know who I am? I am Lancelot Yordas\nCarnaby.\"\n\n\"Why, you look quite as if you could stop the river,\" she answered, with\na laugh, though she felt his grandeur. \"I suppose you consider me nobody\nat all. But I must get my water.\"\n\n\"You shall not carry water. You are much too pretty. I will carry it for\nyou.\"\n\nPet was not \"introspective;\" otherwise he must have been astonished at\nhimself. His mother and aunt would have doubted their own eyes if\nthey had beheld this most dainty of the dainty, and mischievous of the\nmischievous (with pain and passion for the moment vanquished), carefully\ncarrying an old brown pitcher. Yet this he did, and wonderfully well,\nas he believed; though Insie only laughed to see him. For he had on\nthe loveliest gaiters in the world, of thin white buckskin with agate\nbuttons, and breeches of silk, and a long brocaded waistcoat, and a\nshort coat of rich purple velvet, also a riding hat with a gray ostrich\nplume. And though he had very little calf inside his gaiters, and not\nmuch chest to fill out his waistcoat, and narrower shoulders than a\nvelvet coat deserved, it would have been manifest, even to a tailor,\nthat the boy had lineal, if not lateral, right to his rich habiliments.\n\nInsie of the Gill (who seemed not to be of peasant birth, though so\nplainly dressed), came gently down the steep brook-side to see what was\ngoing to be done for her.\n\nShe admired Lancelot, both for bravery of apparel and of action; and\nshe longed to know how he would get a good pitcher of water without any\nsplash upon his clothes. So she stood behind a little bush, pretending\nnot to be at all concerned, but amused at having her work done for her.\nBut Pet was too sharp to play cat's-paw for nothing.\n\n\"Smile, and say 'thank you,'\" he cried, \"or I won't do it. I am not\ngoing up to my middle for nothing; I know that you want to laugh at me.\"\n\n\"You must have a very low middle,\" said Insie; \"why, it never comes half\nway to my knees.\"\n\n\"You have got no stockings, and no new gaiters,\" Lancelot answered,\nreasonably; and then, like two children, they set to and laughed, till\nthe gill almost echoed with them.\n\n\"Why, you're holding the mouth of the pitcher down stream!\" Insie could\nhardly speak for laughing. \"Is that how you go to fill a pitcher?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the right way too,\" he answered; \"the best water always comes\nup the eddies. You ought to be old enough to know that.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything at all--except that you are ruining your best\nclothes.\"\n\n\"I don't care twopence for such rubbish. You ought to see me on a\nSunday, Insie, if you want to know what is good. There, you never drew\nsuch a pitcher as that. And I believe there is a fish in the bottom of\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh, if there is a fish, let me have him in my hands. I can nurse a fish\non dry land, until he gets quite used to it. Are you sure that there is\na little fish?\"\n\n\"No, there is no fish; and I am soaking wet. But I never care what\nanybody thinks of me. If they say what I don't like, I kick them.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are accustomed to have your own way. That any one might know\nby looking at you. But I have got a quantity of work to do. You can see\nthat by my fingers.\"\n\nThe girl made a courtesy, and took the pitcher from him, because he was\nknocking it against his legs; but he could not be angry when he looked\ninto her eyes, though the habit of his temper made him try to fume.\n\n\"Do you know what I think?\" she said, fixing bright hazel eyes upon him;\n\"I think that you are very passionate sometimes.\"\n\n\"Well, if I am, it is my own business. Who told you anything about it?\nWhoever it was shall pay out for it.\"\n\n\"Nobody told me, Sir. You must remember that I never even heard of your\nname before.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, I can't quite take down that. Everybody knows me for fifty\nmiles or more; and I don't care what they think of me.\"\n\n\"You may please yourself about believing me,\" she answered, without\nconcern about it. \"No one who knows me doubts my word, though I am not\nknown for even five miles away.\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary girl you are! You say things on purpose to\nprovoke me. Nobody ever does that; they are only too glad to keep me in\na good temper.\"\n\n\"If you are like that, Sir, I had better run away. My father will be\nhome in about an hour, and he might think that you had no business\nhere.\"\n\n\"I! No business upon my own land! This place must be bewitched, I think.\nThere is a witch upon the moors, I know, who can take almost any shape;\nbut--but they say she is three hundred years of age, or more.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, then, I am bewitched,\" said Insie; \"or why should I stop to\ntalk with you, who are only a rude boy, after all, even according to\nyour own account?\"\n\n\"Well, you can go if you like. I suppose you live in that queer little\nplace down there?\"\n\n\"The house is quite good enough for me and my father and mother and\nbrother Maunder. Good-by; and please never to come here again.\"\n\n\"You don't understand me. I have made you cry. Oh, Insie, let me have\nhold of your hand. I would rather make anybody cry than you. I never\nliked anybody so before.\"\n\n\"Cry, indeed! Who ever heard me cry? It is the way you splashed the\nwater up. I am not in the habit of crying for a stranger. Good-by, now;\nand go to your great people. You say that you are bad; and I fear it is\ntoo true.\"\n\n\"I am not bad at all. It is only what everybody says, because I never\nwant to please them. But I want to please you. I would give anything to\ndo it; if you would only tell me how.\"\n\nThe girl having cleverly dried her eyes, poured all their bright beauty\nupon him, and the heart of the youth was enlarged with a new, very\nsweet, and most timorous feeling. Then his dark eyes dropped, and he\ntouched her gently, and only said, \"Don't go away.\"\n\n\"But I must go away,\" Insie answered, with a blush, and a look as of\nmore tears lurking in her eyes. \"I have stopped too long; I must go away\nat once.\"\n\n\"But when may I come again? I will hold you, and fight for you with\neverybody in the world, unless you tell me when to come again.\"\n\n\"Hush! I am quite ashamed to hear you talk so. I am a poor girl, and you\na great young gentleman.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. That has nothing to do with it. Would you like to make\nme miserable, and a great deal more wicked than I ever was before? Do\nyou hate me so much as all that, Insie?\"\n\n\"No. You have been very kind to me. Only my father would be angry, I am\nsure; and my brother Maunder is dreadful. They all go away every other\nFriday, and that is the only free time I have.\"\n\n\"Every other Friday! What a long time, to be sure! Won't you come again\nfor water this day fortnight?\"\n\n\"Yes; I come for water three or four times every day. But if they were\nto see you, they would kill you first, and then lock me up forever. The\nonly wise plan is for you to come no more.\"\n\n\"You can not be thinking for a moment what you say. I will tell you\nwhat; if you don't come, I will march up to the house, and beat the door\nin. The landlord can do that, according to law.\"\n\n\"If you care at all for me,\" said Insie, looking as if she had known him\nfor ten years, \"you will do exactly what I tell you. You will think no\nmore about me for a fortnight; and then if you fancy that I can do you\ngood by advice about your bad temper, or by teaching you how to plait\nreeds for a bat, and how to fill a pitcher--perhaps I might be able to\ncome down the gill again.\"\n\n\"I wish it was to-morrow. I shall count the days. But be sure to come\nearly, if they go away all day. I shall bring my dinner with me; and you\nshall have the first help, and I will carve. But I should like one thing\nbefore I go; and it is the first time I ever asked anybody, though they\nask me often enough, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"What would you like? You seem to me to be always wanting something.\"\n\n\"I should like very much--very much indeed--just to give you one kiss,\nInsie.\"\n\n\"It can not be thought of for a moment,\" she replied; \"and the first\ntime of my ever seeing you, Sir!\"\n\nBefore he could reason in favor of a privilege which goes proverbially\nby favor, the young maid was gone upon the winding path, with the\npitcher truly balanced on her well-tressed head. Then Pet sat down and\nwatched her; and she turned round in the distance, and waved him a kiss\nat decorous interval.\n\nNot more than three days after this, Mrs. Carnaby came into the\ndrawing-room with a hasty step, and a web of wrinkles upon her generally\nsmooth, white forehead.\n\n\"Eliza,\" asked her sister, \"what has put you out so? That chair is\nnot very strong, and you are rather heavy. Do you call that gracefully\nsinking on a seat, as we used to learn the way to do at school?\"\n\n\"No, I do not call it anything of the kind. And if I am heavy, I only\nkeep my heart in countenance, Philippa. You know not the anxieties of a\nmother.\"\n\n\"I am thankful to say that I do not. I have plenty of larger cares to\nattend to, as well as the anxieties of an aunt and sister. But what is\nthis new maternal care?\"\n\n\"Poor Pet's illness--his serious illness. I am surprised that you have\nnot noticed it, Philippa; it seems so unkind of you.\"\n\n\"There can not be anything much amiss with him. I never saw any one eat\na better breakfast. What makes you fancy that the boy must be unwell?\"\n\n\"It is no fancy. He must be very ill. Poor dear! I can not bear to think\nof it. He has done no mischief for quite three days.\"\n\n\"Then he must indeed be at the point of death. Oh, if we could only keep\nhim always so, Eliza!\"\n\n\"My dear sister, you will never understand him. He must have his little\nplayful ways. Would you like him to be a milksop?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. But I should like him first to be a manly boy, and\nthen a boyish man. The Yordases always have been manly boys; instead of\npuling, and puking, and picking this, that, and the other.\"\n\n\"The poor child can not help his health, Philippa. He never had the\nYordas constitution. He inherits his delicate system from his poor dear\ngallant father.\"\n\nMrs. Carnaby wiped away a tear; and her sister (who never was hard to\nher) spoke gently, and said there were many worse boys than he, and she\nliked him for many good and brave points of character, and especially\nfor hating medicine.\n\n\"Philippa, you are right; he does hate medicine,\" the good mother\nanswered, with a soft, sad sigh; \"and he kicked the last apothecary in\nthe stomach, when he made certain of its going down. But such things are\ntrifles, dear, in comparison with now. If he would only kick Jordas, or\nWelldrum, or almost any one who would take it nicely, I should have some\nhope that he was coming to himself. But to see him sit quiet is so truly\nsad. He gets up a tree with his vast activity, and there he sits moping\nby the hour, and gazing in one fixed direction. I am almost sure that\nhe has knocked his leg; but he flew into a fury when I wanted to examine\nit; and when I made a poultice, there was Saracen devouring it; and the\nnasty dog swallowed one of my lace handkerchiefs.\"\n\n\"Then surely you are unjust, Eliza, in lamenting all lack of mischief.\nBut I have noticed things as well as you. And yesterday I saw something\nmore portentous than anything you have told me. I came upon Lancelot\nsuddenly, in the last place where I should have looked for him. He was\npositively in the library, and reading--reading a real book.\"\n\n\"A book, Phillppa! Oh, that settles everything. He must have gone\naltogether out of his sane mind.\"\n\n\"Not only was it a book, but even a book of what people call poetry. You\nhave heard of that bold young man over the mountains, who is trying to\nturn poetry upside down, by making it out of every single thing he sees;\nand who despises all the pieces that we used to learn at school. I\ncan not remember his name; but never mind. I thought that we ought to\nencourage him, because he might know some people in this neighborhood;\nand so I ordered a book of his. Perhaps I told you; and that is the very\nbook your learned boy was reading.\"\n\n\"Philippa, it seems to me impossible almost. He must have been looking\nat the pictures. I do hope he was only looking at the pictures.\"\n\n\"There is not a picture in the hook of any sort. He was reading it, and\nsaying it quite softly to himself; and I felt that if you saw him, you\nwould send for Dr. Spraggs.\"\n\n\"Ring the bell at once, dear, if you will be kind enough. I hope there\nis a fresh horse in the stable. Or the best way would be to send the\njumping-car; then he would be certain to come back at once.\"\n\n\"Do as you like. I begin to think that we ought to take proper\nprecautions. But when that is done, I will tell you what I think he may\nbe up the tree for.\"\n\nA man with the jumping-car was soon dispatched, by urgency of Jordas,\nfor Dr. Spraggs, who lived several miles away, in a hamlet to the\nwestward, inaccessible to anything that could not jump right nimbly.\nBut the ladies made a slight mistake: they caught the doctor, but no\npatient.\n\nFor Pet being well up in his favorite tree--poring with great wonder\nover Lyrical Ballads, which took his fancy somehow--thence descried the\nhateful form of Dr. Spraggs, too surely approaching in the seat of honor\nof the jumping-car. Was ever any poesy of such power as to elevate the\nsoul above the smell of physic? The lofty poet of the lakes and fells\nfell into Pet's pocket anyhow, and down the off side of the tree came\nhe, with even his bad leg ready to be foremost in giving leg-bail to\nthe medical man. The driver of the jumping-car espied this action;\nbut knowing that he would have done the like, grinned softly, and said\nnothing. And long after Dr. Spraggs was gone, leaving behind him sage\nadvice, and a vast benevolence of bottles, Pet returned, very dirty and\nhungry, and cross, and most unpoetical.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nYOUNG GILLY FLOWERS\n\n\n\"Drum,\" said Pet, in his free and easy style, about ten days after\nthat escape, to a highly respected individual, Mr. Welldrum, the\nbutler--\"Drum, you have heard perhaps about my being poorly.\"\n\n\"Ay, that I have, and too much of it,\" replied the portly butler, busy\nin his office with inferior work, which he never should have had to do,\nif rightly estimated. \"What you wants, Master Lancelot, is a little more\nof this here sort of thing--sleeves up--elbow grease--scrub away at hold\nancient plate, and be blowed up if you puts a scratch on it; and the\nmore you sweats, the less thanks you gets.\"\n\n\"Drum, when you come to be my butler, you shall have all the keys\nallowed you, and walk about with them on a great gold ring, with a gold\nchain down to your breeches pocket. You shall dine when you like, and\nhave it cooked on purpose, and order it directly after breakfast; and\nyou shall have the very best hot-water plates; because you hate grease,\ndon't you, Drum?\"\n\n\"That I do; especial from young chaps as wants to get something out of\nme.\"\n\n\"I am always as good as my word; come, now.\"\n\n\"That you are, Sir; and nothing very grand to say, considering the\nhepithets you applies to me sometimes. But you han't insulted me for\nthree days now; and that proves to my mind that you can't be quite\nright.\"\n\n\"But you would like to see me better. I am sure you would. There is\nnobody so good to you as I am, Drum; and you are very crusty at times,\nyou know. Your daughter shall be the head cook; and then everything must\nbe to your liking.\"\n\n\"Master Lancelot, you speaks fair. What can I have the honor of doing\nfor you, Sir, to set you up again in your poor dear 'ealth?\"\n\n\"Well, you hate physic, don't you, Drum? And you make a strict point of\nnever taking it.\"\n\n\"I never knew no good to come out of no bottle, without it were a bottle\nof old crusted port-wine. Ah! you likes that, Master Lancelot.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Drum; I am obliged to be very careful. The\nreason why I don't get on is from taking my meals too much in-doors.\nThere is no fresh air in these old rooms. I have got a man who says--I\ncould read it to you; but perhaps you don't care to hear poetry, Drum?\"\nThe butler made a face, and put the leather to his ears. \"Very well,\nthen; I am only just beginning; and it's like claret, you must learn to\ncome to it. But from what he says, and from my own stomach, I intend to\ngo and dine out-of-doors to-day.\"\n\n\"Lord! Master Lancelot, you must be gone clean daft. How ever could you\nhave hot gravy, Sir? And all the Yordases hales cold meat. Your poor\ndear grandfather--ah! he was a man.\"\n\n\"So am I. And I have got half a guinea. Now, Drum, you do just what I\ntell you; and mind, not a word to any one. It will be the last coin you\never see of mine, either now or in all my life, remember, if you let\nmy mamma ever hear of it. You slip down to the larder and get me a cold\ngrouse, and a cold partridge, and two of the hearth-stone cakes, and\na pat of butter, and a pinch of salt, and put them in my army knapsack\nAunt Philippa gave me; also a knife and fork and plate; and--let me\nsee--what had I better have to drink?\"\n\n\"Well, Sir, if I might offer an opinion, a pint bottle of dry port, or\nyour grandfather's Madeira.\"\n\n\"Young ladies--young gentlemen I mean, of course--never take strong\nwines in the middle of the day. Bucellas, Drum--Bucellas is the proper\nthing. And when you have got it all together, turn the old cat into the\nlarder, and get away cleverly by your little door, and put my knapsack\nin the old oak-tree, the one that was struck by lightning. Now do you\nunderstand all about it? It must all be ready in half an hour. And if\nI make a good dinner out on the moor, why, you might get another half\nguinea before long.\" And with these words away strode Pet.\n\n\"Well, well,\" the butler began muttering to himself; \"what wickedness\nare you up to next? A lassie in his head, and his dear mammy thought\nhe was sickening over his wisdom-teeth! He is beginning airly, and no\nmistake. But the gals are a coarse ugly lot about here\"--Master Welldrum\nwas not a Yorkshireman--\"and the lad hath good taste in the matter of\nwine; although he is that contrairy, Solomon's self could not be upsides\nwith him. Fall fair, fall foul, I must humor the boy, or out of this\nplace I go, neck and crop.\"\n\nAccordingly, Pet found all that he had ordered, and several little\nthings which he had not thought of, especially a corkscrew and a glass;\nand forgetting half his laziness, he set off briskly, keeping through\nthe trees where no window could espy him, and down a little side glen,\nall afoot; for it seemed to him safer to forego his pony.\n\nThe gill (or \"ghyll,\" as the poet writes it), from which the lonely\nfamily that dwelt there took their name, was not upon the bridle-road\nfrom Scargate Hall toward Middleton, nor even within eye or reach of\nany road at all; but overlooked by kites alone, and tracked with\nthoroughfare of nothing but the mountain streamlet. The four who lived\nthere--\"Bat and Zilpic, Maunder and Insie, of the Gill\"--had nothing to\ndo with, and little to say to, any of the scatterling folk about them,\nacross the blue distance of the moor. They ploughed no land, they kept\nno cattle, they scarcely put spade in the ground, except for about a\nfortnight in April, when they broke up a strip of alluvial soil new\nevery season, and abutting on the brook; and there sowed or planted\ntheir vegetable crop, and left it to the clemency of heaven. Yet twice\nevery year they were ready with their rent when it suited Master Jordas\nto come for it, since audits at the hall, and tenants' dinners, were not\nto their liking. The rent was a trifle; but Jordas respected them highly\nfor handing it done up in white paper, without even making him leave\nthe saddle. How many paid less, or paid nothing at all, yet came to\nthe dinners under rent reservation of perhaps one mark, then strictly\nreserved their rent, but failed not to make the most punctual and\nliberal marks upon roast beef and plum-pudding!\n\nBut while the worthy dogman got his little bit of money, sealed up and\nso correct that (careful as he was) he never stopped now to count it,\neven his keen eyes could make nothing of these people, except that they\nstood upon their dignity. To him they appeared to be of gypsy race; or\npartly of wild and partly perhaps of Lancastrian origin; for they rather\n\"featured\" the Lancashire than the Yorkshire type of countenance, yet\nwithout any rustic coarseness, whether of aspect, voice, or manners.\nThe story of their settlement in this glen had flagged out of memory of\ngossip by reason of their calm obscurity, and all that survived was the\nbelief that they were queer, and the certainty that they would not be\nmeddled with.\n\nLancelot Yordas Carnaby was brave, both in the outward and the inward\nboy, when he struck into the gill from a trackless spread of moor, not\nfar from the source of the beck that had shaped or been shaped by this\nfissure. He had made up his mind to learn all about the water that\nfilled sweet Insie's pitcher; and although the great poet of nature as\nyet was only in early utterance, some of his words had already touched\nPet as he had never been touched before; but perhaps that fine effect\nwas due to the sapping power of first love.\n\nYet first love, however it may soften and enlarge a petulant and wayward\nnature, instead of increasing, cuts short and crisp the patience of the\npatient. When Lancelot was as near as manners and prudence allowed to\nthat lonesome house, he sat down quietly for a little while in a little\nniche of scrubby bush whence he could spy the door. For a short time\nthis was very well; also it was well to be furnishing his mind with a\nform for the beautiful expressions in it, and prepare it for the order\nof their coming out. And when he was sure that these were well arranged,\nand could not fail at any crisis, he found a further pastime in\nconsidering his boots, then his gaiters and small-clothes (which were of\nlofty type), and his waistcoat, elegant for anybody's bosom. But after a\nbit even this began to pall; and when one of his feet went fast asleep,\nin spite of its beautiful surroundings, he jumped up and stamped, and\nwas not so very far from hot words as he should have been. For his habit\nwas not so much to want a thing as to get it before he wanted it, which\nis very poor training for the trials of the love-time.\n\nBut just as he was beginning to resolve to be wise, and eat his\nvictuals, now or never, and be sorry for any one who came too\nlate--there came somebody by another track, whose step made the heart\nrise, and the stomach fall. Lancelot's mind began to fail him all at\nonce; and the spirit that was ready with a host of words fluttered away\ninto a quaking depth of silence. Yet Insie tripped along as if the world\nheld no one to cast a pretty shadow from the sun beside her own.\n\nEven the youngest girls are full of little tricks far beyond the oldest\nboy's comprehension. But the wonder of all wonders is, they have so pure\na conscience as never to be thinking of themselves at all, far less of\nany one who thinks too much of them. \"I declare, she has forgotten that\nshe ever saw me!\" Lancelot muttered to the bush in which he trembled.\n\"It would serve her right, if I walked straight away.\" But he looked\nagain, and could not help looking more than many times again, so\npiercing (as an ancient poet puts it) is the shaft from the eyes of\nthe female women. And Insie was especially a female girl--which has now\nceased to be tautology--so feminine were her walk, and way, and sudden\nvariety of unreasonable charm.\n\n\"Dear me! I never thought to see you any more, Sir;\" said she, with a\nbright blush, perhaps at such a story, as Pet jumped out eagerly, with\nhands stretched forth. \"It is the most surprising thing. And we might\nhave done very well with rain-water.\"\n\n\"Oh, Insie! don't be so cold-hearted. Who can drink rain-water? I have\ngot something very good for you indeed. I have carried it all the way\nmyself; and only a strong man could have done it. Why, you have got\nstockings on, I declare; but I like you much better without them.\"\n\n\"Then, Master Lancelot Yordas Carnaby, you had better go home with all\nyour good things.\"\n\n\"You are totally mistaken about that. I could never get these things\ninto the house again, without being caught out to a certainty. It shows\nhow little girls know of anything.\"\n\n\"A girl can not be expected,\" she answered, looking most innocently at\nhim, \"to understand anything sly or cunning. Why should anything of that\nsort be?\"\n\n\"Well, if it comes to that,\" cried Pet, who (like all unreasonable\npeople) had large rudiments of reasoning, \"why should not I come up to\nyour door, and knock, and say, 'I want to see Miss Insie; I am fond of\nMiss Insie, and have got something good for her'? That is what I shall\ndo next time.\"\n\n\"If you do, my brother Maunder will beat you dreadfully--so dreadfully\nthat you will never walk home. But don't let us talk of such terrible\nthings. You must never come here, if you think of such things. I would\nnot have you hurt for all the world; for sometimes I think that I like\nyou very much.\"\n\nThe lovely girl looked at the handsome boy, as if they were at school\ntogether, learning something difficult, which must be repeated to the\nother's eyes, with a nod, or a shake of the head, as may be. A kind, and\npure, and soft gaze she gave him, as if she would love his thoughts, if\nhe could explain them. And Pet turned away, because he could not do so.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" he said, bravely, while his heart was\nthrilling with desire to speak well; \"we will set to at once, and have a\njolly good spread. I told my man to put up something very good, because\nI was certain that you would be very hungry.\"\n\n\"Surely you were not so foolish as to speak of me?\"\n\n\"No, no, no; I know a trick worth two of that. I was not such a fool as\nto speak of you, of course. But--\"\n\n\"But I would never condescend to touch one bit. You were ashamed to say\na word about me, then, were you?\"\n\n\"Insie, now, Insie, too bad of you it is. You can have no idea what\nthose butlers and footmen are, if ever you tell them anything. They are\nworse than the maids; they go down stairs, and they get all the tidbits\nout of the cook, and sit by the girl they like best, on the strength of\nhaving a secret about their master.\"\n\n\"Well, you are cunning!\" cried the maiden, with a sigh. \"I thought that\nyour nature was loftier than that. No, I do not know anything of butlers\nand footmen; and I think that the less I know of you the better.\"\n\n\"Oh, Insie, darling Insie, if you run away like that--I have got both\nyour hands, and you shall not run away. Do you want to kill me, Insie?\nThey have had the doctor for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, how very dreadful! that does sound dreadful. I am not at all\ncrying, and you need not look. But what did he say? Please to tell me\nwhat he said.\"\n\n\"He said, 'Salts and senna.' But I got up a high tree. Let us think of\nnicer things. It is enough to spoil one's dinner. Oh, Insie, what is\nanything to eat or drink, compared with looking at you, when you are\ngood? If I could only tell you the things that I have felt, all day and\nall night, since this day fortnight, how sorry you would be for having\nevil thoughts of me!\"\n\n\"I have no evil thoughts; I have no thoughts at all. But it puzzles me\nto think what on earth you have been thinking. There, I will sit down,\nand listen for a moment.\"\n\n\"And I may hold one of your hands? I must, or you would never understand\nme. Why, your hands are much smaller than mine, I declare! And mine are\nvery small; because of thinking about you. Now you need not laugh--it\ndoes spoil everything to laugh so. It is more than a fortnight since\nI laughed at all. You make me feel so miserable. But would you like to\nknow how I felt? Mind, I would rather cut my head off than tell it to\nany one in the world but you.\"\n\n\"Now I call that very kind of you. If you please, I should like to know\nhow you have been feeling.\" With these words Insie came quite close up\nto his side, and looked at him so that he could hardly speak. \"You may\nsay it in a whisper, if you like,\" she said; \"there is nobody coming for\nat least three hours, and so you may say it in a whisper.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you; it was just like this. You know that I began to\nthink how beautiful you were at the very first time I looked at you. But\nyou could not expect me so to love you all at once as I love you now,\ndear Insie.\"\n\n\"I can not understand any meaning in such things.\" But she took a little\ndistance, quite as if she did.\n\n\"Well, I went away without thinking very much, because I had a bad place\nin my knee--a blue place bigger than the new half crown, where you saw\nthat the pony kicked me. I had him up, and thrashed him, when I got\nhome; but that has got nothing to do with it--only that I made him know\nwho was his master. And then I tried to go on with a lot of things as\nusual; but somehow I did not care at all. There was a great rat hunt\nthat I had been thinking of more than three weeks, when they got the\nstraddles down, to be ready for the new ricks to come instead. But I\ncould not go near it; and it made them think that the whole of my inside\nwas out of order. And it must have been. I can see by looking back; it\nmust have been so, without my knowing it. I hit several people with my\nholly on their shins, because they knew more than I did. But that was no\ngood; nor was anything else. I only got more and more out of sorts, and\ncould not stay quiet anywhere; and yet it was no good to me to try to\nmake a noise. All day I went about as if I did not care whether people\ncontradicted me or not, or where I was, or what time I should get back,\nor whether there would be any dinner. And I tucked up my feet in my\nnightgown every night; but instead of stopping there, as they always\nused to do, they were down in cold places immediately; and instead of\nany sleep, I bit holes by the hundred in the sheets, with thinking. I\nhated to be spoken to, and I hated everybody; and so I do now, whenever\nI come to think about them!\"\n\n\"Including even poor me, I suppose?\" Insie had wonderfully pretty\neyebrows, and a pretty way of raising them, and letting more light into\nher bright hazel eyes.\n\n\"No, I never seemed to hate you; though I often was put out, because I\ncould never make your face come well. I was thinking of you always, but\nI could not see you. Now tell me whether you have been like that.\"\n\n\"Not at all; but I have thought of you once or twice, and wondered what\ncould make you want to come and see me. If I were a boy, perhaps I could\nunderstand it.\"\n\n\"I hate boys; I am a man all over now. I am old enough to have a wife;\nand I mean to have you. How much do you suppose my waistcoat cost? Well,\nnever mind, because you are not rich. But I have got money enough for\nboth of us to live well, and nobody can keep me out of it. You know what\na road is, I suppose--a good road leading to a town? Have you ever seen\none? A brown place, with hedges on each side, made hard and smooth for\nhorses to go upon, and wheels that make a rumble. Well, if you will\nhave me, and behave well to me, you shall sit up by yourself in a velvet\ndress, with a man before you and a man behind, and believe that you are\nflying.\"\n\n\"But what would become of my father, and my mother, and my brother\nMaunder?\"\n\n\"Oh, they must stop here, of course. We shouldn't want them. But I would\ngive them all their house rent-free, and a fat pig every Christmas. Now\nyou sit there and spread your lap, that I may help you properly. I\nwant to see you eat; you must learn to eat like a lady of the highest\nquality; for that you are going to be, I can tell you.\"\n\nThe beautiful maid of the gill smiled sweetly, sitting on the low bank\nwith the grace of simple nature and the playfulness of girlhood. She\nlooked up at Lancelot, the self-appointed man, with a bright glance\nof curious contemplation; and contemplation (of any other subject than\nself) is dangerously near contempt. She thought very little of his\nlarge, free brag, of his patronizing manner, and fine self-content,\nreference of everything to his own standard, beauty too feminine, and\ninstead of female gentleness, highly cultivated waywardness. But in\nspite of all that, she could not help liking, and sometimes admiring\nhim, when he looked away. And now he was very busy with the high feast\nhe had brought.\n\n\"To begin with,\" he said, when his good things were displayed, \"you must\nremember that nothing is more vulgar than to be hungry. A gentleman may\nhave a tremendous appetite, but a lady never.\"\n\n\"But why? but why? That does seem foolish. I have read that the ladies\nare always helped first. That must be because of their appetites.\"\n\n\"Insie, I tell you things, not the reasons of them. Things are learned\nby seeing other people, and not by arguing about them.\"\n\n\"Then you had better eat your dinner first, and let me sit and watch\nyou. And then I can eat mine by imitation; that is to say, if there is\nany left.\"\n\n\"You are one of the oddest people I have ever seen. You go round the\ncorner of all that I say, instead of following properly. When we are\nmarried, you will always make me laugh. At one time they kept a boy to\nmake me laugh; but I got tired of him. Now I help you first, although\nI am myself so hungry. I do it from a lofty feeling, which my aunt\nPhilippa calls 'chivalry.' Ladies talk about it when they want to get\nthe best of us. I have given you all the best part, you see; and I only\nkeep the worst of it for myself.\"\n\nIf Pet had any hope that his self-denial would promptly be denied to\nhim, he made a great mistake; for the damsel of the gill had a healthy\nmoorland appetite, and did justice to all that was put before her; and\npresently he began, for the first time in his life, to find pleasure in\nseeing another person pleased. But the wine she would not even taste,\nin spite of persuasion and example; the water from the brook was all she\ndrank, and she drank as prettily as a pigeon. Whatever she did was done\ngracefully and well.\n\n\"I am very particular,\" he said at last; \"but you are fit to dine with\nanybody. How have you managed to learn it all? You take the best of\neverything, without a word about it, as gently as great ladies do. I\nthought that you would want me to eat the nicest pieces; but instead of\nthat, you have left me bones and drumsticks.\"\n\nHe gave such a melancholy look at these that Insie laughed quite\nmerrily. \"I wanted to see you practice chivalry,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, never mind; I shall know another time. Instead of two birds, I\nshall order four, and other things in proportion. But now I want to know\nabout your father and your mother. They must be respectable people, to\njudge by you. What is their proper name, and how much have they got to\nlive upon?\"\n\n\"More than you--a great deal more than you,\" she answered, with such a\nroguish smile that he forgot his grievances, or began to lose them in\nthe mist of beauty.\n\n\"More than me! And they live in such a hole, where only the crows come\nnear them?\"\n\n\"Yes, more than you, Sir. They have their wits to live upon, and\nindustry, and honesty.\"\n\nPet was not old enough yet in the world to say, \"What is the use of all\nthose? All their income is starvation.\" He was young enough to think\nthat those who owned them had advantage of him, for he knew that he was\nvery lazy. Moreover, he had heard of such people getting on--through the\nstriking power of exception, so much more brilliant than the rule--when\nall the blind virtues found luck to lead them. Industry, honesty, and\nability always get on in story-books, and nothing is nicer than to hear\na pretty story. But in some ways Pet was sharp enough.\n\n\"Then they never will want that house rent-free, nor the fat pig, nor\nany other presents. Oh, Insie, how very much better that will be! I find\nit so much nicer always to get thing's than to give them. And people are\nso good-natured, when they have done it, and can talk of it. Insie,\nthey shall give me something when I marry you, and as often as they like\nafterward.\"\n\n\"They will give you something you will not like,\" she answered, with a\nlaugh, and a look along the moor, \"if you stay here too long chattering\nwith me. Do you know what o'clock it is? I know always, whether the sun\nis out or in. You need show no gold watch to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, that comes of living in a draught all day. The out-door people grow\ntoo wise. What do you see about ten miles off? It must be ten miles to\nthat hill.\"\n\n\"That hill is scarcely five miles off, and what I see is not half of\nthat. I brought you up here to be quite safe. Maunder's eyes are better\nthan mine. But he will not see us, for another mile, if you cover your\ngrand waistcoat, because we are in the shadows. Slip down into the gill\nagain, and keep below the edge of it, and go home as fast as possible.\"\n\nLancelot felt inclined to do as he was told, and keep to safe obscurity.\nThe long uncomfortable loneliness of prospect, and dim airy distance\nof the sinking sun, and deeply silent emptiness of hollows, where great\nshadows began to crawl--in the waning of the day, and so far away from\nhome--all these united to impress upon the boy a spiritual influence,\nwhose bodily expression would be the appearance of a clean pair of\nheels. But, to meet this sensible impulse, there arose the stubborn\nnature of his race, which hated to be told to do anything, and the\ndignity of his new-born love--such as it was--and the thought of looking\nsmall.\n\n\"Why should I go?\" he said. \"I will meet them, and tell them that I am\ntheir landlord, and have a right to know all about them. My grandfather\nnever ran away from anybody. And they have got a donkey with them.\"\n\n\"They will have two, if you stop,\" cried Insie, although she admired his\nspirit. \"My father is a very quiet man. But Maunder would take you by\nthe throat and cast you down into the beck.\"\n\n\"I should like to see him try to do it. I am not so very strong, but I\nam active as a cat. I have no idea of being threatened.\"\n\n\"Then will you be coaxed? I do implore you, for my sake, to go, or it\nwill be too late. Never, never, will you see me again, unless you do\nwhat I beseech of you.\"\n\n\"I will not stir one peg, unless you put your arms round my neck and\nkiss me, and say that you will never have anybody else.\"\n\nInsie blushed deeply, and her bright eyes flashed with passion not of\nloving kind. But it went to her heart that he was brave, and that he\nloved her truly. She flung her comely arms round his neck, and touched\nher rosy lips with his; and before he could clasp her she was gone, with\nno more comfort than these words:\n\n\"Now if you are a gentleman, you must go, and never come near this place\nagain.\"\n\nNot a moment too soon he plunged into the gill, and hurried up its\nwinding course; but turning back at the corner, saw a sweet smile in the\ndistance, and a wave of the hand, that warmed his heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nLOVE MILITANT\n\n\nSo far so good. But that noble and exalted condition of the youthful\nmind which is to itself pure wisdom's zenith, but to folk of coarse\nmaturity and tough experience \"calf-love,\" superior as it is to words\nand reason, must be left to its own course. The settled resolve of a\nmiddle-aged man, with seven large-appetited children, and an eighth\napproaching the shores of light, while baby-linen too often transmitted\nbetrays a transient texture, and hose has ripened into holes, and\nbreeches verify their name, and a knock at the door knocks at the\nheart--the fixed resolution of such a man to strike a bold stroke, for\nthe sake of his home, is worthier of attention than the flitting fancy\nof boy and girl, who pop upon one another, and skip through zigzag\nvernal ecstasy, like the weathery dalliance of gnats.\n\nLieutenant Carroway had dealt and done with amorous grace and attitude,\nsoaring rapture, and profundity of sigh, suspense (more agonizing than\nsuspension), despair, prostration, grinding of the teeth, the hollow and\nspectral laugh of a heart forever broken, and all the other symptoms of\nan annual bill of vitality; and every new pledge of his affections\nsped him toward the pledge-shop. But never had he crossed that fatal\nthreshold; the thought of his uniform and dignity prevailed; and he was\nnot so mean as to send a child to do what the father was ashamed of.\n\nSo it was scarcely to be expected that even as a man he should\nsympathize deeply with the tender passion, and far less, as a\ncoast-guardsman, with the wooing of a smuggler. Master Robin Lyth, by\nthis time, was in the contraband condition known to the authorities\nas love; Carroway had found out this fact; but instead of indulging\nin generous emotion, he made up his mind to nab him through it. For he\nreasoned as follows; and granting that reason has any business on such\npremises, the process does not seem amiss.\n\nA man in love has only got one-eighth part of his wits at home to govern\nthe doings of his arms, legs, and tongue. A large half is occupied\nwith his fancy, in all the wanderings of that creature, dreamy, flimsy,\nanchoring with gossamer, climbing the sky with steps of fog, cast into\nabysms (as great writers call it) by imaginary demons, and even at its\nbest in a queer condition, pitiful, yet exceeding proud. A quarter of\nthe mental power is employed in wanting to know what the other people\nthink; an eighth part ought to be dwelling upon the fair distracting\nobject; and only a small eighth can remain to attend to the business of\nthe solid day. But in spite of all this, such lads get on about as well\nas usual. If Bacchus has a protective power, Venus has no less of it,\nand possibly is more active, as behooves a female.\n\nAnd surely it was a cold-blooded scheme, which even the Revenue should\nhave excised from an honest scale of duties, to catch a poor fellow in\nthe meshes of love, because he was too sharp otherwise. This, however,\nwas the large idea ripening in the breast of Carroway.\n\n\"To-night I shall have him,\" he said to his wife, who was inditing of\nsofter things, her eighth confinement, and the shilling she had laid\nthat it would be a boy this time. \"The weather is stormy, yet the fellow\nmakes love between the showers in a barefaced way. That old fool of a\ntanner knows it, and has no more right feeling than if he were a boy.\nAha, my Robin, fine robin as you are, I shall catch you piping with\nyour Jenny Wren tonight!\" The lieutenant shared the popular ignorance of\nsimplest natural history.\n\n\"Charles, you never should have told me of it. Where is your feeling for\nthe days gone by? And as for his coming between the showers, what should\nI have thought of you if you had made a point of bringing your umbrella?\nMy dear, it is wrong. And I beg you, for my sake, not to catch him with\nhis true love, but only with his tubs.\"\n\n\"Matilda, your mind is weakened by the coming trial of your nerves. I\nwould rather have him with his tubs, of course; they would set us up\nfor several years, and his silks would come in for your churching. But\neverything can not be as we desire. And he carries large pistols when he\nis not courting. Do you wish me to be shot, Matilda?\"\n\n\"Captain Carroway, how little thought you have, to speak to me in that\nway! And I felt before dinner that I never should get over it. Oh, who\nwould have the smugglers on her mind, at such a time?\"\n\n\"My dear, I beg your pardon. Pray exert your strength of mind, and cast\nsuch thoughts away from you--or perhaps it will be a smuggler. And yet\nif it were, how much better it would pay!\"\n\n\"Then I hope it will, Charles; I heartily hope it will be. It would\nserve you quite right to be snaring your own son, after snaring a poor\nyouth through his sweetheart.\"\n\n\"Well, well, time will show. Put me up the flat bottle, Tilly, and the\nknuckle of pork that was left last night. Goodness knows when I shall be\nback; and I never like to rack my mind upon an empty stomach.\"\n\nThe revenue officer had far to go, and was wise in providing provender.\nAnd the weather being on the fall toward the equinox, and the tides\nrunning strong and uncertain, he had made up his mind to fare inland,\ninstead of attempting the watery ways. He felt that he could ride, as\nevery sailor always feels; and he had a fine horse upon hire from his\nbutcher, which the king himself would pay for. The inferior men had been\nsent ahead on foot, with orders to march along and hold their tongues.\nAnd one of these men was John Cadman, the self-same man who had\ndescended the cliff without any footpath. They were all to be ready,\nwith hanger and pistol, in a hole toward Byrsa Cottage.\n\nLieutenant Carroway enjoyed his ride. There are men to whom excitement\nis an elevation of the sad and slow mind, which otherwise seems to have\nnothing to do. And what finer excitement can a good mind have than\nin balancing the chances of its body tumbling out of the saddle, and\nevicting its poor self?\n\nThe mind of Charles Carroway was wide awake to this, and tenderly\nanxious about the bad foot in which its owner ended--because of the\nimportance of the stirrups--and all the sanguine vigor of the heart\n(which seemed to like some thumping) conveyed to the seat of reason\nlittle more than a wish to be well out of it. The brave lieutenant\nholding place, and sticking to it through a sense of duty, and of the\ndifficulty of getting off, remembered to have heard, when quite a little\nboy, that a man who gazes steadily between his horse's ears can not\npossibly tumble off the back. The saying in its wisdom is akin to that\nwhich describes the potency of salt upon a sparrow's tail.\n\nWhile Carroway gloomily pounded the road, with reflection a dangerous\nluxury, things of even deeper interest took their course at the goal of\nhis endeavors. Mary Anerley, still an exile in the house of the tanner,\nby reason of her mother's strict coast-guard, had long been thinking\nthat more injustice is done in the world than ought to be; and\nespecially in the matter of free trade she had imbibed lax opinions,\nwhich may not be abhorrent to a tanner's nature, but were most\nunbecoming to the daughter of a farmer orthodox upon his own land, and\nan officer of King's Fencibles. But how did Mary make this change,\nand upon questions of public policy chop sides, as quickly as a clever\njournal does? She did it in the way in which all women think, whose\nthoughts are of any value, by allowing the heart to go to work, being\nthe more active organ, and create large scenery, into which the tempted\nmind must follow. To anybody whose life has been saved by anybody else,\nthere should arise not only a fine image of the preserver, but a high\nsense of the service done to the universe, which must have gone into\ndeepest mourning if deprived of No. One. And then, almost of necessity,\nsucceeds the investment of this benefactor to the world at large with\nall the great qualities needed for an exploit so stupendous. He has\ndone a great deed, he has proved himself to be gallant, generous,\nmagnanimous; shall I, who exist through his grand nobility, listen\nto his very low enemies? Therefore Robin was an angel now, and his\npersecutors must be demons.\n\nCaptain Lyth had not been slow to enter into his good luck. He knew that\nMaster Popplewell had a cultivated taste for rare old schnapps, while\nthe partner of his life, and labor, and repose, possessed a desire\nfor the finer kinds of lace. Attending to these points, he was always\nwelcome; and the excellent couple encouraged his affection and liberal\ngoodwill toward them. But Mary would accept no presents from him, and\nbehaved for a long time very strangely, and as if she would rather keep\nout of his way. Yet he managed to keep on running after her, as much as\nshe managed to run away; for he had been down now into the hold of his\nheart, searching it with a dark lantern, and there he had discovered\n\"Mary,\" \"Mary,\" not only branded on the hullage of all things, but the\npith and pack of everything; and without any fraud upon charter-party,\nthe cargo entire was \"Mary.\"\n\nWho can tell what a young maid feels, when she herself is doubtful?\nSomehow she has very large ideas, which only come up when she begins to\nthink; and too often, after some very little thing, she exclaims that\nall is rubbish. The key-note of her heart is high, and a lot of things\nfall below harmony, and notably (if she is not a stupe), some of her\nown dear love's expressions before she has made up her soul to love him.\nThis is a hard time for almost any man, who feels his random mind dipped\ninto with a spirit-gauge and a saccharometer. But in spite of all these\nindications, Robin Lyth stuck to himself, which is the right way to get\ncredit for sticking.\n\n\"Johnny, my dear,\" said Deborah Popplewell to her valued husband, just\nabout the time when bold Carroway was getting hot and sore upon the\nFiley Road, yet steadily enlarging all the penance of return, \"things\nought to be coming to a point, I think. We ought not to let them so be\ngoing on forever. Young people like to be married in the spring; the\nbirds are singing, and the price of coal goes down. And they ought to be\nengaged six months at least. We were married in the spring, my dear, the\nTuesday but one that comes next from Easter-day. There was no lilac\nout, but there ought to have been, because it was not sunny. And we have\nnever repented it, you know.\"\n\n\"Never as long as I live shall I forget that day,\" said Popplewell;\n\"they sent me home a suit of clothes as were made for kidney-bean\nsticks. I did want to look nice at church, and crack, crack, crack they\nwent, and out came all the lining. Debby, I had good legs in those days,\nand could crunch down bark like brewers' grains.\"\n\n\"And so you could now, my dear, every bit as well. Scarcely any of the\nyoung men have your legs. How thankful we ought to be for them--and\nteeth! But everything seems to be different now, and nobody has any\ndignity of mind. We sowed broad beans, like a pigeon's foot-tread, out\nand in, all the way to church.\"\n\n\"The folk can never do such things now; we must not expect it of such\ntimes, my dear. Five-and-forty years ago was ninety times better than\nthese days, Debby, except that you and I was steadfast, and mean to\nbe so to the end, God willing. Lord! what are the lasses that He makes\nnow?\"\n\n\"Johnny, they try to look their best; and we must not be hard upon them.\nOur Mary looks well enow, when she hath a color, though my eyes might 'a\nbeen a brighter blue if I never hadn't took to spectacles. Johnny, I am\nsure a'most that she is in her love-time. She crieth at night, which is\nnobody's business; the strings of her night-cap run out of their starch;\nand there looks like a channel on the pillow, though the sharp young\nhussy turns it upside down. I shall be upsides with her, if you won't.\"\n\n\"Certainly it shall be left to you; you are the one to do it best. You\npush her on, and I will stir him up. I will smuggle some schnapps into\nhis tea to-night, to make him look up bolder; as mild as any milk it is.\nWhen I was taken with your cheeks, Debby, and your bit of money, I was\nnever that long in telling you.\"\n\n\"That's true enow, Johnny; you was sarcy. But I'm thinking of the\ntrouble we may get into over at Anerley about it.\"\n\n\"I'll carry that, lass. My back's as broad as Stephen's. What more can\nthey want for her than a fine young fellow, a credit to his business and\nthe country? Lord! how I hate them rough coast-riders! it wouldn't be\ngood for them to come here.\"\n\n\"Then they are here, I tell you, and much they care. You seem to me to\nhave shut your eyes since ever you left off tanning. How many times have\nI told you, John, that a sneaking fellow hath got in with Sue? I saw\nhim with my own eyes last night skulking past the wicket-gate; and the\ngirl's addle-pate is completely turned. You think her such a wonder,\nthat you won't hearken. But I know the women best, I do.\"\n\n\"Out of this house she goes, neck and crop, if what you say is true,\nDeb. Don't say it again, that's a kind, good soul; it spoils my pipe to\nthink of it.\"\n\nToward sundown Robin Lyth appeared, according to invitation. Dandy as\nhe generally was, he looked unusually smart this time, with snow-white\nducks and a velvet waistcoat, pumps like a dressing-glass, lace to his\nshirt, and a blue coat with gold buttons. His keen eyes glanced about\nfor Mary, and sparkled as soon as she came down; and when he took her\nhand she blushed, and was half afraid to look at him; for she felt in\nher heart that he meant to say something, if he could find occasion; but\nher heart did not tell her what answer she would make, because of her\nfather's grief and wrath; so she tried to hope that nothing would be\nsaid, and she kept very near her good aunt's apron-string. Such tactics,\nhowever, were doomed to defeat. The host and hostess of Byrsa Cottage\nwere very proud of the tea they gave to any distinguished visitor.\nTea was a luxury, being very dear, and although large quantities were\nsmuggled, the quality was not, like that of other goods so imported,\nequal or superior to the fair legitimate staple. And Robin, who never\nwas shy of his profession, confessed that he could not supply a cup so\ngood.\n\n\"You shall come and have another out-of-doors, my friend,\" said his\nentertainer, graciously. \"Mary, take the captain's cup to the bower;\nthe rain has cleared off, and the evening will be fine. I will smoke my\npipe, and we will talk adventures. Things have happened to me that would\nmake you stare, if I could bring myself to tell them. Ah yes, I have\nlived in stirring times. Fifty years ago men and women knew their minds;\nand a dog could eat his dinner without a damask napkin.\"\n\nMaster Popplewell, who was of a good round form, and tucked his heels\nover one another as he walked (which indicates a pleasant self-esteem),\nnow lit his long pipe and marched ahead, carefully gazing to the front\nand far away; so that the young folk might have free boot and free\nhand behind him. That they should have flutters of loving-kindness, and\ncrafty little breaths of whispering, and extraordinary gifts of just\nlooking at each other in time not to be looked at again, as well as a\nstrange sort of in and out of feeling, as if they were patterned with\nthe same zigzag--as the famous Herefordshire graft is made--and above\nall the rest, that they should desire to have no one in the world to\nlook at them, was to be expected by a clever old codger, a tanner who\nhad realized a competence, and eaten many \"tanner's pies.\" The which is\na good thing; and so much the better because it costs nothing save the\ncrust and the coal. But instead of any pretty little goings on such as\nthis worthy man made room for, to tell the stupid truth, this lad and\nlass came down the long walk as far apart and as independent of one\nanother as two stakes of an espalier. There had not been a word gone\namiss between them, nor even a thought the wrong way of the grain; but\nthe pressure of fear and of prickly expectation was upon them both, and\nkept them mute. The lad was afraid that he would get \"nay,\" and the lass\nwas afraid that she could not give it.\n\nThe bower was quite at the end of the garden, through and beyond the\npot-herb part, and upon a little bank which overhung a little lane.\nHere in this corner a good woman had contrived what women nearly always\nunderstand the best, a little nook of pleasure and of perfume, after the\nrank ranks of the kitchen-stuff. Not that these are to be disdained; far\notherwise; they indeed are the real business; and herein lies true test\nof skill. But still the flowers may declare that they do smell better.\nAnd not only were there flowers here, and little shrubs planted\nsprucely, but also good grass, which is always softness, and soothes\nthe impatient eyes of men. And on this grass there stood, or hung, or\nflowered, or did whatever it was meant to do, a beautiful weeping-ash,\nthe only one anywhere in that neighborhood.\n\n\"I can't look at skies, and that--have seen too many of them. You young\nfolk, go and chirp under the tree. What I want is a little rum and\nwater.\"\n\nWith these words the tanner went into his bower, where he kept a good\nstore of materials in moss; and the plaited ivy of the narrow entrance\nshook with his voice, and steps, and the decision of his thoughts. For\nhe wanted to see things come to a point, and his only way to do it was\nto get quite out of sight. Such fools the young people of the age were\nnow!\n\nWhile his thoughts were such, or scarcely any better, his partner in\nlife came down the walk, with a heap of little things which she thought\nneedful for the preservation of the tanner, and she waddled a little and\nturned her toes out, for she as well was roundish.\n\n\"Ah, you ought to have Sue. Where is Sue?\" said Master Popplewell.\n\"Now come you in out of the way of the wind, Debby; you know how your\nback-sinew ached with the darning before last wash.\"\n\nMrs. Popplewell grumbled, but obeyed; for she saw that her lord had\nhis reasons. So Mary and Robin were left outside, quite as if they were\nnothing to any but themselves. Mary was aware of all this manoeuvring,\nand it brought a little frown upon her pretty forehead, as if she\nwere cast before the feet of Robin Lyth; but her gentleness prevailed,\nbecause they meant her well. Under the weeping-ash there was a little\nseat, and the beauty of it was that it would not hold two people. She\nsat down upon it, and became absorbed in the clouds that were busy with\nthe sunset.\n\nThese were very beautiful, as they so often are in the broken weather\nof the autumn; but sailors would rather see fair sky, and Robin's fair\nheaven was in Mary's eyes. At these he gazed with a natural desire to\nlearn what the symptoms of the weather were; but it seemed as if little\ncould be made out there, because everything seemed so lofty: perhaps\nMary had forgotten his existence.\n\nCould any lad of wax put up with this, least of all a daring mariner?\nHe resolved to run the cargo of his heart right in, at the risk of all\nbreakers and drawn cutlasses; and to make a good beginning he came up\nand took her hand. The tanner in the bower gave approval with a cough,\nlike Cupid with a sneeze; then he turned it to a snore.\n\n\"Mary, why do you carry on like this?\" the smuggler inquired, in a very\ngentle voice. \"I have done nothing to offend you, have I? That would be\nthe last thing I would ever do.\"\n\n\"Captain Lyth, you are always very good; you never should think such\nthings of me. I am just looking at a particular cloud. And who ever said\nthat you might call me 'Mary'?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the particular cloud said so; but you must have been the cloud\nyourself, for you told me only yesterday.\"\n\n\"Then I will never say another word about it; but people should not take\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Who are people? How you talk! quite as if I were somebody you never saw\nbefore. I should like you just to look round now, and let me see why you\nare so different from yourself.\"\n\nMary Anerley looked round; for she always did what people liked, without\ngood reason otherwise; and if her mind was full of clouds, her eyes had\nlittle sign of them.\n\n\"You look as lovely as you always do,\" said the smuggler, growing bolder\nas she looked at something else. \"You know long ago what my opinion of\nyou is, and yet you seem to take no notice. Now I must be off, as you\nknow, to-night; not for any reason of my own, as I told you yesterday,\nbut to carry out a contract. I may not see you for many months again;\nand you may fall in love with a Preventive man.\"\n\n\"I never fall in love with anybody. Why should I go from one extreme to\nthe other? Captain Carroway has seven children, as well as a very active\nwife.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of Carroway, in love or in war. He is an honest fellow,\nwith no more brains than this ash-tree over us. I mean the dashing\ncaptains who come in with their cutters, and would carry you off as soon\nas look.\"\n\n\"Captain Lyth, you are not at all considering what you say: those\nofficers do not want me--they want you.\"\n\n\"Then they shall get neither; they may trust me for that. But, Mary, do\ntell me how your heart is; you know well how mine has been for ever such\na time. I tell you downright that I have thought of girls before--\"\n\n\"Oh, I was not at all aware of that; surely you had better go on with\nthinking of them.\"\n\n\"You have not heard me out. I have only thought of them; nothing more\nthan thinking, in a foolish sort of way. But of you I do not think; I\nseem to feel you all through me.\"\n\n\"What sort of a sensation do I seem to be? A foolish one, I suppose,\nlike all those many others.\"\n\n\"No, not at all. A very wise one; a regular knowledge that I can not\nlive without you; a certainty that I could only mope about a little--\"\n\n\"And not run any more cargoes on the coast?\"\n\n\"Not a single tub, nor a quarter bale of silk; except, of course, what\nis under contract now; and, if you should tell me that you can not care\nabout me--\"\n\n\"Hush! I am almost sure that I hear footsteps. Listen, just a moment.\"\n\n\"No, I will not listen to any one in the world but you. I beg you not to\ntry to put me off. Think of the winter, and the long time coming; say\nif you will think of me. I must allow that I am not, like you, of a\nrespectable old family. The Lord alone knows where I came from, or where\nI may go to. My business is a random and up-and-down one, but no one can\ncall it disreputable; and if you went against it, I would throw it up.\nThere are plenty of trades that I can turn my hand to; and I will turn\nit to anything you please, if you will only put yours inside it. Mary,\nonly let me have your hand; and you need not say anything unless you\nlike.\"\n\n\"But I always do like to say something, when things are brought before\nme so. I have to consider my father, and my mother, and others belonging\nto me. It is not as if I were all alone, and could do exactly as I\npleased. My father bears an ill-will toward free trade; and my mother\nhas made bad bargains, when she felt sure of very good ones.\"\n\n\"I know that there are rogues about,\" Robin answered, with a judicial\nfrown; \"but foul play never should hurt fair play; and we haul\nthem through the water when we catch them. Your father is terribly\nparticular, I know, and that is the worst thing there can be; but I do\nnot care a groat for all objections, Mary, unless the objection begins\nwith you. I am sure by your eyes, and your pretty lips and forehead,\nthat you are not the one to change. If once any lucky fellow wins your\nheart, he will have it--unless he is a fool--forever. I can do most\nthings, but not that, or you never would be thinking about the other\npeople. What would anybody be to me in comparison with you, if I only\nhad the chance? I would kick them all to Jericho. Can you see it in that\nway? can you get hot every time you think of me?\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Mary, looking very gently at him, because of his serious\nexcitement, \"you are very good, and very brave, and have done wonders\nfor me; but why should I get hot?\"\n\n\"No, I suppose it is not to be expected. When I am in great peril I grow\nhot, and tingle, and am alive all over. Men of a loftier courage grow\ncold; it depends upon the constitution; but I enjoy it more than they\ndo, and I can see things ten times quicker. Oh, how I wish I was Nelson!\nhow he must enjoy himself!\"\n\n\"But if you have love of continual danger, and eagerness to be always\nat it,\" said Mary, with wide Yorkshire sense, much as she admired this\nheroic type, \"the proper thing for you to do is to lead a single life.\nYou might be enjoying all the danger very much; but what would your wife\nat home be doing? Only to knit, and sigh, and lie awake.\"\n\nMary made a bad hit here. This picture was not at all deterrent; so\ndaring are young men, and so selfish.\n\n\"Nothing of that sort should ever come to pass,\" cried Robin, with the\ngaze of the head of a household, \"supposing only that my wife was you.\nI would be home regularly every night before the kitchen clock struck\neight. I would always come home with an appetite, and kiss you, and do\nboth my feet upon the scraper. I would ask how the baby was, and carry\nhim about, and go 'one, two, three,' as the nurses do, I would quite\nleave the government to put on taxes, and pay them--if I could--without\na word of grumble. I would keep every rope about the house in order, as\nonly a sailor knows how to do, and fettle my own mending, and carry out\nmy orders, and never meddle with the kitchen, at least unless my opinion\nwas sought for concerning any little thing that might happen to be meant\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed Mary, \"you quite take my breath away. I had no idea\nthat you were so clever. In return for all these wonders, what should\npoor I have to do?\"\n\n\"Poor I would only have to say just once, 'Robin, I will have you, and\nbegin to try to love you.'\"\n\n\"I am afraid that it has been done long ago; and the thing that I ought\nto do is to try and help it.\"\n\nWhat happened upon this it would be needless to report, and not only\nneedless, but a vast deal worse--shabby, interloping, meddlesome and\nmean, undignified, unmanly, and disreputably low; for even the tanner\nand his wife (who must have had right to come forward, if anybody had)\nfelt that their right was a shadow, and kept back as if they were a\nhundred miles away, and took one another by the hand and nodded, as much\nas to say: \"You remember how we did it; better than that, my dear. Here\nis your good health.\"\n\nThis being so, and the time so sacred to the higher emotions, even\nthe boldest intruder should endeavor to check his ardor for intrusion.\nWithout any inkling of Preventive Force, Robin and Mary, having once\ndone away with all that stood between them, found it very difficult to\nbe too near together; because of all the many things that each had for\nto say. They seemed to get into an unwise condition of longing to know\nmatters that surely could not matter. When did each of them first feel\nsure of being meant only for the other nobler one? At first sight, of\ncourse, and with a perfect gift of seeing how much loftier each was\nthan the other; and what an extraordinary fact it was that in everything\nimaginable they were quite alike, except in the palpable certainty\npossessed by each of the betterness of the other. What an age it seemed\nsince first they met, positively without thinking, and in the very\nmiddle of a skirmish, yet with a remarkable drawing out of perceptions\none anotherward! Did Mary feel this, when she acted so cleverly, and\nled away those vile pursuers? and did Robin, when his breath came back,\ndiscover why his heart was glowing in the rabbit-hole? Questions of such\ndepth can not be fathomed in a moment; and even to attempt to do any\njustice to them, heads must be very long laid together. Not only so, but\nalso it is of prime necessity to make sure that every whisper goes into\nthe proper ear, and abides there only, and every subtlety of glance, and\nevery nicety of touch, gets warm with exclusive reciprocity. It is\nnot too much to say that in so sad a gladness the faculties of\nself-preservation are weak, when they ought to be most active; therefore\nit should surprise nobody (except those who are so far above all\nsurprise) to become aware that every word they said, and everything\n(even doubly sacred) that they did, was well entered into, and\nthoroughly enjoyed, by a liberal audience of family-minded men, who had\nbeen through pretty scenes like this, and quietly enjoyed dry memory.\n\nCadman, Ellis, and Dick Hackerbody were in comfortable places of\nretirement, just under the combing of the hedge; all waiting for a\nwhistle, yet at leisure to enjoy the whisper, the murmur, or even the\nsigh, of a genuine piece of \"sweet-hearting.\" Unjust as it may be, and\nhard, and truly narrow, there does exist in the human mind, or at least\nin the masculine half of it, a strong conviction that a man in love is a\nman in a scrape, in a hole, in a pitfall, in a pitiful condition,\nuntrue for the moment to the brotherhood of man, and cast down among the\ninferior vessels. And instead of being sorry for him, those who are all\nright look down, and glory over him, with very ancient gibes. So these\nthree men, instead of being touched at heart by soft confessions, laid\nhard hands to wrinkled noses.\n\n\"Mary, I vow to you, as I stand here,\" said Robin, for the fiftieth\ntime, leading her nearer to the treacherous hedge, as he pressed her\ntrembling hand, and gazed with deep ecstasy into her truthful eyes, \"I\nwill live only to deserve you, darling. I will give up everything and\neverybody in the world, and start afresh. I will pay king's duty upon\nevery single tub; and set up in the tea and spirit line, with his\nMajesty's arms upon the lintel. I will take a large contract for the\nroyal navy, who never get anything genuine, and not one of them ever\nknows good from bad--\"\n\n\"That's a dirty lie, Sir. In the king's name I arrest you.\"\n\nLieutenant Carroway leaped before them, flourishing a long sword, and\ndancing with excitement, in this the supreme moment of his life. At the\nsame instant three men came bursting through the hedge, drew hangers,\nand waited for orders. Robin Lyth, in the midst of his love, was so\namazed, that he stood like a boy under orders to be caned.\n\n\"Surrender, Sir! Down with your arms; you are my prisoner. Strike to his\nMajesty. Hands to your side! or I run you through like Jack Robinson!\nKeep back, men. He belongs to me.\"\n\nBut Carroway counted his chicks too soon; or at any rate he overlooked\na little chick. For while he was making fine passes (having learned the\nrudiments of swordsmanship beyond other British officers), and just as\nhe was executing a splendid flourish, upon his bony breast lay Mary. She\nflung her arms round him, so that move he could not without grievously\ntearing her; and she managed, in a very wicked way, to throw the whole\nweight of two bodies on his wounded heel. A flash of pain shot up to his\nvery sword; and down he went, with Mary to protect him, or at any rate\nto cover him. His three men, like true Britons, stood in position, and\nwaited for their officer to get up and give orders.\n\nThese three men showed such perfect discipline that Robin was invited to\nknock them down, as if they had simply been three skittles in a row;\nhe recovered his presence of mind and did it; and looking back at Mary,\nreceived signal to be off. Perceiving that his brave love would take\nno harm--for the tanner was come forth blustering loudly, and Mrs.\nPopplewell with shrieks and screams enough to prevent the whole\nPreventive Service--the free-trader kissed his hand to Mary, and was\nlost through the bushes, and away into the dark.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nLOVE PENITENT\n\n\n\"I tell you, Captain Anerley, that she knocked me down. Your daughter\nthere, who looks as if butter would not melt in her mouth, knocked down\nCommander Carroway of his Majesty's coastguard, like a royal Bengal\ntiger, Sir. I am not come to complain; such an action I would scorn; and\nI admire the young lady for her spirit, Sir. My sword was drawn; no man\ncould have come near me; but before I could think, Sir, I was lying on\nmy back. Do you call that constitutional?\"\n\n\"Mary, lof, however could you think it--to knock down Captain Carroway?\"\n\n\"Father, I never did. He went down of himself, because he was\nflourishing about so. I never thought what I was doing of at all. And\nwith all my heart I beg his pardon. What right had you, Sir, to come\nspying after me?\"\n\nThis interview was not of the common sort. Lieutenant Carroway, in full\nuniform, was come to Anerley Farm that afternoon; not for a moment to\ncomplain of Mary, but to do his duty, and to put things straight; while\nMary had insisted upon going home at once from the hospitable house of\nUncle Popplewell, who had also insisted upon going with her, and taking\nhis wife to help the situation.\n\nA council had been called immediately, with Mistress Anerley presiding;\nand before it had got beyond the crying stage, in marched the brave\nlieutenant.\n\nStephen Anerley was reserving his opinion--which generally means that\nthere is none yet to reserve--but in his case there would be a great\ndeal by-and-by. Master Popplewell had made up his mind and his wife's,\nlong ago, and confirmed it in the one-horse shay, while Mary was riding\nLord Keppel in the rear; and the mind of the tanner was as tough as good\noak bark. His premises had been intruded upon--the property which he had\nbought with his own money saved by years of honest trade, his private\ngarden, his ornamental bower, his wife's own pleasure-plot, at a sacred\nmoment invaded, trampled, and outraged by a scurvy preventive-man and\nhis low crew. The first thing he had done to the prostrate Carroway was\nto lay hold of him by the collar, and shake his fist at him and demand\nhis warrant--a magistrate's warrant, or from the crown itself. The poor\nlieutenant having none to show, \"Then I will have the law of you, Sir,\"\nthe tanner shouted; \"if it costs me two hundred and fifty pounds. I\nam known for a man, Sir, who sticks to his word; and my attorney is a\ngenuine bulldog.\"\n\nThis had frightened Carroway more than fifty broadsides. Truly he loved\nfighting; but the boldest sailor bears away at prospect of an action at\nlaw. Popplewell saw this, and stuck to his advantage, and vowed, until\nbed-time, satisfaction he would have; and never lost the sight of it\nuntil he fell asleep.\n\nEven now it was in his mind, as Carroway could see; his eyebrows meant\nit, and his very surly nod, and the way in which he put his hands far\ndown into his pockets. The poor lieutenant, being well aware that zeal\nhad exceeded duty (without the golden amnesty of success), and finding\nout that Popplewell was rich and had no children, did his very best to\nlook with real pleasure at him, and try to raise a loftier feeling in\nhis breast than damages. But the tanner only frowned, and squared his\nelbows, and stuck his knuckles sharply out of both his breeches pockets.\nAnd Mrs. Popplewell, like a fat and most kind-hearted lady, stared at\nthe officer as if she longed to choke him.\n\n\"I tell you again, Captain Anerley,\" cried the lieutenant, with his\ntemper kindling, \"that no consideration moved me, Sir, except that of\nduty. As for my spying after any pretty girls, my wife, who is now down\nwith her eighth baby, would get up sooner than hear of it. If I intruded\nupon your daughter, so as to justify her in knocking me down, Captain\nAnerley, it was because--well I won't say, Mary, I won't say; we have\nall been young; and our place is to know better.\"\n\n\"Sir, you are a gentleman,\" cried Popplewell with heat; \"here is\nmy hand, and you may trespass on my premises, without bringing any\nattorney.\"\n\n\"Did you say her eighth baby? Oh, Commander Carroway,\" Mrs. Popplewell\nbegan to whisper; \"what a most interesting situation! Oh, I see why you\nhave such high color, Sir.\"\n\n\"Madam, it is enough to make me pale. At the same time I do like\nsympathy; and my dear wife loves the smell of tan.\"\n\n\"We have retired, Sir, many years ago, and purchased a property near the\nseaside; and from the front gate you must have seen--But oh, I forgot,\ncaptain, you came through the hedge, or at any rate down the row of\nkidney-beans.\"\n\n\"I want to know the truth,\" shouted Stephen Anerley, who had been\nploughing through his brow into his brain, while he kept his eyes\nfixed upon his daughter's, and there found abashment, but no abasement;\n\"naught have I to do with any little goings on, or whether an action was\na gentleman's or not. That question belongs to the regulars, I wand, or\nto the folk who have retired. Nobbut a farmer am I, in little business;\nbut concerning of my children I will have my say. All of you tell me\nwhat is this about my Mary.\"\n\nAs if he would drag their thoughts out of them, he went from one to\nanother with a hard quick glance, which they all tried to shun; for they\ndid not want to tell until he should get into a better frame of mind.\nAnd they looked at Mistress Anerley, to come forth and take his edge\noff; but she knew that when his eyes were so, to interfere was mischief.\nBut Carroway did not understand the man.\n\n\"Come, now, Anerley,\" the bold lieutenant said; \"what are you getting\ninto such a way about? I would sooner have lost the hundred pounds twice\nover, and a hundred of my own--if so be I ever had it--than get little\nMary into such a row as this. Why, Lord bless my heart, one would think\nthat there was murder in a little bit of sweethearting. All pretty girls\ndo it; and the plain ones too. Come and smoke a pipe, my good fellow,\nand don't terrify her.\"\n\nFor Mary was sobbing in a corner by herself, without even her mother to\ncome up and say a word.\n\n\"My daughter never does it,\" answered Stephen Anerley; \"my daughter is\nnot like the foolish girls and women. My daughter knows her mind; and\nwhat she does she means to do. Mary, lof, come to your father, and tell\nhim that every one is lying of you. Sooner would I trust a single quiet\nword of yours, than a pile, as big as Flambro Head, sworn by all the\nworld together against my little Mary.\"\n\nThe rest of them, though much aggrieved by such a bitter calumny, held\ntheir peace, and let him go with open arms toward his Mary. The farmer\nsmiled, that his daughter might not have any terror of his public talk;\nand because he was heartily expecting her to come and tell him some\ntrifle, and be comforted, and then go for a good happy cry, while he\nshut off all her enemies.\n\nBut instead of any nice work of that nature, Mary Anerley arose and\nlooked at the people in the room--which was their very best, and by no\nmeans badly furnished--and after trying to make out, as a very trifling\nmatter, what their unsettled minds might be, her eyes came home to her\nfather's, and did not flinch, although they were so wet.\n\nMaster Anerley, once and forever, knew that his daughter was gone from\nhim. That a stronger love than one generation can have for the one\nbefore it--pure and devoted and ennobling as that love is--now had\narisen, and would force its way. He did not think it out like that,\nfor his mind was not strictly analytic--however his ideas were to that\neffect, which is all that need be said about them.\n\n\"Every word of it is true,\" the girl said, gently; \"father, I have\ndone every word of what they say, except about knocking down Captain\nCarroway. I have promised to marry Robin Lyth, by-and-by, when you agree\nto it.\"\n\nStephen Anerley's ruddy cheeks grew pale, and his blue eyes glittered\nwith amazement. He stared at his daughter till her gaze gave way; and\nthen he turned to his wife, to see whether she had heard of it. \"I told\nyou so,\" was all she said; and that tended little to comfort him. But he\nbroke forth into no passion, as he might have done with justice and some\nbenefit, but turned back quietly and looked at his Mary, as if he were\nsaying, once for all, \"good-by.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't, father, don't,\" the girl answered with a sob; \"revile me, or\nbeat me, or do anything but that. That is more than I can bear.\"\n\n\"Have I ever reviled you? Have I ever beaten you?\"\n\n\"Never--never once in all my life. But I beg you--I implore of you to do\nit now. Oh, father, perhaps I have deserved it.\"\n\n\"You know best what you deserve. But no bad word shall you have of me.\nOnly you must be careful for the future never to call me 'father.'\"\n\nThe farmer forgot all his visitors, and walked, without looking at\nanybody, toward the porch. Then that hospitable spot re-awakened his\ngood manners, and he turned and smiled as if he saw them all sitting\ndown to something juicy.\n\n\"My good friends, make yourselves at home,\" he said; \"the mistress will\nsee to you while I look round. I shall be back directly, and we will\nhave an early supper.\"\n\nBut when he got outside, and was alone with earth and sky, big tears\narose into his brave blue eyes, and he looked at his ricks, and his\nworkmen in the distance, and even at the favorite old horse that\nwhinnied and came to have his white nose rubbed, as if none of them\nbelonged to him ever any more. \"A' would sooner have heard of broken\nbank,\" he muttered to himself and to the ancient horse, \"fifty times\nsooner, and begin the world anew, only to have Mary for a little child\nagain.\"\n\nAs the sound of his footsteps died away, the girl hurried out of the\nroom, as if she were going to run after him; but suddenly stopped in\nthe porch, as she saw that he scarcely even cared to feel the cheek of\nLightfoot, who made a point of rubbing up his master's whiskers with it,\n\"Better wait, and let him come round,\" thought Mary; \"I never did\nsee him so put out.\" Then she ran up the stairs to the window on the\nlanding, and watched her dear father grow dimmer and dimmer up the\ndistance of the hill, with a bright young tear for every sad old step.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nDOWN AMONG THE DEAD WEEDS\n\n\nCan it be supposed that all this time Master Geoffrey Mordacks, of the\ncity of York, land agent, surveyor, and general factor, and maker and\ndoer of everything whether general or particular, was spending his days\nin doing nothing, and his nights in dreaming? If so, he must have had\na sunstroke on that very bright day of the year when he stirred up\nthe minds of the washer-women, and the tongue of Widow Precious. But\nFlamborough is not at all the place for sunstroke, although it reflects\nso much in whitewash; neither had Mordacks the head to be sunstruck, but\na hard, impenetrable, wiry poll, as weather-proof as felt asphalted. At\nfirst sight almost everybody said that he must have been a soldier, at a\ntime when soldiers were made of iron, whalebone, whip-cord, and ramrods.\nSuch opinions he rewarded with a grin, and shook his straight shoulders\nstraighter. If pride of any sort was not beneath him, as a matter of\nstrict business, it was the pride which he allowed his friends to take\nin his military figure and aspect.\n\nThis gentleman's place of business was scarcely equal to the\nexpectations which might have been formed from a view of the owner. The\nold King's Staith, on the right hand after crossing Ouse Bridge from\nthe Micklegate, is a passageway scarcely to be called a street, but\ncombining the features of an alley, a lane, a jetty, a quay, and a\nbarge-walk, and ending ignominiously. Nevertheless, it is a lively place\nsometimes, and in moments of excitement. Also it is a good place for\nbusiness, and for brogue of the broadest; and a man who is unable to be\nhappy there, must have something on his mind unusual. Geoffrey Mordacks\nhad nothing on his mind except other people's business; which (as in\nthe case of Lawyer Jellicorse) is a very favorable state of the human\nconstitution for happiness.\n\nBut though Mr. Mordacks attended so to other people's business, he would\nnot have anybody to attend to his. No partner, no clerk, no pupil, had\na hand in the inner breast pockets of his business; there was nothing\nmysterious about his work, but he liked to follow it out alone. Things\nthat were honest and wise came to him to be carried out with judgment;\nand he knew that the best way to carry them out is to act with discreet\ncandor. For the slug shall be known by his slime; and the spider who\nshams death shall receive it.\n\nNow here, upon a very sad November afternoon, when the Northern day\nwas narrowing in; and the Ouse, which is usually of a ginger-color,\nwas nearly as dark as a nutmeg; and the bridge, and the staith, and the\nhouses, and the people, resembled one another in tint and tone; while\nbetween the Minster and the Clifford Tower there was not much difference\nof outline--here and now Master Geoffrey Mordacks was sitting in\nthe little room where strangers were received. The live part of his\nhousehold consisted of his daughter, and a very young Geoffrey, who did\nmore harm than good, and a thoroughly hard-working country maid, whose\nslowness was gradually giving way to pressure.\n\nThe weather was enough to make anybody dull, and the sap of every human\nthing insipid; and the time of day suggested tea, hot cakes, and the\ncrossing of comfortable legs. Mordacks could well afford all these good\nthings, and he never was hard upon his family; but every day he liked\nto feel that he had earned the bread of it, and this day he had labored\nwithout seeming to earn anything. For after all the ordinary business of\nthe morning, he had been devoting several hours to the diligent revisal\nof his premises and data, in a matter which he was resolved to carry\nthrough, both for his credit and his interest. And this was the matter\nwhich had cost him two days' ride, from York to Flamborough, and three\ndays on the road home, as was natural after such a dinner as he made\nin little Denmark. But all that trouble he would not have minded,\nespecially after his enjoyment of the place, if it had only borne good\nfruit. He had felt quite certain that it must do this, and that he would\nhave to pay another visit to the Head, and eat another duck, and have a\nflirt with Widow Precious.\n\nBut up to the present time nothing had come of it, and so far as he\ncould see he might just as well have spared himself that long rough\nride. Three months had passed, and that surely was enough for even\nFlamborough folk to do something, if they ever meant to do it. It was\nplain that he had been misled for once, that what he suspected had\nnot come to pass, and that he must seek elsewhere the light which\nhad gleamed upon him vainly from the Danish town. To this end he went\nthrough all his case again, while hope (being very hard to beat, as\nusual) kept on rambling over everything unsettled, with a very sage\nconviction that there must be something there, and doubly sure, because\nthere was no sign of it.\n\nMen at the time of life which he had reached, conducting their bodies\nwith less suppleness of joint, and administering food to them with\ngreater care, begin to have doubts about their intellect as well,\nwhether it can work as briskly as it used to do. And the mind, falling\nunder this discouragement of doubt, asserts itself amiss, in making\nfutile strokes, even as a gardener can never work his best while\nconscious of suspicious glances through the window-blinds. Geoffrey\nMordacks told himself that it could not be the self it used to be, in\nthe days when no mistakes were made, but everything was evident at half\na glance, and carried out successfully with only half a hand. In this\nFlamborough matter he had felt no doubt of running triumphantly through,\nand being crowned with five hundred pounds in one issue of the case, and\nfive thousand in the other. But lo! here was nothing. And he must reply,\nby the next mail, that he had made a sad mistake.\n\nSuddenly, while he was rubbing his wiry head with irritation, and poring\nover his letters for some clew, like a dunce going back through his\npot-hooks, suddenly a great knock sounded through the house--one, two,\nthree--like the thumping of a mallet on a cask, to learn whether any\nbeer may still be hoped for.\n\n\"This must be a Flamborough man,\" cried Master Mordacks, jumping up;\n\"that is how I heard them do it; they knock the doors, instead of\nknocking at them. It would be a very strange thing just now if news were\nto come from Flamborough; but the stranger a thing is, the more it can\nbe trusted, as often is the case with human beings. Whoever it is, show\nthem up at once,\" he shouted down the narrow stairs; for no small noise\nwas arising in the passage.\n\n\"A' canna coom oop. I wand a' canna,\" was the answer in Kitty's\nwell-known brogue; \"how can a', when a' hanna got naa legs?\"\n\n\"Oh ho! I see,\" said Mr. Mordacks to himself; \"my veteran friend from\nthe watch-tower, doubtless. A man with no legs would not have come so\nfar for nothing. Show the gentleman into the parlor, Kitty; and Miss\nArabella may bring her work up here.\"\n\nThe general factor, though eager for the news, knew better than to\nshow any haste about it; so he kept the old mariner just long enough in\nwaiting to damp a too covetous ardor, and then he complacently locked\nArabella in her bedroom, and bolted off Kitty in the basement; because\nthey both were sadly inquisitive, and this strange arrival had excited\nthem.\n\n\"Ah, mine ancient friend of the tower! Veteran Joseph, if my memory is\nright,\" Mr. Mordacks exclaimed, in his lively way, as he went up and\noffered the old tar both hands, to seat him in state upon the sofa; but\nthe legless sailor condemned \"them swabs,\" and crutched himself into\na hard-bottomed chair. Then he pulled off his hat, and wiped his white\nhead with a shred of old flag, and began hunting for his pipe.\n\n\"First time I ever was in York city; and don't think much of it, if this\nhere is a sample.\"\n\n\"Joseph, you must not be supercilious,\" his host replied, with an\namiable smile; \"you will see things better through a glass of grog; and\nthe state of the weather points to something dark. You have had a\nlong journey, and the scenery is new. Rum shall it be, my friend? Your\ncountenance says 'yes.' Rum, like a ruby of the finest water, have I;\nand no water shall you have with it. Said I well? A man without legs\nmust keep himself well above water.\"\n\n\"First time I ever was in York city,\" the ancient watchman answered,\n\"and grog must be done as they does it here. A berth on them old walls\nwould suit me well; and no need to travel such a distance for my beer.\"\n\n\"And you would be the man of all the world for such a berth,\" said\nMaster Mordacks, gravely, as he poured the sparkling liquor into a glass\nthat was really a tumbler; \"for such a post we want a man who is himself\na post; a man who will not quit his duty, just because he can not, which\nis the only way of making sure. Joseph, your idea is a very good one,\nand your beer could be brought to you at the middle of each watch. I\nhave interest; you shall be appointed.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am obligated to you,\" said the watchman; \"but never could I live\na month without a wink of sea-stuff. The coming of the clouds, and the\ndipping of the land, and the waiting of the distance for what may come\nto be in it; let alone how they goes changing of their color, and making\nof a noise that is always out of sight: it is the very same as my beer\nis to me. Master, I never could get on without it.\"\n\n\"Well, I can understand a thing like that,\" Mordacks answered,\ngraciously; \"my water-butt leaked for three weeks, pat, pat, all night\nlong upon a piece of slate, and when a man came and caulked it up, I put\nall the blame upon the pillow; but the pillow was as good as ever. Not a\nwink could I sleep till it began to leak again; and you may trust a\nYork workman that it wasn't very long. But, Joseph, I have interest at\nScarborough also. The castle needs a watchman for fear of tumbling down;\nand that is not the soldiers' business, because they are inside. There\nyou could have quantities of sea-stuff, my good friend; and the tap at\nthe Hooked Cod is nothing to it there. Cheer up, Joseph, we will land\nyou yet. How the devil did you manage, now, to come so far?\"\n\n\"Well, now, your honor, I had rare luck for it, as I must say, ever\nsince I set eyes on you. There comes a son of mine as I thought were\nlost at sea; but not he, blow me! nearly all of him come back, with a\nhandful of guineas, and the memory of his father. Lord! I could have\ncried; and he up and blubbered fairly, a trick as he learned from ten\nFrenchmen he had killed. Ah! he have done his work well, and aimed a\ngood conduck--fourpence-halfpenny a day, so long as ever he shall live\nhereafter.\"\n\n\"In this world you mean, I suppose, my friend; but be not overcome; such\nthings will happen. But what did you do with all that money, Joseph?\"\n\n\"We never wasted none of it, not half a groat, Sir. We finished out the\ncellar at the Hooked Cod first; and when Mother Precious made a\ngrumble of it, we gave her the money for to fill it up again, upon\nthe understanding to come back when it was ready; and then we went to\nBurlington, and spent the rest in poshays like two gentlemen; and when\nwe was down upon our stumps at last, for only one leg there is between\nus both, your honor, my boy he ups and makes a rummage in his traps;\nwhich the Lord he put it into his mind to do so, when he were gone a\nfew good sheets in the wind; and there sure enough he finds five good\nguineas in the tail of an old hankercher he had clean forgotten; and\nhe says, 'Now, father, you take care of them. Let us go and see the\ncapital, and that good gentleman, as you have picked up a bit of news\nfor.' So we shaped a course for York, on board the schooner Mary Anne,\nand from Goole in a barge as far as this here bridge; and here we are,\nhigh and dry, your honor. I was half a mind to bring in my boy Bob; but\nhe saith, 'Not without the old chap axes;' and being such a noisy one,\nI took him at his word; though he hath found out what there was to\nfind--not me.\"\n\n\"How noble a thing is parental love!\" cried the general factor, in\nhis hard, short way, which made many people trust him, because it was\nunpleasant; \"and filial duty of unfathomable grog! Worthy Joseph, let\nyour narrative proceed.\"\n\n\"They big words is beyond me, Sir. What use is any man to talk over a\nchap's head?\"\n\n\"Then, dash your eyes, go on, Joe. Can you understand that, now?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir, I can, and I likes a thing put sensible. If the gentlemen\nwould always speak like that, there need be no difference atween us.\nWell, it was all along of all that money-bag of Bob's that he and I\nfound out anything. What good were your guinea? Who could stand treat\non that more than a night or two, and the right man never near you? But\nwhen you keep a good shop open for a month, as Bob and me did with Widow\nTapsy, it standeth to reason that you must have everybody, to be called\nat all respectable, for miles and miles around. For the first few nights\nor so some on 'em holds off--for an old chalk against them, or for doubt\nof what is forrard, or for cowardliness of their wives, or things they\nmay have sworn to stop, or other bad manners. But only go on a little\nlonger, and let them see that you don't care, and send everybody home\na-singing through the lanes as merry as a voting-time for Parliament,\nand the outer ones begins to shake their heads, and to say that they are\nbound to go, and stop the racket of it. And so you get them all, your\nhonor, saints as well as sinners, if you only keeps the tap turned long\nenough.\"\n\n\"Your reasoning is ingenious, Joseph, and shows a deep knowledge of\nhuman nature. But who was this tardy saint that came at last for grog?\"\n\n\"Your honor, he were as big a sinner as ever you clap eyes on. Me and my\nson was among the sawdust, spite of our three crutches, and he spreading\nhands at us, sober as a judge, for lumps of ungenerous iniquity. Mother\nTapsy told us of it, the very next day, for it was not in our power to\nbe ackirate when he done it, and we see everybody laffing at us round\nthe corner. But we took the wind out of his sails the next night,\ncaptain, you may warrant us. Here's to your good health, Sir, afore I\nbeats to win'ard.\"\n\n\"Why, Joseph, you seem to be making up lost way for years of taciturnity\nin the tower. They say there is a balance in all things.\"\n\n\"We had the balance of him next night, and no mistake, your honor.\nHe was one of them 'longshore beggars as turns up here, there, and\neverywhere, galley-raking, like a stinking ray-fish when the tide goes\nout; thundering scoundrels that make a living of it, pushing out for\nroguery with their legs tucked up; no courage for smuggling, nor honest\nenough, they goes on anyhow with their children paid for. We found\nout what he were, and made us more ashamed, for such a sneaking rat to\npreach upon us, like a regular hordinated chaplain, as might say a word\nor two and mean no harm, with the license of the Lord to do it. So my\nson Bob and me called a court-martial in the old tower, so soon as we\ncome round; and we had a red herring, because we was thirsty, and we\nchawed a bit of pigtail to keep it down. At first we was glum; but we\ngot our peckers up, as a family is bound to do when they comes together.\nMy son Bob was a sharp lad in his time, and could read in Holy Scripter\nafore he chewed a quid; and I see'd a good deal of it in his mind now,\nremembering of King Solomon. 'Dad,' he says, 'fetch out that bottle as\nwas left of French white brandy, and rouse up a bit of fire in the old\nport-hole. We ain't got many toes to warm between us'--only five, you\nsee, your worship--'but,' says he, 'we'll warm up the currents where\nthey used to be.'\n\n\"According to what my son said, I done; for he leadeth me now, being\nyounger of the two, and still using half of a shoemaker. However, I says\nto him, 'Warm yourself; it don't lay in my power to do that for you.' He\nnever said nothing; for he taketh after me, in tongue and other likings;\nbut he up with the kettle on the fire, and put in about a fathom and\na half of pigtail. 'So?' says I; and he says, 'So!' and we both of us\nbegan to laugh, as long and as gentle as a pair of cockles, with their\ntongues inside their shells.\n\n\"Well, your honor understands; I never spake so much before since ever\nI pass my coorting-time. We boiled down the pigtail to a pint of tidy\nsoup, and strained it as bright as sturgeon juice; then we got a bottle\nwith 'Navy Supply' on a bull's-eye in the belly of it; and we filled\nit with the French white brandy, and the pigtail soup, and a noggin of\nmolasses, and shook it all up well together; and a better contract-rum,\nyour honor, never come into high admiral's stores.\"\n\n\"But, Joseph, good Joseph,\" cried Mr. Mordacks, \"do forge ahead a little\nfaster. Your private feelings, and the manufacture of them, are highly\ninteresting to you; but I only want to know what came of it.\"\n\n\"Your honor is like a child hearing of a story; you wants the end first,\nand the middle of it after; but I bowls along with a hitch and a squirt,\nfrom habit of fo'castle: and the more you crosses hawse, the wider I\nshall head about, or down helm and bear off, mayhap. I can hear my Bob\na-singing: what a voice he hath! They tell me it cometh from the timber\nof his leg; the same as a old Cremony. He tuned up a many times in\nyonder old barge, and shook the brown water, like a frigate's wake. He\nwould just make our fortin in the Minister, they said, with Black-eyed\nSusan and Tom Bowline.\"\n\n\"Truly, he has a magnificent voice: what power, what compass, what a\nrich clear tone! In spite of the fog I will have the window up.\"\n\nGeoffrey Mordacks loved good singing, the grandest of all melody, and,\nimpatient as he was, he forgot all hurry; while the river, and the\nbuildings, and the arches of the bridge, were ringing, and echoing, and\nsweetly embosoming the mellow delivery of the one-legged tar. And old\nJoe was highly pleased, although he would not show it, at such an effect\nupon a man so hard and dry.\n\n\"Now, your honor, it is overbad of you,\" he continued, with a softening\ngrin, \"to hasten me so, and then to hear me out o' window, because Bob\nhath a sweeter pipe. Ah, he can whistle like a blackbird, too, and gain\na lot of money; but there, what good? He sacrifices it all to the honor\nof his heart, first maggot that cometh into it; and he done the very\nsame with Rickon Goold, the Methody galley-raker. We never was so softy\nwhen I were afloat. But your honor shall hear, and give judgment for\nyourself.\n\n\"Mother Precious was ready in her mind to run out a double-shotted gun\nat Rickon, who liveth down upon the rabbit-warren, to the other side\nof Bempton, because he scarcely ever doth come nigh her; and when he\ndo come, he putteth up both bands, to bless her for hospitality, but\nneither of them into his breeches pocket. And being a lone woman, she\ndoth feel it. Bob and me gave her sailing orders--'twould amaze you,\ncaptain; all was carried out as ship-shape as the battle of the Nile.\nThere was Rickon Goold at anchor, with a spring upon his cable, having\nbeen converted; and he up and hailed that he would slip, at the very\nfirst bad word we used. My son hath such knowledge of good words that\nhe, answered, 'Amen, so be it.'\n\n\"Well, your honor, we goes on decorous, as our old quartermaster used to\ngive the word; and we tried him first with the usual tipple, and several\nother hands dropped in. But my son and me never took a blessed drop,\nexcept from a gin-bottle full of cold water, till we see all the others\nwith their scuppers well awash. Then Bob he findeth fault--Lor' how\nbeautiful he done it!--with the scantling of the stuff; and he shouteth\nout, 'Mother, I'm blest if I won't stand that old guinea bottle of\nbest Jamaica, the one as you put by, with the cobwebs on it, for Lord\nAdmiral. No Lord Admiral won't come now. Just you send away, and hoist\nit up.'\n\n\"Rickon Goold pricked up his ugly ears at this; and Mother Tapsy did it\nbootiful. And to cut a long yarn short, we spliced him, captain, with\nnever a thought of what would come of it; only to have our revenge, your\nhonor. He showed himself that greedy of our patent rum, that he never\nlet the bottle out of his own elbow, and the more he stowed away, the\nmore his derrick chains was creaking; but if anybody reasoned, there he\nstood upon his rights, and defied every way of seeing different, until\nwe was compelled to take and spread him down, in the little room with\nsea-weeds over it.\n\n\"With all this, Bob and me was as sober as two judges, though your honor\nwould hardly believe it, perhaps; but we left him in the dark, to come\nround upon the weeds, as a galley-raker ought to do. And now we began\nto have a little drop ourselves, after towing the prize into port, and\nrecovering the honor of the British navy; and we stood all round to\nevery quarter of the compass, with the bottom of the locker still not\ncome to shallow soundings. But sudden our harmony was spoiled by a\nscream, like a whistle from the very bottom of the sea.\n\n\"We all of us jumped up, as if a gun had broke its lashings; and the\nlast day of judgment was the thoughts of many bodies; but Bob he down at\nonce with his button-stump gun-metal, and takes the command of the whole\nof us. 'Bear a hand, all on you,' he saith, quite steadfast; 'Rickon\nGoold is preaching to his own text to-night.' And so a' was, sure\nenough; so a' was, your honor.\n\n\"We thought he must have died, although he managed to claw off of it,\nwith confessing of his wickedness, and striking to his Maker. All of\nus was frightened so, there was no laugh among us, till we come to talk\nover it afterward. There the thundering rascal lay in the middle of that\nthere mangerie of sea-stuff, as Mother Precious is so proud of, that the\nvillage calleth it the 'Widow's Weeds.' Blest if he didn't think that\nhe were a-lying at the bottom of the sea, among the stars and cuttles,\nwaiting for the day of judgment!\n\n\"'Oh, Captain McNabbins, and Mate Govery,' he cries, 'the hand of the\nLord hath sent me down to keep you company down here. I never would 'a\ndone it, captain, hard as you was on me, if only I had knowed how dark\nand cold and shivery it would be down here. I cut the plank out; I'll\nnot lie; no lies is any good down here, with the fingers of the deep\nthings pointing to me, and the black devil's wings coming over me--but\na score of years agone it were, and never no one dreamed of it--oh, pull\naway, pull! for God's sake, pull!--the wet woman and the three innocent\nbabbies crawling over me like congers!'\n\n\"This was the shadows of our legs, your honor, from good Mother Tapsy's\ncandle; for she was in a dreadful way by this time about her reputation\nand her weeds, and come down with her tongue upon the lot of us. 'Enter\nall them names upon the log,' says I to Bob, for he writeth like a\nscholar. But Bob says, 'Hold hard, dad; now or never.' And with that,\ndown he goeth on the deck himself, and wriggleth up to Rickon through\nthe weeds, with a hiss like a great sea-snake, and grippeth him. 'Name\nof ship, you sinner!' cried Bob, in his deep voice, like Old Nick\na-hailing from a sepulchre. 'Golconda, of Calcutta,' says the fellow,\nwith a groan as seemed to come out of the whites of his eyes; and down\ngoes his head again, enough to split a cat-head. And that was the last\nof him we heard that night.\n\n\"Well, now, captain, you scarcely would believe, but although my nob is\nso much older of the pair, and white where his is as black as any coal,\nBob's it was as first throwed the painter up, for a-hitching of this\ndrifty to the starn of your consarns. And it never come across him till\nthe locker was run out, and the two of us pulling longer faces than\nour legs is. Then Bob, by the mercy of the Lord, like Peter, found them\nguineas in the corner of his swab--some puts it round their necks, and\nsome into their pockets; I never heard of such a thing till chaps run\nsoft and watery--and so we come to this here place to change the air\nand the breeding, and spin this yarn to your honor's honor, as hath a\nliberal twist in it; and then to take orders, and draw rations, and any\n'rears of pay fallen due, after all dibs gone in your service; and for\nBob to tip a stave in the Minister.\"\n\n\"You have done wisely and well in coming here,\" said Mr, Mordacks,\ncheerfully; \"but we must have further particulars, my friend. You seem\nto have hit upon the clew I wanted, but it must be followed very\ncautiously. You know where to lay your hand upon this villain? You have\nhad the sense not to scare him off?\"\n\n\"Sarten, your honor. I could clap the irons on him any hour you gives\nthat signal.\"\n\n\"Capital! Take your son to see the sights, and both of you come to me at\nten to-morrow morning. Stop: you may as well take this half guinea. But\nwhen you get drunk, drink inwards.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nMEN OF SOLID TIMBER\n\n\nMr. Mordacks was one of those vivacious men who have strong faith in\ntheir good luck, and yet attribute to their merits whatever turns out\nwell. In the present matter he had done as yet nothing at all ingenious,\nor even to be called sagacious. The discovery of \"Monument Joe,\" or\n\"Peg-leg Joe,\" as he was called at Flamborough, was not the result of\nany skill whatever, either his own or the factor's, but a piece of as\npure luck as could be. For all that, however, Mr. Mordacks intended to\nhave the whole credit as his sole and righteous due.\n\n\"Whenever I am at all down-hearted, samples of my skill turn up,\" he\nsaid to himself as soon as Joe was gone; \"and happy results come home,\non purpose to rebuke my diffidence. Would any other man have got so far\nas I have got by simple, straightforward, yet truly skillful action,\nwithout a suspicion being started? Old Jellicorse lies on his bed of\nroses, snoring folios of long words, without a dream of the gathering\ncloud. Those insolent ladies are revelling in the land from which they\nhave ousted their only brother; they are granting leases not worth a\nstraw; they are riding the high horse; they are bringing up that cub\n(who set the big dog at me) in every wanton luxury. But wait a bit--wait\na bit, my ladies; as sure as I live I shall have you.\n\n\"In the first place, it is clear that my conclusion was correct\nconcerning that poor Golconda; and why not also in the other issue? The\nIndiaman was scuttled--I had never thought of that, but only of a wreck.\nIt comes to the same thing, only she went down more quietly; and that\nexplains a lot of things. She was bound for Leith, with the boy to be\ndelivered into the hands of his Scotch relatives. She was spoken last\noff Yarmouth Roads, all well, and under easy sail. Very good so far.\nI have solved her fate, which for twenty years has been a mystery. We\nshall have all particulars in proper time, by steering on one side of\nthe law, which always huddles up everything. A keen eye must be kept\nupon that scoundrel, but he must never dream that he is watched at all;\nhe has committed a capital offense. But as yet there is nothing but\nhis own raving to convict him of barratry. The truth must be got at by\ngentle means. I must not claim the 500 pounds as yet, but I am sure of\ngetting it. And I have excellent hopes of the 5000 pounds.\"\n\nGeoffrey Mordacks never took three nights to sleep upon his thoughts (as\nthe lawyer of Middleton loved to do), but rather was apt to overdrive\nhis purport, with the goad of hasty action. But now he was quite\nresolved to be most careful; for the high hand would never do in such a\nticklish matter, and the fewer the hands introduced at all into it, the\nbetter the chance of coming out clear and clean. The general factor had\nnever done anything which, in his opinion, was not thoroughly upright;\nand now, with his reputation made, and his conscience stiffened to the\nshape of it, even a large sum of money must be clean, and cleanly got\nat, to make it pay for handling.\n\nThis made him counsel with himself just now. For he was a superior man\nupon the whole, and particular always in feeling sure that the right\nword in anything would be upon his side. Not that he cared a groat for\nanybody's gossip; only that he kept a lofty tenor of good opinion. And\nsailors who made other sailors tipsy, and went rolling about on the\nfloor all together, whether with natural legs or artificial, would do no\ncredit to his stairs of office on a fine market-day in the morning. On\nthe other hand, while memory held sway, no instance could be cited of\ntwo jolly sailors coming to see the wonders of this venerable town,\nand failing to be wholly intoxicated with them, before the Minster bell\nstruck one.\n\nThis was to be avoided, or rather forestalled, as a thing inevitable\nshould be. Even in York city, teeming as it is with most delightful\nqueerities, the approach of two sailors with three wooden legs might\nbe anticipated at a distant offing, so abundant are boys there, and\neverywhere. Therefore it was well provided, on the part of Master\nMordacks, that Kitty, or Koity, the maid-of-all-work, a damsel of\nmuscular power and hard wit, should hold tryst with these mariners in\nthe time of early bucket, and appoint a little meeting with her master\nby-and-by. This she did cleverly, and they were not put out; because\nthey were to dine at his expense at a snug little chop-house in\nParliament Street, and there to remain until he came to pay the score.\n\nAll this happened to the utmost of desires; and before they had time\nto get thick-witted, Mordacks stood before them. His sharp eyes took in\nSailor Bob before the poor fellow looked twice at him, and the general\nfactor saw that he might be trusted not to think much for himself. This\nwas quite as Mr. Mordacks hoped; he wanted a man who could hold his\ntongue, and do what he was told to do.\n\nAfter a few words about their dinner, and how they got on, and so forth,\nthe principal came to the point by saying: \"Now both of you must start\nto-morrow morning; such clever fellows can not be spared to go to sleep.\nYou shall come and see York again, with free billet, and lashings of\nmoney in your pockets, as soon as you have carried out your sailing\norders. To-night you may jollify; but after that you are under strict\ndiscipline, for a month at least. What do you say to that, my men?\"\n\nWatchman Joe looked rather glum; he had hoped for a fortnight of\nstumping about, with a tail of admiring boys after him, and of hailing\nevery public-house the cut of whose jib was inviting; however, he put\nhis knife into his mouth, with a bit of fat, saved for a soft adieu to\ndinner, and nodded for his son to launch true wisdom into the vasty deep\nof words.\n\nNow Bob, the son of Joe, had striven to keep himself up to the paternal\nmark. He cited his father as the miracle of the age, when he was a long\nway off; and when he was nigh at hand, he showed his sense of duty,\nnearly always, by letting him get tipsy first. Still, they were very\nsober fellows in the main, and most respectable, when they had no money.\n\n\"Sir,\" began Bob, after jerking up his chin, as a sailor always does\nwhen he begins to think (perhaps for hereditary counsel with the sky),\n\"my father and I have been hauling of it over, to do whatever is laid\ndown by duty, without going any way again' ourselves. And this is the\nsense we be come to, that we should like to have something handsome\ndown, to lay by again' chances; also a dokkyment in black and white, to\nbear us harmless of the law, and enter the prize-money.\"\n\n\"What a fine councillor a' would have made!\" old Joe exclaimed, with\necstasy. \"He hath been round the world three times--excuseth of him for\nonly one leg left.\"\n\n\"My friend, how you condemn yourself! You have not been round the world\nat all, and yet you have no leg at all.\" So spake Mr. Mordacks, wishing\nto confuse ideas; for the speech of Bob misliked him.\n\n\"The corners of the body is the Lord's good-will,\" old Joe answered,\nwith his feelings hurt; \"He calleth home a piece to let the rest bide\non, and giveth longer time to it--so saith King David.\"\n\n\"It may be so; but I forget the passage. Now what has your son Bob to\nsay?\"\n\nBob was a sailor of the fine old British type, still to be found even\nnowadays, and fit to survive forever. Broad and resolute of aspect, set\nwith prejudice as stiff as his own pigtail, truthful when let alone,\nyet joyful in a lie, if anybody doubted him, peaceable in little things\nthrough plenty of fight in great ones, gentle with women and children,\nand generous with mankind in general, expecting to be cheated, yet not\nduly resigned at being so, and subject to unaccountable extremes of\nlaziness and diligence. His simple mind was now confused by the general\nfactor's appeal to him to pronounce his opinion, when he had just now\npronounced it, after great exertion.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I leave such things to father's opinion; he hath been\nashore some years; and I almost forget how the land lays.\"\n\n\"Sea-faring Robert, you are well advised. A man may go round the world\ntill he has no limbs left, yet never overtake his father. So the matter\nis left to my decision. Very good; you shall have no reason to repent\nit. To-night you have liberty to splice the main-brace, or whatever\nyour expression is for getting jolly drunk; in the morning you will be\nsobriety itself, sad, and wise, and aching. But hear my proposal, before\nyou take a gloomy view of things, such as to-morrow's shades may\nbring. You have been of service to me, and I have paid you with great\ngenerosity; but what I have done, including dinner, is dust in the\nbalance to what I shall do, provided only that you act with judgment,\ndiscipline, and self-denial, never being tipsy more than once a week,\nwhich is fair naval average, and doing it then with only one another.\nHard it may be; but it must be so. Now before I go any further, let me\nask whether you, Joseph, as a watchman under government, have lost your\nposition by having left it for two months upon a private spree?\"\n\n\"Lor', no, your honor! Sure you must know more than that. I gived a old\n'ooman elevenpence a week, and a pot of beer a Sunday, to carry out the\ndooties of the government.\"\n\n\"You farmed out your appointment at a low figure. My opinion of your\npowers and discretion is enhanced; you will return to your post with\nredoubled ardor, and vigor renewed by recreation; you will be twice the\nman you were, and certainly ought to get double pay. I have interest; I\nmay be enabled to double your salary--if you go on well.\"\n\nThis made both of them look exceeding downcast, and chew the bitter quid\nof disappointment. They had laid their heads together over glass number\none, and resolved upon asking for a guinea a week; over glass number\ntwo, they had made up their minds upon getting two guineas weekly; and\nglass number three had convinced them that they must be poor fools to\naccept less than three. Also they felt that the guineas they had spent,\nin drinking their way up to a great discovery, should without hesitation\nbe made good ere ever they had another pint of health. In this\ncatastrophe of large ideas, the father gazed sadly at the son, and the\nson reproachfully reflected the paternal gaze. How little availed it to\nhave come up here, wearily going on upon yellow waters, in a barge where\nthe fleas could man the helm, without aid of the stouter insect, and\nwhere a fresh run sailor was in more demand than salmon; and even\nwithout that (which had largely enhanced the inestimable benefit of\nhaving wooden legs), this pair of tars had got into a state of mind to\nreturn the whole way upon horseback. No spurs could they wear, and no\nstirrups could they want, and to get up would be difficult; but what is\nthe use of living, except to conquer difficulties? They rejoiced all the\nmore in the four legs of a horse, by reason of the paucity of their\nown; which approves a liberal mind. But now, where was the horse to come\nfrom, or the money to make him go?\n\n\"You look sad,\" proceeded Mr. Mordacks. \"It grieves me when any good\nman looks sad; and doubly so when a brace of them do it. Explain your\nfeelings, Joe and Bob; if it lies in a human being to relieve them, I\nwill do it.\"\n\n\"Captain, we only wants what is our due,\" said Bob, with his chin up,\nand his strong eyes stern. \"We have been on the loose; and it is the\nmanner of us, and encouraged by the high authorities. We have come\nacross, by luck of drink, a thing as seems to suit you; and we have told\nyou all our knowledge without no conditions. If you takes us for a pair\nof fools, and want no more of us, you are welcome, and it will be what\nwe are used to; but if your meaning is to use us, we must have fair\nwages; and even so, we would have naught to do with it if it was against\nan honest man; but a rogue who has scuttled a ship--Lor', there!\"\n\nBob cast out the juice of his chew into the fire, as if it were the\nlife-blood of such a villain, and looked at his father, who expressed\napproval by the like proceeding. And Geoffrey Mordacks was well content\nat finding them made of decent stuff. It was not his manner to do things\nmeanly; and he had only spoken so to moderate their minds and keep them\nsteady.\n\n\"Mariner Bob, you speak well and wisely,\" he answered, with a superior\nsmile. \"Your anxiety as to ways and means does credit to your intellect.\nThat subject has received my consideration. I have studied the style of\nlife at Flamborough, and the prices of provisions--would that such they\nwere in York!--and to keep you in temperate and healthy comfort, without\ntemptation, and with minds alert, I am determined to allow for the two\nof you, over and above all your present income from a grateful country\n(which pays a man less when amputation has left less of him), the sum of\none guinea and a half per week. But remember that, to draw this stipend,\nboth of you must be in condition to walk one mile and a half on a\nSaturday night, which is a test of character. You will both be fitted\nup with solid steel ends, by the cutler at the end of Ouse Bridge,\nto-morrow morning, so that the state of the roads will not affect you,\nand take note of one thing, mutual support (graceful though it always\nis in paternal and filial communion) will not be allowed on a Saturday\nnight. Each man must stand on his own stumps.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Bob, who had much education, which led him to a knowledge\nof his failings, \"never you fear but what we shall do it. Sunday will\nbe the day of standing with a shake to it; for such, is the habit of the\nnavy. Father, return thanks; make a leg--no man can do it better. Master\nMordacks, you shall have our utmost duty; but a little brass in hand\nwould be convenient.\"\n\n\"You shall have a fortnight in advance; after that you must go every\nSaturday night to a place I will appoint for you. Now keep your own\ncounsel; watch that fellow; by no means scare him at first, unless you\nsee signs of his making off; but rather let him think that you know\nnothing of his crime. Labor hard to make him drink again; then terrify\nhim like Davy Jones himself; and get every particular out of him,\nespecially how he himself escaped, where he landed, and who was with\nhim. I want to learn all about a little boy (at least, he may be a\nbig man now), who was on board the ship Golconda, under the captain's\nspecial charge. I can not help thinking that the child escaped; and I\ngot a little trace of something connected with him at Flamborough. I\ndurst not make much inquiry there, because I am ordered to keep things\nquiet. Still, I did enough to convince me almost that my suspicion was\nan error; for Widow Precious--\"\n\n\"Pay you no heed, Sir, to any manoeuvring of Widow Precious. We find her\nno worse than the other women; but not a blamed bit better.\"\n\n\"I think highly of the female race; at least, in comparison with the\nmale one. I have always found reason to believe that a woman, put upon\nher mettle by a secret, will find it out, or perish.\"\n\n\"Your honor, everybody knows as much as that; but it doth not follow\nthat she tells it on again, without she was ordered not to do so.\"\n\n\"Bob, you have not been round the world for nothing. I see my blot, and\nyou have hit it; you deserve to know all about the matter now. Match me\nthat button, and you shall have ten guineas.\"\n\nThe two sailors stared at the bead of Indian gold which Mordacks pulled\nout of his pocket. Buttons are a subject for nautical contempt and\ncondemnation; perhaps because there is nobody to sew them on at sea;\nwhile ear-rings, being altogether useless, are held in good esteem and\nhonor.\n\n\"I have seen a brace of ear-rings like it,\" said old Joe, wading through\ndeep thought. \"Bob, you knows who was a-wearing of 'em.\"\n\n\"A score of them fishermen, like enough,\" cautious Bob answered; for\nhe knew what his father meant, but would not speak of the great\nfree-trader; for Master Mordacks might even be connected with the\nrevenue. \"What use to go on about such gear? His honor wanteth to hear\nof buttons, regulation buttons by the look of it, and good enough for\nLord Nelson. Will you let us take the scantle, and the rig of it, your\nhonor?\"\n\n\"By all means, if you can do so, my friend; but what have you to do it\nwith?\"\n\n\"Hold on a bit, Sir, and you shall see.\" With these words Bob clapped\na piece of soft York bread into the hollow of his broad brown palm,\nmoistened it with sugary dregs of ale, such as that good city loves, and\nkneading it firmly with some rapid flits of thumb, tempered and\nenriched it nobly with the mellow juice of quid. Treated thus, it took\nconsistence, plastic, docile, and retentive pulp; and the color was\nsomething like that of gold which had passed, according to its fate,\nthrough a large number of unclean hands.\n\n\"Now the pattern, your honor,\" said Bob, with a grin; \"I could do it\nfrom memory, but better from the thing.\" He took the bauble, and set it\non the foot of a rummer which stood on the table; and in half a minute\nhe had the counterpart in size, shape, and line; but without the\ninscription. \"A sample of them in the hollow will do, and good enough\nfor the nigger-body words--heathen writing, to my mind.\" With lofty\nBritish intolerance, he felt that it might be a sinful thing to make\nsuch marks; nevertheless he impressed one side, whereon the characters\nwere boldest, into the corresponding groove of his paste model; then he\nscooped up the model on the broad blade of his knife, and set it in the\noven of the little fire-place, in a part where the heat was moderate.\n\n\"Well done, indeed!\" cried Mr. Mordacks; \"you will have a better\nlikeness of it than good Mother Precious. Robert, I admire your\ningenuity. But all sailors are ingenious.\"\n\n\"At sea, in the trades, or in a calm, Sir, what have we to do but to\ntwiddle our thumbs, and practice fiddling with them? A lively tune is\nwhat I like, and a-serving of the guns red-hot; a man must act according\nto what nature puts upon him. And nature hath taken one of my legs from\nme with a cannon-shot from the French line-of-battle ship--Rights of\nMankind the name of her.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE PROPER WAY TO ARGUE\n\n\nAlas, how seldom is anything done in proper time and season! Either too\nfast, or too slow, is the clock of all human dealings; and what is the\nlaw of them, when the sun (the regulator of works and ways) has to be\nallowed for very often on his own meridian? With the best intention\nevery man sets forth to do his duty, and to talk of it; and he makes\nquite sure that he has done it, and to his privy circle boasts, or lets\nthem do it better for him; but before his lips are dry, his ears apprise\nhim that he was a stroke too late.\n\nSo happened it with Master Mordacks, who of all born men was foremost,\nwith his wiry fingers spread, to pass them through the scattery forelock\nof that mettlesome horse, old Time. The old horse galloped by him\nunawares, and left him standing still, to hearken the swish of the tail,\nand the clatter of the hoofs, and the spirited nostrils neighing for\na race, on the wide breezy down at the end of the lane. But Geoffrey\nMordacks was not to blame. His instructions were to move slowly, until\nhe was sure of something worth moving for. And of this he had no surety\nyet, and was only too likely to lose it altogether by any headlong\naction. Therefore, instead of making any instant rush, or belting on\nhis pistols, and hiring the sagacious quadruped that understood his\ncharacter, content he was to advance deliberately upon one foot and\nthree artificial legs.\n\nMeanwhile, at Anerley Farm, the usual fatness of full garners, and\nbright comfort of the evening hearth, the glow of peace, which labor\nkindles in the mind that has earned its rest, and the pleasant laziness\nof heart which comes where family love lies careless, confident, and\nunassailed--the pleasure also of pitying the people who never can get in\ntheir wheat, and the hot benevolence of boiling down the bones for the\nman who has tumbled off one's own rick--all these blisses, large and\nlittle, were not in their usual prime.\n\nThe master of the house was stern and silent, heavy and careless of his\ncustomary victuals, neglectful also of his customary jokes. He disliked\nthe worse side of a bargain as much as in his most happy moments; and\nthe meditation (which is generally supposed to be going on where speech\nis scarce) was not of such loftiness as to overlook the time a man\nstopped round the corner. As a horse settles down to strong collar-work\nbetter when the gloss of the stable takes the ruffle of the air, so this\nman worked at his business all the harder, with the brightness of the\nhome joys fading. But it went very hard with him more than once, when\nhe made a good stroke of salesmanship, to have to put the money in the\nbottom of his pocket, without even rubbing a bright half crown, and\nsaying to himself, \"I have a'most a mind to give this to Mary.\"\n\nNow if this settled and steadfast man (with three-quarters of his life\ngone over him, and less and less time every year for considering soft\nsubjects), in spite of all that, was put out of his way by not being\nlooked at as usual--though for that matter, perhaps, himself failed to\nlook in search of those looks as usual--what, on the other hand, was\nlikely to remain of mirth and light-heartedness in a weaker quarter?\nMary, who used to be as happy as a bird where worms abound and cats are\nscarce, was now in a grievous plight of mind, restless, lonely, troubled\nin her heart, and doubtful of her conscience. Her mother had certainly\nshown kind feeling, and even a readiness to take her part, which\nsurprised the maiden, after all her words; and once or twice they\nhad had a cry together, clearing and strengthening their intellects\ndesirably. For the more Mistress Anerley began to think about it, the\nmore she was almost sure that something could be said on both sides. She\nnever had altogether approved of the farmer's volunteering, which took\nhim away to drill at places where ladies came to look at him; and where\nhe slept out of his own bed, and got things to eat that she had never\nheard of; and he never was the better afterward. If that was the thing\nwhich set his mind against free trade so bitterly, it went far to show\nthat free trade was good, and it made all the difference of a blanket.\nAnd more than that, she had always said from the very first, and had\neven told the same thing to Captain Carroway, in spite of his position,\nthat nobody knew what Robin Lyth might not turn out in the end to be.\nHe had spoken most highly of her, as Mary had not feared to mention; and\nshe felt obliged to him for doing so, though of course he could not do\notherwise. Still, there were people who would not have done that, and it\nproved that he was a very promising young man.\n\nMary was pleased with this conclusion, and glad to have some one who did\nnot condemn her; hopeful, moreover, that her mother's influence might\nhave some effect by-and-by. But for the present it seemed to do more\nharm than good; because the farmer, having quite as much jealousy as\njustice, took it into silent dudgeon that the mother of his daughter,\nwho regularly used to be hard upon her for next to nothing, should now\nturn round and take her part, from downright womanism, in the teeth of\nall reason, and of her own husband! Brave as he was, he did not put it\nto his wife in so strong a way as that; but he argued it so to himself,\nand would let it fly forth, without thinking twice about it, if they\nwent on in that style much longer, quite as if he were nobody, and\nthey could do better without him. Little he knew, in this hurt state of\nmind--for which he should really have been too old--how the heart of\nhis child was slow and chill, stupid with the strangeness he had made,\nwaiting for him to take the lead, or open some door for entrance,\nand watching for the humors of the elder body, as the young of past\ngenerations did. And sometimes, faithful as she was to plighted truth\nand tenderness, one coaxing word would have brought her home to the arms\nthat used to carry her.\n\nBut while such things were waiting to be done till they were thought of,\nthe time for doing them went by; and to think of them was memory. Master\nPopplewell had told Captain Anerley continually what his opinions were,\nfairly giving him to know on each occasion that they were to be taken\nfor what they were worth; that it did not follow, from his own success\nin life, that he might not be mistaken now; and that he did not care a\nd--n, except for Christian feeling, whether any fool hearkened to him\ntwice or not. He said that he never had been far out in any opinion he\nhad formed in all his life; but none the more for that would he venture\nto foretell a thing with cross-purposes about it. A man of sagacity and\ndealings with the world might happen to be right ninety-nine times in\na hundred, and yet he might be wrong the other time. Therefore he would\nnot give any opinion, except that everybody would be sorry by-and-by,\nwhen things were too late for mending.\n\nTo this the farmer listened with an air of wisdom, not put forward too\nseverely; because Brother Popplewell had got a lot of money, and must\nbehave handsomely when in a better world. The simplest way of treating\nhim was just to let him talk--for it pleased him, and could do no\nharm--and then to recover self-content by saying what a fool he was when\nout of hearing. The tanner partly suspected this; and it put his nature\nupon edge; for he always drove his opinions in as if they were so many\ntenpenny nails, which the other man must either clinch or strike back\ninto his teeth outright. He would rather have that than flabby silence,\nas if he were nailing into dry-rot.\n\n\"I tell you what it is,\" he said, the third time he came over, which was\nwell within a week--for nothing breeds impatience faster than retirement\nfrom work--\"you are so thick-headed in your farmhouse ways, sometimes\nI am worn out with you. I do not expect to be thought of any higher\nbecause I have left off working for myself; and Deborah is satisfied to\nbe called 'Debby,' and walks no prouder than if she had got to clean\nher own steps daily. You can not enter into what people think of me,\ncounting Parson Beloe; and therefore it is no good saying anything about\nit. But, Stephen, you may rely upon it that you will be sorry afterward.\nThat poor girl, the prettiest girl in Yorkshire, and the kindest, and\nthe best, is going off her victuals, and consuming of her substance,\nbecause you will not even look at her. If you don't want the child, let\nme have her. To us she is welcome as the flowers in May.\"\n\n\"If Mary wishes it, she can go with you,\" the farmer answered, sternly;\nand hating many words, he betook himself to work, resolving to keep at\nit until the tanner should be gone. But when he came home after dusk,\nhis steadfast heart was beating faster than his stubborn mind approved.\nMary might have taken him at his word, and flown for refuge from\ndispleasure, cold voice, and dull comfort, to the warmth, and hearty\ncheer, and love of the folk who only cared to please her, spoil her,\nand utterly ruin her. Folk who had no sense of fatherly duty, or right\nconscience; but, having piled up dirty money, thought that it covered\neverything: such people might think it fair to come between a father\nand his child, and truckle to her, by backing her up in whims that were\nagainst her good, and making light of right and wrong, as if they turned\non money; but Mary (such a prudent lass, although she was a fool just\nnow) must see through all such shallow tricks, such rigmarole about\nParson Beloe, who must be an idiot himself to think so much of Simon\nPopplewell--for Easter offerings, no doubt--but there, if Mary had the\nheart to go away, what use to stand maundering about it? Stephen Anerley\nwould be dashed if he cared which way it was.\n\nMeaning all this, Stephen Anerley, however, carried it out in a style at\nvariance with such reckless vigor. Instead of marching boldly in at his\nown door, and throwing himself upon a bench, and waiting to be waited\nupon, he left the narrow gravel-walk (which led from the horse gate to\nthe front door) and craftily fetched a compass through the pleasure beds\nand little shrubs, upon the sward, and in the dusk, so that none might\nsee or hear him. Then, priding himself upon his stealth, as a man with\nwhom it is rare may do, yet knowing all the time that he was more than\nhalf ashamed of it, he began to peep in at his own windows, as if he\nwere planning how to rob his own house. This thought struck him, but\ninstead of smiling, he sighed very sadly; for his object was to learn\nwhether house and home had been robbed of that which he loved so fondly.\nThere was no Mary in the kitchen, seeing to his supper; the fire was\nbright, and the pot was there, but only shadows round it. No Mary in the\nlittle parlor; only Willie half asleep, with a stupid book upon his lap,\nand a wretched candle guttering. Then, as a last hope, he peered into\nthe dairy, where she often went at fall of night, to see things safe,\nand sang to keep the ghosts away. She would not be singing now of\ncourse, because he was so cross with her; but if she were there, it\nwould be better than the merriest song for him. But no, the place was\ndark and cold; tub and pan, and wooden skimmer, and the pails hung up\nto drain, all were left to themselves, and the depth of want of life was\nover them. \"She hathn't been there for an hour,\" thought he; \"a reek o'\nmilk, and not my lassie.\"\n\nVery few human beings have such fragrance of good-will as milk. The\nfarmer knew that he had gone too far in speaking coarsely of the cow,\nwhose children first forego their food for the benefit of ours, and then\nbecome veal to please us. \"My little maid is gone,\" said the lord of\nmany cows, and who had robbed some thousand of their dear calves. \"I\ntrow I must make up my mind to see my little maid no more.\"\n\nWithout compunction for any mortal cow (though one was bellowing sadly\nin the distance, that had lost her calf that day), and without even\ndreaming of a grievance there, Master Anerley sat down to think upon a\nlittle bench hard by. His thoughts were not very deep or subtle; yet to\nhim they were difficult, because they were so new and sad. He had always\nhoped to go through life in the happiest way there is of it, with simply\ndoing common work, and heeding daily business, and letting other people\nthink the higher class of thought for him. To live as Nature, cultivated\nquite enough for her own content, enjoys the round of months and years,\nthe changes of the earth and sky, and gentle slope of time subsiding to\nsofter shadows and milder tones. And, most of all, to see his children,\ndutiful, good, and loving, able and ready to take his place--when he\nshould be carried from farm to church--to work the land he loved so\nwell, and to walk in his ways, and praise him.\n\nBut now he thought, like Job in his sorrow, \"All these things are\nagainst me.\" The air was laden with the scents of autumn, rich and ripe\nand soothing--the sweet fulfillment of the year. The mellow odor of\nstacked wheat, the stronger perfume of clover, the brisk smell of apples\nnewly gathered, the distant hint of onions roped, and the luscious waft\nof honey, spread and hung upon the evening breeze. \"What is the good of\nall this,\" he muttered, \"when my little lassie is gone away, as if she\nhad no father?\"\n\n\"Father, I am not gone away. Oh, father, I never will go away, if you\nwill love me as you did.\"\n\nHere Mary stopped; for the short breath of a sob was threatening to\ncatch her words; and her nature was too like her father's to let him\ntriumph over her. The sense of wrong was in her heart, as firm and\ndeep as in his own, and her love of justice quite as strong; only they\ndiffered as to what it was. Therefore Mary would not sob until she was\ninvited. She stood in the arch of trimmed yew-tree, almost within reach\nof his arms; and though it was dark, he knew her face as if the sun was\non it.\n\n\"Dearie, sit down here,\" he said; \"there used to be room for you and me,\nwithout two chairs, when you was my child.\"\n\n\"Father, I am still your child,\" she answered, softly, sitting by him.\n\"Were you looking for me just now? Say it was me you were looking for.\"\n\n\"There is such a lot of rogues to look for; they skulk about so, and\nthey fire the stacks--\"\n\n\"Now, father, you never could tell a fib,\" she answered, sidling closer\nup, and preparing for his repentance.\n\n\"I say that I was looking for a rogue. If the cap fits--\" here he\nsmiled a little, as much as to say, \"I had you there;\" and then, without\nmeaning it, from simple force of habit, he did a thing equal to utter\nsurrender. He stroked his chin, as he always used to do when going to\nkiss Mary, that the bristles might lie down for her.\n\n\"The cap doesn't fit; nothing fits but you; you--you--you, my own dear\nfather,\" she cried, as she kissed him again and again, and put her arms\nround to protect him. \"And nobody fits you, but your own Mary. I knew\nyou were sorry. You needn't say it. You are too stubborn, and I will let\nyou off. Now don't say a word, father, I can do without it. I don't want\nto humble you, but only to make you good; and you are the very best of\nall people, when you please. And you never must be cross again with your\ndarling Mary. Promise me immediately; or you shall have no supper.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the farmer, \"I used to think that I was gifted with the\ngift of argument. Not like a woman, perhaps; but still pretty well for\na man, as can't spare time for speechifying, and hath to earn bread for\nself and young 'uns.\"\n\n\"Father, it is that arguing spirit that has done you so much harm. You\nmust take things as Heaven sends them; and not go arguing about them.\nFor instance, Heaven has sent you me.\"\n\n\"So a' might,\" Master Anerley replied; \"but without a voice from the\nbelly of a fish, I wunna' believe that He sent Bob Lyth.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nFAREWELL, WIFE AND CHILDREN DEAR\n\n\nNow Robin Lyth held himself in good esteem; as every honest man is bound\nto do, or surely the rogues will devour him. Modesty kept him silent as\nto his merits very often; but the exercise of self-examination made\nthem manifest to himself. As the Yorkshireman said to his minister, when\npressed to make daily introspection, \"I dare na do it, sir; it sets\nme up so, and leaveth no chance for my neighbors;\" so the great\nfree-trader, in charity for others, forbore to examine himself too much.\nBut without doing that, he was conscious of being as good as Master\nAnerley; and intended, with equal mind and manner, to state his claim to\nthe daughter's hand.\n\nIt was not, therefore, as the farmer thought, any deep sense of\nillegality which kept him from coming forward now, as a gallant sailor\nalways does; but rather the pressure of sterner business, and the hard\nnecessity of running goods, according to honorable contract. After\nhis narrow escape from outrage upon personal privilege--for the habeas\ncorpus of the Constitution should at least protect a man while making\nlove--it was clear that the field of his duties as a citizen was\npadlocked against him, until next time. Accordingly he sought the\nwider bosom of the ever-liberal sea; and leaving the noble Carroway\nto mourn--or in stricter truth, alas! to swear--away he sailed, at the\nquartering of the moon, for the land of the genial Dutchman.\n\nNow this was the time when the forces of the realm were mightily\ngathered together against him. Hitherto there had been much fine feeling\non the part of his Majesty's revenue, and a delicate sense of etiquette.\nAll the commanders of the cutters on the coast, of whom and of which\nthere now were three, had met at Carroway's festive board; and, looking\nat his family, had one and all agreed to let him have the first chance\nof the good prize-money. It was All-saints' Day of the year gone by when\nthey met and thus enjoyed themselves; and they bade their host appoint\nhis time; and he said he should not want three months. At this they\nlaughed, and gave him twelve; and now the twelve had slipped away.\n\n\"I would much rather never have him caught at all,\" said Carroway, to\nhis wife, when his year of precaption had expired, \"than for any of\nthose fellows to nab him; especially that prig last sent down.\"\n\n\"So would I, dear; so would I, of course,\" replied Mrs. Carroway, who\nhad been all gratitude for their noble self-denial when they made the\npromise; \"what airs they would give themselves! And what could they do\nwith the money? Drink it out! I am sure that the condition of our best\ntumblers, after they come, is something. People who don't know anything\nabout it always fancy that glass will clean. Glass won't clean, after\nsuch men as those; and as for the table--don't talk of it.\"\n\n\"Two out of the three are gone\"--the lieutenant's conscience was not\nvoid of offense concerning tables--\"gone upon promotion. Everybody gets\npromotion, if he only does his very best never to deserve it. They ought\nto have caught Lyth long and long ago. What are such dummies fit for?\"\n\n\"But, Charles, you know that they would have acted meanly and\ndishonestly if they had done so. They promised not to catch him; and\nthey carried out their promise.\"\n\n\"Matilda, such questions are beyond you altogether. You can not be\nexpected to understand the service. One of those trumpery, half-decked\ncraft--or they used to be half-deckers in my time--has had three of\nthose fresh-meat Jemmies over her in a single twelvemonth. But of course\nthey were all bound by the bargain they had made. As for that, small\nthanks to them. How could they catch him, when I couldn't? They chop and\nthey change so, I forget their names; my head is not so good as it was,\nwith getting so much moonlight.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Charles; you know them like your fingers. But I know what you\nwant; you want Geraldine, you are so proud to hear her tell it.\"\n\n\"Tilly, you are worse. You love to hear her say it. Well, call her in,\nand let her do it. She is making an oyster-shell cradle over there, with\ntwo of the blessed babies.\"\n\n\"Charles, how very profane you are! All babes are blest by the Lord, in\nan independent parable, whether they can walk, or crawl, or put up their\nfeet and take nourishment. Jerry, you come in this very moment. What\nare you doing with your two brothers there, and a dead skate--bless the\nchildren! Now say the cutters and their captains.\"\n\nGeraldine, who was a pretty little girl, as well as a good and clever\none, swept her wind-tossed hair aside, and began to repeat her lesson;\nfor which she sometimes got a penny when her father had made a good\ndinner.\n\n\"His Majesty's cutter Swordfish, Commander Nettlebones, senior officer\nof the eastern division after my papa, although a very young man still,\ncarries a swivel-gun and two bow-chasers. His Majesty's cutter Kestrel,\ncommanded by Lieutenant Bowler, is armed with three long-John's, or\nstrap-guns, capable of carrying a pound of shrapnel. His Majesty's\ncutter Albatross, Lieutenant Corkoran Donovan, carries no artillery\nyet--\"\n\n\"Not artillery--guns, child; your mother calls them 'artillery.'\"\n\n\"Carries no guns yet, because she was captured from the foreign enemy;\nand as yet she has not been reported stanch, since the British fire\nmade a hole in her. It is, however, expected that those asses at the\ndock-yard---\"\n\n\"Geraldine, how often must I tell you that you are not to use that word?\nIt is your father's expression.\"\n\n\"It is, however, expected that those donkeys at the dock-yard will\nrecommend her to be fitted with two brass howisyers.\"\n\n\"Howitzers, my darling. Spell that word, and you shall have your penny.\nNow you may run out and play again. Give your old father a pretty kiss\nfor it. I often wish,\" continued the lieutenant, as his daughter flew\nback to the dead skate and the babies, \"that I had only got that\nchild's clear head. Sometimes the worry is too much for me. And now if\nNettlebones catches Robin Lyth, to a certainty I shall be superseded,\nand all of us go to the workhouse. Oh, Tilly, why won't your old aunt\ndie? We might be so happy afterward.\"\n\n\"Charles, it is not only sinful, but wicked, to show any wish to hurry\nher. The Lord knows best what is good for us; and our prayers upon such\nmatters should be silent.\"\n\n\"Well, mine would be silent and loud too, according to the best chance\nof being heard. Not that I would harm the poor old soul; I wish her\nevery heavenly blessing; and her time is come for all of them. But I\nnever like to think of that, because one's own time might come first. I\nhave felt very much out of spirits to-day, as my poor father did the day\nbefore he got his billet. You know, Matilda, he was under old Boscawen,\nand was killed by the very first shot fired; it must be five-and-forty\nyears ago. How my mother did cry, to be sure! But I was too young to\nunderstand it. Ah, she had a bad time with us all! Matilda, what would\nyou do without me?\"\n\n\"Why, Charles, you are not a bit like yourself. Don't go to-night; stay\nat home for once. And the weather is very uncertain, too. They never\nwill attempt their job to-night. Countermand the boats, dear; I\nwill send word to stop them. You shall not even go out of the house\nyourself.\"\n\n\"As if it were possible! I am not an old woman, nor even an old man yet,\nI hope. In half an hour I must be off. There will be good time for\na pipe. One more pipe in the old home, Tilly. After all I am well\ncontented with it, although now and then I grumble; and I don't like so\nmuch cleaning.\"\n\n\"The cleaning must be done; I could never leave off that. Your room is\ngoing to be turned out to-morrow, and before you go you must put away\nyour papers, unless you wish me to do it. You really never seem to\nunderstand when things are really important. Do you wish me to have\na great fever in the house? It is a fortnight since your boards were\nscrubbed; and how can you think of smoking?\"\n\n\"Very well, Tilly, I can have it by-and-by, 'upon the dancing waves,' as\nlittle Tommy has picked up the song. Only I can not let the men on duty;\nand to see them longing destroys my pleasure. Lord, how many times I\nshould like to pass my pipe to Dick, or Ellis, if discipline allowed of\nit! A thing of that sort is not like feeding, which must be kept apart\nby nature; but this by custom only.\"\n\n\"And a very good custom, and most needful,\" answered Mrs. Carroway. \"I\nnever can see why men should want to do all sorts of foolish things with\ntobacco--dirty stuff, and full of dust. No sooner do they begin, like a\ntinder-box, than one would think that it made them all alike. They want\nto see another body puffing two great streams of reeking smoke from\npipe and from mouth, as if their own was not enough; and their good\nresolutions to speak truth of one another float away like so much smoke;\nand they fill themselves with bad charity. Sir Walter Raleigh deserved\nhis head off, and Henry the Eighth knew what was right.\"\n\n\"My dear, I fancy that your history is wrong. The king only chopped off\nhis own wives' heads. But the moral of the lesson is the same. I will\ngo and put away my papers. It will very soon be dark enough for us to\nstart.\"\n\n\"Charles, I can not bear your going. The weather is so dark, and the sea\nso lonely, and the waves are making such a melancholy sound. It is not\nlike the summer nights, when I can see you six miles off, with the moon\nupon the sails, and the land out of the way. Let anybody catch him that\nhas the luck. Don't go this time, Charley.\"\n\nCarroway kissed his wife, and sent her to the baby, who was squalling\nwell up stairs. And when she came down he was ready to start, and she\nbrought the baby for him to kiss.\n\n\"Good-by, little chap--good-by, dear wife.\" With his usual vigor and\nflourish, he said, \"I never knew how to kiss a baby, though I have had\nsuch a lot of them.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Charley dear. All your things are right; and here is the key\nof the locker. You are fitted out for three days; but you must on no\naccount make that time of it. To-morrow I shall be very busy, but you\nmust be home by the evening. Perhaps there will be a favorite thing of\nyours for supper. You are going a long way; but don't be long.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Tilly darling--good-by, Jerry dear--good-by, Tommy boy, and\nall my countless family. I am coming home to-morrow with a mint of\nmoney.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTACTICS OF DEFENSE\n\n\nThe sea at this time was not pleasant, and nobody looking at it longed\nto employ upon it any members of a shorter reach than eyes.\n\nIt was not rushing upon the land, nor running largely in the offing, nor\nmaking white streaks on the shoals; neither in any other places doing\nthings remarkable. No sign whatever of coming storm or gathering fury\nmoved it; only it was sullen, heavy, petulant, and out of sorts. It went\nabout its business in a state of lumps irregular, without long billows\nor big furrows, as if it took the impulse more of distant waters than of\nwind; and its color was a dirty green. Ancient fishermen hate this, and\nancient mariners do the same; for then the fish lie sulking on their\nbellies, and then the ship wallows without gift of sail.\n\n\"Bear off, Tomkins, and lay by till the ebb. I can only say, dash the\nwhole of it!\"\n\nCommander Nettlebones, of the Swordfish, gave this order in disgust at\nlast; for the tide was against her, with a heavy pitch of sea, and the\nmainsail scarcely drew the sheet. What little wind there was came off\nthe land, and would have been fair if it had been firm; but often it\ndropped altogether where the cliffs, or the clouds that lay upon them,\nheld it. The cutter had slipped away from Scarborough, as soon as it was\ndark last night, under orders for Robin Hood's Bay, where the Albatross\nand Kestrel were to meet her, bring tidings, and take orders. Partly\nby coast-riding, and partly by coast signals, it had been arranged that\nthese three revenue cruisers should come together in a lonely place\nduring the haze of November morning, and hold privy council of\nimportance. From Scarborough, with any wind at all, or even with\nordinary tide-run, a coal barge might almost make sure of getting to\nRobin Hood's Bay in six hours, if the sea was fit to swim in. Yet\nhere was a cutter that valued herself upon her sailing powers already\neighteen hours out, and headed back perpetually, like a donkey-plough.\nCommander Nettlebones could not understand it, and the more impatient he\nbecame, the less could he enter into it. The sea was nasty, and the\nwind uncertain, also the tide against him; but how often had such things\ncombined to hinder, and yet he had made much fairer way! Fore and aft he\nbestrode the planks, and cast keen eyes at everything, above, around,\nor underneath, but nothing showed him anything. Nettlebones was\na Cornishman, and Cornishmen at that time had a reverent faith in\nwitchcraft. \"Robin Lyth has bought the powers, or ancient Carroway\nhas done it,\" he said to himself, in stronger language than is now\nreportable. \"Old Carroway is against us, I know, from his confounded\njealousy; and this cursed delay will floor all my plans.\"\n\nHe deserved to have his best plans floored for such vile suspicion of\nCarroway. Whatever the brave lieutenant did was loyal, faithful, and\nwell above-board. Against the enemy he had his plans, as every great\ncommander must, and he certainly did not desire to have his glory stolen\nby Nettlebones. But that he would have suffered, with only a grin at the\nbad luck so habitual; to do any crooked thing against it was not in his\nnature. The cause of the grief of Commander Nettlebones lay far away\nfrom Carroway; and free trade was at the bottom of it.\n\nFor now this trim and lively craft was doing herself but scanty credit,\neither on or off a wind. She was like a poor cat with her tail in a gin,\nwhich sadly obstructs her progress; even more was she like to the little\nhorse of wood, which sits on the edge of a table and gallops, with a\nbalance weight limiting his energies. None of the crew could understand\nit, if they were to be believed; and the more sagacious talked of\ncurrents and mysterious \"under-tow.\" And sure enough it was under-tow,\nthe mystery of which was simple. One of the very best hands on board was\na hardy seaman from Flamborough, akin to old Robin Cockscroft, and no\nstranger to his adopted son. This gallant seaman fully entered into the\nvalue of long leverage, and he made fine use of a plug-hole which\nhad come to his knowledge behind his berth. It was just above the\nwater-line, and out of sight from deck, because the hollow of the run\nwas there. And long ere the lights of Scarborough died into the haze\nof night, as the cutter began to cleave watery way, the sailor passed\na stout new rope from a belaying-pin through this hole, and then he\nbetrayed his watch on deck by hauling the end up with a clew, and gently\nreturning it to the deep with a long grappling-iron made fast to it.\nThis had not fluke enough to lay fast hold and bring the vessel up; for\nin that case it would have been immediately discovered; but it dragged\nalong the bottom like a trawl, and by its weight, and a hitch every now\nand then in some hole, it hampered quite sufficiently the objectionable\nvoyage. Instead of meeting her consorts in the cloud of early morning,\nthe Swordfish was scarcely abreast of the Southern Cheek by the middle\nof the afternoon. No wonder if Commander Nettlebones was in a fury\nlong ere that, and fitted neither to give nor take the counsel of calm\nwisdom; and this condition of his mind, as well as the loss of precious\ntime, should have been taken into more consideration by those who\ncondemned him for the things that followed.\n\n\"Better late than never, as they say,\" he cried, when the Kestrel and\nthe Albatross hove in sight. \"Tomkins, signal to make sail and close.\nWe seem to be moving more lively at last. I suppose we are out of that\ninfernal under-tow.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, she seems like herself a little more. She've had a witch on\nboard of her, that's where it is. When I were a younker, just joined his\nMajesty's forty-two-gun frigate--\"\n\n\"Stow that, Tomkins. No time now. I remember all about it, and very good\nit is. Let us have it all again when this job is done with. Bowler and\nDonovan will pick holes if they can, after waiting for us half a day.\nNot a word about our slow sailing, mind; leave that to me. They are\nframptious enough. Have everything trim, and all hands ready. When they\nrange within hail, sing out for both to come to me.\"\n\nIt was pretty to see the three cutters meet, all handled as smartly\nas possible; for the Flamborough man had cast off his clog, and the\nSwordfish again was as nimble as need be. Lieutenants Bowler and Donovan\nwere soon in the cabin of their senior officer, and durst not question\nhim very strictly as to his breach of rendezvous, for his manner was\nshort and sharp with them.\n\n\"There is plenty of time, if we waste it not in talking,\" he said, when\nthey had finished comparing notes. \"All these reports we are bound to\nreceive and consider; but I believe none of them. The reason why poor\nCarroway has made nothing but a mess of it is that he will listen to the\ncountry people's tales. They are all bound together, all tarred with one\nbrush--all stuffed with a heap of lies, to send us wrong; and as for the\nfishing-boats, and what they see, I have been here long enough already\nto be sure that their fishing is a sham nine times in ten, and their\nreal business is to help those rogues. Our plan is to listen, and\npretend to be misled.\"\n\n\"True for you, captain,\" cried the ardent Donovan. \"You 'bout ship as\nsoon as you can see them out of sight.\"\n\n\"My own opinion is this,\" said Bowler, \"that we never shall catch any\nfellow until we have a large sum of money placed at our disposal. The\ngeneral feeling is in their favor, and against us entirely. Why is it in\ntheir favor? Because they are generally supposed to run great risks, and\nsuffer great hardships. And so they do; but not half so much as we do,\nwho keep the sea in all sorts of weather, while they can choose their\nown. Also because they outrun the law, which nature makes everybody long\nto do, and admire the lucky ones who can. But most of all because they\nare free-handed, and we can be only niggards. They rob the king with\nimpunity, because they pay well for doing it; and he pays badly, or\nnot at all, to defend himself from robbery. If we had a thousand pounds\napiece, with orders to spend it on public service, take no receipt,\nand give no account, I am sure that in three months we could stop all\ncontraband work upon this coast.\"\n\n\"Upon me sowl and so we could; and it's meself that would go into the\ntrade, so soon as it was stopped with the thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"We have no time for talking nonsense;\" answered Nettlebones, severely,\naccording to the universal law that the man who has wasted the time of\nothers gets into a flurry about his own. \"Your suggestion, Bowler, is\na very wise one, and as full as possible of common-sense. You\nalso, Donovan, have shown with great sagacity what might come of it\nthereafter. But unluckily we have to get on as we can, without sixpence\nto spare for anybody. We know that the fishermen and people on the\ncoast, and especially the womankind, are all to a man--as our good\nfriend here would say--banded in league against us. Nevertheless, this\nlanding shall not be, at least upon our district. What happens north of\nTeesmouth is none of our business; and we should have the laugh of the\nold Scotchman there, if they pay him a visit, as I hope they may; for he\ncuts many jokes at our expense. But, by the Lord Harry, there shall be\nno run between the Tees and Yare, this side of Christmas. If there is,\nwe may call ourselves three old women. Shake hands, gentlemen, upon that\npoint; and we will have a glass of grog to it.\"\n\nThis was friendly, and rejoiced them all; for Nettlebones had been stiff\nat first. Readily enough they took his orders, which seemed to make it\nimpossible almost for anything large to slip between them, except in\ncase of a heavy fog; and in that case they were to land, and post their\noutlooks near the likely places.\n\n\"We have shed no blood yet, and I hope we never shall,\" said the senior\nofficer, pleasantly. \"The smugglers of this coast are too wise, and I\nhope too kind-hearted, for that sort of work. They are not like those\ndesperate scoundrels of Sussex. When these men are nabbed, they give up\ntheir venture as soon as it goes beyond cudgel-play, and they never\nlie in wait for a murderous revenge. In the south I have known a very\ndifferent race, who would jump on an officer till he died, or lash him\nto death with their long cart-whips; such fellows as broke open Poole\nCustom-house, and murdered poor Galley and Cator, and the rest, in a\nmanner that makes human blood run cold. It was some time back; but their\nsons are just as bad. Smuggling turns them all to devils.\"\n\n\"My belief is,\" said Bowler, who had a gift of looking at things from an\nouter point of view, \"that these fellows never propose to themselves\nto transgress the law, but to carry it out according to their own\ninterpretation. One of them reasoned with me some time ago, and he\ntalked so well about the Constitution that I was at a loss to answer\nhim.\"\n\n\"Me jewel, forbear,\" shouted Donovan; \"a clout on the head is the only\nanswer for them Constitutionals. Niver will it go out of my mind about\nthe time I was last in Cark; shure, thin, and it was holiday-time; and\nme sister's wife's cousin, young Tim O'Brady--Tim says to me, 'Now,\nCorkoran, me lad--'\"\n\n\"Donovan,\" Nettlebones suddenly broke in, \"we will have that story,\nwhich I can see by the cut of your jib is too good to be hurried, when\nfirst we come together after business done. The sun will be down in less\nthan half an hour, and by that time we all must be well under way. We\nare watched from the land, as I need not tell you, and we must not let\nthem spy for nothing. They shall see us all stand out to sea to catch\nthem in the open, as I said in the town-hall of Scarborough yesterday,\non purpose. Everybody laughed; but I stuck to it, knowing how far the\ntale would go. They take it for a crotchet of mine, and will expect it,\nespecially after they have seen us standing out; and their plans will be\nlaid accordingly.\"\n\n\"The head-piece ye have is beyont me inthirely. And if ye stand out, how\nwill ye lay close inshore?\"\n\n\"By returning, my good friend, before the morning breaks; each man\nto his station, lying as close as can be by day, with proper outlooks\nhidden at the points, but standing along the coast every night,\nand communicating with sentries. Have nothing to say to any\nfishing-boats--they are nearly all spies--and that puzzles them. This\nRobin Hood's Bay is our centre for the present, unless there comes\nchange of weather. Donovan's beat is from Whitby to Teesmouth, mine from\nWhitby to Scarborough, and Bowler's thence to Flamborough. Carroway goes\nwhere he likes, of course, as the manner of the man is. He is a\nlittle in the doldrums now, and likely enough to come meddling. From\nFlamborough to Hornsea is left to him, and quite as much as he can\nmanage. Further south there is no fear; our Yarmouth men will see to\nthat. Now I think that you quite understand. Good-by; we shall nab some\nof them to a certainty this time; they are trying it on too large a\nscale.\"\n\n\"If they runs any goods through me, then just ye may reckon the legs of\nme four times over.\"\n\n\"And if they slip in past me,\" said Bowler, \"without a thick fog, or a\nstorm that drives me off, I will believe more than all the wonders told\nof Robin Lyth.\"\n\n\"Oh! concerning that fellow, by-the-bye,\" Commander Nettlebones stopped\nhis brother officers as they were making off; \"you know what a point\npoor Carroway has made, even before I was sent down here, of catching\nthe celebrated Robin for himself. He has even let his fellows fire at\nhim once or twice when he was quietly departing, although we are not\nallowed to shoot except upon strenuous resistance. Cannon we may fire,\nbut no muskets, according to wise ordinance. Luckily, he has not hit him\nyet; and, upon the whole, we should be glad of it, for the young fellow\nis a prime sailor, as you know, and would make fine stuff for Nelson.\nTherefore we must do one thing of two--let Carroway catch him, and get\nthe money to pay for all the breeches and the petticoats we saw; or\nif we catch him ourselves, say nothing, but draft him right off to the\nHarpy. You understand me. It is below us to get blood-money upon the\nman. We are gentlemen, not thief-catchers.\"\n\nThe Irishman agreed to this at once, but Bowler was not well pleased\nwith it. \"Our duty is to give him up,\" he said.\n\n\"Your duty is to take my orders,\" answered Nettlebones, severely. \"If\nthere is a fuss about it, lay the blame on me. I know what I am about in\nwhat I say. Gentlemen, good-by, and good luck to you.\"\n\nAfter long shivers in teeth of the wind and pendulous labor of rolling,\nthe three cutters joyfully took the word to go. With a creak, and a\ncant, and a swish of canvas, upon their light heels they flew round,\nand trembled with the eagerness of leaping on their way. The taper boom\ndipped toward the running hills of sea, and the jib-foreleech drew a\nwhite arc against the darkness of the sky to the bowsprit's plunge.\nThen, as each keen cut-water clove with the pressure of the wind upon\nthe beam, and the glistening bends lay over, green hurry of surges\nstreaked with gray began the quick dance along them. Away they went\nmerrily, scattering the brine, and leaving broad tracks upon the closing\nsea.\n\nAway also went, at a rapid scamper, three men who had watched them from\nthe breast-work of the cliffs--one went northward, another to the south,\nand the third rode a pony up an inland lane. Swiftly as the cutters flew\nover the sea, the tidings of their flight took wing ashore, and before\nthe night swallowed up their distant sails, everybody on the land whom\nit concerned to know, knew as well as their steersmen what course they\nhad laid.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nINLAND OPINION\n\n\nWhatever may be said, it does seem hard, from a wholly disinterested\npoint of view, that so many mighty men, with swift ships, armed with\nvillainous saltpetre and sharp steel, should have set their keen faces\nall together and at once to nip, defeat, and destroy as with a blow,\nliberal and well-conceived proceedings, which they had long regarded\nwith a larger mind. Every one who had been led to embark soundly and\nkindly in this branch of trade felt it as an outrage and a special\ninstance of his own peculiar bad luck that suddenly the officers should\nbecome so active. For long success had encouraged enterprise; men who\nhad made a noble profit nobly yearned to treble it; and commerce, having\nshaken off her shackles, flapped her wings and began to crow; so at\nleast she had been declared to do at a public banquet given by the Mayor\nof Malton, and attended by a large grain factor, who was known as a\nwholesale purveyor of illicit goods.\n\nThis man, Thomas Rideout, long had been the head-master of the smuggling\nschool. The poor sea-faring men could not find money to buy, or even\nhire, the craft (with heavy deposit against forfeiture) which the\nbreadth and turbulence of the North Sea made needful for such ventures.\nAcross the narrow English Channel an open lobster boat might run, in\ncommon summer weather, without much risk of life or goods. Smooth water,\nsandy coves, and shelfy landings tempted comfortable jobs; and any man\nowning a boat that would carry a sail as big as a shawl might smuggle,\nwith heed of the weather, and audacity. It is said that once upon the\nSussex coast a band of haymakers, when the rick was done, and their\nwages in hand on a Saturday night, laid hold of a stout boat on the\nbeach, pushed off to sea in tipsy faith of luck, and hit upon Dieppe\nwith a set-fair breeze, having only a fisherman's boy for guide. There\non the Sunday they heartily enjoyed the hospitality of the natives; and\nthe dawn of Tuesday beheld them rapt in domestic bliss and breakfast,\nwith their money invested in old Cognac; and glad would they have been\nto make such hay every season. But in Yorkshire a good solid capital\nwas needed to carry on free importation. Without broad bottoms and deep\nsides, the long and turbulent and often foggy voyage, and the rocky\nlanding, could scarcely be attempted by sane folk; well-to-do people\nfound the money, and jeopardized neither their own bodies, consciences,\nnor good repute. And perhaps this fact had more to do with the\ncomparative mildness of the men than difference of race, superior\nculture, or a loftier mould of mind; for what man will fight for his\nemployer's goods with the ferocity inspired by his own? A thorough\ngood ducking, or a tow behind a boat, was the utmost penalty generally\nexacted by the victors from the vanquished.\n\nNow, however, it seemed too likely that harder measures must be meted.\nThe long success of that daring Lyth, and the large scale of his\noperations, had compelled the authorities to stir at last. They began by\nsetting a high price upon him, and severely reprimanding Carroway, who\nhad long been doing his best in vain, and becoming flurried, did it\nmore vainly still; and now they had sent the sharp Nettlebones down, who\nboasted largely, but as yet without result. The smugglers, however, were\naware of added peril, and raised their wages accordingly.\n\nWhen the pending great venture was resolved upon, as a noble finish to\nthe season, Thomas Rideout would intrust it to no one but Robin Lyth\nhimself; and the bold young mariner stipulated that after succeeding\nhe should be free, and started in some more lawful business. For Dr.\nUpround, possessing as he did great influence with Robin, and shocked\nas he was by what Carroway had said, refused to have anything more to\ndo with his most distinguished parishioner until he should forsake his\nways. And for this he must not be thought narrow-minded, strait-laced,\nor unduly dignified. His wife quite agreed with him, and indeed had\nurged it as the only proper course; for her motherly mind was uneasy\nabout the impulsive nature of Janetta; and chess-men to her were dolls,\nwithout even the merit of encouraging the needle. Therefore, with a deep\nsigh, the worthy magistrate put away his board--which came out again\nnext day--and did his best to endure for a night the arithmetical\ntorture of cribbage; while he found himself supported by a sense of\nduty, and capable of preaching hard at Carroway if he would only come\nfor it on Sunday.\n\nFrom that perhaps an officer of revenue may abstain, through the\npressure of his duty and his purity of conscience; but a man of less\ncorrectness must behave more strictly. Therefore, when a gentleman of\nvigorous aspect, resolute step, and successful-looking forehead marched\ninto church the next Sunday morning, showed himself into a prominent\nposition, and hung his hat against a leading pillar, after putting his\nmouth into it, as if for prayer, but scarcely long enough to say \"Amen,\"\nbehind other hats low whispers passed that here was the great financier\nof free trade, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of smuggling, the\ncelebrated Master Rideout.\n\nThat conclusion was shared by the rector, whose heart immediately burned\nwithin him to have at this man, whom he had met before and suspiciously\nglanced at in Weighing Lane, as an interloper in his parish. Probably\nthis was the very man whom Robin Lyth served too faithfully; and the\nchances were that the great operations now known to be pending had\nbrought him hither, spying out all Flamborough. The corruption of\nfish-folk, the beguiling of women with foreign silks and laces, and of\nmen with brandy, the seduction of Robin from lawful commerce, and even\nthe loss of his own pet pastime, were to be laid at this man's door.\nWhile donning his surplice, Dr. Upround revolved these things with\ngentle indignation, quickened, as soon as he found himself in white, by\nclerical and theological zeal. These feelings impelled him to produce a\ncreaking of the heavy vestry door, a well-known signal for his daughter\nto slip out of the chancel pew and come to him.\n\n\"Now, papa, what is it?\" cried that quick young lady; \"that miserable\nMethodist that ruined your boots, has he got the impudence to come\nagain? Oh, please do say so, and show me where he is; after church\nnobody shall stop me--\"\n\n\"Janetta, you quite forget where you are, as well as my present\ncondition. Be off like a good girl, as quick as you can, and bring No.\n27 of my own handwriting--'Render unto Caesar'--and put my hat upon it.\nMy desire is that Billyjack should not know that a change has been made\nin my subject of discourse.\"\n\n\"Papa, I see; it shall be done to perfection, while Billyjack is at his\nvery loudest roar in the chorus of the anthem. But do tell me who it is;\nor how can I enjoy it? And lemon drops--lemon drops--\"\n\n\"Janetta, I must have some very serious talk with you. Now don't be\nvexed, darling; you are a thoroughly good girl, only thoughtless and\ncareless; and remember, dear, church is not a place for high spirits.\"\n\nThe rector, as behooved him, kissed his child behind the vestry door, to\nsoothe all sting, and then he strode forth toward the reading-desk; and\nthe tuning of fiddles sank to deferential scrape.\n\nIt was not at all a common thing, as one might know, for Widow Precious\nto be able to escape from casks and taps, and the frying pan of eggs\ndemanded by some half-drowned fisherman, also the reckoning of notches\non the bench for the pints of the week unpaid for, and then to put\nherself into her two best gowns (which she wore in the winter, one over\nthe other--a plan to be highly commended to ladies who never can have\ndress enough), and so to enjoy, without losing a penny, the warmth of\nthe neighborhood of a congregation. In the afternoon she could hardly\never do it, even if she had so wished, with knowledge that this was\ncommon people's time; so if she went at all, it must--in spite of the\ndifference of length--be managed in the morning. And this very morning\nhere she was, earnest, humble, and devout, with both the tap keys in her\npocket, and turning the leaves with a smack of her thumb, not only to\nshow her learning, but to get the sweet approval of the rector's pew.\n\nNow if the good rector had sent for this lady, instead of his daughter\nJanetta, the sermon which he brought would have been the one to preach,\nand that about Caesar might have stopped at home; for no sooner did the\nwidow begin to look about, taking in the congregation with a dignified\neye, and nodding to her solvent customers, than the wrath of perplexity\nbegan to gather on her goodly countenance. To see that distinguished\nstranger was to know him ever afterward; his power of eating, and of\npaying, had endeared his memory; and for him to put up at any other\nhouse were foul shame to the \"Cod Fish.\"\n\n\"Hath a' put up his beastie?\" she whispered to her eldest daughter, who\ncame in late.\n\n\"Naa, naa, no beastie,\" the child replied, and the widow's relish of\nher thumb was gone; for, sooth to say, no Master Rideout, nor any other\npatron of free trade was here, but Geoffrey Mordacks, of York city,\ngeneral factor, and universal agent.\n\nIt was beautiful to see how Dr. Upround, firmly delivering his text, and\nstoutly determined to spare nobody, even insisted in the present\ncase upon looking at the man he meant to hit, because he was not his\nparishioner. The sermon was eloquent, and even trenchant. The necessity\nof duties was urged most sternly; if not of directly Divine institution\n(though learned parallels were adduced which almost proved them to be\nso), yet to every decent Christian citizen they were synonymous with\nduty. To defy or elude them, for the sake of paltry gain, was a dark\ncrime recoiling on the criminal; and the preacher drew a contrast\nbetween such guilty ways and the innocent path of the fisherman. Neither\ndid he even relent and comfort, according to his custom, toward the end;\nthat part was there, but he left it out; and the only consolation for\nany poor smuggler in all the discourse was the final Amen.\n\nBut to the rector's great amazement, and inward indignation, the object\nof his sermon seemed to take it as a personal compliment. Mr. Mordacks\nnot only failed to wince, but finding himself particularly fixed by the\ngaze of the eloquent divine, concluded that it was from his superior\nintelligence, and visible gifts of appreciation. Delighted with\nthis--for he was not free from vanity--what did he do but return the\ncompliment, not indecorously, but nodding very gently, as much as\nto say, \"That was very good indeed, you were quite right, sir, in\naddressing that to me; you perceive that it is far above these common\npeople. I never heard a better sermon.\"\n\n\"What a hardened rogue you are!\" thought Dr. Upround; \"how feebly and\nincapably I must have put it! If you ever come again, you shall have my\nAhab sermon.\"\n\nBut the clergyman was still more astonished a very few minutes\nafterward. For, as he passed out of the church-yard gate, receiving,\nwith his wife and daughter, the kindly salute of the parish, the same\ntall stranger stood before him, with a face as hard as a statue's, and,\nmaking a short, quick flourish with his hat, begged for the honor of\nshaking his hand.\n\n\"Sir, it is to thank you for the very finest sermon I ever had the\nprivilege of hearing. My name is Mordacks, and I flatter nobody--except\nmyself--that I know a good thing when I get it.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am obliged to you,\" said Dr. Upround, stiffly, and not without\nsuspicion of being bantered, so dry was the stranger's countenance, and\nhis manner so peculiar; \"and if I have been enabled to say a good word\nin season, and its season lasts, it will be a source of satisfaction to\nme.\"\n\n\"Yes, I fear there are many smugglers here. But I am no revenue\nofficer, as your congregation seemed to think. May I call upon business\nto-morrow, sir? Thank you; then may I say ten o'clock--your time of\nbeginning, as I hear? Mordacks is my name, sir, of York city, not\nunfavorably known there. Ladies, my duty to you!\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary man, my dear!\" Mrs. Upround exclaimed, with some\ningratitude, after the beautiful bow she had received. \"He may talk as\nhe likes, but he must be a smuggler. He said that he was not an officer;\nthat shows it, for they always run into the opposite extreme. You\nhave converted him, my dear; and I am sure that we ought to be so much\nobliged to him. If he comes to-morrow morning to give up all his lace,\ndo try to remember how my little all has been ruined in the wash, and I\nam sick of working at it.\"\n\n\"My dear, he is no smuggler. I begin to recollect. He was down here in\nthe summer, and I made a great mistake. I took him for Rideout; and I\ndid the same to-day. When I see him to-morrow, I shall beg his pardon.\nOne gets so hurried in the vestry always; they are so impatient with\ntheir fiddles! A great deal of it was Janetta's fault.\"\n\n\"It always is my fault, papa, somehow or other,\" the young lady\nanswered, with a faultless smile: and so they went home to the early\nSunday dinner.\n\n\"Papa, I am in such a state of excitement; I am quite unfit to go to\nchurch this afternoon,\" Miss Upround exclaimed, as they set forth again.\n\"You may put me in stocks made out of hassocks--you may rope me to the\nFlodden Field man's monument, of the ominous name of 'Constable;' but\nwhatever you do, I shall never attend; and I feel that it is so sinful.\"\n\n\"Janetta, your mamma has that feeling sometimes; for instance, she has\nit this afternoon; and there is a good deal to be said for it. But I\nfear that it would grow with indulgence.\"\n\n\"I can firmly fancy that it never would; though one can not be sure\nwithout trying. Suppose that I were to try it just once, and let you\nknow how it feels at tea-time?\"\n\n\"My dear, we are quite round the corner of the lane. The example would\nbe too shocking.\"\n\n\"Now don't you make any excuses, papa. Only one woman can have seen\nus yet; and she is so blind she will think it was her fault. May I go?\nQuick, before any one else comes.\"\n\n\"If you are quite sure, Janetta, of being in a frame of mind which\nunfits you for the worship of your Maker--\"\n\n\"As sure as a pike-staff, dear papa.\"\n\n\"Then, by all means, go before anybody sees you, for whom it might\nbe undesirable; and correct your thoughts, and endeavor to get into a\nbefitting state of mind by tea-time.\"\n\n\"Certainly, papa. I will go down on the stones, and look at the\nsea. That always makes me better; because it is so large and so\nuncomfortable.\"\n\nThe rector went on to do his duty, by himself. A narrow-minded man might\nhave shaken solemn head, even if he had allowed such dereliction. But\nDr. Upround knew that the girl was good, and he never put strain upon\nher honesty. So away she sped by a lonely little foot-path, where nobody\ncould take from her contagion of bad morals; and avoiding the incline\nof boats, she made off nicely for the quiet outer bay, and there, upon a\nshelfy rock, she sat and breathed the sea.\n\nFlamborough, excellent place as it is, and delightful, and full of\ninterest for people who do not live there, is apt to grow dull perhaps\nfor spirited youth, in the scanty and foggy winter light. There is not\nso very much of that choice product generally called \"society\" by a man\nwho has a house to let in an eligible neighborhood, and by ladies who do\nnot heed their own. Moreover, it is vexatious not to have more rogues to\ntalk about.\n\nThat scarcity may be less lamentable now, being one that takes care\nto redress itself, and perhaps any amateur purchaser of fish may find\nrogues enough now for his interest. But the rector's daughter pined for\nneither society nor scandal: she had plenty of interest in her life,\nand in pleasing other people, whenever she could do it with pleasure\nto herself, and that was nearly always. Her present ailment was not\nlanguor, weariness, or dullness, but rather the want of such things;\nwhich we long for when they happen to be scarce, and declare them to be\nour first need, under the sweet name of repose.\n\nHer mind was a little disturbed by rumors, wonders, and uncertainty. She\nwas not at all in love with Robin Lyth, and laughed at his vanity quite\nas much as she admired his gallantry. She looked upon him also as of\nlower rank, kindly patronized by her father, but not to be treated as\nupon an equal footing. He might be of any rank, for all that was known;\nbut he must be taken to belong to those who had brought him up and fed\nhim. Janetta was a lively girl, of quick perception and some discretion,\nthough she often talked much nonsense. She was rather proud of her\nposition, and somewhat disdainful of uneducated folk; though (thanks to\nher father) Lyth was not one of these. Possibly love (if she had felt\nit) would have swept away such barriers; but Robin was grateful to his\npatron, and, knowing his own place in life, would rightly have thought\nit a mean return to attempt to inveigle the daughter. So they liked one\nanother--but nothing more. It was not, therefore, for his sake only,\nbut for her father's, and that of the place, that Miss Upround now\nwas anxious. For days and days she had watched the sea with unusual\nforebodings, knowing that a great importation was toward, and pretty\nsure to lead to blows, after so much preparation. With feminine zeal,\nshe detested poor Carroway, whom she regarded as a tyrant and a spy;\nand she would have clapped her hands at beholding the three cruisers\nrun upon a shoal, and there stick fast. And as for King George, she had\nnever believed that he was the proper King of England. There were many\nstanch Jacobites still in Yorkshire, and especially the bright young\nladies.\n\nTo-night, at least, the coast was likely to be uninvaded. Smugglers,\neven if their own forces would make breach upon the day of rest, durst\nnot outrage the piety of the land, which would only deal with kegs\nin-doors. The coast-guard, being for the most part southerns, splashed\nabout as usual--a far more heinous sin against the Word of God than\nsmuggling. It is the manner of Yorkshiremen to think for themselves,\nwith boldness, in the way they are brought up to: and they made it a\npoint of serious doubt whether the orders of the king himself could set\naside the Fourth Commandment, though his arms were over it.\n\nDr. Upround's daughter, as she watched the sea, felt sure that, even if\nthe goods were ready, no attempt at landing would be made that night,\nthough something might be done in the morning. But even that was not\nvery likely, because (as seemed to be widely known) the venture was a\nvery large one, and the landers would require a whole night's work to\nget entirely through with it.\n\n\"I wish it was over, one way or the other,\" she kept on saying to\nherself, as she gazed at the dark, weary lifting of the sea; \"it keeps\none unsettled as the waves themselves. Sunday always makes me feel\nrestless, because there is so little to do. It is wicked, I suppose; but\nhow can I help it? Why, there is a boat, I do declare! Well, even a boat\nis welcome, just to break this gray monotony. What boat can it be? None\nof ours, of course. And what can they want with our Church Cave? I hope\nthey understand its dangers.\"\n\nAlthough the wind was not upon the shore, and no long rollers were\nsetting in, short, uncomfortable, clumsy waves were lolloping under the\nsteep gray cliffs, and casting up splashes of white here and there. To\nenter that cave is a risky thing, except at very favorable times, and\neven then some experience is needed, for the rocks around it are like\nknives, and the boat must generally be backed in, with more use of\nfender and hook than of oars. But the people in the boat seemed to\nunderstand all that. There were two men rowing, and one steering with an\noar, and a fourth standing up, as if to give directions; though in truth\nhe knew nothing about it, but hated even to seem to play second fiddle.\n\n\"What a strange thing!\" Janetta thought, as she drew behind a rock, that\nthey might not see her, \"I could almost declare that the man standing\nup is that most extraordinary gentleman papa preached quite the wrong\nsermon at. Truly he deserves the Ahab one, for spying our caves out on a\nSunday. He must be a smuggler, after all, or a very crafty agent of the\nRevenue. Well, I never! That old man steering, as sure as I live, is\nRobin Cockscroft, by the scarlet handkerchief round his head. Oh, Robin!\nRobin! could I ever have believed that you would break the Sabbath so?\nBut the boat is not Robin's. What boat can it be? I have not staid away\nfrom church for nothing. One of the men rowing has got no legs, when the\nboat goes up and down. It must be that villain of a tipsy Joe, who used\nto keep the 'Monument.' I heard that he was come back again, to stump\nfor his beer as usual: and his son, that sings like the big church bell,\nand has such a very fine face and one leg--why, he is the man that pulls\nthe other oar. Was there ever such a boat-load? But they know what they\nare doing.\"\n\nTruly it was, as the young lady said, an extraordinary boat's crew. Old\nRobin Cockscroft, with a fringe of silver hair escaping from the crimson\nsilk, which he valued so much more than it, and his face still grand (in\nspite of wrinkles and some weakness of the eyes), keenly understanding\nevery wave, its character, temper, and complexity of influence, as only\na man can understand who has for his life stood over them. Then tugging\nat the oars, or rather dipping them with a short well-practiced plunge,\nand very little toil of body, two ancient sailors, one considerably\nolder than the other, inasmuch as he was his father, yet chips alike\nfrom a sturdy block, and fitted up with jury-stumps. Old Joe pulled\nrather the better oar, and called his son \"a one-legged fiddler\" when he\nmissed the dip of wave; while Mordacks stood with his leg's apart, and\nplaying the easy part of critic, had his sneers at both of them. But\nthey let him gibe to his liking; because they knew their work, and he\ndid not. And, upon the whole, they went merrily.\n\nThe only one with any doubt concerning the issue of the job was the one\nwho knew most about it, and that was Robin Cockscroft. He doubted not\nabout want of strength, or skill, or discipline of his oars, but because\nthe boat was not Flamburian, but borrowed from a collier round the Head.\nNo Flamborough boat would ever think of putting to sea on a Sunday,\nunless it were to save human life; and it seemed to him that no strange\nboat could find her way into the native caves. He doubted also whether,\neven with the pressure of strong motive put upon him, which was not of\nmoney, it was a godly thing on his part to be steering in his Sunday\nclothes; and he feared to hear of it thereafter. But being in for it, he\nmust do his utmost.\n\nWith genuine skill and solid patience, the entrance of the cave was\nmade, and the boat was lost to Janetta's view. She as well was lost in\nthe deeper cavern of great wonder, and waited long, and much desired\nto wait even longer, to see them issue forth again, and learn what they\ncould have been after. But the mist out of which they had come, and\ninside of which they would rather have remained perhaps, now thickened\nover land and sea, and groping dreamily for something to lay hold of,\nfound a solid stay and rest-hold in the jagged headlands here. Here,\naccordingly, the coilings of the wandering forms began to slide into\nstrait layers, and soft settlement of vapor. Loops of hanging moisture\nmarked the hollows of the land-front, or the alleys of the waning light;\nand then the mass abandoned outline, fused its shades to pulp, and\nmelted into one great blur of rain. Janetta thought of her Sunday frock,\nforgot the boat, and sped away for home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTACTICS OF ATTACK\n\n\n\"I am sorry to be troublesome, Mynheer Van Dunck, but I can not say\ngood-by without having your receipt in full for the old bilander.\"\n\n\"Goot, it is vere good, Meester Lyth; you are te goot man for te\npisness.\"\n\nWith these words the wealthy merchant of the Zuyder-Zee drew forth\nhis ancient inkhorn, smeared with the dirt of countless contracts, and\nsigned an acquittance which the smuggler had prepared. But he signed it\nwith a sigh, as a man declares that a favorite horse must go at last;\nsighing, not for the money, but the memories that go with it. Then, as\nthe wind began to pipe, and the roll of the sea grew heavier, the solid\nDutchman was lowered carefully into his shore boat, and drew the apron\nover his great and gouty legs.\n\n\"I vos married in dat zhips,\" he shouted back, with his ponderous fist\nwagging up at Robin Lyth, \"Dis taime you will have de bad luck, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, mynheer, you have only to pay the difference, and the ketch will\ndo; the bilander sails almost as fast.\"\n\nBut Master Van Dunck only heaved another sigh, and felt that his leather\nbag was safe and full in his breeches pocket. Then he turned his eyes\naway, and relieved his mind by swearing at his men.\n\nNow this was off the Isle of Texel, and the time was Sunday morning, the\nvery same morning which saw the general factor sitting to be preached\nat. The flotilla of free trade was putting forth upon its great emprise,\nand Van Dunck (who had been ship's husband) came to speed them from\ntheir moorings.\n\nHe took no risk, and to him it mattered little, except as a question of\ncommission; but still he enjoyed the relish of breaking English law most\nheartily. He hated England, as a loyal Dutchman, for generations, was\ncompelled to do; and he held that a Dutchman was a better sailor, a\nbetter ship-builder, and a better fighter than the very best Englishman\never born. However, his opinions mattered little, being (as we must\nfeel) absurd. Therefore let him go his way, and grumble, and reckon his\nguilders. It was generally known that he could sink a ship with money;\nand when such a man is insolent, who dares to contradict him?\n\nThe flotilla in the offing soon ploughed hissing furrows through the\nmisty waves. There were three craft, all of different rig--a schooner,\na ketch, and the said bilander. All were laden as heavily as speed and\nsafety would allow, and all were thoroughly well manned. They laid their\ncourse for the Dogger Bank, where they would receive the latest news\nof the disposition of the enemy. Robin Lyth, high admiral of smugglers,\nkept to his favorite schooner, the Glimpse, which had often shown a\nfading wake to fastest cutters. His squadron was made up by the ketch,\nGood Hope, and the old Dutch coaster, Crown of Gold. This vessel, though\nbuilt for peaceful navigation and inland waters, had proved herself so\nthoroughly at home in the roughest situations, and so swift of foot,\nthough round of cheek, that the smugglers gloried in her and the good\nluck which sat upon her prow. They called her \"the lugger,\" though her\nrig was widely different from that, and her due title was \"bilander.\"\nShe was very deeply laden now, and, having great capacity, appeared an\nunusually tempting prize.\n\nThis grand armada of invasion made its way quite leisurely. Off the\nDogger Bank they waited for the last news, and received it, and the\nwhole of it was to their liking, though the fisherman who brought it\nstrongly advised them to put back again. But Captain Lyth had no such\nthought, for the weather was most suitable for the bold scheme he had\nhit upon. \"This is my last run,\" he said, \"and I mean to make it a good\none.\" Then he dressed himself as smartly as if he were going to meet\nMary Anerley, and sent a boat for the skippers of the Good Hope, and the\nCrown of Gold, who came very promptly and held counsel in his cabin.\n\n\"I'm thinking that your notion is a very good one, captain,\" said the\nmaster of the bilander, Brown, a dry old hand from Grimsby.\n\n\"Capital, capital; there never was a better,\" the master of the ketch\nchimed in, \"Nettlebones and Carroway--they will knock their heads\ntogether!\"\n\n\"The plan is clever enough,\" replied Robin, who was free from all\nmock-modesty, \"But you heard what that old Van Dunck said. I wish he had\nnot said it.\"\n\n\"Ten tousan' tuyfels--as the stingy old thief himself says--he might\nhave held his infernal croak. I hate to make sail with a croak astern;\n'tis as bad as a crow on forestay-sail.\"\n\n\"All very fine for you to talk,\" grumbled the man of the bilander to the\nmaster of the ketch; \"but the bad luck is saddled upon me this voyage.\nYou two get the gilgoes, and I the bilboes!\"\n\n\"Brown, none of that!\" Captain Lyth said, quietly, but with a look which\nthe other understood; \"you are not such a fool as you pretend to be. You\nmay get a shot or two fired at you; but what is that to a Grimsby man?\nAnd who will look at you when your hold is broached? Your game is the\neasiest that any man can play--to hold your tongue and run away.\"\n\n\"Brown, you share the profits, don't you see?\" the ketch man went on,\nwhile the other looked glum; \"and what risk do you take for it? Even if\nthey collar you, through your own clumsiness, what is there for them to\ndo? A Grimsby man is a grumbling man, I have heard ever since I was that\nhigh. I'll change berths with you, if you choose, this minute.\"\n\n\"You could never do it,\" said the Grimsby man, with that high contempt\nwhich abounds where he was born--\"a boy like you! I should like to see\nyou try it.\"\n\n\"Remember, both of you,\" said Robin Lyth, \"that you are not here to do\nas you please, but to obey my orders. If the coast-guard quarrel, we do\nnot; and that is why we beat them. You will both do exactly as I have\nlaid it down; and the risk of failure falls on me. The plan is very\nsimple, and can not fail, if you will just try not to think for\nyourselves, which always makes everything go wrong. The only thing you\nhave to think about at all is any sudden change of weather. If a gale\nfrom the east sets in, you both run north, and I come after you. But\nthere will not be any easterly gale for the present week, to my belief;\nalthough I am not quite sure of it.\"\n\n\"Not a sign of it. Wind will hold with sunset, up to next quarter of the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"The time I ha' been on the coast,\" said Brown, \"and to hear the young\nchaps talking over my head! Never you mind how I know, but I'll lay a\nguinea with both of you--easterly gale afore Friday.\"\n\n\"Brown, you may be right,\" said Robin; \"I have had some fear of it, and\nI know that you carry a weather eye. No man under forty can pretend to\nthat. But if it will only hold off till Friday, we shall have the laugh\nof it. And even if it come on, Tom and I shall manage. But you will be\nbadly off in that case, Brown. After all, you are right; the main danger\nis for you.\"\n\nLyth, knowing well how important it was that each man should play his\npart with true good-will, shifted his ground thus to satisfy the other,\nwho was not the man to shrink from peril, but liked to have his share\nacknowledged.\n\n\"Ay, ay, captain, you see clear enough, though Tom here has not got the\ngumption,\" the man of Grimsby answered, with a lofty smile. \"Everybody\nknows pretty well what William Brown is. When there is anything that\nneeds a bit of pluck, it is sure to be put upon old Bill Brown. And\nnever you come across the man, Captain Lyth, as could say that Bill\nBrown was not all there. Now orders is orders, lad. Tip us your latest.\"\n\n\"Then latest orders are to this effect. Toward dusk of night you stand\nin first, a league or more ahead of us, according to the daylight,\nTom to the north of you, and me to the south, just within signaling\ndistance. The Kestrel and Albatross will come to speak the Swordfish off\nRobin Hood's Bay, at that very hour, as we happen to be aware. You sight\nthem, even before they sight you, because you know where to look for\nthem, and you keep a sharper look-out, of course. Not one of them will\nsight us, so far off in the offing. Signal immediately, one, two, or\nthree; and I heartily hope it will be all three. Then you still stand\nin, as if you could not see them; and they begin to laugh, and draw\ninshore; knowing the Inlander as they do, they will hug the cliffs for\nyou to run into their jaws. Tom and I bear off, all sail, never allowing\nthem to sight us. We crack on to the north and south, and by that time\nit will be nearly dark. You still carry on, till they know that you must\nsee them; then 'bout ship, and crowd sail to escape. They give chase,\nand you lead them out to sea, and the longer you carry on, the better.\nThen, as they begin to fore-reach, and threaten to close, you 'bout ship\nagain, as in despair, run under their counters, and stand in for the\nbay. They may fire at you; but it is not very likely, for they would not\nlike to sink such a valuable prize; though nobody else would have much\nfear of that.\"\n\n\"Captain, I laugh at their brass kettle-pots. They may blaze away as\nblue as verdigris. Though an Englishman haven't no right to be shot at,\nonly by a Frenchman.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you hold on, like a Norfolk man, through the thickest\nof the enemy. Nelson is a Norfolk man; and you charge through as he\ndoes. You bear right on, and rig a gangway for the landing, which\nputs them all quite upon the scream. All three cutters race after you\npell-mell, and it is much if they do not run into one another. You take\nthe beach, stem on, with the tide upon the ebb, and by that time it\nought to be getting on for midnight. What to do then, I need not tell\nyou; but make all the stand you can to spare us any hurry. But don't\ngive the knock-down blow if you can help it; the lawyers make such a\npoint of that, from their intimacy with the prize-fighters.\"\n\nClearly perceiving their duty now, these three men braced up loin, and\nsailed to execute the same accordingly. For invaders and defenders were\nby this time in real earnest with their work, and sure alike of having\ndone the very best that could be done. With equal confidence on either\nside, a noble triumph was expected, while the people on the dry land\nshook their heads and were thankful to be out of it. Carroway, in a\nperpetual ferment, gave no peace to any of his men, and never entered\nhis own door; but riding, rowing, or sailing up and down, here and there\nand everywhere, set an example of unflagging zeal, which was largely\nadmired and avoided. And yet he was not the only remarkably active man\nin the neighborhood; for that great fact, and universal factor, Geoffrey\nMordacks, was entirely here. He had not broken the heart of Widow\nPrecious by taking up his quarters at the Thornwick Inn, as she at first\nimagined, but loyally brought himself and his horse to her sign-post\nfor their Sunday dinner. Nor was this all, but he ordered the very best\nbedroom, and the \"coral parlor\"--as he elegantly called the sea-weedy\nroom--gave every child, whether male or female, sixpence of new mintage,\nand created such impression on her widowed heart that he even won the\nprivilege of basting his own duck. Whatever this gentleman did never\nfailed to reflect equal credit on him and itself. But thoroughly well\nas he basted his duck, and efficiently as he consumed it, deeper things\nwere in his mind, and moving with every mouthful. If Captain Carroway\nlabored hard on public and royal service, no less severely did Mordacks\nwork, though his stronger sense of self-duty led him to feed the labor\nbetter. On the Monday morning he had a long and highly interesting talk\nwith the magisterial rector, to whom he set forth certain portions of\nhis purpose, loftily spurning entire concealment, according to the motto\nof his life. \"You see, sir,\" he said, as he rose to depart, \"what I have\ntold you is very important, and in the strictest confidence, of course,\nbecause I never do anything on the sly.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mordacks, you have surprised me,\" answered Dr. Upround; \"though\nI am not so very much wiser at present. I really must congratulate you\nupon your activity, and the impression you create.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir, not at all. It is my manner of doing business, now for\nthirty years or more. Moles and fools, sir, work under-ground, and only\nget traps set for them; I travel entirely above-ground, and go ten miles\nfor their ten inches. My strategy, sir, is simplicity. Nothing puzzles\nrogues so much, because they can not believe it.\"\n\n\"The theory is good; may the practice prove the same! I should be sorry\nto be against you in any case you undertake. In the present matter I am\nwholly with you, so far as I understand what it is. Still, Flamborough\nis a place of great difficulties--\"\n\n\"The greatest difficulty of all would be to fail, as I look at it.\nEspecially with your most valuable aid.\"\n\n\"What little I can do shall be most readily forth-coming. But remember\nthere is many a slip--If you had interfered but one month ago, how much\neasier it might have been!\"\n\n\"Truly. But I have to grope my way; and it is a hard people, as you say,\nto deal with. But I have no fear, sir; I shall overcome all Flamborough,\nunless--unless, what I fear to think of, there should happen to be\nbloodshed.\"\n\n\"There will be none of that, Mr. Mordacks; we are too skillful, and too\ngentle, for anything more than a few cracked crowns.\"\n\n\"Then everything is as it ought to be. But I must be off; I have many\npoints to see to. How I find time for this affair is the wonder.\"\n\n\"But you will not leave us, I suppose, until--until what appears to be\nexpected has happened!\"\n\n\"When I undertake a thing, Dr. Upround, my rule is to go through with\nit. You have promised me the honor of an interview at any time. Good-by,\nsir; and pray give the compliments of Mr. Mordacks to the ladies.\"\n\nWith even more than his usual confidence and high spirits the general\nfactor mounted horse and rode at once to Bridlington, or rather to the\nquay thereof, in search of Lieutenant Carroway. But Carroway was not\nat home, and his poor wife said, with a sigh, that now she had given up\nexpecting him. \"Have no fear, madam; I will bring him back,\" Mordacks\nanswered, as if he already held him by the collar. \"I have very good\nnews, madam, very grand news for him, and you, and all those lovely and\nhighly intelligent children. Place me, madam, under the very deepest\nobligation by allowing these two little dears to take the basket I see\nyonder, and accompany me to that apple stand. I saw there some fruit of\na sort which used to fit my teeth most wonderfully when they were\njust the size of theirs. And here is another little darling, with a\npin-before infinitely too spotless. If you will spare her also, we will\ndo our best to take away that reproach, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, you are much too kind. But to speak of good news does one\ngood. It is so long since there has been any, that I scarcely know how\nto pronounce the words.\"\n\n\"Mistress Carroway, take my word for it, that such a state of things\nshall be shortly of the past. I will bring back Captain Carroway, madam,\nto his sweet and most beautifully situated home, and with tidings which\nshall please you.\"\n\n\"It is kind of you not to tell me the good news now, sir. I shall enjoy\nit so much more, to see my husband hear it. Good-by, and I hope that you\nwill soon be back again.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Mordacks was loading the children with all that they made soft\nmouths at, he observed for the second time three men who appeared to be\ntaking much interest in his doings. They had sauntered aloof while he\ncalled at the cottage, as if they had something to say to him, but would\nkeep it until he had finished there. But they did not come up to him as\nhe expected; and when he had seen the small Carroways home, he rode\nup to ask what they wanted with him. \"Nothing, only this, sir,\" the\nshortest of them answered, while the others pretended not to hear; \"we\nwas told that yon was Smuggler's house, and we thought that your Honor\nwas the famous Captain Lyth.\"\n\n\"If I ever want a man,\" said the general factor, \"to tell a lie with a\nperfect face, I shall come here and look for you, my friend.\" The man\nlooked at him, and smiled, and nodded, as much as to say, \"You might\nget it done worse,\" and then carelessly followed his comrades toward the\nsea. And Mr. Mordacks, riding off with equal jauntiness, cocked his\nhat, and stared at the Priory Church as if he had never seen any such\nbuilding before.\n\n\"I begin to have a very strong suspicion,\" he said to himself as he put\nhis horse along, \"that this is the place where the main attack will be.\nSigns of a well-suppressed activity are manifest to an experienced eye\nlike mine. All the grocers, the bakers, the candlestick-makers, and the\nwomen, who always precede the men, are mightily gathered together. And\nthe men are holding counsel in a milder way. They have got three jugs\nat the old boat-house for the benefit of holloaing in the open air.\nMoreover, the lane inland is scored with a regular market-day of wheels,\nand there is no market this side of the old town. Carroway, vigilant\ncaptain of men, why have you forsaken your domestic hearth? Is it\nthrough jealousy of Nettlebones, and a stern resolve to be ahead of him?\nRobin, my Robin, is a genius in tactics, a very bright Napoleon of free\ntrade. He penetrates the counsels, or, what is more, the feelings,\nof those who camp against him. He means to land this great emprise at\nCaptain Carroway's threshold. True justice on the man for sleeping out\nof his own bed so long! But instead of bowing to the blow, he would\nturn a downright maniac, according to all I hear of him. Well, it is no\nconcern of mine, so long as nobody is killed, which everybody makes such\na fuss about.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nCORDIAL ENJOYMENT\n\n\nThe poise of this great enterprise was hanging largely in the sky, from\nwhich come all things, and to which resolved they are referred again.\nThe sky, to hold an equal balance, or to decline all troublesome\nresponsibility about it, went away, or (to put it more politely) retired\nfrom the scene. Even as nine men out of ten, when a handsome fight is\ntoward, would rather have no opinion on the merits, but abide in their\nbreeches, and there keep their hands till the fist of the victor\nis opened, so at this period the upper firmament nodded a strict\nneutrality. And yet, on the whole, it must have indulged a sneaking\nproclivity toward free trade; otherwise, why should it have been as\nfollows?\n\nNovember now was far advanced; and none but sanguine Britons hoped,\nat least in this part of the world, to know (except from memory and\npredictions of the almanac) whether the sun were round or square, until\nnext Easter-day should come. It was not quite impossible that he\nmight appear at Candlemas, when he is supposed to give a dance, though\nhitherto a strictly private one; but even so, this premature frisk of\nhis were undesirable, if faith in ancient rhyme be any. But putting him\nout of the question, as he had already put himself, the things that\nwere below him, and, from length of practice, manage well to shape\ntheir course without him, were moving now and managing themselves with\nmoderation.\n\nThe tone of the clouds was very mild, and so was the color of the sea. A\ncomely fog involved the day, and a decent mist restrained the night from\nostentatious waste of stars. It was not such very bad weather; but a\ncaptious man might find fault with it, and only a thoroughly cheerful\none could enlarge upon its merits. Plainly enough these might be found\nby anybody having any core of rest inside him, or any gift of turning\nover upon a rigidly neutral side, and considerably outgazing the color\nof his eyes.\n\nCommander Nettlebones was not of poetic, philosophic, or vague mind.\n\"What a ----- fog!\" he exclaimed in the morning; and he used the same\nwords in the afternoon, through a speaking-trumpet, as the two other\ncutters ranged up within hail. This they did very carefully, at the\nappointed rendezvous, toward the fall of the afternoon, and hauled their\nwind under easy sail, shivering in the southwestern breeze.\n\n\"Not half so bad as it was,\" returned Bowler, being of a cheerful mind.\n\"It is lifting every minute, sir. Have you had sight of anything?\"\n\n\"Not a blessed stick, except a fishing-boat. What makes you ask,\nlieutenant?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, as we rounded in, it lifted for a moment, and I saw a craft\nsome two leagues out, standing straight in for us.\"\n\n\"The devil you did! What was she like? and where away, lieutenant?\"\n\n\"A heavy lugger, under all sail, about E.N.E, as near as may be. She is\nstanding for Robin Hood's Bay, I believe. In an hour's time she will be\nupon us, if the weather keeps so thick.\"\n\n\"She may have seen you, and sheered off. Stand straight for her, as\nnigh as you can guess. The fog is lifting, as you say. If you sight her,\nsignal instantly. Lieutenant Donovan, have you heard Bowler's news?\"\n\n\"Sure an' if it wasn't for the fog, I would. Every word of it come to\nme, as clear as seeing.\"\n\n\"Very well. Carry on a little to the south, half a league or so,\nand then stand out, but keep within sound of signal. I shall bear up\npresently. It is clearing every minute, and we must nab them.\"\n\nThe fog began to rise in loops and alleys, with the upward pressure of\nthe evening breeze, which freshened from the land in lines and patches,\naccording to the run of cliff. Here the water darkened with the ruffle\nof the wind, and there it lay quiet, with a glassy shine, or gentle\nshadows of variety. Soon the three cruisers saw one another clearly; and\nthen they all sighted an approaching sail.\n\nThis was a full-bowed vessel, of quaint rig, heavy sheer, and\nextraordinary build--a foreigner clearly, and an ancient one. She\ndiffered from a lugger as widely as a lugger differs from a schooner,\nand her broad spread of canvas combined the features of square and of\nfore-and-aft tackle. But whatever her build or rig might be, she was\ngoing through the water at a strapping pace, heavily laden as she was,\nwith her long yards creaking, and her broad frame croaking, and her deep\nbows driving up the fountains of the sea. Her enormous mainsail upon the\nmizzenmast--or mainmast, for she only carried two--was hung obliquely,\nyet not as a lugger's, slung at one-third of its length, but bent to\na long yard hanging fore and aft, with a long fore-end sloping down to\nmidship. This great sail gave her vast power, when close hauled; and\nshe carried a square sail on the foremast, and a square sail on either\ntopmast.\n\n\"Lord, have mercy! She could run us all down if she tried!\" exclaimed\nCommander Nettlebones; \"and what are my pop-guns against such beam?\"\n\nFor a while the bilander seemed to mean to try it, for she carried on\ntoward the central cruiser as if she had not seen one of them. Then,\nbeautifully handled, she brought to, and was scudding before the wind in\nanother minute, leading them all a brave stern-chase out to sea.\n\n\"It must be that dare-devil Lyth himself,\" Nettlebones said, as the\nSwordfish strained, with all canvas set, but no gain made; \"no other\nfellow in all the world would dare to beard us in this style. I'd lay\nten guineas that Donovan's guns won't go off, if he tries them. Ah, I\nthought so--a fizz, and a stink--trust an Irishman.\"\n\nFor this gallant lieutenant, slanting toward the bows of the flying\nbilander, which he had no hope of fore-reaching, trained his long\nswivel-gun upon her, and let go--or rather tried to let go--at her. But\nhis powder was wet, or else there was some stoppage; for the only result\nwas a spurt of smoke inward, and a powdery eruption on his own red\ncheeks.\n\n\"I wish I could have heard him swear,\" grumbled Nettlebones; \"that would\nhave been worth something. But Bowler is further out. Bowler will cross\nher bows, and he is not a fool. Don't be in a hurry, my fine Bob Lyth.\nYou are not clear yet, though you crack on like a trooper. Well done,\nBowler, you have headed him! By Jove, I don't understand these tactics.\nStand by there! She is running back again.\"\n\nTo the great amazement of all on board the cruisers, except perhaps\none or two, the great Dutch vessel, which might haply have escaped by\nstanding on her present course, spun round like a top, and bore in again\namong her three pursuers. She had the heels of all of them before the\nwind, and might have run down any intercepter, but seemed not to know\nit, or to lose all nerve. \"Thank the Lord in heaven, all rogues are\nfools! She may double as she will, but she is ours now. Signal Albatross\nand Kestrel to stand in.\"\n\nIn a few minutes all four were standing for the bay; the Dutch vessel\nleading with all sail set, the cruisers following warily, and spreading,\nto head her from the north or south. It was plain that they had her well\nin the toils; she must either surrender or run ashore; close hauled as\nshe was, she could not run them down, even if she would dream of such an\noutrage.\n\nSo far from showing any sign of rudeness was the smuggling vessel, that\nshe would not even plead want of light as excuse for want of courtesy.\nFor running past the royal cutters, who took much longer to come about,\nshe saluted each of them with deep respect for the swallowtail of his\nMajesty. And then she bore on, like the admiral's ship, with signal for\nall to follow her.\n\n\"Such cursed impudence never did I see,\" cried every one of the revenue\nskippers, as they all were compelled to obey her. \"Surrender she must,\nor else run upon the rocks. Does the fool know what he is driving at?\"\n\nThe fool, who was Master James Brown of Grimsby, knew very well what\nhe was about. Every shoal, and sounding, and rocky gut, was thoroughly\nfamiliar to him, and the spread of faint light on the waves and\nalongshore told him all his bearings. The loud cackle of laughter, which\nGrimsby men (at the cost of the rest of the world) enjoy, was carried by\nthe wind to the ears of Nettlebones.\n\nThe latter set fast his teeth, and ground them; for now in the rising\nof the large full moon he perceived that the beach of the cove was black\nwith figures gathering rapidly. \"I see the villain's game; it is all\nclear now,\" he shouted, as he slammed his spy-glass. \"He means to run in\nwhere we dare not follow: and he knows that Carroway is out of hail. The\nhull may go smash for the sake of the cargo; and his flat-bottomed tub\ncan run where we can not. I dare not carry after him--court-martial if I\ndo: that is where those fellows beat us always. But, by the Lord Harry,\nhe shall not prevail! Guns are no good--the rogue knows that. We will\nland round the point, and nab him.\"\n\nBy this time the moon was beginning to open the clouds, and strew the\nwaves with light; and the vapors, which had lain across the day, defying\nall power of sun ray, were gracefully yielding, and departing softly, at\nthe insinuating whisper of the gliding night. Between the busy rolling\nof the distant waves, and the shining prominence of forward cliffs, a\nquiet space was left for ships to sail in, and for men to show activity\nin shooting one another. And some of these were hurrying to do so, if\nthey could.\n\n\"There is little chance of hitting them in this bad light; but let them\nhave it, Jakins; and a guinea for you, if you can only bring that big\nmainsail down.\"\n\nThe gunner was yearning for this, and the bellow of his piece responded\nto the captain's words. But the shot only threw up a long path of\nfountains, and the bilander ploughed on as merrily as before.\n\n\"Hard aport! By the Lord, I felt her touch! Go about! So, so--easy!\nNow lie to, for Kestrel and Albatross to join. My certy! but that was a\nnarrow shave. How the beggar would have laughed if we had grounded!\nGive them another shot. It will do the gun good; she wants a little\nexercise.\"\n\nNothing loath was master gunner, as the other bow-gun came into bearing,\nto make a little more noise in the world, and possibly produce a greater\neffect. And therein he must have had a grand success, and established a\nnoble reputation, by carrying off a great Grimsby head, if he only had\nattended to a little matter. Gunner Jakins was a celebrated shot, and\nthe miss he had made stirred him up to shoot again. If the other gun was\ncrooked, this one should be straight; and dark as it was inshore, he\ngot a patch of white ground to sight by. The bilander was a good sizable\nobject, and not to hit her anywhere would be too bad. He considered\nthese things carefully, and cocked both eyes, with a twinkling ambiguity\nbetween them; then trusting mainly to the left one, as an ancient gunner\nfor the most part does, he watched the due moment, and fired. The smoke\ncurled over the sea, and so did the Dutchman's maintop-sail, for the\nmast beneath it was cut clean through. Some of the crew were frightened,\nas may be the bravest man when for the first time shot at; but James\nBrown rubbed his horny hands.\n\n\"Now this is a good judgment for that younker Robin Lyth,\" he shouted\naloud, with the glory of a man who has verified his own opinions. \"He\nputs all the danger upon his elders, and tells them there is none of\nit. A' might just as well have been my head, if a wave hadn't lifted the\nmuzzle when that straight-eyed chap let fire. Bear a hand, boys, and cut\naway the wreck. He hathn't got never another shot to send. He hath saved\nus trouble o' shortening that there canvas. We don't need too much way\non her.\"\n\nThis was true enough, as all hands knew; for the craft was bound to take\nthe beach, without going to pieces yet awhile. Jem Brown stood at the\nwheel himself, and carried her in with consummate skill.\n\n\"It goeth to my heart to throw away good stuff,\" he grumbled at almost\nevery creak. \"Two hunder pound I would 'a paid myself for this here\npiece of timber. Steady as a light-house, and as handy as a mop; but\nwhat do they young fellows care? There, now, my lads, hold your legs a\nmoment; and now make your best of that.\"\n\n\"With a crash, and a grating, and a long sad grind, the nuptial ark of\nthe wealthy Dutchman cast herself into her last bed and berth.\n\n\"I done it right well,\" said the Grimsby man.\n\nThe poor old bilander had made herself such a hole in the shingle that\nshe rolled no more, but only lifted at the stern and groaned, as the\nquiet waves swept under her. The beach was swarming with men, who gave\nher a cheer, and flung their hats up; and in two or three minutes as\nmany gangways of timber and rope were rigged to her hawse-holes, or\nfore-chains, or almost anywhere. And then the rolling of puncheons\nbegan, and the hoisting of bales, and the thump and the creak, and the\nlaughter, and the swearing.\n\n\"Now be you partiklar, uncommon partiklar; never start a stave nor fray\na bale. Powerful precious stuff this time. Gold every bit of it, if it\nare a penny. They blessed coast-riders will be on us round the point.\nBut never you hurry, lads, the more for that. Better a'most to let 'em\nhave it, than damage a drop or a thread of such goods.\"\n\n\"All right, Cappen Brown. Don't you be so wonnerful unaisy. Not the\nfirst time we have handled such stuff.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" replied Brown, as he lit a short pipe and\nbegan to puff. \"I've a-run some afore, but never none so precious.\"\n\nThen the men of the coast and the sailors worked with a will, by the\nbroad light of the moon, which showed their brawny arms and panting\nchests, with the hoisting, and the heaving, and the rolling. In less\nthan an hour three-fourths of the cargo was landed, and some already\nstowed inland, where no Preventive eye could penetrate. Then Captain\nBrown put away his pipe, and was busy, in a dark empty part of the hold,\nwith some barrels of his own, which he covered with a sailcloth.\n\nPresently the tramp of marching men was heard in a lane on the north\nside of the cove, and then the like sound echoed from the south. \"Now\nnever you hurry,\" said the Grimsby man. The others, however, could not\nattain such standard of equanimity. They fell into sudden confusion,\nand babble of tongues, and hesitation--everybody longing to be off,\nbut nobody liking to run without something good. And to get away with\nanything at all substantial, even in the dark, was difficult, because\nthere were cliffs in front, and the flanks would be stopped by men with\ncutlasses.\n\n\"Ston' you still,\" cried Captain Brown; \"never you budge, ne'er a one\nof ye. I stands upon my legitimacy; and I answer for the consekence. I\ntakes all responsibility.\"\n\nLike all honest Britons, they loved long words, and they knew that if\nthe worst came to the worst, a mere broken head or two would make all\nstraight; so they huddled together in the moonlight waiting, and no\none desired to be the outside man. And while they were striving for\nprecedence toward the middle, the coast-guards from either side marched\nupon them, according to their very best drill and in high discipline, to\nknock down almost any man with the pommel of the sword.\n\nBut the smugglers also showed high discipline under the commanding voice\nof Captain Brown.\n\n\"Every man ston' with his hands to his sides, and ask of they sojjers\nfor a pinch of bacca.\"\n\nThis made them laugh, till Captain Nettlebones strode up.\n\n\"In the name of his Majesty, surrender, all you fellows. You are fairly\ncaught in the very act of landing a large run of goods contraband. It is\nhigh time to make an example of you. Where is your skipper, lads? Robin\nLyth, come forth.\"\n\n\"May it please your good honor and his Majesty's commission,\" said\nBrown, in his full, round voice, as he walked down the broadest of\nthe gangways leisurely, \"my name is not Robin Lyth, but James Brown, a\nfamily man of Grimsby, and an honest trader upon the high seas. My cargo\nis medical water and rags, mainly for the use of the revenue men, by\nreason they han't had their new uniforms this twelve months.\"\n\nSeveral of the enemy began to giggle, for their winter supply of clothes\nhad failed, through some lapse of the department. But Nettlebones\nmarched up, and collared Captain Brown, and said, \"You are my prisoner,\nsir. Surrender, Robin Lyth, this moment.\" Brown made no resistance, but\nrespectfully touched his hat, and thought.\n\n\"I were trying to call upon my memory,\" he said, as the revenue officer\nled him aside, and promised him that he should get off easily if he\nwould only give up his chief. \"I am not going to deny, your honor, that\nI have heard tell of that name 'Robin Lyth.' But my memory never do come\nin a moment. Now were he a man in the contraband line?\"\n\n\"Brown, you want to provoke me. It will only be ten times worse for you.\nNow give him up like an honest fellow, and I will do my best for you. I\nmight even let a few tubs slip by.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am a stranger round these parts; and the lingo is beyond me.\nTubs is a bucket as the women use for washing. Never I heared of any\nother sort of tubs. But my mate he knoweth more of Yorkshire talk. Jack,\nhere his honor is a-speaking about tubs; ever you hear of tubs, Jack?\"\n\n\"Make the villain fast to yonder mooring-post,\" shouted Nettlebones,\nlosing his temper; \"and one of you stand by him, with a hanger ready.\nNow, Master Brown, we'll see what tubs are, if you please; and what sort\nof rags you land at night. One chance more for you--will you give up\nRobin Lyth?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, that I will, without two thoughts about 'un. Only too happy,\nas the young women say, to give 'un up, quick stick--so soon as ever I\nha' got 'un.\"\n\n\"If ever there was a contumacious rogue! Roll up a couple of those\npuncheons, Mr. Avery; and now light half a dozen links. Have you got\nyour spigot-heels--and rummers? Very good; Lieutenant Donovan, Mr.\nAvery, and Senior Volunteer Brett, oblige me by standing by to verify.\nGentlemen, we will endeavor to hold what is judicially called an\nassay--a proof of the purity of substances. The brand on these casks\nis of the very highest order--the renowned Mynheer Van Dunck himself.\nDonovan, you shall be our foreman; I have heard you say that you\nunderstood ardent spirits from your birth.\"\n\n\"Faix, and I quite forget, commander, whether I was weaned on or off of\nthem. But the foine judge me father was come down till me--honey, don't\nbe narvous; slope it well, then--a little thick, is it? All the\nricher for that same, me boy. Commander, here's the good health of his\nMajesty--Oh Lord!\"\n\nMr. Corkoran Donovan fell down upon the shingle, and rolled and\nbellowed: \"Sure me inside's out! 'Tis poisoned I am, every mortial\nbit o' me. A docthor, a docthor, and a praste, to kill me! That ever\nI should live to die like this! Ochone, ochone, every bit of me; to be\nbrought forth upon good whiskey, and go out of the world upon docthor's\nstuff!\"\n\n\"Most folk does that, when they ought to turn ends t'otherwise.\" James\nBrown of Grimsby could see how things were going, though his power to\naid was restricted by a double turn of rope around him; but a kind\nhand had given him a pipe, and his manner was to take things easily.\n\"Commander, or captain, or whatever you be, with your king's clothes,\nconstructing a hole in they flints, never you fear, sir. 'Tis medical\nwater, and your own wife wouldn't know you to-morrow. Your complexion\nwill be like a hangel's.\"\n\n\"You d----d rogue,\" cried Nettlebones, striding up, with his sword\nflashing in the link-lights, \"if ever I had a mind to cut any man\ndown--\"\n\n\"Well, sir, do it, then, upon a roped man, if the honor of the British\nnavy calleth for it. My will is made, and my widow will have action; and\nthe executioner of my will is a Grimsby man, with a pile of money made\nin the line of salt fish, and such like.\"\n\n\"Brown, you are a brave man. I would scorn to harm you. Now, upon your\nhonor, are all your puncheons filled with that stuff, and nothing else?\"\n\n\"Upon my word of honor, sir, they are. Some a little weaker, some with\nmore bilge-water in it, or a trifle of a dash from the midden. The main\nof it, however, in the very same condition as a' bubbleth out of what\nthey call the spawses. Why, captain, you must 'a lived long enough to\nknow, partiklar if gifted with a family, that no sort of spirit as were\never stilled will fetch so much money by the gallon, duty paid, as the\ndoctor's stuff doth by the phial-bottle.\"\n\n\"That is true enough; but no lies, Brown, particularly when upon your\nhonor! If you were importing doctor's stuff, why did you lead us such a\ndance, and stand fire?\"\n\n\"Well, your honor, you must promise not to be offended, if I tell you\nof a little mistake we made. We heared a sight of talk about some pirate\ncraft as hoisteth his Majesty's flag upon their villainy. And when first\nyou come up, in the dusk of the night--\"\n\n\"You are the most impudent rogue I ever saw. Show your bills of lading,\nsir. You know his Majesty's revenue cruisers as well as I know your\nsmuggling tub.\"\n\n\"Ship's papers are aboard of her, all correct, sir. Keys at your\nservice, if you please to feel my pocket, objecting to let my hands\nloose.\"\n\n\"Very well, I must go on board of her, and test a few of your puncheons\nand bales, Master Brown. Locker in the master's own cabin, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, plain as can be, on the starboard side, just behind the cabin\ndoor. Only your honor must be smart about it; the time-fuse can't 'a got\nthree inches left.\"\n\n\"Time-fuse? What do you mean, you Grimsby villain?\"\n\n\"Nothing, commander, but to keep you out of mischief. When we were\ncompelled to beach the old craft, for fear of them scoundrelly pirates,\nit came into my head what a pity it would be to have her used illegal;\nfor she do outsail a'most everything, as your honor can bear witness.\nSo I just laid a half-hour fuse to three big-powder barrels as is down\nthere in the hold; and I expect to see a blow-up almost every moment.\nBut your honor might be in time yet, with a run, and good luck to your\nfoot, you might--\"\n\n\"Back, lads! back every one of you this moment!\" The first concern of\nNettlebones was rightly for his men. \"Under the cliff here. Keep well\nback. Push out those smuggler fellows into the middle. Let them have the\nbenefit of their own inventions, and this impudent Brown the foremost.\nThey have laid a train to their powder barrels, and the lugger will blow\nup any moment.\"\n\n\"No fear for me, commander,\" James Brown shouted through the hurry and\njostle of a hundred runaways. \"More fear for that poor man as lieth\nthere a-lurching. She won't hit me when she bloweth up, no more than\nyour honor could. But surely your duty demandeth of you to board the old\nbilander, and take samples.\"\n\n\"Sample enough of you, my friend. But I haven't quite done with you yet.\nSimpson, here, bear a hand with poor Lieutenant Donovan.\"\n\nNettlebones set a good example by lifting the prostrate Irishman;\nand they bore him into safety, and drew up there; while the beachmen,\nforbidden the shelter at point of cutlass, made off right and left; and\nthen, with a crash that shook the strand and drove back the water in\na white turmoil, the Crown of Gold flew into a fount of timbers,\nsplinters, shreds, smoke, fire, and dust.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you may come out of your holes,\" the Grimsby man shouted\nfrom his mooring-post, as the echoes ran along the cliffs, and rolled to\nand fro in the distance. \"My old woman will miss a piece of my pigtail,\nbut she hathn't hurt her old skipper else. She blowed up handsome, and\nno mistake! No more danger, gentlemen, and plenty of stuff to pick up\nafore next pay-day.\"\n\n\"What shall we do with that insolent hound?\" Nettlebones asked poor\nDonovan, who was groaning in slow convalescence. \"We have caught him in\nnothing. We can not commit him; we can not even duck him legally.\"\n\n\"Be jabers, let him drink his health in his own potheen.\"\n\n\"Capital! Bravo for old Ireland, my friend! You shall see it done, and\nhandsomely. Brown, you recommend these waters, so you shall have a dose\nof them.\"\n\nA piece of old truncate kelp was found, as good a drinking horn as need\nbe; and with this Captain Brown was forced to swallow half a bucketful\nof his own \"medical water\"; and they left him fast at his moorings, to\nreflect upon this form of importation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nBEARDED IN HIS DEN\n\n\n\"What do you think of it by this time, Bowler?\" Commander Nettlebones\nasked his second, who had been left in command afloat, and to whom they\nrowed back in a wrathful mood, with a good deal of impression that the\nfault was his, \"You have been taking it easily out here. What do you\nthink of the whole of it?\"\n\n\"I have simply obeyed your orders, sir; and if I am to be blamed for\nthat, I had better offer no opinion.\"\n\n\"No, no, I am finding no fault with you. Don't be so tetchy, Bowler. I\nseek your opinion, and you are bound to give it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, sir, my opinion is that they have made fools of the lot of\nus, excepting, of course, my superior officer.\"\n\n\"You think so, Bowler? Well, and so do I--and myself the biggest fool of\nany. They have charged our centre with a dummy cargo, while they run the\nreal stuff far on either flank. Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"To a nicety, that is my opinion, now that you put it so clearly, sir.\"\n\n\"The trick is a clumsy one, and never should succeed. Carroway ought\nto catch one lot, if he has a haporth of sense in him. What is the time\nnow; and how is the wind?\"\n\n\"I hear a church clock striking twelve; and by the moon it must be that.\nThe wind is still from the shore, but veering, and I felt a flaw from\nthe east just now.\"\n\n\"If the wind works round, our turn will come. Is Donovan fit for duty\nyet?\"\n\n\"Ten times fit, sir--to use his own expression. He is burning to have at\nsomebody. His eyes work about like the binnacle's card.\"\n\n\"Then board him, and order him to make all sail for Burlington, and\nsee what old Carroway is up to. You be off for Whitby, and as far as\nTeesmouth, looking into every cove you pass. I shall stand off and on\nfrom this to Scarborough, and as far as Filey. Short measures, mind,\nif you come across them. If I nab that fellow Lyth, I shall go near to\nhanging him as a felon outlaw. His trick is a little too outrageous.\"\n\n\"No fear, commander. If it is as we suppose, it is high time to make a\nstrong example.\"\n\nHours had been lost, as the captains of the cruisers knew too well\nby this time. Robin Lyth's stratagem had duped them all, while the\ncontraband cargoes might be landed safely, at either extremity of their\nheat. By the aid of the fishing-boats, he had learned their manoeuvres\nclearly, and outmanoeuvred them.\n\nNow it would have been better for him, perhaps, to have been content\nwith a lesser triumph, and to run his own schooner, the Glimpse, further\nsouth, toward Hornsea, or even Aldbrough. Nothing, however, would\nsatisfy him but to land his fine cargo at Carroway's own door--a piece\nof downright insolence, for which he paid out most bitterly. A man\nof his courage and lofty fame should have been above such vindictive\nfeelings. But, as it was, he cherished and, alas! indulged a certain\nsmall grudge against the bold lieutenant, scarcely so much for\nendeavoring to shoot him, as for entrapping him at Byrsa Cottage, during\nthe very sweetest moment of his life. \"You broke in disgracefully,\" said\nthe smuggler to himself, \"upon my privacy when it should have been most\nsacred. The least thing I can do is to return your visit, and pay my\nrespects to Mrs. Carroway and your interesting family.\"\n\nLittle expecting such a courtesy as this, the vigilant officer was\nhurrying about, here, there, and almost everywhere (except in the right\ndirection), at one time by pinnace, at another upon horseback, or on his\nunwearied though unequal feet. He carried his sword in one hand, and his\nspy-glass in the other, and at every fog he swore so hard that he\nseemed to turn it yellow. With his heart worn almost into holes, as\nan overmangled quilt is, by burdensome roll of perpetual lies, he\ncondemned, with a round mouth, smugglers, cutters, the coast-guard and\nthe coast itself, the weather, and, with a deeper depth of condemnation,\nthe farmers, landladies, and fishermen. For all of these verily seemed\nto be in league to play him the game which school-boys play with a\ngentle-faced new-comer--the game of \"send the fool further.\"\n\nJohn Gristhorp, of the \"Ship Inn,\" at Filey, had turned out his\nvisitors, barred his door, and was counting his money by the fireside,\nwith his wife grumbling at him for such late hours as half past ten of\nthe clock in the bar, that night when the poor bilander ended her long\ncareer as aforesaid. Then a thundering knock at the door just fastened\nmade him upset a little pyramid of pence, and catch up the iron\ncandlestick.\n\n\"None of your roistering here!\" cried the lady. \"John, you know better\nthan to let them in, I hope.\"\n\n\"Copper coomth by daa, goold coomth t'naight-time,\" the sturdy publican\nanswered, though resolved to learn who it was before unbarring.\n\n\"In the name of the King, undo this door,\" a deep stern voice resounded,\n\"or by royal command we make splinters of it.\"\n\n\"It is that horrible Carroway again,\" whispered Mrs. Gristhorp. \"Much\ngold comes of him, I doubt. Let him in if you dare, John.\"\n\n\"'Keep ma oot, if ye de-arr,' saith he. Ah'll awand here's the tail o'\nit.\"\n\nWhile Gristhorp, in wholesome fealty to his wife, was doubting, the door\nflew open, and in marched Carroway and all his men, or at least all save\none of his present following. He had ordered his pinnace to meet him\nhere, himself having ridden from Scarborough, and the pinnace had\nbrought the jolly-boat in tow, according to his directions. The men had\nlanded with the jolly-boat, which was handier for beach work, leaving\none of their number to mind the larger craft while they should refresh\nthemselves. They were nine in all, and Carroway himself the tenth, all\nsturdy fellows, and for the main of it tolerably honest; Cadman, Ellis,\nand Dick Hackerbody, and one more man from Bridlington, the rest a\nre-enforcement from Spurn Head, called up for occasion.\n\n\"Landlord, produce your best, and quickly,\" the officer said, as he\nthrew himself into the arm-chair of state, being thoroughly tired. \"In\none hour's time we must be off. Therefore, John, bring nothing tough,\nfor our stomachs are better than our teeth. A shilling per head is his\nMajesty's price, and half a crown for officers. Now a gallon of ale, to\nbegin with.\"\n\nGristhorp, being a prudent man, brought the very toughest parts of\nhis larder forth, with his wife giving nudge to his elbow. All, and\nespecially Carroway, too hungry for nice criticism, fell to, by the\nlight of three tallow candles, and were just getting into the heart of\nit, when the rattle of horseshoes on the pitch-stones shook the long\nlow window, and a little boy came staggering in, with scanty breath, and\ndazzled eyes, and a long face pale with hurrying so.\n\n\"Why, Tom, my boy!\" the lieutenant cried, jumping up so suddenly that\nhe overturned the little table at which he was feeding by himself, to\npreserve the proper discipline. \"Tom, my darling, what has brought you\nhere? Anything wrong with your mother?\"\n\n\"Nobody wouldn't come, but me,\" Carroway's eldest son began to gasp,\nwith his mouth full of crying; \"and I borrowed Butcher Hewson's pony,\nand he's going to charge five shillings for it.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. We shall not have to pay it. But what is it all about,\nmy son?\"\n\n\"About the men that are landing the things, just opposite our front\ndoor, father. They have got seven carts, and a wagon with three horses,\nand one of the horses is three colors; and ever so many ponies, more\nthan you could count.\"\n\n\"Well, then, may I be forever\"--here the lieutenant used an expression\nwhich not only was in breach of the third commandment, but might lead\nhis son to think less of the fifth--\"if it isn't more than I can bear!\nTo be running a cargo at my own hall door!\" He had a passage large\nenough to hang three hats in, which the lady of the house always called\n\"the hall.\" \"Very well, very good, very fine indeed! You sons of\"--an\nanimal that is not yet accounted the mother of the human race--\"have you\ndone guzzling and swizzling?\"\n\nThe men who were new to his orders jumped up, for they liked his\nexpressions, by way of a change; but the Bridlington squad stuck to\ntheir trenchers. \"Ready in five minutes, sir,\" said Cadman, with a\nglance neither loving nor respectful.\n\n\"If ever there was an old hog for the trough, the name of him is John\nCadman. In ten minutes, lads, we must all be afloat.\"\n\n\"One more against you,\" muttered Cadman; and a shrewd quiet man from\nSpurn Head, Adam Andrews, heard him, and took heed of him.\n\nWhile the men of the coast-guard were hurrying down to make ready the\njolly-boat and hail the pinnace, Carroway stopped to pay the score, and\nto give his son some beer and meat. The thirsty little fellow drained\nhis cup, and filled his mouth and both hands with food, while the\nlandlady picked out the best bits for him.\n\n\"Don't talk, my son--don't try to talk,\" said Carroway, looking proudly\nat him, while the boy was struggling to tell his adventures, without\nloss of feeding-time; \"you are a chip of the old block, Tom, for\nvictualling, and for riding too. Kind madam, you never saw such a boy\nbefore. Mark my words, he will do more in the world than ever his father\ndid, and his father was pretty well known in his time, in the Royal\nNavy, ma'am. To have stuck to his horse all that way in the dark was\nwonderful, perfectly wonderful. And the horse blows more than the rider,\nma'am, which is quite beyond my experience. Now, Tom, ride home very\ncarefully and slowly, if you feel quite equal to it. The Lord has\nwatched over you, and He will continue, as He does with brave folk that\ndo their duty. Half a crown you shall have, all for yourself, and the\nsixpenny boat that you longed for in the shops. Keep out of the way of\nthe smugglers, Tom; don't let them even clap eyes on you. Kiss me, my\nson; I am proud of you.\"\n\nLittle Tom long remembered this; and his mother cried over it hundreds\nof times.\n\nAlthough it was getting on for midnight now, Master Gristhorp and his\nwife came out into the road before their house, to see the departure of\ntheir guests. And this they could do well, because the moon had cleared\nall the fog away, and was standing in a good part of the sky for\nthrowing clear light upon Filey. Along the uncovered ridge of shore,\nwhich served for a road, and was better than a road, the boy and the\npony grew smaller; while upon the silvery sea the same thing happened to\nthe pinnace, with her white sails bending, and her six oars glistening.\n\n\"The world goeth up, and the world goeth down,\" said the lady, with her\narms akimbo; \"and the moon goeth over the whole of us, John; but to my\nheart I do pity poor folk as canna count the time to have the sniff of\ntheir own blankets.\"\n\n\"Margery, I loikes the moon, as young as ever ye da. But I sooner see\nthe snuff of our own taller, a-going out, fra the bed-curtings.\"\n\nShaking their heads with concrete wisdom, they managed to bar the door\nagain, and blessing their stars that they did not often want them, took\nshelter beneath the quiet canopy of bed. And when they heard by-and-by\nwhat had happened, it cost them a week apiece to believe it; because\nwith their own eyes they had seen everything so peaceable, and had such\na good night afterward.\n\nWhen a thing is least expected, then it loves to come to pass, and then\nit is enjoyed the most, whatever good there is of it. After the fog and\nthe slur of the day, to see the sky at all was joyful, although there\nwas but a white moon upon it, and faint stars gliding hazily. And it was\na great point for every man to be satisfied as to where he was; because\nthat helps him vastly toward being satisfied to be there. The men in the\npinnace could see exactly where they were in this world; and as to the\nother world, their place was fixed--if discipline be an abiding gift--by\nthe stern precision of their commander in ordering the lot of them to\nthe devil. They carried all sail, and they pulled six oars, and the wind\nand sea ran after them.\n\n\"Ha! I see something!\" Carroway cried, after a league or more of\nswearing. \"Dick, the night glass; my eyes are sore. What do you make her\nout for?\"\n\n\"Sir, she is the Spurn Head yawl,\" answered Dick Hackerbody, who was\nfamed for long sight, but could see nothing with a telescope. \"I can see\nthe patch of her foresail.\"\n\n\"She is looking for us. We are the wrong way of the moon. Ship oars,\nlads; bear up for her.\"\n\nIn ten minutes' time the two boats came to speaking distance off Bempton\nCliffs, and the windmill, that vexed Willie Anerley so, looked bare\nand black on the highland. There were only two men in the Spurn Head\nboat--not half enough to manage her. \"Well, what is it?\" shouted\nCarroway.\n\n\"Robin Lyth has made his land-fall on Burlington Sands, opposite your\nhonor's door, sir. There was only two of us to stop him, and the man as\nis deaf and dumb.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Carroway, too wroth to swear. \"My boy of eight years\nold is worth the entire boiling of you. You got into a rabbit-hole, and\nran to tell your mammy.\"\n\n\"Captain, I never had no mammy,\" the other man answered, with his\nfeelings hurt. \"I come to tell you, sir; and something, if you please,\nfor your own ear, if agreeable.\"\n\n\"Nothing is agreeable. But let me have it. Hold on; I will come aboard\nof you.\"\n\nThe lieutenant stepped into the Spurn Head boat with confident activity,\nand ordered his own to haul off a little, while the stranger bent down\nto him in the stern, and whispered.\n\n\"Now are you quite certain of this?\" asked Carroway, with his grim face\nglowing in the moonlight, \"I have had such a heap of cock and bulls\nabout it. Morcom, are you certain?\"\n\n\"As certain, sir, as that I stand here, and you sit there, commander.\nPut me under guard, with a pistol to my ear, and shoot me if it turns\nout to be a lie.\"\n\n\"The Dovecote, you say? You are quite sure of that, and not the Kirk\nCave, or Lyth's Hole?\"\n\n\"Sir, the Dovecote, and no other. I had it from my own young brother,\nwho has been cheated of his share. And I know it from my own eyes too.\"\n\n\"Then, by the Lord in heaven, Morcom, I shall have my revenge at last;\nand I shall not stand upon niceties. If I call for the jolly-boat, you\nstep in. I doubt if either of these will enter.\"\n\nIt was more than a fortnight since the lieutenant had received the\nattentions of a barber, and when he returned to his own boat, and\nchanged her course inshore, he looked most bristly even in the\nmoonlight. The sea and the moon between them gave quite light enough to\nshow how gaunt he was--the aspect of a man who can not thrive without\nhis children to make play, and his wife to do cookery for him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTHE DOVECOTE\n\n\nWith the tiller in his hand, the brave lieutenant meditated sadly. There\nwas plenty of time for thought before quick action would be needed,\nalthough the Dovecote was so near that no boat could come out of it\nunseen. For the pinnace was fetching a circuit, so as to escape the eyes\nof any sentinel, if such there should be at the mouth of the cavern, and\nto come upon the inlet suddenly. And the two other revenue boats were in\nher wake.\n\nThe wind was slowly veering toward the east, as the Grimsby man had\npredicted, with no sign of any storm as yet, but rather a prospect of\nwinterly weather, and a breeze to bring the woodcocks in. The gentle\nrise and fall of waves, or rather, perhaps, of the tidal flow, was\ncheckered and veined with a ripple of the slanting breeze, and twinkled\nin the moonbeams. For the moon was brightly mounting toward her zenith,\nand casting bastions of rugged cliff in gloomy largeness on the mirror\nof the sea. Hugging these as closely as their peril would allow,\nCarroway ordered silence, and with the sense of coming danger thought:\n\n\"Probably I shall kill this man. He will scarcely be taken alive, I\nfear. He is as brave as myself, or braver; and in his place I would\nnever yield. If he were a Frenchman, it would be all right. But I hate\nto kill a gallant Englishman. And such a pretty girl, and a good girl\ntoo, loves him with all her heart, I know. And that good old couple who\ndepend upon him, and who have had such shocking luck themselves! He has\nbeen a bitter plague to me, and often I have longed to strike him down.\nBut to-night--I can not tell why it is--I wish there were some way\nout of it. God knows that I would give up the money, and give up my\nthief-catching business too, if the honor of the service let me. But\nduty drives me; do it I must. And after all, what is life to a man who\nis young, and has no children? Better over, better done with, before\nthe troubles and the disappointment come, the weariness, and the loss of\npower, and the sense of growing old, and seeing the little ones hungry.\nLife is such a fleeting vapor--I smell some man sucking peppermint! The\nsmell of it goes on the wind for a mile. Oh! Cadman again, as usual.\nPeppermint in the Royal Coast-Guard! Away with it, you ancient beldame!\"\n\nMuttering something about his bad tooth, the man flung his lozenge away;\nand his eyes flashed fire in the moonlight, while the rest grinned a low\ngrin at him. And Adam Andrews, sitting next him, saw him lay hands upon\nhis musketoon.\n\n\"Are your firelocks all primed, my lads?\" the commander asked, quite as\nif he had seen him, although he had not been noticing; and the foremost\nto answer \"Ay, ay, sir,\" was Cadman.\n\n\"Then be sure that you fire not, except at my command. We will take them\nwithout shedding blood, if it may be. But happen what will, we must have\nLyth.\"\n\nWith these words, Carroway drew his sword, and laid it on the bench\nbeside him; and the rest (who would rather use steel than powder) felt\nthat their hangers were ready. Few of them wished to strike at all;\nfor vexed as they were with the smugglers for having outwitted them\nso often, as yet there was no bad blood between them, such as must be\nquenched with death. And some of them had friends, and even relatives,\namong the large body of free-traders, and counted it too likely that\nthey might be here.\n\nMeanwhile in the cave there was rare work going on, speedily, cleverly,\nand with a merry noise. There was only one boat, with a crew of six men,\nbesides Robin Lyth the captain; but the six men made noise enough for\ntwelve, and the echoes made it into twice enough for any twenty-four.\nThe crew were trusty, hardy fellows, who liked their joke, and could\nwork with it; and Robin Lyth knew them too well to attempt any high\nauthority of gagging. The main of their cargo was landed and gone\ninland, as snugly as need be; and having kept beautifully sober over\nthat, they were taking the liberty of beginning to say, or rather sip,\nthe grace of the fine indulgence due to them.\n\nPleasant times make pleasant scenes, and everything now was fair\nand large in this happy cave of freedom. Lights of bright resin were\nburning, with strong flare and fume, upon shelves of rock; dark water\nsoftly went lapping round the sides, having dropped all rude habits at\nthe entrance; and a pulse of quiet rise and fall opened, and spread to\nthe discovery of light, tremulous fronds and fans of kelp. The cavern,\nexpanding and mounting from the long narrow gut of its inlet, shone with\nstaves of snowy crag wherever the scour of the tide ran round;\nbulged and scooped, or peaked and fissured, and sometimes beautifully\nsculptured by the pliant tools of water. Above the tide-reach darker\nhues prevailed, and more jagged outline, tufted here and there with\nyellow, where the lichen freckles spread. And the vault was framed of\nmountain fabric, massed with ponderous gray slabs.\n\nAll below was limpid water, or at any rate not very muddy, but as bright\nas need be for the time of year, and a sea which is not tropical. No one\nmay hope to see the bottom through ten feet of water on the Yorkshire\ncoast, toward the end of the month of November; but still it tries to\nlook clear upon occasion; and here in the caves it settles down, after\neven a week free from churning. And perhaps the fog outside had helped\nit to look clearer inside; for the larger world has a share of the\nspirit of contrariety intensified in man.\n\nBe that as it may, the water was too clear for any hope of sinking tubs\ndeeper than Preventive eyes could go; and the very honest fellows who\nwere laboring here had not brought any tubs to sink. All such coarse\ngear was shipped off inland, as they vigorously expressed it; and\nwhat they were concerned with now was the cream and the jewel of their\nenterprise.\n\nThe sea reserved exclusive right of way around the rocky sides, without\neven a niche for human foot, so far as a stranger could perceive. At\nthe furthermost end of the cave, however, the craggy basin had a lip\nof flinty pebbles and shelly sand. This was no more than a very narrow\nshelf, just enough for a bather to plunge from; but it ran across the\nbroad end of the cavern, and from its southern corner went a deep dry\nfissure mounting out of sight into the body of the cliff. And here the\nsmugglers were merrily at work.\n\nThe nose of their boat was run high upon the shingle; two men on board\nof her were passing out the bales, while the other four received them,\nand staggered with them up the cranny. Captain Lyth himself was in the\nstern-sheets, sitting calmly, but ordering everything, and jotting down\nthe numbers. Now and then the gentle wash was lifting the brown timbers,\nand swelling with a sleepy gush of hushing murmurs out of sight. And now\nand then the heavy vault was echoing with some sailor's song.\n\nThere was only one more bale to land, and that the most precious of\nthe whole, being all pure lace most closely packed in a water-proof\ninclosure. Robin Lyth himself was ready to indulge in a careless song.\nFor this, as he had promised Mary, was to be his last illegal act.\nHenceforth, instead of defrauding the revenue, he would most loyally\ncheat the public, as every reputable tradesman must. How could any man\nserve his time more notably, toward shop-keeping, and pave fairer way\ninto the corporation of a grandly corrupt old English town, than by long\ngraduation of free trade? And Robin was yet too young and careless to\nknow that he could not endure dull work. \"How pleasant, how comfortable,\nhow secure,\" he was saying to himself, \"it will be! I shall hardly be\nable to believe that I ever lived in hardship.\"\n\nBut the great laws of human nature were not to be balked so. Robin Lyth,\nthe prince of smugglers, and the type of hardihood, was never to wear a\ngrocer's apron, was never to be \"licensed to sell tea, coffee, tobacco,\npepper, and snuff.\" For while he indulged in this vain dream, and was\nlifting his last most precious bale, a surge of neither wind nor tide,\nbut of hostile invasion, washed the rocks, and broke beneath his feet.\n\nIn a moment all his wits returned, all his plenitude of resource,\nand unequalled vigor and coolness. With his left hand--for he was\nas ambidexter as a brave writer of this age requires--he caught up a\nhandspike, and hurled it so truly along the line of torches that only\ntwo were left to blink; with his right he flung the last bale upon the\nshelf; then leaped out after it, and hurried it away. Then he sprang\ninto the boat again, and held an oar in either hand.\n\n\"In the name of the king, surrender,\" shouted Carroway, standing, tall\nand grim, in the bow of the pinnace, which he had skillfully driven\nthrough the entrance, leaving the other boats outside. \"We are three to\none, we have muskets, and a cannon. In the name of the king, surrender.\"\n\n\"In the name of the devil, splash!\" cried Robin, suiting the action\nto the word, striking the water with both broad blades, while his men\nsnatched oars and did the same. A whirl of flashing water filled the\ncave, as if with a tempest, soaked poor Carroway, and drenched his\nsword, and deluged the priming of the hostile guns. All was uproar,\nturmoil, and confusion thrice confounded; no man could tell where he\nwas, and the grappling boats reeled to and fro.\n\n\"Club your muskets, and at 'em!\" cried the lieutenant, mad with rage,\nas the gunwale of his boat swung over. \"Their blood be upon their own\nheads; draw your hangers, and at 'em!\"\n\nHe never spoke another word, but furiously leaping at the smuggler\nchief, fell back into his own boat, and died, without a syllable,\nwithout a groan. The roar of a gun and the smoke of powder mingled with\nthe watery hubbub, and hushed in a moment all the oaths of conflict.\n\nThe revenue men drew back and sheathed their cutlasses, and laid down\ntheir guns; some looked with terror at one another, and some at their\ndead commander. His body lay across the heel of the mast, which had been\nunstepped at his order; and a heavy drip of blood was weltering into a\nring upon the floor.\n\nFor several moments no one spoke, nor moved, nor listened carefully;\nbut the fall of the poor lieutenant's death-drops, like the ticking of\na clock, went on. Until an old tar, who had seen a sight of battles,\ncrooked his legs across a thwart, and propped up the limp head upon his\ndoubled knee.\n\n\"Dead as a door-nail,\" he muttered, after laying his ear to the lips,\nand one hand on the too impetuous heart, \"Who takes command? This is a\nhanging job, I'm thinking.\"\n\nThere was nobody to take command, not even a petty officer. The command\nfell to the readiest mind, as it must in such catastrophes. \"Jem, you do\nit,\" whispered two or three; and being so elected, he was clear.\n\n\"Lay her broadside on to the mouth of the cave. Not a man stirs out\nwithout killing me,\" old Jem shouted; and to hear a plain voice was\nsudden relief to most of them. In the wavering dimness they laid the\npinnace across the narrow entrance, while the smugglers huddled all\ntogether in their boat. \"Burn two blue-lights,\" cried old Jem; and it\nwas done.\n\n\"I'm not going to speechify to any cursed murderers,\" the old sailor\nsaid, with a sense of authority which made him use mild language; \"but\ntake heed of one thing, I'll blow you all to pieces with this here\nfour-pounder, without you strikes peremptory.\"\n\nThe brilliance of the blue-lights filled the cavern, throwing out\neverybody's attitude and features, especially those of the dead\nlieutenant. \"A fine job you have made of it this time!\" said Jem.\n\nThey were beaten, they surrendered, they could scarcely even speak to\nassert their own innocence of such a wicked job. They submitted to be\nbound, and cast down into their boat, imploring only that it might be\nthere--that they might not be taken to the other boat and laid near the\ncorpse of Carroway.\n\n\"Let the white-livered cowards have their way,\" the old sailor said,\ncontemptuously. \"Put their captain on the top of them. Now which is\nRobin Lyth?\"\n\nThe lights were burned out, and the cave was dark again, except when a\nslant of moonlight came through a fissure upon the southern side. The\nsmugglers muttered something, but they were not heeded.\n\n\"Never mind, make her fast, fetch her out, you lubbers. We shall see him\nwell enough when we get outside.\"\n\nBut in spite of all their certainty, they failed of this. They had only\nsix prisoners, and not one of them was Lyth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nLITTLE CARROWAYS\n\n\nMrs. Carroway was always glad to be up quite early in the morning. But\nsome few mornings seemed to slip in between whiles when, in accordance\nwith human nature, and its operations in the baby stage, even Lauta\nCarroway failed to be about the world before the sun himself. Whenever\nthis happened she was slightly cross, from the combat of conscience and\nself-assertion, which fly at one another worse than any dog and cat.\nGeraldine knew that her mother was put out if any one of the household\ndurst go down the stairs before her. And yet if Geraldine herself held\nback, and followed the example of late minutes, she was sure \"to catch\nit worse,\" as the poor child expressed it.\n\nIf any active youth with a very small income (such as an active youth is\npretty sure to have) wants a good wife, and has the courage to set\nout with one, his proper course is to choose the eldest daughter of\na numerous family. When the others come thickly, this daughter of the\nhouse gets worked down into a wonderful perfection of looking after\nothers, while she overlooks herself. Such a course is even better\nfor her than to have a step-mother--which also is a goodly thing, but\nsometimes leads to sourness. Whereas no girl of any decent staple can\nrevolt against her duty to her own good mother, and the proud sense of\nfostering and working for the little ones. Now Geraldine was wise in all\nthese ways, and pleased to be called the little woman of the house.\n\nThe baby had been troublous in the night, and scant of reason, as the\nrising race can be, even while so immature; and after being up with\nit, and herself producing a long series of noises--which lead to peace\nthrough the born desire of contradiction--the mother fell asleep at\nlast, perhaps from simple sympathy, and slept beyond her usual hour. But\ninstead of being grateful for this, she was angry and bitter to any one\nawake before her.\n\n\"I can not tell why it is,\" she said to Geraldine, who was toasting a\nherring for her brothers and sisters, and enjoying the smell (which was\nall that she would get), \"but perpetually now you stand exactly like\nyour father. There is every excuse for your father, because he is an\nofficer, and has been knocked about, as he always is; but there is no\nexcuse for you, miss. Put your heel decently under your dress. If we can\nafford nothing else, we can surely afford to behave well.\"\n\nThe child made no answer, but tucked her heel in, and went on toasting\nnobly, while she counted the waves on the side of the herring, where his\nribs should have been if he were not too fat; and she mentally divided\nhim into seven pieces, not one of which, alas! would be for hungry\nGeraldine. \"Tom must have two, after being out all night,\" she was\nsaying to herself; \"and to grudge him would be greedy. But the bit of\nskin upon the toasting-fork will be for me, I am almost sure.\"\n\n\"Geraldine, the least thing you can do, when I speak to you, is to\nanswer. This morning you are in a most provoking temper, and giving\nyourself the most intolerable airs. And who gave you leave to do your\nhair like that? One would fancy that you were some rising court beauty,\nor a child of the nobility at the very least, instead of a plain little\nthing that has to work--or at any rate that ought to work--to help its\npoor mother! Oh, now you are going to cry, I suppose. Let me see a tear,\nand you shall go to bed again.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, mother, now what do you think has happened?\" little Tom\nshouted, as he rushed in from the beach. \"Father has caught all the\nsmugglers, every one, and the Royal George is coming home before a\nspanking breeze, with three boats behind her, and they can't be all\nours; and one of them must belong to Robin Lyth himself; and I would\nalmost bet a penny they have been and shot him; though everybody said\nthat he never could be shot. Jerry, come and look--never mind the old\nfish. I never did see such a sight in all my life. They have got the\njib-sail on him, so he must be dead at last; and instead of half a\ncrown, I am sure to get a guinea. Come along, Jerry, and perhaps I'll\ngive you some of it!\"\n\n\"Tommy,\" said his mother, \"you are always so impetuous! I never\nwill believe in such good luck until I see it. But you have been a\nwonderfully good brave boy, and your father may thank you for whatever\nhe has done. I shall not allow Geraldine to go; for she is not a good\nchild this morning. And of course I can not go myself, for your father\nwill come home absolutely starving. And it would not be right for the\nlittle ones to go, if things are at all as you suppose. Now, if I let\nyou go yourself, you are not to go beyond the flag-staff. Keep far away\nfrom the boats, remember; unless your father calls for you to run on any\nerrand. All the rest of you go in here, with your bread and milk, and\nwait until I call you.\"\n\nMrs. Carroway locked all the little ones in a room from which they could\nsee nothing of the beach, with orders to Cissy, the next girl, to feed\nthem, and keep them all quiet till she came again. But while she was\nbusy, with a very lively stir, to fetch out whatever could be found of\nfatness or grease that could be hoped to turn to gravy in the pan--for\nCarroway, being so lean, loved fat, and to put a fish before him was an\ninsult to his bones--just at the moment when she had struck oil, in the\nshape of a very fat chop, from forth a stew, which had beaten all\nthe children by stearine inertia--then at this moment, when she was\nrejoicing, the latch of the door clicked, and a man came in.\n\n\"Whoever you are, you seem to me to make yourself very much at home,\"\nthe lady said, sharply, without turning round, because she supposed it\nto be a well-accustomed enemy, armed with that odious \"little bill.\" The\nintruder made no answer, and she turned to rate him thoroughly; but the\npetulance of her eyes drew back before the sad stern gaze of his. \"Who\nare you, and what do you want?\" she asked, with a yellow dish in one\nhand, and a frying-pan in the other. \"Geraldine, come here: that man\nlooks wild.\"\n\nHer visitor did look wild enough, but without any menace in his\nsorrowful dark eyes. \"Can't the man speak?\" she cried. \"Are you mad, or\nstarving? We are not very rich; but we can give you bread, poor fellow.\nCaptain Carroway will be at home directly, and he will see what can be\ndone for you.\"\n\n\"Have you not heard of the thing that has been done?\" the young man\nasked her, word by word, and staying himself with one hand upon the\ndresser, because he was trembling dreadfully.\n\n\"Yes, I have heard of it all. They have shot the smuggler Robin Lyth\nat last. I am very sorry for him. But it was needful; and he had no\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Lady, I am Robin Lyth. I have not been shot; nor even shot at. The man\nthat has been shot, I know not how, instead of me, was--was somebody\nquite different. With all my heart I wish it had been me; and no more\ntrouble.\"\n\nHe looked at the mother and the little girl, and sobbed, and fell upon\na salting stool, which was to have been used that morning. Then, while\nMrs. Carroway stood bewildered, Geraldine ran up to him, and took his\nhand, and said: \"Don't cry. My papa says that men never cry. And I am so\nglad that you were not shot.\"\n\n\"See me kiss her,\" said Robin Lyth, as he laid his lips upon the child's\nfair forehead. \"If I had done it, could I do that? Darling, you will\nremember this. Madam, I am hunted like a mad dog, and shall be hanged to\nyour flag-staff if I am caught. I am here to tell you that, as God looks\ndown from heaven upon you and me, I did not do it--I did not even know\nit.\"\n\nThe smuggler stood up, with his right hand on his heart, and tears\nrolling manifestly down his cheeks, but his eyes like crystal, clear\nwith truth; and the woman, who knew not that she was a widow, but felt\nit already with a helpless wonder, answered, quietly: \"You speak the\ntruth, sir. But what difference can it make to me?\" Lyth tried to answer\nwith the same true look; but neither his eyes nor his tongue would\nserve.\n\n\"I shall just go and judge for myself,\" she said, as if it were a\nquestion of marketing (such bitter defiance came over her), and she took\nno more heed of him than if he were a chair; nor even half so much, for\nshe was a great judge of a chair. \"Geraldine, go and put your bonnet on.\nWe are going to meet your father. Tell Cissy and all the rest to come\nbut the baby. The baby can not do it, I suppose. In a minute and a half\nI shall expect you all--how many? Seven?--yes, seven of you.\"\n\n\"Seven, mother, yes. And the baby makes it eight; and yesterday you said\nthat he was worth all us together.\"\n\nRobin Lyth saw that he was no more wanted, or even heeded; and without\ndelay he quitted such premises of danger. Why should he linger in a\nspot where he might have violent hands laid on him, and be sped to a\npremature end, without benefit even of trial by jury? Upon this train of\nreasoning he made off.\n\nWithout any manner of reasoning at all, but with fierceness of dread and\nstupidity of grief, the mother collected her children in silence, from\nthe damsel of ten to the toddler of two. Then, leaving the baby tied\ndown in the cradle, she pulled at the rest of them, on this side and on\nthat, to get them into proper trim of dresses and of hats, as if they\nwere going to be marched off to church. For that all the younger ones\nmade up their minds, and put up their ears for the tinkle of the bell;\nbut the elder children knew that it was worse than that, because their\nmother never looked at them.\n\n\"You will go by the way of the station,\" she said, for the boats were\nstill out at sea, and no certainty could be made of them: \"whatever it\nis, we may thank the station for it.\"\n\nThe poor little things looked up at her in wonder; and then, acting up\nto their discipline, set off, in lopsided pairs of a small and a big\none, to save any tumbling and cutting of knees. The elder ones walked\nwith discretion, and a strong sense of responsibility, hushed, moreover,\nby some inkling of a great black thing to meet. But the baby ones\nprattled, and skipped with their feet, and straggled away toward the\nflowers by the path. The mother of them all followed slowly and heavily,\nholding the youngest by the hand, because of its trouble in getting\nthrough the stones. Her heart was nearly choking, but her eyes free and\nreckless, wandering wildly over earth, and sea, and sky, in vain search\nof guidance from any or from all of them.\n\nThe pinnace came nearer, with its sad, cold freight. The men took off\ntheir hats, and rubbed their eyes, and some of them wanted to back\noff again; but Mrs. Carroway calmly said, \"Please to let me have my\nhusband.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nMAIDS AND MERMAIDS\n\n\nDay comes with climbing, night by falling; hence the night is so much\nswifter. Happiness takes years to build; but misery swoops like an\navalanche. Such, and even more depressing, are the thoughts young folk\ngive way to when their first great trouble rushes and sweeps them into a\ndesert, trackless to the inexperienced hope.\n\nWhen Mary Anerley heard, by the zealous offices of watchful friends,\nthat Robin Lyth had murdered Captain Carroway ferociously, and had fled\nfor his life across the seas, first wrath at such a lie was followed by\npersistent misery. She had too much faith in his manly valor and tender\nheart to accept the tale exactly as it was told to her; but still she\ncould not resist the fear that in the whirl of conflict, with life\nagainst life, he had dealt the death. And she knew that even such a deed\nwould brand him as a murderer, stamp out all love, and shatter every\nhope of quiet happiness. The blow to her pride was grievous also; for\nmany a time had she told herself that a noble task lay before her--to\nrescue from unlawful ways and redeem to reputable life the man whose\nbravery and other gallant gifts had endeared him to the public and to\nher. But now, through force of wretched facts, he must be worse than\never.\n\nHer father and mother said never a word upon the subject to her. Mrs.\nAnerley at first longed to open out, and shed upon the child a mother's\nsympathy, as well as a mother's scolding; but firmly believing, as\nshe did, the darkest version of the late event, it was better that she\nshould hold her peace, according to her husband's orders.\n\n\"Let the lass alone,\" he said; \"a word against that fellow now would\nmake a sight of mischief. Suppose I had shot George Tanfield, instead\nof hiding him soundly, when he stuck up to you, why you must have been\nsorry for me, Sophy. And Mary is sorry for that rogue, no doubt, and\nbelieves that he did it for her sake, I dare say. The womenkind always\ndo think that. If a big thief gets swung for breaking open a cash-box,\nhis lassie will swear he was looking for her thimble. If you was to go\nnow for discoursing of this matter, you would never put up with poor\nPoppet's account of him, and she would run him higher up, every time you\nran him down; ay, and believe it too: such is the ways of women.\"\n\n\"Why, Stephen, you make me open up my eyes. I never dreamed you were\nhalf so cunning, and of such low opinions.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, only from my own observance. I would scarcely trust\nmyself not to abuse that fellow. And, Sophy, you know you can not stop\nyour tongue, like me.\"\n\n\"Thank God for that same! He never meant us so to do. But, Stephen, I\nwill follow your advice; because it is my own opinion.\"\n\nMary was puzzled by this behavior; for everything used to be so plain\namong them. She would even have tried for some comfort from Willie,\nwhose mind was very large upon all social questions. But Willie had\nsolved at last the problem of perpetual motion, according to his own\nconviction, and locked himself up with his model all day; and the world\nmight stand still, so long as that went on. \"Oh, what would I give for\ndear Jack!\" cried Mary.\n\nWorn out at length with lonely grief, she asked if she might go to Byrsa\nCottage, for a change. Even that was refused, though her father's\nkind heart ached at the necessary denial. Sharp words again had passed\nbetween the farmer and the tanner concerning her, and the former\nbelieved that his brother-in-law would even encourage the outlaw still.\nAnd for Mary herself now the worst of it was that she had nothing to lay\nhold of in the way of complaint or grievance. It was not like that first\nestrangement, when her father showed how much he felt it in a hundred\nways, and went about everything upside down, and comforted her by his\nwant of comfort. Now it was ten times worse than that, for her father\ntook everything quite easily!\n\nShocking as it may be, this was true. Stephen Anerley had been through\na great many things since the violence of his love-time, and his views\nupon such tender subjects were not so tender as they used to be. With\nthe eyes of wisdom he looked back, having had his own way in the matter,\nupon such young sensations as very laudable, but curable. In his own\ncase he had cured them well, and, upon the whole, very happily, by a\ngood long course of married life; but having tried that remedy alone,\nhow could he say that there was no better? He remembered how his own\nmiseries had soon subsided, or gone into other grooves, after matrimony.\nThis showed that they were transient, but did not prove such a course\nto be the only cure for them. Recovering from illness, has any man been\nknown to say that the doctor recovered him?\n\nMrs. Anerley's views upon the subject were much the same, though\nmodified, of course, by the force of her own experience. She might have\nhad a much richer man than Stephen; and when he was stingy, she reminded\nhim of that, which, after a little disturbance, generally terminated\nin five guineas. And now she was clear that if Mary were not worried,\ncondoled with, or cried over, she would take her own time, and come\ngradually round, and be satisfied with Harry Tanfield. Harry was a fine\nyoung fellow, and worshipped the ground that Mary walked upon; and it\nseemed a sort of equity that he should have her, as his father had\nbeen disappointed of her mother. Every Sunday morning he trimmed his\nwhiskers, and put on a wonderful waistcoat; and now he did more, for he\nbought a new hat, and came to church to look at her.\n\nOftentimes now, by all these doings, the spirit of the girl was roused,\nand her courage made ready to fly out in words; but the calm look of the\nelders stopped her, and then true pride came to her aid. If they chose\nto say nothing of the matter which was in her heart continually, would\nshe go whining to them about it, and scrape a grain of pity from\na cartload of contempt? One day, as she stood before the swinging\nglass--that present from Aunt Popplewell which had moved her mother's\nwrath so--she threw back her shoulders, and smoothed the plaits of her\nnice little waist, and considered herself. The humor of the moment grew\nupon her, and crept into indulgence, as she saw what a very fair lass\nshe was, and could not help being proud of it. She saw how the soft rich\ndamask of her cheeks returned at being thought of, and the sparkle\nof her sweet blue eyes, and the merry delight of her lips, that made\nrespectable people want to steal a kiss, from the pure enticement of\ngood-will.\n\n\"I will cry no more in the nights,\" she said. \"Why should I make such a\nfigure of myself, with nobody to care for it? And here is my hair full\nof kinkles and neglect! I declare, if he ever came back, he would say,\n'What a fright you are become, my Mary!' Where is that stuff of Aunt\nDeborah's, I wonder, that makes her hair like satin? It is high time to\nleave off being such a dreadful dowdy. I will look as nice as ever, just\nto let them know that their cruelty has not killed me.\"\n\nVirtuous resolves commend themselves, and improve with being carried\nout. She put herself into her very best trim, as simple as a lily, and\nas perfect as a rose, though the flutter of a sigh or two enlarged her\ngentle breast. She donned a very graceful hat, adorned with sweet ribbon\nright skillfully smuggled; and she made up her mind to have the benefit\nof the air.\n\nThe prettiest part of all Anerley Farm, for those who are not farmers,\nis a soft little valley, where a brook comes down, and passes from\nvoluntary ruffles into the quiet resignation of a sheltered lake. A\npleasant and a friendly little water-spread is here, cheerful to the\nsunshine, and inviting to the moon, with a variety of gleamy streaks,\naccording to the sky and breeze. Pasture-land and arable come sloping to\nthe margin, which, instead of being rough and rocky, lips the pool with\ngentleness. Ins and outs of little bays afford a nice variety, while\nround the brink are certain trees of a modest and unpretentious bent.\nThese having risen to a very fair distance toward the sky, come down\nagain, scarcely so much from a doubt of their merits, as through\naffection to their native land. In summer they hang like a permanent\nshower of green to refresh the bright water; and in winter, like loose\nosier-work, or wattles curved for binding.\n\nUnder one of the largest of these willows the runaway Jack had made a\nseat, whereon to sit and watch his toy boat cruising on the inland wave.\nOften when Mary was tired of hoping for the return of her playmate, she\ncame to this place to think about him, and wonder whether he thought of\nher. And now in the soft December evening (lonely and sad, but fair to\nlook at, like herself) she was sitting here.\n\nThe keen east wind, which had set in as Captain Brown predicted, was\nover now, and succeeded by the gentler influence of the west. Nothing\ncould be heard in this calm nook but the lingering touch of the dying\nbreeze, and the long soft murmur of the distant sea, and the silvery\nplash of a pair of coots at play. Neither was much to be seen, except\nthe wavering glisten and long shadows of the mere, the tracery of trees\nagainst the fading light, and the outline of the maiden as she leaned\nagainst the trunk. Generations of goat-moths in their early days of\nvoracity had made a nice hollow for her hat to rest in, and some of the\npowdering willow dusted her bright luxuriant locks with gold. Her face\nwas by no means wan or gloomy, and she added to the breezes not a single\nsigh. This happened without any hardness of heart, or shallow contempt\nof the nobler affections; simply from the hopefulness of healthful\nyouth, and the trust a good will has in powers of good.\n\nShe was looking at those coots, who were full of an idea that the winter\nhad spent itself in that east wind, that the gloss of spring plumage\nmust be now upon their necks, and that they felt their toes growing\nwarmer toward the downy tepefaction of a perfect nest. Improving a long\nand kind acquaintance with these birds, some of whom have confidence in\nhuman nature, Mary was beginning to be absent from her woes, and joyful\nin the pleasure of a thoughtless pair, when suddenly, with one accord,\nthey dived, and left a bright splash and a wrinkle. \"Somebody is coming;\nthey must have seen an enemy,\" said the damsel to herself. \"I am sure\nI never moved. I will never have them shot by any wicked poacher.\" To\nwatch the bank nicely, without being seen, she drew in her skirt and\nshrank behind the tree, not from any fear, but just to catch the fellow;\nfor one of the laborers on the farm, who had run at his master with\na pitchfork once, was shrewdly suspected of poaching with a gun. But\nkeener eyes than those of any poacher were upon her, and the lightest of\nlight steps approached.\n\n\"Oh, Robin, are you come, then, at last?\" cried Mary.\n\n\"Three days I have been lurking, in the hope of this. Heart of my heart,\nare you glad to see me?\"\n\n\"I should think that I was. It is worth a world of crying. Oh, where\nhave you been this long, long time?\"\n\n\"Let me have you in my arms, if it is but for a moment. You are not\nafraid of me?--you are not ashamed to love me?\"\n\n\"I love you all the better for your many dreadful troubles. Not a word\ndo I believe of all the wicked people say of you. Don't be afraid of me.\nYou may kiss me, Robin.\"\n\n\"You are such a beautiful spick and span! And I am only fit to go into\nthe pond. Oh, Mary, what a shame of me to take advantage of you!\"\n\n\"Well, I think that it is time for you to leave off now. Though you must\nnot suppose that I think twice about my things. When I look at you, it\nmakes me long to give you my best cloak and a tidy hat. Oh, where is all\nyour finery gone, poor Robin?\"\n\n\"Endeavor not to be insolent, on the strength of your fine clothes.\nRemember that I have abandoned free trade; and the price of every\narticle will rise at once.\"\n\nMary Anerley not only smiled, but laughed, with the pleasure of a great\nrelief. She had always scorned the idea that her lover had even made a\nshot at Carroway, often though the brave lieutenant had done the like to\nhim; and now she felt sure that he could clear himself; or how could\nhe be so light-hearted? \"You see that I am scarcely fit to lead off a\ncountry-dance with you,\" said Robin, still holding both her hands, and\nwatching the beauty of her clear bright eyes, which might gather big\ntears at any moment, as the deep blue sky is a sign of sudden rain; \"and\nit will be a very long time, my darling, before you see me in gay togs\nagain.\"\n\n\"I like you a great deal better so. You always look brave--but you look\nso honest now!\"\n\n\"That is a most substantial saying, and worthy of the race of Anerley.\nHow I wish that your father would like me, Mary! I suppose it is\nhopeless to wish for that?\"\n\n\"No, not at all--if you could keep on looking shabby. My dear father\nhas a most generous mind. If he only could be brought to see how you are\nill-treated--\"\n\n\"Alas! I shall have no chance of letting him see that. Before to-morrow\nmorning I must say good-by to England. My last chance of seeing you\nwas now this evening. I bless every star that is in the heaven now. I\ntrusted to my luck, and it has not deceived me.\"\n\n\"Robin dear, I never wish to try to be too pious. But I think that you\nshould rather trust in Providence than starlight.\"\n\n\"So I do. And it is Providence that has kept me out of sight--out of\nsight of enemies, and in sight of you, my Mary. The Lord looks down on\nevery place where His lovely angels wander. You are one of His angels,\nMary; and you have made a man of me. For years I shall not see you,\ndarling; never more again, perhaps. But as long as I live you will be\nhere; and the place shall be kept pure for you. If we only could have\na shop together--oh, how honest I would be! I would give full weight,\nbesides the paper; I would never sell an egg more than three weeks old;\nand I would not even adulterate! But that is a dream of the past, I\nfear. Oh, I never shall hoist the Royal Arms. But I mean to serve under\nthem, and fight my way. My captain shall be Lord Nelson.\"\n\n\"That is the very thing that you were meant for. I will never forgive\nDr. Upandown for not putting you into the navy. You could have done no\nsmuggling then.\"\n\n\"I am not altogether sure of that. However, I will shun scandal, as\nbehooves a man who gets so much. You have not asked me to clear myself\nof that horrible thing about poor Carroway. I love you the more for not\nasking me; it shows your faith so purely. But you have the right to know\nall I know. There is no fear of any interruption here; so, Mary, I will\ntell you, if you are sure that you can bear it.\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes! Do tell me all you know. It is so frightful that I must\nhear it.\"\n\n\"What I have to say will not frighten you, darling, because I did\nnot even see the deed. But my escape was rather strange, and deserves\ntelling better than I can tell it, even with you to encourage me\nby listening. When we were so suddenly caught in the cave, through\ntreachery of some of our people, I saw in a moment that we must be\ntaken, but resolved to have some fun for it, with a kind of whim which\ncomes over me sometimes. So I knocked away the lights, and began myself\nto splash with might and main, and ordered the rest to do likewise. We\ndid it so well that the place was like a fountain or a geyser; and I\nsent a great dollop of water into the face of the poor lieutenant--the\nonly assault I have ever made upon him. There was just light enough for\nme to know him, because he was so tall and strange; but I doubt whether\nhe knew me at all. He became excited, as he well might be; he dashed\naway the water from his eyes with one hand, and with the other made\na wild sword-cut, rushing forward as if to have at me. Like a bird, I\ndived into the water from our gunwale, and under the keel of the other\nboat, and rose to the surface at the far side of the cave. In the very\nact of plunging, a quick flash came before me--or at least I believed\nso afterward--and a loud roar, as I struck the wave. It might have been\nonly from my own eyes and ears receiving so suddenly the cleavage of the\nwater. If I thought anything at all about it, it was that somebody had\nshot at me; but expecting to be followed, I swam rapidly away. I did not\neven look back, as I kept in the dark of the rocks, for it would have\nlost a stroke, and a stroke was more than I could spare. To my great\nsurprise, I heard no sound of any boat coming after me, nor any shouts\nof Carroway, such as I am accustomed to. But swimming as I was, for my\nown poor life, like an otter with a pack of hounds after him, I\nassure you I did not look much after anything except my own run of the\ngauntlet.\"\n\n\"Of course not. How could you? It makes me draw my breath to think of\nyou swimming in the dark like that, with deep water, and caverns, and\nguns, and all!\"\n\n\"Mary, I thought that my time was come; and only one beautiful image\nsustained me, when I came to think of it afterward. I swam with my\nhands well under water, and not a breath that could be heard, and my cap\ntucked into my belt, and my sea-going pumps slipped away into a pocket.\nThe water was cold, but it only seemed to freshen me, and I found myself\nable to breathe very pleasantly in the gentle rise and fall of waves.\nYet I never expected to escape, with so many boats to come after me. For\nnow I could see two boats outside, as well as old Carroway's pinnace in\nthe cave; and if once they caught sight of me, I could never get away.\n\n\"When I saw those two boats upon the watch outside, I scarcely knew what\nto do for the best, whether to put my breast to it and swim out, or\nto hide in some niche with my body under water, and cover my face with\noar-weed. Luckily I took the bolder course, remembering their portfires,\nwhich would make the cave like day. Not everybody could have swum out\nthrough that entrance, against a spring-tide and the lollop of the sea;\nand one dash against the rocks would have settled me. But I trusted in\nthe Lord, and tried a long, slow stroke.\n\n\"My enemies must have been lost in dismay, and panic, and utter\nconfusion, or else they must have espied me, for twice or thrice, as I\nmet the waves, my head and shoulders were thrown above the surface, do\nwhat I would; and I durst not dive, for I wanted my eyes every moment.\nI kept on the darkest side, of course, but the shadows were not half\nso deep as I could wish; and worst of all, outside there was a piece of\nmoonlight, which I must cross within fifty yards of the bigger of the\nsentry boats.\n\n\"The mouth of that cave is two fathoms wide for a longish bit of\nchannel; and, Mary dear, if I had not been supported by continual\nthoughts of you, I must have gone against the sides, or downright to the\nbottom, from the waves keeping knocking me about so. I may tell you that\nI felt that I should never care again, as my clothes began to bag about\nme, except to go down to the bottom and be quiet, but for the blessed\nthought of standing up some day, at the 'hymeneal altar,' as great\npeople call it, with a certain lovely Mary.\"\n\n\"Oh, Robin, now you make me laugh, when I ought to be quite crying. If\nsuch a thing should ever be, I shall expect to see you swimming.\"\n\n\"Such a thing will be, as sure as I stand here--though not at all in\nhymeneal garb just now. Whatever my whole heart is set upon, I do, and\novercome all obstacles. Remember that, and hold fast, darling. However,\nI had now to overcome the sea, which is worse than any tide in the\naffairs of men. A long and hard tussle it was, I assure you, to fight\nagainst the indraught, and to drag my frame through the long hillocky\ngorge. At last, however, I managed it; and to see the open waves again\nput strength into my limbs, and vigor into my knocked-about brain. I\nsuppose that you can not understand it, Mary, but I never enjoyed a\nthing more than the danger of crossing that strip of moonlight. I could\nsee the very eyes and front teeth of the men who were sitting there to\nlook out for me if I should slip their mates inside; and knowing the\ntwist of every wave, and the vein of every tide-run, I rested in a\nsmooth dark spot, and considered their manners quietly. They had not yet\nheard a word of any doings in the cavern, but their natures were up for\nsome business to do, as generally happens with beholders. Having nothing\nto do, they were swearing at the rest.\n\n\"In the place where I was halting now the line of a jagged cliff seemed\nto cut the air, and fend off the light from its edges. You can only see\nsuch a thing from the level of the sea, and it looks very odd when you\nsee it, as if the moon and you were a pair of playing children, feeling\nround a corner for a glimpse of one another. But plain enough it was,\nand far too plain, that the doubling of that little cape would treble my\ndanger, by reason of the bold moonlight, I knew that my only refuge was\nanother great hollow in the crags between the cave I had escaped from\nand the point--a place which is called the 'Church Cave,' from an\nold legend that it leads up to Flamborough church. To the best of my\nknowledge, it does nothing of the kind, at any rate now; but it has a\nnarrow fissure, known to few except myself, up which a nimble man\nmay climb; and this was what I hoped to do. Also it has a very narrow\nentrance, through which the sea flows into it, so that a large boat can\nnot enter, and a small one would scarcely attempt it in the dark, unless\nit were one of my own, hard pressed. Now it seemed almost impossible for\nme to cross that moonlight without being seen by those fellows in the\nboat, who could pull, of course, four times as fast as I could swim, not\nto mention the chances of a musket-ball. However, I was just about to\nrisk it, for my limbs were growing very cold, when I heard a loud\nshout from the cave which I had left, and knew that the men there were\nsummoning their comrades. These at once lay out upon their oars, and\nturned their backs to me, and now was my good time. The boat came\nhissing through the water toward the Dovecote, while I stretched away\nfor the other snug cave. Being all in a flurry, they kept no look-out;\nif the moon was against me, my good stars were in my favor. Nobody\nsaw me, and I laughed in my wet sleeves as I thought of the rage of\nCarroway, little knowing that the fine old fellow was beyond all rage or\npain.\"\n\n\"How wonderful your luck was, and your courage too!\" cried Mary, who had\nlistened with bright tears upon her cheeks. \"Not one man in a thousand\ncould have done so bold a thing. And how did you get away at last, poor\nRobin?\"\n\n\"Exactly as I meant to do, from the time I formed my plan. The Church\nhas ever been a real friend in need to me; I took the name for a lucky\nomen, and swam in with a brisker stroke. It is the prettiest of all the\ncaves, to my mind, though the smallest, with a sweet round basin, and a\nplayful little beach, and nothing very terrible about it. I landed, and\nrested with a thankful heart upon the shelly couch of the mermaids.\"\n\n\"Oh, Robin, I hope none of them came to you. They are so wonderfully\nbeautiful. And no one that ever has seen them cares any more for--for\ndry people that wear dresses.\"\n\n\"Mary, you delight me much, by showing signs of jealousy. Fifty may have\ncome, but I saw not one, for I fell into a deep calm sleep. If they had\ncome, I would have spurned them all, not only from my constancy to you,\nmy dear, but from having had too much drip already. Mary, I see a man on\nthe other side of the mere, not opposite to us, but a good bit further\ndown. You see those two swimming birds: look far away between them, you\nwill see something moving.\"\n\n\"I see nothing, either standing still or moving. It is growing too dark\nfor any eyes not thoroughly trained in smuggling. But that reminds me to\ntell you, Robin, that a strange man--a gentleman they seemed to say--has\nbeen seen upon our land, and he wanted to see me, without my father\nknowing it. But only think! I have never even asked you whether you are\nhungry--perhaps even starving! How stupid, how selfish, how churlish of\nme! But the fault is yours, because I had so much to hear of.\"\n\n\"Darling, you may trust me not to starve, I can feed by-and-by. For the\npresent I must talk, that you may know all about everything, and bear me\nharmless in your mind, when evil things are said of me. Have you heard\nthat I went to see Widow Carroway, even before she had heard of her\nloss, but not before I was hunted? I knew that I must do so, now or\nnever, before the whole world was up in arms against me; and I thank God\nthat I saw her. A man might think nothing of such an act, or even might\ntake it for hypocrisy; but a woman's heart is not so black. Though she\ndid not even know what I meant, for she had not felt her awful blow, and\nI could not tell her of it, she did me justice afterward. In the thick\nof her terrible desolation, she stood beside her husband's grave, in\nBridlington Priory Church yard, and she said to a hundred people there:\n'Here lies my husband, foully murdered. The coroner's jury have brought\ntheir verdict against Robin Lyth the smuggler. Robin Lyth is as innocent\nas I am. I know who did it, and time will show. My curse is upon him;\nand my eyes are on him now.' Then she fell down in a fit, and the\nPreventive men, who were drawn up in a row, came and carried her away.\nDid anybody tell you, darling? Perhaps they keep such things from you.\"\n\n\"Part of it I heard; but not so clearly. I was told that she acquitted\nyou and I blessed her in my heart for it.\"\n\n\"Even more than that she did. As soon as she got home again, she wrote\nto Robin Cockscroft--a very few words, but as strong as could be,\ntelling him that I should have no chance of justice if I were caught\njust now; that she must have time to carry out her plans; that the Lord\nwould soon raise up good friends to help her; and as sure as there was\na God in heaven, she would bring the man who did it to the gallows. Only\nthat I must leave the land at once. And that is what I shall do\nthis very night. Now I have told you almost all. Mary, we must say\n'good-by.'\"\n\n\"But surely I shall hear from you sometimes?\" said Mary, striving to be\nbrave, and to keep her voice from trembling. \"Years and years, without a\nword--and the whole world bitter against you and me! Oh, Robin, I think\nthat it will break my heart. And I must not even talk of you.\"\n\n\"Think of me, darling, while I think of you. Thinking is better than\ntalking, I shall never talk of you, but be thinking all the more.\nTalking ruins thinking. Take this token of the time you saved me, and\ngive me that bit of blue ribbon, my Mary; I shall think of your eyes\nevery time I kiss it. Kiss it yourself before you give it to me.\"\n\nLike a good girl, she did what she was told to do. She gave him the\nlove-knot from her breast, and stored his little trinket in that pure\nshrine.\n\n\"But sometimes--sometimes, I shall hear of you?\" she whispered,\nlingering, and trembling in the last embrace.\n\n\"To be sure, you shall hear of me from time to time, through Robin and\nJoan Cockscroft. I will not grieve you by saying, 'Be true to me,' my\nnoble one, and my everlasting love.\"\n\nMary was comforted, and ceased to cry. She was proud of him thus in the\ndepth of his trouble; and she prayed to God to bless him through the\nlong sad time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nFACT, OR FACTOR\n\n\n\"Papa, I have brought you a wonderful letter,\" cried Miss Janetta\nUpround, toward supper-time of that same night; \"and the most miraculous\nthing about it is that there is no post to pay. Oh, how stupid I am! I\nought to have got at least a shilling out of you for postage.\"\n\n\"My dear, be sorry for your sins, and not for having failed to add to\nthem. Our little world is brimful of news just now, but nearly all of\nit bad news. Why, bless me, this is in regular print, and it never has\npassed through the post at all, which explains the most astounding fact\nof positively naught to pay. Janetta, every day I congratulate myself\nupon such a wondrous daughter. But I never could have hoped that even\nyou would bring me a letter gratis.\"\n\n\"But the worst of it is that I deserve no credit. If I had cheated the\npostman, there would have been something to be proud of. But this letter\ncame in the most ignominious way--poked under the gate, papa! It is\nsealed with a foreign coin! Oh, dear, dear, I am all in a tingle to know\nall about it. I saw it by the moonlight, and it must belong to me.\"\n\n\"My dear, it says, 'Private, and to his own hands.' Therefore you had\nbetter go, and think no more about it. I confide to you many of my\nbusiness matters: or at any rate you get them out of me: but this being\nprivate, you must think no more about it.\"\n\n\"Darling papa, what a flagrant shame! The man must have done it with\nno other object than to rob me of every wink of sleep. If I swallow the\noutrage and retire, will you promise to tell me every word to-morrow?\nYou preached a most exquisite sermon last Sunday about the meanness and\nfutility of small concealments.\"\n\n\"Be off!\" cried the rector; \"you are worse than Mr. Mordacks, who lays\ndown the law about frankness perpetually, but never lets me guess what\nhis own purpose is.\"\n\n\"Oh, now I see where the infection comes from! Papa, I am off, for fear\nof catching it myself. Don't tell me, whatever you do. I never can sleep\nupon dark mysteries.\"\n\n\"Poor dear, you shall not have your rest disturbed,\" Dr. Upround said,\nsweetly, as he closed the door behind her; \"you are much too good a\ngirl for other people's plagues to visit you.\" Then, as he saddled his\npleasant old nose with the tranquil span of spectacles, the smile on his\nlips and the sigh of his breast arrived at a quiet little compromise. He\nwas proud of his daughter, her quickness and power to get the upper\nturn of words with him; but he grieved at her not having any deep\nimpressions, even after his very best sermons. But her mother always\ntold him not to be in any hurry, for even she herself had felt no very\nprofound impressions until she married a clergyman; and that argument\nalways made him smile (as invisibly as possible), because he had not\ndetected yet their existence in his better half. Such questions are\nmost delicate, and a husband can only set mute example. A father, on\nthe other hand, is bound to use his pastoral crook upon his children\nforemost.\n\n\"Now for this letter,\" said Dr. Upround, holding council with himself;\n\"evidently a good clerk, and perhaps a first-rate scholar. One of the\nvery best Greek scholars of the age does all his manuscript in printing\nhand, when he wishes it to be legible. And a capital plan it is--without\nmeaning any pun. I can read this like a gazette itself.\"\n\n\n\"REVEREND AND WORSHIPFUL SIR,--Your long and highly valued kindness\nrequires at least a word from me, before I leave this country. I have\nnot ventured into your presence, because it might place you in a very\ngrave predicament. Your duty to King and State might compel you with\nyour own hand to arrest me; and against your hand I could not strive.\nThe evidence brought before you left no choice but to issue a warrant\nagainst me, though it grieved your kind heart to do that same. Sir, I\nam purely innocent of the vile crime laid against me. I used no fire-arm\nthat night, neither did any of my men. And it is for their sake, as well\nas my own, that I now take the liberty of writing this. Failing of me,\nthe authorities may bring my comrades to trial, and convict them. If\nthat were so, it would become my duty as a man to surrender myself,\nand meet my death in the hope of saving them. But if the case is sifted\nproperly, they must be acquitted; for no fire-arm of any kind was in my\nboat, except one pair of pistols, in a locker under the after thwart,\nand they happened to be unloaded. I pray you to verify this, kind sir.\nMy firm belief is that the revenue officer was shot by one of his own\nmen; and his widow has the same opinion. I hear that the wound was in\nthe back of the head. If we had carried fire-arms, not one of us could\nhave shot him so.\n\n\"It may have been an accident; I can not say. Even so, the man whose\nmishap it was is not likely to acknowledge it. And I know that in a\ncourt of law truth must be paid for dearly. I venture to commit to your\ngood hands a draft upon a well-known Holland firm, which amounts to 78\npounds British, for the defense of the men who are in custody. I know\nthat you as a magistrate can not come forward as their defender; but\nI beg you as a friend of justice to place the money for their benefit.\nAlso especially to direct attention to the crew of the revenue boat and\ntheir guns.\n\n\"And now I fear greatly to encroach upon your kindness, and very\nlong-suffering good-will toward me. But I have brought into sad trouble\nand distress with her family--who are most obstinate people--and with\nthe opinion of the public, I suppose, a young lady worth more than all\nthe goods I ever ran, or ever could run, if I went on for fifty years.\nBy name she is Mistress Mary Anerley, and by birth the daughter of\nCaptain Anerley, of Anerley Farm, outside our parish. If your reverence\ncould only manage to ride round that way upon coming home from Sessions,\nonce or twice in the fine weather, and to say a kind word or two to my\nMary, and a good word, if any can be said of me, to her parents, who are\nstiff but worthy people, it would be a truly Christian act, and such as\nyou delight in, on this side of the Dane-dike.\n\n\"Reverend sir, I must now say farewell. From you I have learned almost\neverything I know, within the pale of statutes, which repeal one another\ncontinually. I have wandered sadly outside that pale, and now I pay the\npenalty. If I had only paid heed to your advice, and started in business\nwith the capital acquired by free trade, and got it properly protected,\nI might have been able to support my parents, and even be churchwarden\nof Flamborough. You always told me that my unlawful enterprise must\nclose in sadness; and your words have proved too true. But I never\nexpected anything like this; and I do not understand it yet. A\npenetrating mind like yours, with all the advantages of authority, even\nthat is likely to be baffled in such a difficult case as this.\n\n\"Reverend sir, my case is hard; for I always have labored to establish\npeaceful trade; and I must have succeeded again, if honor had guided all\nmy followers. We always relied upon the coast-guard to be too late for\nany mischief; and so they would have been this time, if their acts had\nbeen straightforward. In sorrow and lowness of fortune, I remain, with\nhumble respect and gratitude, your Worship's poor pupil and banished\nparishioner,\n\n\"ROBIN LYTH, of Flamborough.\"\n\n\n\"Come, now, Robin,\" Dr. Upround said, as soon as he had well considered\nthis epistle, \"I have put up with many a checkmate at your hands, but\nnot without the fair delight of a counter-stroke at the enemy. Here you\nafford me none of that. You are my master in every way; and quietly you\nmake me make your moves, quite as if I were the black in a problem.\nYou leave me to conduct your fellow-smugglers' case, to look after your\nsweetheart, and to make myself generally useful. By-the-way, that touch\nabout my pleading his cause in my riding-boots, and with a sessional\nair about me, is worthy of the great Verdoni. Neither is that a bad hit\nabout my Christianity stopping at the Dane-dike. Certes, I shall have\nto call on that young lady, though from what I have heard of the sturdy\nfarmer, I may both ride and reason long, even after my greatest exploits\nat the Sessions, without converting him to free trade; and trebly so\nafter that deplorable affair. I wonder whether we shall ever get to the\nbottom of that mystery. How often have I warned the boy that mischief\nwas quite sure to come! though I never even dreamed that it would be so\nbad as this.\"\n\nSince Dr. Upround first came to Flamborough, nothing (not even the\ninfliction of his nickname) had grieved him so deeply as the sad death\nof Carroway. From the first he felt certain that his own people were\nguiltless of any share in it. But his heart misgave him as to distant\nsmugglers, men who came from afar freebooting, bringing over ocean\nwoes to men of settlement, good tithe-payers. For such men (plainly of\nforeign breed, and very plain specimens of it) had not at all succeeded\nin eluding observation, in a neighborhood where they could have no\nhonest calling. Flamborough had called to witness Filey, and Filey had\nattested Bridlington, that a stranger on horseback had appeared among\nthem with a purpose obscurely evil. They were right enough as to the\nfact, although the purpose was not evil, as little Denmark even now\nbegan to own.\n\n\"Here I am again!\" cried Mr. Mordacks, laying vehement hold of the\nrector's hand, upon the following morning; \"just arrived from York, dear\nsir, after riding half the night, and going anywhere you please; except\nperhaps where you would like to send me, if charity and Christian\ncourtesy allowed. My dear sir, have you heard the news? I perceive by\nyour countenance that you have not. Ah, you are generally benighted in\nthese parts. Your caves have got something to do with it. The mind gets\naccustomed to them.\"\n\n\"I venture to think, Mr. Mordacks, on the whole,\" said the rector,\nwho studied this man gently, \"that sometimes you are rapid in your\nconclusions. Possibly of the two extremes it is the more desirable;\nespecially in these parts, because of its great rarity. Still the mere\nfact of some caves existing, in or out of my parish, whichever it may\nbe, scarcely seems to prove that all the people of Flamborough live in\nthem. And even if we did, it was the manner of the ancient seers, both\nin the Classics, and in Holy Writ--\"\n\n\"Sir, I know all about Elijah and Obadiah, and the rest of them. Profane\nliterature we leave now for clerks in holy orders--we positively have no\ntime for it. Everything begins to move with accelerated pace. This is a\nnew century, and it means to make its mark. It begins very badly; but\nit will go on all the better. And I hope to have the pleasure, at a\nvery early day, of showing you one of its leading men, a man of large\nintellect, commanding character, the most magnificent principles--and,\nin short, lots of money. You must be quite familiar with the name of Sir\nDuncan Yordas.\"\n\n\"I fancy that I have heard or seen it somewhere. Oh, something to do\nwith the Hindoos, or the Africans. I never pay much attention to such\nthings.\"\n\n\"Neither do I, Dr. Upround. Still somebody must, and a lot of money\ncomes of it. Their idols have diamond eyes, which purity of worship\ncompels us to confiscate. And there are many other ways of getting on\namong them, while wafting and expanding them into a higher sphere of\nthought. The mere fact of Sir Duncan having feathered his nest--pardon\nso vulgar an expression, doctor--proves that while giving, we may also\nreceive: for which we have the highest warranty.\"\n\n\"The laborer is worthy of his hire, Mr. Mordacks. At the same time we\nshould remember also--\"\n\n\"What St. Paul says per contra. Quite so. That is always my first\nconsideration, when I work for my employers. Ah, Dr. Upround, few men\ngive such pure service as your humble servant. I have twice had the\nhonor of handing you my card. If ever you fall into any difficulty,\nwhere zeal, fidelity, and high principle, combined with very low\ncharges--\"\n\n\"Mr. Mordacks, my opinion of you is too high for even yourself to add to\nit. But what has this Sir Duncan Yorick--\"\n\n\"Yordas, my dear sir--Sir Duncan Yordas--the oldest family in Yorkshire.\nMen of great power, both for good and evil, mainly, perhaps, the latter.\nIt has struck me sometimes that the county takes its name--But etymology\nis not my forte. What has he to do with us, you ask? Sir, I will answer\nyou most frankly. 'Coram populo' is my business motto. Excuse me,\nI think I hear that door creak. No, a mere fancy--we are quite 'in\ncamera.' Very well; reverend sir, prepare your mind for a highly\nastounding disclosure.\"\n\n\"I have lived too long to be astounded, my good sir. But allow me to put\non my spectacles. Now I am prepared for almost anything.\"\n\n\"Dr. Upround, my duty compels me to enter largely into minds. Your mind\nis of a lofty order--calm, philosophic, benevolent. You have proved this\nby your kind reception of me, a stranger, almost an intruder. You have\njudged from my manners and appearance, which are shaped considerably by\nthe inner man, that my object was good, large, noble. And yet you have\nnot been quite able to refrain, at weak moments perhaps, but still a\ndozen times a day, from exclaiming in the commune of your heart, 'What\nthe devil does this man want in my parish?'\"\n\n\"My good sir, I never use bad language; and if I did my duty, I should\nnow inflict--\"\n\n\"Five shillings for your poor-box. There it is. And it serves me quite\nright for being too explicit, and forgetting my reverence to the\ncloth. However, I have coarsely expressed your thoughts. Also you have\nfrequently said to yourself, 'This man prates of openness, but I find\nhim closer than any oyster.' Am I right? Yes, I see that I am, by\nyour bow. Very well, you may suppose what pain it gave me to have\nthe privilege of intercourse with a perfect gentleman and an eloquent\ndivine, and yet feel myself in an ambiguous position. In a few words I\nwill clear myself, being now at liberty to indulge that pleasure. I have\nbeen here, as agent for Sir Duncan Yordas, to follow up the long-lost\nclew to his son, and only child, who for very many years was believed\nto be out of all human pursuit. My sanguine and penetrating mind scorned\nrumors, and went in for certainty. I have found Sir Duncan's son, and\nam able to identify him, beyond all doubt, as a certain young man well\nknown to you, and perhaps too widely known, by the name of Robin Lyth.\"\n\nIn spite of the length of his experience of the world, in a place of so\nmany adventures, the rector of Flamborough was astonished, and perhaps\na little vexed as well. If anything was to be found out, in such a\nheadlong way, about one of his parishioners, and notably such a pet\npupil and favorite, the proper thing would have been that he himself\nshould do it. Failing that, he should at least have been consulted,\nenlisted, or at any rate apprised of what was toward. But instead of\nthat, here he had been hoodwinked (by this marvel of incarnate candor\nemployed in the dark about several little things), and then suddenly\nenlightened, when the job was done. Gentle and void of self-importance\nas he was, it misliked him to be treated so.\n\n\"This is a wonderful piece of news,\" he said, as he fixed a calm gaze\nupon the keen, hard eyes of Mordacks. \"You understand your business,\nsir, and would not make such a statement unless you could verify it. But\nI hope that you may not find cause to regret that you have treated me\nwith so little confidence.\"\n\n\"I am not open to that reproach. Dr. Upround, consider my instructions.\nI was strictly forbidden to disclose my object until certainty should\nbe obtained. That being done, I have hastened to apprise you first of\na result which is partly due to your own good offices. Shake hands,\nmy dear sir, and acquit me of rudeness--the last thing of which I am\ncapable.\"\n\nThe rector was mollified, and gave his hand to the gallant general\nfactor. \"Allow me to add my congratulations upon your wonderful\nsuccess,\" he said; \"but would that I had known it some few hours sooner!\nIt might have saved you a vast amount of trouble. I might have kept\nRobin well within your reach. I fear that he is now beyond it.\"\n\n\"I am grieved to hear you say so. But according to my last instructions,\nalthough he is in strict concealment, I can lay hands upon him when the\ntime is ripe.\"\n\n\"I fear not. He sailed last night for the Continent, which is a vague\ndestination, especially in such times as these. But perhaps that was\npart of your skillful contrivance?\"\n\n\"Not so. And for the time it throws me out. I have kept most careful\nwatch on him. But the difficulty was that he might confound my vigilance\nwith that of his enemies; take me for a constable, I mean. And perhaps\nhe has done so, after all. Things have gone luckily for me in the main;\nbut that murder came in most unseasonably. It was the very thing that\nshould have been avoided. Sir Duncan will need all his influence there.\nSuppose for a moment that young Robin did not do it--\"\n\n\"Mr. Mordacks, you frighten me. What else could you suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly--yes. A parishioner of yours, when not engaged unlawfully\nupon the high seas. We heartily hope that he did not do it, and we give\nhim the benefit of the doubt; in which I shared largely, until it became\nso manifest that he was a Yordas. A Yordas has made a point of slaying\nhis man--and sometimes from three to a dozen men--until within the last\ntwo generations. In the third generation the law revives, as is hinted,\nI think, in the Decalogue. In my professional course a large stock of\nhereditary trail--so to speak--comes before me. Some families always\ndrink, some always steal, some never tell lies because they never know a\nfalsehood, some would sell their souls for a sixpence, and these are the\nmost respectable of any--\"\n\n\"My dear sir, my dear sir, I beg your pardon for interrupting you; but\nin my house the rule is to speak well of people, or else to say nothing\nabout them.\"\n\n\"Then you must resign your commission, doctor; for how can you take\ndepositions? But, as I was saying, I should have some hope of the\ninnocence of young Robin if it should turn out that his father, Sir\nDuncan, has destroyed a good many of the native race in India. It may\nreasonably be hoped that he has done so, which would tend very strongly\nto exonerate his son. But the evidence laid before your Worship and\nbefore the coroner was black--black--black.\"\n\n\"My position forbids me to express opinions. The evidence compelled me\nto issue the warrant. But knowing your position, I may show you this, in\nevery word of which I have perfect faith.\"\n\nWith these words Dr. Upround produced the letter which he had received\nlast night, and the general factor took in all the gist of it in less\nthan half a minute.\n\n\"Very good! very good!\" he said, with a smile of experienced\nbenevolence. \"We believe some of it. Our duty is to do so. There are two\npoints of importance in it. One as to the girl he is in love with, and\nthe other his kind liberality to the fellows who will have to bear the\nbrunt of it.\"\n\n\"You speak sarcastically, and I hope unfairly. To my mind, the most\nimportant facts are these--that poor Carroway was shot from behind, and\nthat the smugglers had no fire-arms, except two pistols, both unloaded.\"\n\n\"Who is to prove that, Dr. Upround? Their mouths are closed; and if\nthey were open, would anybody believe them? We knew long ago that the\nvigilant and deservedly lamented officer took the deathblow from behind;\nbut of that how simple is the explanation! The most intelligent of his\ncrew, and apparently his best subordinate, whose name is John Cadman,\ndeposes that his lamented chief turned round for one moment to give an\norder, and during that moment received the shot. His evidence is the\nmore weighty because he does not go too far with it. He does not pretend\nto say who fired. He knows only that one of the smugglers did. His\nevidence will hang those six poor fellows, from the laudable desire of\nthe law to include the right one. But I trust that the right one will be\nfar away.\"\n\n\"I trust not. If even one of them is condemned, even to transportation,\nRobin Lyth will surrender immediately. You doubt it. You smile at the\nidea. Your opinion of human nature is low. Mine is not enthusiastic. But\nI judge others by myself.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Mr. Mordacks answered, with a smile of curious humor. And the\nrector could not help smiling too, at this instance of genuine candor.\n\"However, not to go too deeply into that,\" his visitor continued, \"there\nreally is one point in Robin's letter which demands inquiry. I mean\nabout the guns of the Preventive men. Cadman may be a rogue. Most\nprobably he is. None of the others confirm, although they do not\ncontradict him. Do you know anything about him?\"\n\n\"Only villainy--in another way. Ho led away a nice girl of this parish,\nan industrious mussel-gatherer. And he then had a wife and large family\nof his own, of which the poor thing knew nothing. Her father nearly\nkilled him; and I was compelled (very much against my will) to inflict\na penalty. Cadman is very shy of Flamborough now. By-the-way, have you\ncalled upon poor Widow Carroway?\"\n\n\"I thank you for the hint. She is the very person. It will be a sad\nintrusion; and I have put it off as long as possible. After what Robin\nsays, it is most important. I hope that Sir Duncan will be here very\nshortly. He is coming from Yarmouth in his own yacht. Matters are\ncrowding upon me very fast. I will see Mrs. Carroway as soon as it is\ndecent. Good-morning, and best thanks to your Worship.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE DEMON OF THE AXE\n\n\nThe air was sad and heavy thus, with discord, doubt, and death\nitself gathering and descending, like the clouds of long night, upon\nFlamborough. But far away, among the mountains and the dreary moorland,\nthe \"intake\" of the coming winter was a great deal worse to see. For\nhere no blink of the sea came up, no sunlight under the sill of clouds\n(as happens where wide waters are), but rather a dark rim of brooding on\nthe rough horizon seemed to thicken itself against the light under the\nsullen march of vapors--the muffled funeral of the year. Dry trees and\nnaked crags stood forth, and the dirge of the wind went to and fro, and\nthere was no comfort out-of-doors.\n\nSoon the first snow of the winter came, the first abiding earnest snow,\nfor several skits had come before, and ribbed with white the mountain\nbreasts. But nobody took much heed of that, except to lean over the\nplough, while it might be sped, or to want more breakfast. Well resigned\nwas everybody to the stoppage of work by winter. It was only what must\nbe every year, and a gracious provision of Providence. If a man earned\nvery little money, that was against him in one way, but encouraged him\nin another. It brought home to his mind the surety that others would\nbe kind to him; not with any sense of gift, but a large good-will of\nsharing.\n\nBut the first snow that visits the day, and does not melt in its own\ncold tears, is a sterner sign for every one. The hardened wrinkle, and\nthe herring-bone of white that runs among the brown fern fronds, the\ncrisp defiant dazzle on the walks, and the crust that glitters on the\npatient branch, and the crest curling under the heel of a gate, and the\nridge piled up against the tool-house door--these, and the shivering\nwind that spreads them, tell of a bitter time in store.\n\nThe ladies of Scargate Hall looked out upon such a December afternoon.\nThe massive walls of their house defied all sudden change of\ntemperature, and nothing less than a week of rigor pierced the comfort\nof their rooms. The polished oak beams overhead glanced back the merry\nfire-glow, the painted walls shone with rosy tints, and warm lights\nflitting along them, and the thick-piled carpet yielded back a velvety\nsense of luxury. It was nice to see how bleak the crags were, and the\nsad trees laboring beneath the wind and snow.\n\n\"If it were not for thinking of the poor cold people, for whom one feels\nso deeply,\" said the gentle Mrs. Carnaby, with a sweet soft sigh, \"one\nwould rather enjoy this dreary prospect. I hope there will be a deep\nsnow to-night. There is every sign of it upon the scaurs. And then,\nPhilippa, only think--no post, no plague of news, no prospect of even\nthat odious Jellicorse! Once more we shall have our meals in quiet.\"\n\nMrs. Carnaby loved a good dinner right well, a dinner unplagued by\nhospitable cares; when a woodcock was her own to dwell on, and pretty\nlittle teeth might pick a pretty little bone at ease.\n\n\"Eliza, you are always such a creature of the moment,\" Mistress Yordas\nanswered, indulgently; \"you do love the good things of the world too\nmuch. How would you like to be out there, in a naked little cottage\nwhere the wind howls through, and the ewer is frozen every morning? And\nwhere, if you ever get anything to eat--\"\n\n\"Philippa, I implore you not to be so dreadful. One never can utter the\nmost commonplace reflection--and you know that I said I was sorry for\nthe people.\"\n\n\"My object is good, as you ought to know. My object is to habituate your\nmind--\"\n\n\"Philippa, I beg you once more to confine your exertions, in that way,\nto your own more lofty mind. Again I refuse to have my mind, or\nwhatever it is that does duty for it, habituated to anything. A gracious\nProvidence knows that I should die outright, after all my blameless\nlife, if reduced to those horrible straits you always picture. And I\nhave too much faith in a gracious Providence to conceive for one moment\nthat it would treat me so. I decline the subject. Why should we\nmake such troubles? There is clear soup for dinner, and some lovely\nsweet-breads. Cook has got a new receipt for bread sauce, and Jordas\nsays that he never did shoot such a woodcock.\"\n\n\"Eliza, I trust that you may enjoy them all; your appetite is delicate,\nand you require nourishment. Why, what do I see over yonder in the snow?\nA slim figure moving at a very great pace, and avoiding the open places!\nAre my eyes growing old, or is it Lancelot?\"\n\n\"Pet out in such weather, Philippa! Such a thing is simply impossible.\nOr at any rate I should hope so. You know that Jordas was obliged to put\na set of curtains from end to end even of the bowling-alley, which is\nso beautifully sheltered; and even then poor Pet was sneezing. And you\nshould have heard what he said to me, when I was afraid of the sheets\ntaking fire from his warming-pan one night. Pet is unaccountable\nsometimes, I know. But the very last thing imaginable of him is that he\nshould put his pretty feet into the snow.\"\n\n\"You know him best, Eliza; and it is very puzzling to distinguish things\nin snow. But if it was not Pet, why, it must have been a squirrel.\"\n\n\"The squirrels are gone to sleep for the winter, Philippa. I dare say it\nwas only Jordas. Don't you think that it must have been Jordas?\"\n\n\"I am quite certain that it was not Jordas. But I will not pretend to\nsay that it was not a squirrel. He may forego his habitudes more easily\nthan Lancelot.\"\n\n\"How horribly dry you are sometimes, Philippa. There seems to be no\nsoftness in your nature. You are fit to do battle with fifty lawyers;\nand I pity Mr. Jellicorse, with his best clothes on.\"\n\n\"You could commit no greater error. We pay the price of his black silk\nstockings three times over, every time we see him. The true objects of\npity are--you, I, and the estates.\"\n\n\"Well, let us drop it for a while. If you begin upon that nauseous\nsubject, not a particle of food will pass my lips; and I did look\nforward to a little nourishment.\"\n\n\"Dinner, my ladies!\" cried the well-appointed Welldrum, throwing open\nthe door as only such a man can do, while cleverly accomplishing the\nnecessary bow, which he clinched on such occasions with a fine smack of\nhis lips.\n\n\"Go and tell Mr. Lancelot, if you please, that we are waiting for him.\"\nA great point was made, but not always effected, of having Master Pet,\nin very gorgeous attire, to lead his aunt into the dining-room. It\nwas fondly believed that this impressed him with the elegance and nice\nhumanities required by his lofty position and high walk in life. Pet\nhated this performance, and generally spoiled it by making a face over\nhis shoulder at old Welldrum, while he strode along in real or mock awe\nof Aunt Philippa.\n\n\"If you please, my ladies,\" said the butler now, choosing Mrs. Carnaby\nfor his eyes to rest on, \"Mr. Lancelot beg to be excoosed of dinner. His\nhead is that bad that he have gone for open air.\"\n\n\"Snow-headache is much in our family; Eliza, you remember how our dear\nfather used to feel it.\" With these words Mistress Yordas led her sister\nto the dining-room; and they took good care to say nothing more about it\nbefore the officious Welldrum.\n\nPet meanwhile was beginning to repent of his cold and lonely venture.\nFor a mile or two the warmth of his mind and the glow of exercise\nsustained him; and he kept on admiring his own courage till his feet\nbegan to tingle. \"Insie will be bound to kiss me now; and she never will\nbe able to laugh at me again,\" he said to himself some fifty times.\n\"I am like the great poet who describes the snow; and I have got some\ncherry-brandy.\" He trudged on very bravely; but his poor dear toes at\nevery step grew colder. Out upon the moor, where he was now, no shelter\nof any kind encouraged him; no mantlet of bank, or ridge, or brush-wood,\nset up a furry shiver betwixt him and the tatterdemalion wind. Not even\na naked rock stood up to comfort a man by looking colder than himself.\n\nBut in truth there was no severe cold yet; no depth of snow, no\nintensity of frost, no splintery needles of sparkling drift; but only\nthe beginning of the wintry time, such as makes a strong man pick his\nfeet up, and a healthy boy start an imaginary slide. The wind, however,\nwas shrewd and searching, and Lancelot was accustomed to a warming-pan.\nInside his waistcoat he wore a hare-skin, and his heart began to give\nrapid thumps against it. He knew that he was going into bodily peril\nworse than any frost or snow.\n\nFor a long month he had not even seen his Insie, and his hot young heart\nhad never before been treated so contemptuously. He had been allowed to\nshow himself in the gill at his regular interval, a fortnight ago. But\nno one had ventured forth to meet him, or even wave signal of welcome\nor farewell. But that he could endure, because he had been warned not to\nhope for much that Friday; now, however, it was not his meaning to\nput up with any more such nonsense. That he, who had been told by the\nservants continually that all the land for miles and miles around was\nhis, should be shut out like a beggar, and compelled to play bo-peep, by\npeople who lived in a hole in the ground, was a little more than in the\nwhole entire course of his life he could ever have imagined. His mind\nwas now made up to let them know who he was and what he was; and unless\nthey were very quick in coming to their senses, Jordas should have\norders to turn them out, and take Insie altogether away from them.\n\nBut in spite of all brave thoughts and words, Master Pet began to spy\nabout very warily, ere ever he descended from the moor into the gill.\nHe seemed to have it borne in upon his mind that territorial\nrights--however large and goodly--may lead only to a taste of earth,\nwhen earth alone is witness to the treatment of her claimant. Therefore\nit behooved him to look sharp; and possessing the family gift of keen\nsight, he began to spy about, almost as shrewdly as if he had been\neducated in free trade. But first he had wit enough to step below the\nbreak, and get behind a gorse bush, lest haply he should illustrate only\nthe passive voice of seeing.\n\nIn the deep cut of the glen there was very little snow, only a few veins\nand patches here and there, threading and seaming the steep, as if a\nwhite-footed hare had been coursing about. Little stubby brier shoots,\nand clumps of russet bracken, and dead heather, ruffling like a brown\ndog's back, broke the dull surface of withered herbage, thistle stumps,\nteasels, rugged banks, and naked brush. Down in the bottom the noisy\nbrook was scurrying over its pebbles brightly, or plunging into gloom of\nits own production; and away at the bend of the valley was seen the cot\nof poor Lancelot's longing.\n\nThe situation was worth a sigh, and came half way to share one; Pet\nsighed heavily, and deeply felt how wrong it was of any one to treat him\nso. What could be easier for him than to go, as Insie had said to him\nat least a score of times, and mind his own business, and shake off the\ndust--or the mud--of his feet at such strangers? But, alas! he had\ntried it, and could shake nothing, except his sad and sapient head. How\ndeplorably was he altered from the Pet that used to be! Where were\nnow his lofty joys, the pleasure he found in wholesome mischief and\nwholesale destruction, the high delight of frightening all the world\nabout his safety?\n\n\"There are people here, I do believe,\" he said to himself, most\ntouchingly, \"who would be quite happy to chop off my head!\"\n\nAs if to give edge to so murderous a thought, and wings to the feet of\nthe thinker, a man both tall and broad came striding down the cottage\ngarden. He was swinging a heavy axe as if it were a mere dress cane, and\nnow and then dealing clean slash of a branch, with an air which made Pet\nshiver worse than any wind. The poor lad saw that in the grasp of such\na man he could offer less resistance than a nut within the crackers, and\neven his champion, the sturdy Jordas, might struggle without much avail.\nHe gathered in his legs, and tucked his head well under the gorse to\nwatch him.\n\n\"Surely he is too big to run very fast,\" thought the boy, with his valor\nevaporated; \"it must be that horrible Maunder. What a blessing that I\nstopped up here just in time! He is going up the gill to cleave some\nwood. Shall I cut away at once, or lie flat upon my stomach? He would\nbe sure to see me if I tried to run away; and much he would care for his\nlandlord!\"\n\nIn such a choice of evils, poor Lancelot resolved to lie still, unless\nthe monster should turn his steps that way. And presently he had the\nheart-felt pleasure of seeing the formidable stranger take the track\nthat followed the windings of the brook. But instead of going well away,\nand rounding the next corner, the big man stopped at the very spot where\nInsie used to fill her pitcher, pulled off his coat and hung it on a\nbush, and began with mighty strokes to fell a dead alder-tree that stood\nthere. As his great arms swung, and his back rose and fell, and the sway\nof his legs seemed to shake the bank, and the ring of his axe filled\nthe glen with echoes, wrath and terror were fighting a hot battle in the\nheart of Lancelot.\n\nHis sense of a land-owner's rights and titles had always been most\nimperious, and though the Scargate estates were his as yet only in\nremainder, he was even more jealous about them than if he held them\nalready in possession. What right had this man to cut down trees, to\nfell and appropriate timber? Even in the garden which he rented he could\nnot rightfully touch a stick or stock. But to come out here, a good\nfurlong from his renting, and begin hacking and hewing, quite as if the\nland were his--it seemed almost too brazen-faced for belief! It must be\nstopped at once--such outrageous trespass stopped, and punished sternly.\nHe would stride down the hill with a summary veto--but, alas, if he did,\nhe might get cut down too!\n\nNot only this disagreeable reflection, but also his tender regard for\nInsie, prevented him from challenging this process of the axe; but his\nfeelings began to goad him toward something worthy of a Yordas--for a\nYordas he always accounted himself, and not by any means a Carnaby. And\nto this end all the powers of his home conspired.\n\n\"That fellow is terribly big and strong,\" he said to himself, with much\nwarmth of spirit; \"but his axe is getting dull; and to chop down that\ntree of mine will take him at least half an hour. Dead wood is harder to\ncut than live. And when he has done that, he must work till dark to\nlop the branches, and so on. I need not be afraid of anybody but this\nfellow. Now is my time, then, while he is away. Even if the old folk are\nat home, they will listen to my reasons. The next time he comes to hack\nmy tree on this side, I shall slip out, and go down to the cottage. I\nhave no fear of any one that pays any heed to reason.\"\n\nThis sudden admirer and lover of reason cleverly carried out his bold\ndiscretion. For now the savage woodman, intent upon that levelling which\nis the highest glory of pugnacious minds, came round the tree, glaring\nat it (as if it were the murderer, and he the victim), redoubling his\ntremendous thwacks at every sign of tremor, flinging his head back with\na spiteful joy, poising his shoulders on the swing, and then with all\nhis weight descending into the trenchant blow. When his back was fairly\nturned on Lancelot, and his whole mind and body thus absorbed upon his\nprey, the lad rose quickly from his lair, and slipped over the crest of\nthe gill to the moorland. In a moment he was out of sight to that demon\nof the axe, and gliding, with his head bent low, along a little hollow\nof the heathery ground, which cut off a bend of the ravine, and again\nstruck its brink a good furlong down the gill. Here Pet stopped running,\nand lay down, and peered over the brink, for this part was quite new to\nhim, and resolved as he was to make a bold stroke of it, he naturally\nwished to see how the land lay, and what the fortress of the enemy was\nlike, ere ever he ventured into it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nBATTERY AND ASSUMPSIT\n\n\nThat little moorland glen, whose only murmur was of wavelets, and\nprincipal traffic of birds and rabbits, even at this time of year\nlooked pretty, with the winter light winding down its shelter and soft\nquietude. Ferny pitches and grassy bends set off the harsh outline of\nrock and shale, while a white mist (quivering like a clew above the\nrivulet) was melting into the faint blue haze diffused among the\nfoldings and recesses of the land. On the hither side, nearly at the\nbottom of the slope, a bright green spot among the brown and yellow\nroughness, looking by comparison most smooth and rich, showed where the\nlittle cottage grew its vegetables, and even indulged in a small attempt\nat fruit. Behind this, the humble retirement of the cot was shielded\nfrom the wind by a breastwork of bold rock, fringed with ground-ivy,\nhanging broom, and silver stars of the carline. So simple and low was\nthe building, and so matched with the colors around it, that but for\nthe smoke curling up from a pipe of red pottery-ware, a stranger might\nalmost have overlooked it. The walls were made from the rocks close by,\nthe roof of fir slabs thatched with ling; there was no upper story, and\n(except the door and windows) all the materials seemed native and at\nhome. Lancelot had heard, by putting a crafty question in safe places,\nthat the people of the gill here had built their own dwelling, a good\nmany years ago; and it looked as if they could have done it easily.\n\nNow, if he intended to spy out the land, and the house as well, before\nthe giant of the axe returned, there was no time to lose in beginning.\nHe had a good deal of sagacity in tricks, and some practice in little\narts of robbery. For before he attained to this exalted state of mind\none of his favorite pastimes had been a course of stealthy raids upon\nthe pears in Scargate garden. He might have had as many as he liked for\nasking; but what flavor would they have thus possessed? Moreover, he\nbore a noble spite against the gardener, whose special pride was in that\npear wall; and Pet more than once had the joy of beholding him thrash\nhis own innocent son for the dark disappearance of Beurre and Bergamot.\nMaking good use of this experience, he stole his way down the steep\nglen-side, behind the low fence of the garden, until he reached the\nbottom, and the brush-wood by the stream. Here he stopped to observe\nagain, and breathe, and get his spirit up. The glassy water looked as\ncold as death; and if he got cramp in his feet, how could he run? And\nyet he could see no other way but wading, of approaching the cottage\nunperceived.\n\nNow fortune (whose privilege it is to cast mortals into the holes that\nmost misfit them) sometimes, when she has got them there, takes pity,\nand contemptuously lifts them. Pet was in a hole of hardship, such as\nhis dear mamma never could have dreamed of, and such as his nurture and\nconstitution made trebly disastrous for him. He had taken a chill from\nhis ambush, and fright, and the cold wind over the snow of the moor; and\nnow the long wading of that icy water might have ended upon the shores\nof Acheron. However, he was just about to start upon that passage--for\nthe spirit of his race was up--when a dull grating sound, as of\nfootsteps crunching grit, came to his prettily concave ears.\n\nAt this sound Lancelot Carnaby stopped from his rash venture into the\nwater, and drew himself back into an ivied bush, which served as the\nfinial of the little garden hedge. Peeping through this, he could see\nthat the walk from the cottage to the hedge was newly sprinkled with\ngray wood ash, perhaps to prevent the rain from lodging and the snow\nfrom lying there. Heavy steps of two old men (as Pet in the insolence\nof young days called them) fell upon the dull soft crust, and ground\nit, heel and toe--heel first, as stiff joints have it--with the bruising\nsnip a hungry cow makes, grazing wiry grasses. \"One of them must be\nInsie's dad,\" said Pet to himself, as he crouched more closely behind\nthe hedge; \"which of them, I wonder? Well, the tall one, I suppose, to\ngo by the height of that Maunder. And the other has only one arm; and a\nman with one arm could never have built their house. They are coming to\nsit on that bench; I shall hear every word they say, and learn some\nof their secrets that I never could get out of Insie one bit of. But I\nwonder who that other fellow is?\"\n\nThat other fellow, in spite of his lease, would promptly have laid his\nsurviving hand to the ear of Master Lancelot, or any other eavesdropper;\nfor a sturdy and resolute man was he, being no less than our ancient\nfriend and old soldier, Jack of the Smithies. And now was verified that\nhomely proverb that listeners never hear good of themselves.\n\n\"Sit down, my friend,\" said the elder of the twain, a man of rough dress\nand hard hands, but good, straightforward aspect, and that careless\nhumor which generally comes from a life of adventures, and a long\nacquaintance with the world's caprice. \"I have brought you here that we\nmay be undisturbed. Little pitchers have long ears. My daughter is as\ntrue as steel; but this matter is not for her at present. You are sure,\nthen, that Sir Duncan is come home at last? And he wished that I should\nknow it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he wished that you should know it. So soon as I told him that\nyou was here, and leading what one may call this queer life, he slapped\nhis thigh like this here--for he hath a downright way of everything--and\nhe said, 'Now, Smithies, so soon as you get home, go and tell him that I\nam coming. I can trust him as I trust myself; and glad I am for one\nold friend in the parts I am such a stranger to. Years and years I have\nlonged to know what was become of my old friend Bert.' Tears was in his\neyes, your honor: Sir Duncan hath seen such a mighty lot of men, that\nhis heart cometh up to the few he hath found deserving of the name,\nsir.\"\n\n\"You said that you saw him at York, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, at the business house of his agent, one Master Geoffrey\nMordacks. He come there quite unexpected, I believe, to see about\nsomething else he hath in hand, and I got a message to go there at once.\nI save his life once in India, sir, from one of they cursed Sours, which\nmade him take heed of me, and me of him. And then it come out where\nI come from, and why; and the both of us spoke the broad Yorkshire\ntogether, like as I dea naa care to do to home. After that he got on\nwonderful, as you know; and I stuck to him through the whole of it, from\nluck as well as liking, till, if I had gone out to see to his breeches,\nI could not very well have knowed more of him. And I tell you, sir, not\nto regard him for a Yordas. He hath a mind far above them lot; though I\nwas born under them, to say so!\"\n\n\"And you think that he will come and recover his rights, in spite of his\nfather's will against him. I know nothing of the ladies of the Hall; but\nit seems a hard thing to turn them out, after being there so long.\"\n\n\"Who was turned out first, they or him? Five-and-twenty years of tent,\nopen sky, jungle, and who knows what, for him--but eider-down, and\nfireside, and fat of land for them! No, no, sir; whatever shall happen\nthere, will be God's own justice.\"\n\n\"Of His justice who shall judge?\" said Insie's father, quietly. \"But is\nthere not a young man grown, who passes for the heir with every one?\"\n\n\"Ay, that there is; and the best game of all will be neck and crop\nfor that young scamp. A bully, a coward, a puling milksop, is all the\ncharacter he beareth. He giveth himself born airs, as if every inch\nof the Riding belonged to him. He hath all the viciousness of Yordas,\nwithout the pluck to face it out. A little beast that hath the venom,\nwithout the courage, of a toad. Ah, how I should like to see--\"\n\nJack of the Smithies not only saw, but felt. The Yordas blood was up in\nPet. He leaped through the hedge and struck this man with a sharp quick\nfist in either eye. Smithies fell backward behind the bench, his heels\ndanced in the air, and the stump of his arm got wedged in the stubs of a\nbush, while Lancelot glared at him with mad eyes.\n\n\"What next?\" said his companion, rising calmly, and steadfastly gazing\nat Lancelot.\n\n\"The next thing is to kill him; and it shall be done,\" the furious youth\nreplied, while he swung the gentleman's big stick, which he had seized,\nand danced round his foe with the speed of a wild-cat. \"Don't meddle, or\nit will be worse for you. You heard what he said of me. Get out of the\nway.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my young friend, I shall do nothing of the sort.\" But the old\nman was not at all sure that he could do much; such was the fury and\nagility of the youth, who jumped three yards for every step of his,\nwhile the poor old soldier could not move. The boy skipped round the\nprotecting figure, whose grasp he eluded easily, and swinging the staff\nwith both arms, aimed a great blow at the head of his enemy. Suddenly\nthe other interposed the bench, upon which the stick fell, and broke\nshort; and before the assailant could recover from the jerk, he was a\nprisoner in two powerful old arms.\n\n\"You are so wild that we must make you fast,\" his captor said, with\na benignant smile; and struggle as he might, the boy was very soon\nsecured. His antagonist drew forth a red bandana handkerchief, and\nfastened his bleeding hands behind his back. \"There, now, lad,\" he said,\n\"you can do no mischief. Recover your temper, sir, and tell us who you\nare, as soon as you are sane enough to know.\"\n\nPet, having spent his just indignation, began to perceive that he\nhad made a bad investment. His desire had been to maintain in this\nparticular spot strict privacy from all except Insie, to whom in the\nlargeness of love he had declared himself. Yet here he stood, promulged\nand published, strikingly and flagrantly pronounced! At first he was\nlike to sulk in the style of a hawk who has failed of his swoop; but\nseeing his enemy arising slowly with grunts, and action nodose and\nangular--rather than flexibly graceful--contempt became the uppermost\nfeature of his mind.\n\n\"My name,\" he said, \"if you are not afraid of it, that you tie me in\nthis cowardly low manner, is--Lancelot Yordas Carnaby.\"\n\n\"My boy, it is a long name for any one to carry. No wonder that you look\nweak beneath it. And where do you live, young gentleman?\"\n\nAmazement sat upon the face of Pet--a genuine astonishment, entirely\npure from wrath. It was wholly beyond his imagination that any one,\nafter hearing his name, should have to ask him where he lived. He\nthought that the question must be put in low mockery, and to answer was\nfar beneath his dignity.\n\nBy this time the veteran Jack of the Smithies had got out of his trap,\nand was standing stiffly, passing his hand across his sadly smitten\neyes, and talking to himself about them.\n\n\"Two black eyes, at my time of life, as sure as I'm a Christian!\nHowsomever, young chap, I likes you better. Never dreamed there was such\ngood stuff in you. Master Bert, cast him loose, if so please you. Let me\nshake hands with 'un, and bear no malice. Bad words deserve hard blows,\nand I ask his pardon for driving him into it. I called 'un a milksop,\nand he hath proved me a liar. He may be a bad 'un, but with good stuff\nin 'un. Lord bless me, I never would have believed the lad could hit so\nsmartly!\"\n\nPet was well pleased with this tribute to his prowess; but as for\nshaking hands with a tenant, and a \"common man\"--as every one not of\ngentle birth was then called--such an act was quite below him, or above\nhim, according as we take his own opinion, or the truth. And possibly he\nrose in Smithies' mind by drawing back from bodily overture.\n\nMr. Bert looked on with all the bliss of an ancient interpreter. He\ncould follow out the level of the vein of each, as no one may do except\na gentleman, perhaps, who has turned himself deliberately into a \"common\nman.\" Bert had done his utmost toward this end; but the process is\ndifficult when voluntary.\n\n\"I think it is time,\" he now said, firmly, to the unshackled and\ntriumphant Pet, \"for Lancelot Yordas Carnaby to explain what has brought\nhim into such humble quarters, and induced him to turn eavesdropper;\nwhich was not considered (at least in my young days) altogether the part\nof a gentleman.\"\n\nThe youth had not seen quite enough of the world to be pat with a\nfertile lie as yet; especially under such searching eyes. However, he\ndid as much as could be well expected.\n\n\"I was just looking over my property,\" he said, \"and I thought I heard\nsomebody cutting down my timber. I came to see who it was, and I heard\npeople talking, and before I could ask them about it, I heard myself\nabused disgracefully; and that was more than I could stand.\"\n\n\"We must take it for granted that a brave young gentleman of your\nposition would tell no falsehood. You assure us, on your honor, that you\nheard no more?\"\n\n\"Well, I heard voices, sir. But nothing to understand, or make head or\ntail of.\" There was some truth in this; for young Lancelot had not the\nleast idea who \"Sir Duncan\" was. His mother and aunt had kept him wholly\nin the dark as to any lost uncle in India. \"I should like to know what\nit was,\" he added, \"if it has anything to do with me.\"\n\nThis was a very clever hit of his; and it made the old gentleman believe\nhim altogether.\n\n\"All in good time, my young friend,\" he answered, even with a smile of\nsome pity for the youth. \"But you are scarcely old enough for business\nquestions, although so keen about your timber. Now after abusing you so\ndisgracefully, as I admit that my friend here has done, and after roping\nyour pugnacious hands, as I myself was obliged to do, we never can\nlaunch you upon the moor, in such weather as this, without some food.\nYou are not very strong, and you have overdone yourself. Let us go to\nthe house, and have something.\"\n\nJack of the Smithies showed alacrity at this, as nearly all old soldiers\nmust; but Pet was much oppressed with care, and the intellect in his\nbreast diverged into sore distraction of anxious thought. Whether should\nhe draw the keen sword of assurance, put aside the others, and see\nInsie, or whether should he start with best foot foremost, scurry up the\nhill, and avoid the axe of Maunder? Pallas counselled this course, and\nAphrodite that; and the latter prevailed, as she always used to do,\nuntil she produced the present dry-cut generation.\n\nLancelot bowed to the gentleman of the gill, and followed him along the\ntrack of grit, which set his little pearly teeth on edge; while Jack\nof the Smithies led, and formed, the rear-guard. \"This is coming now\nto something very queer,\" thought Pet; \"after all, it might have been\nbetter for me to take my chance with the hatchet man.\"\n\nBrown dusk was ripely settling down among the mossy apple-trees, and the\nleafless alders of the brook, and the russet and yellow memories of late\nautumn lingering in the glen, while the peaky little freaks of snow,\nand the cold sighs of the wind, suggested fireside and comfort. Mr. Bert\nthrew open his cottage door, and bowing as to a welcome guest, invited\nPet to enter. No passage, no cold entrance hall, demanded scrapes of\nceremony; but here was the parlor, and the feeding-place, and the warm\ndance of the fire-glow. Logs that meant to have a merry time, and spread\na cheerful noise abroad, ere ever they turned to embers, were snorting\nforth the pointed flames, and spitting soft protests of sap. And before\nthem stood, with eyes more bright than any flash of fire-light, intent\nupon rich simmering scents, a lovely form, a grace of dainties--oh, a\ngoddess certainly!\n\n\"Master Carnaby,\" said the host, \"allow me, sir, the honor to present\nmy daughter to you, Insie darling, this is Mr. Lancelot Yordas Carnaby.\nMake him a pretty courtesy.\"\n\nInsie turned round with a rosy blush, brighter than the brightest\nfire-wood, and tried to look at Pet as if she had never even dreamed\nof such a being. Pet drew hard upon his heart, and stood bewildered,\ntranced, and dazzled. He had never seen Insie in-doors before, which\nmakes a great difference in a girl; and the vision was too bright for\nhim.\n\nFor here, at her own hearth, she looked so gentle, sweet, and lovely. No\nlonger wild and shy, or gayly mischievous and watchful, but calm-eyed,\nfirm-lipped, gravely courteous; intent upon her father's face, and\nbanishing not into shadow so much as absolute nullity any one who\ndreamed that he ever filled a pitcher for her, or fed her with grouse\nand partridge, and committed the incredible atrocity of kissing her.\n\nLancelot ceased to believe it possible that he ever could have done such\na thing as that, while he saw how she never would see him at all, or\ntalk in the voice that he had been accustomed to, or even toss her head\nin the style he had admired, when she tried to pretend to make light\nof him. If she would only make light of him now, he would be well\ncontented, and say to himself that she did it on purpose, for fear\nof the opposite extreme. But the worst of it was that she had quite\nforgotten, beyond blink of inquiry or gleam of hope, that ever in her\nlife she had set eyes on a youth of such perfect insignificance before.\n\n\"My friend, you ought to be hungry,\" said Bert of the Gill, as he was\nproud to call himself; \"after your exploit you should be fed. Your\nvanquished foe will sit next to you. Insie, you are harassed in mind by\nthe countenance of our old friend Master John Smithies. He has met with\na little mishap--never mind--the rising generation is quick of temper.\nA soldier respects his victor; it is a beautiful arrangement of\nProvidence; otherwise wars would never cease. Now give our two guests a\ngood dish of the best, piping hot, and of good meaty fibre. We will have\nour own supper by-and-by, when Maunder comes home, and your mother is\nready. Gentlemen, fall to; you have far to go, and the moors are bad\nafter night-fall.\"\n\nLancelot, proudly as he stood upon his rank, saw fit to make no\nobjection. Not only did his inner man cry, \"Feed, even though a common\nman feed with thee,\" but his mind was under the influence of a stronger\none, which scorned such stuff. Moreover, Insie, for the first time, gave\nhim a glance, demure but imperative, which meant, \"Obey my father, sir.\"\n\nHe obeyed, and was rewarded; for the beautiful girl came round him so,\nto hand whatever he wanted, and seemed to feel so sweetly for him in his\nstrange position, that he scarcely knew what he was eating, only that it\nsavored of rich rare love, and came from the loveliest creature in the\nworld. In stern fact, it came from the head of a sheep; but neither jaws\nnor teeth were seen. Upon one occasion he was almost sure that a curl\nof Insie's lovely hair fell upon the back of his stooping neck; he could\nscarcely keep himself from jumping up; and he whispered, very softly,\nwhen the old man was away, \"Oh, if you would only do that again!\" But\nhis darling made manifest that this was a mistake, and applied herself\nsedulously to the one-armed Jack.\n\nJack of the Smithies was a trencherman of the very first order, and\nbeing well wedded (with a promise already of young soldiers to come),\nit behooved him to fill all his holes away from home, and spare his own\ncupboard for the sake of Mistress Smithies. He perceived the duty, and\nperformed it, according to the discipline of the British army.\n\nBut Insie was fretting in the conscience of her heart to get the young\nLancelot fed and dismissed before the return of her great wild brother.\nNot that he would hurt their guest, though unwelcome; or even show any\nsort of rudeness to him; but more than ever now, since she heard of\nPet's furious onslaught upon the old soldier--which made her begin to\nrespect him a little--she longed to prevent any meeting between this\ngallant and the rough Maunder. And that anxiety led her to look at Pet\nwith a melancholy kindness. Then Jack of the Smithies cut things short.\n\n\"Off's the word,\" he said, \"if ever I expects to see home afore\ndaylight. All of these moors is known to me, and many's the time I have\ntracked them all in sleep, when the round world was betwixt us. But\nwithout any moon it is hard to do 'em waking; and the loss of my arm\nsends me crooked in the dark. And as for young folk, they be all abroad\nto once. With your leave, Master Bert, I'll be off immediate, after\ngetting all I wants, as the manner of the world is. My good missus will\nbe wondering what is come of me.\"\n\n\"You have spoken well,\" his host replied; \"and I think we shall have a\nheavy fall to-night. But this young gentleman must not go home alone. He\nis not robust, and the way is long and rough. I have seen him shivering\nseveral times. I will fetch my staff, and march with him.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I will not have such a thing done,\" the veteran answered,\nsturdily. \"If the young gentleman is a gentleman, he will not be afraid\nfor me to take him home, in spite of what he hath done to me. Speak up,\nyoung man, are you frightened of me?\"\n\n\"Not if you are not afraid of me,\" said Pet, who had now forgotten all\nabout that Maunder, and only longed to stay where he was, and set up a\ndelicious little series of glances. For the room, and the light, and the\ntenor of the place, began more and more to suit such uses. And most and\nbest of all, his Insie was very thankful to him for his good behavior;\nand he scarcely could believe that she wanted him to go. To go, however,\nwas his destiny; and when he had made a highly laudable and far-away\nsalute, it happened--in the shift of people, and of light, and clothing,\nwhich goes on so much in the winter-time--that a little hand came into\nhis, and rose to his lips, with ground of action, not for assault and\nbattery, but simply for assumpsit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nSTORMY GAP\n\n\nSnowy weather now set in, and people were content to stay at home. Among\nthe scaurs and fells and moors the most perturbed spirit was compelled\nto rest, or try to do so, or at any rate not agitate its body\nout-of-doors. Lazy folk were suited well with reason good for laziness;\nand gentle minds, that dreaded evil, gladly found its communication\nstopped.\n\nCombined excitement and exertion, strong amazement, ardent love, and a\ncold of equal severity, laid poor Pet Carnaby by the heels, and reduced\nhim to perpetual gruel. He was shut off from external commune, and\nstrictly blockaded in his bedroom, where his only attendants were his\nsweet mother, and an excellent nurse who stroked his forehead, and\ncalled him \"dear pet,\" till he hated her, and, worst of all, that Dr.\nSpraggs, who lived in the house, because the weather was so bad.\n\n\"We have taken a chill, and our mind is a little unhinged,\" said\nthe skillful practitioner: \"careful diet, complete repose, a warm\nsurrounding atmosphere, absence of undue excitement, and, above all, a\ncourse of my gentle alteratives regularly administered--these are the\nvery simple means to restore our beloved patient. He is certainly making\nprogress; but I assure you, my dear madam, or rather I need not tell a\nlady of such wonderfully clear perception, that remedial measures must\nbe slow to be truly efficacious. With lower organizations we may deal in\na more empiric style; but no experiments must be tried here--\"\n\n\"Dr. Spraggs, I should hope not, indeed. You alarm me by the mere\nsuggestion.\"\n\n\"Gradation, delicately pursued, adapted subtly, discriminated nicely by\nthe unerring diagnosis of extensive medical experience, combined with\ndeep study of the human system, and a highly distinguished university\ncareer--such, madam, are, in my humble opinion, the true elements\nof permanent amelioration. At the same time we must not conceal\nfrom ourselves that our constitution is by no means one of ordinary\norganization. None of your hedger and ditcher class, but delicate,\nfragile, impulsive, sensitive, liable to inopine derangements from\nexcessive activity of mind--\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Spraggs, he has been reading poetry, which none of our family\never even dreamed of doing--it is a young man, over your way somewhere.\nPossibly you may have heard of him.\"\n\n\"That young man has a great deal to answer for. I have traced a very bad\ncase of whooping-cough to him. That explains many symptoms which I could\nnot quite make out. We will take away this book, madam, and give him\nDr. Watts--the only wholesome poet that our country has produced; though\neven his opinions would be better expressed in prose.\"\n\nBut the lad, in spite of all this treatment, slowly did recover, and\nthen obtained relief, which set him on his nimble legs again. For\nhis aunt Philippa, one snowy morning, went into the room beneath that\ndesperately sick chamber, to see whether wreaths of snow had entered,\nas they often did, between the loose joints of the casement. She walked\nvery carefully, for fear of making a noise that might be heard above,\nand disturb the repose of the poor invalid. But, to her surprise, there\ncame loud thumps from above, and a quivering of the ceiling, and a sound\nas of rushing steps, and laughter, and uproarious jollity.\n\n\"What can it be? I am perfectly amazed,\" said Mistress Yordas to\nherself. \"I must inquire into this.\"\n\nShe knew that her sister was out of the way, and the nurse in the\nkitchen, having one of her frequent feeds and agreeable discourses.\nSo she went to a mighty ring in her own room, as large as an untaxed\ncarriage wheel, and from it (after due difficulty) took the spare key of\nthe passage door that led the way to Lancelot.\n\nNo sooner had she passed this door than she heard a noise a great deal\nworse than the worst imagination--whiz, and hiss, and crack, and smash,\nand rolling of hollow things over hollow places, varied with shouts, and\nthe flapping of skirts, and jingling of money upon heart of oak; these\nand many other travails of the air (including strong language) amazed\nthe lady. Hastening into the sick-room, she found the window wide open,\nwith the snow pouring in, a dozen of phial bottles ranged like skittles,\nsome full and some empty, and Lancelot dancing about in his night-gown,\nwith Divine Songs poised for another hurl.\n\n\"Two for a full, and one for an empty. Seven to me, and four to you. No\ncheating, now, or I'll knock you over,\" he was shouting to Welldrum's\nboy, who had clearly been smuggled in at the window for this game.\n\"There's plenty more in old Spraggs's chest. Holloa, here's Aunt\nPhilippa!\"\n\nMistress Yordas was not displeased with this spirited application of\npharmacy; she at once flung wide the passage door, and Pet was free of\nthe house again, but upon parole not to venture out of doors. The\nfirst use he made of his liberty was to seek the faithful Jordas, who\npossessed a little private sitting-room, and there hold secret council\nwith him.\n\nThe dogman threw his curly head back, when he had listened to his young\nlord's tale (which contained the truth, and nothing but the truth, yet\nnot by any means the whole truth, for the leading figure was left out),\nand a snort from his broad nostrils showed contempt and strong vexation.\n\n\"Just what I said would come o' such a job,\" he muttered, without\nthought of Lancelot; \"to let in a traitor, and spake him fair, and make\nmuch of him. I wish you had knocked his two eyes out, Master Lance,\ninstead of only blacking of 'un. And a fortnight lost through that\npisonin' Spraggs! And the weather going on, snow and thaw, snow and\nthaw. There's scarcely a dog can stand, let alone a horse, and the\nwreaths getting deeper. Most onlucky! It hath come to pass most\nontoimely.\"\n\n\"But who is Sir Duncan? And who is Mr. Bert? I have told you everything,\nJordas; and all you do is to tell me nothing.\"\n\n\"What more can I tell you, sir? You seem to know most about 'em. And\nwhat was it as took you down that way, sir, if I may make so bold to\nask?\"\n\n\"Jordas, that is no concern of yours; every gentleman has his own\nprivate affairs, which can not in any way concern a common man. But\nI wish you particularly to find out all that can be known about Mr.\nBert--what made him come here, and why does he live so, and how much has\nhe got a year? He seems to be quite a gentleman--\"\n\n\"Then his private affairs, sir, can not concern a common man. You had\nbetter ways go yourself and ask him; or ask his friend with the two\nblack eyes. Now just you do as I bid you, Master Lance. Not a word of\nall this here to my ladies; but think of something as you must have\nimmediate from Middleton. Something as your health requires\"--here\nJordas indulged in a sarcastic grin--\"something as must come, if the sky\ncome down, or the day of Judgment was to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I know, yes, I am quite up to you, Jordas. Let me see: last time it was\na sweet-bread. That would never do again. It shall be a hundred oysters;\nand Spraggs shall command it, or be turned out.\"\n\n\"Jordas, I really can not bear,\" said the kind Mrs. Carnaby, an hour\nafterward, \"that you should seem almost to risk your life by riding to\nMiddleton in such dreadful weather. Are you sure that it will not snow\nagain, and quite sure that you can get through all the wreaths? If not,\nI would on no account have you go. Perhaps, after all, it is but the\nfancy of a poor fantastic invalid, though Dr. Spraggs feels that it is\nso important, and may be the turning-point in his sad illness. It seems\nsuch a long way in such weather; and selfish people, who can never\nunderstand, might say that it was quite unkind of us. But if you have\nmade up your mind to go, in spite of all remonstrance, you must be sure\nto come back to-night; and do please to see that the oysters are round,\nand have not got any of their lids up.\"\n\nThe dogman knew well that he jeopardized his life in either half of the\njourney; no little in going, and tenfold as much in returning through\nthe snows of night. Though the journey in the first place had been of\nhis own seeking, and his faithful mind was set upon it, some little\nsense of bitterness was in his heart, that his life was not thought more\nof. He made a low bow, and turned away, that he might not meet those\neyes so full of anxiety for another, and of none for him. And when he\ncame to think of it, he was sorry afterward for indulging in a little\nbit of two-edged satire.\n\n\"Will you please to ask my lady if I may take Marmaduke? Or whether she\nwould be afeared to risk him in such weather?\"\n\n\"I think it is unkind of you to speak like that. I need not ask my\nsister, as you ought to know. Of course you may take Marmaduke. I need\nnot tell you to be careful of him.\"\n\nAfter that, if he had chosen for himself, he would not have taken\nMarmaduke. But he thought of the importance of his real purpose, and\ncould trust no other horse to get him through it.\n\nIn fine summer weather, when the sloughs were in, and the water-courses\nlow or dry, and the roads firm, wherever there were any, a good horse\nand rider, well acquainted with the track, might go from Scargate Hall\nto Middleton in about three hours, nearly all of the journey being well\ndown hill. But the travel to come back was a very different thing; four\nhours and a half was quick time for it, even in the best state of earth\nand sky, and the Royal Mail pony was allowed a good seven, because his\nspeed (when first established) had now impaired his breathing. And ever\nsince the snow set in, he had received his money for the journey,\nbut preferred to stay in stable; for which everybody had praised him,\nfinding letters give them indigestion.\n\nNow Jordas roughed Marmaduke's shoes himself; for the snow would be\nfrozen in the colder places, and ball wherever any softness was--two\nthings which demand very different measures. Also he fed him well, and\nnourished himself, and took nurture for the road; so that with all haste\nhe could not manage to start before twelve of the day. Travelling was\nworse than he expected, and the snow very deep in places, especially\nat Stormy Gap, about a league from Scargate. Moreover, he knew that the\nstrength of his horse must be carefully husbanded for the return; and so\nit was dusk of the winter evening, and the shops of the little town were\nbeing lit with hoops of candles, when Jordas, followed by Saracen, came\ntrotting through the unpretending street.\n\nThat ancient dog Saracen, the largest of the blood-hounds, had joined\nthe expedition as a volunteer, craftily following and crouching out of\nsight, until he was certain of being too far from home to be sent\nback again. Then he boldly appeared, and cantered gayly on in front of\nMarmaduke, with his heavy dewlaps laced with snow.\n\nJordas put up at a quiet old inn, and had Saracen chained strongly to a\nringbolt in the stable; then he set off afoot to see Mr. Jellicorse, and\njust as he rang the office bell a little fleecy twinkle fell upon one\nof his eyelashes, and looking sharply up, he saw that a snowy night was\ncoming.\n\nThe worthy lawyer received him kindly, but not at all as if he wished to\nsee him; for Christmas-tide was very nigh at hand, and the weather made\nthe ink go thick, and only a clerk who was working for promotion would\nlet his hat stay on its peg after the drum and fife went by, as they\nalways did at dusk of night, to frighten Bonyparty.\n\n\"There are only two important facts in all you have told me, Jordas,\"\nMr. Jellicorse said, when he had heard him out: \"one that Sir Duncan is\ncome home, of which I was aware some time ago; and the other that he has\nbeen consulting an agent of the name of Mordacks, living in this county.\nThat certainly looks as if he meant to take some steps against us. But\nwhat can he do more than might have been done five-and-twenty years\nago?\" The lawyer took good care to speak to none but his principals\nconcerning that plaguesome deed of appointment.\n\n\"Well, sir, you know best, no doubt. Only that he hath the money now, by\nall accounts; and like enough he hath labored for it a' purpose to\nfight my ladies. If your honor knew as well as I do what a Yordas is for\nfighting, and for downright stubbornness--\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do,\" replied the lawyer, with a smile; \"but if he has\nno children of his own, as I believe is the case with him, it seems\nunlikely that he would risk his substance in a rash attempt to turn out\nthose who are his heirs.\"\n\n\"He is not so old but what he might have children yet, if he hath none\nnow to hand. Anyways it was my duty to tell you my news immediate.\"\n\n\"Jordas, I always say that you are a model of a true retainer--a\ncharacter becoming almost extinct in this faithless and revolutionary\nage. Very few men would have ridden into town through all those\ndangerous unmade roads, in weather when even the Royal Mail is kept, by\nthe will of the Lord, in stable.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Jordas, with his brave soft smile, \"the smooth and\nthe rough of it comes in and out, accordin'. Some days I does next to\nnought; and some days I earns my keepin'. Any more commands for me,\nLawyer Jellicoose? Time cometh on rather late for starting.\"\n\n\"Jordas, you amaze me! You never mean to say that you dream of setting\nforth again on such a night as this is? I will find you a bed; you shall\nhave a hot supper. What would your ladies think of me, if I let you go\nforth among the snow again? Just look at the window-panes, while you and\nI were talking! And the feathers of the ice shooting up inside, as long\nas the last sheaf of quills I opened for them. Quills, quills, quills,\nall day! And when I buy a goose unplucked, if his quills are any good,\nhis legs won't carve, and his gizzard is full of gravel-stones! Ah, the\nworld grows every day in roguery.\"\n\n\"All the world agrees to that, sir; ever since I were as high as your\ntable, never I hear two opinions about it; and it maketh a man seem to\ncondemn himself. Good-night, sir, and I hope we shall have good news\nso soon as his Royal Majesty the king affordeth a pony as can lift his\nlegs.\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse vainly strove to keep the man in town that night. He even\ncalled for his sensible wife and his excellent cook to argue, having no\nclerk left to make scandal of the scene. The cook had a turn of mind for\nJordas, and did think that he would stop for her sake; and she took a\nbroom to show him what the depth of snow was upon the red tiles between\nthe brew-house and the kitchen. An icicle hung from the lip of the pump,\nand new snow sparkled on the cook's white cap, and the dark curly hair\nwhich she managed to let fall; the brew-house smelled nice, and the\nkitchen still nicer; but it made no difference to Jordas. If he had told\nthem the reason of this hurry, they would have said hard things\nabout it, perhaps; Mrs. Jellicorse especially (being well read in the\nScriptures, and fond of quoting them against all people who had grouse\nand sent her none) would have called to mind what David said, when the\nthree mighty men broke through the host, and brought water from the well\nof Bethlehem. So Jordas only answered that he had promised to return,\nand a trifle of snow improved the travelling.\n\n\"A willful man must have his way,\" said Mr. Jellicorse at last. \"We can\nnot put him in the pound, Diana; but the least we can do is to provide\nhim for a coarse, cold journey. If I know anything of our country,\nhe will never see Scargate Hall to-night, but his blanket will be a\nsnowdrift. Give him one of our new whitneys to go behind his saddle, and\nI will make him take two things. I am your legal adviser, Jordas, and\nyou are like all other clients. Upon the main issue, you cast me off;\nbut in small matters you must obey me.\"\n\nThe hardy dogman was touched with this unusual care for his welfare. At\nhome his services were accepted as a due, requiring little praise and\nless of gratitude. It was his place to do this and that, and be thankful\nfor the privilege. But his comfort was left for himself to study; and if\nhe had studied it much, reproach would soon have been the chief reward.\nIt never would do, as his ladies said, to make too much of Jordas. He\nwould give himself airs, and think that people could not get on without\nhim.\n\nMarmaduke looked fresh and bold when he came out of stable; he had eaten\nwith pleasure a good hot dinner, or supper perhaps he considered it,\nliking to have his meals early, as horses generally do. And he neighed\nand capered for the homeward road, though he knew how full it was of\nhardships; for never yet looked horse through bridle, without at least\none eye resilient toward the charm of headstall. And now he had both\neyes fixed with legitimate aim in that direction; and what were a few\ntiny atoms of snow to keep a big horse from his household?\n\nMerrily, therefore, he set forth, with a sturdy rider on his back; his\nclear neigh rang through the thick dull streets, and kind people came\nto their white blurred windows, and exclaimed, as they glanced at the\nparty-colored horseman rushing away into the dreary depths, \"Well,\nrather him than me, thank God!\"\n\n\"You keep the dog,\" Master Jordas had said to the hostler, before he\nleft the yard; \"he is like a lamb, when you come to know him. I can't be\nplagued with him to-night. Here's a half crown for his victuals; he eats\nprecious little for the size of him. A bullock's liver every other day,\nand a pound and a half the between times. Don't be afeared of him. He\nlooks like that, to love you, man.\"\n\nInstead of keeping on the Durham side of Tees, as he would have done in\nfair weather for the first six miles or so, Jordas crossed by the old\ntown bridge into his native county. The journey would be longer thus,\nbut easier in some places, and the track more plain to follow, which\non a snowy night was everything. For all things now were in one\nindiscriminate pelt and whirl of white; the Tees was striped with\nrustling floes among the black moor-water; and the trees, as long as\nthere were any, bent their shrouded forms and moaned.\n\nBut with laborious plunges, and broad scatterings of obstruction, the\nwilling horse ploughed out his way, himself the while wrapped up in\nwhite, and caked in all his tufty places with a crust that flopped up\nand down. The rider, himself piled up with snow, and bearded with a\nberg of it, from time to time, with his numb right hand, fumbled at the\nfrozen clouts that clogged the poor horse's mane and crest.\n\n\"How much longer will a' go, I wonder?\" said Jordas to himself for the\ntwentieth time. \"The Lord in heaven knows where we be; but horse knows\nbetter than the Lord a'most. Two hour it must be since ever I 'tempted\nto make head or tail of it. But Marmaduke knoweth when a' hath his head;\nthese creatures is wiser than Christians. Save me from the witches, if\nI ever see such weather! And I wish that Master Lance's oysters wasn't\nquite so much like him.\"\n\nFor, broad as his back was, perpetual thump of rugged and flintified\nknobs and edges, through the flag basket strapped over his neck, was\nbeginning to tell upon his stanch but jolted spine; while his foot in\nthe northern stirrup was numbed, and threatening to get frost-bitten.\n\n\"The Lord knoweth where we be,\" he said once more, growing in piety as\nthe peril grew. \"What can old horse know, without the Lord hath told\n'un? And likely he hath never asked, no more than I did. We mought 'a\ncome twelve moiles, or we mought 'a come no more than six. What ever is\nthere left in the world to judge by? The hills, or the hollows, or\nthe boskies, all is one, so far as the power of a man's eyes goes.\nHowsomever, drive on, old Dukie.\"\n\nOld Dukie drove on with all his might and main, and the stout spirit\nwhich engenders strength, till he came to a white wall reared before\nhim, twice as high as his snow-capped head, and swirling like a billow\nof the sea with drift. Here he stopped short, for he had his own rein,\nand turned his clouted neck, and asked his master what to make of it.\n\n\"We must 'a come at last to Stormy Gap: it might be worse, and it might\nbe better. Rocks o' both sides, and no way round. No choice but to get\nthrough it, or to spend the night inside of it. You and I are a pretty\ngood weight, old Dukie. We'll even try a charge for it, afore we knock\nunder. We can't have much more smother than we've gotten already. My\nfather was taken like this, I've heard tell, in the service of old\nSquire Philip; and he put his nag at it, and scumbled through. But first\nyou get up your wind, old chap.\"\n\nMarmaduke seemed to know what was expected of him; for he turned round,\nretreated a few steps, and then stood panting. Then Jordas dismounted,\nas well as he could with his windward leg nearly frozen. He smote\nhimself lustily, with both arms swinging, upon his broad breast, and he\nstamped in the snow till he felt his tingling feet again. Then he took\nup the skirt of his thick heavy coat, and wiped down the head, mane,\nand shoulders of the horse, and the great pile of snow upon the crupper.\n\"Start clear is a good word,\" he said.\n\nFor a moment he stopped to consider the forlorn hope of his last\nresolution. \"About me, there is no such great matter,\" he thought; \"but\nif I was to kill Dukie, who would ever hear the last of it? And what a\ngood horse he have been, to be sure! But if I was to leave him so, the\ncrows would only have him. We be both in one boat; we must try of it.\"\nHe said a little prayer, which was all he knew, for himself and a lass\nhe had a liking to, who lived in a mill upon the river Lune; and then\nhe got into the saddle again, and set his teeth hard, and spoke to\nMarmaduke, a horse who would never be touched with a spur. \"Come on, old\nchap,\" was all he said.\n\nThe horse looked about in the thick of the night, as the head of the\nhorse peers out of the cloak, in Welsh mummery, at Christmas-tide.\nThe thick of the night was light and dark, with the dense intensity\nof down-pour; light in itself, and dark with shutting out all sight of\neverything--a close-at-hand confusion, and a distance out of measure.\nThe horse, with his wise snow-crusted eyes, took in all the winnowing of\nlight among the draff, and saw no possibility of breaking through, but\nresolved to spend his life as he was ordered. No power of rush or of\ndash could he gather, because of the sinking of his feet; the main\nchance was of bulk and weight; and his rider left him free to choose.\nFor a few steps he walked, nimbly picking up his feet, and then, with\na canter of the best spring he could compass, hurled himself into the\ndepth of the drift, while Jordas lay flat along his neck, and let him\nplunge. For a few yards the light snow flew before him, like froth of\nthe sea before a broad-bowed ship, and smothered as he was, he fought\nonward for his life. But very soon the power of his charge was gone, his\nlimbs could not rise, and his breath was taken from him; the hole that\nhe had made was filled up behind him; fresh volumes from the shaken\nheight came pouring down upon him; his flanks and his back were wedged\nfast in the cumber, and he stood still and trembled, being buried alive.\n\nJordas, with a great effort, threw himself off, and put his hat before\nhis mouth, to make himself a breathing space. He scarcely knew whether\nhe stood or lay; but he kicked about for want of air, and the more\nhe kicked the worse it was, as in the depth of nightmare. Blindness,\nchoking, smothering, and freezing fell in a lump upon his poor body now,\nand the shrieking of the horse and the panting of his struggles came, by\nsome vibration, to him.\n\nBut just as he began to lose his wits, sink away backward, and gasp for\nbreath, a gleam of light broke upon his closing eyes; he gathered the\nremnant of his strength, struck for it, and was in a space of free air.\nAfter several long pants he looked around, and found that a thicket of\nstub oak jutting from the crag of the gap had made a small alcove with\nbillows of snow piled over it. Then the brave spirit of the man came\nforth. \"There is room for Dukie as well as me,\" he gasped; \"with God's\nhelp, I will fetch him in.\"\n\nWeary as he was, he cast himself back into the wall of snow, and\nlistened. At first he heard nothing, and made sure that all was over;\nbut presently a faint soft gurgle, like a dying sob, came through the\nmurk. With all his might he dashed toward the sound, and laid hold of a\nhairy chin just foundering. \"Rise up, old chap,\" he tried to shout, and\nhe gave the horse a breath or two with the broad-brimmed hat above his\nnose. Then Marmaduke rallied for one last fight, with the surety of a\nman to help him. He staggered forward to the leading of the hand he knew\nso well, and fell down upon his knees; but his head was clear, and he\ndrew long breaths, and his heart was glad, and his eyes looked up, and\nhe gave a feeble whinny.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nBAT OF THE GILL\n\n\nUpon that same evening the cottage in the gill was well snowed up, as\nbefell it every winter, more or less handsomely, according to the wind.\nThe wind was in the right way to do it truly now, with just enough\ndraught to pile bountiful wreaths, and not enough of wild blast to\nscatter them again. \"Bat of the Gill,\" as Mr. Bert was called, sat by\nthe fire, with his wife and daughter, and listened very calmly to the\nwhistle of the wind, and the sliding of the soft fall that blocked his\nwindow-panes.\n\nInsie was reading, Mrs. Bert was knitting stockings, and Mr. Bert was\nthinking of his own strange life. It never once occurred to him that\ngreat part of its strangeness sprang from the oddities of his own\nnature, any more than a man who has been in a quarrel believes that he\ncould have kept out of it. \"Matters beyond my own control have forced me\nto do this and that,\" is the sure belief of every man whose life has run\ncounter to his fellows, through his own inborn diversity. In this man's\nnature were two strange points, sure (if they are strong enough to\nsurvive experience) to drive anybody into strange ways: he did not care\nfor money, and he contemned rank.\n\nHow these two horrible twists got into his early composition is more\nthan can be told, and in truth it does not matter. But being quite\nincurable, and meeting with no sympathy, except among people who aspired\nto them only, and failed--if they ever got the chance of failing--these\ndepravations from the standard of mankind drove Christopher Bert from\nthe beaten tracks of life. Providence offered him several occasions of\nreturn into the ordinary course; for after he had cast abroad a very\nnice inheritance, other two fortunes fell to him, but found him as\ndifficult as ever to stay with. Not that he was lavish upon luxury\nof his own, for no man could have simpler tastes, but that he weakly\nbelieved in the duty of benevolence, and the charms of gratitude. Of the\nlatter it is needless to say that he got none, while with the former he\nproduced some harm. When all his bread was cast upon the waters, he set\nout to earn his own crust as best he might.\n\nHence came a chapter of accidents, and a volume of motley incidents in\nvarious climes, and upon far seas. Being a very strong, active man,\nwith gift of versatile hand and brain, and early acquaintance with\nhandicrafts, Christopher Bert could earn his keep, and make in a year\nalmost as much as he used to give away, or lend without redemption, in a\ngeneral day of his wealthy time. Hard labor tried to make him sour, but\ndid not succeed therein.\n\nYet one thing in all this experience vexed him more than any hardship,\nto wit, that he never could win true fellowship among his new fellows in\nthe guild of labor. Some were rather surly, others very pleasant (from\na warm belief that he must yet come into money); but whatsomever\nor whosoever they were, or of whatever land, they all agreed that\nChristopher Bert was not of their communion. Manners, appearance,\neducation, freedom from prejudice, and other wide diversities marked him\nas an interloper, and perhaps a spy, among the enlightened working-men\nof the period. Over and over again he strove to break down this barrier;\nbut thrice as hard he might have striven, and found it still too strong\nfor him. This and another circumstance at last impressed him with the\nsuperior value of his own society. Much as he loved the working-man--in\nspite of all experience of him--that worthy fellow would not have it,\nbut felt a truly and piously hereditary scorn for \"a gentleman as took\na order, when, but for being a blessed fool, he might have stood there\ngiving it.\"\n\nThe other thing that helped to drive him from this very dense array was\nhis own romantic marriage, and the copious birth of children. After the\nsensitive age was past, and when the sensibles ought to reign--for then\nhe was past five-and-thirty--he fell (for the first time of his life)\ninto a violent passion of love for a beautiful Jewish maid barely turned\nseventeen; Zilpah admired him, for he was of noble aspect, rich with\nvariety of thoughts and deeds. With women he had that peculiar power\nwhich men of strong character possess; his voice was like music, and\nhis words as good as poetry, and he scarcely ever seemed to contradict\nhimself. Very soon Zilpah adored him; and then he gave notice to her\nparents that she was to be his wife. These stared considerably, being\nvery wealthy people, of high Jewish blood (and thus the oldest of the\nold), and steadfast most--where all are steadfast--to their own race of\nreligion. Finding their astonishment received serenely, they locked up\ntheir daughter, with some strong expressions; which they redoubled when\nthey found the door wide open in the morning. Zilpah was gone, and they\nscratched out her name from the surface of their memories.\n\nChristopher Bert, being lawfully married--for the local restrictions\nscorned the case of a foreigner and a Jewess--crossed the Polish\nfrontier with his mules and tools, and drove his little covered cart\nthrough Austria. And here he lit upon, and helped in some predicament\nof the road, a spirited young Englishman undergoing the miseries of\nthe grand tour, the son and heir of Philip Yordas. Duncan was large and\ncrooked of thought--as every true Yordas must be--and finding a mind in\nadvance of his own by several years of such sallyings, and not yet even\nswerving toward the turning goal of corpulence, the young man perceived\nthat he had hit upon a prophet.\n\nFor Bert scarcely ever talked at all of his generous ideas. A\nprophet's proper mantle is the long cloak of Harpocrates, and his best\nvaticinations are inspired more than uttered. So it came about that\nDuncan Yordas, difficult as he was to lead, largely shared the devious\ncourses of Christopher Bert the workman, and these few months of\nfriendship made a lasting mark upon the younger man.\n\nSoon after this a heavy blow befell the ingenious wanderer. Among his\nmany arts and trades, he had some knowledge of engineering, or at\nany rate much boldness of it; which led him to conceive a brave idea\nconcerning some tributary of the Po. The idea was sound and fine, and\nmight have led to many blessings; but Nature, enjoying her bad work\nbest, recoiled upon her improver. He left an oozy channel drying (like a\nglanderous sponge) in August; and virulent fever came into his tent.\nAll of his eight children died except his youngest son Maunder; his own\nstrong frame was shaken sadly; and his loving wife lost all her strength\nand buxom beauty. He gathered the remnants of his race, and stricken but\nstill unconquered, took his way to a long-forgotten land. \"The residue\nof us must go home,\" he said, after all his wanderings.\n\nIn London, of course, he was utterly forgotten, although he had spent\nmuch substance there, in the days of sanguine charity. Durham was his\nnative county, where he might have been a leading man, if more like\nother men. \"Cosmopolitan\" as he was, and strong in his own opinions\nstill, the force of years, and sorrow, and long striving, told upon him.\nHe had felt a longing to mend the kettles of the house that once was\nhis; but when he came to the brink of Tees his stout heart failed, and\nhe could not cross.\n\nInstead of that he turned away, to look for his old friend Yordas; not\nto be patronized by him--for patronage he would have none--but from\nhankering after a congenial mind, and to touch upon kind memories.\nYordas was gone, as pure an outcast as himself, and his name almost\nforbidden there. He thought it a part of the general wrong, and wandered\nabout to see the land, with his eyes wide open as usual.\n\nThere was nothing very beautiful in the land, and nothing at all\nattractive, except that it commanded length of view, and was noble\nin its rugged strength. This, however, pleased him well, and here he\nresolved to set up his staff, if means could be found to make it grow.\nFrom the higher fells he could behold (whenever the weather encouraged\nhim) the dromedary humps of certain hills, at the tail whereof he had\nbeen at school--a charming mist of retrospect. And he felt, though it\nmight have been hard to make him own it, a deeply seated joy that here\nhe should be long lengths out of reach of the most highly illuminated\nworking-man. This was an inconsistent thing, but consistent forever in\ncoming to pass.\n\nWhere the will is, there the way is, if the will be only wise. Bert\nfound out a way of living in this howling wilderness, as his poor wife\nwould have called it, if she had been a bad wife. Unskillful as he had\nshown himself in the matter of silver and gold, he had won great skill\nin the useful metals, especially in steel--the type of truth. And here\nin a break of rock he discovered a slender vein of a slate-gray mineral,\ndistinct from cobalt, but not unlike it, such as he had found in the\nCarpathian Mountains, and which in metallurgy had no name yet, for its\nvalue was known to very few. But a legend of the spot declared that the\nancient cutlers of Bilbao owed much of their fame to the use of this\nmineral in the careful process of conversion.\n\n\"I can make a living out of it, and that is all I want,\" said Bert, who\nwas moderately sanguine still. \"I know a manufacturer who has faith in\nme, and is doing all he can against the supremacy of Sheffield. If I\ncan make arrangements with him, we will settle here, and keep to our own\naffairs for the future.\"\n\nHe built him a cottage in lonely snugness, far in the waste, and outside\neven of the range of title-deeds, though he paid a small rent to the\nmanor, to save trouble, and to satisfy his conscience of the mineral\ndeposit. By right of discovery, lease, and user, this became entirely\nhis, as nobody else had ever heard of it. So by the fine irony of facts\nit came to pass, first, that the squanderer of three fortunes united\nhis lot with a Jewess; next, that a great \"cosmopolitan\" hugged a strict\ncorner of jealous monopoly; and again, that a champion of communism\ninsisted upon his exclusive right to other people's property. However,\nfor all that, it might not be easy to find a more consistent man.\n\nHere Maunder, the surviving son, grew up, and Insie, their last child,\nwas born; and the land enjoyed peace for twenty years, because it was\nof little value. A man who had been about the world so loosely must have\nfound it hard to be boxed up here, except for the lowering of strength\nand pride by sorrow of affection, and sore bodily affliction. But the\nair of the moorland is good for such troubles. Bert possessed a happy\nnature; and perhaps it was well that his children could say, \"We are\nnine; but only two to feed.\"\n\nIt must have been the whistling wind, a long memorial sound, which sent\nhim, upon this snowy December night, back among the echoes of the past;\nfor he always had plenty of work to do, even in the winter evenings,\nand was not at all given to folded arms. And before he was tired of his\nshort warm rest, his wife asked, \"Where is Maunder?\"\n\n\"I left him doing his work,\" he replied; \"he had a great heap still to\nclear. He understands his work right well. He will not go to bed till he\nhas done it. We must not be quite snowed up, my dear.\"\n\nMrs. Bert shook her head: having lost so many children, she was anxious\nabout the rest of them. But before she could speak again, a heavy leap\nagainst the door was heard; the strong latch rattled, and the timbers\ncreaked. Insie jumped up to see what it meant, but her father stopped\nher, and went himself. When he opened the door, a whirl of snow flew in,\nand through the glitter and the flutter a great dog came reeling, and\nrolled upon the floor, a mighty lump of bristled whiteness. Mrs. Bert\nwas terrified, for she thought it was a wolf, not having found it in her\npower to believe that there could be such a desert place without wolves\nin the winter-time.\n\n\"Why, Saracen!\" said Insie; \"I declare it is! You poor old dog, what can\nhave brought you out this weather?\"\n\nBoth her parents were surprised to see her sit down on the floor and\nthrow her arms around the neck of this self-invited and very uncouth\nvisitor. For the girl forgot all of her trumpery concealments in the\nwarmth of her feeling for a poor lost dog.\n\nSaracen looked at her, with a view to dignity. He had only seen her once\nbefore, when Pet brought him down (both for company and safeguard), and\nhe was not a dog who would dream of recognizing a person to whom he had\nbeen rashly introduced. And he knew that he was in a mighty difficulty\nnow, which made self-respect all the more imperative. However, on the\nwhole, he had been pleased with Insie at their first interview, and had\npatronized her--for she had an honest fragrance, and a little taste of\nsalt--and now with a side look he let her know that he did not wish to\nhurt her feelings, although his business was not with her. But if she\nwanted to give him some refreshment, she might do so, while he was\nconsidering.\n\nThe fact was, though he could not tell it, and would scorn to do so\nif he could, that he had not had one bit to eat for more hours than he\ncould reckon. That wicked hostler at Middleton had taken his money and\ndisbursed it upon beer, adding insult to injury by remarking, in the\nhearing of Saracen (while strictly chained), that he was a deal too fat\nalready. So vile a sentiment had deepened into passion the dog's ever\ndominant love of home; and when the darkness closed upon him in an\nunknown hungry hole, without even a horse for company, any other dog\nwould have howled; but this dog stiffened his tail with self-respect. He\nscraped away all the straw to make a clear area for his experiment, and\nthen he stood up like a pillar, or a fine kangaroo, and made trial of\nhis weight against the chain. Feeling something give, or show propensity\ntoward giving, he said to himself that here was one more triumph for him\nover the presumptuous intellect of man. The chain might be strong enough\nto hold a ship, and the great leathern collar to secure a bull; but the\nfastening of chain to collar was unsound, by reason of the rusting of a\nrivet.\n\nRetiring to the manger for a better length of rush, he backed against\nthe wall for a fulcrum to his spring, while the roll of his chest and\nthe breadth of his loins quivered with tight muscle. Then off like the\ncharge of a cannon he dashed, the loop of the collar flew out of the\nrivet, and the chain fell clanking on the paving-bricks. With grim\nsatisfaction the dog set off in the track of the horse for Scargate\nHall. And now he sat panting in the cottage of the gill, to tell his\ndiscovery and to crave for help.\n\n\"Where do you come from, and what do you want?\" asked Bert, as the dog,\nsoon beginning to recover, looked round at the door, and then back again\nat him, and jerked up his chin impatiently, \"Insie, you seem to know\nthis fine fellow. Where have you met him? And whose dog is he? Saracen!\nWhy, that is the name of the dog who is everybody's terror at Scargate.\"\n\n\"I gave him some water one day,\" said Insie, \"when he was terribly\nthirsty. But he seems to know you, father, better than me. He wants you\nto do something, and he scorns me.\"\n\nFor Saracen, failing of articulate speech, was uttering volumes of\nentreaty with his eyes, which were large, and brown, and full of clear\nexpression under eyebrows of rich tan; and then he ran to the door, put\nup one heavy paw and shook it, and ran back, and pushed the master with\nhis nozzle, and then threw back his great head and long velvet ears, and\nopening his enormous jaws, gave vent to a mighty howl which shook the\nroof.\n\n\"Oh, put him out, put him out! open the door!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bert, in\nfresh terror. \"If he is not a wolf, he is a great deal worse.\"\n\n\"His master is out in the snow,\" cried Bert; \"perhaps buried in the\nsnow, and he is come to tell us. Give me my hat, child, and my thick\ncoat. See how delighted he is, poor fellow! Oh, here comes Maunder! Now\nlead the way, my friend. Maunder, go and fetch the other shovel.\nThere is somebody lost in the snow, I believe. We must follow this dog\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Not till you both have had much plenty food,\" the mother said: \"out\nupon the moors, this bad, bad night, and for leagues possibly to travel.\nMy son and my husband are much too good. You bad dog, why did you come,\npestilent? But you shall have food also. Insie, provide him. While I\nmake to eat your father and your brother.\"\n\nSaracen would hardly wait, starving as he was; but seeing the men\nprepare to start, he made the best of it, and cleared out a colander of\nvictuals in a minute.\n\n\"Put up what is needful for a starving traveller,\" Mr. Bert said to the\nladies. \"We shall want no lantern; the snow gives light enough, and\nthe moon will soon be up. Keep a kettle boiling, and some warm clothes\nready. Perhaps we shall be hours away; but have no fear. Maunder is the\nboy for snow-drifts.\"\n\nThe young man being of a dark and silent nature, quite unlike his\nfather's, made no reply, nor even deigned to give a smile, but seemed to\nbe wonderfully taken with the dog, who in many ways resembled him. Then\nhe cast both shovels on his shoulder at the door, and strode forth,\nand stamped upon the path that he had cleared. His father took a stout\nstick, the dog leaped past them, and led them out at once upon the open\nmoor.\n\n\"We are in for a night of it,\" said Mr. Bert, and his son did not\ncontradict him.\n\n\"The dog goes first, then I, then you,\" he said to his father, with his\ndeep slow tone. And the elderly man, whose chief puzzle in life--since\nhe had given up the problem of the world--was the nature of his only\nson, now wondered again, as he seldom ceased from wondering, whether\nthis boy despised or loved him. The young fellow always took the very\ngreatest care of his father, as if he were a child to be protected, and\nhe never showed the smallest sign of disrespect. Yet Maunder was not the\ntrue son of his father, but of some ancestor, whose pride sprang out\nof dust at the outrageous idea of a kettle-mending Bert, and embodied\nitself in this Maunder.\n\nThe large-minded father never dreamed of such a trifle, but felt in such\nweather, with the snow above his leggings, that sometimes it is good to\nhave a large-bodied son.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nA CLEW OF BUTTONS\n\n\nWhen Jack o' the Smithies met his old commander, as related by himself,\nat the house of Mr. Mordacks, everything seemed to be going on well for\nSir Duncan, and badly for his sisters. The general factor, as he hinted\nlong ago, possessed certain knowledge which the Middleton lawyer fondly\nsupposed to be confined to himself and his fair clients. Sir Duncan\nrefused to believe that the ladies could ever have heard of such a\ndocument as that which, if valid, would simply expel them; for, said he,\n\"If they know of it, they are nothing less than thieves to conceal it\nand continue in possession. Of a lawyer I could fancy it, but never of a\nlady.\"\n\n\"My good sir,\" answered the sarcastic Mordacks, \"a lady's conscience is\nnot the same as a gentleman's, but bears more resemblance to a lawyer's.\nA lady's honor is of the very highest standard; but the standard depends\nupon her state of mind; and that, again, depends upon the condition of\nher feelings. You must not suppose me to admit the faintest shadow of\ndisrespect toward your good sisters; but ladies are ladies, and facts\nare facts; and the former can always surmount the latter; while a man is\ncomparatively helpless. I know that Mr. Jellicorse, their man of law, is\nthoroughly acquainted with this interesting deed; his first duty was to\napprise them of it; and that, you may be quite sure, he has done.\"\n\n\"I hope not. I am sure not. A lawyer does not always employ hot haste in\nan unwelcome duty.\"\n\n\"True enough, Sir Duncan. But the duty here was welcome. Their knowledge\nof that deed, and of his possession of it, would make him their master,\nif he chose to be so. Not that old Jellicorse would think of such a\nthing. He is a man of high principle like myself, of a lofty conscience,\nand even sentimental. But lawyers are just like the rest of mankind.\nTheir first consideration is their bread and cheese; though some of them\ncertainly seem ready to accept it even in the toasted form.\"\n\n\"You may say what you like, Mordacks, my sister Philippa is far too\nupright, and Eliza too good, for any such thing to be possible. However,\nthat question may abide. I shall not move until I have some one to do it\nfor. I have no great affection for a home which cast me forth, whether\nit had a right to do so or not. But if we succeed in the more important\nmatter, it will be my duty to recover the estates, for the benefit of\nanother. You are sure of your proofs that it is the boy?\"\n\n\"As certain as need be. And we will make it surer when you meet me there\nthe week after next. For the reasons I have mentioned, we must wait\ntill then. Your yacht is at Yarmouth. You have followed my advice in\napproaching by sea, and not by land, and in hiring at Yarmouth for the\npurpose. But you never should have come to York, Sir Duncan; this is\na very great mistake of yours. They are almost sure to hear of it.\nAnd even your name given in our best inn! But luckily they never see a\nnewspaper at Scargate.\"\n\n\"I follow the tactics with which you succeed--all above-board, and no\nstratagems. Your own letter brought me; but perhaps I am too old to be\nso impatient. Where shall I meet you, and on what day?\"\n\n\"This day fortnight, at the Thornwick Inn, I shall hope to be with you\nat three o'clock, and perhaps bring somebody with me. If I fixed an\nearlier day, I should only disappoint you. For many things have to be\ndelicately managed; and among them, the running of a certain cargo,\nwithout serious consequence. For that we may trust a certain very\nskillful youth. For the rest you must trust to a clumsier person, your\nhumble land-agent and surveyor--titles inquired into and verified, at a\ntenth of solicitors' charges.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Duncan, \"you shall verify mine, as soon as you have\nverified my son, and my title to him. Good-by, Mordacks. I am sure you\nmean me well, but you seem to be very long about it.\"\n\n\"Hot climates breed impatience, sir. A true son of Yorkshire is never in\na hurry. The general complaint of me is concerning my wild rapidity.\"\n\n\"You are like the grocer, whose goods, if they have any fault at all,\nhave the opposite one to what the customer finds in them. Well, good-by,\nMordacks. You are a trusty friend, and I thank you.\"\n\nThese words from Sir Duncan Yordas were not merely of commonplace.\nFor he was a man of great self-reliance, quick conclusion, and strong\nresolve. These had served him well in India, and insured his fortune;\nwhile early adversity and bitter losses had tempered the arrogance of\nhis race. After the loss of his wife and child, and the breach with all\nhis relatives, he had led a life of peril and hard labor, varied with\nfew pleasures. When first he learned from Edinburgh that the ship\nconveying his only child to the care of the mother's relatives was lost,\nwith all on board, he did all in his power to make inquiries. But\nthe illness and death of his wife, to whom he was deeply attached,\noverwhelmed him. For while with some people \"one blow drives out\nanother,\" with some the second serves only to drive home, deepen, and\naggravate the first. For years he was satisfied to believe both losses\nirretrievable. And so he might still have gone on believing, except for\na queer little accident.\n\nBeing called to Calcutta upon government business, he happened to see a\npair of English sailors, lazily playing, in a shady place by the side of\nthe road, at hole-penny. One of them seemed to have his pocket cleared\nout, for just as Sir Duncan was passing, he cried, \"Here, Jack, you give\nme change of one of them, and I'll have at you again, my boy. As good as\na guinea with these blessed niggers. Come back to their home, I b'lieve\nthey are, same as I wish I was; rale gold--ask this gen'leman.\"\n\nThe other swore that they were \"naught but brass, and not worth a copper\nfarden\"; until the tars, being too tipsy for much fighting, referred the\nquestion to Sir Duncan.\n\nThree hollow beads of gold were what they showed him, and he knew them\nat once for his little boy's buttons, the workmanship being peculiar to\none village of his district, and one family thereof. The sailor would\nthankfully have taken one rupee apiece for them; but Sir Duncan gave him\nthirty for the three--their full metallic value--upon his pledging honor\nto tell all he knew about them, and make affidavit, if required. Then\nhe told all he knew, to the best of his knowledge, and swore to it when\nsober, accepted a refresher, and made oath to it again, with some lively\nparticulars added. And the facts that he deposed to, and deposited, were\nthese:\n\nBeing down upon his luck, about a twelvemonth back, he thought of\nkeeping company with a nice young woman, and settling down until a\nbetter time turned up; and happening to get a month's wages from a\nschooner of ninety-five tons at Scarborough, he strolled about the\nstreet a bit, and kept looking down the railings for a servant-girl who\nmight have got her wages in her work-box. Clean he was, and taut, and\nclever, beating up street in Sunday rig, keeping sharp look-out for\na consort, and in three or four tacks he hailed one. As nice a young\npartner as a lad could want, and his meaning was to buckle to for the\nwinter. But the night before the splicing-day, what happened to him he\nnever could tell after. He was bousing up his jib, as a lad is bound\nto do, before he takes the breakers. And when he came to, he was twenty\nleagues from Scarborough, on board of his Majesty's recruiting brig the\nHarpy. He felt in his pocket for the wedding-ring, and instead of that,\nthere were these three beads.\n\nSir Duncan was sorry for his sad disaster, and gave him ten more rupees\nto get over it. And then he discovered that the poor forsaken maiden's\nname was Sally Watkins. Sally was the daughter of a rich pawnbroker,\nwhose frame of mind was sometimes out of keeping with its true\ncontents. He had very fine feelings, and real warmth of sympathy; but\ncircumstances seemed sometimes to lead them into the wrong channel,\nand induced him to kick his children out of doors. In the middle of the\nfamily he kicked out Sally, almost before her turn was come; and\nshe took a place at 4 pounds a year, to disgrace his memory--as she\nsaid--carrying off these buttons, and the jacket, which he had bestowed\nupon her, in a larger interval.\n\nThere was no more to be learned than this from the intercepted\nbridegroom. He said that he might have no objection to go on with his\nlove again, as soon as the war was over, leastways, if it was made worth\nhis while; but he had come across another girl, at the Cape of Good\nHope, and he believed that this time the Lord was in it, for she had\nbeen born in a caul, and he had got it. With such a dispensation Sir\nDuncan Yordas saw no right to interfere, but left the course of true\nlove to itself, after taking down the sailor's name--\"Ned Faithful.\"\n\nHowever, he resolved to follow out the clew of beads, though without\nmuch hope of any good result. Of the three in his possession he kept\none, and one he sent to Edinburgh, and the third to York, having heard\nof the great sagacity, vigor, and strict integrity of Mr. Mordacks, all\nof which he sharpened by the promise of a large reward upon discovery.\nThen he went back to his work, until his time of leave was due, after\ntwenty years of arduous and distinguished service. In troublous times,\nno private affairs, however urgent, should drive him from his post.\n\nNow, eager as he was when in England once again, he was true to his\ncharacter and the discipline of life. He had proof that the matter was\nin very good hands, and long command had taught him the necessity of\nobedience. Any previous Yordas would have kicked against the pricks,\nrushed forward, and scattered everything. But Sir Duncan was now of a\ndifferent fibre. He left York at once, as Mordacks advised, and posted\nto Yarmouth, before the roads were blocked with snow, and while Jack o'\nthe Smithies was returning to his farm. And from Yarmouth he set sail\nfor Scarborough, in a sturdy little coaster, which he hired by the week.\nFrom Scarborough he would run down to Bridlington--not too soon,\nfor fear of setting gossip going, but in time to meet Mordacks at\nFlamborough, as agreed upon.\n\nThat gentleman had other business in hand, which must not be neglected;\nbut he gave to this matter a very large share of his time, and paid\nfive-and-twenty pounds for the trusty roadster, who liked the taste of\nFlamborough pond, and the salt air on the oats of Widow Tapsy's stable,\nand now regularly neighed and whisked his tail as soon as he found\nhimself outside Monk Bar. By favor of this horse and of his own sword\nand pistols, Mordacks spent nearly as much time now at Flamborough as\nhe did in York; but unluckily he had been obliged to leave on the\nvery afternoon before the run was accomplished, and Carroway slain so\nwickedly; for he hurried home to meet Sir Duncan, and had not heard the\nbad news when he met him.\n\nThat horrible murder was a sad blow to him, not only as a man of\nconsiderable kindness and desire to think well of every one--so far as\nexperience allows it--but also because of the sudden apparition of the\nlaw rising sternly in front of him. Justice in those days was not as\nnow: her truer name was Nemesis. After such an outrage to the dignity of\nthe realm, an example must be made, without much consideration whether\nit were the right one. If Robin Lyth were caught, there would be the\nform of trial, but the principal point would be to hang him. Like the\nrest of the world, Mr. Mordacks at first believed entirely in his guilt;\nbut unlike the world, he did not desire to have him caught, and brought\nstraightway to the gallows. Instead of seeking him, therefore, he was\nnow compelled to avoid him, when he wanted him most; for it never must\nbe said that a citizen of note had discoursed with such a criminal,\nand allowed him to escape. On the other hand, here he had to meet Sir\nDuncan, and tell him that all those grand promises were shattered, that\nin finding his only son all he had found was a cowardly murderer flying\nfor his life, and far better left at the bottom of the sea. For once\nin a way, as he dwelt upon all this, the general factor became\ndown-hearted, his vigorous face lost the strong lines of decision, and\nhe even allowed his mouth to open without anything to put into it.\n\nBut it was impossible for this to last. Nature had provided Mordacks\nwith an admirably high opinion of himself, enlivened by a sprightly\ngood-will toward the world, whenever it wagged well with him. He had\nplenty of business of his own, and yet could take an amateur delight in\nthe concerns of everybody; he was always at liberty to give good advice,\nand never under duty to take it; he had vigor of mind, of memory,\nof character, and of digestion; and whenever he stole a holiday from\nself-denial, and launched out after some favorite thing, there was the\ncash to do it with, and the health to do it pleasantly.\n\nSuch a man is not long depressed by a sudden misadventure. Dr. Upround's\nopinion in favor of Robin did not go very far with him; for he looked\nupon the rector as a man who knew more of divine than of human nature.\nBut that fault could scarcely be found with a woman; or at any rate with\na widow encumbered with a large family hanging upon the dry breast of\nthe government. And though Mr. Mordacks did not invade the cottage quite\nso soon as he should have done, if guided by strict business, he thought\nhimself bound to get over that reluctance, and press her upon a most\ndistressing subject, before he kept appointment with his principal.\n\nThe snow, which by this time had blockaded Scargate, impounded\nJordas, and compelled Mr. Jellicorse to rest and be thankful for a hot\nmince-pie, although it had visited this eastern coast as well, was\nnot deep enough there to stop the roads. Keeping head-quarters at the\n\"Hooked Cod\" now, and encouraging a butcher to set up again (who had\ndropped all his money, in his hurry to get on), Geoffrey Mordacks began\nto make way into the outer crust of Flamborough society. In a council of\nthe boats, upon a Sunday afternoon, every boat being garnished for\nits rest upon the flat, and every master fisherman buttoned with a\nflower--the last flowers of the year, and bearing ice-marks in their\neyes--a resolution had been passed that the inland man meant well, had\nnaught to do with Revenue, or Frenchmen either, or what was even worse,\nany outside fishers, such as often-time came sneaking after fishing\ngrounds of Flamborough. Mother Tapsy stood credit for this strange man,\nand he might be allowed to go where he was minded, and to take all the\nhelp he liked to pay for.\n\nFew men could have achieved such a triumph, without having married a\nFlamborough lass, which must have been the crown of all human ambition,\nif difficulty crowns it. Even to so great a man it was an added laurel,\nand strengthened him much in his opinion of himself. In spite of all\ndisasters, he recovered faith in fortune, so many leading Flamborough\nmen began to touch their hats to him! And thus he set forth before a\nbitter eastern gale, with the head of his seasoned charger bent toward\nthe melancholy cot at Bridlington.\n\nHaving granted a new life of slaughter to that continually insolvent\nbutcher, who exhibited the body of a sheep once more, with an eye to the\napproach of Christmas, this universal factor made it a point of duty\nto encourage him. In either saddle-bag he bore a seven-pound leg of\nmutton--a credit to a sheep of that district then--and to show himself\nno traitor to the staple of the place, he strapped upon his crupper, in\nsome oar-weed and old netting, a twenty-pound cod, who found it hard to\nbreathe his last when beginning to enjoy horse-exercise.\n\n\"There is a lot of mouths to fill,\" said Mr. Mordacks, with a sigh,\nwhile his landlady squeezed a brown loaf of her baking into the nick\nof his big sword-strap; \"and you and I are capable of entering into the\ncondition of the widow and the fatherless.\"\n\n\"Hoonger is the waa of them, and victuals is the cure for it. Now mind\nyou coom home afore dark,\" cried the widow, to whom he had happened to\nsay, very sadly, that he was now a widower. \"To my moind, a sight o'\nmore snaw is a-coomin'; and what mah sard or goon foight again it?\nCaptain Moordocks, coom ye home arly. T' hare sha' be doon to a toorn be\nfi' o'clock. Coom ye home be that o'clock, if ye care for deener.\"\n\n\"I must have made a tender impression on her heart,\" Mr. Mordacks said\nto himself, as he kissed his hand to the capacious hostess. \"Such is\nmy fortune, to be loved by everybody, while aiming at the sternest\nrectitude. It is sweet, it is dangerously sweet; but what a comfort! How\nthat large-hearted female will baste my hare!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nA PLEASANT INTERVIEW\n\n\nCumbered as he was of body, and burdened with some cares of mind, the\ngeneral factor ploughed his way with his usual resolution. A scowl of\ndark vapor came over the headlands, and under-ran the solid snow-clouds\nwith a scud, like bonfire smoke. The keen wind following the curves of\nland, and shaking the fringe of every white-clad bush, piped (like a\nboy through a comb) wherever stock or stub divided it. It turned all\nthe coat of the horse the wrong way, and frizzed up the hair of Mr.\nMordacks, which was as short as a soldier's, and tossed up his heavy\nriding cape, and got into him all up the small of his back. Being fond\nof strong language, he indulged in much; but none of it warmed him, and\nthe wind whistled over his shoulders, and whirled the words out of his\nmouth.\n\nWhen he came to the dip of the road, where it crosses the Dane's\nDike, he pulled up his horse for a minute, in the shelter of shivering\nfir-trees. \"What a cursed bleak country! My fish is frozen stiff, and my\nlegs are as dead as the mutton in the saddle-bags. Geoffrey, you are a\nfool,\" he said. \"Charity is very fine, and business even better; but a\ngood coal fire is the best of all. But in for a penny of it, in for a\npound. Hark! I hear some fellow-fool equally determined to be frozen.\nI'll go at once and hail him; perhaps the sight of him will warm me.\"\n\nHe turned his horse down a little lane upon the left, where snow lay\ndeep, with laden bushes overhanging it, and a rill of water bridged\nwith bearded ice ran dark in the hedge-trough. And here he found a\nstout lusty man, with shining red cheeks and keen blue eyes, hacking and\nhewing in a mighty maze of brambles.\n\n\"My friend, you seem busy. I admire your vast industry,\" Mr. Mordacks\nexclaimed, as the man looked at him, but ceased not from swinging his\nlong hedge-hook. \"Happy is the land that owns such men.\"\n\n\"The land dothn't own me; I own the land. I shall be pleased to learn\nwhat your business is upon it.\"\n\nFarmer Anerley hated chaff, as a good agriculturist should do. Moreover,\nhe was vexed by many little griefs to-day, and had not been out long\nenough to work them off. He guessed pretty shrewdly that this sworded\nman was \"Moreducks\"--as the leading wags of Flamborough were gradually\ncalling him--and the sight of a sword upon his farm (unless of an\nofficer bound to it) was already some disquietude to an English farmer's\nheart. That was a trifle; for fools would be fools, and might think it a\ngrand thing to go about with tools they were never born to the handling\nof; but a fellow who was come to take up Robin Lyth's case, and strive\nto get him out of his abominable crime, had better go back to the\nrogue's highway, instead of coming down the private road to Anerley.\n\n\"Upon my word I do believe,\" cried Mordacks, with a sprightly joy, \"that\nI have the pleasure of meeting at last the well-known Captain Anerley!\nMy dear sir, I can not help commending your prudence in guarding the\nentrance to your manor; but not in this employment of a bill-hook. From\nall that I hear, it is a Paradise indeed. What a haven in such weather\nas the present! Now, Captain Anerley, I entreat you to consider whether\nit is wise to take the thorn so from the rose. If I had so sweet a\nplace, I would plant brambles, briers, blackthorn, furze, crataegus,\nevery kind of spinous growth, inside my gates, and never let anybody lop\nthem. Captain, you are too hospitable.\"\n\nFarmer Anerley gazed with wonder at this man, who could talk so fast for\nthe first time of seeing a body. Then feeling as if his hospitality were\nchallenged, and desiring more leisure for reflection, \"You better come\ndown the lane, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Am I to understand that you invite me to your house, or only to the\ngate where the dogs come out? Excuse me: I always am a most plain-spoken\nman.\"\n\n\"Our dogs never bite nobody but rogues.\"\n\n\"In that case, Captain Anerley, I may trust their moral estimate. I knew\na farmer once who was a thorough thief in hay; a man who farmed his own\nland, and trimmed his own hedges; a thoroughly respectable and solid\nagriculturist. But his trusses of hay were always six pounds short, and\nif ever anybody brought a sample truss to steelyard, he had got a little\ndog, just seven pounds weight, who slipped into the core of it, being\njust a good hay-color. He always delivered his hay in the twilight, and\nwhen it swung the beam, he used to say, 'Come, now, I must charge you\nfor overweight.' Now, captain, have you got such an honest dog as that?\"\n\n\"I would have claimed him, that I would, if such a clever dog were\nweighed to me. But, sir, you have got the better of me. What a man for\nstories you be, for sure! Come in to our fire-place.\" Farmer Anerley was\nconquered by this tale, which he told fifty times every year he lived\nthereafter, never failing to finish with, \"What rogues they be, up York\nway!\"\n\nMaster Mordacks was delighted with this piece of luck on his side.\nMany times he had been longing to get in at Anerley, not only from the\nreputation of good cheer there, but also from kind curiosity to see the\ncharming Mary, who was now becoming an important element of business.\nSince Robin had given him the slip so sadly--a thing it was impossible\nto guard against--the best chance of hearing what became of him would be\nto get into the good graces of his sweetheart.\n\n\"We have been very sadly for a long time now,\" said the farmer, as he\nknocked at his own porch door with the handle of his bill-hook. \"There\nused to be one as was always welcome here; and a pleasure it was to see\nhim make himself so pleasant, sir. But ever since the Lord took him home\nfrom his family, without a good-by, as a man might say, my wife hath\ntaken to bar the doors whiles I am away and out of sight.\" Stephen\nAnerley knocked harder, as he thus explained the need of it; for it\ngrieved him to have his house shut up.\n\n\"Very wise of them all to bar out such weather,\" said Mordacks, who read\nthe farmer's thoughts like print, \"Don't relax your rules, sir, until\nthe weather changes. Ah, that was a very sad thing about the captain. As\ngallant an officer, and as single-minded, as ever killed a Frenchman in\nthe best days of our navy.\"\n\n\"Single-minded is the very word to give him, sir. I sought about for it\never since I heard of him coming to an end like that, and doing of his\nduty in the thick of it. If I could only get a gentleman to tell me, or\nan officer's wife would be better still, what the manners is when a poor\nlady gets her husband shot, I'll be blest if I wouldn't go straight\nand see her, though they make such a distance betwixt us and the\nregulars.--Oh, then, ye've come at last! No thief, no thief.\"\n\n\"Father,\" cried Mary, bravely opening all the door, of which the\nruffian wind made wrong by casting her figure in high relief--and yet a\npardonable wrong--\"father, you are quite wise to come home, before your\ndear nose is quite cut off.--Oh, I beg your pardon, sir; I never saw\nyou.\"\n\n\"My fate in life is to be overlooked,\" Mr. Mordacks answered, with\na martial stride; \"but not always, young lady, with such exquisite\nrevenge. What I look at pays fiftyfold for being overlooked.\"\n\n\"You are an impudent, conceited man,\" thought Mary to herself, with\ngross injustice; but she only blushed and said, \"I beg your pardon,\nsir.\"\n\n\"You see, sir,\" quoth the farmer, with some severity, tempered, however,\nwith a smile of pride, \"my daughter, Mary Anerley.\"\n\n\"And I take off my hat,\" replied audacious Mordacks, among whose faults\nwas no false shame, \"not only to salute a lady, sir, but also to have a\nbetter look.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the farmer, as Mary ran away; \"your city ways are\nhigh polite, no doubt, but my little lass is strange to them. And I like\nher better so, than to answer pert with pertness. Now come you in, and\nwarm your feet a bit. None of us are younger than we used to be.\"\n\nThis was not Master Anerley's general style of welcoming a guest, but he\nhated new-fangled Frenchified manners, as he told his good wife, when\nhe boasted by-and-by how finely he had put that old coxcomb down. \"You\nnever should have done it,\" was all the praise he got. \"Mr. Mordacks is\na business man, and business men always must relieve their minds.\" For\nno sooner now was the general factor introduced to Mistress Anerley\nthan she perceived clearly that the object of his visit was not to make\nspeeches to young chits of girls, but to seek the advice of a sensible\nperson, who ought to have been consulted a hundred times for once that\nshe even had been allowed to open her mouth fairly. Sitting by the fire,\nhe convinced her that the whole of the mischief had been caused by sheer\nneglect of her opinion. Everything she said was so exactly to the point\nthat he could not conceive how it should have been so slighted, and she\nfor her part begged him to stay and partake of their simple dinner.\n\n\"Dear madam, it can not be,\" he replied; \"alas! I must not think of it.\nMy conscience reproaches me for indulging, as I have done, in what\nis far sweeter than even one of your dinners--a most sensible lady's\nsociety. I have a long bitter ride before me, to comfort the fatherless\nand the widow. My two legs of mutton will be thawed by this time in the\ngenial warmth of your stable. I also am thawed, warmed, feasted I may\nsay, by happy approximation to a mind so bright and congenial. Captain\nAnerley, madam, has shown true kindness in allowing me the privilege of\nexclusive speech with you. Little did I hope for such a piece of luck\nthis morning. You have put so many things in a new and brilliant light,\nthat my road becomes clear before me. Justice must be done; and you feel\nquite sure that Robin Lyth committed this atrocious murder because poor\nCarroway surprised him so when making clandestine love, at your brother\nSquire Popplewell's, to a beautiful young lady who shall be nameless.\nAnd deeply as you grieve for the loss of such a neighbor, the bravest\nofficer of the British navy, who leaped from a strictly immeasurable\nheight into a French ship, and scattered all her crew, and has since had\na baby about three months old, as well as innumerable children, you\nfeel that you have reason to be thankful sometimes that the young man's\ncharacter has been so clearly shown, before he contrived to make his way\ninto the bosom of respectable families in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"I never thought it out quite so clear as that, sir; for I feel so sorry\nfor everybody, and especially those who have brought him up, and those\nhe has made away with.\"\n\n\"Quite so, my dear madam; such are your fine feelings, springing from\nthe goodness of your nature. Pardon my saying that you could have no\nother, according to my experience of a most benevolent countenance. Part\nof my duty, and in such a case as yours, one of the pleasantest parts of\nit, is to study the expression of a truly benevolent--\"\n\n\"I am not that old, sir, asking of your pardon, to pretend to be\nbenevolent. All that I lay claim to is to look at things sensible.\"\n\n\"Certainly, yet with a tincture of high feeling. Now if it should happen\nthat this poor young man were of very high birth, perhaps the highest in\nthe county, and the heir to very large landed property, and a title,\nand all that sort of nonsense, you would look at him from the very same\npoint of view?\"\n\n\"That I would, sir, that I would. So long as he was proclaimed for\nhanging. But naturally bound, of course, to be more sorry for him.\"\n\n\"Yes, from sense of all the good things he must lose. There seems,\nhowever, to be strong ground for believing--as I may tell you, in\nconfidence, Dr. Upround does--that he had no more to do with it than you\nor I, ma'am. At first I concluded as you have done. I am going to see\nMrs. Carroway now. Till then I suspend my judgment.\"\n\n\"Now that is what nobody should do, Mr. Mordacks. I have tried, but\nnever found good come of it. To change your mind is two words against\nyourself; and you go wrong both ways, before and after.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly you do, ma'am. I never thought of that before. But you\nmust remember that we have not the gift of hitting--I might say of\nmaking--the truth with a flash or a dash, as you ladies have. May I be\nallowed to come again?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, sir, I am heartily sorry that you are going away\nat all. I could have talked to you all the afternoon; and how seldom I\nget the chance now, Lord knows. There is that in your conversation which\nmakes one feel quite sure of being understood; not so much in what you\nsay, sir--if you understand my meaning--as in the way you look, quite as\nif my meaning was not at all too quick for you. My good husband is of a\ngreater mind than I am, being nine-and-forty inches round the chest;\nbut his mind seems somehow to come after mine, the same as the ducks do,\ngoing down to our pond.\"\n\n\"Mistress Anerley, how thankful you should be! What a picture of\nconjugal felicity! But I thought that the drake always led the way?\"\n\n\"Never upon our farm, sir. When he doth, it is a proof of his being\ncrossed with wild-ducks. The same as they be round Flamborough.\"\n\n\"Oh, now I see the truth. How slow I am! It improves their flavor, at\nthe expense of their behavior. But seriously, madam, you are fit to take\nthe lead. What a pleasant visit I have had! I must brace myself up for a\nvery sad one now--a poor lady, with none to walk behind her.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure! It is very fine of me to talk. But if I was left\nwithout my husband, I should only care to walk after him. Please to give\nher my kind love, sir; though I have only seen her once. And if there is\nanything that we can do--\"\n\n\"If there is anything that we can do,\" said the farmer, coming out\nof his corn-chamber, \"we won't talk about it, but we'll do it, Mr.\nMoreducks.\"\n\nThe factor quietly dispersed this rebuke, by waving his hand at his two\nlegs of mutton and the cod, which had thawed in the stable. \"I knew that\nI should be too late,\" he said; \"her house will be full of such little\nthings as these, so warm is the feeling of the neighborhood. I guessed\nas much, and arranged with my butcher to take them back in that case;\nand he said they would eat all the better for the ride. But as for\nthe cod, perhaps you will accept him. I could never take him back to\nFlamborough.\"\n\n\"Ride away, sir, ride away,\" said the farmer, who had better not have\nmeasured swords with Mordacks. \"I were thinking of sending a cart over\nthere, so soon as the weather should be opening of the roads up. But\nthe children might be hankerin' after meat, the worse for all the\nsnow-time.\"\n\n\"It is almost impossible to imagine such a thing. Universally respected,\nsuddenly cut off, enormous family with hereditary hunger, all the\nneighbors well aware of straitened circumstances, the kindest-hearted\ncounty in Great Britain--sorrow and abundance must have cloyed their\nappetites, as at a wealthy man's funeral. What a fool I must have been\nnot to foresee all that!\"\n\n\"Better see than foresee,\" replied the farmer, who was crusty from\nremembering that he had done nothing. \"Neighbors likes to wait for\nneighbors to go in; same as two cows staring at a new-mown meadow.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nTHE WAY OF THE WORLD\n\n\nCliffs snow-mantled, and storm-ploughed sands, and dark gray billows\nfrilled with white, rolling and roaring to the shrill east wind, made\nthe bay of Bridlington a very different sight from the smooth fair\nscene of August. Scarcely could the staggering colliers, anchored under\nFlamborough Head (which they gladly would have rounded if they could),\nhold their own against wind and sea, although the outer spit of sand\ntempered as yet the full violence of waves.\n\nBut if everything looked cold and dreary, rough, and hard, and bare\nof beauty, the cottage of the late lieutenant, standing on the shallow\nbluff, beaten by the wind, and blinded of its windows from within, of\nall things looked the most forlorn, most desolate, and freezing. The\nwindward side was piled with snow, on the crest of which foam pellets\nlay, looking yellow by comparison, and melting small holes with their\nbrine. At the door no foot-mark broke the drift; and against the\nvaporous sky no warmer vapor tufted the chimney-pots.\n\n\"I am pretty nearly frozen again,\" said Mordacks; \"but that place sends\nanother shiver down my back. All the poor little devils must be icicles\nat least.\"\n\nAfter peeping through a blind, he turned pale betwixt his blueness, and\ngalloped to the public-house abutting on the quay. Here he marched into\nthe parlor, and stamped about, till a merry-looking landlord came to\nhim. \"Have a glass of hot, sir; how blue your nose is!\" the genial\nmaster said to him. The reply of the factor can not be written down in\nthese days of noble language. Enough that it was a terse malediction of\nthe landlord, the glass of hot, and even his own nose. Boniface was no\nYorkshireman, else would he have given as much as he got, at least in\nlingual currency. As it was, he considered it no affair of his if a\nguest expressed his nationality. \"You must have better orders than that\nto give, I hope, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I have. And you have got the better of me; which has happened\nto me three times this day already, because of the freezing of my wits,\nyoung man. Now you go in to your best locker, and bring me your very\nbest bottle of Cognac--none of your government stuff, you know, but a\nsample of your finest bit of smuggling. Why did I swear at a glass of\nhot? Why, because you are all such a set of scoundrels. I want a glass\nof hot as much as man ever did. But how can I drink it, when women and\nchildren are dying--perhaps dead, for all I know--for want of warmth and\nvictuals? Your next-door neighbors almost, and a woman, whose husband\nhas just been murdered! And here you are swizzling, and rattling your\ncoppers. Good God, sir! The Almighty from heaven would send orders to\nhave His own commandment broken.\"\n\nMr. Mordacks was excited, and the landlord saw no cause for it. \"What\nmakes you carry on like this?\" he said; \"it was only last night we was\ntalking in the tap-room of getting a subscription up, downright liberal.\nI said I was good for a crown, and take it out of the tick they owes me.\nAnd when you come to think of these hard times--\"\n\n\"Take that, and then tell me if you find them softer.\" Suiting the\naction to the word, the universal factor did something omitted on his\ncard in the list of his comprehensive functions. As the fat host\nturned away, to rub his hands, with a phosphoric feeling of his future\ngenerosity, a set of highly energetic toes, prefixed with the toughest\nYork leather, and tingling for exercise, made him their example. The\nlandlord flew up among his own pots and glasses, his head struck the\nceiling, which declined too long a taste of him, and anon a silvery ring\nannounced his return to his own timbers.\n\n\"Accept that neighborly subscription, my dear friend, and acknowledge\nits promptitude,\" said Mr. Mordacks; \"and now be quick about your\norders, peradventure a second flight might be less agreeable. Now don't\nshow any airs; you have been well treated, and should be thankful for\nthe facilities you have to offer. I know a poor man without any legs at\nall, who would be only too glad if he could do what you have done.\"\n\n\"Then his taste must be a queer one,\" the landlord replied, as he\nillustrated sadly the discovery reserved for a riper age--that human\nfingers have attained their present flexibility, form, and skill by\nhabit of assuaging, for some millions of ages, the woes of the human\nbody.\n\n\"Now don't waste my time like that,\" cried Mordacks; and seeing him\ndraw near again, his host became right active. \"Benevolence must be\ninculcated,\" continued the factor, following strictly in pursuit. \"I\nhave done you a world of good, my dear friend; and reflection will\ncompel you to heap every blessing on me.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" replied the landlord. It is certain, however,\nthat this exhibition of philanthropic vigor had a fine effect. In five\nminutes all the resources of the house were at the disposal of this\nrapid agent, who gave his orders right and left, clapped down a bag of\ncash, and took it up again, and said, \"Now just you mind my horse, twice\nas well as you mind your fellow-creatures. Take a leg of mutton out, and\nset it roasting. Have your biggest bed hot for a lot of frozen children.\nBy the Lord, if you don't look alive, I'll have you up for murder.\" As\nhe spoke, a stout fish-woman came in from the quay; and he beckoned to\nher, and took her with him.\n\n\"You can't come in,\" said a little weak voice, when Mr. Mordacks, having\nknocked in vain, began to prise open the cottage door. \"Mother is so\npoorly; and you mustn't think of coming in. Oh, whatever shall I do, if\nyou won't stop when I tell you?\"\n\n\"Where are all the rest of you? Oh, in the kitchen, are they? You poor\nlittle atomy, how many of you are dead?\"\n\n\"None of us dead, sir; without it is the baby;\" here Geraldine\nburst into a wailing storm of tears. \"I gave them every bit,\" she\nsobbed--\"every bit, sir, but the rush-lights; and them they wouldn't\neat, sir, or I never would have touched them. But mother is gone off her\nhead, and baby wouldn't eat it.\"\n\n\"You are a little heroine,\" said Mordacks, looking at her--the pinched\nface, and the hollow eyes, and the tottering blue legs of her. \"You are\ngreater than a queen. No queen forgets herself in that way.\"\n\n\"Please, sir, no; I ate almost a box of rush-lights, and they were only\ndone last night. Oh, if baby would have took to them!\"\n\n\"Hot bread and milk in this bottle; pour it out; feed her first, Molly,\"\nMr. Mordacks ordered. \"The world can't spare such girls as this. Oh, you\nwon't eat first! Very well; then the others shall not have a morsel till\nyour mouth is full. And they seem to want it bad enough. Where is the\ndead baby?\"\n\nIn the kitchen, where now they stood, not a spark of fire was lingering,\nbut some wood-ash still retained a feeble memory of warmth; and three\nlittle children (blest with small advance from babyhood) were huddling\naround, with hands, and faces, and sharp grimy knees poking in for\nlukewarm corners; while two rather senior young Carroways were lying\nfast asleep, with a jack-towel over them. But Tommy was not there;\nthat gallant Tommy, who had ridden all the way to Filey after dark, and\nbrought his poor father to the fatal place.\n\nMordacks, with his short, bitter-sweet smile, considered all these\nlittle ones. They were not beautiful, nor even pretty; one of them was\ntoo literally a chip of the old block, for he had reproduced his dear\nfather's scar; and every one of them wanted a \"wash and brush up,\" as\nwell as a warming and sound victualling. Corruptio optimi pessima. These\nchildren had always been so highly scrubbed, that the great molecular\nauthor of existence, dirt, resumed parental sway, with tenfold power\nof attachment and protection, the moment soap and flannel ceased their\nwicked usurpation.\n\n\"Please, sir, I couldn't keep them clean, I couldn't,\" cried Geraldine,\nchoking, both with bread and milk, and tears. \"I had Tommy to feed\nthrough the coal-cellar door; and all the bits of victuals in the house\nto hunt up; and it did get so dark, and it was so cold. I am frightened\nto think of what mother will say for my burning up all of her brushes,\nand the baskets. But please, sir, little Cissy was a-freezing at the\nnose.\"\n\nThe three little children at the grate were peeping back over the pits\nin their shoulders, half frightened at the tall, strange man, and half\nready to toddle to him for protection; while the two on the floor sat up\nand stared, and opened their mouths for their sister's bread and milk.\nThen Jerry flew to them, and squatted on the stones, and very nearly\nchoked them with her spoon and basin.\n\n\"Molly, take two in your apron, and be off,\" said the factor to the\nstout fish-woman--who was simply full of staring, and of crying out \"Oh\nlor!\"--\"pop them into the hot bed at once; they want warmth first, and\nvictuals by-and-by. Our wonderful little maid wants food most. I will\ncome after you with the other three. But I must see my little queen fill\nher own stomach first.\"\n\n\"But, please, sir, won't you let our Tommy out first?\" cried Jerry, as\nthe strong woman lapped up the two youngest in her woolsey apron and ran\noff with them. \"He has been so good, and he was too proud to cry so soon\nas ever he found out that mother couldn't hear him. And I gave him the\nmost to eat of anybody else, because of him being the biggest, sir. It\nwas all as black as ink, going under the door; but Tommy never minded.\"\n\n\"Wonderful merit! While you were eating tallow! Show me the coal-cellar,\nand out he comes. But why don't you speak of your poor mother, child?\"\n\nThe child, who had been so brave, and clever, self-denying, laborious,\nand noble, avoided his eyes, and began to lick her spoon, as if she had\nhad enough, starving though she was. She glanced up at the ceiling, and\nthen suddenly withdrew her eyes, and the blue lids trembled over them.\nMordacks saw that it was childhood's dread of death. \"Show me where\nlittle Tommy is,\" he said; \"we must not be too hard upon you, my dear.\nBut what made your mother lock you up, and carry on so?\"\n\n\"I don't know at all, sir,\" said Geraldine.\n\n\"Now don't tell a story,\" answered Mr. Mordacks. \"You were not meant\nfor lies; and you know all about it. I shall just go away if you tell\nstories.\"\n\n\"Then all I know is this,\" cried Jerry, running up to him, and\ndesperately clutching at his riding coat; \"the very night dear father\nwas put into the pit-hole--oh, hoo, oh, hoo, oh, hoo!\"\n\n\"Now we can't stop for that,\" said the general factor, as he took her up\nand kissed her, and the tears, which had vainly tried to stop, ran out\nof young eyes upon well-seasoned cheeks; \"you have been a wonder; I am\nlike a father to you. You must tell me quickly, or else how can I cure\nit? We will let Tommy out then, and try to save your mother.\"\n\n\"Mother was sitting in the window, sir,\" said the child, trying strongly\nto command herself, \"and I was to one side of her, and Tommy to the\nother, and none of us was saying anything. And then there came a bad,\nwicked face against the window, and the man said, 'What was it you said\nto-day, ma'am?' And mother stood up--she was quite right then--and she\nopened the window, and she looked right at him, and she said, 'I spoke\nthe truth, John Cadman. Between you and your God it rests.' And the man\nsaid, 'You shut your black mouth up, or you and your brats shall all go\nthe same way. Mind one thing--you've had your warning.' Then mother fell\naway, for she was just worn out; and she lay upon the floor, and she\nkept on moaning, 'There is no God! there is no God!' after all she have\ntaught us to say our prayers to. And there was nothing for baby to draw\never since.\"\n\nFor once in his life Mr. Mordacks held his tongue; and his face, which\nwas generally fiercer than his mind, was now far behind it in ferocity.\nHe thought within himself, \"Well, I am come to something, to have\nlet such things be going on in a matter which pertains to\nmy office--pigeon-hole 100! This comes of false delicacy, my\nstumbling-block perpetually! No more of that. Now for action.\"\n\nGeraldine looked up at him, and said, \"Oh, please, sir.\" And then she\nran off, to show the way toward little Tommy.\n\nThe coal-cellar flew open before the foot of Mordacks; but no Tommy\nappeared, till his sister ran in. The poor little fellow was quite\ndazzled with the light; and the grime on his cheeks made the inrush\nof fresh air come like wasps to him. \"Now, Tommy, you be good,\" said\nGeraldine; \"trouble enough has been made about you.\"\n\nThe boy put out his under lip, and blinked with great amazement. After\nsuch a quantity of darkness and starvation, to be told to be good was\na little too bad. His sense of right and wrong became fluid with\nconfusion; he saw no sign of anything to eat; and the loud howl of an\ninjured heart began to issue from the coaly rampart of neglected teeth.\n\n\"Quite right, my boy,\" Mr. Mordacks said. \"You have had a bad time, and\nare entitled to lament. Wipe your nose on your sleeve, and have at it\nagain.\"\n\n\"Dirty, dirty things I hear. Who is come into my house like this? My\nhouse and my baby belong to me. Go away all of you. How can I bear this\nnoise?\"\n\nMrs. Carroway stood in the passage behind them, looking only fit to die.\nOne of her husband's watch-coats hung around her, falling nearly to her\nfeet; and the long clothes of her dead baby, which she carried, hung\nover it, shaking like a white dog's tail. She was standing with her bare\nfeet well apart, and that swing of hip and heel alternate which mothers\nfor a thousand generations have supposed to lull their babies into sweet\nsleep.\n\nFor once in his life the general factor had not the least idea of the\nproper thing to do. Not only did he not find it, but he did not even\nseek for it, standing aside rather out of the way, and trying to look\nlike a calm spectator. But this availed him to no account whatever. He\nwas the only man there, and the woman naturally fixed upon him.\n\n\"You are the man,\" she said, in a quiet and reasonable voice, and coming\nup to Mordacks with the manner of a lady; \"you are the gentleman, I\nmean, who promised to bring back my husband. Where is he? Have you\nfulfilled your promise?\"\n\n\"My dear madam, my dear madam, consider your children, and how cold you\nare. Allow me to conduct you to a warmer place. You scarcely seem to\nenter into the situation.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I do, sir; thoroughly, thoroughly. My husband is in his grave;\nmy children are going after him; and the best place for them. But they\nshall not be murdered. I will lock them up, so that they never shall be\nmurdered.\"\n\n\"My dear lady, I agree with you entirely. You do the very wisest thing\nin these bad times. But you know me well. I have had the honor of making\nyour acquaintance in a pleasant manner. I feel for your children, quite\nas if I was--I mean, ma'am, a very fine old gentleman's affection.\nGeraldine, come and kiss me, my darling. Tommy, you may have the other\nside; never mind the coal, my boy; there is a coal-wharf quite close to\nmy windows at home.\"\n\nThese children, who had been hiding behind Mr. Mordacks and Molly (who\nwas now come back), immediately did as he ordered them; or rather Jerry\nled the way, and made Tommy come as well, by a signal which he never\ndurst gainsay. But while they saluted the general factor (who sat down\nupon a box to accommodate them), from the corners of their eyes they\nkept a timid, trembling, melancholy watch upon their own mother.\n\nPoor Mrs. Carroway was capable of wondering. Her power of judgment was\nnot so far lost as it is in a dream--where we wonder at nothing, but\ncast off skeptic misery--and for the moment she seemed to be brought\nhome from the distance of roving delusion, by looking at two of her\nchildren kissing a man who was hunting in his pocket for his card.\n\n\"Circumstances, madam,\" said Mr. Mordacks, \"have deprived me of the\npleasure of producing my address. It should be in two of my pockets; but\nit seems to have strangely escaped from both of them. However, I will\nwrite it down, if required. Geraldine dear, where is your school slate?\nGo and look for it, and take Tommy with you.\"\n\nThis surprised Mrs. Carroway, and began to make her think. These were\nher children--she was nearly sure of that--her own poor children, who\nwere threatened from all sides with the likelihood of being done away\nwith. Yet here was a man who made much of them, and kissed them; and\nthey kissed him without asking her permission!\n\n\"I scarcely know what it is about,\" she said; \"and my husband is not\nhere to help me.\"\n\n\"You have hit the very point, ma'am. You must take it on yourself. How\nwonderfully clever the ladies always are! Your family is waiting for\na government supply; everybody knows that everybody in the world may\nstarve before government thinks of supplying supply. I do not belong to\nthe government--although if I had my deserts I should have done so--but\nfully understanding them, I step in to anticipate their action. I see\nthat the children of a very noble officer, and his admirable wife, have\nbeen neglected, through the rigor of the weather and condition of the\nroads. I am a very large factor in the neighborhood, who make a good\nthing out of all such cases. I step in; circumstances favor me; I\ndiscover a good stroke of business; my very high character, though much\nobscured by diffidence, secures me universal confidence. The little\ndears take to me, and I to them. They feel themselves safe under my\nprotection from their most villainous enemies. They are pleased to kiss\na man of strength and spirit, who represents the government.\"\n\nMrs. Carroway scarcely understood a jot of this. Such a rush of words\nmade her weak brain go round, and she looked about vainly for her\nchildren, who had gladly escaped upon the chance afforded. But she came\nto the conclusion she was meant to come to--that this gentleman before\nher was the government.\n\n\"I will do whatever I am told,\" she said, looking miserably round, as if\nfor anything to care about; \"only I must count my children first, or the\ngovernment might say there was not the proper number.\"\n\n\"Of all points that is the very one that I would urge,\" Mordacks\nanswered, without dismay. \"Molly, conduct this good lady to her room.\nLight a good fire, as the Commissioners have ordered; warm the soup sent\nfrom the arsenal last night, but be sure that you put no pepper in\nit. The lady will go with you, and follow our directions. She sees the\nimportance of having all her faculties perfectly clear when we make\nour schedule, as we shall do in a few hours' time, of all the children;\nevery one, with the date of their birth, and their Christian names,\nwhich nobody knows so well as their own dear mother. Ah, how very sweet\nit is to have so many of them; and to know the pride, the pleasure, the\ndelight, which the nation feels in providing for the welfare of every\nlittle darling!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nTHE THING IS JUST\n\n\n\"Was there ever such a man?\" said Mr. Mordacks to himself, as he rode\nback to Flamborough against the bitter wind, after \"fettling\" the\naffairs of the poor Carroways, as well as might be for the present.\n\"As if I had not got my hands too full already, now I am in for another\nplaguesome business, which will cost a lot of money, instead of bringing\nmoney in. How many people have I now to look after? In the first place,\ntwo vile wretches--Rickon Goold, the ship-scuttler, and John Cadman, the\nmurderer--supposing that Dr. Upandown and Mrs. Carroway are right. Then\ntwo drunken tars, with one leg between them, who may get scared of the\nlaw, and cut and run. Then an outlawed smuggler, who has cut and\nrun already; and a gentleman from India, who will be wild with\ndisappointment through the things that have happened since I saw him\nlast. After that a lawyer, who will fight tooth and nail of course,\nbecause it brings grist to his mill. That makes seven; and now to all\nthese I have added number eight, and that the worst of all--not only\na woman, but a downright mad one, as well as seven starving children.\nCharity is a thing that pays so slowly! That this poor creature should\nlose her head just now is most unfortunate. I have nothing whatever to\nlay before Sir Duncan, when I tell him of this vile catastrophe, except\nthe boy's own assertion, and the opinion of Dr. Upandown. Well, well,\n'faint heart,' etc. I must nurse the people round; without me they would\nall have been dead. Virtue is its own reward. I hope the old lady has\nnot burned my hare to death.\"\n\nThe factor might well say that without his aid that large family must\nhave perished. Their neighbors were not to be blamed for this, being\nlocked out of the house, and having no knowledge of the frost and famine\nthat prevailed within. Perhaps, when the little ones began to die,\nGeraldine might heave escaped from a window, and got help in time to\nsave some of them, if she herself had any strength remaining; but as it\nwas, she preferred to sacrifice herself, and obey her mother. \"Father\nalways told me,\" she had said to Mr. Mordacks, when he asked her how so\nsharp a child could let things come to such a pitch, \"that when he was\nout of the way, the first thing I was to mind always was to do what\nmother told me; and now he can't come back no more, to let me off from\ndoing it.\"\n\nBy this time the \"Cod with the Hook in his Gills\" was as much at the\nmercy of Mr. Mordacks as if he had landed and were crimping him. Widow\nPrecious was a very tough lady to get over, and she liked to think\nthe worst she could of everybody--which proves in the end the most\ncharitable course, because of the good-will produced by explanation--and\nfor some time she had stood in the Flamburian attitude of doubt toward\nthe factor. But even a Flamburian may at last be pierced; and then\n(as with other pachydermatous animals) the hole, once made, is almost\ncertain to grow larger. So by dint of good offices here and there, kind\ninterest, and great industry among a very simple and grateful race,\nhe became the St. Oswald of that ancient shrine (as already has been\nhinted), and might do as he liked, even on the Sabbath-day. And as one\nof the first things he always liked to do was to enter into everybody's\nbusiness, he got into an intricacy of little knowledge too manifold even\nfor his many-fibred brain. But some of this ran into and strengthened\nhis main clew, leading into the story he was laboring to explore,\nand laying before him, as bright as a diamond, even the mystery of\near-rings.\n\n\"My highly valued hostess and admirable cook,\" he said to Widow\nPrecious, after making noble dinner, which his long snowy ride and work\nat Bridlington had earned, \"in your knowledge of the annals of this\ninteresting town, happen you to be able to recall the name of a certain\nman, John Cadman?\"\n\n\"Ah, that ah deah,\" Widow Tapsy answered, with a heavy sigh, which\nrattled all the dishes on the waiter; \"and sma' gude o' un, sma' gude,\nwhativer. Geroot wi' un!\"\n\nThe landlady shut her firm lips with a smack, which Mordacks well knew\nby this time though seldom foreclosed by it now, as he had been before\nhe became a Danish citizen. He was sure that she had some good reason\nfor her silence; and the next day he found that the girl who had left\nher home, through Cadman's villainy, was akin by her mother's side to\nMistress Precious. But he had another matter to discuss with her now,\nwhich caused him some misgivings, yet had better be faced manfully. In\nthe safe philosophical distance of York from this strong landlady he had\n(for good reasons of his own) appointed the place of meeting with\nSir Duncan Yordas at the rival hostelry, the inn of Thornwick. Widow\nPrecious had a mind of uncommonly large type, so lofty and pure of all\npetty emotions, that if any one spoke of the Thornwick Inn, even upon\nher back premises, her dignity stepped in and said, \"I can't abide the\nstinkin' naam o' un.\"\n\nOf this persistently noble regard of a lower institution Mr. Mordacks\nwas well aware; and it gave him pause, in his deep anxiety to spare a\ntender heart, and maintain the high standard of his breakfast kidneys.\n\"Madam,\" he began, and then he rubbed his mouth with the cross-cut out\nof the jack-towel by the sink, newly set on table, to satisfy him for a\ndinner napkin--\"madam, will you listen, while I make an explanation?\"\n\nThe landlady looked at him with dark suspicions gathering.\n\n\"Joost spak' oot,\" she said, \"whativer's woorkin' i' thah mahnd.\"\n\n\"I am bound to meet a gentleman near Flamborough to-morrow,\" Mr.\nMordacks continued, with the effrontery of guilt, \"who will come\nfrom the sea. And as it would not suit him to walk far inland, he has\narranged for the interview at a poor little place called the Thorny\nWick, or the Stubby Wick, or something of that sort. I thought it was\ndue to you, madam, to explain the reason of my entering, even for a\nmoment--\"\n\n\"Ah dawn't care. Sitha--they mah fettle thee there, if thow's fondhead\nenew.\"\n\nWithout another word she left the room, clattering her heavy shoes at\nthe door; and Mordacks foresaw a sad encounter on the morrow, without a\ngood breakfast to \"fettle\" him for it. It was not in his nature to dread\nanything much, and he could not see where he had been at all to blame;\nbut gladly would he have taken ten per cent off his old contract, than\nmeet Sir Duncan Yordas with the news he had to tell him.\n\nOne cause of the righteous indignation felt by the good mother Tapsy,\nwas her knowledge that nobody could land just now in any cove under the\nThornwick Hotel. With the turbulent snow-wind bringing in the sea, as\nnow it had been doing for several days, even the fishermen's cobles\ncould not take the beach, much less any stranger craft. Mr. Mordacks was\nsharp; but an inland factor is apt to overlook such little facts marine.\n\nUpon the following day he stood in the best room of the Thornwick\nInn--which even then was a very decent place to any eyes uncast with\nenvy--and he saw the long billows of the ocean rolling before the steady\nblowing of the salt-tongued wind, and the broad white valleys that\nbetween them lay, and the vaporous generation of great waves. They\nseemed to have little gift of power for themselves, and no sign of any\nheed of purport; only to keep at proper distance from each other, and\nthreaten to break over long before they meant to do it. But to see what\nthey did at the first opposition of reef, or crag, or headland bluff,\nwas a cure for any delusion about them, or faith in their liquid\nbenevolence. For spouts of wild fury dashed up into the clouds; and the\nshore, wherever any sight of it was left, weltered in a sadly frothsome\nstate, like the chin of a Titan with a lather-brush at work.\n\n\"Why, bless my heart!\" cried the keen-eyed Mordacks; \"this is a check I\nnever thought of. Nobody could land in such a surf as that, even if he\nhad conquered all India. Landlord, do you mean to tell me any one could\nland? And if not, what's the use of your inn standing here?\"\n\n\"Naw, sir, nawbody cud laun' joost neaw. Lee-ast waas, nut to ca' fur\nnaw yell to dry hissen.\"\n\nThe landlord was pleased with his own wit--perhaps by reason of its\nscarcity--and went out to tell it in the tap-room while fresh; and\nMordacks had made up his mind to call for something--for the good of\nthe house and himself--and return with a sense of escape to his own\ninn, when the rough frozen road rang with vehement iron, and a horse was\npulled up, and a man strode in. The landlord having told his own joke\nthree times, came out with the taste of it upon his lips; but the stern\ndark eyes looking down into his turned his smile into a frightened\nstare. He had so much to think of that he could not speak--which happens\nnot only at Flamborough--but his visitor did not wait for the solution\nof his mental stutter. Without any rudeness he passed the mooning host,\nand walked into the parlor, where he hoped to find two persons.\n\nInstead of two, he found one only, and that one standing with his back\nto the door, and by the snow-flecked window, intent upon the drizzly\ndistance of the wind-struck sea. The attitude and fixed regard were so\nunlike the usual vivacity of Mordacks, that the visitor thought there\nmust be some mistake, till the other turned round and looked at him.\n\n\"You see a defeated but not a beaten man,\" said the factor, to get\nthrough the worst of it. \"Thank you, Sir Duncan, I will not shake hands.\nMy ambition was to do so, and to put into yours another hand, more near\nand dear to it. Sir, I have failed. It is open to you to call me by\nany hard name that may occur to you. That will do you good, be a hearty\nrelief, and restore me rapidly to self-respect, by arousing my anxiety\nto vindicate myself.\"\n\n\"It is no time for joking; I came here to meet my son. Have you found\nhim, or have you not?\"\n\nSir Duncan sat down and gazed steadfastly at Mordacks. His self-command\nhad borne many hard trials; but the prime of his life was over now; and\nstrong as he looked, and thought himself, the searching wind had sought\nand found weak places in a sun-beaten frame. But no man would be of\nnoble aspect by dwelling at all upon himself.\n\nThe quick intelligence of Mordacks--who was of smaller though admirable\ntype--entered into these things at a flash. And throughout their\ninterview he thought less of himself and more of another than was at all\nhabitual with him, or conducive to good work.\n\n\"You must bear with a very heavy blow,\" he said; \"and it goes to my\nheart to have to deal it.\"\n\nSir Duncan Yordas bowed, and said, \"The sooner the better, my good\nfriend.\"\n\n\"I have found your son, as I promised you I would,\" replied Mordacks,\nspeaking rapidly; \"healthy, active, uncommonly clever; a very fine\nsailor, and as brave as Nelson; of gallant appearance--as might be\nexpected; enterprising, steadfast, respected, and admired; benevolent\nin private life, and a public benefactor. A youth of whom the most\ndistinguished father might be proud. But--but--\"\n\n\"Will you never finish?\"\n\n\"But by the force of circumstances, over which he had no control, he\nbecame in early days a smuggler, and rose to an eminent rank in that\nprofession.\"\n\n\"I do not care two pice for that; though I should have been sorry if he\nhad not risen.\"\n\n\"He rose to such eminence as to become the High Admiral of smugglers on\nthis coast, and attain the honors of outlawry.\"\n\n\"I look upon that as a pity. But still we may be able to rescind it. Is\nthere anything more against my son?\"\n\n\"Unluckily there is. A commander of the Coastguard has been killed in\ndischarge of his duty; and Robin Lyth has left the country to escape a\nwarrant.\"\n\n\"What have we to do with Robin Lyth? I have heard of him everywhere--a\nvillain and a murderer.\"\n\n\"God forbid that you should say so! Robin Lyth is your only son.\"\n\nThe man whose word was law to myriads rose without a word for his own\ncase; he looked at his agent with a stern, calm gaze, and not a sign of\ntrembling in his lull broad frame, unless, perhaps, his under lip gave a\nlittle soft vibration to the grizzled beard grown to meet the change of\nclimate.\n\n\"Unhappily so it is,\" said Mordacks, firmly meeting Sir Duncan's eyes.\n\"I have proved the matter beyond dispute; and I wish I had better news\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir. You could not well have worse. I believe it upon your\nword alone. No Yordas ever yet had pleasure of a son. The thing is quite\njust. I will order my horse.\"\n\n\"Sir Duncan, allow me a few minutes first. You are a man of large\njudicial mind. Do you ever condemn any stranger upon rumor? And will\nyou, upon that, condemn your son?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I proceed upon my knowledge of the fate between father\nand son in our race.\"\n\n\"That generally has been the father's fault. In this case, you are the\nfather.\"\n\nSir Duncan turned back, being struck with this remark. Then he sat down\nagain; which his ancestors had always refused to do, and had rued it. He\nspoke very gently, with a sad faint smile.\n\n\"I scarcely see how, in the present case, the fault can be upon the\nfather's side.\"\n\n\"Not as yet, I grant you. But it would be so if the father refused to\nhear out the matter, and joined in the general outcry against his son,\nwithout even having seen him, or afforded him a chance of self-defense.\"\n\n\"I am not so unjust or unnatural as that, sir. I have heard much about\nthis--sad occurrence in the cave. There can be no question that the\nsmugglers slew the officer. That--that very unfortunate young man may\nnot have done it himself--I trust in God that he did not even mean it.\nNevertheless, in the eye of the law, if he were present, he is as guilty\nas if his own hand did it. Can you contend that he was not present?\"\n\n\"Unhappily I can not. He himself admits it; and if he did not, it could\nbe proved most clearly.\"\n\n\"Then all that I can do,\" said Sir Duncan, rising with a heavy sigh, and\na violent shiver caused by the chill of his long bleak ride, \"is first\nto require your proofs, Mr. Mordacks, as to the identity of my child who\nsailed from India with this--this unfortunate youth; then to give you\na check for 5000 pounds, and thank you for skillful offices, and great\nconfidence in my honor. Then I shall leave with you what sum you may\nthink needful for the defense, if he is ever brought to trial. And\nprobably after that--well, I shall even go back to end my life in\nIndia.\"\n\n\"My proofs are not arranged yet, but they will satisfy you. I shall take\nno 5000 pounds from you, Sir Duncan, though strictly speaking I have\nearned it. But I will take one thousand to cover past and future outlay,\nincluding the possibility of a trial. The balance I shall live to claim\nyet, I do believe, and you to discharge it with great pleasure. For\nthat will not be until I bring you a son, not only acquitted, but also\nguiltless; as I have good reason for believing him to be. But you do not\nlook well; let me call for something.\"\n\n\"No, thank you. It is nothing. I am quite well, but not quite seasoned\nto my native climate yet. Tell me your reasons for believing that.\"\n\n\"I can not do that in a moment. You know what evidence is a hundred\ntimes as well as I do. And in this cold room you must not stop. Sir\nDuncan, I am not a coddler any more than you are. And I do not presume\nto dictate to you. But I am as resolute a man as yourself. And I refuse\nto go further with this subject, until you are thoroughly warmed and\nrefreshed.\"\n\n\"Mordacks, you shall have your way,\" said his visitor, after a\nheavy frown, which produced no effect upon the factor. \"You are as\nkind-hearted as you are shrewd. Tell me once more what your conviction\nis; and I will wait for your reasons, till--till you are ready.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, my settled conviction is that your son is purely innocent of\nthis crime, and that we shall be able to establish that.\"\n\n\"God bless you for thinking so, my dear friend. I can bear a great deal;\nand I would do my duty. But I did love that boy's mother so.\"\n\nThe general factor always understood his business; and he knew that no\npart of it compelled him now to keep watch upon the eyes of a stern,\nproud man.\n\n\"Sir, I am your agent, and I magnify mine office,\" he said, as he took\nup his hat to go forth. \"One branch of my duty is to fettle your horse;\nand in Flamborough they fettle them on stale fish.\" Mr. Mordacks strode\nwith a military tramp, and a loud shout for the landlord, who had\nfinished his joke by this time, and was paying the penalties of\nreaction. \"Gil Beilby, thoo'st nobbut a fondhead,\" he was saying to\nhimself. \"Thoo mun hev thy lahtel jawk, thof it crack'th thy own pure\nback.\" For he thought that he was driving two great customers away,\nby the flashing independence of too brilliant a mind; and many clever\npeople of his native place had told him so. \"Make a roaring fire in that\nroom,\" said Mordacks.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nSTUMPED OUT\n\n\n\"I think, my dear, that you never should allow mysterious things to be\ndoing in your parish, and everybody full of curiosity about them, while\nthe only proper person to explain their meaning is allowed to remain\nwithout any more knowledge than a man locked up in York Castle might\nhave. In spite of all the weather, and the noise the sea makes, I feel\nquite certain that important things, which never have any right to\nhappen in our parish, are going on here, and you never interfere; which\non the part of the rector, and the magistrate of the neighborhood, to\nmy mind is not a proper course of action. I am sure that I have not\nthe very smallest curiosity; I feel very often that I should have asked\nquestions, when it has become too late to do so, and when anybody else\nwould have put them at the moment, and not had to be sorry afterward.\"\n\n\"I understand that feeling,\" Dr. Upround answered, looking at his wife\nfor the third cup of coffee to wind up his breakfast as usual, \"and\nwithout hesitation I reply that it naturally arises in superior natures.\nJanetta, you have eaten up that bit of broiled hake that I was keeping\nfor your dear mother!\"\n\n\"Now really, papa, you are too crafty. You put my mother off with a\nwretched generality, because you don't choose to tell her anything; and\nto stop me from coming to the rescue, you attack me with a miserable\nlittle personality. I perceive by your face, papa, every trick that\nrises; and without hesitation I reply that they naturally arise in\ninferior natures.\"\n\n\"Janetta, you never express yourself well.\" Mrs. Upround insisted upon\nfilial respect. \"When I say 'well,' I mean--Well, well, well, you know\nquite well what I mean, Janetta.\"\n\n\"To be sure, mamma, I always do. You always mean the very best meaning\nin the world; but you are not up to half of papa's tricks yet.\"\n\n\"This is too bad!\" cried the father, with a smile.\n\n\"A great deal too bad!\" said the mother, with a frown. \"I am sure I\nwould never have asked a word of anything, if I could ever have imagined\nsuch behavior. Go away, Janetta, this very moment; your dear father\nevidently wants to tell me something. Now, my dear, you were too sleepy\nlast night; but your peace of mind requires you to unburden itself at\nonce of all these very mysterious goings on.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I shall have no peace of mind unless I do,\" said the\nrector, with a slight sarcasm, which missed her altogether; \"only it\nmight save trouble, my dear, if you would first specify the points which\noppress your--or rather I should say, perhaps, my mind so much.\"\n\n\"In the first place, then,\" began Mrs. Upround, drawing nearer to the\ndoctor, \"who is that highly distinguished stranger who can not get away\nfrom the Thornwick Inn? What made him come to such a place in dreadful\nweather; and if he is ill, why not send for Dr. Stirbacks? Dr. Stirbacks\nwill think it most unkind of you; and after all he did for dear Janetta.\nAnd then, again, what did the milkman from Sewerby mean by the way he\nshook his head this morning, about something in the family at Anerley\nFarm? And what did that most unaccountable man, who calls himself Mr.\nMordacks--though I don't believe that is his name at all--\"\n\n\"Yes, it is, my dear; you never should say such things. He is well known\nat York, and for miles around; and I entertain very high respect for\nhim.\"\n\n\"So you may, Dr. Upround. You do that too freely; but Janetta quite\nagrees with me about him. A man with a sword, that goes slashing about,\nand kills a rat, that was none of his business! A more straightforward\ncreature than himself, I do believe, though he struts like a soldier\nwith a ramrod. And what did he mean, in such horrible weather, by\ndragging you out to take a deposition in a place even colder than\nFlamborough itself--that vile rabbit-warren on the other side of\nBempton? Deposition of a man who had drunk himself to death--and a\nMethodist too, as you could not help saying.\"\n\n\"I said it, I know; and I am ashamed of saying it. I was miserably cold,\nand much annoyed about my coat.\"\n\n\"You never say anything to be ashamed of. It is when you do not say\nthings that you should rather blame yourself. For instance, I feel no\ncuriosity whatever, but a kind-hearted interest, in the doings of my\nneighbors. We very seldom get any sort of excitement; and when exciting\nthings come all together, quite within the hearing of our stable bell,\nto be left to guess them out, and perhaps be contradicted, destroys\none's finest feelings, and produces downright fidgets.\"\n\n\"My dear, my dear, you really should endeavor to emancipate yourself\nfrom such small ideas.\"\n\n\"Large words shall never divert me from my duty. My path of duty is\ndistinctly traced; and if a thwarting hand withdraws me from it, it must\nend in a bilious headache.\"\n\nThis was a terrible menace to the household, which was always thrown out\nof its course for three days when the lady became thus afflicted.\n\n\"My first duty is to my wife,\" said the rector. \"If people come into my\nparish with secrets, which come to my knowledge without my desire, and\nwithout official obligation, and the faithful and admirable partner of\nmy life threatens to be quite unwell--\"\n\n\"Ill, dear, very ill--is what would happen to me.\"\n\n\"--then I consider that my duty is to impart to her everything that can\nnot lead to mischief.\"\n\n\"How could you have any doubt of it, my dear? And as to the mischief, I\nam the proper judge of that.\"\n\nDr. Upround laughed in his quiet inner way; and then, as a matter\nof form, he said, \"My dear, you must promise most faithfully to keep\nwhatever I tell you as the very strictest secret.\"\n\nMrs. Upround looked shocked at the mere idea of her ever doing\notherwise; which indeed, as she said, was impossible. Her husband very\nnearly looked as if he quite believed her; and then they went into his\nsnug sitting-room, while the maid took away the breakfast things.\n\n\"Now don't keep me waiting,\" said the lady.\n\n\"Well, then, my dear,\" the rector began, after crossing stout legs\nstoutly, \"you must do your utmost not to interrupt me, and, in short--to\nput it courteously--you must try to hold your tongue, and suffer\nmuch astonishment in silence. We have a most distinguished visitor in\nFlamborough setting up his staff at the Thornwick Hotel.\"\n\n\"Lord Nelson! I knew it must be. Janetta is so quick at things.\"\n\n\"Janetta is too quick at things; and she is utterly crazy about Nelson.\nNo; it is the famous Sir Duncan Yordas.\"\n\n\"Sir Duncan Yordas! Why, I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"You will find that you have heard of him when you come to think,\nmy dear. Our Harry is full of his wonderful doings. He is one of the\nforemost men in India, though perhaps little heard of in this country\nyet. He belongs to an ancient Yorkshire family, and is, I believe, the\nhead of it. He came here looking for his son, but has caught a most\nterrible chill, instead of him; and I think we ought to send him some of\nyour rare soup.\"\n\n\"How sensible you are! It will be the very thing. But first of all, what\ncharacter does he bear? They do such things in India.\"\n\n\"His character is spotless; I might say too romantic. He is a man of\nmagnificent appearance, large mind, and lots of money.\"\n\n\"My dear, my dear, he must never stay there. I shudder to think of it,\nthis weather. A chill is a thing upon the kidneys always. You know my\nelectuary; and if we bring him round, it is high time for Janetta to\nbegin to think of settling.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" said Dr. Upround; \"well, how suddenly you jump! I must put\non my spectacles to look at you. This gentleman must be getting on for\nfifty!\"\n\n\"Janetta should have a man of some discretion, somebody she would not\ndare to snap at. Her expressions are so reckless, that a young man would\nnot suit her. She ought to have some one to look up to; and you know how\nshe raves about fame, and celebrity, and that. She really seems to care\nfor very little else.\"\n\n\"Then she ought to have fallen in love with Robin Lyth, the most famous\nman in all this neighborhood.\"\n\n\"Dr. Upround, you say things on purpose to provoke me when my remarks\nare unanswerable. Robin Lyth indeed! A sailor, a smuggler, a common\nworking-man! And under that terrible accusation!\"\n\n\"An objectionable party altogether; not even desirable as a grandson.\nTherefore say nothing more of Janetta and Sir Duncan.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, my dear, the chief object of your existence seems to be to\nirritate me. What can poor Robin have to do with Sir Duncan Yordas?\"\n\n\"Simply this. He is his only son. The proofs were completed, and\ndeposited with me for safe custody, last night, by that very active man\nof business, Geoffrey Mordacks, of York city.\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Mrs. Upround, with both hands lifted, and a high color\nflowing into her unwrinkled cheeks; \"from this day forth I shall never\nhave any confidence in you again. How long--if I may dare to put any\nsort of question--have you been getting into all this very secret\nknowledge? And why have I never heard a word of it till now? And not\neven now, I do believe, through any proper urgency of conscience on your\npart, but only because I insisted upon knowing. Oh, Dr. Upround, for\nshame! for shame!\"\n\n\"My dear, you have no one but yourself to blame,\" her husband replied,\nwith a sweet and placid smile. \"Three times I have told you things that\nwere to go no further, and all three of them went twenty miles within\nthree days. I do not complain of it; far less of you. You may have felt\nit quite as much your duty to spread knowledge as I felt it mine to\nrestrict it. And I never should have let you get all this out of me now,\nif it had been at all incumbent upon me to keep it quiet.\"\n\n\"That means that I have never got it out of you at all. I have taken all\nthis trouble for nothing.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, not at all. You have worked well, and have promised not\nto say a word about it. You might not have known it for a week at least,\nexcept for my confidence in you.\"\n\n\"Much of it I thank you for. But don't be cross, my dear, because you\nhave behaved so atrociously. You have not answered half of my questions\nyet.\"\n\n\"Well, there were so many, that I scarcely can remember them. Let me\nsee: I have told you who the great man is, and the reason that brought\nhim to Flamborough. Then about the dangerous chill he has taken; it came\nthrough a bitter ride from Scarborough; and if Dr. Stirbacks came, he\nwould probably make it still more dangerous. At least so Mordacks says;\nand the patient is in his hands, and out of mine; so that Stirbacks\ncan not be aggrieved with us. On the other hand, as to the milkman from\nSewerby. I really do not know why he shook his head. Perhaps he found\nthe big pump frozen. He is not of my parish, and may shake his head\nwithout asking my permission. Now I think that I have answered nearly\nall your questions.\"\n\n\"Not at all; I have not had time to ask them yet, because I feel so\nmuch above them. But if the milkman meant nothing, because of his not\nbelonging to our parish, the butcher does, and he can have no excuse.\nHe says that Mr. Mordacks takes all the best meanings of a mutton-sheep\nevery other day to Burlington.\"\n\n\"I know he does. And it ought to put us to the blush that a stranger\nshould have to do so. Mordacks is finding clothes, food, and firing for\nall the little creatures poor Carroway left, and even for his widow,\nwho has got a wandering mind. Without him there would not have been one\nleft. The poor mother locked in all her little ones, and starved them,\nto save them from some quite imaginary foe. The neighbors began to think\nof interfering, and might have begun to do it when it was all over.\nHappily, Mordacks arrived just in time. His promptitude, skill, and\ngenerosity saved them. Never say a word against that man again.\"\n\n\"My dear, I will not,\" Mrs. Upround answered, with tears coming into her\nkindly eyes. \"I never heard of anything more pitiful. I had no idea\nMr. Mordacks was so good. He looks more like an evil spirit. I always\nregarded him as an evil spirit; and his name sounds like it, and he\njumps about so. But he ought to have gone to the rector of the parish.\"\n\n\"It is a happy thing that he can jump about. The rector of the parish\ncan not do so, as you know; and he lives two miles away from them, and\nhad never even heard of it. People always talk about the rector of a\nparish as if he could be everywhere and see to everything. And few\nof them come near him in their prosperous times. Have you any other\nquestions to put to me, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, a quantity of things which I can not think of now. How it was that\nlittle boy--I remember it like yesterday--came ashore here, and turned\nout to be Robin Lyth; or at least to be no Robin Lyth at all, but the\nson of Sir Duncan Yordas. And what happened to the poor man in Bempton\nWarren.\"\n\n\"The poor man died a most miserable death, but I trust sincerely\npenitent. He had led a sad, ungodly life, and he died at last of wooden\nlegs. He was hunted to his grave, he told us, by these wooden legs; and\nhe recognized in them Divine retribution, for the sin of his life was\ncommitted in timber. No sooner did any of those legs appear--and the\npoor fellow said they were always coming--than his heart began to\npatter, and his own legs failed him, and he tried to stop his ears, but\nhis conscience would not let him.\"\n\n\"Now there!\" cried Mrs. Upround; \"what the power of conscience is! He\nhad stolen choice timber, perhaps ready-made legs.\"\n\n\"A great deal worse than that, my dear; he had knocked out a knot as\nlarge as my shovel-hat from the side of a ship home bound from India,\nbecause he was going to be tried for mutiny upon their arrival at Leith,\nit was, I think. He and his partners had been in irons, but unluckily\nthey were just released. The weather was magnificent, a lovely summer's\nnight, soft fair breeze, and every one rejoicing in the certainty of\nhome within a few short hours. And they found home that night, but it\nwas in a better world.\"\n\n\"You have made me creep all over. And you mean to say that a wretch like\nthat has any hope of heaven! How did he get away himself?\"\n\n\"Very easily. A little boat was towing at the side. There were only\nthree men upon deck, through the beauty of the weather, and two of those\nwere asleep. They bound and gagged the waking one, lashed the wheel,\nand made off in the boat wholly unperceived. There was Rickon Goold, the\nringleader, and four others, and they brought away a little boy who was\nlying fast asleep, because one of them had been in the service of his\nfather, and because of the value of his Indian clothes, which his ayah\nmade him wear now in his little cot for warmth. The scoundrels took\ngood care that none should get away to tell the tale. They saw the poor\nGolconda sink with every soul on board, including the captain's wife and\nbabies; then they made for land, and in the morning fog were carried by\nthe tide toward our North Landing. One of them knew the coast as well\nas need be; but they durst not land until their story was concocted, and\neverything fitted in to suit it. The sight of the rising sun, scattering\nthe fog, frightened them, as it well might do; and they pulled into the\ncave, from which I always said, as you may now remember, Robin must have\ncome--the cave which already bears his name.\n\n\"Here they remained all day, considering a plausible tale to account\nfor themselves, without making mention of any lost ship, and trying to\nremove every trace of identity from the boat they had stolen. They had\nbrought with them food enough to last three days, and an anker of\nrum from the steward's stores; and as they grew weary of their long\nconfinement, they indulged more freely than wisely in the consumption of\nthat cordial. In a word, they became so tipsy that they frightened\nthe little helpless boy; and when they began to fight about his gold\nbuttons, which were claimed by the fellow who had saved his life, he\nscrambled from the side of the boat upon the rock, and got along a\nnarrow ledge, where none of them could follow him. They tried to coax\nhim back; but he stamped his feet, and swore at them, being sadly taught\nbad language by the native servants, I dare say. Rickon Goold wanted to\nshoot him, for they had got a gun with them, and he feared to leave him\nthere. But Sir Duncan's former boatman would not allow it; and at dark\nthey went away and left him there. And the poor little fellow, in\nhis dark despair, must have been led by the hand of the Lord through\ncrannies too narrow for a man to pass. There is a well-known land\npassage out of that cave; but he must have crawled out by a smaller one,\nunknown even to our fishermen, slanting up the hill, and having outlet\nin the thicket near the place where the boats draw up. And so he was\nfound by Robin Cockscroft in the morning. They had fed the child with\nbiscuit soaked in rum, which accounts for his heavy sleep and wonderful\nexertions, and may have predisposed him for a contraband career.\"\n\n\"And perhaps for the very bad language which he used,\" said Mrs.\nUpround, thoughtfully. \"It is an extraordinary tale, my dear. But I\nsuppose there can be no doubt of it. But such a clever child should have\nknown his own name. Why did he call himself 'Izunsabe'?\"\n\n\"That is another link in the certainty of proof. On board that\nunfortunate ship, and perhaps even before he left India, he was always\ncalled the 'Young Sahib,' and he used, having proud little ways of his\nown, to shout, if anybody durst provoke him, 'I'se young Sahib, I'se\nyoung Sahib;' which we rendered into 'Izunsabe.' But his true name is\nWilton Bart Yordas, I believe, and the initials can be made out upon his\ngold beads, Mr. Mordacks tells me, among heathen texts.\"\n\n\"That seems rather shocking to good principles, my dear. I trust that\nSir Duncan is a Christian at least; or he shall never set foot in this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"My dear, I can not tell. How should I know? He may have lapsed, of\ncourse, as a good many of them do, from the heat of the climate, and bad\nsurroundings. But that happens mostly from their marrying native women.\nAnd this gentleman never has done that, I do believe.\"\n\n\"They tell me that he is a very handsome man, and of most commanding\naspect--the very thing Janetta likes so much. But what became of those\nunhappy sadly tipsy sailors?\"\n\n\"Well, they managed very cleverly, and made success of tipsiness. As\nsoon as it was dark that night, and before the child had crawled away,\nthey pushed out of the cave, and let the flood-tide take them round\nthe Head. They meant to have landed at Bridlington Quay, with a tale of\nescape from a Frenchman; but they found no necessity for going so far. A\nshort-handed collier was lying in the roads; and the skipper, perceiving\nthat they were in liquor, thought it a fine chance, and took some\ntrouble to secure them. They told him that they had been trying to run\ngoods, and were chased by a revenue boat, and so on. He was only too\nglad to be enabled to make sail, and by dawn they were under way for the\nThames; and that was the end of the Golconda.\"\n\n\"What an awful crime! But you never mean to tell me that the Lord let\nthose men live and prosper?\"\n\n\"That subject is beyond our view, my dear. There were five of them, and\nRickon Goold believed himself the last of them. But being very penitent,\nhe might have exaggerated. He said that one was swallowed by a shark, at\nleast his head was, and one was hanged for stealing sheep, and one for\na bad sixpence; but the fate of the other (too terrible to tell you)\nbrought this man down here, to be looking at the place, and to divide\nhis time between fasting, and drinking, and poaching, and discoursing to\nthe thoughtless. The women flocked to hear him preach, when the passion\nwas upon him; and he used to hint at awful sins of his own, which\nmade him earnest. I hope that he was so, and I do believe it. But\nthe wooden-legged sailors, old Joe and his son, who seem to have\nbeen employed by Mordacks, took him at his own word for a 'miserable\nsinner'--which, as they told their master, no respectable man would call\nhimself--and in the most business-like manner they set to to remove him\nto a better world; and now they have succeeded.\"\n\n\"Poor man! After all, one must be rather sorry for him. If old Joe came\nstumping after me for half an hour, I should have no interest in this\nlife left.\"\n\n\"My dear, they stumped after him the whole day long, and at night they\ndanced a hornpipe outside his hut. He became convinced that the Prince\nof Evil was come, in that naval style, to fetch him; and he drank\neverything he could lay hands on, to fortify him for the contest. The\nend, as you know, was extremely sad for him, but highly satisfactory\nto them, I fear. They have signified their resolution to attend his\nfuneral; and Mordacks has said, with unbecoming levity, that if\nthey never were drunk before--which seems to me an almost romantic\nsupposition--that night they shall be drunk, and no mistake.\"\n\n\"All these things, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Upround, who was gifted with\na fine vein of moral reflection, \"are not as we might wish if we ordered\nthem ourselves. But still there is this to be said in their favor, that\nthey have a large tendency toward righteousness.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nA TANGLE OF VEINS\n\n\nHuman resolution, energy, experience, and reason in its loftiest form\nmay fight against the doctor; but he beats them all, maintains at least\nhis own vitality, and asserts his guineas. Two more resolute men than\nMr. Mordacks and Sir Duncan Yordas could scarcely be found in those\nresolute times. They sternly resolved to have no sort of doctor; and yet\nwithin three days they did have one; and, more than that, the very one\nthey had positively vowed to abstain from.\n\nDr. Stirbacks let everybody know that he never cared two flips of his\nthumb for anybody. If anybody wanted him, they must come and seek him,\nand be thankful if he could find time to hear their nonsense. For he\nunderstood not the system only, but also the nature of mankind. The\npeople at the Thornwick did not want him. Very good, so much the better\nfor him and for them; because the more they wanted him, the less\nwould he go near them. Tut! tut! tut! he said; what did he want with\ncrack-brained patients?\n\nAll this compelled him, with a very strong reluctance, to be dragged\ninto that very place the very same day; and he saw that he was not come\nan hour too soon. Sir Duncan was lying in a bitterly cold room, with the\nfire gone out, and the spark of his life not very far from following it.\nMr. Mordacks was gone for the day upon business, after leaving strict\norders that a good fire must be kept, and many other things attended to.\nBut the chimney took to smoking, and the patient to coughing, and the\nlandlady opened the window wide, and the fire took flight into the upper\nair. Sir Duncan hated nothing more than any fuss about himself. He\nhad sent a man to Scarborough for a little chest of clothes, for his\nsaddle-kit was exhausted; and having promised Mordacks that he would not\nquit the house, he had nothing to do except to meditate and shiver.\n\nGil Beilby's wife Nell, coming up to take orders for dinner, \"got a\ndreadful turn\" from what she saw, and ran down exclaiming that the very\nbest customer that ever drew their latch was dead. Without waiting to\nthink, the landlord sent a most urgent message for Dr. Stirbacks.\nThat learned man happened to be round the corner, although he lived at\nBempton; he met the messenger, cast to the winds all sense of wrong, and\nrushed to the succor of humanity.\n\nThat night, when the general factor returned, with the hunger excited\nby feeding the hungry, he was met at the door by Dr. Stirbacks, saying,\n\"Hush, my good sir,\" before he had time to think of speaking. \"You!\"\ncried Mr. Mordacks, having met this gentleman when Rickon Goold was near\nhis last. \"You! Then it must be bad indeed!\"\n\n\"It is bad, and it must have been all over, sir, but for my being\nprovidentially at the cheese shop. I say nothing to wound any\ngentleman's feelings who thinks that he understands everything; but our\npoor patient, with the very best meaning, no doubt, has been all but\nmurdered.\"\n\n\"Dr. Stirbacks, you have got him now, and of course you will make the\nbest of him. Don't let him slip through your fingers, doctor; he is much\ntoo good for that.\"\n\n\"He shall not slip through my fingers,\" said the little doctor, with\na twinkle of self-preservation. \"I have got him, sir, and I shall keep\nhim, sir; and you ought to have put him in my hands long ago.\"\n\nThe sequel of this needs no detail. Dr. Stirbacks came three times a\nday; and without any disrespect to the profession, it must be admitted\nthat he earned his fees. For Sir Duncan's case was a very strange one,\nand beyond the best wisdom of the laity. If that chill had struck upon\nhim when his spirit was as usual, he might have cast it off, and gone\non upon his business. But coming as it did, when the temperature of his\nheart was lowered by nip of disappointment, it went into him, as water\non a duck's back is not cast away when his rump gland is out of order.\n\n\"A warm room, good victuals, and cheerful society--these three are\nindispensable,\" said Dr. Stirbacks to Mr. Mordacks, over whom he began\nto try to tyrannize; \"and admirable as you are, my good sir, I fear\nthat your society is depressing. You are always in a fume to be doing\nsomething--a stew, I might say, without exaggeration--a wonderful\npattern of an active mind. But in a case of illness we require the\npassive voice. Everything suggestive of rapid motion must be removed,\nand never spoken of. You are rapid motion itself, my dear sir. We get a\nrelapse every time you come in.\"\n\n\"You want me out of the way. Very well. Let me know when you have killed\nmy friend. I suppose your office ends with that. I will come down and\nsee to his funeral.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mordacks, you may be premature in such prevision. Your own may come\nfirst, sir. Look well at your eyes the next time you shave, and I fear\nyou will descry those radiant fibres in the iris which always co-exist\nwith heart-disease. I can tell you fifty cases, if you have time to\nlisten.\"\n\n\"D--n your prognostics, sir!\" exclaimed the factor, rudely; but\nhe seldom lathered himself thenceforth without a little sigh of\nself-regard. \"Now, Dr. Stirbacks,\" he continued, with a rally, \"you\nmay find my society depressing, but it is generally considered to be\nelevating; and that, sir, by judges of the highest order, and men of\nindependent income. The head of your profession in the northern half of\nEngland, who takes a hundred guineas for every one you take, rejoices,\nsir--rejoices is not too strong a word to use--in my very humble\nsociety. Of course he may be wrong; but when he hears that Mr.\nStirbacks, of Little Under-Bempton--is that the right address,\nsir?--speaks of my society as depressing--\"\n\n\"Mr. Mordacks, you misunderstood my meaning. I spoke with no reference\nto you whatever, but of all male society as enervating--if you dislike\nthe word 'depressing'--relaxing, emollient, emasculating, from want of\ncontradictory element; while I was proceeding to describe the need of\nstrictly female society. The rector offers this; he was here just\nnow. His admiration for you is unbounded. He desires to receive our\ndistinguished patient, with the vast advantage of ladies' society,\ndouble-thick walls, and a southern aspect, if you should consider it\nadvisable.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly I do. If the moving can be done without danger; and of that\nyou are the proper judge, of course.\"\n\nThus they composed their little disagreement, with mutual respect, and\nsome approaches to good-will; and Sir Duncan Yordas, being skillfully\nremoved, spent his Christmas (without knowing much about it) in the best\nand warmest bedroom in the rectory. But Mordacks returned, as an\nhonest man should do, to put the laurel and the mistletoe on his proper\nhousehold gods. And where can this be better done than in that grand\nold city, York? But before leaving Flamborough, he settled the claims\nof business and charity, so far as he could see them, and so far as the\nstate of things permitted.\n\nFoiled as he was in his main object by the murder of the revenue\nofficer, and the consequent flight of Robin Lyth, he had thoroughly\naccomplished one part of his task, the discovery of the Golconda's fate,\nand the history of Sir Duncan's child. Moreover, his trusty agents, Joe\nof the Monument, and Bob his son, had relieved him of one thorny care,\nby the zeal and skill with which they worked. It was to them a sweet\ninstruction to watch, encounter, and drink down a rogue who had scuttled\na ship, and even defeated them at their own weapons, and made a text of\nthem to teach mankind. Dr. Upround had not exaggerated the ardor with\nwhich they discharged their duty.\n\nBut Mordacks still had one rogue on hand, and a deeper one than Rickon\nGoold. In the course of his visits to Bridlington Quay, he had managed\nto meet John Cadman, preferring, as he always did, his own impressions\nto almost any other evidence. And his own impressions had entirely borne\nout the conviction of Widow Carroway. But he saw at once that this man\ncould not be plied with coarse weapons, like the other worn-out villain.\nHe reserved him as a choice bit for his own skill, and was careful not\nto alarm him yet. Only two things concerned him, as immediate in the\nmatter--to provide against Cadman's departure from the scene, and to\nlearn all the widow had to tell about him.\n\nThe widow had a great deal to say about that man; but had not said it\nyet, from want of power so to do. Mordacks himself had often stopped\nher, when she could scarcely stop herself; for until her health should\nbe set up again, any stir of the mind would be dangerous. But now, with\nthe many things provided for her, good nursing, and company, and the\nkindness of the neighbors (who jealously rushed in as soon as a stranger\nled the way), and the sickening of Tommy with the measles--which he had\ncaught in the coal-cellar--she began to be started in a different plane\nof life; to contemplate the past as a golden age (enshrining a diamond\nstatue of a revenue officer in full uniform), and to look upon the\npresent as a period of steel, when a keen edge must be kept against the\nworld, for a defense of all the little seed of diamonds.\n\nNow the weather was milder, as it generally is at Christmas time, and\nthe snow all gone, and the wind blowing off the land again, to the great\nsatisfaction of both cod and conger. The cottage, which had looked such\na den of cold and famine, with the blinds drawn down, and the snow piled\nup against the door, and not a single child-nose against the glass, was\nnow quite warm again, and almost as lively as if Lieutenant Carroway\nwere coming home to dinner. The heart of Mr. Mordacks glowed with\npride as he said to himself that he had done all this; and the glow was\nreflected on the cheeks of Geraldine, as she ran out to kiss him, and\nthen jumped upon his shoulder. For, in spite of his rigid aspect and\nstern nose, the little lass had taken kindly to him; while he admired\nher for eating candles.\n\n\"If you please, you can come in here,\" said Jerry. \"Oh, don't knock my\nhead against the door.\"\n\nMrs. Carroway knew what he was come for; and although she had tried\nto prepare herself for it, she could not help trembling a little. The\nfactor had begged her to have some friend present, to encourage and help\nher in so grievous an affair; but she would not hear of it, and said she\nhad no friend.\n\nMr. Mordacks sat down, as he was told to do, in the little room sacred\nto the poor lieutenant, and faithful even yet to the pious memory of his\npipe. When the children were shut out, he began to look around, that the\nlady might have time to cry. But she only found occasion for a little\ndry sob.\n\n\"It is horrible, very, very horrible,\" she murmured, with a shudder, as\nher eyes were following his; \"but for his sake I endure it.\"\n\n\"A most sad and bitter trial, ma'am, as ever I have heard of. But you\nare bound to bear in mind that he is looking down on you.\"\n\n\"I could not put up with it, without the sense of that, sir. But I say\nto myself how much he loved it; and that makes me put up with it.\"\n\n\"I am quite at a loss to understand you, madam. We seem to be at\ncross-purposes. I was speaking of--of a thing it pains me to mention;\nand you say how much he loved--\"\n\n\"Dirt, sir, dirt. It was his only weakness. Oh, my darling Charles, my\nblessed, blessed Charley! Sometimes I used to drive him almost to his\nend about it; but I never thought his end would come; I assure you I\nnever did, sir. But now I shall leave everything as he would like to see\nit--every table and every chair, that he could write his name on it. And\nhis favorite pipe with the bottom in it. That is what he must love to\nsee, if the Lord allows him to look down. Only the children mustn't see\nit, for the sake of bad example.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Carroway, I agree with you most strictly. Children must be taught\nclean ways, even while they revere their father. You should see my\ndaughter Arabella, ma'am. She regards me with perfect devotion. Why?\nBecause I never let her do the things that I myself do. It is the only\ntrue principle of government for a nation, a parish, a household. How\nbeautifully you have trained pretty Geraldine! I fear that you scarcely\ncould spare her for a month, in the spring, and perhaps Tommy after his\nmeasles; but a visit to York would do them good, and establish their\nexpanding minds, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mordacks, I know not where we may be then. But anything that you\ndesire is a law to us.\"\n\n\"Well said! Beautifully said! But I trust, my dear madam, that you will\nbe here. Indeed, it would never do for you to go away. Or rather, I\nshould put it thus--for the purposes of justice, and for other reasons\nalso, it is most important that you should not leave this place. At\nleast you will promise me that, I hope? Unless, of course, unless you\nfind the memories too painful. And even so, you might find comfort in\nsome inland house, not far.\"\n\n\"Many people might not like to stop,\" the widow answered, simply; \"but\nto me it would be a worse pain to go away. I sit, in the evening, by\nthe window here. Whenever there is light enough to show the sea, and\nthe beach is fit for landing on, it seems to my eyes that I can see\nthe boat, with my husband standing up in it. He had a majestic way of\nstanding, with one leg more up than the other, sir, through one of his\ndaring exploits; and whenever I see him, he is just like that; and the\nlittle children in the kitchen peep and say, 'Here's daddy coming at\nlast; we can tell by mammy's eyes;' and the bigger ones say, 'Hush! You\nmight know better.' And I look again, wondering which of them is right;\nand then there is nothing but the clouds and sea. Still, when it is\nover, and I have cried about it, it does me a little good every time. I\nseem to be nearer to Charley, as my heart falls quietly into the will of\nthe Lord.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it whatever. I can thoroughly understand it, although there\nis not a bit of resignation in me. I felt that sort of thing, to some\nextent, when I lost my angelic wife, ma'am, though naturally departed\nto a sphere more suited for her. And I often seem to think that still\nI hear her voice when a coal comes to table in a well-dish. Life, Mrs.\nCarroway, is no joke to bandy back, but trouble to be shared. And none\nshare it fairly but the husband and the wife, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You make it very hard for me to get my words,\" she said, without\nminding that her tears ran down, so long as she spoke clearly. \"I am not\nof the lofty sort, and understand no laws of things; though my husband\nwas remarkable for doing so. He took all the trouble of the taxes off,\nthough my part was to pay for them. And in every other way he was a\nwonder, sir; not at all because now he is gone above. That would be my\nlast motive.\"\n\n\"He was a wonder, a genuine wonder,\" Mordacks replied, without irony.\n\"He did his duty, ma'am, with zeal and ardor; a shining example upon\nvery little pay. I fear that it was his integrity and zeal, truly\nBritish character and striking sense of discipline, that have so sadly\nbrought him to--to the condition of an example.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Mordacks, it was all that. He never could put up with a lazy\nman, as anybody, to live, must have to do. He kept all his men, as I\nused to do our children, to word of command, and no answer. Honest men\nlike it; but wicked men fly out. And all along we had a very wicked man\nhere.\"\n\n\"So I have heard from other good authority--a deceiver of women, a\nskulk, a dog. I have met with many villains; and I am not hot. But\nmy tendency is to take that fellow by the throat with both hands, and\nthrottle him. Having thoroughly accomplished that, I should prepare to\nsift the evidence. Unscientific, illogical, brutal, are such desires,\nas you need not tell me. And yet, madam, they are manly. I hate slow\njustice; I like it quick--quick, or none at all, I say, so long as it\nis justice. Creeping justice is, to my mind, little better than slow\nrevenge. My opinions are not orthodox, but I hope they do not frighten\nyou.\"\n\n\"They do indeed, sir; or at least your face does; though I know how\nquick and just you are. He is a bad man--too well I know it--but, as my\ndear husband used to say, he has a large lot of children.\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Carroway, I admire you the more, for considering what he has\nnot considered. Let us put aside that. The question is--guilty or not\nguilty? If he is guilty, shall he get off, and innocent men be hanged\nfor him? Six men are in jail at this present moment for the deed which\nwe believe he did. Have they no wives, no fathers and mothers, no\nchildren--not to speak of their own lives? The case is one in which the\nConstitution of the realm must be asserted. Six innocent men must die\nunless the crime is brought home to the guilty one. Even that is not\nall as regards yourself. You may not care for your own life, but you\nare bound to treasure it seven times over for the sake of your seven\nchildren. While John Cadman is at large, and nobody hanged instead of\nhim, your life is in peril, ma'am. He knows that you know him, and have\ndenounced him. He has tried to scare you into silence; and the fright\ncaused your sad illness. I have reason to believe that he, by scattering\ncrafty rumors, concealed from the neighbors your sad plight, and that\nof your dear children. If so, he is worse than the devil himself. Do you\nsee your duty now, and your interest also?\"\n\nMrs. Carroway nodded gently. Her strength of mind was not come back yet,\nafter so much illness. The baby lay now on its father's breast, and the\nmother's had been wild for it.\n\n\"I am sorry to have used harsh words,\" resumed Mordacks; \"but I always\nhave to do so. They seem to put things clearer; and without that, where\nwould business be? Now I will not tire you if I can help it, nor ask a\nneedless question. What provocation had this man? What fanciful cause\nfor spite, I mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, none, Mr. Mordacks, none whatever. My husband rebuked him for\nbeing worthless, and a liar, and a traitor; and he threatened to get\nhim removed from the force; and he gave him a little throw down from the\ncliff--but what little was done was done entirely for his good.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see. And, after that, was Cadman ever heard to threaten him?\"\n\n\"Many times, in a most malicious way, when he thought that he was not\nheeded. The other men may fear to bear witness. But my Geraldine has\nheard him.\"\n\n\"There could be no better witness. A child, especially a pretty little\ngirl, tells wonderfully with a jury. But we must have a great deal more\nthan that. Thousands of men threaten, and do nothing, according to the\nproverb. A still more important point is--how did the muskets in the\nboat come home? They were all returned to the station, I presume. Were\nthey all returned with their charges in them?\"\n\n\"I am sure I can not say how that was. There was nobody to attend to\nthat. But one of them had been lost altogether.\"\n\n\"One of the guns never came back at all!\" Mordacks almost shouted.\n\"Whose gun was it that did not come back?\"\n\n\"How can we say? There was such confusion. My husband would never let\nthem nick the guns, as they do at some of the stations, for every man\nto know his own. But in spite of that, each man had his own, I believe.\nCadman declares that he brought home his; and nobody contradicted him.\nBut if I saw the guns, I should know whether Cadman's is among them.\"\n\n\"How can you possibly pretend to know that, ma'am? English ladies can do\nalmost anything. But surely you never served out the guns?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Mordacks. But I have cleaned them. Not the inside, of course;\nthat I know nothing of; and nobody sees that, to be offended. But\nseveral times I have observed, at the station, a disgraceful quantity\nof dust upon the guns--dust and rust and miserable blotches, such as bad\ngirls leave in the top of a fish-kettle; and I made Charley bring them\ndown, and be sure to have them empty; because they were so unlike what\nI have seen on board of the ship where he won his glory, and took the\nbullet in his nineteenth rib.\"\n\n\"My dear madam, what a frame he must have had! But this is most\ninstructive. No wonder Geraldine is brave. What a worthy wife for a\nnaval hero! A lady who could handle guns!\"\n\n\"I knew, sir, quite from early years, having lived near a very large\narsenal, that nothing can make a gun go off unless there is something\nin it. And I could trust my husband to see to that; and before I touched\none of them I made him put a brimstone match to the touch-hole. And\nI found it so pleasant to polish them, from having such wicked things\nquite at my mercy. The wood was what I noticed most, because of\nunderstanding chairs. One of them had a very curious tangle of veins\non the left cheek behind the trigger; and I just had been doing for the\nchildren's tea what they call 'crinkly-crankly'--treacle trickled (like\na maze) upon the bread; and Tommy said, 'Look here! it is the very same\nupon this gun.' And so it was; just the same pattern on the wood! And\nwhile I was doing it Cadman came up, in his low surly way, and said, 'I\nwant my gun, missus; I never shoot with no other gun than that. Captain\nsays I may shoot a sea-pye, for the little ones.' And so I always called\nit 'Cadman's gun.' I have not been able to think much yet. But if that\ngun is lost, I shall know who it was that lost a gun that dreadful\nnight.\"\n\n\"All this is most strictly to the purpose,\" answered Mordacks, \"and\nmay prove most important. We could never hope to get those six men off,\nwithout throwing most grave suspicion elsewhere; and unless we can get\nthose six men off, their captain will come and surrender himself, and be\nhanged, to a dead certainty. I doubted his carrying the sense of right\nso far, until I reflected upon his birth, dear madam. He belongs, as I\nmay tell you now, to a very ancient family, a race that would run their\nheads into a noose out of pure obstinacy, rather than skulk off. I am\nof very ancient race myself, though I never take pride in the matter,\nbecause I have seen more harm than good of it. I always learned Latin\nat school so quickly through being a grammatical example of descent.\nAccording to our pedigree, Caius Calpurnius Mordax Naso was the Governor\nof Britain under Pertinax. My name means 'biting'; and bite I can,\nwhether my dinner is before me, or my enemy. In the present case I shall\nnot bite yet, but prepare myself for doing so. I watch the proceedings\nof the government, who are sure to be slow, as well as blundering.\nThere has been no appointment to this command as yet, because of so\nmany people wanting it. This patched-up peace, which may last about six\nmonths (even if it is ever signed), is producing confusion everywhere.\nYou have an old fool put in charge of this station till a proper\nsuccessor is appointed.\"\n\n\"He is not like Captain Carroway, sir. But that concerns me little now.\nBut I do wish, for my children's sake, that they would send a little\nmoney.\"\n\n\"On no account think twice of that. That question is in my hands, and\naffords me one of the few pleasures I derive from business. You are\nunder no sort of obligation about it. I am acting under authority. A man\nof exalted position and high office--but never mind that till the proper\ntime comes; only keep your mind in perfect rest, and attend to your\nchildren and yourself. I am obliged to proceed very warily, but you\nshall not be annoyed by that scoundrel. I will provide for that before I\nleave; also I will see the guns still in store, without letting anybody\nguess my motive. I have picked up a very sharp fellow here, whose heart\nis in the business thoroughly; for one of the prisoners is his twin\nbrother, and he lost his poor sweetheart through Cadman's villainy--a\nyoung lass who used to pick mussels, or something. He will see that the\nrogue does not give us the slip, and I have looked out for that in other\nways as well. I am greatly afraid of tiring you, my dear madam; but have\nyou any other thing to tell me of this Cadman?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Mordacks, except a whole quantity of little things that tell a\ngreat deal to me, but to anybody else would have no sense. For instance,\nof his looks, and turns, and habits, and tricks of seeming neither the\none thing nor the other, and jumping all the morning, when the last man\nwas hanged--\"\n\n\"Did he do that, madam? Are you quite sure?\"\n\n\"I had it on the authority of his own wife. He beats her, but still she\ncan not understand him. You may remember that the man to be suspended\nwas brought to the place where--where--\"\n\n\"Where he earned his doom. It is quite right. Things of that sort should\nbe done upon a far more liberal scale. Example is better than a thousand\nprecepts. Let us be thankful that we live in such a country. I have\nbrought some medicine for brave Tommy from our Dr. Stirbacks. Be sure\nthat you stroke his throat when he takes it. Boys are such rogues--\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Mordacks, I really hope that I know how to make my little boy\ntake medicine!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nSHORT SIGHS, AND LONG ONES\n\n\nNow it came to pass that for several months this neighborhood, which\nhad begun to regard Mr. Mordacks as its tutelary genius--so great is the\npower of bold energy--lost him altogether; and with brief lamentation\nbegan to do very well without him. So fugitive is vivacious stir, and\nso well content is the general world to jog along in its old ruts. The\nFlamborough butcher once more subsided into a piscitarian; the postman,\nwho had been driven off his legs, had time to nurse his grain again;\nWidow Tapsy relapsed into the very worst of taps, having none to\ndemand good beverage; and a new rat, sevenfold worse than the mighty\nnet-devourer (whom Mordacks slew; but the chronicle has been cut out,\nfor the sake of brevity), took possession of his galleries, and made\nthem pay. All Flamborough yearned for the \"gentleman as did things,\"\nitself being rather of the contemplative vein, which flows from\nimmemorial converse with the sea. But the man of dry hand-and-heel\nactivity came not, and the lanes forgot the echo of his Roman march.\n\nThe postman (with a wicked endeavor of hope to beget faith from sweet\nlaziness) propagated a loose report that Death had claimed the general\nfactor, through fear of any rival in activity. The postman did not put\nit so, because his education was too good for long words to enter\ninto it; but he put his meaning in a shorter form than a smattering of\ndistant tongues leaves to us. The butcher (having doubt of death, unless\nby man administered) kicked the postman out of his expiring shop, where\nlarge hooks now had no sheep for bait; and Widow Tapsy, filled with\nsofter liquid form of memory, was so upset by the letter-man's tale that\nshe let off a man who owed four gallons, for beating him as flat as his\nown bag. To tell of these things may take time, but time is thoroughly\nwell spent if it contributes a trifle toward some tendency, on anybody's\npart, to hope that there used to be, even in this century, such a thing\nas gratitude.\n\nBut why did Mr. Mordacks thus desert his favorite quest and quarters,\nand the folk in whom he took most delight--because so long inaccessible?\nThe reason was as sound as need be: important business of his own had\ncalled him away into Derbyshire. Like every true son of stone and crag,\nhe required an annual scratch against them, and hoped to rest among them\nwhen the itch of life was over. But now he had hopes of even more than\nthat--of owning a good house and fair estate, and henceforth exerting\nhis remarkable powers of agency on his own behalf. For his cousin,\nCalpurnius Mordacks, the head of the family, was badly ailing, and\nhaving lost his only son in the West Indies, had sent for this kinsman\nto settle matters with him. His offer was generous and noble; to wit,\nthat Geoffrey should take, not the property alone, but also his second\ncousin, fair Calpurnia, though not without her full consent. Without\nthe lady, he was not to have the land, and the lady's consent must be\nsecured before her father ceased to be a sound testator.\n\nNow if Calpurnia had been kept in ignorance of this arrangement, a man\npossessing the figure, decision, stature, self-confidence, and other\nhigh attributes of our Mordacks, must have triumphed in a week at\nlatest. But with that candor which appears to have been so strictly\nentailed in the family, Colonel Calpurnius called them in; and there (in\nthe presence of the testator and of each other) they were fully apprised\nof this rather urgent call upon their best and most delicate emotions.\nAnd the worst of it was (from the gentleman's point of view), that\nthe contest was unequal. The golden apples were not his to cast, but\nAtalanta's. The lady was to have the land, even without accepting love.\nMoreover, he was fifty per cent beyond her in age, and Hymen would make\nher a mamma without invocation of Lucina. But highest and deepest woe of\nall, most mountainous of obstacles, was the lofty skyline of his nose,\ninherited from the Roman. If the lady's corresponding feature had not\ncorresponded--in other words, if her nose had been chubby, snub, or even\nGreek--his bold bridge must have served him well, and even shortened\naccess to rosy lips and tender heart. But, alas! the fair one's nose was\nalso of the fine imperial type, truly admirable in itself, but (under\none of nature's strictest laws) coy of contact with its own male\nexpression. Love, whose joy and fierce prank is to buckle to the plated\npole ill-matched forms and incongruous spirits, did not fail of her\nimpartial freaks. Mr. Mordacks had to cope with his own kin, and found\nthe conflict so severe that not a breath of time was left him for\nanybody's business but his own.\n\nIf luck was against him in that quarter (although he would not own it\nyet), at York and Flamborough it was not so. No crisis arose to demand\nhis presence; no business went amiss because of his having to work so\nhard at love. There came, as there sometimes does in matters pressing,\ntangled, and exasperating, a quiet period, a gentle lull, a halcyon\ntime when the jaded brain reposes, and the heart may hatch her own\nmares'-nests. Underneath that tranquil spell lay fond Joe and Bob (with\ntheir cash to spend), Widow Precious (with her beer laid in), and\nWidow Carroway, with a dole at last extorted from the government; while\nAnerley Farm was content to hearken the creak of wagon and the ring of\nflail, and the rector of Flamborough once more rejoiced in the bloodless\nwar that breeds good-will.\n\nFor Sir Duncan Yordas was a fine chess-player, as many Indian officers\nof that time were; and now that he was coming to his proper temperature\n(after three months of barbed stab of cold, and the breach of the seal\nof the seventy-seventh phial of Dr. Stirbacks), in gratitude for that\nmiraculous escape, he did his very best to please everybody. To Dr.\nUpround he was an agreeable and penetrative companion; to Mrs. Upround,\na gallant guest, with a story for every slice of bread and butter; to\nJanetta, a deity combining the perfections of Jupiter, Phoebus, Mars,\nand Neptune (because of his yacht), without any of their drawbacks;\nand to Flamborough, more largely speaking, a downright good sort of\ngentleman, combining a smoke with a chaw--so they understood cigars--and\nnot above standing still sometimes for a man to say some sense to him.\n\nBut before Mr. Mordacks left his client under Dr. Upround's care, he had\ndone his best to provide that mischief should not come of gossip; and\nthe only way to prevent that issue is to preclude the gossip. Sir Duncan\nYordas, having lived so long in a large commanding way, among people\nwho might say what they pleased of him, desired no concealment here,\nand accepted it unwillingly. But his agent was better skilled in English\nlife, and rightly foresaw a mighty buzz of nuisance--without any honey\nto be brought home--from the knowledge of the public that the Indian\nhero had begotten the better-known apostle of free trade. Yet it\nmight have been hard to persuade Sir Duncan to keep that great fact to\nhimself, if his son had been only a smuggler, or only a fugitive from a\nfalse charge of murder. But that which struck him in the face, as soon\nas he was able to consider things, was the fact that his son had fled\nand vanished, leaving his underlings to meet their fate. \"The smuggling\nis a trifle,\" exclaimed the sick man; \"our family never was law-abiding,\nand used to be large cattle-lifters; even the slaying of a man in hot\ncombat is no more than I myself have done, and never felt the worse for\nit. But to run away, and leave men to be hanged, after bringing them\ninto the scrape himself, is not the right sort of dishonor for a Yordas.\nIf the boy surrenders, I shall be proud to own him. But until he does\nthat, I agree with you, Mordacks, that he does not deserve to know who\nhe is.\"\n\nThis view of the case was harsh, perhaps, and showed some ignorance of\nfree-trade questions, and of English justice. If Robin Lyth had been\ndriven, by the heroic view of circumstances, to rush into embrace\nconstabular, would that have restored the other six men to family\nsinuosities? Not a chance of it. Rather would it treble the pangs of\njail--where they enjoyed themselves--to feel that anxiety about their\npledges to fortune from which the free Robin relieved them. Money was\nlodged and paid as punctual as the bank for the benefit of all their\nbelongings. There were times when the sailors grumbled a little because\nthey had no ropes to climb; but of any unfriendly rope impending they\nwere too wise to have much fear. They knew that they had not done the\ndeed, and they felt assured that twelve good men would never turn round\nin their box to believe it.\n\nTheir captain took the same view of the case. He had very little doubt\nof their acquittal if they were defended properly; and of that a far\nwealthier man than himself, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of free\ntrade, Master Rideout of Malton, would take good care, if the money left\nwith Dr. Upround failed. The surrender of Robin would simply hurt them,\nunless they were convicted, and in that case he would yield himself. Sir\nDuncan did not understand these points, and condemned his son unjustly.\nAnd Mordacks was no longer there to explain such questions in his sharp\nclear way.\n\nBeing in this sadly disappointed state, and not thoroughly delivered\nfrom that renal chill (which the northeast wind, coming over the leather\nof his valise, had inflicted), this gentleman, like a long-pendulous\ngrape with the ventilators open, was exposed to the delicate insidious\nbilling of little birds that love something good. It might be\nwrong--indeed, it must be wrong, and a foul slur upon fair sweet\nlove--to insinuate that Indian gold, or rank, or renown, or vague\nromance, contributed toward what came to pass. Miss Janetta Upround, up\nto this time of her life, had laughed at all the wanton tricks of Cupid;\nand whenever the married women told her that her time would be safe to\ncome, and then she might understand their behavior, they had always been\nordered to go home and do their washing. And this made it harder for her\nto be mangled by the very tribulation she had laughed at.\n\nShort little sighs were her first symptom, and a quiet way of going up\nthe stairs--which used to be a noisy process with her--and then a desire\nto know something of history, and a sudden turn of mind toward soup. Sir\nDuncan had a basin every day at twelve o'clock, and Janetta had orders\nto see him do it, by strict institution of Stirbacks. Those orders she\ncarried out with such zeal that she even went so far as to blow upon the\nspoon; and she did look nice while doing it. In a word--as there is no\ntime for many--being stricken, she did her best to strike, as the manner\nof sweet women is.\n\nSir Duncan Yordas received it well. Being far on toward her futurity in\nyears, and beyond her whole existence in experience and size, he smiled\nat her ardor and short vehemence to please him, and liked to see her\ngo about, because she turned so lightly. Then the pleasant agility of\nthought began to make him turn to answer it; and whenever she had the\nbest of him in words, her bright eyes fell, as if she had the worst.\n\"She doesn't even know that she is clever,\" said the patient to himself,\n\"and she is the first person I have met with yet who knows which side of\nthe line Calcutta is.\"\n\nThe manner of those benighted times was to keep from young ladies\nimportant secrets which seemed to be no concern of theirs. Miss Upround\nhad never been told what brought this visitor to Flamborough, and\nalthough she had plenty of proper curiosity, she never got any reward\nfor it. Only four Flamburians knew that Sir Duncan was Robin Lyth's\npapa--or, as they would put it (having faster hold of the end of the\nstick next to them), that Robin Lyth was the son of Sir Duncan. And\nthose four were, by force of circumstance, Robin Cockscroft and Joan\nhis wife, the rector and the rectoress. Even Dr. Stirbacks (organically\ninquisitive as he was, and ill content to sniff at any bottle with the\ncork tied down), by mastery of Mordacks and calm dignity of rector, was\nable to suspect a lot of things, but to be sure of none of them; and\nsuspicion, according to its usual manner, never came near the truth\nat all. Miss Upround, therefore, had no idea that if she became Lady\nYordas, which she very sincerely longed to be, she would, by that event,\nbe made the step-mother of a widely celebrated smuggler; while her\nIndian hero, having no idea of her flattering regard as yet, was not\nbound to enlighten her upon that point.\n\nAt Anerley Farm the like ignorance prevailed; except that Mistress\nAnerley, having a quick turn for romance, and liking to get her\npredictions confirmed, recalled to her mind (and recited to her husband\nin far stronger language) what she had said, in the clover-blossom\ntime, to the bravest man that ever lived, the lamented Captain\nCarroway. Captain Carroway's dauntless end, so thoroughly befitting his\nextraordinary exploits, for which she even had his own authority, made\nit the clearest thing in all the world that every word she said to\nhim must turn out Bible-true. And she had begged him--and one might\nbe certain that he had told it, as a good man must, to his poor dear\nwidow--not to shoot at Robin Lyth; because he would get a thousand\npounds, instead of a hundred for doing it. She never could have dreamed\nto find her words come true so suddenly; but here was an Indian Prince\ncome home, who employed the most pleasant-spoken gentleman; and he might\nknow who it was he had to thank that even in the cave the captain did\nnot like to shoot that long-lost heir; and from this time out there was\nno excuse for Stephen if he ever laughed at anything that his wife said.\nOnly on no account must Mary ever hear of it; for a bird in the hand\nwas worth fifty in the bush; and the other gone abroad, and under\naccusation, and very likely born of a red Indian mother. Whereas Harry\nTanfield's father, George, had been as fair as a foal, poor fellow; and\nperhaps if the church books had been as he desired, he might have kept\nout of the church-yard to this day.\n\n\"And me in it,\" the farmer answered, with a laugh--\"dead for love of my\nwife, Sophy; as wouldn't 'a been my wife, nor drawn nigh upon fi' pounds\nthis very week for feathers, fur, and ribbon stuff. Well, well, George\nwould 'a come again, to think of it. How many times have I seen him go\nwith a sixpence in the palm of 's hand, and think better of the king\nupon it, and worser of the poor chap as were worn out, like the tail of\nit! Then back go the sixpence into George's breeches; and out comes my\nshilling to the starving chap, on the sly, and never mentioned. But for\nall that, I think, like enow, old George mought 'a managed to get up to\nheaven.\"\n\n\"Stephen, I wish to hear nothing of that. The question concerns his\nfamily, not ours, as Providence has seen fit to arrange. Now what is\nyour desire to have done with Mary? William has made his great discovery\nat last; and if we should get the 10,000 pounds, nobody need look down\non us.\"\n\n\"I should like to see any one look down on me,\" Master Anerley said,\nwith his back set straight; \"a' mought do so once, but a' would be\nsorry afterward. Not that I would hinder him of 's own way; only that\nhe better keep out of mine. Sometimes, when you go thinking of your own\nideas, you never seem to bear in mind what my considerations be.\"\n\n\"Because you can not follow out the quickness of the way I think. You\nalways acknowledge that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Well, well. Quick churn spoileth butter. Like Willie with his perpetual\nmotion. What good to come of it, if he hath found out? And a' might, if\never a body did, from the way he goeth jumping about forever, and never\nhold fast to anything. A nice thing 'twould be for the fools to say,\nperpetual motion come from Anerley Farm!\"\n\n\"You never will think any good of him, Stephen, because his mind comes\nfrom my side. But wait till you see the 10,000 pounds.\"\n\n\"That I will; and thank the Lord to live so long. But, to come to\ncommon-sense--how was Mary and Harry a-carrying on this afternoon?\"\n\n\"Not so very bad, father; and nothing good to speak of. He kept on very\nwell from the corners of his eyes; but she never corresponded, so to\nspeak--same as--you know.\"\n\n\"The same as you used to do when you was young. Well, manners may be\nhigher stylish now. Did he ask her about the hay-rick?\"\n\n\"That he did. Three or four times over; exactly as you said it to him.\nHe knew that was how you got the upper hand of me, according to your\nmemory, but not mine; and he tried to do it the very same way; but the\nLord makes a lot of change in thirty years of time. Mary quite turned\nher nose up at any such riddle, and he pulled his spotted handkerchief\nout of that new hat of his, and the fagot never saw fit to heed even the\ncolor of his poor red cheeks. Stephen, you would have marched off for a\nweek if I had behaved to you so.\"\n\n\"And the right way too; I shall put him up to that. Long sighs only\nleads to turn-up noses. He plays too knuckle-down at it. You should\ngo on with your sweetheart very mild at first; just a-feeling for her\nfinger-tips; and emboldening of her to believe that you are frightened,\nand bringing her to peep at you as if you was a blackbird, ready to pop\nout of sight. That makes 'em wonderful curious and eager, and sticks you\ninto 'em, like prickly spinach. But you mustn't stop too long like that.\nYou must come out large, as a bull runs up to gate; and let them see\nthat you could smash it if you liked, but feel a goodness in your heart\nthat keeps you out of mischief. And then they comes up, and they says,\n'poor fellow!'\"\n\n\"Stephen, I do not approve of such expressions, or any such low\nopinions. You may know how you went on. Such things may have answered\nonce; because of your being--yourself, you know. But Mary, although she\nmay not have my sense, must have her own opinions. And the more you talk\nof what we used to do--though I never remember your trotting up, like\na great bull roaring, to any kind of gate--the less I feel inclined to\nforce her. And who is Harry Tanfield, after all?\"\n\n\"We know all about him,\" the farmer answered; \"and that is something to\nbegin with. His land is worth fifteen shillings an acre less than ours,\nand full of kid-bine. But, for all that, he can keep a family, and is a\ngood home-dweller. However, like the rest of us, in the way of women, he\nmust bide his bolt, and bode it.\"\n\n\"Father,\" the mistress of the house replied, \"I shall never go one step\nout of my way to encourage a young man who makes you speak so lightly of\nthose you owe so much to. Harry Tanfield may take his chance for me.\"\n\n\"So a' may for me, mother--so a' may for me. If a' was to have our Mary,\nhis father George would be coming up between us, out of his peace\nin churchyard, more than he doth a'ready; and a' comes too much\na'ready.--Why, poppet, we were talking of you--fie, fie, listening!\"\n\n\"No, now, father,\" Mary Anerley answered, with a smile at such a low\nidea; \"you never had that to find fault with me, I think. And if you are\nplotting against me for my good--as mother loves to put it--it would be\nthe best way to shut me out before you begin to do it.\"\n\n\"Why, bless my heart and soul,\" exclaimed the farmer, with a most crafty\nlaugh--for he meant to kill two birds with one stone--\"if the lass\nhathn't got her own dear mother's tongue, and the very same way of\nturning things! There never hath been such a time as this here. The\nchilder tell us what to do, and their mothers tell us what not to do.\nBetter take the business off my hands, and sell all they turnips as is\nrotting. Women is cheats, and would warrant 'em sound, with the best to\nthe top of the bury. But mind you one thing--if I retires from business,\nlike Brother Popplewell, I shall expect to be supported; cheap, but very\nsubstantial.\"\n\n\"Mary, you are wicked to say such things,\" Mistress Anerley began, as\nhe went out, \"when you know that your dear father is such a substantial\nsilent man.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nA BOLD ANGLER\n\n\nAs if in vexation at being thwarted by one branch of the family, Cupid\nbegan to work harder at the other, among the moors and mountains. Not\nthat either my lady Philippa or gentle Mistress Carnaby fell back into\nthe snares of youth, but rather that youth, contemptuous of age, leaped\nup, and defied everybody but itself, and cried tush to its own welfare.\n\nFor as soon as the trance of snow was gone, and the world, emboldened to\nbehold itself again, smiled up from genial places; and the timid step of\npeeping spring awoke a sudden flutter in the breast of buds; and streams\n(having sent their broken anger to the sea) were pleased to be murmuring\nclearly again, and enjoyed their own flexibility; and even stern\nmountains and menacing crags allowed soft light to play with them--at\nsuch a time prudence found very narrow house-room in the breast of young\nLancelot, otherwise \"Pet.\"\n\n\"If Prudence be present, no Divinity is absent,\" according to high\nauthority; but the author of the proverb must have first excluded Love\nfrom the list of Divinities. Pet's breast, or at any rate his chest, had\ngrown under the expansive enormity of love; his liver, moreover (which,\naccording to poets, both Latin and Greek, is the especial throne of\nlove), had quickened its proceedings, from the exercise he took; from\nthe same cause, his calves increased so largely that even Jordas could\nnot pull the agate buttons of his gaiters through their holes. In a\nword, he gained flesh, muscle, bone, and digestion, and other great\nbodily blessings, from the power believed by the poets to upset\nand annihilate every one of them. However, this proves nothing\nanti-poetical, for the essence of that youth was to contradict\nexperience.\n\nJordas had never, in all his born days, not even in the thick of the\nsnow-drift, found himself more in a puzzle than now; and he could not\neven fly for advice in this matter to Lawyer Jellicorse. The first great\ngift of nature, expelled by education, is gratitude. A child is full\nof gratitude, or at least has got the room for it; but no full-grown\nmortal, after good education, has been known to keep the rudiments of\nthankfulness. But Jordas had a stock of it--as much as can remain to any\none superior to the making of a cross.\n\nNow the difficulty of it was that Jordas called to mind, every morning\nwhen he saw snow, and afterward when he saw anything white, that he must\nhave required a grave, and not got it (in time to be any good to him),\nwithout the hard labor, strong endurance, and brotherly tendance of\nthe people of the gill. Even the three grand fairy gifts of Lawyer\nJellicorse himself might scarcely have saved him, although they were no\nless than as follows, in virtue: the tip of a tongue that had never told\na lie (because it belonged to a bullock slain young), a flask of old\nScotch whiskey, and a horn comfit-box of Irish snuff. All these three\nhad stood him in good stead, especially the last, which kept him\nwide-awake, and enabled him to sneeze a yellow hole in the drift,\nwhenever it threatened to ingulf his beard. Without those three he could\nnever have got on; but, with all the three, he could never have got out,\nif Bat and Maunder of the gill had not come to his succor in the very\nnick of time. Not only did they work hard for hours under the guidance\nof Saracen (who was ready to fly at them if they left off), but when at\nlength they came on Jordas, in his last exhaustion, with the good horse\nrubbing up his chin to make him warmer, they did a sight of things,\nwhich the good Samaritan, having finer climate, was enabled to dispense\nwith. And when they had set him on his legs again, finding that he\ncould not use them yet, they hoisted him on the back of Maunder, who was\nstrong; and the whole of that expedition ended at the little cottage in\nthe gill. But the kindness of the inhabitants was only just beginning;\nfor when Jordas came to himself he found that his off-foot--as Marmaduke\nwould have called it--the one which had ridden with a northeast aspect,\nwas frozen as hard as a hammer, and as blue as a pistol barrel. Mrs.\nBart happened to have seen such cases in her native country, and by her\nskillful treatment and never-wearying care, the poor fellow's foot was\nsaved and cured, though at one time he despaired of it. Marmaduke also\nwas restored, and sent home to his stable some days before his rider was\nin a condition to mount him.\n\nIn return for all these benefits, how could the dogman, without being\nworse than a dog, go and say to his ladies that mischief was breeding\nbetween their heir and a poor girl who lived in a corner of their land?\nIf he had been ungrateful, or in any way a sneak, he might have found\nno trouble in this thing; but being, as he was, an honest, noble-hearted\nfellow, he battled severely in his mind to set up the standard of the\nproper side to take. For such matters Pet cared not one jot. Crafty as\nhe was, he could never understand that Jordas and Welldrum were not the\nsame man, one half working out-of-doors, and the other in. For him it\nwas enough that Jordas would not tell, probably because he was afraid\nto do so, and Pet resolved to make him useful. For Lancelot Carnaby was\nvery sharp indeed in espying what suited his purpose. His set purpose\nwas to marry Insie Bart, in whom he had sense enough to perceive his\nbetter, in every respect but money and birth, in which two he was\nbefore her, or at any rate supposed so. He was proud, as need be, of\nhis station in life; but he reasoned--if the process of his mind was\nreason--that being so exalted, he might please himself; that his wife\nwould rise to his rank, instead of lowering him; that her father was a\nman of education and a gentleman, although he worked with his own hands;\nand that Insie was a lady, though she went to fill a pitcher.\n\nFor one happy fact the youth deserved some credit, or rather, perhaps,\nhis youth deserved it for him. He was madly in love with Insie, and\nhis passion could not be of very high spiritual order; but the idea of\nobtaining her dishonorably never occurred to his mind for one moment. He\nknew her to be better, purer, and nobler than himself in every way; and\nhe felt, though he did not want to feel it, that her nature gave a\nlift to his. Insie, on the other hand, began to like him better, and to\ndespise him less and less; his reckless devotion to her made its way;\nand in spite of all her common-sense, his beauty and his lordly style\nhad attractions for her young romance. And at last her heart began to\nbound, like his, when they were together. \"With all thy faults, I love\nthee still,\" was the loose condition of her youthful mind.\n\nInto every combination, however steep and deep be the gill of its quiet\nincubation, a number of people and of things peep in, and will enter,\nlike the cuckoo, at the glimpse of a white feather, or even without it,\nunless beak and claw are shown. And now the intruder into Pet's love\nnest had the right to look in, and to pull him out, neck and crop,\nunless he sat there legally. Whether birds discharge fraternal duty is\na question for Notes and Queries even in the present most positive\nage. Sophocles says that the clever birds feed their parents and their\nbenefactors, and men ascribe piety to them in fables, as a needful\nensample to one another.\n\nBe that as it may, this Maunder Bart, when his rather slow attention was\nonce aroused, kept a sharp watch upon his young landlord's works. It was\nlucky for Pet that he meant no harm, and that Maunder had contemptuous\nfaith in him; otherwise Insie's brother would have shortly taken him up\nby his gaiters, and softly beaten his head in against a rock. For Mr.\nBart's son was of bitter, morose, and almost savage nature, silent,\nmoody, and as resolute as death. He resented and darkly repined at the\nloss of position and property of which he had heard, and he scorned the\nfine sentiments which had led to nothing at all substantial. It was not\nin his power to despise his father, for his mind felt the presence of\nthe larger one; but he did not love him as a son should do; neither did\nhe speak out his thoughts to anybody beyond a few mutters to his mother.\nBut he loved his gentle sister, and found in her a goodness which warmed\nhim up to think about getting some upon his own account.\n\nSuch thoughts, however, were fugitive, and Maunder's more general\nsubject of brooding was the wrong he had suffered through his father.\nHe was living and working like a peasant or a miner, instead of having\nhorses, and dogs, and men, and the right to kick out inferior people--as\nthat baby Lancelot Carnaby had--for no other reason, that he could find,\nthan the magnitude of his father's mind. He had gone into the subject\nwith his father long ago--for Mr. Bart felt a noble pride in his\nconvictions--and the son lamented with all his heart the extent of\nhis own father's mind. In his lonely walks, heavy hours, and hard\nwork--which last he never grudged, for his strength required outlet--he\npondered continually upon one thing, and now he seemed to see a chance\nof doing it. The first step in his upward course would be Insie's\nmarriage with Lancelot.\n\nPet, who had no fear of any one but Maunder, tried crafty little tricks\nto please him; but instead of earning many thanks, got none at all,\nwhich made him endeavor to improve himself. Mr. Bart's opinion of him\nnow began to follow the course of John Smithies's, and Smithies looked\nat it in one light only (ever since Pet so assaulted him, and then\ntrusted his good-will across the dark moors), and that light was that\n\"when you come to think of him, you mustn't be too hard upon him, after\nall.\" And one great excellence of this youth was that he cared not a\ndoit for general opinion, so long as he got his own special desire.\n\nHis desire was, not to let a day go by without sight and touch of Insie.\nThese were not to be had at a moment's notice, nor even by much care;\nand five times out of six he failed of so much as a glimpse or a word\nof her. For the weather and the time of year have much to say concerning\nthe course of the very truest love, and worse than the weather itself\ntoo often is the cloudy caprice of maiden mind.\n\nInsie's father must have known what attraction drew this youth to such\na cold unfurnished spot, and if he had been like other men, he would\neither have nipped in the bud this passion, or, for selfish reasons,\nfostered it. But being of large theoretical mind, he found his due\noutlet in giving advice.\n\nIt is plain at a glance that in such a case the mother is the proper one\nto give advice, and the father the one to act strenuously. But now Mrs.\nBart, who was a very good lady, and had gone through a world of\ntrouble from the want of money--the which she had cast away for sake of\nsomething better--came to the forefront of this pretty little business,\nas Insie's mother, vigorously.\n\n\"Christophare,\" she said to her husband, \"not often do I speak, between\nus, of the affairs it is wise to let alone. But now of our dear child\nInesa it is just that I should insist something. Mandaro, which you call\nEnglish Maunder, already is destroyed for life by the magnitude of\nyour good mind. It is just that his sister should find the occasion of\nreversion to her proper grade of life. For you, Christophare, I have\nabandoned all, and have the good right to claim something from you. And\nthe only thing that I demand is one--let Inesa return to the lady.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Bart, who had that sense of humor without which no man\ncan give his property away, \"I hope that she never has departed from\nit. But, my dear, as you make such a point of it, I will promise not to\ninterfere, unless there is any attempt to do wrong, and intrap a poor\nboy who does not know his own mind. Insie is his equal by birth and\neducation, and perhaps his superior in that which comes foremost\nnowadays--the money. Dream not that he is a great catch, my dear; I know\nmore of that matter than you do. It is possible that he may stand at the\naltar with little to settle upon his bride except his bright waistcoat\nand gaiters.\"\n\n\"Tush, Christophare! You are, to my mind, always an enigma.\"\n\n\"That is as it should be, and keeps me interesting still. But this is a\nmere boy and girl romance. If it meant anything, my only concern would\nbe to know whether the boy was good. If not, I should promptly kick him\nback to his own door.\"\n\n\"From my observation, he is very good--to attend to his rights, and make\nthe utmost of them.\"\n\nMr. Bart laughed, for he knew that a little hit at himself was intended;\nand very often now, as his joints began to stiffen, he wished that his\nyouth had been wiser. He stuck to his theories still; but his practice\nwould have been more of the practical kind, if it had come back to\nbe done again. But his children and his wife had no claim to bring\nup anything, because everything was gone before he undertook their\nbusiness. However, he obtained reproach--as always seems to happen--for\nthose doings of his early days which led to their existence. Still, he\nliked to make the best of things, and laughed, instead of arguing.\n\nFor a short time, therefore, Lancelot Carnaby seemed to have his own way\nin this matter, as well as in so many others. As soon as spring weather\nunbound the streams, and enlarged both the spots and the appetite of\ntrout (which mainly thrive together), Pet became seized, by his own\naccount, with insatiable love of angling. The beck of the gill, running\ninto the Lune, was alive, in those unpoaching days, with sweet little\ntrout of a very high breed, playful, mischievous, and indulging (while\nthey provoked) good hunger. These were trout who disdained to feed\nbasely on the ground when they could feed upward, ennobling almost every\ngulp with a glimpse of the upper creation. Mrs. Carnaby loved these\n\"graceful creatures,\" as she always called them, when fried well;\nand she thought it so good and so clever of her son to tempt her poor\nappetite with them.\n\n\"Philippa, he knows--perhaps your mind is absent,\" she said, as she put\nthe fifth trout on her plate at breakfast one fine morning--\"he feels\nthat these little creatures do me good, and to me it becomes a sacred\nduty to endeavor to eat them.\"\n\n\"You seem to succeed very well, Eliza.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, I manage to get on a little, from a sort of sporting feeling\nthat appeals to me. Before I begin to lift the skins of any of these\nlittle darlings, I can see my dear boy standing over the torrent, with\nhis wonderful boldness, and bright eagle eyes--\"\n\n\"To pull out a fish of an ounce and a half. Without any disrespect to\nPet, whose fishing apparel has cost 20 pounds, I believe that Jordas\ncatches every one of them.\"\n\nSad to say, this was even so; Lancelot tried once or twice, for some\nfive minutes at a time, throwing the fly as he threw a skittle-ball; but\nfinding no fish at once respond to his precipitance, down he cast the\nrod, and left the rest of it to Jordas. But inasmuch as he brought\nback fish whenever he went out fishing, and looked as brilliant\nand picturesque as a salmon-fly, in his new costume, his mother was\ndelighted, and his aunt, being full of fresh troubles, paid small heed\nto him.\n\nFor as soon as the roads became safe again, and an honest attorney could\nenter \"horse hire\" in his bill without being too chivalrous, and the ink\nthat had clotted in the good-will time began to form black blood again,\nMr. Jellicorse himself resolved legitimately to set forth upon a legal\nenterprise. The winter had shaken him slightly--for even a solicitor's\nbody is vulnerable; and well for the clerk of the weather it is that no\naction lies against him--and his good wife told him to be very careful,\nalthough he looked as young as ever. She had no great opinion of the\npeople he was going to, and was sure that they would be too high and\nmighty even to see that his bed was aired. For her part, she hoped that\nthe reports were true which were now getting into every honest person's\nmouth; and if he would listen to a woman's common-sense, and at once\ngo over to the other side, it would serve them quite right, and be the\nbetter for his family, and give a good lift to his profession. But his\nhonesty was stout, and vanquished even his pride in his profession.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nPRINCELY TREATMENT\n\n\n\"This, then, is what you have to say,\" cried my lady Philippa, in a tone\nof little gratitude, and perhaps not purely free from wrath; \"this is\nwhat has happened, while you did nothing?\"\n\n\"Madam, I assure you,\" Mr. Jellicorse replied, \"that no one point has\nbeen neglected. And truly I am bold enough--though you may not perceive\nit--to take a little credit to myself for the skill and activity of my\nproceedings. I have a most conceited man against me; no member at all\nof our honored profession; but rather inclined to make light of us.\nA gentleman--if one may so describe him--of the name of Mordacks, who\nlives in a den below a bridge in York, and has very long harassed\nthe law by a sort of cheap-jack, slap-dash, low-minded style of doing\nthings. 'Jobbing,' I may call it--cheap and nasty jobbing--not at all\nthe proper thing, from a correct point of view. 'A catch-penny fellow,'\nthat's the proper name for him--I was trying to think of it half the way\nfrom Middleton.\"\n\n\"And now, in your eloquence, you have hit upon it. I can easily\nunderstand that such a style of business would not meet with your\napprobation. But, Mr. Jellicorse, he seems to me to have proved himself\nconsiderably more active in his way--however objectionable that may\nbe--than you, as our agent, have shown yourself.\"\n\nThe cheerful, expressive, and innocent face of Mr. Jellicorse protested\nnow. By nature he was almost as honest as Geoffrey Mordacks himself\ncould be; and in spite of a very long professional career, the original\nelement was there, and must be charged for.\n\n\"I can not recall to my memory,\" he said, \"any instance of neglect on my\npart. But if that impression is upon your mind, it would be better for\nyou to change your legal advisers at an early opportunity. Such has been\nthe frequent practice, madam, of your family. And but for that, none of\nthis trouble could exist. I must beg you either to withdraw the charge\nof negligence, which I understand you to have brought, or else to\nappoint some gentleman of greater activity to conduct your business.\"\n\nWith the haughtiness of her headstrong race, Miss Yordas had failed as\nyet to comprehend that a lawyer could be a gentleman. And even now that\nidea scarcely broke upon her, until she looked hard at Mr. Jellicorse.\nBut he, having cast aside all deference for the moment, met her stern\ngaze with such courteous indifference and poise of self-composure that\nshe suddenly remembered that his grandfather had been the master of a\npack of fox-hounds.\n\n\"I have made no charge of negligence; you are hasty, and misunderstand\nme,\" she answered, after waiting for him to begin again, as if he were a\nrash aggressor. \"It is possible that you desire to abandon our case, and\nconceive affront where none is meant whatever.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" Mr. Jellicorse exclaimed, with his legal state of mind\nreturning. \"A finer case never came into any court of law. There is a\ncoarse axiom, not without some truth, that possession is nine points of\nthe law. We have possession. What is even more important, we have the\nhostile instrument in our possession.\"\n\n\"You mean that unfortunate and unjust deed, of a by-gone time, that was\nso wickedly concealed? Dishonest transaction from first to last!\"\n\n\"Madam, the law is not to blame for that, nor even the lawyers; but the\nclients, who kept changing them. But for that, your admirable father\nmust have known that the will he dictated to me was waste paper. At\nleast as regards the main part of these demesnes.\"\n\n\"What monstrous injustice! A positive premium upon filial depravity. You\nregard things professionally, I suppose. But surely it must have struck\nyou as a flagrant dishonesty, a base and wicked crime, that a document\nso vile should be allowed even to exist.\"\n\nMiss Yordas had spoken with unusual heat; and the lawyer looked at her\nwith an air of mild inquiry. Was it possible that she suggested to him\nthe destruction of the wicked instrument? Ladies had done queer things,\nwithin his knowledge; but this lady showed herself too cautious for\nthat.\n\n\"I know what my father would have done in such a case,\" she continued,\nwith her tranquil smile recovered: \"he would just have ridden up to his\nsolicitor's office, demanded the implement of robbery, brought it home,\nand set it upon the hall fire, in the presence of the whole of his\nfamily and household. But now we live in such a strictly lawful age that\nno crime can be stopped, if only perpetrated legally. And you say\nthat Mr. More--something, 'Moresharp,' I think it was, knows of that\niniquitous production?\"\n\n\"Madam, we can not be certain; but I have reason to suspect that Mr.\nMordacks has got wind of that unfortunate deed of appointment.\"\n\n\"Supposing that he has, and that he means to use his knowledge, he can\nnot force the document from your possession, can he?\"\n\n\"Not without an order. But by filing affidavit, after issue of writ in\nejectment, they may compel us to produce, and allow attested copy to be\ntaken.\"\n\n\"Then the law is disgraceful to the last degree, and it is useless to\nown anything. That deed is in your charge, as our attorney, I suppose,\nsir?\"\n\n\"By no other right, madam: we have twelve chestfuls, any one or all of\nwhich I am bound to render up to your order.\"\n\n\"Our confidence in you is unshaken. But without shaking it we might\norder home any particular chest for inspection?\"\n\n\"Most certainly, madam, by giving us receipt for it. For antiquarian\nuses, and others, such a thing is by no means irregular. And the oldest\nof all the deeds are in that box--charters from the crown, grants from\ncorporations, records of assay by arms--warrants that even I can not\ndecipher.\"\n\n\"A very learned gentleman is likely soon to visit us--a man of modern\nfamily, who spends his whole time in seeking out the stories of the\nolder ones. No family in Yorkshire is comparable to ours in the interest\nof its annals.\"\n\n\"That is a truth beyond all denial, madam. The character of your ancient\nrace has always been a marked one.\"\n\n\"And always honorable, Mr. Jellicorse. Undeviating principle has\ndistinguished all my ancestors. Nothing has ever been allowed to stand\nbetween them and their view of right.\"\n\n\"You could not have put it more clearly, Mistress Yordas. Their own view\nof right has been their guiding star throughout. And they never have\nfailed to act accordingly.\"\n\n\"Alas! of how very few others can we say it! But being of a very good\nold family yourself, you are able to appreciate such conduct. You\nwould like me, perhaps, to sign the order for that box of\nancient--cartularies--is not that the proper word for them? And it might\nbe as well to state why they happen to be wanted--for purposes of family\nhistory.\"\n\n\"Madam, I will at once prepare a memorandum for your signature and your\nsister's.\"\n\nThe mind of Mr. Jellicorse was much relieved, although the relief was\nnot untempered with misgivings. He sat down immediately at an ancient\nwriting-table, and prepared a short order for delivery, to their\ntrusty servant Jordas, of a certain box, with the letter C upon it, and\ncontaining title-deeds of Scargate Hall estate.\n\n\"I think it might be simpler not to put it so precisely,\" my lady\nPhilippa suggested, \"but merely to say a box containing the oldest of\nthe title-deeds, as required for an impending antiquarian research.\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse made the amendment; and then, with the prudence of long\npractice, added, \"The order should be in your handwriting, madam; will\nit give you too much trouble just to copy it?\" \"How can it signify,\nif it bears our signatures?\" his client asked, with a smile at such\na trifle; however, she sat down, and copied it upon another sheet\nof paper. Then Mr. Jellicorse, beautifully bowing, drew near to take\npossession of his own handwriting; but the lady, with a bow of even\ngreater elegance, lifted the cover of the standing desk, and therein\nplaced both manuscripts; and the lawyer perceived that he could say\nnothing.\n\n\"How delightful it is to be quit of business!\" The hostess now looked\nhospitable. \"We need not recur to this matter, I do hope. That paper,\nwhatever it is, will be signed by both of us, and handed over to you,\nin your legal head-quarters, to-morrow. We must have the pleasure of\nsending you home in the morning, Mr. Jellicorse. We have bought a very\nwonderful vehicle, invented for such roads as ours, and to supersede the\njumping-car. It is warranted to traverse any place a horse can\ntravel, with luxurious ease to the passengers, and safety of no common\ndescription. Jordas will drive you; your horse can trot behind; and you\ncan send back by it whatever there may be.\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse detested new inventions, and objected most strongly to\nany experiment made in his own body. However, he would rather die\nthan plead his time of life in bar, and his faith in the dogman was\nunlimited. And now the gentle Mrs. Carnaby, who had gracefully taken\nflight from \"horrid business,\" returned in an evening dress and with\na sweetly smiling countenance, and very nearly turned the Jellicorsian\nhead, snowy as it was, with soft attentions and delicious deference.\n\n\"I was treated like a prince,\" he said next day, when delivered safe at\nhome, and resting among his rather dingy household gods. \"There never\ncould have been a more absurd idea than that notion of yours about my\nbeing put into wet sheets, Diana. Why, I even had my night-cap warmed;\nand a young woman came, with a blush upon her face, and a question\nwhether I would be pleased to sleep in a gross of Naples stockings! Ah,\nto my mind, after all, it proves what I have always said--that there is\nnothing like old blood.\"\n\n\"Nothing like old blood for being made a fool of,\" his wife replied,\nwith a coarseness which made him shiver, after Mrs. Carnaby. \"They know\nwhat they are about, I'll lay a penny. Some roguery, no doubt, that they\nseek to lead you into. That is what their night-caps and stockings mean.\nHow low it is to make a foreground of them!\"\n\n\"Hush, my dear! I can not bear such want of charity. And what is even\nworse, you expose me to an action at law, with heavy damages.\"\n\nThe lawyer had sundry little qualms of conscience, which were deepened\nby his wife's sagacious words; and suddenly it struck him that the\nnew-fangled vehicle which had brought him home so quietly from Scargate\nhad shown a strange inability to stand still for more than two minutes\nat his side door. So much had he been hurried by the apparent straits of\nhis charioteer that he ran out with box C without ever stopping to make\nan inventory of its contents--as he intended to do--or even looking\nwhether the all-important deed was there. In fact, he had scarcely time\nto seal up the key in a separate package, hand it to Jordas, and take\nthe order (now become a receipt) from the horny fist of the dogman,\nbefore Marmaduke, rendered more dashing by snow-drift, was away like a\nthunder-bolt--if such a thing there be, and if it has four legs.\n\n\"How could I have helped doing as I have done?\" he whispered to himself,\nuncomfortably. \"Here are two ladies of high position, and they send a\njoint order for their property. By-the-bye, I will just have a look at\nthat order, now that there is no horse to jump over me.\" Upon going to\nthe day file, he found the order right, transcribed from his own amended\ncopy, and bearing two signatures, as it should do. But it struck him\nthat the words \"Eliza Carnaby\" were written too boldly for that lady's\nhand; and the more he looked at them, the more he was convinced of\nit. That was no concern of his, for it was not his duty, under the\ncircumstances of the case, to verify her signature. But this conviction\ndrove him to an uncomfortable conclusion--\"Miss Yordas intends to\ndestroy that deed without her sister's knowledge. She knows that her\nsister's nerve is weaker, and she does not like to involve her in\nthe job. A very brave, sisterly feeling, no doubt, and much the wiser\ncourse, if she means to do it. It is a bold stroke, and well worthy of\na Yordas. But I hope, with all my heart, that she never can have thought\nof it. And she kept that order in my handwriting to make it look as if\nthe suggestion came from me! And I am as innocent as any lamb is of the\nfrauds that shall come to be written on his skin. The duty of attorney\ntoward client prevents me from opening my lips upon the matter. But she\nis a deep woman, and a bold one too. May the Lord direct things aright!\nI shall retire, and let Robert have the practice, as soon as Brown's\nbankruptcy has worn out captious creditors. It is the Lord alone that\ndoeth all things well.\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse knew that he had done his best; and though doubtful of\nthe turn which things had taken, with some exclusion of his agency, he\nfelt (though his conscience told him not to feel it) that here was one\ntrue source of joy. That impudent, dashing, unprofessional man, who was\nalways poking his vile unarticled nose into legal business, that fellow\nof the name of Mordacks, now would have no locus standi left. At least\na hundred and fifty firms, of good standing in the county, detested that\nman, and even a judge would import a scintillula juris into any measure\nwhich relieved the country of him. Meditating thus, he heard a knock.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nSTAND AND DELIVER\n\n\nThe day was not far worn as yet; and May month having come at last, the\nday could stand a good deal of wear. With Jordas burning to exhibit the\nwonders of the new machine (which had been bought upon his advice),\nand with Marmaduke conscious of the new gloss on his coat, all previous\ntimes had been beaten--as the sporting writers put it; that is to say,\nall previous times of the journey from Scargate to Middleton, for any\nman who sat on wheels. A rider would take a shorter cut, and have many\nother advantages; but for a driver the time had been the quickest upon\nrecord.\n\nMr. Jellicorse, exulting in his safety, had imprinted the chaste salute\nupon his good wife's cheek at ten minutes after one o'clock; when the\nclerks in the office with laudable promptitude (not expecting him as\nyet) had unanimously cast down pen, and betaken hand and foot toward\nknife and fork. Instead of blaming them, this good lawyer went upon that\nsame road himself, with the great advantage that the road to his dinner\nlay through his own kitchen. At dinner-time he had much to tell, and\nmany large helps to receive, of interest and of admiration, especially\nfrom his pet child Emily (who forgot herself so largely as to lick her\nspoon while gazing), and after dinner he was not without reasons for\nletting perhaps a little of the time slip by. Therefore, by the time he\nhad described all dangers, discharged his duty to all comforts, and held\nthe little confidential talk with his wife and himself above recorded,\nthe clock had made its way to half past three.\n\nMrs. Jellicorse and Emily were gone forth to pay visits; the clerks,\nshut away in their own room, were busy, scratching up a lovely case for\nnisi prius; the cook had thrown the sifted cinders on the kitchen fire,\nand was gone with the maids to exchange just a few constitutional words\nwith the gardener; and the whole house was drowsy with that by-time when\nlight and shadow seem to mix together, and far-away sounds take a faint\nto and fro, as if they were the pendulum of silence.\n\n\"That is Emily's knock. Impatient child! Come back for her mother's\ngloves, or something. All the people are out; I must go and let her in.\"\n\nWith these words, and a little placid frown--because a soft nap was\nimpending on his eyelids, and yet they were always glad to open on his\nfavorite--the worthy lawyer rose, and took a pinch of snuff to rouse\nhimself; but before he could get to the door, a louder and more\nimpatient rap almost made him jump.\n\n\"What a hurry you are in, my dear! You really should try to learn some\nlittle patience.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, he opened the door; and behold, there was no\nlittle girl, but a tall and stately gentleman in horseman's dress, and\nof strong commanding aspect.\n\n\"What is your pleasure, sir?\" the lawyer asked, while his heart began\nto flutter; for exactly such a visitor had caused him scare of his life,\nwhen stronger by a quarter of a century than now.\n\n\"My pleasure, or rather my business, is with Mr. Jellicorse, the\nlawyer.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you have come to the right man for it. My name is\nJellicorse, and greatly at your service. Allow me the honor of inviting\nyou within.\"\n\n\"My name is Yordas--Sir Duncan Yordas,\" said the stranger, when seated\nin the lawyer's private room. \"My father, Philip Yordas, was a client of\nyours, and of other legal gentlemen before he came to you. Upon the day\nof his death, in the year 1777, you prepared his will, which you have\nsince found to be of no effect, except as regards his personal estate,\nand about one-eighth part of the realty. Of the bulk of the land,\nincluding Scargate Hall, he could not dispose, for the simple reason\nthat it had been strictly entailed by a deed executed by my grandfather\nand his wife in 1751. Under that entail I take in fee, for it could not\nhave been barred without me; and I never concurred in any disentailing\ndeed, and my father never knew that such was needful.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Sir Duncan, but you seem to be wonderfully apt with the\nterms of our profession.\"\n\n\"I could scarcely be otherwise, after all that I have had to do with\nlaw, in India. Our first object is to apply our own laws, and our second\nto spread our religion. But no more of that. Do you admit the truth of a\nmatter so stated that you can not fail to grasp it?\"\n\nSir Duncan Yordas, as he put this question, fixed large, unwavering, and\npiercing eyes (against which no spectacles were any shelter) upon the\nmild, amiable, and, generally speaking, very honest orbs of sight\nwhich had lighted the path of the elder gentleman to good repute and\ncompetence. But who may turn a lawyer's hand from the Heaven-sped legal\nplough?\n\n\"Am I to understand, Sir Duncan Yordas, that your visit to me is of an\namicable nature, and intended (without prejudice to other interests) to\nascertain, so far as may be compatible with professional rules, how far\nmy clients are acquainted with documents alleged or imagined to be in\nexistence, and how far their conduct might be guided by desire to afford\nevery reasonable facility?\"\n\n\"You are to understand simply this, that as the proper owner of Scargate\nHall, and the main part of the estates held with it, I require you to\nsign a memorandum that you hold all the title-deeds on my behalf, and to\ndeliver at once to me that entailing instrument of 1751, under which I\nmake my claim.\"\n\n\"You speak, sir, as if you had already brought your action, and entered\nverdict. Legal process may be dispensed with in barbarous countries, but\nnot here. The title-deeds and other papers of Scargate Hall were placed\nin my custody neither by you nor on your behalf, sir. I hold them\non behalf of those at present in possession; and until I receive due\ninstructions from them, or a final order from a court of law, I should\nbe guilty of a breach of trust if I parted with a dog's-ear of them.\"\n\n\"You distinctly refuse my requirements, and defy me to enforce them?\"\n\n\"Not so, Sir Duncan. I do nothing more than declare what my view of my\nduty is, and decline in any way to depart from it.\"\n\n\"Upon that score I have nothing more to say. I did not expect you to\ngive up the deeds, though in 'barbarous countries,' as you call them, we\nhave peremptory ways. I will say more than that, Mr. Jellicorse--I will\nsay that I respect you for clinging to what you must know better than\nanybody else to be the weaker side.\"\n\nThe lawyer bowed his very best bow, but was bound to enter protest\nagainst the calm assumption of the claimant.\n\n\"Let us leave that question,\" Sir Duncan said; \"the time would fail\nus to discuss that now. But one thing I surely may insist upon as\nthe proper heir of my grandfather. I may desire you to produce for my\ninspection that deed in pursuance of his marriage settlement, which has\nfor so many years lain concealed.\"\n\n\"With pleasure I will do so, Sir Duncan Yordas (presuming that any such\ndeed exists), upon the production of an order from the Court either of\nKing's Bench or of Common Pleas.\"\n\n\"In that case you would be obliged to produce it, and would earn no\nthanks of mine. But I ask you to lay aside the legal aspect; for no\naction is pending, and perhaps never will be. I ask you, as a valued\nadviser of the family, and a trustworthy friend to its interests--as a\ngentleman, in fact, rather than a mere lawyer--to do a wise and amicable\nthing. You can not in any way injure your case, if a law case is to\ncome of it, because we know all about the deed already. We even have\nan abstract of it as clear as you yourself could make, and we have\ndiscovered that one of the witnesses is still alive. I have come to you\nmyself in preference to employing a lawyer, because I hope, if you meet\nme frankly, to put things in train for a friendly and fair settlement.\nI am not a young man; I have been disappointed of any one to succeed me,\nand I wish to settle my affairs in this country, and return to India,\nwhich suits me better, and where I am more useful. My sisters have not\nbehaved kindly to me; but that I must try to forgive and forget. I\nhave thought matters over, and am quite prepared to offer very liberal\nterms--in short, to leave them in possession of Scargate, upon certain\nconditions and in a certain manner.\"\n\n\"Really, Sir Duncan,\" Mr. Jellicorse exclaimed, \"allow me to offer you\na pinch of snuff. You are pleased with it? Yes, it is of quite superior\nquality. It saved the life of a most admirable fellow, a henchman\nof your family--in fact, poor Jordas. The power of this snuff alone\nsupported him from freezing--\"\n\n\"At another time I may be highly interested in that matter,\" the visitor\nreplied, without meaning to be rude, but knowing that the man of law was\nmaking passes to gain time; \"just at present I must ask you to say yes\nor no. If you wish me to set my offer plainly before you, and so relieve\nthe property of the cost of a hopeless struggle--for I have taken the\nopinion of the first real property counsel of the age--you will, as a\ntoken of good faith and of common-sense, produce for my inspection that\ndeed-poll of November 15, 1751.\"\n\nPoor Mr. Jellicorse was desperately driven. He looked round the room, to\nseek for any interruption. He went to the window, and pretended to see\nanother visitor knocking at the door. But no help came; he must face\nit out himself; and Sir Duncan, with his quiet resolution, looked more\nstern than his violent father.\n\n\"I think that before we proceed any further,\" said the lawyer, at last\nsitting down, and taking up a pen and trying what the nib was like, \"we\nreally should understand a little where we are already. My own desire to\navoid litigation is very strong--almost unprofessionally so--though\nthe first thing consulted by all of us naturally is the pocket of our\nclient--\"\n\n\"Whether it will hold out, I suppose.\" Sir Duncan Yordas departed from\nhis dignity in saying this, and was sorry as soon as he had said it.\n\n\"That is the vulgar impression about us, which it is our duty to\ndisdain. But without losing time upon that question, let me ask, what\nshall I put down as your proposition, sir?\"\n\n\"There is nothing to put down. That is just the point. I do not come\nhere with any formal proposition. If that had been my object, I would\nhave brought a lawyer. What I say is that I have the right to see that\ndeed. It forms no part of my sisters' title-deeds, but even destroys\ntheir title. It belongs to me, it is my property, and only through fraud\nis it now in your hands. Of course we can easily wrest it from you, and\nmust do so if you defy me. It rests with you to take that risk. But I\nprefer to cut things short. I pledge myself to two things--first, to\nleave the document in your possession; and next, to offer fair and even\nhandsome terms when you have met me thus fairly. Why should you object?\nFor we know all about it. Never mind how.\"\n\nThose last three words decided the issue. Even worse than the fear of\nbreach of trust was the fear of treason in the office, and the lawyer's\nonly chance of getting clew to that was to keep on terms with this Sir\nDuncan Yordas. There had been no treason whatever in the office; neither\nhad anything come out through the proctorial firm in York, or Sir Walter\nCarnaby's solicitors; but a note among longheaded Duncombe's papers had\ngot into the hands of Mordacks. Of that, however, Mr. Jellicorse had no\nidea.\n\n\"Sir Duncan Yordas, I will meet you as you come,\" he said, with his\ngood, fresh-colored face, as honest as the sun when the clouds roll off.\n\"It is an unusual step on my part, and perhaps irregular. But rather\nthan destroy the prospect of a friendly compromise, I will strain\na point, and candidly admit that there is an instrument open to an\ninterpretation which might, or might not, be in your favor.\"\n\n\"That I knew long ago, and more than that. My demand is--to see it, and\nto satisfy myself.\"\n\n\"Under the circumstances, I am half inclined to think that I should\nbe disposed to allow you that privilege if the document were in my\npossession.\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Jellicorse,\" Sir Duncan answered, showing his temper in his\neyes alone, \"how much longer will you trifle with me? Where is that\ndeed?\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse drew forth his watch, took off his spectacles, and dusted\nthem carefully with a soft yellow handkerchief; then restored them to\ntheir double sphere of usefulness, and perused, with some diligence, the\ntime of day. By the law which compels a man to sneeze when another man\nsets the example, Sir Duncan also drew forth his watch.\n\n\"I am trying to make my reply as accurate,\" said the lawyer, beginning\nto enjoy the position as a man, though not quite as a lawyer--\"as\naccurate as your candor and confidence really deserve, Sir Duncan. The\nbox containing that document, to which you attach so much importance\n(whether duly or otherwise is not for me to say until counsel's opinion\nhas been taken on our side), considering the powers of the horse, that\nbox should be about Stormy Gap by this time. A quarter to four by me.\nWhat does your watch say, sir?\"\n\n\"The deed has been sent for, post-haste, has it? And you know for what\npurpose?\"\n\n\"You must draw a distinction between the deed and the box containing\nit, Sir Duncan. Or, to put it more accurately, betwixt that deed and its\ncasual accompaniments. It happens to be among very old charters, which\nhappen to be wanted for certain excellent antiquarian purposes.\nSuch things are not in my line, I must confess, although so deeply\ninteresting. But a very learned man seems to have expressed--\"\n\n\"Rubbish. Excuse me, but you are most provoking. You know, as well as I\ndo, that robbery is intended, and you allow yourself to be made a party\nto it.\"\n\nThis was the simple truth; and the lawyer, being (by some strange\ninversion of professional excellence) honest at the bottom, was deeply\npained at having such words used, as to, for, about, or in anywise\nconcerning him.\n\n\"I think, Sir Duncan, that you will be sorry,\" he answered, with much\ndignity, \"for employing such language where it can not be resented. Your\nfather was a violent man, and we all expect violence of your family.\"\n\n\"There is no time to go into that question now. If I have wronged you,\nI will beg your pardon. A very few hours will prove how that is. How and\nby whom have you sent the box?\"\n\nMr. Jellicorse answered, rather stiffly, that his clients had sent a\ntrusty servant with a light vehicle to fetch the box, and that now he\nmust be half way toward home.\n\n\"I shall overtake him,\" said Sir Duncan, with a smile; \"I have a good\nhorse, and I know the shortcuts. Hoofs without wheels go a yard to a\nfoot upon such rocky collar-work.\"\n\nWithout another word, except \"Good-by,\" Sir Duncan Yordas left the\nhouse, walked rapidly to the inn, and cut short the dinner his good\nhorse was standing up to. In a very few minutes he was on Tees bridge,\nwith his face toward the home of his ancestors.\n\nIt may be supposed that neither his thoughts nor those of the lawyer\nwere very cheerful. Mr. Jellicorse was deeply anxious as to the conflict\nwhich must ensue, and as to the figure his fair fame might cut, if this\nstrange transaction should be exposed and calumniated by evil tongues.\nIn these elderly days, and with all experience, he had laid himself\nopen, not legally perhaps, but morally, to the heavy charge of\nconnivance at a felonious act, and even some contribution toward it. He\ntold himself vainly that he could not help it, that the documents were\nin his charge only until he was ordered to give them up, and that it was\nno concern of his to anticipate what might become of them. His position\nhad truly been difficult, but still he might have escaped from it with\nclearer conscience. His duty was to cast away drawing-room manners, and\nwarn Miss Yordas that the document she hated so was not her own to deal\nwith, but belonged (in equity at least) to those who were entitled under\nit, and that to take advantage of her wrongful possession, and destroy\nthe foe, was a crime, and, more than that, a shabby one. The former\npoint might not have stopped her; but the latter would have done so\nwithout fail, for her pride was equal to her daring. But poor Mr.\nJellicorse had felt the power of a will more resolute than his own, and\nof grand surroundings and exalted style; and his desire to please had\nconfused, and thereby overcome, his perception of the right. But now\nthese reflections were all too late, and the weary brain found comfort\nonly in the shelter of its night-cap.\n\nIf a little slip had brought a very good man to unhappiness, how much\nharder was it for Sir Duncan Yordas, who had committed no offense at\nall! No Yordas had ever cared a tittle for tattle--to use their own\nexpression--but deeper mischief than tattle must ensue, unless great\nluck prevented it. The brother knew well that his sister inherited much\nof the reckless self-will which had made the name almost a by-word,\nand which had been master of his own life until large experience of\nthe world, and the sense of responsible power, curbed it. He had little\naffection for that sister left--for she had used him cruelly, and even\nnow was imbittering the injury--but he still had some tender feeling for\nthe other, who had always been his favorite. And though cut off, by his\nfather's act, from due headship of the family, he was deeply grieved, in\nthis more enlightened age, to expose their uncivilized turbulence.\n\nTherefore he spurred his willing horse against the hill, and up the\nmany-winding ruggedness of road, hoping, at every turn, to descry in the\ndistance the vehicle carrying that very plaguesome box. If his son had\nbeen there, he might have told him, on the ridge of Stormy Gap (which\ncommanded high and low, rough and smooth, dark and light, for miles\nahead), that Jordas was taking the final turn, by the furthest gleam of\nthe water-mist, whence the stone road labored up to Scargate. But Sir\nDuncan's eyes--though as keen as an eagle's while young--had now seen\ntoo much of the sun to make out that gray atom gliding in the sunset\nhaze.\n\nUpon the whole, it was a lucky thing that he could not overtake the car;\nfor Jordas would never have yielded his trust while any life was in him;\nand Sir Duncan having no knowledge of him, except as a boy-of-all-work\nabout the place, might have been tempted to use the sword, without which\nno horseman then rode there. Or failing that, a struggle between two\nequally resolute men must have followed, with none at hand to part them.\n\nWhen the horseman came to the foot of the long steep pull leading up to\nthe stronghold of his race, he just caught a glimpse of the car turning\nin at the entrance of the court-yard. \"They have half an hour's start of\nme,\" he thought, as he drew up behind a rock, that the house might not\ndescry him; \"if I ride up in full view, I hurry the mischief. Philippa\nwill welcome me with the embers of my title. She must not suspect that\nthe matter is so urgent. Nobody shall know that I am coming. For many\nreasons I had better try the private road below the Scarfe.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nTHE SCARFE\n\n\nJordas, without suspicion of pursuit, had allowed no grass to grow under\nthe feet of Marmaduke on the homeward way. His orders were to use all\nspeed, to do as he had done at the lawyer's private door, and then,\nwithout baiting his horse, to drive back, reserving the nose-bag for\nsome very humpy halting-place. There is no such man, at the present time\nof day, to carry out strict orders, as the dogman was, and the chance\nof there being such a one again diminishes by very rapid process.\nMarmaduke, as a horse, was of equal quality, reasoning not about his\norders, but about the way to do them.\n\nThere was no special emergency now, so far as my lady Philippa knew; but\nthe manner of her mind was to leave no space between a resolution and\nits execution. This is the way to go up in the world, or else to go down\nabruptly; and to her the latter would have been far better than to halt\nbetween two opinions. Her plan had been shaped and set last night, and,\nlike all great ideas, was the simplest of the simple. And Jordas, who\nhad inklings of his own, though never admitted to confidence, knew how\nto carry out the outer part.\n\n\"When the turbot comes,\" she said to Welldrum, as soon as her long sight\nshowed her the trusty Jordas beginning the home ascent, \"it is to be\ntaken first out of the car, and to my sister's sitting-room; the other\nthings Jordas will see to. I may be going for a little walk. But you\nwill at once carry up the turbot. Mrs. Carnaby's appetite is delicate.\"\n\nThe butler had his own opinion upon that interesting subject. But in her\npresence it must be his own. Any attempt at enlargement of her mind by\nexchange of sentiment--such as Mrs. Carnaby permitted and enjoyed--would\nhave sent him flying down the hill, pursued by square-toed men prepared\nto add elasticity to velocity. Therefore Welldrum made a leg in silence,\nand retreated, while his mistress prepared for her intended exploit. She\nhad her beaver hat and mantle ready by the shrubbery door--as a little\nquiet postern of her own was called--and in the heavy standing desk, or\n\"secretary,\" of her private room she had stored a flat basket, or frail,\nof stout flags, with a heavy clock weight inside it.\n\n\"Much better to drown the wretched thing than burn it,\" she had been\nsaying to herself, \"especially at this time of year, when fires are weak\nand telltale. And parchment makes such a nasty smell; Eliza might come\nin and suspect it. But the Scarfe is a trusty confidant.\"\n\nMistress Yordas, while sure that her sister (having even more than\nherself at stake) would approve and even applaud her scheme, was equally\nsure that it must be kept from her, both for its own sake and for hers.\nAnd the sooner it was done, the less the chance of disturbing poor\nEliza's mind.\n\nThe Scarfe is a deep pool, supposed to have no bottom (except, perhaps,\nin the very bowels of the earth), upon one of the wildest head-waters of\nthe Tees. A strong mountain torrent from a desolate ravine springs forth\nwith great ferocity, and sooner than put up with any more stabs from\nthe rugged earth, casts itself on air. For a hundred and twenty feet the\nwater is bright, in the novelty and the power of itself, striking out\nfreaks of eccentric flashes, and even little sun-bows, in fine weather.\nBut the triumph is brief; and a heavy retribution, created by its\nviolence, awaits below. From the tossing turmoil of the fall two white\nvolumes roll away, with a clash of waves between them, and sweeping\nround the craggy basin, meet (like a snowy wreath) below, and rush back\nin coiling eddies flaked with foam. All the middle is dark deep water,\nlooking on the watch for something to suck down.\n\nWhat better duty, or more pious, could a hole like this perform, than\nthat of swallowing up a lawyer; or, if no such morsel offered, then at\nleast a lawyer's deeds? Many a sheep had been there ingulfed, and never\nsaluted by her lambs again; and although a lawyer by no means is a sheep\n(except in his clothing, and his eyes perhaps), yet his doings appear\nupon the skin thereof, and enhance its value more than drugs of Tyre.\nAnd it is to be feared that some fleeced clients will not feel the\nhorror which they ought to feel at the mode pursued by Mistress Yordas\nin the delivery of her act and deed.\n\nShe came down the dell, from the private grounds of Scargate, with a\nresolute face, and a step of strength. The clock weight, that should\nknow time no more, was well imbosomed in the old deed-poll, and all\nstitched firmly in the tough brown frail, whose handles would help for a\nlong strong cast. Towering crags, and a ridge of jagged scaurs, shut out\nthe sunset, while a thicket of dwarf oak, and the never-absent bramble,\naproned the yellow dugs of shale with brown. In the middle was the\ncaldron of the torrent, called the \"Scarfe,\" with the sheer trap-rock,\nwhich is green in the sunlight, like black night flung around it, while\na snowy wreath of mist (like foam exhaling) circled round the basined\nsteep, or hovered over the chasm.\n\nMiss Yordas had very stanch nerves, but still, for reasons of her own,\nshe disliked this place, and never came near it for pleasure's sake,\nalthough in dry summers, when the springs were low, the fury of the\nscene passed into grandeur, and even beauty. But a Yordas (long ago gone\nto answer for it) had flung a man, who plagued him with the law, into\nthis hole. And what was more disheartening, although of less importance,\na favorite maid of this lady, upon the exile of her sweetheart, hearing\nthat his feet were upside down to hers, and that this hole went right\nthrough the earth, had jumped into it, in a lonely moment, instead of\ntaking lessons in geography. Philippa Yordas was as brave as need be;\nbut now her heart began to creep as coldly as the shadows crept.\n\nFor now she was out of sight of home, and out of hearing of any sound,\nexcept the roaring of the force. The Hall was half a mile away, behind\na shoulder of thick-ribbed hill; and it took no sight of this torrent,\nuntil it became a quiet river by the downward road. \"I must be getting\nold,\" Miss Yordas thought, \"or else this path is much rougher than it\nused to be. Why, it seems to be getting quite dangerous! It is too bad\nof Jordas not to see to things better. My father used to ride this way\nsometimes. But how could a horse get along here now?\"\n\nThere used to be a bridle-road from the grounds of Scargate to a ford\nbelow the force, and northward thence toward the Tees; or by keeping\ndown stream, and then fording it again, a rider might hit upon\nthe Middleton road, near the rock that warned the public of the\nblood-hounds. This bridle-road kept a great distance from the cliffs\noverhanging the perilous Scarfe; and the only way down to a view of\nthe fall was a scrambling track, over rocks and trunks, unworthy to\nbe called a foot-path. The lady with the bag had no choice left but to\nfollow this track, or else abandon her intention. For a moment she\nwas sorry that she had not been satisfied with some less troublesome\ndestruction of her foe, even at the risk of chance suspicions. But\nhaving thus begun it, she would not turn back, and be angry with her\nidle fears when she came to think of them.\n\nWith hereditary scorn of second thoughts she cast away doubt, and went\ndown the steep, and stood on the brow of sheer rock, to recover her\nbreath and strength for a long bold cast. The crag beneath her feet was\ntrembling with the power of the flood below, and the white mist from the\ndeep moved slowly, shrouding now, and now revealing, the black gulf and\nits slippery walls. For the last few months Miss Yordas had taken very\nlittle exercise, and seldom tasted the open air; therefore the tumult\nand terror of the place, in the fading of the sky and darkening of the\nearth, got hold of her more than they should have done.\n\nWith the frail in her right hand, poised upon three fingers (for the\nfourth had been broken in her childhood), she planted the sole of her\nleft foot on the brink, and swung herself for the needful cast.\n\nA strong throw was needful to reach the black water that never gave\nup anything: if the bag were dropped in the foaming race, it might\nbe carried back to the heel of the fall. She was proud of her bodily\nstrength, which was almost equal to that of a muscular man, and her long\narm swelled with the vigor of the throw. But just when the weight should\nhave been delivered, and flown with a hiss into the bottomless abyss, a\nloose flag of the handle twisted on her broken finger. Instead of being\nfreed, the bag fell back, struck her in the chest, and threw her back,\nfor the clock weight was a heavy one. Her balance was lost, her feet\nflew up, she fell upon her back, and the smooth beaver cloak began\nsliding upon the slippery rock. Horrible death was pulling at her; not\na stick nor a stone was in reach of her hands, and the pitiless crags\nechoed one long shriek above all the roar of the water-fall. She strove\nto turn over and grasp the ground, but only felt herself going faster.\nHer bright boots were flashing against the white mist--a picture in\nher mind forever--her body was following, inch by inch. With elbow and\nshoulder, and even hair coils, she strove to prolong the descent into\ndeath; but the descent increased its speed, and the sky itself was\nsliding.\n\nJust when the balance was inclining downward, and the plunge hanging on\na hair's-breadth, powerful hands fell upon her shoulders; a grating of a\ndrag against the grain was the last thing she was conscious of; and Sir\nDuncan Yordas, having made a strong pull, at the imminent risk of his\nlife, threw back his weight on the heels of his boots, and they helped\nhim. His long Indian spurs, which had no rowel, held their hold like a\nfalcon's hind talon; and he drew back the lady without knowing who she\nwas, having leaped from his horse at her despairing scream. From his\nknowledge of the place he concluded that it was some person seeking\nsuicide, but recoiling from the sight of death; and without another\nthought he risked his life to save.\n\nBreathless himself--for the transit of years and of curry-powder had not\nimproved his lungs--he labored at the helpless form, and laid it at last\nin a place of safety.\n\n\"What a weight the lady is!\" was his first idea; \"it can not be want of\nfood that has driven her, nor of money either; her cloak would fetch a\nthousand rupees in Calcutta. And a bag full of something--precious also,\nto judge by the way she clings to it. Poor thing! Can I get any water\nfor her? There used to be a spring here, where the woodcocks came. Is\nit safe to leave her? Certainly not, with her head like that; she might\neven have apoplexy. Allow me, madam. I will not steal it. It is only for\na cushion.\"\n\nThe lady, however, though still in a stupor, kept her fingers clinched\nupon the handle of the bag; and without using violence he could not move\nthem. Then the stitching of the frail gave way, and Sir Duncan espied\na roll of parchment. Suddenly the lady opened large dark eyes, which\nwandered a little, and then (as he raised her head) met his, and turned\naway.\n\n\"Philippa!\" he said, and she faintly answered \"Yes,\" being humbled and\nshaken by her deadly terror, and scarcely sure of safety yet, for the\nroar and the chasm were in sight and hearing still.\n\n\"Philippa, are you better? Never mind what you were thinking of. All\nshall be right about that, Philippa. What is land in comparison with\nlife? Look up at me. Don't be afraid to look. Surely you know your only\nbrother! I am Duncan, who ran away, and has lived for years in India.\nI used to be very kind to you when we were children, and why should I\nalter from it now? I remember when you tumbled in the path down there,\nand your knee was bleeding, and I tied it up with a dock leaf and my\nhandkerchief. Can you remember? It was primrose time.\"\n\n\"To be sure I do,\" she said, looking up with cheerfulness; \"and you\ncarried me all the way home almost, and Eliza was dreadfully jealous.\"\n\n\"That she always was, and you not much better. But now we are getting on\nin life, and we need not have much to do with one another. Still, we may\ntry not to kill one another by trumpery squabbles about property. Stay\nwhere you are for a moment, sister, and you shall see the end of that.\"\n\nSir Duncan took the bag, with the deed inside it, returned in three\nsteps to the perilous shelf, and with one strong hurl sent forth the\nload, which cleft the white mist, and sank forever in the waves of the\nwhirlpool.\n\n\"No one can prosecute me for that,\" he said, returning with a smile,\n\"though Mordacks may be much aggrieved. Now, Philippa, although I can\nnot carry you well, from the additions time has made to you, I can help\nyou home, my dear; and then on upon my business.\"\n\nThe pride and self-esteem of Miss Yordas had never been so crushed\nbefore. She put both hands upon her brother's shoulders, and burst into\na flood of tears.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nBUTS REBUTTED\n\n\nSir Duncan Yordas was a man of impulse, as almost every man must be who\nsways the wills of other men. But he had not acted upon mere impulse in\ncasting away his claim to Scargate. He knew that he could never live in\nthat bleak spot, after all his years in India; he disliked the place,\nthrough his father's harshness; he did not care that any son of his, who\nhad lain under charge of a foul crime, and fled instead of meeting it,\nshould become a \"Yordas of Scargate Hall,\" although that description by\nno means involved any very strict equity of conduct. And besides these\nreasons, he had another, which will appear very shortly. But whatever\nthe secondary motives were, it was a large and generous act.\n\nWhen Mrs. Carnaby saw her brother, she was sure that he was come to\nturn her out, and went through a series of states of mind natural to\nan adoring mother with a frail imagination of an appetite--as she\npoetically described it. She was not very swift of apprehension,\nalthough so promptly alive to anything tender, refined, and succulent.\nHaving too strong a sense of duty to be guilty of any generosity, she\ncould not believe, either then or thereafter, that her brother had cast\naway anything at all, except a mere shred of a lawsuit. And without any\nheed of chronology--because (as she justly inquired), what two clocks\nare alike?--she was certain that if he did anything at all to drive off\nthose horrible lawyers from the house, there was no credit due to any\none but Pet. It was the noble way Pet looked at him!\n\nPet, being introduced to his uncle, after dinner, when he came home from\nfishing, certainly did look nobly at him, if a long stare is noble.\nThen he went up to him, with a large and liberal sniff, and an affable\ninquiry, as a little dog goes up to a big one. Sir Duncan was amused,\nhaving heard already some little particulars about this youth, whose\nnature he was able to enter into as none but a Yordas could rightly do.\nHowever, he was bound to make the best of him, and did so; discovering\nnot only room for improvement, but some hope of that room being\noccupied.\n\n\"The boy has been shockingly spoiled,\" he said to his sister Philippa\nthat evening; \"also he is dreadfully ignorant. None of us are very great\nat scholarship, and never have much occasion for it. But things are\nbecoming very different now. Everybody is beginning to be expected to\nknow everything. Very likely, as soon as I am no more wanted, I shall be\nvoted a blockhead. Luckily the wars keep people from being too choice,\nwhen their pick goes every minute. And this may stop the fuss, that\ncomes from Scotland mainly, about universal distribution--or some big\nwords--of education. 'Pet,' as you call him, is a very clever fellow,\nwith much more shape of words about him than ever I was blessed with. In\nspelling I saw that he was my master; and so I tried him with geography,\nand all he knew of India was that it takes its name from India rubber!\"\n\n\"Now I call that clever of him,\" said Miss Yordas; \"for I really might\nhave forgotten even that. But the fatal defect in his education has\nbeen the want of what you grow, chiefly in West India perhaps--the\ncane, Duncan, the sugar-cane. I have read all about it; you can tell me\nnothing. You suck it, you smoke it, and you beat your children with it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Duncan, who was not quite sure, in the face of such\nauthority, \"I disremember; but perhaps they do in some parts, because\nthe country is so large. But it is not the ignorance of Pet I care\nfor--such a fault is natural and unavoidable; and who is there to pick\nholes in it? The boy knows a great deal more than I did at his age,\nbecause he is so much younger. But, Philippa, unless you do something\nwith him, he will never be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Duncan, you are hard. You have seen so much.\"\n\n\"The more we see, the softer we become. The one thing we harden against\nis lying--the seed, the root, and the substance of all vileness. I am\nsorry to say your Pet is a liar.\"\n\n\"He does not always tell the truth, I know. But bear in mind, Duncan,\nthat his mother did not insist--and, in fact, she does not herself\nalways--\"\n\n\"I know it; I am grieved that it should come from our side. I never\ncared for his father much, because he went against me; but this I will\nsay for him, Lance Carnaby would sooner cut his tongue out that put it\nto a lie. When I am at home, my dealings are with fellows who could\nnot speak the truth if they tried for dear life, simply through want\nof practice. They are like your lower class of horse-dealers, but with\ninfinitely more intelligence. It is late to teach poor Pet the first of\nall lessons; and for me to stop to do it is impossible. But will you try\nto save further disgrace to a scapegrace family, but not a mean one?\"\n\n\"I feel it as much as you do--perhaps more,\" Miss Yordas answered,\nforgetting altogether about the deed-box and her antiquary. \"You need\nnot tell me how very sad it is. But how can it be cured? His mother is\nhis mother. She never would part with him; and her health is delicate.\"\n\n\"Stronger than either yours or mine, unless she takes too much\nnourishment. Philippa, her will is mere petulance. For her own good, we\nmust set it aside. And if you agree with me, it can be done. He must go\ninto a marching regiment at once, ordered abroad, with five shillings in\nhis pocket, earn his pay, and live upon it. This patched-up peace will\nnever last six months. The war must be fought out till France goes down,\nor England. I can get him a commission; and I know the colonel, a man of\nmy own sort, who sees things done, instead of talking. It would be the\nmaking of Lancelot. He has plenty of courage, but it has been milched.\nAt Oxford or Cambridge he would do no good, but simply be ruined by\nhaving his own way. Under my friend Colonel Thacker, he will have a hard\ntime of it, and tell no lies.\"\n\nThus it was settled. There was a fearful outcry, hysterics of an elegant\norder, and weepings enough to produce summer spate in the Tees. But the\nonly result was the ordering of the tailor, the hosier, the boot-maker,\nand the scissors-grinder to put a new edge upon Squire Philip's razors,\nthat Pet might practice shaving. \"Cold-blooded cruelty, savage homicide;\ncannibalism itself is kinder,\" said poor Mrs. Carnaby, when she saw the\nrazors; but Pet insisted upon having them, made lather, and practiced\nwith the backs, till he began to understand them.\n\n\"He promises well; I have great hopes of him,\" Sir Duncan said to\nhimself. \"He has pride; and no proud boy can be long a liar. I will go\nand consult my dear old friend Bart.\"\n\nMr. Bart, who was still of good bodily strength, but becoming less\nresolute in mind than of yore, was delighted to see his old friend\nagain; and these two men, having warm, proud hearts, preserved each\nother from self-contempt by looking away through the long hand-clasp.\nFor each of them was to the other almost the only man really respected\nin the world.\n\nBetwixt them such a thing as concealment could not be. The difference in\ntheir present position was a thing to laugh at. Sir Duncan looked up to\nBart as being the maker of his character, and Bart admired Sir Duncan\nas a newer and wiser edition of himself. They dispatched the past in a\ncheery talk; for the face of each was enough to show that it might have\nbeen troublous--as all past is--but had slidden into quiet satisfaction\nnow, and a gentle flow of experience. Then they began to speak of\npresent matters, and the residue of time before them; and among other\nthings, Sir Duncan Yordas spoke of his nephew Lancelot.\n\n\"Lancelot Yordas Carnaby,\" said Bart, with the smile of a gray-beard at\nyoung love's dream, \"has done us the honor to fall in love, for ever and\never, with our little Insie. And the worst of it is that she likes him.\"\n\n\"What an excellent idea!\" his old friend answered; \"I was sure there was\nsomething of that sort going on. Now betwixt love and war we shall make\na man of Pet.\"\n\nAs shortly as possible he told Mr. Bart what his plan about his nephew\nwas, and how he had carried it against maternal, and now must carry\nit against maiden, love. If Lancelot had any good stuff in him, any\nvertebrate embryo of honesty, to be put among men, and upon his mettle\n(with a guardian angel in the distance of sweet home), would stablish\nall the man in him, and stint the beast. Mr. Bart, though he hated hard\nfighting, admitted that for weak people it was needful; and was only too\nhappy so to cut the knot of his own home entanglements with the ruthless\nsword. For a man of liberal education, and much experience in spending\nmoney, who can put a new bottom to his own saucepan, is not the one to\nfeel any despair of his fellow-creatures mending.\n\nThen arose the question, who should bell the cat, or rather, who should\nlead the cat to the belling. Pet must be taken, under strong duress, to\nthe altar--as his poor mother said, and shrieked--whereat he was to shed\nhis darling blood. His heart was in his mouth when his uniform came; and\nhe gave his sacred honor to fly, straight as an arrow, to the port where\nhis regiment was getting into boats; but Sir Duncan shook his grizzled\nhead. \"Somebody must see him into it,\" he said. \"Not a lady; no, no,\nmy dear Eliza. I can not go myself; but it must be a man of rigidity, a\nstern agent. Oh, I know! how stupid of me!\"\n\n\"You mean poor dear Mr. Jellicorse,\" suggested Mrs. Carnaby, with a\nshort hot sob. \"But, Duncan, he has not the heart for it. For anything\nhonest and loyal and good, kind people may trust him with their lives.\nBut to tyranny, rapine, and manslaughter, he never could lend his fine\nhonorable face.\"\n\n\"I mean a man of a very different cast--a man who knows what time is\nworth; a man who is going to be married on a Sunday, that he may not\nlose the day. He has to take three days' holiday, because the lady is an\nheiress; otherwise he might get off with one. But he hopes to be at work\nagain on Wednesday, and we will have him here post-haste from York on\nThursday. It will be the very job to suit him--a gentleman of Roman\nancestry, and of the name of Mordacks.\"\n\n\"My heart was broken already; and now I can feel the poor pieces flying\ninto my brain. Oh, why did I ever have a babe for monsters of the name\nof Mordacks to devour?\"\n\nMordacks was only too glad to come. On the very day after their union,\nCalpurnia (likewise of Roman descent) had exhibited symptoms of a strong\nwill of her own.\n\nMordacks had temporized during their courtship; but now she was his, and\nmust learn the great fact. He behaved very well, and made no attempt at\nreasoning (which would have been a fatal course), but promptly donned\ncloak, boots, and spurs while his horse was being saddled, and then set\noff, with his eyes fixed firmly upon business. A crow could scarcely\nmake less than fifty miles from York to Scargate, and the factor's\ntrusty roadster had to make up his mind to seventy. So great, however,\nis sometimes the centrifugal force of Hymen, that upon the third day Mr.\nMordacks was there, vigorous, vehement, and fit for any business.\n\nWhen he heard what it was, it liked him well; for he bore a fine grudge\nagainst Lancelot for setting the dogs at him three years ago, when he\ncame (as an agent for adjoining property) to the house of Yordas,\nand when Mr. Jellicorse scorned to meet an illegal meddler with legal\nmatters. If Mordacks had any fault--and he must have had some, in spite\nof his resolute conviction to the contrary--it was that he did not\naltogether scorn revenge.\n\nLives there man, or even woman, capable of describing now the miseries,\nthe hardships, the afflictions beyond groaning, which, like electric\nhail, came down upon the sacred head of Pet? He was in the grasp\nof three strong men--his uncle, Mr. Bart, worst of all, that\nMordacks--escape was impossible, lamentation met with laughter, and\npassion led to punishment. Even stern Maunder was sorry for him,\nalthough he despised him for feeling it. The only beam of light, the\nonly spark of pleasure, was his royal uniform; and to know that Insie's\nlaugh thereat was hollow, and would melt away to weeping when he was out\nof sight, together with the sulky curiosity of Maunder, kept him up a\nlittle, in this time of bitter sacrifice.\n\nEnough that he went off, at last, in the claws of that Roman\nhippogriff--as Mrs. Carnaby savagely called poor Mordacks--and the\nvisitor's flag hung half-mast high, and Saracen and the other dogs made\na howling dirge, with such fine hearts (as the poor mother said, between\nher sobs) that they got their dinners upon china plates.\n\nSir Duncan had left before this, and was back under Dr. Upround's\nhospitable roof. He had made up his mind to put his fortune, or rather\nhis own value, to the test, in a place of deep interest to him now, the\nheart of the fair Janetta. He knew that, according to popular view, he\nwas much too old for this young lady; but for popular view he cared not\none doit, if her own had the courage and the will to go against it. For\nyears he had sternly resisted all temptation of second marriage, toward\nwhich shrewd mothers and nice maidens had labored in vain to lead him.\nBut the bitter disappointment about his son, and that long illness, and\nthe tender nursing (added to the tenderness of his own sides, from\nlying upon them, with a hard dry cough), had opened some parts of his\nconstitution to matrimonial propensities. Miss Upround was of a playful\nnature, and teased everybody she cared about; and although Sir Duncan\nwas a great hero to her, she treated him sometimes as if he were her\ndoll. Being a grave man, he liked this, within the bounds of good taste\nand manners; and the young lady always knew where to stop. From being\namused with her, he began to like her; and from liking her, he went on\nto miss her; and from missing her to wanting her was no long step.\n\nHowever, Sir Duncan was not at all inclined to make a fool of himself\nherein. He liked the lady very much, and saw that she would suit him,\nand help him well in the life to which he was thinking of returning. For\nwithin the last fortnight a very high post at Calcutta had been offered\nto him by the powers in Leadenhall Street, upon condition of sailing at\nonce, and foregoing the residue of his leave. If matters had been to his\nliking in England, he certainly would have declined it; but after his\nsad disappointment, and the serious blow to his health, he resolved to\naccept it, and set forth speedily. The time was an interlude of the war,\nand ships need not wait for convoy.\n\nThis had induced him to take his Yorkshire affairs (which Mordacks had\nbeen forced to intermit during his Derbyshire campaign) into his own\nhands, and speed the issue, as above related. And part of his plan was\nto quit all claim to present possession of Scargate; that if the young\nlady should accept his suit, it might not in any way be for the sake of\nthe landed interest. As it happened, he had gone much further than this,\nand cast away his claim entirely, to save his sister from disgrace and\nthe family property from lawyers. And now having sought Dr. Upround's\nleave (which used to be thought the proper thing to do), he asked\nJanetta whether she would have him, and she said, \"No, but he might have\nher.\" Upon this he begged permission to set the many drawbacks before\nher, and she nodded her head, and told him to begin.\n\n\"I am of a Yorkshire family. But, I am sorry to say that their temper is\nbad, and they must have their own way too much.\"\n\n\"But, that suits me; and I understand it. Because I must have my own way\ntoo.\"\n\n\"But, I have parted with my inheritance, and have no place in this\ncountry now.\"\n\n\"But, I am very glad of that. Because I shall be able to go about.\"\n\n\"But, India is a dreadfully hot country; many creatures tease you, and\nyou get tired of almost everything.\"\n\n\"But, that will make it all the more refreshing not to be tired of you,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"But, I have a son as old as you, or older.\"\n\n\"But, you scarcely suppose that I can help that!\"\n\n\"But, my hair is growing gray, and I have great crow's-feet, and\neverybody will begin to say--\"\n\n\"But, I don't believe a word of it, and I won't have it; and I don't\ncare a pin's head what all the world says put together, so long as you\ndon't belong to it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nTRUE LOVE\n\n\nAbout a month after Sir Duncan's marriage, when he and his bride were in\nLondon, with the lady's parents come to help, in the misery of outfit, a\nlittle boy ran through a field of wheat, early in the afternoon, and\nhid himself in a blackthorn hedge to see what was going on at Anerley.\nNothing escaped him, for his eyes were sharp, being of true Danish\nbreed. He saw Captain Anerley trudging up the hill, with a pipe in his\nmouth, to the bean field, where three or four men were enjoying the air,\nwithout any of the greedy gulps produced by too great exertion of the\nmuscles; then he saw the mistress of the house throw wide a lattice, and\nshake out a cloth for the birds, who skipped down from the thatch by\nthe dozen instantly; and then he saw Mary, with a basket and a wooden\nmeasure, going round the corner of the house, and clucking for the fowls\nto rally from their scratching-places. These came zealously, with speed\nof leg and wing, from straw-rick, threshing-floor, double hedge, or\nmixen; and following their tails, the boy slipped through the rick-yard,\nand tossed a note to Mary with a truly Flamburian delivery.\n\nAlthough it was only a small-sized boy, no other than the heir of the\n\"Cod-fish,\" a brighter rose flew into Mary's cheeks than the master-cock\nof all the yard could show upon comb or wattle. Contemptuous of\ntwopence, which Mary felt for, the boy disappeared like a rabbit; and\nthe fowls came and helped themselves to the tail-wheat, while their\nmistress was thinking of her letter. It was short and sweet--at least\nin promise--being no more than these few words: \"Darling, the dike where\nfirst we met, an hour after sunset.\"\n\nMary never doubted that her duty was to go; and at the time appointed\nshe was there, with firm knowledge of her own mind, being now a loving\nand reasonable woman. It was just a year since she had saved the life\nof Robin; and patience, and loneliness, and opposition, had enlarged and\nennobled her true and simple heart. No lord in the land need have looked\nfor a purer or sweeter example of maidenhood than this daughter of a\nYorkshire farmer was, in her simple dress, and with the dignity of love.\nThe glen was beginning to bestrew itself with want of light, instead\nof shadows; and bushy places thickened with the imperceptible growth of\nnight. Mary went on, with excitement deepening, while sunset deepened\ninto dusk; and the color of her clear face flushed and fleeted under the\nanxious touch of love, as the tint of a delicate finger-nail, with any\npressure, varies. But not very long was she left in doubt.\n\n\"How long you have been! And oh, where have you been? And how much\nlonger will you be?\" Among many other words and doings she insisted\nchiefly on these points.\n\n\"I am a true-blue, as you may see, and a warrant-officer already,\" he\nsaid, with his old way of smiling at himself. \"When the war begins again\n(as it must--please God!--before many weeks are over), I shall very\nsoon get my commission, and go up. I am quite fit already to command a\nfrigate.\"\n\nMary was astonished at his modesty; she thought that he ought to be an\nadmiral at least, and so she told him; however, he knew better.\n\n\"You must bear in mind,\" he replied, with a kindly desire to spare\nher feelings, \"that until a change for the better comes, I am under\ndisadvantages. Not only as an outlaw--which has been upon the whole\na comfort--but as a suspected criminal, with warrant against him, and\nreward upon him. Of course I am innocent; and everybody knows it, or at\nleast I hope so, except the one who should have known it best.\"\n\n\"I am the person who should know it best of all,\" his true love\nanswered, with some jealousy. \"Explain yourself, Robin, if you please.\"\n\n\"No Robin, so please you, but Mr. James Blyth, captain of the foretop,\nthen cockswain of the barge, and now master's mate of H. M. ship of the\nline Belleisle. But the one who should have trusted me, next to my own\nlove, is my father, Sir Duncan Yordas.\"\n\n\"How you are talking! You have such a reckless way. A warrant-officer,\nan arrant criminal! And your father, Sir Duncan Yordas, that very\nstrange gentleman, who could never get warm! Oh, Robin, you always did\ntalk nonsense, when--whenever I would let you. But you should not try to\nmake my head go round.\"\n\n\"Every word of it is true,\" the young sailor answered, applying a prompt\nremedy for vertigo. \"It had been clearly proved to his knowledge, long\nbefore the great fact was vouchsafed to me, that I am the only son of\nSir Duncan Yordas, or, at any rate, his only son for the present. The\ndiscovery gratified him so little, that he took speedy measures to\nsupplant me.\"\n\n\"The very rich gentleman from India,\" said Mary, \"that married Miss\nUpround lately; and her dress was all made of spun diamonds, they say,\nas bright as the dew in the morning. Oh, then you will have to give me\nup; Robin, you must give up me!\"\n\nClasping her hands, she looked up at him with courage, keeping down all\nsign of tears. She felt that her heart would not hold out long, and yet\nshe was prouder than to turn away. \"Speak,\" she said; \"it is better to\nspeak plainly; you know that it must be so.\"\n\n\"Do I? why?\" Robin Lyth asked, calmly, being well contented to prolong\nher doubts, that he might get the benefit thereafter.\n\n\"Because you belong to great people, and I am just a farmer's daughter,\nand no more, and quite satisfied to remain so. Such things never\nanswer.\"\n\n\"A little while ago you were above me, weren't you? When I was nobody's\nson, and only a castaway, with a nickname.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it. We must take things exactly as we find\nthem at the time.\"\n\n\"And you took me as you found me at the time; only that you made me out\nso much better. Mary, I am not worthy of you. What has birth to do with\nit? And so far as that goes, yours is better, though mine may seem the\nbrighter. In every other way you are above me. You are good, and I\nam wicked. You are pure, and I am careless. You are sweet, and I am\nviolent. In truth alone can I ever vie with you; and I must be a pitiful\nscoundrel, Mary, if I did not even try to do that, after all that you\nhave done for me.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Mary, with her lovely eyes gleaming with the glittering\nshade of tears, \"I like you very much to do it--but not exactly as a\nduty, Robin.\"\n\n\"You look at me like that, and you talk of duty! Duty, duty; this is my\nduty. I should like to be discharging it forever and a day.\"\n\n\"I did not come here for ideas of this kind,\" said Mary, with her lips\nas red as pyracanthine berries; \"free trade was bad enough, but the\nRoyal Navy worse, it seems. Now, Robin dear, be sensible, and tell me\nwhat I am to do.\"\n\n\"To listen to me, and then say whether I deserve what my father has done\nto me. He came back from India--as you must understand--with no other\nobject in life, that I can hear of (for he had any quantity of money),\nthan to find out me, his only child, and the child of the only wife\nhe ever could put up with. For twenty years he had believed me to be\ndrowned, when the ship he sent me home in to be educated was supposed\nto have foundered, with all hands. But something made him fancy that I\nmight have escaped; and as he could not leave India then, he employed a\ngentleman of York, named Mordacks, to hunt out all about it. Mordacks,\nwho seems to be a wonderful man, and most kind-hearted to everybody,\nas poor Widow Carroway says of him with tears, and as he testifies of\nhimself--he set to work, and found out in no time all about me and my\near-rings, and my crawling from the cave that will bear my name, they\nsay, and more things than I have time to tell. He appointed a meeting\nwith Sir Duncan Yordas here at Flamborough, and would have brought me to\nhim, and everything might have been quite happy. But in the mean while\nthat horrible murder of poor Carroway came to pass, and I was obliged to\ngo into hiding, as no one knows better than you, my dear. My father (as\nI suppose I must call him) being bound, as it seems that they all are,\nto fall out with their children, took a hasty turn against me at once.\nMordacks, whom I saw last week, trusting myself to his honor, tells me\nthat Sir Duncan would not have cared twopence about my free-trade work,\nand so on, or even about my having killed the officer in fair conflict,\nfor he is used to that. But he never will forgive me for absconding, and\nleaving my fellows, as he puts it, to bear the brunt. He says that I am\na dastard and a skulk, and unworthy to bear the name of Yordas.\"\n\n\"What a wicked, unnatural man he must be!\" cried Mary. \"He deserves to\nhave no children.\"\n\n\"No; I am told that he is a very good man, but stiff-necked and\ndisdainful. He regards me with scorn, because he knows no better. He may\nknow our laws, but he knows nothing of our ways, to suppose that my men\nwere in any danger. If I had been caught while the stir was on, a gibbet\non the cliff would have been set up, even before my trial--such is the\nreward of eminence--but no Yorkshire jury would turn round in the box,\nwith those poor fellows before them. 'Not guilty, my lord,' was on their\ntongues, before he had finished charging them.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad! They have been acquitted, and you were there to see\nit!\"\n\n\"To be sure. I was in the court, as Harry Ombler's father. Mr. Mordacks\ngot it up; and it told on the jury even more than could have been\nexpected. Even the judge wiped his eyes as he looked at me, for they say\nhe has a scapegrace son; and Harry was the only one of all the six\nin danger, according to the turn of the evidence. My poor eyes have\nscarcely come round yet from the quantity of sobbing that I had to do,\nand the horrible glare of my goggles. And then I had a crutch that\nI stumped with as I sighed, so that all the court could hear me; and\nwhenever I did it, all the women sighed too, and even the hardest hearts\nwere moved. Mr. Mordacks says that it was capital.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Robin, how shocking, though you make me laugh! If the verdict\nhad been otherwise--oh, what then?\"\n\n\"Well, then, Harry Ombler had a paper in his hand, done in printing\nletters by myself, because he is a very tidy scholar, and signed by me;\nthe which he was to read before receiving sentence, saying that Robin\nLyth himself was in York town, and would surrender to that court upon\ncondition that mercy should be warranted to the prisoners.\"\n\n\"And you would have given yourself up? And without consulting me about\nit!\"\n\n\"Bad, I admit,\" Robin answered, with a smile; \"but not half so bad as\nto give up you--which you calmly proposed just now, dear heart. However,\nthere is no need for any trouble now, except that I am forced to keep\nout of sight until other evidence is procured. Mordacks has taken to me,\nlike a better father, mainly from his paramount love of justice, and of\ndaring gallantry, as he calls it.\"\n\n\"So it was, and ten times more; heroic self-devotion is a much more\nproper term.\"\n\n\"Now don't,\" said Robin. \"If you make me blush, you may guess what I\nshall do to hide it--carry the war into the sweet land of the enemy. But\ntruly, my darling, there was very little danger. And I am up for a much\nbetter joke this time. My august Roman father, who has cast me off,\nsails as a very great Indian gun, in a ship of the line, from Spithead,\nearly in September. The Belleisle is being paid off now, and I have my\ncertificate, as well as lots of money. Next to his lass, every sailor\nloves a spree; and mine, instead of emptying, shall fill the locker.\nWith this disgusting peace on, and no chance of prize-money, and plenty\nin their pockets for a good spell ashore, blue-jackets will be scarce\nwhen Sir Duncan Yordas sails. If I can get a decent berth as a petty\nofficer, off I go for Calcutta, and watch (like the sweet little cherub\nthat sits up aloft) for the safety of my dear papa and mamma, as the\nFrenchmen are teaching us to call them. What do you think of such filial\ndevotion?\"\n\n\"It would be a great deal more than he deserves,\" Mary answered, with\nsweet simplicity. \"But what could you do, if he found out who you are?\"\n\n\"Not the smallest fear of that, my dear. I have never had the honor of\nan introduction. My new step-mother, who might have been my sweetheart\nif I had not seen somebody a hundred times as good, a thousand times as\ngentle, and a million times as lovely--\"\n\n\"Oh, Robin, do leave off such very dreadful stories! I saw her in the\nchurch, and she looked beautiful.\"\n\n\"Fine feathers make fine birds. However, she is well enough in her way;\nand I love her father. But, for all that, she has no business to be my\nstep-mother; and of course it was only the money that did it. She has a\nlittle temper of her own, I can assure you; and I wish Sir Duncan joy of\nher when they get among mosquitoes. But, as I was going to say, the only\nrisk of my being caught is from her sharp eyes. Even of that there is\nnot much danger, for we common sailors need not go within hail of those\ngrandees, unless it comes to boat-work. And even if Miss Janetta--I beg\nher pardon, Lady Yordas--should chance to recognize me, I am sure she\nwould never tell her husband. No, no; she would be too jealous; and for\nfifty other reasons. She is very cunning, let me tell you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried Mary, with a smile of wisdom, \"I hope that I may never\nlive to be a step-mother. The way those poor things get abused--\"\n\n\"You would have more principle, I should hope, than to marry anybody\nafter me. However, I have told you nearly all my news, and in a few\nminutes I must be off. Only two things more. In the first place,\nMordacks has taken a very great fancy to me, and has turned against my\nfather. He and Widow Carroway and I had a long talk after the trial, and\nwe all agreed that the murder was committed by a villain called 'John\nCadman,' a sneak and a skulk, whom I knew well, as one of Carroway's\nown men. Among other things, they chanced to say that Cadman's gun was\nmissing, and that the poor widow can swear to it. I asked if any one had\nsearched for it; and Mordacks said no, it would be hopeless. I told them\nthat if I were only free to show myself and choose my time, I would lay\nmy life upon finding it, if thrown away (as it most likely was) in some\npart of that unlucky cave. Mordacks caught at this idea, and asked me a\nnumber of questions, and took down my answers; for no one else knows the\ncave as I do. I would run all risks myself, and be there to do it, if\ntime suited. But only certain tides will serve, even with the best of\nweather; and there may be no such tide for months--I mean tide, weather,\nand clear water combined, as they must be for the job. Therefore I am\nnot to wait, but go about my other business, and leave this to Mordacks,\nwho loves to be captain of everything. Mr. Mordacks talked of a\ndiving-bell, and some great American inventions; but nothing of the kind\ncan be used there, nor even grappling-irons. The thing must not be heard\nof even, until it has been accomplished. Whatever is done, must be done\nby a man who can swim and dive as I can, and who knows the place almost\nas well. I have told him where to find the man, when the opportunity\ncomes for it; and I have shown my better father, Robin Cockscroft, the\nlikely spot. So now I have nothing more to do with that.\"\n\n\"How wonderfully you can throw off cares!\" his sweetheart answered,\nsoftly. \"But I shall be miserable till I know what happens. Will they\nlet me be there? Because I understand so much about tides, and I can\nhold my tongue.\"\n\n\"That you have shown right well, my Mary; but your own sense will tell\nyou that you could not be there. Now one thing more: here is a ring, not\nworthy--although it is the real stuff--to go upon your precious hand,\nyet allow me to put it on; no, not there; upon your wedding finger. Now\ndo you know what that is for?\"\n\n\"For me, I suppose,\" she answered, blushing with pleasure and\nadmiration; \"but it is too good, too beautiful, too costly.\"\n\n\"Not half good enough. Though, to tell you the truth, it can not be\nmatched easily; any more than you can. But I know where to get those\nthings. Now promise me to wear it, when you think of me; and the one\nhabit will confirm the other. But the more important part is this, and\nthe last thing for me to say to you. Your father still hates my name, I\nfear. Tell him every word I have told you, and perhaps it will bring him\nhalf way round. Sooner or later he must come round; and the only way to\ndo it is to work him slowly. When he sees in how many ways I have been\nwronged, and how beautifully I have borne it all, he will begin to say\nto himself, 'Now this young man may be improving.' But he never will\nsay, 'He hath no need of it.'\"\n\n\"I should rather think not, you conceited Robin, or whatever else I am\nto call you now. But I bargain for one thing--whatever may happen, I\nshall never call you anything else but Robin. It suits you, and you look\nwell with it. Yordas, indeed, or whatever it may be--\"\n\n\"No bargain is valid without a seal,\" etc., etc. In the old but\never-vivid way they went on, until they were forced to part, at the\nvery lips of the house itself, after longing lingerings. The air of\nthe fields was sweet with summer fragrance and the breath of night; the\nworld was ripe with soft repose, whose dreams were hope and happiness;\nand the heaven spread some gentle stars, to show mankind the way to it.\nThen a noble perfume strewed the ambient air with stronger presence, as\nthe farmer, in his shirt sleeves, came, with a clay pipe, and grumbled,\n\"Wherever is our Mary all this time?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nNICHOLAS THE FISH\n\n\n\nFive hundred years ago there was a great Italian swimmer, even greater\nthan our Captain Webb; inasmuch as he had what the wags of the age\nunjustly ascribe to our hero, that is to say, web toes and fingers. This\ncapable man could, if history be true, not only swim for a week without\nceasing (reassuring solid nature now and then by a gulp of live fish),\nbut also could expand his chest so considerably that it held enough air\nfor a day's consumption. Fortified thus, he explored Charybdis and all\nthe Liparic whirlpools, and could have found Cadman's gun anywhere, if\nit had only been there. But at last the sea had its revenge upon him,\nthrough the cruel insistence of his king.\n\nNo man so amphibious has since arisen through the unfathomed tide of\ntime. But a swimmer and diver of great repute was now living not far\nfrom Teesmouth. That is to say, he lived there whenever the state of the\nweather or the time of year stranded him in dry misery. Those who have\nnever come across a man of this description might suppose that he was\nhappy and content at home with his wife and growing family, assuaging\nthe brine in the delightful manner commended by Hero to Leander. But,\nalas! it was not so at all. The temper of the man was very slow to move,\nas generally happens with deep-chested men, and a little girl might\nlead him with her finger on the shore; and he liked to try to smell\nland flowers, which in his opinion were but weeds. But if a man can not\ncontrol his heart, in the very middle of his system, how can he hope to\ncommand his skin, that unscientific frontier of his frame?\n\n\"Nicholas the fish,\" as his neighbors (whenever, by coming ashore, he\nhad such treasures) contemptuously called him, was endowed from his\nbirth with a peculiar skin, and by exercise had improved it. Its virtue\nwas excessive thickness--such as a writer should pray for--protected\nalso by powerful hairiness--largely admired by those with whom it is\nrestricted to the head.\n\nUnhappily for Nicholas, the peremptory poises of nature struck a line\nwith him, and this was his line of flotation. From perpetual usage this\nwas drawn, obliquely indeed, but as definitely as it is upon a ship of\nuniform displacement--a yacht, for instance, or a man-of-war. Below\nthat line scarcely anything could hurt him; but above it he was most\nsensitive, unless he were continually wetted; and the flies, and the\ngnats, and many other plagues of England, with one accord pitched\nupon him, and pitched into him, during his short dry intervals, with a\nbracing sense of saline draught. Also the sun, and the wind, and even\nthe moon, took advantage of him when unwetted.\n\nThis made his dry periods a purgatory to him; and no sooner did he hear\nfrom Mr. Mordacks of a promising job under water than he drew breath\nenough for a ten-fathom dive, and bursting from long despair, made a\ngreat slap at the flies beneath his collar-bone. The sound was like\na drum which two men strike; and his wife, who was devoted to him,\nhastened home from the adjoining parish with a sad presentiment of\nparting. And this was speedily verified; for the champion swimmer and\ndiver set forth that very day for Bempton Warren, where he was to have a\nprivate meeting with the general factor.\n\nNow it was a great mistake to think--as many people at this time did,\nboth in Yorkshire and Derbyshire--that the gulf of connubial cares had\nswallowed the great Roman hero Mordacks. Unarmed, and even without his\ngallant roadster to support him, he had leaped into that Curtian lake,\nand had fought a good fight at the bottom of it. The details are highly\ninteresting, and the chronicle might be useful; but, alas! there is no\nspace left for it. It is enough, and a great thing too, to say that\nhe emerged triumphant, reduced his wife into very good condition, and\nobtained the due mastery of her estates, and lordship of the household.\n\nRefreshed and recruited by the home campaign, and having now a double\nbase for future operations--York city with the fosse of Ouse in the\neast, and Pretorian Hill, Derbyshire, westward--Mordacks returned, with\na smack of lip more dry than amontilladissimo, to the strict embrace of\nbusiness. So far as the needs of the body were concerned, he might have\ndone handsomely without any business; but having no flesh fit to weigh\nagainst his mind, he gave preference to the latter. Now the essence\nof his nature was to take strong views; not hastily--if he could help\nit--nor through narrow aspect of prejudice, but with power of insight\n(right or wrong), and stern fixity thereafter. He had kept his opinion\nabout Sir Duncan Yordas much longer than usual pending, being struck\nwith the fame of the man, and his manner, and generous impulsive nature.\nAll these he still admired, but felt that the mind was far too hasty,\nand, to put it in his own strong way, Sir Duncan (whatever he might be\nin India) had been but a fool in England. Why had he cast away his claim\non Scargate, and foiled the factor's own pet scheme for a great triumph\nover the lawyers? And why condemn his only son, when found with such\nskill and at heavy expense, without even hearing both sides of the tale?\nLast, but not least, what induced him to marry, when amply old enough\nto know better, a girl who might be well enough in her way, but had no\nfamily estate to bring, was shrewdly suspected of a cutting tongue, and\nhad more than once been anything but polite to Geoffrey Mordacks?\n\nAlthough this gentleman was not a lawyer, and indeed bore a tyrannous\nhate against that gentle and most precious class, he shared the\nsolicitor's just abhorrence of the word \"farewell,\" when addressed to\nhim by any one of good substance. He resolved that his attentions should\nnot cease, though undervalued for the moment, but should be continued\nto the son and heir--whose remainder in tail subsisted still, though it\nmight be hard to substantiate--and when his cousin Lancelot should come\ninto possession, he might find a certain factor to grapple him. Mr.\nMordacks hated Lancelot, and had carried out his banishment with intense\nenjoyment, holding him as in a wrench-hammer all the way, silencing his\nsqueaks with another turn of the screw, and as eager to crack him as if\nhe were a nut, the first that turns auburn in September.\n\nThis being the condition of so powerful a mind, facts very speedily\nshaped themselves thereto, as they do when the power of an eminent\norator lays hold of them and crushes them, and they can not even squeak.\nOr even as a still more eminent 'bus driver, when the street is blocked,\nand there seems to be no room for his own thumb, yet (with a gentle\nwhistle and a wink) solves the jostling stir and balk, makes obstructive\ntraffic slide, like an eddy obsequious, beside him and behind, and comes\nforth as the first of an orderly procession toward the public-house of\nhis true love.\n\nNow if anything beyond his own conviction were wanted to set this great\nagent upon action, soon it was found in York Summer Assizes, and\nthe sudden inrush of evidence, which--no matter how a case has been\nprepared--gets pent up always for the Bar and Bench. Then Robin Lyth\ncame, with a gallant dash, and offered himself as a sacrifice, if\nneedful, which proved both his courage and his common-sense in waiting\ntill due occasion demanded him. Mordacks was charmed with this\nyoung man, not only for proving his own judgment right, but also for\npossessing a quickness of decision akin to his own, and backing up his\nown ideas.\n\nWith vigor thus renewed by many interests and motives, the general\nand generous factor kept his appointment in Bempton Warren. Since the\ndistressing, but upon the whole desirable, decease of that poor Rickon\nGoold, the lonely hut in which he breathed his last had not been by any\nmeans a popular resort. There were said to be things heard, seen, and\nfelt, even in the brightest summer day, which commended the spot to the\ncreatures that fear mankind, but not their spectres. The very last of\nall to approach it now would have been the two rollicking tars who\nhad trodden their wooden-legged watch around it. Nicholas the fish was\nsuperstitious also, as it behooved him well to be; but having heard\nnothing of the story of the place, and perceiving no gnats in the\nneighborhood, he thankfully took it for his short dry spells.\n\nMr. Mordacks met him, and the two men were deeply impressed with\none another. The diver admired the sharp, terse style and definite\nexpression of the factor, while the factor enjoyed the large ponderous\nroll and suggestive reservations of the diver. For this was a man who\nhad met great beings, and faced mighty wonders in deep places; and he\nthought of them more than he liked to say, because he had to get his\nliving.\n\nNothing could be settled to a nicety between them, not even as to\npounds, shillings, and pence. For the nature of the job depended wholly\nupon the behavior of the weather; and the weather must be not only at\nits best, but also setting meekly in the right direction at the right\nmoment of big springtide. The diver was afraid that he might ask too\nlittle, and the factor disliked the risk of offering too much, and\npossibly spoiling thereby a noble nature. But each of them realized (to\nsome extent) the honesty of the other, and neither of them meant to be\nunreasonable.\n\n\"Give and take, is what I say,\" said the short man with the monstrous\nchest, looking up at the tall man with the Roman nose; \"live and let\nlive. Ah! that's it.\"\n\nMr. Mordacks would have said, \"Right you are,\" if that elegant\nexpression had been in vogue; but as that brilliance had not yet\nrisen, he was content to say, \"Just so.\" Then he added, \"Here you have\neverything you want. Madam Precious will send you twice a day, to the\nstone at the bottom of the lane, a gallon of beer, and victuals in\nproportion. Your duty is to watch the tides and weather, keep your boat\ngoing, and let me know; and here I am in half an hour.\"\n\nCalpurnia Mordacks was in her duty now, and took her autumn holiday\nat Flamborough. And though Widow Precious felt her heart go pitapat at\nfirst sight of another Mrs. Mordacks, she made up her mind, with a gulp,\nnot to let this cash go to the Thornwick. As a woman she sighed; but as\na landlady she smiled, and had visions of hoisting a flag on her roof.\n\nWhen Mordacks, like a victorious general, conqueror of this Danish town,\nwent forth for his evening stroll to see his subjects and be saluted, a\nhandsome young sailor came up from the cliffs, and begged to have a few\nquiet words with him. \"Say on, my lad; all my words are quiet,\" replied\nthe general factor. Then this young man up and told his tale, which was\nall in the well-trodden track of mankind. He had run away to sea, full\nof glorious dreams--valor, adventure, heroism, rivers of paradise, and\nlands of heaven. Instead of that, he had been hit upon the head, and\nin places of deeper tenderness, frequently roasted, and frozen yet more\noften, basted with brine when he had no skin left, scorched with thirst,\nand devoured by creatures whose appetites grew dainty when his own was\nravening.\n\n\"Excellent youth,\" Mr. Mordacks said, \"your tale might move a heart of\nflint. All who know me have but one opinion. I am benevolence itself.\nBut my balance is low at my banker's.\"\n\n\"I want no money, sir,\" the sailor answered, simply offering benevolence\nitself a pipeful of tobacco from an ancient bit of bladder; \"I have not\ngot a farthing, but I am with good people who never would take it if\nI had it, and that makes everything square between us. I might have a\nhatful of money if I chose, but I find myself better without it, and my\nconstitution braces up. If I only chose to walk a league sou'west, there\nwould be bonfires burning. But I vowed I would go home a captain, and I\nwill.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Mr. Mordacks, with his usual quickness, and now knowing\nall about everybody; \"you are Mr. John Anerley, the son of the famous\nCaptain Anerley.\"\n\n\"Jack Anerley, sir, till better times; and better they never will be,\ntill I make them. But not a word to any one about me, if you please.\nIt would break my mother's heart (for she doth look down upon people,\nwithout asking) to hear that Robin Cockscroft was supporting of me. But,\nbless you, I shall pay him soon, a penny for a guinea.\"\n\nTruth, which struggles through the throng of men to get out and have\na little breath sometimes, now and then succeeds, by accident, or the\nstupid misplacement of a word. A penny for a guinea was as much as Robin\nCockscroft was likely ever to see for his outlay upon this very fine\nyoung fellow. Jack Anerley accepted the situation with the large\nphilosophy of a sailor; and all he wanted from Mr. Mordacks was leave\nto be present at the diving job. This he obtained, as he promised to be\nuseful, and a fourth oar was likely to be needed.\n\nIt was about an hour before noon of a beautifully soft September day,\nwhen little Sam Precious, the same boy that carried Robin Lyth's note to\nMary, came up to Mr. Mordacks with a bit of plaited rushes, the scytale\nof Nicholas the fish, who was happy enough not to know his alphabet. The\nfactor immediately put on his hat, girded himself with his riding sword\nand pistol belt, and told his good wife that business might take him\naway for some hours. Then he hastened to Robin Cockscroft's house, after\nsending the hostler, on his own horse, with a letter to Bridlington\ncoast-guard station, as he had arranged with poor Carroway's successor.\n\nThe Flamborough fishermen were out at sea; and without any fuss, Robin's\nboat was launched, and manned by that veteran himself, together with old\nJoe and Bob, who had long been chewing the quid of expectation, and at\nthe bow oar Jack Anerley. Their orders were to slip quietly round, and\nwait in the Dovecote till the diver came. Mordacks saw them on their\nway; and then he strode up the deserted path, and struck away toward a\nnorthern cove, where the diver's little boat was housed. There he found\nNicholas the fish, spread out in all his glory, like a polypod awash, or\na basking turtle, or a well-fed calf of Proteus. Laid on his back, where\nthe wavelets broke, and beaded a silver fringe upon the golden ruff of\nsand, he gave his body to soft lullaby, and his mind to perfect holiday.\nHis breadth, and the spring of fresh air inside it, kept him gently up\nand down; and his calm enjoyment was enriched by the baffled wrath of\nhis enemies. For flies, of innumerable sorts and sizes, held a hopeless\nbuzz above him, being put upon their mettle to get at him, and perishing\nsweetly in the vain attempt.\n\nWith a grunt of reluctance he awoke to business, swam for his boat, and\nembarking Mr. Mordacks, pulled him across the placid bay to the cave\nwhere his forces were assembled.\n\n\"Let there be no mistake about it,\" the factor shouted from the\nmermaids' shelf, having promised his Calpurnia to keep upon dry land\nwhenever the water permitted him; \"our friend the great diver will first\nascertain whether the thing which we seek is here. If so, he will\nleave it where it is until the arrival of the Preventive boat. You all\nunderstand that we wish to put the matter so that even a lawyer can not\npick any hole in the evidence. Light no links until I tell you. Now,\nNicholas the fish, go down at once.\"\n\nWithout a word the diver plunged, having taken something between his\nteeth which he would not let the others see. The watery floor of the\ncavern was as smooth as a mill-pond in July, and he plunged so neatly\nthat he made no splash; nothing but a flicker of reflection on the roof,\nand a lapping murmur round the sides, gave token that a big man was\ngone into the deep. For several minutes no one spoke, but every eye was\nstrained upon the glassy dimness, and every ear intent for the first\nbreak of sound.\n\n\"T' goop ha' got un,\" cried old Robin, indignant at this outrage by a\nstranger to his caves, \"God niver mahd mon to pree intil 's ain warks.\"\n\nOld Joe and Bob grunted approbation, and Mordacks himself was beginning\nto believe that some dark whirlpool or coil of tangles had drowned the\npoor diver, when a very gentle noise, like a dabchick playing beneath a\nbridge, came from the darkest corner. Nicholas was there, inhaling air,\nnot in greedy gulps and gasps, like a man who has had no practice, but\nleisurely encouraging his lungs with little doses, as a doctor gives\nsoup to a starved boat crew. Being hailed by loud voices, he answered\nnot, for his nature was by no means talkative; but presently, with very\nlittle breach of water, he swam to the middle, and asked for his pipe.\n\n\"Have you found the gun?\" cried Mordacks, whose loftiest feelings had\nsubsided in a quarter of a minute to the business level. Nicholas made\nno reply until the fire of his pipe was established, while he stood in\nthe water quite as if he were on land, supporting himself by nothing\nmore than a gentle movement of his feet, while the glow of the\ntouch-paper lit his round face and yellow leather skull-cap. \"In coorse\nI has,\" he said at last, blowing a roll of smoke along the gleaming\nsurface; \"over to yon little cornder.\"\n\n\"And you can put your hand upon it in a moment?\" The reply was a nod and\nanother roll of smoke. \"Admirable! Now, then, Joe, and Bob the son of\nJoe, do what I told you, while Master Cockscroft and our nimble young\nfriend get the links all ready.\"\n\nThe torches were fixed on the rocky shelf, as they had been upon the\nfatal night; but they were not lit until Joe and his son, sent forth in\nthe smaller boat to watch, came back with news that the Preventive gig\nwas round the point, and approaching swiftly, with a lady in the stern,\nwhose dress was black.\n\n\"Right!\" cried Mr. Mordacks, with a brisk voice ringing under the\nponderous brows of rock. \"Men, I have brought you to receive a lesson.\nYou shall see what comes of murder. Light the torches. Nicholas, go\nunder, with the exception of your nose, or whatever it is you breathe\nwith. When I lift my hand, go down; and do as I have ordered you.\"\n\nThe cavern was lit with the flare of fire, and the dark still water\nheaved with it, when the coast-guard boat came gliding in. The crew, in\nwhite jerseys, looked like ghosts flitting into some magic scene. Only\nthe officer, darkly clad, and standing up with the tiller-lines in hand,\nand the figure of a woman sitting in the stern, relieved their spectral\nwhiteness.\n\n\"Commander Hardlock, and men of the coastguard,\" shouted Mr. Mordacks,\nwhen the wash of ripples and the drip of oars and the creak of wood gave\nsilence, \"the black crime committed upon this spot shall no longer\ngo unpunished. The ocean itself has yielded its dark secret to the\nperseverance of mankind, and the humble but not unskillful efforts which\nit has been my privilege to conduct. A good man was slain here, in\ncold blood slain--a man of remarkable capacity and zeal, gallantry,\ndiscipline, and every noble quality, and the father of a very large\nfamily. The villain who slew him would have slain six other harmless\nmen by perjury if an enlightened English jury had been fools enough to\nbelieve him. Now I will show you what to believe. I am not eloquent, I\nam not a man of words; my motto is strict business. And business with me\nis a power, not a name. I lift my hand; you wait for half a minute; and\nthen, from the depths of this abyss, arises the gun used in the murder.\"\n\nThe men understood about half of this, being honest fellows in the main,\nand desiring time to put heads together about the meaning; but one there\nwas who knew too well that his treacherous sin had found him out. He\nstrove to look like the rest, but felt that his eyes obeyed heart more\nthan brain; and then the widow, who had watched him closely through her\nblack veil, lifted it, and fixed her eyes on his. Deadly terror seized\nhim, and he wished that he had shot himself.\n\n\"Stand up, men,\" the commander shouted, \"until we see the end of this.\nThe crime has been laid upon our force. We scorn the charge of such\ntreachery. Stand up, men, and face, like innocent men, whatever can be\nshown against you.\"\n\nThe men stood up, and the light of the torches fell upon their faces.\nAll were pale with fear and wonder, but one was white as death itself.\nCalling up his dogged courage, and that bitterness of malice which had\nmade him do the deed, and never yet repent of it, he stood as firmly as\nthe rest, but differed from them in three things. His face wore a smile;\nhe watched one place only; and his breath made a noise, while theirs was\nheld.\n\nThen, from the water, without a word, or sign of any hand that moved\nit, a long gun rose before John Cadman, and the butt was offered to his\nhand. He stood with his arms at his sides, and could not lift them to\ndo anything. Neither could he speak, nor make defense, but stood like an\nimage that is fastened by the feet.\n\n\"Hand me that,\" cried the officer, sharply; but instead of obeying, the\nman stared malignantly, and then plunged over the gun into the depth.\n\nNot so, however, did he cheat the hangman; Nicholas caught him (as a\nwater-dog catches a worn-out glove), and gave him to any one that would\nhave him. \"Strap him tight,\" the captain cried; and the men found relief\nin doing it. At the next jail-delivery he was tried, and the jury did\ntheir duty. His execution restored good-will, and revived that faith in\njustice which subsists upon so little food.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nIN THE THICK OF IT\n\n\nOne of the greatest days in all the history of England, having no sense\nof its future fame, and being upon a hostile coast, was shining rather\ndismally. And one of England's greatest men, the greatest of all her\nsons in battle--though few of them have been small at that--was out of\nhis usual mood, and full of calm presentiment and gloomy joy. He knew\nthat he would see the sun no more; yet his fear was not of that, but\nonly of losing the light of duty. As long as the sun endures, he shall\nnever see duty done more brilliantly.\n\nThe wind was dropping, to give the storm of human fury leisure; and\nwhile a sullen swell was rolling, canvas flapped and timbers creaked.\nLike a team of mallards in double column, plunging and lifting buoyant\nbreasts to right and left alternately, the British fleet bore down upon\nthe swan-like crescent of the foe. These were doing their best to fly,\nbut failing of that luck, put helm alee, and shivered in the wind, and\nmade fine speeches, proving that they must win the day.\n\n\"For this I have lived, and for this it would be worth my while to die,\nhaving no one left, I dare say now, in all the world to care for me.\"\n\nThus spake the junior lieutenant of that British ship, the Victory--a\nyoung man after the heart of Nelson, and gazing now on Nelson's face.\nNo smarter sailor could be found in all that noble fleet than this\nLieutenant Blyth, who once had been the captain of all smugglers. He had\nfought his way up by skill, and spirit, and patience, and good temper,\nand the precious gift of self-reliance, failing of which all merit\nfails. He had always thought well of himself, but never destroyed the\ngood of it by saying so; and whoever praised him had to do it again, to\noutspeak his modesty. But without good fortune all these merits would\nnever have been successes. One of Robin's truest merits was that he\ngenerally earned good luck.\n\nHowever, his spirits were not in their usual flow of jocundity just now,\nand his lively face was dashed with care. Not through fear of lead, or\nsteel, or wooden splinter, or a knock upon the head, or any other human\nmode of encouraging humanity. He hoped to keep out of the way of these,\nas even the greatest heroes do; for how could the world get on if all\nits bravest men went foremost? His mind meant clearly, and with trust\nin proper Providence, to remain in its present bodily surroundings, with\nwhich it had no fault to find. Grief, however--so far as a man having\nfaith in his luck admits that point--certainly was making some little\nhole into a heart of corky fibre. For Robin Lyth had heard last night,\nwhen a schooner joined the fleet with letters, that Mary Anerley at last\nwas going to marry Harry Tanfield. He told himself over and over again\nthat if it were so, the fault was his own, because he had not taken\nproper care about the safe dispatch of letters. Changing from ship to\nship and from sea to sea for the last two years or more, he had found\nbut few opportunities of writing, and even of those he had not made the\nutmost. To Mary herself he had never once written, knowing well that her\nfather forbade it, while his letters to Flamborough had been few, and\nsome of those few had miscarried. For the French had a very clever knack\njust now of catching the English dispatch-boats, in most of which they\nfound accounts of their own thrashings, as a listener catches bad news\nof himself. But none of these led them to improve their conduct.\n\nFlamborough (having felt certain that Robin could never exist without\nfree trade, and missing many little courtesies that flowed from his\nliberal administration), was only too ready to lament his death,\nwithout insisting on particulars. Even as a man who has foretold a very\ndestructive gale of wind tempers with the pride of truth the sorrow\nwhich he ought to feel for his domestic chimney-pots (as soon as he\nfinds them upon his lawn), so Little Denmark, while bewailing, accepted\nthe loss as a compliment to its own renowned sagacity.\n\nBut Robin knew not until last night that he was made dead at\nFlamborough, through the wreck of a ship which he had quitted a month\nbefore she was cast away. And now at last he only heard that news by\nmeans of his shipmate, Jack Anerley. Jack was a thorough-going sailor\nnow, easy, and childish, and full of the present, leaving the past to\ncure and the future to care for itself as might be. He had promised Mr.\nMordacks and Robin Cockscroft to find out Robin Lyth, and tell him all\nabout the conviction of John Cadman; and knowing his name in the navy\nand that of his ship, he had done so after in-and-out chase. But there\nfor the time he had rested from his labors, and left \"Davy Jones\" to\nsend back word about it; which that Pelagian Davy fails to do, unless\nthe message is enshrined in a bottle, for which he seems to cherish true\nnaval regard.\n\nIn this state of things the two brothers-in-law--as they fully intended\nto be by-and-by--were going into this tremendous battle: Jack as a petty\nofficer, and Robin as a junior lieutenant of Lord Nelson's ship. Already\nhad Jack Anerley begun to feel for Robin--or Lieutenant Blyth, as he now\nwas called--that liking of admiration which his clear free manner, and\nquickness of resource, and agreeable smile in the teeth of peril, had\nwon for him before he had the legal right to fight much. And\nRobin--as he shall still be called while the memory of Flamborough\nendures--regarded Jack Anerley with fatherly affection, and hoped to put\nstrength into his character.\n\nHowever, one necessary step toward that is to keep the character\nsurviving; and in the world's pell-mell now beginning, the uproar alone\nwas enough to kill some, and the smoke sufficient to choke the rest.\nMany a British sailor who, by the mercy of Providence, survived that\nday, never could hear a word concerning any other battle (even though\na son of his own delivered it down a trumpet), so furious was the\nconcussion of the air, the din of roaring metal, and the clash of\ncannon-balls which met in the air, and split up into founts of iron.\n\nNo less than seven French and Spanish ships agreed with one accord to\nfall upon and destroy Lord Nelson's ship. And if they had only adopted\na rational mode of doing it, and shot straight, they could hardly have\nhelped succeeding. Even as it was, they succeeded far too well; for they\nmanaged to make England rue the tidings of her greatest victory.\n\nIn the storm and whirl and flame of battle, when shot flew as close as\nthe teeth of a hay-rake, and fire blazed into furious eyes, and then\nwith a blow was quenched forever, and raging men flew into pieces--some\nof which killed their dearest friends--who was he that could do more\nthan attend to his own business? Nelson had known that it would be so,\nand had twice enjoined it in his orders; and when he was carried down to\ndie, his dying mind was still on this. Robin Lyth was close to him when\nhe fell, and helped to bear him to his plank of death, and came back\nwith orders not to speak, but work.\n\nThen ensued that crowning effort of misplaced audacity--the attempt to\nboard and carry by storm the ship that still was Nelson's. The captain\nof the Redoubtable saw through an alley of light, between walls of\nsmoke, that the quarter-deck of the Victory had plenty of corpses, but\nscarcely a life upon it. Also he felt (from the comfort to his feet,\nand the increasing firmness of his spinal column) that the heavy British\nguns upon the lower decks had ceased to throb and thunder into his\nown poor ship. With a bound of high spirits he leaped to a pleasing\nconclusion, and shouted, \"Forward, my brave sons; we will take the\nvessel of war of that Nielson!\"\n\nThis, however, proved to be beyond his power, partly through the\ninborn absurdity of the thing, and partly, no doubt, through the quick\nperception and former vocation of Robin Lyth. What would England have\nsaid if her greatest hero had breathed his last in French arms, and a\ncaptive to the Frenchman? Could Nelson himself have departed thus to a\nworld in which he never could have put the matter straight? The wrong\nwould have been redressed very smartly here, but perhaps outside his\nknowledge. Even to dream of it awakes a shudder; yet outrages almost as\ngreat have triumphed, and nothing is quite beyond the irony of fate.\n\nBut if free trade can not be shown as yet to have won for our country\nany other blessing, it has earned the last atom of our patience and\nfortitude by its indirect benevolence at this great time. Without free\ntrade--in its sweeter and more innocent maidenhood of smuggling--there\nnever could have been on board that English ship the Victory, a man,\nunless he were a runagate, with a mind of such laxity as to understand\nFrench. But Robin Lyth caught the French captain's words, and with two\nbounds, and a holloa, called up Britons from below. By this time a swarm\nof brave Frenchmen was gathered in the mizzen-chains and gangways\nof their ship, waiting for a lift of the sea to launch them into the\nEnglish outworks. And scarcely a dozen Englishmen were alive within hail\nto encounter them. Not even an officer, till Robin Lyth returned, was\nthere to take command of them. The foremost and readiest there was Jack\nAnerley, with a boarder's pike, and a brace of ship pistols, and his\nfine ruddy face screwed up as firm as his father's, before a big sale of\nwheat \"Come on, you froggies; we are ready for you,\" he shouted, as if\nhe had a hundred men in ambush.\n\nThey, for their part, failed to enter into the niceties of his\nlanguage--which difficulty somehow used never to be felt among classic\nwarriors--yet from his manner and position they made out that he offered\nlet and hinderance. To remove him from their course, they began to load\nguns, or to look about for loaded ones, postponing their advance until\nhe should cease to interfere, so clear at that time was the Gallic\nperception of an English sailor's fortitude. Seeing this to be so, Jack\n(whose mind was not well balanced) threw a powder-case amongst them, and\nexhibited a dance. But this was cut short by a hand-grenade, and, before\nhe had time to recover from that, the deck within a yard of his head\nflew open, and a stunning crash went by.\n\nPoor Jack Anerley lay quite senseless, while ten or twelve men (who\nwere rushing up, to repel the enemy) fell and died in a hurricane of\nsplinters. A heavy round shot, fired up from the enemy's main-deck, had\nshattered all before it; and Jack might thank the grenade that he lay\non his back while the havoc swept over. Still, his peril was hot, for a\nvolley of musketry whistled and rang around him; and at least a hundred\nand fifty men were watching their time to leap down on him.\n\nEverything now looked as bad as could be, with the drifting of the\nsmoke, and the flare of fire, and the pelting of bullets, and of grapnel\nfrom coehorns, and the screams of Frenchmen exulting vastly, with\nscarcely any Englishmen to stop them. It seemed as if they were to do as\nthey pleased, level the bulwarks of English rights, and cover themselves\nwith more glory than ever. But while they yet waited to give one more\nscream, a very different sound arose. Powder, and metal, and crash\nof timber, and even French and Spanish throats at their very highest\npressure, were of no avail against the onward vigor and power of an\nEnglish cheer. This cheer had a very fine effect. Out of their own\nmouths the foreigners at once were convicted of inferior stuff, and\ntheir two twelve-pounders crammed with grapnel, which ought to have\nscattered mortality, banged upward, as harmless as a pod discharging\nseed.\n\nIn no account of this great conflict is any precision observed\nconcerning the pell-mell and fisticuff parts of it. The worst of it is\nthat on such occasions almost everybody who was there enlarges his own\nshare of it; and although reflection ought to curb this inclination, it\nseems to do quite the contrary. This may be the reason why nobody as yet\n(except Mary Anerley and Flamborough folk) seems even to have tried to\nassign fair importance to Robin Lyth's share in this glorious encounter.\nIt is now too late to strive against the tide of fortuitous clamor,\nwhose deposit is called history. Enough that this Englishman came up,\nwith fifty more behind him, and carried all before him, as he was bound\nto do.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nMARY LYTH\n\n\nConquests, triumphs, and slaughterous glory are not very nice till they\nhave ceased to drip. After that extinction of the war upon the waves,\nthe nation which had won the fight went into general mourning. Sorrow,\nas deep as a maiden's is at the death of her lover, spread over the\nland; and people who had married their romance away, and fathered off\ntheir enthusiasm, abandoned themselves to even deeper anguish at the\ninsecurity of property. So deeply had England's faith been anchored\ninto the tenacity of Nelson. The fall of the funds when the victory was\nannounced outspoke a thousand monuments.\n\nFrom sires and grandsires Englishmen have learned the mood into which\ntheir country fell. To have fought under Nelson in his last fight was a\npassword to the right hands of men, and into the hearts of women. Even\na man who had never been known to change his mind began to condemn\nother people for being obstinate. Farmer Anerley went to church in his\nFencible accoutrements, with a sash of heavy crape, upon the first day\nof the Christian year. To prove the largeness of his mind, he harnessed\nthe white-nosed horse, and drove his family away from his own parish, to\nSt. Oswald's Church at Flamborough, where Dr. Upround was to preach upon\nthe death of Nelson. This sermon was of the noblest order, eloquent,\nspirited, theological, and yet so thoroughly practical, that seven\nFlamborough boys set off on Monday to destroy French ships of war. Mary\ndid her very utmost not to cry--for she wanted so particularly to watch\nher father--but nature and the doctor were too many for her. And when he\ncame to speak of the distinguished part played (under Providence) by a\ngallant son of Flamborough, who, after enduring with manly silence evil\nreport and unprecious balms, stood forward in the breach, like Phineas,\nand, with the sword of Gideon, defied Philistia to enter the British\nark; and when he went on to say that but for Flamborough's prowess on\nthat day, and the valor of the adjoining parish (which had also supplied\na hero), England might be mourning her foremost [Greek word], her very\ngreatest fighter in the van, without the consolation of burying him, and\nembalming him in a nation's tears--for the French might have fired\nthe magazine--and when he proceeded to ask who it was that (under the\nguiding of a gracious hand) had shattered the devices of the enemy, up\nstood Robin Cockscroft, with a score of equally ancient captains,\nand remembering where they were, touched their forelocks, and\nanswered--\"Robin Lyth, sir!\"\n\nThen Mary permitted the pride of her heart, which had long been painful\nwith the tight control, to escape in a sob, which her mother had\nforeseen; and pulling out the stopper from her smelling-bottle, Mistress\nAnerley looked at her husband as if he were Bonaparte himself.\nHe, though aware that it was inconsistent of her, felt (as he said\nafterward) as if he had been a Frenchman; and looked for his hat, and\nfumbled about for the button of the pew, to get out of it. But luckily\nthe clerk, with great presence of mind, awoke, and believing the sermon\nto be over, from the number of men who were standing up, pronounced\n\"Amen\" decisively.\n\nDuring the whole of the homeward drive Farmer Anerley's countenance was\nfull of thought; but he knew that it was watched, and he did not choose\nto let people get in front of him with his own brains. Therefore he let\nhis wife and daughter look at him, to their hearts' content, while he\nlooked at the ledges, and the mud, and the ears of his horse, and the\nweather; and he only made two observations of moment, one of which was\n\"gee!\" and the other was \"whoa!\"\n\nWith females jolting up and down, upon no springs--except those of\njerksome curiosity--conduct of this character was rude in the extreme.\nBut knowing what he was, they glanced at one another, not meaning in any\nsort of way to blame him, but only that he would be better by-and-by,\nand perhaps try to make amends handsomely. And this, beyond any denial,\nhe did as soon as he had dined, and smoked his pipe on the butt of the\ntree by the rick-yard. Nobody knew where he kept his money, or at least\nhis good wife always said so, when any one made bold to ask her. And\neven now he was right down careful to go to his pot without anybody\nwatching; so that when he came into the Sunday parlor there was not one\nof them who could say, even at a guess, where he last had been.\n\nMaster Simon Popplewell, gentleman-tanner (called out of his name, and\ninto the name of \"Johnny,\" even by his own wife, because there was no\nsign of any Simon in him), he was there, and his good wife Debby, and\nMistress Anerley in her best cap, and Mary, dressed in royal navy blue,\nwith bars of black (for Lord Nelson's sake), according to the kind gift\nof aunt and uncle; also Willie, looking wonderfully handsome, though\npale with the failure of \"perpetual motion,\" and inclined to be languid,\nas great genius should be in its intervals of activity. Among them a\nlively talk was stirring; and the farmer said, \"Ah! You was talking\nabout me.\"\n\n\"We mought be; and yet again we mought not,\" Master Popplewell returned,\nwith a glance at Mrs. Deborah, who had just been describing to the\ncompany how much her husband excelled in jokesomeness. \"Brother Stephen,\na good man seeks to be spoken of, and a bad one objects to it, in vain.\"\n\n\"Very well. You shall have something for your money. Mary, you know\nwhere the old Mydeary wine is that come from your godfathers and\ngodmothers when you was called in baptism. Take you the key from your\nmother, child, and bring you up a bottle, and brother Popplewell will\nopen it, for such things is beyond me.\"\n\n\"Well done, our side!\" exclaimed the tanner; for if he had a weakness it\nwas for Madeira, which he always declared to have a musky smack of tan;\nand a waggish customer had told him once that the grapes it was made\nof were always tanned first. The others kept silence, foreseeing great\nevents.\n\nThen Mr. Popplewell, poised with calm discretion, and moving with the\nnice precision of a fine watchmaker, shed into the best decanter (softly\nas an angel's tears) liquid beauty, not too gaudy, not too sparkling\nwith shallow light, not too ruddy with sullen glow, but vivid--like a\nnoble gem, a brown cairngorm--with mellow depth of lustre. \"That's your\nsort!\" the tanner cried, after putting his tongue, while his wife looked\nshocked, to the lip of the empty bottle.\n\n\"Such things is beyond my knowledge,\" answered Farmer Anerley, as soon\nas he saw the best glasses filled; \"but nothing in nature is too good to\nspeak a good man's health in. Now fill you up a little glass for Mary;\nand, Perpetual Motion, you stand up, which is more than your machines\ncan do. Now here I stand, and I drink good health to a man as I never\nclapped eyes on yet, and would have preferred to keep the door between\nus; but the Lord hath ordered otherwise. He hath wiped out all his\nfaults against the law; he hath fought for the honor of old England\nwell; and he hath saved the life of my son Jack. Spite of all that, I\nmight refuse to unspeak my words, which I never did afore, if it had not\nbeen that I wronged the man. I have wronged the young fellow, and I am\nman enough to say so. I called him a murderer and a sneak, and time hath\nproved me to have been a liar. Therefore I ask his pardon humbly; and,\nwhat will be more to his liking, perhaps, I say that he shall have my\ndaughter Mary, if she abides agreeable. And I put down these here twenty\nguineas, for Mary to look as she ought to look. She hath been a good\nlass, and hath borne with me better than one in a thousand would have\ndone. Mary, my love to you; and with leave all round, here's the very\ngood health of Robin Lyth!\"\n\n\"Here's the health of Robin Lyth!\" shouted Mr. Popplewell, with his fat\ncheeks shining merrily. \"Hurrah for the lad who saved Nelson's death\nfrom a Frenchman's grins, and saved our Jack boy! Stephen Anerley, I\nforgive you. This is the right stuff, and no mistake. Deborah, come and\nkiss the farmer.\"\n\nMrs. Popplewell obeyed her husband, as the manner of good wives is. And\nover and above this fleeting joy, solid satisfaction entered into noble\nhearts, which felt that now the fruit of laborious years, and the cash\nof many a tanning season, should never depart from the family. And to\nmake an end of any weak misgivings, even before the ladies went--to fill\nthe pipes for the gentlemen--the tanner drew with equal care, and\neven better nerve, the second bottle's cork, and expressed himself as\nfollows:\n\n\"Brother Steve hath done the right thing. We hardly expected it of\nhim, by rights of his confounded stubbornness. But when a shut-up man\nrepenteth, he is equal to a hoyster, or this here bottle. What good\nwould this 'a been without it was sealed over? Now mark my words. I'll\nnot be behind no man when it comes to the right side up. I may be a\npoor man, a very poor man; and people counting otherwise might find\nthemselves mistaken. I likes to be liked for myself only. But the day\nour Mary goes to church with Robin Lyth she shall have 500 pounds tied\nupon her back, or else my name's not Popplewell.\"\n\nMary had left the room long ago, after giving her father a gentle kiss,\nand whispering to Willie that he should have half of her twenty guineas\nfor inventing things; which is a most expensive process, and should be\nmore highly encouraged. Therefore she could not express at the moment\nher gratitude to Squire Popplewell; but as soon as she heard of his\ngenerosity, it lifted a great weight off her mind, and enabled her to\nthink about furnishing a cottage. But she never told even her mother of\nthat. Perhaps Robin might have seen some one he liked better. Perhaps he\nmight have heard that stupid story about her having taken up with poor\nHarry Tanfield; and that might have driven him to wed a foreign lady,\nand therefore to fight so desperately. None, however, of these perhapses\nwent very deeply into her heart, which was equally trusting and trusty.\n\nNow some of her confidence in the future was justified that very moment\nalmost, by a sudden and great arrival, not of Jack Anerley and Robin\nLyth (who were known to be coming home together), but of a gentleman\nwhose skill and activity deserved all thanks for every good thing that\nhad happened.\n\n\"Well! I am in the very nick of time. It is my nature,\" cried Mr.\nMordacks, seated in the best chair by the fire. \"Why? you inquire, with\nyour native penetration. Simply because in very early days I acquired\nthe habit of punctuality. This holding good where an appointment is,\nholds good afterward, from the force of habit, in matters that are of\nluck alone. The needle-eye of time gets accustomed to be hit, and\nturns itself up, without waiting for the clew. Wonderful Madeira! Well,\nCaptain Anerley, no wonder that you have discouraged free trade with\nyour cellars full of this! It is twenty years since I have tasted such\nwine. Mistress Anerley, I have the honor of quaffing this glass to\nyour very best health, and that of a very charming young lady, who has\nhitherto failed to appreciate me.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I am here to beg your pardon,\" said Mary, coming up, with\na beautiful blush. \"When I saw you first I did not enter into\nyour--your--\"\n\n\"My outspoken manner and short business style. But I hope that you have\ncome to like me better. All good persons do, when they come to know me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I was quite ashamed of myself, when I came to learn all that\nyou have done for somebody, and your wonderful kindness at Bridlington.\"\n\n\"Famously said! You inherit from your mother the power and the charm of\nexpression. And now, my dear lady, good Mistress Anerley, I shall undo\nall my great merits by showing that I am like the letter-writers, who\nnever write until they have need of something. Captain Anerley, it\nconcerns you also, as a military man, and loyal soldier of King George.\nA gallant young officer (highly distinguished in his own way, and very\nlikely to get on, in virtue of high connection) became of age some few\nweeks back; and being the heir to large estates, determined to entail\nthem. I speak as in a parable. My meaning is one which the ladies will\ngracefully enter into. Being a large heir, he is not selfish, but would\nfain share his blessings with a little one. In a word, he is to marry a\nvery beautiful young lady to-morrow, and under my agency. But he has\na very delightful mother, and an aunt of a lofty and commanding mind,\nwhose views, however, are comparatively narrow. For a hasty, brief\nseason, they will be wroth; and it would be unjust to be angry with\nthem. But love's indignation is soon cured by absence, and tones down\nrapidly into desire to know how the sinner is getting on. In the present\ncase, a fortnight will do the business; or if for a month, so much the\nbetter. Heroes are in demand just now; and this young gentleman took\nsuch a scare in his very first fight that he became a hero, and so has\nbehaved himself ever since. Ladies, I am astonished at your goodness in\nnot interrupting me. Your minds must be as practical as my own. Now this\nlovely young pair, being married to-morrow, will have to go hunting for\nthe honey in the moon, to which such enterprises lead.\"\n\n\"Sir, you are very right,\" Squire Popplewell replied; and, \"That is\nBible truth,\" said the farmer.\n\n\"Our minds are enlarged by experience,\" resumed the genial factor,\npleasantly, and bowing to the ladies, who declined to say a word until\na better opportunity, \"and we like to see the process going on with\nothers. But a nest must be found for these young doves--a quiet one, a\nsimple one, a place where they may learn to put up with one another's\ncookery. The secret of happiness in this world is not to be too\nparticular. I have hit upon the very place to make them thankful\nby-and-by, when they come to look back upon it--a sweet little hole,\nhalf a league away from anybody. All is arranged--a frying-pan, a\nbrown-ware tea-pot, a skin of lard, a cock and a hen, to lay some eggs;\na hundredweight of ship biscuits, warranted free from weevil, and a\nknife and fork. Also a way to the sea, and a net, for them to\nfish together. Nothing more delightful can be imagined. Under such\ncircumstances, they will settle, in three days, which is to be\nthe master--which I take to be the most important of all marriage\nsettlements. And, unless I am very much mistaken, it will be the right\none--the lady. My little heroine, Jerry Carroway, is engaged as their\nfactotum, and every auspice is favorable. But without your consent, all\nis knocked on the head; for the cottage is yours, and the tenant won't\ngo out, even under temptation of five guineas, without your written\norder. Mistress Anerley, I appeal to you. Captain, say nothing. This is\na lady's question.\"\n\n\"Then I like to have a little voice sometimes, though it is not often\nthat I get it. And, Mr. Mordacks, I say 'Yes.' And out of the five\nguineas we shall get our rent, or some of it, perhaps, from Poacher Tim,\nwho owes us nigh upon two years now.\"\n\nThe farmer smiled at his wife's good thrift, and, being in a pleasant\nmood, consented, if so be the law could not be brought against him, and\nif the young couple would not stop too long, or have any family to\nfall upon the rates. The factor assured him against all evils; and then\ncreated quite a brisk sensation by telling them, in strict confidence,\nthat the young officer was one Lancelot Yordas, own first cousin to the\nfamous Robin Lyth, and nephew to Sir Duncan Yordas. And the lady was the\ndaughter of Sir Duncan's oldest friend, the very one whose name he had\ngiven to his son. Wonder never ceased among them, when they thought how\nthings came round.\n\nThings came round not only thus, but also even better afterward.\nMordacks had a very beautiful revenge of laughter at old Jellicorse, by\noutstripping him vastly in the family affairs. But Mr. Jellicorse did\nnot care, so long as he still had eleven boxes left of title-deeds to\nScargate Hall, no liability about the twelfth, and a very fair prospect\nof a lawsuit yet for the multiplication of the legal race. And meeting\nMr. Mordacks in the highest legal circles, at Proctor Brigant's, in\nCrypt Court, York, he acknowledged that he never met a more delightful\ngentleman, until he found out what his name was. And even then he\noffered him a pinch of snuff, and they shook hands very warmly without\nanything to pay.\n\nWhen Robin Lyth came home he was dissatisfied at first--so difficult is\nmankind to please--because his good luck had been too good. No scratch\nof steel, no permanent scorch of powder, was upon him, and England was\nnot in the mood to value any unwounded valor. But even here his good\nluck stood him in strong stead, and cured his wrong. For when the body\nof the lamented hero arrived at Spithead, in spirits of wine, early in\nDecember, it was found that the Admiralty had failed to send down any\norders about it. Reports, however, were current of some intention that\nthe hero should lie in state, and the battered ship went on with him.\nAnd when at last proper care was shown, and the relics of one of the\nnoblest men that ever lived upon the tide of time were being transferred\nto a yacht at the Nore, Robin Lyth, in a sad and angry mood, neglected\nto give a wide berth to a gun that was helping to keep up the mourning\nsalute, and a piece of wad carried off his starboard whisker.\n\nThis at once replaced him in the popular esteem, and enabled him to\nland upon the Yorkshire coast with a certainty of glorious welcome. Mr.\nMordacks himself came down to meet him at the Northern Landing, with Dr.\nUpround and Robin Cockscroft, and nearly all the men, and entirely\nall the women and children, of Little Denmark. Strangers also from\noutlandish parts, Squire Popplewell and his wife Deborah, Mrs. Carroway\n(with her Tom, and Jerry, and Cissy, and lesser Carroways, for her old\naunt Jane was gone to Paradise at last, and had left her enough to keep\na pony-carriage), and a great many others, and especially a group of\nfour distinguished persons, who stood at the top of the slide, because\nof the trouble of getting back if they went down.\n\nThese had a fair and double-horsed carriage in the lane, at the spot\nwhere fish face their last tribunal; and scarcely any brains but those\nof Flamborough could have absorbed such a spectacle as this, together\nwith the deeper expectations from the sea. Of these four persons, two\nwere young enough, and two not so young as they had been, but still very\nlively, and well pleased with one another. These were Mrs. Carnaby and\nMr. Bart; the pet of the one had united his lot with the darling of the\nother; for good or for bad, there was no getting out of it, and the only\nthing was to make the best of it. And being good people, they were doing\nthis successfully. Poor Mrs. Carnaby had said to Mr. Bart, as soon as\nMr. Mordacks let her know about the wedding, \"Oh, but, Mr. Bart, you\nare a gentleman; now, are you not? I am sure you are, though you do such\nthings! I am sure of it by your countenance.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" Mr. Bart replied, with a bow that was decisive, \"if I am not,\nit is my own fault, as it is the fault of every man.\"\n\nAt this present moment they were standing with their children, Lancelot\nand Insie, who had nicely recovered from matrimony, and began to be too\nhigh-spirited. They all knew, by virtue of Mr. Mordacks, who Robin Lyth\nwas; and they wanted to see him, and be kind to him, if he made no claim\nupon them. And Mr. Bart desired, as his father's friend, to shake hands\nwith him, and help him, if help were needed.\n\nBut Robin, with a grace and elegance which he must have imported from\nforeign parts, declined all connection and acquaintance with them,\nand declared his set resolve to have nothing to do with the name of\n\"Yordas.\" They were grieved, as they honestly declared, to hear it, but\ncould not help owning that his pride was just; and they felt that their\nname was the richer for not having any poor people to share it.\n\nYet Captain Lyth--as he now was called, even by revenue officers--in no\nway impoverished his name by taking another to share it with him. The\nfarmer declared that there should be no wedding until he had sold\nseven stacks of wheat, for his meaning was to do things well. But this\nobstacle did not last long, for those were times when corn was golden,\nnot in landscape only.\n\nSo when the spring was fair with promise of green for the earth, and\nof blue for heaven, and of silver-gray upon the sea, the little church\nclose to Anerley Farm filled up all the complement of colors. There\nwas scarlet, of Dr. Upround's hood (brought by the Precious boy from\nFlamborough); a rich plum-color in the coat of Mordacks; delicate rose\nand virgin white in the blush and the brow of Mary; every tint of the\nrainbow on her mother's part; and gold, rich gold, in a great tanned\nbag, on behalf of Squire Popplewell. His idea of a \"settlement\" was cash\ndown, and he put it on the parish register.\n\nMary found no cause to repent of the long endurance of her truth, and\nthe steadfast power of quiet love. Robin was often in the distance\nstill, far beyond the silvery streak of England's new salvation. But\nMary prayed for his safe return; and safe he was, by the will of the\nLord, which helps the man who helps himself, and has made his hand\nbigger than his tongue. When the war was over, Captain Lyth came home,\nand trained his children in the ways in which he should have walked, and\nthe duties they should do and pay.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mary Anerley, by R.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":993,"split":"train"}
