{"ori_id":"cb988d19a62895665c8434fc0b1ed41ba0f01357","title":"Lord Tony's Wife","context":"Lord Tony's Wife\n The year is 1789 and Pierre Adet, a young French peasant, is incensed at the unfair treatment of the local peasantry, who are no better off than slaves to the local aristocrat. His brother-in-law is about to be hanged for poaching two pigeons from the woods belonging to the Duc de Kernogan in Nantes and this proves the final straw. After months of planning Pierre leads a mob against the Duc against the advice of his father.\nBefore the mob have had the chance to storm the Chateau, they come across the Duc's young daughter Yvonne returning home and attack her carriage. In the ensuing scuffle, Adet assaults Yvonne\n'And just to punish you, my fine lady,' he said in a whisper which sent a shudder of horror right through her, 'to punish you for what you are, the brood of tyrants, proud, disdainful, a budding tyrant yourself, to punish you for every misery my mother and sister have had to endure, for every luxury which you have enjoyed, I will kiss you on the lips and the cheeks and just between your white throat and chin and never as long as you live if you die this night or live to be an hundred will you be able to wash off those kisses showered upon you by one who hates and loathes you --a miserable peasant whom you despise and who in your sight is lower far than your dogs.'\nShortly afterwards the Duc's private army arrive and dispatch the mob. Adet is seriously injured and seeks refuge from a local priest before fleeing Nantes and the death sentence which has been passed on him.\nDetermined that someone must pay for the incident, the Duc de Kernogan ensures that Pierre's father is hanged for his son's crime. By the time Adet finds out it is too late and he is driven to seek revenge against the Duc and his daughter.\nIn 1793, Adet is living in England under the alias of Martin-Roget. He has spent the intervening years educating himself. With the aid of an introductory letter, obtained by blackmailing the Bishop of Brest, has ingratiated himself into English society \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the extent that he has gained the favour of the Duc de Kernogan, who is now living near Bath, and is Yvonne's favoured suitor. Both Yvonne and her father are ignorant of Martin-Roget's true identity and are unaware that he is seeking revenge. With the help of Chauvelin, he plans to marry Yvonne and lure her and the Duc back to Nantes and to their death as ci-devants on the guillotine.\nAdet's plans suffer a setback when he discovers that Yvonne was warned by Sir Percy and that she is at risk from Martin-Roget. Yvonne has eloped with Lord Antony Dewhurst.\nThe Duc believes that Martin-Roget is a millionaire banker whose marriage to Yvonne will result in substantial funds being given to the French royalist cause. He is furious that his plans have been thwarted and refuses to recognise the marriage to Dewhurst, which would not be legal in France due to Yvonne's age. Martin-Roget convinces the Duc that he still wishes to marry Yvonne and soon persuade him to lure Yvonne away from Lord Tony. He then kidnaps her and the three set off for France.\nLord Tony must seek the help of The Scarlet Pimpernel to save his wife.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lord Tony's Wife, by Baroness Emmuska Orczy\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Haven't we planned enough and talked enough to satisfy our\npuling consciences? The time has come to strike, mes amis, to strike I\nsay, to strike at those cursed aristocrats, who have made us what we\nare--ignorant, wretched, downtrodden--senseless clods to work our\nfingers to the bone, our bodies till they break so that they may wallow\nin their pleasures and their luxuries! Strike, I say!\" he reiterated\nwhile his eyes glowed and his breath came and went through his throat\nwith a hissing sound. \"Strike! as the men and women struck in Paris on\nthat great day in July. To them the Bastille stood for tyranny, and they\nstruck at it as they would at the head of a tyrant--and the tyrant\ncowered, cringed, made terms--he was frightened at the wrath of the\npeople! That is what happened in Paris! That is what must happen in\nNantes. The ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of the duc de Kernogan is our Bastille! Let us\nstrike at it to-night, and if the arrogant aristocrat resists, we'll\nraze his house to the ground. The hour, the day, the darkness are all\npropitious. The arrangements hold good. The neighbours are ready.\nStrike, I say!\"\n\nHe brought his hard fist crashing down upon the table, so that mugs and\nbottles rattled: his enthusiasm had fired all his hearers: his hatred\nand his lust of revenge had done more in five minutes than all the\ntirades of the agitators sent down from Paris to instil revolutionary\nideas into the slow-moving brains of village lads.\n\n\"Who will give the signal?\" queried one of the older men quietly.\n\n\"I will!\" came a lusty response from Pierre.\n\nHe strode to the door, and all the men jumped to their feet, ready to\nfollow him, dragged into this hot-headed venture by the mere force of\none man's towering passion. They followed Pierre like sheep--sheep that\nhave momentarily become intoxicated--sheep that have become fierce--a\nstrange sight truly--and yet one that the man in the tattered coat who\nhad done so much speechifying lately, watched with eager interest and\npresently related with great wealth of detail to M. de Mirabeau the\nchampion of the people.\n\n\"It all came about through the death of a pair of pigeons,\" he said.\n\nThe death of the pigeons, however, was only the spark which set all\nthese turbulent passions ablaze. They had been smouldering for half a\ncentury, and had been ready to burst into flames for the past decade.\n\nAntoine Melun, the wheelwright, who was to have married Louise, Pierre's\nsister, had trapped a pair of pigeons in the woods of M. le duc de\nKernogan. He had done it to assert his rights as a man--he did not want\nthe pigeons. Though he was a poor man, he was no poorer than hundreds of\npeasants for miles around: but he paid imposts and taxes until every\nparticle of profit which he gleaned from his miserable little plot of\nland went into the hands of the collectors, whilst M. le duc de Kernogan\npaid not one sou towards the costs of the State, and he had to live on\nwhat was left of his own rye and wheat after M. le duc's pigeons had had\ntheir fill of them.\n\nAntoine Melun did not want to eat the pigeons which he had trapped, but\nhe desired to let M. le duc de Kernogan know that God and Nature had\nnever intended all the beasts and birds of the woods to be the exclusive\nproperty of one man, rather than another. So he trapped and killed two\npigeons and M. le duc's head-bailiff caught him in the act of carrying\nthose pigeons home.\n\nWhereupon Antoine was arrested for poaching and thieving: he was tried\nat Nantes under the presidency of M. le duc de Kernogan, and ten minutes\nago, while the man in the tattered coat was declaiming to a number of\npeasant lads in the coffee-room of the auberge des Trois Vertus on the\nsubject of their rights as men and citizens, some one brought the news\nthat Antoine Melun had just been condemned to death and would be hanged\non the morrow.\n\nThat was the spark which had fanned Pierre Adet's hatred of the\naristocrats to a veritable conflagration: the news of Antoine Melun's\nfate was the bleat which rallied all those human sheep around their\nleader. For Pierre had naturally become their leader because his hatred\nof M. le duc was more tangible, more powerful than theirs. Pierre had\nhad more education than they. His father, Jean Adet the miller, had sent\nhim to a school in Nantes, and when Pierre came home M. le cur\u00c3\u00a9 of\nVertou took an interest in him and taught him all he knew himself--which\nwas not much--in the way of philosophy and the classics. But later on\nPierre took to reading the writings of M. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and soon\nknew the _Contrat Social_ almost by heart. He had also read the articles\nin M. Marat's newspaper _L'ami du Peuple!_ and, like Antoine Melun, the\nwheelwright, he had got it into his head that it was not God, nor yet\nNature who had intended one man to starve while another gorged himself\non all the good things of this world.\n\nHe did not, however, speak of these matters, either to his father or to\nhis sister or to M. le cur\u00c3\u00a9, but he brooded over them, and when the\nprice of bread rose to four sous he muttered curses against M. le duc de\nKernogan, and when famine prices ruled throughout the district those\ncurses became overt threats; and by the time that the pinch of hunger\nwas felt in Vertou Pierre's passion of fury against the duc de Kernogan\nhad turned to a frenzy of hate against the entire noblesse of France.\n\nStill he said nothing to his father, nothing to his mother and sister.\nBut his father knew. Old Jean would watch the storm-clouds which\ngathered on Pierre's lowering brow; he heard the muttered curses which\nescaped from Pierre's lips whilst he worked for the liege-lord whom he\nhated. But Jean was a wise man and knew how useless it is to put out a\nfeeble hand in order to stem the onrush of a torrent. He knew how\nuseless are the words of wisdom from an old man to quell the rebellious\nspirit of the young.\n\nJean was on the watch. And evening after evening when the work on the\nfarm was done, Pierre would sit in the small low room of the auberge\nwith other lads from the village talking, talking of their wrongs, of\nthe arrogance of the aristocrats, the sins of M. le duc and his family,\nthe evil conduct of the King and the immorality of the Queen: and men in\nragged coats and tattered breeches came in from Nantes, and even from\nParis, in order to harangue these village lads and told them yet further\ntales of innumerable wrongs suffered by the people at the hands of the\naristos, and stuffed their heads full of schemes for getting even once\nand for all with those men and women who fattened on the sweat of the\npoor and drew their luxury from the hunger and the toil of the\npeasantry.\n\nPierre sucked in these harangues through every pore: they were meat and\ndrink to him. His hate and passions fed upon these effusions till his\nwhole being was consumed by a maddening desire for reprisals, for\nvengeance--for the lust of triumph over those whom he had been taught to\nfear.\n\nAnd in the low, narrow room of the auberge the fevered heads of village\nlads were bent together in conclave, and the ravings and shoutings of a\nwhile ago were changed to whisperings and low murmurings behind barred\ndoors and shuttered windows. Men exchanged cryptic greetings when they\nmet in the village street, enigmatical signs passed between them while\nthey worked: strangers came and went at dead of night to and from the\nneighbouring villages. M. le duc's overseers saw nothing, heard nothing,\nguessed nothing. M. le cur\u00c3\u00a9 saw much and old Jean Adet guessed a great\ndeal, but they said nothing, for nothing then would have availed.\n\nThen came the catastrophe.\n\n\nII\n\nPierre pushed open the outer door of the auberge des Trois Vertus and\nstepped out under the porch. A gust of wind caught him in the face. The\nnight, so the chronicles of the time tell us, was as dark as pitch: on\nahead lay the lights of the city flickering in the gale: to the left the\nwide tawny ribbon of the river wound its turbulent course toward the\nocean, the booming of the waters swollen by the recent melting of the\nsnow sounded like the weird echoes of invisible cannons far away.\n\nWithout hesitation Pierre advanced. His little troop followed him in\nsilence. They were a little sobered now that they came out into the open\nand that the fumes of cider and of hot, perspiring humanity no longer\nobscured their vision or inflamed their brain.\n\nThey knew whither Pierre was going. It had all been\npre-arranged--throughout this past summer, in the musty parlour of the\nauberge, behind barred doors and shuttered windows--all they had to do\nwas to follow Pierre, whom they had tacitly chosen as their leader. They\nwalked on behind him, their hands buried in the pockets of their thin,\ntattered breeches, their heads bent forward against the fury of the\ngale.\n\nPierre made straight for the mill--his home--where his father lived and\nwhere Louise was even now crying her eyes out because Antoine Melun, her\nsweetheart, had been condemned to be hanged for killing two pigeons.\n\nAt the back of the mill was the dwelling house and beyond it a small\nfarmery, for Jean Adet owned a little bit of land and would have been\nfairly well off if the taxes had not swallowed up all the money that he\nmade out of the sale of his rye and his hay. Just here the ground rose\nsharply to a little hillock which dominated the flat valley of the Loire\nand commanded a fine view over the more distant villages.\n\nPierre skirted the mill and without looking round to see if the others\nfollowed him he struck squarely to the right up a narrow lane bordered\nby tall poplars, and which led upwards to the summit of the little\nhillock around which clustered the tumble-down barns of his father's\nfarmery.\n\nThe gale lashed the straight, tall stems of the poplars until they bent\nnearly double, and each tiny bare twig sighed and whispered as if in\npain. Pierre strode on and the others followed in silence. They were\nchilled to the bone under their scanty clothes, but they followed on\nwith grim determination, set teeth, and anger and hate seething in their\nhearts.\n\nThe top of the rising ground was reached. It was pitch dark, and the men\nwhen they halted fell up against one another trying to get a foothold on\nthe sodden ground. But Pierre seemed to have eyes like a cat. He only\npaused one moment to get his bearings, then--still without a word--he\nset to work. A large barn and a group of small circular straw ricks\nloomed like solid masses out of the darkness--black, silhouetted against\nthe black of the stormy sky. Pierre turned toward the barn: those of his\ncomrades who were in the forefront of the small crowd saw him\ndisappearing inside one of those solid shadowy masses that looked so\nghostlike in the night.\n\nAnon those who watched and who happened to be facing the interior of the\nbarn saw sparks from a tinder flying in every direction: the next\nmoment they could see Pierre himself quite clearly. He was standing in\nthe middle of the barn and intent on lighting a roughly-fashioned torch\nwith his tinder: soon the resin caught a spark and Pierre held the torch\ninclined toward the ground so that the flames could lick their way up\nthe shaft. The flickering light cast a weird glow and deep grotesque\nshadows upon the face and figure of the young man. His hair, lanky and\ndishevelled, fell over his eyes; his mouth and jaw, illumined from below\nby the torch, looked unnaturally large, and showed his teeth gleaming\nwhite, like the fangs of a beast of prey. His shirt was torn open at the\nneck, and the sleeves of his coat were rolled up to the elbow. He seemed\nnot to feel either the cold from without or the scorching heat of the\nflaming torch in his hand. But he worked deliberately and calmly,\nwithout haste or febrile movements: grim determination held his\nexcitement in check.\n\nAt last his work was done. The men who had pressed forward, in order to\nwatch him, fell back as he advanced, torch in hand. They knew exactly\nwhat he was going to do, they had thought it all out, planned it, spoken\nof it till even their unimaginative minds had visualised this coming\nscene with absolutely realistic perception. And yet, now that the\nsupreme hour had come, now that they saw Pierre--torch in hand--prepared\nto give the signal which would set ablaze the seething revolt of the\ncountryside, their heart seemed to stop its beating within their body;\nthey held their breath, their toil-worn hands went up to their throats\nas if to repress that awful choking sensation which was so like fear.\n\nBut Pierre had no such hesitations; if his breath seemed to choke him as\nit reached his throat, if it escaped through his set teeth with a\nstrange whistling sound, it was because his excitement was that of a\nhungry beast who had sighted his prey and is ready to spring and devour.\nHis hand did not shake, his step was firm: the gusts of wind caught the\nflame of his torch till the sparks flew in every direction and scorched\nhis hair and his hands, and while the others recoiled he strode on, to\nthe straw-rick that was nearest.\n\nFor one moment he held the torch aloft. There was triumph now in his\neyes, in his whole attitude. He looked out into the darkness far away\nwhich seemed all the more impenetrable beyond the restricted circle of\nflickering torchlight. It seemed as if he would wrest from that inky\nblackness all the secrets which it hid--all the enthusiasm, the\nexcitement, the passions, the hatred which he would have liked to set\nablaze as he would the straw-ricks anon.\n\n\"Are you ready, mes amis?\" he called.\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" they replied--not gaily, not lustily, but calmly and under\ntheir breath.\n\nOne touch of the torch and the dry straw began to crackle; a gust of\nwind caught the flame and whipped it into energy; it crept up the side\nof the little rick like a glowing python that wraps its prey in its\nembrace. Another gust of wind, and the flame leapt joyously up to the\npinnacle of the rick, and sent forth other tongues to lick and to lick,\nto enfold the straw, to devour, to consume.\n\nBut Pierre did not wait to see the consummation of his work of\ndestruction. Already with a few rapid strides he had reached his\nfather's second straw-rick, and this too he set alight, and then another\nand another, until six blazing furnaces sent their lurid tongues of\nflames, twisting and twirling, writhing and hissing through the stormy\nnight.\n\nWithin the space of two minutes the whole summit of the hillock seemed\nto be ablaze, and Pierre, like a god of fire, torch in hand, seemed to\npreside over and command a multitude of ever-spreading flames to his\nwill. Excitement had overmastered him now, the lust to destroy was upon\nhim, and excitement had seized all the others too.\n\nThere was shouting and cursing, and laughter that sounded mirthless and\nforced, and calls to Pierre, and oaths of revenge. Memory, like an\nevil-intentioned witch, was riding invisibly in the darkness, and she\ntouched each seething brain with her fever-giving wand. Every man had an\noutrage to remember, an injustice to recall, and strong, brown fists\nwere shaken aloft in the direction of the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Kernogan, whose\nlights glimmered feebly in the distance beyond the Loire.\n\n\"Death to the tyrant! A la lanterne les aristos! The people's hour has\ncome at last! No more starvation! No more injustice! Equality! Liberty!\nA mort les aristos!\"\n\nThe shouts, the curses, the crackling flames, the howling of the wind,\nthe soughing of the trees, made up a confusion of sounds which seemed\nhardly of this earth; the blazing ricks, the flickering, red light of\nthe flames had finally transformed the little hillock behind the mill\ninto another Brocken on whose summit witches and devils do of a truth\nhold their revels.\n\n\"A moi!\" shouted Pierre again, and he threw his torch down upon the\nground and once more made for the barn. The others followed him. In the\nbarn were such weapons as these wretched, penniless peasants had managed\nto collect--scythes, poles, axes, saws, anything that would prove useful\nfor the destruction of the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Kernogan and the proposed\nbrow-beating of M. le duc and his family. All the men trooped in in the\nwake of Pierre. The entire hillock was now a blaze of light--lurid and\nred and flickering--alternately teased and fanned and subdued by the\ngale, so that at times every object stood out clearly cut, every blade\nof grass, every stone in bold relief, and in the ruts and fissures,\nevery tiny pool of muddy water shimmered like strings of fire-opals:\nwhilst at others, a pall of inky darkness, smoke-laden and impenetrable\nwould lie over the ground and erase the outline of farm-buildings and\ndistant mill and of the pushing and struggling mass of humanity inside\nthe barn.\n\nBut Pierre, heedless of light and darkness, of heat or of cold,\nproceeded quietly and methodically to distribute the primitive\nimplements of warfare to this crowd of ignorant men, who were by now\nover ready for mischief: and with every weapon which he placed in\nwilling hands, he found the right words for willing ears--words which\nwould kindle passion and lust of vengeance most readily where they lay\ndormant, or would fan them into greater vigour where they smouldered.\n\n\"For thee this scythe, Hector Lebrun,\" he would say to a tall, lanky\nyouth whose emaciated arms and bony hands were stretched with longing\ntoward the bright piece of steel; \"remember last year's harvest, the\nheavy tax thou wert forced to pay, so that not one sou of profit went\ninto thy pocket, and thy mother starved whilst M. le duc and his brood\nfeasted and danced, and shiploads of corn were sunk in the Loire lest\nabundance made bread too cheap for the poor!\n\n\"For thee this pick-axe, Henri Meunier! Remember the new roof on thy\nhut, which thou didst build to keep the wet off thy wife's bed, who was\ncrippled with ague--and the heavy impost levied on thee by the\ntax-collector for this improvement to thy miserable hovel.\n\n\"This pole for thee, Charles Blanc! Remember the beating administered to\nthee by the duc's bailiff for daring to keep a tame rabbit to amuse thy\nchildren!\n\n\"Remember! Remember, mes amis!\" he added exultantly, \"remember every\nwrong you have endured, every injustice, every blow! remember your\npoverty and his wealth, your crusts of dry bread and his succulent\nmeals, your rags and his silks and velvets, remember your starving\nchildren and ailing mother, your care-laden wife and toil-worn\ndaughters! Forget nothing, mes amis, to-night, and at the gates of the\nch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Kernogan demand of its arrogant owner wrong for wrong and\noutrage for outrage.\"\n\nA deafening cry of triumph greeted this peroration, scythes and sickles\nand axes and poles were brandished in the air and several scores of\nhands were stretched out to Pierre and clasped in this newly-formed bond\nof vengeful fraternity.\n\n\nIII\n\nThen it was that with vigorous play of the elbows, Jean Adet, the\nmiller, forced his way through the crowd till he stood face to face with\nhis son.\n\n\"Unfortunate!\" he cried, \"what is all this? What dost thou propose to\ndo? Whither are ye all going?\"\n\n\"To Kernogan!\" they all shouted in response.\n\n\"En avant, Pierre! we follow!\" cried some of them impatiently.\n\nBut Jean Adet--who was a powerful man despite his years--had seized\nPierre by the arm and dragged him to a distant corner of the barn:\n\n\"Pierre!\" he said in tones of command, \"I forbid thee in the name of thy\nduty and the obedience which thou dost owe to me and to thy mother, to\nmove another step in this hot-headed adventure. I was on the high-road,\nwalking homewards, when that conflagration and the senseless cries of\nthese poor lads warned me that some awful mischief was afoot. Pierre!\nmy son! I command thee to lay that weapon down.\"\n\nBut Pierre--who in his normal state was a dutiful son and sincerely fond\nof his father--shook himself free from Jean Adet's grasp.\n\n\"Father!\" he said loudly and firmly, \"this is no time for interference.\nWe are all of us men here and know our own minds. What we mean to do\nto-night we have thought on and planned for weeks and months. I pray\nyou, father, let me be! I am not a child and I have work to do.\"\n\n\"Not a child?\" exclaimed the old man as he turned appealingly to the\nlads who had stood by, silent and sullen during this little scene. \"Not\na child? But you are all only children, my lads. You don't know what you\nare doing. You don't know what terrible consequences this mad escapade\nwill bring upon us all, upon the whole village, aye! and the\ncountry-side. Do you suppose for one moment that the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of Kernogan\nwill fall at the mercy of a few ignorant unarmed lads like yourselves?\nWhy! four hundred of you would not succeed in forcing your way even as\nfar as the courtyard of the palace. M. le duc has had wind for some time\nof your turbulent meetings at the auberge: he has kept an armed guard\ninside his castle yard for weeks past, a company of artillery with two\nguns hoisted upon his walls. My poor lads! you are running straight to\nruin! Go home, I beg of you! Forget this night's escapade! Nothing but\nmisery to you and yours can result from it.\"\n\nThey listened quietly, if surlily, to Jean Adet's impassioned words. Far\nbe it from their thoughts to flout or to mock him. Paternal authority\ncommanded respect even among the most rough; but they all felt that they\nhad gone too far now to draw back: the savour of anticipated revenge had\nbeen too sweet to be forgone quite so readily, and Pierre with his\nvigorous personality, his glowing eloquence, his compelling power had\nmore influence over them than the sober counsels of prudence and the\nwise admonitions of old Jean Adet. Not one word was spoken, but with an\ninstinctive gesture every man grasped his weapon more firmly and then\nturned to Pierre, thus electing him their spokesman.\n\nPierre too had listened in silence to all that his father said, striving\nto hide the burning anxiety which was gnawing at his heart, lest his\ncomrades allowed themselves to be persuaded by the old man's counsels\nand their ardour be cooled by the wise dictates of prudence. But when\nJean Adet had finished speaking, and Pierre saw each man thus grasping\nhis weapon all the more firmly and in silence, a cry of triumph escaped\nhis lips.\n\n\"It is all in vain, father,\" he cried, \"our minds are made up. A host of\nangels from heaven would not bar our way now to victory and to\nvengeance.\"\n\n\"Pierre!\" admonished the old man.\n\n\"It is too late, my father,\" said Pierre firmly, \"en avant, lads!\"\n\n\"Yes! en avant! en avant!\" assented some, \"we have wasted too much time\nas it is.\"\n\n\"But, unfortunate lads,\" admonished the old man, \"what are you going to\ndo?--a handful of you--where are you going?\"\n\n\"We go straight to the cross-roads now, father,\" said Pierre, firmly.\n\"The firing of your ricks--for which I humbly crave your pardon--is the\npreconcerted signal which will bring the lads from all the neighbouring\nvillages--from Goulaine and les Sorini\u00c3\u00a8res and Doulon and Tourne-Bride\nto our meeting place. Never you fear! There will be more than four\nhundred of us and a company of paid soldiers is not like to frighten us.\nEh, lads?\"\n\n\"No! no! en avant!\" they shouted and murmured impatiently, \"there has\nbeen too much talking already and we have wasted precious time.\"\n\n\"Pierre!\" entreated the miller.\n\nBut no one listened to the old man now. A general movement down the\nhillock had already begun and Pierre, turning his back on his father,\nhad pushed his way to the front of the crowd and was now leading the way\ndown the slope. Up on the summit the fire was already burning low; only\nfrom time to time an imprisoned tongue of flame would dart out of the\ndying embers and leap fitfully up into the night. A dull red glow\nillumined the small farmery and the mill and the slowly moving mass of\nmen along the narrow road, whilst clouds of black, dense smoke were\ntossed about by the gale. Pierre walked with head erect. He ceased to\nthink of his father and he never looked back to see if the others\nfollowed him. He knew that they did: like the straw-ricks a while ago,\nthey had become the prey of a consuming fire: the fire of their own\npassion which had caught them and held them and would not leave them now\nuntil their ardour was consumed in victory or defeat.\n\n\nIV\n\nM. le duc de Kernogan had just finished dinner when Jacques Labruni\u00c3\u00a8re,\nhis head-bailiff, came to him with the news that a rabble crowd,\ncomposed of the peasantry of Goulaine and Vertou and the neighbouring\nvillages, had assembled at the cross-roads, there held revolutionary\nspeeches, and was even now marching toward the castle still shouting\nand singing and brandishing a miscellaneous collection of weapons\nchiefly consisting of scythes and axes.\n\n\"The guard is under arms, I imagine,\" was M. le duc's comment on this\nnot altogether unforeseen piece of news.\n\n\"Everything is in perfect order,\" replied the head-bailiff cooly, \"for\nthe defence of M. le duc and his property--and of Mademoiselle.\"\n\nM. le duc, who had been lounging in one of the big armchairs in the\nstately hall of Kernogan, jumped to his feet at these words: his cheeks\nsuddenly pallid, and a look of deadly fear in his eyes.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said hurriedly, \"by G--d, Labruni\u00c3\u00a8re, I had\nforgotten--momentarily----\"\n\n\"M. le duc?\" stammered the bailiff in anxious inquiry.\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Kernogan is on her way home--even now--she spent the\nday with Mme. la Marquise d'Herbignac--she was to return at about eight\no'clock.... If those devils meet her carriage on the road....\"\n\n\"There is no cause for anxiety, M. le duc,\" broke in Labruni\u00c3\u00a8re\nhurriedly. \"I will see that half a dozen men get to horse at once and go\nand meet Mademoiselle and escort her home....\"\n\n\"Yes ... yes ... Labruni\u00c3\u00a8re,\" murmured the duc, who seemed very much\novercome with terror now that his daughter's safety was in jeopardy,\n\"see to it at once. Quick! quick! I shall wax crazy with anxiety.\"\n\nWhile Labruni\u00c3\u00a8re ran to make the necessary arrangements for an efficient\nescort for Mademoiselle de Kernogan and gave the sergeant in charge of\nthe posse the necessary directions, M. le duc remained motionless,\nhuddled up in the capacious armchair, his head buried in his hand,\nshivering in front of the huge fire which burned in the monumental\nhearth, himself the prey of nameless, overwhelming terror.\n\nHe knew--none better--the appalling hatred wherewith he and all his\nfamily and belongings were regarded by the local peasantry. Astride upon\nhis manifold rights--feudal, territorial, seignorial rights--he had all\nhis life ridden roughshod over the prejudices, the miseries, the\nundoubted rights of the poor people, who were little better than serfs\nin the possession of the high and mighty duc de Kernogan. He also\nknew--none better--that gradually, very gradually it is true, but with\nunerring certainty, those same downtrodden, ignorant, miserable and\nhalf-starved peasants were turning against their oppressors, that riots\nand outrages had occurred in many rural districts in the North and that\nthe insidious poison of social revolution was gradually creeping toward\nthe South and West, and had already infected the villages and small\ntownships which were situated quite unpleasantly close to Nantes and to\nKernogan.\n\nFor this reason he had kept a company of artillery at his own expense\ninside the precincts of his ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, and with the aristocrat's open\ncontempt for this peasantry which it had not yet learned to fear, he had\ndisdained to take further measures for the repression of local\ngatherings, and would not pay the village rabble the compliment of being\nafraid of them in any way.\n\nBut with his daughter Yvonne in the open roadway on the very night when\nan assembly of that same rabble was obviously bent on mischief, matters\nbecame very serious. Insult, outrage or worse might befall the proud\naristocrat's only child, and knowing that from these people, whom she\nhad been taught to look upon as little better than beasts, she could\nexpect neither mercy nor chivalry, the duc de Kernogan within his\nunassailable castle felt for his daughter's safety the most abject, the\nmost deadly fear which hath ever unnerved any man.\n\nLabruni\u00c3\u00a8re a few minutes later did his best to reassure his master.\n\n\"I have ordered the men to take the best horses out of the stables, M.\nle duc,\" he said, \"and to cut across the fields toward la Gramoire so as\nto intercept Mademoiselle's coach ere it reach the cross-roads. I feel\nconfident that there is no cause for alarm,\" he added emphatically.\n\n\"Pray God you are right, Labruni\u00c3\u00a8re,\" murmured the duc feebly. \"Do you\nknow how strong the rabble crowd is?\"\n\n\"No, Monseigneur, not exactly. Camille the under-bailiff, who brought me\nthe news, was riding homewards across the meadows about an hour ago when\nhe saw a huge conflagration which seemed to come from the back of Adet's\nmill: the whole sky has been lit up by a lurid light for the past hour,\nand I fancied myself that Adet's straw must be on fire. But Camille\npushed his horse up the rising ground which culminates at Adet's\nfarmery. It seems that he heard a great deal of shouting which did not\nseem to be accompanied by any attempt at putting out the fire. So he\ndismounted and led his horse round the hillock skirting Adet's farm\nbuildings so that he should not be seen. Under cover of darkness he\nheard and saw the old miller with his son Pierre engaged in distributing\nscythes, poles and axes to a crowd of youngsters and haranguing them\nwildly all the time. He also heard Pierre Adet speak of the\nconflagration as a preconcerted signal, and say that he and his mates\nwould meet the lads of the neighbouring villages at the cross-roads ...\nand that four hundred of them would then march on Kernogan and pillage\nthe castle.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" quoth M. le duc in a voice hoarse with execration and contempt,\n\"a lot of oafs who will give the hangman plenty of trouble to-morrow.\nAs for that Adet and his son, they shall suffer for this ... I can\npromise them that.... If only Mademoiselle were home!\" he added with a\nheartrending sigh.\n\n\nV\n\nIndeed, had M. le duc de Kernogan been gifted with second sight, the\nagony of mind which he was enduring would have been aggravated an\nhundredfold. At the very moment when the head-bailiff was doing his best\nto reassure his liege-lord as to the safety of Mlle. de Kernogan, her\ncoach was speeding along from the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of Herbignac toward those same\ncross-roads where a couple of hundred hot-headed peasant lads were\nplanning as much mischief as their unimaginative minds could conceive.\n\nThe fury of the gale had in no way abated, and now a heavy rain was\nfalling--a drenching, sopping rain which in the space of half an hour\nhad added five centimetres to the depth of the mud on the roads, and had\nin that same space of time considerably damped the enthusiasm of some of\nthe poor lads. Three score or so had assembled from Goulaine, two score\nfrom les Sorini\u00c3\u00a8res, some three dozen from Doulon: they had rallied to\nthe signal in hot haste, gathered their scythes and spades, very eager\nand excited, and had reached the cross-roads which were much nearer to\ntheir respective villages than to Jean Adet's farm and the mill, even\nwhile the old man was admonishing his son and the lads of Vertou on the\nsummit of the blazing hillock. Here they had spent half an hour in\ncooling their heels and their tempers under the drenching rain--wet to\nthe skin--fuming and fretting at the delay.\n\nBut even so--damped in ardour and chilled to the marrow--they were\nstill a dangerous crowd and prudence ought to have dictated to\nMademoiselle de Kernogan the wiser course of ordering her coachman\nJean-Marie to head his horses back toward Herbignac the moment that the\noutrider reported that a mob, armed with scythes, spades and axes, held\nthe cross-roads, and that it would be dangerous for the coach to advance\nany further.\n\nAlready for the past few minutes the sound of loud shouting had been\nheard even above the tramp of the horses and the clatter of the coach.\nJean-Marie had pulled up and sent one of the outriders on ahead to see\nwhat was amiss: the man returned with very unpleasant tidings--in his\nopinion it certainly would be dangerous to go any further. The mob\nappeared bent on mischief: he had heard threats and curses all levelled\nagainst M. le duc de Kernogan--the conflagration up at Vertou was\nevidently a signal which would bring along a crowd of malcontents from\nall the neighbouring villages. He was for turning back forthwith. But\nMademoiselle put her head out of the window just then and asked what was\namiss. On hearing that Jean-Marie and the postilion and outriders were\ninclined to be afraid of a mob of peasant lads who had assembled at the\ncross-roads, and were apparently threatening to do mischief, she chided\nthem for their cowardice.\n\n\"Jean-Marie,\" she called scornfully to the old coachman, who had been in\nher father's service for close on half a century, \"do you really mean to\ntell me that you are afraid of that rabble!\"\n\n\"Why no! Mademoiselle, so please you,\" replied the old man, nettled in\nhis pride by the taunt, \"but the temper of the peasantry round here has\nbeen ugly of late, and 'tis your safety I have got to guard.\"\n\n\"'Tis my commands you have got to obey,\" retorted Mademoiselle with a\ngay little laugh which mitigated the peremptoriness of her tone. \"If my\nfather should hear that there's trouble on the road he will die of\nanxiety if I do not return: so whip up the horses, Jean-Marie. No one\nwill dare to attack the coach.\"\n\n\"But Mademoiselle----\" remonstrated the old man.\n\n\"Ah \u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a0!\" she broke in more impatiently, \"am I to be openly disobeyed?\nBest join that rabble, Jean-Marie, if you have no respect for my\ncommands.\"\n\nThus twitted by Mademoiselle's sharp tongue, Jean-Marie could not help\nbut obey. He tried to peer into the distance through the veil of\nblinding rain which beat against his face and stung the horses to\nrestlessness. But the light from the coach lanthorns prevented his\nseeing clearly into the darkness beyond. Still it seemed to him that on\nahead a dense and solid mass was moving toward the coach, also that the\nsound of shouting and of excited humanity was considerably nearer than\nit had been before. No doubt the mob had perceived the lights of the\ncoach, and was even now making towards it, with what intent Jean-Marie\ndivined all too accurately.\n\nBut he had his orders, and, though he was an old and trusted servant,\ndisobedience these days was not even to be thought of. So he did as he\nwas bid. He whipped up his horses, which were high-spirited and answered\nto the lash with a bound and a plunge forward. Mlle. de Kernogan leaned\nback on the cushions of the coach. She was satisfied that Jean-Marie had\ndone as he was told, and she was not in the least afraid.\n\nBut less than five minutes later she had a rude awakening. The coach\ngave a terrific lurch. The horses reared and plunged, there was a\ndeafening clamour all around: men were shouting and cursing: there was\nthe clash of wood and iron and the cracking of whips: the tramp of\nhorses' hoofs in the soft ground, and the dull thud of human bodies\nfalling in the mud, followed by loud cries of pain. There was the sudden\ncrash of broken glass, the coach lanthorns had been seized and broken:\nit seemed to Yvonne de Kernogan that out of the darkness faces distorted\nwith fury were peering at her through the window-panes. But through all\nthe confusion, the coach kept moving on. Jean-Marie stuck to his post,\nas did also the postilion and the four outriders, and with whip and\ntongue they urged their horses to break through the crowd regardless of\nhuman lives, knocking and trampling down men and lads heedless of curses\nand blasphemies which were hurled on them and on the occupants of the\ncoach, whoever they might be.\n\nThe next moment, however, the coach came to a sudden halt, and a wild\ncry of triumph drowned the groans of the injured and the dying.\n\n\"Kernogan! Kernogan!\" was shouted from every side.\n\n\"Adet! Adet!\"\n\n\"You limbs of Satan,\" cried Jean-Marie, \"you'll rue this night's work\nand weep tears of blood for the rest of your lives. Let me tell you\nthat! Mademoiselle is in the coach. When M. le duc hears of this, there\nwill be work for the hangman....\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle in the coach,\" broke in a hoarse voice with a rough tone\nof command. \"Let's look at her....\"\n\n\"Aye! Aye! let's have a look at Mademoiselle,\" came with a volley of\nobjurgations and curses from the crowd.\n\n\"You devils--you would dare?\" protested Jean-Marie.\n\nWithin the coach Yvonne de Kernogan hardly dared to breathe. She sat\nbolt upright, her cape held tightly round her shoulders: her eyes\ndilated now with excitement, if not with fear, were fixed upon the\ndarkness beyond the window-panes. She could see nothing, but she _felt_\nthe presence of that hostile crowd who had succeeded in over-powering\nJean-Marie and were intent on doing her harm.\n\nBut she belonged to a caste which never reckoned cowardice amongst its\nmany faults. During these few moments when she knew that her life hung\non the merest thread of chance, she neither screamed nor fainted but sat\nrigidly still, her heart beating in unison with the agonising seconds\nwhich went so fatefully by. And even now, when the carriage door was\ntorn violently open and even through the darkness she discerned vaguely\nthe forms of these avowed enemies close beside her, and anon felt a\nrough hand seize her wrist, she did not move, but said quite calmly,\nwith hardly a tremor in her voice:\n\n\"Who are you? and what do you want?\"\n\nAn outburst of harsh and ironical laughter came in response.\n\n\"Who are we, my fine lady?\" said the foremost man in the crowd, he who\nhad seized her wrist and was half in and half out of the coach at this\nmoment, \"we are the men who throughout our lives have toiled and starved\nwhilst you and such as you travel in fine coaches and eat your fill.\nWhat we want? Why, just the spectacle of such a fine lady as you are\nbeing knocked down into the mud just as our wives and daughters are if\nthey happen to be in the way when your coach is passing. Isn't that it,\nmes amis?\"\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" they replied, shouting lustily. \"Into the mud with the fine\nlady. Out with her, Adet. Let's have a look at Mademoiselle how she will\nlook with her face in the mud. Out with her, quick!\"\n\nBut the man who was still half in and half out of the coach, and who had\nhold of Mademoiselle's wrist did not obey his mates immediately. He drew\nher nearer to him and suddenly threw his rough, begrimed arms round\nher, and with one hand pulled back her hood, then placing two fingers\nunder her chin, he jerked it up till her face was level with his own.\n\nYvonne de Kernogan was certainly no coward, but at the loathsome contact\nof this infuriated and vengeful creature, she was overcome with such a\nhideous sense of fear that for the moment consciousness almost left her:\nnot completely alas! for though she could not distinguish his face she\ncould feel his hot breath upon her cheeks, she could smell the\nnauseating odour of his damp clothes, and she could hear his hoarse\nmutterings as for the space of a few seconds he held her thus close to\nhim in an embrace which to her was far more awesome than that of death.\n\n\"And just to punish you, my fine lady,\" he said in a whisper which sent\na shudder of horror right through her, \"to punish you for what you are,\nthe brood of tyrants, proud, disdainful, a budding tyrant yourself, to\npunish you for every misery my mother and sister have had to endure, for\nevery luxury which you have enjoyed, I will kiss you on the lips and the\ncheeks and just between your white throat and chin and never as long as\nyou live if you die this night or live to be an hundred will you be able\nto wash off those kisses showered upon you by one who hates and loathes\nyou--a miserable peasant whom you despise and who in your sight is lower\nfar than your dogs.\"\n\nYvonne, with eyes closed, hardly breathed, but through the veil of\nsemi-consciousness which mercifully wrapped her senses, she could still\nhear those awful words, and feel the pollution of those loathsome kisses\nwith which--true to his threat--this creature--half man, wholly devil,\nwhom she could not see, but whom she hated and feared as she would Satan\nhimself--now covered her face and throat.\n\nAfter that she remembered nothing more. Consciousness mercifully forsook\nher altogether. When she recovered her senses, she was within the\nprecincts of the castle: a confused murmur of voices reached her ears,\nand her father's arms were round her. Gradually she distinguished what\nwas being said: she gathered the threads of the story which Jean-Marie\nand the postilion and outriders were hastily unravelling in response to\nM. le duc's commands.\n\nThese men of course knew nothing of the poignant little drama which had\nbeen enacted inside the coach. All they knew was that they had been\nsurrounded by a rough crowd--a hundred or so strong--who brandished\nscythes and spades, that they had made valiant efforts to break through\nthe crowd by whipping up their horses, but that suddenly some of those\ndevils more plucky than the others seized the horses by their bits and\nrendered poor Jean-Marie quite helpless. He thought then that all would\nbe up with the lot of them and was thinking of scrambling down from his\nbox in order to protect Mademoiselle with his body, and the pistols\nwhich he had in the boot, when happily for every one concerned, he heard\nin the distance--above the clatter which that abominable rabble was\nmaking, the hurried tramp of horses. At once he jumped to the conclusion\nthat these could be none other than a company of soldiers sent by M. le\nduc. This spurred him to a fresh effort, and gave him a new idea. To\nCarmail the postilion who had a pistol in his holster he gave the\nperemptory order to fire a shot into the air or into the crowd,\nJean-Marie cared not which. This Carmail did, and at once the horses,\nalready maddened by the crowd, plunged and reared wildly, shaking\nthemselves free. Jean-Marie, however, had them well in hand, and from\nfar away there came the cries of encouragement from the advancing\nhorsemen who were bearing down on them full tilt. The next moment there\nwas a general m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e. Jean-Marie saw nothing save his horses' heads, but\nthe outriders declared that men were trampled down like flies all\naround, while others vanished into the night.\n\nWhat happened after that none of the men knew or cared. Jean-Marie\ngalloped his horses all the way to the castle and never drew rein until\nthe precincts were reached.\n\n\nVI\n\nHad M. de Kernogan had his way and a free hand to mete out retributive\njustice in the proportion that he desired, there is no doubt that the\nhangman of Nantes would have been kept exceedingly busy. As it was a\nnumber of arrests were effected the following day--half the manhood of\nthe countryside was implicated in the aborted _Jacquerie_ and the city\nprison was not large enough to hold it all.\n\nA court of justice presided over by M. le duc, and composed of half a\ndozen men who were directly or indirectly in his employ, pronounced\nsummary sentences on the rioters which were to have been carried out as\nsoon as the necessary arrangements for such wholesale executions\ncould be made. Nantes was turned into a city of wailing;\npeasant-women--mothers, sisters, daughters, wives of the condemned,\ntrooped from their villages into the city, loudly calling on M. le duc\nfor mercy, besieging the improvised court-house, the prison gates, the\ntown residence of M. le duc, the palace of the bishop: they pushed their\nway into the courtyards and the very corridors of those\nbuildings--flunkeys could not cope with them--they fought with fists and\nelbows for the right to make a direct appeal to the liege-lord who had\npower of life and death over their men.\n\nThe municipality of Nantes held aloof from this distressful state of\nthings, and the town councillors, the city functionaries and their\nfamilies shut themselves up in their houses in order to avoid being a\nwitness to the heartrending scenes which took place uninterruptedly\nround the court-house and the prison. The mayor himself was powerless to\ninterfere, but it is averred that he sent a secret courier to Paris to\nM. de Mirabeau, who was known to be a personal friend of his, with a\ndetailed account of the _Jacquerie_ and of the terrible measures of\nreprisal contemplated by M. le duc de Kernogan, together with an earnest\nrequest that pressure from the highest possible quarters be brought to\nbear upon His Grace so that he should abate something of his vengeful\nrigours.\n\nPoor King Louis, who in these days was being terrorised by the National\nAssembly and swept off his feet by the eloquence of M. de Mirabeau, was\nonly too ready to make concessions to the democratic spirit of the day.\nHe also desired his noblesse to be equally ready with such concessions.\nHe sent a personal letter to M. le duc, not only asking him, but\ncommanding him, to show grace and mercy to a lot of misguided peasant\nlads whose loyalty and adherence--he urged--might be won by a gracious\nand unexpected act of clemency.\n\nThe King's commands could not in the nature of things be disobeyed: the\nsame stroke of the pen which was about to send half a hundred young\ncountrymen to the gallows granted them M. le duc's gracious pardon and\ntheir liberty: the only exception to this general amnesty being Pierre\nAdet, the son of the miller. M. le duc's servants had deposed to seeing\nhim pull open the door of the coach and stand for some time half in and\nhalf out of the carriage, obviously trying to terrorise Mademoiselle.\nMademoiselle refused either to corroborate or to deny this statement,\nbut she had arrived fainting at the gate of the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, and she had\nbeen very ill ever since. She had sustained a serious shock to her\nnerves, so the doctor hastily summoned from Paris had averred, and it\nwas supposed that she had lost all recollection of the terrible\nincidents of that night.\n\nBut M. le duc was satisfied that it was Pierre Adet's presence inside\nthe coach which had brought about his daughter's mysterious illness and\nthat heartrending look of nameless horror which had dwelt in her eyes\never since. Therefore with regard to that man M. le duc remained\nimplacable and as a concession to a father's outraged feelings both the\nmayor of Nantes and the city functionaries accepted Adet's condemnation\nwithout a murmur of dissent.\n\nThe sentence of death finally passed upon Pierre, the son of Jean Adet,\nmiller of Vertou, could not, however, be executed, for the simple reason\nthat Pierre had disappeared and that the most rigorous search instituted\nin the neighbourhood and for miles around failed to bring him to\njustice. One of the outriders who had been in attendance on Mademoiselle\non that fateful night declared that when Jean-Marie finally whipped up\nhis horses at the approach of the party of soldiers, Adet fell backwards\nfrom the step of the carriage and was run over by the hind wheels and\ninstantly killed. But his body was never found among the score or so\nwhich were left lying there in the mud of the road until the women and\nold men came to seek their loved ones among the dead.\n\nPierre Adet had disappeared. But M. le duc's vengeance had need of a\nprey. The outrage which he was quite convinced had been perpetrated\nagainst his daughter must be punished by death--if not by the death of\nthe chief offender, then by that of the one who stood nearest to him.\nThus was Jean Adet the miller dragged from his home and cast into\nprison. Was he not implicated himself in the riots? Camille the bailiff\nhad seen and heard him among the insurgents on the hillock that night.\nAt first it was stated that he would be held as hostage for the\nreappearance of his son. But Pierre Adet had evidently fled the\ncountryside: he was obviously ignorant of the terrible fate which his\nown folly had brought upon his father. Many thought that he had gone to\nseek his fortune in Paris where his talents and erudition would ensure\nhim a good place in the present mad rush for equality amongst all men.\nCertain it is that he did not return and that with merciless hate and\nvengeful relentlessness M. le duc de Kernogan had Jean Adet hanged for a\nsupposed crime said to be committed by his son.\n\nJean Adet died protesting his innocence. But the outburst of indignation\nand revolt aroused by this crying injustice was swamped by the torrent\nof the revolution which, gathering force by these very acts of tyranny\nand of injustice, soon swept innocent and guilty alike into a vast\nwhirlpool of blood and shame and tears.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ONE: BATH, 1793\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE MOOR\n\n\nI\n\nSilence.

And I am wet--ah! wet to my skin in this\n_sacr\u00c3\u00a9_ fog of yours.\"\n\nThe other made no reply. Indeed he seemed little inclined for\nconversation: his whole attention appeared to be riveted on the business\nof keeping in his saddle, and holding his horse's head turned in the\ndirection in which he wished it to go: he was riding a yard or two ahead\nof his companion, and it did not need any assurance on his part that he\nwas no horseman: he sat very loosely in his saddle, his broad shoulders\nbent, his head thrust forward, his knees turned out, his hands clinging\nalternately to the reins and to the pommel with that ludicrous\ninconsequent gesture peculiar to those who are wholly unaccustomed to\nhorse exercise.\n\nHis attitude, in fact, as well as the promiscuous set of clothes which\nhe wore--a labourer's smock, a battered high hat, threadbare corduroys\nand fisherman's boots--at once suggested the loafer, the do-nothing who\nhangs round the yards of half-way houses and posting inns on the chance\nof earning a few coppers by an easy job which does not entail too much\nexertion on his part and which will not take him too far from his\nfavourite haunts. When he spoke--which was not often--the soft burr in\nthe pronunciation of the sibilants betrayed the Westcountryman.\n\nHis companion, on the other hand, was obviously a stranger: high of\nstature, and broadly built, his wide shoulders and large hands and feet,\nhis square head set upon a short thick neck, all bespoke the physique of\na labouring man, whilst his town-made clothes--his heavy caped coat,\nadmirably tailored, his buckskin breeches and boots of fine\nleather--suggested, if not absolutely the gentleman, at any rate one\nbelonging to the well-to-do classes. Though obviously not quite so\ninexperienced in the saddle as the other man appeared to be, he did not\nlook very much at home in the saddle either: he held himself very rigid\nand upright and squared his shoulders with a visible effort at seeming\nat ease, like a townsman out for a constitutional on the fashionable\npromenade of his own city, or a cavalry subaltern but lately emerged\nfrom a riding school. He spoke English quite fluently, even\ncolloquially at times, but with a marked Gallic accent.\n\n\nII\n\nThe road along which the two cavaliers were riding was unspeakably\nlonely and desolate--an offshoot from the main Bath to Weston road. It\nhad been quite a good secondary road once. The accounts of the county\nadministration under date 1725 go to prove that it was completed in that\nyear at considerable expense and with stone brought over for the purpose\nall the way from Draycott quarries, and for twenty years after that a\ncoach used to ply along it between Chelwood and Redhill as well as two\nor three carriers, and of course there was all the traffic in connexion\nwith the Stanton markets and the Norton Fairs. But that was nigh on\nfifty years ago now, and somehow--once the mail-coach was\ndiscontinued--it had never seemed worth while to keep the road in decent\nrepair. It had gone from bad to worse since then, and travelling on it\nthese days either ahorse or afoot had become very unpleasant. It was\nfull of ruts and crevasses and knee-deep in mud, as the stranger had\nvery appositely remarked, and the stone parapet which bordered it on\neither side, and which had once given it such an air of solidity and of\nvalue, was broken down in very many places and threatened soon to\ndisappear altogether.\n\nThe country round was as lonely and desolate as the road. And that sense\nof desolation seemed to pervade the very atmosphere right through the\ndarkness which had descended on upland and valley and hill. Though\nnothing now could be seen through the gloom and the mist, the senses\nwere conscious that even in broad daylight there would be nothing to\nsee. Loneliness dwelt in the air as well as upon the moor. There were no\nhomesteads for miles around, no cattle grazing, no pastures, no hedges,\nnothing--just arid wasteland with here and there a group of stunted\ntrees or an isolated yew, and tracts of rough, coarse grass not nearly\ngood enough for cattle to eat.\n\nThere are vast stretches of upland equally desolate in many parts of\nEurope--notably in Northern Spain--but in England, where they are rare,\nthey seem to gain an additional air of loneliness through the very life\nwhich pulsates in their vicinity. This bit of Somersetshire was one of\nthem in this year of grace 1793. Despite the proximity of Bath and its\nfashionable life, its gaieties and vitality, distant only a little over\ntwenty miles, and of Bristol distant less than thirty, it had remained\nwild and forlorn, almost savage in its grim isolation, primitive in the\ngrandeur of its solitude.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe road at the point now reached by the travellers begins to slope in a\ngentle gradient down to the level of the Chew, a couple of miles further\non: it was midway down this slope that the only sign of living humanity\ncould be perceived in that tiny light which glimmered persistently. The\nair itself under its mantle of fog had become very still, only the water\nof some tiny moorland stream murmured feebly in its stony bed ere it\nlost its entity in the bosom of the river far away.\n\n\"Five more minutes and we be at th' Bottom Inn,\" quoth the man who was\nahead in response to another impatient ejaculation from his companion.\n\n\"If we don't break our necks meanwhile in this confounded darkness,\"\nretorted the other, for his horse had just stumbled and the\ninexperienced rider had been very nearly pitched over into the mud.\n\n\"I be as anxious to arrive as you are, Mounzeer,\" observed the\ncountryman laconically.\n\n\"I thought you knew the way,\" muttered the stranger.\n\n\"'Ave I not brought you safely through the darkness?\" retorted the\nother; \"you was pretty well ztranded at Chelwood, Mounzeer, or I be much\nmistaken. Who else would 'ave brought you out 'ere at this time o'\nnight, I'd like to know--and in this weather too? You wanted to get to\nth' Bottom Inn and didn't know 'ow to zet about it: none o' the gaffers\nup to Chelwood 'peared eager to 'elp you when I come along. Well, I've\nbrought you to th' Bottom Inn and.... Whoa! Whoa! my beauty! Whoa,\nconfound you! Whoa!\"\n\nAnd for the next moment or two the whole of his attention had perforce\nto be concentrated on the business of sticking to his saddle whilst he\nbrought his fagged-out, ill-conditioned nag to a standstill.\n\nThe little glimmer of light had suddenly revealed itself in the shape of\na lanthorn hung inside the wooden porch of a small house which had\nloomed out of the darkness and the fog. It stood at an angle of the road\nwhere a narrow lane had its beginnings ere it plunged into the moor\nbeyond and was swallowed up by the all-enveloping gloom. The house was\nsmall and ugly; square like a box and built of grey stone, its front\nflush with the road, its rear flanked by several small outbuildings.\nAbove the porch hung a plain sign-board bearing the legend: \"The Bottom\nInn\" in white letters upon a black ground: to right and left of the\nporch there was a window with closed shutters, and on the floor above\ntwo more windows--also shuttered--completed the architectural features\nof the Bottom Inn.\n\nIt was uncompromisingly ugly and uninviting, for beyond the faint\nglimmer of the lanthorn only one or two narrow streaks of light\nfiltrated through the chinks of the shutters.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe travellers, after some difference of opinion with their respective\nhorses, contrived to pull up and to dismount without any untoward\naccident. The stranger looked about him, peering into the darkness. The\nplace indeed appeared dismal and inhospitable enough: its solitary\naspect suggested footpads and the abode of cut-throats. The silence of\nthe moor, the pall of mist and gloom that hung over upland and valley\nsent a shiver through his spine.\n\n\"You are sure this is the place?\" he queried.\n\n\"Can't ye zee the zign?\" retorted the other gruffly.\n\n\"Can you hold the horses while I go in?\"\n\n\"I doan't know as 'ow I can, Mounzeer. I've never 'eld two 'orzes all at\nonce. Suppose they was to start kickin' or thought o' runnin' away?\"\n\n\"Running away, you fool!\" muttered the stranger, whose temper had\nevidently suffered grievously during the weary, cold journey from\nChelwood. \"I'll break your _satan\u00c3\u00a9_ head if anything happens to the\nbeasts. How can I get back to Bath save the way I came? Do you think I\nwant to spend the night in this God-forsaken hole?\"\n\nWithout waiting to hear any further protests from the lout, he turned\ninto the porch and with his riding whip gave three consecutive raps\nagainst the door of the inn, followed by two more. The next moment there\nwas the sound of a rattling of bolts and chains, the door was cautiously\nopened and a timid voice queried:\n\n\"Is it Mounzeer?\"\n\n\"Pardieu! Who else?\" growled the stranger. \"Open the door, woman. I am\nperished with cold.\"\n\nWith an unceremonious kick he pushed the door further open and strode\nin. A woman was standing in the dimly lighted passage. As the stranger\nwalked in she bobbed him a respectful curtsey.\n\n\"It is all right, Mounzeer,\" she said; \"the Captain's in the\ncoffee-room. He came over from Bristol early this afternoon.\"\n\n\"No one else here, I hope,\" he queried curtly.\n\n\"No one, zir. It ain't their hour not yet. You'll 'ave the 'ouse to\nyourself till after midnight. After that there'll be a bustle, I reckon.\nTwo shiploads come into Watchet last night--brandy and cloth, Mounzeer,\nso the Captain says, and worth a mint o' money. The pack 'orzes will be\nthrough yere in the small hours.\"\n\n\"That's all right, then. Send me in a bite and a mug of hot ale.\"\n\n\"I'll see to it, Mounzeer.\"\n\n\"And stay--have you some sort of stabling where the man can put the two\nhorses up for an hour's rest?\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, zir.\"\n\n\"Very well then, see to that too: and see that the horses get a feed and\na drink and give the man something to eat.\"\n\n\"Very good, Mounzeer. This way, zir. I'll see the man presently.\nStraight down the passage, zir. The coffee-room is on the right. The\nCaptain's there, waiting for ye.\"\n\nShe closed the front door carefully, then followed the stranger to the\ndoor of the coffee-room. Outside an anxious voice was heard muttering a\nstring of inconsequent and wholly superfluous \"Whoa's!\" Of a truth the\ntwo wearied nags were only too anxious for a little rest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE BOTTOM INN\n\n\nI\n\nA man was sitting, huddled up in the ingle-nook of the small\ncoffee-room, sipping hot ale from a tankard which he had in his hand.\n\nAnything less suggestive of a rough sea-faring life than his appearance\nit would be difficult to conceive; and how he came by the appellation\n\"the Captain\" must for ever remain a mystery. He was small and spare,\nwith thin delicate face and slender hands: though dressed in very rough\ngarments, he was obviously ill at ease in them; his narrow shoulders\nscarcely appeared able to bear the weight of the coarsely made coat, and\nhis thin legs did not begin to fill the big fisherman's boots which\nreached midway up his lean thighs. His hair was lank and plentifully\nsprinkled with grey: he wore it tied at the nape of the neck with a silk\nbow which certainly did not harmonise with the rest of his clothing. A\nwide-brimmed felt hat something the shape of a sailor's, but with higher\ncrown--of the shape worn by the peasantry in Brittany--lay on the bench\nbeside him.\n\nWhen the stranger entered he had greeted him curtly, speaking in French.\n\nThe room was inexpressibly stuffy, and reeked of the fumes of stale\ntobacco, stale victuals and stale beer; but it was warm, and the\nstranger, stiff to the marrow and wet to the skin, uttered an\nexclamation of well-being as he turned to the hearth, wherein a bright\nfire burned cheerily. He had put his hat down when first he entered and\nhad divested himself of his big coat: now he held one foot and then the\nother to the blaze and tried to infuse new life into his numbed hands.\n\n\"The Captain\" took scant notice of his comings and goings. He did not\nattempt to help him off with his coat, nor did he make an effort to add\nanother log to the fire. He sat silent and practically motionless, save\nwhen from time to time he took a sip out of his mug of ale. But whenever\nthe new-comer came within his immediate circle of vision he shot a\nglance at the latter's elegant attire--the well-cut coat, the striped\nwaistcoat, the boots of fine leather--the glance was quick and\ncomprehensive and full of scorn, a flash that lasted only an instant and\nwas at once veiled again by the droop of the flaccid lids which hid the\npale, keen eyes.\n\n\"When the woman has brought me something to eat and drink,\" the stranger\nsaid after a while, \"we can talk. I have a good hour to spare, as those\nmiserable nags must have some rest.\"\n\nHe too spoke in French and with an air of authority, not to say\narrogance, which caused \"the Captain's\" glance of scorn to light up with\nan added gleam of hate and almost of cruelty. But he made no remark and\ncontinued to sip his ale in silence, and for the next half-hour the two\nmen took no more notice of one another, just as if they had never\ntravelled all those miles and come to this desolate spot for the sole\npurpose of speaking with one another. During the course of that\nhalf-hour the woman brought in a dish of mutton stew, a chunk of bread,\na piece of cheese and a jug of spiced ale, and placed them on the table:\nall of these good things the stranger consumed with an obviously keen\nappetite. When he had eaten and drunk his fill, he rose from the table,\ndrew a bench into the ingle-nook and sat down so that his profile only\nwas visible to his friend \"the Captain.\"\n\n\"Now, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said with at attempt at ease and\nfamiliarity not unmixed with condescension, \"I am ready for your news.\"\n\n\nII\n\nChauvelin had winced perceptibly both at the condescension and the\nfamiliarity. It was such a very little while ago that men had trembled\nat a look, a word from him: his silence had been wont to strike terror\nin quaking hearts. It was such a very little while ago that he had been\npresident of the Committee of Public Safety, all powerful, the right\nhand of citizen Robespierre, the master sleuth-hound who could track an\nunfortunate \"suspect\" down to his most hidden lair, before whose keen,\npale eyes the innermost secrets of a soul stood revealed, who guessed at\ntreason ere it was wholly born, who scented treachery ere it was\nformulated. A year ago he had with a word sent scores of men, women and\nchildren to the guillotine--he had with a sign brought the whole\nmachinery of the ruthless Committee to work against innocent or guilty\nalike on mere suspicion, or to gratify his own hatred against all those\nwhom he considered to be the enemies of that bloody revolution which he\nhad helped to make. Now his presence, his silence, had not even the\npower to ruffle the self-assurance of an upstart.\n\nBut in the hard school both of success and of failure through which he\nhad passed during the last decade, there was one lesson which Armand\nonce Marquis de Chauvelin had learned to the last letter, and that was\nthe lesson of self-control. He had winced at the other's familiarity,\nbut neither by word nor gesture did he betray what he felt.\n\n\"I can tell you,\" he merely said quite curtly, \"all I have to say in far\nless time than it has taken you to eat and drink, citizen Adet....\"\n\nBut suddenly, at sound of that name, the other had put a warning hand on\nChauvelin's arm, even as he cast a rapid, anxious look all round the\nnarrow room.\n\n\"Hush, man!\" he murmured hurriedly, \"you know quite well that that name\nmust never be pronounced here in England. I am Martin-Roget now,\" he\nadded, as he shook off his momentary fright with equal suddenness, and\nonce more resumed his tone of easy condescension, \"and try not to forget\nit.\"\n\nChauvelin without any haste quietly freed his arm from the other's\ngrasp. His pale face was quite expressionless, only the thin lips were\ndrawn tightly over the teeth now, and a curious hissing sound escaped\nfaintly from them as he said:\n\n\"I'll try and remember, citizen, that here in England you are an aristo,\nthe same as all these confounded English whom may the devil sweep into a\nbottomless sea.\"\n\nMartin-Roget gave a short, complacent laugh.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said lightly, \"no wonder you hate them, citizen Chauvelin. You\ntoo were an aristo here in England once--not so very long ago, I am\nthinking--special envoy to His Majesty King George, what?--until failure\nto bring one of these _satan\u00c3\u00a9_ Britishers to book made you ... er ...\nwell, made you what you are now.\"\n\nHe drew up his tall, broad figure as he spoke and squared his massive\nshoulders as he looked down with a fatuous smile and no small measure of\nscorn on the hunched-up little figure beside him. It had seemed to him\nthat something in the nature of a threat had crept into Chauvelin's\nattitude, and he, still flushed with his own importance, his\nimmeasurable belief in himself, at once chose to measure his strength\nagainst this man who was the personification of failure and\ndisgrace--this man whom so many people had feared for so long and whom\nit might not be wise to defy even now.\n\n\"No offence meant, citizen Chauvelin,\" he added with an air of patronage\nwhich once more made the other wince. \"I had no wish to wound your\nsusceptibilities. I only desired to give you timely warning that what I\ndo here is no one's concern, and that I will brook interference and\ncriticism from no man.\"\n\nAnd Chauvelin, who in the past had oft with a nod sent a man to the\nguillotine, made no reply to this arrogant taunt. His small figure\nseemed to shrink still further within itself: and anon he passed his\nthin, claw-like hand over his face as if to obliterate from its surface\nany expression which might war with the utter humility wherewith he now\nspoke.\n\n\"Nor was there any offence meant on my part, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he\nsaid suavely. \"Do we not both labour for the same end? The glory of the\nRepublic and the destruction of her foes?\"\n\nMartin-Roget gave a sigh of satisfaction. The battle had been won: he\nfelt himself strong again--stronger than before through that very act of\ndeference paid to him by the once all-powerful Chauvelin. Now he was\nquite prepared to be condescending and jovial once again:\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" he said pleasantly, as he once more bent his\ntall figure to the fire. \"We are both servants of the Republic, and I\nmay yet help you to retrieve your past failures, citizen, by giving you\nan active part in the work I have in hand. And now,\" he added in a calm,\nbusiness-like manner, the manner of a master addressing a servant who\nhas been found at fault and is taken into favour again, \"let me hear\nyour news.\"\n\n\"I have made all the arrangements about the ship,\" said Chauvelin\nquietly.\n\n\"Ah! that is good news indeed. What is she?\"\n\n\"She is a Dutch ship. Her master and crew are all Dutch....\"\n\n\"That's a pity. A Danish master and crew would have been safer.\"\n\n\"I could not come across any Danish ship willing to take the risks,\"\nsaid Chauvelin dryly.\n\n\"Well! And what about this Dutch ship then?\"\n\n\"She is called the _Hollandia_ and is habitually engaged in the sugar\ntrade: but her master does a lot of contraband--more that than fair\ntrading, I imagine: anyway, he is willing for the sum you originally\nnamed to take every risk and incidentally to hold his tongue about the\nwhole business.\"\n\n\"For two thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he will run the _Hollandia_ into Le Croisic?\"\n\n\"When you command.\"\n\n\"And there is suitable accommodation on board her for a lady and her\nwoman?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you call suitable,\" said Chauvelin with a sarcastic\ntone, which the other failed or was unwilling to note, \"and I don't know\nwhat you call a lady. The accommodation available on board the\n_Hollandia_ will be sufficient for two men and two women.\"\n\n\"And her master's name?\" queried Martin-Roget.\n\n\"Some outlandish Dutch name,\" replied Chauvelin. \"It is spelt\nK\u00c2\u00a0U\u00c2\u00a0Y\u00c2\u00a0P\u00c2\u00a0E\u00c2\u00a0R. The devil only knows how it is pronounced.\"\n\n\"Well! And does Captain  K\u00c2\u00a0U\u00c2\u00a0Y\u00c2\u00a0P\u00c2\u00a0E\u00c2\u00a0R understand exactly what I want?\"\n\n\"He says he does. The _Hollandia_ will put into Portishead on the last\nday of this month. You and your guests can get aboard her any day after\nthat you choose. She will be there at your disposal, and can start\nwithin an hour of your getting aboard. Her master will have all his\npapers ready. He will have a cargo of West Indian sugar on\nboard--destination Amsterdam, consignee Mynheer van Smeer--everything\nperfectly straight and square. French aristos, _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ on board on\ntheir way to join the army of the Princes. There will be no difficulty\nin England.\"\n\n\"And none in Le Croisic. The man is running no risks.\"\n\n\"He thinks he is. France does not make Dutch ships and Dutch crews\nexactly welcome just now, does she?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. But in Le Croisic and with citizen Adet on board....\"\n\n\"I thought that name was not to be mentioned here,\" retorted Chauvelin\ndryly.\n\n\"You are right, citizen,\" whispered the other, \"it escaped me and....\"\n\nAlready he had jumped to his feet, his face suddenly pale, his whole\nmanner changed from easy, arrogant self-assurance to uncertainty and\nobvious dread. He moved to the window, trying to subdue the sound of his\nfootsteps upon the uneven floor.\n\n\nIII\n\n\"Are you afraid of eavesdroppers, citizen Roget?\" queried Chauvelin with\na shrug of his narrow shoulders.\n\n\"No. There is no one there. Only a lout from Chelwood who brought me\nhere. The people of the house are safe enough. They have plenty of\nsecrets of their own to keep.\"\n\nHe was obviously saying all this in order to reassure himself, for there\nwas no doubt that his fears were on the alert. With a febrile gesture he\nunfastened the shutters, and pushed them open, peering out into the\nnight.\n\n\"Hallo!\" he called.\n\nBut he received no answer.\n\n\"It has started to rain,\" he said more calmly. \"I imagine that lout has\nfound shelter in an outhouse with the horses.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" commented Chauvelin laconically.\n\n\"Then if you have nothing more to tell me,\" quoth Martin-Roget, \"I may\nas well think about getting back. Rain or no rain, I want to be in Bath\nbefore midnight.\"\n\n\"Ball or supper-party at one of your duchesses?\" queried the other with\na sneer. \"I know them.\"\n\nTo this Martin-Roget vouchsafed no reply.\n\n\"How are things at Nantes?\" he asked.\n\n\"Splendid! Carrier is like a wild beast let loose. The prisons are\nover-full: the surplus of accused, condemned and suspect fills the\ncellars and warehouses along the wharf. Priests and suchlike trash are\nkept on disused galliots up stream. The guillotine is never idle, and\nfriend Carrier fearing that she might give out--get tired, what?--or\nbreak down--has invented a wonderful way of getting rid of shoals of\nundesirable people at one magnificent swoop. You have heard tell of it\nno doubt.\"\n\n\"Yes. I have heard of it,\" remarked the other curtly.\n\n\"He began with a load of priests. Requisitioned an old barge. Ordered\nBaudet the shipbuilder to construct half a dozen portholes in her\nbottom. Baudet demurred: he could not understand what the order could\npossibly mean. But Foucaud and Lamberty--Carrier's agents--you know\nthem--explained that the barge would be towed down the Loire and then\nup one of the smaller navigable streams which it was feared the\nroyalists were preparing to use as a way for making a descent upon\nNantes, and that the idea was to sink the barge in midstream in order to\nobstruct the passage of their army. Baudet, satisfied, put five of his\nmen to the task. Everything was ready on the 16th of last month. I know\nthe woman Pichot, who keeps a small tavern opposite La S\u00c3\u00a9cherie. She saw\nthe barge glide up the river toward the galliot where twenty-five\npriests of the diocese of Nantes had been living for the past two months\nin the company of rats and other vermin as noxious as themselves. Most\nlovely moonlight there was that night. The Loire looked like a living\nribbon of silver. Foucaud and Lamberty directed operations, and Carrier\nhad given them full instructions. They tied the calotins up two and two\nand transferred them from the galliot to the barge. It seems they were\nquite pleased to go. Had enough of the rats, I presume. The only thing\nthey didn't like was being searched. Some had managed to secrete silver\nornaments about their person when they were arrested. Crucifixes and\nsuch like. They didn't like to part with these, it seems. But Foucaud\nand Lamberty relieved them of everything but the necessary clothing, and\nthey didn't want much of that, seeing whither they were going. Foucaud\nmade a good pile, so they say. Self-seeking, avaricious brute! He'll\nlearn the way to one of Carrier's barges too one day, I'll bet.\"\n\nHe rose and with quick footsteps moved to the table. There was some ale\nleft in the jug which the woman had brought for Martin-Roget a while\nago. Chauvelin poured the contents of it down his throat. He had talked\nuninterruptedly, in short, jerky sentences, without the slightest\nexpression of horror at the atrocities which he recounted. His whole\nappearance had become transfigured while he spoke. Gone was the urbane\nmanner which he had learnt at courts long ago, gone was the last\ninstinct of the gentleman sunk to proletarianism through stress of\ncircumstances, or financial straits or even political convictions. The\nerstwhile Marquis de Chauvelin--envoy of the Republic at the Court of\nSt. James'--had become citizen Chauvelin in deed and in fact, a part of\nthat rabble which he had elected to serve, one of that vile crowd of\nbloodthirsty revolutionaries who had sullied the pure robes of Liberty\nand of Fraternity by spattering them with blood. Now he smacked his\nlips, wiped his mouth with his sleeve, and burying his hands in the\npockets of his breeches he stood with legs wide apart and a look of\nsavage satisfaction settled upon his pale face. Martin-Roget had made no\ncomment upon the narrative. He had resumed his seat by the fire and was\nlistening attentively. Now while the other drank and paused, he showed\nno sign of impatience, but there was something in the look of the bent\nshoulders, in the rigidity of the attitude, in the large, square hands\ntightly clasped together which suggested the deepest interest and an\nintentness that was almost painful.\n\n\"I was at the woman Pichot's tavern that night,\" resumed Chauvelin after\na while. \"I saw the barge--a moving coffin, what?--gliding down stream\ntowed by the galliot and escorted by a small boat. The floating battery\nat La Samaritaine challenged her as she passed, for Carrier had\nprohibited all navigation up or down the Loire until further notice.\nFoucaud, Lamberty, Fouquet and O'Sullivan the armourer were in the boat:\nthey rowed up to the pontoon and Vailly the chief gunner of the battery\nchallenged them once more. However, they had some sort of written\nauthorisation from Carrier, for they were allowed to pass. Vailly\nremained on guard. He saw the barge glide further down stream. It seems\nthat the moon at that time was hidden by a cloud. But the night was not\ndark and Vailly watched the barge till she was out of sight. She was\ntowed past Trentemoult and Chantenay into the wide reach of the river\njust below Chevir\u00c3\u00a9 where, as you know, the Loire is nearly two thousand\nfeet wide.\"\n\nOnce more he paused, looking down with grim amusement on the bent\nshoulders of the other man.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nChauvelin laughed. The query sounded choked and hoarse, whether through\nhorror, excitement or mere impatient curiosity it were impossible to\nsay.\n\n\"Well!\" he retorted with a careless shrug of the shoulders. \"I was too\nfar up stream to see anything and Vailly saw nothing either. But he\nheard. So did others who happened to be on the shore close by.\"\n\n\"What did they hear?\"\n\n\"The hammering,\" replied Chauvelin curtly, \"when the portholes were\nknocked open to let in the flood of water. And the screams and yells of\nfive and twenty drowning priests.\"\n\n\"Not one of them escaped, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\nOnce more Chauvelin laughed. He had a way of laughing--just like\nthat--in a peculiar mirthless, derisive manner, as if with joy at\nanother man's discomfiture, at another's material or moral downfall.\nThere is only one language in the world which has a word to express that\ntype of mirth; the word is _Schadenfreude_.\n\nIt was Chauvelin's turn to triumph now. He had distinctly perceived the\nsigns of an inward shudder which had gone right through Martin-Roget's\nspine: he had also perceived through the man's bent shoulders, his\nsilence, his rigidity that his soul was filled with horror at the story\nof that abominable crime which he--Chauvelin--had so blandly retailed\nand that he was afraid to show the horror which he felt. And the man who\nis afraid can never climb the ladder of success above the man who is\nfearless.\n\n\nIV\n\nThere was silence in the low raftered room for awhile: silence only\nbroken by the crackling and sizzling of damp logs in the hearth, and the\ntap-tapping of a loosely fastened shutter which sounded weird and\nghoulish like the knocking of ghosts against the window-frame.\nMartin-Roget bending still closer to the fire knew that Chauvelin was\nwatching him and that Chauvelin had triumphed, for--despite failure,\ndespite humiliation and disgrace--that man's heart and will had never\nsoftened: he had remained as merciless, as fanatical, as before and\nstill looked upon every sign of pity and humanity for a victim of that\nbloody revolution--which was his child, the thing of his creation, yet\nworshipped by him, its creator--as a crime against patriotism and\nagainst the Republic.\n\nAnd Martin-Roget fought within himself lest something he might say or\ndo, a look, a gesture should give the other man an indication that the\nhorrible account of a hideous crime perpetrated against twenty-five\ndefenceless men had roused a feeling of unspeakable horror in his heart.\nThat was the punishment of these callous makers of a ruthless\nrevolution--that was their hell upon earth, that they were doomed to\nhate and to fear one another; every man feeling that the other's hand\nwas up against him as it had been against law and order, against the\nguilty and the innocent, the rebel and the defenceless; every man\nknowing that the other was always there on the alert, ready to pounce\nlike a beast of prey upon any victim--friend, comrade, brother--who came\nwithin reach of his hand.\n\nLike many men stronger than himself, Pierre Adet--or Martin-Roget as he\nnow called himself--had been drawn into the vortex of bloodshed and of\ntyranny out of which now he no longer had the power to extricate\nhimself. Nor had he any wish to extricate himself. He had too many past\nwrongs to avenge, too much injustice on the part of Fate and\nCircumstance to make good, to wish to draw back now that a newly-found\npower had been placed in the hands of men such as he through the revolt\nof an entire people. The sickening sense of horror which a moment ago\nhad caused him to shudder and to turn away in loathing from Chauvelin\nwas only like the feeble flicker of a light before it wholly dies\ndown--the light of something purer, early lessons of childhood, former\nideals, earlier aspirations, now smothered beneath the passions of\nrevenge and of hate.\n\nAnd he would not give Chauvelin the satisfaction of seeing him wince. He\nwas himself ashamed of his own weakness. He had deliberately thrown in\nhis lot with these men and he was determined not to fall a victim to\ntheir denunciations and to their jealousies. So now he made a great\neffort to pull himself together, to bring back before his mind those\nmemory-pictures of past tyranny and oppression which had effectually\nkilled all sense of pity in his heart, and it was in a tone of perfect\nindifference which gave no loophole to Chauvelin's sneers that he asked\nafter awhile:\n\n\"And was citizen Carrier altogether pleased with the result of his\npatriotic efforts?\"\n\n\"Oh, quite!\" replied the other. \"He has no one's orders to take. He is\nproconsul--virtual dictator in Nantes: and he has vowed that he will\npurge the city from all save its most deserving citizens. The cargo of\npriests was followed by one of malefactors, night-birds, cut-throats and\nsuch like. That is where Carrier's patriotism shines out in all its\nglory. It is not only priests and aristos, you see--other miscreants are\ntreated with equal fairness.\"\n\n\"Yes! I see he is quite impartial,\" remarked Martin-Roget coolly.\n\n\"Quite,\" retorted Chauvelin, as he once more sat down in the ingle-nook.\nAnd, leaning his elbows upon his knees he looked straight and\ndeliberately into the other man's face, and added slowly: \"You will have\nno cause to complain of Carrier's want of patriotism when you hand over\nyour bag of birds to him.\"\n\nThis time Martin-Roget had obviously winced, and Chauvelin had the\nsatisfaction of seeing that his thrust had gone home: though\nMartin-Roget's face was in shadow, there was something now in his whole\nattitude, in the clasping and unclasping of his large, square hands\nwhich indicated that the man was labouring under the stress of a violent\nemotion. In spite of this he managed to say quite coolly: \"What do you\nmean exactly by that, citizen Chauvelin?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied the other, \"you know well enough what I mean--I am no\nfool, what?... or the Revolution would have no use for me. If after my\nmany failures she still commands my services and employs me to keep my\neyes and ears open, it is because she knows that she can count on me. I\ndo keep my eyes and ears open, citizen Adet or Martin-Roget, whatever\nyou like to call yourself, and also my mind--and I have a way of putting\ntwo and two together to make four. There are few people in Nantes who do\nnot know that old Jean Adet, the miller, was hanged four years ago,\nbecause his son Pierre had taken part in some kind of open revolt\nagainst the tyranny of the ci-devant duc de Kernogan, and was not there\nto take his punishment himself. I knew old Jean Adet.... I was on the\nPlace du Bouffay at Nantes when he was hanged....\"\n\nBut already Martin-Roget had jumped to his feet with a muttered\nblasphemy.\n\n\"Have done, man,\" he said roughly, \"have done!\" And he started pacing up\nand down the narrow room like a caged panther, snarling and showing his\nteeth, whilst his rough, toil-worn hands quivered with the desire to\nclutch an unseen enemy by the throat and to squeeze the life out of him.\n\"Think you,\" he added hoarsely, \"that I need reminding of that?\"\n\n\"No. I do not think that, citizen,\" replied Chauvelin calmly, \"I only\ndesired to warn you.\"\n\n\"Warn me? Of what?\"\n\nNervous, agitated, restless, Martin-Roget had once more gone back to his\nseat: his hands were trembling as he held them up mechanically to the\nblaze and his face was the colour of lead. In contrast with his\nrestlessness Chauvelin appeared the more calm and bland.\n\n\"Why should you wish to warn me?\" asked the other querulously, but with\nan attempt at his former over-bearing manner. \"What are my affairs to\nyou--what do you know about them?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing, citizen Martin-Roget,\" replied Chauvelin\npleasantly, \"I was only indulging the fancy I spoke to you about just\nnow of putting two and two together in order to make four. The\nchartering of a smuggler's craft--aristos on board her--her ostensible\ndestination Holland--her real objective Le Croisic.... Le Croisic is now\nthe port for Nantes and we don't bring aristos into Nantes these days\nfor the object of providing them with a feather-bed and a competence,\nwhat?\"\n\n\"And,\" retorted Martin-Roget quietly, \"if your surmises are correct,\ncitizen Chauvelin, what then?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing!\" replied the other indifferently. \"Only ... take care,\ncitizen ... that is all.\"\n\n\"Take care of what?\"\n\n\"Of the man who brought me, Chauvelin, to ruin and disgrace.\"\n\n\"Oh! I have heard of that legend before now,\" said Martin-Roget with a\ncontemptuous shrug of the shoulders. \"The man they call the Scarlet\nPimpernel you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, yes!\"\n\n\"What have I to do with him?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But remember that I myself have twice been after that man\nhere in England; that twice he slipped through my fingers when I thought\nI held him so tightly that he could not possibly escape and that twice\nin consequence I was brought to humiliation and to shame. I am a marked\nman now--the guillotine will soon claim me for her future use. Your\naffairs, citizen, are no concern of mine, but I have marked that Scarlet\nPimpernel for mine own. I won't have any blunderings on your part give\nhim yet another triumph over us all.\"\n\nOnce more Martin-Roget swore one of his favourite oaths.\n\n\"By Satan and all his brood, man,\" he cried in a passion of fury, \"have\ndone with this interference. Have done, I say. I have nothing to do, I\ntell you, with your _satan\u00c3\u00a9_ Scarlet Pimpernel. My concern is with....\"\n\n\"With the duc de Kernogan,\" broke in Chauvelin calmly, \"and with his\ndaughter; I know that well enough. You want to be even with them over\nthe murder of your father. I know that too. All that is your affair.\nBut beware, I tell you. To begin with, the secrecy of your identity is\nabsolutely essential to the success of your plan. What?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. But....\"\n\n\"But nevertheless, your identity is known to the most astute, the\nkeenest enemy of the Republic.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" asserted Martin-Roget hotly.\n\n\"The duc de Kernogan....\"\n\n\"Bah! He had never the slightest suspicion of me. Think you his High and\nMightiness in those far-off days ever looked twice at a village lad so\nthat he would know him again four years later? I came into this country\nas an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_ stowed away in a smuggler's ship like a bundle of\ncontraband goods. I have papers to prove that my name is Martin-Roget\nand that I am a banker from Brest. The worthy bishop of Brest--denounced\nto the Committee of Public Safety for treason against the Republic--was\ngiven his life and a safe conduct into Spain on the condition that he\ngave me--Martin-Roget--letters of personal introduction to various\nhigh-born _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ in Holland, in Germany and in England. Armed with\nthese I am invulnerable. I have been presented to His Royal Highness the\nRegent, and to the \u00c3\u00a9lite of English society in Bath. I am the friend of\nM. le duc de Kernogan now and the accredited suitor for his daughter's\nhand.\"\n\n\"His daughter!\" broke in Chauvelin with a sneer, and his pale, keen eyes\nhad in them a spark of malicious mockery.\n\nMartin-Roget made no immediate retort to the sneer. A curious hot flush\nhad spread over his forehead and his ears, leaving his cheeks wan and\nlivid.\n\n\"What about the daughter?\" reiterated Chauvelin.\n\n\"Yvonne de Kernogan has never seen Pierre Adet the miller's son,\"\nreplied the other curtly. \"She is now the affianced wife of\nMartin-Roget the millionaire banker of Brest. To-night I shall persuade\nM. le duc to allow my marriage with his daughter to take place within\nthe week. I shall plead pressing business in Holland and my desire that\nmy wife shall accompany me thither. The duke will consent and Yvonne de\nKernogan will not be consulted. The day after my wedding I shall be on\nboard the _Hollandia_ with my wife and father-in-law, and together we\nwill be on our way to Nantes where Carrier will deal with them both.\"\n\n\"You are quite satisfied that this plan of yours is known to no one,\nthat no one at the present moment is aware of the fact that Pierre Adet,\nthe miller's son, and Martin-Roget, banker of Brest, are one and the\nsame?\"\n\n\"Quite satisfied,\" replied Martin-Roget emphatically.\n\n\"Very well, then, let me tell you this, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin\nslowly and deliberately, \"that in spite of what you say I am as\nconvinced as that I am here, alive, that your real identity will be\nknown--if it is not known already--to a gentleman who is at this present\nmoment in Bath, and who is known to you, to me, to the whole of France\nas the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nMartin-Roget laughed and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Impossible!\" he retorted. \"Pierre Adet no longer exists ... he never\nexisted ... much.... Anyhow, he ceased to be on that stormy day in\nSeptember, 1789. Unless your pet enemy is a wizard he cannot know.\"\n\n\"There is nothing that my pet enemy--as you call him--cannot ferret out\nif he has a mind to. Beware of him, citizen Martin-Roget. Beware, I tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"How can I,\" laughed the other contemptuously, \"if I don't know who he\nis?\"\n\n\"If you did,\" retorted Chauvelin, \"it wouldn't help you ... much. But\nbeware of every man you don't know; beware of every stranger you meet;\ntrust no one; above all, follow no one. He is there where you least\nexpect him under a disguise you would scarcely dream of.\"\n\n\"Tell me who he is then--since you know him--so that I may duly beware\nof him.\"\n\n\"No,\" rejoined Chauvelin with the same slow deliberation, \"I will not\ntell you who he is. Knowledge in this case would be a very dangerous\nthing.\"\n\n\"Dangerous? To whom?\"\n\n\"To yourself probably. To me and to the Republic most undoubtedly. No! I\nwill not tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is. But take my advice,\ncitizen Martin-Roget,\" he added emphatically, \"go back to Paris or to\nNantes and strive there to serve your country rather than run your head\ninto a noose by meddling with things here in England, and running after\nyour own schemes of revenge.\"\n\n\"My own schemes of revenge!\" exclaimed Martin-Roget with a hoarse cry\nthat was like a snarl.... It seemed as if he wanted to say something\nmore, but that the words choked him even before they reached his lips.\nThe hot flush died down from his forehead and his face was once more the\ncolour of lead. He took up a log from the corner of the hearth and threw\nit with a savage, defiant gesture into the fire.\n\nSomewhere in the house a clock struck nine.\n\n\nV\n\nMartin-Roget waited until the last echo of the gong had died away, then\nhe said very slowly and very quietly:\n\n\"Forgo my own schemes of revenge? Can you even remotely guess, citizen\nChauvelin, what it would mean to a man of my temperament and of my\ncalibre to give up that for which I have toiled and striven for the past\nfour years? Think of what I was on that day when a conglomeration of\nadverse circumstances turned our proposed expedition against the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau\nde Kernogan into a disaster for our village lads, and a triumph for the\nduc. I was knocked down and crushed all but to death by the wheels of\nMlle. de Kernogan's coach. I managed to crawl in the mud and the cold\nand the rain, on my hands and knees, hurt, bleeding, half dead, as far\nas the presbytery of Vertou where the _cur\u00c3\u00a9_ kept me hidden at risk of\nhis own life for two days until I was able to crawl farther away out of\nsight. The _cur\u00c3\u00a9_ did not know, I did not know then of the devilish\nrevenge which the duc de Kernogan meant to wreak against my father. The\nnews reached me when it was all over and I had worked my way to Paris\nwith the few sous in my pocket which that good _cur\u00c3\u00a9_ had given me,\nearning bed and bread as I went along. I was an ignorant lout when I\narrived in Paris. I had been one of the ci-devant Kernogan's\nlabourers--his chattel, what?--little better or somewhat worse off than\na slave. There I heard that my father had been foully murdered--hung for\na crime which I was supposed to have committed, for which I had not even\nbeen tried. Then the change in me began. For four years I starved in a\ngarret, toiling like a galley-slave with my hands and muscles by day and\nat my books by night. And what am I now? I have worked at books, at\nphilosophy, at science: I am a man of education. I can talk and discuss\nwith the best of those d----d aristos who flaunt their caprices and\ntheir mincing manners in the face of the outraged democracy of two\ncontinents. I speak English--almost like a native--and Danish and German\ntoo. I can quote English poets and criticise M. de Voltaire. I am an\naristo, what? For this I have worked, citizen Chauvelin--day and\nnight--oh! those nights! how I have slaved to make myself what I now am!\nAnd all for the one object--the sole object without which existence\nwould have been absolutely unendurable. That object guided me, helped me\nto bear and to toil, it cheered and comforted me! To be even one day\nwith the duc de Kernogan and with his daughter! to be their master! to\nhold them at my mercy!... to destroy or pardon as I choose!... to be the\narbiter of their fate!... I have worked for four years: now my goal is\nin sight, and you talk glibly of forgoing my own schemes of revenge!\nBelieve me, citizen Chauvelin,\" he concluded, \"it would be easier for me\nto hold my right hand into those flames until it hath burned to a cinder\nthan to forgo the hope of that vengeance which has eaten into my soul.\nIt would hurt much less.\"\n\nHe had spoken thus at great length, but with extraordinary restraint.\nNever once did he raise his voice or indulge in gesture. He spoke in\neven, monotonous tones, like one who is reciting a lesson; and he sat\nstraight in front of the fire, his elbow on his knee, his chin resting\nin his hand and his eyes fixed upon the flames.\n\nChauvelin had listened in perfect silence. The scorn, the resentful\nanger, the ill-concealed envy of the fallen man for the successful\nupstart had died out of his glance. Martin-Roget's story, the intensity\nof feeling betrayed in that absolute, outward calm had caused a chord of\nsympathy to vibrate in the other's atrophied heart. How well he\nunderstood that vibrant passion of hate, that longing to exact an eye\nfor an eye, an outrage for an outrage! Was not his own life given over\nnow to just such a longing?--a mad aching desire to be even once with\nthat hated enemy, that maddening, mocking, elusive Scarlet Pimpernel who\nhad fooled and baffled him so often?\n\n\nVI\n\nSome few moments had gone by since Martin-Roget's harsh, monotonous\nvoice had ceased to echo through the low raftered room: silence had\nfallen between the two men--there was indeed nothing more to say; the\none had unburthened his over-full heart and the other had understood.\nThey were of a truth made to understand one another, and the silence\nbetween them betokened sympathy.\n\nAround them all was still, the stillness of a mist-laden night; in the\nhouse no one stirred: the shutter even had ceased to creak; only the\ncrackling of the wood fire broke that silence which soon became\noppressive.\n\nMartin-Roget was the first to rouse himself from this trance-like state\nwherein memory was holding such ruthless sway: he brought his hands\nsharply down on his knees, turned to look for a moment on his companion,\ngave a short laugh and finally rose, saying briskly the while:\n\n\"And now, citizen, I shall have to bid you adieu and make my way back to\nBath. The nags have had the rest they needed and I cannot spend the\nnight here.\"\n\nHe went to the door and opening it called a loud \"Hallo, there!\"\n\nThe same woman who had waited on him on his arrival came slowly down the\nstairs in response.\n\n\"The man with the horses,\" commanded Martin-Roget peremptorily. \"Tell\nhim I'll be ready in two minutes.\"\n\nHe returned to the room and proceeded to struggle into his heavy coat,\nChauvelin as before making no attempt to help him. He sat once more\nhuddled up in the ingle-nook hugging his elbows with his thin white\nhands. There was a smile half scornful, but not wholly dissatisfied\naround his bloodless lips. When Martin-Roget was ready to go he called\nout quietly after him:\n\n\"The _Hollandia_ remember! At Portishead on the last day of the month.\nCaptain  K\u00c2\u00a0U\u00c2\u00a0Y\u00c2\u00a0P\u00c2\u00a0E\u00c2\u00a0R.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" replied Martin-Roget laconically. \"I'm not like to\nforget.\"\n\nHe then picked up his hat and riding whip and went out.\n\n\nVII\n\nOutside in the porch he found the woman bending over the recumbent\nfigure of his guide.\n\n\"He be azleep, Mounzeer,\" she said placidly, \"fast azleep, I do\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Asleep?\" cried Martin-Roget roughly, \"we'll soon see about waking him\nup.\"\n\nHe gave the man a violent kick with the toe of his boot. The man\ngroaned, stretched himself, turned over and rubbed his eyes. The light\nof the swinging lanthorn showed him the wrathful face of his employer.\nHe struggled to his feet very quickly after that.\n\n\"Stir yourself, man,\" cried Martin-Roget savagely, as he gripped the\nfellow by the shoulder and gave him a vigorous shaking. \"Bring the\nhorses along now, and don't keep me waiting, or there'll be trouble.\"\n\n\"All right, Mounzeer, all right,\" muttered the man placidly, as he shook\nhimself free from the uncomfortable clutch on his shoulder and leisurely\nmade his way out of the porch.\n\n\"Haven't you got a boy or a man who can give that lout a hand with those\n_sacr\u00c3\u00a9_ horses?\" queried Martin-Roget impatiently. \"He hardly knows a\nhorse's head from its tail.\"\n\n\"No, zir, I've no one to-night,\" replied the woman gently. \"My man and\nmy son they be gone down to Watchet to 'elp with the cargo and the\npack-'orzes. They won't be 'ere neither till after midnight. But,\" she\nadded more cheerfully, \"I can straighten a saddle if you want it.\"\n\n\"That's all right then--but....\"\n\nHe paused suddenly, for a loud cry of \"Hallo! Well! I'm ...\" rang\nthrough the night from the direction of the rear of the house. The cry\nexpressed both surprise and dismay.\n\n\"What the ---- is it?\" called Martin-Roget loudly in response.\n\n\"The 'orzes!\"\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\nTo this there was no reply, and with a savage oath and calling to the\nwoman to show him the way Martin-Roget ran out in the direction whence\nhad come the cry of dismay. He fell straight into the arms of his guide,\nwho promptly set up another cry, more dismal, more expressive of\nbewilderment than the first.\n\n\"They be gone,\" he shouted excitedly.\n\n\"Who have gone?\" queried the Frenchman.\n\n\"The 'orzes!\"\n\n\"The horses? What in ---- do you mean?\"\n\n\"The 'orzes have gone, Mounzeer. There was no door to the ztables and\nthey be gone.\"\n\n\"You're a fool,\" growled Martin-Roget, who of a truth had not taken in\nas yet the full significance of the man's jerky sentences. \"Horses don't\nwalk out of the stables like that. They can't have done if you tied them\nup properly.\"\n\n\"I didn't tie them up,\" protested the man. \"I didn't know 'ow to tie the\nbeastly nags up, and there was no one to 'elp me. I didn't think they'd\nwalk out like that.\"\n\n\"Well! if they're gone you'll have to go and get them back somehow,\nthat's all,\" said Martin-Roget, whose temper by now was beyond his\ncontrol, and who was quite ready to give the lout a furious thrashing.\n\n\"Get them back, Mounzeer,\" wailed the man, \"'ow can I? In the dark, too.\nBesides, if I did come nose to nose wi' 'em I shouldn't know 'ow to get\n'em. Would you, Mounzeer?\" he added with bland impertinence.\n\n\"I shall know how to lay you out, you _satan\u00c3\u00a9_ idiot,\" growled\nMartin-Roget, \"if I have to spend the night in this hole.\"\n\nHe strode on in the darkness in the direction where a little glimmer of\nlight showed the entrance to a wide barn which obviously was used as a\nrough stabling. He stumbled through a yard and over a miscellaneous lot\nof rubbish. It was hardly possible to see one's hands before one's eyes\nin the darkness and the fog. The woman followed him, offering\nconsolation in the shape of a seat in the coffee-room whereon to pass\nthe night, for indeed she had no bed to spare, and the man from Chelwood\nbrought up the rear--still ejaculating cries of astonishment rather than\ndistress.\n\n\"You are that careless, man!\" the woman admonished him placidly, \"and I\ngive you a lanthorn and all for to look after your 'orzes properly.\"\n\n\"But you didn't give me a 'and for to tie 'em up in their stalls, and\ngive 'em their feed. Drat 'em! I 'ate 'orzes and all to do with 'em.\"\n\n\"Didn't you give 'em the feed I give you for 'em then?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. Think you I'd go into one o' them narrow stalls and get\nkicked for my pains.\"\n\n\"Then they was 'ungry, pore things,\" she concluded, \"and went out after\nthe 'ay what's just outside. I don't know 'ow you'll ever get 'em back\nin this fog.\"\n\nThere was indeed no doubt that the nags had made their way out of the\nstables, in that irresponsible fashion peculiar to animals, and that\nthey had gone astray in the dark. There certainly was no sound in the\nnight to denote their presence anywhere near.\n\n\"We'll get 'em all right in the morning,\" remarked the woman with her\nexasperating placidity.\n\n\"To-morrow morning!\" exclaimed Martin-Roget in a passion of fury. \"And\nwhat the d----l am I going to do in the meanwhile?\"\n\nThe woman reiterated her offers of a seat by the fire in the\ncoffee-room.\n\n\"The men won't mind ye, zir,\" she said, \"heaps of 'em are Frenchies like\nyourself, and I'll tell 'em you ain't a spying on 'em.\"\n\n\"It's no more than five mile to Chelwood,\" said the man blandly, \"and\nmaybe you get a better shakedown there.\"\n\n\"A five-mile tramp,\" growled Martin-Roget, whose wrath seemed to have\nspent itself before the hopelessness of his situation, \"in this fog and\ngloom, and knee-deep in mud.... There'll be a sovereign for you, woman,\"\nhe added curtly, \"if you can give me a clean bed for the night.\"\n\nThe woman hesitated for a second or two.\n\n\"Well! a zovereign is tempting, zir,\" she said at last. \"You shall 'ave\nmy son's bed. I know 'e'd rather 'ave the zovereign if 'e was ever zo\ntired. This way, zir,\" she added, as she once more turned toward the\nhouse, \"mind them 'urdles there.\"\n\n\"And where am I goin' to zleep?\" called the man from Chelwood after the\ntwo retreating figures.\n\n\"I'll look after the man for you, zir,\" said the woman; \"for a matter of\na shillin' 'e can sleep in the coffee-room, and I'll give 'im 'is\nbreakfast too.\"\n\n\"Not one farthing will I pay for the idiot,\" retorted Martin-Roget\nsavagely. \"Let him look after himself.\"\n\nHe had once more reached the porch. Without another word, and not\nheeding the protests and curses of the unfortunate man whom he had left\nstanding shelterless in the middle of the yard, he pushed open the front\ndoor of the house and once more found himself in the passage outside the\ncoffee-room.\n\nBut the woman had turned back a little before she followed her guest\ninto the house, and she called out to the man in the darkness:\n\n\"You may zleep in any of them outhouses and welcome, and zure there'll\nbe a bit o' porridge for ye in the mornin'!\"\n\n\"Think ye I'll stop,\" came in a furious growl out of the gloom, \"and\nconduct that d----d frogeater back to Chelwood? No fear. Five miles\nain't nothin' to me, and 'e can keep the miserable shillin' 'e'd 'ave\ngive me for my pains. Let 'im get 'is 'orzes back 'izelf and get to\nChelwood as best 'e can. I'm off, and you can tell 'im zo from me. It'll\nmake 'im sleep all the better, I reckon.\"\n\nThe woman was obviously not of a disposition that would ever argue a\nmatter of this sort out. She had done her best, she reckoned, both for\nmaster and man, and if they chose to quarrel between themselves that was\ntheir business and not hers.\n\nSo she quietly went into the house again; barred and bolted the door,\nand finding the stranger still waiting for her in the passage she\nconducted him to a tiny room on the floor above.\n\n\"My son's room, Mounzeer,\" she said; \"I 'ope as 'ow ye'll be\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"It will do all right,\" assented Martin-Roget. \"Is 'the Captain'\nsleeping in the house to-night?\" he added as with an afterthought.\n\n\"Only in the coffee-room, Mounzeer. I couldn't give 'im a bed. 'The\nCaptain' will be leaving with the pack 'orzes a couple of hours before\ndawn. Shall I tell 'im you be 'ere.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he replied promptly. \"Don't tell him anything. I don't want to\nsee him again: and he'll be gone before I'm awake, I reckon.\"\n\n\"That 'e will, zir, most like. Good-night, zir.\"\n\n\"Good-night. And--mind--that lout gets the two horses back again for my\nuse in the morning. I shall have to make my way to Chelwood as early as\nmay be.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, zir,\" assented the woman placidly. It were no use, she\nthought, to upset the Mounzeer's temper once more by telling him that\nhis guide had decamped. Time enough in the morning, when she would be\nless busy.\n\n\"And my John can see 'im as far as Chelwood,\" she thought to herself as\nshe finally closed the door on the stranger and made her way slowly down\nthe creaking stairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE ASSEMBLY ROOMS\n\n\nI\n\nThe sigh of satisfaction was quite unmistakable.\n\nIt could be heard from end to end, from corner to corner of the\nbuilding. It sounded above the din of the orchestra who had just\nattacked with vigour the opening bars of a schottische, above the\nbrouhaha of moving dancers and the frou-frou of skirts: it travelled\nfrom the small octagon hall, through the central salon to the tea-room,\nthe ball-room and the card-room: it reverberated from the gallery in the\nball-room to the maids' gallery: it distracted the ladies from their\ngossip and the gentlemen from their cards.\n\nIt was a universal, heartfelt \"Ah!\" of intense and pleasurable\nsatisfaction.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney and his lady had just arrived. It was close on\nmidnight, and the ball had positively languished. What was a ball\nwithout the presence of Sir Percy? His Royal Highness too had been\nexpected earlier than this. But it was not thought that he would come at\nall, despite his promise, if the spoilt pet of Bath society remained\nunaccountably absent; and the Assembly Rooms had worn an air of woe even\nin the face of the gaily dressed throng which filled every vast room in\nits remotest angle.\n\nBut now Sir Percy Blakeney had arrived, just before the clocks had\nstruck midnight, and exactly one minute before His Royal Highness drove\nup himself from the Royal Apartments. Lady Blakeney was looking more\nradiant and beautiful than ever before, so everyone remarked, when a few\nmoments later she appeared in the crowded ball-room on the arm of His\nRoyal Highness and closely followed by my lord Anthony Dewhurst and by\nSir Percy himself, who had the young Duchess of Flintshire on his arm.\n\n\"What do you mean, you incorrigible rogue,\" her Grace was saying with\nplayful severity to her cavalier, \"by coming so late to the ball?\nAnother two minutes and you would have arrived after His Royal Highness\nhimself: and how would you have justified such solecism, I would like to\nknow.\"\n\n\"By swearing that thoughts of your Grace had completely addled my poor\nbrain,\" he retorted gaily, \"and that in the mental contemplation of such\ncharms I forgot time, place, social duties, everything.\"\n\n\"Even the homage due to truth,\" she laughed. \"Cannot you for once in\nyour life be serious, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"Impossible, dear lady, whilst your dainty hand rests upon mine arm.\"\n\n\nII\n\nIt was not often that His Royal Highness graced Bath with his presence,\nand the occasion was made the excuse for quite exceptional gaiety and\nbrilliancy. The new fashions of this memorable year of 1793 had defied\nthe declaration of war and filtrated through from Paris: London\nmilliners had not been backward in taking the hint, and though most of\nthe more starchy dowagers obstinately adhered to the pre-war\nfashions--the huge hooped skirts, stiff stomachers, pointed waists,\nvoluminous panniers and monumental head erections--the young and smart\nmatrons were everywhere to be seen in the new gracefully flowing skirts\ninnocent of steel constructions, the high waist line, the pouter\npigeon-like draperies over their pretty bosoms.\n\nHer Grace of Flintshire looked ravishing with her curly fair hair\nentirely free from powder, and Lady Betty Draitune's waist seemed to be\nnestling under her arm-pits. Of course Lady Blakeney wore the very\nlatest thing in striped silks and gossamer-like muslin and lace, and it\nwas hard to enumerate all the pretty d\u00c3\u00a9butantes and young brides who\nfluttered about the Assembly Rooms this night.\n\nAnd gliding through that motley throng, bright-plumaged like a swarm of\nbutterflies, there were a few figures dressed in sober blacks and\ngreys--the _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ over from France--men, women, young girls and\ngilded youth from out that seething cauldron of revolutionary\nFrance--who had shaken the dust of that rampant demagogism from off\ntheir buckled shoes, taking away with them little else but their lives.\nMostly chary of speech, grave in their demeanour, bearing upon their wan\nfaces traces of that horror which had seized them when they saw all the\ntraditions of their past tottering around them, the proletariat whom\nthey had despised turning against them with all the fury of caged beasts\nlet loose, their kindred and friends massacred, their King and Queen\nmurdered. The shelter and security which hospitable England had extended\nto them, had not altogether removed from their hearts the awful sense of\nterror and of gloom.\n\nMany of them had come to Bath because the more genial climate of the\nWest of England consoled them for the inclemencies of London's fogs.\nReceived with open arms and with that lavish hospitality which the\nrefugees and the oppressed had already learned to look for in England,\nthey had gradually allowed themselves to be drawn into the fashionable\nlife of the gay little city. The Comtesse de Tournai was here and her\ndaughter, Lady Ffoulkes, Sir Andrew's charming and happy bride, and M.\nPaul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and his wife--beautiful Juliette D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de with the\nstrange, haunted look in her large eyes, as of one who has looked\nclosely on death; and M. le duc de Kernogan with his exquisite daughter,\nwhose pretty air of seriousness and of repose sat so quaintly upon her\nyoung face. But every one remarked as soon as M. le duc entered the\nrooms that M. Martin-Roget was not in attendance upon Mademoiselle,\nwhich was quite against the order of things; also that M. le duc\nappeared to keep a more sharp eye than usual upon his daughter in\nconsequence, and that he asked somewhat anxiously if milor Anthony\nDewhurst was in the room, and looked obviously relieved when the reply\nwas in the negative.\n\nAt which trifling incident every one who was in the know smiled and\nwhispered, for M. le duc made it no secret that he favoured his own\ncompatriot's suit for Mademoiselle Yvonne's hand rather than that of my\nlord Tony--which--as old Euclid has it--is absurd.\n\n\nIII\n\nBut with the arrival of the royal party M. de Kernogan's troubles began.\nTo begin with, though M. Martin-Roget had not arrived, my lord Tony\nundoubtedly had. He had come in, in the wake of Lady Blakeney, but very\nsoon he began wandering round the room obviously in search of some one.\nImmediately there appeared to be quite a conspiracy among the young folk\nin the ball-room to keep both Lord Tony's and Mlle. Yvonne's movements\nhidden from the prying eyes of M. le duc: and anon His Royal Highness,\nafter a comprehensive survey of the ball-room and a few gracious words\nto his more intimate circle, wandered away to the card-room, and as luck\nwould have it he claimed M. le duc de Kernogan for a partner at faro.\n\nNow M. le duc was a courtier of the old r\u00c3\u00a9gime: to have disobeyed the\nroyal summons would in his eyes have been nothing short of a crime. He\nfollowed the royal party to the card-room, and on his way thither had\none gleam of comfort in that he saw Lady Blakeney sitting on a sofa in\nthe octagon hall engaged in conversation with his daughter, whilst Lord\nAnthony Dewhurst was nowhere in sight.\n\nHowever, the gleam of comfort was very brief, for less than a quarter of\nan hour after he had sat down at His Highness' table, Lady Blakeney came\ninto the card-room and stood thereafter for some little while close\nbeside the Prince's chair. The next hour after that was one of special\nmartyrdom for the anxious father, for he knew that his daughter was in\nall probability sitting out in a specially secluded corner in the\ncompany of my lord Tony.\n\nIf only Martin-Roget were here!\n\n\nIV\n\nMartin-Roget with the eagle eyes and the airs of an accredited suitor\nwould surely have intervened when my lord Tony in the face of the whole\nbrilliant assembly in the ball-room, drew Mlle. de Kernogan into the\nseclusion of the recess underneath the gallery.\n\nMy lord Tony was never very glib of tongue. That peculiar dignified\nshyness which is one of the chief characteristics of well-bred\nEnglishmen caused him to be tongue-tied when he had most to say. It was\njust with gesture and an appealing pressure of his hand upon her arm\nthat he persuaded Yvonne de Kernogan to sit down beside him on the sofa\nin the remotest and darkest corner of the recess, and there she remained\nbeside him silent and grave for a moment or two, and stole timid glances\nfrom time to time through the veil of her lashes at the\nfinely-chiselled, expressive face of her young English lover.\n\nHe was pining to put a question to her, and so great was his excitement\nthat his tongue refused him service, and she, knowing what was hovering\non his lips, would not help him out, but a humorous twinkle in her dark\neyes, and a faint smile round her lips lit up the habitual seriousness\nof her young face.\n\n\"Mademoiselle ...\" he managed to stammer at last. \"Mademoiselle Yvonne\n... you have seen Lady Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied demurely, \"I have seen Lady Blakeney.\"\n\n\"And ... and ... she told you?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lady Blakeney told me many things.\"\n\n\"She told you that ... that.... In God's name, Mademoiselle Yvonne,\" he\nadded desperately, \"do help me out--it is cruel to tease me! Can't you\nsee that I'm nearly crazy with anxiety?\"\n\nThen she looked up at him, her dark eyes glowing and brilliant, her face\nshining with the light of a great tenderness.\n\n\"Nay, milor,\" she said earnestly, \"I had no wish to tease you. But you\nwill own 'tis a grave and serious step which Lady Blakeney suggested\nthat I should take. I have had no time to think ... as yet.\"\n\n\"But there is no time for thinking, Mademoiselle Yvonne,\" he said\nna\u00c3\u00afvely. \"If you will consent.... Oh! you will consent, will you not?\"\nhe pleaded.\n\nShe made no immediate reply, but gradually her hand which rested upon\nthe sofa stole nearer and then nearer to his; and with a quiver of\nexquisite happiness his hand closed upon hers. The tips of his fingers\ntouched the smooth warm palm and poor Lord Tony had to close his eyes\nfor a moment as his sense of superlative ecstasy threatened to make him\nfaint. Slowly he lifted that soft white hand to his lips.\n\n\"Upon my word, Yvonne,\" he said with quiet fervour, \"you will never have\ncause to regret that you have trusted me.\"\n\n\"I know that well, milor,\" she replied demurely.\n\nShe settled down a shade or two closer to him still.\n\nThey were now like two birds in a cosy nest--secluded from the rest of\nthe assembly, who appeared to them like dream-figures flitting in some\nother world that had nothing to do with their happiness. The strains of\nthe orchestra who had struck the measure of the first figure of a\ncontredanse sounded like fairy-music, distant, unreal in their ears.\nOnly their love was real, their joy in one another's company, their\nhands clasped closely together!\n\n\"Tell me,\" she said after awhile, \"how it all came about. It is all so\nterribly sudden ... so exquisitely sudden. I was prepared of course ...\nbut not so soon ... and certainly not to-night. Tell me just how it\nhappened.\"\n\nShe spoke English quite fluently, with just a charming slight accent,\nwhich he thought the most adorable thing he had ever heard.\n\n\"You see, dear heart,\" he replied, and there was a quiver of intense\nfeeling in his voice as he spoke, \"there is a man who not only is the\nfriend whom I love best in all the world, but is also the one whom I\ntrust absolutely, more than myself. Two hours ago he sent for me and\ntold me that grave danger threatened you--threatened our love and our\nhappiness, and he begged me to urge you to consent to a secret marriage\n... at once ... to-night.\"\n\n\"And you think this ... this friend knew?\"\n\n\"I know,\" he replied earnestly, \"that he knew, or he would not have\nspoken to me as he did. He knows that my whole life is in your exquisite\nhands--he knows that our happiness is somehow threatened by that man\nMartin-Roget. How he obtained that information I could not guess ... he\nhad not the time or the inclination to tell me. I flew to make all\narrangements for our marriage to-night and prayed to God--as I have\nnever prayed in my life before--that you, dear heart, would deign to\nconsent.\"\n\n\"How could I refuse when Lady Blakeney advised? She is the kindest and\ndearest friend I possess. She and your friend ought to know one another.\nWill you not tell me who he is?\"\n\n\"I will present him to you, dear heart, as soon as we are married,\" he\nreplied with awkward evasiveness. Then suddenly he exclaimed with boyish\nenthusiasm: \"I can't believe it! I can't believe it! It is the most\nextraordinary thing in the world....\"\n\n\"What is that, milor?\" she asked.\n\n\"That you should have cared for me at all. For of course you must care,\nor you wouldn't be sitting here with me now ... you would not have\nconsented ... would you?\"\n\n\"You know that I do care, milor,\" she said in her grave quiet way. \"How\ncould it be otherwise?\"\n\n\"But I am so stupid and so slow,\" he said na\u00c3\u00afvely. \"Why! look at me now.\nMy heart is simply bursting with all that I want to say to you, but I\njust can't find the words, and I do nothing but talk rubbish and feel\nhow you must despise me.\"\n\nOnce more that humorous little smile played for a moment round Yvonne de\nKernogan's serious mouth. She didn't say anything just then, but her\ndelicate fingers gave his hand an expressive squeeze.\n\n\"You are not frightened?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Frightened? Of what?\" she rejoined.\n\n\"At the step you are going to take?\"\n\n\"Would I take it,\" she retorted gently, \"if I had any misgivings?\"\n\n\"Oh! if you had.... Do you know that even now ...\" he continued clumsily\nand haltingly, \"now that I have realised just what it will mean to have\nyou ... and just what it would mean to me, God help me--if I were to\nlose you ... well!... that even now I would rather go through that hell\nthan that you should feel the least bit doubtful or unhappy about it\nall.\"\n\nAgain she smiled, gently, tenderly up into his eager, boyish face.\n\n\"The only unhappiness,\" she said gravely, \"that could ever overtake me\nin the future would be parting from you, milor.\"\n\n\"Oh! God bless you for that, my dear! God bless you for that! But for\npity's sake turn your dear eyes away from me or I vow I shall go crazy\nwith joy. Men do go crazy with joy sometimes, you know, and I feel that\nin another moment I shall stand up and shout at the top of my voice to\nall the people in the room that within the next few hours the loveliest\ngirl in all the world is going to be my wife.\"\n\n\"She certainly won't be that, if you do shout it at the top of your\nvoice, milor, for father would hear you and there would be an end to our\nbeautiful adventure.\"\n\n\"It will be a beautiful adventure, won't it?\" he sighed with unconcealed\necstasy.\n\n\"So beautiful, my dear lord,\" she replied with gentle earnestness, \"so\nperfect, in fact, that I am almost afraid something must happen\npresently to upset it all.\"\n\n\"Nothing can happen,\" he assured her. \"M. Martin-Roget is not here, and\nHis Royal Highness is even now monopolising M. le duc de Kernogan so\nthat he cannot get away.\"\n\n\"Your friend must be very clever to manipulate so many strings on our\nbehalf!\"\n\n\"It is long past midnight now, sweetheart,\" he said with sudden\nirrelevance.\n\n\"Yes, I know. I have been watching the time: and I have already thought\neverything out for the best. I very often go home from balls and routs\nin the company of Lady Ffoulkes and sleep in her house those nights.\nFather is always quite satisfied, when I do that, and to-night he will\nbe doubly satisfied feeling that I shall be taken away from your\nsociety. Lady Ffoulkes is in the secret, of course, so Lady Blakeney\ntold me, and she will be ready for me in a few minutes now: she'll take\nme home with her and there I will change my dress and rest for awhile,\nwaiting for the happy hour. She will come to the church with me and then\n... oh then! Oh! my dear milor!\" she added suddenly with a deep sigh\nwhilst her whole face became irradiated with a light of intense\nhappiness, \"as you say it is the most wonderful thing in all the\nworld--this--our beautiful adventure together.\"\n\n\"The parson will be ready at half-past six, dear heart, it was the\nearliest hour that I could secure ... after that we go at once to your\nchurch and the priest will tie up any loose threads which our English\nparson failed to make tight. After those two ceremonies we shall be very\nmuch married, shan't we?... and nothing can come between us, dear heart,\ncan it?\" he queried with a look of intense anxiety on his young face.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she replied. Then she added with a short sigh: \"Poor father!\"\n\n\"Dear heart, he will only fret for a little while. I don't believe he\ncan really want you to marry that man Martin-Roget. It is just obstinacy\non his part. He can't have anything against me really ... save of course\nthat I am not clever and that I shall never do anything very big in the\nworld ... except to love you, Yvonne, with my whole heart and soul and\nwith every fibre and muscle in me.... Oh! I'll do that,\" he added with\nboyish enthusiasm, \"better than anyone else in all the world could do!\nAnd your father will, I'll be bound, forgive me for stealing you, when\nhe sees that you are happy, and contented, and have everything you want\nand ... and....\"\n\nAs usual Lord Tony's eloquence was not equal to all that it should have\nexpressed. He blushed furiously and with a quaint, shy gesture, passed\nhis large, well-shaped hand over his smooth, brown hair. \"I am not much,\nI know,\" he continued with a winning air of self-deprecation, \"and you\nare far above me as the stars--you are so wonderful, so clever, so\naccomplished and I am nothing at all ... but ... but I have plenty of\nhigh-born connexions, and I have plenty of money and influential\nfriends ... and ... and Sir Percy Blakeney, who is the most\naccomplished and finest gentleman in England, calls me his friend.\"\n\nShe smiled at his eagerness. She loved him for his clumsy little ways,\nhis halting speech, that big loving heart of his which was too full of\nfine and noble feelings to find vent in mere words.\n\n\"Have you ever met a finer man in all the world?\" he added\nenthusiastically.\n\nYvonne de Kernogan smiled once more. Her recollections of Sir Percy\nBlakeney showed her an elegant man of the world, whose mind seemed\nchiefly occupied on the devising and the wearing of exquisite clothes,\nin the uttering of lively witticisms for the entertainment of his royal\nfriend and the ladies of his entourage: it showed her a man of great\nwealth and vast possessions who seemed willing to spend both in the mere\npursuit of pleasures. She liked Sir Percy Blakeney well enough, but she\ncould not understand clever and charming Marguerite Blakeney's adoration\nfor her inane and foppish husband, nor the whole-hearted admiration\nopenly lavished upon him by men like Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, my lord\nHastings, and others. She would gladly have seen her own dear milor\nchoose a more sober and intellectual friend. But then she loved him for\nhis marvellous power of whole-hearted friendship, for his loyalty to\nthose he cared for, for everything in fact that made up the sum total of\nhis winning personality, and she pinned her faith on that other\nmysterious friend whose individuality vastly intrigued her.\n\n\"I am more interested in your anonymous friend,\" she said quaintly,\n\"than in Sir Percy Blakeney. But he too is kindness itself and Lady\nBlakeney is an angel. I like to think that the happiest days of my\nlife--our honeymoon, my dear lord--will be spent in their house.\"\n\n\"Blakeney has lent me Combwich Hall for as long as we like to stay\nthere. We'll drive thither directly after the service, dear heart, and\nthen we'll send a courier to your father and ask for his blessing and\nhis forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" sighed Yvonne again. But evidently compassion for the\nfather whom she had elected to deceive did not weigh over heavily in the\nbalance of her happiness. Her little hand once more stole like a timid\nand confiding bird into the shelter of his firm grasp.\n\n\nV\n\nIn the card-room at His Highness' table Sir Percy Blakeney was holding\nthe bank and seemingly luck was dead against him. Around the various\ntables the ladies stood about, chattering and hindering the players.\nNothing appeared serious to-night, not even the capricious chances of\nhazard.\n\nHis Royal Highness was in rare good humour, for he was winning\nprodigiously.\n\nHer Grace of Flintshire placed her perfumed and beringed hand upon Sir\nPercy Blakeney's shoulder; she stood behind his chair, chattering\nincessantly in a high flutey treble just like a canary. Blakeney vowed\nthat she was so ravishing that she had put Dame Fortune to flight.\n\n\"You have not yet told us, Sir Percy,\" she said roguishly, \"how you came\nto arrive so late at the ball.\"\n\n\"Alas, madam,\" he sighed dolefully, \"'twas the fault of my cravat.\"\n\n\"Your cravat?\"\n\n\"Aye indeed! You see I spent the whole of to-day in perfecting my new\nmethod for tying a butterfly bow, so as to give the neck an appearance\nof utmost elegance with a minimum of discomfort. Lady Blakeney will bear\nme out when I say that I set my whole mind to my task. Was I not busy\nall day m'dear?\" he added, making a formal appeal to Marguerite, who\nstood immediately behind His Highness' chair, and with her luminous\neyes, full of merriment and shining with happiness, fixed upon her\nhusband.\n\n\"You certainly spent a considerable time in front of the looking-glass,\"\nshe said gaily, \"with two valets in attendance and my lord Tony an\ninterested spectator in the proceedings.\"\n\n\"There now!\" rejoined Sir Percy triumphantly, \"her ladyship's testimony\nthoroughly bears me out. And now you shall see what Tony says on the\nmatter. Tony! Where's Tony!\" he added as his lazy grey eyes sought the\nbrilliant crowd in the card-room. \"Tony, where the devil are you?\"\n\nThere was no reply, and anon Sir Percy's merry gaze encountered that of\nM. le duc de Kernogan who, dressed in sober black, looked strangely\nconspicuous in the midst of this throng of bright-coloured butterflies,\nand whose grave eyes, as they rested on the gorgeous figure of the\nEnglish exquisite, held a world of contempt in their glance.\n\n\"Ah! M. le duc,\" continued Blakeney, returning that scornful look with\nhis habitual good-humoured one, \"I had not noticed that mademoiselle\nYvonne was not with you, else I had not thought of inquiring so loudly\nfor my friend Tony.\"\n\n\"My lord Antoine is dancing with my daughter, Sir Percy,\" said the other\nman gravely, in excellent if somewhat laboured English, \"he had my\npermission to ask her.\"\n\n\"And is a thrice happy man in consequence,\" retorted Blakeney lightly,\n\"though I fear me M. Martin-Roget's wrath will descend upon my poor\nTony's head with unexampled vigour in consequence.\"\n\n\"M. Martin-Roget is not here this evening,\" broke in the Duchess, \"and\nmethought,\" she added in a discreet whisper, \"that my lord Tony was all\nthe happier for his absence. The two young people have spent a\nconsiderable time together under the shadow of the gallery in the\nball-room, and, if I mistake not, Lord Tony is making the most of his\ntime.\"\n\nShe talked very volubly and with a slight North-country brogue which no\ndoubt made it a little difficult for the stranger to catch her every\nword. But evidently M. le duc had understood the drift of what she said,\nfor now he rejoined with some acerbity:\n\n\"Mlle. de Kernogan is too well educated, I hope, to allow the attentions\nof any gentleman, against her father's will.\"\n\n\"Come, come, M. de Kernogan,\" here interposed His Royal Highness with\neasy familiarity, \"Lord Anthony Dewhurst is the son of my old friend the\nMarquis of Atiltone: one of our most distinguished families in this\ncountry, who have helped to make English history. He has moreover\ninherited a large fortune from his mother, who was a Cruche of Crewkerne\nand one of the richest heiresses in the land. He is a splendid fellow--a\nfine sportsman, a loyal gentleman. His attentions to any young lady,\nhowever high-born, can be but flattering--and I should say welcome to\nthose who have her future welfare at heart.\"\n\nBut in response to this gracious tirade, M. le duc de Kernogan bowed\ngravely, and his stern features did not relax as he said coldly:\n\n\"Your Royal Highness is pleased to take an interest in the affairs of my\ndaughter. I am deeply grateful.\"\n\nThere was a second's awkward pause, for every one felt that despite his\nobvious respect and deference M. le duc de Kernogan had endeavoured to\ninflict a snub upon the royal personage, and one or two hot-headed young\nfops in the immediate entourage even muttered the word: \"Impertinence!\"\ninaudibly through their teeth. Only His Royal Highness appeared not to\nnotice anything unusual or disrespectful in M. le duc's attitude. It\nseemed as if he was determined to remain good-humoured and pleasant. At\nany rate he chose to ignore the remark which had offended the ears of\nhis entourage. Only those who stood opposite to His Highness, on the\nother side of the card table, declared afterwards that the Prince had\nfrowned and that a haughty rejoinder undoubtedly hovered on his lips.\n\nBe that as it may, he certainly did not show the slightest sign of\nill-humour: quite gaily and unconcernedly he scooped up his winnings\nwhich Sir Percy Blakeney, who held the Bank, was at this moment pushing\ntowards him.\n\n\"Don't go yet, M. de Kernogan,\" he said as the Frenchman made a movement\nto work his way out of the crowd, feeling no doubt that the atmosphere\nround him had become somewhat frigid if not exactly inimical, \"don't go\nyet, I beg of you. _Pardi!_ Can't you see that you have been bringing me\nluck? As a rule Blakeney, who can so well afford to lose, has the\ndevil's own good fortune, but to-night I have succeeded in getting some\nof my own back from him. Do not, I entreat you, break the run of my luck\nby going.\"\n\n\"Oh, Monseigneur,\" rejoined the old courtier suavely, \"how can my poor\npresence influence the gods, who of a surety always preside over your\nHighness' fortunes?\"\n\n\"Don't attempt to explain it, my dear sir,\" quoth the Prince gaily. \"I\nonly know that if you go now, my luck may go with you and I shall blame\nyou for my losses.\"\n\n\"Oh! in that case, Monseigneur....\"\n\n\"And with all that, Blakeney,\" continued His Highness, once more taking\nup the cards and turning to his friend, \"remember that we still await\nyour explanation as to your coming so late to the ball.\"\n\n\"An omission, your Royal Highness,\" rejoined Blakeney, \"an absence of\nmind brought about by your severity, and that of Her Grace. The trouble\nwas that all my calculations with regard to the exact adjustment of the\nbutterfly bow were upset when I realised that the set of the present day\nwaistcoat would not harmonise with it. Less than two hours before I was\ndue to appear at this ball my mind had to make a complete _volte-face_\nin the matter of cravats. I became bewildered, lost, utterly confused. I\nhave only just recovered, and one word of criticism on my final efforts\nwould plunge me now into the depths of despair.\"\n\n\"Blakeney, you are absolutely incorrigible,\" retorted His Highness with\na laugh. \"M. le duc,\" he added, once more turning to the grave Frenchman\nwith his wonted graciousness, \"I pray you do not form your judgment on\nthe gilded youth of England by the example of my friend Blakeney. Some\nof us can be serious when occasion demands, you know.\"\n\n\"Your Highness is pleased to jest,\" said M. de Kernogan stiffly. \"What\ngreater occasion for seriousness can there be than the present one.\nTrue, England has never suffered as France is suffering now, but she\nhas engaged in a conflict against the most powerful democracy the world\nhas ever known, she has thrown down the gauntlet to a set of human\nbeasts of prey who are as determined as they are ferocious. England will\nnot emerge victorious from this conflict, Monseigneur, if her sons do\nnot realise that war is not mere sport and that victory can only be\nattained by the sacrifice of levity and of pleasure.\"\n\nHe had dropped into French in response to His Highness' remark, in order\nto express his thoughts more accurately. The Prince--a little bored no\ndoubt--seemed disinclined to pursue the subject. Nevertheless, it seemed\nas if once again he made a decided effort not to show ill-humour. He\neven gave a knowing wink--a wink!--in the direction of his friend\nBlakeney and of Her Grace as if to beg them to set the ball of\nconversation rolling once more along a smoother--a less boring--path. He\nwas obviously quite determined not to release M. de Kernogan from\nattendance near his royal person.\n\n\nVI\n\nAs usual Sir Percy threw himself in the breach, filling the sudden pause\nwith his infectious laugh:\n\n\"La!\" he said gaily, \"how beautifully M. le duc does talk. Ffoulkes,\" he\nadded, addressing Sir Andrew, who was standing close by, \"I'll wager you\nten pounds to a pinch of snuff that you couldn't deliver yourself of\nsuch splendid sentiments, even in your own native lingo.\"\n\n\"I won't take you, Blakeney,\" retorted Sir Andrew with a laugh. \"I'm no\ngood at peroration.\"\n\n\"You should hear our distinguished guest M. Martin-Roget on the same\nsubject,\" continued Sir Percy with mock gravity. \"By Gad! can't he talk?\nI feel a d----d worm when he talks about our national levity, our insane\nworship of sport, our ... our ... M. le duc,\" he added with becoming\nseriousness and in atrocious French, \"I appeal to you. Does not M.\nMartin-Roget talk beautifully?\"\n\n\"M. Martin-Roget,\" replied the duc gravely, \"is a man of marvellous\neloquence, fired by overwhelming patriotism. He is a man who must\ncommand respect wherever he goes.\"\n\n\"You have known him long, M. le duc?\" queried His Royal Highness\ngraciously.\n\n\"Indeed not very long, Monseigneur. He came over as an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_ from\nBrest some three months ago, hidden in a smuggler's ship. He had been\ndenounced as an aristocrat who was furthering the cause of the royalists\nin Brittany by helping them plentifully with money, but he succeeded in\nescaping, not only with his life, but also with the bulk of his\nfortune.\"\n\n\"Ah! M. Martin-Roget is rich?\"\n\n\"He is sole owner of a rich banking business in Brest, Monseigneur,\nwhich has an important branch in America and correspondents all over\nEurope. Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest recommended him specially to my\nnotice in a very warm letter of introduction, wherein he speaks of M.\nMartin-Roget as a gentleman of the highest patriotism and integrity.\nWere I not quite satisfied as to M. Martin-Roget's antecedents and\npresent connexions I would not have ventured to present him to your\nHighness.\"\n\n\"Nor would you have accepted him as a suitor for your daughter, M. le\nduc, _c'est entendu_!\" concluded His Highness urbanely. \"M.\nMartin-Roget's wealth will no doubt cover his lack of birth.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of high-born gentlemen devoted to the royalist cause,\nMonseigneur,\" rejoined the duc in his grave, formal manner. \"But the\nmost just and purest of causes must at times be helped with money. The\nVend\u00c3\u00a9ens in Brittany, the Princes at Coblentz are all sorely in need of\nfunds....\"\n\n\"And M. Martin-Roget son-in-law of M. le duc de Kernogan is more likely\nto feed those funds than M. Martin-Roget the plain business man who has\nno aristocratic connexions,\" concluded His Royal Highness dryly. \"But\neven so, M. le duc,\" he added more gravely, \"surely you cannot be so\nabsolutely certain as you would wish that M. Martin-Roget's antecedents\nare just as he has told you. Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest may have\nacted in perfect good faith....\"\n\n\"Monseigneur the Bishop of Brest, your Highness, is a man who has our\ncause, the cause of our King and of our Faith, as much at heart as I\nhave myself. He would know that on his recommendation I would trust any\nman absolutely. He was not like to make careless use of such knowledge.\"\n\n\"And you are quite satisfied that the worthy Bishop did not act under\nsome dire pressure ...?\"\n\n\"Quite satisfied, Monseigneur,\" replied the duc firmly. \"What pressure\ncould there be that would influence a prelate of such high integrity as\nMonseigneur the Bishop of Brest?\"\n\n\nVII\n\nThere was silence for a moment or two, during which the heavy bracket\nclock over the door struck the first hour after midnight. His Royal\nHighness looked round at Lady Blakeney, and she gave him a smile and an\nalmost imperceptible nod. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had in the meanwhile\nquietly slipped away.\n\n\"I understand,\" said His Royal Highness quite gravely, turning back to\nM. le duc, \"and I must crave your pardon, sir, for what must have seemed\nto you an indiscretion. You have given me a very clear expos\u00c3\u00a9 of the\nsituation. I confess that until to-night it had seemed to me--and to all\nyour friends, Monsieur, a trifle obscure. In fact, it had been my\nintention to intercede with you in favour of my young friend Lord\nAnthony Dewhurst, who of a truth is deeply enamoured of your daughter.\"\n\n\"Though your Highness' wishes are tantamount to a command, yet would I\nhumbly assert that my wishes with regard to my daughter are based upon\nmy loyalty and my duty to my Sovereign King Louis XVII, whom may God\nguard and protect, and that therefore it is beyond my power now to\nmodify them.\"\n\n\"May God trounce you for an obstinate fool,\" murmured His Highness in\nEnglish, and turning his head away so that the other should not hear\nhim. But aloud and with studied graciousness he said:\n\n\"M. le duc, will you not take a hand at hazard? My luck is turning, and\nI have faith in yours. We must fleece Blakeney to-night. He has had\nSatan's own luck these past few weeks. Such good fortune becomes\npositively revolting.\"\n\nThere was no more talk of Mlle. de Kernogan after that. Indeed her\nfather felt that her future had already been discussed far too freely by\nall these well-wishers who of a truth were not a little indiscreet. He\nthought that the manners and customs of good society were very peculiar\nhere in this fog-ridden England. What business was it of all these\nhigh-born ladies and gentlemen--of His Royal Highness himself for that\nmatter--what plans he had made for Yvonne's future? Martin-Roget was\n_bourgeois_ by birth, but he was vastly rich and had promised to pour a\ncouple of millions into the coffers of the royalist army if Mlle. de\nKernogan became his wife. A couple of millions with more to follow, no\ndoubt, and a loyal adherence to the royalist cause was worth these days\nall the blue blood that flowed in my lord Anthony Dewhurst's veins.\n\nSo at any rate thought M. le duc this night, while His Royal Highness\nkept him at cards until the late hours of the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE FATHER\n\n\nI\n\nIt was close on ten o'clock now in the morning on the following day, and\nM. le duc de Kernogan was at breakfast in his lodgings in Laura Place,\nwhen a courier was announced who was the bearer of a letter for M. le\nduc.\n\nHe thought the man must have been sent by Martin-Roget, who mayhap was\nsick, seeing that he had not been present at the Assembly Rooms last\nnight, and the duc took the letter and opened it without misgivings. He\nread the address on the top of the letter: \"Combwich Hall\"--a place\nunknown to him, and the first words of the letter: \"Dear father!\" And\neven then he had no misgivings.\n\nIn fact he had to read the letter through three times before the full\nmeaning of its contents had penetrated into his brain. Whilst he read,\nhe sat quite still, and even the hand which held the paper had not the\nslightest tremor. When he had finished he spoke quite quietly to his\nvalet:\n\n\"Give the courier a glass of ale, Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick,\" he said, \"and tell him he\ncan go; there is no answer. And--stay,\" he added, \"I want you to go\nround at once to M. Martin-Roget's lodgings and ask him to come and\nspeak with me as early as possible.\"\n\nThe valet left the room, and M. le duc deliberately read through the\nletter from end to end for the fourth time. There was no doubt, no\npossible misapprehension. His daughter Yvonne de Kernogan had eloped\nclandestinely with my lord Anthony Dewhurst and had been secretly\nmarried to him in the small hours of the morning in the Protestant\nchurch of St. James, and subsequently before a priest of her own\nreligion in the Priory Church of St. John the Evangelist.\n\nShe apprised her father of this fact in a few sentences which purported\nto be dictated by profound affection and filial respect, but in which M.\nde Kernogan failed to detect the slightest trace of contrition. Yvonne!\nhis Yvonne! the sole representative now of the old race--eloped like a\nkitchen-wench! Yvonne! his daughter! his asset for the future! his\nthing! his fortune! that which he meant with perfect egoism to sacrifice\non the altar of his own beliefs and his own loyalty to the kingship of\nFrance! Yvonne had taken her future in her own hands! She knew that her\nhand, her person, were the purchase price of so many millions to be\npoured into the coffers of the royalist cause, and she had disposed of\nboth, in direct defiance of her father's will and of her duty to her\nKing and to his cause!\n\nYvonne de Kernogan was false to her traditions, false to her father!\nfalse to her King and country! In the years to come when the chroniclers\nof the time came to write the histories of the great families that had\nrallied round their King in the hour of his deadly peril, the name of\nKernogan would be erased from those glorious pages. The Kernogans will\nhave failed in their duty, failed in their loyalty! Oh! the shame of it\nall! The shame!!\n\nThe duc was far too proud a gentleman to allow his valet to see him\nunder the stress of violent emotion, but now that he was alone his thin,\nhard face--with that air of gravity which he had transmitted to his\ndaughter--became distorted with the passion of unbridled fury; he tore\nthe letter up into a thousand little pieces and threw the fragments into\nthe fire. On the bureau beside him there stood a miniature of Yvonne de\nKernogan painted by Hall three years ago, and framed in a circlet of\nbrilliants. M. le duc's eyes casually fell upon it; he picked it up and\nwith a violent gesture of rage threw it on the floor and stamped upon it\nwith his heel, destroying in this paroxysm of silent fury a work of art\nworth many hundred pounds.\n\nHis daughter had deceived him. She had also upset all his plans whereby\nthe army of M. le Prince de Cond\u00c3\u00a9 would have been enriched by a couple\nof million francs. In addition to the shame upon her father, she had\nalso brought disgrace upon herself and her good name, for she was a\nminor and this clandestine marriage, contracted without her father's\nconsent, was illegal in France, illegal everywhere: save perhaps in\nEngland--of this M. de Kernogan was not quite sure, but he certainly\ndidn't care. And in this solemn moment he registered a vow that never as\nlong as he lived would he be reconciled to that English nincompoop who\nhad dared to filch his daughter from him, and never--as long as he\nlived--would he by his consent render the marriage legal, and the\nchildren born of that wedlock legitimate in the eyes of his country's\nlaws.\n\nA calm akin to apathy had followed his first outbreak of fury. He sat\ndown in front of the fire, and buried his chin in his hand. Something of\ncourse must be done to get his daughter back. If only Martin-Roget were\nhere, he would know better how to act. Would Martin-Roget stick to his\nbargain and accept the girl for wife, now that her fame and honour had\nbeen irretrievably tarnished? There was the question which the next\nhalf-hour would decide. M. de Kernogan cast a feverish, anxious look on\nthe clock. Half an hour had gone by since Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick went to seek\nMartin-Roget, and the latter had not yet appeared.\n\nUntil he had seen Martin-Roget and spoken with Martin-Roget M. de\nKernogan could decide nothing. For one brief, mad moment, the project\nhad formed itself in his disordered brain to rush down to Combwich Hall\nand provoke that impudent Englishman who had stolen his daughter: to\nkill him or be killed by him; in either case Yvonne would then be parted\nfrom him for ever. But even then, the thought of Martin-Roget brought\nmore sober reflection. Martin-Roget would see to it. Martin-Roget would\nknow what to do. After all, the outrage had hit the accredited lover\njust as hard as the father.\n\nBut why in the name of ---- did Martin-Roget not come?\n\n\nII\n\nIt was past midday when at last Martin-Roget knocked at the door of M.\nle duc's lodgings in Laura Place. The older man had in the meanwhile\ngone through every phase of overwhelming emotions. The outbreak of\nunreasoning fury--when like a maddened beast that bites and tears he had\nbroken his daughter's miniature and trampled it under foot--had been\nfollowed by a kind of dull apathy, when for close upon an hour he had\nsat staring into the flames, trying to grapple with an awful reality\nwhich seemed to elude him all the time. He could not believe that this\nthing had really happened: that Yvonne, his well-bred dutiful daughter,\nwho had shown such marvellous courage and presence of mind when the\nnecessity of flight and of exile had first presented itself in the wake\nof the awful massacres and wholesale executions of her own friends and\nkindred, that she should have eloped--like some flirtatious wench--and\noutraged her father in this monstrous fashion, by a clandestine marriage\nwith a man of alien race and of a heretical religion! M. de Kernogan\ncould not realise it. It passed the bounds of possibility. The very\nflames in the hearth seemed to dance and to mock the bare suggestion of\nsuch an atrocious transgression.\n\nTo this gloomy numbing of the senses had succeeded the inevitable morbid\nrestlessness: the pacing up and down the narrow room, the furtive\nglances at the clock, the frequent orders to Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick to go out and see\nif M. Martin-Roget was not yet home. For Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick had come back after\nhis first errand with the astounding news that M. Martin-Roget had left\nhis lodgings the previous day at about four o'clock, and had not been\nseen or heard of since. In fact his landlady was very anxious about him\nand was sorely tempted to see the town-crier on the subject.\n\nFour times did Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick have to go from Laura Place to the Bear Inn in\nUnion Street, where M. Martin-Roget lodged, and three times he returned\nwith the news that nothing had been heard of Mounzeer yet. The fourth\ntime--it was then close on midday--he came back running--thankful to\nbring back the good tidings, since he was tired of that walk from Laura\nPlace to the Bear Inn. M. Martin-Roget had come home. He appeared very\ntired and in rare ill-humour: but Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick had delivered the message\nfrom M. le duc, whereupon M. Martin-Roget had become most affable and\npromised that he would come round immediately. In fact he was even then\ntreading hard on Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick's heels.\n\n\nIII\n\n\"My daughter has gone! She left the ball clandestinely last night, and\nwas married to Lord Anthony Dewhurst in the small hours of the morning.\nShe is now at a place called Combwich Hall--with him!\"\n\nM. le duc de Kernogan literally threw these words in Martin-Roget's\nface, the moment the latter had entered the room, and Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick had\ndiscreetly closed the door.\n\n\"What? What?\" stammered the other vaguely. \"I don't understand. What do\nyou mean?\" he added, bewildered at the duc's violence, tired after his\nnight's adventure and the long ride in the early morning, irritable with\nwant of sleep and decent food. He stared, uncomprehending, at the duc,\nwho had once more started pacing up and down the room, like a caged\nbeast, with hands tightly clenched behind his back, his eyes glowering\nboth at the new-comer and at the imaginary presence of his most bitter\nenemy--the man who had dared to come between him and his projects for\nhis daughter.\n\nMartin-Roget passed his hand across his brow like a man who is not yet\nfully awake.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he reiterated hazily.\n\n\"Just what I say,\" retorted the other roughly. \"Yvonne has eloped with\nthat nincompoop Lord Anthony Dewhurst. They have gone through some sort\nof marriage ceremony together. And she writes me a letter this morning\nto tell me that she is quite happy and contented and spending her\nhoneymoon at a place called Combwich Hall. Honeymoon!\" he repeated\nsavagely, as if to lash his fury up anew, \"Tsha!\"\n\nMartin-Roget on the other hand was not the man to allow himself to fall\ninto a state of frenzy, which would necessarily interfere with calm\nconsideration.\n\nHe had taken the fact in now. Yvonne's elopement with his English rival,\nthe clandestine marriage, everything. But he was not going to allow his\ninward rage to obscure his vision of the future. He did not spend the\nnext precious seconds--as men of his race are wont to do--in smashing\nthings around him, in raving and fuming and gesticulating. No. That was\nnot the temper M. Martin-Roget was in at this moment when Fate and a\ngirl's folly were ranging themselves against his plans. His friend,\ncitizen Chauvelin, would have envied him his calm in the face of this\ndisaster.\n\nWhilst M. le duc still stormed and raved, Martin-Roget sat down quietly\nin front of the fire, rested his chin in his hand and waited for a lull\nin the other man's paroxysm ere he spoke.\n\n\"From your attitude, M. le duc,\" he then said quietly, hiding obvious\nsarcasm behind a veil of studied deference, \"from your attitude I gather\nthat your wishes with regard to Mlle. de Kernogan have undergone no\nmodification. You would still honour me by desiring that she should\nbecome my wife?\"\n\n\"I am not in the habit of changing my mind,\" said M. le duc gruffly. He\ndesired the marriage, he coveted Martin-Roget's millions for the\nroyalist cause, but he had no love for the man. All the pride of the\nKernogans, their long line of ancestry, rebelled against the thought of\na fair descendant of this glorious race being allied to a _roturier_--a\n_bourgeois_--a tradesman, what? and the cause of King and country\ncounted few greater martyrdoms than that of the duc de Kernogan whenever\nhe met the banker Martin-Roget on an equal social footing.\n\n\"Then there is not much harm done,\" rejoined the latter coolly; \"the\nmarriage is not a legal one. It need not even be dissolved--Mademoiselle\nde Kernogan is still Mademoiselle de Kernogan and I her humble and\nfaithful adorer.\"\n\nM. le duc paused in his restless walk.\n\n\"You would ...\" he stammered, then checked himself, turning abruptly\naway. He had some difficulty in hiding the scorn wherewith he regarded\nthe other's coolness. Bourgeois blood was not to be gainsaid. The\ntradesman--or banker, whatever he was--who hankered after an alliance\nwith Mademoiselle de Kernogan, and was ready to lay down a couple of\nmillions for the privilege--was not to be deterred from his purpose by\nany considerations of pride or of honour. M. le duc was satisfied and\nre-assured, but he despised the man for his leniency for all that.\n\n\"The marriage is no marriage at all according to the laws of France,\"\nreiterated Martin-Roget calmly.\n\n\"No, it is not,\" assented the Duke roughly.\n\nFor a while there was silence: Martin-Roget seemed immersed in his own\nthoughts and not to notice the febrile comings and goings of the other\nman.\n\n\"What we have to do, M. le duc,\" he said after a while, \"is to induce\nMlle. de Kernogan to return here immediately.\"\n\n\"How are you going to accomplish that?\" sneered the Duke.\n\n\"Oh! I was not suggesting that I should appear in the matter at all,\"\nrejoined Martin-Roget with a shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"Then how can I ...?\"\n\n\"Surely ...\" argued the younger man tentatively.\n\n\"You mean ...?\"\n\nMartin-Roget nodded. Despite these ambiguous half-spoken sentences the\ntwo men had understood one another.\n\n\"We must get her back, of course,\" assented the Duke, who had suddenly\nbecome as calm as the other man.\n\n\"There is no harm done,\" reiterated Martin-Roget with slow and earnest\nemphasis.\n\nWhereupon the Duke, completely pacified, drew a chair close to the\nhearth and sat down, leaning his elbows on his knees and holding his\nfine, aristocratic hands to the blaze.\n\nFr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick came in half an hour later to ask if M. le duc would have his\nluncheon. He found the two gentlemen sitting quite close together over\nthe dying embers of a fire that had not been fed for close upon an hour:\nand that prince of valets was glad to note that M. le duc's temper had\nquite cooled down and that he was talking calmly and very affably to M.\nMartin-Roget.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE NEST\n\n\nI\n\nThere are lovely days in England sometimes in November or December, days\nwhen the departing year strives to make us forget that winter is nigh,\nand autumn smiles, gentle and benignant, caressing with a still tender\nkiss the last leaves of the scarlet oak which linger on the boughs, and\ntouching up with a vivid brush the evergreen verdure of bay trees, of\nilex and of yew. The sky is of that pale, translucent blue which\ndwellers in the South never see, with the soft transparency of an\naquamarine as it fades into the misty horizon at midday. And at dusk the\nthrushes sing: \"Kiss me quick! kiss me quick! kiss me quick\" in the\nnaked branches of old acacias and chestnuts, and the robins don their\ncrimson waistcoats and dart in and out among the coppice and through the\nfeathery arms of larch and pine. And the sun which tips the prickly\npoints of holly leaves with gold, joins in this merry make-believe that\nwinter is still a very, very long way off, and that mayhap he has lost\nhis way altogether, and is never coming to this balmy beautiful land\nagain.\n\nJust such a day was the penultimate one of November, 1793, when Lady\nAnthony Dewhurst sat at a desk in the wide bay window of the\ndrawing-room in Combwich Hall, trying to put into a letter to Lady\nBlakeney all that her heart would have wished to express of love and\ngratitude and happiness.\n\nThree whole days had gone by since that exciting night, when before\nbreak of day in the dimly-lighted old church, in the presence of two or\nthree faithful friends, she had plighted her troth to Lord Anthony: even\nwhilst other kind friends--including His Royal Highness--formed part of\nthe little conspiracy which kept her father occupied and, if necessary,\nwould have kept M. Martin-Roget out of the way. Since then her life had\nbeen one continuous dream of perfect bliss. From the moment when after\nthe second religious ceremony in the Roman Catholic church she found\nherself alone in the carriage with milor, and felt his arms--so strong\nand yet so tender--closing round her and his lips pressed to hers in the\nfirst masterful kiss of complete possession, until this hour when she\nsaw his tall, elegant figure hurrying across the garden toward the gate\nand suddenly turning toward the window whence he knew that she was\nwatching him, every hour and every minute had been nothing but unalloyed\nhappiness.\n\nEven there where she had looked for sorrow and difficulty her path had\nbeen made smooth for her. Her father, who she had feared would prove\nhard and irreconcilable, had been tender and forgiving to such an extent\nthat tears almost of shame would gather in her eyes whenever she thought\nof him.\n\nAs soon as she arrived at Combwich Hall she had written a long and\ndeeply affectionate letter to her father, imploring his forgiveness for\nthe deception and unfilial conduct which on her part must so deeply have\ngrieved him. She pleaded for her right to happiness in words of\nimpassioned eloquence, she pleaded for her right to love and to be\nloved, for her right to a home, which a husband's devotion would make a\nparadise for her.\n\nThis letter she had sent by special courier to her father and the very\nnext day she had his reply. She had opened the letter with trembling\nfingers, fearful lest her father's harshness should mar the perfect\nserenity of her life. She was afraid of what he would say, for she knew\nher father well: knew his faults as well as his qualities, his pride,\nhis obstinacy, his unswerving determination and his loyalty to the\nKing's cause--all of which must have been deeply outraged by his\ndaughter's high-handed action. But as she began to read, astonishment,\namazement at once filled her soul: she could hardly trust her\ncomprehension, hardly believe that what she read could indeed be\nreality, and not just the continuance of the happy dream wherein she was\ndwelling these days.\n\nHer father--gently reproachful--had not one single harsh word to utter.\nHe would not, he said, at the close of his life, after so many bitter\ndisappointments, stand in the way of his daughter's happiness: \"You\nshould have trusted me, my child,\" he wrote: and indeed Yvonne could not\nbelieve her eyes. \"I had no idea that your happiness was at stake in\nthis marriage, or I should never have pressed the claims of my own\nwishes in the matter. I have only you in the world left, now that misery\nand exile are to be my portion! Is it likely that I would allow any\npersonal desires to weigh against my love for you?\"\n\nHappy as she was Yvonne cried--cried bitterly with remorse and shame\nwhen she read that letter. How could she have been so blind, so\nsenseless as to misjudge her father so? Her young husband found her in\ntears, and had much ado to console her: he too read the letter and was\ndeeply touched by the kind reference to himself contained therein: \"My\nlord Anthony is a gallant gentleman,\" wrote M. le duc de Kernogan, \"he\nwill make you happy, my child, and your old father will be more than\nsatisfied. All that grieves me is that you did not trust me sooner. A\nclandestine marriage is not worthy of a daughter of the Kernogans.\"\n\n\"I did speak most earnestly to M. le duc,\" said Lord Tony reflectively,\n\"when I begged him to allow me to pay my addresses to you. But then,\" he\nadded cheerfully, \"I am such a clumsy lout when I have to talk at any\nlength--and especially clumsy when I have to plead my own cause. I\nsuppose I put my case so badly before your father, m'dear, that he\nthought me three parts an idiot and would not listen to me.\"\n\n\"I too begged and entreated him, dear,\" she said with a smile, \"but he\nwas very determined then and vowed that I should marry M. Martin-Roget\ndespite my tears and protestations. Dear father! I suppose he didn't\nrealise that I was in earnest.\"\n\n\"He has certainly accepted the inevitable very gracefully,\" was my lord\nTony's final comment.\n\n\nII\n\nThen they read the letter through once more, sitting close together, he\nwith one arm round her shoulder, she nestling against his chest, her\nhair brushing against his lips and with the letter in her hands which\nshe could scarcely read for the tears of joy which filled her eyes.\n\n\"I don't feel very well to-day,\" the letter concluded; \"the dampness and\nthe cold have got into my bones: moreover you two young love birds will\nnot desire company just yet, but to-morrow if the weather is more genial\nI will drive over to Combwich in the afternoon, and perhaps you will\ngive me supper and a bed for the night. Send me word by the courier who\nwill forthwith return to Bath if this will be agreeable to you both.\"\n\nCould anything be more adorable, more delightful? It was just the last\ndrop that filled Yvonne's cup of happiness right up to the brim.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe next afternoon she sat at her desk in order to tell Lady Blakeney\nall about it. She made out a copy of her father's letter and put that in\nwith her own, and begged dear Lady Blakeney to see Lady Ffoulkes\nforthwith and tell her all that had happened. She herself was expecting\nher father every minute and milor Tony had gone as far as the gate to\nsee if the barouche was in sight.\n\nHalf an hour later M. de Kernogan had arrived and his daughter lay in\nhis arms, happy, beyond the dreams of men. He looked rather tired and\nwan and still complained that the cold had got into his bones: evidently\nhe was not very well and Yvonne after the excitement of the meeting felt\nnot a little anxious about him. As the evening wore on he became more\nand more silent; he hardly would eat anything and soon after eight\no'clock he announced his desire to retire to bed.\n\n\"I am not ill,\" he said as he kissed his daughter and bade her a fond\n\"Good-night,\" \"only a little wearied ... with emotion no doubt. I shall\nbe better after a night's rest.\"\n\nHe had been quite cordial with my lord Tony, though not effusive, which\nwas only natural--he was at all times a very reserved man, and--unlike\nthose of his race--never demonstrative in his manner: but with his\ndaughter he had been singularly tender, with a wistful affection which\nalmost suggested remorse, even though it was she who, on his arrival,\nhad knelt down before him and had begged for his blessing and his\nforgiveness.\n\n\nIV\n\nBut the following morning he appeared to be really ill: his cheeks\nlooked sunken, almost livid, his eyes dim and hollow. Nevertheless he\nwould not hear of staying on another day or so.\n\n\"No, no,\" he declared emphatically, \"I shall be better in Bath. It is\nmore sheltered there, here the north winds would drive me to my bed very\nquickly. I shall take a course of baths at once. They did me a great\ndeal of good before, you remember, Yvonne--in September, when I caught a\nchill ... they soon put me right. That is all that ails me now.... I've\ncaught a chill.\"\n\nHe did his best to reassure his daughter, but she was far from\nsatisfied: more especially as he hardly would touch the cup of chocolate\nwhich she had prepared for him with her own hands.\n\n\"I shall be quite myself again in Bath,\" he declared, \"and in a day or\ntwo when you can spare the time--or when milor can spare you--perhaps\nyou will drive over to see how the old father is getting on, eh?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" she said firmly, \"I shall not allow you to go to Bath alone.\nIf you will go, I shall accompany you.\"\n\n\"Nay!\" he protested, \"that is foolishness, my child. The barouche will\ntake me back quite comfortably. It is less than two hours' drive and I\nshall be quite safe and comfortable.\"\n\n\"You will be quite safe and comfortable in my company,\" she retorted\nwith a tender, anxious glance at his pale face and the nervous tremor of\nhis hands. \"I have consulted with my dear husband and he has given his\nconsent that I should accompany you.\"\n\n\"But you can't leave milor like that, my child,\" he protested once more.\n\"He will be lonely and miserable without you.\"\n\n\"Yes. I think he will,\" she said wistfully. \"But he will be all the\nhappier when you are well again, and I can return to Combwich\nsatisfied.\"\n\nWhereupon M. le duc yielded. He kissed and thanked his daughter and\nseemed even relieved at the prospect of her company. The barouche was\nordered for eleven o'clock, and a quarter of an hour before that time\nLord Tony had his young wife in his arms, bidding her a sad farewell.\n\n\"I hate your going from me, sweetheart,\" he said as he kissed her eyes,\nher hair, her lips. \"I cannot bear you out of my sight even for an hour\n... let alone a couple of days.\"\n\n\"Yet I must go, dear heart,\" she retorted, looking up with that sweet,\ngrave smile of hers into his eager young face. \"I could not let him\ntravel alone ... could I?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he assented somewhat dubiously, \"but remember, dear heart,\nthat you are infinitely precious and that I shall scarce live for sheer\nanxiety until I have you here, safe, once more in my arms.\"\n\n\"I'll send you a courier this evening,\" she rejoined, as she extricated\nherself gently from his embrace, \"and if I can come back to-morrow....\"\n\n\"I'll ride over to Bath in any case in the morning so that I may escort\nyou back if you really can come.\"\n\n\"I will come if I am reassured about father. Oh, my dear lord,\" she\nadded with a wistful little sigh, \"I knew yesterday morning that I was\ntoo happy, and that something would happen to mar the perfect felicity\nof these last few days.\"\n\n\"You are not seriously anxious about M. le duc's health, dear heart?\"\n\n\"No, not seriously anxious. Farewell, milor. It is _au revoir_ ... a few\nhours and we'll resume our dream.\"\n\n\nV\n\nThere was nothing in all that to arouse my lord Tony's suspicions. All\nday he was miserable and forlorn because Yvonne was not there--but he\nwas not suspicious.\n\nFate had a blow in store for him, from which he was destined never\nwholly to recover, but she gave him no warning, no premonition. He spent\nthe day in making up arrears of correspondence, for he had a large\nprivate fortune to administer--trust funds on behalf of brothers and\nsisters who were minors--and he always did it conscientiously and to the\nbest of his ability. The last few days he had lived in a dream and there\nwas an accumulation of business to go through. In the evening he\nexpected the promised courier, who did not arrive: but his was not the\nsort of disposition that would fret and fume because of a contretemps\nwhich might be attributable to the weather--it had rained heavily since\nafternoon--or to sundry trifling causes which he at Combwich, ten or a\ndozen miles from Bath, could not estimate. He had no suspicions even\nthen. How could he have? How could he guess? Nevertheless when he\nultimately went to bed, it was with the firm resolve that he would in\nany case go over to Bath in the morning and remain there until Yvonne\nwas able to come back with him.\n\nCombwich without her was anyhow unendurable.\n\n\nVI\n\nHe started for Bath at nine o'clock in the morning. It was still raining\nhard. It had rained all night and the roads were very muddy. He started\nout without a groom. A little after half-past ten, he drew rein outside\nhis house in Chandos Buildings, and having changed his clothes he\nstarted to walk to Laura Place. The rain had momentarily left off, and a\npale wintry sun peeped out through rolling banks of grey clouds. He went\nround by way of Saw Close and the Upper Borough Walls, as he wanted to\navoid the fashionable throng that crowded the neighbourhood of the Pump\nRoom and the Baths. His intention was to seek out the Blakeneys at their\nresidence in the Circus after he had seen Yvonne and obtained news of M.\nle duc.\n\nHe had no suspicions. Why should he have?\n\nThe Abbey clock struck a quarter-past eleven when finally he knocked at\nthe house in Laura Place. Long afterwards he remembered how just at that\nmoment a dense grey mist descended into the valley. He had not noticed\nit before, now he saw that it had enveloped this part of the city so\nthat he could not even see clearly across the Place.\n\nA woman came to open the door. Lord Tony then thought this strange\nconsidering how particular M. le duc always was about everything\npertaining to the management of his household: \"The house of a poor\nexile,\" he was wont to say, \"but nevertheless that of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Can I go straight up?\" he asked the woman, who he thought was standing\nostentatiously in the hall as if to bar his way. \"I desire to see M. le\nduc.\"\n\n\"Ye can walk upstairs, zir,\" said the woman, speaking with a broad\nSomersetshire accent, \"but I doubt me if ye'll see 'is Grace the Duke.\n'Es been gone these two days.\"\n\nTony had paid no heed to her at first; he had walked across the narrow\nhall to the oak staircase, and was half-way up the first flight when her\nlast words struck upon his ear ... quite without meaning for the moment\n... but nevertheless he paused, one foot on one tread, and the other two\ntreads below ... and he turned round to look at the woman, a swift frown\nacross his smooth forehead.\n\n\"Gone these two days,\" he repeated mechanically; \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well! 'Is Grace left the day afore yesterday--Thursday it was.... 'Is\nman went yesterday afternoon with luggage and sich ... 'e went by coach\n'e did.... Leave off,\" she cried suddenly; \"what are ye doin'? Ye're\n'urtin' me.\"\n\nFor Lord Tony had rushed down the stairs again and was across the hall,\ngripping the unoffending woman by the wrist and glaring into her\nexpressionless face until she screamed with fright.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said humbly as he released her wrist: all the\ninstincts of the courteous gentleman arrayed against his loss of\ncontrol. \"I ... I forgot myself for the moment,\" he stammered; \"would\nyou mind telling me again ... what ... what you said just now?\"\n\nThe woman was prepared to put on the airs of outraged dignity, she even\nglanced up at the malapert with scorn expressed in her small beady eyes.\nBut at sight of his face her anger and her fears both fell away from\nher. Lord Tony was white to the lips, his cheeks were the colour of\ndead ashes, his mouth trembled, his eyes alone glowed with ill-repressed\nanxiety.\n\n\"'Is Grace,\" she said with slow emphasis, for of a truth she thought\nthat the young gentleman was either sick or daft, \"'Is Grace left\nthis 'ouse the day afore yesterday in a hired barouche. 'Is\nman--Frederick--went yesterday afternoon with the liggage. 'E caught the\nBristol coach at two o'clock. I was 'Is Grace's 'ousekeeper and I am to\nlook after the 'ouse and the zervants until I 'ear from 'Is Grace again.\nThem's my orders. I know no more than I'm tellin' ye.\"\n\n\"But His Grace returned here yesterday forenoon,\" argued Lord Tony\ncalmly, mechanically, as one who would wish to convince an obstinate\nchild. \"And my lady ... Mademoiselle Yvonne, you know ... was with him.\"\n\n\"Noa! Noa!\" said the woman placidly. \"'Is Grace 'asn't been near this\n'ouse come Thursday afternoon, and 'is man left yesterday wi' th'\nliggage. Why!\" she added confidentially, \"'e ain't gone far. It was all\nzettled that zuddint I didn't know nothing about it myzelf till I zeed\nMr. Frederick start off wi' th' liggage. Not much liggage neither it\nwasn't. Sure but 'Is Grace'll be 'ome zoon. 'E can't 'ave gone far. Not\nwi' that bit o' liggage. Zure.\"\n\n\"But my lady ... Mademoiselle Yvonne....\"\n\n\"Lor, zir, didn't ye know? Why 'twas all over th' town o' Tuesday as 'ow\nMademozell 'ad eloped with my lord Anthony Dew'urst, and....\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! But you have seen my lady since?\"\n\n\"Not clapped eyes on 'er, zir, since she went to the ball come Monday\nevenin'. An' a picture she looked in 'er white gown....\"\n\n\"And ... did His Grace leave no message ... for ... for anyone?... no\nletter?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, now you come to mention it, zir. Mr. Frederick 'e give me a\nletter yesterday. ''Is Grace,' sez 'e, 'left this yere letter on 'is\ndesk. I just found it,' sez 'e. 'If my lord Anthony Dew'urst calls,' sez\n'e, 'give it to 'im.' I've got the letter zomewhere, zir. What may your\nname be?\"\n\n\"I am Lord Anthony Dewhurst,\" replied the young man mechanically.\n\n\"Your pardon, my lord, I'll go fetch th' letter.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nLord Tony never moved while the woman shuffled across the passage and\ndown the back stairs. He was like a man who has received a knock-out\nblow and has not yet had time to recover his scattered senses. At first\nwhen the woman spoke, his mind had jumped to fears of some awful\naccident ... runaway horses ... a broken barouche ... or a sudden\naggravation of the duc's ill-health. But soon he was forced to reject\nwhat now would have seemed a consoling thought: had there been an\naccident, he would have heard--a rumour would have reached him--Yvonne\nwould have sent a courier. He did not know yet what to think, his mind\nwas like a slate over which a clumsy hand had passed a wet\nsponge--impressions, recollections, above all a hideous, nameless fear,\nwere all blurred and confused within his brain.\n\nThe woman came back carrying a letter which was crumpled and greasy from\na prolonged sojourn in the pocket of her apron. Lord Tony took the\nletter and broke its heavy seal. The woman watched him, curiously,\npityingly now, for he was good to look on, and she scented the\nsignificance of the tragedy which she had been the means of revealing\nto him. But he had become quite unconscious of her presence, of\neverything in fact save those few sentences, written in French, in a\ncramped hand, and which seemed to dance a wild saraband before his eyes:\n\n     \"MILOR,--\n\n     \"You tried to steal my daughter from me, but I have taken her from\n     you now. By the time this reaches you we shall be on the high seas\n     on our way to Holland, thence to Coblentz, where Mademoiselle de\n     Kernogan will in accordance with my wishes be united in lawful\n     marriage to M. Martin-Roget whom I have chosen to be her husband.\n     She is not and never was your wife. As far as one may look into the\n     future, I can assure you that you will never in life see her\n     again.\"\n\nAnd to this monstrous document of appalling callousness and cold-blooded\ncruelty there was appended the signature of Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Dieudonn\u00c3\u00a9 Duc de\nKernogan.\n\nBut unlike the writer thereof Lord Anthony Dewhurst neither stormed nor\nraged: he did not even tear the execrable letter into an hundred\nfragments. His firm hand closed over it with one convulsive clutch, and\nthat was all. Then he slipped the crumpled paper into his pocket. Quite\ndeliberately he took out some money and gave a piece of silver to the\nwoman.\n\n\"I thank you very much,\" he said somewhat haltingly. \"I quite understand\neverything now.\"\n\nThe woman curtseyed and thanked him; tears were in her eyes, for it\nseemed to her that never had she seen such grief depicted upon any human\nface. She preceded him to the hall door and held it open for him, while\nhe passed out. After the brief gleam of sunshine it had started to rain\nagain, but he didn't seem to care. The woman suggested fetching a\nhackney coach, but he refused quite politely, quite gently: he even\nlifted his hat as he went out. Obviously he did not know what he was\ndoing. Then he went out into the rain and strode slowly across the\nPlace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\n\n\nI\n\nInstinct kept him away from the more frequented streets--and instinct\nafter awhile drew him in the direction of his friend's house at the\ncomer of The Circus. Sir Percy Blakeney had not gone out fortunately:\nthe lacquey who opened the door to my lord Tony stared astonished and\nalmost paralysed for the moment at the extraordinary appearance of his\nlordship. Rain dropped down from the brim of his hat on to his\nshoulders: his boots were muddy to the knees, his clothes wringing wet.\nHis eyes were wild and hazy and there was a curious tremor round his\nmouth.\n\nThe lacquey declared with a knowing wink afterwards that his lordship\nmust 'ave been drinkin'!\n\nBut at the moment his sense of duty urged him to show my lord--who was\nhis master's friend--into the library, whatever condition he was in. He\ntook his dripping coat and hat from him and marshalled him across the\nlarge, square hall.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney was sitting at his desk, writing, when Lord Tony was\nshown in. He looked up and at once rose and went to his friend.\n\n\"Sit down, Tony,\" he said quietly, \"while I get you some brandy.\"\n\nHe forced the young man down gently into a chair in front of the fire\nand threw another log into the blaze. Then from a cupboard he fetched a\nflask of brandy and a glass, poured some out and held it to Tony's lips.\nThe latter drank--unresisting--like a child. Then as some warmth\npenetrated into his bones, he leaned forward, resting his elbows on his\nknees and buried his face in his hands. Blakeney waited quietly, sitting\ndown opposite to him, until his friend should be able to speak.\n\n\"And after all that you told me on Monday night!\" were the first words\nwhich came from Tony's quivering lips, \"and the letter you sent me over\non Tuesday! Oh! I was prepared to mistrust Martin-Roget. Why! I never\nallowed her out of my sight!... But her father!... How could I guess?\"\n\n\"Can you tell me exactly what happened?\"\n\nLord Tony drew himself up, and staring vacantly into the fire told his\nfriend the events of the past four days. On Wednesday the courier with\nM. de Kernogan's letter, breathing kindness and forgiveness. On Thursday\nhis arrival and seeming ill-health, on Friday his departure with Yvonne.\nTony spoke quite calmly. He had never been anything but calm since\nfirst, in the house in Laura Place, he had received that awful blow.\n\n\"I ought to have known,\" he concluded dully, \"I ought to have guessed.\nEspecially since you warned me.\"\n\n\"I warned you that Martin-Roget was not the man he pretended to be,\"\nsaid Blakeney gently, \"I warned you against him. But I too failed to\nsuspect the duc de Kernogan. We are Britishers, you and I, my dear\nTony,\" he added with a quaint little laugh, \"our minds will never be\nquite equal to the tortuous ways of these Latin races. But we are not\ngoing to waste time now talking about the past. We have got to find your\nwife before those brutes have time to wreak their devilries against\nher.\"\n\n\"On the high seas ... on the way to Holland ... thence to Coblentz ...\"\nmurmured Tony, \"I have not yet shown you the duc's letter to me.\"\n\nHe drew from his pocket the crumpled, damp piece of paper on which the\nink had run into patches and blotches, and which had become almost\nundecipherable now. Sir Percy took it from him and read it through:\n\n\"The duc de Kernogan and Lady Anthony Dewhurst are not on their way to\nHolland and to Coblentz,\" he said quietly as he handed the letter back\nto Lord Tony.\n\n\"Not on their way to Holland?\" queried the young man with a puzzled\nfrown. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nBlakeney drew his chair closer to his friend: a marvellous and subtle\nchange had suddenly taken place in his individuality. Only a few moments\nago he was the polished, elegant man of the world, then the kindly and\nunderstanding friend--self-contained, reserved, with a perfect manner\nredolent of sympathy and dignity. Suddenly all that was changed. His\nmanner was still perfect and outwardly calm, his gestures scarce, his\nspeech deliberate, but the compelling power of the leader--which is the\nbirth-right of such men--glowed and sparkled now in his deep-set eyes:\nthe spirit of adventure and reckless daring was awake--insistent and\nrampant--and subtle effluvia of enthusiasm and audacity emanated from\nhis entire personality.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney had sunk his individuality in that of the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\n\n\"I mean,\" he said, returning his friend's anxious look with one that was\ninspiring in its unshakable confidence, \"I mean that on Monday last, the\nnight before your wedding--when I urged you to obtain Yvonne de\nKernogan's consent to an immediate marriage--I had followed\nMartin-Roget to a place called \"The Bottom Inn\" on Goblin Combe--a\nplace well known to every smuggler in the county.\"\n\n\"You, Percy!\" exclaimed Tony in amazement.\n\n\"Yes, I,\" laughed the other lightly. \"Why not? I had had my suspicions\nof him for some time. As luck would have it he started off on the Monday\nafternoon by hired coach to Chelwood. I followed. From Chelwood he\nwanted to go on to Redhill: but the roads were axle deep in mud, and\nevening was gathering in very fast. Nobody would take him. He wanted a\nhorse and a guide. I was on the spot--as disreputable a bar-loafer as\nyou ever saw in your life. I offered to take him. He had no choice. He\nhad to take me. No one else had offered. I took him to the Bottom Inn.\nThere he met our esteemed friend M. Chauvelin....\"\n\n\"Chauvelin!\" cried Tony, suddenly roused from the dull apathy of his\nimmeasurable grief, at sound of that name which recalled so many\nexciting adventures, such mad, wild, hair-breadth escapes. \"Chauvelin!\nWhat in the world is he doing here in England?\"\n\n\"Brewing mischief, of course,\" replied Blakeney dryly. \"In disgrace,\ndiscredited, a marked man--what you will--my friend M. Chauvelin has\nstill an infinite capacity for mischief. Through the interstices of a\nbadly fastened shutter I heard two blackguards devising infinite\ndevilry. That is why, Tony,\" he added, \"I urged an immediate marriage as\nthe only real protection for Yvonne de Kernogan against those\nblackguards.\"\n\n\"Would to God you had been more explicit!\" exclaimed Tony with a bitter\nsigh.\n\n\"Would to God I had,\" rejoined the other, \"but there was so little time,\nwith licences and what not all to arrange for, and less than an hour to\ndo it in. And would you have suspected the Duc himself of such\nexecrable duplicity even if you had known, as I did then, that the\nso-called Martin-Roget hath name Adet, and that he matures thoughts of\ndeadly revenge against the duc de Kernogan and his daughter?\"\n\n\"Martin-Roget? the banker--the exiled royalist who....\"\n\n\"He may be a banker now ... but he certainly is no royalist--he is the\nson of a peasant who was unjustly put to death four years ago by the duc\nde Kernogan.\"\n\n\"Ye gods!\"\n\n\"He came over to England plentifully supplied with money--I could not\ngather if the money is his or if it has been entrusted to him by the\nrevolutionary government for purposes of spying and corruption--but he\ncame to England in order to ingratiate himself with the duc de Kernogan\nand his daughter, and then to lure them back to France, for what purpose\nyou may well imagine.\"\n\n\"Good God, man ... you can't mean ...?\"\n\n\"He has chartered a smuggler's craft--or rather Chauvelin has done it\nfor him. Her name is the _Hollandia_, her master hath name Kuyper. She\nwas to be in Portishead harbour on the last day of November: all her\npapers in order. Cargo of West India sugar, destination Amsterdam,\nconsignee some Mynheer over there. But Martin-Roget, or whatever his\nname may be, and no doubt our friend Chauvelin too, were to be aboard\nher, and also M. le duc de Kernogan and his daughter. And the\n_Hollandia_ is to put into Le Croisic for Nantes, whose revolutionary\nproconsul, that infamous Carrier, is of course Chauvelin's bosom\nfriend.\"\n\nSir Percy Blakeney finished speaking. Lord Tony had listened to him\nquietly and in silence: now he rose and turned resolutely to his\nfriend. There was no longer any trace in him of that stunned apathy\nwhich had been the primary result of the terrible blow. His young face\nwas still almost unrecognisable from the lines of grief and horror which\nmarred its habitual fresh, boyish look. He looked twenty years older\nthan he had done a few hours ago, but there was also in his whole\nattitude now the virility of more mature manhood, its determination and\nunswerving purpose.\n\n\"And what can I do now?\" he asked simply, knowing that he could trust\nhis friend and leader with what he held dearest in all the world.\n\"Without you, Blakeney, I am of course impotent and lost. I haven't the\nhead to think. I haven't sufficient brains to pit against those cunning\ndevils. But if you will help me....\"\n\nThen he checked himself abruptly, and the look of hopeless despair once\nmore crept into his eyes.\n\n\"I am mad, Percy,\" he said with a self-deprecating shrug of the\nshoulders, \"gone crazy with grief, I suppose, or I shouldn't talk of\nasking your help, of risking your life in my cause.\"\n\n\"Tony, if you talk that rubbish, I shall be forced to punch your head,\"\nretorted Blakeney with his light laugh. \"Why man,\" he added gaily,\n\"can't you see that I am aching to have at my old friend Chauvelin\nagain?\"\n\nAnd indeed the zest of adventure, the zest to fight, never dormant, was\nglowing with compelling vigour now in those lazy eyes of his which were\nresting with such kindliness upon his stricken friend. \"Go home, Tony!\"\nhe added, \"go, you rascal, and collect what things you want, while I\nsend for Hastings and Ffoulkes, and see that four good horses are ready\nfor us within the hour. To-night we sleep at Portishead, Tony. The\n_Day-Dream_ is lying off there, ready to sail at any hour of the day or\nnight. The _Hollandia_ has twenty-four hours' start of us, alas! and we\ncannot overtake her now: but we'll be in Nantes ere those devils can do\nmuch mischief: and once in Nantes!... Why, Tony man! think of the\nglorious escapes we've had together, you and I! Think of the gay, mad\nrides across the north of France, with half-fainting women and swooning\nchildren across our saddle-bows! Think of the day when we smuggled the\nde Tournais out of Calais harbour, the day we snatched Juliette\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and her Paul out of the tumbril and tore across Paris with\nthat howling mob at our heels! Think! think, Tony! of all the happiest,\nmerriest moments of your life and they will seem dull and lifeless\nbeside what is in store for you, when with your dear wife's arms\nclinging round your neck, we'll fly along the quays of Nantes on the\nroad to liberty! Ah, Tony lad! were it not for the anxiety which I know\nis gnawing at your heart, I would count this one of the happiest hours\nof my happy life!\"\n\nHe was so full of enthusiasm, so full of vitality, that life itself\nseemed to emanate from him and to communicate itself to the very\natmosphere around. Hope lit up my lord Tony's wan face: he believed in\nhis friend as medi\u00c3\u00a6val ascetics believed in the saints whom they adored.\nEnthusiasm had crept into his veins, dull despair fell away from him\nlike a mantle.\n\n\"God bless you, Percy,\" he exclaimed as his firm and loyal hand grasped\nthat of the leader whom he revered.\n\n\"Nay!\" retorted Blakeney with sudden gravity. \"He hath done that\nalready. Pray for His help to-day, lad, as you have never prayed\nbefore.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMARGUERITE\n\n\nI\n\nLord Tony had gone, and for the space of five minutes Sir Percy Blakeney\nstood in front of the hearth staring into the fire. Something lay before\nhim, something had to be done now, which represented the heavy price\nthat had to be paid for those mad and happy adventures, for that\nreckless daring, aye for that selfless supreme sacrifice which was as\nthe very breath of life to the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nAnd in the dancing flames he could see Marguerite's blue eyes, her\nardent hair, her tender smile all pleading with him not to go. She had\nso much to give him--so much happiness, such an infinity of love, and he\nwas all that she had in the world! It seemed to him as if he could feel\nher arms around him even now, as if he could hear her voice whispering\nappealingly: \"Do not go! Am I nothing to you that thoughts of others\nshould triumph over my pleading? that the need of others should outweigh\nmine own most pressing need? I want you, Percy! aye! even I! You have\ndone so much for others--it is my turn now.\"\n\nBut even as in a kind of trance those words seemed to reach his strained\nsenses, he knew that he must go, that he must tear himself away once\nmore from the clinging embrace of her dear arms and shut his eyes to the\ntears which anon would fill her own. Destiny demanded that he should go.\nHe had chosen his path in life himself, at first only in a spirit of\nwild recklessness, a mad tossing of his life into the scales of Fate.\nBut now that same destiny which he had chosen had become his master: he\nno longer could draw back. What he had done once, twenty times, an\nhundred times, that he must do again, all the while that the weak and\nthe defenceless called mutely to him from across the seas, all the while\nthat innocent women suffered and orphaned children cried.\n\nAnd to-day it was his friend, his comrade, who had come to him in his\ndistress: the young wife whom he idolised was in the most dire peril\nthat could possibly threaten any woman: she was at the mercy of a man\nwho, driven by the passion of revenge, meant to show her no mercy, and\nthe devil alone knew these days to what lengths of infamy a man so\ndriven would go.\n\nThe minutes sped on. Blakeney's eyes grew hot and wearied from staring\ninto the fire. He closed them for a moment and then quietly turned to\ngo.\n\n\nII\n\nAll those who knew Marguerite Blakeney these days marvelled if she was\never unhappy. Lady Ffoulkes, who was her most trusted friend, vowed that\nshe was not. She had moments--days--sometimes weeks of intense anxiety,\nwhich amounted to acute agony. Whenever she saw her husband start on one\nof those expeditions to France wherein every minute, every hour, he\nrisked his life and more in order to snatch yet another threatened\nvictim from the awful clutches of those merciless Terrorists, she\nendured soul-torture such as few women could have withstood who had not\nher splendid courage and her boundless faith. But against such crushing\nsorrow she had to set off the happiness of those reunions with the man\nwhom she loved so passionately--happiness which was so great, that it\noverrode and conquered the very memory of past anxieties.\n\nMarguerite Blakeney suffered terribly at times--at others she was\noverwhelmingly happy--the measure of her life was made up of the bitter\ndregs of sorrow and the sparkling wine of joy! No! she was not\naltogether unhappy: and gradually that enthusiasm which irradiated from\nthe whole personality of the valiant Scarlet Pimpernel, which dominated\nhis every action, entered into Marguerite Blakeney's blood too. His\nvitality was so compelling, those impulses which carried him headlong\ninto unknown dangers were so generous and were actuated by such pure\nselflessness, that the noble-hearted woman whose very soul was wrapped\nup in the idolised husband, allowed herself to ride by his side on the\nbuoyant waves of his enthusiasm and of his desires: she smothered every\nexpression of anxiety, she swallowed her tears, she learned to say the\nword \"Good-bye\" and forgot the word \"Stay!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was half an hour after midday when Percy knocked at the door of her\nboudoir. She had just come in from a walk in the meadows round the town\nand along the bank of the river: the rain had overtaken her and she had\ncome in very wet, but none the less exhilarated by the movement and the\nkeen, damp, salt-laden air which came straight over the hills from the\nChannel. She had taken off her hat and her mantle and was laughing gaily\nwith her maid who was shaking the wet out of a feather. She looked round\nat her husband when he entered, and with a quick gesture ordered the\nmaid out of the room.\n\nShe had learned to read every line on Percy's face, every expression of\nhis lazy, heavy-lidded eyes. She saw that he was dressed with more than\nhis usual fastidiousness, but in dark clothes and travelling mantle. She\nknew, moreover, by that subtle instinct which had become a second nature\nand which warned her whenever he meant to go.\n\nNor did he announce his departure to her in so many words. As soon as\nthe maid had gone, he took his beloved in his arms.\n\n\"They have stolen Tony's wife from him,\" he said with that light, quaint\nlaugh of his. \"I told you that the man Martin-Roget had planned some\ndevilish mischief--well! he has succeeded so far, thanks to that\nunspeakable fool the duc de Kernogan.\"\n\nHe told her briefly the history of the past few days.\n\n\"Tony did not take my warning seriously enough,\" he concluded with a\nsigh; \"he ought never to have allowed his wife out of his sight.\"\n\nMarguerite had not interrupted him while he spoke. At first she just lay\nin his arms, quiescent and listening, nerving herself by a supreme\neffort not to utter one sigh of misery or one word of appeal. Then, as\nher knees shook under her, she sank back into a chair by the hearth and\nhe knelt beside her with his arms clasped tightly round her shoulders,\nhis cheek pressed against hers. He had no need to tell her that duty and\nfriendship called, that the call of honour was once again--as it so\noften has been in the world--louder than that of love.\n\nShe understood and she knew, and he, with that supersensitive instinct\nof his, understood the heroic effort which she made.\n\n\"Your love, dear heart,\" he whispered, \"will draw me back safely home as\nit hath so often done before. You believe that, do you not?\"\n\nAnd she had the supreme courage to murmur: \"Yes!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE ROAD TO PORTISHEAD\n\n\nI\n\nIt was not until Bath had very obviously been left behind that Yvonne de\nKernogan--Lady Anthony Dewhurst--realised that she had been trapped.\n\nDuring the first half-hour of the journey her father had lain back\nagainst the cushions of the carriage with eyes closed, his face pale and\nwan as if with great suffering. Yvonne, her mind a prey to the gravest\nanxiety, sat beside him, holding his limp cold hand in hers. Once or\ntwice she ventured on a timid question as to his health and he\ninvariably murmured a feeble assurance that he felt well, only very\ntired and disinclined to talk. Anon she suggested--diffidently, for she\ndid not mean to disturb him--that the driver did not appear to know his\nway into Bath, he had turned into a side road which she felt sure was\nnot the right one. M. le duc then roused himself for a moment from his\nlethargy. He leaned forward and gazed out of the window.\n\n\"The man is quite right, Yvonne,\" he said quietly, \"he knows his way. He\nbrought me along this road yesterday. He gets into Bath by a slight\nd\u00c3\u00a9tour but it is pleasanter driving.\"\n\nThis reply satisfied her. She was a stranger in the land, and knew\nlittle or nothing of the environs of Bath. True, last Monday morning\nafter the ceremony of her marriage she had driven out to Combwich, but\ndawn was only just breaking then, and she had lain for the most\npart--wearied and happy--in her young husband's arms. She had taken\nscant note of roads and signposts.\n\nA few minutes later the coach came to a halt and Yvonne, looking through\nthe window, saw a man who was muffled up to the chin and enveloped in a\nhuge travelling cape, mount swiftly up beside the driver.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" she queried sharply.\n\n\"Some friend of the coachman's, no doubt,\" murmured her father in reply,\n\"to whom he is giving a lift as far as Bath.\"\n\nThe barouche had moved on again.\n\nYvonne could not have told you why, but at her father's last words she\nhad felt a sudden cold grip at her heart--the first since she started.\nIt was neither fear nor yet suspicion, but a chill seemed to go right\nthrough her. She gazed anxiously through the window, and then looked at\nher father with eyes that challenged and that doubted. But M. le duc\nwould not meet her gaze. He had once more closed his eyes and sat quite\nstill, pale and haggard, like a man who is suffering acutely.\n\n\nII\n\n\"Father we are going back to Bath, are we not?\"\n\nThe query came out trenchant and hard from her throat which now felt\nhoarse and choked. Her whole being was suddenly pervaded by a vast and\nnameless fear. Time had gone on, and there was no sign in the distance\nof the great city. M. de Kernogan made no reply, but he opened his eyes\nand a curious glance shot from them at the terror-stricken face of his\ndaughter.\n\nThen she knew--knew that she had been tricked and trapped--that her\nfather had played a hideous and complicated r\u00c3\u00b4le of hypocrisy and\nduplicity in order to take her away from the husband whom she idolised.\n\nFear and her love for the man of her choice gave her initiative and\nstrength. Before M. de Kernogan could realise what she was doing, before\nhe could make a movement to stop her, she had seized the handle of the\ncarriage door, wrenched the door open and jumped out into the road. She\nfell on her face in the mud, but the next moment she picked herself up\nagain and started to run--down the road which the carriage had just\ntraversed, on and on as fast as she could go. She ran on blindly,\nunreasoningly, impelled by a purely physical instinct to escape, not\nthinking how childish, how futile such an attempt was bound to be.\n\nAlready after the first few minutes of this swift career over the muddy\nroad, she heard quick, heavy footsteps behind her. Her father could not\nrun like that--the coachman could not have thus left his horses--but\nstill she could hear those footsteps at a run--a quicker run than\nhers--and they were gaining on her--every minute, every second. The\nnext, she felt two powerful arms suddenly seizing her by the shoulders.\nShe stumbled and would once more have fallen, but for those same strong\narms which held her close.\n\n\"Let me go! Let me go!\" she cried, panting.\n\nBut she was held and could no longer move. She looked up into the face\nof Martin-Roget, who without any hesitation or compunction lifted her up\nas if she had been a bale of light goods and carried her back toward the\ncoach. She had forgotten the man who had been picked up on the road\nawhile ago, and had been sitting beside the coachman since.\n\nHe deposited her in the barouche beside her father, then quietly closed\nthe door and once more mounted to his seat on the box. The carriage\nmoved on again. M. de Kernogan was no longer lethargic, he looked down\non his daughter's inert form beside him, and not one look of tenderness\nor compassion softened the hard callousness of his face.\n\n\"Any resistance, my child,\" he said coldly, \"will as you see be useless\nas well as undignified. I deplore this necessary violence, but I should\nbe forced once more to requisition M. Martin-Roget's help if you\nattempted such foolish tricks again. When you are a little more calm, we\nwill talk openly together.\"\n\nFor the moment she was lying back against the cushions of the carriage;\nher nerves having momentarily given way before this appalling\ncatastrophe which had overtaken her and the hideous outrage to which she\nwas being subjected by her own father. She was sobbing convulsively. But\nin the face of his abominable callousness, she made a great effort to\nregain her self-control. Her pride, her dignity came to the rescue. She\nhad had time in those few seconds to realise that she was indeed more\nhelpless than any bird in a fowler's net, and that only absolute calm\nand presence of mind could possibly save her now.\n\nIf indeed there was the slightest hope of salvation.\n\nShe drew herself up and resolutely dried her eyes and readjusted her\nhair and her hood and mantle.\n\n\"We can talk openly at once, sir,\" she said coldly. \"I am ready to hear\nwhat explanation you can offer for this monstrous outrage.\"\n\n\"I owe you no explanation, my child,\" he retorted calmly. \"Presently\nwhen you are restored to your own sense of dignity and of self-respect\nyou will remember that a lady of the house of Kernogan does not elope in\nthe night with a stranger and a heretic like some kitchen-wench. Having\nso far forgotten herself my daughter must, alas! take the consequences,\nwhich I deplore, of her own sins and lack of honour.\"\n\n\"And no doubt, father,\" she retorted, stung to the quick by his insults,\n\"that you too will anon be restored to your own sense of self-respect\nand remember that hitherto no gentleman of the house of Kernogan has\nacted the part of a liar and of a hypocrite!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" he commanded sternly.\n\n\"Yes!\" she reiterated wildly, \"it was the r\u00c3\u00b4le of a liar and of a\nhypocrite that you played from the moment when you sat down to pen that\nletter full of protestations of affection and forgiveness, until like a\nveritable Judas you betrayed your own daughter with a kiss. Shame on\nyou, father!\" she cried. \"Shame!\"\n\n\"Enough!\" he said, as he seized her wrist so roughly that the cry of\npain which involuntarily escaped her effectually checked the words in\nher mouth. \"You are mad, beside yourself, a thoughtless, senseless\ncreature whom I shall have to coerce more effectually if you do not\ncease your ravings. Do not force me to have recourse once again to M.\nMartin-Roget's assistance to keep your undignified outburst in check.\"\n\nThe name of the man whom she had learned to hate and fear more than any\nother human being in the world was sufficient to restore to her that\nmeasure of self-control which had again threatened to leave her.\n\n\"Enough indeed,\" she said more calmly; \"the brain that could devise and\ncarry out such infamy in cold blood is not like to be influenced by a\ndefenceless woman's tears. Will you at least tell me whither you are\ntaking me?\"\n\n\"We go to a place on the coast now,\" he replied coldly, \"the outlandish\nname of which has escaped me. There we embark for Holland, from whence\nwe shall join their Royal Highnesses at Coblentz. It is at Coblentz\nthat your marriage with M. Martin-Roget will take place, and....\"\n\n\"Stay, father,\" she broke in, speaking quite as calmly as he did, \"ere\nyou go any further. Understand me clearly, for I mean every word that I\nsay. In the sight of God--if not in that of the laws of France--I am the\nwife of Lord Anthony Dewhurst. By everything that I hold most sacred and\nmost dear I swear to you that I will never become Martin-Roget's wife. I\nwould die first,\" she added with burning but resolutely suppressed\npassion.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Pshaw, my child,\" he said quietly, \"many a time since the world began\nhave women registered such solemn and sacred vows, only to break them\nwhen force of circumstance and their own good sense made them ashamed of\ntheir own folly.\"\n\n\"How little you know me, father,\" was all that she said in reply.\n\n\nIII\n\nIndeed, Yvonne de Kernogan--Yvonne Dewhurst as she was now in sight of\nGod and men--had far too much innate dignity and self-respect to\ncontinue this discussion, seeing that in any case she was physically the\nweaker, and that she was absolutely helpless and defenceless in the\nhands of two men, one of whom--her own father--who should have been her\nprotector, was leagued with her bitterest enemy against her.\n\nThat Martin-Roget was her enemy--aye and her father's too--she had\nabsolutely no doubt. Some obscure yet keen instinct was working in her\nheart, urging her to mistrust him even more wholly than she had done\nbefore. Just now, when he laid ruthless hands on her and carried her,\ninert and half-swooning, back into the coach, and she lay with closed\neyes, her very soul in revolt against this contact with him, against the\nfeel of his arms around her, a vague memory surcharged with horror and\nwith dread stirred within her brain: and over the vista of the past few\nyears she looked back upon an evening in the autumn--a rough night with\nthe wind from the Atlantic blowing across the lowlands of Poitou and\nsoughing in the willow trees that bordered the Loire--she seemed to hear\nthe tumultuous cries of enraged human creatures dominating the sound of\nthe gale, she felt the crowd of evil-intentioned men around the closed\ncarriage wherein she sat, calm and unafraid. Darkness then was all\naround her. She could not see. She could only hear and feel. And she\nheard the carriage door being wrenched open, and she felt the cold\nbreath of the wind upon her cheek, and also the hot breath of a man in a\npassion of fury and of hate.\n\nShe had seen nothing then, and mercifully semi-unconsciousness had\ndulled her aching senses, but even now her soul shrunk with horror at\nthe vague remembrance of that ghostlike form--the spirit of hate and of\nrevenge--of its rough arms encircling her shoulders, its fingers under\nher chin--and then that awful, loathsome, contaminating kiss which she\nthought then would have smirched her for ever. It had taken all the\npure, sweet kisses of a brave and loyal man whom she loved and revered,\nto make her forget that hideous, indelible stain: and in the arms of her\ndear milor she had forgotten that one terrible moment, when she had felt\nthat the embrace of death must be more endurable than that of this\nunknown and hated man.\n\nIt was the memory of that awful night which had come back to her as in a\nflash while she lay passive and broken in Martin-Roget's arms. Of\ncourse for the moment she had no thought of connecting the rich banker\nfrom Brest, the enthusiastic royalist and _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_, with one of those\nturbulent, uneducated peasant lads who had attacked her carriage that\nnight: all that she was conscious of was that she was outraged by his\npresence, just as she had been outraged then, and that the contact of\nhis hands, of his arms, was absolutely unendurable.\n\nTo fight against the physical power which held her a helpless prisoner\nin the hands of the enemy was sheer impossibility. She knew that, and\nwas too proud to make feeble and futile efforts which could only end in\ndefeat and further humiliation. She felt hideously wretched and\nlonely--thoughts of her husband, who at this hour was still serenely\nunconscious of the terrible catastrophe which had befallen him, brought\ntears of acute misery to her eyes. What would he do when--to-morrow,\nperhaps--he realised that his bride had been stolen from him, that he\nhad been fooled and duped as she had been too. What could he do when he\nknew?\n\nShe tried to solace her own soul-agony by thinking of his influential\nfriends who, of course, would help him as soon as they knew. There was\nthat mysterious and potent friend of whom he spoke so little, who\nalready had warned him of coming danger and urged on the secret marriage\nwhich should have proved a protection. There was Sir Percy Blakeney, of\nwhom he spoke much, who was enormously rich, independent, the most\nintimate friend of the Regent himself. There was....\n\nBut what was the use of clinging even for one instant to those feeble\ncords of Hope's broken lyre? By the time her dear lord knew that she was\ngone, she would be on the high seas, far out of his reach.\n\nAnd she had not even the solace of tears--heart-broken sobs rose in her\nthroat, but she resolutely kept them back. Her father's cold, impassive\nface, the callous glitter in his eyes told her that every tear would be\nin vain, her most earnest appeal an object for his sneers.\n\n\nIV\n\nAs to how long the journey in the coach lasted after that Yvonne\nDewhurst could not have said. It may have been a few hours, it may have\nbeen a cycle of years. She had been young--a happy bride, a dutiful\ndaughter--when she left Combwich Hall. She was an old woman now, a\nsupremely unhappy one, parted from the man she loved without hope of\never seeing him again in life, and feeling nothing but hatred and\ncontempt for the father who had planned such infamy against her.\n\nShe offered no resistance whatever to any of her father's commands.\nAfter the first outburst of revolt and indignation she had not even\nspoken to him.\n\nThere was a halt somewhere on the way, when in the low-raftered room of\na posting-inn, she had to sit at table with the two men who had\ncompassed her misery. She was thirsty, feverish and weak: she drank some\nmilk in silence. She felt ill physically as well as mentally, and the\nconstant effort not to break down had helped to shatter her nerves. As\nshe had stepped out of the barouche without a word, so she stepped into\nit again when it stood outside, ready with a fresh relay of horses to\ntake her further, still further, away from the cosy little nest where\neven now her young husband was waiting longingly for her return. The\npeople of the inn--a kindly-looking woman, a portly middle-aged man, one\nor two young ostlers and serving-maids were standing about in the yard\nwhen her father led her to the coach. For a moment the wild idea rushed\nto her mind to run to these people and demand their protection, to\nproclaim at the top of her voice the infamous act which was dragging her\naway from her husband and her home, and lead her a helpless prisoner to\na fate that was infinitely worse than death. She even ran to the woman\nwho looked so benevolent and so kind, she placed her small quivering\nhand on the other's rough toil-worn one and in hurried, appealing words\nbegged for her help and the shelter of a home till she could communicate\nwith her husband.\n\nThe woman listened with a look of kindly pity upon her homely face, she\npatted the small, trembling hand and stroked it gently, tears of\ncompassion gathered in her eyes:\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dear,\" she said soothingly, speaking as she would to a\nsick woman or to a child, \"I quite understand. I wouldna' fret if I was\nyou. I would jess go quietly with your pore father: 'e knows what's best\nfor you, that 'e do. You come 'long wi' me,\" she added as she drew\nYvonne's hands through her arm, \"I'll see ye're comfortable in the\ncoach.\"\n\nYvonne, bewildered, could not at first understand either the woman's\nsympathy or her obvious indifference to the pitiable tale, until--Oh!\nthe shame of it!--she saw the two young serving-maids looking on her\nwith equal pity expressed in their round eyes, and heard one of them\nwhispering to the other:\n\n\"Pore lady! so zad ain't it? I'm that zorry for the pore father!\"\n\nAnd the girl with a significant gesture indicated her own forehead and\nglanced knowingly at her companion. Yvonne felt a hot flush rise to the\nvery roots of her hair. So her father and Martin-Roget had thought of\neverything, and had taken every precaution to cut the ground from under\nher feet. Wherever a halt was necessary, wherever the party might come\nin contact with the curious or the indifferent, it would be given out\nthat the poor young lady was crazed, that she talked wildly, and had to\nbe kept under restraint.\n\nYvonne as she turned away from that last faint glimmer of hope,\nencountered Martin-Roget's glance of triumph and saw the sneer which\ncurled his full lips. Her father came up to her just then and took her\nover from the kindly hostess, with the ostentatious manner of one who\nhas charge of a sick person, and must take every precaution for her\nwelfare.\n\n\"Another loss of dignity, my child,\" he said to her in French, so that\nnone but Martin-Roget could catch what he said. \"I guessed that you\nwould commit some indiscretion, you see, so M. Martin-Roget and myself\nwarned all the people at the inn the moment we arrived. We told them\nthat I was travelling with a sick daughter who had become crazed through\nthe death of her lover, and believed herself--like most crazed persons\ndo--to be persecuted and oppressed. You have seen the result. They\npitied you. Even the serving-maids smiled. It would have been wiser to\nremain silent.\"\n\nWhereupon he handed her into the barouche with loving care, a crowd of\nsympathetic onlookers gazing with obvious compassion on the poor crazed\nlady and her sorely tried father.\n\nAfter this episode Yvonne gave up the struggle.\n\nNo one but God could help her, if He chose to perform a miracle.\n\n\nV\n\nThe rest of the journey was accomplished in silence. Yvonne gazed,\nunseeing, through the carriage window as the barouche rattled on the\ncobble-stones of the streets of Bristol. She marvelled at the number of\npeople who went gaily by along the streets, unheeding, unknowing that\nthe greatest depths of misery to which any human being could sink had\nbeen probed by the unfortunate young girl who wide-eyed, mute and\nbroken-hearted gazed out upon the busy world without.\n\nPortishead was reached just when the grey light of day turned to a\ngloomy twilight. Yvonne unresisting, insentient, went whither she was\nbidden to go. Better that, than to feel Martin-Roget's coercive grip on\nher arm, or to hear her father's curt words of command.\n\nShe walked along the pier and anon stepped into a boat, hardly knowing\nwhat she was doing: the twilight was welcome to her, for it hid much\nfrom her view and her eyes--hot with unshed tears--ached for the restful\ngloom. She realised that the boat was being rowed along for some little\nway down the stream, that Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rick, who had come she knew not how or\nwhence, was in the boat too with some luggage which she recognised as\nbeing familiar: that another woman was there whom she did not know, but\nwho appeared to look after her comforts, wrapped a shawl closer round\nher knees and drew the hood of her mantle closer round her neck. But it\nwas all like an ugly dream: the voices of her father and of\nMartin-Roget, who were talking in monosyllables, the sound of the oars\nas they struck the water, or creaked in their rowlocks, came to her as\nfrom an ever-receding distance.\n\nA couple of hours later she came back to complete consciousness. She\nwas in a narrow place, which at first appeared to her like a cupboard:\nthe atmosphere was both cold and stuffy and reeked of tar and of oil.\nShe was lying on a hard bed with her mantle and a shawl wrapped round\nher. It was very dark save where the feeble glimmer of a lamp threw a\ncircle of light around. Above her head there was a constant and heavy\ntramping of feet, and the sound of incessant and varied creakings and\ngroanings of wood, cordage and metal filled the night air with their\nweird and dismal sounds. A slow feeling of movement coupled with a\ngentle oscillation confirmed the unfortunate girl's first waking\nimpression that she was on board a ship. How she had got there she did\nnot know. She must ultimately have fainted in the small boat and been\ncarried aboard. She raised herself slightly on her elbow and peered\nround her into the dark corners of the cabin: opposite to her upon a\nbench, also wrapped up in shawl and mantle, lay the woman who had been\nin attendance on her in the boat.\n\nThe woman's heavy breathing indicated that she was fast asleep.\n\nLoneliness! Misery! Desolation encompassed the happy bride of yesterday.\nWith a moan of exquisite soul-agony she fell back against the hard\ncushions, and for the first time this day a convulsive flow of tears\neased the superacuteness of her misery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE COAST OF FRANCE\n\n\nI\n\nThe whole of that wretched mournful day Yvonne Dewhurst spent upon the\ndeck of the ship which was bearing her away every hour, every minute,\nfurther and still further from home and happiness. She seldom spoke: she\nate and drank when food was brought to her: she was conscious neither of\ncold nor of wet, of well-being or ill. She sat upon a pile of cordages\nin the stern of the ship leaning against the taffrail and in imagination\nseeing the coast of England fade into illimitable space.\n\nPart of the time it rained, and then she sat huddled up in the shawls\nand tarpaulins which the woman placed about her: then, when the sun came\nout, she still sat huddled up, closing her eyes against the glare.\n\nWhen daylight faded into dusk, and then twilight into night she gazed\ninto nothingness as she had gazed on water and sky before, thinking,\nthinking, thinking! This could not be the end--it could not. So much\nhappiness, such pure love, such perfect companionship as she had had\nwith the young husband whom she idolised could not all be wrenched from\nher like that, without previous foreboding and without some warning from\nFate. This miserable, sordid, wretched journey to an unknown land could\nnot be the epilogue to the exquisite romance which had suddenly changed\nthe dreary monotony of her life into one long, glowing dream of joy and\nof happiness! This could not be the end!\n\nAnd gazing into the immensity of the far horizon she thought and thought\nand racked her memory for every word, every look which she had had from\nher dear milor. And upon the grey background of sea and sky she seemed\nto perceive the vague and dim outline of that mysterious friend--the man\nwho knew everything--who foresaw everything, even and above all the\ndangers that threatened those whom he loved. He had foreseen this awful\ndanger too! Oh! if only milor and she herself had realised its full\nextent! But now surely! surely! he would help, he would know what to do.\nMilor was wont to speak of him as being omniscient and having marvellous\npowers.\n\nOnce or twice during the day M. le duc de Kernogan came to sit beside\nhis daughter and tried to speak a few words of comfort and of sympathy.\nOf a truth--here on the open sea--far both from home and kindred and\nfrom the new friends he had found in hospitable England--his heart smote\nhim for all the wrong he had done to his only child. He dared not think\nof the gentle and patient wife who lay at rest in the churchyard of\nKernogan, for he feared that with his thoughts he would conjure up her\npale, avenging ghost who would demand an account of what he had done\nwith her child.\n\nCold and exposure--the discomfort of the long sea-journey in this rough\ntrading ship had somewhat damped M. de Kernogan's pride and obstinacy:\nhis loyalty to the cause of his King had paled before the demands of a\nfather's duty toward his helpless daughter.\n\n\nII\n\nIt was close on six o'clock and the night, after the turbulent and\ncapricious alternations of rain and sunshine, promised to be beautifully\nclear, though very cold. The pale crescent of the moon had just emerged\nfrom behind the thick veil of cloud and mist which still hung\nthreateningly upon the horizon: a fitful sheen of silver danced upon the\nwaves.\n\nM. le duc stood beside his daughter. He had inquired after her health\nand well-being and received her monosyllabic reply with an impatient\nsigh. M. Martin-Roget was pacing up and down the deck with restless and\nvigorous strides: he had just gone by and made a loud and cheery comment\non the weather and the beauty of the night.\n\nCould Yvonne Dewhurst have seen her father's face now, or had she cared\nto study it, she would have perceived that he was gazing out to sea in\nthe direction to which the schooner was heading with an intent look of\npuzzlement, and that there was a deep furrow between his brows. Half an\nhour went by and he still stood there, silent and absorbed: then\nsuddenly a curious exclamation escaped his lips: he stooped and seized\nhis daughter by the wrist.\n\n\"Yvonne!\" he said excitedly, \"tell me! am I dreaming, or am I crazed?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked coldly.\n\n\"Out there! Look! Just tell me what you see?\"\n\nHe appeared so excited and his pressure on her wrist was so insistent\nthat she dragged herself to her feet and looked out to sea in the\ndirection to which he was pointing.\n\n\"Tell me what you see,\" he reiterated with ever-growing excitement, and\nshe felt that the hand which held her wrist trembled violently.\n\n\"The light from a lighthouse, I think,\" she said.\n\n\"And besides that?\"\n\n\"Another light--a much smaller one--considerably higher up. It must be\nperched up on some cliffs.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes. There are lights dotted about here and there. Some village on the\ncoast.\"\n\n\"On the coast?\" he murmured hoarsely, \"and we are heading towards it.\"\n\n\"So it appears,\" she said indifferently. What cared she to what shore\nshe was being taken: every land save England was exile to her now.\n\nJust at this moment M. Martin-Roget in his restless wanderings once more\npassed by.\n\n\"M. Martin-Roget!\" called the duc.\n\nAnd vaguely Yvonne wondered why his voice trembled so.\n\n\"At your service, M. le duc,\" replied the other as he came to a halt,\nand then stood with legs wide apart firmly planted upon the deck, his\nhands buried in the pockets of his heavy mantle, his head thrown back,\nas if defiantly, his whole attitude that of a master condescending to\ntalk with slaves.\n\n\"What are those lights over there, ahead of us?\" asked M. le duc\nquietly.\n\n\"The lighthouse of Le Croisic, M. le duc,\" replied Martin-Roget dryly,\n\"and of the guard-house above and the harbour below. All at your\nservice,\" he added, with a sneer.\n\n\"Monsieur....\" exclaimed the duc.\n\n\"Eh? what?\" queried the other blandly.\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\nIn the vague, dim light of the moon Yvonne could just distinguish the\ntwo men as they stood confronting one another. Martin-Roget, tall,\nmassive, with arms now folded across his breast, shrugging his broad\nshoulders at the duc's impassioned query--and her father who suddenly\nappeared to have shrunk within himself, who raised one trembling hand to\nhis forehead and with the other sought with pathetic entreaty the\nsupport of his daughter's arm.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he murmured again.\n\n\"Only,\" replied Martin-Roget with a laugh, \"that we are close to the\ncoast of France and that with this unpleasant but useful north-westerly\nwind we shall be in Nantes two hours before midnight.\"\n\n\"In Nantes?\" queried the duc vaguely, not understanding, speaking\ntonelessly like a somnambulist or a man in a trance. He was leaning\nheavily now on his daughter's arm, and she with that motherly instinct\nwhich is ever present in a good woman's heart even in the presence of\nher most cruel enemy, drew him tenderly towards her, gave him the\nsupport he needed, not quite understanding herself yet what it was that\nhad befallen them both.\n\n\"Yes, in Nantes, M. le duc,\" reiterated Martin-Roget with a sneer.\n\n\"But 'twas to Holland we were going.\"\n\n\"To Nantes, M. le duc,\" retorted the other with a ringing note of\ntriumph in his voice, \"to Nantes, from which you fled like a coward when\nyou realised that the vengeance of an outraged people had at last\novertaken you and your kind.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" stammered the duc, and mechanically\nnow--instinctively--father and daughter clung to one another as if each\nwas striving to protect the other from the raving fury of this madman.\nNever for a moment did they believe that he was sane. Excitement, they\nthought, had turned his brain: he was acting and speaking like one\npossessed.\n\n\"I dare say it would take far longer than the next four hours while we\nglide gently along the Loire, to make such as you understand that your\narrogance and your pride are destined to be humbled at last and that you\nare now in the power of those men who awhile ago you did not deem worthy\nto lick your boots. I dare say,\" he continued calmly, \"you think that I\nam crazed. Well! perhaps I am, but sane enough anyhow, M. le duc, to\nenjoy the full flavour of revenge.\"\n\n\"Revenge?... what have we done?... what has my daughter done?...\"\nstammered the duc incoherently. \"You swore you loved her ... desired to\nmake her your wife ... I consented ... she....\"\n\nMartin-Roget's harsh laugh broke in on his vague murmurings.\n\n\"And like an arrogant fool you fell into the trap,\" he said with calm\nirony, \"and you were too blind to see in Martin-Roget, suitor for your\ndaughter's hand, Pierre Adet, the son of the victim of your execrable\ntyranny, the innocent man murdered at your bidding.\"\n\n\"Pierre Adet ... I don't understand.\"\n\n\"'Tis but little meseems that you do understand, M. le duc,\" sneered the\nother. \"But turn your memory back, I pray you, to the night four years\nago when a few hot-headed peasant lads planned to give you a fright in\nyour castle of Kernogan ... the plan failed and Pierre Adet, the leader\nof that unfortunate band, managed to fly the country, whilst you, like a\ncrazed and blind tyrant, administered punishment right and left for the\nfright which you had had. Just think of it! those boors! those louts!\nthat swinish herd of human cattle had dared to raise a cry of revolt\nagainst you! To death with them all! to death! Where is Pierre Adet, the\nleader of those hogs? to him an exemplary punishment must be meted! a\ndeterrent against any other attempt at revolt. Well, M. le duc, do you\nremember what happened then? Pierre Adet, severely injured in the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e,\nhad managed to crawl away into safety. While he lay betwixt life and\ndeath, first in the presbytery of Vertou, then in various ditches on his\nway to Paris, he knew nothing of what happened at Nantes. When he\nreturned to consciousness and to active life he heard that his father,\nJean Adet the miller, who was innocent of any share in the revolt, had\nbeen hanged by order of M. le duc de Kernogan.\"\n\nHe paused awhile and a curious laugh--half-convulsive and not unmixed\nwith sobs--shook his broad shoulders. Neither the duc nor Yvonne made\nany comment on what they heard: the duc felt like a fly caught in a\ndeath-dealing web. He was dazed with the horror of his position, dazed\nabove all with the rush of bitter remorse which had surged up in his\nheart and mind, when he realised that it was his own folly, his\nobstinacy--aye! and his heartlessness which had brought this awful fate\nupon his daughter. And Yvonne felt that whatever she might endure of\nmisery and hopelessness was nothing in comparison with what her father\nmust feel with the addition of bitter self-reproach.\n\n\"Are you beginning to understand the position better now, M. le duc?\"\nqueried Martin-Roget after awhile.\n\nThe duc sank back nerveless upon the pile of cordages close by. Yvonne\nwas leaning with her back against the taffrail, her two arms\noutstretched, the north-west wind blowing her soft brown hair about her\nface whilst her eyes sought through the gloom to read the lines of\ncruelty and hatred which must be distorting Martin-Roget's face now.\n\n\"And,\" she said quietly after awhile, \"you have waited all these years,\nMonsieur, nursing thoughts of revenge and of hate against us. Ah!\nbelieve me,\" she added earnestly, \"though God knows my heart is full of\nmisery at this moment, and though I know that at your bidding death will\nso soon claim me and my father as his own, yet would I not change my\nwretchedness for yours.\"\n\n\"And I, citizeness,\" he said roughly, addressing her for the first time\nin the manner prescribed by the revolutionary government, \"would not\nchange places with any king or other tyrant on earth. Yes,\" he added as\nhe came a step or two closer to her, \"I have waited all these years. For\nfour years I have thought and striven and planned, planned to be even\nwith your father and with you one day. You had fled the country--like\ncowards, bah!--ready to lend your arms to the foreigner against your own\ncountry in order to re-establish a tyrant upon the throne whom the whole\nof the people of France loathed and detested. You had fled, but soon I\nlearned whither you had gone. Then I set to work to gain access to\nyou.... I learned English.... I too went to England ... under an assumed\nname ... with the necessary introductions so as to gain a footing in the\ncircles in which you moved. I won your father's condescension--almost\nhis friendship!... The rich banker from Brest should be fleeced in order\nto provide funds for the armies that were to devastate France--and the\nrich banker of Brest refused to be fleeced unless he was lured by the\npromise of Mlle. de Kernogan's hand in marriage.\"\n\n\"You need not, Monsieur,\" rejoined Yvonne coldly, while Martin-Roget\npaused in order to draw breath, \"you need not, believe me, take the\ntrouble to recount all the machinations which you carried through in\norder to gain your ends. Enough that my father was so foolish as to\ntrust you, and that we are now completely in your power, but....\"\n\n\"There is no 'but,'\" he broke in gruffly, \"you are in my power and will\nbe made to learn the law of the talion which demands an eye for an eye,\na life for a life: that is the law which the people are applying to that\nherd of aristos who were arrogant tyrants once and are shrinking,\ncowering slaves now. Oh! you were very proud that night, Mademoiselle\nYvonne de Kernogan, when a few peasant lads told you some home truths\nwhile you sat disdainful and callous in your carriage, but there is one\nfact that you can never efface from your memory, strive how you may, and\nthat is that for a few minutes I held you in my arms and that I kissed\nyou, my fine lady, aye! kissed you like I would any pert kitchen wench,\neven I, Pierre Adet, the miller's son.\"\n\nHe drew nearer and nearer to her as he spoke; she, leaning against the\ntaffrail, could not retreat any further from him. He laughed.\n\n\"If you fall over into the water, I shall not complain,\" he said, \"it\nwill save our proconsul the trouble, and the guillotine some work. But\nyou need not fear. I am not trying to kiss you again. You are nothing to\nme, you and your father, less than nothing. Your death in misery and\nwretchedness is all I want, whether you find a dishonoured grave in the\nLoire or by suicide I care less than nothing. But let me tell you this,\"\nhe added, and his voice came now like a hissing sound through his set\nteeth, \"that there is no intention on my part to make glorious martyrs\nof you both. I dare say you have heard some pretty stories over in\nEngland of aristos climbing the steps of the guillotine with an ecstatic\nlook of martyrdom upon their face: and tales of the tumbrils of Paris\nladen with men and women going to their death and shouting \"God save the\nKing\" all the way. That is not the sort of paltry revenge which would\nsatisfy me. My father was hanged by yours as a malefactor--hanged, I\nsay, like a common thief! he, a man who had never wronged a single soul\nin the whole course of his life, who had been an example of fine living,\nof hard work, of noble courage through many adversities. My mother was\nleft a widow--not the honoured widow of an honourable man--but a pariah,\nthe relict of a malefactor who had died of the hangman's rope--my sister\nwas left an orphan--dishonoured--without hope of gaining the love of a\nrespectable man. All that I and my family owe to ci-devant M. le duc de\nKernogan, and therefore I tell you, that both he and his\ndaughter shall not die like martyrs but like malefactors\ntoo--shamed--dishonoured--loathed and execrated even by their own\nkindred! Take note of that, M. le duc de Kernogan! You have sown shame,\nshame shall you reap! and the name of which you are so proud will be\ndragged in the mire until it has become a by-word in the land for all\nthat is despicable and base.\"\n\nPerhaps at no time of his life had Martin-Roget, erstwhile Pierre Adet,\nspoken with such an intensity of passion, even though he was at all\ntimes turbulent and a ready prey to his own emotions. But all that he\nhad kept hidden in the inmost recesses of his heart, ever since as a\nyoung stripling he had chafed at the social conditions of his country,\nnow welled forth in that wild harangue. For the first time in his life\nhe felt that he was really master of those who had once despised and\noppressed him. He held them and was the arbiter of their fate. The\nsense of possession and of power had gone to his head like wine: he was\nintoxicated with his own feeling of triumphant revenge, and this\nimpassioned rhetoric flowed from his mouth like the insentient babble of\na drunken man.\n\nThe duc de Kernogan, sitting on the coil of cordages with his elbows on\nhis knees and his head buried in his hands, had no thought of breaking\nin on the other man's ravings. The bitterness of remorse paralysed his\nthinking faculties. Martin-Roget's savage words struck upon his senses\nlike blows from a sledge-hammer. He knew that nothing but his own folly\nwas the cause of Yvonne's and his own misfortune. Yvonne had been safe\nfrom all evil fortune under the protection of her fine young English\nhusband; he--the father who should have been her chief protector--had\ndragged her by brute force away from that husband's care and had landed\nher ... where?... A shudder like acute ague went through the unfortunate\nman's whole body as he thought of the future.\n\nNor did Yvonne Dewhurst attempt to make reply to her enemy's delirious\ntalk. She would not give him even the paltry satisfaction of feeling\nthat he had stung her into a retort. She did not fear him--she hated him\ntoo much for that--but like her father she had no illusions as to his\npower over them both. While he stormed and raved she kept her eyes\nsteadily fixed upon him. She could only just barely distinguish him in\nthe gloom, and he no doubt failed to see the expression of lofty\nindifference wherewith she contrived to regard him: but he _felt_ her\ncontempt, and but for the presence of the sailors on the deck he\nprobably would have struck her.\n\nAs it was when, from sheer lack of breath, he had to pause, he gave one\nlast look of hate on the huddled figure of the duc, and the proud,\nupstanding one of Yvonne, then with a laugh which sounded like that of a\nfiend--so cruel, so callous was it, he turned on his heel, and as he\nstrode away towards the bow his tall figure was soon absorbed in the\nsurrounding gloom.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe duc de Kernogan and his daughter saw little or nothing of\nMartin-Roget after that. For awhile longer they caught sight of him from\ntime to time as he walked up and down the deck with ceaseless\nrestlessness and in the company of another man, who was much shorter and\nslimmer than himself and whom they had not noticed hitherto.\nMartin-Roget talked most of the time in a loud and excited voice, the\nother appearing to listen to him with a certain air of deference.\nWhether the conversation between these two was actually intended for the\nears of the two unfortunates, or whether it was merely chance which\nbrought certain phrases to their ears when the two men passed closely\nby, it were impossible to say. Certain it is that from such chance\nphrases they gathered that the barque would not put into Nantes, as the\nnavigation of the Loire was suspended for the nonce by order of\nProconsul Carrier. He had need of the river for his awesome and\nnefarious deeds. Yvonne's ears were regaled with tales--told with loud\nostentation--of the terrible _noyades_, the wholesale drowning of men,\nwomen and children, malefactors and traitors, so as to ease the burden\nof the guillotine.\n\nAfter three bells it got so bitterly cold that Yvonne, fearing that her\nfather would become seriously ill, suggested their going down to their\nstuffy cabins together. After all, even the foul and shut-up atmosphere\nof these close, airless cupboards was preferable to the propinquity of\nthose two human fiends up on deck and the tales of horror and brutality\nwhich they loved to tell.\n\nAnd for two hours after that, father and daughter sat in the narrow\ncell-like place, locked in each other's arms. She had everything to\nforgive, and he everything to atone for: but Yvonne suffered so acutely,\nher misery was so great that she found it in her heart to pity the\nfather whose misery must have been even greater than hers. The supreme\nsolace of bestowing love and forgiveness and of easing the racking\nparoxysms of remorse which brought the unfortunate man to the verge of\ndementia, warmed her heart towards him and brought surcease to her own\nsorrow.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO: NANTES, DECEMBER, 1793\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE TIGER'S LAIR\n\n\nI\n\nNantes is in the grip of the tiger.\n\nRepresentative Carrier--with powers as of a proconsul--has been sent\ndown to stamp out the lingering remnants of the counter-revolution. La\nVend\u00c3\u00a9e is temporarily subdued; the army of the royalists driven back\nacross the Loire; but traitors still abound--this the National\nConvention in Paris hath decreed--there are traitors everywhere. They\nwere not _all_ massacred at Cholet and Savenay. Disbanded, yes! but not\nexterminated, and wolves must not be allowed to run loose, lest they\nband again, and try to devour the flocks.\n\nTherefore extermination is the order of the day. Every traitor or\nwould-be traitor--every son and daughter and father and mother of\ntraitors must be destroyed ere they do more mischief. And\nCarrier--Carrier the coward who turned tail and bolted at Cholet--is\nsent to Nantes to carry on the work of destruction. Wolves and wolflings\nall! Let none survive. Give them fair trial, of course. As traitors they\nhave deserved death--have they not taken up arms against the Republic\nand against the Will and the Reign of the People? But let a court of\njustice sit in Nantes town; let the whole nation know how traitors are\ndealt with: let the nation see that her rulers are both wise and just.\nLet wolves and wolflings be brought up for trial, and set up the\nguillotine on Place du Bouffay with four executioners appointed to do\nher work. There would be too much work for two, or even three. Let there\nbe four--and let the work of extermination be complete.\n\nAnd Carrier--with powers as of a proconsul--arrives in Nantes town and\nsets to work to organise his household. Civil and military--with pomp\nand circumstance--for the son of a small farmer, destined originally for\nthe Church and for obscurity is now virtual autocrat in one of the great\ncities of France. He has power of life and death over thousands of\ncitizens--under the direction of justice, of course! So now he has\ncitizens of the bedchamber, and citizens of the household, he has a\nguard of honour and a company of citizens of the guard. And above all he\nhas a crowd of spies around him--servants of the Committee of Public\nSafety so they are called--they style themselves \"La Compagnie Marat\" in\nhonour of the great patriot who was foully murdered by a female\nwolfling.\n\nSo la Compagnie Marat is formed--they wear red bonnets on their\nheads--no stockings on their feet--short breeches to display their bare\nshins: their captain, Fleury, has access at all times to the person of\nthe proconsul, to make report on the raids which his company effect at\nall hours of the day or night. Their powers are supreme too. In and out\nof houses--however private--up and down the streets--through shops,\ntaverns and warehouses, along the quays and the yards--everywhere they\ngo. Everywhere they have the right to go! to ferret and to spy, to\nlisten, to search, to interrogate--the red-capped Company is paid for\nwhat it can find. Piece-work, what? Work for the guillotine!\n\nAnd they it is who keep the guillotine busy. Too busy in fact. And the\ncourt of justice sitting in the H\u00c3\u00b4tel du D\u00c3\u00a9partement is overworked too.\nCarrier gets impatient. Why waste the time of patriots by so much\nparaphernalia of justice? Wolves and wolflings can be exterminated so\nmuch more quickly, more easily than that. It only needs a stroke of\ngenius, one stroke, and Carrier has it.\n\nHe invents the _Noyades_!\n\nThe Drownages we may call them!\n\nThey are so simple! An old flat-bottomed barge. The work of two or three\nship's carpenters! Portholes below the water-line and made to open at a\ngiven moment. All so very, very simple. Then a journey downstream as far\nas Belle Isle or la Mar\u00c3\u00a9chale, and \"sentence of deportation\" executed\nwithout any trouble on a whole crowd of traitors--\"vertical deportation\"\nCarrier calls it facetiously and is mightily proud of his invention and\nof his witticism too.\n\nThe first attempt was highly successful. Ninety priests, and not one\nescaped. Think of the work it would have entailed on the guillotine--and\non the friends of Carrier who sit in justice in the H\u00c3\u00b4tel du\nD\u00c3\u00a9partement! Ninety heads! Bah! That old flat-bottomed barge is the most\nwonderful labour-saving machine.\n\nAfter that the \"Drownages\" become the order of the day. The red-capped\nCompany recruits victims for the hecatomb, and over Nantes Town there\nhangs a pall of unspeakable horror. The prisons are not vast enough to\nhold all the victims, so the huge entrep\u00c3\u00b4t, the bonded warehouse on the\nquay, is converted: instead of chests of coffee it is now encumbered\nwith human freight: into it pell-mell are thrown all those who are\ndestined to assuage Carrier's passion for killing: ten thousand of them:\nmen, women, and young children, counter-revolutionists, innocent\ntradesmen, thieves, aristocrats, criminals and women of evil fame--they\nare herded together like cattle, without straw whereon to lie, without\nwater, without fire, with barely food enough to keep up the last\nattenuated thread of a miserable existence.\n\nAnd when the warehouse gets over full, to the Loire with them!--a\nhundred or two at a time! Pestilence, dysentery decimates their numbers.\nUnder pretence of hygienic requirements two hundred are flung into the\nriver on the 14th day of December. Two hundred--many of them\nwomen--crowds of children and a batch of parish priests.\n\nSome there are among Carrier's colleagues--those up in Paris--who\nprotest! Such wholesale butchery will not redound to the credit of any\nrevolutionary government--it even savours of treachery--it is\nunpatriotic! There are the emissaries of the National Convention,\ndeputed from Paris to supervise and control--they protest as much as\nthey dare--but such men are swept off their feet by the torrent of\nCarrier's gluttony for blood. Carrier's mission is to \"purge the\npolitical body of every evil that infests it.\" Vague and yet precise! He\nreckons that he has full powers and thinks he can flaunt those powers in\nthe face of those sent to control him. He does it too for three whole\nmonths ere he in his turn meets his doom. But for the moment he is\nomnipotent. He has to make report every week to the Committee of Public\nSafety, and he sends brief, garbled versions of his doings. \"He is\npacifying La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e! he is stamping out the remnants of the rebellion!\nhe is purging the political body of every evil that infests it.\" Anon he\nsucceeds in getting the emissaries of the National Convention recalled.\nHe is impatient of control. \"They are weak, pusillanimous, unpatriotic!\nHe must have freedom to act for the best.\"\n\nAfter that he remains virtual dictator, with none but obsequious,\nterrified myrmidons around him: these are too weak to oppose him in any\nway. And the municipality dare not protest either--nor the district\ncouncil--nor the departmental. They are merely sheep who watch others of\ntheir flock being sent to the slaughter.\n\nAfter that from within his lair the man tiger decides that it is a pity\nto waste good barges on the cattle: \"Fling them out!\" he cries. \"Fling\nthem out! Tie two and two together. Man and woman! criminal and aristo!\nthe thief with the ci-devant duke's daughter! the ci-devant marquis with\nthe slut from the streets! Fling them all out together into the Loire\nand pour a hail of grape shot above them until the last struggler has\ndisappeared! \"Equality!\" he cries, \"Equality for all! Fraternity! Unity\nin death!\"\n\nHis friends call this new invention of his: \"Marriage R\u00c3\u00a9publicain!\" and\nhe is pleased with the _mot_.\n\nAnd Republican marriages become the order of the day.\n\n\nII\n\nNantes itself now is akin to a desert--a desert wherein the air is\nfilled with weird sounds of cries and of moans, of furtive footsteps\nscurrying away into dark and secluded byways, of musketry and confused\nnoises, of sorrow and of lamentations.\n\nNantes is a city of the dead--a city of sleepers. Only Carrier is\nawake--thinking and devising and planning shorter ways and swifter, for\nthe extermination of traitors.\n\nIn the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Villestreux the tiger has built his lair: at the apex\nof the island of Feydeau, with the windows of the hotel facing straight\ndown the Loire. From here there is a magnificent view downstream upon\nthe quays which are now deserted and upon the once prosperous port of\nNantes.\n\nThe staircase of the hotel which leads up to the apartments of the\nproconsul is crowded every day and all day with suppliants and with\npetitioners, with the citizens of the household and the members of the\nCompagnie Marat.\n\nBut no one has access to the person of the dictator. He stands aloof,\napart, hidden from the eyes of the world, a mysterious personality whose\nword sends hundreds to their death, whose arbitrary will has reduced a\nonce flourishing city to abject poverty and squalor. No tyrant has ever\nsurrounded himself with a greater paraphernalia of pomp and\ncircumstance--no aristo has ever dwelt in greater luxury: the spoils of\nchurches and chateaux fill the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Villestreux from attic to\ncellar, gold and silver plate adorn his table, priceless works of art\nhang upon his walls, he lolls on couches and chairs which have been the\nresting-place of kings. The wholesale spoliation of the entire\ncountry-side has filled the demagogue's abode with all that is most\nsumptuous in the land.\n\nAnd he himself is far more inaccessible than was _le Roi Soleil_ in the\ndays of his most towering arrogance, than were the Popes in the glorious\ndays of medi\u00c3\u00a6val Rome. Jean Baptiste Carrier, the son of a small farmer,\nthe obscure deputy for Cantal in the National Convention, dwells in the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Villestreux as in a stronghold. No one is allowed near him\nsave a few--a very few--intimates: his valet, two or three women, Fleury\nthe commander of the Marats, and that strange and abominable youngster,\nJacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt, about whom the chroniclers of that tragic epoch can\ntell us so little--a cynical young braggart, said to be a cousin of\nRobespierre and the son of a midwife of Nantes, beardless, handsome and\nvicious: the only human being--so we are told--who had any influence\nover the sinister proconsul: mere hanger-on of Carrier or spy of the\nNational Convention, no one can say--a malignant personality which has\nremained an enigma and a mystery to this hour.\n\nNone but these few are ever allowed now inside the inner sanctuary\nwherein dwells and schemes the dictator. Even Lamberty, Fouquet and the\nothers of the staff are kept at arm's length. Martin-Roget, Chauvelin\nand other strangers are only allowed as far as the ante-room. The door\nof the inner chamber is left open and they hear the proconsul's voice\nand see his silhouette pass and repass in front of them, but that is\nall.\n\nFear of assassination--the inevitable destiny of the tyrant--haunts the\nman-tiger even within the fastnesses of his lair. Day and night a\ncarriage with four horses stands in readiness on La Petite Hollande, the\ngreat, open, tree-bordered Place at the extreme end of the Isle Feydeau\nand on which give the windows of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Villestreux. Day and\nnight the carriage is ready--with coachman on the box and postillion in\nthe saddle, who are relieved every two hours lest they get sleepy or\nslack--with luggage in the boot and provisions always kept fresh inside\nthe coach; everything always ready lest something--a warning from a\nfriend or a threat from an enemy, or merely a sudden access of\nunreasoning terror, the haunting memory of a bloody act--should decide\nthe tyrant at a moment's notice to fly from the scenes of his\nbrutalities.\n\n\nIII\n\nCarrier in the small room which he has fitted up for himself as a\nsumptuous boudoir, paces up and down just like a wild beast in its cage:\nand he rubs his large bony hands together with the excitement engendered\nby his own cruelties, by the success of this wholesale butchery which he\nhas invented and carried through.\n\nThere never was an uglier man than Carrier, with that long hatchet-face\nof his, those abnormally high cheekbones, that stiff, lanky hair, that\ndrooping, flaccid mouth and protruding underlip. Nature seemed to have\nset herself the task of making the face a true mirror of the soul--the\ndark and hideous soul on which of a surety Satan had already set his\nstamp. But he is dressed with scrupulous care--not to say elegance--and\nwith a display of jewelry the provenance of which is as unjustifiable as\nthat of the works of art which fill his private sanctum in every nook\nand cranny.\n\nIn front of the tall window, heavy curtains of crimson damask are drawn\nclosely together, in order to shut out the light of day: the room is in\nall but total darkness: for that is the proconsul's latest caprice: that\nno one shall see him save in semi-obscurity.\n\nCaptain Fleury has stumbled into the room, swearing lustily as he barks\nhis shins against the angle of a priceless Louis XV bureau. He has to\nmake report on the work done by the Compagnie Marat. Fifty-three priests\nfrom the department of Anjou who have refused to take the new oath of\nobedience to the government of the Republic. The red-capped Company who\ntracked them down and arrested them, vow that all these _calotins_ have\nprecious objects--money, jewelry, gold plate--concealed about their\npersons. What is to be done about these things? Are the _calotins_ to be\nallowed to keep them or to dispose of them for their own profit?\n\nCarrier is highly delighted. What a haul!\n\n\"Confiscate everything,\" he cries, \"then ship the whole crowd of that\npestilential rabble, and don't let me hear another word about them.\"\n\nFleury goes. And that same night fifty-three priests are \"shipped\" in\naccordance with the orders of the proconsul, and Carrier, still rubbing\nhis large bony hands contentedly together, exclaims with glee:\n\n\"What a torrent, eh! What a torrent! What a revolution!\"\n\nAnd he sends a letter to Robespierre. And to the Committee of Public\nSafety he makes report:\n\n\"Public spirit in Nantes,\" he writes, \"is magnificent: it has risen to\nthe most sublime heights of revolutionary ideals.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nAfter the departure of Fleury, Carrier suddenly turned to a slender\nyouth, who was standing close by the window, gazing out through the\nfolds of the curtain on the fine vista of the Loire and the quays which\nstretched out before him.\n\n\"Introduce citizen Martin-Roget into the ante-room now, Lalou\u00c3\u00abt,\" he\nsaid loftily. \"I will hear what he has to say, and citizen Chauvelin may\npresent himself at the same time.\"\n\nYoung Lalou\u00c3\u00abt lolled across the room, smothering a yawn.\n\n\"Why should you trouble about all that rabble?\" he said roughly, \"it is\nnearly dinner-time and you know that the chef hates the soup to be kept\nwaiting.\"\n\n\"I shall not trouble about them very long,\" replied Carrier, who had\njust started picking his teeth with a tiny gold tool. \"Open the door,\nboy, and let the two men come.\"\n\nLalou\u00c3\u00abt did as he was told. The door through which he passed he left\nwide open, he then crossed the ante-room to a further door, threw it\nopen and called in a loud voice:\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin! Citizen Martin-Roget!\"\n\nFor all the world like the ceremonious audiences at Versailles in the\ndays of the great Louis.\n\nThere was sound of eager whisperings, of shuffling of feet, of chairs\ndragged across the polished floor. Young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt had already and quite\nunconcernedly turned his back on the two men who, at his call, had\nentered the room.\n\nTwo chairs were placed in front of the door which led to the private\nsanctuary--still wrapped in religious obscurity--where Carrier sat\nenthroned. The youth curtly pointed to the two chairs, then went back to\nthe inner room. The two men advanced. The full light of midday fell upon\nthem from the tall window on their right--the pale, grey, colourless\nlight of December. They bowed slightly in the direction of the audience\nchamber where the vague silhouette of the proconsul was alone visible.\n\nThe whole thing was a farce. Martin-Roget held his lips tightly closed\ntogether lest a curse or a sneer escaped them. Chauvelin's face was\nimpenetrable--but it is worthy of note that just one year later when the\nhalf-demented tyrant was in his turn brought before the bar of the\nConvention and sentenced to the guillotine, it was citizen Chauvelin's\ntestimony which weighed most heavily against him.\n\nThere was silence for a time: Martin-Roget and Chauvelin were waiting\nfor the dictator's word. He sat at his desk with the scanty light, which\nfiltrated between the curtains, immediately behind him, his ungainly\nform with the high shoulders and mop-like, shaggy hair half swallowed up\nby the surrounding gloom. He was deliberately keeping the other two men\nwaiting and busied himself with turning over desultorily the papers and\nwriting tools upon his desk, in the intervals of picking at his teeth\nand muttering to himself all the time as was his wont. Young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt had\nresumed his post beside the curtained window and he was giving sundry\nsigns of his growing impatience.\n\nAt last Carrier spoke:\n\n\"And now, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he said in tones of that lofty\ncondescension which he loved to affect, \"I am prepared to hear what you\nhave to tell me with regard to the cattle which you brought into our\ncity the other day. Where are the aristos now? and why have they not\nbeen handed over to commandant Fleury?\"\n\n\"The girl,\" replied Martin-Roget, who had much ado to keep his vehement\ntemper in check, and who chose for the moment to ignore the second of\nCarrier's peremptory queries, \"the girl is in lodgings in the Carrefour\nde la Poissonnerie. The house is kept by my sister, whose lover was\nhanged four years ago by the ci-devant duc de Kernogan for trapping two\npigeons. A dozen or so lads from our old village--men who worked with my\nfather and others who were my friends--lodge in my sister's house. They\nkeep a watchful eye over the wench for the sake of the past, for my sake\nand for the sake of my sister Louise. The ci-devant Kernogan woman is\nwell-guarded. I am satisfied as to that.\"\n\n\"And where is the ci-devant duc?\"\n\n\"In the house next door--a tavern at the sign of the Rat Mort--a place\nwhich is none too reputable, but the landlord--Lemoine--is a good\npatriot and he is keeping a close eye on the aristo for me.\"\n\n\"And now will you tell me, citizen,\" rejoined Carrier with that unctuous\nsuavity which always veiled a threat, \"will you tell me how it comes\nthat you are keeping a couple of traitors alive all this while at the\ncountry's expense?\"\n\n\"At mine,\" broke in Martin-Roget curtly.\n\n\"At the country's expense,\" reiterated the proconsul inflexibly. \"Bread\nis scarce in Nantes. What traitors eat is stolen from good patriots. If\nyou can afford to fill two mouths at your expense, I can supply you with\nsome that have never done aught but proclaim their adherence to the\nRepublic. You have had those two aristos inside the city nearly a week\nand----\"\n\n\"Only three days,\" interposed Martin-Roget, \"and you must have patience\nwith me, citizen Carrier. Remember I have done well by you, by bringing\nsuch high game to your bag----\"\n\n\"Your high game will be no use to me,\" retorted the other with a harsh\nlaugh, \"if I am not to have the cooking of it. You have talked of\ndisgrace for the rabble and of your own desire for vengeance over them,\nbut----\"\n\n\"Wait, citizen,\" broke in Martin-Roget firmly, \"let us understand one\nanother. Before I embarked on this business you gave me your promise\nthat no one--not even you--would interfere between me and my booty.\"\n\n\"And no one has done so hitherto to my knowledge, citizen,\" rejoined\nCarrier blandly. \"The Kernogan rabble has been yours to do with what you\nlike--er--so far,\" he added significantly. \"I said that I would not\ninterfere and I have not done so up to now, even though the\npestilential crowd stinks in the nostrils of every good patriot in\nNantes. But I don't deny that it was a bargain that you should have a\nfree hand with them ... for a time, and Jean Baptiste Carrier has never\nyet gone back on a given word.\"\n\nMartin-Roget made no comment on this peroration. He shrugged his broad\nshoulders and suddenly fell to contemplating the distant landscape. He\nhad turned his head away in order to hide the sneer which curled his\nlips at the recollection of that \"bargain\" struck with the imperious\nproconsul. It was a matter of five thousand francs which had passed from\none pocket to the other and had bound Carrier down to a definite\npromise.\n\nAfter a brief while Carrier resumed: \"At the same time,\" he said, \"my\npromise was conditional, remember. I want that cattle out of Nantes--I\nwant the bread they eat--I want the room they occupy. I can't allow you\nto play fast and loose with them indefinitely--a week is quite long\nenough----\"\n\n\"Three days,\" corrected Martin-Roget once more.\n\n\"Well! three days or eight,\" rejoined the other roughly. \"Too long in\nany case. I must be rid of them out of this city or I shall have all the\nspies of the Convention about mine ears. I am beset with spies, citizen\nMartin-Roget, yes, even I--Jean Baptiste Carrier--the most selfless the\nmost devoted patriot the Republic has ever known! Mine enemies up in\nParis send spies to dog my footsteps, to watch mine every action. They\nare ready to pounce upon me at the slightest slip, to denounce me, to\ndrag me to their bar--they have already whetted the knife of the\nguillotine which is to lay low the head of the finest patriot in\nFrance----\"\n\n\"Hold on! hold on, Jean Baptiste my friend,\" here broke in young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt\nwith a sneer, \"we don't want protestations of your patriotism just now.\nIt is nearly dinner time.\"\n\nCarrier had been carried away by his own eloquence. At Lalou\u00c3\u00abt's mocking\nwords he pulled himself together: murmured: \"You young viper!\" in tones\nof tigerish affection, and then turned back to Martin-Roget and resumed\nmore calmly:\n\n\"They'll be saying that I harbour aristos in Nantes if I keep that\nKernogan rabble here any longer. So I must be rid of them, citizen\nMartin-Roget ... say within the next four-and-twenty hours....\" He\npaused for a moment or two, then added drily: \"That is my last word, and\nyou must see to it. What is it you do want to do with them enfin?\"\n\n\"I want their death,\" replied Martin-Roget with a curse, and he brought\nhis heavy fist crashing down upon the arm of his chair, \"but not a\nmartyr's death, understand? I don't want the pathetic figure of Yvonne\nKernogan and her father to remain as a picture of patient resignation in\nthe hearts and minds of every other aristo in the land. I don't want it\nto excite pity or admiration. Death is nothing for such as they! they\nglory in it! they are proud to die. The guillotine is their final\ntriumph! What I want for them is shame ... degradation ... a sensational\ntrial that will cover them with dishonour.... I want their name dragged\nin the mire--themselves an object of derision or of loathing. I want\narticles in the _Moniteur_ giving account of the trial of the ci-devant\nduc de Kernogan and his daughter for something that is ignominious and\nbase. I want shame and mud slung at them--noise and beating of drums to\nproclaim their dishonour. Noise! noise! that will reach every corner of\nthe land, aye that will reach Coblentz and Germany and England. It is\nthat which they would resent--the shame of it--the disgrace to their\nname!\"\n\n\"Tshaw!\" exclaimed Carrier. \"Why don't you marry the wench, citizen\nMartin-Roget? That would be disgrace enough for her, I'll warrant,\" he\nadded with a loud laugh, enchanted at his witticism.\n\n\"I would to-morrow,\" replied the other, who chose to ignore the coarse\ninsult, \"if she would consent. That is why I have kept her at my\nsister's house these three days.\"\n\n\"Bah! you have no need of a traitor's consent. My consent is\nsufficient.... I'll give it if you like. The laws of the Republic\npermit, nay desire every good patriot to ally himself with an aristo, if\nhe have a mind. And the Kernogan wench face to face with the\nguillotine--or worse--would surely prefer your embraces, citizen, what?\"\n\nA deep frown settled between Martin-Roget's glowering eyes, and gave his\nface a sinister expression.\n\n\"I wonder ...\" he muttered between his teeth.\n\n\"Then cease wondering, citizen,\" retorted Carrier cynically, \"and try\nour Republican marriage on your Kernogans ... thief linked to aristo,\ncut-throat to a proud wench ... and then the Loire! Shame? Dishonour?\nFal lal I say! Death, swift and sure and unerring. Nothing better has\nyet been invented for traitors.\"\n\nMartin-Roget shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You have never known,\" he said quietly, \"what it is to hate.\"\n\nCarrier uttered an exclamation of impatience.\n\n\"Bah!\" he said, \"that is all talk and nonsense. Theories, what? Citizen\nChauvelin is a living example of the futility of all that rubbish. He\ntoo has an enemy it seems whom he hates more thoroughly than any good\npatriot has ever hated the enemies of the Republic. And hath this\ndeadly hatred availed him, forsooth? He too wanted the disgrace and\ndishonour of that confounded Englishman whom I would simply have tossed\ninto the Loire long ago, without further process. What is the result?\nThe Englishman is over in England, safe and sound, making long noses at\ncitizen Chauvelin, who has much ado to keep his own head out of the\nguillotine.\"\n\nMartin-Roget once more was silent: a look of sullen obstinacy had\nsettled upon his face.\n\n\"You may be right, citizen Carrier,\" he muttered after awhile.\n\n\"I am always right,\" broke in Carrier curtly.\n\n\"Exactly ... but I have your promise.\"\n\n\"And I'll keep it, as I have said, for another four and twenty hours.\nCurse you for a mulish fool,\" added the proconsul with a snarl, \"what in\nthe d----l's name do you want to do? You have talked a vast deal of\nrubbish but you have told me nothing of your plans. Have you any ...\nthat are worthy of my attention?\"\n\n\nV\n\nMartin-Roget rose from his seat and began pacing up and down the narrow\nroom. His nerves were obviously on edge. It was difficult for any\nman--let alone one of his temperament and half-tutored disposition--to\nremain calm and deferential in face of the overbearance of this brutal\nJack-in-office. Martin-Roget--himself an upstart--loathed the offensive\nself-assertion of that uneducated and bestial parvenu, who had become\nall-powerful through the sole might of his savagery, and it cost him a\nmighty effort to keep a violent retort from escaping his lips--a retort\nwhich probably would have cost him his head.\n\nChauvelin, on the other hand, appeared perfectly unconcerned. He\npossessed the art of outward placidity to a masterly degree. Throughout\nall this while he had taken no part in the discussion. He sat silent and\nall but motionless, facing the darkened room in front of him, as if he\nhad done nothing else in all his life but interview great dictators who\nchose to keep their sacred persons in the dark. Only from time to time\ndid his slender fingers drum a tattoo on the arm of his chair.\n\nCarrier had resumed his interesting occupation of picking his teeth: his\nlong, thin legs were stretched out before him; from beneath his flaccid\nlids he shot swift glances upwards, whenever Martin-Roget in his\nrestless pacing crossed and recrossed in front of the open door. But\nanon, when the latter came to a halt under the lintel and with his foot\nalmost across the threshold, young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt was upon him in an instant,\nbarring the way to the inner sanctum.\n\n\"Keep your distance, citizen,\" he said drily, \"no one is allowed to\nenter here.\"\n\nInstinctively Martin-Roget had drawn back--suddenly awed despite himself\nby the air of mystery which hung over that darkened room, and by the dim\nsilhouette of the sinister tyrant who at his approach had with equal\nsuddenness cowered in his lair, drawing his limbs together and thrusting\nhis head forward, low down over the desk, like a leopard crouching for a\nspring. But this spell of awe only lasted a few seconds, during which\nMartin-Roget's unsteady gaze encountered the half-mocking, wholly\nsupercilious glance of young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt.\n\nThe next, he had recovered his presence of mind. But this crowning act\nof audacious insolence broke the barrier of his self-restraint. An angry\noath escaped him.\n\n\"Are we,\" he exclaimed roughly, \"back in the days of Capet, the tyrant,\nand of Versailles, that patriots and citizens are treated like menials\nand obtrusive slaves? Pardieu, citizen Carrier, let me tell you\nthis....\"\n\n\"Pardieu, citizen Martin-Roget,\" retorted Carrier with a growl like that\nof a savage dog, \"let _me_ tell _you_ that for less than two pins I'll\nthrow you into the next barge that will float with open portholes down\nthe Loire. Get out of my presence, you swine, ere I call Fleury to throw\nyou out.\"\n\nMartin-Roget at the insult and the threat had become as pale as the\nlinen at his throat: a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead and he\npassed his hand two or three times across his brow like a man dazed with\na sudden and violent blow. His nerves, already overstrained and very\nmuch on edge, gave way completely. He staggered and would have measured\nhis length across the floor, but that his hand encountered the back of\nhis chair and he just contrived to sink into it, sick and faint,\nhorror-struck and pallid.\n\nA low cackle--something like a laugh--broke from Chauvelin's thin lips.\nAs usual he had witnessed the scene quite unmoved.\n\n\"My friend Martin-Roget forgot himself for the moment, citizen Carrier,\"\nhe said suavely, \"already he is ready to make amends.\"\n\nJacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt looked down for a moment with infinite scorn expressed\nin his fine eyes, on the presumptuous creature who had dared to defy the\nomnipotent representative of the People. Then he turned on his heel, but\nhe did not go far this time: he remained standing close beside the\ndoor--the terrier guarding his master.\n\nCarrier laughed loud and long. It was a hideous, strident laugh which\nhad not a tone of merriment in it.\n\n\"Wake up, friend Martin-Roget,\" he said harshly, \"I bear no malice: I am\na good dog when I am treated the right way. But if anyone pulls my tail\nor treads on my paws, why! I snarl and growl of course. If the offence\nis repeated ... I bite ... remember that; and now let us resume our\ndiscourse, though I confess I am getting tired of your Kernogan rabble.\"\n\nWhile the great man spoke, Martin-Roget had succeeded in pulling himself\ntogether. His throat felt parched, his hands hot and moist: he was like\na man who had been stumbling along a road in the dark and been suddenly\npulled up on the edge of a yawning abyss into which he had all but\nfallen. With a few harsh words, with a monstrous insult Carrier had made\nhim feel the gigantic power which could hurl any man from the heights of\nself-assurance and of ambition to the lowest depths of degradation: he\nhad shown him the glint of steel upon the guillotine.\n\nHe had been hit as with a sledge-hammer--the blow hurt terribly, for it\nhad knocked all his self-esteem into nothingness and pulverised his\nself-conceit. It had in one moment turned him into a humble and cringing\nsycophant.\n\n\"I had no mind,\" he began tentatively, \"to give offence. My thoughts\nwere bent on the Kernogans. They are a fine haul for us both, citizen\nCarrier, and I worked hard and long to obtain their confidence over in\nEngland and to induce them to come with me to Nantes.\"\n\n\"No one denies that you have done well,\" retorted Carrier gruffly and\nnot yet wholly pacified. \"If the haul had not been worth having you\nwould have received no help from me.\"\n\n\"I have shown my gratitude for your help, citizen Carrier. I would show\nit again ... more substantially if you desire....\"\n\nHe spoke slowly and quite deferentially but the suggestion was obvious.\nCarrier looked up into his face: the light of measureless cupidity--the\ncupidity of the coarse-grained, enriched peasant--glittered in his pale\neyes. It was by a great effort of will that he succeeded in concealing\nhis eagerness beneath his habitual air of lofty condescension:\n\n\"Eh? What?\" he queried airily.\n\n\"If another five thousand francs is of any use to you....\"\n\n\"You seem passing rich, citizen Martin-Roget,\" sneered Carrier.\n\n\"I have slaved and saved for four years. What I have amassed I will\nsacrifice for the completion of my revenge.\"\n\n\"Well!\" rejoined Carrier with an expressive wave of the hand, \"it\ncertainly is not good for a pure-minded republican to own too much\nwealth. Have we not fought,\" he continued with a grandiloquent gesture,\n\"for equality of fortune as well as of privileges....\"\n\nA sardonic laugh from young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt broke in on the proconsul's eloquent\neffusion.\n\nCarrier swore as was his wont, but after a second or two he began again\nmore quietly:\n\n\"I will accept a further six thousand francs from you, citizen\nMartin-Roget, in the name of the Republic and all her needs. The\nRepublic of France is up in arms against the entire world. She hath need\nof men, of arms, of....\"\n\n\"Oh! cut that,\" interposed young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt roughly.\n\nBut the over-vain, high and mighty despot who was ready to lash out with\nunbridled fury against the slightest show of disrespect on the part of\nany other man, only laughed at the boy's impudence.\n\n\"Curse you, you young viper,\" he said with that rude familiarity which\nhe seemed to reserve for the boy, \"you presume too much on my\nforbearance. These children you know, citizen.... Name of a dog!\" he\nadded roughly, \"we are wasting time! What was I saying ...?\"\n\n\"That you would take six thousand francs,\" replied Martin-Roget curtly,\n\"in return for further help in the matter of the Kernogans.\"\n\n\"Why, yes!\" rejoined Carrier blandly, \"I was forgetting. But I'll show\nyou what a good dog I am. I'll help you with those Kernogans ... but you\nmistook my words, citizen: 'tis ten thousand francs you must pour into\nthe coffers of the Republic, for her servants will have to be placed at\nthe disposal of your private schemes of vengeance.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand francs is a large sum,\" said Martin-Roget. \"Let me hear\nwhat you will do for me for that.\"\n\nHe had regained something of his former complacency. The man who\nbuys--be it goods, consciences or services--is always for the moment\nmaster of the man who sells. Carrier, despite his dictatorial ways, felt\nthis disadvantage, no doubt, for his tone was more bland, his manner\nless curt. Only young Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt stood by--like a snarling\nterrier--still arrogant and still disdainful--the master of the\nsituation--seeing that neither schemes of vengeance nor those of\ncorruption had ruffled his self-assurance. He remained beside the door,\nready to pounce on either of the two intruders if they showed the\nslightest sign of forgetting the majesty of the great proconsul.\n\n\nVI\n\n\"I told you just now, citizen Martin-Roget,\" resumed Carrier after a\nbrief pause, \"and I suppose you knew it already, that I am surrounded\nwith spies.\"\n\n\"Spies, citizen?\" murmured Martin-Roget, somewhat taken aback by this\nsudden irrelevance. \"I didn't know ... I imagine.... Any one in your\nposition....\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" broke in Carrier roughly. \"My position is envied by\nthose who are less competent, less patriotic than I am. Nantes is\nswarming with spies. Mine enemies in Paris are working against me. They\nwant to undermine the confidence which the National Convention reposes\nin her accredited representative.\"\n\n\"Preposterous,\" ejaculated young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt solemnly.\n\n\"Well!\" rejoined Carrier with a savage oath, \"you would have thought\nthat the Convention would be only too thankful to get a strong man at\nthe head of affairs in this hotbed of treason and of rebellion. You\nwould have thought that it was no one's affair to interfere with the\nmanner in which I administer the powers that have been given me. I\ncommand in Nantes, what? Yet some busybodies up in Paris, some fools,\nseem to think that we are going too fast in Nantes. They have become\nweaklings over there since Marat has gone. It seems that they have heard\nrumours of our flat-bottomed barges and of our fine Republican\nmarriages: apparently they disapprove of both. They don't realise that\nwe have to purge an entire city of every kind of rabble--traitors as\nwell as criminals. They don't understand my aspirations, my ideals,\" he\nadded loftily and with a wide, sweeping gesture of his arm, \"which is to\nmake Nantes a model city, to free her from the taint of crime and of\ntreachery, and....\"\n\nAn impatient exclamation from young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt once again broke in on\nCarrier's rhetoric, and Martin-Roget was able to slip in the query which\nhad been hovering on his lips:\n\n\"And is this relevant, citizen Carrier,\" he asked, \"to the subject which\nwe have been discussing?\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Carrier drily, \"as you will see in a moment. Learn\nthen, that it has been my purpose for some time to silence mine enemies\nby sending to the National Convention a tangible reply to all the\naccusations which have been levelled against me. It is my purpose to\nexplain to the Assembly my reasons for mine actions in Nantes, my\nDrownages, my Republican marriages, all the coercive measures which I\nhave been forced to take in order to purge the city from all that is\nundesirable.\"\n\n\"And think you, citizen Carrier,\" queried Martin-Roget without the\nslightest trace of a sneer, \"that up in Paris they will understand your\nexplanations?\"\n\n\"Yes! they will--they must when they realise that everything that I have\ndone has been necessitated by the exigencies of public safety.\"\n\n\"They will be slow to realise that,\" mused the other. \"The National\nConvention to-day is not what the Constitutional Assembly was in '92. It\nhas become soft and sentimental. Many there are who will disapprove of\nyour doings.... Robespierre talks loftily of the dignity of the Republic\n... her impartial justice.... The Girondins....\"\n\nCarrier interposed with a coarse imprecation. He suddenly leaned\nforward, sprawling right across the desk. A shaft of light from between\nthe damask curtains caught the end of his nose and the tip of his\nprotruding chin, distorting his face and making it seem grotesque as\nwell as hideous in the dim light. He appeared excited and inflated with\nvanity. He always gloried in the atrocities which he committed, and\nthough he professed to look with contempt on every one of his\ncolleagues, he was always glad of an opportunity to display his\ninventive powers before them, and to obtain their fulsome eulogy.\n\n\"I know well enough what they talk about in Paris,\" he said, \"but I have\nan answer--a substantial, definite answer for all their rubbish. Dignity\nof the Republic? Bah! Impartial justice? 'Tis force, strength, Spartan\nvigour that we want ... and I'll show them.... Listen to my plan,\ncitizen Martin-Roget, and see how it will work in with yours. My idea is\nto collect together all the most disreputable and notorious evil-doers\nof this city ... there are plenty in the entrep\u00c3\u00b4t at the present moment,\nand there are plenty more still at large in the streets of\nNantes--thieves, malefactors, forgers of State bonds, assassins and\nwomen of evil fame ... and to send them in a batch to Paris to appear\nbefore the Committee of Public Safety, whilst I will send to my\ncolleagues there a letter couched in terms of gentle reproach: 'See!' I\nshall say, 'what I have to contend with in Nantes. See! the moral\npestilence that infests the city. These evil-doers are but a few among\nthe hundreds and thousands of whom I am vainly trying to purge this city\nwhich you have entrusted to my care!' They won't know how to deal with\nthe rabble,\" he continued with his harsh strident laugh. \"They may send\nthem to the guillotine wholesale or deport them to Cayenne, and they\nwill have to give them some semblance of a trial in any case. But they\nwill have to admit that my severe measures are justified, and in future,\nI imagine, they will leave me more severely alone.\"\n\n\"If as you say,\" urged Martin-Roget, \"the National Convention give your\ncrowd a trial, you will have to produce some witnesses.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" retorted Carrier cynically. \"So I will. Have I not said\nthat I will round up all the most noted evil-doers in the town? There\nare plenty of them I assure you. Lately, my Company Marat have not\ngreatly troubled about them. After Savenay there was such a crowd of\nrebels to deal with, there was no room in our prisons for malefactors as\nwell. But we can easily lay our hands on a couple of hundred or so, and\nmembers of the municipality or of the district council, or tradespeople\nof substance in the city will only be too glad to be rid of them, and\nwill testify against those that were actually caught red-handed. Not one\nbut has suffered from the pestilential rabble that has infested the\nstreets at night, and lately I have been pestered with complaints of all\nthese night-birds--men and women and....\"\n\nSuddenly he paused. He had caught Martin-Roget's feverish gaze fixed\nexcitedly upon him. Whereupon he leaned back in his chair, threw his\nhead back and broke into loud and immoderate laughter.\n\n\"By the devil and all his myrmidons, citizen!\" he said, as soon as he\nhad recovered his breath, \"meseems you have tumbled to my meaning as a\npig into a heap of garbage. Is not ten thousand francs far too small a\nsum to pay for such a perfect realisation of all your dreams? We'll send\nthe Kernogan girl and her father to Paris with the herd, what?... I\npromise you that such filth and mud will be thrown on them and on their\nprecious name that no one will care to bear it for centuries to come.\"\n\nMartin-Roget of a truth had much ado to control his own excitement. As\nthe proconsul unfolded his infamous plan, he had at once seen as in a\nvision the realisation of all his hopes. What more awful humiliation,\nwhat more dire disgrace could be devised for proud Kernogan and his\ndaughter than being herded together with the vilest scum that could be\ngathered together among the flotsam and jetsam of the population of a\nseaport town? What more perfect retaliation could there be for the\nignominious death of Jean Adet the miller?\n\nMartin-Roget leaned forward in his chair. The hideous figure of Carrier\nwas no longer hideous to him. He saw in that misshapen, gawky form the\nvery embodiment of the god of vengeance, the wielder of the flail of\nretributive justice which was about to strike the guilty at last.\n\n\"You are right, citizen Carrier,\" he said, and his voice was thick and\nhoarse with excitement. He rested his elbow on his knee and his chin in\nhis hand. He hammered his nails against his teeth. \"That was exactly in\nmy mind while you spoke.\"\n\n\"I am always right,\" retorted Carrier loftily. \"No one knows better than\nI do how to deal with traitors.\"\n\n\"And how is the whole thing to be accomplished? The wench is in my\nsister's house at present ... the father is in the Rat Mort....\"\n\n\"And the Rat Mort is an excellent place.... I know of none better. It is\none of the worst-famed houses in the whole of Nantes ... the\nmeeting-place of all the vagabonds, the thieves and the cut-throats of\nthe city.\"\n\n\"Yes! I know that to my cost. My sister's house is next door to it. At\nnight the street is not safe for decent females to be abroad: and though\nthere is a platoon of Marats on guard at Le Bouffay close by, they do\nnothing to free the neighbourhood of that pest.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" retorted Carrier with cynical indifference, \"they have more\nimportant quarry to net. Rebels and traitors swarm in Nantes, what?\nCommandant Fleury has had no time hitherto to waste on mere cut-throats,\nalthough I had thoughts before now of razing the place to the ground.\nCitizen Lamberty has his lodgings on the other side and he does nothing\nbut complain of the brawls that go on there o' nights. Sure it is that\nwhile a stone of the Rat Mort remains standing all the night-hawks of\nNantes will congregate around it and brew mischief there which is no\ngood to me and no good to the Republic.\"\n\n\"Yes! I know all about the Rat Mort. I found a night's shelter there\nfour years ago when....\"\n\n\"When the ci-devant duc de Kernogan was busy hanging your father--the\nmiller--for a crime which he never committed. Well then, citizen\nMartin-Roget,\" continued Carrier with one of his hideous leers, \"since\nyou know the Rat Mort so well what say you to your fair and stately\nYvonne de Kernogan and her father being captured there in the company of\nthe lowest scum of the population of Nantes?\"\n\n\"You mean ...?\" murmured Martin-Roget, who had become livid with\nexcitement.\n\n\"I mean that my Marats have orders to raid some of the haunts of our\nNantese cut-throats, and that they may as well begin to-night and with\nthe Rat Mort. They will make a descent on the house and a thorough\nperquisition, and every person--man, woman and child--found on the\npremises will be arrested and sent with a batch of malefactors to Paris,\nthere to be tried as felons and criminals and deported to Cayenne where\nthey will, I trust, rot as convicts in that pestilential climate. Think\nyou,\" concluded the odious creature with a sneer, \"that when put face to\nface with the alternative, your Kernogan wench will still refuse to\nbecome the wife of a fine patriot like yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" murmured Martin-Roget. \"I ... I....\"\n\n\"But I do know,\" broke in Carrier roughly, \"that ten thousand francs is\nfar too little to pay for so brilliant a realisation of all one's hopes.\nTen thousand francs? 'Tis an hundred thousand you should give to show\nyour gratitude.\"\n\nMartin-Roget rose and stretched his large, heavy figure to its full\nheight. He was at great pains to conceal the utter contempt which he\nfelt for the abominable wretch before whom he was forced to cringe.\n\n\"You shall have ten thousand francs, citizen Carrier,\" he said slowly;\n\"it is all that I possess in the world now--the last remaining fragment\nof a sum of twenty-five thousand francs which I earned and scraped\ntogether for the past four years. You have had five thousand francs\nalready. And you shall have the other ten. I do not grudge it. If twenty\nyears of my life were any use to you, I would give you that, in exchange\nfor the help you are giving me in what means far more than life to me.\"\n\nThe proconsul laughed and shrugged his shoulders--of a truth he thought\ncitizen Martin-Roget an awful fool.\n\n\"Very well then,\" he said, \"we will call the matter settled. I confess\nthat it amuses me, although remember that I have warned you. With all\nthese aristos, I believe in the potency of my barges rather than in your\nelaborate schemes. Still! it shall never be said that Jean Baptiste\nCarrier has left a friend in the lurch.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for your help, citizen Carrier,\" said Martin-Roget\ncoldly. Then he added slowly, as if reviewing the situation in his own\nmind: \"To-night, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes. To-night. My Marats under the command of citizen Fleury will make\na descent upon the Rat Mort. Those shall be my orders. The place will be\nswept clean of every man, woman and child who is inside. If your two\nKernogans are there ... well!\" he said with a cynical laugh and a shrug\nof his shoulders, \"they can be sent up to Paris with the rest of the\nherd.\"\n\n\"The dinner bell has gone long ago,\" here interposed young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt\ndrily, \"the soup will be stone-cold and the chef red-hot with anger.\"\n\n\"You are right, citizen Lalou\u00c3\u00abt,\" said Carrier as he leaned back in his\nchair once more and stretched out his long legs at his ease. \"We have\nwasted far too much time already over the affairs of a couple of\naristos, who ought to have been at the bottom of the Loire a week ago.\nThe audience is ended,\" he added airily, and he made a gesture of\noverweening condescension, for all the world like the one wherewith the\n_Grand Monarque_ was wont to dismiss his courtiers.\n\nChauvelin rose too and quietly turned to the door. He had not spoken a\nword for the past half-hour, ever since in fact he had put in a\nconciliatory word on behalf of his impetuous colleague. Whether he had\ntaken an active interest in the conversation or not it were impossible\nto say. But now, just as he was ready to go, and young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt prepared\nto close the doors of the audience chamber, something seemed suddenly to\noccur to him and he called somewhat peremptorily to the young man.\n\n\"One moment, citizen,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it now?\" queried the youth insolently, and from his fine eyes\nthere shot a glance of contempt on the meagre figure of the once\npowerful Terrorist.\n\n\"About the Kernogan wench,\" continued Chauvelin. \"She will have to be\nconveyed some time before night to the tavern next door. There may be\nagencies at work on her behalf....\"\n\n\"Agencies?\" broke in the boy gruffly. \"What agencies?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Chauvelin vaguely, \"we all know that aristos have powerful\nfriends these days. It will not be over safe to take the girl across\nafter dark from one house to another ... the alley is badly lighted: the\nwench will not go willingly. She might scream and create a disturbance\nand draw ... er ... those same unknown agencies to her rescue. I think a\nbody of Marats should be told off to convey her to the Rat Mort....\"\n\nYoung Lalou\u00c3\u00abt shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"That's your affair,\" he said curtly. \"Eh, Carrier?\" And he glanced over\nhis shoulder at the proconsul, who at once assented.\n\nMartin-Roget--struck by his colleague's argument--would have interposed,\nbut Carrier broke in with one of his uncontrolled outbursts of fury.\n\n\"Ah \u00c3\u00a7a,\" he exclaimed, \"enough of this now. Citizen Lalou\u00c3\u00abt is right and\nI have done enough for you already. If you want the Kernogan wench to be\nat the Rat Mort, you must see to getting her there yourself. She is next\ndoor, what? I won't have anything to do with it and I won't have my\nMarats implicated in the affair either. Name of a dog! have I not told\nyou that I am beset with spies? It would of a truth be a climax if I was\ndenounced as having dragged aristos to a house of ill-fame and then had\nthem arrested there as malefactors! Now out with you! I have had enough\nof this! If your rabble is at the Rat Mort to-night, they shall be\narrested with all the other cut-throats. That is my last word. The rest\nis your affair. Lalou\u00c3\u00abt! the door!\"\n\nAnd without another word, and without listening to further protests from\nMartin-Roget or Chauvelin, Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt closed the doors of the\naudience chamber in their face.\n\n\nVII\n\nOutside on the landing, Martin-Roget swore a violent, all comprehensive\noath.\n\n\"To think that we are under the heel of that skunk!\" he said.\n\n\"And that in the pursuit of our own ends we have need of his help!\"\nadded Chauvelin with a sigh.\n\n\"If it were not for that.... And even now,\" continued Martin-Roget\nmoodily, \"I doubt what I can do. Yvonne de Kernogan will not follow me\nwillingly either to the Rat Mort or elsewhere, and if I am not to have\nher conveyed by the guard....\"\n\nHe paused and swore again. His companion's silence appeared to irritate\nhim.\n\n\"What do you advise me to do, citizen Chauvelin?\" he asked.\n\n\"For the moment,\" replied Chauvelin imperturbably, \"I should advise you\nto join me in a walk along the quay as far as Le Bouffay. I have work to\nsee to inside the building and the north-westerly wind is sure to be of\ngood counsel.\"\n\nAn angry retort hovered on Martin-Roget's lips, but after a second or\ntwo he succeeded in holding his irascible temper in check. He gave a\nquick sigh of impatience.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said curtly. \"Let us to Le Bouffay by all means. I have\nmuch to think on, and as you say the north-westerly wind may blow away\nthe cobwebs which for the nonce do o'ercloud my brain.\"\n\nAnd the two men wrapped their mantles closely round their shoulders, for\nthe air was keen. Then they descended the staircase of the hotel and\nwent out into the street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nLE BOUFFAY\n\n\nI\n\nIn the centre of the Place the guillotine stood idle--the paint had worn\noff her sides--she looked weatherbeaten and forlorn--stern and\nforbidding still, but in a kind of sullen loneliness, with the ugly\nstains of crimson on her, turned to rust and grime.\n\nThe Place itself was deserted, in strange contrast to the bustle and the\nmovement which characterised it in the days when the death of men, women\nand children was a daily spectacle here for the crowd. Then a constant\nstream of traffic, of carts and of tumbrils, of soldiers and gaffers\nencumbered it in every corner, now a few tumble-down booths set up\nagainst the frontage of the grim edifice--once the stronghold of the\nDukes of Brittany, now little else but a huge prison--a few vendors and\nstill fewer purchasers of the scanty wares displayed under their ragged\nawnings, one or two idlers loafing against the mud-stained walls, one or\ntwo urchins playing in the gutters were the only signs of life.\nMartin-Roget with his colleague Chauvelin turned into the Place from the\nquay--they walked rapidly and kept their mantles closely wrapped under\ntheir chin, for the afternoon had turned bitterly cold. It was then\nclose upon five o'clock--a dark, moonless, starless night had set in\nwith only a suspicion of frost in the damp air; but a blustering\nnorth-westerly wind blowing down the river and tearing round the narrow\nstreets and the open Place, caused passers-by to muffle themselves,\nshivering, yet tighter in their cloaks.\n\nMartin-Roget was talking volubly and excitedly, his tall, broad figure\ntowering above the slender form of his companion. From time to time he\ntossed his mantle aside with an impatient, febrile gesture and then\npaused in the middle of the Place, with one hand on the other man's\nshoulder, marking a point in his discourse or emphasising his argument\nwith short staccato sentences and brief, emphatic words.\nChauvelin--placid and impenetrable as usual--listened much and talked\nlittle. He was ready to stand still or to walk along just as his\ncolleague's mood demanded; in the darkness, and with the collar of a\nlarge mantle pulled tightly up to his ears, it was impossible to guess\nby any sign in his face what was going on in his mind.\n\nThey were a strange contrast these two men--temperamentally as well as\nphysically--even though they had so much in common and were both the\ndirect products of that same social upheaval which was shaking the\narchaic dominion of France to its very foundations. Martin-Roget, tall,\nbroad-shouldered, bull-necked, the typical self-educated peasant, with\nsquare jaw and flat head, with wide bony hands and spatulated fingers:\nand Chauvelin--the aristocrat turned demagogue, thin and frail-looking,\nbland of manner and suave of speech, with delicate hands and pale,\nalmost ascetic face.\n\nThe one represented all that was most brutish and sensual in this fight\nof one caste against the other, the thirst for the other's blood, the\nhuman beast that has been brought to bay through wrongs perpetrated\nagainst it by others and has turned upon its oppressors, lashing out\nright and left with blind and lustful fury at the crowd of tyrants that\nhad kept him in subjection for so long. Whilst Chauvelin was the\npersonification of the spiritual side of this bloody Revolution--the\nspirit of cool and calculating reprisals that would demand an eye for an\neye and see that it got two. The idealist who dreams of the\nrighteousness of his own cause and the destruction of its enemies, but\nwho leaves to others the accomplishment of all the carnage and the\nbloodshed which his idealism has demanded, and which his reason has\nappraised as necessary for the triumph of which he dreams. Chauvelin was\nthe man of thought and Martin-Roget the man of action. With the one,\nrevenge and reprisals were selfish desires, the avenging of wrongs done\nto himself or to his caste, hatred for those who had injured him or his\nkindred. The other had no personal feelings of hatred: he had no\npersonal wrongs to avenge: his enemies were the enemies of his party,\nthe erstwhile tyrants who in the past had oppressed an entire people.\nEvery man, woman or child who was not satisfied with the present Reign\nof Terror, who plotted or planned for its overthrow, who was not ready\nto see husband, father, wife or child sacrificed for the ultimate\ntriumph of the Revolution was in Chauvelin's sight a noxious creature,\nfit only to be trodden under heel and ground into subjection or\nannihilation as a danger to the State.\n\nMartin-Roget was the personification of sans-culottism, of rough manners\nand foul speech--he chafed against the conventions which forced him to\nwear decent clothes and boots on his feet--he would gladly have seen\nevery one go about the streets half-naked, unwashed, a living sign of\nthat downward levelling of castes which he and his friends stood for,\nand for which they had fought and striven and committed every crime\nwhich human passions let loose could invent. Chauvelin, on the other\nhand, was one of those who wore fine linen and buckled shoes and whose\nhands were delicately washed and perfumed whilst they signed decrees\nwhich sent hundreds of women and children to a violent and cruel death.\n\nThe one trod in the paths of Danton: the other followed in the footsteps\nof Robespierre.\n\n\nII\n\nTogether the two men mounted the outside staircase which leads up past\nthe lodge of the concierge and through the clerk's office to the\ninterior of the stronghold. Outside the monumental doors they had to\nwait a moment or two while the clerk examined their permits to enter.\n\n\"Will you come into my office with me?\" asked Chauvelin of his\ncompanion; \"I have a word or two to add to my report for the Paris\ncourier to-night. I won't be long.\"\n\n\"You are still in touch with the Committee of Public Safety then?\" asked\nMartin-Roget.\n\n\"Always,\" replied the other curtly.\n\nMartin-Roget threw a quick, suspicious glance on his companion. Darkness\nand the broad brim of his sugar-loaf hat effectually concealed even the\noutlines of Chauvelin's face, and Martin-Roget fell to musing over one\nor two things which Carrier had blurted out awhile ago. The whole of\nFrance was overrun with spies these days--every one was under suspicion,\nevery one had to be on his guard. Every word was overheard, every glance\nseen, every sign noted.\n\nWhat was this man Chauvelin doing here in Nantes? What reports did he\nsend up to Paris by special courier? He, the miserable failure who had\nceased to count was nevertheless in constant touch with that awful\nCommittee of Public Safety which was wont to strike at all times and\nunexpectedly in the dark. Martin-Roget shivered beneath his mantle. For\nthe first time since his schemes of vengeance had wholly absorbed his\nmind he regretted the freedom and safety which he had enjoyed in\nEngland, and he marvelled if the miserable game which he was playing\nwould be worth the winning in the end. Nevertheless he had followed\nChauvelin without comment. The man appeared to exercise a fascination\nover him--a kind of subtle power, which emanated from his small shrunken\nfigure, from his pale keen eyes and his well-modulated, suave mode of\nspeech.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe clerk had handed the two men their permits back. They were allowed\nto pass through the gates.\n\nIn the hall some half-dozen men were nominally on guard--nominally,\nbecause discipline was not over strict these days, and the men sat or\nlolled about the place; two of them were intent on a game of dominoes,\nanother was watching them, whilst the other three were settling some\nsort of quarrel among themselves which necessitated vigorous and\nemphatic gestures and the copious use of expletives. One man, who\nappeared to be in command, divided his time impartially between the\ndomino-players and those who were quarrelling.\n\nThe vast place was insufficiently lighted by a chandelier which hung\nfrom the ceiling and a couple of small oil-lamps placed in the circular\nniches in the wall opposite the front door.\n\nNo one took any notice of Martin-Roget or of Chauvelin as they crossed\nthe hall, and presently the latter pushed open a door on the left of\nthe main gates and held it open for his colleague to pass through.\n\n\"You are sure that I shall not be disturbing you?\" queried Martin-Roget.\n\n\"Quite sure,\" replied the other curtly. \"And there is something which I\nmust say to you ... where I know that I shall not be overheard.\"\n\nThen he followed Martin-Roget into the room and closed the door behind\nhim. The room was scantily furnished with a square deal table in the\ncentre, two or three chairs, a broken-down bureau leaning against one\nwall and an iron stove wherein a meagre fire sent a stream of malodorous\nsmoke through sundry cracks in its chimney-pipe. From the ceiling there\nhung an oil-lamp the light of which was thrown down upon the table, by a\nlarge green shade made of cardboard.\n\nChauvelin drew a chair to the bureau and sat down; he pointed to another\nand Martin-Roget took a seat beside the table. He felt restless and\nexcited--his nerves all on the jar: his colleague's calm, sardonic\nglance acted as a further irritant to his temper.\n\n\"What is it that you wished to say to me, citizen Chauvelin?\" he asked\nat last.\n\n\"Just a word, citizen,\" replied the other in his quiet urbane manner. \"I\nhave accompanied you faithfully on your journey to England: I have\nplaced my feeble powers at your disposal: awhile ago I stood between you\nand the proconsul's wrath. This, I think, has earned me the right of\nasking what you intend to do.\"\n\n\"I don't know about the right,\" retorted Martin-Roget gruffly, \"but I\ndon't mind telling you. As you remarked awhile ago the North-West wind\nis wont to be of good counsel. I have thought the matter over whilst I\nwalked with you along the quay and I have decided to act on Carrier's\nsuggestion. Our eminent proconsul said just now that it was the duty of\nevery true patriot to marry an aristo, an he be free and Chance puts a\ncomely wench in his way. I mean,\" he added with a cynical laugh, \"to act\non that advice and marry Yvonne de Kernogan ... if I can.\"\n\n\"She has refused you up to now?\"\n\n\"Yes ... up to now.\"\n\n\"You have threatened her--and her father?\"\n\n\"Yes--both. Not only with death but with shame.\"\n\n\"And still she refuses?\"\n\n\"Apparently,\" said Martin-Roget with ever-growing irritation.\n\n\"It is often difficult,\" rejoined Chauvelin meditatively, \"to compel\nthese aristos. They are obstinate....\"\n\n\"Oh! don't forget that I am in a position now to bring additional\npressure on the wench. That lout Carrier has splendid ideas--a brute,\nwhat? but clever and full of resource. That suggestion of his about the\nRat Mort is splendid....\"\n\n\"You mean to try and act on it?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said Martin-Roget roughly. \"I am going over presently\nto my sister's house to see the Kernogan wench again, and to have\nanother talk with her. Then if she still refuses, if she still chooses\nto scorn the honourable position which I offer her, I shall act on\nCarrier's suggestion. It will be at the Rat Mort to-night that she and I\nwill have our final interview, and there when I dangle the prospect of\nCayenne and the convict's brand before her, she may not prove so\nobdurate as she has been up to now.\"\n\n\"H'm! That is as may be,\" was Chauvelin's dry comment. \"Personally I am\ninclined to agree with Carrier. Death, swift and sure--the Loire or the\nguillotine--is the best that has yet been invented for traitors and\naristos. But we won't discuss that again. I know your feelings in the\nmatter and in a measure I respect them. But if you will allow me I would\nlike to be present at your interview with the _soi-disant_ Lady Anthony\nDewhurst. I won't disturb you and I won't say a word ... but there is\nsomething I would like to make sure of....\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Whether the wench has any hopes ...\" said Chauvelin slowly, \"whether\nshe has received a message or has any premonition ... whether in short\nshe thinks that outside agencies are at work on her behalf.\"\n\n\"Tshaw!\" exclaimed Martin-Roget impatiently, \"you are still harping on\nthat Scarlet Pimpernel idea.\"\n\n\"I am,\" retorted the other drily.\n\n\"As you please. But understand, citizen Chauvelin, that I will not allow\nyou to interfere with my plans, whilst you go off on one of those\nwild-goose chases which have already twice brought you into disrepute.\"\n\n\"I will not interfere with your plans, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin with\nunwonted gentleness, \"but let me in my turn impress one thing upon you,\nand that is that unless you are as wary as the serpent, as cunning as\nthe fox, all your precious plans will be upset by that interfering\nEnglishman whom you choose to disregard.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that I know him--to my cost--and you do not. But you will, an I\nam not gravely mistaken, make acquaintance with him ere your great\nadventure with these Kernogan people is successfully at an end. Believe\nme, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he added impressively, \"you would have been\nfar wiser to accept Carrier's suggestion and let him fling that rabble\ninto the Loire for you.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! you are not childish enough to imagine, citizen Chauvelin, that\nyour Englishman can spirit away that wench from under my sister's eyes?\nDo you know what my sister suffered at the hands of the Kernogans? Do\nyou think that she is like to forget my father's ignominious death any\nmore than I am? And she mourns a lover as well as a father--she mourns\nher youth, her happiness, the mother whom she worshipped. Think you a\nbetter gaoler could be found anywhere? And there are friends of\nmine--lads of our own village, men who hate the Kernogans as bitterly as\nI do myself--who are only too ready to lend Louise a hand in case of\nviolence. And after that--suppose your magnificent Scarlet Pimpernel\nsucceeded in hoodwinking my sister and in evading the vigilance of a\nscore of determined village lads, who would sooner die one by one than\nsee the Kernogan escape--suppose all that, I say, there would still be\nthe guard at every city gate to challenge. No! no! it couldn't be done,\ncitizen Chauvelin,\" he added with a complacent laugh. \"Your Englishman\nwould need the help of a legion of angels, what? to get the wench out of\nNantes this time.\"\n\nChauvelin made no comment on his colleague's impassioned harangue.\nMemory had taken him back to that one day in September in Boulogne when\nhe too had set one prisoner to guard a precious hostage: it brought back\nto his mind a vision of a strangely picturesque figure as it appeared to\nhim in the window-embrasure of the old castle-hall:[1] it brought back\nto his ears the echo of that quaint, irresponsible laughter, of that\nlazy, drawling speech, of all that had acted as an irritant on his\nnerves ere he found himself baffled, foiled, eating out his heart with\nvain reproach at his own folly.\n\n\"I see you are unconvinced, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he said quietly, \"and\nI know that it is the fashion nowadays among young politicians to sneer\nat Chauvelin--the living embodiment of failure. But let me just add\nthis. When you and I talked matters over together at the Bottom Inn, in\nthe wilds of Somersetshire, I warned you that not only was your identity\nknown to the man who calls himself the Scarlet Pimpernel, but also that\nhe knew every one of your plans with regard to the Kernogan wench and\nher father. You laughed at me then ... do you remember?... you shrugged\nyour shoulders and jeered at what you call my far-fetched ideas ... just\nas you do now. Well! will you let me remind you of what happened within\nfour-and-twenty hours of that warning which you chose to disregard? ...\nYvonne de Kernogan was married to Lord Anthony Dewhurst and....\"\n\n\"I know all that, man,\" broke in Martin-Roget impatiently. \"It was all a\nmere coincidence ... the marriage must have been planned long before\nthat ... your Scarlet Pimpernel could not possibly have had anything to\ndo with it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" rejoined Chauvelin drily. \"But mark what has happened\nsince. Just now when we crossed the Place I saw in the distance a figure\nflitting past--the gorgeous figure of an exquisite who of a surety is a\nstranger in Nantes: and carried upon the wings of the north-westerly\nwind there came to me the sound of a voice which, of late, I have only\nheard in my dreams. On my soul, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he added with\nearnest emphasis, \"I assure you that the Scarlet Pimpernel is in Nantes\nat the present moment, that he is scheming, plotting, planning to\nrescue the Kernogan wench out of your clutches. He will not leave her in\nyour power, on this I would stake my life; she is the wife of one of his\ndearest friends: he will not abandon her, not while he keeps that\nresourceful head of his on his shoulders. Unless you are desperately\ncareful he will outwit you; of that I am as convinced as that I am\nalive.\"\n\n\"Bah! you have been dreaming, citizen Chauvelin,\" rejoined Martin-Roget\nwith a laugh and shrugging his broad shoulders; \"your mysterious\nEnglishman in Nantes? Why man! the navigation of the Loire has been\ntotally prohibited these last fourteen days--no carriage, van or vehicle\nof any kind is allowed to enter the city--no man, woman or child to pass\nthe barriers without special permit signed either by the proconsul\nhimself or by Fleury the captain of the Marats. Why! even I, when I\nbrought the Kernogans in overland from Le Croisic, I was detained two\nhours outside Nantes while my papers were sent in to Carrier for\ninspection. You know that, you were with me.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" replied Chauvelin drily, \"and yet....\"\n\nHe paused, with one claw-like finger held erect to demand attention. The\ndoor of the small room in which they sat gave on the big hall where the\nhalf-dozen Marats were stationed, the single window at right angles to\nthe door looked out upon the Place below. It was from there that\nsuddenly there came the sound of a loud peal of laughter--quaint and\nmerry--somewhat inane and affected, and at the sound Chauvelin's pale\nface took on the hue of ashes and even Martin-Roget felt a strange\nsensation of cold creeping down his spine.\n\nFor a few seconds the two men remained quite still, as if a spell had\nbeen cast over them through that light-hearted peal of rippling\nlaughter. Then equally suddenly the younger man shook himself free of\nthe spell; with a few long strides he was already at the door and out in\nthe vast hall; Chauvelin following closely on his heels.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe clock in the tower of the edifice was even then striking five. The\nMarats in the hall looked up with lazy indifference at the two men who\nhad come rushing out in such an abrupt and excited manner.\n\n\"Any stranger been through here?\" queried Chauvelin peremptorily of the\nsergeant in command.\n\n\"No,\" replied the latter curtly. \"How could they, without a permit?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and the men resumed their game and their\nargument. Martin-Roget would have parleyed with them but Chauvelin had\nalready crossed the hall and was striding past the clerk's office and\nthe lodge of the concierge out toward the open. Martin-Roget, after a\nmoment's hesitation, followed him.\n\nThe Place was wrapped in gloom. From the platform of the guillotine an\noil-lamp hoisted on a post threw a small circle of light around. Small\npieces of tallow candle, set in pewter sconces, glimmered feebly under\nthe awnings of the booths, and there was a street-lamp affixed to the\nwall of the old ch\u00c3\u00a2teau immediately below the parapet of the staircase,\nand others at the angles of the Rue de la Monnaye and the narrow Ruelle\ndes Jacobins.\n\nChauvelin's keen eyes tried to pierce the surrounding darkness. He\nleaned over the parapet and peered into the remote angles of the\nbuilding and round the booths below him.\n\nThere were a few people on the Place, some walking rapidly across from\none end to the other, intent on business, others pausing in order to\nmake purchases at the booths. Up and down the steps of the guillotine a\ngroup of street urchins were playing hide-and-seek. Round the angles of\nthe narrow streets the vague figures of passers-by flitted to and fro,\nnow easily discernible in the light of the street lanthorns, anon\nswallowed up again in the darkness beyond. Whilst immediately below the\nparapet two or three men of the Company Marat were lounging against the\nwalls. Their red bonnets showed up clearly in the flickering light of\nthe street lamps, as did their bare shins and the polished points of\ntheir sabots. But of an elegant, picturesque figure such as Chauvelin\nhad described awhile ago there was not a sign.\n\nMartin-Roget leaned over the parapet and called peremptorily:\n\n\"Hey there! citizens of the Company Marat!\"\n\nOne of the red-capped men looked up leisurely.\n\n\"Your desire, citizen?\" he queried with insolent deliberation, for they\nwere mighty men, this bodyguard of the great proconsul, his spies and\ntools in the awesome work of frightfulness which he carried on so\nruthlessly.\n\n\"Is that you Paul Friche?\" queried Martin-Roget in response.\n\n\"At your service, citizen,\" came the glib reply, delivered not without\nmock deference.\n\n\"Then come up here. I wish to speak with you.\"\n\n\"I can't leave my post, nor can my mates,\" retorted the man who had\nanswered to the name of Paul Friche. \"Come down, citizen, an you desire\nto speak with us.\"\n\nMartin-Roget swore lustily.\n\n\"The insolence of that rabble ...\" he murmured.\n\n\"Hush! I'll go,\" interposed Chauvelin quickly. \"Do you know that man\nFriche? Is he trustworthy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know him. As for being trustworthy ...\" added Martin-Roget with\na shrug of the shoulders. \"He is a corporal in the Marats and high in\nfavour with commandant Fleury.\"\n\nEvery second was of value, and Chauvelin was not the man to waste time\nin useless parleyings. He ran down the stairs at the foot of which one\nof the red-capped gentry deigned to speak with him.\n\n\"Have you seen any strangers across the Place just now?\" he queried in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man Friche. \"Two!\"\n\nThen he spat upon the ground and added spitefully: \"Aristos, what? In\nfine clothes--like yourself, citizen....\"\n\n\"Which way did they go?\"\n\n\"Down the Ruelle des Jacobins.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Two minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Why did you not follow them?... Aristos and....\"\n\n\"I would have followed,\" retorted Paul Friche with studied insolence;\n\"'twas you called me away from my duty.\"\n\n\"After them then!\" urged Chauvelin peremptorily. \"They cannot have gone\nfar. They are English spies, and remember, citizen, that there's a\nreward for their apprehension.\"\n\nThe man grunted an eager assent. The word \"reward\" had fired his zeal.\nIn a trice he had called to his mates and the three Marats soon sped\nacross the Place and down the Ruelle des Jacobins where the surrounding\ngloom quickly swallowed them up.\n\nChauvelin watched them till they were out of sight, then he rejoined his\ncolleague on the landing at the top of the stairs. For a second or two\nlonger the click of the men's sabots upon the stones resounded on the\nadjoining streets and across the Place, and suddenly that same quaint,\nmerry, somewhat inane laugh woke the echoes of the grim buildings around\nand caused many a head to turn inquiringly, marvelling who it could be\nthat had the heart to laugh these days in the streets of Nantes.\n\n\nV\n\nFive minutes or so later the three Marats could vaguely be seen\nrecrossing the Place and making their way back to Le Bouffay, where\nMartin-Roget and Chauvelin still stood on the top of the stairs excited\nand expectant. At sight of the men Chauvelin ran down the steps to meet\nthem.\n\n\"Well?\" he queried in an eager whisper.\n\n\"We never saw them,\" replied Paul Friche gruffly, \"though we could hear\nthem clearly enough, talking, laughing and walking very rapidly toward\nthe quay. Then suddenly the earth or the river swallowed them up. We saw\nand heard nothing more.\"\n\nChauvelin swore and a curious hissing sound escaped his thin lips.\n\n\"Don't be too disappointed, citizen,\" added the man with a coarse laugh,\n\"my mate picked this up at the corner of the Ruelle, when, I fancy, we\nwere pressing the aristos pretty closely.\"\n\nHe held out a small bundle of papers tied together with a piece of red\nribbon: the bundle had evidently rolled in the mud, for the papers were\ncovered with grime. Chauvelin's thin, claw-like fingers had at once\nclosed over them.\n\n\"You must give me back those papers, citizen,\" said the man, \"they are\nmy booty. I can only give them up to citizen-captain Fleury.\"\n\n\"I'll give them to the citizen-captain myself,\" retorted Chauvelin. \"For\nthe moment you had best not leave your post of duty,\" he added more\nperemptorily, seeing that the man made as he would follow him.\n\n\"I take orders from no one except ...\" protested the man gruffly.\n\n\"You will take them from me now,\" broke in Chauvelin with a sudden\nassumption of command and authority which sat with weird strangeness\nupon his thin shrunken figure. \"Go back to your post at once, ere I\nlodge a complaint against you for neglect of duty, with the citizen\nproconsul.\"\n\nHe turned on his heel and, without paying further heed to the man and\nhis mutterings, he remounted the stone stairs.\n\n\"No success, I suppose?\" queried Martin-Roget.\n\n\"None,\" replied Chauvelin curtly.\n\nHe had the packet of papers tightly clasped in his hand. He was debating\nin his mind whether he would speak of them to his colleague or not.\n\n\"What did Friche say?\" asked the latter impatiently.\n\n\"Oh! very little. He and his mates caught sight of the strangers and\nfollowed them as far as the quays. But they were walking very fast and\nsuddenly the Marats lost their trace in the darkness. It seemed,\naccording to Paul Friche, as if the earth or the night had swallowed\nthem up.\"\n\n\"And was that all?\"\n\n\"Yes. That was all.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" added Martin-Roget with a light laugh and a careless shrug\nof his wide shoulders, \"I wonder if you and I, citizen Chauvelin--and\nPaul Friche too for that matter--have been the victims of our nerves.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" assented Chauvelin drily. And--quite quietly--he slipped the\npacket of papers in the pocket of his coat.\n\n\"Then we may as well adjourn. There is nothing else you wish to say to\nme about that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel of yours?\"\n\n\"No--nothing.\"\n\n\"And you still would like to hear what the Kernogan wench will say and\nsee how she will look when I put my final proposal before her?\"\n\n\"If you will allow me.\"\n\n\"Then come,\" said Martin-Roget. \"My sister's house is close by.\"\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 1: This adventure is recorded in _The Elusive Pimpernel_.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE FOWLERS\n\n\nI\n\nIn order to reach the Carrefour de la Poissonnerie the two men had to\nskirt the whole edifice of Le Bouffay, walk a little along the quay and\nturn up the narrow alley opposite the bridge. They walked on in silence,\neach absorbed in his own thoughts.\n\nThe house occupied by the citizeness Adet lay back a little from the\nothers in the street. It was one of an irregular row of mean, squalid,\ntumble-down houses, some of them little more than lean-to sheds built\ninto the walls of Le Bouffay. Most of them had overhanging roofs which\nstretched out like awnings more than half way across the road, and even\nat midday shut out any little ray of sunshine which might have a\ntendency to peep into the street below.\n\nIn this year II of the Republic the Carrefour de la Poissonnerie was\nunpaved, dark and evil-smelling. For two thirds of the year it was\nankle-deep in mud: the rest of the time the mud was baked into cakes and\nemitted clouds of sticky dust under the shuffling feet of the\npassers-by. At night it was dimly lighted by one or two broken-down\nlanthorns which were hung on transverse chains overhead from house to\nhouse. These lanthorns only made a very small circle of light\nimmediately below them: the rest of the street was left in darkness,\nsave for the faint glimmer which filtrated through an occasional\nill-fitting doorway or through the chinks of some insecurely fastened\nshutter.\n\nThe Carrefour de la Poissonnerie was practically deserted in the\ndaytime; only a few children--miserable little atoms of humanity showing\ntheir meagre, emaciated bodies through the scanty rags which failed to\ncover their nakedness--played weird, mirthless games in the mud and\nfilth of the street. But at night it became strangely peopled with vague\nand furtive forms that were wont to glide swiftly by, beneath the\nhanging lanthorns, in order to lose themselves again in the welcome\nobscurity beyond: men and women--ill-clothed and unshod, with hands\nburied in pockets or beneath scanty shawls--their feet, oft-times bare,\nmaking no sound as they went squishing through the mud. A perpetual\nsilence used to reign in this kingdom of squalor and of darkness, where\nnight-hawks alone fluttered their wings; only from time to time a\njoyless greeting of boon-companions, or the hoarse cough of some\nwretched consumptive would wake the dormant echoes that lingered in the\ngloom.\n\n\nII\n\nMartin-Roget knew his way about the murky street well enough. He went up\nto the house which lay a little back from the others. It appeared even\nmore squalid than the rest, not a sound came from within--hardly a\nlight--only a narrow glimmer found its way through the chink of a\nshutter on the floor above. To right and left of it the houses were\ntall, with walls that reeked of damp and of filth: from one of\nthese--the one on the left--an iron sign dangled and creaked dismally as\nit swung in the wind. Just above the sign there was a window with\npartially closed shutters: through it came the sound of two husky voices\nraised in heated argument.\n\nIn the open space in front of Louise Adet's house vague forms standing\nabout or lounging against the walls of the neighbouring houses were\nvaguely discernible in the gloom. Martin-Roget and Chauvelin as they\napproached were challenged by a raucous voice which came to them out of\nthe inky blackness around.\n\n\"Halt! who goes there?\"\n\n\"Friends!\" replied Martin-Roget promptly. \"Is citizeness Adet within?\"\n\n\"Yes! she is!\" retorted the man bluntly; \"excuse me, friend Adet--I did\nnot know you in this confounded darkness.\"\n\n\"No harm done,\" said Martin-Roget. \"And it is I who am grateful to you\nall for your vigilance.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the other with a laugh, \"there's not much fear of your bird\ngetting out of its cage. Have no fear, friend Adet! That Kernogan rabble\nis well looked after.\"\n\nThe small group dispersed in the darkness and Martin-Roget rapped\nagainst the door of his sister's house with his knuckles.\n\n\"That is the Rat Mort,\" he said, indicating the building on his left\nwith a nod of the head. \"A very unpleasant neighbourhood for my sister,\nand she has oft complained of it--but name of a dog! won't it prove\nuseful this night?\"\n\nChauvelin had as usual followed his colleague in silence, but his keen\neyes had not failed to note the presence of the village lads of whom\nMartin-Roget had spoken. There are no eyes so watchful as those of hate,\nnor is there aught so incorruptible. Every one of these men here had an\nold wrong to avenge, an old score to settle with those ci-devant\nKernogans who had once been their masters and who were so completely in\ntheir power now. Louise Adet had gathered round her a far more\nefficient bodyguard than even the proconsul could hope to have.\n\nA moment or two later the door was opened, softly and cautiously, and\nMartin-Roget asked: \"Is that you, Louise?\" for of a truth the darkness\nwas almost deeper within than without, and he could not see who it was\nthat was standing by the door.\n\n\"Yes! it is,\" replied a weary and querulous voice. \"Enter quickly. The\nwind is cruel, and I can't keep myself warm. Who is with you, Pierre?\"\n\n\"A friend,\" said Martin-Roget drily. \"We want to see the aristo.\"\n\nThe woman without further comment closed the door behind the new-comers.\nThe place now was as dark as pitch, but she seemed to know her way about\nlike a cat, for her shuffling footsteps were heard moving about\nunerringly. A moment or two later she opened another door opposite the\nfront entrance, revealing an inner room--a sort of kitchen--which was\nlighted by a small lamp.\n\n\"You can go straight up,\" she called curtly to the two men.\n\nThe narrow, winding staircase was divided from this kitchen by a wooden\npartition. Martin-Roget, closely followed by Chauvelin, went up the\nstairs. On the top of these there was a tiny landing with a door on\neither side of it. Martin-Roget without any ceremony pushed open the\ndoor on his right with his foot.\n\nA tallow candle fixed in a bottle and placed in the centre of a table in\nthe middle of the room flickered in the draught as the door flew open.\nIt was bare of everything save a table and a chair, and a bundle of\nstraw in one corner. The tiny window at right angles to the door was\ninnocent of glass, and the north-westerly wind came in an icy stream\nthrough the aperture. On the table, in addition to the candle, there was\na broken pitcher half-filled with water, and a small chunk of brown\nbread blotched with stains of mould.\n\nOn the chair beside the table and immediately facing the door sat Yvonne\nLady Dewhurst. On the wall above her head a hand unused to calligraphy\nhad traced in clumsy characters the words: \"Libert\u00c3\u00a9! Fraternit\u00c3\u00a9!\nEgalit\u00c3\u00a9!\" and below that \"ou la Mort.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThe men entered the narrow room and Chauvelin carefully closed the door\nbehind him. He at once withdrew into a remote comer of the room and\nstood there quite still, wrapped in his mantle, a small, silent,\nmysterious figure on which Yvonne fixed dark, inquiring eyes.\n\nMartin-Roget, restless and excited, paced up and down the small space\nlike a wild animal in a cage. From time to time exclamations of\nimpatience escaped him and he struck one fist repeatedly against his\nopen palm. Yvonne followed his movements with a quiet, uninterested\nglance, but Chauvelin paid no heed whatever to him.\n\nHe was watching Yvonne ceaselessly, and closely.\n\nThree days' incarceration in this wind-swept attic, the lack of decent\nfood and of warmth, the want of sleep and the horror of her present\nposition all following upon the soul-agony which she had endured when\nshe was forcibly torn away from her dear milor, had left their mark on\nYvonne Dewhurst's fresh young face. The look of gravity which had always\nsat so quaintly on her piquant features had now changed to one of deep\nand abiding sorrow; her large dark eyes were circled and sunk; they had\nin them the unnatural glow of fever, as well as the settled look of\nhorror and of pathetic resignation. Her soft brown hair had lost its\nlustre; her cheeks were drawn and absolutely colourless.\n\nMartin-Roget paused in his restless walk. For a moment he stood silent\nand absorbed, contemplating by the flickering light of the candle all\nthe havoc which his brutality had wrought upon Yvonne's dainty face.\n\nBut Yvonne after a while ceased to look at him--she appeared to be\nunconscious of the gaze of these two men, each of whom was at this\nmoment only thinking of the evil which he meant to inflict upon\nher--each of whom only thought of her as a helpless bird whom he had at\nlast ensnared and whom he could crush to death as soon as he felt so\ninclined.\n\nShe kept her lips tightly closed and her head averted. She was gazing\nacross at the unglazed window into the obscurity beyond, marvelling in\nwhat direction lay the sea and the shores of England.\n\nMartin-Roget crossed his arms over his broad chest and clutched his\nelbows with his hands with an obvious effort to keep control over his\nmovements and his temper in check. The quiet, almost indifferent\nattitude of the girl was exasperating to his over-strung nerves.\n\n\"Look here, my girl,\" he said at last, roughly and peremptorily, \"I had\nan interview with the proconsul this afternoon. He chides me for my\nleniency toward you. Three days he thinks is far too long to keep\ntraitors eating the bread of honest citizens and taking up valuable\nspace in our city. Yesterday I made a proposal to you. Have you thought\non it?\"\n\nYvonne made no reply. She was still gazing out into nothingness and just\nat that moment she was very far away from the narrow, squalid room and\nthe company of these two inhuman brutes. She was thinking of her dear\nmilor and of that lovely home at Combwich wherein she had spent three\nsuch unforgettable days. She was remembering how beautiful had been the\ncolour of the bare twigs in the chestnut coppice when the wintry sun\ndanced through and in between them and drew fantastic patterns of living\ngold upon the carpet of dead leaves; and she remembered too how\nexquisite were the tints of russet and blue on the distant hills, and\nhow quaintly the thrushes had called: \"Kiss me quick!\" She saw again\nthose trembling leaves of a delicious faintly crimson hue which still\nhung upon the branches of the scarlet oak, and the early flowering heath\nwhich clothed the moors with a gorgeous mantle of rosy amethyst.\n\nMartin-Roget's harsh voice brought her abruptly back to the hideous\nreality of the moment.\n\n\"Your obstinacy will avail you nothing,\" he said, speaking quietly, even\nthough a note of intense irritation was distinctly perceptible in his\nvoice. \"The proconsul has given me a further delay wherein to deal\nleniently with you and with your father if I am so minded. You know what\nI have proposed to you: Life with me as my wife--in which case your\nfather will be free to return to England or to go to the devil as he\npleases--or the death of a malefactor for you both in the company of all\nthe thieves and evil-doers who are mouldering in the prisons of Nantes\nat this moment. Another delay wherein to choose between an honourable\nlife and a shameful death. The proconsul waits. But to-night he must\nhave his answer.\"\n\nThen Yvonne turned her head slowly and looked calmly on her enemy.\n\n\"The tyrant who murders innocent men, women and children,\" she said,\n\"can have his answer now. I choose death which is inevitable in\npreference to a life of shame.\"\n\n\"You seem,\" he retorted, \"to have lost sight of the fact that the law\ngives me the right to take by force that which you so obstinately\nrefuse.\"\n\n\"Have I not said,\" she replied, \"that death is my choice? Life with you\nwould be a life of shame.\"\n\n\"I can get a priest to marry us without your consent: and your religion\nforbids you to take your own life,\" he said with a sneer.\n\nTo this she made no reply, but he knew that he had his answer.\nSmothering a curse, he resumed after a while:\n\n\"So you prefer to drag your father to death with you? Yet he has begged\nyou to consider your decision and to listen to reason. He has given his\nconsent to our marriage.\"\n\n\"Let me see my father,\" she retorted firmly, \"and hear him say that with\nhis own lips.\n\n\"Ah!\" she added quickly, for at her words Martin-Roget had turned his\nhead away and shrugged his shoulders with well-assumed indifference,\n\"you cannot and dare not let me see him. For three days now you have\nkept us apart and no doubt fed us both up with your lies. My father is\nduc de Kernogan, Marquis de Trentemoult,\" she added proudly, \"he would\nfar rather die side by side with his daughter than see her wedded to a\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"And you, my girl,\" rejoined Martin-Roget coldly, \"would you see your\nfather branded as a malefactor, linked to a thief and sent to perish in\nthe Loire?\"\n\n\"My father,\" she retorted, \"will die as he has lived, a brave and\nhonourable gentleman. The brand of a malefactor cannot cling to his\nname. Sorrow we are ready to endure--death is less than nothing to\nus--we will but follow in the footsteps of our King and of our Queen\nand of many whom we care for and whom you and your proconsul and your\ncolleagues have brutally murdered. Shame cannot touch us, and our honour\nand our pride are so far beyond your reach that your impious and\nblood-stained hands can never sully them.\"\n\nShe had spoken very slowly and very quietly. There were no heroics about\nher attitude. Even Martin-Roget--callous brute though he was--felt that\nshe had only spoken just as she felt, and that nothing that he might\nsay, no plea that he might urge, would ever shake her determination.\n\n\"Then it seems to me,\" he said, \"that I am only wasting my time by\ntrying to make you see reason and common-sense. You look upon me as a\nbrute. Well! perhaps I am. At any rate I am that which your father and\nyou have made me. Four years ago, when you had power over me and over\nmine, you brutalised us. To-day we--the people--are your masters and we\nmake you suffer, not for all--that were impossible--but for part of what\nyou made us suffer. That, after all, is only bare justice. By making you\nmy wife I would have saved you from death--not from humiliation, for\nthat you must endure, and at my hands in a full measure--but I would\nhave made you my wife because I still have pleasant recollections of\nthat kiss which I snatched from you on that never-to-be-forgotten night\nand in the darkness--a kiss for which you would gladly have seen me hang\nthen, if you could have laid hands on me.\"\n\nHe paused, trying to read what was going on behind those fine eyes of\nhers, with their vacant, far-seeing gaze which seemed like another\nbarrier between her and him. At this rough allusion to that moment of\nhorror and of shame, she had not moved a muscle, nor did her gaze lose\nits fixity.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"It is an unpleasant recollection, eh, my proud lady? The first kiss of\npassion was not implanted on your exquisite lips by that fine gentleman\nwhom you deemed worthy of your hand and your love, but by Pierre Adet,\nthe miller's son, what? a creature not quite so human as your horse or\nyour pet dog. Neither you nor I are like to forget that methinks....\"\n\nYvonne vouchsafed no reply to the taunt, and for a moment there was\nsilence in the room, until Chauvelin's thin, suave voice broke in quite\ngently:\n\n\"Do not lose your patience with the wench, citizen Martin-Roget. Your\ntime is too precious to be wasted in useless recriminations.\"\n\n\"I have finished with her,\" retorted the other sullenly. \"She shall be\ndealt with now as I think best. I agree with citizen Carrier. He is\nright after all. To the Loire with the lot of that foul brood!\"\n\n\"Nay!\" here rejoined Chauvelin with placid urbanity, \"are you not a\nlittle harsh, citizen, with our fair Yvonne? Remember! Women have moods\nand megrims. What they indignantly refuse to yield to us one day, they\nwill grant with a smile the next. Our beautiful Yvonne is no exception\nto this rule, I'll warrant.\"\n\nEven while he spoke he threw a glance of warning on his colleague. There\nwas something enigmatic in his manner at this moment, in the strange\nsuavity wherewith he spoke these words of conciliation and of\ngentleness. Martin-Roget was as usual ready with an impatient retort. He\nwas in a mood to bully and to brutalise, to heap threat upon threat, to\nwin by frightfulness that which he could not gain by persuasion. Perhaps\nthat at this moment he desired Yvonne de Kernogan for wife, more even\nthan he desired her death. At any rate his headstrong temper was ready\nto chafe against any warning or advice. But once again Chauvelin's\nstronger mentality dominated over his less resolute colleague.\nMartin-Roget--the fowler--was in his turn caught in the net of a keener\nsnarer than himself, and whilst--with the obstinacy of the weak--he was\nmaking mental resolutions to rebuke Chauvelin for his interference later\non, he had already fallen in with the latter's attitude.\n\n\"The wench has had three whole days wherein to alter her present mood,\"\nhe said more quietly, \"and you know yourself, citizen, that the\nproconsul will not wait after to-day.\"\n\n\"The day is young yet,\" rejoined Chauvelin. \"It still hath six hours to\nits credit.... Six hours.... Three hundred and sixty minutes!\" he\ncontinued with a pleasant little laugh; \"time enough for a woman to\nchange her mind three hundred and sixty times. Let me advise you,\ncitizen, to leave the wench to her own meditations for the present, and\nI trust that she will accept the advice of a man who has a sincere\nregard for her beauty and her charms and who is old enough to be her\nfather, and seriously think the situation over in a conciliatory spirit.\nM. le duc de Kernogan will be grateful to her, for of a truth he is not\nover happy either at the moment ... and will be still less happy in the\nd\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t to-morrow: it is over-crowded, and typhus, I fear me, is rampant\namong the prisoners. He has, I am convinced--in spite of what the\ncitizeness says to the contrary--a rooted objection to being hurled into\nthe Loire, or to be arraigned before the bar of the Convention, not as\nan aristocrat and a traitor but as an unit of an undesirable herd of\ncriminals sent up to Paris for trial, by an anxious and harried\nproconsul. There! there!\" he added benignly, \"we will not worry our fair\nYvonne any longer, will we, citizen? I think she has grasped the\nalternative and will soon realise that marriage with an honourable\npatriot is not such an untoward fate after all.\"\n\n\"And now, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he concluded, \"I pray you allow me to\ntake my leave of the fair lady and to give you the wise recommendation\nto do likewise. She will be far better alone for awhile. Night brings\ngood counsel, so they say.\"\n\nHe watched the girl keenly while he spoke. Her impassivity had not\ndeserted her for a single moment: but whether her calmness was of hope\nor of despair he was unable to decide. On the whole he thought it must\nbe the latter: hope would have kindled a spark in those dark,\npurple-rimmed eyes, it would have brought moisture to the lips, a tremor\nto the hand.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel was in Nantes--that fact was established beyond a\ndoubt--but Chauvelin had come to the conclusion that so far as Yvonne\nDewhurst herself was concerned, she knew nothing of the mysterious\nagencies that were working on her behalf.\n\nChauvelin's hand closed with a nervous contraction over the packet of\npapers in his pocket. Something of the secret of that enigmatic English\nadventurer lay revealed within its folds. Chauvelin had not yet had the\nopportunity of examining them: the interview with Yvonne had been the\nmost important business for the moment.\n\nFrom somewhere in the distance a city clock struck six. The afternoon\nwas wearing on. The keenest brain in Europe was on the watch to drag one\nwoman and one man from the deadly trap which had been so successfully\nset for them. A few hours more and Chauvelin in his turn would be\npitting his wits against the resources of that intricate brain, and he\nfelt like a war-horse scenting blood and battle. He was aching to get\nto work--aching to form his plans--to lay his snares--to dispose his\ntrap so that the noble English quarry should not fail to be caught\nwithin its meshes.\n\nHe gave a last look to Yvonne, who was still sitting quite impassive,\ngazing through the squalid walls into some beautiful distance, the\nreflection of which gave to her pale, wan face an added beauty.\n\n\"Let us go, citizen Martin-Roget,\" he said peremptorily. \"There is\nnothing else that we can do here.\"\n\nAnd Martin-Roget, the weaker morally of the two, yielded to the stronger\npersonality of his colleague. He would have liked to stay on for awhile,\nto gloat for a few moments longer over the helplessness of the woman who\nto him represented the root of every evil which had ever befallen him\nand his family. But Chauvelin commanded and he felt impelled to obey. He\ngave one long, last look on Yvonne--a look that was as full of triumph\nas of mockery--he looked round the four dank walls, the unglazed window,\nthe broken pitcher, the mouldy bread. Revenge was of a truth the\nsweetest emotion of the human heart. Pierre Adet--son of the miller who\nhad been hanged by orders of the Duc de Kernogan for a crime which he\nhad never committed--would not at this moment have changed places with\nFortune's Benjamin.\n\n\nIV\n\nDownstairs in Louise Adet's kitchen, Martin-Roget seized his colleague\nby the arm.\n\n\"Sit down a moment, citizen,\" he said persuasively, \"and tell me what\nyou think of it all.\"\n\nChauvelin sat down at the other's invitation. All his movements were\nslow, deliberate, perfectly calm.\n\n\"I think,\" he said drily, \"as far as your marriage with the wench is\nconcerned, that you are beaten, my friend.\"\n\n\"Tshaw!\" The exclamation, raucous and surcharged with hate came from\nLouise Adet. She, too, like Pierre--more so than Pierre mayhap--had\ncause to hate the Kernogans. She, too, like Pierre had lived the last\nthree days in the full enjoyment of the thought that Fate and Chance\nwere about to level things at last between herself and those detested\naristos. Silent and sullen she was shuffling about in the room, among\nher pots and pans, but she kept an eye upon her brother's movements and\nan ear on what he said. Men were apt to lose grit where a pretty wench\nwas concerned. It takes a woman's rancour and a woman's determination to\ncarry a scheme of vengeance against another to a successful end.\n\nMartin-Roget rejoined more calmly:\n\n\"I knew that she would still be obstinate,\" he said. \"If I forced her\ninto a marriage, which I have the right to do, she might take her own\nlife and make me look a fool. So I don't want to do that. I believe in\nthe persuasiveness of the Rat Mort to-night,\" he added with a cynical\nlaugh, \"and if that fails.... Well! I was never really in love with the\nfair Yvonne, and now she has even ceased to be desirable.... If the Rat\nMort fails to act on her sensibilities as I would wish, I can easily\nconsole myself by following Carrier's herd to Paris. Louise shall come\nwith me--eh, little sister?--and we'll give ourselves the satisfaction\nof seeing M. le duc de Kernogan and his exquisite daughter stand in the\nfelon's dock--tried for malpractices and for evil living. We'll see them\nbranded as convicts and packed off like so much cattle to Cayenne. That\nwill be a sight,\" he concluded with a deep sigh of satisfaction, \"which\nwill bring rest to my soul.\"\n\nHe paused: his face looked sullen and evil under the domination of that\npassion which tortured him.\n\nLouise Adet had shuffled up close to her brother. In one hand she held\nthe wooden spoon wherewith she had been stirring the soup: with the\nother she brushed away the dark, lank hair which hung in strands over\nher high, pale forehead. In appearance she was a woman immeasurably\nolder than her years. Her face had the colour of yellow parchment, her\nskin was stretched tightly over her high cheekbones--her lips were\ncolourless and her eyes large, wide-open, were pale in hue and circled\nwith red. Just now a deep frown of puzzlement between her brows added a\nsinister expression to her cadaverous face:\n\n\"The Rat Mort?\" she queried in that tired voice of hers, \"Cayenne? What\nis all that about?\"\n\n\"A splendid scheme of Carrier's, my Louise,\" replied Martin-Roget\nairily. \"We convey the Kernogan woman to the Rat Mort. To-night a\ndescent will be made on that tavern of ill-fame by a company of Marats\nand every man, woman and child within it will be arrested and sent to\nParis as undesirable inhabitants of this most moral city: in Paris they\nwill be tried as malefactors or evil-doers--cut throats, thieves, what?\nand deported as convicts to Cayenne, or else sent to the guillotine. The\nKernogans among that herd! What sayest thou to that, little sister? Thy\nfather, thy lover, hung as thieves! M. le Duc and Mademoiselle branded\nas convicts! 'Tis pleasant to think on, eh?\"\n\nLouise made no reply. She stood looking at her brother, her pale,\nred-rimmed eyes seemed to drink in every word that he uttered, while her\nbony hand wandered mechanically across and across her forehead as if in\na pathetic endeavour to clear the brain from everything save of the\nsatisfying thoughts which this prospect of revenge had engendered.\n\nChauvelin's gentle voice broke in on her meditations.\n\n\"In the meanwhile,\" he said placidly, \"remember my warning, citizen\nMartin-Roget. There are passing clever and mighty agencies at work, even\nat this hour, to wrest your prey from you. How will you convey the wench\nto the Rat Mort? Carrier has warned you of spies--but I have warned you\nagainst a crowd of English adventurers far more dangerous than an army\nof spies. Three pairs of eyes--probably more, and one pair the keenest\nin Europe--will be on the watch to seize upon the woman and to carry her\noff under your very nose.\"\n\nMartin-Roget uttered a savage oath.\n\n\"That brute Carrier has left me in the lurch,\" he said roughly. \"I don't\nbelieve in your nightmares and your English adventurers, still it would\nhave been better if I could have had the woman conveyed to the tavern\nunder armed escort.\"\n\n\"Armed escort has been denied you, and anyway it would not be much use.\nYou and I, citizen Martin-Roget, must act independently of Carrier. Your\nfriends down there,\" he added, indicating the street with a jerk of the\nhead, \"must redouble their watchfulness. The village lads of Vertou are\nof a truth no match intellectually with our English adventurers, but\nthey have vigorous fists in case there is an attack on the wench while\nshe walks across to the Rat Mort.\"\n\n\"It would be simpler,\" here interposed Louise roughly, \"if we were to\nknock the wench on the head and then let the lads carry her across.\"\n\n\"It would not be simpler,\" retorted Chauvelin drily, \"for Carrier might\nat any moment turn against us. Commandant Fleury with half a company of\nMarats will be posted round the Rat Mort, remember. They may interfere\nwith the lads and arrest them and snatch the wench from us, when all our\nplans may fall to the ground ... one never knows what double game\nCarrier may be playing. No! no! the girl must not be dragged or carried\nto the Rat Mort. She must walk into the trap of her own free will.\"\n\n\"But name of a dog! how is it to be done?\" ejaculated Martin-Roget, and\nhe brought his clenched fist crashing down upon the table. \"The woman\nwill not follow me--or Louise either--anywhere willingly.\"\n\n\"She must follow a stranger then--or one whom she thinks a\nstranger--some one who will have gained her confidence....\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing is impossible, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin blandly.\n\n\"Do you know a way then?\" queried the other with a sneer.\n\n\"I think I do. If you will trust me that is----\"\n\n\"I don't know that I do. Your mind is so intent on those English\nadventurers, you are like as not to let the aristos slip through your\nfingers.\"\n\n\"Well, citizen,\" retorted Chauvelin imperturbably, \"will you take the\nrisk of conveying the fair Yvonne to the Rat Mort by twelve o'clock\nto-night? I have very many things to see to, I confess that I should be\nglad if you will ease me from that responsibility.\"\n\n\"I have already told you that I see no way,\" retorted Martin-Roget with\na snarl.\n\n\"Then why not let me act?\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"For the moment I am going for a walk on the quay and once more will\ncommune with the North-West wind.\"\n\n\"Tshaw!\" ejaculated Martin-Roget savagely.\n\n\"Nay, citizen,\" resumed Chauvelin blandly, \"the winds of heaven are\nexcellent counsellors. I told you so just now and you agreed with me.\nThey blow away the cobwebs of the mind and clear the brain for serious\nthinking. You want the Kernogan girl to be arrested inside the Rat Mort\nand you see no way of conveying her thither save by the use of violence,\nwhich for obvious reasons is to be deprecated: Carrier, for equally\nobvious reasons, will not have her taken to the place by force. On the\nother hand you admit that the wench would not follow you\nwillingly----Well, citizen, we must find a way out of that impasse, for\nit is too unimportant an one to stand in the way of our plans: for this\nI must hold a consultation with the North-West wind.\"\n\n\"I won't allow you to do anything without consulting me.\"\n\n\"Am I likely to do that? To begin with I shall have need of your\nco-operation and that of the citizeness.\"\n\n\"In that case ...\" muttered Martin-Roget grudgingly. \"But remember,\" he\nadded with a return to his usual self-assured manner, \"remember that\nYvonne and her father belong to me and not to you. I brought them into\nNantes for mine own purposes--not for yours. I will not have my revenge\njeopardised so that your schemes may be furthered.\"\n\n\"Who spoke of my schemes, citizen Martin-Roget?\" broke in Chauvelin with\nperfect urbanity. \"Surely not I? What am I but an humble tool in the\nservice of the Republic?... a tool that has proved useless--a failure,\nwhat? My only desire is to help you to the best of my abilities. Your\nenemies are the enemies of the Republic: my ambition is to help you in\ndestroying them.\"\n\nFor a moment longer Martin-Roget hesitated: he abominated this\nsuggestion of becoming a mere instrument in the hands of this man whom\nhe still would have affected to despise--had he dared. But here came the\ndifficulty: he no longer dared to despise Chauvelin. He felt the\nstrength of the man--the clearness of his intellect, and though\nhe--Martin-Roget--still chose to disregard every warning in connexion\nwith the English spies, he could not wholly divest his mind from the\npossibility of their presence in Nantes. Carrier's scheme was so\nmagnificent, so satisfying, that the ex-miller's son was ready to humble\nhis pride and set his arrogance aside in order to see it carried through\nsuccessfully.\n\nSo after a moment or two, despite the fact that he positively ached to\nshut Chauvelin out of the whole business, Martin-Roget gave a grudging\nassent to his proposal.\n\n\"Very well!\" he said, \"you see to it. So long as it does not interfere\nwith my plans....\"\n\n\"It can but help them,\" rejoined Chauvelin suavely. \"If you will act as\nI shall direct I pledge you my word that the wench will walk to the Rat\nMort of her free will and at the hour when you want her. What else is\nthere to say?\"\n\n\"When and where shall we meet again?\"\n\n\"Within the hour I will return here and explain to you and to the\ncitizeness what I want you to do. We will get the aristos inside the Rat\nMort, never fear; and after that I think that we may safely leave\nCarrier to do the rest, what?\"\n\nHe picked up his hat and wrapped his mantle round him. He took no\nfurther heed of Martin-Roget or of Louise, for suddenly he had felt the\ncrackling of crisp paper inside the breast-pocket of his coat and in a\nmoment the spirit of the man had gone a-roaming out of the narrow\nconfines of this squalid abode. It had crossed the English Channel and\nwandered once more into a brilliantly-lighted ball-room where an\nexquisitely dressed dandy declaimed inanities and doggrel rhymes for the\ndelectation of a flippant assembly: it heard once more the lazy,\ndrawling speech, the inane, affected laugh, it caught the glance of a\npair of lazy, grey eyes fixed mockingly upon him. Chauvelin's thin\nclaw-like hand went back to his pocket: it felt that packet of papers,\nit closed over it like a vulture's talon does upon a prey. He no longer\nheard Martin-Roget's obstinate murmurings, he no longer felt himself to\nbe the disgraced, humiliated servant of the State: rather did he feel\nonce more the master, the leader, the successful weaver of an hundred\nclever intrigues. The enemy who had baffled him so often had chosen once\nmore to throw down the glove of mocking defiance. So be it! The battle\nwould be fought this night--a decisive one--and long live the Republic\nand the power of the people!\n\nWith a curt nod of the head Chauvelin turned on his heel and without\nwaiting for Martin-Roget to follow him, or for Louise to light him on\nhis way, he strode from the room, and out of the house, and had soon\ndisappeared in the darkness in the direction of the quay.\n\n\nV\n\nOnce more free from the encumbering companionship of Martin-Roget,\nChauvelin felt free to breathe and to think. He, the obscure and\nimpassive servant of the Republic, the cold-blooded Terrorist who had\ngone through every phrase of an exciting career without moving a muscle\nof his grave countenance, felt as if every one of his arteries was on\nfire. He strode along the quay in the teeth of the north-westerly wind,\ngrateful for the cold blast which lashed his face and cooled his\nthrobbing temples.\n\nThe packet of papers inside his coat seemed to sear his breast.\n\nBefore turning to go along the quay he paused, hesitating for a moment\nwhat he would do. His very humble lodgings were at the far end of the\ntown, and every minute of time was precious. Inside Le Bouffay, where he\nhad a small room allotted to him as a minor representative in Nantes of\nthe Committee of Public Safety, there was the ever present danger of\nprying eyes.\n\nOn the whole--since time was so precious--he decided on returning to Le\nBouffay. The concierge and the clerk fortunately let him through without\nthose official delays which he--Chauvelin--was wont to find so galling\never since his disgrace had put a bar against the opening of every door\nat the bare mention of his name or the display of his tricolour scarf.\n\nHe strode rapidly across the hall: the men on guard eyed him with lazy\nindifference as he passed. Once inside his own sanctum he looked\ncarefully around him; he drew the curtain closer across the window and\ndragged the table and a chair well away from the range which might be\ncovered by an eye at the keyhole. It was only when he had thoroughly\nassured himself that no searching eye or inquisitive ear could possibly\nbe watching over him that he at last drew the precious packet of papers\nfrom his pocket. He undid the red ribbon which held it together and\nspread the papers out on the table before him. Then he examined them\ncarefully one by one.\n\nAs he did so an exclamation of wrath or of impatience escaped him from\ntime to time, once he laughed--involuntarily--aloud.\n\nThe examination of the papers took him some time. When he had finished\nhe gathered them all together again, retied the bit of ribbon round them\nand slipped the packet back into the pocket of his coat. There was a\nlook of grim determination on his face, even though a bitter sigh\nescaped his set lips.\n\n\"Oh! for the power,\" he muttered to himself, \"which I had a year ago!\nfor the power to deal with mine enemy myself. So you have come to\nNantes, my valiant Sir Percy Blakeney?\" he added while a short, sardonic\nlaugh escaped his thin, set lips: \"and you are determined that I shall\nknow how and why you came! Do you reckon, I wonder, that I have no\nlonger the power to deal with you? Well!...\"\n\nHe sighed again but with more satisfaction this time.\n\n\"Well!...\" he reiterated with obvious complacency. \"Unless that oaf\nCarrier is a bigger fool than I imagine him to be I think I have you\nthis time, my elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE NET\n\n\nI\n\nIt was not an easy thing to obtain an audience of the great proconsul at\nthis hour of the night, nor was Chauvelin, the disgraced servant of the\nCommittee of Public Safety, a man to be considered. Carrier, with his\nlove of ostentation and of tyranny, found great delight in keeping his\ncolleagues waiting upon his pleasure, and he knew that he could trust\nyoung Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt to be as insolent as any tyrant's flunkey of yore.\n\n\"I must speak with the proconsul at once,\" had been Chauvelin's urgent\nrequest of Fleury, the commandant of the great man's bodyguard.\n\n\"The proconsul dines at this hour,\" had been Fleury's curt reply.\n\n\"'Tis a matter which concerns the welfare and the safety of the State!\"\n\n\"The proconsul's health is the concern of the State too, and he dines at\nthis hour and must not be disturbed.\"\n\n\"Commandant Fleury!\" urged Chauvelin, \"you risk being implicated in a\ndisaster. Danger and disgrace threaten the proconsul and all his\nadherents. I must speak with citizen Carrier at once.\"\n\nFortunately for Chauvelin there were two keys which, when all else\nfailed, were apt to open the doors of Carrier's stronghold: the key of\nfear and that of cupidity. He tried both and succeeded. He bribed and\nhe threatened: he endured Fleury's brutality and Lalou\u00c3\u00abt's impertinence\nbut he got his way. After an hour's weary waiting and ceaseless\nparleyings he was once more ushered into the antechamber where he had\nsat earlier in the day. The doors leading to the inner sanctuary were\nopen. Young Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt stood by them on guard. Carrier, fuming and\nraging at having been disturbed, vented his spleen and ill-temper on\nChauvelin.\n\n\"If the news that you bring me is not worth my consideration,\" he cried\nsavagely, \"I'll send you to moulder in Le Bouffay or to drink the waters\nof the Loire.\"\n\nChauvelin silent, self-effaced, allowed the flood of the great man's\nwrath to spend itself in threats. Then he said quietly:\n\n\"Citizen proconsul I have come to tell you that the English spy, who is\ncalled the Scarlet Pimpernel, is now in Nantes. There is a reward of\ntwenty thousand francs for his capture and I want your help to lay him\nby the heels.\"\n\nCarrier suddenly paused in his ravings. He sank into a chair and a livid\nhue spread over his face.\n\n\"It's not true!\" he murmured hoarsely.\n\n\"I saw him--not an hour ago....\"\n\n\"What proof have you?\"\n\n\"I'll show them to you--but not across this threshold. Let me enter,\ncitizen proconsul, and close your sanctuary doors behind me rather than\nbefore. What I have come hither to tell you, can only be said between\nfour walls.\"\n\n\"I'll make you tell me,\" broke in Carrier in a raucous voice, which\nexcitement and fear caused almost to choke in his throat. \"I'll make you\n... curse you for the traitor that you are.... Curse you!\" he cried more\nvigorously, \"I'll make you speak. Will you shield a spy by your\nsilence, you miserable traitor? If you do I'll send you to rot in the\nmud of the Loire with other traitors less accursed than yourself.\"\n\n\"If you only knew,\" was Chauvelin's calm rejoinder to the other's\nravings, \"how little I care for life. I only live to be even one day\nwith an enemy whom I hate. That enemy is now in Nantes, but I am like a\nbird of prey whose wings have been clipped. If you do not help me mine\nenemy will again go free--and death in that case matters little or\nnothing to me.\"\n\nFor a moment longer Carrier hesitated. Fear had gripped him by the\nthroat. Chauvelin's earnestness seemed to vouch for the truth of his\nassertion, and if this were so--if those English spies were indeed in\nNantes--then his own life was in deadly danger. He--like every one of\nthose bloodthirsty tyrants who had misused the sacred names of\nFraternity and of Equality--had learned to dread the machinations of\nthose mysterious Englishmen and of their unconquerable leader. Popular\nsuperstition had it that they were spies of the English Government and\nthat they were not only bent on saving traitors from well-merited\npunishment but that they were hired assassins paid by Mr. Pitt to murder\nevery faithful servant of the Republic. The name of the Scarlet\nPimpernel, so significantly uttered by Chauvelin, had turned Carrier's\nsallow cheeks to a livid hue. Sick with terror now he called Lalou\u00c3\u00abt to\nhim. He clung to the boy with both arms as to the one being in this\nworld whom he trusted.\n\n\"What shall we do, Jacques?\" he murmured hoarsely, \"shall we let him\nin?\"\n\nThe boy roughly shook himself free from the embrace of the great\nproconsul.\n\n\"If you want twenty thousand francs,\" he said with a dry laugh, \"I\nshould listen quietly to what citizen Chauvelin has to say.\"\n\nTerror and rapacity were ranged on one side against inordinate vanity.\nThe thought of twenty thousand francs made Carrier's ugly mouth water.\nMoney was ever scarce these days: also the fear of assassination was a\nspectre which haunted him at all hours of the day and night. On the\nother hand he positively worshipped the mystery wherewith he surrounded\nhimself. It had been his boast for some time now that no one save the\nchosen few had crossed the threshold of his private chamber: and he was\nmiserably afraid not only of Chauvelin's possible evil intentions, but\nalso that this despicable ex-aristo and equally despicable failure would\nboast in the future of an ascendancy over him.\n\nHe thought the matter over for fully five minutes, during which there\nwas dead silence in the two rooms--silence only broken by the stertorous\nbreathing of that wretched coward, and the measured ticking of the fine\nBuhl clock behind him. Chauvelin's pale eyes were fixed upon the\ndarkness, through which he could vaguely discern the uncouth figure of\nthe proconsul, sprawling over his desk. Which way would his passions\nsway him? Chauvelin as he watched and waited felt that his habitual\nself-control was perhaps more severely taxed at this moment than it had\never been before. Upon the swaying of those passions, the passions of a\nman infinitely craven and infinitely base, depended all\nhis--Chauvelin's--hopes of getting even at last with a daring and\nresourceful foe. Terror and rapacity were the counsellors which ranged\nthemselves on the side of his schemes, but mere vanity and caprice\nfought a hard battle too.\n\nIn the end it was rapacity that gained the victory. An impatient\nexclamation from young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt roused Carrier from his sombre brooding\nand hastened on a decision which was destined to have such momentous\nconsequences for the future of both these men.\n\n\"Introduce citizen Chauvelin in here, Lalou\u00c3\u00abt,\" said the proconsul\ngrudgingly. \"I will listen to what he has to say.\"\n\n\nII\n\nChauvelin crossed the threshold of the tyrant's sanctuary, in no way\nawed by the majesty of that dreaded presence or confused by the air of\nmystery which hung about the room.\n\nHe did not even bestow a glance on the multitudinous objects of art and\nthe priceless furniture which littered the tiger's lair. His pale face\nremained quite expressionless as he bowed solemnly before Carrier and\nthen took the chair which was indicated to him. Young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt fetched a\ncandelabra from the ante-room and carried it into the audience chamber:\nthen he closed the communicating doors. The candelabra he placed on a\nconsole-table immediately behind Carrier's desk and chair, so that the\nlatter's face remained in complete shadow, whilst the light fell full\nupon Chauvelin.\n\n\"Well! what is it?\" queried the proconsul roughly. \"What is this story\nof English spies inside Nantes? How did they get here? Who is\nresponsible for keeping such rabble out of our city? Name of a dog, but\nsome one has been careless of duty! and carelessness these days is\nclosely allied to treason.\"\n\nHe talked loudly and volubly--his inordinate terror causing the words to\ncome tumbling, almost incoherently, out of his mouth. Finally he turned\non Chauvelin with a snarl like an angry cat:\n\n\"And how comes it, citizen,\" he added savagely, \"that you alone here in\nNantes are acquainted with the whereabouts of those dangerous spies?\"\n\n\"I caught sight of them,\" rejoined Chauvelin calmly, \"this afternoon\nafter I left you. I knew we should have them here, the moment citizen\nMartin-Roget brought the Kernogans into the city. The woman is the wife\nof one of them.\"\n\n\"Curse that blundering fool Martin-Roget for bringing that rabble about\nour ears, and those assassins inside our gates.\"\n\n\"Nay! Why should you complain, citizen proconsul,\" rejoined Chauvelin in\nhis blandest manner. \"Surely you are not going to let the English spies\nescape this time? And if you succeed in laying them by the heels--there\nwhere every one else has failed--you will have earned twenty thousand\nfrancs and the thanks of the entire Committee of Public Safety.\"\n\nHe paused: and young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt interposed with his impudent laugh:\n\n\"Go on, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said, \"if there is twenty thousand francs\nto be made out of this game, I'll warrant that the proconsul will take a\nhand in it--eh, Carrier?\"\n\nAnd with the insolent familiarity of a terrier teasing a grizzly he\ntweaked the great man's ear.\n\nChauvelin in the meanwhile had drawn the packet of papers from his\npocket and untied the ribbon that held them together. He now spread the\npapers out on the desk.\n\n\"What are these?\" queried Carrier.\n\n\"A few papers,\" replied Chauvelin, \"which one of your Marats, Paul\nFriche by name, picked up in the wake of the Englishmen. I caught sight\nof them in the far distance, and sent the Marats after them. For awhile\nPaul Friche kept on their track, but after that they disappeared in the\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Who were the senseless louts,\" growled Carrier, \"who allowed a pack of\nforeign assassins to escape? I'll soon make them disappear ... in the\nLoire.\"\n\n\"You will do what you like about that, citizen Carrier,\" retorted\nChauvelin drily; \"in the meanwhile you would do well to examine these\npapers.\"\n\nHe sorted these out, examined them one by one, then passed them across\nto Carrier. Lalou\u00c3\u00abt, impudent and inquisitive, sat on the corner of the\ndesk, dangling his legs. With scant ceremony he snatched one paper after\nanother out of Carrier's hands and examined them curiously.\n\n\"Can you understand all this gibberish?\" he asked airily. \"Jean\nBaptiste, my friend, how much English do you know?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" replied the proconsul, \"but enough to recognise that\nabominable doggrel rhyme which has gone the round of the Committees of\nPublic Safety throughout the country.\"\n\n\"I know it by heart,\" rejoined young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt. \"I was in Paris once, when\ncitizen Robespierre received a copy of it. Name of a dog!\" added the\nyoungster with a coarse laugh, \"how he cursed!\"\n\nIt is doubtful however if citizen Robespierre did on that occasion curse\nquite so volubly as Carrier did now.\n\n\"If I only knew why that _satan\u00c3\u00a9_ Englishman throws so much calligraphy\nabout,\" he said, \"I would be easier in my mind. Now this senseless rhyme\n... I don't see....\"\n\n\"Its importance?\" broke in Chauvelin quietly. \"I dare say not. On the\nface of it, it appears foolish and childish: but it is intended as a\ntaunt and is really a poor attempt at humour. They are a queer people\nthese English. If you knew them as I do, you would not be surprised to\nsee a man scribbling off a cheap joke before embarking on an enterprise\nwhich may cost him his head.\"\n\n\"And this inane rubbish is of that sort,\" concluded young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt. And\nin his thin high treble he began reciting:\n\n       \"We seek him here;\n       We seek him there!\n   Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.\n       Is he in heaven?\n       Is he in h----ll?\n   That demmed elusive Pimpernel?\"\n\n\"Pointless and offensive,\" he said as he tossed the paper back on the\ntable.\n\n\"A cursed aristo that Englishman of yours,\" growled Carrier. \"Oh! when I\nget him....\"\n\nHe made an expressive gesture which made Lalou\u00c3\u00abt laugh.\n\n\"What else have we got in the way of documents, citizen Chauvelin?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"There is a letter,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"Read it,\" commanded Carrier. \"Or rather translate it as you read. I\ndon't understand the whole of the gibberish.\"\n\nAnd Chauvelin, taking up a sheet of paper which was covered with neat,\nminute writing, began to read aloud, translating the English into French\nas he went along:\n\n     \"'Here we are at last, my dear Tony! Didn't I tell you that we can\n     get in anywhere despite all precautions taken against us!'\"\n\n\"The impudent devils!\" broke in Carrier.\n\n     --\"'Did you really think that they could keep us out of Nantes\n     while Lady Anthony Dewhurst is a prisoner in their hands?'\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"The Kernogan woman. As I told you just now, she is married to an\nEnglishman who is named Dewhurst and who is one of the members of that\nthrice cursed League.\"\n\nThen he continued to read:\n\n     \"'And did you really suppose that they would spot half a dozen\n     English gentlemen in the guise of peat-gatherers, returning at dusk\n     and covered with grime from their work? Not like, friend Tony! Not\n     like! If you happen to meet mine engaging friend M. Chambertin\n     before I have that privilege myself, tell him I pray you, with my\n     regards, that I am looking forward to the pleasure of making a long\n     nose at him once more. Calais, Boulogne, Paris--now Nantes--the\n     scenes of his triumphs multiply exceedingly.'\"\n\n\"What in the devil's name does all this mean?\" queried Carrier with an\noath.\n\n\"You don't understand it?\" rejoined Chauvelin quietly.\n\n\"No. I do not.\"\n\n\"Yet I translated quite clearly.\"\n\n\"It is not the language that puzzles me. The contents seem to me such\ndrivel. The man wants secrecy, what? He is supposed to be astute,\nresourceful, above all mysterious and enigmatic. Yet he writes to his\nfriend--matter of no importance between them, recollections of the past,\nknown to them both--and threats for the future, equally futile and\nsenseless. I cannot reconcile it all. It puzzles me.\"\n\n\"And it would puzzle me,\" rejoined Chauvelin, while the ghost of a smile\ncurled his thin lips, \"did I not know the man. Futile? Senseless, you\nsay? Well, he does futile and senseless things one moment and amazing\ndeeds of personal bravery and of astuteness the next. He is three parts\na braggart too. He wanted you, me--all of us to know how he and his\nfollowers succeeded in eluding our vigilance and entered our\nclosely-guarded city in the guise of grimy peat-gatherers. Now I come to\nthink of it, it was easy enough for them to do that. Those\npeat-gatherers who live inside the city boundaries return from their\nwork as the night falls in. Those cursed English adventurers are passing\nclever at disguise--they are born mountebanks the lot of them. Money and\nimpudence they have in plenty. They could easily borrow or purchase some\nfilthy rags from the cottages on the dunes, then mix with the crowd on\nits return to the city. I dare say it was cleverly done. That Scarlet\nPimpernel is just a clever adventurer and nothing more. So far his\nmarvellous good luck has carried him through. Now we shall see.\"\n\nCarrier had listened in silence. Something of his colleague's calm had\nby this time communicated itself to him too. He was no longer raving\nlike an infuriated bull--his terror no longer made a half-cringing,\nwholly savage brute of him. He was sprawling across the desk--his arms\nfolded, his deep-set eyes studying closely the well-nigh inscrutable\nface of Chauvelin. Young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt too had lost something of his\nimpudence. That mysterious spell which seemed to emanate from the\nelusive personality of the bold English adventurer had been cast over\nthese two callous, bestial natures, humbling their arrogance and making\nthem feel that here was no ordinary situation to be dealt with by\nsmashing, senseless hitting and the spilling of innocent blood. Both\nfelt instinctively too that this man Chauvelin, however wholly he may\nhave failed in the past, was nevertheless still the only man who might\ngrapple successfully with the elusive and adventurous foe.\n\n\"Are you assuming, citizen Chauvelin,\" queried Carrier after awhile,\n\"that this packet of papers was dropped purposely by the Englishman, so\nthat it might get into our hands?\"\n\n\"There is always such a possibility,\" replied Chauvelin drily. \"With\nthat type of man one must be prepared to meet the unexpected.\"\n\n\"Then go on, citizen Chauvelin. What else is there among those _satan\u00c3\u00a9_\npapers?\"\n\n\"Nothing further of importance. There is a map of Nantes, and one of the\ncoast and of Le Croisic. There is a cutting from _Le Moniteur_ dated\nlast September, and one from the _London Gazette_ dated three years ago.\nThe _Moniteur_ makes reference to the production of _Athalie_ at the\nTh\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Moli\u00c3\u00a8re, and the _London Gazette_ to the sale of fat cattle at\nan Agricultural Show. There is a receipted account from a London tailor\nfor two hundred pounds' worth of clothes supplied, and one from a Lyons\nmercer for an hundred francs worth of silk cravats. Then there is the\none letter which alone amidst all this rubbish appears to be of any\nconsequence....\"\n\nHe took up the last paper; his hand was still quite steady.\n\n\"Read the letter,\" said Carrier.\n\n\"It is addressed in the English fashion to Lady Anthony Dewhurst,\"\ncontinued Chauvelin slowly, \"the Kernogan woman, you know, citizen. It\nsays:\n\n     \"'Keep up your courage. Your friends are inside the city and on the\n     watch. Try the door of your prison every evening at one hour before\n     midnight. Once you will find it yield. Slip out and creep\n     noiselessly down the stairs. At the bottom a friendly hand will be\n     stretched out to you. Take it with confidence--it will lead you to\n     safety and to freedom. Courage and secrecy.'\"\n\nLalou\u00c3\u00abt had been looking over his shoulder while he read: now he pointed\nto the bottom of the letter.\n\n\"And there is the device,\" he said, \"we have heard so much about of\nlate--a five-petalled flower drawn in red ink ... the Scarlet Pimpernel,\nI presume.\"\n\n\"Aye! the Scarlet Pimpernel,\" murmured Chauvelin, \"as you say!\nBraggadocio on his part or accident, his letters are certainly in our\nhands now and will prove--must prove, the tool whereby we can be even\nwith him once and for all.\"\n\n\"And you, citizen Chauvelin,\" interposed Carrier with a sneer, \"are\nmighty lucky to have me to help you this time. I am not going to be\nfooled, as Candeille and you were fooled last September, as you were\nfooled in Calais and H\u00c3\u00a9ron in Paris. I shall be seeing this time to the\ncapture of those English adventurers.\"\n\n\"And that capture should not be difficult,\" added Lalou\u00c3\u00abt with a\ncomplacent laugh. \"Your famous adventurer's luck hath deserted him this\ntime: an all-powerful proconsul is pitted against him and the loss of\nhis papers hath destroyed the anonymity on which he reckons.\"\n\nChauvelin paid no heed to the fatuous remarks.\n\nHow little did this flippant young braggart and this coarse-grained\nbully understand the subtle workings of that same adventurer's brain! He\nhimself--one of the most astute men of the day--found it difficult. Even\nnow--the losing of those letters in the open streets of Nantes--it was\npart of a plan. Chauvelin could have staked his head on that--a part of\na plan for the liberation of Lady Anthony Dewhurst--but what plan?--what\nplan?\n\nHe took up the letter which his colleague had thrown down: he fingered\nit, handled it, letting the paper crackle through his fingers, as if he\nexpected it to yield up the secret which it contained. The time had\ncome--of that he felt no doubt--when he could at last be even with his\nenemy. He had endured more bitter humiliation at the hands of this\nelusive Pimpernel than he would have thought himself capable of bearing\na couple of years ago. But the time had come at last--if only he kept\nhis every faculty on the alert, if Fate helped him and his own nerves\nstood the strain. Above all if this blundering, self-satisfied Carrier\ncould be reckoned on!...\n\nThere lay the one great source of trouble! He--Chauvelin--had no power:\nhe was disgraced--a failure--a nonentity to be sneered at. He might\nprotest, entreat, wring his hands, weep tears of blood and not one man\nwould stir a finger to help him: this brute who sprawled here across his\ndesk would not lend him half a dozen men to enable him to lay by the\nheels the most powerful enemy the Government of the Terror had ever\nknown. Chauvelin inwardly ground his teeth with rage at his own\nimpotence, at his own dependence on this clumsy lout, who was at this\nmoment possessed of powers which he himself would give half his life to\nobtain.\n\nBut on the other hand he did possess a power which no one could take\nfrom him--the power to use others for the furtherance of his own\naims--to efface himself while others danced as puppets to his piping.\nCarrier had the power: he had spies, Marats, prison-guards at his\ndisposal. He was greedy for the reward, and cupidity and fear would make\nof him a willing instrument. All that Chauvelin need do was to use that\ninstrument for his own ends. One would be the head to direct, the\nother--a mere insentient tool.\n\nFrom this moment onwards every minute, every second and every fraction\nof a second would be full of portent, full of possibilities. Sir Percy\nBlakeney was in Nantes with at least three or four members of his\nLeague: he was at this very moment taxing every fibre of his\nresourceful brain in order to devise a means whereby he could rescue\nhis friend's wife from the fate which was awaiting her: to gain this end\nhe would dare everything, risk everything--risk and dare a great deal\nmore than he had ever dared and risked before.\n\nChauvelin was finding a grim pleasure in reviewing the situation, in\nenvisaging the danger of failure which he knew lay in wait for him,\nunless he too was able to call to his aid all the astuteness, all the\ndaring, all the resource of his own fertile brain. He studied his\ncolleague's face keenly--that sullen, savage expression in it, the\narrogance, the blundering vanity. It was terrible to have to humour and\nfawn to a creature of that stamp when all one's hopes, all one's future,\none's ideals and the welfare of one's country were at stake.\n\nBut this additional difficulty only served to whet the man's appetite\nfor action. He drew in a long breath of delight, like a captive who\nfirst after many days and months of weary anguish scents freedom and\nozone. He straightened out his shoulders. A gleam of triumph and of hope\nshot out of his keen pale eyes. He studied Carrier and he studied\nLalou\u00c3\u00abt and he felt that he could master them both--quietly,\ndiplomatically, with subtle skill that would not alarm the proconsul's\nrampant self-esteem: and whilst this coarse-fibred brute gloated in\nanticipatory pleasure over the handling of a few thousand francs, and\nwhilst Martin-Roget dreamed of a clumsy revenge against one woman and\none man who had wronged him four years ago, he--Chauvelin--would pursue\nhis work of striking at the enemy of the Revolution--of bringing to his\nknees the man who spent life and fortune in combating its ideals and in\nfrustrating its aims. The destruction of such a foe was worthy a\npatriot's ambition.\n\nOn the other hand some of Carrier's bullying arrogance had gone. He was\nterrified to the very depths of his cowardly heart, and for once he was\nturning away from his favourite Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt and inclined to lean on\nChauvelin for advice. Robespierre had been known to tremble at sight of\nthat small scarlet device, how much more had he--Carrier--cause to be\nafraid. He knew his own limitations and he was terrified of the\nassassin's dagger. As Marat had perished, so he too might end his days,\nand the English spies were credited with murderous intentions and\nsuperhuman power. In his innermost self Carrier knew that despite\ncountless failures Chauvelin was mentally his superior, and though he\nnever would own to this and at this moment did not attempt to shed his\nover-bearing manner, he was watching the other keenly and anxiously,\nready to follow the guidance of an intellect stronger than his own.\n\n\nIII\n\nAt last Carrier elected to speak.\n\n\"And now, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said, \"we know how we stand. We know\nthat the English assassins are in Nantes. The question is how are we\ngoing to lay them by the heels.\"\n\nChauvelin gave him no direct reply. He was busy collecting his precious\npapers together and thrusting them back into the pocket of his coat.\nThen he said quietly:\n\n\"It is through the Kernogan woman that we can get hold of him.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Where she is, there will the Englishmen be. They are in Nantes for the\nsole purpose of getting the woman and her father out of your\nclutches....\"\n\n\"Then it will be a fine haul inside the Rat Mort,\" ejaculated Carrier\nwith a chuckle. \"Eh, Jacques, you young scamp? You and I must go and see\nthat, what? You have been complaining that life was getting monotonous.\nDrownages--Republican marriages! They have all palled in their turn on\nyour jaded appetite.... But the capture of the English assassins, eh?...\nof that League of the Scarlet Pimpernel which has even caused citizen\nRobespierre much uneasiness--that will stir up your sluggish blood, you\nlazy young vermin!... Go on, go on, citizen Chauvelin, I am vastly\ninterested!\"\n\nHe rubbed his dry, bony hands together and cackled with glee. Chauvelin\ninterposed quietly:\n\n\"Inside the Rat Mort, eh, citizen?\" he queried.\n\n\"Why, yes. Citizen Martin-Roget means to convey the Kernogan woman to\nthe Rat Mort, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"He does.\"\n\n\"And you say that where the Kernogan woman is there the Englishmen will\nbe....\"\n\n\"The inference is obvious.\"\n\n\"Which means ten thousand francs from that fool Martin-Roget for having\nthe wench and her father arrested inside the Rat Mort! and twenty\nthousand for the capture of the English spies.... Have you forgotten,\ncitizen Chauvelin,\" he added with a raucous cry of triumph, \"that\ncommandant Fleury has my orders to make a raid on the Rat Mort this\nnight with half a company of my Marats, and to arrest every one whom\nthey find inside?\"\n\n\"The Kernogan wench is not at the Rat Mort yet,\" quoth Chauvelin drily,\n\"and you have refused to lend a hand in having her conveyed thither.\"\n\n\"I can't do it, my little Chauvelin,\" rejoined Carrier, somewhat sobered\nby this reminder. \"I can't do it ... you understand ... my Marats\ntaking an aristo to a house of ill-fame where presently I have her\narrested ... it won't do ... it won't do ... you don't know how I am\nspied upon just now.... It really would not do.... I can't be mixed up\nin that part of the affair. The wench must go to the Rat Mort of her own\nfree will, or the whole plan falls to the ground.... That fool\nMartin-Roget must think of a way ... it's his affair, after all. He must\nsee to it.... Or you can think of a way,\" he added, assuming the coaxing\nways of a tiger-cat; \"you are so clever, my little Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Chauvelin quietly, \"I can think of a way. The Kernogan\nwench shall leave the house of citizeness Adet and walk into the tavern\nof the Rat Mort of her own free will. Your reputation, citizen Carrier,\"\nhe added without the slightest apparent trace of a sneer, \"your\nreputation shall be safeguarded in this matter. But supposing that in\nthe interval of going from the one house to the other the English\nadventurer succeeds in kidnapping her....\"\n\n\"Pah! is that likely?\" quoth Carrier with a shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"Exceedingly likely, citizen; and you would not doubt it if you knew\nthis Scarlet Pimpernel as I do. I have seen him at his nefarious work. I\nknow what he can do. There is nothing that he would not venture ...\nthere are few ventures in which he does not succeed. He is as strong as\nan ox, as agile as a cat. He can see in the dark and he can always\nvanish in a crowd. Here, there and everywhere, you never know where he\nwill appear. He is a past master in the art of disguise and he is a born\nmountebank. Believe me, citizen, we shall want all the resources of our\njoint intellects to frustrate the machinations of such a foe.\"\n\nCarrier mused for a moment in silence.\n\n\"H'm!\" he said after awhile, and with a sardonic laugh. \"You may be\nright, citizen Chauvelin. You have had experience with the rascal ...\nyou ought to know him. We won't leave anything to chance--don't be\nafraid of that. My Marats will be keen on the capture. We'll promise\ncommandant Fleury a thousand francs for himself and another thousand to\nbe distributed among his men if we lay hands on the English assassins\nto-night. We'll leave nothing to chance,\" he reiterated with an oath.\n\n\"In which case, citizen Carrier, you must on your side agree to two\nthings,\" rejoined Chauvelin firmly.\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"You must order Commandant Fleury to place himself and half a company of\nhis Marats at my disposal.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"You must allow them to lend a hand if there is an attempt to kidnap the\nKernogan wench while she is being conveyed to the Rat Mort....\"\n\nCarrier hesitated for a second or two, but only for form's sake: it was\nhis nature whenever he was forced to yield to do so grudgingly.\n\n\"Very well!\" he said at last. \"I'll order Fleury to be on the watch and\nto interfere if there is any street-brawling outside or near the Rat\nMort. Will that suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. I shall be on the watch too--somewhere close by.... I'll\nwarn commandant Fleury if I suspect that the English are making ready\nfor a coup outside the tavern. Personally I think it unlikely--because\nthe duc de Kernogan will be inside the Rat Mort all the time, and he too\nwill be the object of the Englishmen's attacks on his behalf. Citizen\nMartin-Roget too has about a score or so of his friends posted outside\nhis sister's house: they are lads from his village who hate the\nKernogans as much as he does himself. Still! I shall feel easier in my\nmind now that I am certain of commandant Fleury's co-operation.\"\n\n\"Then it seems to me that we have arranged everything satisfactorily,\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Everything, except the exact moment when Commandant Fleury shall\nadvance with his men to the door of the tavern and demand admittance in\nthe name of the Republic.\"\n\n\"Yes, he will have to make quite sure that the whole of our quarry is\ninside the net, eh?... before he draws the strings ... or all our pretty\nplans fall to nought.\"\n\n\"As you say,\" rejoined Chauvelin, \"we must make sure. Supposing\ntherefore that we get the wench safely into the tavern, that we have her\nthere with her father, what we shall want will be some one in\nobservation--some one who can help us to draw our birds into the snare\njust when we are ready for them. Now there is a man whom I have in my\nmind: he hath name Paul Friche and is one of your Marats--a surly,\nill-conditioned giant ... he was on guard outside Le Bouffay this\nafternoon.... I spoke to him ... he would suit our purpose admirably.\"\n\n\"What do you want him to do?\"\n\n\"Only to make himself look as like a Nantese cut-throat as he can....\"\n\n\"He looks like one already,\" broke in Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt with a laugh.\n\n\"So much the better. He'll excite no suspicion in that case in the minds\nof the frequenters of the Rat Mort. Then I'll instruct him to start a\nbrawl--a fracas--soon after the arrival of the Kernogan wench. The row\nwill inevitably draw the English adventurers hot-haste to the spot,\neither in the hope of getting the Kernogans away during the _m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e_ or\nwith a view to protecting them. As soon as they have appeared upon the\nscene, the half company of the Marats will descend on the house and\narrest every one inside it.\"\n\n\"It all sounds remarkably simple,\" rejoined Carrier, and with a leer of\nsatisfaction he turned to Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt.\n\n\"What think you of it, citizen?\" he asked.\n\n\"That it sounds so remarkably simple,\" replied young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt, \"that\npersonally I should be half afraid....\"\n\n\"Of what?\" queried Chauvelin blandly.\n\n\"If you fail, citizen Chauvelin....\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"If the Englishmen do not appear?\"\n\n\"Even so the citizen proconsul will have lost nothing. He will merely\nhave failed to gain the twenty thousand francs. But the Kernogans will\nstill be in his power and citizen Martin-Roget's ten thousand francs are\nin any case assured.\"\n\n\"Friend Jean-Baptiste,\" concluded Lalou\u00c3\u00abt with his habitual insolent\nfamiliarity, \"you had better do what citizen Chauvelin wants. Ten\nthousand francs are good ... and thirty better still. Our privy purse\nhas been empty far too long, and I for one would like the handling of a\nfew brisk notes.\"\n\n\"It will only be twenty-eight, citizen Lalou\u00c3\u00abt,\" interposed Chauvelin\nblandly, \"for commandant Fleury will want one thousand francs and his\nmen another thousand to stimulate their zeal. Still! I imagine that\nthese hard times twenty-eight thousand francs are worth fighting for.\"\n\n\"You seem to be fighting and planning and scheming for nothing, citizen\nChauvelin,\" retorted young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt with a sneer. \"What are you going to\ngain, I should like to know, by the capture of that dare-devil\nEnglishman?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Chauvelin suavely, \"I shall gain the citizen proconsul's\nregard, I hope--and yours too, citizen Lalou\u00c3\u00abt. I want nothing more\nexcept the success of my plan.\"\n\nYoung Lalou\u00c3\u00abt jumped down to his feet. He shrugged his shoulders and\nthrough his fine eyes shot a glance of mockery and scorn on the thin,\nshrunken figure of the Terrorist.\n\n\"How you do hate that Englishman, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said with a\nlight laugh.\n\n\nIV\n\nCarrier having fully realised that he in any case stood to make a vast\nsum of money out of the capture of the band of English spies, gave his\nsupport generously to Chauvelin's scheme. Fleury, summoned into his\npresence, was ordered to place himself and half a company of Marats at\nthe disposal of citizen Chauvelin. He demurred and growled like a bear\nwith a sore head at being placed under the orders of a civilian, but it\nwas not easy to run counter to the proconsul's will. A good deal of\nswearing, one or two overt threats and the citizen commandant was\nreduced to submission. The promise of a thousand francs, when the reward\nfor the capture of the English spies was paid out by a grateful\nGovernment, overcame his last objections.\n\n\"I think you should rid yourself of that obstinate oaf,\" was young\nLalou\u00c3\u00abt's cynical comment, when Fleury had finally left the audience\nchamber; \"he is too argumentative for my taste.\"\n\nChauvelin smiled quietly to himself. He cared little what became of\nevery one of these Nantese louts once his great object had been\nattained.\n\n\"I need not trouble you further, citizen Carrier,\" he said as he finally\nrose to take his leave. \"I shall have my hands full until I myself lay\nthat meddlesome Englishman bound and gagged at your feet.\"\n\nThe phrase delighted Carrier's insensate vanity. He was overgracious to\nChauvelin now.\n\n\"You shall do that at the Rat Mort, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said with\nmarked affability, \"and I myself will commend you for your zeal to the\nCommittee of Public Safety.\"\n\n\"Always supposing,\" interposed Jacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt with his cynical laugh,\n\"that citizen Chauvelin does not let the whole rabble slip through his\nfingers.\"\n\n\"If I do,\" concluded Chauvelin drily, \"you may drag the Loire for my\nbody to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" laughed Carrier, \"we won't trouble to do that. _Au revoir_,\ncitizen Chauvelin,\" he added with one of his grandiloquent gestures of\ndismissal, \"I wish you luck at the Rat Mort to-night.\"\n\nJacques Lalou\u00c3\u00abt ushered Chauvelin out. When he was finally left standing\nalone at the head of the stairs and young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt's footsteps had ceased\nto resound across the floors of the rooms beyond, he remained quite\nstill for awhile, his eyes fixed into vacancy, his face set and\nexpressionless; and through his lips there came a long-drawn-out sigh of\nintense satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my fine Scarlet Pimpernel,\" he murmured softly, \"once more _\u00c3\u00a0\nnous deux_.\"\n\nThen he ran swiftly down the stairs and a moment later was once more\nspeeding toward Le Bouffay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MESSAGE OF HOPE\n\n\nI\n\nAfter Martin-Roget and Chauvelin had left her, Yvonne had sat for a long\ntime motionless, almost unconscious. It seemed as if gradually, hour by\nhour, minute by minute, her every feeling of courage and of hope were\ndeserting her. Three days now she had been separated from her\nfather--three days she had been under the constant supervision of a\nwoman who had not a single thought of compassion or of mercy for the\n\"aristocrat\" whom she hated so bitterly.\n\nAt night, curled up on a small bundle of dank straw Yvonne had made vain\nefforts to snatch a little sleep. Ever since the day when she had been\nruthlessly torn away from the protection of her dear milor, she had\npersistently clung to the belief that he would find the means to come to\nher, to wrest her from the cruel fate which her pitiless enemies had\ndevised for her. She had clung to that hope throughout that dreary\njourney from dear England to this abominable city. She had clung to it\neven whilst her father knelt at her feet in an agony of remorse. She had\nclung to hope while Martin-Roget alternately coaxed and terrorised her,\nwhile her father was dragged away from her, while she endured untold\nmisery, starvation, humiliation at the hands of Louise Adet: but\nnow--quite unaccountably--that hope seemed suddenly to have fled from\nher, leaving her lonely and inexpressibly desolate. That small,\nshrunken figure which, wrapped in a dark mantle, had stood in the corner\nof the room watching her like a serpent watches its prey, had seemed\nlike the forerunner of the fate with which Martin-Roget, gloating over\nher helplessness, had already threatened her.\n\nShe knew, of course, that neither from him, nor from the callous brute\nwho governed Nantes, could she expect the slightest justice or mercy.\nShe had been brought here by Martin-Roget not only to die, but to suffer\ngrievously at his hands in return for a crime for which she personally\nwas in no way responsible. To hope for mercy from him at the eleventh\nhour were worse than futile. Her already overburdened heart ached at\nthought of her father: he suffered all that she suffered, and in\naddition he must be tortured with anxiety for her and with remorse.\nSometimes she was afraid that under the stress of desperate soul-agony\nhe might perhaps have been led to suicide. She knew nothing of what had\nhappened to him, where he was, nor whether privations and lack of food\nor sleep, together with Martin-Roget's threats, had by now weakened his\nmorale and turned his pride into humiliating submission.\n\n\nII\n\nA distant tower-clock struck the evening hours one after the other.\nYvonne for the past three days had only been vaguely conscious of time.\nMartin-Roget had spoken of a few hours' respite only, of the proconsul's\ndesire to be soon rid of her. Well! this meant no doubt that the morrow\nwould see the end of it all--the end of her life which such a brief\nwhile ago seemed so full of delight, of love and of happiness.\n\nThe end of her life! She had hardly begun to live and her dear milor had\nwhispered to her such sweet promises of endless vistas of bliss.\n\nYvonne shivered beneath her thin gown. The north-westerly blast came in\ncruel gusts through the unglazed window and a vague instinct of\nself-preservation caused Yvonne to seek shelter in the one corner of the\nroom where the icy draught did not penetrate quite so freely.\n\nEight, nine and ten struck from the tower-clock far away: she heard\nthese sounds as in a dream. Tired, cold and hungry her vitality at that\nmoment was at its lowest ebb--and, with her back resting against the\nwall she fell presently into a torpor-like sleep.\n\nSuddenly something roused her, and in an instant she sat up--wide-awake\nand wide-eyed, every one of her senses conscious and on the alert.\nSomething had roused her--at first she could not say what it was--or\nremember. Then presently individual sounds detached themselves from the\nbuzzing in her ears. Hitherto the house had always been so still; except\non the isolated occasions when Martin-Roget had come to visit her and\nhis heavy tread had caused every loose board in the tumble-down house to\ncreak, it was only Louise Adet's shuffling footsteps which had roused\nthe dormant echoes, when she crept upstairs either to her own room, or\nto throw a piece of stale bread to her prisoner.\n\nBut now--it was neither Martin-Roget's heavy footfall nor the shuffling\ngait of Louise Adet which had roused Yvonne from her trance-like sleep.\nIt was a gentle, soft, creeping step which was slowly, cautiously\nmounting the stairs. Yvonne crouching against the wall could count every\ntread--now and then a board creaked--now and then the footsteps halted.\n\nYvonne, wide-eyed, her heart stirred by a nameless terror was watching\nthe door.\n\nThe piece of tallow-candle flickered in the draught. Its feeble light\njust touched the remote corner of the room. And Yvonne heard those soft,\ncreeping footsteps as they reached the landing and came to a halt\noutside the door.\n\nEvery drop of blood in her seemed to be frozen by terror: her knees\nshook: her heart almost stopped its beating.\n\nUnder the door something small and white had just been introduced--a\nscrap of paper; and there it remained--white against the darkness of the\nunwashed boards--a mysterious message left here by an unknown hand,\nwhilst the unknown footsteps softly crept down the stairs again.\n\nFor awhile longer Yvonne remained as she was--cowering against the\nwall--like a timid little animal, fearful lest that innocent-looking\nobject hid some unthought-of danger. Then at last she gathered courage.\nTrembling with excitement she raised herself to her knees and then on\nhands and knees--for she was very weak and faint--she crawled up to that\nmysterious piece of paper and picked it up.\n\nHer trembling hand closed over it. With wide staring terror-filled eyes\nshe looked all round the narrow room, ere she dared cast one more glance\non that mysterious scrap of paper. Then she struggled to her feet and\ntottered up to the table. She sat down and with fingers numbed with cold\nshe smoothed out the paper and held it close to the light, trying to\nread what was written on it.\n\nHer sight was blurred. She had to pull herself resolutely together, for\nsuddenly she felt ashamed of her weakness and her overwhelming terror\nyielded to feverish excitement.\n\nThe scrap of paper contained a message--a message addressed to her in\nthat name of which she was so proud--the name which she thought she\nwould never be allowed to bear again: Lady Anthony Dewhurst. She\nreiterated the words several times, her lips clinging lovingly to\nthem--and just below them there was a small device, drawn in red ink ...\na tiny flower with five petals....\n\nYvonne frowned and murmured, vaguely puzzled--no longer frightened now:\n\"A flower ... drawn in red ... what can it mean?\"\n\nAnd as a vague memory struggled for expression in her troubled mind she\nadded half aloud: \"Oh! if it should be ...!\"\n\nBut now suddenly all her fears fell away from her. Hope was once more\nknocking at the gates of her heart--vague memories had taken definite\nshape ... the mysterious letter ... the message of hope ... the red\nflower ... all were gaining significance. She stooped low to read the\nletter by the feeble light of the flickering candle. She read it through\nwith her eyes first--then with her lips in a soft murmur, while her mind\ngradually took in all that it meant for her.\n\n     \"Keep up your courage. Your friends are inside the city and on the\n     watch. Try the door of your prison every evening at one hour before\n     midnight. Once you will find it yield. Slip out and creep\n     noiselessly down the stairs. At the bottom a friendly hand will be\n     stretched out for you. Take it with confidence--it will lead you to\n     safety and to freedom. Courage and secrecy.\"\n\nWhen she had finished reading, her eyes were swimming in tears. There\nwas no longer any doubt in her mind about the message now, for her dear\nmilor had so often spoken to her about the brave Scarlet Pimpernel who\nhad risked his precious life many a time ere this, in order to render\nservice to the innocent and the oppressed. And now, of a surety, this\nmessage came from him: from her dear milor and from his gallant chief.\nThere was the small device--the little red flower which had so often\nbrought hope to despairing hearts. And it was more than hope that it\nbrought to Yvonne. It brought certitude and happiness, and a sweet,\ntender remorse that she should ever have doubted. She ought to have\nknown all along that everything would be for the best: she had no right\never to have given way to despair. In her heart she prayed for\nforgiveness from her dear absent milor.\n\nHow could she ever doubt him? Was it likely that he would abandon\nher?--he and that brave friend of his whose powers were indeed magical.\nWhy! she ought to have done her best to keep up her physical as well as\nher mental faculties--who knows? But perhaps physical strength might be\nof inestimable value both to herself and to her gallant rescuers\npresently.\n\nShe took up the stale brown bread and ate it resolutely. She drank some\nwater and then stamped round the room to get some warmth into her limbs.\n\nA distant clock had struck ten awhile ago--and if possible she ought to\nget an hour's rest before the time came for her to be strong and to act:\nso she shook up her meagre straw paillasse and lay down, determined if\npossible to get a little sleep--for indeed she felt that that was just\nwhat her dear milor would have wished her to do.\n\nThus time went by--waking or dreaming, Yvonne could never afterwards\nhave said in what state she waited during that one long hour which\nseparated her from the great, blissful moment. The bit of candle burnt\nlow and presently died out. After that Yvonne remained quite still upon\nthe straw, in total darkness: no light came in through the tiny window,\nonly the cold north-westerly wind blew in in gusts. But of a surety the\nprisoner who was within sight of freedom felt neither cold nor fatigue\nnow.\n\nThe tower-clock in the distance struck the quarters with dreary\nmonotony.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe last stroke of eleven ceased to vibrate through the stillness of the\nwinter's night.\n\nYvonne roused herself from the torpor-like state into which she had\nfallen. She tried to struggle to her feet, but intensity of excitement\nhad caused a strange numbness to invade her limbs. She could hardly\nmove. A second or two ago it had seemed to her that she heard a gentle\nscraping noise at the door--a drawing of bolts--the grating of a key in\nthe lock--then again, soft, shuffling footsteps that came and went and\nthat were not those of Louise Adet.\n\nAt last Yvonne contrived to stand on her feet; but she had to close her\neyes and to remain quite still for awhile after that, for her ears were\nbuzzing and her head swimming: she thought that she must fall if she\nmoved and mayhap lose consciousness.\n\nBut this state of weakness only lasted a few seconds: the next she had\ngroped her way to the door and her hand had found the iron latch. It\nyielded. Then she waited, calling up all her strength--for the hour had\ncome wherein she must not only think and act for herself, but think of\nevery possibility which might occur, and act as she imagined her dear\nlord would require it of her.\n\nShe pressed the clumsy iron latch further: it yielded again, and anon\nshe was able to push open the door.\n\nExcited yet confident she tip-toed out of the room. The darkness--like\nunto pitch--was terribly disconcerting. With the exception of her narrow\nprison Yvonne had only once seen the interior of the house and that was\nwhen, half fainting, she had been dragged across its threshold and up\nthe stairs. She had therefore only a very vague idea as to where the\nstairs lay and how she was to get about without stumbling.\n\nSlowly and cautiously she crept a few paces forward, then she turned and\ncarefully closed the door behind her. There was not a sound inside the\nhouse: everything was silent around her: neither footfall nor\nwhisperings reached her straining ears. She felt about her with her\nhands, she crouched down on her knees: anon she discovered the head of\nthe stairs.\n\nThen suddenly she drew back, like a frightened hare conscious of danger.\nAll the blood rushed back to her heart, making it beat so violently that\nshe once more felt sick and faint. A sound--gentle as a breath--had\nbroken that absolute and dead silence which up to now had given her\nconfidence. She felt suddenly that she was no longer alone in the\ndarkness--that somewhere close by there was some one--friend or foe--who\nwas lying in watch for her--that somewhere in the darkness something\nmoved and breathed.\n\nThe crackling of the paper inside her kerchief served to remind her that\nher dear milor was on the watch and that the blessed message had spoken\nof a friendly hand which would be stretched out to her and which she was\nenjoined to take with confidence. Reassured she crept on again, and anon\na softly murmured: \"Hush--sh!--sh!--\" reached her ear. It seemed to\ncome from down below--not very far--and Yvonne, having once more located\nthe head of the stairs with her hands, began slowly to creep\ndownstairs--softly as a mouse--step by step--but every time that a board\ncreaked she paused, terrified, listening for Louise Adet's heavy\nfootstep, for a sound that would mean the near approach of danger.\n\n\"Hush--sh--sh\" came again as a gentle murmur from below and the\nsomething that moved and breathed in the darkness seemed to draw nearer\nto Yvonne.\n\nA few more seconds of soul-racking suspense, a few more steps down the\ncreaking stairs and she felt a strong hand laid upon her wrist and heard\na muffled voice whisper in English:\n\n\"All is well! Trust me! Follow me!\"\n\nShe did not recognise the voice, even though there was something vaguely\nfamiliar in its intonation. Yvonne did not pause to conjecture: she had\nbeen made happy by the very sound of the language which stood to her for\nevery word of love she had ever heard: it restored her courage and her\nconfidence in their fullest measure.\n\nObeying the whispered command, Yvonne was content now to follow her\nmysterious guide who had hold of her hand. The stairs were steep and\nwinding--at a turn she perceived a feeble light at their foot down\nbelow. Up against this feeble light the form of her guide was\nsilhouetted in a broad, dark mass. Yvonne could see nothing of him\nbeyond the square outline of his shoulders and that of his sugar-loaf\nhat. Her mind now was thrilled with excitement and her fingers closed\nalmost convulsively round his hand. He led her across Louise Adet's back\nkitchen. It was from here that the feeble light came--from a small oil\nlamp which stood on the centre table. It helped to guide Yvonne and her\nmysterious friend to the bottom of the stairs, then across the kitchen\nto the front door, where again complete darkness reigned. But soon\nYvonne--who was following blindly whithersoever she was led--heard the\nclick of a latch and the grating of a door upon its hinges: a cold\ncurrent of air caught her straight in the face. She could see nothing,\nfor it seemed to be as dark out of doors as in: but she had the\nsensation of that open door, of a threshold to cross, of freedom and\nhappiness beckoning to her straight out of the gloom. Within the next\nsecond or two she would be out of this terrible place, its squalid and\ndank walls would be behind her. On ahead in that thrice welcome\nobscurity her dear milor and his powerful friend were beckoning to her\nto come boldly on--their protecting arms were already stretched out for\nher; it seemed to her excited fancy as if the cold night-wind brought to\nher ears the echo of their endearing words.\n\nShe filled her lungs with the keen winter air: hope, happiness,\nexcitement thrilled her every nerve.\n\n\"A short walk, my lady,\" whispered the guide, still speaking in English;\n\"you are not cold?\"\n\n\"No, no, I am not cold,\" she whispered in reply. \"I am conscious of\nnothing save that I am free.\"\n\n\"And you are not afraid?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed I am not afraid,\" she murmured fervently. \"May God\nreward you, sir, for what you do.\"\n\nAgain there had been that certain something--vaguely familiar--in the\nway the man spoke which for the moment piqued Yvonne's curiosity. She\ndid not, of a truth, know English well enough to detect the very obvious\nforeign intonation; she only felt that sometime in the dim and happy\npast she had heard this man speak. But even this vague sense of\npuzzlement she dismissed very quickly from her mind. Was she not taking\neverything on trust? Indeed hope and confidence had a very firm hold on\nher at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE RAT MORT\n\n\nI\n\nThe guide had stepped out of the house into the street, Yvonne following\nclosely on his heels. The night was very dark and the narrow little\nCarrefour de la Poissonnerie very sparsely lighted. Somewhere overhead\non the right, something groaned and creaked persistently in the wind. A\nlittle further on a street lanthorn was swinging aloft, throwing a small\ncircle of dim, yellowish light on the unpaved street below. By its\nfitful glimmer Yvonne could vaguely perceive the tall figure of her\nguide as he stepped out with noiseless yet firm tread, his shoulder\nbrushing against the side of the nearest house as he kept closely within\nthe shadow of its high wall. The sight of his broad back thrilled her.\nShe had fallen to imagining whether this was not perchance that gallant\nand all-powerful Scarlet Pimpernel himself: the mysterious friend of\nwhom her dear milor so often spoke with an admiration that was akin to\nworship. He too was probably tall and broad--for English gentlemen were\nusually built that way; and Yvonne's over-excited mind went galloping on\nthe wings of fancy, and in her heart she felt that she was glad that she\nhad suffered so much, and then lived through such a glorious moment as\nthis.\n\nNow from the narrow unpaved yard in front of the house the guide turned\nsharply to the right. Yvonne could only distinguish outlines. The\nstreets of Nantes were familiar to her, and she knew pretty well where\nshe was. The lanthorn inside the clock tower of Le Bouffay guided\nher--it was now on her right--the house wherein she had been kept a\nprisoner these past three days was built against the walls of the great\nprison house. She knew that she was in the Carrefour de la Poissonnerie.\n\nShe felt neither fatigue nor cold, for she was wildly excited. The keen\nnorth-westerly wind searched all the weak places in her worn clothing\nand her thin shoes were wet through. But her courage up to this point\nhad never once forsaken her. Hope and the feeling of freedom gave her\nmarvellous strength, and when her guide paused a moment ere he turned\nthe angle of the high wall and whispered hurriedly: \"You have courage,\nmy lady?\" she was able to answer serenely: \"In plenty, sir.\"\n\nShe tried to peer into the darkness in order to realise whither she was\nbeing led. The guide had come to a halt in front of the house which was\nnext to that of Louise Adet: it projected several feet in front of the\nlatter: the thing that had creaked so weirdly in the wind turned out to\nbe a painted sign, which swung out from an iron bracket fixed into the\nwall. Yvonne could not read the writing on the sign, but she noticed\nthat just above it there was a small window dimly lighted from within.\n\nWhat sort of a house it was Yvonne could not, of course, see. The\nfrontage was dark save for narrow streaks of light which peeped through\nthe interstices of the door and through the chinks of ill-fastened\nshutters on either side. Not a sound came from within, but now that the\nguide had come to a halt it seemed to Yvonne--whose nerves and senses\nhad become preternaturally acute--that the whole air around her was\nfilled with muffled sounds, and when she stood still and strained her\nears to listen she was conscious right through the inky blackness of\nvague forms--shapeless and silent--that glided past her in the gloom.\n\n\nII\n\n\"Your friends will meet you here,\" the guide whispered as he pointed to\nthe door of the house in front of him. \"The door is on the latch. Push\nit open and walk in boldly. Then gather up all your courage, for you\nwill find yourself in the company of poor people, whose manners are\nsomewhat rougher than those to which you have been accustomed. But\nthough the people are uncouth, you will find them kind. Above all you\nwill find that they will pay no heed to you. So I entreat you do not be\nafraid. Your friends would have arranged for a more refined place\nwherein to come and find you, but as you may well imagine they had no\nchoice.\"\n\n\"I quite understand, sir,\" said Yvonne quietly, \"and I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's brave!\" he rejoined. \"Then do as I tell you. I give you my\nword that inside that house you will be perfectly safe until such time\nas your friends are able to get to you. You may have to wait an hour, or\neven two; you must have patience. Find a quiet place in one of the\ncorners of the room and sit there quietly, taking no notice of what goes\non around you. You will be quite safe, and the arrival of your friends\nis only a question of time.\"\n\n\"My friends, sir?\" she said earnestly, and her voice shook slightly as\nshe spoke, \"are you not one of the most devoted friends I can ever hope\nto have? I cannot find the words now wherewith to thank you, but....\"\n\n\"I pray you do not thank me,\" he broke in gruffly, \"and do not waste\ntime in parleying. The open street is none too safe a place for you just\nnow. The house is.\"\n\nHis hand was on the latch and he was about to push open the door, when\nYvonne stopped him with a word.\n\n\"My father?\" she whispered with passionate entreaty. \"Will you help him\ntoo?\"\n\n\"M. le duc de Kernogan is as safe as you are, my lady,\" he replied. \"He\nwill join you anon. I pray you have no fears for him. Your friends are\ncaring for him in the same way as they care for you.\"\n\n\"Then I shall see him ... soon?\"\n\n\"Very soon. And in the meanwhile,\" he added, \"I pray you to sit quite\nstill and to wait events ... despite anything you may see or hear. Your\nfather's safety and your own--not to speak of that of your\nfriends--hangs on your quiescence, your silence, your obedience.\"\n\n\"I will remember, sir,\" rejoined Yvonne quietly. \"I in my turn entreat\nyou to have no fears for me.\"\n\nEven while she said this, the man pushed the door open.\n\n\nIII\n\nYvonne had meant to be brave. Above all she had meant to be obedient.\nBut even so, she could not help recoiling at sight of the place where\nshe had just been told she must wait patiently and silently for an hour,\nor even two.\n\nThe room into which her guide now gently urged her forward was large and\nlow, only dimly lighted by an oil-lamp which hung from the ceiling and\nemitted a thin stream of black smoke and evil smell. Such air as there\nwas, was foul and reeked of the fumes of alcohol and charcoal, of the\nsmoking lamp and of rancid grease. The walls had no doubt been\nwhitewashed once, now they were of a dull greyish tint, with here and\nthere hideous stains of red or the marks of a set of greasy fingers. The\nplaster was hanging in strips and lumps from the ceiling; it had fallen\naway in patches from the walls where it displayed the skeleton laths\nbeneath. There were two doors in the wall immediately facing the front\nentrance, and on each side of the latter there was a small window, both\ninsecurely shuttered. To Yvonne the whole place appeared unspeakably\nsqualid and noisome. Even as she entered her ears caught the sound of\nhideous muttered blasphemy, followed by quickly suppressed hoarse and\nmirthless laughter and the piteous cry of an infant at the breast.\n\nThere were perhaps sixteen to twenty people in the room--amongst them a\ngoodly number of women, some of whom had tiny, miserable atoms of\nhumanity clinging to their ragged skirts. A group of men in tattered\nshirts, bare shins and sabots stood in the centre of the room and had\napparently been in conclave when the entrance of Yvonne and her guide\ncaused them to turn quickly to the door and to scan the new-comers with\na furtive, suspicious look which would have been pathetic had it not\nbeen so full of evil intent. The muttered blasphemy had come from this\ngroup; one or two of the men spat upon the ground in the direction of\nthe door, where Yvonne instinctively had remained rooted to the spot.\n\nAs for the women, they only betrayed their sex by the ragged clothes\nwhich they wore: there was not a face here which had on it a single line\nof softness or of gentleness: they might have been old women or young:\ntheir hair was of a uniform, nondescript colour, lank and unkempt,\nhanging in thin strands over their brows; their eyes were sunken, their\ncheeks either flaccid or haggard--there was no individuality amongst\nthem--just one uniform sisterhood of wretchedness which had already\ngone hand in hand with crime.\n\nAcross one angle of the room there was a high wooden counter like a bar,\non which stood a number of jugs and bottles, some chunks of bread and\npieces of cheese, and a collection of pewter mugs. An old man and a fat,\ncoarse-featured, middle-aged woman stood behind it and dispensed various\nnoxious-looking liquors. Above their heads upon the grimy, tumble-down\nwall the Republican device \"Libert\u00c3\u00a9! Egalit\u00c3\u00a9! Fraternit\u00c3\u00a9!\" was scrawled\nin charcoal in huge characters, and below it was scribbled the hideous\ndoggrel which an impious mind had fashioned last autumn on the subject\nof the martyred Queen.\n\n\nIV\n\nYvonne had closed her eyes for a moment as she entered; now she turned\nappealingly toward her guide.\n\n\"Must it be in here?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am afraid it must,\" he replied with a sigh. \"You told me that you\nwould be brave.\"\n\nShe pulled herself together resolutely. \"I will be brave,\" she said\nquietly.\n\n\"Ah! that's better,\" he rejoined. \"I give you my word that you will be\nabsolutely safe in here until such time as your friends can get to you.\nI entreat you to gather up your courage. I assure you that these\nwretched people are not unkind: misery--not unlike that which you\nyourself have endured--has made them what they are. No doubt we should\nhave arranged for a better place for you wherein to await your friends\nif we had the choice. But you will understand that your safety and our\nown had to be our paramount consideration, and we had no choice.\"\n\n\"I quite understand, sir,\" said Yvonne valiantly, \"and am already\nashamed of my fears.\"\n\nAnd without another word of protest she stepped boldly into the room.\n\nFor a moment or two the guide remained standing on the threshold,\nwatching Yvonne's progress. She had already perceived an empty bench in\nthe furthest angle of the room, up against the door opposite, where she\nhoped or believed that she could remain unmolested while she waited\npatiently and in silence as she had been ordered to do. She skirted the\ngroups of men in the centre of the room as she went, but even so she\nfelt more than she heard that muttered insults accompanied the furtive\nand glowering looks wherewith she was regarded. More than one wretch\nspat upon her skirts on the way.\n\nBut now she was in no sense frightened, only wildly excited; even her\nfeeling of horror she contrived to conquer. The knowledge that her own\nattitude, and above all her obedience, would help her gallant rescuers\nin their work gave her enduring strength. She felt quite confident that\nwithin an hour or two she would be in the arms of her dear milor who had\nrisked his life in order to come to her. It was indeed well worth while\nto have suffered as she had done, to endure all that she might yet have\nto endure, for the sake of the happiness which was in store for her.\n\nShe turned to give a last look at her guide--a look which was intended\nto reassure him completely as to her courage and her obedience: but\nalready he had gone and had closed the door behind him, and quite\nagainst her will the sudden sense of loneliness and helplessness\nclutched at her heart with a grip that made it ache. She wished that she\nhad succeeded in catching sight of the face of so valiant a friend: the\nfact that she was safely out of Louise Adet's vengeful clutches was due\nto the man who had just disappeared behind that door. It would be thanks\nto him presently if she saw her father again. Yvonne felt more convinced\nthan ever that he was the Scarlet Pimpernel--milor's friend--who kept\nhis valiant personality a mystery, even to those who owed their lives to\nhim. She had seen the outline of his broad figure, she had felt the\ntouch of his hand. Would she recognise these again when she met him in\nEngland in the happy days that were to come? In any case she thought\nthat she would recognise the voice and the manner of speaking, so unlike\nthat of any English gentleman she had known.\n\n\nV\n\nThe man who had so mysteriously led Yvonne de Kernogan from the house of\nLouise Adet to the Rat Mort, turned away from the door of the tavern as\nsoon as it had closed on the young girl, and started to go back the way\nhe came.\n\nAt the angle formed by the high wall of the tavern he paused; a moving\nform had detached itself from the surrounding gloom and hailed him with\na cautious whisper.\n\n\"Hist! citizen Martin-Roget, is that you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Everything just as we anticipated?\"\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\"And the wench safely inside?\"\n\n\"Quite safely.\"\n\nThe other gave a low cackle, which might have been intended for a laugh.\n\n\"The simplest means,\" he said, \"are always the best.\"\n\n\"She never suspected me. It was all perfectly simple. You are a\nmagician, citizen Chauvelin,\" added Martin-Roget grudgingly. \"I never\nwould have thought of such a clever ruse.\"\n\n\"You see,\" rejoined Chauvelin drily, \"I graduated in the school of a\nmaster of all ruses--a master of daring and a past master in the art of\nmimicry. And hope was our great ally--the hope that never forsakes a\nprisoner--that of getting free. Your fair Yvonne had boundless faith in\nthe power of her English friends, therefore she fell into our trap like\na bird.\"\n\n\"And like a bird she shall struggle in vain after this,\" said\nMartin-Roget slowly. \"Oh! that I could hasten the flight of time--the\nnext few minutes will hang on me like hours. And I wish too it were not\nso bitterly cold,\" he added with a curse; \"this north-westerly wind has\ngot into my bones.\"\n\n\"On to your nerves, I imagine, citizen,\" retorted Chauvelin with a\nlaugh; \"for my part I feel as warm and comfortable as on a lovely day in\nJune.\"\n\n\"Hark! Who goes there?\" broke in the other man abruptly, as a solitary\nmoving form detached itself from the surrounding inky blackness and the\nsound of measured footsteps broke the silence of the night.\n\n\"Quite in order, citizen!\" was the prompt reply.\n\nThe shadowy form came a step or two further forward.\n\n\"Is it you, citizen Fleury?\" queried Chauvelin.\n\n\"Himself, citizen,\" replied the other.\n\nThe men had spoken in a whisper. Fleury now placed his hand on\nChauvelin's arm.\n\n\"We had best not stand so close to the tavern,\" he said, \"the night\nhawks are already about and we don't want to scare them.\"\n\nHe led the others up the yard, then into a very narrow passage which lay\nbetween Louise Adet's house and the Rat Mort and was bordered by the\nhigh walls of the houses on either side.\n\n\"This is a blind alley,\" he whispered. \"We have the wall of Le Bouffay\nin front of us: the wall of the Rat Mort is on one side and the house of\nthe citizeness Adet on the other. We can talk here undisturbed.\"\n\nOverhead there was a tiny window dimly lighted from within. Chauvelin\npointed up to it.\n\n\"What is that?\" he asked.\n\n\"An aperture too small for any human being to pass through,\" replied\nFleury drily. \"It gives on a small landing at the foot of the stairs. I\ntold Friche to try and manoeuvre so that the wench and her father are\npushed in there out of the way while the worst of the fracas is going\non. That was your suggestion, citizen Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"It was. I was afraid the two aristos might get spirited away while your\nmen were tackling the crowd in the tap-room. I wanted them put away in a\nsafe place.\"\n\n\"The staircase is safe enough,\" rejoined Fleury; \"it has no egress save\nthat on the tap-room and only leads to the upper story and the attic.\nThe house has no back entrance--it is built against the wall of Le\nBouffay.\"\n\n\"And what about your Marats, citizen commandant?\"\n\n\"Oh! I have them all along the street--entirely under cover but closely\non the watch--half a company and all keen after the game. The thousand\nfrancs you promised them has stimulated their zeal most marvellously,\nand as soon as Paul Friche in there has whipped up the tempers of the\nfrequenters of the Rat Mort, we shall be ready to rush the place and I\nassure you, citizen Chauvelin, that only a disembodied ghost--if there\nbe one in the place--will succeed in evading arrest.\"\n\n\"Is Paul Friche already at his post then?\"\n\n\"And at work--or I'm much mistaken,\" replied Fleury as he suddenly\ngripped Chauvelin by the arm.\n\nFor just at this moment the silence of the winter's night was broken by\nloud cries which came from the interior of the Rat Mort--voices were\nraised to hoarse and raucous cries--men and women all appeared to be\nshrieking together, and presently there was a loud crash as of\noverturned furniture and broken glass.\n\n\"A few minutes longer, citizen Fleury,\" said Chauvelin, as the\ncommandant of the Marats turned on his heel and started to go back to\nthe Carrefour de la Poissonnerie.\n\n\"Oh yes!\" whispered the latter, \"we'll wait awhile longer to give the\nEnglishmen time to arrive on the scene. The coast is clear for them--my\nMarats are hidden from sight behind the doorways and shop-fronts of the\nhouses opposite. In about three minutes from now I'll send them\nforward.\"\n\n\"And good luck to your hunting, citizen,\" whispered Chauvelin in\nresponse.\n\nFleury very quickly disappeared in the darkness and the other two men\nfollowed in his wake. They hugged the wall of the Rat Mort as they went\nalong and its shadow enveloped them completely: their shoes made no\nsound on the unpaved ground. Chauvelin's nostrils quivered as he drew\nthe keen, cold air into his lungs and faced the north-westerly blast\nwhich at this moment also lashed the face of his enemy. His keen eyes\ntried to pierce the gloom, his ears were strained to hear that merry\npeal of laughter which in the unforgettable past had been wont to\nproclaim the presence of the reckless adventurer. He knew--he felt--as\ncertainly as he felt the air which he breathed, that the man whom he\nhated beyond everything on earth was somewhere close by, wrapped in the\nmurkiness of the night--thinking, planning, intriguing, pitting his\nsharp wits, his indomitable pluck, his impudent dare-devilry against the\nsure and patient trap which had been set for him.\n\nHalf a company of Marats in front--the walls of Le Bouffay in the rear!\nChauvelin rubbed his thin hands together!\n\n\"You are not a disembodied ghost, my fine Scarlet Pimpernel,\" he\nmurmured, \"and this time I really think----\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE FRACAS IN THE TAVERN\n\n\nI\n\nYvonne had settled herself in a corner of the tap-room on a bench and\nhad tried to lose consciousness of her surroundings.\n\nIt was not easy! Glances charged with rancour were levelled at her\ndainty appearance--dainty and refined despite the look of starvation and\nof weariness on her face and the miserable state of her clothing--and\nnot a few muttered insults waited on those glances.\n\nAs soon as she was seated Yvonne noticed that the old man and the\ncoarse, fat woman behind the bar started an animated conversation\ntogether, of which she was very obviously the object, for the two\nheads--the lean and the round--were jerked more than once in her\ndirection. Presently the man--it was George Lemoine, the proprietor of\nthe Rat Mort--came up to where she was sitting: his lank figure was bent\nso that his lean back formed the best part of an arc, and an expression\nof mock deference further distorted his ugly face.\n\nHe came up quite close to Yvonne and she found it passing difficult not\nto draw away from him, for the leer on his face was appalling: his eyes,\nwhich were set very near to his hooked nose, had a horrible squint, his\nlips were thick and moist, and his breath reeked of alcohol.\n\n\"What will the noble lady deign to drink?\" he now asked in an oily,\nsuave voice.\n\nAnd Yvonne, remembering the guide's admonitions, contrived to smile\nunconcernedly into the hideous face.\n\n\"I would very much like some wine,\" she said cheerfully, \"but I am\nafraid that I have no money wherewith to pay you for it.\"\n\nThe creature with a gesture of abject humility rubbed his greasy hands\ntogether.\n\n\"And may I respectfully ask,\" he queried blandly, \"what are the\nintentions of the noble lady in coming to this humble abode, if she hath\nno desire to partake of refreshments?\"\n\n\"I am expecting friends,\" replied Yvonne bravely; \"they will be here\nvery soon, and will gladly repay you lavishly for all the kindness which\nyou may be inclined to show to me the while.\"\n\nShe was very brave indeed and looked this awful misshapen specimen of a\nman quite boldly in the face: she even contrived to smile, though she\nwas well aware that a number of men and women--perhaps a dozen\naltogether--had congregated in front of her in a compact group around\nthe landlord, that they were nudging one another and pointing\nderisively--malevolently--at her. It was impossible, despite all\nattempts at valour, to mistake the hostile attitude of these people.\nSome of the most obscene words, coined during these last horrible days\nof the Revolution, were freely hurled at her, and one woman suddenly\ncried out in a shrill treble:\n\n\"Throw her out, citizen Lemoine! We don't want spies in here!\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed,\" said Yvonne as quietly as she could, \"I am no spy. I\nam poor and wreched like yourselves! and desperately lonely, save for\nthe kind friends who will meet me here anon.\"\n\n\"Aristos like yourself!\" growled one of the men. \"This is no place for\nyou or for them.\"\n\n\"No! No! This is no place for aristos,\" cried one of the women in a\nvoice which many excesses and many vices had rendered hoarse and rough.\n\"Spy or not, we don't want you in here. Do we?\" she added as with arms\nakimbo she turned to face those of her own sex, who behind the men had\ncome up in order to see what was going on.\n\n\"Throw her out, Lemoine,\" reiterated a man who appeared to be an oracle\namongst the others.\n\n\"Please! please let me stop here!\" pleaded Yvonne; \"if you turn me out I\nshall not know what to do: I shall not know where to meet my\nfriends....\"\n\n\"Pretty story about those friends,\" broke in Lemoine roughly. \"How do I\nknow if you're lying or not?\"\n\nFrom the opposite angle of the room, the woman behind the bar had been\nwatching the little scene with eyes that glistened with cupidity. Now\nshe emerged from behind her stronghold of bottles and mugs and slowly\nwaddled across the room. She pushed her way unceremoniously past her\ncustomers, elbowing men, women and children vigorously aside with a deft\nplay of her large, muscular arms. Having reached the forefront of the\nlittle group she came to a standstill immediately in front of Yvonne,\nand crossing her mighty arms over her ponderous chest she eyed the\n\"aristo\" with unconcealed malignity.\n\n\"We do know that the slut is lying--that is where you make the mistake,\nLemoine. A slut, that's what she is--and the friend whom she's going to\nmeet ...? Well!\" she added, turning with an ugly leer toward the other\nwomen, \"we all know what sort of friend that one is likely to be, eh,\nmesdames? Bringing evil fame on this house, that's what the wench is\nafter ... so as to bring the police about our ears ... I wouldn't trust\nher, not another minute. Out with you and at once--do you hear?... this\ninstant ... Lemoine has parleyed quite long enough with you already!\"\n\nDespite all her resolutions Yvonne was terribly frightened. While the\nhideous old hag talked and screamed and waved her coarse, red arms\nabout, the unfortunate young girl with a great effort of will, kept\nrepeating to herself: \"I am not frightened--I must not be frightened. He\nassured me that these people would do me no harm....\" But now when the\nwoman had ceased speaking there was a general murmur of:\n\n\"Throw her out! Spy or aristo we don't want her here!\" whilst some of\nthe men added significantly: \"I am sure that she is one of Carrier's\nspies and in league with his Marats! We shall have those devils in here\nin a moment if we don't look out! Throw her out before she can signal to\nthe Marats!\"\n\nUgly faces charged with hatred and virulence were thrust threateningly\nforward--one or two of the women were obviously looking forward to\njoining in the scramble, when this \"stuck-up wench\" would presently be\nhurled out into the street.\n\n\"Now then, my girl, out you get,\" concluded the woman Lemoine, as with\nan expressive gesture she proceeded to roll her sleeves higher up her\narm. She was about to lay her dirty hands on Yvonne, and the poor girl\nwas nearly sick with horror, when one of the men--a huge, coarse giant,\nwhose muscular torso, covered with grease and grime showed almost naked\nthrough a ragged shirt which hung from his shoulders in strips--seized\nthe woman Lemoine by the arm and dragged her back a step or two away\nfrom Yvonne.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, _petite m\u00c3\u00a8re_,\" he said, accompanying this admonition\nwith a blasphemous oath. \"Slut or no, the wench may as well pay you\nsomething for the privilege of staying here. Look at that cloak she's\nwearing--the shoe-leather on her feet. Aren't they worth a bottle of\nyour sour wine?\"\n\n\"What's that to you, Paul Friche?\" retorted the woman roughly, as with a\nvigorous gesture she freed her arm from the man's grasp. \"Is this my\nhouse or yours?\"\n\n\"Yours, of course,\" replied the man with a coarse laugh and a still\ncoarser jest, \"but this won't be the first time that I have saved you\nfrom impulsive folly. Yesterday you were for harbouring a couple of\nrogues who were Marats in disguise: if I hadn't given you warning, you\nwould now have swallowed more water from the Loire than you would care\nto hold. But for me two days ago you would have received the goods\npinched by Fert\u00c3\u00a9 out of Balaze's shop, and been thrown to the fishes in\nconsequence for the entertainment of the proconsul and his friends. You\nmust admit that I've been a good friend to you before now.\"\n\n\"And if you have, Paul Friche,\" retorted the hag obstinately, \"I paid\nyou well for your friendship, both yesterday and the day before, didn't\nI?\"\n\n\"You did,\" assented Friche imperturbably. \"That's why I want to serve\nyou again to-night.\"\n\n\"Don't listen to him, _petite m\u00c3\u00a8re_,\" interposed one of two out of the\ncrowd. \"He is a white-livered skunk to talk to you like that.\"\n\n\"Very well! Very well!\" quoth Paul Friche, and he spat vigorously on the\nground in token that henceforth he divested himself from any\nresponsibility in this matter, \"don't listen to me. Lose a benefit of\ntwenty, perhaps forty francs for the sake of a bit of fun. Very well!\nVery well!\" he continued as he turned and slouched out of the group to\nthe further end of the room, where he sat down on a barrel. He drew the\nstump of a clay pipe out of the pocket of his breeches, stuffed it into\nhis mouth, stretched his long legs out before him and sucked away at his\npipe with complacent detachment. \"I didn't know,\" he added with biting\nsarcasm by way of a parting shot, \"that you and Lemoine had come into a\nfortune recently and that forty or fifty francs are nothing to you now.\"\n\n\"Forty or fifty? Come! come!\" protested Lemoine feebly.\n\n\nII\n\nYvonne's fate was hanging in the balance. The attitude of the small\ncrowd was no less threatening than before, but immediate action was\nwithheld while the Lemoines obviously debated in their minds what was\nbest to be done. The instinct to \"have at\" an aristo with all the\naccumulated hatred of many generations was warring with the innate\nrapacity of the Breton peasant.\n\n\"Forty or fifty?\" reiterated Paul Friche emphatically. \"Can't you see\nthat the wench is an aristo escaped out of Le Bouffay or the entrep\u00c3\u00b4t?\"\nhe added contemptuously.\n\n\"I know that she is an aristo,\" said the woman, \"that's why I want to\nthrow her out.\"\n\n\"And get nothing for your pains,\" retorted Friche roughly. \"If you wait\nfor her friends we may all of us get as much as twenty francs each to\nhold our tongues.\"\n\n\"Twenty francs each....\" The murmur was repeated with many a sigh of\nsavage gluttony, by every one in the room--and repeated again and\nagain--especially by the women.\n\n\"You are a fool, Paul Friche ...\" commented Lemoine.\n\n\"A fool am I?\" retorted the giant. \"Then let me tell you, that 'tis you\nwho are a fool and worse. I happen to know,\" he added, as he once more\nrose and rejoined the group in the centre of the room, \"I happen to know\nthat you and every one here is heading straight for a trap arranged by\nthe Committee of Public Safety, whose chief emissary came into Nantes\nawhile ago and is named Chauvelin. It is a trap which will land you all\nin the criminal dock first and on the way to Cayenne or the guillotine\nafterwards. This place is surrounded with Marats, and orders have been\nissued to them to make a descent on this place, as soon as papa\nLemoine's customers are assembled. There are two members of the accursed\ncompany amongst us at the present moment....\"\n\nHe was standing right in the middle of the room, immediately beneath the\nhanging lamp. At his words--spoken with such firm confidence, as one who\nknows and is therefore empowered to speak--a sudden change came over the\nspirit of the whole assembly. Everything was forgotten in the face of\nthis new danger--two Marats, the sleuth-hounds of the proconsul--here\npresent, as spies and as informants! Every face became more\nhaggard--every cheek more livid. There was a quick and furtive scurrying\ntoward the front door.\n\n\"Two Marats here?\" shouted one man, who was bolder than the rest. \"Where\nare they?\"\n\nPaul Friche, who towered above his friends, stood at this moment quite\nclose to a small man, dressed like the others in ragged breeches and\nshirt, and wearing the broad-brimmed hat usually affected by the Breton\npeasantry.\n\n\"Two Marats? Two spies?\" screeched a woman. \"Where are they?\"\n\n\"Here is one,\" replied Paul Friche with a loud laugh: and with his large\ngrimy hand he lifted the hat from his neighbour's head and threw it on\nthe ground; \"and there,\" he added as with long, bony finger he pointed\nto the front door, where another man--a square-built youngster with\ntow-coloured hair somewhat resembling a shaggy dog--was endeavouring to\neffect a surreptitious exit, \"there is the other; and he is on the point\nof slipping quietly away in order to report to his captain what he has\nseen and heard at the Rat Mort. One moment, citizen,\" he added, and with\na couple of giant strides he too had reached the door; his large rough\nhand had come down heavily on the shoulder of the youth with the\ntow-coloured hair, and had forced him to veer round and to face the\nangry, gesticulating crowd.\n\n\"Two Marats! Two spies!\" shouted the men. \"Now we'll soon settle their\nlittle business for them!\"\n\n\"Marat yourself,\" cried the small man who had first been denounced by\nFriche. \"I am no Marat, as a good many of you here know. Maman Lemoine,\"\nhe added pleading, \"you know me. Am I a Marat?\"\n\nBut the Lemoines--man and wife--at the first suggestion of police had\nturned a deaf ear to all their customers. Their own safety being in\njeopardy they cared little what happened to anybody else. They had\nretired behind their counter and were in close consultation together, no\ndoubt as to the best means of escape if indeed the man Paul Friche spoke\nthe truth.\n\n\"I know nothing about him,\" the woman was saying, \"but he certainly was\nright last night about those two men who came ferreting in here--and\nlast week too....\"\n\n\"Am I a Marat, maman Lemoine?\" shouted the small man as he hammered his\nfists upon the counter. \"For ten years and more I have been a customer\nin this place and....\"\n\n\"Am I a Marat?\" shouted the youth with the tow-coloured hair addressing\nthe assembly indiscriminately. \"Some of you here know me well enough.\nJean Paul, you know--Ledouble, you too....\"\n\n\"Of course! Of course I know you well enough, Jacques Leroux,\" came with\na loud laugh from one of the crowd. \"Who said you were a Marat?\"\n\n\"Am I a Marat, maman Lemoine?\" reiterated the small man at the counter.\n\n\"Oh! leave me alone with your quarrels,\" shouted the woman Lemoine in\nreply. \"Settle them among yourselves.\"\n\n\"Then if Jacques Leroux is not a Marat,\" now came in a bibulous voice\nfrom a distant comer of the room, \"and this compeer here is known to\nmaman Lemoine, where are the real Marats who according to this fellow\nFriche, whom we none of us know, are spying upon us?\"\n\n\"Yes! where are they?\" suggested another. \"Show 'em to us, Paul Friche,\nor whatever your accursed name happens to be.\"\n\n\"Tell us where you come from yourself,\" screamed the woman with the\nshrill treble, \"it seems to me quite possible that you're a Marat\nyourself.\"\n\nThis suggestion was at once taken up.\n\n\"Marat yourself!\" shouted the crowd, and the two men who a moment ago\nhad been accused of being spies in disguise shouted louder than the\nrest: \"Marat yourself!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nAfter that, pandemonium reigned.\n\nThe words \"police\" and \"Marats\" had aroused the terror of all these\nnight-hawks, who were wont to think themselves immune inside their lair:\nand terror is at all times an evil counsellor. In the space of a few\nseconds confusion held undisputed sway. Every one screamed, waved arms,\nstamped feet, struck out with heavy bare fists at his nearest neighbour.\nEvery one's hand was against every one else.\n\n\"Spy! Marat! Informer!\" were the three words that detached themselves\nmost clearly from out the babel of vituperations freely hurled from end\nto end of the room.\n\nThe children screamed, the women's shrill or hoarse treble mingled with\nthe cries and imprecations of the men.\n\nPaul Friche had noted that the turn of the tide was against him, long\nbefore the first naked fist had been brandished in his face. Agile as a\nmonkey he had pushed his way through to the bar, and placing his two\nhands upon it, with a swift leap he had taken up a sitting position in\nthe very middle of the table amongst the jugs and bottles, which he\npromptly seized and used as missiles and weapons, whilst with his\ndangling feet encased in heavy sabots he kicked out vigorously and\nunceasingly against the shins of his foremost assailants.\n\nHe had the advantage of position and used it cleverly. In his right hand\nhe held a pewter mug by the handle and used it as a swivel against his\naggressors with great effect.\n\n\"The Loire for you--you blackmailer! liar! traitor!\" shouted some of the\nwomen who, bolder than the men, thrust shaking fists at Paul Friche as\nclosely as that pewter mug would allow.\n\n\"Break his jaw before he can yell for the police,\" admonished one of the\nmen from the rear, \"before he can save his own skin.\"\n\nBut those who shouted loudest had only their fists by way of weapon and\nPaul Friche had mugs and bottles, and those sabots of his kicked out\nwith uncomfortable agility.\n\n\"Break my jaw, will you,\" he shouted every time that a blow from the mug\nwent home, \"a spy am I? Very well then, here's for you, Jacques Leroux;\ngo and nurse your cracked skull at home. You want a row,\" he added\nhitting at a youth who brandished a heavy fist in his face, \"well! you\nshall have it and as much of it as you like! as much of it as will bring\nthe patrols of police comfortably about your ears.\"\n\nBang! went the pewter mug crashing against a man's hard skull! Bang went\nPaul Friche's naked fist against the chest of another. He was a hard\nhitter and swift.\n\nThe Lemoines from behind their bar shouted louder than the rest, doing\nas much as their lungs would allow them in the way of admonishing,\nentreating, protesting--cursing every one for a set of fools who were\nplaying straight into the hands of the police.\n\n\"Now then! Now then, children, stop that bellowing, will you? There are\nno spies here. Paul Friche was only having his little joke! We all know\none another, what?\"\n\n\"Camels!\" added Lemoine more forcibly. \"They'll bring the patrols about\nour ears for sure.\"\n\nPaul Friche was not by any means the only man who was being vigorously\nattacked. After the first two or three minutes of this kingdom of\npandemonium, it was difficult to say who was quarrelling with whom. Old\ngrudges were revived, old feuds taken up there, where they had\npreviously been interrupted. Accusations of spying were followed by\nabuse for some past wrong of black-legging or cheating a confr\u00c3\u00a8re. The\ntemperature of the room became suffocating. All these violent passions\nseething within these four walls seemed to become tangible and to mingle\nwith the atmosphere already surcharged with the fumes of alcohol, of\ntobacco and of perspiring humanity. There was many a black-eye already,\nmany a contusion: more than one knife--surreptitiously drawn--was\nalready stained with red.\n\n\nIV\n\nThere was also a stampede for the door. One man gave the signal. Seeing\nthat his mates were wasting precious time by venting their wrath against\nPaul Friche and then quarrelling among themselves, he hoped to effect an\nescape ere the police came to stop the noise. No one believed in the\nplace being surrounded. Why should it be? The Marats were far too busy\nhunting up rebels and aristos to trouble much about the Rat Mort and its\ncustomers, but it was quite possible that a brawl would bring a patrol\nalong, and then 'ware the _police correctionnelle_ and the possibility\nof deportation or worse. Retreat was undoubtedly safer while there was\ntime. One man first: then one or two more on his heels, and those among\nthe women who had children in their arms or clinging to their skirts:\nthey turned stealthily to the door--almost ashamed of their cowardice,\nashamed lest they were seen abandoning the field of combat.\n\nIt was while confusion reigned unchecked that Yvonne--who was cowering,\nfrankly terrified at last, in the corner of the room, became aware that\nthe door close beside her--the door situated immediately opposite the\nfront entrance--was surreptitiously opened. She turned quickly to\nlook--for she was like a terror-stricken little animal now--one that\nscents and feels and fears danger from every quarter round. The door was\nbeing pushed open very slowly by what was still to Yvonne an unseen\nhand. Somehow that opening door fascinated her: for the moment she\nforgot the noise and the confusion around her.\n\nThen suddenly with a great effort of will she checked the scream which\nhad forced itself up to her throat.\n\n\"Father!\" was all that she contrived to say in a hoarse and passionate\nmurmur.\n\nFortunately as he peered cautiously round the room, M. le duc caught\nsight of his daughter. She was staring at him--wide-eyed, her lips\nbloodless, her cheeks the colour of ashes. He looked but the ghost now\nof that proud aristocrat who little more than a week ago was the centre\nof a group of courtiers round the person of the heir to the English\nthrone. Starved, emaciated, livid, he was the shadow of his former self,\nand there was a haunted look in his purple-rimmed eyes which spoke with\npathetic eloquence of sleepless nights and of a soul tortured with\nremorse.\n\nJust for the moment no one took any notice of him--every one was\nshrieking, every one was quarrelling, and M. le duc, placing a finger to\nhis lips, stole cautiously round to his daughter. The next instant they\nwere clinging to one another, these two, who had endured so much\ntogether--he the father who had wrought such an unspeakable wrong, and\nshe the child who was so lonely, so forlorn and almost happy in finding\nsome one who belonged to her, some one to whom she could cling.\n\n\"Father, dear! what shall we do?\" Yvonne murmured, for she felt the last\nshred of her fictitious courage oozing out of her, in face of this awful\nlawlessness which literally paralysed her thinking faculties.\n\n\"Sh! dear!\" whispered M. le duc in reply. \"We must get out of this\nloathsome place while this hideous row is going on. I heard it all from\nthe filthy garret up above, where those devils have kept me these three\ndays. The door was not locked.... I crept downstairs.... No one is\npaying heed to us.... We can creep out. Come.\"\n\nBut at the suggestion, Yvonne's spirits, which had been stunned by the\nevents of the past few moments, revived with truly mercurial rapidity.\n\n\"No! no! dear,\" she urged. \"We must stay here.... You don't know.... I\nhave had a message--from my own dear milor--my husband ... he sent a\nfriend to take me out of the hideous prison where that awful Pierre Adet\nwas keeping me--a friend who assured me that my dear milor was watching\nover me ... he brought me to this place--and begged me not to be\nfrightened ... but to wait patiently ... and I must wait, dear ... I\nmust wait!\"\n\nShe spoke rapidly in whispers and in short jerky sentences. M. le duc\nlistened to her wide-eyed, a deep line of puzzlement between his brows.\nSorrow, remorse, starvation, misery had in a measure numbed his mind.\nThe thought of help, of hope, of friends could not penetrate into his\nbrain.\n\n\"A message,\" he murmured inanely, \"a message. No! no! my girl, you must\ntrust no one.... Pierre Adet.... Pierre Adet is full of evil tricks--he\nwill trap you ... he means to destroy us both ... he has brought you\nhere so that you should be murdered by these ferocious devils.\"\n\n\"Impossible, father dear,\" she said, still striving to speak bravely.\n\"We have both of us been all this while in the power of Pierre Adet; he\ncould have had no object in bringing me here to-night.\"\n\nBut the father who had been an insentient tool in the schemes of that\nmiserable intriguer, who had been the means of bringing his only child\nto this terrible and deadly pass--the man who had listened to the lying\ncounsels and proposals of his own most bitter enemy, could only groan\nnow in terror and in doubt.\n\n\"Who can probe the depths of that abominable villain's plans?\" he\nmurmured vaguely.\n\nIn the meanwhile the little group who had thought prudence the better\npart of valour had reached the door. The foremost man amongst them\nopened it and peered cautiously out into the darkness. He turned back to\nthose behind him, put a finger to his lip and beckoned to them to follow\nhim in silence.\n\n\"Yvonne, let us go!\" whispered the duc, who had seized his daughter by\nthe hand.\n\n\"But father....\"\n\n\"Let us go!\" he reiterated pitiably. \"I shall die if we stay here!\"\n\n\"It won't be for long, father dear,\" she entreated; \"if milor should\ncome with his friend, and find us gone, we should be endangering his\nlife as well as our own.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" he rejoined with the obstinacy of weakness. \"I\ndon't believe in your message ... how could milor or anyone come to your\nrescue, my child?... No one knows that you are here, in this hell in\nNantes.\"\n\nYvonne clung to him with the strength of despair. She too was as\nterrified as any human creature could be and live, but terror had not\naltogether swept away her belief in that mysterious message, in that\ntall guide who had led her hither, in that scarlet device--the\nfive-petalled flower which stood for everything that was most gallant\nand most brave.\n\nShe desired with all her might to remain here--despite everything,\ndespite the awful brawl that was raging round her and which sickened\nher, despite the horror of the whole thing--to remain here and to wait.\nShe put her arms round her father: she dragged him back every time that\nhe tried to move. But a sort of unnatural strength seemed to have\nconquered his former debility. His attempts to get away became more and\nmore determined and more and more febrile.\n\n\"Come, Yvonne! we must go!\" he continued to murmur intermittently and\nwith ever-growing obstinacy. \"No one will notice us.... I heard the\nnoise from my garret upstairs.... I crept down.... I knew no one would\nnotice me.... Come--we must go ... now is our time.\"\n\n\"Father, dear, whither could we go? Once in the streets of Nantes what\nwould happen to us?\"\n\n\"We can find our way to the Loire!\" he retorted almost brutally. He\nshook himself free from her restraining arms and gripped her firmly by\nthe hand. He tried to drag her toward the door, whilst she still\nstruggled to keep him back. He had just caught sight of the group of men\nand women at the front door: their leader was standing upon the\nthreshold and was still peering out into the darkness.\n\nBut the next moment they all came to a halt: what their leader had\nperceived through the darkness did not evidently quite satisfy him: he\nturned and held a whispered consultation with the others. M. le duc\nstrove with all his might to join in with that group. He felt that in\nits wake would lie the road to freedom. He would have struck Yvonne for\nstanding in the way of her own safety.\n\n\"Father dear,\" she contrived finally to say to him, \"if you go hence,\nyou will go alone. Nothing will move me from here, because I know that\nmilor will come.\"\n\n\"Curse you for your obstinacy,\" retorted the duc, \"you jeopardise my\nlife and yours.\"\n\nThen suddenly from the angle of the room where wrangling and fighting\nwere at their fiercest, there came a loud call:\n\n\"Look out, p\u00c3\u00a8re Lemoine, your aristos are running away. You are losing\nyour last chance of those fifty francs.\"\n\nIt was Paul Friche who had shouted. His position on the table was giving\nhim a commanding view over the heads of the threatening, shouting,\nperspiring crowd, and he had just caught sight of M. le duc dragging his\ndaughter by force toward the door.\n\n\"The authors of all this pother,\" he added with an oath, \"and they will\nget away whilst we have the police about our ears.\"\n\n\"Name of a name of a dog,\" swore Lemoine from behind his bar, \"that\nshall not be. Come along, maman, let us bring those aristos along here.\nQuick now.\"\n\nIt was all done in a second. Lemoine and his wife, with the weight and\nauthority of the masters of the establishment, contrived to elbow their\nway through the crowd. The next moment Yvonne felt herself forcibly\ndragged away from her father.\n\n\"This way, my girl, and no screaming,\" a bibulous voice said in her ear,\n\"no screaming, or I'll smash some of those front teeth of yours. You\nsaid some rich friends were coming along for you presently. Well then!\ncome and wait for them out of the crowd!\"\n\nIndeed Yvonne had no desire to struggle or to scream. Salvation she\nthought had come to her and to her father in this rough guise. In\nanother moment mayhap he would have forced her to follow him, to leave\nmilor in the lurch, to jeopardise for ever every chance of safety.\n\n\"It is all for the best, father dear,\" she managed to cry out over her\nshoulder, for she had just caught sight of him being seized round the\nshoulders by Lemoine and heard him protesting loudly:\n\n\"I'll not go! I'll not go! Let me go!\" he shouted hoarsely. \"My\ndaughter! Yvonne! Let me go! You devil!\"\n\nBut Lemoine had twice the vigour of the duc de Kernogan, nor did he care\none jot about the other's protests. He hated all this row inside his\nhouse, but there had been rows in it before and he was beginning to hope\nthat nothing serious would come of it. On the other hand, Paul Friche\nmight be right about these aristos; there might be forty or fifty francs\nto be made out of them, and in any case they had one or two things upon\ntheir persons which might be worth a few francs--and who knows? they\nmight even have something in their pockets worth taking.\n\nThis hope and thought gave Lemoine additional strength, and seeing that\nthe aristo struggled so desperately, he thought to silence him by\nbringing his heavy fist with a crash upon the old man's head.\n\n\"Yvonne! _A moi!_\" shouted M. le duc ere he fell back senseless.\n\nThat awful cry, Yvonne heard it as she was being dragged through the\nnoisome crowd. It mingled in her ear with the other awful sounds--the\noaths and blasphemies which filled the air with their hideousness. It\ndied away just as a formidable crash against the entrance door suddenly\nsilenced every cry within.\n\n\"All hands up!\" came with a peremptory word of command from the doorway.\n\n\"Mercy on us!\" murmured the woman Lemoine, who still had Yvonne by the\nhand, \"we are undone this time.\"\n\nThere was a clatter and grounding of arms--a scurrying of bare feet and\nsabots upon the floor, the mingled sounds of men trying to fly and being\ncaught in the act and hurled back: screams of terror from the women, one\nor two pitiable calls, a few shrill cries from frightened children, a\nfew dull thuds as of human bodies falling.... It was all so confused, so\nunspeakably horrible. Yvonne was hardly conscious. Near her some one\nwhispered hurriedly:\n\n\"Put the aristos away somewhere, maman Lemoine ... the whole thing may\nonly be a scare ... the Marats may only be here about the aristos ...\nthey will probably leave you alone if you give them up ... perhaps\nyou'll get a reward.... Put them away till some of this row subsides ...\nI'll talk to commandant Fleury if I can.\"\n\nYvonne felt her knees giving way under her. There was nothing more to\nhope for now--nothing. She felt herself lifted from the ground--she was\ntoo sick and faint to realise what was happening: through the din which\nfilled her ears she vainly tried to distinguish her father's voice\nagain.\n\n\nV\n\nA moment or two later she found herself squatting somewhere on the\nground. How she got here she did not know--where she was she knew still\nless. She was in total darkness. A fusty, close smell of food and wine\ngave her a wretched feeling of nausea--her head ached intolerably, her\neyes were hot, her throat dry: there was a constant buzzing in her\nears.\n\nThe terrible sounds of fighting and screaming and cursing, the crash of\nbroken glass and overturned benches came to her as through a\npartition--close by but muffled.\n\nIn the immediate nearness all was silence and darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE ENGLISH ADVENTURERS\n\n\nI\n\nIt was with that muffled din still ringing in her ear and with the\nconception of all that was going on, on the other side of the partition,\nstanding like an awesome spectre of evil before her mind, that Yvonne\nwoke to the consciousness that her father was dead.\n\nHe lay along the last half-dozen steps of a narrow wooden staircase\nwhich had its base in the narrow, cupboard-like landing on to which the\nLemoines had just thrust them both. Through a small heart-shaped hole\ncut in the door of the partition-wall, a shaft of feeble light struck\nstraight across to the foot of the stairs: it lit up the recumbent\nfigure of the last of the ducs de Kernogan, killed in a brawl in a house\nof evil fame.\n\nWeakened by starvation, by the hardships of the past few days, his\nconstitution undermined by privations and mayhap too by gnawing remorse,\nhe had succumbed to the stunning blow dealt to him by a half drunken\nbrute. His cry: \"Yvonne! _A moi!_\" was the last despairing call of a\nsoul racked with remorse to the daughter whom he had so cruelly wronged.\n\nWhen first that feeble shaft of light had revealed to her the presence\nof that inert form upon the steps, she had struggled to her feet\nand--dazed--had tottered up to it. Even before she had touched the face,\nthe hands, before she had bent her ear to the half-closed mouth and\nfailed to catch the slightest breath, she knew the full extent of her\nmisery. The look in the wide-open eyes did not terrify her, but they\ntold her the truth, and since then she had cowered beside her dead\nfather on the bottom step of the narrow stairs, her fingers tightly\nclosed over that one hand which never would be raised against her.\n\nAn unspeakable sense of horror filled her soul. The thought that he--the\nproud father, the haughty aristocrat, should lie like this and in such a\nspot, dragged in and thrown down--no doubt by Lemoine--like a parcel of\nrubbish and left here to be dragged away again and thrown again like a\ndog into some unhallowed ground--that thought was so horrible, so\nmonstrous, that at first it dominated even sorrow. Then came the\nheartrending sense of loneliness. Yvonne Dewhurst had endured so much\nthese past few days that awhile ago she would have affirmed that nothing\ncould appal her in the future. But this was indeed the awful and\noverwhelming climax to what had already been a surfeit of misery.\n\nThis! she, Yvonne, cowering beside her dead father, with no one to stand\nbetween her and any insult, any outrage which might be put upon her,\nwith nothing now but a few laths between her and that yelling,\nscreeching mob outside.\n\nOh! the loneliness! the utter, utter loneliness!\n\nShe kissed the inert hand, the pale forehead: with gentle, reverent\nfingers she tried to smooth out those lines of horror and of fear which\ngave such a pitiful expression to the face. Of all the wrongs which her\nfather had done her she never thought for a moment. It was he who had\nbrought her to this terrible pass: he who had betrayed her into the\nhands of her deadliest enemy: he who had torn her from the protecting\narms of her dear milor and flung her and himself at the mercy of a set\nof inhuman wretches who knew neither compunction nor pity.\n\nBut all this she forgot, as she knelt beside the lifeless form--the last\nthing on earth that belonged to her--the last protection to which she\nmight have clung.\n\n\nII\n\nOut of the confusion of sounds which came--deadened by the intervening\npartition--to her ear, it was impossible to distinguish anything very\nclearly. All that Yvonne could do, as soon as she had in a measure\ncollected her scattered senses, was to try and piece together the events\nof the last few minutes--minutes which indeed seemed like days and even\nyears to her.\n\nInstinctively she gave to the inert hand which she held an additional\ntender touch. At any rate her father was out of it all. He was at rest\nand at peace. As for the rest, it was in God's hands. Having only\nherself to think of now, she ceased to care what became of her. He was\nout of it all: and those wretches after all could not do more than kill\nher. A complete numbness of senses and of mind had succeeded the\nfeverish excitement of the past few hours: whether hope still survived\nat this moment in Yvonne Dewhurst's mind it were impossible to say.\nCertain it is that it lay dormant--buried beneath the overwhelming\nmisery of her loneliness.\n\nShe took the fichu from her shoulders and laid it reverently over the\ndead man's face: she folded the hands across the breast. She could not\ncry: she could only pray, and that quite mechanically.\n\nThe thought of her dear milor, of his clever friend, of the message\nwhich she had received in prison, of the guide who had led her to this\nawful place, was relegated--almost as a memory--in the furthermost cell\nof her brain.\n\n\nIII\n\nBut after awhile outraged nature, still full of vitality and of youth,\nre-asserted itself. She felt numb and cold and struggled to her feet.\nFrom somewhere close to her a continuous current of air indicated the\npresence of some sort of window. Yvonne, faint with the close and sickly\nsmell, which even that current failed to disperse, felt her way all\nround the walls of the narrow landing.\n\nThe window was in the wall between the partition and the staircase, it\nwas small and quite low down. It was crossed with heavy iron bars.\nYvonne leaned up against it, grateful for the breath of pure air.\n\nFor awhile yet she remained unconscious of everything save the confused\ndin which still went on inside the tavern, and at first the sounds which\ncame through the grated window mingled with those on the other side of\nthe partition. But gradually as she contrived to fill her lungs with the\ncold breath of heaven, it seemed as if a curtain was being slowly drawn\naway from her atrophied senses.\n\nJust below the window two men were speaking. She could hear them quite\ndistinctly now--and soon one of the voices--clearer than the\nother--struck her ear with unmistakable familiarity.\n\n\"I told Paul Friche to come out here and speak to me,\" Yvonne heard that\nsame voice say.\n\n\"Then he should be here,\" replied the other, \"and if I am not\nmistaken....\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then the first voice was raised again.\n\n\"Halt! Is that Paul Friche?\"\n\n\"At your service, citizen,\" came in reply.\n\n\"Well! Is everything working smoothly inside?\"\n\n\"Quite smoothly; but your Englishmen are not there.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Bah! I know most of the faces that are to be found inside the Rat Mort\nat this hour: there are no strangers among them.\"\n\nThe voice that had sounded so familiar to Yvonne was raised now in loud\nand coarse laughter.\n\n\"Name of a dog! I never for a moment thought that there were any\nEnglishmen about. Citizen Chauvelin was suffering from nightmare.\"\n\n\"It is early yet,\" came in response from a gentle bland voice, \"you must\nhave patience, citizen.\"\n\n\"Patience? Bah!\" ejaculated the other roughly. \"As I told you before\n'tis but little I care about your English spies. 'Tis the Kernogans I am\ninterested in. What have you done with them, citizen?\"\n\n\"I got that blundering fool Lemoine to lock them up on the landing at\nthe bottom of the stairs.\"\n\n\"Is that safe?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. It has no egress save into the tap-room and up the stairs,\nto the rooms above. Your English spies if they came now would have to\nfly in and out of those top windows ere they could get to the aristos.\"\n\n\"Then in Satan's name keep them there awhile,\" urged the more gentle,\ninsinuating voice, \"until we can make sure of the English spies.\"\n\n\"Tshaw! What foolery!\" interjected the other, who appeared to be in a\ntowering passion. \"Bring them out at once, citizen Friche ... bring\nthem out ... right into the middle of the rabble in the tap-room....\nCommandant Fleury is directing the perquisition--he is taking down the\nnames of all that cattle which he is arresting inside the premises--let\nthe ci-devant duc de Kernogan and his exquisite daughter figure among\nthe vilest cut-throats of Nantes.\"\n\n\"Citizen, let me urge on you once more ...\" came in earnest persuasive\naccents from that gentle voice.\n\n\"Nothing!\" broke in the other savagely. \"To h----ll with your English\nspies. It is the Kernogans that I want.\"\n\nYvonne, half-crazed with horror, had heard the whole of this abominable\nconversation wherein she had not failed to recognise the voice of\nMartin-Roget or Pierre-Adet, as she now knew him to be. Who the other\ntwo men were she could easily conjecture. The soft bland voice she had\nheard twice during these past few days, which had been so full of\nmisery, of terror and of surprise: once she had heard it on board the\nship which had taken her away from England and once again a few hours\nsince, inside the narrow room which had been her prison. The third man\nwho had subsequently arrived on the scene was that coarse and grimy\ncreature who had seemed to be the moving evil spirit of that awful brawl\nin the tavern.\n\nWhat the conversation meant to her she could not fail to guess. Pierre\nAdet had by what he said made the whole of his abominable intrigue\nagainst her palpably clear. Her father had been right, after all. It was\nPierre Adet who through some clever trickery had lured her to this place\nof evil. How it was all done she could not guess. The message ... the\ndevice ... her walk across the street ... the silence ... the mysterious\nguide ... which of these had been the trickery?... which had been\nconcocted by her enemy?... which devised by her dear milor?\n\nEnough that the whole thing was a trap, a trap all the more hideous as\nshe, Yvonne, who would have given her heart's blood for her beloved, was\nobviously the bait wherewith these friends meant to capture him and his\nnoble chief. They knew evidently of the presence of the gallant Scarlet\nPimpernel and his band of heroes here in Nantes--they seemed to expect\ntheir appearance at this abominable place to-night. She, Yvonne, was to\nbe the decoy which was to lure to this hideous lair those noble eagles\nwho were still out of reach.\n\nAnd if that was so--if indeed her beloved and his valiant friends had\nfollowed her hither, then some part of the message of hope must have\ncome from them or from their chief ... and milor and his friend must\neven now be somewhere close by, watching their opportunity to come to\nher rescue ... heedless of the awful danger which lay in wait for them\n... ignorant mayhap of the abominable trap which had been so cunningly\nset for them by these astute and ferocious brutes.\n\nYvonne a prisoner in this narrow space, clinging to the bars of what was\nperhaps the most cruel prison in which she had yet been confined,\nbruised her hands and arms against those bars in a wild desire to get\nout. She longed with all her might to utter one long, loud and piercing\ncry of warning to her dear milor not to come nigh her now, to fly, to\nrun while there was yet time; and all the while she knew that if she did\nutter such a cry he would hurry hot-haste to her side. One moment she\nwould have had him near--another she wished him an hundred miles away.\n\n\nIV\n\nIn the tap-room a more ordered medley of sounds had followed on the wild\npandemonium of awhile ago. Brief, peremptory words of command, steady\ntramping of feet, loud harsh questions and subdued answers, occasionally\na moan or a few words of protest quickly suppressed, came through the\npartition to Yvonne's straining ears.\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"Your occupation?\"\n\n\"That's enough. Silence. The next.\"\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\nMen, women and even children were being questioned, classified, packed\noff, God knew whither. Sometimes a child would cry, a man utter an oath,\na woman shriek: then would come harsh orders delivered in a gruff voice,\nmore swearing, the grounding of arms and more often than not a dull,\nflat sound like a blow struck against human flesh, followed by a volley\nof curses, or a cry of pain.\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"George Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 Lemoine.\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"In this house.\"\n\n\"Your occupation?\"\n\n\"I am the proprietor of the tavern, citizen. I am an honest man and a\npatriot. The Republic....\"\n\n\"That's enough.\"\n\n\"But I protest.\"\n\n\"Silence. The next.\"\n\nAll with dreary, ceaseless monotony: and Yvonne like a trapped bird was\nbruising her wings against the bars of her cage. Outside the window\nChauvelin and Martin-Roget were still speaking in whispers: the fowlers\nwere still watching for their prey. The third man had apparently gone\naway. What went on beyond the range of her prison window--out in the\ndarkness of the night which Yvonne's aching eyes could not pierce--she,\nthe miserable watcher, the bait set here to catch the noble game, could\nnot even conjecture. The window was small and her vision was further\nobstructed by heavy bars. She could see nothing--hear nothing save those\ntwo men talking in whispers. Now and again she caught a few words:\n\n\"A little while longer, citizen ... you lose nothing by waiting. Your\nKernogans are safe enough. Paul Friche has assured you that the landing\nwhere they are now has no egress save through the tap-room, and to the\nfloor above. Wait at least until commandant Fleury has got the crowd\ntogether, after which he will send his Marats to search the house. It\nwon't be too late then to lay hands on your aristos, if in the\nmeanwhile....\"\n\n\"'Tis futile to wait,\" here interrupted Martin-Roget roughly, \"and you\nare a fool, citizen, if you think that those Englishmen exist elsewhere\nthan in your imagination.\"\n\n\"Hark!\" broke in the gentle voice abruptly and with forceful command.\n\nAnd as Yvonne too in instinctive response to that peremptory call was\nfurther straining her every sense in order to listen, there came from\nsomewhere, not very far away, right through the stillness of the night,\na sound which caused her pulses to still their beating and her throat to\nchoke with the cry which rose from her breast.\n\nIt was only the sound of a quaint and drawly voice saying loudly and in\nEnglish:\n\n\"Egad, Tony! ain't you getting demmed sleepy?\"\n\nJust for the space of two or three seconds Yvonne had remained quite\nstill while this unexpected sound sent its dulcet echo on the wings of\nthe north-westerly blast. The next--stumbling in the dark--she had run\nto the stairs even while she heard Martin-Roget calling loudly and\nexcitedly to Paul Friche.\n\nOne reverent pause beside her dead father, one mute prayer commending\nhis soul to the mercy of his Maker, one agonised entreaty to God to\nprotect her beloved and his friend, and then she ran swiftly up the\nwinding steps.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, immediately in front of her, a door--slightly\najar--showed a feeble light through its aperture. Yvonne pushed the door\nfurther open and slipped into the room beyond. She did not pause to look\nround but went straight to the window and throwing open the rickety sash\nshe peeped out. For the moment she felt that she would gladly have\nbartered away twenty years of her life to know exactly whence had come\nthat quaint and drawling voice. She leaned far out of the window trying\nto see. It gave on the side of the Rat Mort over against Louise Adet's\nhouse--the space below seemed to her to be swarming with men: there were\nhurried and whispered calls--orders were given to stand at close\nattention, whilst Martin-Roget had apparently been questioning Paul\nFriche, for Yvonne heard the latter declare emphatically:\n\n\"I am certain that it came either from inside the house or from the\nroof. And with your permission, citizen, I would like to make assurance\ndoubly sure.\"\n\nThen one of the men must suddenly have caught sight of the vague\nsilhouette leaning out of the window, for Martin-Roget and Friche\nuttered a simultaneous cry, whilst Chauvelin said hurriedly:\n\n\"You are right, citizen, something is going on inside the house.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" queried Martin-Roget excitedly.\n\n\"Nothing for the moment but wait. The Englishmen are caught sure enough\nlike rats in their holes.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" ejaculated Martin-Roget with a savage oath, \"wait! always wait!\nwhile the quarry slips through one's fingers.\"\n\n\"It shall not slip through mine,\" retorted Paul Friche. \"I was a\nsteeple-jack by trade in my day: it won't be the first time that I have\nclimbed the side of a house by the gutter-pipe. _A moi_ Jean-Pierre,\" he\nadded, \"and may I be drowned in the Loire if between us two we do not\nlay those cursed English spies low.\"\n\n\"An hundred francs for each of you,\" called Chauvelin lustily, \"if you\nsucceed.\"\n\nYvonne did not think to close the window again. Vigorous shouting and\nlaughter from below testified that that hideous creature Friche and his\nmate had put their project in immediate execution; she turned and ran\ndown the stairs--feeling now like an animal at bay; by the time that she\nhad reached the bottom, she heard a prolonged, hoarse cry of triumph\nfrom below and guessed that Paul Friche and his mate had reached the\nwindow-sill: the next moment there was a crash overhead of broken\nwindow-glass and of furniture kicked from one end of the room to the\nother, immediately followed by the sound of heavy footsteps running\nhelter-skelter down the stairs.\n\nYvonne, half-crazed with terror, faint and sick, fell unconscious over\nthe body of her father.\n\n\nV\n\nInside the tap-room commandant Fleury was still at work.\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"Your occupation?\"\n\nThe low room was filled to suffocation: the walls lined with Marats, the\ndoors and windows which were wide open were closely guarded, whilst in\nthe corner of the room, huddled together like bales of rubbish, was the\nhuman cattle that had been driven together, preparatory to being sent\nfor a trial to Paris in vindication of Carrier's brutalities against the\ncity.\n\nFleury for form's sake made entries in a notebook--the whole thing was a\nmere farce--these wretched people were not likely to get a fair\ntrial--what did the whole thing matter? Still! the commandant of the\nMarats went solemnly through the farce which Carrier had invented with a\nview to his own justification.\n\nLemoine and his wife had protested and been silenced: men had struggled\nand women had fought--some of them like wild cats--in trying to get\naway. Now there were only half a dozen or so more to docket. Fleury\nswore, for he was tired and hot.\n\n\"This place is like a pest-house,\" he said.\n\nJust then came the sound of that lusty cry of triumph from outside,\nfollowed by all the clatter and the breaking of window glass.\n\n\"What's that?\" queried Fleury.\n\nThe heavy footsteps running down the stairs caused him to look up from\nhis work and to call briefly to a sergeant of the Marats who stood\nbeside his chair:\n\n\"Go and see what that _sacr\u00c3\u00a9_ row is about,\" he commanded. \"In there,\"\nhe added as he indicated the door of the landing with a jerk of the\nhead.\n\nBut before the man could reach the door, it was thrown open from within\nwith a vigorous kick from the point of a sabot, and Paul Friche appeared\nunder the lintel with the aristo wench thrown over his shoulder like a\nsack of potatoes, his thick, muscular arms encircling her knees. His\nscarlet bonnet was cocked over one eye, his face was smeared with dirt,\nhis breeches were torn at the knees, his shirt hung in strips from his\npowerful shoulders. Behind him his mate--who had climbed up the\ngutter-pipe into the house in his wake--was tottering under the load of\nthe ci-devant duc de Kernogan's body which he had slung across his back\nand was holding on to by the wrists.\n\nFleury jumped to his feet--the appearance of these two men, each with\nhis burden, caused him to frown with anger and to demand peremptorily:\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"The aristos,\" said Paul Friche curtly; \"they were trying to escape.\"\n\nHe strode into the room, carrying the unconscious form of the girl as if\nit were a load of feathers. He was a huge, massive-looking giant: the\ngirl's shoulders nearly touched the low ceiling as he swung forward\nfacing the angry commandant.\n\n\"How did you get into the house? and by whose orders?\" demanded Fleury\nroughly.\n\n\"Climbed in by the window, _pardi_,\" retorted the man, \"and by the\norders of citizen Martin-Roget.\"\n\n\"A corporal of the Company Marat takes orders only from me; you should\nknow that, citizen Friche.\"\n\n\"Nay!\" interposed the sergeant quickly, \"this man is not a corporal of\nthe Company Marat, citizen commandant. As for Corporal Friche, why! he\nwas taken to the infirmary some hours ago with a cracked skull, he....\"\n\n\"Not Corporal Friche,\" exclaimed Fleury with an oath, \"then who in the\ndevil's name is this man?\"\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel, at your service, citizen commandant,\" came\nloudly and with a merry laugh from the pseudo Friche.\n\nAnd before either Fleury or the sergeant or any of the Marats could even\nbegin to realise what was happening, he had literally bounded across the\nroom, and as he did so he knocked against the hanging lamp which fell\nwith a crash to the floor, scattering oil and broken glass in every\ndirection and by its fall plunging the place into total darkness. At\nonce there arose a confusion and medley of terrified screams, of\npiercing shrieks from the women and the children, and of loud\nimprecations from the men. These mingled with the hasty words of\ncommand, with quick orders from Fleury and the sergeant, with the\ngrounding of arms and the tramping of many feet, and with the fall of\nhuman bodies that happened to be in the way of the reckless adventurer\nand his flight.\n\n\"He is through the door,\" cried the men who had been there on guard.\n\n\"After him then!\" shouted Fleury. \"Curse you all for cowards and for\nfools.\"\n\nThe order had no need to be repeated. The confusion, though great, had\nonly been momentary. Within a second or less, Fleury and his sergeant\nhad fought their way through to the door, urging the men to follow.\n\n\"After him ... quick!... he is heavily loaded ... he cannot have got far\n...\" commanded Fleury as soon as he had crossed the threshold.\n\"Sergeant, keep order within, and on your life see that no one else\nescapes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE PROCONSUL\n\n\nI\n\nFrom round the angle of the house Martin-Roget and Chauvelin were\nalready speeding along at a rapid pace.\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" queried the latter hastily.\n\n\"The Englishman--with the wench on his back? have you seen him?\"\n\n\"Malediction! what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Have you seen him?\" reiterated Fleury hoarsely.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have passed you?\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Then unless some of us here have eyes like cats that limb of Satan will\nget away. On to him, my men,\" he called once more. \"Can you see him?\"\n\nThe darkness outside was intense. The north-westerly wind was whistling\ndown the narrow street, drowning the sound of every distant footfall: it\ntore mercilessly round the men's heads, snatching the bonnets from off\ntheir heads, dragging at their loose shirts and breeches, adding to the\nconfusion which already reigned.\n\n\"He went this way ...\" shouted one.\n\n\"No! that!\" cried another.\n\n\"There he is!\" came finally in chorus from several lusty throats. \"Just\ncrossing the bridge.\"\n\n\"After him,\" cried Fleury, \"an hundred francs to the man who first lays\nhands on that devil.\"\n\nThen the chase began. The Englishman on ahead was unmistakable with that\nburden on his shoulder. He had just reached the foot of the bridge where\na street lanthorn fixed on a tall bracket on the corner stone had\nsuddenly thrown him into bold relief. He had less than an hundred metres\nstart of his pursuers and with a wild cry of excitement they started in\nhis wake.\n\nHe was now in the middle of the bridge--an unmistakable figure of a\ngiant vaguely silhouetted against the light from the lanthorns on the\nfurther end of the bridge--seeming preternaturally tall and misshapen\nwith that hump upon his back.\n\nFrom right and left, from under the doorways of the houses in the\nCarrefour de la Poissonnerie the Marats who had been left on guard in\nthe street now joined in the chase. Overhead windows were thrown\nopen--the good burghers of Nantes, awakened from their sleep, forgetful\nfor the nonce of all their anxieties, their squalor and their miseries,\nleaned out to see what this new kind of din might mean. From\neverywhere--it almost seemed as if some sprang out of the earth--men,\neither of the town-guard or Marats on patrol duty, or merely idlers and\nnight hawks who happened to be about, yielded to that primeval instinct\nof brutality which causes men as well as beasts to join in a pursuit\nagainst a fellow creature.\n\nFleury was in the rear of his posse. Martin-Roget and Chauvelin, walking\nas rapidly as they could by his side, tried to glean some information\nout of the commandant's breathless and scrappy narrative:\n\n\"What happened exactly?\"\n\n\"It was the man Paul Friche ... with the aristo wench on his back ...\nand another man carrying the ci-devant aristo ... they were the English\nspies ... in disguise ... they knocked over the lamp ... and got\naway....\"\n\n\"Name of a....\"\n\n\"No use swearing, citizen Martin-Roget,\" retorted Fleury as hotly as his\nagitated movements would allow. \"You and citizen Chauvelin are\nresponsible for the affair. It was you, citizen Chauvelin, who placed\nPaul Friche inside that tavern in observation--you told him what to\ndo....\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Paul Friche--the real Paul Friche--was taken to the infirmary some\nhours ago ... with a cracked skull, dealt him by your Englishman, I've\nno doubt....\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" reiterated Chauvelin with a curse.\n\n\"Impossible? why impossible?\"\n\n\"The man I spoke to outside Le Bouffay....\"\n\n\"Was not Paul Friche.\"\n\n\"He was on guard in the Place with two other Marats.\"\n\n\"He was not Paul Friche--the others were not Marats.\"\n\n\"Then the man who was inside the tavern?...\"\n\n\"Was not Paul Friche.\"\n\n\" ... who climbed the gutter pipe ...?\"\n\n\"Malediction!\"\n\nAnd the chase continued--waxing hotter every minute. The hare had gained\nslightly on the hounds--there were more than a hundred hot on the trail\nby now--having crossed the bridge he was on the Isle Feydeau, and\nwithout hesitating a moment he plunged at once into the network of\nnarrow streets which cover the island in the rear of La Petite Hollande\nand the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de le Villestreux, where lodged Carrier, the\nrepresentative of the people. The hounds after him had lost some ground\nby halting--if only for a second or two--first at the head of the\nbridge, then at the corners of the various streets, while they peered\ninto the darkness to see which way had gone that fleet-footed hare.\n\n\"Down this way!\"\n\n\"No! That!\"\n\n\"There he goes!\"\n\nIt always took a few seconds to decide, during which the man on ahead\nwith his burden on his shoulder had time mayhap to reach the end of a\nstreet and to turn a corner and once again to plunge into darkness and\nout of sight. The street lanthorns were few in this squalid corner of\nthe city, and it was only when perforce the running hare had to cross a\ncircle of light that the hounds were able to keep hot on the trail.\n\n\"To the bridges for your lives!\" now shouted Fleury to the men nearest\nto him. \"Leave him to wander on the island. He cannot come off it,\nunless he jumps into the Loire.\"\n\nThe Marats--intelligent and ferociously keen on the chase--had already\ngrasped the importance of this order: with the bridges guarded that\nfleet-footed Englishman might run as much as he liked, he was bound to\nbe run to earth like a fox in his burrow. In a moment they had dispersed\nalong the quays, some to one bridge-head, some to another--the\nEnglishman could not double back now, and if he had already crossed to\nthe Isle Gloriette, which was not joined to the left bank of the river\nby any bridge, he would be equally caught like a rat in a trap.\n\n\"Unless he jumps into the Loire,\" reiterated Fleury triumphantly.\n\n\"The proconsul will have more excitement than he hoped for,\" he added\nwith a laugh. \"He was looking forward to the capture of the English spy,\nand in deadly terror lest he escaped. But now meseems that we shall\nrun our fox down in sight of the very gates of la Villestreux.\"\n\nMartin-Roget's thoughts ran on Yvonne and the duc.\n\n\"You will remember, citizen commandant,\" he contrived to say to Fleury,\n\"that the ci-devant Kernogans were found inside the Rat Mort.\"\n\nFleury uttered an exclamation of rough impatience. What did he, what did\nanyone care at this moment for a couple of aristos more or less when the\nnoblest game that had ever fallen to the bag of any Terrorist was so\nnear being run to earth? But Chauvelin said nothing. He walked on at a\nbrisk pace, keeping close to commandant Fleury's side, in the immediate\nwake of the pursuit. His lips were pressed tightly together and a\nhissing breath came through his wide-open nostrils. His pale eyes were\nfixed into the darkness and beyond it, where the most bitter enemy of\nthe cause which he loved was fighting his last battle against Fate.\n\n\nII\n\n\"He cannot get off the island!\" Fleury had said awhile ago. Well! there\nwas of a truth little or nothing now between the hunted hare and\ncapture. The bridges were well guarded: the island swarming with hounds,\nthe Marats at their posts and the Loire an impassable barrier all round.\n\nAnd Chauvelin, the most tenacious enemy man ever had, Fleury keen on a\nreward and Martin-Roget with a private grudge to pay off, all within two\nhundred yards behind him.\n\nTrue for the moment the Englishman had disappeared. Burden and all, the\ngloom appeared to have swallowed him up. But there was nowhere he could\ngo; mayhap he had taken refuge under a doorway in one of the narrow\nstreets and hoped perhaps under cover of the darkness to allow his\npursuers to slip past him and then to double back.\n\nFleury was laughing in the best of humours. He was gradually collecting\nall the Marats together and sending them to the bridge-heads under the\ncommand of their various sergeants. Let the Englishman spend the night\non the islands if he had a mind. There was a full company of Marats here\nto account for him as soon as he attempted to come out in the open.\n\nThe idlers and night hawks as well as the municipal town guard continued\nto run excitedly up and down the streets--sometimes there would come a\nlusty cry from a knot of pursuers who thought they spied the Englishman\nthrough the darkness, at others there would be a call of halt, and\nfeverish consultation held at a street corner as to the best policy to\nadopt.\n\nThe town guard, jealous of the Marats, were pining to lay hands on the\nEnglish spy for the sake of the reward. Fleury, coming across their\nprovost, called him a fool for his pains.\n\n\"My Marats will deal with the English spies, citizen,\" he said roughly,\n\"he is no concern of yours.\"\n\nThe provost demurred: an altercation might have ensued when Chauvelin's\nsuave voice poured oil on the troubled waters.\n\n\"Why not,\" he said, \"let the town guard continue their search on the\nisland, citizen commandant? The men may succeed in digging our rat out\nof his hole and forcing him out into the open all the sooner. Your\nMarats will have him quickly enough after that.\"\n\nTo this suggestion the provost gave a grudging assent. The reward when\nthe English spy was caught could be fought for later on. For the nonce\nhe turned unceremoniously on his heel, and left Fleury cursing him for\na meddlesome busybody.\n\n\"So long as he and his rabble does not interfere with my Marats,\"\ngrowled the commandant.\n\n\"Will you see your sergeants, citizen?\" queried Chauvelin tentatively.\n\"They will have to keep very much on the alert, and will require\nconstant prodding to their vigilance. If I can be of any service....\"\n\n\"No,\" retorted Fleury curtly, \"you and citizen Martin-Roget had best try\nand see the proconsul and tell him what we have done.\"\n\n\"He'll be half wild with terror when he hears that the English spy is at\nlarge upon the island.\"\n\n\"You must pacify him as best you can. Tell him I have a score of Marats\nat every bridge head and that I am looking personally to every\narrangement. There is no escape for the devil possible save by drowning\nhimself and the wench in the Loire.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nChauvelin and Martin-Roget turned from the quay on to the Petite\nHollande--the great open ground with its converging row of trees which\nends at the very apex of the Isle of Feydeau. Opposite to them at the\nfurther corner of the Place was the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Villestreux. One or two\nof the windows in the hotel were lighted from within. No doubt the\nproconsul was awake, trembling in the remotest angle of his lair, with\nthe spectre of assassination rampant before him--aroused by the\ncontinued disturbance of the night, by the feverishness of this man-hunt\ncarried on almost at his gates.\n\nEven through the darkness it was easy to perceive groups of people\neither rushing backwards and forwards on the Place or congregating in\ngroups under the trees. Excitement was in the air. It could be felt and\nheard right through the soughing of the north-westerly wind which caused\nthe bare branches of the trees to groan and to crackle, and the dead\nleaves, which still hung on the twigs, to fly wildly through the night.\n\nIn the centre of the Place, two small lights, gleaming like eyes in the\nmidst of the gloom, betrayed the presence of the proconsul's coach,\nwhich stood there as always, ready to take him away to a place of\nsafety--away from this city where he was mortally hated and\ndreaded--whenever the spectre of terror became more insistent than\nusual, and drove him hence out of his stronghold. The horses were pawing\nthe frozen ground and champing their bits--the steam from their nostrils\ncaught the rays of the carriage lamps, which also lit up with a feeble\nflicker the vague outline of the coachman on his box and of the\npostilion rigid in his saddle.\n\nThe citizens of Nantes were never tired of gaping at the carriage--a\nhuge C-springed barouche--at the coachman's fine caped coat of\nbottle-green cloth and at the horses with their handsome harness set off\nwith heavy brass bosses: they never tired of bandying words with the\nsuccessive coachmen as they mounted their box and gathered up the reins,\nor with the postilions who loved to crack their whips and to appear\nsmart and well-groomed, in the midst of the squalor which reigned in the\nterror-stricken city. They were the guardians of the mighty proconsul:\non their skill, quickness and presence of mind might depend his precious\nlife.\n\nEven when the shadow of death hangs over an entire community, there will\nbe some who will stand and gape and crack jokes at an uncommon sight.\n\nAnd now when the pall of night hung over the abode of the man-tiger and\nhis lair, and wrapped in its embrace the hunted and the hunters, there\nstill was a knot of people standing round the carriage--between it and\nthe hotel--gazing with lack-lustre eyes on the costly appurtenances\nwherewith the representative of a wretched people loved to surround\nhimself. They could only see the solid mass of the carriage and of the\nhorses, but they could hear the coachman clicking with his tongue and\nthe postilion cracking his whip, and these sights broke the absolute\ndreary monotony of their lives.\n\nIt was from behind this knot of gaffers that there rose gradually a\ntumult as of a man calling out in wrath and lashing himself into a fury.\nChauvelin and Martin-Roget were just then crossing La Petite Hollande\nfrom one bank of the river to the other: they were walking rapidly\ntowards the hotel, when they heard the tumult which presently culminated\nin a hoarse cry and a volley of oaths.\n\n\"My coach! my coach at once.... Lalou\u00c3\u00abt, don't leave me.... Curse you\nall for a set of cowardly oafs.... My coach I say....\"\n\n\"The proconsul,\" murmured Chauvelin as he hastened forward, Martin-Roget\nfollowing closely on his heels.\n\nBy the time that they had come near enough to the coach to distinguish\nvaguely in the gloom what was going on, people came rushing to the same\nspot from end to end of the Place. In a moment there was quite a crowd\nround the carriage, and the two men had much ado to push their way\nthrough by a vigorous play of their elbows.\n\n\"Citizen Carrier!\" cried Chauvelin at the top of his voice, trying to\ndominate the hubbub, \"one minute ... I have excellent news for you....\nThe English spy....\"\n\n\"Curse you for a set of blundering fools,\" came with a husky cry from\nout the darkness, \"you have let that English devil escape ... I knew it\n... I knew it ... the assassin is at large ... the murderer ... my coach\nat once ... my coach.... Lalou\u00c3\u00abt--do not leave me.\"\n\nChauvelin had by this time succeeded in pushing his way to the forefront\nof the crowd: Martin-Roget, tall and powerful, had effectually made a\nway for him. Through the dense gloom he could see the misshapen form of\nthe proconsul, wildly gesticulating with one arm and with the other\nclinging convulsively to young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt who already had his hand on the\nhandle of the carriage door.\n\nWith a quick, resolute gesture Chauvelin stepped between the door and\nthe advancing proconsul.\n\n\"Citizen Carrier,\" he said with calm determination, \"on my oath there is\nno cause for alarm. Your life is absolutely safe.... I entreat you to\nreturn to your lodgings....\"\n\nTo emphasise his words he had stretched out a hand and firmly grasped\nthe proconsul's coat sleeve. This gesture, however, instead of pacifying\nthe apparently terror-stricken maniac, seemed to have the effect of\nfurther exasperating his insensate fear. With a loud oath he tore\nhimself free from Chauvelin's grasp.\n\n\"Ten thousand devils,\" he cried hoarsely, \"who is this fool who dares to\ninterfere with me? Stand aside man ... stand aside or....\"\n\nAnd before Chauvelin could utter another word or Martin-Roget come to\nhis colleague's rescue, there came the sudden sharp report of a pistol;\nthe horses reared, the crowd was scattered in every direction, Chauvelin\nwas knocked over by a smart blow on the head whilst a vigorous drag on\nhis shoulder alone saved him from falling under the wheels of the coach.\n\nWhilst confusion was at its highest, the carriage door was closed to\nwith a bang and there was a loud, commanding cry hurled through the\nwindow at the coachman on his box.\n\n\"_En avant_, citizen coachman! Drive for your life! through the Savenay\ngate. The English assassins are on our heels.\"\n\nThe postilion cracked his whip. The horses, maddened by the report, by\nthe pushing, jostling crowd and the confused cries and screams around,\nplunged forward, wild with excitement. Their hoofs clattered on the hard\nroad. Some of the crowd ran after the coach across the Place, shouting\nlustily: \"The proconsul! the proconsul!\"\n\nChauvelin--dazed and bruised--was picked up by Martin-Roget.\n\n\"The cowardly brute!\" was all that he said between his teeth, \"he shall\nrue this outrage as soon as I can give my mind to his affairs. In the\nmeanwhile....\"\n\nThe clatter of the horses' hoofs was already dying away in the distance.\nFor a few seconds longer the rattle of the coach was still accompanied\nby cries of \"The proconsul! the proconsul!\" Fleury at the bridge head,\nseeing and hearing its approach, had only just time to order his Marats\nto stand at attention. A salvo should have been fired when the\nrepresentative of the people, the high and mighty proconsul, was abroad,\nbut there was no time for that, and the coach clattered over the bridge\nat breakneck speed, whilst Carrier with his head out of the window was\nhurling anathemas and insults at Fleury for having allowed the paid\nspies of that cursed British Government to threaten the life of a\nrepresentative of the people.\n\n\"I go to Savenay,\" he shouted just at the last, \"until that assassin has\nbeen thrown in the Loire. But when I return ... look to yourself\ncommandant Fleury.\"\n\nThen the carriage turned down the Quai de la Fosse and a few minutes\nlater was swallowed up by the gloom.\n\n\nIV\n\nChauvelin, supported by Martin-Roget, was hobbling back across the\nPlace. The crowd was still standing about, vaguely wondering why it had\ngot so excited over the departure of the proconsul and the rattle of a\ncoach and pair across the bridge, when on the island there was still an\nassassin at large--an English spy, the capture of whom would be one of\nthe great events in the chronicles of the city of Nantes.\n\n\"I think,\" said Martin-Roget, \"that we may as well go to bed now, and\nleave the rest to commandant Fleury. The Englishman may not be captured\nfor some hours, and I for one am over-fatigued.\"\n\n\"Then go to bed an you desire, citizen Martin-Roget,\" retorted Chauvelin\ndrily, \"I for one will stay here until I see the Englishman in the hands\nof commandant Fleury.\"\n\n\"Hark,\" interposed Martin-Roget abruptly. \"What was that?\"\n\nChauvelin had paused even before Martin-Roget's restraining hand had\nrested on his arm. He stood still in the middle of the Place and his\nknees shook under him so that he nearly fell prone to the ground.\n\n\"What is it?\" reiterated Martin-Roget with vague puzzlement. \"It sounds\nlike young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt's voice.\"\n\nChauvelin said nothing. He had forgotten his bruises: he no longer\nhobbled--he ran across the Place to the front of the hotel whence the\nvoice had come which was so like that of young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt.\n\nThe youngster--it was undoubtedly he--was standing at the angle of the\nhotel: above him a lanthorn threw a dim circle of light on his bare head\nwith its mass of dark curls, and on a small knot of idlers with two or\nthree of the town guard amongst them. The first words spoken by him\nwhich Chauvelin distinguished quite clearly were:\n\n\"You are all mad ... or else drunk.... The citizen proconsul is upstairs\nin his room.... He has just sent me down to hear what news there is of\nthe English spies....\"\n\n\nV\n\nNo one made reply. It seemed as if some giant and spectral hand had\npassed over this mass of people and with its magic touch had stilled\ntheir turbulent passions, silenced their imprecations and cooled their\nardour--and left naught but a vague fear, a subtle sense of awe as when\nsomething unexplainable and supernatural has manifested itself before\nthe eyes of men.\n\nFrom far away the roll of coach wheels rapidly disappearing in the\ndistance alone broke the silence of the night.\n\n\"Is there no one here who will explain what all this means?\" queried\nyoung Lalou\u00c3\u00abt, who alone had remained self-assured and calm, for he\nalone knew nothing of what had happened. \"Citizen Fleury, are you\nthere?\"\n\nThen as once again he received no reply, he added peremptorily:\n\n\"Hey! some one there! Are you all louts and oafs that not one of you can\nspeak?\"\n\nA timid voice from the rear ventured on explanation.\n\n\"The citizen proconsul was here a moment ago.... We all saw him, and you\ncitizen Lalou\u00c3\u00abt were with him....\"\n\nAn imprecation from young Lalou\u00c3\u00abt silenced the timid voice for the\nnonce ... and then another resumed the halting narrative.\n\n\"We all could have sworn that we saw you, citizen Lalou\u00c3\u00abt, also the\ncitizen proconsul.... He got into his coach with you ... you ... that is\n... they have driven off....\"\n\n\"This is some awful and treacherous hoax,\" cried the youngster now in a\ntowering passion; \"the citizen proconsul is upstairs in bed, I tell you\n... and I have only just come out of the hotel ...! Name of a name of a\ndog! am I standing here or am I not?\"\n\nThen suddenly he bethought himself of the many events of the day which\nhad culminated in this gigantic feat of leger-de-main.\n\n\"Chauvelin!\" he exclaimed. \"Where in the name of h----ll is citizen\nChauvelin?\"\n\nBut Chauvelin for the moment could nowhere be found. Dazed,\nhalf-unconscious, wholly distraught, he had fled from the scene of his\ndiscomfiture as fast as his trembling knees would allow. Carrier\nsearched the city for him high and low, and for days afterwards the\nsoldiers of the Compagnie Marat gave aristos and rebels a rest: they\nwere on the look-out for a small, wizened figure of a man--the man with\nthe pale, keen eyes who had failed to recognise in the pseudo-Paul\nFriche, in the dirty, out-at-elbows _sans-culotte_--the most exquisite\ndandy that had ever graced the salons of Bath and of London: they were\nsearching for the man with the acute and sensitive brain who had failed\nto scent in the pseudo-Carrier and the pseudo-Lalou\u00c3\u00abt his old and arch\nenemy Sir Percy Blakeney and the charming wife of my lord Anthony\nDewhurst.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nLORD TONY\n\n\nI\n\nA quarter of an hour later citizen-commandant Fleury was at last ushered\ninto the presence of the proconsul and received upon his truly innocent\nhead the full torrent of the despot's wrath. But Martin-Roget had\nlistened to the counsels of prudence: for obvious reasons he desired to\navoid any personal contact for the moment with Carrier, whom fear of the\nEnglish spies had made into a more abject and more craven tyrant than\never before. At the same time he thought it wisest to try and pacify the\nbrute by sending him the ten thousand francs--the bribe agreed upon for\nhis help in the undertaking which had culminated in such a disastrous\nfailure.\n\nAt the self-same hour whilst Carrier--fuming and swearing--was for the\nhundredth time uttering that furious \"How?\" which for the hundredth time\nhad remained unanswered, two men were taking leave of one another at the\nsmall postern gate which gives on the cemetery of St. Anne. The taller\nand younger one of the two had just dropped a heavy purse into the hand\nof the other. The latter stooped and kissed the kindly hand.\n\n\"Milor,\" he said, \"I swear to you most solemnly that M. le duc de\nKernogan will rest in peace in hallowed ground. M. le cur\u00c3\u00a9 de\nVertou--ah! he is a saint and a brave man, milor--comes over whenever he\ncan prudently do so and reads the offices for the dead--over those who\nhave died as Christians, and there is a piece of consecrated ground out\nhere in the open which those fiends of Terrorists have not discovered\nyet.\"\n\n\"And you will bury M. le duc immediately,\" admonished the younger man,\n\"and apprise M. le cur\u00c3\u00a9 of what has happened.\"\n\n\"Aye! aye! I'll do that, milor, within the hour. Though M. le duc was\nnever a very kind master to me in the past, I cannot forget that I\nserved him and his family for over thirty years as coachman. I drove\nMlle. Yvonne in the first pony-cart she ever possessed. I drove her--ah!\nthat was a bitter day!--her and M. le duc when they left Kernogan never\nto return. I drove Mlle. Yvonne on that memorable night when a crowd of\nmiserable peasants attacked her coach, and that brute Pierre Adet\nstarted to lead a rabble against the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau. That was the beginning of\nthings, milor. God alone knows what has happened to Pierre Adet. His\nfather Jean was hanged by order of M. le duc. Now M. le duc is destined\nto lie in a forgotten grave. I serve this abominable Republic by digging\ngraves for her victims. I would be happier, I think, if I knew what had\nbecome of Mlle. Yvonne.\"\n\n\"Mlle. Yvonne is my wife, old friend,\" said the younger man softly.\n\"Please God she has years of happiness before her, if I succeed in\nmaking her forget all that she has suffered.\"\n\n\"Amen to that, milor!\" rejoined the man fervently. \"Then I pray you tell\nthe noble lady to rest assured. Jean-Marie--her old coachman whom she\nused to trust implicitly in the past--will see that M. le duc de\nKernogan is buried as a gentleman and a Christian should be.\"\n\n\"You are not running too great a risk by this, I hope, my good\nJean-Marie,\" quoth Lord Tony gently.\n\n\"No greater risk, milor,\" replied Jean-Marie earnestly, \"than the one\nwhich you ran by carrying my old master's dead body on your shoulders\nthrough the streets of Nantes.\"\n\n\"Bah! that was simple enough,\" said the younger man, \"the hue and cry is\nafter higher quarry to-night. Pray God the hounds have not run the noble\ngame to earth.\"\n\nEven as he spoke there came from far away through the darkness the sound\nof a fast trotting pair of horses and the rumble of coach-wheels on the\nunpaved road.\n\n\"There they are, thank God!\" exclaimed Lord Tony, and the tremor in his\nvoice alone betrayed the torturing anxiety which he had been enduring,\never since he had seen the last both of his adored young wife and of his\ngallant chief in the squalid tap-room of the Rat Mort.\n\nWith the dead body of Yvonne's father on his back he had quietly worked\nhis way out of the tavern in the wake of his chief. He had his orders,\nand for the members of that gallant League of the Scarlet Pimpernel\nthere was no such word as \"disobedience\" and no such word as \"fail.\"\nThrough the darkness and through the tortuous streets of Nantes Lord\nAnthony Dewhurst--the young and wealthy exquisite, the hero of an\nhundred f\u00c3\u00aates and galas in Bath, in London--staggered under the weight\nof a burden imposed upon him only by his loyalty and a noble sense of\nself-prescribed discipline--and that burden the dead body of the man who\nhad done him an unforgivable wrong. Without a thought of revolt he had\nobeyed--and risked his life and worse in the obedience.\n\nThe darkness of the night was his faithful handmaiden, and the\nexcitement of the chase after the other quarry had fortunately drawn\nevery possible enemy from his track. He had set his teeth and\naccomplished his task, and even the deathly anxiety for the wife whom he\nidolised had been crushed, under the iron heel of a grim resolve. Now\nhis work was done, and from far away he heard the rattle of the coach\nwheels which were bringing his beloved nearer and nearer to him.\n\nFive minutes longer and the coach came to a halt. A cheery voice called\nout gaily:\n\n\"Tony! are you there?\"\n\n\"Percy!\" exclaimed the young man.\n\nAlready he knew that all was well. The gallant leader, the loyal and\nloving friend, had taxed every resource of a boundlessly fertile brain\nin order to win yet another wreath of immortal laurels for the League\nwhich he commanded, and the very tone of his merry voice proclaimed the\ntriumph which had crowned his daring scheme.\n\nThe next moment Yvonne lay in the arms of her dear milor. He had stepped\ninto the carriage, even while Sir Percy climbed nimbly on the box and\ntook the reins from the bewildered coachman's hands.\n\n\"Citizen proconsul ...\" murmured the latter, who of a truth thought that\nhe was dreaming.\n\n\"Get off the box, you old noodle,\" quoth the pseudo-proconsul\nperemptorily. \"Thou and thy friend the postilion will remain here in the\nroad, and on the morrow you'll explain to whomsoever it may concern that\nthe English spy made a murderous attack on you both and left you half\ndead outside the postern gate of the cemetery of Ste. Anne. Here,\" he\nadded as he threw a purse down to the two men--who half-dazed and\novercome by superstitious fear had indeed scrambled down, one from his\nbox, the other from his horse--\"there's a hundred francs for each of\nyou in there, and mind you drink to the health of the English spy and\nthe confusion of your brutish proconsul.\"\n\nThere was no time to lose: the horses--still very fresh--were fretting\nto start.\n\n\"Where do we pick up Hastings and Ffoulkes?\" asked Sir Percy Blakeney\nfinally as he turned toward the interior of the barouche, the hood of\nwhich hid its occupants from view.\n\n\"At the corner of the rue de Gigan,\" came the quick answer. \"It is only\ntwo hundred metres from the city gate. They are on the look out for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Ffoulkes shall be postilion,\" rejoined Sir Percy with a laugh, \"and\nHastings sit beside me on the box. And you will see how at the city gate\nand all along the route soldiers of the guard will salute the equipage\nof the all-powerful proconsul of Nantes. By Gad!\" he added under his\nbreath, \"I've never had a merrier time in all my life--not even\nwhen....\"\n\nHe clicked his tongue and gave the horses their heads--and soon the\ncoachman and the postilion and Jean-Marie the gravedigger of the\ncemetery of Ste. Anne were left gaping out into the night in the\ndirection where the barouche had so quickly disappeared.\n\n\"Now for Le Croisic and the _Day-Dream_,\" sighed the daring adventurer\ncontentedly, \"... and for Marguerite!\" he added wistfully.\n\n\nII\n\nUnder the hood of the barouche Yvonne, wearied but immeasurably happy,\nwas doing her best to answer all her dear milor's impassioned questions\nand to give him a fairly clear account of that terrible chase and\nflight through the streets of the Isle Feydeau.\n\n\"Ah, milor, how can I tell you what I felt when I realised that I was\nbeing carried along in the arms of the valiant Scarlet Pimpernel? A word\nfrom him and I understood. After that I tried to be both resourceful and\nbrave. When the chase after us was at its hottest we slipped into a\nruined and deserted house. In a room at the back there were several\nbundles of what looked like old clothes. 'This is my store-house,' milor\nsaid to me; 'now that we have reached it we can just make long noses at\nthe whole pack of bloodhounds.' He made me slip into some boy's clothes\nwhich he gave me, and whilst I donned these he disappeared. When he\nreturned I truly did not recognise him. He looked horrible, and his\nvoice ...! After a moment or two he laughed, and then I knew him. He\nexplained to me the r\u00c3\u00b4le which I was to play, and I did my best to obey\nhim in everything. But oh! I hardly lived while we once more emerged\ninto the open street and then turned into the great Place which was\nfull--oh full!--of people. I felt that at every moment we might be\nsuspected. Figure to yourself, my dear milor....\"\n\nWhat Yvonne Dewhurst was about to say next will never be recorded.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":878,"split":"train"}
