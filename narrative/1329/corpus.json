Not to look back to earlier times of battles and sieges,\nhere is the bust of Rousseau--here is a house with an inscription\ndenoting that the Genevan philosopher first drew breath under its\nroof. A little out of the town is Ferney, the residence of Voltaire;\nwhere that wonderful, though certainly in many respects contemptible,\ncharacter, received, like the hermits of old, the visits of pilgrims,\nnot only from his own nation, but from the farthest boundaries of\nEurope. Here too is Bonnet's abode, and, a few steps beyond, the house\nof that astonishing woman Madame de Stael: perhaps the first of her\nsex, who has really proved its often claimed equality with, the nobler\nman. We have before had women who have written interesting novels and\npoems, in which their tact at observing drawing-room characters has\navailed them; but never since the days of Heloise have those faculties\nwhich are peculiar to man, been developed as the possible inheritance\nof woman. Though even here, as in the case of Heloise, our sex have\nnot been backward in alledging the existence of an Abeilard in the\nperson of M. Schlegel as the inspirer of her works. But to proceed:\nupon the same side of the lake, Gibbon, Bonnivard, Bradshaw, and\nothers mark, as it were, the stages for our progress; whilst upon the\nother side there is one house, built by Diodati, the friend of Milton,\nwhich has contained within its walls, for several months, that poet\nwhom we have so often read together, and who--if human passions remain\nthe same, and human feelings, like chords, on being swept by nature's\nimpulses shall vibrate as before--will be placed by posterity in the\nfirst rank of our English Poets. You must have heard, or the Third\nCanto of Childe Harold will have informed you, that Lord Byron resided\nmany months in this neighbourhood. I went with some friends a few days\nago, after having seen Ferney, to view this mansion. I trod the floors\nwith the same feelings of awe and respect as we did, together, those\nof Shakespeare's dwelling at Stratford. I sat down in a chair of the\nsaloon, and satisfied myself that I was resting on what he had made\nhis constant seat. I found a servant there who had lived with him;\nshe, however, gave me but little information. She pointed out his\nbed-chamber upon the same level as the saloon and dining-room, and\ninformed me that he retired to rest at three, got up at two, and\nemployed himself a long time over his toilette; that he never went to\nsleep without a pair of pistols and a dagger by his side, and that he\nnever ate animal food. He apparently spent some part of every day upon\nthe lake in an English boat. There is a balcony from the saloon which\nlooks upon the lake and the mountain Jura; and I imagine, that it must\nhave been hence, he contemplated the storm so magnificently described\nin the Third Canto; for you have from here a most extensive view of\nall the points he has therein depicted. I can fancy him like the\nscathed pine, whilst all around was sunk to repose, still waking to\nobserve, what gave but a weak image of the storms which had desolated\nhis own breast.\n\n  The sky is changed!--and such a change; Oh, night!\n  And storm and darkness, ye are wond'rous strong,\n  Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light\n  Of a dark eye in woman! Far along\n  From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,\n  Leaps the lire thunder! Not from one lone cloud,\n  But every mountain now hath found a tongue,\n  And Jura answers thro' her misty shroud,\n  Back to the joyous Alps who call to her aloud!\n\n  And this is in the night:--Most glorious night!\n  Thou wer't not sent for slumber! let me be\n  A sharer in thy far and fierce delight,--\n  A portion of the tempest and of me!\n  How the lit lake shines a phosphoric sea,\n  And the big rain comet dancing to the earth!\n  And now again 'tis black,--and now the glee\n  Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,\n  As if they did rejoice o'er a young; earthquake's birth,\n\n  Now where the swift Rhine cleaves his way between\n  Heights which appear, as lovers who have parted\n  In haste, whose mining depths so intervene,\n  That they can meet no more, tho' broken hearted;\n  Tho' in their souls which thus each other thwarted,\n  Love was the very root of the fond rage\n  Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed--\n  Itself expired, but leaving; them an age\n  Of years all winter--war within themselves to wage.\n\nI went down to the little port, if I may use the expression, wherein\nhis vessel used to lay, and conversed with the cottager, who had the\ncare of it. You may smile, but I have my pleasure in thus helping my\npersonification of the individual I admire, by attaining to the\nknowledge of those circumstances which were daily around him. I have\nmade numerous enquiries in the town concerning him, but can learn\nnothing. He only went into society there once, when M. Pictet took him\nto the house of a lady to spend the evening. They say he is a very\nsingular man, and seem to think him very uncivil. Amongst other things\nthey relate, that having invited M. Pictet and Bonstetten to dinner,\nhe went on the lake to Chillon, leaving a gentleman who travelled with\nhim to receive them and make his apologies. Another evening, being\ninvited to the house of Lady D---- H----, he promised to attend,\nbut upon approaching the windows of her ladyship's villa, and\nperceiving the room to be full of company, he set down his friend,\ndesiring him to plead his excuse, and immediately returned home. This\nwill serve as a contradiction to the report which you tell me is\ncurrent in England, of his having been avoided by his countrymen on\nthe continent. The case happens to be directly the reverse, as he has\nbeen generally sought by them, though on most occasions, apparently\nwithout success. It is said, indeed, that upon paying his first visit\nat Coppet, following the servant who had announced his name, he was\nsurprised to meet a lady carried out fainting; but before he had been\nseated many minutes, the same lady, who had been so affected at the\nsound of his name, returned and conversed with him a considerable\ntime--such is female curiosity and affectation! He visited Coppet\nfrequently, and of course associated there with several of his\ncountrymen, who evinced no reluctance to meet him whom his enemies\nalone would represent as an outcast.\n\nThough I have been so unsuccessful in this town, I have been more\nfortunate in my enquiries elsewhere. There is a society three or four\nmiles from Geneva, the centre of which is the Countess of Breuss, a\nRussian lady, well acquainted with the agr\u00c3\u00a9mens de la Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9, and who\nhas collected them round herself at her mansion. It was chiefly here,\nI find, that the gentleman who travelled with Lord Byron, as\nphysician, sought for society. He used almost every day to cross the\nlake by himself, in one of their flat-bottomed boats, and return after\npassing the evening with his friends, about eleven or twelve at night,\noften whilst the storms were raging in the circling summits of the\nmountains around. As he became intimate, from long acquaintance, with\nseveral of the families in this neighbourhood, I have gathered from\ntheir accounts some excellent traits of his lordship's character,\nwhich I will relate to you at some future opportunity. I must,\nhowever, free him from one imputation attached to him--of having in\nhis house two sisters as the partakers of his revels. This is, like\nmany other charges which have been brought against his lordship,\nentirely destitute of truth. His only companion was the physician I\nhave already mentioned. The report originated from the following\ncircumstance: Mr. Percy Bysshe Shelly, a gentleman well known for\nextravagance of doctrine, and for his daring, in their profession,\neven to sign himself with the title of ATHeos in the Album at\nChamouny, having taken a house below, in which he resided with Miss M.\nW. Godwin and Miss Clermont, (the daughters of the celebrated Mr.\nGodwin) they were frequently visitors at Diodati, and were often seen\nupon the lake with his Lordship, which gave rise to the report, the\ntruth of which is here positively denied.\n\nAmong other things which the lady, from whom I procured these\nanecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story\nby Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord B., Mr. P. B. Shelly,\nthe two ladies and the gentleman before alluded to, after having\nperused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana, began\nrelating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning\nof Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of\nMr. Shelly's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the\nroom. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him\nleaning against a mantle-piece, with cold drops of perspiration\ntrickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh\nhim, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his\nwild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies\nwith eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he\nlived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the\nimpression. It was afterwards proposed, in the course of conversation,\nthat each of the company present should write a tale depending upon\nsome supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord B., the\nphysician, and Miss M. W. Godwin.[1] My friend, the lady above\nreferred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these\nstories; I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them\nto you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself,\nto peruse the ebauches of so great a genius, and those immediately\nunder his influence.\"\n\n\n\n[1] Since published under the title of \"Frankenstein; or, The Modern\nPrometheus.\"\n\n\n\n\n                             THE VAMPYRE.\n  ________________________________________________________________\n\n                            INTRODUCTION.\n                              __________\n\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in\nthe East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not,\nhowever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of\nChristianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the\ndivision of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea\nbecoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in\ntheir territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of\nmany wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their\ngraves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the\nWest it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland,\nAustria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly\nimbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became\nemaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions;\nwhilst these human blood-suckers fattened--and their veins became\ndistended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow\nfrom all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of\ntheir skins.\n\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course,\ncredible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to\nhave occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an\nexamination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place,\nthey positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years\nbefore, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say,\nthat, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been\ntormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the\nevil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and\nrubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not\nprevent him from becoming a vampyre[2] himself; for, about twenty or\nthirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of\nhaving been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four\npersons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further\nmischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni,[3] took up\nthe body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of\nvampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at\nthe mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been\nthus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was\ndriven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he\nis reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive.\nThis done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes\ninto his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of\nthose persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they\nshould, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\n\n\n\n[2] The universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a\nvampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\n\n[3] Chief bailiff.\n\n\n\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better\nadapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any\nother instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is\nconsidered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime\ncommitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to\nvampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to\nthose beings he loved most while upon earth--those to whom he was bound\nby ties of kindred and affection.--A supposition alluded to in the\n\"Giaour.\"\n\n  But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\n  Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\n  Then ghastly haunt the native place,\n  And suck the blood of all thy race;\n  There from thy daughter, sister, wife,\n  At midnight drain the stream of life;\n  Yet loathe the banquet which perforce\n  Must feed thy livid living corse,\n  Thy victims, ere they yet expire,\n  Shall know the demon for their sire;\n  As cursing thee, thou cursing them,\n  Thy flowers are withered on the stem.\n  But one that for thy crime must fall,\n  The youngest, best beloved of all,\n  Shall bless thee with a father's name--\n  That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\n  Yet thou must end thy task and mark\n  Her cheek's last tinge--her eye's last spark,\n  And the last glassy glance must view\n  Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\n  Then with unhallowed hand shall tear\n  The tresses of her yellow hair,\n  Of which, in life a lock when shorn\n  Affection's fondest pledge was worn--\n  But now is borne away by thee\n  Memorial of thine agony!\n  Yet with thine own best blood shall drip;\n  Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\n  Then stalking to thy sullen grave,\n  Go--and with Gouls and Afrits rave,\n  Till these in horror shrink away\n  From spectre more accursed than they.\n\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of\n\"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is\nrepresented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of\ntormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be\nsupposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being\npourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of\npurity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in\nhis travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he\npretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work\nupon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary\nnarratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned\ndissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as\nbarbarian error.\n\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible\nsuperstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the\nlimits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may\nnow be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is\nthe one in most general acceptation, there are several others\nsynonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as\nVroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\n\n\n  ________________________________________________________________\n\n                             THE VAMPYRE.\n                              __________\n\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a\nLondon winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of\nthe ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his\nrank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not\nparticipate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only\nattracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw\nfear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt\nthis sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some\nattributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's\nface, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through\nto the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a\nleaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His\npeculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to\nsee him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and\nnow felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in\ntheir presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the\ndeadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from\nthe blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though\nits form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after\nnotoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some\nmarks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the\nmockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage,\nthrew herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a\nmountebank, to attract his notice:--though in vain:--when she\nstood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's,\nstill it seemed as if they were unperceived;--even her unappalled\nimpudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common\nadultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was\nnot that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the\napparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent\ndaughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had,\nhowever, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that\nit even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they\nwere moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those\nfemales who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues,\nas among those who sully it by their vices.\n\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the\nname of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the\npossession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in\nchildhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their\nduty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the\nmore important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns,\nhe cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence,\nthat high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so\nmany milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with\nvirtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for\nthe picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought\nthat the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of\nclothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the\npainter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches.\nHe thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of\nlife. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his\nentering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving\nwhich should describe with least truth their languishing or romping\nfavourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening\ncountenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he\nopened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and\nhis merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours,\nhe was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles\nthat flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of\nsnuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that\ncongeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those\nvolumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some\ncompensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his\ndreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed\nhim in his career.\n\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the\ncharacter of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other\nsigns of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to\ntheir existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing\nhis imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity\nto extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a\nromance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather\nthan the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him\nattentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was\nalways recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs\nwere embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in\n---- Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some\ninformation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had\nonly whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was\ntime for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been\nthought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the\ncareer of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the\naged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies,\nwhenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of\npleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in\ncarrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning\nhis intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a\nproposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him,\nwho, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly\naccepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\n\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's\ncharacter, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions\nwere exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions\nfrom the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse\nin his liberality;--the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received\nfrom his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But\nAubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous,\nreduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue,\nthat he bestowed his alms;--these were sent from the door with\nhardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask\nsomething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his\nlust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away\nwith rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater\nimportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring\nbashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about\nthe charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his\nmind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there\nwas a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or\nsunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other\ntowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent\neagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all\nfashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro\ntable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the\nknown sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he\ngained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he\ngenerally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he\nencountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a\nnumerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law--this\napparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled\nwith more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the\nhalf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth,\ntorn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a\ndungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend;\nwhilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute\nhungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth,\nwherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet\nhe took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the\nruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the\nconvulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a\ncertain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of\ncombating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to\nrepresent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and\npleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own\nprofit;--but he delayed it--for each day he hoped his friend would\ngive him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him;\nhowever, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst\nthe various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his\neye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of\nhis curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the\nconstant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to\nhis exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something\nsupernatural.\n\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his\ncompanion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of\nan Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of\nanother almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters\narrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first\nwas from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were\nfrom his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before\nentered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in\nhis companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the\nbelief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his\nfriend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that\nthe possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his\nlicentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered,\nthat his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of\nher character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification,\nthat his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the\npinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and\ndegradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought,\napparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure,\nthrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole\ndeformity of their vices to the public gaze.\n\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown\na single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent\nsome plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in\nthe mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight\ncircumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and\nsoon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the\ninexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly\nfrequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met\nwith in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in\nsecret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon\ndiscovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most\nlikely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing\nno time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked\nhim his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same\ntime that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night.\nLord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed\nall would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether\nhe intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and,\nimmediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must\ndecline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed\ntour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling\nupon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only\nwith regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his\nLordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely\nsent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but\ndid not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's\ninterposition.\n\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and\ncrossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed\nhis residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in\ntracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that\napparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before\nslaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many\ncoloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so\nbeautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a\npainter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the\nfaithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind\nfor any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As\nshe danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one\nwould have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who\nwould have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature,\nfor that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste\nof an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in\nhis search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl,\nengaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty\nof her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of\nhim, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost\neffaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often\nwould her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's\nray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well\nexcuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his\nmind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the\nproper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to\ndescribe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?--It was\ninnocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and\nstifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to\npreserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and\nwatch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her\nnative place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon\nthe open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of\nyouthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her\ninfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a\ngreater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural\ntales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she\nnarrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told\nhim the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his\nfriends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life\nof a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months,\nhis blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such\nidle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old\nmen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after\nseveral of their near relatives and children had been found marked\nwith the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so\nincredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been,\nremarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always\nhad some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and\nheartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the\ntraditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was\nincreased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven;\nhe, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no\ntruth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many\ncoincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the\nsupernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\n\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence,\nso contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he\nhad sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he\nridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an\nuneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached\nto the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times\nfrom her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would\ndepart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he\nalways found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around\nhim, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the\nrightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his\nlove, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known.\nShe always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because\nshe had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite\nhaunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering\nsome fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She\nhad appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both,\nwith several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at\nthe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of\nhis excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they\nheard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to\nreturn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no\nGreek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any\nconsideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in\ntheir nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as\nimpending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of\ntheir representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but\nwhen he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior,\ninfernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood\nfreeze, he was silent.\n\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was\nsurprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was\nconcerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible\nfiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to\ndepart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of\nhim to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put\nin action;--he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his\nresearch, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and\nthat in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer\nclimates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their\nrage upon the devoted country.--He at last, however, mounted his\nhorse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too\nlate. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown;\nimmediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far,\nthe power of the storm was above--its echoing thunders had scarcely\nan interval of rest--its thick heavy rain forced its way through the\ncanopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and\nradiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was\ncarried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The\nanimal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare\nof lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly\nlifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which\nsurrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to\nguide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the\npelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment\nsilent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling\nwith the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost\nunbroken sound;--he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which\nagain rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the\ndoor of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound,\nhowever, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he\ncalled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He\nfound himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized;\nwhen a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded;\nand he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman:\ndetermined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but\nit was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous\nforce against the ground:--his enemy threw himself upon him, and\nkneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat--when\nthe glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave\nlight in the day, disturbed him;--he instantly rose, and, leaving his\nprey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the\nbranches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm\nwas now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by\nthose without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the\nmud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy\nflakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had\nattracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what\nwas his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon\nhim, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a\nlifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision\narising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same\nform, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no\ncolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a\nstillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life\nthat once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon\nher throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this\nthe men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A\nVampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid\nby the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many\nbright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had\ndied within her. He knew not what his thoughts were--his mind was\nbenumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in\nvacancy--he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a\nparticular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were\nsoon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of\nher whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they\napproached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful\ncatastrophe. --To describe their grief would be impossible; but when\nthey ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at\nAubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died\nbroken-hearted.\n\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was\noften delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven\nand upon Ianthe--by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg\nof his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he\nwould imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her\ndestroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens,\nand, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey,\nimmediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant\nattendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was\nhorrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now\ncombined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words,\nimplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their\nseparation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which\nhe showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed\nquite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so\nastonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid,\nhe again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey\nperceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he\nwas surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile\nof malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but\nthis smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's\nrecovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless\nwaves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of\nthose orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;--indeed, he\nappeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\n\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity\nof spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled\nfor ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord\nRuthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find\nit in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he\nhad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side--if he\nsought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst\nthe underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning\nround, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded\nthroat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes,\nevery feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind.\nHe proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the\ntender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should\nvisit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in\nevery direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could\nbe attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet\nthey seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of\nrobbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they\nimagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was\nto excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended\ndangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the\ninhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards,\nmore to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a\nnarrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with\nlarge masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices,\nthey had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the\nwhole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled\nby the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed\nreport of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and,\nplacing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction\nwhence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their\nexample, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the\ndefile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with\ninsulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting\nslaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in\nthe rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the\nenemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven\nreceived a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground.\nAubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest\nor his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces\naround him--his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded,\nimmediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\n\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his\nwounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a\nransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence--they being\ncontent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return\nwith the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's\nstrength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and\ndeath seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance\nhad not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of\nthe objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his\nmind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey,\nwho was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual\nearnestness--\"Assist me! you may save me--you may do more than\nthat--I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little\nas that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's\nhonour.\"--\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.--\"I\nneed but little--my life ebbs apace--I cannot explain the\nwhole--but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were\nfree from stain in the world's mouth--and if my death were unknown\nfor some time in England--I--I--but life.\"--\"It shall not be\nknown.\"--\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant\nviolence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears,\nswear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of\nmy crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may\nhappen, or whatever you may see. \"--His eyes seemed bursting from\ntheir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his\npillow, and breathed no more.\n\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances\nattending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he\nknew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over\nhim, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him.\nRising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which\nhe had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that\nit was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades,\nupon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according\nto a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to\nthe first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey\nastonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury\nit upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit\nhe found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the\nrobbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had\nlaid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but\nhe at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the\nsake of the clothes.\n\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes,\nand in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious\nmelancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and\nsoon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to\nOtranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects\nhe had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there\nwas a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted\nto ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and\nataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms,\nwhat was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the\nsame style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut--he\nshuddered--hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and\nhis horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though\npeculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to\nneed no further certainty--they seemed gazing to be bound to the\ndagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form,\nthe same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in\nsplendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops\nof blood on each.\n\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were\nconcerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's\nseductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined,\nand she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship.\nAubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he\nwas afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of\nIanthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted\nin urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the\nlife of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which\nseemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores;\nand he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a\nmoment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister,\nall memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had\ngained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was\nstill more attaching as a companion.\n\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and\napplause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light\nbrilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded\napartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind\nbeneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to\narise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to\nindicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that\nlight footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may\nattract--it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never\nbrightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her\nhis affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew\ndestroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the\nvoluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,--that face were then playing\nin the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen,\nand had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her\nguardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her\nbrother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector.\nIt was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was\nfast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy\nscene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his\nfathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could\nnot feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when\nhis mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he\ndetermined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his\nsister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day,\nwhich had been announced as a drawing-room.\n\nThe crowd was excessive--a drawing-room had not been held for a long\ntime, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty,\nhastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was\nstanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged\nin the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in\nthat very place--he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a\nvoice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear--\"Remember your\noath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre\nthat would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the\nsame figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first\nentry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear\ntheir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing\na passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and\nwas driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his\nhands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting\nfrom his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him--circumstances started\nup in dreadful array--the dagger--his oath.--He roused himself, he\ncould not believe it possible--the dead rise again!--He thought his\nimagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It\nwas impossible that it could be real--he determined, therefore, to\ngo again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord\nRuthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in\ngaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the\nassembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a\nmatron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own\ndevouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he\nroused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded\nby several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass\nand get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round,\nand revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang\nforward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her\ntowards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd\nof servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged\nin passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to\nhim--\"Remember your oath!\"--He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his\nsister, soon reached home.\n\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed\nby one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that\nthe certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts.\nHis sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she\nintreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He\nonly uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he\nthought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;--was he\nthen to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath,\namidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister\nmight have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath,\nand disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of\nemploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but\ndeath, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in\nthis state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his\nsister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for\nher sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing\nstillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to\nstreet, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became\nneglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to\nthe midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he\nreturned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down\nto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his\nsafety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by\nhim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any--from thought. His\nconduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left\nby his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of\nwhose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again\ninto society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of\nhis oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he\nentered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so\nstriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at\nlast obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a\nsociety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance\nproved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and,\nfearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high\ntime to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon\nthem by Aubrey's parents.\n\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily\nencountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to\nthe general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they\nengaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of\nhim. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind\nabsorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so\ngreat, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie\nfor days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes\nhad attained a glassy lustre;--the only sign of affection and\nrecollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister;\nthen he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that\nseverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do\nnot touch him--if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\"\nWhen, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was,\n\"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could\nrouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year\nwas passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw\noff a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that\nseveral times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite\nnumber, and then smile.\n\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one\nof his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his\nphysician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so\nawful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married.\nInstantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to\nwhom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared\nhe had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden.\nThinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey\nseemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his\nintention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his\nsister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with\nhim. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the\ninfluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and\nkissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her\nbrother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began\nto speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her\nmarriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every\naccomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast;\nopening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the\nmonster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in\na paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him\nwhy he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked\nas if he did not understand her--then seizing her hands, and gazing\non her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear\nthat she would never wed this monster, for he----  But he could not\nadvance--it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his\noath--he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him\nbut saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had\nheard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder,\nentered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him.\nHe fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to\ndelay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they\nimagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him,\nand retired.\n\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had\nbeen refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill\nhealth, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when\nhe learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure\ncould hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this\ninformation. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by\nconstant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the\nbrother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss\nAubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils\nto recount--could speak of himself as of an individual having no\nsympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he\naddressed himself;--could tell how, since he knew her, his existence,\nhad begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he\nmight listen to her soothing accents;--in fine, he knew so well how to\nuse the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained\nher affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to\nhim, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for\nhastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,)\nwhich was to take place the very day before his departure for the\ncontinent.\n\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted\nto bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was\ngiven him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she\nvalued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now\nin the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the\nhope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on\nwhich he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they\nwould deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better\nnot to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered,\nthe ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy\ninmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more\neasily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation.\nMorning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey\ngrew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame\ntheir vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody\nof an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound\nwas out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment\nwhere all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to\nperceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by\nforce, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the\nstaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear--\"Remember your oath,\nand know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women\nare frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who,\nroused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no\nlonger support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a\nblood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to\nhis sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was\nafraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride\nand bridegroom left London.\n\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms\nof the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might\nbe called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related\ncomposedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.\n\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived,\nit was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had\nglutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\n\n\n  ________________________________________________________________\n\n                         EXTRACT OF A LETTER,\n\n                        CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT\n\n                                  OF\n\n                        LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE\n\n                                IN THE\n\n                         ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\n  ________________________________________________________________\n\n                               ACCOUNT\n\n                                  OF\n\n                     LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n                            ______________\n\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and\n                        Providence his guide.\"\n\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his\nMajesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of\nMitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and\nthe certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there,\ninduce many British vessels to visit it--both men of war and\nmerchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships\nbound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a\nvoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the\nmen were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle\nwith the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave\ncalled Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On\nthe brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and\nengaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio\nwith an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our\narrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek,\n\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit\nMitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very\ngood man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him,\nand he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the\nwine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English\ncurrency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not\nconstantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different\nislands.\"\n\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in\nhastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were\nkindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It\nconsisted of four apartments on the ground-floor--an entrance hall, a\ndrawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious\ncloset annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained\nwalls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and\na small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the\nbranches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus\nin a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture.\nIn the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty\nbook-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The\nbedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two\nstuffed cotton quilts and a pillow--the common bed throughout Greece.\nIn the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man\ntold us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large\nseaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think\nourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the\nrecess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works\ncomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German\nlanguage; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of\nthe Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at\nParma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at\nConstantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description.\nMost of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a\npencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all\nover, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\n\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening\nbefore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\"\nsaid he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so\nparticular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would\nfrown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once\ndid him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble\nof taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged\nArmenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord\nbrought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\n\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in\nfront was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble\npillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now\ncustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the\nroof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by\na fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most\nof the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass\ntheir evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma\nchristi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\n\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided\naway, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its\nborders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat\nwith an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the\nlord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock,\nreading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old\nman, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church\ntwice a week, besides Sundays.\"\n\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\"\nA line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with\nolive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient\nGreek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from\nthe ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods\nnear the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon\nunshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a\nlittle on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees,\nseveral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light\nblue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more\nthan I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of\nthe person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his\nname but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\"\nsaid our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"--\"And\ncannot you tell, old friend?\" said I--\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare\nnot.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the\ntown we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had\nportioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even\ndanced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man,\nhorses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving\nthese articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost\nhis own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor\nchildren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have\nbeen a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we\nlearnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to\ndisclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was\noften seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a\npiano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\n\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle\nof Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this\nrambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had\nphilanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark\npeculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled.\nFalling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S,\nwho had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said\nhe, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my\ntravels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\"\nWe had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some\nyears from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we\nrecognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret\nnot having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we\nconsoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some\nfuture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this\nstatement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his\nlordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been\ndescribed as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with\nhuman nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add\nto its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly\ngathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the\nheart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have\ntheir seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to\nguide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an\nadditional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion\nhath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her\nmantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without\nfeeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or\npleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are\never to be received with caution, particularly when directed against\nman's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that\nawful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of\na fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do\ngood in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony\nof a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\n\n\n                               THE END\n                        ____________________\n\n             Gillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Vampyre; A Tale, by John William Polidori\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE VAMPYRE; A TALE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6087-8.txt or 6087-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/0\/8\/6087\/\n\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1329,"split":"test"}
