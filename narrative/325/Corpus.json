Frye tries to rape her, but she forces him to leave at gunpoint and calls the police. Detective Tony Clemenza tells her that Frye has an airtight alibi as the police called his home and he answered, proving that he couldn't have been anywhere near Los Angeles that night.\nThe next day Frye returns and attacks Hilary again, this time receiving several stab wounds before escaping. She calls the police and once again meets with Clemenza, who tells her that Frye's body has been found and takes her to the morgue to identify it. Afterward, Clemenza asks Hilary out, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\nHilary is once again attacked by a man who appears to be Frye. \"Frye\" escapes just before Clemenza arrives and Hilary tells him what happened. After some investigations, Frye's psychologist lets them listen to a tape recording of one of Frye's sessions. Frye talks about identical twins being born with cauls on their faces, and says he read somewhere that this was a mark of a demon.\nFrye has been killing women he believes are possessed by the spirit of his dead mother, who abused him and said she would come back from the dead. He believes that Hilary is his mother's latest \"host\".\nHilary and Tony meet a retired madam who tells them that Leo, Frye's grandfather, brought his daughter, Katherine, there to be cared for after he got her pregnant. Shortly after Leo's death, Katherine gave birth to identical twin boys. The twins were born with cauls on their faces, leading the mentally unstable Katherine to believe they were demons. She raised her sons as if they were one person. They were both called Bruno, and both were rewarded or punished for anything either one of them did.\nFinally, Hilary and Clemenza return to Frye's home, where he once again attacks them, before being killed during a struggle with Clemenza.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Whispers, by Paul Cameron Brown\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

a wave to shore,\nknocks a vigorous reef,\nthen slides to sea once more.\n\nThe coral pink horizon of the mouth,\ncavernous shores,\nmy tongue laps pier white teeth\nin servitude like an oar.\n\n\nHeavy drifting, bobbing as a buoy,\nthe tongue sinks slowly down before\nsurprising saliva\ngoing ashore.\n9\n***************************************************************\nRAIN FILM\n\nOn the night of the rains,\nwater was oozing out from\nthe sky's swollen stitches,\na rash developed across\nthe meaning of the heavens.\n\nThe wooden floors of my attic place\nstrove for a deeper tone,\na hoarse calling\ngrew louder as I paced\ntrying to see rain.\n\nI followed the gravity of the treasure hunt\nwhere each bounce meant a slap\nacross a table top of tension,\nwhere the window basted winter black rain\nand silence paid another call.\n\nI am as much as this water flower, rain.\nI am as impressionable as the city that stops for rain.\nAnd I lack the same substance that dooms water to be\na soft pillow feather; excepting this,\nI may still shatter this thing, March routine existence\nby dabbling in destruction.\n10\n***************************************************************\nISLES AND RIVULETS\n\nOn your brow, the steppes of Asia\nare fetched by deep set eyes\nA colouring distict with mystery\nperceives the Polos greeting the Great Khan,\nthe golden isle of Ciphangu, the sultry east.\n\nI revel in the mystery\nof my warm, wet flower.\nA pollen bee laden with honey\nsquirms, embraces with me,\nin the abrupt opening of our jar,\nserrated edge of the known world.\n\nThe air, buoyed and elastic with pleasure, belongs to me.\nTawny, pale rose, your oriental skin\npeels back\nthe tiny veils separating our cultures.\nI peer in to find Confucian\nlilac, towers of silence,\nopal pheasants.\n\nHarmony strains all dogmas.\nRain darts penetrate the gathering pools.\nThe tiny plastic cup\nmy life,\ninseparable from your hand.\n11\n***************************************************************\nSEAWARD\n\nWhirl of patterned images,\ndeep seascape painting\nhovering,\nrustle, chokecherry\ngrown in\ndark pigmented\nstunted cove - animal\ngrowl of pilotless sea,\nmetallic twinkle of sun\nbright, stealing\nbitter white\nall bird life\nrockward;\ntraces skimming\nthe intrusion\nof pebbly shore,\nautumnal night.\n12\n***************************************************************\nMALINGERING\n\nMalingering,\nincrease drift\nof censure\ninfrared blotted one.\n\n\nNo noise, just\nthe splashing of the sea\nendless, shrill\nbirds\ngaping a way\ninto the night's chill.\n13\n\n***************************************************************\nVOYAGE\n\nThe mystique of the sea,\nwhere waves act as snares,\nhang boughs over wet\nblackness wherever winds\ndie driven ashore.\n\nMelancholy vastness-its pleasure\nthe dim lights swallowed\nin glutton happiness\nthe further I search\nthe sea.\n14\n***************************************************************\nCHRYSALIS\n\nFury of chrysalis, or crepuscular caterpillar's roosting nest,\nFidgeting cocoon dry in annoyance and the reptile caress\nOf empty sound.\nSee it near the trestle,\nAbove broad November leaves,\nBefore winter's closing eye.\n\nComatose pupa, infringing\nIn dormancy well primed,\nAnd charged with action\nIts focus, brittle reality,\nDistant life unaware around even itself.\n\nWaiting, the syringe filled ecstasy is\nBarest of autistic treasure\nSatiate, 'til spilled and\nMolten over toughened silken hide,\nThe outer dormitory\nHustles to rejoin\nCompost spring\nControlling a tidy, energy world.\n15\n***************************************************************\nTHE BELLS\n\nThe dangling of bells\n...amid faint tingling,\nthe inspirational nature of their lies\nbetween each peal.\n\nClassical repertoire, then dryness.\nHeavy swelter, the green ore\niron casting of the golden bell\nclangs into the night.\nIts dash against dry stone\na special brand of hideousness.\n\nNaked madness,\nthe jangle of the noise\ntorn from the throat of night,\ntucked between the rage of sightless villagers;\ntheir torn members\ntoys of plastic\nwedged obscene within the dash of withered bells.\n16\n***************************************************************\nTHE WORLD OF DYING LOVE\n\nThe long finger of blackness is holding its head for us.\nDingy bue is its shade,\ncomatose in movement, hazarding a slow swiftness,\nit inches toward us.\n\nRelief comes fitfully.\nThe dragon alone, an upstart\ncrowned with drunken spending,\nhas horse colours as ribbons with his eyes.\nIt cradles a breast of trembling bone.\n\nMisercorde, Misercorde.\nI dreamt I saw skeletal slackness\ndangling;\nthe poverty of touch is a casket\nwith love in rumbling sockets.\nCraziness is the passion of the engulfed,\ndribbling pleasantly.\n\nPresentations extended beyond and into themselves.\nSlackness schemes with invalid awareness\nin a brothel of hope.\n17\n***************************************************************\nPart II\nWHISPERS\n\nDARKENING GREEN\n\nMy mind, rarely with me alone,\nparts with energy,\nthe floor boards scuffed\nand landing beams just\nroosts big enough for pigeons\non leave from fields\ndarker for their grain.\n19\n***************************************************************\nWHISPERS\n\nSuppose and this is just supposing,\nthough it is a supposition of the highest order,\nI were to die tomorrow\n\nA roar denoting silence?\nAt work, if tradition is the dictate,\nsomething eulogistic would find itself being said.\n\nI am more calm.\nI perceive their layers more shrilly.\nPast the lipservice\nand shocked surprise,\nwhispers, rumours and\nthe grapevine would bruit\naround a different legacy.\n\nAnd the open bier?\nAn embrassassment.\nWhat more could be left unsaid?\n20\n***************************************************************\nTRESPASS\n\nI would imagine\nthe eyelids fail,\nfall closed, shut,\nas icicles sit\non porch doors\nwhere old nails rust.\n21\n***************************************************************\nFOREST SPITTLE\n\nThe preciseness of that little moment,\nbowler eyes in hot, top rays\neffervescent through\nspongy forest gloom,\nthe wet of the happy\nunreconciled with the dry outside.\n22\n***************************************************************\nSEAGULLS\nI see many thoughts from a window.\nSeagulls in the fashion of summer\nand leaves as they quit the year.\nSense impressions, if they are this,\nare only images\nof what we refuse to follow.\n23\n***************************************************************\nLA DOUCE MER\n\nToo greedy hormonal levels,\nsavouring drives and swooned walrus tusks\nbehind the deep belly\nof tireless sea,\npropel ocean crates\nlooser for their water\nthan blood\nto devour cavernous shores,\nswilling miniature inland\nsweet water seas that\nfather Champlain called\ndouce mer lakes;\ndubbing there a blow for courage.\n24\n***************************************************************\nGOURDS\nA cemetery overgrown\nsuch that each tombstone is a pauper fungus\ncrowded, dark with leaves,\nor hollow gourds hideous,\nin a forest sleep.\n25\n***************************************************************\nRESIGNATION\n\nPetals that fall into a woodland pool\nare servers at a banquet.\nEach one dresses for the occasion\nlike an employee with regrets,\nthat leaves the house in a somber mood\nthe morning after his resignation.\n26\n***************************************************************\nTHE BREATH OF CANDLES\n\nThe breath of candles,\nhot and murky,\non the still air.\n\nGiant factories wave wands\nin luxury;\ncontaminate roving commuter bands\nbrown, from dirt knitted through white bread hair.\n27\n***************************************************************\nGREEN EYE SHIELDS\n\nI have stars drying in my eyes.\nHeavy seas, in wind.\nThey have sealed me from the heavy\ndragging sockets, otherwise my green eye shields.\n\nI have scars all over my eyes,\nto bear the horrible imaginings\nthat try to come through.\n\nThe horror of being alive.\nThe crusty scenes that pry into trees\nglide down, touch me,\na glitter of awful gold steals me,\nin its triumph of glow.\n28\n***************************************************************\nINVESTITURE\n\nOur nights have cruel eyes\nAnd have cast us about too thinly,\nFallen upon us,\nDivested the attention of the wind.\n\nNight comes to develop us,\nWill polish our minds with\nA precision lasting 'til daybreak.\nIts damp coolness peaks with wretched effect.\n\nAutumnal decay\nWhereby the slow process of vegetation\nDispleases the nostril,\nIs but a preamble to greater violence\nLeading tepid legislation in an orchestra\nToward greater effect.\n\nThe thin harmony of our lives\nPositions no alarms whereby\nWe might use them.\n\nThe fabric mixture of existence, nothing but investiture,\nProps to heighten necessary lies,\nStrains at extinction,\nThe volcanic instrument life itself.\n\nGoals are these same vehicles\nTo operate weak desires.\nFrustration defeats a goal\nThat will not fit.\n29\n***************************************************************\nTHE SPOKEN WORD\nI touch your\nface - where strands of whispery hair\ndangle your thoughtful gaze through mine.\n\nClutching,\nall the words not said\nlie pale and broken\nbeneath forgery lies.\n\n\nEyes, our facial minnows, the mirror\nimages, flash too brightly\nout of the shallows,\nout of their stony commitments\ntowards believing\nwe cannot agree.\n30\n***************************************************************\nPart III\nTESTIMONY\n\nSMEARS\n\nA snowy morning\nunfolding\nI smear my eyes\nthe crimson details\nfrom my life.\n32\n***************************************************************\nTESTIMONY\n\nWhen snow falls, there lives\nthe shrill cries that\nleaves are not alone.\n\nEach flake, a mute testimony\nnot a leaf falls before\nsurgery prunes the individual tree.\n\nCold November after\nbrown and white conspire,\nthe forest leaves a bleeding crust,\nscar tissue from natural wars.\n33\n***************************************************************\nFORTRESS SNOW\n\nThe embankment lies as heavy\nedges on our lives.\nThe shadows of the rock,\npiled drifts huge monotony's ledge,\naccumulations by the side of the tree\nwear thin visages;\nthe breath of summer eclipsed.\n\nSnow reigns supreme;\nteeters about the rim\nof the city's existence.\nPettiness of man's realm - pretty\nfoliage of the transient,\nwrappings upon our lives\nbrittle near the storm.\n\nThe reply of the eternal,\nfire on stone\nblazons reality\nthe peaked remains\nof snow streaked sun.\n\nImmensity governs us;\nclarity of the temporal\nfire set by the staccato\nof man's rhythm.\n34\n***************************************************************\nCIENFUEGOS\n\nThe white pin wheel of heat turns up the grasses' edge.\nSome dried plant stalks shrivel,\nthen melt openly into layers of fire.\nIt is end - time for the community's Christmas trees.\n\nSomething akin to burnt offerings,\nreluctant souls or\nhedging captives kept alive\nghoulishly for some cannibal's feast;\nthis festival of crackling.\n\n\nThey have served their purpose, now.\nBound, no faggots need be applied.\nContumely, the quiet desperation darkens\nthe child's face.\n\nThe headlights rain down on Christmas' debris.\nA hundred little fires as cigarette warnings\ndaub the night air.\nThe forest of smoke, canyon of the torch,\nwhere black marauders poke the nostril.\n35\n***************************************************************\nDEVASTATION\n\nLittle red berries are\nthe crop of this stump tree.\nThey are the prize stubble\nwhere little growth is come.\n\nA transplant of hair after\na serious illness\nor after fire ravages\nthe body's wilderness\nis that first sip of broth taken.\n\nLittle by little, they bring cautious\nhope that more will\nstumble into other pocket crevices,\nthe bits of life amidst the spores of stillness.\n36\n***************************************************************\nBEE AN APPLE\nThe taste of an apple,\nthe cringing of a bee\nas sun stops turning\na ladle over their skins;\nthe fire gold stains\non apple's skin,\nthe honey yellow, black bits\na hornet wrinkles in.\n37\n***************************************************************\nEMPTINESS\n\nThe threadbare uniforms\nwe let stare at others\nwe would refuse ourselves.\n\nThe bare walls, misunderstanding,\nSupport nothing,\ntaut empty sounds.\n\nThe inclusion of everything\nexcludes nothing\nexcept why it was done.\n38\n***************************************************************\nCLAWS\nUnfolding gazes\nthrow over\nthe little reality\nsurly door.\nThe dumb\nclatter\nof ripples\nshudder the better life.\n39\n***************************************************************\nMOON DARK WORLD\n\nThe trees\nare forming hands\nto cloak the sky\nwith pillow whispers,\nuntil the soft equilibrium\nbehind laughing eyes\ndeparts down the moon dark world.\n40\n***************************************************************\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS\n\nThe Elysian fields\ngained commensurate with ability\nquiet and shimmering in the sun;\nvaried realms\ninverted islands\nthe angry blessed\nones - thrice born with\nthe option to survive\non into flesh and blood form.\n\nThe conveyer belt of souls\ncarrying the damaged ones\nfar into the night,\nspitting out the lukewarm\nwith plenty of latitude\nto manoeuvre\nin between.\n\nLavender and the dye from purple shells\nin piercing shrieks\nextracting the enacted will\nof Nietzscheans before their time;\nfledglings in a world\nill begotten and\nbarely within a choosing.\n41\n***************************************************************\nBARBARY WHITE\n\nHow death will steal, from life, to claim us all,\nHappy to wrap us in barbary white,\nBy tapping ash tight fingers, the steel laws of fate,\nWill deaden our faces, wrapping our feelings from earthly sight.\n42\n***************************************************************\nPart IV\nTHE BURNING\n\nPENCIL SKETCHES\n\nStaying home,\nI caught naughty elves\nwatering my piano,\ngrowling inside my head.\n\nFaucet drops\nbeating out in harmony a drum tatoo\nto the tune of a plugged drain,\nthe careless postures of indifference\nretold lives lived on spindle shanks\ncaught on the obligatory\ninsipid train\nof obliging a pantry full\nof ones you love.\n44\n***************************************************************\nEMPTY WARRIORS\n\nThe jungle where the meow goes in, is\na forest for hoodlums.\nTrucking up, the empty warriors\nbreakfast on lost impatience,\napricot fields away.\n\n\nNow see them speed away.\nTheir lollipop cars drizzling in the sun.\nTheir apathetic stares really cantaloupe harvests,\nleft too long in the sun.\n45\n***************************************************************\nTHE KEEPER OF THE JEWEL\n\nThe keeper of the jewel.\nI file it down,\nkeep it smooth.\n\nI can be found any day,\nbusy disguising the\njaded and unproved.\n\nI follow forget-me-nots\nin a forest pool.\n\nI undo knots\nin groves of shallow trees.\n\nI pretend unfit sores can sit\nalongside water smoothed\npebbles in a sunlit stream.\n46\n***************************************************************\nROWING WITH CRAYONS\n\nI see children rowing with crayons\nacross a park lagoon.\n\nThey are sagging,\nthey have just killed a blackbird playing:\n\nthe lot of you,\nscribbling to school.\n\nLater on, I retrieved\nthe pieces of paper, ink covered, from a field.\n47\n***************************************************************\nCOLLUSION\n\nA surtax on the ecosystem;\nso many raindrops, mists\nand bud breakings\nrecord spring days,\nthat the movement of sap\nfluids and other vital\njuices involves all life on a colossal\nscale; beyond puny human understanding\nwhy green shoots shed restrictions\nat the parochial level.\n48\n***************************************************************\nGOSSAMER THREADS\n\nI feel like cutting my finger,\nhiding upside down\nclinking a canteen\nshelling peas along the floor.\n\nFrom the focal point above\nanything could be.\nLight dripping upon\nforlorn gossamer spreads\nlike a balloon.\n\n\nMerely the vantage point\nof a perspective\nquietly threading.\n49\n***************************************************************\nA FACE\n\nA face in the mist, with rain around,\nclings to bare leaves frowning.\nA face through the mist, convulsed,\nplays stationary, perching from twigs.\nA face, not knowing it, trust it is good.\n50\n***************************************************************\nTHE BURNING\n\nThe sun is a burning magnet on the water.\nDurable, our boat is a sizable pretzel in the arms of the bay.\nWarmth with contortion, the clash of passions\ntug the funnelled swooned water.\n\nGreenery, that inlet of the ocean,\nlies precarious and submerged.\nLife, subsidized by water,\nis within its hope, bubbling in embers,\nfroth drunk with suds\nhammered against the boat's edge.\n\nWhat is this, this sky\nhome of the transparent sun.\nBlue agony,\nburning up with delerium,\nthe wet pastel illusion slides against our craniums.\n\nCrass, crass the movement of the waves\nacross a low bow, excessively pleasant.\nAll the more\ntroubled vistas\nblue with hegemony over earth,\ndrowsiness dropping a plague of lapping edges;\na strength pried from graves.\nThis sea of ours sags, heaves in deep\ndisplacement, fulfills my liquid caress.\n51\n***************************************************************\nPart V\nTHE GATHERING OF DEAD WOOD\n\nGREEN ANGELLIGHTS\n\nGreen angel lights\nstream from the willow tree,\nin direct symmetrical bearing\nthree birds are drawn to it.\n\nIn gold, soft patches\nof light overreach\nthe earth,\nshadows trace ridges\nto surround each teak blown colour.\n\nWith fakir lowliness,\nthe throb of water\ntakes petals from\nthe sun,\nshimmers its passing breath\nto a euphony sobbing\nin movement.\n53\n***************************************************************\nEYES INSIDE\n\nThere's cadence\na real movement\nto the worlds\nthe gaze inside\na flicker of\nyour eyes.\n54\n***************************************************************\nTHE HYDASPES\n\nAnd I, cooing in my saddle, with lost time.\nHis weapons and horses the finest.\nBeloved of God, engendered fiercely\nfor the occasion - with\npin stripes and a drinking vessel\nof the most expert silver.\n\nPharaonic splendor,\ningots of the heaviest gold\nborrowed sun bright yet so untarnished\nthey hold up the morning sky.\n\nTwo hands encase that handsome\nvolume - finest of imported leather and\nsaddle soap transparent to the eye\nso that all might ring forth\nits belated vision;\nnot be dreary earthed with brine\nbut terse,\nfurtive inside the gathering glade.\n55\n***************************************************************\nSLEIGH BELLS\n\nIn fury, come the Heavens,\nthe days, our horsebells\nupon a crystal sleigh.\nUp slowly until,\nthe horse carriage wet\nand coming up the evening\nwalk pauses; then snow\nbefore a vanished world.\n56\n***************************************************************\nORIFICE\n\nTo perforate in adumbration,\nas obviator, the sphincter muscle\nof intensity; then paint\nthe world in aperture,\na picture of one's mind.\n57\n***************************************************************\nPECULIAR MORNING\n\nAs if every living thing lived, breathed\nits existence\nexplained why water took the shape\nof a container,\nstudied sharpened awareness of cold,\nbroke night spots onto a peculiar morning.\n58\n***************************************************************\nWHERE\n\nA dark, shadow grey moth\nrests along the grim hue of brick,\nits spattered orange cream underwings scream a Halloween defiance\nto the bleariness of stone and city.\n\nAnd before each fold of its wings,\nthere rests beyond all the pale fire\nand din of a thousand slow eyed\nempires, feeling the seethe\nof their existence spent\nin a fidgeting cauldron\nwhere mediocrity camps\nwith her dangerous throne.\n59\n***************************************************************\nTHE TREASURE SHIPS\n\nRich ornamental procession\nenough wealth to dazzle a Prester John,\nSheba's queen, even the fawning\nburghers of Rothschild's domain.\n\nReams of it,\nPark Avenues in\ntorrents down a mountain side;\nEldorados,\nthe gardens of Babylon become shimmering in the sun;\nthis vulgar display,\nthis sheer ostentation.\n\nSuch are the waters of the rich I now approach.\nPeach gold fabulous wealth.\nMore men of substance here\nthan all the proverbial luxury since antiquity,\n- talents, ingots, ducats - bars\nso heavily encrusted with gems\nthe very floor boards groan\nwith the largesse.\n\n\nNever a Buddha's tooth\nPierpont scheme,\ncrown\nor outstretched finger\ndid circumnavigate\nmore treasure\nthan this eye\nswelling around\nthat one treasure chest procured.\nLike a ship glutting the Spanish Main\n- my treasure ship -\nshe vies with me\nmy memories\nMidas' gold\nor Krupp's iron wealth secured\nall of which is a ransom\nparleying against the crowned heads of this world.\n60, 61\n***************************************************************\nHANNIBAL\n\nWhen Hannibal mowed down Romans\nwith elephants,\nhis skill, his artistry,\nhad the effect of a painter's brush.\n\nHe, scraping paint off an easel,\nwould thrust\nempires down,\ntrample Graeco - Romish influence\ninto paint spattered dust.\n\n\nHe neither was aware nor knew,\nthe Alps and Sabine allies,\nCapua and other Latin tribes\nwould ruin his oath,\ncause Baal, the false god,\nto desert Punic prayers.\n62\n***************************************************************\nTHE GATHERING OF DEAD WOOD\n\nThe gathering of dead wood - driven,\npinched in faces between\nthe strain of Van Gogh's setting -\nhad all the more realism\nhastening down that leaden street.\n\nChurning sockets, burdened with the duress of suffering,\nthe street in vigorous winter\nraced like a bootblack\nup from the river. Hedged by\nblack stems called trees, rows\nof withered houses and dim bread shops\npropositioned rough headlights\nalong a promenade of ice stalks\nand careening streetlamps.\n\nFast in the cold,\nfaces were juggernauts\nskating treacherously\nover the pond of that closed city.\n63\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Whispers, by Paul Cameron Brown\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHISPERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30101-8.txt or 30101-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/0\/1\/0\/30101\/\n\nProduced by Al Haines.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/gutenberg\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":325,"split":"train"}
