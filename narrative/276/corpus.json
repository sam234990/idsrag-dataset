{"ori_id":"405df1ccf0409ea6040c2a765a0315878f991d79","title":"Goodfellas","context":"Goodfellas\n Henry Hill says, \"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster\", referring to his idolization of gangsters in his 1950s blue-collar, predominantly Italian-American neighborhood in East New York, Brooklyn. Wanting to be part of something significant, Henry quits school and goes to work for them. He is able to make a living for himself and learns the two most important lessons in life: \"Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut\", the advice given to him after being acquitted of criminal charges early in his career.\nHenry is taken under the wing of local mob leader, Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates: James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Conway, who loves hijacking trucks; and Tommy DeVito, an aggressive armed robber with a temper. In late 1967, they commit the Air France Robbery. Enjoying the perks of their criminal life, they spend most of their nights at the Copacabana carousing with women. Henry meets and later marries Karen, a Jewish woman from the Five Towns area of Long Island. Karen is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities but is soon seduced by his glamorous lifestyle.\nOn June 11, 1970, Billy Batts, a mobster in the Gambino Crime Family, insults Tommy about being a shoeshine boy in his younger days. Enraged, Tommy and Jimmy attack and kill him. Knowing their murder of a made member would mean retribution from the Gambino crime family, which could possibly include Paulie himself being ordered to kill them, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy cover up the murder. They transport the body in the trunk of Henry's car and bury it upstate. Six months later, Jimmy learns the burial site will be developed, forcing them to exhume the decomposing corpse and move it.\nHenry sets up his mistress, Janice Rossi, in an apartment. When Karen finds out about their relationship, she tries to confront Janice at the apartment building and then threatens Henry at gunpoint at home. Henry goes to live in the apartment with Janice, but Paulie mediates and directs him to return to Karen after completing a job for him; Henry and Jimmy are sent to collect from an indebted gambler in Florida. However, they are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, a typist for the FBI. Jimmy and Henry receive ten-year prison sentences.\nIn prison, Henry sells drugs smuggled in by Karen to support his family on the outside. After his early release in 1978, Henry further establishes himself in the drug trade, ignoring Paulie's ban on drug trafficking, and convinces Tommy and Jimmy to join him. Jimmy and a lot of Henry's associates commit the Lufthansa heist at John F. Kennedy International Airport, stealing $6 million. However, after a few members buy expensive items and the getaway car is found by police, Jimmy has most of the crew killed. Tommy is eventually killed in retribution for Batts' murder, having been fooled into thinking he would become a made man.\nBy May 11, 1980, Henry is a nervous wreck from cocaine use and insomnia. He tries to organize a drug deal with his associates in Pittsburgh, however he is arrested by narcotics agents and jailed. After being bailed out, Karen tells him she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving the family virtually penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's dealing drugs, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends any association with him. Facing federal charges, and realizing Jimmy plans to have him killed, Henry decides to enroll in the Witness Protection Program. He gives sufficient testimony to have Paulie and Jimmy arrested and convicted. Forced out of his gangster life, Henry now has to face living in the real world. He narrates: \"I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook\".\nSubtitles explain that Henry was subsequently arrested on drug charges in Seattle, Washington, but has been clean since 1987. He and Karen separated in 1989 after twenty five years of marriage. Paul Cicero died in Fort Worth Federal Prison of respiratory illness in 1988 at age 73. Jimmy, in 1990, was serving a twenty-year-to-life sentence in a New York State prison.\n<html><head><title>GOOD FELLAS by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorcese\n<\/title>\n<script>\n<!--\nif (window!= top)\ntop.location.href=location.href\n\/\/ -->\n<\/script>\n<\/head>\n<pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    GOOD FELLAS\n\n                                by Nicholas Pileggi\n                                        and\n                                  Martin Scorcese\n\n                            Based on the book Wiseguys\n                                        by\n                                  Nicholas Pileggi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       Shooting Draft\n                                                       January 3, 1989\n                                                       Revised 1\/12\/89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               JUNE 11, 1970S  QUEENS, NEW YORK.

We hear noise of doors opening \n               and tools being banged around in the dark.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         SSHHH. You'll wake 'er up.\n\n               Suddenly the light in the entryway goes on, and WE SEE \n               TOMMY'S MOTHER, in housecoat, beaming at her SON and his \n               FRIENDS.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n               where TOMMY'S MOTHER' hovers over the seated TOMMY, HENRY \n               and JIMMY.

Yon hardly touched \n                         anything. Did Tommy tell you about \n                         my painting? Look.\n\n               WE SEE her reach next to the refrigerator and pull up a \n               couple of oil paintings she props on the edge of the table.\n\n                                     MOTHER (CONTD)\n                              (proudly)\n                         They want me to do a portrait next. \n                         I'm gonna do the Moan Lisa.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n               WINDOW\n\n               where WE SEE HENRY 's car with the body in the trunk, still \n               parked at the curb.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Finally on their way, HENRY is driving. JIMMY, in the \n               passenger's seat, and TOMMY, in the rear seat, embracing \n               the shovel, are dozing off. The sleepy humming of the wheels \n               is suddenly interrupted by a thumping sound. At first, \n               HENRY thinks he has a flat, but the thumping is too \n               irregular. JIMMY awakens. His eyes are on HENRY. TOMMY \n               leans forward from the rear seat. Silence.  Thump Silence.\n\n               EXT. MERRITT PARKWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Car pulls off the road onto the grass. HENRY, JIMMY and \n               TOMMY, still holding the shovel, get out of the car.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Jesus Christ! Miserable bastard!\n\n               HENRY opens the trunk and steps back.  In the trunk light \n               WE SEE the mattress cover squirming around. We hear muffled \n               groans.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                              (raising the shovel)\n                         Can you believe this no-good fuck? \n                         The prick! He's still alive.\n\n               TOMMY suddenly smashes the shovel into the moving, bloody \n               mattress cover.  He smashes it again and again and again. \n               Cursing BATTS with every swing.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Rat bastard.\n                              (he swings shovel)\n                         No-good, low-life fuck.\n\n               TOMMY swings shovel again and again.\n\n               Soon the mattress cover stops squirming and TOMMY stops \n               swinging the shovel. He is exhausted. TOMMY and JIMMY get \n               back in the car.  HENRY is facing the open trunk.\n\n               TILT UP and FREEZE ON HENRY'S face slamming the trunk shut.\n\n                                     HENRY (V.O.)\n                         As far back as I can remember, I \n                         always wanted to be a gangster.\n\n               MAIN TITLE:\n\n                                      GOOD FELLAS\n\n               UNFREEZE and\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               HENRY - AS A CHILD\n\n               looking out his bedroom window.\n\n               TITLE - EAST NEW YORK:  BROOKLYN.  1955.\n\n                                     HENRY (V.O.)\n                         To me, being a gangster was better \n                         than being President of the United \n                         States.\n\n               EXT.

He said they \n                         were bums and that I was a bum.  \n                         He said I was going to get into \n                         trouble.  I used to say I was only \n                         running errands after school, but \n                         he knew better.  He knew what went \n                         on at the cabstand and, every once \n                         in a while, usually after he got \n                         his load on, I had to take a \n                         beating. But by then, I didn't \n                         care. No matter how many beatings \n                         I took, I wouldn't listen to what \n                         he said.  I don't think I even \n                         heard him.

A QUIET PLUSH BANQUETTE IN THE VILLA CAPRA\n\n               A red damask restaurant. TOMMY and HENRY are seated on the \n               outside of a U-shaped banquette with their two girls, DIANE \n               and KAREN, seated inside.  DIANE is being wooed and pawed \n               by a blissful TOMMY. DIANE is enjoying every bit of TOMMY'S \n               undivided attention. KAREN has not touched her melted baked \n               Alaska and is looking directly at HENRY. HENRY is stirring \n               his coffee.\n\n                                     HENRY (V.O.)\n                         I had a meeting with Tuddy around \n                         eleven o'clock and here I am a \n                         back-up guy.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                              (sarcastically)\n                         Have more coffee.

I was \n                         ordering the dessert when they \n                         were eating dinner. When they were \n                         having coffee, I was asking for a \n                         check.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                              (to Henry, while \n                              hugging Diana)\n                         Isn't she great?

I thought \n                         he was really obnoxious. He kept \n                         fidgeting around.\n\n               EXT.

It \n                         was ridiculous. But Diana and Tommy \n                         had made us promise to meet them \n                         again on Friday night. We agreed. \n                         Of course, when Friday night came \n                         around, Henry stood me up.\n\n               INT.

The \n               HOODS scatter and WE SEE that HENRY is terrified.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                              (charging out of \n                              the door, screaming)\n                         You've got some nerve.

I \n                         remember she's screaming, but mostly \n                         I'm looking at her eyes. They were \n                         just like Elizabeth Taylor's.

BRUCE's head is still \n               off the ground only because HENRY refuses to let go of his \n               hair.  BRUCE'S BROTHERS realize HENRY has a gun. They freeze \n               and back off.\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n                              (from a window)\n                         HELP! Police!

I've got to admit \n                         the truth.  It turned me on.\n\n               WE SEE KAREN look around to make sure no one else has seen \n               her.

KAREN'S PARENTS' HOUSE\n\n               WE SEE hands carefully wrapping a white linen table napkin \n               around some object.

We are at a \n               small Jewish living room wedding with a canopy and RABBI \n               and it was HENRY who broke the glass as a part of the \n               ritual.  KAREN'S PARENTS are glumly looking on. HENRY'S \n               PARENTS are even glummer. Only MICHAEL, HENRY's brother in \n               the wheelchair, looks pleased.\n\n               INT.

Plus, they \n                         were all married to girls named \n                         Marie, and they named all their \n                         daughters Marie. By the time I \n                         finished meeting everybody.

When I was broke \n                         I just went out and robbed some \n                         more. We ran everything.  We paid \n                         off lawyers. We paid off cops. \n                         Everybody had their hands out. And \n                         now it's all over.\n\n               EXT.

Yon can't even get decent \n                         food. Right after I got hare I \n                         ordered some spaghetti with marinara \n                         sauce and I got egg noodles and \n                         ketchup.\n\n               CAMERA APPROACHES house and TRACKS IS TO DOOR OF HOUSE as \n               it opens.
